PURPOSES ONLY

DISSOLVE TO:

SHARON

Can you hear me?

(shouting, off)

This one's conscious!

VOICE (O.S.)

Paramedics on the way!

(CONTINUED)

2.

SHARON

Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can

you feel that?

SHARON

That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on

-- as hard as you can.

SHARON

It's over, and I've got you, and

you're safe. You're safe now.

You got that? Don't let go.

Don't let me go.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHARON

That car is older than they are.

ROBBY

'67 Chevy Impala.

SHARON

That's what I said.

(CONTINUED)

3.

ROBBY

Needs a servicing.

SHARON

Don't we all.

SHARON

Get it together, officer.

ROBBY

Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my

coffee again! You didn't like his

hair, or what?

SHARON

I love Elvis hair. They were

going two damn miles an hour.

ROBBY

Let's roll to this -- fight in

progress.

(CONTINUED)

4.

CATCH

Y'know... since we're both walking

the same way, I could take one of

those bags for you. That way, I

do some upper body work while I'm

walking along. Helps my back.

What d'you say?

CATCH

Right now your mind's making

pictures of me robbing your

groceires, but, y'know, nine times

out of ten, people do the right

thing.

OLD MAN

It's the dog food that makes it so

heavy.

CATCH

I guess it's worth it... for a

good dog.

5.

KID

Look at this bitch.    Whoo!   Benny,

look at this!

KID

(to Sharon)

You come in with me.    Hey, bitch.

KID

You're going to arrest me, you

come into the back seat with me.

Come on!

KID

Come on.   We'll have a good time.

SHARON

(to radio)

Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to

the jail with one male prisoner.

KID

Take off your uniform. Take off

my handcuffs, bitch, and come back

here. I want one touch.

ROBBY

Give it a rest!

(CONTINUED)

6.

KID

If you're going to put me away,

you gotta give me one sweet touch.

KID

That ain't the touch.   That ain't

the touch I want.

ROBBY

As I remove your cuffs, I want you

to put your hands here. Spread

your legs. More.

ROBBY

That's it.   Back off, John, we got

it.

SANDERMAN

You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?

SHARON

I just dealt with the situation.

The prisoner...

(CONTINUED)

7.

SANDERMAN

And you don't see a pattern here?

(pause)

I want you to keep yourself way

inside the line instead of walking

on it. All right? Are you taking

notes?

ROBBY

You broke his nose.

SHARON

He grabbed me.     End of story.

ROBBY

And you were waiting for him. You

were hoping. You were making

long-range plans for his ass while

he was mouthing off in the car --

and you're supposed to be above

that shit.

SHARON

If you think I crossed the line,

put it in the report.

ROBBY

Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?

You pissed off at me, too?

SHARON

Not you, Rob. You're a rare

unthreatened male cop with a good

marriage, and you like to eat

where I eat -- so everything's

code four.

ROBBY

Come over    for dinner tonight.

I'll call    Charlene. She'd like to

see you.     It's been awhile. We'll

talk about    it.

(CONTINUED)

8.

SHARON

Thanks. But  she'll invite

friends, try and fix me up. She's

always trying to fix me up so she

doesn't have to worry about you

and me.

ROBBY

She doesn't worry about that.

SHARON

They all worry about that.

SHARON

You don't need to fix me, Robby,

or fix me up. I don't want some

guy to heart and soul me and then

walk away 'cause he can't stand

the cop thing -- or worse: he

wants cop stories every night

'cause it turns him on, and he has

no idea who I am inside my head.

Anyway, I'm busy tonight.

ROBBY

Got some action, huh?    Well,

that's promising.

SHARON

Yeah.   Hot and heavy.

IMMEDIATE CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

9.

CATCH

Hey! You want to turn that volume

down? What's your point?

DRIVER (MAN)

What did you say?

CATCH

What's the point of blasting your

music through the whole zip code?

Don't you realize there are kids

trying to sleep in these

apartments -- old people, sick

people?

DRIVER

You better watch your mouth,

asshole.

CATCH

Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill

me?

MAN #2

Guy's nuts.   Let's go.

10.

CANDACE

Hi.

CATCH

Hi.   Your keys are in the...

CANDACE

Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.

God. I was trying to carry Tommy

and all these bags. He was so

tired. Of course, as soon as I

put him down he had all this

energy...

CANDACE

Y'know, we were just baking

nectarine bars because the peaches

weren't ripe. Ever had a

nectarine bar?

CATCH

Sorry.   Gotta be going.

11.

MRS. VANDER

Sherry!

SHARON

Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking

good.

MRS. VANDER

Oh, you just wait. I splurged.

MRS. VANDER

It's for the church and the party.

It's just a little too long.

SHARON

Looks great.

MRS. VANDER

Y'know, I cried over the

invitation -- just imagine me in

church.

(laughs)

It'll be so good to spend time

with you.

(CONTINUED)

12.

MRS.   VANDER

You know Dan and I   renewed our

vows last year. I    bet that's

where your mom got   the idea.

SHARON

Their vows?

MRS. VANDER

Your mom and dad -- the

ceremony...

MRS. VANDER

Oh, well... y'know, I just got

that invitation a few... just now,

so I'm sure you'll...

SHARON

Oh, yeah. We've had... there's

been some problems with the mail

in our building, so... I'll

probably get it today.

SHARON

So, I guess I'll see you.

MRS. VANDER

Sure, honey.     I'll see you there.

(CONTINUED)

13.

SHARON

I didn't see his truck, so...

LARRY

He's not here.

SHARON

How you doing?

LARRY

I'm okay.

SHARON

Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big

now.

LARRY

Growin' fast.

SHARON

Is he looking more like you now --

or did he get lucky?

LARRY

He's got Kathy's looks and brains

and my strong back. You should

feel his grip.

(pause)

You just passing by?

SHARON

Place is coming along nice. The

octagon window. Dad's signature.

SHARON

Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to

hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about

what's happening.

(CONTINUED)

14.

LARRY

What's happening?

SHARON

(hurt)

So you really weren't going to

tell me? Nobody was going to tell

me? Mom and Dad renewing their

vows, the church, the party. Mrs.

Vander is all excited. She bought

a new dress. It's blue.

LARRY

We're workin' on Dad. We think

you should be there. We told him.

SHARON

Mom told him?

LARRY

We mentioned it.

SHARON

He's holding out, hah?

LARRY

You want to come?

SHARON

It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's

over ten years, and he won't let

go of it.

LARRY

You two were always head to head.

SHARON

For good reason. Remember?

LARRY

Let's just leave it.

SHARON

You're still scared of him.

(CONTINUED)

15.

LARRY

I don't think it's a good idea you

coming around here in uniform.

People see it, they think we're in

trouble here.

SHARON

Nice seeing you, too.

SHARON

Two more minutes.

KATHY

Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie

Sharon.

SHARON

Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.

LARRY JR.

Hi.

SHARON

Ow! You hurt my hand with that

grip. Whew.

(CONTINUED)

16.

KATHY

We're bringing Larry his lunch.

Hey, it's good to see you. It's

been awhile. What?

KATHY

Oh, I went boom into a low shelf

-- chasing after him of course.

(nodding to the child)

How're you doing?

SHARON

I'm semi-okay. I heard about

the... ceremony and the party.

KATHY

(embarrassed)

Oh. I hope you'll be there.

(pause)

Really.

SHARON

Take it easy.    You too, Champ.

SHARON

Oh, no. You're not breaking my

fingers again.

(CONTINUED)

17.

RAY

Break-in alarm. One suspect in --

nobody out. Take the back.

18.

ROBBY

Freeze!

SHARON

(to radio)

Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect

fleeing south on Pico Place, young

man, green jacket. No visible

weapon...

(to Robby)

Robby!

ROBBY

Right behind you!

(to man)

Stop and lie down with your

arms... shit.

ROBBY

Careful!

SHARON

I see him!

ROBBY

Citizen on your right!   Hey!

(CONTINUED)

19.

ROBBY

Gun!

SHARON

Freeze!    Right there!

ROBBY

Hey!     Wait!

RAY

You got him?

ROBBY

He was armed.

RAY

Jesus.

ROBBY

Citizen took him down.

RAY

No shit!?

(CONTINUED)

20.

RAY

What happened here?

CATCH

I... just saw it and... I saw the

gun, so...

ROBBY

You all right, Pogo?

SHARON

I was dead.   Y'know.

SHARON

He had me.    I was dead.

CATCH

I was just walking by.      I live

near here.

SANCHEZ

Sergeant's going to want to talk

to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a

statement.

RAY

Don't worry about it. That's just

procedure. Look -- we appreciate

what you did. No bullshit. Let

us buy you a drink tonight, all

right? You know where the Rib

House is?

21.

CATCH

I got you nectarines because the

peaches are hard as rocks.

ELANORA

Your jacket's all dirty.

CATCH (O.S.)

I tackled a guy.

ELANORA

Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!

CATCH (O.S.)

Why do you think?

CATCH

He had the ball. He was going for

a touchdown.

ELANORA

Can you be serious?

(CONTINUED)

22.

CATCH

(as he works)

What day is today?

ELANORA

Wednesday.

CATCH

No.

CATCH

Met somebody today.

ELANORA

Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had

the broccolini today. Thank you.

CATCH

A woman.

ELANORA

You didn't tackle her, too, did

you?

CATCH

No.

ELANORA

Good, Catch.

CATCH

She's a police officer.

ELANORA

(stops; worried)

Are you in trouble?

CATCH

No.   No trouble.

(CONTINUED)

23.

ELANORA

Well... that's a good thing.

CATCH

I saw her once a long time ago.

ELANORA

Where?

CATCH

She looks the same.

COP

Beautiful.

SANCHEZ

Yeah. My wife's got him in

agility class.

RAY

No shit.

(CONTINUED)

24.

RAY

'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who

the first person was to name a dog

'Fido,' and what the hell does it

mean?

SHARON

I like how you're always asking

the big questions, Ray.

RAY

I got a big question for you, Pogo

-- but I can only ask it when

we're alone.

SHARON

Here -- use this -- call your wife

and ask her instead.

SANCHEZ

I happen to know Ray's wife is

busy tonight.

RAY

Why doesn't your partner ever come

out with us?

SHARON

Robby's a family man.

RAY

I'm a family man.

SHARON

Yeah, but his family actually

likes him.

RAY

That Lambert -- I guess he's not

showing either.

(CONTINUED)

25.

RAY

Where are you going?

SHARON

The head.   Do you mind?

SANCHEZ

She's just gonna freshen up her

makeup.

RAY

You're wearing makeup?

SHARON

That reminds me, Ray. You still

have that eye-liner you borrowed

from me?

(CONTINUED)

26.

SHARON (O.S.)

There you are.

SHARON

We thought you wouldn't show.    Why

you sitting here?

CATCH

I don't talk to a lot of people.

Would you...?

SHARON

I didn't have a chance to thank

you. I'm Sharon Pogue.

SHARON

You look familiar.

CATCH

I guess I live on the beat you

patrol.

SHARON

Why would you do that -- jump a

man with a gun?

CATCH

(shrugs)

He was going to shoot you.

SHARON

He could've shot you. You have a

death wish? You a bungee jumper?

CATCH

No. I didn't have time to think

about it.

(CONTINUED)

27.

SHARON

What d'you think about it now?

CATCH

I figure... it was worth the risk.

SHARON

For someone you don't even know?

CATCH

Yeah -- and for what you do. I

think cops are great. Out there,

trying to keep it safe. You know?

Tough job. Firemen are

everybody's heroes. Kids wave at

firemen. People should wave at

cops. Did you ever think about

how many people are walking around

this town because you saved them?

SHARON

I never thought about it.

CATCH

... because you helped them or

because you arrested somebody who

would've hurt them or because you

just... did your job?

SHARON

Now I'm walking around this town

because of you. Ever think about

that? Maybe you should be a cop.

CATCH

I don't know... I look pretty dumb

in a hat...

CATCH

... and I don't drive and, like I

said, I don't talk to many people.

Am I talking too much? I am. You

go ahead.

SHARON

Okay. What d'you do? You

employed around here? Oh, God.

Sorry. Every time I try to talk

to somebody, it comes out like an

interrogation.

(CONTINUED)

28.

CATCH

Where do you want to be ten years

from now?

SHARON

What?

CATCH

Somebody taught that to me. Kind

of a shortcut. You ask somebody,

what are your plans for

tomorrow -- what're your dreams

for ten years from now. It's

supposed to get things started.

SHARON

Does it work?

CATCH

I never tried it.

SHARON

Bullshit.

CATCH

No. Really. I just remembered it

-- God is my witness.

SHARON

Not in here.    It's mostly cops.

SHARON

You have a nice smile.

SHARON

So... what were we talking about?

Oh, yeah, you were giving me some

line about starting a

conversation.

(CONTINUED)

29.

CATCH

The shortcut.

SHARON

Okay.    I'll play.

SHARON

Tomorrow I've got a night watch

shift. If the weather clears, in

the morning I'll go hiking. If it

rains, I'll go to the gym -- and

the laundromat. Ten years from

now... I want to be living in some

mountainous place.

CATCH

Tibet?

SHARON

Could be Tibet. Could be

Colorado. Your turn.

RAY

Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to

yourself. Come on over, Lambert,

join the group. We'll buy you

dinner, give you a medal for

saving Pogo's ass.

SHARON

Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.

I'm taking off.

CATCH

Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car.

CATCH

Thanks for the drink.

RAY

Least we could do. We don't like

her very much -- but we don't want

to lose her.

(CONTINUED)

30.

CATCH

Take care.

SHARON

It's not a great neighborhood.

Maybe I should walk you to your

car.

CATCH

I don't have a car.

SHARON

Want a ride home?

CATCH

Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.

SHARON

It's starting to rain.   Don't be a

hero.

CATCH

Yeah. If it's no trouble.

Thanks.

SHARON

Okay... ten years from now, what

d'you want to be doing?

CATCH

I don't know.    This is pretty

good.

(CONTINUED)

31.

CATCH

Can you drive okay?

SHARON

I'm not drunk. You think I'm

drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm

drunk when I'm throwing up, and I

never throw up, so don't worry

about it.

CATCH

The only time I worry is when

people tell me not to worry.

SHARON

Get in the car, will you?

CATCH

I'm on Lundy Street, just off

Pico.

SHARON

I'm good at this.

CATCH

Streets are wet.

SHARON

Are you one of those people who

drive ten miles an hour in the

rain? I hate that.

CATCH

I never drive.

CATCH

I'll be alright.

(CONTINUED)

32.

CATCH

Y'know, I can picture you in

Colorado.

SHARON

Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?

CATCH

Driving around... pissed off.

SHARON

I'm not pissed off at you.

CATCH

Give me some time.

SHARON

Those guys  in the bar are my

friends --  sort of. We work

together,  we tell jokes and we

bullshit,  but I can't say to

them...

CATCH

What?

SHARON

Every time I close my eyes, I see

that goddamn gun pointing at me

and I don't know why I'm telling

you unless it's because you were

there and because I had three

drinks, but I'm not ready to go

inside and close my eyes and I

don't want to go to your place and

I don't want to keep driving

around, so what the hell do we do?

(CONTINUED)

33.

CATCH

Whew. I feel like we're boxing,

and you've got me on the ropes.

(pause)

We'll do whatever you want.

SHARON

What I want  is to know how you

happened to  be walking by that

parking lot  at that minute. What

if you hadn' t been there?

CATCH

I guess we were supposed to meet.

SHARON

If you want -- you can come in for

a minute.

SHARON

Want a drink?

CATCH

No thanks.

SHARON

Sit down or something.

CATCH

I'm circling awhile.

SHARON

You're not supposed to look

around. I didn't have time to

straighten up.

(CONTINUED)

34.

CATCH

So... it's more real this way.

SHARON

It's rude.

CATCH

Now that I'm in here, you seem mad

about it.

SHARON

I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm

mad. I don't usually let somebody

in here, but here you are. That's

all. Let's talk about something

stupid.

CATCH

You first.

SHARON

Okay -- one thing I don't believe

is that 'supposed to' business.

We were 'supposed to' meet. That

sounds a little fringy to me, like

something you might hear on public

access TV. You believe that?

CATCH

Some people say we each give off a

particular odor -- that can only

be detected by one other person's

brain.

SHARON

So, we... smell each other?   Who

says that?

CATCH

I have no idea.

(as they smile)

I'm more in the destiny school,

we-met-in-another-life school. Do

you believe that? Do you think

when we die -- we come back in

another form?

(CONTINUED)

35.

SHARON

You mean like   a duck? No. I

think dead is   dead. I've been

thinking about   it all day -- and I

don't want to   think about it

anymore.

SHARON

Why'd you do that?

CATCH

See?   Now you're thinking about

me.

CATCH

Let me guess.       Colorado.

SHARON

It's Austria, but I can't picture

myself in Austria. I'm not good

with languages, so I couldn't

qualify for the departments over

there.

SHARON

Thanks for... coming up here.

CATCH

Does that mean I'm going?

SHARON

(flustered)

No.    You don't have to.    I...

CATCH

You okay now?

(CONTINUED)

36.

SHARON

Oh.    You're here as a medic.

CATCH

Is this the mad part?

SHARON

Maybe going is a good idea.

CATCH

Can I come back some time?

SHARON

Why?

CATCH

(shrugs)

Must be the smell.

CATCH

I better go.

SHARON

Oh, God.

37.

DRIVER

What the hell do you think you're

doing?!

DRIVER

Are you crazy?!

MAN

Hey!    Hey!   What did you do?

(CONTINUED)

38.

MAN

That's my car!     What the hell were

you doing?

CATCH

Nothing.    I just...

MAN

I saw you!    What did you take out

of there?!

CATCH

No, I rolled up the window.       It's

rain...

MAN

You take my phone?!       Hah?!

CATCH

Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!

CATCH

I helped you.

(pause)

I helped you.

CATCH

I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED)

39.

CATCH

Oh.   Sorry.

CANDACE

Shopping day?

SHARON

It's looking great, Mom.

MOTHER

(pleased)

Thanks, honey. It's the best year

ever for the impatiens. The very

best.

MOTHER

Let's go in.

(CONTINUED)

40.

SHARON

Looks the same. Still smells like

cigarettes. I thought he quit.

MOTHER

He's down to six a day.

SHARON

Your hair looks nice.

MOTHER

Are you well?

SHARON

I guess I'm well. Is this always

here?

MOTHER

Yes.   It's always there.

SHARON

Did Larry tell you I came by where

he's working? Is that why you

called me?

MOTHER

I called because we want to invite

you to our renewal of vows. It's

three weeks from Saturday.

SHARON

Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to

invite you.

MOTHER

The family.

(CONTINUED)

41.

SHARON

How come you're renewing your

vows?

MOTHER

It's sort of... a fresh start.

SHARON

Your idea?

MOTHER

No. Both of us. It's a way of...

having the marriage blessed.

SHARON

Wasn't it blessed before?

MOTHER

Sherry... of course it was

blessed. You just...

SHARON

I just what, Mom?

MOTHER

You just think about the bad, and

you never remember the good. I

wish you remembered the good.

SHARON

Sorry.  I wish I did, too.

(then, almost

like a child)

Does he? Remember any good about

me?

MOTHER

Of course. He doesn't hate you.

He just... still feels hurt.

SHARON

Hurt?    I hurt him?

MOTHER

Being arrested like that.

Somebody doesn't forget that.

SHARON

Oh? How come you forgot what he

did?

(CONTINUED)

42.

MOTHER

It wasn't as bad -- you always

make it sound worse. And it

hasn't been that way for years.

SHARON

I'm glad it hasn't been that way.

That means it worked, Mom. That

was the point. That's why I did

it. Christ. Why do I get

punished for it?

MOTHER

Honey, nobody's punishing you.

We're inviting you. Will you

come?

SHARON

Of course I'll come.

MOTHER

We didn't think you'd want to.

SHARON

Why not?

MOTHER

We don't want any trouble... on

that day. Please.

SHARON

Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't

want any trouble -- ever. I'll

come to the ceremony. I won't

come to argue, and I won't come in

uniform.

MOTHER

It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.

SHARON

I'd like you to send me an

invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's

a beautiful invitation.

MOTHER

I'll show you.

(CONTINUED)

43.

SHARON

Mom. I'd like to get one... in

the mail... from my family. Okay?

MOTHER

Yes.

SHARON

Tell Dad... thanks.

44.

SHARON

Do you have a machine?

CATCH

What?

SHARON

Do you have an answering machine?

CATCH

Yes.

SHARON

Will you hang up please, and I'll

call your machine.

CATCH

Why?

SHARON

Hi. Maybe we can... have

breakfast or something. I get up

early and run in Ballard Park.

There's a Denny's across from the

park. Like eight or so. If

you're there, you're there.

SHARON

Oh, God.

(CONTINUED)

45.

SHARON

Hi, don't pick up. Look, I didn't

sleep much and anyway this is a

bad idea. I was feeling funky

last night and I'm all right now

so let's just leave it where it's

at. Bye. Oh, thanks for the...

Bye.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHARON

Damn it!

SHARON

What?!     Who?!

CATCH (O.S.)

It's me.

SHARON

Oh, Jesus.

(CONTINUED)

46.

SHARON

I was just falling asleep.

Finally.

CATCH

We made a date.

SHARON

It wasn't a 'date.'

CATCH

Okay, an 'appointment.'     I keep my

appointments.

SHARON

I called you.    I called you at

seven.

CATCH

I get up early. I walked there.

I waited there.

SHARON

Check your messages.

SHARON

(under the sheet)

I need more sleep. Come back in a

month.

CATCH

Come back? What makes you think

I'd come back here?

SHARON

Then why are you here?

(CONTINUED)

47.

CATCH

I'm here to tell you that when you

tell someone you're going to be

somewhere then that someone

rearranges his life and you should

be more aware of that and a lot

more considerate instead of

just...

SHARON

What's in the bag?

CATCH

What?   None of your business.

SHARON

Did you bring some coffee?

CATCH

You think you deserve coffee?

SHARON

What else did you bring?   Food?

CATCH

(opening the bag)

You definitely don't deserve food.

I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener,

non-dairy...

SHARON

Just black.   Black. Thanks.

SHARON

So what kind of life did you

rearrange in order to get to

Denny's? You never said one word

about yourself last night. What

d'you do?

CATCH

What's the difference?

SHARON

What's the difference?! You're

standing in my bedroom. That's

the difference. Who are you?

(CONTINUED)

48.

CATCH

Somebody who keeps appointments.

SHARON

You're ducking. Don't duck.

(then a thought)

Oh, shit -- you're married, right?

CATCH

I'm not.

SHARON

I don't believe you.

CATCH

You don't believe me?   Give me

back the coffee.

SHARON

No.

CATCH

Give me the coffee.

SHARON

Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're

involved in some criminal

activity, aren't you? Great --

That's all I need.

CATCH

My name is Catch Lambert. I don't

work. I don't commit any crimes.

I like being with you. We can

start from here -- from now.

SHARON

Bullshit. I'm... I let you in

here. I'm not going to be some

fool. I need the details.

CATCH

And I need to start from here.

SHARON

That's ridiculous. Why?

(CONTINUED)

49.

CATCH

That's the way it is.

SHARON

Oh.   Your rules.

CATCH

My rules.

SHARON

Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't

really want to know you anyway.

Goodbye.

50.

SHARON

(sarcastic)

Can I come in?

CATCH

Yeah.   Sure.   Come in.

SHARON

You live here? Nobody lives here.

This place is some kind of front,

a scam, a drop -- or what?

CATCH

This is what you told me about --

right?

SHARON

What?

CATCH

Your interrogation.      Do I need a

lawyer?

SHARON

I just don't want to be jerked

around.

CATCH

I'm not.

SHARON

Then tell me straight out.      Who

are you?

CATCH

What is it you're looking for?

(CONTINUED)

51.

SHARON

Your life.    I don't want any

surprises.

CATCH

This is it. I sleep here. I walk

around town. That's all of it.

SHARON

That's all of it?

CATCH

Yeah. Except for you -- the way I

feel about you.

SHARON

Which is?

CATCH

Surprising.    I thought it was

impossible.    I thought I was...

SHARON

You thought you were what?       Gay?

CATCH

Dead.   In a way.

SHARON

I'm supposed to understand that?

CATCH

No. Did you ever wonder what

'scratch' meant, when people say,

'we'll start from scratch'? This

is scratch. We can start from

here.

SHARON

I don't know.    I just don't know.

52.

ELANORA

I remember that. That was a

smile.

CATCH

You know the cop -- the woman cop?

She... visited me.

ELANORA

Oh?   Where did she sit?

CATCH

I have a chair now.

ELANORA

You're... seeing her?

CATCH

She has a lot of questions.    She

wants to know everything.

ELANORA

Of course she does. Everybody

does.

CATCH

We could start from today.    What's

so wrong with that?

ELANORA

Tell her.

(CONTINUED)

53.

CATCH

Tell her what?

ELANORA

Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody.

It's been almost two years.

CATCH

(a warning)

Nora...

ELANORA

Every time I tell somebody, it

gets a little bit easier. I'm not

saying it goes...

CATCH

Nora!

ELANORA

She nice?

CATCH

She's tough.

ELANORA

She pretty?

CATCH

That doesn't matter.

ELANORA

(smiles)

She is pretty.

CATCH

She's sort of pissed-off at me.

ELANORA

Apologize.

CATCH

For what?

(CONTINUED)

54.

ELANORA

It doesn't matter. We like it

when men apologize.

CATCH

I'm sorry I yelled at you.

ELANORA

Have a cookie.     See?

SANDERMAN

Sharon...

SHARON

(typing)

Lieutenant...

SANDERMAN

Anything bothering you?

SHARON

Why?   What'd I do?

SANDERMAN

Nothing. I'm talking about your

general attitude lately.

SHARON

My attitude's fine. End of a long

day. I'm tired.

SANDERMAN

Family matters getting to you?

(CONTINUED)

55.

SHARON

Family?!

SANDERMAN

Your brother, Larry...

SHARON

What about Larry?

SANDERMAN

You know Nester -- on the Culver

City P.D.? He went out on a

violent domestic dispute

yesterday. A neighbor called it

in. It got a little ugly. No

arrest -- a warning.

SHARON

Larry.     Oh Christ.

SANDERMAN

Nester said it's not the first

time.

SHARON

Thanks for telling me.

LARRY

Jesus, you're up early.

SHARON

I wanted to catch you before you

went to work.

LARRY

I thought you were on late shifts.

SHARON

I don't sleep much. Can I come

in?

56.

LARRY

What's up?

SHARON

Where's Kath?

LARRY

She's busy with Larry Jr. right

now.

SHARON

Hey, Champ.

SHARON

Y'know, they call this one a woody

'cause it has wood on the sides.

LARRY JR.

I know.

LARRY

Why'd you come by?

SHARON

To see Kathy.

LARRY

She's not feeling good.

(CONTINUED)

57.

SHARON

I'll just say hello.

KATHY

Don't make it worse.

SHARON

It gets worse?

KATHY

He's okay now. He's torn up about

it. Don't make him mad.

SHARON

When Larry and I were growing up,

our mother said that all the time.

'Don't make your father mad.'

(pause)

Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?

KATHY

He never would.

SHARON

Oh.   Just you, huh?

LARRY

What d'you think you're doing in

my house, Shar? In my home.

SHARON

You see a pattern here, bro?

(CONTINUED)

58.

LARRY

I lost my temper. Things got out

of hand. It won't...

SHARON

People always say that: 'I've got

a temper.' Like it's an excuse.

LARRY

I don't need a goddamn lecture.

SHARON

You want to hit someone?       Next

time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar,

and you just have to hit      somebody,

you go home and hit your      father.

LARRY

You blame everything on him.

SHARON

I'm blaming you, you fucking

coward.

LARRY

You don't come in here...

LARRY

You don't come in here and call me

names.

SHARON

What do you call a man who uses

his wife as a punching bag?

(pause)

Coward.

KATHY

Don't hurt her, Lar...!

(CONTINUED)

59.

SHARON

I know how it feels, 'cause I

remember. I remember standing

between you and Dad and taking the

blows for you -- and for what?!

You turned out to be just like

him, you bastard.

(pause)

And so did I.

LARRY (V.O.)

I bet you feel real proud of

yourself, Shar, knocking me down

in front of my family. You know

what I've got in my hand? I've

got a Polaroid picture of my

busted-up face, and I'm thinking

of sending it to your department,

to your lieutenant. I'm going to

turn you in to the police, Shar,

and see how you like it.

SHARON

(quietly)

Oh, God. Oh, shit.

(CONTINUED)

60.

SHARON

It's you, right?

SHARON

Can you just shut up?    Just shut

up and listen.

CATCH

I didn't say anything.

SHARON

I don't want to talk. I don't

care if you have to play some game

and pretend you're a... 'angel of

mercy' or... whatever. I don't

care, but I don't want to hear

about it. All right? I don't

want to hear anything.

SHARON

It's a bad night.

SHARON

This is good... but I'm too tired

to stand up anymore.

SHARON

You want to kiss me?

(CONTINUED)

61.

SHARON

Kiss me someplace I've never been

kissed.

SHARON

Why do you stop? You always stop.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

PINDELLA

Catch?

CATCH

(to Sharon)

Drive, will you?

(CONTINUED)

63.

CATCH

Drive!

CATCH

Will you get off this street?

SHARON

What?       You owe him money?

CATCH

If you take a right and stop -- we

can walk from here. I'd rather

walk.

SHARON

If you're in trouble...

CATCH

I'm not.

SHARON

If you're in trouble with him,

maybe I can help.

CATCH

Forget about him. Somebody I used

to know. I don't want to know him

anymore. That's all. Forget

about it. Walk with me.

(CONTINUED)

64.

SHARON

This is not a great place to walk.

CATCH

I like it here. It's fine.

SHARON

I work here.   It's not fine.

CATCH

What's the problem?

SHARON

Besides the shootings, break-ins,

rapes, cart thefts? We've got a

loose dog raiding garbage cans,

knocking 'em over. Can't catch

him. Got somebody blowing a

trumpet between midnight and

three. Can't find him.

SHARON

You know everybody here?

CATCH

How's it goin'?

YOUNG MAN

Goin' uphill, man.

CATCH

(to Sharon)

You try it.

SHARON

Try what?

CATCH

Go ahead. We need this.

Everybody.

I feel like a jerk. I feel like a

smiley face.

OLD MAN

Mornin'.

MOM

Go on.

MOM

Move your arm!

MOM

What are you staring at?

CATCH

She feels bad 'cause you yelled at

her.

MOM

What?! Who the hell do you think

you are?

CATCH

She just needs you to smile at

her.

(CONTINUED)

66.

MOM

It's none of your business!

CATCH

Why not smile at her?   What's it

cost?

MOM

Who the hell are you to talk to

me?!

CATCH

You're so damn impatient.

WOMAN

Get away from me!

CATCH

You're so busy being pissed off,

and time is going by.

WOMAN

What?!

CATCH

It's not her fault.

WOMAN

I'm calling the police!

CATCH

No.  I'm calling the police.

(turns to Sharon)

Hey -- police.

SHARON

Jesus Christ, Catch.

CATCH

Maybe she'll think about it now.

(CONTINUED)

67.

SHARON

You had no right to do that. God!

You think you know everything?!

Who the hell are you, some expert

on raising kids?! The

neighborhood angel?! Jesus!

CATCH

No. No, I just... some people are

walking around blind...

SHARON

That's not your problem!

CATCH

Don't tell me what my problem is!

SHARON

Okay, fine -- you tell me what it

is!

CATCH

Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe

it's your problem. Maybe you're

going around blind.

SHARON

Blind to what?!

CATCH

Blind to what's going on around

you. Blind to what people need.

We're supposed to take care of

each other. We're supposed to

keep each other safe. That's the

way it should be -- if you're not

going around blind, like that

woman...

SHARON

Or like me, right? What about

you? How come you can see?

CATCH

I think I'll... walk the rest of

the way on my own.

SHARON

Yeah.    Fine.

(CONTINUED)

68.

CATCH

I'll call you later -- about the

hiking.

SHARON

I'll be out.

CATCH

Shar... wait.    Hey!

(CONTINUED)

69.

CATCH

Do we go for... symmetry? Or...

more off-center. Japanese.

CATCH

Are you into this? Bob?

LARRY

I don't want you around here.

SHARON

Let's go talk in the yard.

SHARON

You took a swing at me.

(CONTINUED)

70.

LARRY

You asked for it -- calling me a

coward. You knew I'd swing. You

think I look bad now? Look at

this.

LARRY

Nice, huh? Beautiful. The

cops'll love this, right?

Evidence. Don't you guys love

evidence?

LARRY

You wanted me to swing.

SHARON

I'm sorry I hit you so hard.

LARRY

But you're not sorry you hit me.

SHARON

Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's

face?!

LARRY

That's not your business! Nobody

called you, right? She didn't ask

for you to come here. This is my

family. You don't get it, 'cause

you've got no family. Nobody. So

you try to run everybody else's

life. Jesus Christ -- get your

own life. That's the goddam

problem. Get your own goddamn

life.

SHARON

Okay. I'm sorry I came here.       I'm

sorry I hit you. Okay?

LARRY

Okay what?

(CONTINUED)

71.

SHARON

Don't go to my department, all

right?

LARRY

Why the hell not?

SHARON

Larry...

LARRY

Why not?!

SHARON

Because the job's all I got.

LARRY

That's what I said, right?    No

life.

SHARON

That's what you said.

LARRY

And you won't come around here.

You won't call. Ever.

LARRY

And I don't want you to come to

Mom and Dad's celebration...

LARRY

Not the church. Not the party.

Stay away. I don't want you

around. I don't want to see you,

Shar.

LARRY

Go get a life.

(CONTINUED)

72.

SHARON

I got a life!

SHARON

How the hell would you know about

my life?!

LARRY

I know.

SHARON

You know nothing about me, because

you don't want to know. The

family doesn't want to know me.

Well, too bad. Sharon's got a

life. Sharon's got a boyfriend.

Sharon's going hiking in the

morning with her boyfriend. She's

not sitting alone miserable like

you want. Too bad!

CATCH

Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a

minute?!

SHARON

I thought you walked all over the

city.

(CONTINUED)

73.

CATCH

(gasping)

The city is flat. Okay? Can we

stop here? Can we examine the

view? Have a Milky Way? I've

burned every calorie I ever had.

SHARON

My favorite lunch spot is another

half mile.

CATCH

Up?!

CATCH

I'm not one of those competitive

guys, you know!

CATCH

No thanks. I can't eat and have a

heart attack at the same time.

CATCH

As soon as you get happy, you get

sad.

SHARON

I'm okay.   Everything's code four.

CATCH

Everything's what?

SHARON

Everything's fine.

CATCH

Fine? This isn't fine. I know

fine. This is something else.

Something happened yesterday.

(CONTINUED)

74.

SHARON

Yesterday -- you mean you want to

hear about it?

CATCH

Sure I do.

SHARON

No kidding. Why? You never talk

about yesterday.

CATCH

All my days are the same.

SHARON

Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we

rolled on a 415. Juliette and

Sanchez had these four guys

against a wall, but they were

H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It

got pretty jumpy, but we got them

in the car with a couple of

bruises and Robby got a sprained

wrist, so I did the rest of the

shift with a rookie who lost it

over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old

woman who'd been dead maybe six,

seven days, and I usually do all

right but the smell got to me, and

I can still smell her. Then we

arrested a prostitute working out

of her home, and I carried her

little girl out to the social

worker, and the kid was holding on

real tight and making my shoulder

wet and I wanted to punch her

rock-head mother, and then shift

ended and I had a nice visit with

my brother Larry.

CATCH

(softly)

I'm sorry. That would make

anybody sad.

SHARON

Sorry you asked?

(CONTINUED)

75.

CATCH

No.   No, you can always tell me.

SHARON

Well... I feel better now.    You

feel better?

CATCH

I feel fine.   Great.

SHARON

What are you doing?!

SHARON

Catch! There's no swimming here!

And you can't be naked in a state

park!

CATCH

Take the day off, Pogo!

SHARON

What if a park ranger comes?!

CATCH

Take your badge off for once.

Don't be such a damn Marine about

everything. Just...

(CONTINUED)

76.

CATCH

Someplace I've never been kissed.

CATCH

They tell me I was in an accident.

Long time ago.

SHARON

Looks like a bad one.

CATCH

I don't remember it.    I...

SHARON

We should be thinking about lunch.

We have to pack up.

CATCH

So soon?

SHARON

Some of us have to work.

(teasing)

You ever work?

CATCH

Yeah.     I worked.

SHARON

Oh?   You remember that?   Working?

JACK

Catch -- Jesus!

JACK

How are you? Sit down. Been

years. You been out of town?

CATCH

(sitting)

I've been around.

JACK

Oh, man, I'm really sorry about

what happened. I never got a

chance to say...

CATCH

We don't need to go there.

JACK

Okay. All right. So... what

78.

CATCH

I want my old job back.

What d'you think?

JACK

You been workin'?

CATCH

No, but I'm up to speed.

JACK

Well, it's not good with Randal

CATCH

No?

JACK

No, he's out of it, but Danny

Coley's got something going.

Wanna go see 'im?

CATCH

Finish your coffee.

SHARON

I have to check these jacket

pockets. What's your name --

SHARON

I need to unsnap this, Allison.

I'm checking your waistband. You

ALLISON

Lift your arms higher. Got a good

basketball team at St. Mark's.

You play basketball?

ROBBY

What's going on, Pogo?    You're not

happy or anything?

SHARON

Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is

shit, but I'm dating this great

dead guy.

SHARON

He says before I came along, he

thought he was dead. Sounds

better when he says it --

Don't get oil on it.

CATCH

Renewal of vows -- that's great.

Is this your parents?

SHARON

Yes. Just put it down.   I'm not

going.

CATCH

Why not?

SHARON

If I go, my brother'll hurt    me

with the department. I got     mad

and knocked him down. All     they

need is a complaint. Just     leave

it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay?

CATCH

So... he says you can't go?

SHARON

Can't you rub without talking?

(then)

It's been bad with my family a

long time, so the hell with it

anyway. If they don't want me

there, I don't want to be there.

All right?

CATCH

All right.

(then, as he works)

Bad how?

SHARON

Oh, Jesus!

(CONTINUED)

SHARON

My father used to knock us around,

all of us. But I'm the one who

called the cops -- finally.

They say I turned against the

But... they invited you.

SHARON

You don't know anything about it.

So forget it.

Well... I know about family.

SHARON

Oh, yeah?   What about it?

CATCH

It's... a door you don't close.

SHARON

I didn't close the door.

CATCH

You're closing it now. Right?

Family invites you, you go.

Family shows up, you welcome them

in. That's family.

SHARON

Oh, sure. What if they don't

deserve it?

CATCH

Then you forgive.

SHARON

You have all the answers.

CATCH

No. I just... It seems like a

chance, doesn't it? A chance to

make things right. I'd take it.

Then you tried -- y'know? And

My relationship with Mr. Lambert

is confidential.

(CONTINUED)

96.

SHARON

He's your patient. He's your

patient we... know all this. This

is police business. I'm officer

Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.

PINDELLA

Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert

but I can't tell you anything that

isn't public record.

SHARON

In general. In general.   He's

your patient, and he...

PINDELLA

He's not my patient. He walked

away from treatment. That was...

nearly a year ago.

SHARON

Why did he walk away?

PINDELLA

I can't discuss that, but if you

know how to reach him, I would

appreciate being able to talk to

him.

SHARON

(desperate)

You can help by just   telling me

what's in the public   record.

It'll take me half a   day to do a

search. Can you tell    me? Just...

SHARON

Can you please tell me what's in

the record?

PINDELLA

You were with him -- in the car.

Your uniform threw me. Are you

his friend?

(CONTINUED)

97.

SHARON

More.

PINDELLA

I can tell you he was in an

accident, hospitalized, referred

to me as an outpatient...

SHARON

What accident?

PINDELLA

A bus... a city bus hit his

vehicle. That was a couple of

years ago. It was... an awful

thing. His family was in the van.

His wife and child. His wife's

parents...

SHARON

A bus... and a van. Where?        On...

the freeway?

PINDELLA (V.O.)

I think so. Yes. Near Santa

Monica.  On the freeway. He was

severely injured but... thrown

clear.  The others were trapped in

the van.

SHARON

Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't

remember.

PINDELLA

Remember?

(CONTINUED)

98.

SHARON

(quietly)

Yes.   I was there. I was there.

PINDELLA

His wife's mother survived, but...

she was paralyzed.

PINDELLA

Elanora Chu.   She's still in town,

I believe.

SHARON

Does he... still see her?

PINDELLA

He used to. I don't know.

(pause)

I'm glad to see... he has someone

else who cares about him. I know

he's running from this. He left

all his friends, his home, his

whole life.

SHARON

He says... he doesn't remember the

accident.

PINDELLA

He lost a lot of memory. I tried

to help him with that. He

resisted. Walked away.

SHARON

I think he remembers me.

SHARON

How does he live?

PINDELLA

He received a large settlement

from the city, but he...barely

touches it. He was a professional

musician.

SHARON

Trumpet.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHARON

Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

SHARON

Why don't we... meet tomorrow?

I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet

me there? Westwood and Cole.

About two o'clock. Okay?

(CONTINUED)

100.

CUT TO:

CATCH

Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.

I...

SHARON

That's okay.

CATCH

It's hard to explain, but it's...

I'm okay now.

SHARON

You don't have to explain.

CATCH

So... why'd we meet here?

SHARON

So you're the trumpet player who

was waking people up -- on my

beat.

CATCH

I used to practice late...

outside. On my roof.

SHARON

On your roof? That's why we

couldn't find you.

(CONTINUED)

101.

CATCH

I didn't know it bothered anybody

until you mentioned it. You

arresting me?

CATCH

You going to tell me where we're

going?

(as she doesn't

answer)

That's okay. I mean... I'll go

anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of

death. The mall on a Saturday.

Just about any...

SHARON

You can trust me, you know.

SHARON

I've got you now. I'm holding on

-- like before.

CATCH

What d'you mean?

SHARON

Like I held you before.   Like I

did -- at the accident.

(CONTINUED)

102.

SHARON

What makes it so... unspeakable,

Catch? What makes it like that?

SHARON

Is it because you were driving?

SHARON

I read the reports, and it wasn't

your fault. It wasn't. Is it

because you survived and they

didn't?

SHARON

Catch. Please. Hold on, and

we'll go in there together...

SHARON

You can talk to them. You can say

goodbye or I love you or

whatever...

CATCH

This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why

are you doing this?!

SHARON

To help you.

CATCH

I don't need your help! I don't

need this. We don't need this --

we're fine...

SHARON

We're not. We're not fine, Catch.

Nothing is fine -- no matter how

much you pretend.

(CONTINUED)

103.

SHARON

You pretend that nothing happened.

You walk all over the city helping

people, but you're dying inside.

CATCH

I'm not dying! I'm not

pretending! I don't remember! I

don't remember any of it. So

leave me alone! What good does it

do? It's gone! And I'm all right

this way! Why do you have to

change it? I'm all right.

SHARON

Then walk in there.

SHARON

Walk in there, and I'll walk in

with you. Walk in there and say

it's real -- what happened is

real. Your family died.

CATCH

Don't talk about that!    Don't!

SHARON

(breaking down)

All right -- you talk about it!

You tell me your family died and I

say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and

you say, I loved them... and I

say, what an awful thing to lose a

family...

CATCH

(unravelling)

Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why

won't you stop?!

SHARON

So you can have a life!

CATCH

I have a life! We could have a

life. We could get up and go to

work and come home to each other

and never, never talk about

before. We don't need to do that!

Why do we need to do that?!

(CONTINUED)

104.

SHARON

Because it happened! Because it's

the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so

sorry it happened, but...

CATCH

Nothing happened! If we say it,

then that's the truth, that can be

the truth. Say it. Nothing

happened. Say it, Shar.

SHARON

Catch -- take my hand.    Please.

CATCH

Say it!    I'm asking you to say it.

SHARON

I can't.

CATCH

Why not?

SHARON

Because I want it too much. I

want everything with you. I want

all of you -- not just the part

that isn't hiding and running

away...

CATCH

Why are   you pushing so hard? Why

does it   have to be your way? Why

does it   have to be your truth?

This is   who I am! This is the way

I am!

SHARON

Not anymore. It doesn't have to

be this way anymore because you're

not alone -- because we're the

family now. We can be the

family...

CATCH

You like to push people, don't

you? You just have to push and

shove and make it right for you --

for you. You push everybody,

Shar. You even pushed your family

away, didn't you?

(CONTINUED)

105.

SHARON

I just... want to say...

CATCH

You already said it.   You said it

all.

SHARON

When you're ready, I'll be there

for you. I just want to say that.

RAY

Rib House after shift today?

4:30?

ROBBY

I think I'll head home.

(CONTINUED)

106.

RAY

Pogo?   Bring your friend.

SHARON

No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.

RAY

Gotta have that meat to keep your

strength up.

SHARON

How come it's not working for you?

SHARON (V.O.)

Catch.  Can you... pick up?

(pause)

Will you call me?

107.

ROBBY

Pogo...?

SHARON

Which store is it?

ROBBY

The little market there. They

came through a back window last

night. Mostly vandalism...

SHARON

Whoa...

SKATER

Sorry!

WORRIED MOTHER

Oh, God, thank you. Billy!

ROBBY

Pogo?

(CONTINUED)

108.

SHARON

There's something I have to do.    I

need an address and phone.

ROBBY

What's the name?

SHARON

Elanora Chu.

ROBBY

Let's do it.

ELANORA (O.S.)

Pogo?

SHARON

I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all

about the...

ELANORA

Elanora.

SHARON

I'm sorry for... what happened.     I

know about the accident.

ELANORA

(hopeful)

He told you?!

(CONTINUED)

109.

SHARON

No. I found out, and... I

remembered. I was there.

ELANORA

Oh.   Yes.

SHARON

I guess he comes here a lot -- to

talk to you.

ELANORA

He shops for me. Twice a week.

SHARON

Oh. And when he comes here -- he

never mentions the past, never

talks about the accident?

ELANORA

No.

SHARON

And you... let him do that?    All

this time? Why?

ELANORA

It's what he needs.

SHARON

Walking all over the city like...

ELANORA

Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man.

SHARON

But... you let him get so lost.

ELANORA

I let him find his own way through

it. Why did you come here,

Sharon?

SHARON

Because... I want to know how to

help him.

ELANORA

You are helping him.

(CONTINUED)

110.

SHARON

I don't think so.

ELANORA

Why not?

SHARON

He... he was paying me back, I

guess, for the accident, for

helping him. That's why he

felt... so close to me. But...

ELANORA

Is that what you think?

SHARON

But now he probably hates me.

I...

ELANORA

What happened?

SHARON

I took him to the cemetery, and...

ELANORA

The cemetery!

SHARON

I thought it might help him...

come back, you know? But he

wouldn't even go in. He screamed

at me.

ELANORA

(upset)

What made you take him there?

SHARON

For the truth...

ELANORA

He knows the truth.

SHARON

But he won't even say it, or...

(CONTINUED)

111.

ELANORA

That's his way. That's his way

through all this. He made a wall

-- around that whole day, that

night -- other things, too. He

keeps them behind the wall -- his

little boy, my daughter. He can't

help it. The cemetery?! Do you

know how hard it is for me to go

to the cemetery? Can you imagine?

ELANORA

That's where it stares you in the

face -- the loss. And it's too

much sometimes.

ELANORA

See? I'm still finding my way

through it. And Catch -- it

almost kills him to think about it

or say it or drive a car or see

the place where it happened or...

go by the cemetery.

SHARON

I was trying to help him... come

back to some kind of life. I...

ELANORA

But he was coming back. Do you

realize how much he changed in the

past weeks? His apartment, his

life, his music is coming back.

He fell in love! He even got a

job, Sharon -- for you. For the

two of you. Isn't that coming

back? Why do you have to rush?

Everybody has to rush these days.

SHARON

I was scared. I push so hard...

when I'm scared.

ELANORA

Scared of what?

(CONTINUED)

112.

SHARON

Losing him. So I did. I lost

him. He won't talk to me. I... I

didn't know what I was doing.

ELANORA

You were finding your way.    What

else can we do? You think    I'm

always sure what to say to   him,

what not to say? I do what    I

think is right and hope he   sees

the love in it.

ELANORA

Look at you -- so worried now, so

miserable. That's the love in it.

SHARON

Did I... make it worse for him?

ELANORA

I don't know. I really don't.

But I think he'll see the love in

what you did.

SHARON

I just came by to... wish you

well. To... congratulate you and

wish you well. Shit.

CATCH

Annie. Chet. I don't... want you

to think I forgot about you. It's

just that I... I couldn't find

you.

(pause)

I woke up, and you were gone.

Everything was gone. It all

just... disappeared. In one

minute. I couldn't remember that

minute. I lost it. It took me so

long to find it. I think I found

it all now. I used a calculator.

I did. I figured it out. You

know... we get about 1400 minutes

a day and so I figured it out. I

was 33 years old and three months

and eight days, so it was... I've

got it here...

CATCH

It was minute number 17 million

eight hundred ten thousand, two

hundred... or so.

CATCH

That's the one I lost. And...

when I lost that minute, I guess I

tried to lose it all, all the

memories -- because they hurt. I

tried, but... I couldn't do it.

116.

CATCH

Chet... you weren't feeling so

good, remember? It was your

birthday, and you ate too much.

CATCH

And, Annie, you said... you

said...

ANNIE

Slow down in the rain, all right?

CATCH

And I don't know if I slowed down.

I don't know. I hope I did,

but... I didn't always listen. I'm

sorry. I'm really sorry.

CATCH

... You put him on your lap, and

he looked at me, and I made a

face. Remember? I made you

smile, Chet.

CATCH (CONT'D)

And then we all smiled, and it was

a great minute. It was. I'm

really glad... I found that

minute. No matter what.

you.

You coming to the party?

Sure.

Big police officer now.

Not so big.

Nice dress.

Larry...

LARRY

How did you have the guts to walk

into a church after breaking your

word?

SHARON

I have to be here. It's a chance

to make things right, and I'm

taking it.

LARRY

Why even talk go me? You got what

you wanted. You laugh about it?

You tell your cop friends how

you...

SHARON

You think I talk about it?!    You

Here, Lar.

Don't make him talk about...

anything today.

SHARON

Mom, I was going to fix his tie.

His tie is crooked.

SHARON

It was a nice ceremony.

MOTHER

(worried)

Yes. We're running out of

chicken, though. Nobody's eating

the ham.

SHARON

It's a great party, Mom.   You look

happy.

SHARON

Thirty-five years and still in

love, huh?

MOTHER

You think that's wrong, don't you?

SHARON

Of course not...

(CONTINUED)

121.

MOTHER

I always... I feel like

apologizing to you. But I love

him.

SHARON

I know.

MOTHER

And then I feel like apologizing

to him for loving you. I'm the

one in the middle. I'm the only

one in this family who knows how

to forgive anybody.

BOTH

You look great.

KATHY

Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.

SHARON

Sorry about that, but... I

couldn't stand him doing that to

you. I took it on...

KATHY

Don't worry. I'm not your mother.

If he tries it again, I'm gone.

I'm out of there, me and Larry

Junior. He knows that.

122.

SHARON

What's up with you?

LARRY JR.

They won't let me watch T.V.

SHARON

Oh. Well... let's pretend this is

T.V. It's a show about a party.

SHARON

(as if it's a secret)

That man... is really a super

hero.

LARRY JR.

Is not.

SHARON

Is too. And so is she. Look.

See? Red tights under her

dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her

a drink with something in it.

LARRY JR.

With what?

SHARON

With stuff to make her sleep.

He's a bad guy.

LARRY

She drank it.

SHARON

Watch. She'll fall down any

minute.

LARRY

Hey, sport, you should go play

outside.

LARRY

Stay away from my family.

LARRY

Hey, everybody, keep it down.

Somebody might call the police.

What're you doing?

LARRY

Once the cops leave, we can really

party.

LARRY

Why don't you give everybody a

break -- and go home?

SHARON

Don't walk away. Okay?

What?

SHARON

Is it working?     Do you need to

check it?

FATHER

It's fine.

Dad...

LARRY

What the hell are you doing?!

Sharon, please.

SHARON

Please? Please what?! Will you

stop protecting him? You were

always protecting him! Don't talk

father!

SHARON

I'm going to bother you for one

minute, Dad. Okay? Can you

handle that?

LARRY

Just get the hell out...

This isn't about you, Larry -- or

SHARON

How about you, Dad. Do you want

me to leave?

FATHER

Up to you.

SHARON

Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome

FATHER

Jesus -- you're here, aren't you?

What d'you want?

SHARON

I want to know!

Do you want me here? Do you love

me, Dad? I want to know.

SHARON

Do you... need to... check that

I feel like...

SHARON

What, Dad?   You feel like what?

I feel like I don't have a

Well... you do. It's a shame

you're going to miss knowing her.

You're going to miss all that.

SHARON

I'm next.

SHARON

(to camera)

Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.

SHARON

Y'know... being in this house

reminds me of something.  I was

about ten, I guess, and Larry and

I were playing aliens -- remember,

Lar? We're making a lot  of noise,

and Dad comes home from work tired

and pissed off...

SHARON

We're yelling like mad, and Dad

bursts into the room and says,

what the hell are you doing? And

I'm scared. I'm really scared.

SHARON (CONT'D)

And I say, we're playing alien

invasion, Dad, and he says, oh,

yeah, I'll show you a damn

invasion, and he picks me up,

picks me up off the floor and

throws me on the couch. I hit

that couch and bounce off, and he

grabs Larry and throws him on the

couch, and then... then he starts

making these monster sounds, and

he says, we came to earth to kick

ass, and I run at him and jump on

him and he tosses me on the couch

and then Larry, and we're laughing

so hard I almost wet myself, and

he keeps tossing us and growling

and beeping, and it was... it was

great. It was great, and I'm

never going to forget that.

Never. And I miss that. I miss

it. So I just... I wanted to tell

you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.

That's all.

Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.

Was it bad?

They don't like me in there.

SHARON

That's a nice thing to say.

CATCH

It's not a thing to say.   It's the

truth.

CATCH

Why do you try so hard not to cry?

SHARON

It's not fair.

SHARON

It's not fair. Things got better

Things got better, and I'd still

do it. I'd do it all over again.

And it's not fair they shut me

out. It's not.

CATCH

No.

SHARON

It's not fair. I was     19, and I

didn't know what else    to do. I

It's not fair I don't    have a

family anymore.

No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.
