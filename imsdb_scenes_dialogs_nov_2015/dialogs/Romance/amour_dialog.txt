PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE

(to the superintendent and the

NEIGHBOR)

Wait Outside please.

POLICE OFFICER

(to the superintendent, pointing to

a pile of mail)

What's the date of the last letter?

SUPERINTENDENT

(VERIFYING)

The 16th from what I can see...

Wait...

PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE

(to the fire officer)

Can you try?

FIREMAN (O.S.)

The door is open.

2.

JANITOR

...no as far as I know. During the

whole time, they had a nurse, but

it's been a while since I last saw

her. My wife has been...

PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE

(to the firemen who are now curious

enough to come and stand by the

DOOR)

Did you open the windows?

3.

GEORGES

They used a screwdriver or

something like that...it doesn't

look very professional...

ANNE

But who would do something like

that?

GEORGES

No idea. Why do people break in?

Because they want to steal

something.

ANNE

From us?

GEORGES

(laughs briefly out loud)

Hey, why not? If I thought about

it, I could come up with at least

three or four people we know who've

been burgled.

4.

ANNE

What time is it? Can't we call the

superintendent?

GEORGES

I'll do that tomorrow morning.

Anyway, they didn't see anything.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Don't let it spoil your good mood

now.

ANNE

Or the police?

GEORGES

Come on, give me your coat.

ANNE

Imagine if we were here, in our

beds, and someone broke in.

GEORGES

Why should I imagine that?

ANNE

But it's terrible! I think I'd die

of fright.

GEORGES

(LAUGHING)

So would I.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Shall we have a drink?

ANNE

I'm tired.

GEORGES

I still fancy a drink.

5.

ANNE (O.S.)

Go ahead then. Mathilde told me

that in her building, the attic

apartment was burgled from the

loft. They just knocked a hole in

the wall, cut out all of the

valuable pictures from their frames

and disappeared without a trace.

GEORGES

They must have been professionals.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Did I tell you, you looked good

tonight?

ANNE (O.S.)

(FLATTERED)

What's got into you?

PAUSE:

ANNE (CONT'D)

Weren't those semiquavers in the

presto incredible? What staccato!

Don't you agree?

GEORGES (O.S.)

You're proud of him, huh?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Something wrong?

ANNE

No.

6.

GEORGES

(on the phone)

What about next week? No but still,

it would make sense to get it done

soon. It might give people silly

ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to

look at... Wednesday? What time?

OK... Will you bring the paint with

you too, to paint over it? But at

least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank

you.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(TO ANNE)

You can depend on that guy.

ANNE

(who comes back to the table with

the egg) I hope so. The last time,

he kept us waiting for ages, if you

remember.

GEORGES

(laughs while acquiescing)

Yes, that's true. (Reacting when

she places the egg in his egg cup)

Thanks. If I call a regular

professional, we'll still be

waiting two months time.

ANNE

(more to herself)

Really?

7.

GEORGES

The Frodons waited three days when

their toilet was blocked. Not

exactly pleasant.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

The saltcellar is empty.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I don't know if he's going to bring

us the CD. Maybe he won't come at

all. In any case, he didn't mention

it. I'd like to buy it. It was

really good and I don't want to

wait long for it. We could go to

Virgin this afternoon and buy it.

What do you say?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

What's going on? What's the matter?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(serious now) Anne! What's going

on?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anne, what's the matter?

8.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anne...what's...

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anne...

SILENCE

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(close to tears)

Anne...Darling...please!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anne?

ANNE

What are you doing?

ANNE (CONT'D)

You left the water running.

9.

GEORGES

(both aghast and furious)

Hey, what's going on? Are you

completely crazy? Is this supposed

to be a joke, or what's going on?

ANNE

What did you say?

GEORGES

(SERIOUSLY)

Is this a joke? Is this meant to be

a joke?

ANNE

What joke? I don't get it! Why are

you talking to me like that? What's

got into you?

GEORGES

Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's

not funny.

ANNE

(GETTING IRRITATED)

What game, for Christ's sake? What

on earth's the matter?!!

GEORGES

What's the matter? Why didn't you

react?

ANNE

To what?

GEORGES

To what? To me, to everything.

ANNE

When?

10.

GEORGES

Just now. A moment ago.

ANNE

Please tell me what's wrong. What

am I supposed to have done?

GEORGES

I don't know what to say. Do you

really not know what just happened?

ANNE

But what DID happen?

GEORGES

(almost reluctantly bowing his head

as he speaks) You were sitting

there, staring at me. You didn't

answer me when I asked you what the

matter was.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I put this tea towel on your face,

and you didn't react.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Look... There's still dampness on

your collar.

ANNE

When... When was it?

GEORGES

Just now, a few minutes ago.

ANNE

So...??

GEORGES

There's no "So". I went into the

bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to

get help.

11.

ANNE

Help?

GEORGES

Yes, and then you turned off the

tap.

ANNE

Yes. Because you left it on.

SILENCE

ANNE (CONT'D)

I don't understand.

GEORGES

Neither do I.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Don't you think it's best if I call

Dr. Bertier?

ANNE

Why? What can he do?

GEORGES

I don't know. Examine you.

ANNE

I'm fine. There's nothing wrong

with me.

GEORGES

Anne, please!! That's absurd. We

can't pretend that nothing

happened.

ANNE

But what DID happen?

ANNE (CONT'D)

I'm here. I'm having my breakfast,

and you're telling me things

happened that I don't understand.

GEORGES

Can you explain how the tea towel

got there?

12.

ANNE

(IRRITATED)

No, I can't!

GEORGES

Who turned on the tap?

ANNE

You did!

GEORGES

Can you remember that?

ANNE

(more and more desperate, close to

tears) No I can't! Do you want to

torture me? Leave me in peace!

GEORGES

Don't you think it would be better

to fetch Dr. Bertier?

ANNE

No!

SILENCE

EVA

You know how he is. Once he's got

something into his head, he has to

go through with it. In the end,

everybody was delighted. And

besides, it didn't hurt our

financial situation. We're playing

until the 28th.

(MORE)

13.

EVA (CONT'D)

Then we have 10 days to rest, then

we go to Stockholm for four days,

and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven

knows where that is. At the North

Pole. But Geoff's already been

there few times, and he loves it.

We're playing the "Dowland

Transcriptions" there and then

we're back in London.

GEORGES

What about the children?

EVA

Liz is at boarding school and John

is living his own life. He's twenty-

six years old.

GEORGES

What does he do?

EVA

He's a student. We rarely see him.

He's got his own ideas. Life Geoff.

They don't really get along. Geoff

wants to advise him on everything,

and John doesn't like that at all.

GEORGES

Is he good?

EVA

I think so. He's less impulsive.

Very industrious.

GEORGES

That sounds rather derogatory.

EVA

No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet,

but stubborn. I think he'll do all

right. At the last Conservatory

concert, he played the solo part in

the Haydn Concerto. It was very

good. Geoff was there and

congratulated him at the end.

GEORGES

And you?

EVA

What do you mean?

14.

GEORGES

Did you both make up?

EVA

(with a little laugh)

My God, you know him, don't you?

Over the winter, he suddenly

discovered his passion for a viola

player who'd been in our ensemble

for years. What can I tell you? It

was a huge drama, and the poor

little darling wound up trying to

commit suicide. That scared him and

he came back to me in full remorse.

I've got used to it now. What's a

bit embarrassing is that the

ensemble, you can't keep any

secrets from anyone.

GEORGES

Do you love him?

EVA

Yes, I think so.

EVA (CONT'D)

What's aphasia?

GEORGES

What can I say? The carotid artery

was blocked. They did an ultrasound

scan, two in fact, and they said

they had to operate on her. She was

scared. She was confused and

scared. You know she has always

been afraid of doctors. They said

the risk was very low and that if

they didn't operate, she'd be

certain to have a serious stroke.

EVA

And what do they say now?

GEORGES

Just that it didn't go well. It's

one of the 5% that go wrong.

15.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

It's pretty upsetting.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Usually at this time, I take a nap.

My blood sugar is somewhere down in

my socks.

EVA

I'm so sorry.

GEORGES

Yeah.

EVA

What can I do for you?

GEORGES

Nothing. It was nice of you to come

despite all of your stress.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

No, really. There's nothing you can

do. We'll see how things go when

she's back here in the apartment.

We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a

caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage

on my own. We'll see. We've been

through quite a lot in our time,

your mother and I.

(LITTLE LAUGH)

All this is still a bit new.

EVA

(with a little laugh)

It's funny. I don't know if I

should say it. Maybe it'll

embarrass you. But when I came here

a short while ago, I suddenly

remembered how I always used to

listen to the two of you making

love when I was little.

(MORE)

16.

EVA (CONT'D)

For me, at the time, it was

reassuring. It gave me a feeling

that you loved each other, and that

we'd always be together.

GEORGES

Here. Thank you very much. It's for

both of you. You can just put the

things down here. There, beside the

window, right. We'll be okay on our

own. Thanks a lot.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(to the superintendent)

Thank you, Mr. Mery.

SUPERINTENDENT

If you need anything, just call

downstairs. If we can help at

all...

GEORGES

Right now everything's fine. I'll

let your wife know as soon as we

need anything.

SUPERINTENDENT

(TO ANNE)

It's nice to have you back, Mrs.

Laurent.

ANNE

Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank

you.

17.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Yes, thanks.

SUPERINTENDENT

Yes... So... Goodbye then, ma'am.

Welcome home again. Goodbye, Sir.

GEORGES

Goodbye, Mr. Mery.

SUPERINTENDENT

Goodbye.

GEORGES

(with a nervous smile)

Where do you want...

ANNE

In the living room.

GEORGES

Shall I make some tea?

ANNE

(with a faint smile)

First come sit with me.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Can you help me into the chair?

GEORGES

(EAGERLY)

Of course.

18.

ANNE

It's best if you put my arm around

your neck and your right arm around

me, that way it'll be easy.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Thanks.

GEORGES

(softly almost to himself)

I'm glad you're back.

ANNE

(in a voice just as soft)

Me too.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Promise me one thing.

GEORGES

What?

ANNE

Please never take me back to the

hospital.

GEORGES

What?

19.

ANNE

You promise?

GEORGES

Anne...

ANNE

You promise?

GEORGES

Anne, I...

ANNE

Don't talk right now. And don't

give me any lectures. Please.

GEORGES

What can I say, it's...

ANNE

(INTERRUPTING HIM)

Nothing. Just don't say anything.

OK?!

GEORGES

There.

ANNE

Thank you. Thank you, Darling.

GEORGES

Everything OK?

ANNE

(SMILING)

Everything's fine.

20.

ANNE (CONT'D)

You don't have to hold my hand all

the time now. I can look after

myself, you know.

ANNE (CONT'D)

And don't feel guilty. That would

be pointless. And a drag. For me

too.

GEORGES

I don't feel guilty.

ANNE

That's good.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Go over there now. I'm not a

cripple. You can easily leave me

alone for two minutes. I won't

collapse.

GEORGES

(with a slight smile)

OK.

ANNE

Did you buy the new book on

Harnoncourt?

GEORGES

I've already read it.

ANNE

And?

GEORGES

Do you want it? I'll get it for

you.

ANNE

Sure.

21.

GEORGES (O.S.)

I don't know where I put it.

ANNE

Don't worry. It isn't that

important.

GEORGES (O.S.)

Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in

the... Just a moment! Viola! Here

you are! Nothing like an infallible

memory!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I thought I'd left it over there in

the other room, but I'd already put

it away. Tidy people just can't

help being tidy.

ANNE

(taking the book)

Thanks.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Right now, take care of yourself.

And don't wait to see how I hold

the book in my hand, OK?

GEORGES

OK.

22.

SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE

Unfortunately the strawberries were

already moldy. I'll go and get you

some fresh ones tomorrow from the

market. My husband will bring you

the bottled water this afternoon.

I'm not supposed to carry anything

heavy: my back, you know...

GEORGES

Sure, no problem.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

It came to 76 euros and 40 cents.

There's the till receipt and here's

your change: 23 euros 60.

GEORGES

Thank you very much. Keep the

change. Thanks.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

Thank you, sir.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)

Well, I'll be off. Call me if you

need anything else.

GEORGES

Yes. I will.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

Is your wife well? ...

GEORGES

Yes, she's OK. She's recovering.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

Fine. Give her my regards. My

husband and I are very glad she's

back.

GEORGES

Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. Mery,

thanks so much.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE

Goodbye, sir.

23.

SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)

I'll bring you the strawberries

tomorrow around noon, if that suits

you.

ANNE (O.S.)

There. Can you come in, please?

GEORGES

... some banal romance or other

about a nobleman and a lower middle-

class girl who couldn't have each

other and who then, out of sheer

magnanimity, decide to renounce

their love - in fact I don't quite

remember it any more. In any case,

afterwards I was thoroughly

distraught, and it took me a bit of

time to calm down. In the courtyard

of the house where grandma lived,

there was a young guy at the window

who asked me where I'd been. He was

a couple of years older than me, a

braggart who of course really

impressed me. "To the movies", I

said, because I was proud that my

grandma had given me the money to

go all alone to the cinema.

(MORE)

24.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

"What did you see?" I started to

tell him the story of the movie,

and as I did, all the emotion came

back. I didn't want to cry in front

of the boy, but it was impossible;

there I was, crying out loud in the

courtyard, and I told him the whole

drama to the bitter end.

ANNE

So? How did he react?

GEORGES

No idea. He probably found it

amusing. I don't remember. I don't

remember the film either. But I

remember the feeling. That I was

ashamed of crying, but that telling

him the story made all my feelings

and tears come back, almost more

powerfully than when I was actually

watching the film, and that I just

couldn't stop.

ANNE

That's cute. Why didn't you ever

tell me before?

GEORGES

There are still a few stories you

don't know.

ANNE

Aha...? Don't tell me you're going

to ruin your image in your old age?

GEORGES

(GRINNING)

You bet I won't. But what is my

image?

ANNE

(TENDERLY)

Sometimes you're a rotter. But

you're nice.

GEORGES

(EMBARRASSED GRIN)

Can I take you for a drink?

25.

ANNE

Listen to this! My horoscope.

Motto: You have lots of verve, but

need to be more serious!

Love: High-class conversation is

what you need.

Work: You're motivated again. But

proceed with care.

Health: Loosen up by doing

exercises. It'll give you renewed

pizzazz.

GEORGES

(GOOD-HUMORED)

You've only yourself to blame if

you read stuff like that.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's

funeral.

ANNE

You have to go.

GEORGES

I fear I must. I don't want to go

at all.

ANNE

Who does like going to funerals?

GEORGES

Oh, I know a few people who do.

Annette can never wait to get all

dolled up again. And Francois

has...

26.

ANNE

You're mean. What would you say if

no one came to your funeral?

GEORGES

(dryly) Nothing, presumably.

ANNE

Have you talked to Jeanne since I

was in the hospital? I mean, does

she know I can't come?

GEORGES

Of course.

ANNE

What did she say?

GEORGES

She was shocked.

ANNE

How?

GEORGES

(a bit irritated)

My God, what are people like when

they're shocked? She couldn't

believe it, she was speechless. I

don't remember any more. In any

case, not exactly. I've spoken to a

lot of people since.

ANNE

Sorry.

GEORGES

No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be

unkind, but I just don't see the

point of talking about it all the

time.

ANNE

Do I talk about it all the time?

27.

GEORGES

No. Sorry.

ANNE

Don't worry.

GEORGES

What ... ?!

ANNE

(once she's seated in the

WHEELCHAIR)

Why are you back already? What time

is it?

ANNE (CONT'D)

(SOFTLY)

Forgive me, I was too slow.

GEORGES

Anne...

ANNE

Can you wheel me into the living

room?

GEORGES

Yes.

28.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

You're always good at surprises.

ANNE

Yes. Why are you home earlier?

GEORGES

I didn't come home earlier. I took

a taxi. In August, there isn't a

lot of traffic.

ANNE

That's true. How was the funeral?

GEORGES

Anne...!

ANNE

How was it, go on, tell me!

GEORGES

It was rather bizarre. The priest

was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's

co-workers made a speech that was

embarrassingly emotional. His old

secretary came with a radio-

cassette player and after the

speech she put on "Yesterday" by

the Beatles. You can't imagine.

Everybody turned round to look at

her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.

His grandchildren were there. Of

course they giggled as soon as the

music began. Then the urn was put

on a huge stretcher that was

obviously designed for a coffin,

and out we went into the rain. They

placed the urn on a small electric

cart that crawled along for what

seemed like an eternity to the tiny

hole they had dug. A lot of people

had to stifle their laughter. It

must have been terrible for Jeanne.

I have...

29.

ANNE

(INTERRUPTING HIM)

There's just no point in going on

living. I know it can only get

worse. Why should I inflict it on

us? On you and me.

GEORGES

You're not inflicting anything on

me.

ANNE

You don't have to lie, Georges.

GEORGES

Imagine you were me. Didn't you

ever think something like this

could happen to one of us?

ANNE

Of course I did. But imagination

and reality have little in common.

GEORGES

But things are getting better every

day. We'll...

ANNE

(INTERRUPTING HIM)

Georges, I don't want to carry on.

You're making such efforts to make

everything easier for me. But I

don't want to go on. For my own

sake. Not yours.

GEORGES

I don't believe you. I know you.

You think you're a burden on me.

But what if things were the other

way around? What would you do then?

ANNE

I don't know. I can't be bothered

to think about being you. I'm

tired. You tire me. Everything

tires me. I can't talk. I want to

go to bed.

30.

GEORGES

(somewhat perplexed, but pleased)

Oh hello! Nice to see you.

SOLOIST

Forgive me for dropping in on you

like this, Professor. I tried to

reach you by phone a couple of

times, but no luck.

GEORGES

I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone

when I've stored the caller's

number and I can see who's calling.

Why didn't you leave a message?

Anyway, do come in...

SOLOIST

I just couldn't manage to come by

after the concert. I was so sorry,

because I was so pleased you came

along.

GEORGES

Come with me.

SOLOIST

... And now, an unexpected

opportunity has arisen because

Francois Mitry called me - you know

him, he's my agent - to say he'd

arranged for me to meet the boss of

the Theatre des Champs-Elysees

tonight to talk about their new

concert series.

(MORE)

31.

SOLOIST (CONT'D)

So I flew to Paris this morning,

and while I was in my hotel, I

thought, I'll just give it a try

and drop in. After all, it's

virtually just around the corner.

SOLOIST (CONT'D)

Isn't she at home?

GEORGES

Yes, she is. I'll go and get her in

a minute. Have a seat.

SOLOIST

I hope I'm not disturbing you too

much.

GEORGES

No, not at all. I'm happy that you

came. We were so thrilled by your

concert. We hoped we'd see you

again soon. Please do have a seat.

Can I can get you something? A cup

of tea?

SOLOIST

No, no, thank you very much.

GEORGES

Hold on, I'll just freshen up the

flowers; in this heat they wilt so

fast...

SOLOIST

I've only just bought them. They

should keep quite...

32.

ANNE

Martin! What a delight. How lovely

to see you!

SOLOIST

Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you

too.

ANNE

Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself

down and don't look so shocked.

ANNE (CONT'D)

I'm so proud of you. We were both

in raptures after your concert.

Georges wanted to buy your new CD

the very next morning.

SOLOIST

Oh God! I wanted to bring you the

CD, but I left in such a hurry that

I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get

one today and drop it by.

ANNE

(SMILING)

No, no, don't worry. We want to

make a contribution to your

success. Even if it's only twenty

euros.

SOLOIST

You've already contributed so much.

I owe you so much, Madame.

ANNE

You owe it to your hard work and

your talent.

SOLOIST

(shaking his head a little) Do you

remember, when you first gave me

the Bagatelles to play? I was

twelve at the time, and in my

youthful arrogance I said: "But why

the Bagatelles?" And you really

gave me a piece of your mind.

33.

SOLOIST (CONT'D)

So what happened?

ANNE

My right side is paralyzed, that's

all. It can happen when you get

older.

SOLOIST

And how...?

ANNE

Let's talk about something else,

shall we?

SOLOIST

(DISCONCERTED)

Sure ...

ANNE

Don't be offended. But I want to

enjoy the lovely interlude you've

given us with your visit.

SOLOIST

(DISARMED)

Of course.

GEORGES

You haven't told us yet what's been

going on since the Paris concert.

SOLOIST

Well, actually I've spent most of

the time in London studying. Then I

went to Copenhagen for two

performances, that was Schubert

too. My whole life revolves around

Schubert at the moment. The

concerts with the Impromptus and

the Moments Musicaux, and for my

bread-and-butter work I'm

developing the sonatas. Not the

late ones, I think I still need a

couple more years for those.

34.

ANNE

Could you do me a favor?

SOLOIST

(SURPRISED)

Really?

ANNE

Would you play Fur Elise?

SOLOIST

(EMBARRASSED)

Um, I don't know if I remember it

very well. Beethoven, it's been a

long time since I've... But if you

want...

ANNE

Give it a try.

SOLOIST

(HESITANTLY)

OK.

ANNE

What's the matter?

LIVING ROOM

35.

GEORGES

(shocked, and hence furious)

Good God, what are you doing?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Have you lost your senses?! I don't

believe it! How stupid!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Look at that! Did you need to do

that? Can't you call me when you

need something?

ANNE

(meekly) I'm sorry.

GEORGES

(STILL FURIOUS)

Yes, so am I.

ANNE

(SOFTLY)

Sorry.

GEORGES

The lamp is broken too.

36.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Yes? Who's there?

HIM:

ANNE

Georges? What's going on? Who is

it?

ANNE (CONT'D)

Georges? What's going on?

ANNE'S VOICE:

Georges, what's going on?

ANNE'S VOICE

Calm down will you! There's nothing

there. It's nothing.

ANNE

What was it?

GEORGES

(still with labored breathing)

I didn't understand... I thought

I'd gone mad... It was something

impossible...

ANNE

What was?

GEORGES

Eva. They're coming on the 12th.

ANNE

Why?

GEORGES

No idea. Apparently she's coming

with Geoff.

ANNE

When is it?

38.

GEORGES

I don't know exactly. What day is

it today? I'll go and look.

ANNE

I don't want that.

GEORGES

What?

ANNE

Geoff doesn't need to come.

ANNE (CONT'D)

I don't need any comments on my

predicament. I can only take his

British humor in small doses.

ANNE:

GEORGES

Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur

Laurent, it was beautiful and yet

sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes

that things will get better.

With deep gratitude, your former

pupil, Martin.

ANNE

Stop the CD.

39.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Where are the family albums?

GEORGES

The family albums? I don't know,

there, in the other room. Why?

ANNE

Can you get them for me?

GEORGES

What, now?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Why, Anne?

ANNE

I'd like to look at them.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Please!

ANNE (CONT'D)

Thanks.

GEORGES

(a bit irritated)

You're welcome.

ANNE

That's nice.

GEORGES

(self-consciously, softly)

What?

40.

ANNE

Life...so long... What a long

life...

ANNE (CONT'D)

Stop watching me.

GEORGES

(caught in the act)

I wasn't watching you.

ANNE

Of course you were. I'm not that

dumb yet.

GEORGES

You're soaked through.

ANNE

What do you mean?

GEORGES

Hold on.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I'll be right back.

41.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

It's no big deal. Come on.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Come on, darling. It's nothing

serious. Things like that happen..

ANNE

(SOBBING)

I can't... take it any more.

GEORGES

My love. My darling.

EVA

... thinking about whether it

wouldn't be better to invest the

money in an apartment block. If

inflation gets going again,

property is the only sure thing.

Right now, savings accounts pay

1.75% at best. Four years ago,

Geoff bought some stocks with a

small sum of money and the whole

thing collapsed. So now we're

obviously worried. Unfortunately,

in the meantime, other people have

had the same idea, and property

prices are going through the roof.

Since we came back from

Scandinavia, I spend all my spare

time looking through newspaper ads.

EVA (CONT'D)

It takes time, that's all. We'll

find something in the end.

42.

ANNE

(slowly) Yes yes I have... I

have... the grandmother... woman

with house... not... the house then

... money

EVA

I don't understand you, I'm afraid.

ANNE

... yes... now... it's all... house

sel... sel... sel... was... in two

strokes of... so quickly... god

it's hard... to say... sell...

money gone... left... there too...

GEORGES

... three times a week... I'm not

experienced enough. We'll see if

that's enough.

GEOFF

How much is she asking?

GEORGES

It's paid by the hour. We'll see.

GEOFF

And her?

GEORGES

Anne?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

It's hard to say. Sometimes I get

the feeling she's totally unaware

of the state she's in. And then I

feel the opposite. It's... I don't

know.

GEOFF

And what about the doctor? What

does he say?

43.

GEORGES

He's...

EVA

(CRYING)

She only talks gibberish. I don't

know what...

GEOFF

Hey, dear...

GEOFF (CONT'D)

...come here, sit down, it's OK.

EVA

Nothing is OK.

EVA (CONT'D)

What's going on, actually? You

can't just leave her lying on her

bed like that! She's

unrecognizable! It's ridiculous!

GEORGES

We can't do anything for the

moment. Calm down, darling. She's

getting medical treatment, they

give her the necessary medication,

and there are no other options

right now.

EVA

What does that mean, "no other

options"? Why isn't she in a

hospital?

GEORGES

She had a second stroke. Bertier

examined her and felt we could

spare her all the hospital

inpatient procedures.

(MORE)

44.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anyway, they wouldn't keep her,

they'd send her to a care home.

What they do in those places, we

can do here.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

And she won't be put in a care

home. I promised her that.

GEOFF

Don't you think you're taking on

too much?

GEORGES

Have you got a better idea?

EVA

I can't believe that these days

there's no way of handling this

efficiently.

GEORGES

(CURTLY)

No one's stopping you from finding

out.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(PEACEABLY)

Believe me, I love your mother as

much as you do. So please, don't

treat me as if I was a total idiot

incapable of doing the obvious.

EVA

I didn't say that. I'm simply

questioning whether what I see

going on here is the answer to

everything!

GEOFF

(TO GEORGES)

Don't you want to get a second

opinion?

45.

GEORGES

Now you two had better stop, OK?

Another doctor did come. He said

Bertier was right. From Monday, a

nurse will come three times a week.

Now can we talk about something

else?

EVA

Like what?

GEORGES

There, my love, I hope you like it.

ANNE

OK...

GEORGES

I added a little orange juice. I

find it tastes quite good.

46.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Come on, Anne, you have to eat some

more. You've only swallowed three

mouthfuls.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Please, darling. A bit more.

ANNE

...Mom to the concert...

GEORGES

Yes?

ANNE

...Mom to the concert... no

dress...

GEORGES

Mom has no dress for the concert?

ANNE

...Mom to concert... no ... uuu...

no...

GEORGES

Yes?

ANNE

(in a monotone)

Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!

Help!...

47.

NURSE

... we could take turns. She'd come

from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until

6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly

relieve the pressure on you.

GEORGES

I'll think about it.

NURSE

She just has to know in time so she

can arrange it in her schedule.

GEORGES

Yes, of course, I'll let you know

in the next few days.

NURSE

Very well. I have to go now...

NURSE (CONT'D)

Thanks for the coffee.

GEORGES

My pleasure. I'll see you out.

NURSE

You mustn't take it too seriously.

Usually they always say something.

She might just as well say "Mom,

Mom, Mom". It's just mechanical.

GEORGES

(nodding, softly)

I know.

NURSE

Goodbye, sir.

48.

GEORGES

Goodbye.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(slowly, softly)

I'd like to hire a second nurse.

The two could take turns. That

would make everything a bit

simpler. What do you think?

ANNE

(softly) ...Help...Help...

GEORGES

Would you mind putting them in the

kitchen.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I'm ba-aack!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Thanks very much.

49.

SUPERINTENDENT

Can I do anything else for you,

sir?

GEORGES

No, thanks, Mr. Mery. You've been a

big help.

SUPERINTENDENT

Oh, it's nothing, sir.

SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)

Thanks a lot, sir.

GEORGES

I'll let you know if I need you

again.

SUPERINTENDENT

With pleasure, sir.

SUPERINTENDENT (CONT'D)

May I say something, sir?

GEORGES

What is it?

SUPERINTENDENT

My wife and I, we're very impressed

by the way you're managing

everything. I take my hat off to

you.

GEORGES

(taking the mobile phone from the

pocket of his jacket)

That's very kind of you. Thanks.

See you soon.

SUPERINTENDENT

Give my regards to your wife.

GEORGES

I certainly will. Thanks.

50.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Hello Eva, how are you?... Things

are fine.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(insistently)...Sur le pont ...

ANNE

... Ssssur...

GEORGES

...Sur le pont...

ANNE

po ... pont ... sss

GEORGES

...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ...

ANNE

... Ssssur le pont ...

GEORGES

(smiling to encourage her): ... Sur

le pont d'Avignon...

ANNE

... ssur... le ..

GEORGES

... pont... Sur le pont

d'Avignon... (he begins to sing):

Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse,

on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon

tout le monde y danse en rond...

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse,

on y danse ...

51.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(singing to encourage Anne,

accompanied by the sounds that she

produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on

y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont

d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en

rond ...

SECOND NURSE

("CHEERY")

... there we are...now we're all

beautiful again...so everybody will

admire us...there...you see...

wait...

SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)

Well?... What do we say to that?

Aren't we a pretty sight?

SECOND NURSE (CONT'D)

You'll see, Monsieur will be

dazzled by you...

52.

NURSE

... as you wish, sir. I don't know

what you were expecting. I gave up

another job to come and work here.

You should have thought it over

before deciding whether you wanted

a second nurse or not.

GEORGES

But I've only just found out how

incompetent you are.

NURSE

(FURIOUS)

What's that supposed to mean?

GEORGES

I don't want to discuss it with

you. Anyway, you wouldn't

understand.

NURSE

No one has ever complained.

GEORGES

Good for you. (To get rid of her)

How much do I owe you?

NURSE

(after a brief calculation)

Seven hundred and eighty euros.

NURSE (CONT'D)

I've never had anything like this

happen to me before. Who do you

think you are?! I've been doing

this job for ten years. I don't

need you to teach me how to do it.

GEORGES

Do you have twenty euros?

53.

NURSE

No.

GEORGES

Then take the eight hundred euros.

You can go now.

NURSE

You're a nasty old man. I feel

sorry for you.

GEORGES

I hope from the bottom of my heart

that one day someone treats you the

way you treat your patients, and

that you too will have no way of

defending yourself. Now get out.

NURSE

Go fuck yourself, you old fart!

GEORGES

... Please, open your mouth... go

on... open it... Anne! Please!...

come on... stop that!...

GEORGES (CONT'D)

If you don't drink, you'll die.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Is that what you want?

54.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Come on, Anne, please.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(ANGRILY)

Goddammit!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Anne! ... You can't force me to let

you die of thirst. If you persist,

I'll call Bertier and he'll put you

in hospital. They can force-feed

you there. Is that what you want?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

I promised to spare you that. But

you must help me. I'm out of my

depth.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Please, Anne!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Drink that, now!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

There!

55.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Good.

ANNE

(SOFTLY)

Help... help...

GEORGES

(SOFTLY)

Please, forgive me.

ANNE

(softly) Help... Help... Help...

Help...

GEORGES

Who's there?

EVA'S VOICE

It's me.

56.

GEORGES

Eva?

EVA'S VOICE

(a bit irritated) Yes.

GEORGES

Just a minute.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Hello.

EVA

Hello. What was going on?

GEORGES

I was in the toilet. Sorry.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Come in.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Why this unannounced visit? Where

have you come from?

EVA

What's going on with Mom?

GEORGES

Nothing. What should be going on?

57.

EVA

Well... (gesture toward the

BEDROOM)

GEORGES

Don't you want to sit down first?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

So why are you in Paris?

EVA

What's going on with Mom? Why don't

you answer the phone? After our

last conversation, I left four

messages on your answering machine.

Why don't you call back?

GEORGES

Sorry. I didn't listen to it.

Forgive me.

EVA

Don't you realize we're worried?

GEORGES

Your worries are no use to me.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

No, don't get me wrong. I'm not

criticizing you. I just don't have

the time to deal with your worries,

that's all.

EVA

Dad...

GEORGES

No. Let's stop this conversation

right there. I'm taking care of

your mother. It's a full-time job.

And I'm not saying that to

complain, just to explain why I

didn't answer your phone calls and

why I don't want to have any

pointless discussions on the

subject. Your mother is just as

could have been expected: bad the

whole time.

(MORE)

58.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

She is turning more and more into a

helpless child, and it's sad and

humiliating, for her and for me.

And she doesn't want to be seen in

that state either. Even the last

time you visited, she didn't want

you to come. You two have your own

life. Nothing wrong with that. But

let us have our life too. Even

though it's a lousy one. OK?

EVA

Dad, what's the matter?

GEORGES

Nothing's the matter; your visit

caught me by surprise. And I'm

annoyed that you show up here to

check that everything's OK. Who do

you think you are?

EVA

I...

GEORGES

Stay here, will you!

GEORGES (CONT'D)

(softly, but insistently)

Please!

EVA (O.S.)

Mom? ... Mom??

EVA (CONT'D)

Tell me, what's going on? Have you

gone crazy?

GEORGES

Please, sit down.

59.

EVA

I don't want to sit down. What's

going on here?

GEORGES

(QUIETLY)

Nothing's going on. I want to spare

us all a pointless drama. I presume

your mother is asleep. She mostly

sleeps the whole day. And then she

wakes up at night. If you really

want to, we'll go and see her in a

little while. Now, sit down. OK?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

We do our speech exercises every

day, or we sing together. Most of

the time, I wake up around 5. At

that time, she's still awake. Then

we change her incontinence pad. I

rub cream on her to avoid sores.

Then, around 7, I try to persuade

her to eat and drink. Sometimes it

works, sometimes not. Sometimes she

tells me things from her childhood,

then for hours she calls for help,

and then an instant later she's

giggling away to herself, or

crying. Nothing of any of that is

worth showing to anyone.

EVA

(SOFTLY)

You can't stop me from seeing her.

GEORGES

(ALSO SOFTLY)

No.

60.

EVA

It's me, Mom.

EVA (CONT'D)

(HELPLESS)

Can I do something for you? Mom...

ANNE

Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom...

GEORGES

The tea isn't very hot any more.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

But it does make you feel better.

EVA

Thanks.

61.

GEORGES

It was silly of me to lock the

door. I'm sorry. You took me by

surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.

EVA

What's going to happen now?

GEORGES

(with a little ironic laugh)

What's going to happen now? The

nurse comes twice a week, and every

two weeks Dr. Bertier and the

hairdresser come. That's what you

want to know, right?

Things will go on as they have done

up until now. They'll go from bad

to worse. Things will go on, and

then one day it will all be over.

EVA

You can't go on like this, Dad.

GEORGES

Can't I? What do you suggest?

EVA

Can't we have a serious talk, you

and me?

GEORGES

What do you call "a serious talk"?

What do you want to suggest? Do you

want to have Mom live with you? Do

you want to pack her off to a care

home? Do you? What do you want? Go

on, talk to me "seriously"!

62.

ANNE

(in a rush)... short... short

dress... only I... only I... all

long... it was... (with a small

gesture to imitate a bell): ding...

dong...

GEORGES

(SMILING)

Yes, it swung to and fro.

ANNE

(still rushed) ... yes... to ...

fro ... you... very serious... like

that... (she imitates a serious

countenance, continues in a low

voice): like that... serious...

GEORGES

(unable to keep from laughing a

little) Yes. I think I was pretty

uptight.

ANNE

(smiling) yes... up... tight...

ANNE (CONT'D)

... it was n...nice...

BATHROOM

ANNE'S VOICE

(loud) Help... Help... Help...

Help... Help...

GEORGES

(trying to calm her like a sick

child) What is it?..

(MORE)

63.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

Are you in pain?... What's the

matter?... Is your pad full?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

No... So what's hurting you?

GEORGES (CONT'D)

It's all right... it's all right ...

I'm here... everything's fine...

we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a

story... but you must be quiet, I

can't talk too loud, it wears me

out... Here we go: when I was

little... well, I wasn't as little

as all that... it was toward the

end of primary school, so I was

about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a

holiday camp. They thought it would

do me good to spend the summer with

kids my own age... We were lodged

in an old castle in the midst of a

magnificent wooded landscape... I

think it was in the Auvergne... I

don't know... in any case it was

the opposite of what I'd

expected... We had to get up at 6

and go for a morning swim. Not far

from the castle, there was a pond

fed by an icy mountain stream. We

entered it running, in a double

file. You know, I was never very

sporty. They had a program to keep

us on the go all day, probably to

nip any potential pubescent

impulses in the bud ... But the

worst thing was the food. The third

day after our arrival, there was

rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice

pudding. We sat at long tables in a

huge hall. I didn't want to eat the

stuff and the housemaster said to

me: You won't get up until you've

cleared your plate. So after the

meal everybody left the room, and I

remained seated, in tears. I had

made a secret pact with Mom. I was

to send her a postcard every week.

(MORE)

64.

GEORGES (CONT'D)

If I was pleased with the place I

was to draw some flowers on it, or

if not, some stars. She kept the

card; it was covered all over in

stars. After three hours, I was

allowed to leave the table. I went

up to my room, got into bed and had

a fever of 42 degrees. It was

diphtheria. They took me to the

nearest hospital where I was put in

an isolation ward, which meant that

Mom, when she came to visit me,

could only wave at me through a

window. At some point I lost that

postcard. It's a pity.

65.

66.

ANNE

I'm almost done.

ANNE'S VOICE

You can put your shoes on if you

want.

ANNE

Thanks.

ANNE (CONT'D)

Aren't you taking a coat?
