SHOOTING DRAFT

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

(flatly)

We're moving.

CAROL

What?

NICK

(enunciating)

We're going to move.

CAROL

(after a beat)

When?

NICK

Two days.

CAROL

In two days?!

NICK

Yeah.

CAROL

(covering her hurt)

Thanks for the news...

NICK

I haven't known for long. I just

decided.

(ruminating)

What do I need that makes me make

these decisions?

CAROL

You got me.

CAROL

What does Beth say?

NICK

Beth?...

CUT TO:

NICK (V.O.)

Whatever makes me happy. That's what

she says...

CUT TO:

NICK

(w/ drunken desperation)

I know this place.

NICK

I know what happens here.

NICK

I know what's going to happen.

NICK

(bursting with

frustration)

The same job, same scenery, same

people... I've been in this town for

years... Years!!

CAROL

(flatly)

Three years.

NICK

(in despair)

Oh, Carol...

CAROL

I know...

NICK

Forever -- it seems forever.

CUT TO:

BETH

(sweetly but firmly)

Good-bye.

CUT TO:

CAROL

How long a drive is it?

NICK

Fourteen hours.

CAROL

That's not bad.

NICK

In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare.

NICK

(griping)

And there's no radio in Utah. It's

all religious programs.

CAROL

Get saved.

NICK

(flatly)

No thanks.

CAROL

Hey. Think about this. You take a

detour and go through Vegas -- you

and Beth stop, see a show, have a

nice romantic dinner -- play the

slots, get the free drinks...

NICK

(interrupting)

Too much money. The show. The meal.

The slots. Then the hotel -- that's

another hundred down the toilet.

CAROL

(jabbing Nick)

No, you skip the hotel. It's night,

the highway's empty -- you can make

good time. You start speeding. You

get stopped in Utah by the cops --

you flunk the breathalizer, they

haul you in. The judge is Mormon --

you get fifteen years, you go to

prison, but at least your life has

taken a direction!

BETH

(calling in)

I'm here!

CAROL

(chipper)

Hi!

NICK

Hi, honey.

CAROL

Hi.

BETH

(w/ forced cheer)

Hi.

CUT TO:

BETH

G'night.

CAROL

G'night.

NICK

(calling out)

Pizza Hut, tomorrow?

CAROL

Okay.

(to Beth)

I've got the short shift -- you want

me to come over, help pack?

BETH

Great... I'm really sorry we didn't

tell you sooner. He just decided.

CAROL

I understand.

BETH

I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

NICK

What's your problem?

BETH

I haven't got a problem.

NICK

Okay.

NICK

You agreed to try Billings.

BETH

I know.

(in Nick's words)

Billings, Montana. City of the future.

NICK

Yeah and I read that a while ago --

so the future's probably already

there.

NICK

(defensively)

It's not like you're leaving anything

behind. A good job or something.

BETH

Just some friends.

NICK

You'll make new friends.

BETH

I know.

(after a beat)

I'm not eight years old. I know I'll

make new friends.

NICK

Then what is it?

BETH

(uncomfortably)

I, umm... I... It embarrasses me.

When you talk about something with

Carol that happened before me. She's

my best friend. It embarrasses me

that you used to live with her.

NICK

That was years ago.

BETH

Three years.

NICK

That's right.

BETH

I know...

NICK

And we're moving. She won't be your

best friend anymore.

NICK

Living with someone isn't such a big

deal.

NICK

Anyway... I live with you now.

CUT TO:

NICK

(calling out)

Beth!... Beth!!

NICK

It's... it's raining!

BETH

It does that.

NICK

Since we got it?

BETH

No.

(pouring herself a

cup)

Lately.

NICK

(throwing his jacket

on a chair)

Shit.

(agitated)

What's wrong with it?

BETH

Water comes out.

NICK

Shit.

(unplugging the coffee

maker)

I hate this shit! It never kept the

coffee hot. And now this.

BETH

(blowing on her coffee)

It still works.

NICK

(adamant)

No. It doesn't. Water comes out.

BETH

Okay.

NICK

I could've gotten a new one. On my

discount. Now it's too late.

BETH

Do you want a donut?

NICK

(exasperated)

No. I want an appliance that works.

NICK

This coffee maker was junk.

NICK

This blender's junk. Our t.v. is

junk!

NICK

I don't know why we're even bothering

to pack.

BETH

(through a mouthful

of donut)

You got me.

NICK

The t.v. gets no channels.

BETH

And it's fifteen inch.

NICK

(shaking his head)

I can't believe we don't have a big

t.v.

BETH

We don't watch much.

NICK

But at our age...

BETH

Why don't you take one?

NICK

I'm not hungry.

BETH

(offhandedly)

Not a donut. A t.v.

NICK

Take a t.v.?

BETH

It's your last day.

NICK

Like a bonus.

BETH

Yeah.

CUT TO:

NICK

I might do it.

BETH

I say do it.

(after a beat)

Sears can afford to give you a bonus.

NICK

Maybe they are.

BETH

What do you mean?

NICK

Maybe when I get my check today,

there'll be a bonus in it.

BETH

(evenly)

Nick. They fired you.

NICK

Yeah...

BETH

(flatly)

There's no bonus.

NICK

Yeah... That's true.

(shaking his head)

And I sold a lot of teevees for

them...

BETH

(calmly)

You should take a t.v.

NICK

I should go.

(sarcastically)

Don't wanna be late on my last day.

BETH

Mmmmm...

NICK

I gotta go.

CUT TO:

MAN'S VOICE

You livin' in your car or what?

NICK

Just waiting for the last second to

put on the noose.

(tightening the tie)

So Chip -- what's new?

CHIP

Nothing much.

(broaching the subject)

I heard you're leaving.

NICK

Yeah. I'm outta here.

CHIP

They can you?

NICK

That's what they think.

CHIP

Yeah?

NICK

I was gonna quit anyway -- this way

I get unemployment.

CHIP

Good deal.

NICK

Yeah... recession insurance...

(Chip enters)

This way I'm not stuck waiting around

for the lay-offs to start.

CHIP

(a hint of panic)

Lay-offs?

CUT TO:

BETH

Who are you?

SID

(not looking up)

The painter.

BETH

(agitated)

What are you doing?

SID

Painting.

SID

(extremely pleased)

Well, good morning...

BETH

(recognizing him)

You...

SID

(extending a hand)

Sid. Nice to see you again.

BETH

Why are you here?

SID

Realty office likes a fresh coat

between tenants.

BETH

(pointedly)

We're still here.

SID

I've done this house before.

(admiringly)

I did a nice job.

BETH

Can't you come back tomorrow?

SID

Tomorrow's Sunday.

BETH

Yeah...?

SID

The new people move in on Sunday.

(conversationally)

Where are you moving to?

BETH

(wearily)

Billings, Montana.

SID

(incredulous)

Why?

BETH

It can't be worse than Enfield,

Arizona.

SID

(smiling)

I've lived in Enfield my whole life.

SID

Could you hold this?

SID

I use this to mask. Have you ever

used masking tape to mask?

BETH

No. I haven't.

SID

A house like this, it's real easy.

Hardly needs a paint job.

BETH

You can skip it. I won't tell.

SID

It needs a fresh coat...

SID

...a little color.

BETH

(naturally curious)

What color is it gonna be?

SID

Off-white.

BETH

It's already off-white.

SID

No. It's white. It's just dirty.

SID

Now if it was my house, I would choose

a color...

SID

I would not choose off-white.

BETH

What would you choose?

SID

The color of your eyes.

(pause, without looking)

Hazel.

CUT TO:

CAROL

Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a

moron.

NICK

(looking to the present)

What's that?

CAROL

Going away present.

NICK

Thanks.

NICK

(happily)

A map!

CAROL

I thought you might need it.

NICK

(unfolding it)

I do! I had a map -- I lost it.

CAROL

(organized)

Let's highlight your route.

CAROL (O.S.)

Here's Enfield.

NICK (O.S.)

Here's Billings.

NICK (O.S.)

Look at this -- right there -- that's

the town I was born in.

NICK

(emphatically)

Where I grew up. Where my parent's

live... Isn't that a coincidence?

CAROL

Visit them.

NICK

(shaking his head)

Oh... no...

CAROL

You're going to be driving by.

NICK

No...

(shaking his head)

They're not near the interstate.

(sort of chagrined)

I haven't even called them in years.

CAROL

You might as well visit.

NICK

(adamantly)

No.

(shrugging)

I wouldn't know them.

NICK

Shit.

CAROL

Let me.

NICK

Thanks.

CAROL

I'm starved.

CUT TO:

SID

I'm lucky I don't have to kill them.

BETH

(not a line she was

expecting)

What?

SID

If they were dark, I'd have to put a

layer of kill down first.

SID

So the dark paint wouldn't shine

through the off-white.

BETH

Oh.

SID

Kill's an oil based paint.

SID

It covers the old paint so that you'd

never know it was there, but it gives

off fumes when it's drying.

SID

Noxious fumes. They would find us on

the floor unconscious.

BETH

They?

SID

The "they" that find people...

BETH

(interjecting)

Nick.

SID

...unconscious.

BETH

(flatly)

Nick.

(after a beat)

The man I live with.

SID

(smiling)

I guess he'd be the "they".

BETH

He'd find us. And he'd be surprised.

CUT TO:

NICK

(doggedly)

It was the drive that killed us. San

Antonio to Seattle is just too many

hours in a car. If we'd have flown,

we would've made it.

CAROL

(shaking her head)

No...

NICK

Things were all right in bed.

CAROL

But the rest of the time they were...

awful.

NICK

(hurt)

Really?

CAROL

(flatly)

Nick. We couldn't stand each other.

We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.

NICK

(after a beat)

Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It

was your car.

CAROL

(dryly)

Big trees scare me.

NICK

(casually)

I'm thinking about stealing a t.v.

CUT TO:

SID

(cheerfully)

I'm done in there. I won't paint the

ceiling 'til you've moved the

furniture out.

BETH

I don't think we're going to take

much of the furniture.

SID

No?

BETH

It's ugly.

SID

I kind of like the sofa.

BETH

It's a sofa bed.

SID

You're not going to take it?

BETH

(flatly)

It weighs two thousand pounds.

SID

Can I have it?

BETH

It's yours.

SID

Excellent.

CAROL

(excited)

Nick's gonna steal a t.v.!

CAROL

Who are you?

SID

The painter.

BETH

(excitedly)

He's really gonna do it?

CAROL

He says yes.

CAROL

(conspiratorilly)

We've got to talk.

SID

(piping in)

About the crime?

CAROL

(sharply)

There's no crime.

SID

Nick's gonna steal a t.v.

CAROL

That's just an expression.

SID

I've never heard that expression.

CAROL

(witheringly)

It's making the rounds. College

students use it.

SID

(to Beth)

Where's he stealing it from?

BETH

Sears.

CAROL

(incredulous)

You want him to know?

BETH

He knows. He doesn't care.

(to Sid)

Do you care?

SID

(enthusiastically)

I'm interested. Crime's interesting.

I read the papers.

BETH

It's not a crime.

CAROL

It's justice.

BETH

Poetic justice.

SID

How?

BETH

They fired him.

SID

(deducing)

He's got motive.

CAROL

(exasperated)

Who is this guy?!

BETH

The painter.

SID

(helpfully)

Sid.

CAROL

(point blank)

No.

CAROL

(purposefully)

He needs you at the store.

BETH

(tinged w/ apprehension)

He needs me?

CUT TO:

NICK

You lookin' or buyin'?

RORY

Lookin'. I hate television.

NICK

Yeah. What do you like?

RORY

Movies.

NICK

(shaking his head)

No...

RORY

I do.

NICK

(laying it out)

You see... you go to a movie, you're

there.

NICK

You watch t.v., you're thirteen places

at once. As many channels as you

get, that's as many places as you

are. You get cable? You're forty

places at once. You get a satellite

dish?...

RORY

You're all over the world.

NICK

Exactly.

NICK

You're everywhere.

NICK

It's called freedom.

CUT TO:

CAROL

(w/ attitude)

This is what you do?

SID

I also mow lawns.

CAROL

Which is your career?

SID

Painting. I'm an inside person.

(confidentially)

Mowing grass is seasonal.

CAROL

(dryly)

That is true.

SID

(disarmingly)

You've got a nice tan.

CAROL

(not disarmed)

I work on it.

SID

Do you want to get stoned?

CAROL

(after a beat)

Yeah.

SID

This kind of painting -- for people

I won't know -- it's boring.

(lighting the joint)

It's not very good. It's homegrown.

CAROL

Yeah?

SID

But it'll get you fucked up.

SID (O.S.)

It'll take you someplace.

CUT TO:

NICK

Have you thought about American?

MAJOR JENKINS

No.

NICK

I own an American set. I'm very

satisfied.

MAJOR JENKINS

I want Japanese.

NICK

I'll tell you...

NICK

...the thing is, a hundred and fifty

dollars gets you very little in the

way of Japanese technology.

MAJOR JENKINS

Oh.

NICK

It would get you that t.v.

MAJOR JENKINS

It's for my parents.

NICK

Your parents?

MAJOR JENKINS

Yes. They live with me...

MAJOR JENKINS

...and they want Japanese.

MAJOR JENKINS

Is there a problem?

NICK

(controlling the

giggles)

No... I, uh, just never think of

adults as having parents.

MAJOR JENKINS

(flatly)

They do.

NICK

(agreeably)

I know...

NICK

I'm an adult, I have parents.

NICK

Oh, Miss, I've got your receipt!

BETH

(acting cheerful)

Oh... great!

NICK

This is all you need.

BETH

(puzzled, but playing

along)

Thanks...

NICK

(personably)

Now you just take this receipt out,

give it to the guys at the loading

dock and they'll give you your brand

new beautiful television set.

BETH

(thrown)

I get the t.v...?

NICK

(cheerfully)

Out back. They'll help load it in

your car and everything.

BETH

(flatly)

I get the t.v.

NICK

Out back.

NICK

Think about American. They're mostly

Japanese parts anyway.

BETH

Excuse me, I just...

NICK

(interrupting,

pleasantly)

Miss... I'm helping this customer

here, perhaps you might...

(firmly, a salesman's

put-off)

You might want to see someone else.

BETH

(pointedly)

You can't help me?

NICK

(after a beat, then

w/ finality)

Not really.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SID (O.S.)

How'd you do it?

BETH (O.S.)

Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a

new set, and gave me the receipt.

SID

(savoring the bubble

plastic)

Excellent.

BETH

Maybe I should just leave it packed...

SID

C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see

it! Hold the box.

SID

(urgently)

Wait!

SID

I thought I heard the police.

BETH

Ha ha ha.

(an amused realization)

You're stoned!

SID

(innocently)

Me?

BETH

You're being silly and you've got

bunny eyes.

SID

I'm a little stoned... not that

stoned.

BETH

No?

SID

No.

(after a beat)

Carol's really stoned.

BETH

You got Carol stoned?

SID

Very stoned.

BETH

I didn't think she liked you.

SID

She doesn't. But she likes getting

stoned.

BETH

(smiling)

She does.

SID

There's nothing like drugs to create

a quick and shallow friendship.

SID

(rubbing his hands)

Let's look at the loot.

SID

(very impressed)

Jesus... you didn't fool around.

BETH

(w/ mixed emotions)

This is the nicest thing I've ever

owned.

CUT TO:

NEWSMAN'S VOICE

And in Canton, Ohio today, a man

opened fire in a mall, killing nine

and wounding seventeen others. Initial

reports indicate the young man was a

disgruntled employee...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BETH

It's a beautiful picture.

SID

(enthusiastically)

Nice speakers!

BETH

(happily)

Yeah!

(w/ happy disbelief)

Fuckin' Nick...

CAROL

(over the din, dryly)

Hi, kids.

BETH

(cheerfully)

Come see!

CAROL

(impressed)

I should have had him steal me one,

too.

BETH

You can come over and watch.

SID

(to Beth, quietly)

You're moving.

BETH

(w/ a tinge of sadness)

Oh. Right.

(to Carol)

Sorry.

CAROL

Forget it...

CAROL

(breaking the silence,

pointedly)

How's the painting going?

SID

(shaking his head)

Too many distractions. I'll be at it

all night.

CAROL

You have bad work habits.

SID

Not when I'm actually working.

(standing)

I better get set up in the kitchen.

CAROL

It makes teevee seem very futuristic.

SID

(at the kitchen door)

That's 'cause you're stoned.

CAROL

I'm hardly stoned.

CAROL

(mitigating)

It was homegrown.

BETH

(teasing)

Want some Visine?

CAROL

(flatly)

No.

SID (O.S.)

(calling out)

It gets the red out.

CAROL

(dryly)

Thank you.

CAROL

Shit. Missed the eye, got the face.

BETH

Need help?

CAROL

Yeah.

BETH

Okay.

(holding Carol's arm)

Tilt your head back.

CAROL

Beth...

BETH

Stop fidgeting.

CAROL

Got it.

BETH

Next eye.

CAROL

Wait a second.

CAROL

(nodding to the

kitchen, in a

conspiratorial whisper)

He really wants to get in your pants.

BETH

(smiling)

My pants are taken.

BETH

Why don't you go for him?

CAROL

He likes you.

BETH

I wish Nick would get back and help

with the packing.

BETH

He's probably getting drunk with the

stockboys...

(after a beat)

That's what he's probably doing.

CAROL

Beth...

(pause, then w/

difficulty)

Listen...

BETH

(simply)

He's gone.

CAROL

Yeah.

BETH

(badly shaken)

Where'd he call from?

CAROL

He said the highway.

BETH

I have to do something.

CAROL

I'll help.

BETH

I've got to be out of here Sunday.

That's tomorrow.

CAROL

You can come to my place.

BETH

(stunned)

He's gone.

CAROL

(gently)

He's an asshole.

BETH

(a half whisper)

Fuckin' Nick...

CUT TO:

NICK

Nobody lives in that, right?

NAVAJO TEEN

Gift shop. But it closed at seven.

NICK

(cheerfully shrugging)

I got no one to shop for.

NICK

Shit.

(rubbing his eye)

Fuckin' wind...

NAVAJO TEEN

Yeah.

NICK

(sincerely)

What does it mean?

NAVAJO TEEN

High pressure field coming in --

should bring some nice weather.

NICK

No. The wind itself, you know what I

mean, you're an Indian...

NAVAJO TEEN

(correcting him)

I'm a Navajo.

NICK

Yeah, so you're in tune with this

stuff...

NAVAJO TEEN

(checking the pump)

It's thirteen bucks.

NICK

(his train of thought

broken)

Oh... right.

NICK

Here's a twenty.

NICK

So what does the wind mean? Like as

an omen or something, you know --

(making his voice

mystical)

-- a change is coming to the people. --

the spirit of freedom is walking the

land.

(flatly)

That kind of meaning...

NAVAJO TEEN

(handing him money)

Fourteen, fifteen and five makes

twenty.

NAVAJO TEEN

The wind is. It's the wind like I'm

a Navajo.

NICK

That's it?

NICK

Shit.

NICK

(out the window)

It would be better if meant something.

CUT TO:

CAROL

He said he needs to be alone again.

Learn about himself. Make a fresh

start in a new town.

CAROL

(after a beat)

He's sorry.

CAROL

He said he would have called you,

but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause

you're moving.

(after a beat)

He's always been an asshole.

(after a beat)

You'll be all right.

BETH

Yeah...

CAROL

(gently)

I'm here.

BETH

I know that.

WAITRESS

You ready for another?

BETH

Oh... uh, no...

CAROL

We're fine.

WAITRESS

Is Nick coming in?

CUT TO:

PREACHER'S VOICE

(covered by static)

"And he arose and came to his father,

but when he was still a great way

off, his father saw him and had

compassion, and ran and..."

CUT TO:

BETH

(forcefully)

You've lived here your whole life?

SID

(after a beat)

Yeah.

BETH

(increduously)

You've never gone anywhere?

SID

Travelling has no allure for me.

BETH

None?

SID

Maybe through time.

BETH

(smiling)

That's not offered.

SID

So I stay here.

BETH

Why?

SID

(the simple truth)

It's my home. I belong here.

BETH

I'm serious.

SID

My father says if you stay in one

place long enough your luck knows

where to find you.

BETH

(wryly)

Maybe that's my problem.

SID

(carefully)

Maybe it is...

BETH

Thanks.

BETH

You think your father knows the truth?

SID

He's a bartender.

(smiling)

He's lived here his whole life.

BETH

Has his luck found him?

SID

Not yet.

(after a beat)

But it's probably very close.

SID

(cautiously)

Are you all right?

BETH

(apologetically)

Must be the paint fumes...

BETH

(contemplatively

dubious)

You find what you want here?

SID

It seems that way.

BETH

Yeah?

SID

(simply)

I found you.

BETH

Oh. No...

SID

(earnestly)

We never met before last night...

SID

...but we know each other.

BETH

No...

SID

Leave it behind.

BETH

Leave what behind?

SID

Unhappiness.

BETH

(amused)

That was a bad answer.

SID

(seriously)

No. It was true.

BETH

It's not.

SID

Come hold me.

(after a beat)

Come hold me, and you'll be happy.

BETH

(dryly)

I'll find happiness. Right. In your

arms.

SID

Yes.

BETH

In you.

SID

Yes.

BETH

But I won't. I have to find happiness

in myself.

SID

No. That's wrong.

(going toward her)

People tell you that, but it's wrong.

SID

I've lived with people who have that

happiness from within. That happiness --

it's just them being pleased with

themselves. It's not enough. It's a

lonely thing.

BETH

You're showing how young you are.

SID

No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way.

You know that. And you know me.

(after a beat)

And I know you.

BETH

I don't know you.

SID

You know.

BETH

(after a beat,

defensively)

I know you want to fuck me.

SID

Is that what you know?

BETH

I know...

BETH

(whispering)

I know you.

BETH

(w/ fierce intensity)

I know you.

SID

That's right.

CUT TO:

NICK

Excuse me...

NICK

Excuse me... I'm... I'm looking for

my parents.

NICK

My mother, my father... they...

NICK

(uncomfortably)

Hello.

ELIZABETH

Hello.

NICK

(exhaling in relief)

Oh... good...

(to the point)

This is my house. I, uhh... mean

this is the house I grew up in.

ELIZABETH

(nodding to Mr. August)

This is his house now.

NICK

Nice to meet you.

ELIZABETH

He's deaf.

NICK

(loudly)

Nice to meet you.

ELIZABETH

He's stone deaf.

NICK

Oh.

(uncomfortably)

Yelling doesn't help.

ELIZABETH

No.

NICK

My name is Nick, Nick Brennan.

NICK

Did you know the Brennans?

ELIZABETH

No.

NICK

They lived here. They used to live

here. I used to live here with them...

NICK

What's your name?

ELIZABETH

Elizabeth.

NICK

No...

ELIZABETH

Yes.

NICK

I know an Elizabeth.

(quietly)

I call her Beth.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NICK

(swallowing)

This is a good sandwich.

ELIZABETH

Thank you.

NICK

(abruptly nodding

toward Mr. August)

When did he move here? Would he know

where the people before him went?

ELIZABETH

No. He wouldn't remember.

NICK

You're sure?

ELIZABETH

Yes. He doesn't remember anymore.

NICK

Oh.

(taking a deep breath)

He can't help me.

ELIZABETH

No.

NICK

(with wry awareness)

I've lost my parents.

ELIZABETH

(matter-or-factly)

Did you lose them both at the same

time?

NICK

Is that like a joke?

ELIZABETH

No.

NICK

Then yes. I lost them both at the

same time.

ELIZABETH

I lost mine one at a time.

(after a beat)

Last year.

NICK

I'm sorry. That's tragic. I should...

ELIZABETH

(interrupting)

Six months apart. Body failures.

Separate body failures.

NICK

I'm really sorry.

(standing)

I should go.

ELIZABETH

First my father's heart kept starting

and stopping.

NICK

(nodding)

Attacks...

ELIZABETH

My mother and I were with him in the

hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd

grab my arms and hold on.

NICK

That's very sad...

(after a beat, backing

toward the door)

I've really gotta be going. I, uh...

thank you again for the sandwich.

Delicious...

ELIZABETH

Right before my mother died, she

said -- "Elizabeth. You're adopted."

NICK

Have you found your real parents?

ELIZABETH

No. Two are enough to lose.

ELIZABETH

I'm not alone. I have my Grandfather.

NICK

(opening the door)

Listen...

ELIZABETH

I'm sorry.

ELIZABETH

(in explanation)

He's stone deaf.

NICK

I have to go.

CUT TO:

SID

(after a beat)

I'd like to stay right here...

BETH

I have to be out tomorrow.

SID

In this moment... Enjoying this

moment.

BETH

(hushed)

The moment's gone.

SID

(shaking his head)

It can go on as long as we want.

BETH

(skeptically)

Have you ever been in a relationship?

SID

No.

(after a beat)

I was married... but it wasn't really

a relationship.

BETH

(incredulous)

You weren't married...

SID

Two years. Right out of high school.

BETH

Do I remind you of her?

SID

No.

BETH

(relieved)

Thank God.

SID

You have beautiful skin... her skin

was polka-dotted.

BETH

Freckled...

SID

When we were kids we called her

"Spot".

BETH

(laughing)

What happened?

SID

She disappeared.

BETH

(after a beat)

Was she ever found?

SID

No. Not by me...

(looking to Beth)

I didn't go look.

SID

She wanted to meet someone new. I

asked her "why?" -- she said, "Because

he won't know me from before. Just

now. Just what I am now."

SID

I knew her... on playgrounds... in

Sunday School... all those grades --

I knew her as she changed. But she

was still the same person. All the

times I knew her, she was still her.

(after a beat)

She can't get away from that.

SID

You stay in one place, and all those

things that are you... are there.

She didn't understand that if you

leave, they're still there, in you --

but they stop being clear. You stop

knowing who you are, and what you

want.

BETH

You've stayed here and you know who

you are?

SID

I see the lawns I mow, houses I've

painted, faces I know... my parents...

And I'm constantly reminded of who I

am.

BETH

And you know what you want.

SID

I want you.

BETH

Oh.

SID

I want to be inside you.

BETH

Good.

(after a beat)

Come here and put it inside me.

SID

No... I want to be able to put myself

inside of you.

BETH

Doing this is as close as you get.

BETH

Come here.

SID

I love you.

BETH

Come inside me.

SID

Beth?

BETH

Yes?

SID

What do you want?

BETH

(uncertainly)

I want... I want...

BETH

(w/ quiet urgency)

Come inside me.

CUT TO:

NICK

(into the phone)

Could you give me the number for

information in Arizona?... Thank

you.

NICK

(into the phone)

Enfield. Carol, Carol, umm...

(mortified)

Carol... Carol Something... Shit!

NICK

(into the phone)

Hello Janet, thank you for being my

operator. I hope you can help me, I

need to call my home.

NICK

Well, I'll tell you my number, but

there's a problem. My phone's been

disconnected, not because of bills,

I mean we paid all our bills. We

were hardly ever even late. We were

very good customers, but we're moving,

so we had the phone disconnected.

But now I need to call... the woman

I live with. She's still there and

I've got to let her know where I am.

NICK

I don't know any of the neighbors. I

know one, but I can't remember her

last name.

(he listens, frustrated)

No. No. No. You see you have to be

able to help me, this is not a prank,

it's my home phone, this is an

emergency.

(he listens, then

urgently)

Yes it can, it can be done. Someone

there can hook the phone back up.

It's not like a phone guy came to

our house to disconnect the phone,

nobody came to our house, someone

just flipped a switch somewhere,

somewhere there where you work, or

plugged something into a computer

and our phone stopped working!

(he listens)

They turned it off, they can turn it

back on!

(he listens, starting

to panic)

I know it's the week-end! I know!

Call them at home! They'll have a

computer at their house, they'll

have a phone thing to hook it up to

the real computer! That's how these

people live! They'll be glad to do

it!...

NICK

(crestfallen)

No. No. I can't have the police go

to the house. That won't work, there

are circumstances.

(desperately)

It's you... you've got to help me!

Please! I've gotta call home! I can't

wait. It could be too late! Janet!!

You've gotta help me! Please! You

can reconnect me. Please!! Don't

hang up! Don't hang up!!

NICK

You fucker!! You heartless...

TELEPHONE RECORDING

"If you'd like to make a call, please

hang up and try again. If you need

help..."

CUT TO BLACK:

SID (O.S.)

(cheerfully)

Morning.

BETH

(attempting a smile)

Hi.

SID

(grinning)

Hi.

BETH

I didn't want to wake you.

SID

(cheerfully)

I'm awake. I'm a morning person.

BETH

I'm not.

SID

Then why don't you come back to bed?

BETH

I've got to pack.

SID

(sitting up)

Where do we start?

BETH

(firmly)

No.

(softening)

You paint.

BETH

I'll manage.

SID

(cheerfully)

Whatever you say.

BETH

Oh God...

SID

(concerned)

What?

BETH

(an outpouring)

I'd be so much happier if I could

blame this on Nick, but it always

happens to me. I'm always left with

nothing.

(taking a deep breath)

It doesn't matter if I leave the guy

or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left

with nothing. I never do anything

for myself. I never acquire anything.

I mean Nick didn't take from me. He

stole a t.v. and left it for me. He

didn't take my things, he didn't

take our things... he didn't even

take his clothes! And I'll still

leave this house with nothing!

SID

He took three years from you.

BETH

No...

(meeting his eyes)

He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he

cared about me, he cared about me.

And he was really good in bed.

BETH

(after a beat)

I didn't expect more.

SID

(carefully)

Beth...

BETH

(referring to the

cluttered room)

I can't face this.

(looking to Sid)

I'm gonna finish up the kitchen...

(heading for the door)

...get some momentum...

CUT TO:

YOUNG MAN

Phone work?

NICK

(after a beat)

No.

CUT TO:

CAROL (V.O.)

(gleefully

conspiratorially)

How was he?

BETH (V.O.)

(sheepishly)

He's twenty-four.

CAROL (V.O.)

A little weak on tenderness, but

long on juice?

BETH (V.O.)

Long on conversation.

CUT TO:

CAROL

Did you need talk?

BETH

Yeah. I guess I did.

CAROL

Good.

CAROL (O.S.)

(cheerfully)

So what are we doing?

BETH

Christ...

BETH

(w/ an edge of

desperation)

I gotta get out here. I was in Tucson

two years before you and Nick got

here.

(in disbelief)

I've been here five years...

CAROL

Yeah...

BETH

This state's driving me crazy.

CAROL

So what are you gonna do?

BETH

I've got no money.

CAROL

I've got some.

BETH

(chagrined by self-

awareness)

I can't take it. I mean you're being

great, but I can't take it. I'm gonna

be gone, we won't see each other,

and I won't send the money. I won't.

I know... I won't get around, I'll

forget, I won't do it.

BETH

(agitated)

Shit. I'll sell all this shit. I

don't want any of it, just my car

and my clothes...

CAROL

(carefully)

Okay...

BETH

(shaking her head)

I'm sorry... I shouldn't have fucked

this kid last night. I should have

slept. Now I've got all this stuff

to do, and I'm tired, I'm churned

up, I'm in a fuckin' mood.

CAROL

Let's do things, get you busy.

BETH

Yeah.

CAROL

You get all the stuff you wanna sell,

and I'll make some tag sale signs.

BETH

No one'll buy my stuff. It's all

junk.

CAROL

That's what people buy at tag sales.

Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks.

BETH

(laughing)

I guess I do have stuff to sell.

CUT TO:

CAROL

(impatiently)

Is there something specific you're

looking for?

MRS. DOTSON

Yes.

(sheepishly)

Actually everything... I don't have

anything.

BETH

Nothing?

MRS. DOTSON

I just moved to town.

(hesitating then

confiding)

My husband passed away, and I, umm,

didn't want to have our things...

they were too familiar.

BETH

(abruptly)

You can have it all for three hundred.

The stuff in these boxes and

everything inside.

MRS. DOTSON

(taken aback)

Oh, my, I don't know... everything?

BETH

Everything.

(hesitating)

Except the t.v.

BETH

(apologetically)

The t.v.s not for sale.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NAVAJO WOMAN

Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry.

NICK

(shaking his head)

I don't think she really wears

jewelry.

NAVAJO WOMAN

Maybe a nice Navajo rug?

NICK

(incredulous)

As a present? No.

NICK

What about that?

NICK

That would make her laugh.

NAVAJO WOMAN

(not amused)

That's authentic -- it's very

expensive.

NICK

You got something like it but fake?

CUT TO:

MRS. DOTSON

I'm sorry, what's your name?

BETH

Can you just leave the name blank? I

won't have an account, so I'll have

to find someplace to cash it for me.

MRS. DOTSON

(after a beat)

All right.

BETH

Thanks a lot.

SID

(cheerfully)

You're set.

MRS. DOTSON

(warmly chagrined)

You did all the work...

SID

(good-naturedly)

Sure.

(mischieviously)

Now I've gotta finish painting, but

Carol here would be happy to help

you unload.

CAROL

(trapped, dryly)

Of course. I'll follow you in my

car.

SID

(to Mrs. Dotson)

And I'll be by tomorrow with my truck

and the big things.

MRS. DOTSON

(to Beth)

Thank you.

(smiling)

You've given me a home.

CAROL

(nicely)

I'll be right along.

CAROL

(to Beth)

This had to be history's most

efficient tag sale.

BETH

Yeah... I'm sorry Sid stuck you with

unloading.

CAROL

No problem.

(smiling to herself)

He kinda bites my butt, but he's

okay.

BETH

He is.

BETH

Listen.

(breaking the embrace)

I'll probably be gone before you get

back.

CAROL

I thought maybe we could be roomies

for a while. You know, while you

figure out what's next.

BETH

(shaking her head)

I can't.

(after a beat,

admitting her feelings)

He gets to me... too much. If I don't

go I'll end up with staying with

him.

CAROL

(gently)

You've done worse.

BETH

Sure.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BETH (O.S.)

(softly)

Sid?

SID

Hi.

BETH

I'm sorry about selling the sofa

bed.

SID

I didn't really need one. When my

friends get drunk, they throw up and

sleep on the floor.

BETH

But I gave it to you.

SID

You gave me a lot more.

BETH

No.

(holding him tightly)

It was all even in this department.

SID

(softly)

...Feel me?

BETH

(whispering)

I know... You're hard again.

SID

I want you all the time.

BETH

(torn)

Shit.

BETH

(ironically self-aware)

I just fleeced a widow.

SID

(protesting)

No...

BETH

It was all junk.

BETH

Shit. I've got to get some aspirin...

(shaking her head)

I didn't drink enough to be hung

over.

SID

You just feel bad for her like I

feel bad for her... 'cause her husband

died.

BETH

(doubting this)

Yeah?

SID

That's about the saddest thing there

is... losing someone you love.

BETH

It's never happened to me.

SID

If you died, I couldn't stand life.

BETH

I...

BETH

(businesslike)

I've got to go now.

BETH

The new people'll be here.

SID

(following)

Go to my house.

BETH (O.S.)

No.

SID

While you find a place.

BETH

No. I gotta get out.

SID

I can talk to the realtors, I know

they've got a place in Agawam.

BETH

(shaking her head)

No... Agawam?... no. I don't know

where I'm going. Somewhere else.

SID

You can call me when you get there.

I'll give you my number.

BETH

(gently)

Sid. I'm going away. You're making

me way too important. You met me

yesterday.

SID

And today I love you.

BETH

Jesus... one day...

SID

That doesn't matter. You know that.

It can take a second.

BETH

No! That's... that's a fuckin' animal

thing, I've done that.

SID

Not with me.

BETH

I meet men, go home with them and

just stay. No decision involved --

it's just what I do. And then I don't

have to live my life, I just lead

theirs. I can't keep doing that.

SID

(adamant)

We're not that way!

BETH

What way are we?

SID

We're passionate. We're comfortable.

BETH

It's been passionate, it's been

comfortable. But it hasn't been...

important.

(after a beat)

Like you're making it!

SID

(urgently)

It is important! You know that.

BETH

No! It was a night! It wasn't real.

It was fun, it was some great fucking!

But it's just something that happened!

It's not real!

SID

It didn't "just happen"! You know

we're it! I'm the one for you!

BETH

The "one"?! I've had lots of "ones"!

I look like a baby but I'm twenty-

fuckin'-- eight years old! You're

just the latest!

SID

No. I'm the last. You've found me.

And it can go on forever.

BETH

No!

(her heart breaking

for him)

Oh, Sid... Forever?

(shaking her head)

You have to understand -- it's just

talk.

SID

It's not.

BETH

(defiantly disbelieving)

It is. C'mon, these things you say...

c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't

stand life? That's... that's...

SID

That's true.

BETH

No.

BETH

(after a beat, harshly)

You won't know when I die. You won't

be there.

SID

(following her, certain)

You'd want me there. If I wasn't

there it wouldn't matter who was.

You'd be alone.

BETH

No.

SID

(imploring)

Beth... Beth... you love me...

BETH

(defiantly)

No!

SID

How do you feel? Think! You love me.

BETH

(her words carefully

chosen)

I care about you.

SID

You have to be with me.

BETH

No.

(pause)

I care about you. But I'm an adult.

I can say no.

SID

(w/ controlled anger)

That's what makes you an adult?

BETH

(unwavering)

Yes.

(pause)

I can say no.

(pause)

No, I won't do that. No, I won't

have that. No, I can't.

SID

(needing to hear her

say it)

You can say no to me?

BETH

Yes.

BETH

I'm going.

SID

Beth!

SID

(after a beat)

Have someplace to go.

BETH

(simply)

I don't.

SID

Why don't...

BETH

(interrupting)

Don't tell me what to do.

SID

What are you gonna do?

BETH

I don't know.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

(calling out)

Beth!

(bellowing)

Beth!!!

SID

(coldly)

She's not here.

NICK

(desperately)

Where is she?

SID

She's gone.

NICK

Shit!

(a moment of manners)

Excuse me.

(exploding)

Shiiiiit!!

(confrontationally)

Who are you?

SID

(coldly)

The painter. You're Nick.

NICK

(startled)

Yeah.

SID

The Indian chief.

NICK

(puzzled)

What?

NICK

Shit!

SID

(accusingly)

You're too late. She's gone.

NICK

(angrily)

I got that. Where'd she go?

SID

She didn't say.

NICK

Shit!

SID

(bitterly)

She didn't know.

NICK

(running; under his

breath)

Be at Carol's... be at Carol's...

NICK

(spent)

I'm too late...

NICK

(at the top of his

lungs)

This really bothers me!

SID

(after a moment, with

mock politeness)

Will you do me a favor?

NICK

(spitting out the

word)

What?

SID

Act normal.

NICK

(adamantly)

Listen! I don't want to be normal. I

don't have to be, I don't! This is

my house. You're in my house. And

I'm tired of going to my house and

finding strangers!

SID

It's not your house. You're gone.

I'm painting --

SID

-- for the new people -- whose house

it's going to be.

(pause)

You're gone. They're not here yet.

I'm here.

(calmly)

I guess that makes this my house.

NICK

(politely)

May I look around?

SID

(w/ a stony politeness)

Sure. Make yourself at home.

NICK

(dismayed)

Nooo... she left the television.

SID

Yeah.

NICK

Too bad.

SID

(pointedly)

She didn't seem to want it.

NICK

That's foolish. That t.v. is a

remarkable thing.

CAROL

(flatly)

You came back.

NICK

(a little chagrined)

Yeah.

CAROL

Is Beth here?

NICK

No. Do you know where she went?

CAROL

No.

NICK

Shit.

CAROL

You're too late.

SID

(from the doorway)

She's gone.

NICK

(to Carol, exasperated)

Who is this guy?

CAROL

(walking past him

toward the house)

Beth's new boyfriend.

NICK

(exploding)

What?!

CAROL

(stopping)

You heard me.

NICK

(to Sid)

Is this true?!

SID

Not really.

NICK

(to Carol)

Not really?

NICK

(to Sid)

Not really?! What?

(w/ "say it ain't so"

attitude)

Did you fuck her?

SID

I don't tell.

NICK

Jesus! The next day!

(bitterly disillusioned)

That's the world, huh? They don't

even wait a day anymore.

CAROL

(stepping in the

doorway)

You left her.

NICK

(defensively)

I didn't fuck anyone.

CAROL

(witheringly)

You didn't find anyone.

NICK

(hurt)

No... I didn't leave her for another

person, I left her for another place.

(pause)

Which I think is a little more

excusable.

SID

I don't.

NICK

Well it's none of your fuckin'

business!

SID

(threateningly)

I think it is.

NICK

Cause you fucked her? No! That gives

you no business in my life.

SID

If you hadn't gone, I'd be done by

now. I'd be home.

NICK

Be glad you have a home, asshole!

CAROL

Let it drop, Nick!

NICK

(outraged)

Why?!

CAROL

He was nice to Beth when you treated

her like shit.

NICK

(protesting weakly)

I came back...

CAROL

(busting him)

Nick. This is me. You didn't come

back for Beth's sake -- something

just didn't work out like you had

planned.

NICK

(defensively)

You see -- you don't know everything

about me -- I didn't really have any

real plans!

CAROL

He was sweet to her. They were sweet

with each other.

CAROL

Beth looked young with him. They had

a real connection.

NICK

(after a beat, dryly)

And I brought them together?

NICK

It seems I'm blessed... in what I

do. I do wrong, and it turns out

right... that I've done right. So it

really doesn't matter what I do.

NICK

Hey!

NICK

(after a beat)

I said "hey!"

NICK

(flamboyantly sarcastic)

I hope you're very happy together!

SID

She's gone.

NICK

(glancing to Carol,

pointedly)

She is, isn't she?

(to Sid)

If you two were such the happy couple

why the fuck did she leave, Romeo?

SID

After three years with you, she wanted

to be alone.

NICK

I was already gone! This is not about

me and Beth, there is no me and Beth!

This is about you! Why didn't you go

with her?

SID

It wasn't offered.

NICK

(advancing on him)

People aren't going to offer you

anything! You have to take what you

want.

SID

You can't take another person. They

have to give themselves to you.

NICK

(in his face)

That's very wise, but not very true.

(relentlessly)

I sell televisions. People don't

know what they want. You have to

show them.

SID

I couldn't show her.

NICK

Go after her!

CAROL

Leave him alone!

NICK

No. He's not alone, he's with us.

She's alone. She's out there alone.

(after a beat, quietly)

Just hoping she's closer to what she

wants...

CAROL

(sardonically)

And what is that?

NICK

(exploding)

I don't know!

NICK

How would I know?! What do I know?!

NICK

(w/ a sweeping gesture)

I know that what I want isn't there.

(pointing to his chest)

It isn't here.

(gesturing wildly)

It isn't inside! It isn't outside!

(spent)

It doesn't exist.

NICK

(forcefully)

But you want her, and you aren't

doing shit about it!

CAROL

There isn't anything he can do.

NICK

He can go after her.

(to Sid)

Go after her!

SID

I can't. She...

(torn)

My life is here.

NICK

What kind of man won't fuck up his

life for the women he loves? Go find

her!!

CAROL

He wouldn't know where to look.

NICK

(groping)

She'd she'd she'd...

(triumphant)

She'd head for her parents!

CAROL

What?

NICK

She'd head for her parents. Believe

me.

(pause, then flatly)

They're in Florida. That's east.

SID

I...

NICK

(businesslike)

You start driving east on route forty.

Keep going east and around eleven

start checking every roadside motel.

The budget ones... You do that all

night, you'll find her.

CAROL

How do you know she's on the highway?

NICK

When you don't know where you're

going, you drive on the highway.

NICK

(cheerfully)

I'll finish painting.

SID

(to Carol)

Do I have a chance?

CAROL

(after a beat, shaking

her head)

You've got a chance.

SID

(determined)

Then I'm gone.

CAROL

So.

(dryly)

Start painting.

NICK

(after a beat)

Fuck the ceiling.

(walking in)

Who looks up that often?

MAN'S VOICE

(happily)

This is it!

CAROL

(politely)

Hello...?

MAN

(surprised, breaking

the kiss)

Oh. Hello.

MAN

I'm sorry. We thought it was going

to be empty.

NICK

(flatly)

It is.

WOMAN

(cheerfully)

We're here to move in.

WOMAN

Are you the couple moving out?

CAROL

No.

NICK

No...

NICK

(improvising)

We're your new neighbors. From next

door.

MAN

Well.

(putting on a good

face)

It's nice to meet you.

WOMAN

(cheerfully, while

shaking hands)

It is... and it's so nice of you to

greet us.

CAROL

Thank you.

NICK

Actually, we're here for the t.v.

NICK

(confidently)

The people who left here -- our old

neighbors -- left us that t.v.

MAN

Oh. It's very nice.

CAROL

Yes. It is.

CAROL

(going to the t.v.)

Well, dear... we should carry it

home.

WOMAN

Do you need help?

NICK

We can manage.

CAROL

Thanks anyway.

WOMAN

(calling out)

Nice meeting you.

MAN

They're not done painting.

WOMAN

They'll finish.

WOMAN

(whimsically)

I wonder where our furniture is?

CUT TO:

CAROL

You're not going to be their new

neighbor.

NICK

It was just something to say.

CAROL

Good.

CAROL

You look terrible.

NICK

Yeah? Well, I had a big day.

(after a beat)

I went to my parent's house. Like

you said to. And there was this

ancient man, this giant man in the

doorway.

NICK

And I thought, "It's my father. My

how he's aged."

CAROL

You were drunk...

NICK

Not at the house. At the house I was

stone sober.

NICK

He was very tall. He was too tall to

be my father. He was wearing a long

overcoat, and I thought, "it's a

trick, he's on my mother's shoulders".

NICK

And then out from behind him came

this beautiful young girl... Beth.

CAROL

Beth?...

NICK

(lost in reverie)

And they sang to me. They sang "London

Bridge is Falling Down"...

(singing softly)

"Falling down, falling down.".

NICK

(seriously)

It was very touching.

CAROL

I'm sure.

NICK

(defensively)

It was.

CAROL

Nick?...

NICK

Yeah?

CAROL

What you've been doing... you can't

do anymore.

CAROL

You just can't do it.

NICK

(after a beat,

agreeably)

Okay.

CAROL

(very skeptically)

Okay?

NICK

Yeah. I understand.

CAROL

No. I don't think so.

NICK

(defensively)

I understand.

CAROL

(determined)

It's not like you can't do it.

NICK

(interjecting)

I'll stop.

CAROL

(urgently)

It's that I don't want you to do it.

NICK

I've stopped.

CAROL

(staring in his eyes)

Nick.

(emphatic)

I don't want you to do it.

NICK

(calmly, after a beat)

Okay.

CAROL

Shit.

(after a beat, wryly)

I hate talking to you.
