PLAYER IN F.G.

(kicks the slot machine)

Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it

out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey,

this ain't right. S'posed to be eight

hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn

manager? Who's in charge of these

rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change

lady...

FIGURE/BERNIE

Hey Doris, you got any cream?

BERNIE

Forget it.

NATALIE

(sotto)

Shit.

(to Doris)

Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.

BERNIE

Hi, Natalie.

NATALIE

Hi. Uh...

BERNIE

Bernie.

NATALIE

Yeah, Bernie.

(to Doris)

Hey, you seen Shelly around? He

promised to position me at the tables

tonight. I've been on skid row all

week.

DORIS

(chilly)

You didn't settle me from last night.

NATALIE

No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way

under. It's been, like, an A.A.

convention the whole week. I'll make

up for it tonight. Promise.

BERNIE

If I see Shelly, I'll let him know.

That you're looking for him.

NATALIE

Thanks.

DORIS

Bitch. That's the third time this

month...

(to Bernie)

Let me get you that cream.

BERNIE

(staring after Natalie)

Nah, it's okay.

DORIS

Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not

unless you're looking to get short-

changed.

FLOORMAN

Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on

eleven.

BERNIE

(nods)

Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal.

Have that... Natalie bring it over.

The one working nickel slots next to

the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly

earlier, he wants her at the tables.

NATALIE

This is you, right?

BERNIE

(takes it from her)

Thanks.

NATALIE

Joe said I should stick around. You

say something to Shelly?

NATALIE

Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.

BERNIE

Don't mention it.

BULLDOG

I'll make you a fortune on five and

nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three

fifty-four!

BERNIE

Hey, buddy, is this your drink?

BULLDOG

Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here.

STICKMAN

Seven out!

BULLDOG

Mother-fucker!

STICKMAN

Thank you for those bets, folks.

VOICE (V.O.)

Conway, party of twelve, please check

your reservation at the Paradise

Lounge.

BERNIE

(to himself)

Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'...

CUT TO:

BRIDGE CUT TO:

SHELLY

Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't

know you were coming in...

NICKY

(shakes his head)

Whassimater? You think I don't wash

up after goin' to the John? Forget

about it.

SHELLY

(uncomfortably)

You shoulda called ahead. I woulda

sent a car...

NICKY

Ehh. We thought we'd surprise you.

SHELLY

Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.

NICKY

Shelly, I want you to meet one of

our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And

his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

LARRY

How do you do, Shelly?

SHELLY

What can I get you boys to drink?

SHELLY

So... what brings you to town, Nicky?

NICKY

Look, Shelly, this is your joint,

you run it the way you see fit. But

we got a smart kid here and he's got

some good ideas on how to revitalize

the Shangri-la.

SHELLY

Revitalize? What are you talking

about? We did thirty-five million

last year.

LARRY

First off, Shelly, I want you to

know, I have nothing but respect for

you. You've done a fantastic job

with the Shangri-la for the last

sixteen years. No one would dispute

that.

NICKY

Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.

LARRY

But, the business has changed out

here. You just have to take a look

at the Strip to see what I'm talking

about.

SHELLY

You mean, that amusement park mook

fest out there? You know what that

is? That's a fucking violation of

something that used to be beautiful.

That used to have class. Like a

gorgeous high priced hooker with an

exclusive clientele. And then that

Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up

and puts her in a family way.

SHELLY

Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat

whore hiding behind too much makeup.

I look at her and see all those ugly

stretch marks and I want to cry.

'Cause I remember her as she was.

LARRY

Yes, well... there's no denying the

bottom line. Those eyesores are raking

it in. And we can't compete against

that.

SHELLY

What? You think I'm trying to compete

with that? You think this joint's

about bringing in the stroller crowd?

Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride,

looking to break the house on red

and black. Fremont's never been about

that bullshit. This is where old

time and real money comes to play.

LARRY

The numbers, they don't back you up,

Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all

love nostalgia -- but it belongs in

a museum. I think it's time to decide

whether you're running a museum or a

casino.

NICKY

Hey, forget about it. We'll talk

later. Over dinner.

MARTY

(rubs his hands

together)

So, how's the action?

SHELLY

Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?

BERNIE

I was just heading over to --

SHELLY

It can wait.

SHELLY

How's the knee?

SHELLY

I was speaking to this orthopedic

surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He

tells me they can replace a man's

entire kneecap with titanium. It's

the kinda thing that costs a shitload,

but since the man's into us for five

hundred large, I'm sure we could --

BERNIE

(stealing glances at

Natalie)

I told you, I'm not gonna be around

after Sunday.

SHELLY

(sighs)

Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where

the fuck are you gonna go that's

better'n here? I got you covered in

this town. People, they know you

work for me, that's currency in your

pocket. That's fuckin' respect when

you walk the floor. Where you gonna

get that anyplace else?

BERNIE

(sighs)

Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and

I'm out from under.

SHELLY

That's right. I like to know who's

shopping it in my neighborhood. You

wanna keep working the Shangri-la,

you come see me tomorrow morning in

my office. We'll go over the rules

together. And before you come, you

bring me a clean bill of health. OK?

SHELLY

All right, get outta here.

SHELLY

You want that, Bernie? She's yours.

Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for

you.

(Bernie shakes his

head)

What's a matter? Not your type?

BERNIE

Things are getting hot on fourteen.

I gotta go.

HOOKER (O.S.)

...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh

yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me

harder, you big stud... Oooooh...

NATALIE

Seven and Seven?

PINKERTON

Thanks, dollface.

NATALIE

Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz.

BERNIE

It's all right. Happens.

NATALIE

Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands,

you know...

BERNIE

S'okay. You might want to stick

around.

STICKMAN

Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have

no hard eight.

PINKERTON

(throwing in a chip)

Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.

STICKMAN

Eight the hard way!

STICKMAN

Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.

PINKERTON

Parlay! Parlay!

PINKERTON

C'mon. You can take that action.

PINKERTON

That's what I'm talking about. None

of this low limit bullshit.

BERNIE

Dollar hard eight.

STICKMAN

Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight

comes down.

PINKERTON

Five hundred dollar hard eight. And

press my nine up two units.

STICKMAN

Easy way eight! Eight easy!

PINKERTON

Hard eight.

PLAYER (O.S.)

Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.

STICKMAN

Seven out!

PINKERTON

What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?

BUDDY

Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment

tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me

into going on.

(massages his throat)

It's definitely strep.

SHELLY

You were velvet out there, pops.

Silk.

SHELLY

They were hanging on the door outside.

Forget your tonsils. When the muff

confetti stops coming, that's when

you got yourself a problem.

BUDDY

(dangling the panties

on his finger)

You get a receipt?

SHELLY

Excuse me?

BUDDY

Charmayne's in the lobby. They got

these on sale in the window. Victoria

Secret's Valentine's Collection. And

the broad waiting in the room, what

she set you back? Always Grade-A for

Ol' Buddy.

SHELLY

Are you kidding me? Gimme that.

(snatches the panties

away from Buddy)

You don't fucking deserve this. All

those ladies going home with a sweet

breeze between their legs because

you still do it for them and you're

fingering me for some kinda Buddy

Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you,

old man.

BUDDY

(affectionately)

Get back here, you prick. Hand it

over.

BUDDY

Whassimatter, kid? You got that

Nostradamus look.

BUDDY

You ever watch those nature shows on

TV?

BUDDY

I've seen this one a dozen times.

It's about lions. Cycle of life thing.

The leader of the pack...

SHELLY

Pride. It's called a pride.

BUDDY

Yeah, pride. The leader of the

pride... when he gets on in years.

It's just a matter of time before

some young male arrives on the scene

to challenge him. They go at it and

the old cat gets the crap beaten

outta him. It's humiliating. In front

of all the females, this goes down.

And after he's defeated, he's cast

out of the pride, to scavenge and

die alone in the bush.

SHELLY

Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense

of humor.

BUDDY

No shit. It's fucking tragic because

the old lion can't figure it out on

his own. That he's past it. It'd be

so much easier for him to just walk

away and save himself all that pain

and humiliation.

SHELLY

That's like admitting to yourself

that you're already dead. I prefer

nature's way.

BUDDY

(a beat)

Yeah. Me, too.

LARRY

Shelly, got a minute...

LARRY

Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.

JOHNNY

How ya doin', Shelly?

SHELLY

I know you from somewhere, right?

LARRY

Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz

at the Mirage. Sony's talking about

signing him to a three album deal.

They're positioning him as the new

Ricki Martin.

SHELLY

And I should be interested in this,

why?

LARRY

Johnny's looking to headline. I told

him we might be interested.

SHELLY

(icy)

We?

JOHNNY

Hey, if this is a bad time...

SHELLY

Even if I were interested, Buddy's

got ink with us through 2003. I just

renegotiated his contract last year.

JOHNNY

Sounds like the two of you need to

get on the same page.

(to Larry)

If I don't hear from you by Thursday,

I'm taking the Stardust's offer.

NICKY

Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old

fart a drink.

SHELLY

Buddy asked me to send you his

regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so

great. I think he's got that stomach

flu that's going around.

NICKY

Oh yeah? That's too bad.

(Shelly isn't fooling

him)

Well, another time then.

MARTY

Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be

able to hook us up with some

showgirls. Something with class.

SHELLY

Sure, no problem. You got any

preferences?

NICKY

(jumps in)

Yeah. Something with big headlights,

nice rims and low mileage.

MARTY

You got any Asian babes?

LARRY

I think I'll just stick with the

tables.

NATALIE

Buy you a drink?

CUT TO:

NATALIE

(almost to herself)

Your Progressed Venus is Gemini,

12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion.

Which tells me that you're a slow

starter when it comes to romance.

(off Bernie's taken

aback expression)

You know what? This is real

unprofessional of me. I shouldn't

discuss your chart with you until

I'm all done. I can tell by that

look, you think this is all a lot of

B.S.

BERNIE

No... I just know what the outcome's

going to be.

NATALIE

The outcome? There's not, like, one

particular outcome. A lot of things

enter into it. The planets, moon

phases...

BERNIE

The outcome won't change with me.

It'll be all bad.

NATALIE

God, I have never met anyone who was

so down on themselves. I used to be

down on myself, OK? I don't go there

anymore. I've got just three more

correspondence classes with this

stuff, then I'll have my certificate

and everything. And you know how I

got OK?

BERNIE

(deadpan)

You had your chart done.

NATALIE

Yes, as a matter of fact that is

perfectly correct.

BERNIE

Do you know what I do at the Shangri-

la?

NATALIE

I asked around. You're a "cooler."

You turn winners into losers.

BERNIE

And do you know how I do that?

NATALIE

I know there's stuff that goes on in

casinos all the time --

BERNIE

I do it by being myself. People get

next to me and their luck turns.

It's always been that way.

NATALIE

That sounds to me like a self

fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole

chapter on that in my course. Anyways,

I can see a big factor in your life

is that you're lacking companionship.

There's nobody to deflect off. If

you've got, as you put it, bad karma,

then you need someone with good karma

to neutralize it. Well, that's my

take on it anyway.

BERNIE

I don't know about you, but I'm real

tired.

NATALIE

I have this recurring dream where

I'm on some beautiful island in the

Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach,

taking in this amazing sunset with

one of these in my hand

(gestures to her drink)

...and then it starts to rain. And I

wake up and it's my roof leaking on

me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie.

BERNIE

(not even sure why

he's telling her

this)

I only got six more days. Well, almost

five really. Then I'll be leaving

town.

NATALIE

Only five more days?

(a beat)

Then we shouldn't waste any more

time.

NATALIE

Why don't we go back to your place?

BERNIE

(completely caught

off-guard)

I, uh... If this is... I don't know...

I don't know if I can afford...

BERNIE

Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't

mean... You see -- that's exactly

what I'm talking about. I've gone

and "cooled" the damn table.

NATALIE

Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't

gone and cooled anything. Not by a

long shot.

NATALIE

You should complain about this.

BERNIE

I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry,

all I got's gin.

NATALIE

Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead.

NATALIE

You know, once they're dead, they

don't really grow back. In case,

that's what you're waiting for.

NATALIE

So... got any music?

NATALIE

Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least

one of us has done this before.

BERNIE

This is not my first --

NATALIE

Sssh. Surprise me.

NATALIE

You're doing real good.

BERNIE

Sorry...

NATALIE

Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse.

We'll try again later.

NATALIE

Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?

BERNIE (V.O.)

-- I did six months at Rikers for

running numbers. It was Shelly's

thing, but I took the rap for it.

BERNIE

After I get out, I call up Shelly

and he tells me to come out here. I

figure he's going to set me up good

at the Shangri-la. But he tells me

they got all these rules about casinos

employing felons. So he gets me this

gig doing telemarketing for one of

their fronts -- trying to scam

pensioners out of their retirement

money. I lasted two weeks.

BERNIE

Already, I was getting in deep.

Finally it got so bad, I had to beg

Shelly to take on my markers around

town. That just bought me more time

to keep losing. I put Shelly in an

awkward position. I understand why

he did what he did.

(taps his knee)

NATALIE

He did that to you? What, he shot

you?

BERNIE

Baseball bat.

(off her cringing

expression)

I got off easy.

NATALIE

That's getting off easy?

BERNIE

I was out of control.

NATALIE

But he maimed you...

BERNIE

Let me tell you something. I'm

grateful for what he did.

(off her stunned look)

No kidding. Every time I get an urge

to play off the clock -- to so much

as drop a quarter in a slot -- I

reach down and squeeze what's left

of my cartilage. It's one helluva

reminder.

NATALIE

Jesus... I thought stuff like that

didn't happen no more. Like that was

just in the movies or something.

BERNIE

Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a

payment plan. Two years off the books

at the Shangri-la, cooling tables.

Five more days and I walk.

PREGNANT GIRL

(clutching her belly)

Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor!

BERNIE

(shocked)

Mikey?

MIKEY

Bernie...

PREGNANT GIRL

I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks.

BERNIE

Mikey? Is that...? You're not the...

MIKEY

(nods)

Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs

in the family. I guess you're gonna

be a grandfather, Bernie.

BERNIE

This you?

MIKEY

Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways,

we gotta be somewhere...

BERNIE

How's your mom doing?

MIKEY

I'm gonna pretend like you give a

shit and tell you, she's getting by.

As long as she's wasted.

MIKEY

Name's Charlene, in case you were

wondering. Looks like she's carrying

a whole litter in there, don't it?

NATALIE

When was the last time you saw a

doctor?

CHARLENE

This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six

months ago. I wasn't about to go

back after they treated me like

cattle. Just because I didn't have

no insurance. And those places,

they're crawling with T.B. from all

'em spies.

BERNIE

So, you're in town...?

MIKEY

Maybe a week or so. Got some business

to take care of.

BERNIE

If you want, stop by the Lucky Star

Motel. Give us a chance to catch up.

I'm on three to eleven shift at the

Shangri-la. I work the floor.

MIKEY

No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah,

maybe I'll do that. We can play catch

up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split.

NATALIE

(to Charlene)

Take care.

PLAYER

Thanks...

BERNIE

Don't mention it.

DEALER

(he knows the routine)

Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.

DEALER

Money plays one hundred.

PLAYER

(to Bernie)

No offense, pal, but there's twenty

other tables. What do you wanna come

sit on my head for?

BERNIE

Just wanna play one hand. Feeling

lucky tonight. I got this voice in

my head, says this is the table...

PLAYER

I know this is the table. I'm already

doing good here. It's my fucking

table --

BERNIE

(touching him)

Hey, heard the one about the fella

walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who

owns that big great dane outside?" A

man at the end of the bar raises his

hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah?

Well, my dog just killed it."

BERNIE

"Whaddya mean your dog just killed

my great dane? What kinda dog you

have?" The fella just shrugs and

says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me

your chihuahua just killed my great

dane? How?"

(a beat)

"I dunno," the fella says, "I think

he got stuck in his throat."

DEALER

Insurance?

PLAYER

God damnit!

PLAYER

You said, one hand.

BERNIE

(agitated; to dealer)

Keep going.

PLAYER

Hey, stick around, pal. You and me,

we make a great team.

SHELLY

What was that?

SHELLY

Well, what fucking gives? Is it

McGann? He's been with us twelve

years. The man's as standup as my

dick.

(thinking to himself)

Maybe he's got money problems. I'm

gonna pull him. He wasn't counting

'em, was he? The mook with the streak?

LARRY

Is there a problem?

SHELLY

(zero tolerance)

No, there's no problem. Fella's on a

streak, is all.

LARRY

(re: Bernie)

Let me guess? This is one of your

"coolers?"

SHELLY

Why don't you announce it to the

whole fucking joint?

LARRY

(lowers his voice)

Man, they told me you were a stickler

for the old ways. But coolers? What

is this guy, some kind of degenerate

gambler? Reformed card shark? He

doesn't look too effective to me.

SHELLY

He's the best. Take it from me.

LARRY

Sure. Whatever. But there ways --

subtle ways -- to keep things in our

favor. I'm talking more forward

thinking methods.

SHELLY

That right? I suppose you got a whole

fucking prospectus on the subject.

LARRY

As a matter of fact I do. Like, right

off the bat, I can tell you this

wallpaper isn't going to cut it.

It's too uplifting. I would go with

more muted tones.

SHELLY

Yeah? Wallpaper?

LARRY

And personally, I think the waitresses

can all pop another button or two.

Myself, I wouldn't hire anything

less than a C cup.

LARRY

Know what this is? Music to be sure.

Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended

in at a subsonic level is a mantra.

"Lose... lose... lose." And that's

just skimming the surface. We really

need to talk, Shelly.

MORRIE

Shelly, you better come quick.

SHELLY

(to Morrie)

Get a hold of his daughter. Assist

her with the arrangements. The Shangri-

la will take care of everything.

MORRIE

What about the Paradise?

SHELLY

She goes dark tonight.

LARRY

That won't be necessary.

RING TOSS WORKER

Over here, young lady! C'mon, give

it a try. Eight for a dollar.

RING TOSS WORKER

Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck

next time. Wanna try again?

NATALIE

What?

BERNIE

Nothing.

NATALIE

What?

BERNIE

Nothing. You're just an easy mark,

is all.

NATALIE

An easy mark?

BERNIE

Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard

that term?

BERNIE

When we were kids, Shelly and me, we

used to work Coney Island during the

summer. When a guy would walk up and

seemed eager to open his wallet, we

would always mark him with chalk.

We'd pat him on the back or arm with

the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good

job!'

(pats Natalie)

Meanwhile, he had no clue the other

guys saw him coming a mile away.

Easy mark.

BERNIE

You OK?

NATALIE

You notice last night, that tattoo

on my butt?

BERNIE

(are you kidding?!)

Little Joe.

NATALIE

Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.

NATALIE

I had a son. His name was Joe. I was

his mother for a year.

BERNIE

You know, you don't have to tell me

this.

NATALIE

I want to, Bernie. Better you know

the worst of me up front. Later,

when I'm already invested in you,

it'll be too hard to come clean.

After I tell you this, you'll

probably... I mean, I'll understand.

NATALIE

I gave my son up for adoption. I

just wanted my life back. I was

seventeen going on eighteen and I

was selfish. My family, they didn't

want to have nothing to do with me

after that. So I hitched a ride out

here. Figured I could make it as a

showgirl. Ten years later...

(shrugs; starts to

break up)

I like to think that if it happened

when I was older -- with some guy I

cared about -- maybe things would

have been different. I think about

my Little Joe. And, I do know he's

better off. I'm convinced of that.

BERNIE

So, you wanna go try your hand at

the dime pitch? It's early still.

CUT TO:

CHARLENE

I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing.

NATALIE

(to Mikey)

How did you get in here?

MIKEY

I told the desk clerk Bernie was my

old man. He let us wait inside. That

a problem?

NATALIE

Bernie's looking for a parking space.

MIKEY

(chuckles)

Shit. I musta taken the last one.

MIKEY

Tell me something, Natalie? Is he

paying you?

NATALIE

Excuse me?

MIKEY

My old man, is he renting your ass?

'Cause otherwise I just don't get

it. A loser like my pops in the

company of some primo T & A. It don't

compute.

MIKEY

This enough to get me a taste? Family

discount?

BERNIE

Mikey...

MIKEY

Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna

stop by.

BERNIE

Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead.

We were out at breakfast.

NATALIE

You missed some.

MIKEY

You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're

kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's

expecting like yesterday, and we

don't have the dough to make with

the right nutrition for her an' all.

So, I was wondering if you would

care to invest a little in your

grandchild's future... his well being.

BERNIE

There's about three grand there.

That's all I got.

CHARLENE

Bless you, Bernie.

(pats her belly)

You know, Michael, I  -- think we

should name her Bernadette. After

your father.

MIKEY

You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a

boy.

CHARLENE

(to Bernie)

Wanna feel her?

BERNIE

I don't think... I don't want anything

to hap...

CHARLENE

Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon,

Bernie, gimme your hand...

CHARLENE

Feel that?

BERNIE

(not sure)

I don't know... I think so...

MIKEY

We'll catch you later, Bernie. I

think I'm gonna take Charly over to

the hospital right now. Get her

checked up real good.

CHARLENE

Take care, Pop.

BERNIE

Mikey...

BERNIE

You're not going to try anything

stupid while you're in town?

BERNIE

You mess up and they'll cut you no

slack. That's all I'm saying. You

got a kid to think about.

NICKY

Shelly, I hope you don't mind...

SHELLY

What's going on, Nicky?

NICKY

I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about

this earlier... but the deal wasn't

closed yet.

MARTY

Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna

love it.

NICKY

The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino.

We break ground on her in six months.

NICKY

I know what you're thinking? Where's

she gonna go? You need space to

expand, right? Well, that's been

taken care of. We're now the proud

owners of The Golden Frontier next

door.

LARRY

(gesturing to the

model)

She's perfect. Three floors of gaming,

IMAX theater, entertainment center,

boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster,

you name it. She'll pay for herself

in three years, and then it's easy

money.

NICKY

Isn't she great, Shell?

SHELLY

In "Lost Horizon," these people,

their plane crashes in the Himalayas --

and they get rescued and taken to

this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri-

la. It's beautiful. The place is

completely isolated. Untouched by

the outside world. There's no war,

no greed, no bullshit... Time is

slowed down. People, they don't age.

It's... paradise. That's what Shangri-

la is. Paradise.

LARRY

Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And

your point is?

SHELLY

You don't fuck with paradise! All'a

ya!

NICKY

Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not

trying to fuck with it. We're trying

to make it better.

SHELLY

How... how, Nicky, could it be any

better? Right now it's perfect. It's

the last of its kind. It's pure...

and this.

(points to the model;

weary)

...this is just... it's a mockery.

An insult. Trying to make something

of it that it isn't.

LARRY

What are you talking about? It's

right outta the movie?

SHELLY

Whose talking about a fuckin' movie?

This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is

my life. This is my house of worship.

You people are shittin' on all that's

sacred to me.

SHELLY

(tired laugh)

I got just one question? Where you

gonna be when they decide to change

it back? When the people, they come

looking for the real Vegas, from

before all this Epcott Center

bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to

them? You guys? I don't think so.

You know who? The same fucks who

started this shit in the first place.

It's all gonna come full circle and

bite you in the ass. Mark my words.

NICKY

You make some good points, Shelly.

Maybe it'll swing back the other

way, who knows? But the smart money

suggests we roll the dice. I'm not

gonna bullshit you; naturally there's

gonna be a lot of restructuring in

the months to come, but I want you

to know, you'll always have a place

with us.

SHELLY

Where's that? Behind the bar?

MARTY

(laughs)

Behind the bar, that's a good one.

NICKY

I think you should take some time

and think things through. All this,

it's a lot to digest, y'know.

MARTY

Speaking of things to digest, I'm

starving. How's that buffet they got

in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You

recommend their prime rib, Shell?

SHELLY

It's food.

NICKY

Hey, my arteries can use a workout.

Lead us to the trough, Shell.

NICKY

Wait up a second...

MARTY

I thought we were gonna eat?

SHELLY

Maybe we wanna play over there. Less

crowded.

NICKY

Nah, let's play here. This is my

lucky table. I always play here.

(to the others)

Go on ahead. I know where to find

you guys.

STICKMAN

Out! Seven, line away seven...

SUBURBANITE

C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda

paid my mortgage with the money I

just lost.

SHOOTER

Hey? I'm supposed to be next...

NICKY

File a grievance, shithead.

STICKMAN

We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any

seven.

NICKY

Hundred dollar big red.

SUBURBANITE

Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's

getting cold.

STICKMAN

Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.

SUBURBANITE

Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try

shuffleboard.

SUBURBANITE

Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction.

STICKMAN

Four, hard four. The point is four.

SUBURBANITE

Good now throw it before you fucking

keel over and die, old man.

SUBURBANITE

Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday

to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another

year older already.

STICKMAN

OUT! Seven! Line away.

SUBURBANITE

Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody

craps out.

SUBURBANITE

Now go change your fucking Depends.

NICKY

Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin!

prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya

fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no-

dick, suburbanite scum. How's that

for a game?!

NICKY

That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks

up my game like that. Who the fuck

does he think he is?

SHELLY

You're right. He's just a piece of

shit. Forget about him.

NICKY

I thought this joint had more class.

Used to be, we wouldn't even let

bums like that in...

BERNIE

This town... You know, Natalie, all

I want to do is go some place where

I can tell day from night. Where

they got clocks on the wall. I can't

breathe around here no more. Four

days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure

I can hold out that long.

NATALIE

(a beat)

So where does that leave us?

BERNIE

A week ago, I didn't remember what

it was like to have a woman's hands

on me. I'm still pinching myself,

expecting to wake-up from...

(just blurts it out)

Come with me, Natalie. I want you to

come with me.

NATALIE

God, Bernie, that's...

BERNIE

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring

that on you.

NATALIE

Bernie... I want to be with you. I

do. But I don't know if I can leave

with you.

NATALIE

I was working on a compatibility

chart for the two of us. And it looks

good, really, it does.

BERNIE

So, what's the problem?

NATALIE

That's with us here. In Vegas.

NATALIE

Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause

I knew you were leaving... and I

tried working it in different ways...

It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared.

But that's just for now, for the

immediate future. Once the planets

realign, maybe a year from now...

BERNIE

Natalie... I can't... Not another

year. Not another week.

BERNIE

I think... we probably shouldn't see

each other anymore.

NATALIE

Why, Bernie? We only got a couple

days left together. Why not make the

most of them?

BERNIE

(a long beat)

Because if I spend one more night in

your arms, I'm not going anywhere.

NATALIE

And that's so bad?

NATALIE

Take care, Bernie.

BERNIE

Natalie, don't...

WAITRESS (O.S.)

Get you another?

BERNIE

(nods)

I think you better bring me the

bottle. Please.

VOICE (V.O.)

Chang, party of fifteen, your table

is ready, Chang party of fifteen.

CHARLENE

(clutching her tummy)

Come on, Mikey. This is our future.

Don't blow it.

MIKEY

Put this on the line for the boys.

MIKEY

With shoes!

STICKMAN

Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the

dice are out! The point is nine.

CHARLENE

Come on all you's. Put a good thought

in for our baby!

STICKMAN

Six the hard way!

CHARLENE

Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He

knows. He knows you're all pulling

for him. God bless you all.

STICKMAN

Six the hard way! Look out, we got a

shooter!

SHELLY

How much?

BERNIE

Eighteen thousand since I stepped

up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've

been hit and miss lately.

SHELLY

(sotto)

Fucking amateurs...

STICKMAN

Seven out! Line away.

MIKEY

(bowing)

I thank you. My wife thanks you. My

unborn child thanks you.

MIKEY

Color me up will ya?

LARRY

You've gotta be kidding me.

(off Shelly's steely

glare)

That's not how I propose we handle

it. We'll turn the matter over to

the authorities. They'll be

blacklisted, their credit ruined...

SHELLY

(gets in Larry's face)

And then we'll give 'em both a

lollipop for the ride home. Come

watch and learn, Harvard. A little

lesson on how to protect your

investment -- the old school way.

SHELLY

Hey, that was some run you had back

there.

MIKEY

Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.

SHELLY

Why don't we go do this in my office?

I don't like to hand out all this

amount of cash on the floor.

CHARLENE

Oh my God... I can feel the

contractions coming on...

BERNIE

Shelly, stop them! Don't do this!

SHELLY

Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing

to do with you.

BERNIE

It's got everything to do with me.

He's my son.

SHELLY

What did you say?

BERNIE

I said, he's my --

SHELLY

Who? This little prick?

MIKEY

Pop, help me...

BERNIE

Shelly, don't you fucking do it!

SHELLY

Were you in on this? Jesus, you better

come clean with me.

BERNIE

NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing

about it.

SHELLY

How much you think their lives are

worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think

they're worth piss. But, hey, it

ain't my kid...

SHELLY

Let me see: they were up almost a

hundred and fifty grand. That's 150

G's someone's gonna have to account

for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy-

five grand a piece?

SHELLY

Hey, I know you don't have that kind

of cash. But, since you're a friend

of the house, I'm willing to front

you.

BERNIE

Shelly, they didn't get away with

the money... You didn't lose

anything...

BERNIE

Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on

me. 150 G's.

CHARLENE

Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me

to the hospital... contractions...

BERNIE

Shelly, please help her. That's my

grandson...

SHELLY

Hey, why don't we all break out the

champagne? Lootz is about to become

a granddaddy.

(walks over to her)

How you doin' there, sweetheart?

Must hurt like crap, huh?

CHARLENE

(nods)

Hurts so bad...

SHELLY

Yeah?

NATALIE

Oh God...

BERNIE

Jesus NOOOOO!!!

SHELLY

Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got

a cigar?

SHELLY

(to Bernie)

You sure you still want to be good

for it? Because if you want to change

your mind, I don't blame you.

MIKEY

I'll make it up to you, Pop, I

swear...

BERNIE

It's on me.

SHELLY

(shakes his head)

That's the worst fucking call you

ever made in your life.

BERNIE

What are you doing?! I thought we

had --

SHELLY

150 G's buys their lives. This is

just a little slap on the wrist to

remember me by.

CHARLENE

Oh god... it wasn't my idea.

SHELLY

You know, motherhood is a beautiful

thing. This... you made a mockery

out of it. Maybe you'll get to

experience it for real one day.

CHARLENE

(nods, sobbing)

I want... to be a mother... please

don't hurt me...

SHELLY

I'm not going to hurt you.

SHELLY

(to Tony and Lou)

Get 'em outta here. You ever see

them in this joint again, kill 'em.

SHELLY

(to Bernie and Natalie)

You two, you're still on shift.

BERNIE

I did this to myself. I planted the

seed. When Angela took off with Mikey,

I didn't... I never made an effort

to get back in his life. I figured,

the kid don't need a loser for a

father. Now it's all come full circle.

I give him the money, I open the

door to all this... I musta had it

coming. Payback.

NATALIE

Bernie, it's a big world out there.

If you just took off -- if we took

off.

DISSOLVE TO:

NATALIE

You awake, Bernie?

NATALIE

I -- think I love you.

NATALIE

No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain

of it.

NATALIE

You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I

never saw this coming. You shouldn't

do that to a girl.

NATALIE

There's still things you don't know...

should know... I don't want to ruin

it...

BERNIE

It won't make any difference, Natalie.

Whatever you come clean about, I'm

not gonna feel any different about

you. I'd say the words, but with my

luck...

NATALIE

Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten

luck. That's overs.

BERNIE

(a beat)

I love you, Natalie.

BERNIE

Trixie?

BERNIE

Trix. You came back.

SMASH CUT TO:

SHELLY

(into phone)

Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to

crap table six.

BERNIE

(looking around)

Got any cre --

VOICE (V.O.)

Lovett, party of six, your table is

ready, Lovett, party of six.

BERNIE

Duty calls.

FLOOR MANAGER

Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new

Mega-Million. I call her Marnie,

'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure,

once in a while she'll flash you a

bit of tit, but your chances of

hitting a home run -- one in twenty

million. Here, give her a shot...

SHELLY

(feeding Marnie

quarters)

You wanna tell me what's going on

out there?

BERNIE

I don't know...

SHELLY

What do you mean...

SHELLY

(reacts with surprise)

What do you mean, you don't know?

We're down almost a mil out there.

Doesn't seem strange to you?

BERNIE

(shrugs)

Guess I'm having an off day.

SHELLY

You don't have off days, Lootz. You're

shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong?

You coming down with something? You've

got this look about you...

BERNIE

Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never

felt better.

SHELLY

What's that supposed to mean?

BERNIE

She loves me, Shelly. She told me

last night. Natalie.

FLOOR MANAGER

Sweet Jesus... you popped her

cherries.

SHELLY

Natalie? She told you, she loves

you?

SHELLY

Put that fucking thing out!

NATALIE

Sorry.

SHELLY

You should be. You've gone and fucked

it up big time. I paid you to be his

cooze companion, not his fucking

true love. But, no, you had to go

and get all profound on the poor

schmuck.

(mimics female voice)

"I love you, Bernie." You know what

you've gone and done, sweetheart?

Those four little words of endearment

have already cost this casino a

million and counting today.

NATALIE

I don't understand...

SHELLY

(jumps to his feet)

Lady luck. You never heard'a lady

luck?! That's what's goin' on out

there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick.

He should have 'em throwing ice cubes

out there, but instead I got a fuckin'

meltdown on my hands.

SHELLY

OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're

outta his life by the time he gets

home. Don't even tell him to his

face, just leave a note. I'll make

some calls, situate you at another

joint.

NATALIE

I can't do that.

SHELLY

(right in her face)

Excuse me?

NATALIE

It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love

him.

SHELLY

(close to losing it)

What's there to fuckin' love? He's a

loser. Always has been, always will

be.

NATALIE

I thought you were his friend...

SHELLY

And I thought you were a smart cookie

when I picked you out. You do not

want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll

see to it that your next John's a

rattlesnake out in the desert. Now

get the fuck outta here.

BERNIE

Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around?

I'm supposed to give her a ride home.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS #1

I think she left already. She wasn't

feelin' too good. We been covering

for her.

BERNIE

(calls to the bathroom)

Natalie? You in there?

BERNIE

(sotto)

Natalie.

DISSOLVE TO:

BERNIE

I want you to tell me the truth,

Shelly. Did you say something to

Natalie? Did you muscle her --

SHELLY

Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think

of me? That I would fuck with your

happiness? That hurts.

BERNIE

This guy's all flash. No soul. I

miss Buddy. Place isn't the same

without him.

SHELLY

Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy

out. It coulda been a lot worse...

BERNIE

(confused)

You gave him an easy out? What are

you talkin' about? I thought he...

SHELLY

He woulda never taken the buy-out

offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his

guns, no matter what. And they woulda

ended up hurting him. I couldn't let

that happen.

BERNIE

Jesus... you... How can you sit here

and justify it? Like you were Dr.

Kevorkian or something?

SHELLY

Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I

loved that sonofabitch. But his time

was up. What I was supposed to do,

leave him to those corporate wolves?

What I did, it was the humanitarian

thing. That I have no doubt about.

Afterwards, I held him in my arms

and I cried like a fucking baby.

What? You got this look -- what's

this fucking look?

NATALIE

Bernie? You awake?

BERNIE

Yeah.

NATALIE

Let's just take off.

NATALIE

I mean it. Let's just pack up and

go. Tonight.

BERNIE

(closes his eyes)

I can't do that. I've got an

obligation to Shelly. There's no --

NATALIE

Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit

about you. Let's just climb into

your car and get the hell out of

here.

BERNIE

I can't do that, Natalie. They'd

come after me. And because you were

with me... I wouldn't want that on

me.

NATALIE

Just hold me.

NATALIE

Hey! Ouch! What are you...?

NATALIE

You got no fucking right...!

SHELLY

What did I tell you?! What did I

fuckin' tell you?!

NATALIE

I tried... I couldn't...

SHELLY

I don't give a fuck!

SHELLY

You're gone, sweetheart. History.

Kiss paradise goodbye.

NATALIE

(hysterical)

I can't leave! I won't! I love him.

Doesn't that mean anything to you,

you heartless fuck?

SHELLY

Who the fuck do you think you are?

You ain't nobody! I could make you

disappear like this...

(snaps his fingers)

And nobody would ever notice you

were gone. Nobody!

NATALIE

(yells)

Bernie would! I got friends! You

don't fuckin' own me. You got no

right --

NATALIE

Fuck you!

SHELLY

You fuckin' cunt...

SHELLY

You think that's bad? That's just a

taste, bitch. You're still here when

Bernie gets home and I'll finish the

job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin'

pieces, the vultures'll be trading

on you for a month.

SHELLY

Here... go get yourself some cosmetic

surgery.

BERNIE

Natalie.

NATALIE (O.S.)

No, don't. I've got a headache.

BERNIE

(closing the door)

Did you take something? I got some

aspirin in the --

NATALIE

Yeah. I already took something.

BERNIE

Ouch!

BERNIE

Natalie, what happened? The mirror...

BERNIE

Natalie.

NATALIE

Bernie, no! Shit...

BERNIE

Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to

you? We need to call the police...

NATALIE

I love you, Bernie. I just want you

to know that. I fell in love with

you. That wasn't part of the plan. I

thought... easy money...

BERNIE

What are you saying?

NATALIE

Shelly. He paid me to get next to

you. To keep you around. Whatever it

took...

BERNIE

(a whisper)

Shelly?

NATALIE

You got it right the first night. I

was for sale. Bought and paid for.

You were the easy mark, Bernie.

NATALIE

At first you were just another John.

But then I started to take a closer

look. For the first time, here was

someone who wasn't trying to hustle

me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody

he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying

to get back on track. And it didn't

hurt any that you put me up on a

pedestal. It sure puts the gutter

into perspective...

BERNIE

(still in disbelief)

Shelly...

NATALIE

Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring

you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to

tell you to your face... and then

you wouldn't want me no more... and

I could just go...

BERNIE

We gotta get you to the hospital.

We'll talk about this later.

NATALIE

Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell

me there's gonna be a later.

BERNIE

Ssshh.

NATALIE

Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's

all gonna be okay.

BERNIE

Everything's gonna be fine. This is

our time. This is you and me and

we're going for it.

BERNIE

You look in the mirror, you don't

like what you see, don't believe it.

You look in my eyes. That's the only

mirror you gonna need. Look in my

eyes, Natalie.

BERNIE

I love you. Marry me?

CUT TO:

NATALIE

You don't have to do this, Bernie.

BERNIE

Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right

to his face. I will not look over my

shoulder for the rest of my life --

our lives.

NATALIE

Bernie, your chart... that first

night. I wasn't being straight with

you. It's the worst chart I've ever

seen. There's nothing in the cards

for you. I'm scared...

BERNIE

Don't you see, that was before you

opened your heart to me. Everything's

different now. I got lady luck on my

side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to

me.

NATALIE

It's three thousand dollars. Take

it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a

down payment. We can send him the

rest in installments... after we get

settled.

BERNIE

I don't think --

NATALIE

Take it.

BERNIE

Whatever happens, I --

NATALIE

(abrupt)

I know, Bernie.

NATALIE

(sotto; gentle)

I know.

SHELLY

Bernie, what's the matter? You look

a little fucking spooked.

BERNIE

You lay another finger on her, I

swear to God I'll kill you. You hear

me? I'll fuckin' kill you!

SHELLY

Will you excuse me for a moment?

BERNIE

(a hoarse whisper)

Why? Why, Shelly?

SHELLY

Because you never give up a good

thing, Bernie. You are a good thing.

The best fuckin' cooler there ever

was. And I need him back.

BERNIE

He ain't never comin' back.

SHELLY

That's a dead man talking.

BERNIE

I'm through with this joint, Shelly.

Natalie and me, we just got married.

We're outta here. I'll get a job out

there in the world. Send you half my

paycheck every month. Make good on

my obligations.

SHELLY

(gets in Bernie's

face)

You try to walk on me, Bernie, and

I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of

you.

BERNIE

I don't think so.

BERNIE

You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't

the world's biggest loser no more.

That honor's gonna fall upon you,

Shelly. And maybe you had it all

along.

SHELLY

What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser?

BERNIE

What you got? What do you got in

your life besides this joint?

SHELLY

What the fuck more do I need?

BERNIE

You got nothin', Shelly. This place --

your legacy -- it's a mirage. You

turn your back and it don't even

exist. There's no day, there's no

night, it's all just one big fuckin'

blur and it don't count for nothin'!

SHELLY

You believe this fuckin' guy?

BERNIE

I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you

got this fear of germs thing. But it

goes deeper than that. You can't get

close to no one. On an emotional

level. You're the worst kind of

gambler there ever was: too scared

to put his chips on the table. Too

scared to open his heart... to extend

any real kinda friendship. Always

afraid it's gonna end out in the

desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams,

pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's

where it ends, that's where it ends.

SHELLY

That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz.

All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face

intensity. You almost sold me.

(massages his throat)

Man, I've got a fucking lump in my

throat.

(a beat)

But it still don't change things.

You bail on me without making good

on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced

to close the books on you. You and

the broad. You leave me no choice.

BERNIE

Change only...

CROUPIER

Check change three thousand.

BOXMAN

This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?

BERNIE

You could say that.

BOXMAN

Well, it'll be a short one. Table's

dead.

CROUPIER

It is now, anyway.

STICKMAN

Yo Eleven! Pay the line.

STICKMAN

Winner seven!

STICKMAN

Six easy. Easy way six!

BERNIE

(sotto)

Natalie... this is you...

BERNIE

For the boys.

STICKMAN

Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO

bets, C&E, any seven...

TONY

Shelly, take a look at number 4.

SHELLY

(to the boxman)

How much is he up?

BOXMAN

Around three hundred thousand.

SHELLY

Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses

call me?

BOXMAN

We tried. You weren't picking up.

Besides, it was Bernie.

STICKMAN

Alright. We're coming out folks,

hands high...

BERNIE

Wait!

BERNIE

Color me up a hundred fifty thousand.

(beat)

And give it to him.

BERNIE

That's what I owe you, Shelly. There

it is. We're square.

(to the table)

Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives

up to his obligations.

BOXMAN

One hundred fifty thousand, coming

in.

LARRY

What's the matter with you? He's one

of ours and he's taking us to the

fucking cleaners.

SHELLY

Lootz's off the clock. As long as

he's off the clock, he's free to

play. Just like every other schmuck

in this joint.

LARRY

It smells wrong. I'm shutting him

down. He's not leaving here with a

dime --

SHELLY

Now you listen real good, you Harvard

turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He

leaves here tonight with whatever he

comes out with. You so much as touch

a hair on his head and I'll fucking

wallpaper this joint with your ass.

Muted tones, right?

(slams him hard)

What's that? I don't hear nothing.

Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear

it.

STICKMAN

Crap ace deuce! Line down!

STICKMAN

Call it.

CROUPIER

Twelve crap.

BERNIE

Fifty thousand dollars!

MAN (O.S.)

On the field? What're you fucking

nuts?

WOMAN (O.S.)

Don't do it!

MAN 2 (O.S.)

Shake it, don't break it, baby!

BERNIE

Come on sixty-six!

CUT TO:

NATALIE

Thank God... I thought for sure...

NATALIE

It's okay, right? You guys worked it

out. He took the three grand? Tell

me it's okay, Bernie?

LOU

Want me to get that, Shelly?

NATALIE

What are you stopping for?

BERNIE

I think I'm gonna...

BERNIE

Bahamas, here we come, baby.

COP

Step out of the car please.

BERNIE

(lowers the window)

What's the problem, officer?

COP

Just step out of the car, please.

Both of you.

BERNIE

If my driving... if I was going a

little fast -- I was just over

excited, officer. See, we just

had a big win at the Shangri-la --

COP

You didn't win nothing.

NATALIE

Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was

too good to be true. Who were we

kidding?

COP

Get down on your knees. Both of you.

NICKY

The kid wants you should know, Shelly,

he's just protecting our investment --

the old school way. See you around.

BERNIE

He was drunk. It was just freak

luck...

(catches himself...)

NATALIE

Don't give it a name, Bernie. It

scares me. All I know is, you're

still running hot and that's a good

thing. But we're only winners if we

keep going. No looking back.

BERNIE

Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it.

Lady luck. And we got it as long as

we're together. They can't touch us

now.

LARRY

Gentlemen...
