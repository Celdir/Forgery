MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

When I was sixteen years old I fell in

love...

- RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a

TED

Hey, Renise.

RENISE

Hey.

TED

So what's up?

RENISE

Eh.

TED

Great. Great.

(beat)

So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you

wanted to go to the prom you know, with

me.

TED (cont'd)

It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you

want.

RENISE

See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that

this guy I like was gonna ask me.

TED

Uh-huh.

RENISE

Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what

happens there...But that sounds great,

yeah.

TED

Okay.

(beat)

So is that a yes or a no?

RENISE

I think I was very clear, Ted. If

everything else falls apart, maybe.

TED

I'm gonna hold you to that.

CUT TO:

- a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our

little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two

years earlier.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she

had a faceful of eyes that promised you a

better life if you could only know her.

FRIEND #1

Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom

with?

TED

Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You

know, not my style.

FRIEND #2

You have a style?

FRIEND #1

Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

TED

(perks up)

Who?

FRIEND #1

Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you

spend enough fucking time with her.

TED

(out of ammo but doesn't

know it)

Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own

palm?

FRIEND #1

Clever. I like the way you just spun that

around on me.

FRIEND #2

I wonder who she's going with.

FRIEND #1

Some guy named Woogie.

TED

Who?

FRIEND #1

Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

TED

Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like

a loser.

FRIEND #1

Loser? Woogie was all-state football and

and basketball and valedictorian of his

class.

FRIEND #2

I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton

but he's going to Europe first to model.

FRIEND #3

Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

FRIEND #3 (cont'd)

I heard.

FRIEND #1

Hey, check it out.

EAR-MUFF GUY

You seen my baseball?

CAR HOOD KID #2

No.

EAR-MUFF GUY

You seen my baseball?

CAR HOOD KID #1

(to his buddies)

This guy must be in the 'tard squad.

(to Ear-Muff Guy)

Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where

your ball is.

EAR-MUFF GUY

You seen my baseball?

CAR HOOD KID #1

Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she

has it.

CAR HOOD KID #2 (cont'd)

'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball. She

has another name for it...

CUT TO:

- The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her

EAR-MUFF GUY

You seen my pecker?

GIRL

What?!

EAR-MUFF GUY

You seen my pecker?

BOYFRIEND

You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

TED

Take it easy, Smokey.

BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY

This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

TED

All right, just be cool.

(under breath)

He looks like he's not all there, you know

what I mean?

BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY

Get the fuck out of my way, man!

MARY

What's going on here?

MARY (cont'd)

Are you all right?

EAR-MUFF GUY

Mary, you seen my baseball?

MARY

No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,

Warren, you know you're not supposed to

leave the yard by yourself.

BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY

(to Mary)

You know him?

MARY

He's my brother.

BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY

Oh.

(beat)

I didn't realize he was...you know...

MARY

You okay?

- Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes

TED

Oh yeah. Fine.

MARY

Thanks a lot, Ted.

- Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of

my best friends didn't know my name.

MARY

Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt

yourself?

TED

No, it's an old football injury.

MARY

Oh, are you on the team?

TED

No, a couple of the players and me were

joking around and, uh, I fell off the

school.

WARREN

Piggyback ride?

MARY

Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

WARREN

Piggyback ride.

TED

(to Mary)

I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

MARY

Oh he can hold you. He weighs

two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

TED

A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

TED (cont'd)

Giddy-up.

WARREN

My turn now.

CUT TO:

TED

(straining)

We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

WARREN

Giddy-up.

MARY

So who you taking to the prom?

TED

Huh?

MARY

The prom--you going?

TED

Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty

dumb.

MARY

'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go

if you weren't already taking someone.

TED

I mean dumb in the sense that they only

happen once a year.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

From that moment on the guys at school

looked at me in a whole new light.

CUT TO:

FRIEND #1

You're a fucking liar!

- Ted is leaning against his locker

FRIEND #2

You expect us to believe you're going to

the prom with Mary? What about Woogie?

TED

They broke up. She said he started getting

weird on her.

FRIEND #1

I got twenty bucks says you're full of

shit.

TED

Oh come on, why would I lie?

FRIEND #1

Because you're a loser, and in some warped

way this gives you a momentary sense of

worth.

FRIEND #2

Put me down for fifty.

FRIEND #3

I'm in.

CUT TO:

MARY'S DAD

Yeah? What do you want?

TED

Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take

Mary to the prom.

MARY'S DAD

Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She

just left for the prom with her boyfriend

Woogie.

MARY'S MOM

Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.

Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a

joke a minute.

TED

Oh.

(relieved)

Oh, that's a good one.

TED

Hey, Warren.

MARY

Hi, Ted.

TED

Hi, Mary.

MARY'S MOM

Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both

barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

MARY

Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

MARY (cont'd)

Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

WARREN

(not looking up)

'Bout ten times.

TED

Hey, Warren, I think I know where your

baseball is.

WARREN

You seen my baseball?

TED

Well, if it's a big white one with red

stitching, I think I saw it right behind

your ear ..

MARY

Warren!!!

- as it rolls under the couch, stopping right

- In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and

MARY'S DAD

(to Ted)

What the hell are you doing?!

MARY'S MOM

Teddy, let him go!

TED

(out of breath)

I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

MARY'S DAD (cont'd)

(to Ted)

Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you

doing?!

TED

I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a

baseball.

MARY'S MOM

What baseball? Where's a baseball?

TED

There was a ball I had a honest.

MARY (to Ted)

I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a

thing about his ears.

TED

Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

MARY

Are you all right?

TED

Oh yeah.

MARY'S MOM

(to Mary)

Honey, now you're all wrinkled.

MARY

Ted, will you just give me one more minute?

I have to iron this thing.

TED

(to Mary's Dad)

May I use your bathroom?

- two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.

TED

YEEEOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!

CUT TO:

MARY

(knocking gently)

Ted, are you okay?

TED (O.S.)

(pained)

Just a minute.

MARY'S MOM

He's been in there over half an hour.

(whispering)

Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

MARY

Mom!

MARY'S MOM

Well he was watching you undress with a

silly grin on his face.

TED (O.S.)

(pained)

I was watching the birds!

MARY'S MOM

Charlie, do something.

MARY'S DAD

All right, kid, that's it, I'm coming in.

MARY'S DAD (cont'd)

What seems to be the situation here? You

shit yourself or something?

TED

I wish.

TED (cont'd)

I, uh...I got it stuck.

MARY'S DAD

You got what stuck?

TED

It.

MARY'S DAD

It?

(beat)

Oh

let me have a look. It's not the end of the

world.

MARY'S DAD (O.S.)

OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

TED (O.S.)

Shhhhhh!

MARY'S DAD

(CALLS OUT)

Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!

TED

What?! No please, sir--

MARY'S DAD

She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what

to do.

MARY'S MOM

Teddy, hon, are you okay?

(moving closer, seeing the situation)

OH HEAVENS TO PETE!

TED

Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.

MARY'S MOM

Just relax, dear. Now, um...what exactly

are we looking at here?

TED

(dizzy)

What do you mean?

MARY'S MOM

(delicate)

I mean is it...is it...?

MARY'S DAD

(gruff)

Is it the frank or the beans?

TED

I think a little of both.

WARREN (O.S.)

Franks and beans!

MARY

(to Warren)

Shhhh.

MARY'S DAD (O.S.)

What the hell's that bubble?

TED

One guess.

MARY'S DAD

How the hell'd you get the beans all the

way up top like that?

TED

I don't know. It's not like it was a well

thought-out plan.

MARY'S MOM

Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming

through there.

MARY'S DAD

I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek

was about, pumpkin.

MARY'S MOM

I'm going to get some Bactine.

TED

No, please!

POLICE OFFICER

Ho there.

TED

(humiliated)

Oh God.

POLICE OFFICER

Everything okay here? Neighbors said they

heard a lady scream.

MARY'S DAD

You're looking at him. C'mere and take a

look at this beauty.

TED

No, that's really unneces--

POLICE OFFICER

Now I've seen it all. What the hell were

you thinking?

TED

(frustrated)

I wasn't trying--

POLICE OFFICER

Is that bubble what I think it is?

POLICE OFFICER (cont'd)

But...how...how'd you get the zipper all

the way to the top?

MARY'S DAD

Let's just say the kid's limber.

POLICE OFFICER

Well, there's only one thing to do.

TED

No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my

shirttail out and work on it in the

morning.

POLICE OFFICER

Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

TED

No, no, please!

MARY'S MOM

Teddy, be brave.

WARREN (O.S.)

Beans and franks!

MARY (O.S.)

Warren,

POLICE OFFICER

It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.

A-one and a-two and...

CUT TO:

PARAMEDIC

We got a bleeder!

PARAMEDIC

(to Mary)

Keep pressure on it!

MARY

(running along)

Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be

okay?

TED

(irrational cockiness)

You betcha!

DISSOLVE TO:

TED

...Anyway, school ended a few days later

and that July her father got transferred to

Florida.

up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.

TED (cont'd)

It took me half the summer to pay off all

those bets.

(sighs)

I never did see Mary again. That was about

twelve years ago.

PSYCHIATRIST

Uh-huh. Interesting.

TED

Anyway, it's not something you exactly

forget about, but I guess I must've blocked

it out of my head. Then about a week ago

I'm driving on the highway and I got to

thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't

breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow

of traffic anymore I felt like I was

going to die. I pulled into a rest area,

parked the car, and just started shaking.

PSYCHIATRIST

You know...rest areas are homosexual

hang-outs.

TED

Huh?

PSYCHIATRIST

Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses

of the nineties for some gay men.

TED

What are you saying?

PSYCHIATRIST

(checking wristwatch)

Oops, time's up. We'll have to delve into

that next week.

CUT TO:

DOM

Gay? He said you were gay?

TED

He implied it.

DOM

Well you're a writer, and a lot of

writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

TED

Yeah, but he was successful.

DOM

Let me ask you this: When you smoke a

cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

TED

Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

DOM

I'm going to fix you up with my new

assistant.

TED

What's he like?

DOM

You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.

(beat)

You're going to like this one--she's half

Asian, half American.

TED

Good-looking?

DOM

I just told you,

could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and

they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's

a foolproof combo.

TED

What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm

in a slump.

(SIGHS)

Lately I've been feeling like...well...like

a loser.

DOM

Loser? You?

DOM (cont'd)

Give me a break. Remember five years ago,

when your kidneys failed? If you were a

loser would they have been able to find a

donor with an exact tissue match? What are

the odds of that, one in a million?

TED

Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got

killed in an explosion?

DOM

I never said that. I'm saying your lucky

those kids found his kidneys.

(beat)

Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a

shit about you.

DOM (cont'd)

You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty

guy. You got a fucking guardian angel, man.

TED

I gotta take this, it might be my boss.

(flips phone open)

Ted here.

GARBLED VOICE

(on phone)

You're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of

puke!

TED

Yep.

DOM'S WIFE

I thought you guys might like these with

your beers.

DOM

Thanks, baby.

TED

See, that's what I want. I don't need these

bimbettes you got me chasing. I want what

you have. A family....Someone to...you

know...love.

TED (cont'd)

It must be great with a wife like that.

DOM

Each day is better than the next.

(beat)

Have you ever been, you know...in love with

someone?

TED

Nah.

DOM

Never?

TED

Well once. Mary.

DOM

Mary again.

TED

Look, I admit it was brief, but it was

definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve

years.

DOM

Whatever happened to Mary?

TED

I told you, her family moved to Miami.

DOM

I mean since then.

TED

I don't know.

DOM

Well why don't you look her up?

TED

(sarcastic)

Yeah, right.

DOM

Why not?

TED

Because I guarantee she's married and has a

couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay

single.

DOM

What if you're wrong? You just said she's

the only girl you ever loved, what have you

got to lose by calling her?

TED

I did try calling her.

(sheepish)

A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

DOM

So that was it? One bump in the road and

you gave up?

TED

I also called

DOM

You're kidding? What did they say?

TED

They told me they don't help out stalkers.

(beat)

Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long

time.

DOM

I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him

out there, he follows her around a couple

days, she'll never know a thing.

TED

No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.

DOM

Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in

my office who might be able to help you

out. He's a claims investigator and he goes

to Miami every couple weeks.

CUT TO:

of a big insurance company - MORNING

TED

I don't know about this, Dom.

DOM

Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple

years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston

office; some bullshit about padding his

resume--like we haven't all done that.

Anyway, they were going to let him go but

his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that

ended up on my desk.

TED

His mother?

DOM

Yeah, I guess he still lives with her.

Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or

something--so I went out on a limb and got

him transferred down to Providence.

TED

And you think he could find out her number

for me?

DOM

He'll do better than that. I'll send him

down to Miami on business, you throw him a

couple bucks on the side, and he'll track

her down.

DOM (cont'd)

Just let me warn you--This guy runs a

little hot, but he gets the job done.

CUT TO:

HEALY

So, Dom tells me you're looking for some

lady-friend you knew in high school.

TED

Uh-huh.

HEALY

Any idea where I might start looking?

TED

She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago.

I checked directory assistance down there

and she's not listed. She might've moved

ten times since then.

HEALY

(skeptical)

All you want is a phone number?

TED

Well, I know you're busy

HEALY

Don't play games with me, Ted.

TED

I don't know, maybe you could poke around

for a half day and see if she has five kids

and a Labrador.

HEALY

I don't buy it.

TED

You don't buy what?

HEALY

Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from

the hip. Now I want you to level with me:

Did you knock this skirt up?

TED

(indignant)

No.

HEALY

She's blackmailing you, right?

TED

(more indignant)

HEALY

You want her dead, don't you?

TED

You can't be serious.

HEALY

Do you really expect me to believe this is

a straight stalker case?

TED

I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.

HEALY

Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted

number and you haven't heard squat from her

in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted.

You're a real piece of work.

TED

(stands)

Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the

whole thing.

HEALY

I get one hundred a day plus expenses.

TED

(LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)

You get fifty a day, period. It's a

business trip, they'll pay for your

expenses.

HEALY

Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick

turns up with a toe tag, I'm rolling over

on you.

Fucking Sully! Look at you!

SULLY

(Boston accent)

You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.

SULLY

Here's the info you asked for.

HEALY

Thanks.

SULLY

You should thank me--that girl was not easy

to find. What'd she scam you out of-some

insurance dough?

HEALY

Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track

down his high school girlfriend.

SULLY

Stalker, huh?

HEALY

Big time.

HEALY

Very nice.

SULLY

I'm doing okay.

(checks watch)

I gotta get ready for work.

HEALY

Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels?

Looks like you really cleaned up your act.

SULLY (O.S.)

What can I tell you? It's a healthier

lifestyle down here, and it's easier to

succeed when your head's clear. Those guys

I worked with back in Boston, they were a

bad influence.

HEALY

Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go

grab a couple drinks.

SULLY (O.S.)

Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

HEALY

Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

HEALY (cont'd)

What the...?!

SULLY

Take it easy, that's Bill.

HEALY

Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

SULLY

(smiling)

Relax, he just ate.

SULLY (cont'd)

(proudly)

Nineteen months I been sober.

HEALY

What are you talking about? You were never

an alky, you were a cokehead.

SULLY

Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta

quit the booze, too.

HEALY

Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm

proud of you.

HEALY (cont'd)

Here, just have one of these then.

SULLY

Healy, what I just tell you?

HEALY

This is a light beer. You can't have a

light beer?

SULLY

No I can't.

HEALY

Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ

sakes.

(holds up beer)

Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

HEALY (cont'd)

I'm worried about you, man. You better

learn to have a pop once in a while or

you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're

being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

SULLY

Am I?

HEALY

Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to

hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You

gotta learn how to bend a little or believe

me...you're gonna break.

SULLY

Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't

even taste good to me anymore.

Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children

and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,

affirmative.

MARY

Have you been up all night again?

MAGDA

Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,

Neighborhood Watch is.

MARY

Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call

listening in on stranger's phone

conversations?

MAGDA

These ain't strangers, they're

This only picks up signals in a half-mile

radius.

MARY

Meaning?

MAGDA

Meaning these are the people you live

amongst, you got a right to know if they're

creeps. For instance, did you know there's

a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

MARY

(feigning shock)

You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta

move.

MAGDA

I

it on the scanner. I knew

something was up because Puffy used to bark

like hell whenever he saw him and you know

Puffy only barks at bad people.

MARY

Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

MAGDA

That's because there's a lot of bad people

out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you

about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was

a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out

for yourself, didn't you?

MARY

Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,

huh.

Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

Healy watching from his car.

HEALY

Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm

guessing she's either got a bowel disorder

or we've got a hurler on our hands.

MARY

Get in line. One at a time.

GARY

Can I have two, Mary?

MARY

Yeah, you can have two halves, just like

everyone else.

GARY

Thanks.

FREDDIE

Will you marry me, Mary?

MARY

Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about

Dolores?

FREDDIE

Would you marry us both, Mary?

MARY

Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,

wouldn't it?

MARY (cont'd)

Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who

looked just like you here a minute ago.

Healy.

She's just got a big heart.

LISA

Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp

doctor to share candlelit dinners, long

walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

BRENDA

What does this girl want, a corpse? You

gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute

with three pound cock and trust fund.'

JOANIE

No, it should be 'a hockey player with

great pecs.'

MARY

Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those

guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana

hammock.

the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their

BRENDA (O.S.)

(to Mary)

I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a

washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

MARY

I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a

bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.

You can have those pretty boys who hang out

in a gym all day staring at their

reflections.

HEALY

(quietly into mic)

A girl after your own heart, Ted.

Mary and friends.

JOANIE

I can live with those reflections.

MARY

I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.

Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer

and playing thirty-six holes and still has

enough energy to take me and Warren out to

a ballgame.

JOANIE

(sarcastic)

Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going

to find a guy like that.

MARY

But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking

about has got to be self-employed.

LISA

You mean, like an architect or something?

MARY

Architect, yeah.

MARY

No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,

that's good, but it's the freedom I'm

talking about. See, this guy has to have a

job he could do anywhere. That way we could

just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

LISA

And where would you and your beer-bellied

architect be leaving to?

MARY

I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans

Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in

Nepal.

JOANIE

Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy

halfway to Katmandu.

MARY

What's that supposed to mean?

JOANIE

It means you're too hard on guys.

MARY

No I'm not.

JOANIE

Oh come off it, Mare. What about

what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've

at least passed the baton on that one.

MARY

Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for

awhile.

JOANIE

All right for awhile? The guy's

good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

LISA

At one point you were talking about

marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

MARY

I don't know, it was complicated. He's in

San Francisco, I'm in Miami.

(dodging question)

Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you

said you were putting her up for a

Ah, she's okay.

Mary, cut the crap, what really happened

with Steve?

MARY

Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.

Warren.

JOANIE

What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

MARY

I don't want someone who'll

with

him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the

way I do. Do you know what he told my

friend Tucker? He said he would've popped

the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't

in my life.

Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn

lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

I've got some very, very good news for you,

TED

Really?

HEALY

I think your life's about to change.

TED

So you found Mary?

HEALY

Right there in Liberty City. And you were

right, she's really something.

TED

(smiles)

So she hasn't changed?

HEALY

That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you

something: Was she a little

in high school?

TED

No, not at all.

HEALY

Well she must've packed on a few pounds

over the years.

TED

Mary's a little chubby, huh?

HEALY

I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.

Not bad.

HEALY (cont'd)

But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,

you're going to put on a few pounds.

TED

So she's married?

HEALY

Nope. Never been.

TED

Huh?

HEALY

Four kids, three different guys.

TED

Three different guys?

HEALY

Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two

whites, and a midget.

TED

Oh my.

HEALY

Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to

keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

TED

She's in a wheelchair?!

HEALY

Don't look so shocked, it's been a long

time. I bet you've changed a lot over the

last twelve years, haven't you?

TED

(shrugs)

It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have

thought...

HEALY

Anyway, the good news is I have all the

information you need. Got it from her

bookie--nice guy. You should definitely

call her, Ted. I mean she's a real

sparkplug, that one. She seems determined

to get those rugrats off welfare and with

your help I'll bet she does it.

TED

Thanks, Healy. Good work.

HEALY

Ted? Don't you want the name of the

housing project?

TED

Uh, that's okay.

You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to

hear from you before her mastectomy!

Oh, uh, I resigned.

HEALY

Yeah, this insurance business is too slow

for me. I'm going to go down and try my

hand at jai alai.

TED

Jai alai?

HEALY

Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at

home in the fronton.

TED

Look, uh, I've been thinking about

everything you told me.

HEALY

Good good.

TED

Well I think you're right, I should look

her up.

HEALY

Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

TED

But you said she was a sparkplug...?

HEALY

I said buttplug. She's heinous.

TED

All the same, I still want to call her. I

know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot

of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,

maybe I can help her out.

(sighs)

The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a

wheelchair for Godsakes.

HEALY

It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

TED

Oh. I thought

(beat)

That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't

make any sense to you, but I just can't

turn it off that fast. I still feel

something for her.

HEALY

Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number

for you just as soon as she gets back from

Japan.

TED

Japan? What's she doing in Japan?

HEALY

You've heard of mail-order brides? Well

they go that way, too.

TED

Mary's a mail-order bride?

HEALY

Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,

it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the

pound there. Sort of like tuna.

DOM

Well...at least now you know.

TED

I think it was better when I didn't. It was

kind of inspiring to know there was someone

so pure in the world.

TED

What's so funny?

DOM

I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking

this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're

you've been in therapy thinking you blew it

with the greatest girl ever, and it turns

out that getting your dick stuck in your

zipper was the best thing that ever

happened to you!

TED

Wait a second, I never told you that.

DOM

Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.

TED

Maybe you're right. I should look on the

bright side. I mean, I've still got my

health...

No thanks.

Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?

All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.

MARY

Nepal? Have you been?

HEALY

Not in months. I don't even know why I

bought the damn place.

MARY

You own a home there?

HEALY

Well...it's just a condo really. Right

outside Katmandu.

MARY

Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to

go. Is it true the mountains are so tall

you can't see the tops?

HEALY

Not 'til you get about three hundred yards

from the summit. That's been my experience

anyway.

Pat Healy.

Don't you want to know my name?

I already know it, Mary.

MARY

How'd you know that?

HEALY

It's right there on your golf bag.

MARY

What are you doing with all these

blueprints?

HEALY

Some buildings I'm working on.

MARY

Are you...an architect?

HEALY

Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

HEALY (cont'd)

I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call

me an architect--it's just a job really, a

way to keep me moving. My real passion is

my hobby.

MARY

What's that?

HEALY

I work with retards.

MARY

(taken aback)

I beg your pardon?

HEALY

You know...

(flaps lips with fingers)

...the guys who ride the short bus.

MARY

(put off)

Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

HEALY

The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me

who I can and can't work with.

MARY

No, I mean

HEALY

--There's this one kid, we call him Mongo

on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out

of his cage once and--

MARY

--He's in a cage?!

HEALY

Well it's more of an enclosure really.

MARY

They keep him confined? That's bullshit!

HEALY

That's what I said, so I went out and got

him a leash you know, one of those

clothesline runners for the backyard. He's

got plenty of room out there to dig. The

kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him

to ball games, movies--you know, happy

stuff.

MARY

That sounds like fun.

HEALY

Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven

for me.

social standing or age, it's about

common kindred spirits.

TUCKER

The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

- smiles.

MARY

Oh yeah, they look great.

TUCKER (V.O.)

You don't think they're too big?

MARY (V.O.)

No no, the bigger the better.

(beat)

But I must say, they could be a little

brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful

of pearly whites.

TUCKER

You ever been laid in this office?

MARY

Behave yourself, Tucker.

(smiles)

Come on, what are you doing here?

TUCKER

I wanted to talk to you about your friend

Patrick.

MARY (O.S.)

He's a nice guy, isn't he?

TUCKER (O.S.)

Well that's what I'm trying to figure

out. How long have you known him?

MARY

Not long at all, but I really like him.

(off Tucker's look)

Okay, I know he's a little different,

Tucker, but that's what I like about him.

He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a

dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always

politically correct and he probably farts,

too. And that's okay with me.

TUCKER

That's what you've been looking for--a

farter?

MARY

I've been looking for a

these South Beach pussies.

TUCKER

(SIGHS)

Look, it's just that something about him

struck me as odd last night. He gave me

this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some

friends back east. They don't know of any

architect named Patrick Healy and he's not

listed as a Harvard alumnus.

HEALY

Fuck!!

MARY (O.S.)

Huh...that's strange.

TUCKER

I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't

think I'm being meddlesome. I just think

you should be careful with this guy.

MARY

(concerned)

No no no, Tucker, thank you.

TUCKER

I mean let's face it, Mary, you're

beautiful, you've got money, you trust

people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of

psychos out there.

MARY

(small smile)

I appreciate you looking out for me.

At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was

How the hell did you get here anyway?

I hate to ruin your day, Ted, but I have

some bad news for you.

Shoot.

DOM

Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't

know where to mail his last paycheck so I

sent my assistant by his mother's

apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic

mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten

years.

TED

And this adversely affects me how...?

DOM

Don't you see?--Healy lied to us about

back from Miami he kept talking about

falling for some doctor named Mary!

TED

Huh? What? No...

for him....would she?

DOM

His address in Miami. You know, when you

think about it, we really don't know the

first thing about this guy.

TED

Jesus Christ what have I done?

You're not seriously thinking about going

out with this guy again?

and Puffy's never wrong.

What if he's not? What if Tucker just made

an honest mistake?

LISA

What if he didn't?

I don't know how I can bail now, he's going

to be here any minute.

JOANNIE

Well then blow him off when he gets here.

But you didn't meet him. He seems so I

don't know...perfect...kind of.

He has a big cock, doesn't he?

Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name

was?

Healy.

MAGDA

I think you better listen to this.

So where the hell are you, Healy?

Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary

girl I told you about.

Yep.

We shouldn't be listening to this.

Turn it up, Magda.

HEALY (V.O.)

Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.

I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

SULLY (V.O.)

Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

HEALY (V.O.)

I don't know. I guess...it just seems that

women today are more impressed by the

mighty buck than by some schmo who spent

the last seventeen years scraping by on

Peace Corp wages.

SULLY (V.O.)

But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you

say, she's going to want to hear about

the things you did.

HEALY

(dismissing this)

Ahh.

SULLY

(reading)

Come on, you could tell her about the

irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the

orphan babies who cried in your arms in

Romania...

...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in

Calcutta...

Mary and friends.

JOANNIE

(welling up)

I love this man.

Look, I did all those things for myself.

I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish

prick. I get a high from helping all of

God's creatures. An honest to goodness

high.

How are you doing, Warren?

Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?

I can't believe he remembered you. He never

You know I tried to call you for weeks

after that.

Really? I never got a message.

That's weird. I talked to your brother

By the way, how's he doing?

He's dead.

Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

No, it was a good thing.

Oh. So...what brings you down here?

Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of

mine decided to...ah...you know...just

Well you look great. Are you married, do

you have kids?

Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.

Oh...are you...?

Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.

There was this guy back in college who was

bothering me...got kind of ugly--a

restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,

when I got out of Princeton I changed my

name as a precaution.

Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you

say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up

on old times?

Didn't we just do that?

the thing is I already have plans. How

about tomorrow night?

think you're gonna need one tonight.

Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll

probably need it before I will.

MAGDA

Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap

smear the guy needed leather gloves and an

oyster shucker.

So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to

take you to the movies.

Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're

Oh, you are sweet.

No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk

so you'll pass out and I can have my way

with Mary.

MARY

Can I pour you one?

TUCKER

Thanks, but I've got to be going.

Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social

visit.

MARY

What's up?

TUCKER

Well...I've got a little more news about

your friend Healy.

MARY

I know what you're going to say, but he

already told me everything. I know he's not

an architect.

TUCKER (cont'd)

I think you'd better sit down.

MARY

Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,

but I'm really strapped for time here and--

TUCKER

Mary, the man's a killer.

- he can't believe his ears.

- as she lowers herself onto the couch.

MARY

(stunned)

What...?

TUCKER

I've got a friend in the Boston police

department. He faxed me this this morning.

I'll just give you the highlights.

(reading from rap sheet)

After a short stint as a petty thief,

Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery

by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he

committed his first murder--a pretty

teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He

was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,

despite a grim psychological profile, the

state was forced to release him. In his

mid-twenties and again in his early

thirties he was suspected of homicides in

the states of Utah and Washington.

Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly

decomposed that there wasn't enough

evidence to hold him, and on and on and so

forth and so on.

- he listens intently, his face ashen.

MARY (V.O.)

Holy shit...

MAGDA (V.O.)

Puffy, get over here.

MARY

Magda!

MAGDA

The little shit lied to me about that guy!

MARY

(growing emotional)

I can't believe this is happening. I'm

supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

TUCKER

Okay, just calm down. It's going to be

okay.

MAGDA

Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

MARY

Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in

my life.

TUCKER

Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give

me a big head.

(smiles)

The important thing, Doctor, is you've got

to distance yourself as much as possible

without pissing this psycho off.

MARY

Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to

do. I'll call him right now.

- he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He

Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and

roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a

message. BEEP.

MARY (V.O.)

Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're

not going to believe this--well, you'll

believe it, there's no reason not to--but I

Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to

bail on you.

Got cash.

Car clean? Plenty of gas?

Check.

Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just

clean the pipes and it's a go.

You know, clean the pipes.

Pipes? What are you talking about?

You jerk off before all big dates, right?

Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

DOM (cont'd)

(incredulous)

You don't jerk off before--?! Are you

crazy?! That's like going out there with a

loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!

DOM (cont'd)

Think about it: After you've had sex with a

girl and the two of you are laying in bed,

are you nervous?

TED

No.

DOM

Why's that?

TED

I'm usually too tired to be.

DOM

Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby

batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck

with your head, that stuff will.

TED

(starting to believe)

Huh.

DOM

The most honest moment in a man's life is

the five minutes after he's blown a load.

That's a medical fact. And it's because

you're no longer trying to get laid. You're

actually thinking like a girl. They love

that.

TED

Jesus Christ you're right.

DOM

You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go

out with a loaded gun, you empty the

barrels!

Maybe this'll jog your memory.

I'll give you a hint--it's got something to

do with me being a murderer.

information.

...So then in '94 I went back to Dade

Community College for a semester and when

the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I

hooked up with the Pizza Barn.

HEALY

And you met Mary how?

TUCKER

Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her

one night and she answered the door in her

nightgown--that was it for me. I went home

that night, shaved my beard, and a week

later I was laid out in her office with a

broken back.

HEALY

How'd you manage that one?

TUCKER

(matter-of-factly)

Friend. Baseball bat.

HEALY

Nice.

TUCKER

Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine

until you showed up.

HEALY

Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started

telling bald-faced lies about the

competition--that's crossing the line!

TUCKER

What line? The day you first laid your oily

rap on my future wife you started a war!

HEALY

nothing more than a glorified brother in

her eyes.

TUCKER

Why you son of a--

don't do something about that headcase

she's with now.

We should play some time...I mean, if you

can afford to lose some money.

What are you?

MARY

Twenty-two.

TED

Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a

MARY

Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.

TED

That's more like it.

(to Counter-Man)

Two more nitrate-sicles please.

COUNTER-MAN

You got it.

MARY

Nitrate-sicles--I like that.

I say they should put more meats on a

stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets

on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles,

lollipops--but hardly any meat.

MARY

I agree there should be more.

TED

You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a

cone. You could put corned beef hash in a

cone, or chopped liver.

MARY

I like it. And think of the

toppings--cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly

TED

Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.

MARY

It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.

TED

(pleased)

Yeah?

MARY

We've got a lot in common.

TED

Well...why don't you move back?

Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my

me?

So you're a writer?

Trying to be.

MARY

Well good for you. I bet it works out for

you.

We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at

least I gave it a shot.

MARY

That's right. And the good thing is you can

do it anywhere.

TED

What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you

manage to stay single?

MARY

I don't know...My friends think I'm too

picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I

did come close once--just last year, in

fact. There was this guy he lived in San

Francisco.

Four.

for a while now but I don't think we should

see each other for a few weeks.

MARY

(alarmed)

Why not?

TED

Well...to be honest....I'm really crazy

about you and it's making me nervous and

when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm

afraid I'm going to doing something really

dumb before we get started so I think I

should just lay back until I regain my

composure.

That's really sweet, Ted, but you should

save it for one of your books.

All right, let's go.

Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.

(chipper)

Hey.

TED (cont'd)

The flowers are for you and the ball's for

Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to

me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro.

MARY

Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around?

TED

(lamely)

What do you mean?

MARY

It's not true...right, Ted?

TED

Well, funny story there. You see, uh, it

started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =

MARY

Get out.

TED

Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it

sounds. I certainly didn't know--

MARY

That you put a murderer on my trail?

TED

Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I

just thought--

MARY

What did you think, Ted? That you could spy

on me and trick me into thinking you were

someone I could...really go for?

TED

Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

MARY

Then what the fuck did you do it for?

TED

I did it because because I'd never

stopped thinking about you and if I didn't

find you I knew my life would never be good

again.

MARY

(softly)

Please leave.

TED

(devastated)

Mary, come on...

MARY

Go!

TED

(beat)

Okay.

- the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court

reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG

TED

Hello...?

HEALY

Ho-ly shit.

TUCKER

Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

HEALY

Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

HEALY (cont'd)

(alarmed)

Hey, hey, hey!

TED

Surprised?

TUCKER

Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

TED

(to Tucker)

Who the fuck are you?

HEALY

He's in love with Mary, too.

TED

You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?

HEALY

(righteous)

What do you mean 'why'?

TED

Answer the question, shitball.

TUCKER

I think everybody could use a drink.

HEALY

Look, you asked me to follow your girl

around, and I did and I started to like

her, and then I realized I just couldn't in

good conscience do it.

TED

(amazed)

Do what?

HEALY

Turn her over to a stalker.

TED

What?! You're calling

a stalker?

HEALY

That's right--if you weren't you would've

looked for her yourself!

HEALY (cont'd)

(sickened)

Oh Christ...poor dog.

TED

You're a sick man, you know that?

HEALY

Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand

the fact that it was my turn.

TED

Your turn?

HEALY

(getting emotional)

That's right, hot shot!

the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever

get the great girl? Give the big pig with

the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick

of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was

time for me...time for me...to be happy.

TED

Well you didn't have to blow us both out of

the water. Jesus Christ, just because she

found out about you, why'd you have to take

me down with you?

HEALY

I don't know what you're talking about.

TED

I'm talking about the letter, asshole.

HEALY

What?

TED

Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a

letter outlining our deal?

HEALY

Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be

screwing myself.

HEALY (cont'd)

You little fuck.

TUCKER

What?

HEALY

You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said

you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck

you until we had this fuck out of the

fucking picture.

(moves in on Tucker)

You crossed the line, man.

TUCKER

Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why

would I cross the line--what do you think I

got no pride?

TUCKER (cont'd)

I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You

probably did it yourself, you piece of

shit.

HEALY

Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I

rat myself out?

TUCKER

Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy

who's idea of courting is blowing farts in

the chick's face

HEALY

You were following us?

TUCKER

Don't flatter yourself--I was following

I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

TED

You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff

about Warren?

TUCKER

Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?

He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two

should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't

for me, she might've married that schmuck!

TED

The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

HEALY

(sadly)

Oh...Sully.

TUCKER

Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,

and it wasn't me who sent it?

CUT TO:

an alarmed Mary.

MARY

Woogie? What are what are you doing here?

reveals Dom sitting on her bed.

DOM

Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about

Ted?

MARY

You sent that?

DOM

Uh-huh. I was worried about you.

MARY

Well...thank you. But...you know you're not

supposed to be within four hundred yards of

me.

DOM

(excited)

That's what I want to tell ya. I've been

through two years of extensive

psychotherapy and you know what?

MARY

(cautious)

That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're

better--you seem...good--but...you put me

through quite an ordeal, you know.

MARY (cont'd)

I had to move, go to court, change my last

name--you stole all my shoes!

DOM

Look at me.

DOM (cont'd)

God above, on everything that is holy to

me, I did not steal your shoes.

MARY

Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

DOM

All right, I did, but I was in a weird

place then.

DOM (cont'd)

Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

CUT TO:

MARY (V.O.)

Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.

HEALY

Who the hell's Woogie?

Mary and Dom. =~

MARY

I'm asking you to leave.

DOM

(gentle)

Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all

wrong.

(beat)

I'm not leaving...

DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)

...Not until I get a little something to

remember you by.

MARY (V. O . )

(clearly struggling)

Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

CUT TO:

- Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms

MARY

Stop it!

DOM

Just one pair! You owe me that much, you

heartless bitch!

HEALY

Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your

friend Ted like that.

DOM

What? You fucked him over, too.

HEALY

He's no friend of mine.

MAGDA

What the hell's going on here?

HEALY

We're in love with your roommate.

MAGDA

Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm

gonna pack my bags and go back to my own

place.

MARY

Tucker, where are your crutches?

TUCKER

(British accent)

Interesting query, Mary...

HEALY

Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

TUCKER

Well isn't this nice--now we've got the

whole gang together.

TED

Dom? What are you?

DOM

You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

MARY

(rolling eyes)

Woogie and I went out for awhile in high

school.

TED

(stunned)

DOM

Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

TED

But but you're married. You have kids a

great wife.

DOM

If you're so happy with them, please, be my

guest.

HEALY

If I may I have a proposal.

HEALY (cont'd)

I say none of us leave this room until our

young Mary here stops jerking us around and

decides once and for all who she wants. Now

Mary, I know this is difficult but you

really will be doing them all a favor to

tell them the truth about us.

MARY

Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're

a murderer.

TUCKER

Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I

exaggerated a little there.

MARY

You mean he's not a criminal?

HEALY

God no!

(pleased)

I'm just a pathological liar!

MARY

Tucker...not you, too?

TUCKER

Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my

folks.

MARY

Oh Jesus...

MARY (cont'd)

Brett...?

BRETT FAVRE

Hi, Mary.

HEALY

What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

BRETT FAVRE

We're in town to play the Dolphins.

TED

I called him. I told him to pick up Warren

and get over here.

TED (cont'd)

Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker

there lied to you about Brett.

TED (cont'd)

Brett never said anything bad about Warren.

He loves Warren...and from what he just

told me on the phone, he loves you, too.

(beat)

He's the guy you should be with.

BRETT FAVRE

That's right, Mare. And you know I'll

always be true to you.

DOM

Aw shit, this isn't fair.

TED

(to Mary)

I realized something tonight. I'm no better

than any of these guys. None of them really

love you...they just fixated on you because

of how you made them feel. But that's not

real love...Thank you for letting me see

that. Now I can get on with the rest of my

life.

TUCKER

Oh please...

DOM

Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.

HEALY

You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you

going to stand here and tell us that you

aren't in love with this girl?

TED

Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.

(winks)

See you, Mare.

TED (cont'd)

(as he passes Warren)

See you, Warren.

WARREN

Huh...?

TED

See you, Warren.

WARREN

Bye, Ted.

DOM

Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to

autograph one of these pumps for me?

CUT TO:

MARY

Ted!

TED

What what are you doing here?

MARY

You forgot your keys!

TED

(deflated)

Oh. Thanks.

MARY

Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?

MARY (cont'd)

Ted...?

TED

(looking down)

I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.

MARY

But I think I'd be happiest...with you.

TED

You're fucking with me, right?

TED (cont'd)

(wiping eyes)

But but what about Steve?

MARY

Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy

doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

MARY (cont'd)

Get over here.

TED

Really?

MARY

Really.

MARY

Ted, no, no....!

MARY (cont'd)

Somebody hold up traffic!

(beat)

Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going

to be okay.

TED

Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

MARY

I love you too, Ted.

(beat)

I think I always have.

LADY

Over here! I found his foot! It was in the

storm drain!

as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

MARY

All right, everyone, let's fan out and look

for the penis!

FADE OUT.
