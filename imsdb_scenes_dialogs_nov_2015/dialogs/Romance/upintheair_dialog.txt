UP IN THE AIR

1.

RYAN

How much does your life weigh?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Imagine for a second that you're

carrying a backpack... I want you

to feel the straps on your

shoulders... You feel them?

(gives us a beat)

Now, I want you to pack it with all

the stuff you have in your life.

Start with the little things. The

stuff in drawers and on shelves.

The collectables and knick-knacks.

Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,

start adding the larger stuff. Your

clothes, table top appliances,

lamps, linens, your TV. That

backpack should be getting pretty

heavy at this point - Go Bigger.

Your couch, your bed, your kitchen

table. Stuff it all in... Your car,

get it in there... Your home,

whether you have a studio apartment

or a two story house, I want you to

stuff it into that backpack.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Now try to walk.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what

we do to ourselves on a daily

basis. We weigh ourselves down

until we can't even move. And make

no mistake - Moving is living.

2.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Now, I'm going to set your backpack

on fire. What do you want to take

out of it? Photos? Photos are for

people who can't remember. Drink

some gingko and let the photos

burn. In fact let everything burn

and imagine waking up tomorrow with

nothing.

(a beat of emphasis)

It's kind of exhilarating isn't it?

That is how I approach every day.

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Do you want the cancer?

RYAN

Excuse me?

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

(SAME DELIVERY)

Do you want the cancer?

FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

The can, sir?

RYAN

Oh... No. Um, no thank you.

3.

STEVE

Who the fuck are you?

RYAN (V.O.)

Excellent question. Who the fuck am

I? Poor Steve has worked here for

seven years.

FLASH IMAGES:

RYAN (V.O.)

He's never had a meeting with me

before...

RYAN (V.O.)

...or passed me in the hall...

RYAN (V.O.)

... or told me a story in the break

room....

4.

RYAN (V.O.)

And that's because I don't work

here. I work for another company

that lends me out to pussies like

Steve's boss...

RYAN (V.O.)

... who don't have the balls to

sack their own employees. And in

some cases, for good reason.

Because, people do crazy shit when

they get fired.

FLASH IMAGES:

BACK TO:

RYAN (V.O.)

And that's where I come in.

STEVE

What did I... do? What could I have

done differently here?

RYAN

This is not an assessment of your

productivity. It's important not to

personalize this.

5.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Steve, I want you to review this

packet. Take it seriously. I think

you're going to find a lot of

answers in there.

STEVE

(DISMISSIVE)

Oh, I'm sure it's going be really

helpful.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Look, anybody who ever built an

empire, or changed the world, sat

where you are now. And it's because

they sat there that they were able

to do it.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I'm going to need your key card.

STEVE

Right...

RYAN

Take the day. Put together your

personal things. Talk to your co-

workers. Tomorrow, go out and get

some exercise. Go for a jog. Give

yourself routines and pretty soon

you'll find your legs.

STEVE

Wait, how do I get in touch with you?

RYAN

Don't worry. We'll be in touch

soon. This is just the beginning.

RYAN (V.O.)

I'll never see Steve again.

6.

CHECKOUT GIRL

Do you have your Hilton Honors Card

with you?

CHECKOUT GIRL

Oh my God... Do you like, live, at

the Hilton?

RYAN (V.O.)

This is where I live.

7.

AIRPORT CLERK

Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

RYAN (V.O.)

When I run my card, the system

automatically prompts the desk

clerk to greet me with this exact

statement.

AIRPORT CLERK

Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

RYAN (V.O.)

Had my status simply been gold or

God-forbid, silver. I might have

gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe.

RYAN (V.O.)

Loyalty is earned and rewarded with

these small touches. It's these kinds

of systemized friendly touches that

keep my world in orbit.

JUMP CUT TO:

8.

ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS

Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

RYAN (V.O.)

All the things you probably hate

about travelling - The recycled air.

The artificial lighting. The digital

juice dispensers and mini pizzas

stacked to their heat lamps are the

warm reminders that I am home.

INTERCUT WITH:

KEVIN

Ryan Bingham's office.

RYAN

You have me in a Dodge Stratus in

Kansas City.

KEVIN

They are completely out of all full

sized sedans...

9.

RYAN

(INTERRUPTS)

Did you?...

KEVIN

(not the first time)

Yes, I reminded them of your

remarkable #1 Gold Club status and

years in the program. They are moving

mountains to see you in a Sebring.

RYAN

Fair enough. Any other messages?

KEVIN

Your sister Kara called. Needs to

speak urgently about your sister's

wedding. I told her you were midair

and not even I knew your final

destination.

RYAN

Well done.

KEVIN

And you got an invitation to speak

at GoalQuest in Vegas.

RYAN

GoalQuest twenty?

FLASH IMAGE:

RYAN (V.O.)

Every once in a while I do speaking

engagements. Motivational kind of

stuff. But GoalQuest... We're

talking major Tony Robbins shit.

10.

KEVIN

It's got a hologram. They're calling

it Dos Equis. That's some pretty

major Tony Robbins shit there.

RYAN

Talk about burying the lead.

(EXHALES)

I'll check in when...

KEVIN

Hold on, I have Craig Gregory for

you...

RYAN

I... ah, fuck...

INTERCUT WITH:

CRAIG GREGORY

How's the road warrior?

RYAN

Twenty minutes from boarding into a

world of bliss.

CRAIG GREGORY

Great numbers out of Phoenix. You

know Big Auto is going to drop

another 10K this month.

RYAN

No kidding?

CRAIG GREGORY

Yeah, Christmas came early. Wish I

could have you in five places at

once. I need you back in Omaha by

the end of the week.

RYAN

I thought you needed me everywhere.

11.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

We got something big - Game

changer.

RYAN

I don't know why you ever bring me

in. Wherever I go, the money

follows. Let me plant seeds,

they'll grow to Oaks.

CRAIG GREGORY

I'm thinking of planting seeds

right now.

RYAN

What are we talking about here?

CRAIG GREGORY

You'll see.

(CHANGES DIRECTIONS)

Today, I took my first crap in two

weeks. Hallelujah.

RYAN

That's me, hanging up on you.

CRAIG GREGORY

Good. I love that sound.

RYAN (V.O.)

To know me is to fly with me. I'm the

aisle, you're the window - trapped.

RYAN (V.O.)

We start chatting, impersonally at

first. Our moderate politics, our

sinking opinions on the American

service industry.

12.

RYAN (V.O.)

You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I

tip you off to a rib joint in Fort

Worth.

RYAN (V.O.)

You tell me your best joke. I've

heard it before, but listen anyway.

RYAN (V.O.)

Nothing like turbulence to cement a

bond. Soon you're telling me about

family.

RYAN (V.O.)

Your wife just went back to work

but you can't intervene because you

sure could use the extra paycheck

and besides, last June she read

some book and woke up one morning a

feminist.

RYAN (V.O.)

And that if your windfall ever came

through, you'd quit and spend the

rest of your days restoring vintage

speedboats.

(saying it with him)

The water. That's where you belong.

13.

RYAN (V.O.)

We exchange cards and slot them next

to countless others.

RYAN (V.O.)

Fast friends aren't my only

friends, but my best friends.

RYAN (V.O.)

Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch.

I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here.

I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a

new species. I live between the

margins of my itineraries.

RYAN

(PICKS UP)

Hello?

KARA (O.C.)

Hi Ryan.

INTERCUT WITH:

14.

RYAN (V.O.)

Every family has one person who is

the glue. The one who keeps the

genealogy in check. That's my

sister Kara - The glue.

RYAN

Hey Kara.

KARA

How are you holding up?

RYAN

Just fine. You? The kids?

KARA

(LYING)

Missy's outstanding. Matthew made

varsity. How's the road?

RYAN

Couldn't be better.

KARA

That's good. So, Ryan?

RYAN

(CAUTIOUS)

Yeah?

KARA

I didn't even want to have to ask you

for this, because I know how you are

about... doing things for others...

KARA (CONT'D)

But we're coming in on three weeks

to go for Julie's wedding and

there's something we could really

use your help on.

16.

RYAN

You're satisfied with Maestro?

ALEX

Yeah, I am.

RYAN

They're stingy with their miles. I

like Hertz.

ALEX

Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

If a car's over twenty-thousand

miles, I won't drive it.

RYAN

Maestro doesn't instant check out.

I like to park and go.

ALEX

Hertz doesn't guarantee Navigation.

RYAN

Funny, you don't seem like a girl

who needs directions.

ALEX

I hate asking for directions.

That's why I get a Nav.

RYAN

The new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

ALEX

Is that a joke?

RYAN

Yes.

ALEX

Their kiosk placement is a joke.

17.

RYAN

Never have available upgrades.

ALEX

(PASSIONATE)

It's basically a fleet of shit

boxes - Don't know how they're

still in business.

RYAN

(I love you)

I'm Ryan.

ALEX

Alex.

RYAN

So are you going to join me?

JUMP CUT TO:

RYAN

(grabs one of Alex's cards)

Maplewood Card? How dare you bring

that into this palace.

ALEX

Hilton offers equal value and

better food - But the Maplewood

gives out warm cookies at check in.

RYAN

They got you with the cookies?

ALEX

I'm a sucker for simulated

hospitality.

RYAN

There's actually an industry term

for that. It's a mixture of faux

and homey. It's faumey.

ALEX

(holds her hands eight

INCHES APART)

(extends a few inches)

19.

RYAN

Let's just say I've got a number in

mind and I haven't hit it yet.

ALEX

This is pretty fucking sexy.

RYAN

I hope it doesn't cheapen our

relationship.

ALEX

We're two people who get turned on

by elite status. We may have to

settle for cheap.

RYAN

There's nothing cheap about

loyalty.

RYAN

I really have to start throwing

these out.

ALEX

We can always use that room with

the ice machine.

20.

RYAN

Good call on the towel rack.

ALEX

Thanks. I liked how you burritoed

me in the sofa cushions.

RYAN

I was improvising.

ALEX

Too bad we didn't make it to the

closet.

RYAN

We got to do this again.

JUMP CUT TO:

RYAN

I'm in Newark on the 12th, Madesto

on the 13th, Oklahoma City on the

15th.

ALEX

Any Southwest? I'm swinging through

Albuquerque the week of the 16th?

RYAN

No, but I'll be in Florida by the 20th.

ALEX

Miami?

RYAN

Ft. Lauderdale.

ALEX

That's nothing.

RYAN

Forty minutes.

ALEX

I should probably go back to my

room so I can wake up in my bed.

21.

RYAN

I think that's the lady like thing

to do.

22.

RYAN (V.O.)

Last year, I spent three hundred

twenty two days on the road.

RYAN (V.O.)

Which means that I had to spend

forty three miserable days at home.

NOSEY NEIGHBOR

Ryan?

RYAN

(doesn't know his name)

Hi...

NOSEY NEIGHBOR

Feels like it's been months, busy man.

We missed you at our Summer party.

RYAN

Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there.

NOSEY NEIGHBOR

We've been trying to get a vote on

the new landscaping. Can I e-mail you

the plans...? We'd love to get a

final tally.

RYAN

It's fine. Really. I'll go with the

majority.

NOSEY NEIGHBOR

Sometimes I forget that you even

live here. You could probably save

money and move into a hotel.

23.

RYAN

(DEAD SERIOUS)

I looked into it, but the IRS

requires a permanent address for

employment. Otherwise, they

classify you as a vagrant.

NOSEY NEIGHBOR

Oh.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Hey neighbor.

RYAN

Hey yourself.

DIANNE

(hands over a package)

I signed for this while you were gone.

RYAN

Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.

DIANNE

(RE: PHOTO)

They seem happy.

RYAN

It's my sister. She's getting

married. Haven't met the guy yet.

DIANNE

Lots of luck.

24.

RYAN

I know, right?

DIANNE

It's good to see you. Feels like a

while this time.

RYAN

Hey, you want to come over tonight?

DIANNE

Actually, I kind of started seeing

somebody.

RYAN

Oh, that's... that's great.

DIANNE

Yeah, we're having drinks tonight

if you want to come over.

RYAN

That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.

CRAIG GREGORY

Just thrilled to have everyone

under one roof. Welcome home boys.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

I know there's are lot of

whispering about why we're all

here.

(MORE)

25.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Retailers are down twenty percent.

Auto industry is in the dump.

Housing market doesn't have a

heartbeat. This is our moment. It's

one of the worst times on record

for America... and I don't want to

be standing here two years from

now, wondering how we missed this

window of opportunity.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Now, last Summer we received a

dynamite young woman by way of

Cornell. She challenged us with some

big ideas. My first reaction was, who

does this kid think she is? But when I

started to give a listen, I was pretty

knocked out. So now, with a little

peek into our future - Natalie Keener.

NATALIE

If there's one word I want to leave

you with today, it's this...

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Glocal.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Our global must become local.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

This company keeps twenty three

people on the road, at least two

hundred fifty days a year. It's

expensive and it's inefficient.

When I came to Craig three months

ago with this, he told me, and

quite astutely - it's only a

problem if you have a solution.

(MORE)

26.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Well, today I stand before you with

jus that.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

You all know Ned in reception.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Today, I'm going to fire Ned.

(ASIDE)

Sorry, Ned. I'm sure H.R. will hire

you back this afternoon.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Ned could be any employee in any one

of our client's locations worldwide.

Strategy packets would be shipped in

advance. Ned would be given a seat

and find one of our transition

specialists waiting for him.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Mr. Laskin, the reason we're having

this conversation today is your

position is no longer available.

NED

(from a script)

I don't understand. I'm fired?

NATALIE

Hearing the words "You've been let

go" is never easy. Change is always

scary. But consider the following -

(using Ryan's line)

Anybody who ever built an empire,

or changed the world, sat where you

are now. And it's because they sat

there that they were able to do it.

RYAN

(QUIETLY)

That's my fucking line.

27.

NED

Well, what happens now?

NATALIE

This is the first step of a process

that will end with you in a new job

that fulfills you.

NED

Yeah, but, how does it work?

NATALIE

I want you to take that packet in

front of you.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Review it. All the answers you're

looking for are inside. Start

filling out the necessary

information and before you know it,

you'll be on your way to new

opportunities.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Now Ned, I'm going to need you to

go back to your desk and start

putting together your things. As a

favor to me, I'd appreciate it if

you didn't spread the news just

yet. Panic doesn't help anybody.

NED

I understand.

NATALIE

Have a good day, Mr. Laskin and

good luck with your future.

NED

Thank you.

NATALIE

Give it up for Ned.

28.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

You can start the morning in

Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch

and finish the day in San

Francisco. All for the price of a

T1 line. Our inflated travel budget

is eviscerated by eighty-five

percent... And most importantly to

you guys on the road... No more

Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa...

No more hours lost to weather

delays... You get to come home.

RYAN

Tell me you're not taking this

seriously.

CRAIG GREGORY

Yeah, that's why we brought the

entire company in from the road -

Because we're not taking this

seriously.

RYAN

It doesn't make any sense. It's...

(SEARCHING)

... completely impersonal.

CRAIG GREGORY

Who am I even talking to?

RYAN

There's a methodology to what I do.

A reason why it works.

CRAIG GREGORY

Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing

it for years. Just like anything,

there's a few months of transition,

but everyone settles in.

RYAN

Who are you taking off the road?

29.

CRAIG GREGORY

You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan.

Everyone is. It's done.

RYAN

Okay, what we do here is brutal and

leaves people devastated, but there's

a dignity to the way I do it.

CRAIG GREGORY

Stabbing people in the chest

instead of the back?

NATALIE

You wanted to see me?

RYAN

Yeah, why don't you come in.

CRAIG GREGORY

Great job in there, Nat.

NATALIE

Thank you. How's everyone taking it?

RYAN

(TO NATALIE)

Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And

you have some good ideas. But you

know nothing of the realities of my

job. Sure, you can set up an iChat...

but you don't know how people think.

NATALIE

Actually, I minored in psychology.

CRAIG GREGORY

Nice.

RYAN

(TO NATALIE)

Okay kiddo, fire me.

30.

CRAIG GREGORY

Ryan, stop it.

RYAN

She's going to be doing this on a

regular basis. You don't want to

know if she can fire somebody?

CRAIG GREGORY

She just fired Ned.

RYAN

My dog could fire Ned.

(TO NATALIE)

Fire me.

CRAIG GREGORY

Ryan.

NATALIE

It's okay, I got this.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you

that your position is no longer

available.

RYAN

Who the hell are you?

NATALIE

My name is Miss Keener and I'm here

today to discuss your future.

RYAN

My future? I don't know you. The

only person who can fire me is

Craig Gregory.

NATALIE

Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this

for him.

RYAN

Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory

hired me and he's the only one who can

fire me. I'm going to talk to him.

NATALIE

Mr. Bingham...

31.

RYAN

You can't follow me... You're on a

computer screen. Remember?

NATALIE

(FRUSTRATED)

Ryan...

RYAN

Try again. Fire me.

NATALIE

I just did.

RYAN

Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.

CRAIG GREGORY

Stop it, Ryan.

NATALIE

(IGNORES CRAIG)

Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to

inform you that your position is no

longer available.

RYAN

I'm fired?

NATALIE

Yes, you're fired.

RYAN

(ASIDE)

Never say fired.

NATALIE

You've been let go.

RYAN

Why?

NATALIE

(breaks the moment)

This is a mythical situation. How

could I possibly know why?

RYAN

You never know why. Why doesn't

matter.

32.

NATALIE

(back on track)

It's important not to focus on the

"why" and rather to spend your

energy thinking about your future.

RYAN

I'm going to spend my energy on

suing you if you don't give me a

reason that you're firing me.

NATALIE

Mr. Bingham, the reason is not

important.

RYAN

Oh, so you're firing me without

grounds.

(TO CRAIG)

Now, I really have a lawsuit.

CRAIG GREGORY

Ryan, I think we know what you're

trying to say...

NATALIE

(still in character)

Don't take this personally, Mr.

Bingham.

RYAN

Personally?

(quiet and calm)

This is the most personal situation

you will ever enter. So before you

try to revolutionize my business,

I'd like to know that you actually

know my business.

CRAIG GREGORY

Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the

team.

33.

RYAN

Am I the only one who sees that by

automating our own business, we're

making ourselves irrelevant.

CRAIG GREGORY

(frankly...)

No... We're making you irrelevant.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Hey, don't blame me. Blame fuel

costs. Blame insurance premiums.

Blame technology.

(A BEAT)

Watch yourself, Ryan. You're too

young to be a dinosaur...

RYAN

I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur.

CRAIG GREGORY

I want you to show her the ropes.

RYAN

What do I know about what happens

around here? Have Ferguson do it.

CRAIG GREGORY

I'm not talking about here.

RYAN

No.

CRAIG GREGORY

Hey, you seem pretty confident that this

girl doesn't know what she's doing...

RYAN

Excuse me. I just don't think a

MySpace page qualifies you to

rewire an entire company.

CRAIG GREGORY

Great. Well, here's your chance.

Show her the magic. Take her

through the paces.

RYAN

I'm not a fucking tour guide.

34.

CRAIG GREGORY

(re: his hand)

This is the boat.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

(re: his finger)

This is you.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Do you want to be in the boat?

RYAN

Yes. Alone.

CRAIG GREGORY

Ryan, we're ringing the bell.

Rounding everybody up. If you want

to stay out there a little longer,

you can. But you're not going to be

on your own.

(begins to leave)

Let me know.

RYAN

Huh.

CUT TO:

35.

THE ROLL-AWAY

NATALIE

What?

CUT TO:

NATALIE

I really like my luggage.

RYAN

That's exactly what it is. Luggage.

(off of Natalie's look)

You know how much time you lose by

checking in?

NATALIE

I don't know, maybe five minutes

waiting for...

36.

RYAN

Thirty five minutes per flight. I

travel two hundred seventy days a

year. That makes one hundred fifty

seven hours... That's Seven Days.

(points to her luggage)

You ready to throw away a whole

week on that?

RYAN

Bingo. Asians.

NATALIE

You can't be serious.

RYAN

Never get behind people travelling

with infants. I've never seen a

stroller collapse in less than

twenty minutes.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Old people are worse. Their bodies

are littered with hidden metal and

they never seem to appreciate how

little time they have left on Earth.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Five words. Randomly selected for

additional screening.

37.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Asians. They're light packers,

treasure efficiency, and have a thing

for slip-on shoes. God love'em.

NATALIE

That's racist.

RYAN

I'm like my mother. I stereotype.

It's faster.

RYAN

Are you upset at your laptop?

NATALIE

No. Why?

RYAN

Fats Domino had a lighter touch.

NATALIE

I type with purpose.

RYAN

What are you working on so

furiously?

NATALIE

I'm building a work flow of firing

techniques. Questions & responses.

Actions & reactions. A script that

works kind of like a tributary,

taking you through the steps of

firing someone.

RYAN

Who is it for?

38.

NATALIE

Theoretically, you could put it in

the hands of anybody and they could

be downsizing immediately. All they

have to do is follow the steps.

RYAN

Natalie, what is it, you think we

do here?

NATALIE

We prepare the newly unemployed for

the emotional and physical hurdles

of job hunting while... Minimizing

potential legal blowback?

RYAN

That's what we're selling. But it's

not what we're doing.

NATALIE

Okay, what are we doing?

RYAN

Our job is to make limbo tolerable -

To ferry wounded souls across the

river of dread and humiliation to

the point at which hope's bright

shore is dimly visible...

(FRANKLY)

And then to stop the boat, shove'em

in the water, and make them swim

while we row back to the palace of

their banishment to present the

employers with our bills.

NATALIE

That was really impressive. You

rehearse that?

RYAN

(TO NATALIE)

I got to grab this. I'll meet you

at the rental lot.

39.

RYAN

Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

INTERCUT WITH:

ALEX

I'm in Hotlanta. I need a rib joint

recommend bad.

RYAN

(SMILES)

Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

ALEX

You haven't called.

RYAN

You know, I didn't know what was

appropriate...

ALEX

Ryan, I'm not some waitress you

banged in a snow storm. The word

"Appropriate" has no place in our

collective vocabulary. I'm the woman

you don't have to worry about.

RYAN

This sounds like a trick.

ALEX

Next time you're worried about

manners - Don't. If you want to

call - Call. Just think of me as

yourself... only with a vagina.

RYAN

When am I going to see you?

40.

ALEX

I'm out of Hartsfield, into IAD,

then a connection at ORD into SDF.

RYAN

(COMPASSIONATE)

Oh... sorry.

ALEX

Tell me about it.

RYAN

How long is your layover in O'Hare?

They've got multiples into SDF...

Think you could push?

ALEX

(SMILES)

I can push.

RYAN

(to desk girl)

Ryan Bingham, from CTC.

41.

RYAN

All you have to do today is watch

and listen. When I talk about the

strategy packet. You hand them one

of these...

NATALIE

You ever find it strange that

termination comes with a packet.

RYAN

Everything important in life comes

with a packet.

RYAN

Thank you for coming by. As you're

probably well aware, this is a

tough economic climate and your

company is not immune.

RYAN

While I wish I was here with better

news, the reason you and I are

meeting is this is your final week

of employment here.

RYAN

This is not a time to look for

blame. Your position simply no

longer exists.

RYAN

I understand why you are saying

these things.

(MORE)

42.

RYAN (CONT'D)

It's perfectly natural to feel

this way. I want you to take the

next week to explore this strategy

packet...

RYAN

Fill out the skill set work

sheet... Use the hopes and dreams

diagram... And the tree of

aspirations.

RYAN

(WITH EMPHASIS)

The answers are all in there.

RYAN

The answers are all in there.

(ANOTHER PERSON)

The answers...

(ANOTHER PERSON)

The answers...

(ANOTHER PERSON)

... are-all-in-there.

CUT TO:

BOB

And what do you suggest I tell

them?

NATALIE

(A SUGGESTION)

Perhaps you're underestimating the

positive effect your career transition

may have on your children.

BOB

Positive effect?

43.

NATALIE

Well, tests have shown that

children under moderate trauma have

a tendency to apply themselves

academically as a method of coping.

BOB

Go fuck yourself. That's what my

kids'll think.

RYAN

Your children's admiration is

important to you?

BOB

Yeah. It was.

RYAN

(FRANKLY)

Well, I doubt they ever admired

you, Bob.

BOB

Hey asshole, aren't you here to

console me?

RYAN

I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake

up call. You know why kids love

athletes?

BOB

Because they screw lingerie models.

RYAN

No, that's why we love athletes.

Kids love them because they follow

their dreams.

BOB

Yeah, well I can't dunk.

RYAN

But you can cook.

BOB

What are you talking about?

44.

RYAN

Your resume says you minored in

French Culinary Arts. Most students

work the frier at KFC. You bussed

tables at Il Picatorre to support

yourself. Then you got out of

college and started working here.

(looks up at Bob)

How much did they first pay you to

give up on your dreams?

BOB

(FLAT)

Twenty seven thousand a year.

RYAN

At what point were you going to

stop and go back to what made you

happy?

RYAN

Do you believe in fate, Bob?

BOB

Fate?

RYAN

Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways

in which we wind up doing the

things we were meant to do.

BOB

(OFFERING)

I met my wife at a gas station.

RYAN

Exactly. Well, I think fate is

telling you to do something, Bob.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I see guys who work for the same

company their entire lives. Clock

in. Clock out. Never a moment of

happiness.

(pauses for effect)

Not everyone gets this kind of

opportunity.

(MORE)

45.

RYAN (CONT'D)

The chance for rebirth. If not for

yourself... Do it for your kids.

BUSINESS WOMAN

I've been waiting ten minutes. He just

waltzes in and gets to cut in line.

DESK CLERK

We reserve priority assistance for

our Hilton Honors members.

RYAN

You should look into it - The

promotions are great...

BUSINESS WOMAN

Fuck off.

46.

RYAN

You okay?

NATALIE

(COVERS QUICKLY)

Yeah. Fine.

NATALIE

Hungry, much?

RYAN

Our expense account allots for forty

dollars each on dinner. I plan on

grabbing every mile I can.

NATALIE

Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile

business. What's that all about? Are you

talking like frequent flier miles?

RYAN

Your really want to know?

NATALIE

(MOCK SERIOUS)

I'm dying to know.

RYAN

I don't spend a nickel, if I can help

it, unless it somehow profits my

mileage account. I'm not talking

hotel rooms and rental cars either,

but internet services, cell phone,

music downloads, teleflorists. The

works. I shop them according to the

miles they pay and I pit them against

each other for the most value.

47.

NATALIE

So, what are you saving up for?

Hawaii? South of France?

RYAN

No, it's not like that... The miles

are the goal.

NATALIE

That's it? You're saving to save?

RYAN

Let's just say I've got a number in

mind and haven't hit it yet.

NATALIE

Wow. Seems a little abstract.

What's your target?

RYAN

I'd rather not.

NATALIE

(TEASING)

It's a secret target?

RYAN

It's ten million miles.

NATALIE

Huh. Isn't ten million just a number?

RYAN

Pi is just a number.

NATALIE

I guess we all need a hobby.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your

collection. I get it. Sounds cool.

RYAN

I'd be the seventh person to do it.

More people have walked on the moon.

NATALIE

Do they give you a parade or something?

48.

RYAN

Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You

get to meet the Chief Pilot,

Maynard Finch. And... They put your

name on the side of a plane.

NATALIE

Men get such a hard-on from putting

their name on stuff... You guys

don't grow up - You just need to

pee on everything.

RYAN

Now, who's stereotyping?

NANCY

Fear of mortality. It's like Yes,

you're going to die one day.

RYAN

And why do you suppose that's singular

to men?

NATALIE

Probably cause you can't have babies.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

If I had that many miles, I'd just

show up at the airport, look up at

one of those big destination

boards, pick a place and go.

INTERCUT WITH:

49.

RYAN

(CHUCKLES)

Thanks for the advice.

RYAN

Man alive.

NATALIE

Left, left, left, left... one more

inch... and stop.

NATALIE

I don't get it.

RYAN

My sister is cooky. She thinks this is

charming... Like the gnome thing.

50.

NATALIE

No, I mean... why would your sister

want a fake photo in front of the

St. Louis Airport?

RYAN

She should be so lucky to visit Lambert

Field. The Wright Brothers flew through

there...

(points out the conical

MAIN TERMINAL)

The domed main terminal was the

first of its kind. A precursor to

everything from JFK to DeGualle.

NATALIE

(LAME)

Wow. Pretty sweet.

RYAN

Why she wants dozens of reminders

of all the places she hasn't been

is beyond me.

NATALIE

Well, I'm sure she's going to be

crushed for having missed this airport.

RYAN

Look - Before Lindbergh could cross

the Atlantic, he took off from one of

those runways... Ever wondered why

they call it the Spirit of St. Louis?

NATALIE

(QUICKLY)

No.

YOUNG ASIAN GUY

... And another thing...? You know

how fucked this place is without me?

You know how fucked this place is

without me? Fucked in the ass, man.

(MORE)

51.

YOUNG ASIAN GUY (cont'd)

I am the one thing preventing this

place from being totally fucked in

the ass.

RYAN

Sometimes, they just need to vent.

NATALIE

Please, for the love of God, can I

fire the next one?

CUT TO:

KAREN

I'm here to be fired, right?

NATALIE

We're here to talk about your future.

KAREN

You don't have to sugar coat it. I get

the drill. What are they offering?

NATALIE

Inside the packet you'll find a

clearly worked out severance package.

KAREN

Give me the bullet points.

NATALIE

Three months pay. Six months

medical. A full year of placement

services through our company, CTC.

KAREN

Placement services? How generous.

52.

NATALIE

Commonly, it takes one month of

searching for every ten thousand

dollars you expect to earn in salary.

KAREN

So I could be looking for a while.

NATALIE

Not necessarily...

KAREN

Oh, don't sweat it. I'm pretty

confident about my plans.

NATALIE

(SPIRITS LIFTED)

Oh yeah?

KAREN

Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide

in the morning or the evening?

NATALIE

I don't know. Why?

KAREN

There's this beautiful bridge by my

apartment. I need to figure out

what time to jump off it.

RYAN

People say these things all the

time. It comes with the trade.

NATALIE

They do?

RYAN

Sure. People are always saying

crazy stuff. They get worked up.

NATALIE

She was so calm.

53.

RYAN

(not quite sure)

I think that's a good sign.

NATALIE

So they don't actually ever do it?

RYAN

No... it's just talk.

NATALIE

How do you know? Do you follow up?

RYAN

I mean, no, nothing good can come

of that, but I don't think you

should worry about it.

RYAN (CONT'D)

This is the job. Taking people at

their most fragile moment and

setting them adrift.

BEGIN MONTAGE

54.

NATALIE

I'll be back soon. Not really sure

how long this whole exercise is

supposed to last. He's fine... It's

hard for these guys to accept

change, you know.

(listens, rolls eyes)

I... I'm not even going to answer

that... No, I can't even think of

him that way... He's old.

RYAN

Okay. This is where it gets a

little difficult, but stay with me.

You have a new backpack... but this

time, I want you to fill it with

people. Start with casual

acquaintances, people around the

office, friends of friends and work

your way to the people you trust

with your most intimate secrets.

Now move into family members -

cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get

your sisters and your brothers and

you parents. Get them all in that

backpack. And finally your husband

or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend.

Get them in their too.

55.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Don't worry. I'm not going to ask

you to light it on fire.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Feel the weight of that bag. Make

no mistake, your relationships are

the heaviest components of your

life. Feel the straps cutting into

your shoulders. All those

negotiations and arguments and

secrets and compromises.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Now set that bag down.

RYAN (CONT'D)

You don't need to carry all that

weight.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Some animals were meant to carry

each other. To live symbiotically

over a lifetime. Star-crossed

lovers. Monogamous swans. We are

not one of those animals.

RYAN (CONT'D)

The slower we move, the faster we

die. We are not swans. We're

sharks.

56.

NATALIE

Never...?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

You never want to get married?

Never want kids?

RYAN

Is that so bizarre?

NATALIE

Yes. Yes it is.

RYAN

I don't see the value.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Sell it to me.

NATALIE

What?

RYAN

Sell me marriage.

NATALIE

I... Uh... How how about love?

RYAN

Pff...

57.

NATALIE

Okay. Stability?

RYAN

How many stabile marriages do you

know?

NATALIE

Someone to talk to, spend your life

with?

RYAN

I'm surrounded by people to talk

to. I doubt that will change.

NATALIE

How about just not dying alone?

RYAN

Starting when I was twelve, we

moved each one of my grandparents

into a nursing facility. My parents

went the same way.

(A BEAT)

Make no mistake. We all die alone.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(ADDING)

Those cult members down in San

Diego with the white sneakers and

little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They

didn't die alone.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Just saying - There's options.

RYAN

(ALMOST SILENT)

Oh fuck.

58.

NATALIE

Brian left me.

RYAN

Oh, hey... I...

RYAN

Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie,

this is my... friend, Alex.

ALEX

I should give you both a moment.

NATALIE

No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just

stupid emotions.

ALEX

Maybe a drink?

NATALIE

Now we're talking.

CUT TO:

59.

ALEX

He broke up with you over text

message?

RYAN

(SOFT DIG)

That's kind of like firing people

over the internet.

ALEX

(re: the ex-boyfriend)

What a weasely prick.

NATALIE

Yeah, but what does that make me?

Someone who falls for a prick?

ALEX

We all fall for them. Pricks are

spontaneous, unpredictable, and

fun. And then we're surprised when

they turn out to be pricks.

NATALIE

I followed him to Omaha.

RYAN

You did?

NATALIE

I had a job waiting for me in San

Fran, when he got an offer from

ConAgra. He told me we could start

a life together. So I followed him.

RYAN

To Nebraska.

NATALIE

I look in the mirror and I just see

compromise... I'm supposed to do

something.

ALEX

You'll do plenty.

NATALIE

I just can't... I thought I'd be

engaged by now.

(CATCHES HERSELF)

No offense.

60.

ALEX RYAN

NATALIE

When I was sixteen, I thought by

twenty three, I would be married,

maybe have a kid... Corner office

by day, entertaining at night. I

was supposed to be driving a Grand

Cherokee by now.

ALEX

Life can underwhelm you that way.

NATALIE

Now I have my sights on twenty

nine, because thirty is just way

too... apocalyptic. I mean, where

did you think you'd be by...

ALEX

It doesn't work that way.

RYAN

At a certain point, you stop with

the deadlines.

ALEX

They can be a little counterproductive.

NATALIE

I don't want to say anything

that's... anti-feminist. I mean, I

really appreciate everything your

generation did for me.

ALEX

(my generation?)

It was our pleasure.

RYAN

Well done.

NATALIE

But sometimes it feels like no

matter how much success I have, it

all won't matter until I find the

right guy.

ALEX

You really thought this guy was the one.

61.

NATALIE

Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I

could have made it work. He just

really fit the bill.

RYAN

The bill?

NATALIE

My type. You know, white collar.

College grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny

movies. Six foot one. Brown hair.

Kind eyes. Works in finance but is

Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends.

(we think she's done)

I always imagined he'd have a

single syllable name like Matt or

John or... Dave. In a perfect

world, he drives a Four Runner and

the only thing he loves more than

me is his golden lab. Oh... and a

nice smile.

(back to Alex and Ryan)

How about you?

RYAN

I'm not sure if...

NATALIE

I meant Alex...

RYAN

Right.

ALEX

Huh, let me think for a sec.

(mulls it over)

Well, by the time you're thirty four,

all the physical requirements are

pretty much out the window. I mean you

secretly prey he'll be taller than you.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Not an asshole would be nice? Just

someone who enjoys my company. Comes

from a good family - You don't think

about that when you're younger.

(THINKING)

Wants kids... Likes kids...

(MORE)

62.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Wants kids. Healthy enough to play

catch with his future son one day.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Please let him earn more than I do.

That doesn't make sense now, but

believe me, it will one day. Otherwise

it's just a recipe for disaster.

(REACHING)

Hopefully some hair on his head...?

But it's not exactly a deal-breaker

anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice

smile just might do it.

NATALIE

Wow. That was depressing.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I should just date lesbians.

ALEX

Tried it. We're no picnic

ourselves.

NATALIE

I don't mind being married to my

career, and I don't expect it to

hold me in bed as I fall asleep.

(LOOKS UP)

I just don't want to settle.

ALEX

You're young. Right now you see

settling as some sort of failure.

NATALIE

It is. By definition.

ALEX

Don't worry, by the time someone is

right for you, it won't feel like

settling... And the only person

left to judge you will be the

twenty four year old girl with a

target on your back.

63.

NATALIE

So, what's the plan for this

evening?

NATALIE

What...? Oh, is it illicit?

RYAN

(QUICKLY)

No...

ALEX

It's nothing like that.

NATALIE

We are in Miami.

RYAN

... We were going to hit that party

for the tech conference in the hotel.

NATALIE

I didn't know you could just attend

those...

ALEX

Well, I mean...

NATALIE

(EYES WIDEN)

You're going to crash it?

RYAN ALEX

NATALIE

No, I get it. I'm in!

64.

ALEX

Jennifer Chu?

NATALIE

Oh shit!

RYAN

It's going to be fine.

RYAN

(TO NATALIE)

You okay there?

NATALIE

Oh yeah... This was a great idea.

(TO ALEX)

You are so pretty. You're exactly what

I want to look like in fifteen years.

ALEX

Thank you, Natalie.

CONFERENCE LEADER

How's everyone doing out there?!

CONFERENCE LEADER

I'm going to need you to all put

your hands together for a very

special guest - YOUNG... M... C!

65.

YOUNG MC

THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE

FELLAS... TRY TO DO WHAT THOSE

LADIES TELL US... GET SHOT DOWN

CAUSE YOU'RE OVERZEALOUS... PLAY

HARD TO GET, FEMALES GET JEALOUS...

RYAN

Think she'll be okay?

ALEX

Look...

ALEX

Back home, I don't get to act the way

I do with you.

RYAN

That's why I don't have a "back home".

ALEX

I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty

Back Pack".

RYAN

You know about the back pack?

ALEX

I googled you.

RYAN

You did?

66.

ALEX

RYAN

ALEX

RYAN

ALEX

RYAN

ALEX

RYAN

(smiles, continues story)

ALEX

RYAN

ALEX

67.

RYAN

Right?

(relives it for a second)

So just as we're hovering over the

hospital, I sit up. And from there,

I could see the whole western

horizon. We'd been flying twenty

minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a

city I'd thought of as remote,

halfway across the state... a

foreign capital.

(A BEAT)

My parents had taught me we lived

in the best place on Earth, but now

I could see the world was really

just one place and comparing didn't

make much sense. And I remember

thinking - Don't tell me this isn't

an age of miracles. Don't tell me

we can't be everywhere at once.

RYAN

I don't know what originally

sparked the back pack. I probably

needed to be alone. Recently, I've

been thinking that maybe I needed

to empty the bag before I knew what

to put back in.

SOFTWARE DUDE

Hey... I think we're out of gas.

68.

RYAN

Hey, you're up...

ALEX

Got to fly stand-by and make a

meeting in Milwaukee.

RYAN

(DISAPPOINTED)

Oh... Okay.

ALEX

(notices, teasing)

Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.

RYAN

Yeah, all right... Just leave the

money on the dresser.

ALEX

(SWEETLY)

I'll text you later so we can swap

schedules.

RYAN

I can't remember the last time I

enjoyed spending time with someone

as much as you.

ALEX

Neither can I.

69.

NATALIE

Last night got a little out of

hand. I said things... I don't

remember everything I said. I just

didn't want you to think...

RYAN

Just relax. It was nice to see you

cut loose. So, did you wake him up

or slip out?

NATALIE

What?

RYAN

This morning... Your new friend.

Did you wake him for an awkward

good bye or just slip out so he

could feel like a whore.

NATALIE

(NOT PROUD)

I... just left.

RYAN

Protocol is always tricky.

NATALIE

I didn't know what was right.

RYAN

Sometimes there really is no right

thing to do.

70.

NATALIE

(a good lie)

NATALIE

71.

RYAN

It's simple, you know that moment

when you look into someone's eyes

and you feel them looking right

into your soul, and the whole world

goes quiet for a second.

NATALIE

(finally, a break through)

Yes.

RYAN

Right. Well, I don't.

NATALIE

You're an asshole.

RYAN

Oh come on, I'm just dicking

around. I need your help...

NATALIE

Don't you think it's worth giving

her a chance?

RYAN

A chance to what?

NATALIE

A chance at something real?

RYAN

Natalie, your definition of "real"

is going to evolve as you get

older...

NATALIE

Would you stop condescending for

one second? Or is that one of the

principles of your bullshit

philosophy?

RYAN

Bullshit philosophy?

NATALIE

The isolation? The traveling? Is

that supposed to be charming?

RYAN

No, it's simply a life choice.

72.

NATALIE

It's a cocoon of self-banishment.

RYAN

Wow. Big words.

NATALIE

Screw you.

RYAN

Well, screw you too.

NATALIE

You've set up a way of life that

basically makes it impossible for

you to make any human connections.

Now, somehow, this woman runs the

gauntlet of your ridiculous "life

choice" and comes out the other end

with a smile - Just so you can call

her casual. Jesus. I need to grow

up? You're a twelve year old.

RYAN

I don't have a gauntlet of...

RYAN

... Fuck!

73.

RYAN

These Detroit guys can be tough.

They've been getting hammered. Don't

get distracted. Stick to the simple

stuff. Get the packet in their hands

and get them out the door.

CRAIG GREGORY

Welcome to Detroit.

RYAN

What's going on here?

74.

CRAIG GREGORY

I've been getting those great

numbers over the last few days.

Thought we should nut up and give

this a try.

RYAN

We could use a little more time.

CRAIG GREGORY

Gotta leave the nest at some point.

RYAN

This is a real company, Craig.

We're here to do some damage.

CRAIG GREGORY

I know. Good thing we brought our

best. So let's stop screwing

around, alright?

RYAN

Just give me a minute to prepare

and get my things together.

CRAIG GREGORY

I was thinking Natalie takes this one.

RYAN

She's hardly ready for this.

CRAIG GREGORY

I've been watching her. She's great.

RYAN

(re: the webcam)

This is a whole other animal...

CRAIG GREGORY

I mean, she created it. Natalie,

you not up for it?

NATALIE

I'm... I'm game.

CRAIG GREGORY

Atta girl.

75.

RYAN

Just remember, don't apologize.

Don't tell them how hard this is

for you. Today is one of the worst

days they will ever have. What we

feel doesn't even compare.

NATALIE

Got it.

RYAN

Just keep it professional. You're

going to do fine.

NATALIE

Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is

Natalie Keener.

SAMUELS

(checking out the PC)

What's going on here?

NATALIE

I wish I was here with better news,

however your position here at

Deckers is no longer available.

SAMUELS

What are you talking about?

NATALIE

You've been let go.

76.

SAMUELS

What, just like that? I can't

believe... Who are you?

NATALIE

My name is Miss Keener. I am here

to tell you about your options...

SAMUELS

I work here for seventeen years and

they send some fourth grader in here

to can me? What the fuck is this?!

NATALIE

It's perfectly normal to be upset.

However, the sooner you can tell

yourself that there are greater

opportunities waiting for you...

SAMUELS

Greater opportunities? I'm fifty-

seven-fucking years old!

NATALIE

Anybody who ever built an empire,

or changed the world, sat where you

are now. And it's because they sat

there that they were able to do it.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

There's a packet in front of you.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I want you to take some time and

review it.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

All the answers you're looking for

are inside those pages.

(MORE)

77.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

The sooner you trust the process,

the sooner your next step in life

will unveil itself.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I need you to return to your office

now and begin to put together your

personal things.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Mr. Samuels? There's nothing else

we can discuss now.

(AND AGAIN)

Thank you for your time.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Mr. Samuels... Mr. Samuels.... MR.

SAMUELS...

RYAN

You did good.

RYAN (CONT'D)

You okay? Want me to take over.

NATALIE

No, I'm alright.

78.

RYAN (CONT'D)

... We just got out here. That was

one place. I think we need to try a

few more...

Maybe there isn't a difference, but

it's comforting to know we're in

the next room.

(LISTENING)

I know you don't give a shit about

my comfort.

(LISTENS)

We could just use a little more

time. That's all I'm saying.

(LISTENS)

Right... Right.

(shakes his head)

Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye.

RYAN (CONT'D)

He thought you did a great job. You

did - I was real proud of you.

NATALIE

Thanks.

RYAN

We're being pulled off the road.

(CLARIFYING)

We're going home.

NATALIE

For good?

RYAN

That's what it looks like.

79.

NATALIE

I'm sorry about what I said about

Alex. I was out of line.

RYAN

It's alright. I understand.

NATALIE

I mean, who am I to be dolling out

relationship advice?

RYAN

It's fine.

NATALIE

You going to be okay?

RYAN

What do you mean?

NATALIE

In Omaha?

RYAN

Oh, I don't know.

NATALIE

It's better than you'd think.

NATALIE

Ryan, where are you going?

RYAN

Grabbing another flight... Something

I need to take care of. I'll see you

in, uh... at home.

80.

RYAN (O.C.)

Okay, start walking it in from the left.

ALEX

I have to admit, when you asked me to

meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd

gamble, make out in a heart shaped

jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird

French Canadian circus shows.

RYAN

There'll be plenty of time for all that.

(directing the photo)

One more foot to the left.

ALEX

How do you feel about the wedding?

RYAN

I'm fine, I guess.

(directing the photo)

Okay great... walk away.

ALEX

They're a cute couple.

RYAN

Think so?

ALEX

Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're

lucky, maybe look a little like you.

RYAN

How do you like Wisconsin in February?

ALEX

Who doesn't?

(SWEETLY)

(MORE)

81.

ALEX (CONT'D)

I like it if you're there. Besides, I

know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

RYAN

Northern Wisconsin.

(CLARIFYING)

What are you doing this weekend?

ALEX (CONT'D)

No...

RYAN

What? I haven't even...

ALEX

I can't.

RYAN

Why not?

ALEX

I couldn't.

RYAN

I'm being serious.

ALEX

You want me to be your date?

RYAN

Well... Yeah.

ALEX

To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your

sister's wedding?

RYAN

It's not like I know her that well.

ALEX

I'm just not sure if it's

appropriate for me to...

RYAN

Look. You know. I'm not the wedding

type. But for the first time in my

life... I don't want to be that

guy, alone with his drink. I want a

dancing partner. I want a plus one.

And if you can stomach it, I'd like

it to be you.

82.

ALEX

Okay.

RYAN

Really?

ALEX

Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah,

I'm in. When is it?

RYAN

I feel like we should kiss or

something.

ALEX

Then kiss me.

RYAN

(to the CHECK-IN LADY)

Are you available?

83.

CHECK-IN LADY

Sorry, this line is for members of

our Matterhorn program.

KARA

Ryan?

RYAN

Kara...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Alex, this is my sister Kara.

KARA

Well, hello.

ALEX

Hi.

KARA

(quite frankly...)

Ryan has told me nothing about you.

RYAN

Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?

KARA

Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have

to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are

trying out a trial separation.

RYAN

You're not staying at the house?

KARA

There was an extra room on hold

here, so I just took it for the

weekend.

84.

RYAN

Oh, okay.

KARA

Yup. So, you guys are dating?

RYAN

Um...

ALEX

It's not exactly...

KARA

Hey, don't worry about it. We're

all getting a little old to be

calling someone girlfriend... I

remember when mom used to call Jack

her boyfriend. It drove me up the

wall. Boyfriends are for kids...

(MOCK ANNOUNCING)

And I'm just a divorcee!

RYAN

So, the rehearsal dinner?

KARA

Yeah, I'll see you two there.

RYAN

There's a packet.

ALEX

What in life is worth doing that

doesn't have a packet.

RYAN

Um, I love you?

85.

JULIE

Oh my God, Ryan!

JULIE (CONT'D)

You must be Alex. You are so

beautiful. Kara was right. Did you

get the basket?

ALEX

The basket was very lovely.

JULIE

Tammy wrapped all of them.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Ryan, you look so grown up.

RYAN

Me? You're the one getting married.

JULIE

I know, right? You haven't even

seen my ring.

JULIE (CONT'D)

(PROUDLY)

Jim designed it.

RYAN

I brought those photos you were

asking for...

86.

JULIE

(LIGHTS UP)

Oh great! They go over there.

RYAN

There were quite a few already up

there. Almost couldn't find room.

JULIE

I know, isn't it great how everyone

chipped in?

RYAN

What gave you the idea to do

something so...

ALEX

(HELPS)

... Substantial?

JULIE

Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg

invested in this real estate

venture right now. So when we went

over our finances, a honeymoon just

didn't seem affordable this

second... So I thought... Hey, just

because we can't travel doesn't

mean we can't have pictures.

ALEX

It was a great idea.

JULIE

Thanks.

CUT TO:

87.

JIM

It's sixty acres up against the

foothills. I subdivided the old

Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice

for myself.

RYAN

Sounds nice.

JIM

Homes will go in the high fours.

RYAN

Must be a nice development.

JIM

(CORRECTING)

It's a community, not a development.

The concept is turn-key everything.

You buy a maintenance contract with

the home. We'll whack your weeds,

we'll even change the light bulb.

Furniture? You buy your own or choose

a package. Seamless traditionalism,

yet all the perks.

RYAN

Nice.

JIM

We all need a place to call our

own. This is America. This is what

we were promised.

RYAN

That's a nice touch.

JIM

What?

RYAN

That bit at the end about

promise... I like it.

88.

JIM

(a little embarrassed)

Thanks.

(LEADING)

So, you still renting that one-

bedroom?

RYAN

I gave it up.

JIM

(SURPRISED)

You own now?

RYAN

No.

JIM

But you're looking?

RYAN

Not really. No.

TAMMY

Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How

are you going to sleep?

JULIE

I don't know!

TAMMY

You want some Xanax?

RYAN

I don't think that's for sleeping.

JULIE

No, I'm good. I'll have some warm

milk. That should do the trick.

JIM

One more box...

89.

ALEX

I'll get it.

RYAN

You sure?

ALEX

Yeah, yeah...

RYAN

Jim seems like a good guy.

JULIE

Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?

KARA

He's going to make a great husband.

RYAN

Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with

dad not being... Well, I didn't

know if you had someone to walk you

down the aisle...

JULIE

Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to

do it.

KARA

(UNCOMFORTABLE)

He's been really supportive.

RYAN

Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to

make sure you were covered. So I

should get there at...

JULIE

Guests are arriving around 5ish.

Things get going at 530. So you

know, around then. It's easy. Just

come down the elevator.

90.

RYAN

Hey Kara?

KARA

Yeah.

RYAN

Can you believe she's getting

married already? She's just a kid.

KARA

No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years

old. She's barely squeaking by.

RYAN

Oh.

KARA

Yup. Sleep tight.

FADE TO:

ALEX

That's all you got?

RYAN

Are we really doing this?

ALEX

Give me a boost.

91.

RYAN

I took geography in here.

(POINTING)

That was my seat.

ALEX

You ever fool around with one of

your teachers?

RYAN

No. You?

ALEX

Not until college. Come on, show me

around.

RYAN (O.C.)

That's me.

ALEX

You played basketball?

RYAN

Point guard. Don't act so surprised.

ALEX

I didn't know you were such a jock.

RYAN

My first fight.

92.

ALEX

How'd it go?

RYAN

Got my ass kicked.

RYAN

This is where we used to go to make out.

ALEX

Very romantic.

CUT TO:

ALEX

I'm really happy I came here.

RYAN

(to the team)

Go Cougars!

RYAN

(checks caller ID)

It's Kara.

INTERCUT WITH:

93.

KARA

Ryan, where are you? We're having a

meltdown here.

RYAN

What's wrong? What happened?

KARA

It's Jim. Can you get back here? We

need your help.

RYAN

Yeah, of course...

ALEX

I'll grab your suit.

(ADDING)

Good luck.

RYAN

What happened?

KARA

Jim's got cold feet.

RYAN

Today?

KARA

That's how cold feet work.

RYAN

What do you want me to do?

KARA

Talk to him.

RYAN

You want me to talk to him?

94.

KARA

Hey, it's either you or me. You know my

record. I've already struck out once.

RYAN

I haven't been to bat. I haven't

been in the dugout.

KARA

Don't you talk for a living?

Motivational type stuff?

RYAN

I tell people how to avoid commitment.

KARA

What kind of fucked up message is that?

RYAN

It's a philosophy.

KARA

It's stupid.

RYAN

Hey, it might have helped you.

KARA

Come on, Ryan. You haven't been

around much. Fuck, you basically

don't exist to us. I know you want

to be there for her... Well here it

is. This is your chance.

JIM

Ryan?

RYAN

Oh, hey Jim.

95.

JIM

You ever read this?

RYAN

Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.

JIM

I'll say.

RYAN

Kara mentioned you were having

some... thoughts?

JIM

I don't think I can do this.

RYAN

Okay. What makes you say that today?

JIM

I was just laying there last night

in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was

thinking about the wedding and the

ceremony and all. Us buying a house

and moving in together. Having a

kid... Having another kid...

(begins to snowball)

... Thanksgiving, Christmas, spring

break, football games, all of a sudden

they're out of school, getting jobs,

getting married, And then, you know...

I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before

you know it - I'm dead... and I just

kept thinking... "What's the point?"

JIM (CONT'D)

(now asking Ryan directly)

I mean what is the point?

RYAN

The point?

JIM

Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?

RYAN

(DANCING)

It's marriage... it's the most

beautiful thing on Earth... you

know, what everyone aspires to...

96.

JIM

You never got married.

RYAN

That's true...

JIM

You never even tried.

RYAN

Well, it's hard to define "try".

JIM

You seem happier than most of my

married friends.

RYAN

Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage

can be a pain in the ass. And

you're kind of right - All of this

is just stuff on the way to your

eventual demise.

CUT TO:

BACK TO:

RYAN (CONT'D)

We are all on running clocks that

cannot be slowed down or paused and

they all lead to the same place.

Some guys leave marks that last

beyond their own mortality. Not guys

like you and me... But some. But

even those footprints disappear.

(A BEAT)

There isn't a "point".

RYAN (CONT'D)

I'm not the guy you'd normally want

to talk to about all this stuff...

But think about it - your favorite

memories. The greatest moments of

your life? Were you alone?

97.

JIM

(thinks about it)

No... I guess not.

RYAN

I don't want to sound like a

Hallmark card, but... Life? It's

better with company.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Come to think of it... Last night,

the night before your wedding, when

all this shit was circling through

your head... Weren't you two

sleeping in separate rooms?

JIM

Yeah, Julie went back to the

apartment and I was all alone in

that big honeymoon suite...

RYAN

Kind of lonely?

JIM

Yeah.

RYAN

Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.

JIM

That's a nice touch.

RYAN

Thanks.

JIM

What's the mood like out there?

RYAN

It's not good... Emotional.

JIM

What should I do?

RYAN

(twinkle in his eye)

Go get her.

98.

JIM

I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up...

Will you be my co-pilot?

KARA

Welcome home.

RYAN

Hi, I'm Ryan.

WEDDING GUEST

I'm your cousin... Harold.

RYAN

Oh, hey!

99.

ALEX

When am I going to see you?

RYAN

You're just going to have to come

and visit.

ALEX

So settled down. You're not going

to change on me...

RYAN

Same guy. Just one address.

ALEX

Call me if you get lonely.

RYAN

... I'm lonely.

CUT TO:

100.

NATALIE

... Some guy sits down in a

conference room somewhere and a

server routes their session to one

of our termination engineers.

RYAN

You don't actually call them that.

NATALIE

I prefer "terminators", but it

bumped with legal.

RYAN

Really? I can't imagine why.

NATALIE

They follow a workflow that can take

them through anything from a standard

dismissal to a violent aggressor.

RYAN

Are they actually on line, right now?

NATALIE

No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing.

We go live at the end of the month.

(catches one of the guys

making a mistake)

Kyle, you're running through the

events too quickly. You have to give

them time to acknowledge each

statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.

RYAN

This is ridiculous.

101.

GOALQUEST HOST

You ready to rock?

RYAN

Last year, I flew three hundred

fifty thousand miles. The moon is

only two fifty.

RYAN

Imagine for a second that you're

carrying a backpack... I want you

to feel the straps on your

shoulders... You feel them?

102.

RYAN

Now, I want you to pack it with all

the stuff you have in your life.

Start with the little things.

RYAN

The... um... The stuff in drawers

and on shelves.

RYAN

Excuse me.

GOALQUEST HOST

(TO RYAN)

What the fuck are you doing?

(TO CROWD)

Okay, everyone just relax. We'll

have your next guest out in a sec.

103.

RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT

Hey, you forgot to give me your

Devotion Club card!

RYAN

Surprise.

MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)

Honey, who's at the door?

ALEX

(ALMOST INAUDIBLE)

What are you doing here?

ALEX'S HUSBAND

Who was that?

104.

ALEX

... just some guy who was lost.

RYAN

How could you lie to me?

INTERCUT WITH:

ALEX

What were you thinking - Just

showing up at my door like that?

RYAN

What do you mean? I wanted to see

you. I didn't know you had a family

- Why didn't you tell me that?

ALEX

Come on, I thought we signed up for

the same thing.

RYAN

Try to help me understand. What is

it you signed up for?

ALEX

I thought our relationship was

perfectly clear. You're...

(MORE)

105.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(a long beat)

... an escape.

RYAN

I'm an escape?

ALEX

You know, a break from our normal

lives... A parenthesis.

RYAN

I'm a parenthesis?

ALEX

Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe

we're having this conversation. I

mean what do you want?

ALEX (CONT'D)

You don't even know what you want.

I'm sorry that I ruined your night...

But you could have seriously screwed

things up for me. That was my family.

That's my real life.

RYAN

I thought I was a part of your real life.

ALEX

(SIGHS)

Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't

hold a grudge. When you're ready to

be an adult and see me again, just

give me a call.

PLUCKY TICKET AGENT

Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

106.

RYAN

Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?

PLUCKY TICKET AGENT

Of course. Left side aisle, non-

bulkhead. Just like you like it.

RYAN

What's got you so fucking happy?

PLUCKY TICKET AGENT

Your boarding card, Mr. Bingham.

PURSER

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a

special announcement to make.

PURSER (CONT'D)

Our pilot has just informed me that we

are passing over the city of Mesa...

which might not mean much to most of

you, but means a lot to one of our

fliers today, because he just hit

TEN... MILLION... MILES...

RYAN

Oh no...

MAYNARD FINCH

(TO RYAN)

That seat taken?

107.

MAYNARD FINCH

You're the youngest yet to hit

twenty mil. Don't know where you

found the time...

(REMEMBERS)

Oh right, here you go.

MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D)

Seventh card we've made. Small club.

We really appreciate your loyalty.

RYAN

You know how many times I've

thought about this moment? Played

out the conversation I'd have with

you right here.

MAYNARD FINCH

Really? What did you want to say?

RYAN

You know, I... I can't remember.

MAYNARD FINCH

That's alright. Happens to all of us.

(attempts chit chat)

So, where you from?

RYAN

I'm from here.

AIRLINE OPERATOR

Hello, Mr. Bingham.

108.

RYAN

Oh, how did you know it was me?

AIRLINE OPERATOR

This is your dedicated line. We

reserve them for our most loyal and

dedicated fliers.

RYAN

Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my

miles. Can you open up an account

under Jim and Julie Miller?

AIRLINE OPERATOR

Certainly. How many miles would you

like to transfer?

RYAN

How many miles would it take to

circle the globe?

AIRPORT OPERATOR

We have our "around-the-world" tickets.

They're five hundred thousand miles each.

RYAN

Sounds perfect.

CRAIG GREGORY

Got a second?

RYAN

(to the airline operator)

I'm going to have to call you right back.

CRAIG GREGORY

What happened to you yesterday? I

was trying to reach you all day.

RYAN

I got tied up in... personal stuff.

What's going on?

CRAIG GREGORY

Do you remember Karen Barnes?

109.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

She was part of a thirty person

reduction a few weeks back in

Wichita. Natalie fired her.

RYAN

No, I fire dozens of people a day.

CRAIG GREGORY

She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.

RYAN

Fuck.

CRAIG GREGORY

(AGREES)

Yeah.

(FORMALITY)

Do you remember anyone giving you any

signals of anything? Depression?

RYAN

They're all depressed. We're firing them.

CRAIG GREGORY

Hey, look, you know I have to ask.

RYAN

No, I don't remember anything. Of

course they're upset. You never

think that...

CRAIG GREGORY

Wasn't any woman who gave you any

indication...? Anything?

RYAN

No, nothing that stands out.

(A THOUGHT)

Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?

CRAIG GREGORY

Natalie quit.

RYAN

Just like that?

CRAIG GREGORY

Text message.

110.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No

one has manners anymore.

RYAN

She say where she was going?

CRAIG GREGORY

Nah. She was pretty upset.

RYAN

I should give her a call.

CRAIG GREGORY

(BUSINESS)

I need you back in the air.

CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)

Did you hear me? I thought you'd be

thrilled.

RYAN

I'm fine. What about video conferencing?

CRAIG GREGORY

CTC is pausing on the whole new media

front for a moment. Giving it a little

more thought. Getting our work horses

back out doing what they do best.

RYAN

How long are you sending me out?

CRAIG GREGORY

We're going to let you sail and

sail. Send us a postcard if you

ever get there.

MANAGER

So, what happened?

111.

NATALIE

How exactly do you mean?

MANAGER

You graduated top of your class.

You seemed to have your pick of

employment... Including right here.

Instead, you went to Omaha... to

fire people for a living.

NATALIE

(OBVIOUS COVER)

It's challenging work.

MANAGER

I can't imagine doing that day-in-

day-out. Not in this climate.

NATALIE

(after a beat)

... I followed a boy.

MANAGER

Everybody does at one point or

another.

MANAGER

This guy says I'd be lucky to have

you.

RYAN (V.O.)

To whom it may concern, I can't even

count the number of people I've fired

in my lifetime. So many, that I've

forgotten what it's like to actually

hire somebody. We've never met, but I

know you'd be lucky to have Natalie

Keener. My advice? Take her and don't

look back. She'll be the best

decision you've made in a long time.

112.

MANAGER

Hope he's right.

RYAN (V.O.)

Tonight, most people will be

welcomed home by jumping dogs and

squealing kids. Their spouses will

ask about their day and tonight

they'll sleep.

RYAN (V.O.)

The stars will wheel forth from their

daytime hiding places.

RYAN (V.O.)

And one of those lights, slightly

brighter than the rest, will be my

wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
