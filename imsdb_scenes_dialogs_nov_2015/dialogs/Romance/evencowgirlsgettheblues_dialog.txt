EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES

SHOOTING DRAFT

1993

THE CHART KEEPER

She is restless tonight.

ANOTHER INDIAN

She dreams of loving.

STILL ANOTHER

She has the blues.

BIG THUMBS

UNCLE

Well, you're lucky that you don't

suck 'em.

DADDY

Sissy couldn't suck 'em, she'd need

a mouth like a fish tank.

UNCLE

(agrees)

The poor little tyke might have a

hard time finding herself a hubby.

But as far as getting along in the

world, it's a real blessing that

Sissy's a girl-child. Lord, I reckon

this youngun would never make a

mechanic.

DADDY

Nope, and not a brain surgeon,

neither.

UNCLE

Course she'd do pretty good as a

butcher. She could retire in two

years on the overcharges alone.

UNCLE (O.S.)

One thing, that youngun would make

one hell of a hitchhiker...

UNCLE (O.S.)

...if she was a boy, I mean.

DR. DREYFUS

She is, if I may speak frankly,

somewhat of a medical oddity. Due to

impaired dexterity, her life

activities and career potentialities

will be reduced. It could be worse.

Bring her back to me if there ever

is pain. Meanwhile, she will have to

learn to live with them.

MRS. HANKSHAW

That she will. That she will. The

Lord made them things big for a

purpose. God don't never git tired

of testing our kind. It's a punishment

of some sort, for what I don't rightly

know.

(whimpering)

Oh Doc, if a young man ever shows up

here with, a young man with ugly

fingers, you know, something similar,

a similar case, Doc, would you

please...

DR. DREYFUS

Remember the words of the painter

Paul Gauguin, dear lady. "The ugly

may be beautiful, the pretty never."

I don't suppose that means very much

to you.

MRS. HANKSHAW

It's a judgement. She's gotta bear

the punishment.

MADAME ZOE

I am the enlightened Madame Zoe.

MADAME ZOE

There is nothing about your past,

present or future that your hands do

not know, and there is nothing about

your hands that Madame Zoe does not

know. There is no hocus-pocus

involved. I am a scientist, not a

magician. I, Madame Zoe, chiromancer,

lifelong student of the moldings and

markings of the human hand. I, Madame

Zoe, to whom no facet of your

character or destiny is not readily

revealed. I am prepared to...

MADAME ZOE

Jesus fucking Christ!

MADAME ZOE

You have a strong will. Will power

and determination are indicated by

the first phalanx. The second phalanx

indicates reason and logic. You

obviously have both in large supply.

What's your name, dearie?

SISSY

Sissy.

MADAME ZOE

Hmmm. I'd say that you have an

intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic

nature. However, Sissy, however,

there is a heavy quality to the second

phalanx- the phalanx of logic --

that indicates a capacity for foolish

or clownish behavior, a refusal to

accept responsibility or to take

things seriously and bent to be

disrespectful of those who do. Your

mama tells me that you're pretty

well behaved and shy, but I'd watch

out for signs of irrationality. All

right?

MADAME ZOE

I guess the most important aspect of

your thumbs is the, ahem, over all

size. Uh, what was it, do you know,

that caused...?

MRS HANKSHAW

Don't know; the doctors don't know...

SISSY

Just lucky I guess.

MADAME ZOE

Do you study history in school?

Galileo, Descartes, Newton? Lebinitz

had very large thumbs; Voltaire's

were enormous, but, heh heh, just

pickles compared with yours.

SISSY

What about Crazy Horse?

MADAME ZOE

Crazy Horse? You mean the Indian?

Nobody that I've ever heard of ever

troubled to study the paws of savages.

Well, I guess that about covers the

three-fifty charge...

MRS. HANKSHAW

Husband.

MADAME ZOE

Beg your pardon?

MRS. HANKSHAW

Husband. Will she find a husband?

MADAME ZOE

Oh, I see.

MADAME ZOE

I see men in your life, honey. I

also see women, lots of women.

MADAME ZOE

A husband, no doubt about it, though

he is years away. There are children,

too. Five, maybe six, but the husband

is not the father. They will inherit

your characteristics.

COWGIRL INTERLUDE

(Delores del Ruby)

Welcome to the Rubber Rose Ranch

(the largest all-girl ranch in the west)

DELORES

I've traveled through the Yucatan

with a circus, popping false eyelashes

off a trained monkey with a bullwhip.

When I ate peyote one night and had

a vision. Niwetukame, the Mother

Goddess, came to me on the back of a

doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears

she was shedding, crying 'Delores,

you must lead my daughters against

their natural enemy. You must come

to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare

for your mission, the details of

which will be revealed to you in a

third vision....' That night I whipped

the shit out of my black lover and

ran away. For a while I drove around,

making a living selling peyote buttons

to hippies, until I made my way

here...

SISSY

Going north?

MAN

You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

MAN

(taking an alarming

interest in her thumbs)

Thanks.

SISSY

American Cheese. The king of road

food.

MAN

Are you in show business?

SISSY

I was a successful model once.

MAN

For magazines?

SISSY

I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene

Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got

laid off.

MAN

So now you're bummin' around?

SISSY

Yep.

MAN

Hitchhiking?

SISSY

I'm the best.

MAN

You're the best?

SISSY

When I was younger, I hitchhiked one

hundred and twenty-seven hours without

stopping, without food or sleep,

crossed the continent twice in six

days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans

and caught rides after midnight on

unlighted highways.

MAN

Whooee!

SISSY

As I developed, however, I grew more

concerned with subtleties and nuances

of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no

longer interested me. I began to

hitchhike in something akin to

geological time: slow, ancient, vast.

When I am really moving, stopping

car after car after car, moving so

freely, so clearly, so delicately

that even the sex maniacs and the

cops can only blink and let me pass,

then I embody the rhythms of the

universe. I am in a state of grace.

THE COUNTESS

I will send this out to Sissy, she

should get it in a week, and you

will be able to meet her. When I

send a letter to Sissy, duplicates

must be sent to U.S. Post Office

Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge,

Cherokee and that other place, for

her to pick up... Why she's probably

out there right now in Hibbing,

Minnesota, or Deluth, Montana...

hitching her way across the country.

SISSY

Right off, I don't remember how old

I was when I found out I was part

Indian. My mamma's family, a lot of

them, had lived out West, in the

Dakotas, and one of them had married

a squaw. Siwash tribe. My pleasure

in Indianhood and my passion for car

travel might be incongruous if not

mutually exclusive........ After

all, the first car that ever stopped

for me had been named in honor of

the great chief of the Ottawa:

Pontiac......

SISSY

NEW YORK CITY. It's still a helluva

town....

THE COUNTESS

Sit down dear, do sit down.

THE COUNTESS

Take a load off those lovely tootsies.

Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy

some sherry?

THE COUNTESS

Shit O goodness, I'm all out of

sherry; how about some Red Ripple?

THE COUNTESS

You know what Red Ripple is don't

you? It's Kool-Aid with a hard on.

Tee Hee.

THE COUNTESS

(he toasts)

To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And

welcome. So my letter brought ya

flying, eh? Where were you? Salt

Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may

have a little surprise for you. But

first, tell me about yourself. It's

been six months, hasn't it? In some

circles that's half a year. How are

you?

SISSY

Tired...

THE COUNTESS

That's the very first time in the

eons that I've known you that I've

ever heard you complain. And now

you're tired, poor darling.

SISSY

A born freak can only go uphill.

THE COUNTESS

Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks

in one way or another. Try being

born a male Russian countess into a

white middle class Baptist family in

Mississippi and you'll see what I

mean.

SISSY

I've always been proud of the way

nature singled me out. It's the people

who have been deformed by society I

feel sorry for. I've been steady

moving for eleven years and some

months. Maybe I should rest up for a

spell, I'm not as young as I used to

be.

THE COUNTESS

Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty

for another year, and you're more

beautiful than ever.

SISSY

Does that mean you might have an

assignment for me?

THE COUNTESS

You were the Yoni Yum girl from,

let's see,

(peruses the ad layouts

on the wall)

from nineteen sixty-eight through

nineteen seventy. You've always

smelled so nice. Like a little sister.

The irony has just killed me. You,

the Dew Girl, one of the few girls

who doesn't need Dew. I loath the

stink of females! They are so sweet

the way God made them, then they

start fooling around with men and

soon they're stinking. Like rotten

mushrooms, like an excessively

chlorinated swimming pool, like a

tuna fish's retirement party. They

all stink. From the Queen of England

to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.

SISSY

Bonanza Jellybean?

THE COUNTESS

What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.

THE COUNTESS

She's a young thing who works on my

ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or

something wooden like that. She's

cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of

course, it takes verve to change

one's name so charmingly. But she

stinks like a slut just the same.

SISSY

Your ranch?

THE COUNTESS

Oh my dear yes, I bought a little

ranch out West, sort of a tribute to

the women of America who have

cooperated with me in eliminating

their odor by using my vaginal

products, Dew spray mist and Yoni

Yum spray powder. A tax write-off,

actually.

THE COUNTESS

Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you

can desist from wearing paths in

those forgotten highways. The Countess

has arranged a job for you. And what

a job...

SISSY

A job for me?

THE COUNTESS

I am once more about to make

advertising history. And only you,

the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could

possibly assist me.

SISSY

The Food and Drug Administration

said Wednesday female deodorant sprays

may cause such harmful reactions as

blisters, burns and rashes. Although

the FDA judges that the reported

reactions are not sufficient to

justify removal of these products

from the market, they are sufficient

to warrant the proposed mandatory

label warnings.

THE COUNTESS

Shit O dear, that's enough to make

me asthmatic. The nerve of those

twits. What do they know about female

odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my

concept. My ranch out West? It's a

beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few

head of cattle for atmosphere and

tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch,

a place where unhappy women --

divorcees and widows, mainly -- can

go to lose weight, remove wrinkles,

change their hair styles and pretty

themselves up for the next

disappointment. My ranch is named

the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber

Rose douche bag, my own invention,

and bless its little red bladder,

the most popular douche bag in the

world. So get this. It's on the

migratory flight path of the whooping

cranes. The last flock of wild

whooping cranes left in existence.

Well, these cranes stop off at my

little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's

called -- twice a year, autumn and

spring, and spend a few days each

time, resting up, eating, doing

whatever whooping cranes do. I've

never seen them, understand, but I

hear they're magnificent. Very big

specimens -- I mean, huge mothers --

and white as snow, to coin a phrase,

except for black tips on their wings

and tail feathers, and bright red

heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case

you didn't know it, are noted for

their mating dance. It's just the

wildest show in nature.

It's probably the reason why

birdwatching used to be so popular

with old maids and deacons. Picture

these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds

in full dance -- leaping six feet

off the mud, arching their backs,

flapping their wings, strutting low

to the ground. Dears, it's

overwhelming. And picture the birds

doing their sex dance on TV. Right

there on the home screen, creation's

most elaborate sex ritual -- yet

clean and pure enough to suit the

Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in

the foreground. In a white gown, red

hood attached, and big feathery

sleeves trimmed in black. In a very

subdued imitation of the female

whooping crane, she dance/walks over

to a large nest in which there sits

a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew.

Off-camera, a string quartet is

playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is

reading a few poetic lines about

courtship and love. Are you starting

to get it? Doesn't it make the hair

on your neck stand up and applaud?

My very goodness gracious! Grandiose,

lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout-

oriented; you can't top it. I've

hired a crew of experts from Walt

Disney Studios, the best wildlife

cinematographers around. You're my

eternal favorite. Princess Grace

herself couldn't be better, not even

if she had your personality which

she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out

of photography now and into water

colors. Ah how circuitous conversation

is! We're back at the beginning. The

exact man I've wanted you to meet is

my artist the watercolorist.

SISSY

If you don't want me to pose for

him, why do you want me to meet him?

THE COUNTESS

Purely personal. I believe you might

enjoy one another.

SISSY

But Countess...

THE COUNTESS

Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I

realize that you've always avoided

all but the most rudimentary

involvements with men, and I might

add, you've been wise. Heterosexual

relationships seem to lead only to

marriage. For men, marriage is a

matter of efficient logistics: The

male gets his food, bed, laundry,

TV, pussy, offspring and creature

comforts all under one roof, where

he doesn't have to dissipate his

psychic energy thinking about them

too much, then he is free to go out

and fight the battles of life, which

is what existence is all about. But

for a woman marriage is surrender.

THE COUNTESS

But here you are, still a virgin --

you are virginal yet, aren't you?

SISSY

Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac

and I came awfully close, but he was

afraid of me, I think...

THE COUNTESS

Yes, well, what I'm getting at is

that there comes a time when it is

psychologically impossible for a

woman to lose her virginity. She

can't wait too long, you know. Now,

there's no reason why you must lose

yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit,

that's all.

SISSY

(her brow spaghettied)

What makes you think this

watercolorist and I would develop a

romantic relationship?

THE COUNTESS

I can't be certain that you would.

But what have you got to lose?

SISSY

Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see

the point in it, but I'll try it.

Just for you. It's kind of silly,

actually, me going out with an artist

in New York City. However...

THE COUNTESS

Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it,

you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

THE COUNTESS

By the way, Sissy... he's a full

blooded Indian.

COWGIRL INTERLUDE

JELLY

Well, I'm not scared of a little

rain.

DELORES

Me neither.

JELLY

Might as well brave it.

DELORES

Right. I don't know about you but

I'm sure not sweet enough to melt.

JELLY

(musing)

Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw

ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach

her how to hypnotize a chicken.

Chickens are the easiest critters on

Earth to hypnotize. If you can look

a chicken in the eyes for tens

seconds, it's yours forever.

MARY

I want to complain that some of the

cowgirls have been sleeping two to a

bunk again, in violation of the

agreement that "crimes against nature"

are to be confined to the hayloft.

DEBBIE

I don't care who lay with whom or

where or how, but the moaners,

groaners and screamers ought to turn

down their volume when others are

trying to sleep or meditate.

BIG RED

I want to complain about the food

around here! It's rotten to the core.

DELORES

My sacred crocodile! She's flipped.

ELAINE

I move that the meeting be adjourned.

DEBBIE

At the end of the endless game, there

is friendship.

HEATHER

What the heck did she mean by that!

JELLY

Just that in Heaven all business is

conducted this way.

RUPERT

We'd better take you home.

JULIAN

I beg your pardon. I've been

enthralled with your photographs for

years. When the Countess hinted that

you might like to meet me -- he never

explained why -- I was ready to paint

for him free of charge. And now I

had to go and spoil it.

MARIE

This is dreadful.

(lowering her voice

confidentially)

You know, asthma attacks are brought

on by emotional stress. Poor Julian

is so high strung. The excitement of

meeting you -- my dear, you look so

stunning! -- must have upset his

chemical balance.

RUPERT

Come on, Sissy, don't be afraid of

us.

SISSY

I've never ridden in a cab. The whole

idea of paying for a ride makes my

thumbs hurt.

CARLA

It'll be all right, dear. It isn't

as serious as it sounds.

RUPERT

There, that ought to beat them

bronchial buggers into submission.

RUPERT

I was a medic in the Army. I really

should have become a doctor.

Sometimes, though, I feel that pushing

books is a whole lot like pushing

medicine. Think of books as pills. I

have pills that cure ignorance and

pills that cure boredom. I have pills

to elevate moods and pills to open

people's eyes to the awful truth...

CARLA

Too bad you don't have a pill for

bullshit.

HOWARD

(changing the subject)

Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?

SISSY

I'm staying with the Countess.

HOWARD

I know, but where do you reside when

you aren't visiting New York?

SISSY

I don't.

HOWARD

You don't?

SISSY

Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in

particular. I just keep moving.

HOWARD

A traveler, eh?

SISSY

You might say that, although I don't

think of it as traveling.

CARLA

How do you think of it?

SISSY

As moving.

CARLA

Oh.

MARIE

How... unusual...

HOWARD

Mmmmm...

CARLA

Rupert, before you get too engrossed

in your research on Scotch as a cure

for aging, don't you think you'd

better phone Elaine's and cancel our

dinner reservations?

RUPERT (O.S.)

What would we do without you, Carla?

Without our little efficiency expert,

Carla, everything would just go to

hell. Carla is thinking about running

for mayor next year, aren't you,

Carla?

CARLA (O.S.)

Up yours, Herr Doktor Book Salesman.

Will the demands of your medical

practice allow you to call Elaine's

or shall I?

MARIE (O.S.)

Oh let me do it.

SISSY

No Indian blankets... no Indian

blankets...

SISSY

Where are the others?

HOWARD

Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little

hassle and went home.

MARIE

Julian fell asleep on the couch; we

covered him up.

HOWARD

We thought that we should make you

comfortable too.

SISSY

Yes, thanks...

MARIE

Mine are fuller but yours are more

perfectly shaped.

HOWARD

Highly debatable. I'll wager they're

the exact same size.

HOWARD

Hmm. Yours are larger, Marie, but

Miss Hankshaw's -- Sissy's -- are

more firm. You'd think they would

have started to droop; I mean, from

not wearing a bra.

MARIE

Howard! Watch your manners. You've

made her blush. Here, Sissy, let me

compare.

SISSY

(in ecstasy)

This place is finer than the place I

live!

SISSY

So this is what it's like... so this

is what it's really like.

JULIAN

Oh, Sissy. I am sorry about all the

fuss.

JULIAN

(with downcast eyes)

I apologize.

JULIAN

It is the measure of Western

Civilization that it can encompass

in harmony, balance off, as it were,

such divergent masterworks as A

MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and THE

AMERICAN DREAM, as the dome of the

Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of

the Paris opera.

JULIAN

What's the matter?

SISSY

I'm cold.

JULIAN

Here. I'll turn down the air

conditioner.

SISSY

It's not the air conditioner that's

making me cold. Nothing moves in

here. Not even your birds.

JULIAN

What are you doing?

SISSY

Getting dressed. I've got to go.

JULIAN

But I don't want you to leave. Please

stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you

a dinner. And tonight... we can...

really make love.

SISSY

I have to go, Julian.

JULIAN

Why? Why do you have to go?

SISSY

(somewhat frantic)

My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake.

I've been negligent. I haven't

exercised. I have to hitchhike a

little bit every day, no matter what.

It's like a musician practicing his

scales. When I don't practice, my

timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff

and sore.

SISSY

I will hitch with you, out where

tall birds wade in a lake named for

my Siwash kin. Out where Smokey the

Bear lay down his shovel to romp

with more playful beasts. Out where

starlight has no enemies and the

badland wind no friends. Out where

the boogie stops and the woogie

begins.

THE COUNTESS

So she left town. Well, that shouldn't

surprise you. Leaving town is what

Sissy is all about. But tell me, how

did she strike you?

JULIAN

Extraordinary!

THE COUNTESS

She's obviously that. Jesus! Which

would you rather have, a million

dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs

full of pennies?

JULIAN

Oh, you! I'm not talking about her

hands. They're difficult to ignore,

I confess, but I'm speaking of her

whole being. Her whole being is

extraordinary. The way she talks,

for example. She's so articulate.

THE COUNTESS

It's high time you realized, honey

babe, that a woman doesn't have to

give the best years of her life to

Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak

the English language.

JULIAN

Countess. I'm really in a dither.

She's turned my head.

THE COUNTESS

Ninety degrees to the left, I hope.

How does she feel about you?

JULIAN

I think she's disappointed that I'm

not more, ah, sort of atavistic.

She's got some naive, sentimental

notions about Indians. I'm sure she

liked me, though; but.... then she

left town.

THE COUNTESS

She always leaves town, you dummy.

That doesn't mean anything. What

about in bed? How does she like it

in bed?

JULIAN

How does she like what in bed?

THE COUNTESS

Like what?

THE COUNTESS

What do you think?

JULIAN

Well.... er...

THE COUNTESS

Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to

tell me you didn't get it on?

JULIAN

Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

THE COUNTESS

Whose fault was that?

JULIAN

I suppose it was mine. Yes, it

definitely was my fault.

THE COUNTESS

What do they do to you boys in those

Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap

you down and pump the Nature out of

you? They can even press the last

drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck.

Why, send a shaman or cannibal to

Yale for four years and all he'd be

fit for would be a desk in the

military-industrial complex and a

seat in the third row at a Neil Simon

comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If

Harvard or Princeton could get hold

of the Chink for a couple of semesters

they'd turn him into a candidate for

the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps.

Oogie boogie.

JULIAN

If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy

enough to suit you hillbillies, at

least we don't go around indulging

in racist terms such as 'Chink.'

Next thing I know, you'll be calling

me 'chief.'

THE COUNTESS

Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's

sake.

JULIAN

What guy?

THE COUNTESS

Aw, he's some old fart holyman who

lives in the hills out West. Gives

my ranch the creeps and the willies,

too. But though he be old and dirty,

he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to

his toes. They don't have his juice

in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose

that I'll have to write Sissy out on

the road.

WOMAN

Are you a pilgrim?

SISSY

No, I'm more of an Indian The trio

doesn't smile.

DRIVER

She means are you going to see the

Chink?

SISSY

Oh, I may and I may not. But seeing

him is not my main objective out

here.

DRIVER

That's good. Because he won't see

you. We came all the way from

Minneapolis to see him and the crazy

bastard tried to stone us to death

OTHER MAN

Yeah, but I no longer believe that

guy's a master. He's just a dirty,

uptight old mountain man. Why, he

pulled out his pecker and shook it

at Barbara. I'd stay away from there

if I were you, lady.

MISS ADRIAN

By any chance are you Sissy Hankshaw?

SISSY

Yes I am.

MISS ADRIAN

My goodness. Why didn't you telephone?

Someone would have driven into

Mottburg to pick you up. I'm Miss

Adrian. From the ranch. The Countess

wrote that I should expect you. Get

in, won't you? You must be exhausted.

Gloria, assist Miss Hankshaw with

her luggage.

MISS ADRIAN

Little twit.

(turns to Sissy)

You really ought to have phoned. We

were just in Mottburg escorting some

guests to the afternoon train.

(sighs)

More guests leaving ahead of schedule.

Three checked out today. They decided

to transfer to Elizabeth Arden's

Maine Chance spa in Phoenix, Arizona.

It costs two hundred and fifty dollars

a week less at the Rubber Rose, so

why are our guests leaving and going

to Elizabeth Arden's?

MISS ADRIAN

I'll tell you why, it's that plague

of cowgirls. They've gradually

infiltrated every sector of our

program. The one named Debbie

considers herself an expert on

exercising and diet. With Bonanza

Jellybean's permission and against

my explicit orders, she's been

coercing the guests into trying

something called kundalini yoga. Do

you know what that is? It's trying

to mentally force a serpent of fire

to crawl up your spinal column. Miss

Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend

kundalini yoga, let alone do it.

Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook

by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third

Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul

Food. God knows what that will be

like. The little barbarians are

destroying everything that I've built,

mocking all that the company stands

for. And there's a new one, one they

call del Ruby. She has the good will

of a scorpion. I've considered it

prudent to avoid a confrontation

that might further upset the guests.

But now that the season is practically

over -- we operate April through

September -- and the Countess is

finally coming...

MISS ADRIAN'S VOICE

Our Ranch has all the latest in modern

facilities...

MISS ADRIAN'S VOICE

We have a facial wing, and next to

that is the Hair Barn...

MISS ADRIAN

We have a team of fifteen hair experts

from all over the world.

MISS ADRIAN

And fanny flab flies off in this

room at the rate of six hundred and

seventy-five pounds a day... that's

a lot of salted ham, Sissy....

MISS ADRIAN

Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw

is with us.

COWGIRL

Cool! We're going to make a movie!...

BIG RED

Get rid of the furniture.... it's

too masculine... Get rid of all the

furniture and use it for kindling!!!

Break away from these pig-like

chauvinist masculine influences....

MISS ADRIAN

O merciful Jesus! They're murdering

the guests!

MISS ADRIAN

Where are the guests?

MAN

Take it easy, lady. They went on a

short ride with the cowgirls. Rode

over the hill yonder. You're Miss

Adrian, aren't you? We need to talk

to you about the filming.

MISS ADRIAN

Not now, you fool, not now. Those

crazed bitches have led innocent

women out and are slaughtering them

at this moment. We'll all be killed.

Oh! Ohhh!

CAMERAMAN

There's a slaughter going on all

right, but it's not the fat ladies

that are getting it. Your hired hands

are killing the cattle.

MISS ADRIAN

The cattle? They're killing the cows?

All of them?

CAMERAMAN

(interrupted while

putting a zoom lens

on his camera)

That's what they said, Miss Adrian.

MISS ADRIAN

How dare you slaughter the Countess's

cattle! What is a ranch without cows?

COWGIRL

We're going to replace them with

goats. Most of the cattle are diseased

and in pain. We're just putting them

out of their misery. According to

Bon-an-za Jellybean, the Rubber Rose

is in-di-cat-ive of the Countess's

values. He has purchased a cheap

weak strain of cow to begin with and

with improper care....

MISS ADRIAN

Oh heavens! I don't want to hear

what Bonanza Jellybean has been

telling you girls.... Come on Sissy.

I'll show you to your quarters.

MAID

Excuse me, Miss. Do you care for

your breakfast now?

SISSY

Yeah. I feel a bit hungry.

SISSY

Road food. How did you know?

MAID

Well it is a change of our usual

grapefruit and melba toast, I'm sure.

Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean

SISSY

Bonanza Jellybean....

MAID

She will be up to see you directly.

JELLY

Welcome, podner. By God, it's great

to have you here. It's an honor.

Sorry I took so long getting to you,

but we've had a mess of hard work

these past few days -- and a heap of

planning to do.

SISSY

Er, you seem to know who I am, and

maybe even what I am. Thanks for the

breakfast.

JELLY

Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all

right. I've done a little hitchhiking

myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling

Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter

because you once knocked a tomato

can off a stump with a fieldstone.

I'd heard tales about you from people

I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops.

I heard about your, uh, your, ah,

your wonderful thumbs, and I heard

how you were Jack Kerouac's girl

friend...

SISSY

No, I'm afraid that part isn't true.

Jack was in awe of me and tracked me

down. We spent a night talking and

hugging in a corn field, but he was

hardly my lover. Besides, I always

travel alone.

JELLY

Well, that doesn't matter; that part

never interested me anyway. The

beatnicks were before my time, and I

never got anything outta the hippies

but bad dope, cliches and the clap.

But the example of your life helped

me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.

SISSY

Tell me about it.

JELLY

About...

SISSY

About being a cowgirl. What's it all

about? When you say the word you

make it sound like it was painted in

radium on the side of a pearl.

JELLY

Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly

common image. The idea of cowgirls

especially for little girls prevails

in our culture. Therefore, it seems

to me, the existence of cowgirls

should prevail. Otherwise, they're

being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of

Fame in Oklahoma City there are just

two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em

are trick-riders. Trick-riding is

what cowgirls have almost always

done in rodeos. Our society sure

likes to see its unconventional women

do tricks. That's what prostitutes

call it, you know: 'tricking.'

SISSY

You're political, then?

JELLY

No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on

the Rubber Rose who are political,

but I don't share their views. I got

no cowgirl ideology to expound.

"Politics is for people who have a

passion for changing life but lack a

passion for living it."

JELLY

Did that last comment sound too

profound to be coming outta my mouth?

It's not original. It's something I

picked up from the Chink.

SISSY

Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered

that you sometimes speak with him.

What else have you learned from the

Chink?

JELLY

Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha

ha. That's hard to say. We mostly....

Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

JELLY

Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the

Chink taught me something about

cowgirls. Did you realize that

cowgirls have been around for many

centuries? Long before America. In

ancient India the care of the cattle

was always left up to young women

they called gopis. Being alone with

the cows all the time, the gopis got

awfully horny, just like we do here.

Every gopi was in love with Krishna,

a good-looking young god who played

the flute like it was going out of

style When the moon was full, this

Krishna would play his flute by a

river and call the gopis to him.

Then he would multiply himself sixteen

thousand times -- one for each gopi --

and make love to each one the way

she most desired. There they were,

sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna

on the river bank, and the energy of

their merging was so great that it

created a huge oneness, a total union

of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite

a picture, huh?

JELLY

That couldn't be Krishna, could it?

A bit shrill for a flute. Just our

rotten luck.

JELLY

Gotta run now. Delores says I'm

needed. Somebody's here. Maybe it's

the Countess.

JELLY

Sissy, cowgirl history is about to

be made. I'm damn glad you're here

to witness it.

KYM

It's cute. Way cuter than a cow.

DEBBIE

Goats are always testing you. They're

like Zen masters. They can tell

instantly if you're faking your

feelings. So they play games with

you to keep you true. People should

go to goats instead of psychiatrists.

GLORIA

It's so loving.

HEATHER

Look at those playfully wise eyes.

GLORIA

Ooo! It licked me!

JELLY

More and more people are discovering

that cow's milk isn't fit for human

consumption. Billy West says if we

can produce enough goat's milk on

the ranch to make it worth his while,

he'll run it into Fargo regularly.

DELORES

I'm aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs

until her ninth month, but I don't

think pregnant cowgirls are going to

be any asset on this ranch. I hope

you itchy clits who are sneaking

down to the lake every night are

taking precautions. It's bad enough

we've got cranes coming; we don't

need storks. I feel that those film

makers should be removed from the

Rubber Rose as soon as possible. Men

can cause nothing but trouble here.

I also feel that our guest

(she nods at Sissy)

should be excused while we discuss

this matter further.

JELLY

......Delores zonks out on peyote at

least once a week, but so far her

Third Vision hasn't happened.

Niwetukame, the Mother Goddess has

not gotten back in touch with her.

Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling

each other like a couple of crosstown

high schools. Tension. Cowgirl

tension! What a drag.

SISSY

What is Debbie's position?

JELLY

Debbie says that if women are to

take charge again, they must do it

in the feminine way; they mustn't

resort to aggressive and violent

masculine methods. She says it is up

to women to show themselves better

than men, to love men, set good

examples for them and guide them

tenderly toward the New Age. She's a

real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

SISSY

You don't agree with Debbie, then?

JELLY

I wouldn't say that. I expect she's

right, ultimately. But I'm with

Delores when it comes to fighting

for what's mine. I can't understand

why Delores is so uptight about the

Chink; he could probably teach her a

thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles,

doesn't it? God knows I love women,

but nothing can take the place of a

man that fits. Still this is cowgirl

territory and I'll stand with Delores

and fight any bastards who might

deny it. I guess I've always been a

scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve

years old and I was felled by a silver

bullet.

DELORES

He's here.

DELORES

Look at him. Perverse as a pink

pickle.

BIG RED

Sick as a vice squad.

DELORES

He's in a snit. He wants to see you

right after the barbecue.

JELLY

Get the girls. He's gonna see me

right now.

JELLY

Any of you ladies who would like to

join us, you're welcome to stay on

as a full working podner at the Rubber

Rose. Rest of you get packed -- and

I mean now. You've got fifteen minutes

to move your lard asses off this

ranch.

MISS ADRIAN

You will all be rounded up and sent

to prison if you take this any

farther! This is not your ranch!!!!

THE COUNTESS

You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do

you actually suppose this exhibition

of childlike melodrama is advancing

the cause of freedom?

JELLY

You owe us this here ranch, as a

token payment for your disgusting

exploitations

THE COUNTESS

(tranquilly)

Then take it.

JELLY

Go for it, girls!

MISS ADRIAN

(shaking her fist)

Go to your bunkhouse and remain there!

GLORIA

Better reach for your spray cans!

JELLY

Not one of these pussies has been

washed in a week!

CHINK

Ha ha ho ho hee hee.

CHINK

Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

SISSY

Wait!

SISSY

Well, aren't you going to shake your

whanger at me?

CHINK

(laughter dies a

nervous chipmunk

death)

Follow me. I'll fix you supper.

SISSY

I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.

CHINK

I know who you are.

SISSY

Oh? Well, there's been some trouble

on the ranch. I came up here to get

out of the way. It's so dark now I

doubt if I could find my way back

down. If you could help...

CHINK

(voice that wears no

pants)

Save your breath for the climb.

CHINK

Yip! Yip! Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

CHINK

Personally, I prefer Stevie Wonder,

but what the hell. Those cowgirls

are always bitching because the only

radio station in the area plays

nothing but polkas, but I say you

can dance to anything if you really

feel like dancing.

SISSY

But I don't know how to polka.

CHINK

Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.

SISSY

(thinking)

So this is how Jelly spends her visits

to the Chink.

SISSY

What was that?

CHINK

Clockworks.

SISSY

Clockworks?

CHINK

The Clockworks is one reason that I

am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted

the invitation to be initiated as a

shaman by an aged Siwash chief who

was the principle outside confederate

of the Clock People.

SISSY

Siwash, huh?

CHINK

He was a degenerated warlock who

could turn urine into beer, and the

honor that he extended me gave me

rights of occupancy in this sacred

cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge.

I came to the Dakota hills to

construct a clockworks of my own.

CHINK

But unlike the clockworks of the

Clock People, my ticks more accurately

echo the ticks of the universe....

(he listens)

......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

SISSY

The Clock People?

CHINK

During the Second World War I busted

out of Tule Lake detention camp; as

a Japanese-American, I had been put

there and watched over. I found refuge

with the Clock People, who discovered

me in a snow bank, near dead, I had

been climbing across the Sierra Nevada

mountains.

SISSY

Then if you are Japanese, then why

are you called the Chink?

CHINK

The Clock People mistook me for

Chinese. And the name stuck. In the

same way that all Indian tribes came

to be labeled "Indians" through the

ignorance of an Italian sailor with

a taste for oranges, it is only

fitting that "Indians" misnamed me.

The Clock People, however, are not a

tribe, rather they are a gathering

of Indians from various tribes. They

have lived together since 1906.

CHINK

The pivotal function of the Clock

People is the keeping and observing

of the clockworks. It is a real thing,

and is kept at the center, at the

soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar

as it is possible, all Clock People

deaths and births occur in the

presence of the clockworks. Aside

from birthing or dying, the reason

for the daily visits to the clockworks

is to check the time.

CHINK

These people have no other ritual

than this one. Likewise, they have

but one legend or cultural myth:

that of a continuum they call the

Eternity of Joy. It is into the

Eternity of Joy that they believe

all men will pass once the clockworks

is destroyed. The destruction must

come from the outside, must come by

natural means, must come at the will

of this gesticulating planet whose

more acute stirrings thoughtless

people call "earthquakes."

CHINK

The Earth is alive. She burns inside

with the heat of cosmic longing. She

longs to be with her husband again.

She moans. She turns softly in her

sleep. In the Eternity of Joy,

pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease

with his gentle technologies, will

smile and sigh when the Earth begins

to shake. I loved those loony

redskins, but I couldn't be a party

to their utopian dreaming. After a

while it occurred to me that the

Clock People waiting for the Eternity

of Joy was virtually identical to

the Christians waiting for the Second

Coming. Or the Communists waiting

for the worldwide revolution. Or the

Debbies waiting for the flying

saucers. All the same. Just more

suckers betting their share of the

present on the future, banking every

misery on a happy ending to history.

Well, history is ending every second -

happily for some of us, unhappily

for others, happily one second,

unhappily the next. History is always

ending and always not ending... ha

ha ho ho and hee hee.

SISSY

What do you believe in then?

CHINK

Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

SISSY

If this be adultery, make the most

of it.

I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED.

I BELIEVE IN NOTHING; EVERYTHING IS SACRED.

THE COUNTESS

Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're

a good model but a shitty actress.

The cowgirls are involved in this

whooping crane disappearance. You

know perfectly well they are. Last

seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to

Canada. Siwash Lake is between

Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls

have possession of Siwash Lake. And

who else but Jellybean's wild cunts

could possibly conceive of doing

something so diabolical as to tamper

with the last flock of some nearly

extinct birds? How much do you know

about it? Have they murdered those

cranes the way they murdered my moo

cows?

SISSY

I don't know anything about it.

THE COUNTESS

Sissy. You're trying to protect those

scuzzy bitches. Well, let your

conscience be your guide, as my mommy

used to say, but it won't work. Those

stinking sluts are going to suffer...

THE COUNTESS

(gasping)

Shit O dear.

SURGEON

Well, he's not out of danger, but I

think we can safely say he's going

to make it. I'd be pretty surprised

if he didn't. However, there is

evidence of injury to the frontal

lobe, and I have reason to fear that

this injury may be permanent. The

patient may never again function as

a normal human being.

SISSY

Brain damage? You mean he's going to

be a vegetable?

SURGEON

Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn't say

that, no. We won't ascertain the

extent of the injury for some days.

But there is a genuine possibility

of severe and lasting behavioral

defects. I wouldn't classify it in

the vegetable category, however.

DRIVER

I'm going to give it to you like

you've never had it before. Oh, you

didn't know it could be this good.

You're gonna like it. You're gonna

like it. You're gonna like it so

good. You're gonna love it so much

you're gonna cry. You're gonna cry.

You're gonna cry and cry. Do you

like to cry? Do you like it when it

hurts a little bit? Whatever happens

to you, it'll be worth it. The way

I'm gonna give it to you, it'll be

worth anything. Everything. Go ahead

and cry if you want to. I like it

when women cry. It means they

appreciate me.

TRENTON N.J.

BALTIMORE MD

WASHINGTON D.C.

RICHMOND, VA

DR. DREYFUS

I'm afraid I can't help you.

SISSY

But Doctor.

DREYFUS

Please, child, don't be dismayed. We

all have problems these days. But as

the painter Van Gogh said, 'Mysteries

remain, sorrow or melancholy remains,

but the everlasting negative is

balanced by the positive work which

thus is achieved, after all.' I don't

suppose that means very much to you.

I have retired. A victim of a

malpractice suit.

SISSY

(embracing him)

Oh, Doctor! You've got to do it. You

and nobody else should be allowed to

take away my gift.

DR. DREYFUS

Ah, the thumb.

DR. DREYFUS

The thumb the thumb the thumb the

thumb the thumb the thumb. One of

evolution's most ingenious inventions;

a built-in tool sensitive to texture,

contour and temperature: an alchemical

lever; the secret key to technology;

the link between the mind and art; a

humanizing device. The marmoset and

the lemur are thumbless; none of the

New World monkeys has opposable

thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs

are absent or reduced to a tiny

tubercle; the thumbs of the potto

are set at an angle of one hundred

eighty degrees to the other digits.

DR. DREYFUS

And so you are demanding at last the

privileges of thumb that nature has

perversely denied you?

SISSY

I just want to be normal, give me

that old-fashioned normality. It was

good enough for Crazy Horse and it's

good enough for me.

DR. DREYFUS

Ah, yes. Very well, my dear. Here is

what we can do.

JELLY

Yep, the whooping cranes are here

all right. They're in fine shape,

and as you musta saw from your fucking

whirly machine, unrestrained, free

to go as they please. But this is

private property and you aren't laying

a foot on it. None of you.

SHERIFF

We'll be back with a court order and

a fistful of search warrants.

JELLY

Just come back with a couple of people

who know what they're doing and we'll

let'em in for a nice close look at

the birds.

DELORES

And make sure at least one of them

is female, and you better do as we

say or there may be trouble.

UNDERSECRETARY

It will be my extreme pleasure to

report to the President...

UNDERSECRETARY

...who has been gravely concerned

about the fate of our whooping

cranes....

UNDERSECRETARY

...and to the Interior Secretary and

to the American people that the entire

flock of cranes is, indeed, at...

UNDERSECRETARY VOICE

...Siwash Lake and in apparently

healthy condition.

UNDERSECRETARY VOICE

....The cranes have built brooding

nests around the whole circumference

of the small lake, and have...

UNDERSECRETARY

....hatched chicks there. Counting

the young birds, there are now

approximately sixty cranes in the

flock. While this is good news, it

is also quite bewildering...

UNDERSECRETARY (V.O.)

...Whooping cranes are territorially

minded and have never been known to

nest as close as a mile to one

another, yet here they are virtually

side by side.

NEWS REPORTER

The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a

communique that was sent to the

federal judge and copies of a

recording to the press, today.

JELLY

(over the radio)

THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS BEEN DRIVEN

TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION BY AN

AGGRESSIVE, BRUTAL PATERNALISTIC

SYSTEM INTENT ON SUBDUING THE EARTH

AND ESTABLISHING ITS DOMINION OVER

ALL THINGS -- IN THE NAME OF GOD THE

FATHER, LAW, ORDER AND ECONOMIC

PROGRESS.

SISSY

That's Jellybean!

JELLY (V.O.)

FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS

RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT.

MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES,

STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY,

POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR,

BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

JELLY

OBVIOUSLY, A PATERNALISTIC SOCIETY

DOES NOT DESERVE ANYTHING AS GRAND

AND BEAUTIFUL AND WILD AND FREE AS

THE WHOOPING CRANE. YOU MEN HAVE

FAILED IN YOUR DUTY TO THE CRANE.

NOW IT IS WOMEN'S TURN. THE CRANES

ARE IN OUR CHARGE NOW. WE WILL PROTECT

THEM AS LONG AS THEY STILL REQUIRE

PROTECTION --

JELLY'S VOICE

WHILE WORKING TOWARD A DAY WHEN THE

CREATURES OF THE WORLD NO LONGER

HAVE TO SUFFER MAN'S EGOISM,

INSENSITIVITY AND GREED. WE REFUSE

YOUR ORDER. WE SAY TAKE YOUR ORDER

AND SHOVE IT. THIS FLOCK OF BIRDS IS

STAYING WITH US. GET LOST, MAC.

KYM

Man, this is the stupidest music

I've ever heard. This radio should

have stayed in the privy where it

belongs.

SISSY

Howdy.

KYM

You know what you're getting into if

you come over to the lake...

SISSY

Yes, but I want to be there. I want

to see Jellybean. I want to see the

cranes.

KYM

We heard on the radio that the judge

has set Delores's bail at fifty

thousand dollars. Now she won't be

here when we really need her.

RADIO NEWS REPORT

The American Civil Liberties Union

has requested an extension for the

Rubber Rose Ranch. The government is

aware of the inflamed situation and

are afraid that all the marshals and

agents might be too willing to uncork

the bottle of blood...

JELLY

Let's celebrate!

AGENT

Ain't that just like women.

JELLY

Looks like every time we get together

things are in a mess.

SISSY

So be it. It looks serious this time,

though. All these guns... are you

actually prepared to kill and die

for whooping cranes?

JELLY

Hell no, the cranes are wonderful,

okay, but I'm not in this for whooping

cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If

we cowgirls give in to authority on

this crane issue, then cowgirls become

just another compromise. I want a

finer fate than that -- for me and

for every other cowgirl. Better no

cowgirls at all than cowgirls

compromised.

SISSY

How did this business get started,

anyhow? Why are the birds nesting

here?

DEBBIE

You were aware that we were feeding

them, weren't you? We fed them brown

rice and they stayed over a couple

of extra days. Then we decided to

try something different. We mixed

our brown rice with fishmeal --

whoopers love seafood, and fishmeal

is cheap. Then Delores suggested

another ingredient, and we think

that's what did the trick.

SISSY

You mean...

DEBBIE AND JELLY TOGETHER

PEYOTE!

SISSY

They're drugged.

JELLY

Aw, come off it, Sissy. What do you

mean, 'drugged'? Every living thing

is a chemical composition and anything

that is added to it changes that

composition. When you eat a

cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers

bar, it changes your body chemistry.

The kind of food you eat, the kind

of air you breathe, can change your

mental state. Does that mean you're

'drugged'?

SISSY

No, I guess not.

JELLY

'Drugged' is a stupid word.

SISSY

But the peyote is obviously affecting

their brains. It's made them break a

migratory pattern that goes back

thousands of years.

DEBBIE

The way I see it, is that the peyote

mellowed them out. Made them less

uptight. They were afraid of bad

weather and humans. That's why they

migrated and kept to themselves. But

the peyote has enlightened them.

It's taught them there is nothing to

fear but fear itself. Now they're

digging life and letting the bad

vibes slide on. Don't worry, be happy.

Be here now.

SISSY

Fear in wild animals is completely

different from paranoia in people.

In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is

natural and necessary. It's merely a

mechanism for maintaining life. If

the cranes hadn't had a capacity for

fear, they would have disappeared

long ago and you'd be having to get

loaded with common old everyday

meadowlarks and mallards.

JELLY

This here discussion is destined to

become academic. Because we've got

less than half a bag of peyote buttons

left and Delores's run ended up in

the Mottburg jail. So any day now

we'll get a chance to see how the

whoopers behave when they come down,

to see if the peyote experience really

changed them or not. But in the

meantime, I want to say this about

fear.....

ANNOUNCER

Judge Greenfield, at the request of

the ACLU, has granted a forty-eight-

hour extension of the deadline by

which the Rubber Rose cowgirls must

comply with his order. Negotiations

between the cowgirls and the

government are expected to follow.

Another item in, the forewoman of

the Rubber Rose Ranch, a Delores del

Ruby is now free on bond after having

been arrested in Mottburg with more

than fifty pounds of peyote buttons.

Her bail has been paid by the owner

of the besieged ranch, Countess

Products, Inc. Miss del Ruby's bail

having come from the tycoon's personal

advisor, a certain Dr. Robbins of

New York City.

SISSY

Dr. Robbins?

JELLY

Every time I tell you that I love

you, you flinch. But that's your

problem.

SISSY

If I flinch when you say you love

me, it's both our problems. My

confusion becomes your confusion.

Students confuse teachers, patients

confuse psychiatrists, lovers with

confused hearts confuse lovers with

clear hearts....

DELORES

It isn't for ourselves that we take

this stand. It isn't for cowgirls.

It's for all the daughters everywhere.

This is an extremely important

confrontation. This is womankind's

chance to prove to her enemy that

she's willing to fight and die. If

we women don't show here and now

that we aren't afraid to fight and

die, then our enemy will never take

us seriously. Men will always know

that, no matter how strong our words

and determined our deeds, there's a

point where we'll back down and give

them their way.

DELORES

I'm prepared to win! Victory for

every female, living or dead, who's

suffered the temporary defeats of

masculine insensitivity to their

inner lives!

DONNA

I'll fight the bastards.

BIG RED

I'll fight 'em with bean gas, if

necessary.

DELORES

The sun's going down. Let's those of

us not standing watch get some sleep.

In the morning we'll plan our fight.

Tomorrow afternoon those of you who'd

like can join me in the reeds, where

the cranes and I will be sharing the

last crumbs left in the peyote sack.

DELORES

It is woman's mission to destroy as

well as to give birth. We will destroy

the tyranny of the dull. But we can't

destroy it with guns. Or whips.

Violence is the dullard's Breakfast

of Champions and the logical end

product of his or her misplaced pride.

Violence fertilizes that which we

would starve. No, we will destroy

the enemy in other ways. The Peyote

Mother has promised a Fourth Vision.

But it won't come to me alone. It

will come to each of you, to every

cowgirl in the land, when you have

overcome that in your own self which

is dull. The Fourth Vision will come

to some men too. You will recognize

them when you meet them, and be their

steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic

escapades of poetic behavior and

romance.

DELORES

First thing, you must end this

business with the government and the

cranes. It's been positive and

fruitful, but it's gone far enough.

Playfulness ceases to serve a serious

purpose when it takes itself too

seriously. Sorry I won't be with you

at the conclusion. As you know, I've

been sick and stupid for a long time.

I have a lot to make up for, a lot

to accomplish, and there's someone

important that I've got to see. Now.

JELLY

Well, what we got to do is one of us

has got to go up that hill and tell

them boys that America can have its

whooping cranes back. Since I'm the

boss here, and since I'm responsible

for a lot of you choosing to be

cowgirls in the first place, it's

gonna be me that goes...

JELLY

No buts about it. It's getting lighter

by the second. You podners keep your

heads down. Ta ta.

COWGIRL

Jelly! Please!

JELLY

Better get rid of these. Might give

those greenhorn dudes a fright.

AGENT

She's going to fire....

VOICE

You've got two minutes to come out

with you hands over your heads!

JELLY

Right in the scar where I fell on a

wooden horse when I was twelve. Haw,

I wasn't really shot with a silver

bullet.

JELLY

Or was I?

BONANZA JELLYBEAN

1944-1973

"Ha ha ho ho and hee hee"

The brown paper bag.

A VOICE

The brown paper bag is the only thing

civilized man has produced that does

not seem out of place in nature.

Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles,

like the fossilized brain of a dryad;

its kinship to tree (to knot and

nest) unobscured by the cruel crush

of industry; absorbing the elements

like any other organic entity;

blending with rock and vegetation as

if it were a burrowing owl's door

mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a

No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded

in the hills of Dakota and appeared

to live where it lay. Once long ago,

it had borne a package of buns and a

jar of mustard to a kitchenette

rendezvous with a fried hamburger.

More recently, the bag had

held........ love letters.

VOICE

As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's

family jewels, the bag had hidden

love letters in the bottom of a

bunkhouse trunk.

VOICE

Then one day after work, the button-

nosed little cowgirl to whom the

letters were addressed gathered bag

and contents under her arm, slipped

out to the corral...

VOICE

...past ranch hands pitching

horseshoes and ranch hands flying

Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted

into the hills.

VOICE

A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she

dismounted and built a small fire;

she fed the fire letters.

VOICE

...one by one, the way her girl friend

had once fed her french fries.

VOICE

As words such as sweetheart" and

"honey britches" and "forever" and

"always" burned away, the cowgirl

squirted a few tears. Her eyes were

so misty she forgot to burn the bag.

DELORES

You know, podner, you can tune a

guitar but you can't tuna fish.

DELORES

God, but it's good to be a cowgirl.

SISSY

Is everything getting worse?

CHINK

Yes, everything is getting worse.

But everything is also getting better.

SISSY

The Countess has come to our aid.

The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially

deeded to all the cowgirls. And I

have been asked to oversee the ranch.

For $300 a week. And as it turns

out, the Countess is not going to be

the vegetable the doctors thought he

was... here's a picture!

CHINK

I want to go back to the Clock People.

I kind of miss those fool redskins

and wonder what they're up to. What's

happened to Jelly?

SISSY

She had a one way-ticket to Kansas

City.

CHINK

You mean she's dead?

SISSY

But that's an old story now...... I

can't believe that you would leave

the Butte.

CHINK

Easy come, easy go.

DELORES

Wow, you sure have a way with words.

CHINK

I can't help it if I grew up in an

antipoetic culture. Language will be

different when I'm with the Clock

People though. They're from an oral

tradition. And I'm not talking about

what you horny hop toads do in bed

every night.

SISSY

Well, if the Clock People give you

any inside information on the end of

the world, drop us a postcard.

CHINK

The world isn't going to end, you

dummy; I hope you know that much.

(he grows

uncharacteristically

serious)

But it is going to change. It's going

to change drastically, and probably

in your lifetime. The Clock People

see calamitous earthquakes as the

agent of change, and they may be

right, since there are a hundred

thousand earthquakes a year and major

ones are long overdue. But there are

far worse catastrophes coming...

unless the human race can bring itself

to abandon the goals and values of

civilization, in other words, unless

it can break the consumption habit --

and we are so conditioned to consuming

as a way of life that for most of us

life would have no meaning without

the yearnings and rewards of

progressive consumption. It isn't

merely that our bad habits will cause

global catastrophes, but that our

operative political-economic

philosophies have us in such a blind

crab grip that they prevent us from

preparing for the natural disasters

that are not our fault. So the

apocalyptic shit is going to hit the

fan, all right, but there'll be some

of us it'll miss. Little pockets of

humanity. Like the Clock People.

Like you two honeys, if you decide

to accept my offer of a lease on

Siwash Cave. There's almost no

worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear

accident, plague, weather warfare or

reduction of the ozone shield --

that you couldn't survive in that

cave.

CHINK

Suppose that you bear five or six

children with your characteristics.

All in Siwash Cave. In a

postcatastrophe world, your offspring

would of necessity intermarry, forming

in time a tribe. A tribe every member

of which had giant thumbs. A tribe

of Big Thumbs would relate to the

environment in very special ways. It

could not use weapons or produce

sophisticated tools. It would have

to rely on its wits and its senses.

It would have to live with animals --

and plants! -- as virtual equals.

It's extremely pleasant to me to

think about a tribe of physical

eccentrics living peacefully with

animals and plants, learning their

languages, perhaps, and paying them

the respect they deserve.

SISSY

How am I going to be the progenitor

of a tribe when I'm living on an

isolated ridgetop with Delores?

CHINK

That's your problem.

CHINK

Listen to the way I'm babbling. That

bullet must have loosened one of my

transistors. Don't pay any attention

to me. You've got to work it out for

yourself. The westbound choo-choo

leaves Mottburg at one-forty. I want

to be on it. Will you drive me to

the station?

CHINK

Schedules! Ironic how I have to follow

timetables in order to get back to

the clockworks.

CHINK

Don't ever bet against paradox,

ladies...

CHINK

....if complexity doesn't beat you,

then paradox will. Ha ha ho ho and

hee hee.....

THE END
