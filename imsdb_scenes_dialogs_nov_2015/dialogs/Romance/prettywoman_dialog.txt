EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down

EDWARD

(a murmur)

Left pocket.

INVESTMENT BANKER 1

Our banks certainly doesn't want

to discourage Harris Enterprises

from investing in California.

We think this is a great new venue

for you but you've got to

understand the mergers and

acquisitions market is changing.

With the upswing in inflation we

have to make these offerings

tempting to offset the risk.

VANCE

Look, we're talking about hard

assets and a straight liquidation.

We have over a thousand man hours

in this deal.

STUCKEY

(losing patience)

This is a "no brainer".  There's

no risk for you.  No one has ever

lost money backing Mr. Harris.

INVESTMENT BANKER 2

Not yet.  But ship building is

a new endeavor for you...

STUCKEY

(cuts him off)

Come on.  You know we're not

going to go into ship building.

Besides, you're the ones with the

troubled track record, not us!

INVESTMENT BANKER 3

Bill, be reasonable.  If you're

really going to digest Kross

Industries that quickly eighteen

should not be such a problem.

Besides, I don't think there's

anywhere else you can go for the

money in the time you have.

EDWARD

It's unacceptable.

EDWARD

Draymen Heux has offered me

seventy-five in the pool at

sixteen and a half.  I can secure

the other half personally.  You

have until tomorrow morning to

make me a better offer.

EDWARD

The meeting is over, gentlemen.

STUCKEY

Hah!  Did you see the look on

their faces?

VANCE

You don't think we pushed too

hard?

STUCKEY

NO way!  They'll come back.  They

can't afford not to.  Edward,

that bluff was beautiful.

EDWARD

Maybe I should have made it

rhyme.

EDWARD

(looking at his watch)

Well!  It's late.  We've been

at this long enough.

EDWARD

Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The

magician's wonderful.

EDWARD

(calling after them)

Watch your left pocket.

BUTLER

Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss

Charles.

STUCKEY

Cynthia?  Is she coming out?

EDWARD

We're about to find out.  Go on.

Take care of your guests.

EDWARD

(into phone)

Where are you, Cynthia?

(beat)

I see.

(pausing, getting angry)

No, I don't expect you to be at

my beck-and-call.  Are you coming

or not?

EDWARD

(all business)

Prepare the filing papers.  Have

them ready by the middle of the

week.  I'll tell you when to

submit them.

A MAN

Edward!

EDWARD

(turning on the charm)

Yes!

THE MAN

Will we see you at the polo

matches Wednesday?

EDWARD

Wouldn't miss it.

(abruptly; to Vance)

I want this done fast and easy.

No slip-ups.  I want to be back

in New York by Saturday.  Got it?

ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on

ELIZABETH

Bill?

STUCKEY

(flustered)

Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,

uh, uh, Millicent.

MILLICENT

Lowell.

STUCKEY

Lowell, right.  My wife,

Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH

(ignoring her)

Is Edward leaving?

STUCKEY

What's up, where you going?

EDWARD

Give me your car keys, will you,

I'm going back to my hotel.

STUCKEY

At least stay for a drink.  This

party's for you.

EDWARD

Apologize to Elizabeth for me.

STUCKEY

Listen, there're some major local

talent inside just dying to meet

you...

EDWARD

(as if delighted)

Really?  Some high class gold

digger who speaks French better

than I do?

(turning away)

No, thank you.  I just got off

the phone with one.

STUCKEY

Cynthia's not coming?

EDWARD

No.

STUCKEY

Let your driver take you.  We'll

move the cars...

STUCKEY

Can you drive a stick?

STUCKEY

Edward, give me a break!

EDWARD

Love this car!  Is it new?

STUCKEY

Yes!  And you don't even know

where you're going!

STUCKEY

That's the wrong way!

LANDLORD

Vivian.

VIVIAN

Yeah, what?

LANDLORD

Rent.  You're late.

VIVIAN

Don't give me that.  Kit gave it

to you yesterday, cash.

LANDLORD

Kit give me nothin'.

VIVIAN

(suddenly uncertain)

You bullshittin' me?

LANDLORD

Of rent I do not bullshit.

LANDLORD

By the end of the week or you're

otta here.

(a beat)

By the way, you look very nice

tonight!

PROSTITUTE

Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?

VIVIAN

Chan, you seen Kit tonight?

COOK 1

Hi, hi!  No see nothing.

VIVIAN

You do, tell her I'm looking for

her.

COOK 2

Looking good, bay-bee.

VIVIAN

Yeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit

comes in here, tell her stay.

COP

They just pulled her out of a

dumpster in the back.  Now talk

to me.

MAN

I tell you, man, I don't know who

she hang with.

COP

She have a pimp?

MAN

Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a

strawberry.  She be out on these

streets, day in, day out, tradin'

her sorry ass for crack.  And

now she dead from it.

VIVIAN

You spent it on drugs, didn't you?

KIT

Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my

roommate, Viv.

CARLOS

Lookin' good, baby.

VIVIAN

(ignoring him)

Did you blow it all, Kit?  Is it

all gone?

KIT

Carlos had some great rock.

VIVIAN

I bet.

(beat)

That was our rent!

CARLOS

Calm down, Chica.

CARLOS

Ey!  What is it you wan', baby?

I can fix you up.

VIVIAN

Beat it, scum bucket!

CARLOS

You kiss your mother with that

mouth?  Your frien' still owes

me 200.

VIVIAN

(to Kit)

Let's go.

VIVIAN

Get out of my face or I'll have

those cops on your ass in two

seconds.

CARLOS

(threatening to Vivian)

Don't take no dates tonight,

chica, you got one with me.

VIVIAN

We worked for that money.  We

were gonna put together enough

to get out of that dump we live

in, get off this street.

KIT

Viv... don't be stupid.  We're

whores.

KIT (cont'd)

So I blew our stash.  We could

make it all back with one good

night on the streets.

VIVIAN

I just saw somebody pulled out

of a dumpster.  I wonder how much

she made tonight?

KIT

Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay

you back.  I promise.

VIVIAN

I thought you were giving up that

drug shit.

KIT

I will.  I'm trying.

(a beat)

Meanwhile I got some crack left,

you wanna get high?

VIVIAN

No, let's go to work.  Okay?

KIT

Okay.

(then touches her hand)

I'm sorry I said your dream was

stupid.

KIT

No no, honey.  You see these

stars on the sidewalk.  Me and

Vivian work from Don Ameche all

the way up to Roy Rogers.

This is our office.  We got

seniority.  Get off our corner.

RACHEL

I was just taking a rest here.

Besides, she's new.

(points to Vivian)

KIT

But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty

Hall or Debra Paget where you

belong.

VIVIAN

(looks at passing cars)

Looks slow tonight.

KIT

Maybe we should get a pimp.

Carlos likes you and --

VIVIAN

Forget it.  We work for it.  We

keep it.

KIT

I can't handle this tonight.

I'm going home.

VIVIAN

(stares at her)

That crack is burning a hole in

your pocket.  There isn't even

milk in the fridge.  The rent's

due.  Now come on --

KIT (O.S.)

(suddenly)

Hey, hey -- There's a rent.

VIVIAN

He's not gonna want us.

EDWARD

(calls out to Vivian)

Excuse me.

KIT

(excited)

Don't take less than a hundred.

You look hot tonight.  And

remember, don't mouth off.  They

don't like that.

VIVIAN

Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy

on that shit.

KIT

You're the greatest.  I'll wait

up for you.

VIVIAN

Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?

EDWARD

What's that?

VIVIAN

You looking' for some company?

EDWARD

Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly

Hills?

VIVIAN

What?

(dropping the come on)

You gonna tell me you're lost?

EDWARD

Yes.

VIVIAN

Great.  What do I look like a

tourguide?

EDWARD

(a beat)

No, you look like a hooker.

VIVIAN

Actually, I'm a movie star out

for a walk.

EDWARD

Good.  Can you tell me how to

get to Beverly Hills?

VIVIAN

Sure.  For five bucks.

EDWARD

That's ridiculous.

VIVIAN

The price just went up to ten.

EDWARD

Why don't you just do it out of

the kindness of your heart?

VIVIAN

(sweetly)

Sit... and spin.

EDWARD

Sit-and-spin.

(amused)

Alright... why not?

EDWARD

(holding up a bill)

You have change for a twenty.

VIVIAN

For twenty, Ill show you

personal.  Drive.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Make a "U-ee".  Beverly Hills

is the other way.

VIVIAN

Nice car.  Yours?

EDWARD

(as he grinds the

gears; wincing)

No.

VIVIAN

Stolen?

EDWARD

Not exactly.

VIVIAN

Mind if I turn on some heat?

EDWARD

If you can figure it out, be my

guest.

EDWARD

Very good.  You're obviously

mechanical.

VIVIAN

(laughs)

You're not from L.A., huh?

EDWARD

New York.

VIVIAN

What motel you staying at?

EDWARD

Hotel.

VIVIAN

Okay, what hotel?

EDWARD

Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet

you know it.

VIVIAN

(annoyed at his tone)

Yeah, I peed in the fountain there

once.  Give me a break.

EDWARD

What's your name?

VIVIAN

What do you want it to be?

(a beat)

Vivian, my name's Vivian.

EDWARD

You like being a hooker, Vivian?

VIVIAN

It pays.

EDWARD

So do day jobs.

VIVIAN

(sarcastic)

Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.

(a beat)

Turn right.

EDWARD

Must be dangerous.  Hooking.

VIVIAN

Tell me about it.  L.A. is

suffering from a wacko epidemic.

And who knows where half the guys

I pick up have been.  I mean, I

use condoms.  Always.  And I get

checked out once a month at the

free clinic.  Not only am I better

in the sack than an amateur, I'm

probably safer.

EDWARD

Very good.  You ought to have

that printed up on your business

card.

VIVIAN

(a moment)

If you're making fun of me, I

don't like it.

EDWARD

Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean

to.

EDWARD

Ugly habit, biting your nails.

VIVIAN

You don't know habits, you think

this is ugly.

VIVIAN

Okay, pull over.  Let me out.

I've got to get back to work.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Stay on this street and you'll

hit Beverly Hills.

EDWARD

What do you charge for company,

Vivian?

VIVIAN

Company would cost you... a

hundred dollars.

EDWARD

For the whole night?

VIVIAN

For an hour.

EDWARD

You're joking.

VIVIAN

I never joke about money.

EDWARD

Neither do I.

(a moment; amused)

A hundred bucks an hour though.

That's pretty stiff.

VIVIAN

No, but it's getting there.

EDWARD

Vivian, how much to put up with

me for the entire night?

VIVIAN

You couldn't afford it.

EDWARD

Try me.

VIVIAN

Three hundred.

EDWARD

Fine.

VIVIAN

What's your name, lover.

EDWARD

Edward.  My name is Edward.

VIVIAN

Edward... you got it!

EDWARD

Get in.  This side.

VIVIAN

What?

EDWARD

You know how to drive a stick?

VIVIAN

Better believe it.

EDWARD

Then let's go.  It's worth 300

just so I don't have to drive.

VIVIAN

Here we go Edward.

EDWARD

My raincoat's in the back.  Put

it on.

VIVIAN

Why?

EDWARD

You may feel more comfortable.

This is not the kind of place that

rents rooms by the hour.

VIVIAN

You mean they don't have hookers.

EDWARD

Every place has hookers, but if

this hotel has hookers, they don't

look like they're...

VIVIAN

Off the boulevard.

EDWARD

Exactly.

VIVIAN

Great.  Now I took like a hooker

in a trenchcoat.

VIVIAN

So let's go.

OPERATOR

Evening, sir.

EDWARD

Good evening.  Penthouse.

VIVIAN

Penthouse.  My, my.

VIVIAN

The penthouse.  And step on it.

EDWARD

(into the phone)

Room service.

(to Vivian)

What do you drink?

VIVIAN

Diet coke.

EDWARD

(into the phone)

Send up a bottle of Crystal

champagne.

VIVIAN

Can I have some chips?

EDWARD

(into the phone)

-- and a bowl of strawberries.

Thank you.

EDWARD

(to Vivian)

Impressed?

VIVIAN

You kidding?  I come here all the

time.  As a matter of fact they

do rent this room by the hour.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Well, now that you have me for

the night, what are you going to

do with me?

EDWARD

Want to know something?  I don't

quite know.  I hadn't planned

this.

VIVIAN

Do you plan everything?

EDWARD

(a small smile)

Always.

VIVIAN

Well, the meter's running, it's

your money.  Speaking of which,

cash'll do.  In advance.

EDWARD

Fair enough.

EDWARD

Let's talk some more first.

VIVIAN

Right.

(brightly)

So!  In town on business?

EDWARD

(taking off his jacket)

Uh-huh.

VIVIAN

Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.

EDWARD

(loosening his tie)

And why do you say that?

VIVIAN

(a small smile)

I dunno... you have that sharp,

useless look.

EDWARD

Sounds like you've known a lot

of lawyers.

VIVIAN

I've known a lot of everybody.

EDWARD

Champagne.

VIVIAN

Hey.  I might as well make myself

useful.

WAITER

Where would you like it?

VIVIAN

Where would we like it?

EDWARD

Where would we like it?  Here'll

be fine.

VIVIAN

What are you looking at?

EDWARD

I think he wanted you to tip him.

VIVIAN

Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think

he had change for a hundred.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

You have a wife?  Girlfriend?

EDWARD

I have both.

VIVIAN

Where are they?  Shopping

together?

EDWARD

They should be.  They're both good

at it.

EDWARD (cont'd)

My ex-wife lives in London in what

used to be my home.

My girlfriend is in New York

moving out of my apartment even

as we speak.  Cheers.

EDWARD

It's a very good year.

VIVIAN

Oooh, thank god.

EDWARD

Try a strawberry.

VIVIAN

Why?

EDWARD

Because they bring out the flavor

of the champagne.

VIVIAN

Jesus, you act like you're

seducing some Valley girl you

picked up in a dance club.

EDWARD

Vivian... the meter's running...

cooperate.

EDWARD

(softly)

You really are a very beautiful

girl.

VIVIAN

(husky-voiced)

Just a romantic, that's you.

EDWARD

Yes...

VIVIAN

Me too.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Not on the lips.

EDWARD

(touching her breasts)

What do you like?

VIVIAN

If I want you to turn me on I'll

pay you three hundred.  Just lay

back and let me drive.

EDWARD (O.S.)

It's open.

EDWARD

(into the phone)

Sorry.  Go ahead.

STUCKEY

Kross knows we're after his

company.  He wants to talk with

you.  I don't think you should.

EDWARD

I want to.

STUCKEY

Edward, if the three of us sit

down together we might as well

announce our plans in the Wall

Street Journal.

EDWARD

I'll see him alone.  Everyone

knows you're my muscle.  We'll

make it social.  Tell Kross I'll

meet him for dinner.  Tonight if

you can arrange it.

STUCKEY

You shouldn't go alone.  He might

claim that you tried to black mail

him.

EDWARD

Bill, we're businessmen, not the

damn mafia.  I'll see you in the

office.  By the way, about your

car...

STUCKEY

Oh, god, what?

EDWARD

(smiling)

I'll bring it back.

EDWARD

Good morning.

VIVIAN

You didn't wake me.  I'll be out

of here in a minute.

EDWARD

No hurry.  Would you like some

breakfast?

VIVIAN

Only if you do.

EDWARD

Did you sleep well?

VIVIAN

Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where

I was.

EDWARD

Occupational hazard?

VIVIAN

Where'd you go?

EDWARD

I took the couch.  I had some work

to do.

(hesitating)

About last night...

VIVIAN

Oooh, Baby, you were the best.

I was beside myself.

EDWARD

Mmm, I could tell.

VIVIAN

I just hope it was worth three

hundred bucks.

EDWARD

I'd say you give a good dollar

value.

EDWARD

Do you ever... enjoy it?

VIVIAN

I like guys if that's what you're

asking.  Not that I trust'm.

EDWARD

No?  Why's that?

VIVIAN

"Occupational hazard".

VIVIAN (cont'd)

what do you do anyway?

EDWARD

I buy companies.

VIVIAN

No shit.  They expensive?

EDWARD

The one I'm buying this week will

cost around 150 million.

VIVIAN

... dollars?

VIVIAN (cont'd)

You are major league, baby.  Your

mother must be very proud.

VIVIAN

So what a ya do with the companies

once you buy'm?

EDWARD

(fumbling with the tie)

I sell them.

VIVIAN

What?  Why?

VIVIAN (cont'd)

At ease, let me do that.  Part

of the all night services.

EDWARD

By breaking up a company's assets

--

VIVIAN

What are assets?

EDWARD

Vivian --

VIVIAN

C'mon, I might buy a company some

day.

EDWARD

Assets are anything of value a

company owns.  Sometimes the

pieces are worth more than the

whole.  By selling them off, I

make a profit.

VIVIAN

Sorta like stealing cars and

selling'm for parts, huh?

EDWARD

Not... quite.

VIVIAN

There, see?  Now the emblem is

right in the middle of the knot.

EDWARD

Where'd you learn to do this?

VIVIAN

(sarcastic)

I fucked the debate team in high

school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa.

He liked ties on Sundays.  You

mind if I take a swim in your

bathtub before I hit it?

EDWARD

Don't drown.

VIVIAN

You could hold a pep rally in

here!

EDWARD

(into the phone)

Yes.

STUCKEY

Edward, it's me.  Kross is all

set for tonight.

STUCKEY

Listen, I gotta say this again,

I don't like you going alone.

EDWARD

(stifling a chuckle)

I'm a big boy.

STUCKEY

Let me at least get you a date.

Keep it social.

STUCKEY

Edward, did you hear me?

EDWARD

I'm here.

STUCKEY

I know a lot of nice girls.

EDWARD

I have one.

EDWARD

All right.  How much for the week?

VIVIAN

What?

EDWARD

I'm in town until Saturday.

EDWARD

Do-you-want-to-stay-here-

for-the-week?

VIVIAN

It'd cost you.

EDWARD

Of course.  How much?

VIVIAN

Five full nights... days too?

VIVIAN

Four thousand.

EDWARD

Vivian, may I point out five more

nights at three hundred a night

is only 1,500.

VIVIAN

But you want days too.

EDWARD

All right, two thousand.

VIVIAN

Three.

EDWARD

Done.

VIVIAN

Holy shit.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Sugar, you got it.  I will treat

you like a prince.  Anything,

anyway you want.

EDWARD

I'm not just talking about sex.

VIVIAN

Look butthead, I'll treat you so

nice you'll never want to let me

go, okay?

EDWARD

Three thousand for five days.

And Vivian, I will let you go.

EDWARD

I'll be out most of the day.

EDWARD

I want you to go out and buy some

decent clothes.

EDWARD

Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.

Conservative.  Understand?

VIVIAN

Yeah, you want me to dress like

your high class girlfriend.

You're wasting your money though.

All I'm gonna do is hang around

the hotel.  As a matter of fact,

I may never get out of that

bathtub.

EDWARD

Think again.  I'm taking you out

to an important dinner with me

tonight.

VIVIAN (O.S.)

(from inside)

What?  Are you crazy?

EDWARD

Probably.

VIVIAN

Three thousand...

VIVIAN

Three thousand!

KIT (O.S.)

'Lo.

VIVIAN

Kit!  Where've you been?

KIT (O.S.)

I was asleep.  You woke me.  You

okay?

VIVIAN

Kit, listen, the guy last night,

the one in the Ferrari, I'm at

this hotel, the Regent Beverly

Wilshire, it's this absolutely

unbelievable place and he's hired

me for a whole week and Kit,

listen, he's paying me three

thousand bucks!  We can get out

of the apartment.  We can get out

of this town.  We can do anything!

(silence)

Kit?  Hey, you there?

KIT (O.S.)

Why'd he want you?

VIVIAN

He... he just does.

KIT (O.S.)

I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been

on my back.

(a beat)

Did you get the money up front

like I taught ya'?

VIVIAN

Three hundred for last night and

he gave me extra to buy some

clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna

leave an envelope for you at the

front desk.

Give me two hundred to the scum

bucket and the other hundred to

that asshole landlord for part

of the rent.  Spend it on drugs

and I'll pull your hair out.

KIT

I'm getting dressed now.  I'll

be over.  Bye.

VIVIAN

Hey Kit, where do I go for the

clothes?  Good stuff on him.

KIT (O.S.)

(brightening)

In Beverly Hills?

VIVIAN

Yeah.

KIT (O.S.)

Baby!  Rodeo Drive.

SALESWOMAN

(cooly)

May I help you?

VIVIAN

I'm just looking, thanks.

SALESWOMAN

Are you looking for something in

particular?

VIVIAN

Yes.  Something... conservative.

SALESWOMAN

Yes...

VIVIAN

You have beautiful things.

(no reply)

How much is this?

SALESWOMAN

I don't think it would fit you.

VIVIAN

(beginning to get the

drift)

I didn't ask if it would fit.

I asked how much it was.

SALESWOMAN

It's very expensive.

VIVIAN

What is with you?

SALESWOMAN

(unblinking)

Excuse me?

VIVIAN

I'm going to spend money.

SALESWOMAN

I don't think we have anything

for you here.  You're obviously

in the wrong place.

MR. THOMAS

May I help you Miss?

VIVIAN

I'm just going to my room.

MR. THOMAS

You're a guest here?

VIVIAN

I'm -- I'm with a friend.

MR. THOMAS

And who is that?

VIVIAN

I... Edward...

VIVIAN

(blurting it out)

He knows me.

MR. THOMAS

Do you know this young lady?

OPERATOR

She's with Mr. Harris.

MR. THOMAS

(surprised)

Mr. Harris?

OPERATOR

She apparently joined him last

night.

MR. THOMAS

Why don't you come with me.  We'll

chat for just a moment.

MR. THOMAS

What's your name?

VIVIAN

Vivian.

MR. THOMAS

Miss Vivian... things that go

on in other hotels don't happen

at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

Mr. Harris, however, is a very

special customer.  And we like

to think of our special customers

as friends.  As a customer, we

would expect Mr. Harris to sign

in any additional guests.  But

as a friend, we're willing to

overlook it, I'm assuming you're

a... relative?

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

I thought so.  You must be his...?

VIVIAN

Niece?

MR. THOMAS

Of course.  Naturally when Mr.

Harris leaves, I won't see you

in this hotel again.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

Good.  We understand one another.

(as a gentle

afterthought:)

I would also encourage you to

dress in a more appropriate

manner.

VIVIAN

That's what I was trying to do.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

I was trying to get some other

clothes... but...

they wouldn't... they made me feel

like shit...

MR. THOMAS

(into the phone)

Women's clothing.

(beat)

Bridget, please.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

Bridget, hello, this is Barnard

Thomas over at the Regent Beverly

Wilshire.  Well, thank you, that's

flattering.  I'd like to ask a

favor of you.  I'm going to send

someone over.  Her name is Vivian.

She's a guest of ours.  A very

special guest.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

She's from out of town and she

needs a little help in dressing.

Perhaps you could help her out.

Thank you very much.  She'll be

right over.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

There you are.  If you have any

other problems, come ask for me

personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas.

VIVIAN

Barney.

VANCE

Okay... this is the jewel in

Kross's crown.  We can strip out

all the heavy equipment.  Some

of the cranes are very valuable

overseas.  The Japanese are

salivating for them.

STUCKEY

Prime industrial property

straddling the Port of Long Beach

and Los Angeles.  It gives me a

hard-on.

EDWARD

What's that long building over

there?

JAKE

Storage, I think.

EDWARD

Not with those smokestacks it's

not.

VANCE

Let me check.

JAKE

The real estate possibilities

are endless.  Most of the yard

we'll just level.  I talked to

a couple of developers, under the

table, of course, and they said

--

EDWARD

You what?

JAKE

I talked to some developers about

the land.

STUCKEY

What kind of an idiot are you?

You don't talk about this to

anyone.

JAKE

They're close friends, they'd

never breathe a word --

STUCKEY

(to Vance)

Where did you dig this moron up?

VANCE

He's right, Jake, that was an

incredibly stupid thing to do.

It won't happen again, Edward.

I'll pull him off the project

immediately.

EDWARD

Don't bother.

STUCKEY

What!?

EDWARD

We don't have the time to bring

someone new up to speed.

Besides...

(not unkindly, to Jake)

You've already impressed everyone

you need to, haven't you?

JAKE

It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.

VANCE

This is interesting.  That

building is storage now, but it

used to be a smelting plant.  They

closed it down after World War

II.

EDWARD

I want our lawyers to check into

the toxic waste licences on them

right away.  I want to know if the

permits are still valid and what

kind of limits are on them.

STUCKEY

Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but

if the permits are still in

effect, they're worth a fortune.

EDWARD

What time's diner tonight?

STUCKEY

Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing

his son.  Very bright kid, watch

yourself with him.  Who's this

girl you're taking?

EDWARD

No one you know.

BRIDGET

You must be Vivian.

BRIDGET (cont'd)

Let's look at you...

BRIDGET (cont'd)

Where are you from, dear?

VIVIAN

(pause)

Georgia.

BRIDGET

No wonder.  For starts, you should

know that hot pants are horrid,

even when you do have the legs

to carry them off.  What are your

plans while you're in town?

VIVIAN

Well... I might be going out to

dinner.

BRIDGET

You'll want a cocktail dress

then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful

figure.  A little too out in the

open but simply lovely.  Size six?

Do you need shoes?

VIVIAN

I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather

boots go with a cocktail dress?

BRIDGET

(calling out)

Philip!  We'll need shoes!

BRIDGET

Your uncle will like this.

VIVIAN

He's not really my uncle.

BRIDGET

They never are, dear.

VIVIAN

I got a dress.

MR. THOMAS

(dryly)

I rather hoped you'd be wearing

it.

VIVIAN

I didn't want to get it messed.

I got shoes too.  Wanna see?

MR. THOMAS

That's all right.  I'm sure

they're quite lovely.

VIVIAN

They were real nice to me there.

They treated me, y'know... nice.

Thanks, Barney.

MR. THOMAS

You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN

Hello?

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Hello?  What?  Hello?

EDWARD

Never answer the phone.  Ever.

VIVIAN

Tsk, believe me, this will be the

last time.

EDWARD

Did you buy some clothes?

VIVIAN

I got a dress, yeah.

EDWARD

Just one?  Christ... I hope it's

appropriate.

VIVIAN

It's very tasteful.  I think

you'll especially like the zipper

in the crotch.

(silence)

I'm -- joking.

EDWARD

Let's hope so.  You'll get some

more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be

pushed for time so meet me in the

hotel lobby at seven forty-five

sharp.  Got it?

VIVIAN

No, I don't "got it".  Even the

farmboys back in Georgia come to

the door when they're taking you

on a date.

EDWARD

This isn't a date.

VIVIAN

Go by yourself then.  Where you

taking me anyway?

EDWARD

The Rex.

VIVIAN

Any good?

EDWARD

I think you'll approve.

VIVIAN

... all right.  I'll meet you in

the lobby.  But only cause you're

paying me to.

EDWARD

Thank you very much.

VIVIAN

Hello?

EDWARD

I thought I told you not to answer

the phone.

VIVIAN

Oooh!

MAID

Housekeeping.  I come to turn

down the bed.  5:00, I turn down

the bed.

VIVIAN

What?

MAID

Housekeeping.  I come to turn

down the bed.

VIVIAN

Okay.

VIVIAN

Is there a trick to it?

VIVIAN

Is that all?  You just fold back

the bedspread?

MAID

I also place las chocolates on

the pillow.

VIVIAN

Oooh, I love those.

MAID

I leave extras, miss.

VIVIAN

Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich

people so lazy they can't do this

on their own?

VIVIAN

Barney.

MR. THOMAS

What is it, Miss Vivian?

VIVIAN

Edward is taking me to some fancy

place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever

been there?

MR. THOMAS

It's a bit beyond my... range,

shall we say.

VIVIAN

Yeah, mine too.  Is it like,

y'know, normal?

MR. THOMAS

I think you'll find it normal

enough.

VIVIAN

Will I like it?

MR. THOMAS

You'll like it fine.

VIVIAN

Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're

the best.

MR. THOMAS

Just mind which fork you use.

VIVIAN

Fork?

MR. THOMAS

In fifteen minutes I can teach

you everything you need to know

to dine with the Queen.  First,

as you pick up the knife you shift

your fork to the left hand.

VIVIAN

But I always eat like this.

MR. THOMAS

Either you're European or badly

brought up.

VIVIAN

Hmmm... I vonder vich.

(giggles)

MR. THOMAS

Actually, some of the richest

people I know have the worst

manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris,

being of old money, knows his way

around a table.  All right now,

pay attention please.  Salad fork.

VIVIAN

What if they serve soup?

MR. THOMAS

They will serve salad.

VIVIAN

But what if they serve soup?

MR. THOMAS

Then you use your soup spoon.

VIVIAN

(smiles)

I like steak.

MR. THOMAS

(picking up the

appropriate utensil)

Then you would use your--

VIVIAN

Steak spoon!

(laughs)

MR. THOMAS

Miss Vivian --

VIVIAN

Maybe I'll just order a burger,

Barney, that way I can eat with

my hands.

MR. THOMAS

Miss Vivian... there's a salon

here in the hotel.  Instead of

worrying unnecessarily about table

manners, why don't you just have

your hair done instead?

VIVIAN

Professionally?

VIVIAN

I have a friend who has a friend

who does Cher's wigs.

THANE

I hate him already.

(a beat)

All set?

VIVIAN

Yeah... what a ya say we chop

it all off and bleach the tips.

THANE

Darling?  Trust me.

MR. THOMAS

Good evening, Mr. Harris.

MR. THOMAS

Barnard Thomas, manager of the

hotel.

EDWARD

Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse

me just a moment --

MR. THOMAS

I have a message for you from your

"niece", sir.

EDWARD

My what?

MR. THOMAS

The young lady staying in your

room?

EDWARD

I think we both know she's not

my niece.

EDWARD (cont'd)

Does this hotel have any problem

with that?

MR. THOMAS

Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is

a guest of ours and shall be

treated accordingly.  The young

lady asked me to tell you that

she is waiting for you in the

lounge.

EDWARD

Thank you.

MR. THOMAS

Very intriguing young woman, Miss

Vivian.

MR. THOMAS (cont'd)

Have a good evening, sir.

VIVIAN

You're late.

EDWARD

I'm sorry.

VIVIAN

You're forgiven.

KROSS

So young man, I understand you

are trying to take over my

company.

EDWARD

Please don't patronize me, Mr.

Kross.  Our ages mean nothing

here.

DAVID

Mr. Harris, we know you've

purchased at least twenty percent

of our stock.  We also know you

plan to file a formal bid for a

majority share.

EDWARD

Twenty-five percent.

KROSS

Mr. Harris, I built Kross

Enterprises myself.  I know every

man who ever worked there by his

first name.  I know their wives...

and their children.  If your

intention is to take over my

company and turn it into a

glorified real estate deal, think

again.

EDWARD

What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?

KROSS

What would it take to buy our

stock back?  Name your price.

EDWARD

To get me in a mood to sell --

double what I paid.  But your

company doesn't have enough

capital right now to buy anything.

DAVID

We're on the verge of closing

a large navy contract.  Double

is ridiculous but we can assure

you a healthy profit on your

shares.  We would give you a

promissory note...

EDWARD

You're not getting any navy

contracts.

DAVID

There's no way you could know

that.

EDWARD

But I do know.  I also know your

lines of credit are over-extended.

If I don't buy your company,

someone else will...

(looking up)

Ah, the escargot.

VIVIAN

(softly, to the Waiter)

Scume me, what are these things?

WAITER

(bending to whisper)

Escargot, mademoiselle.

EDWARD

(leaning close to

whisper)

Snails.

EDWARD

Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell

you my stock.  On the contrary,

I'm here to buy yours.

KROSS

(angry)

You've got a lot of nerve.

EDWARD

No.  What I have is a lot of

money.

KROSS

I know all about you, Mr. Harris.

When you buy companies, they have

a way of disappearing.  Even the

pension funds are stripped clean.

The last three companies you took

over were cut up in so many

pieces, widows were left without

their retirement checks.

EDWARD

(calmly)

What I did with those companies

was perfectly legal.

KROSS

I don't question the legality

of what you do.  It's your

morality that makes me sick.  I

will not allow my company to be

raped by a man like you.

EDWARD

(angry now)

It is not your company.  It's a

public company.  And I am going

to acquire it.  Either I buy from

the other stock holders, or I buy

from you.

EDWARD (cont'd)

I would suggest that you and your

board cooperate with me, rather

than fight a battle you don't have

the ammunition to win.

VIVIAN

Slippery little suckers...

KROSS

If you'll excuse me young lady,

Mr. Harris...

(turns to David)

Deal with this, David, you know

where we stand.  I need to go

someplace and puke.

DAVID

(to Edward and Vivian)

Men like my father built this

country.  He was no saint.  He

screwed people.  But for every

guy he stepped on, he gave a

hundred a good job.

VIVIAN

He seems like a nice man.

EDWARD

We can reach an understanding on

this.

DAVID

I don't think so.  You should

know we're going to fight you with

every resource we have.

EDWARD

Do what you have to do.  I don't

take it personally.

DAVID

I do.  I take it all very

personally.

(to Vivian)

Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

EDWARD

(a beat)

And that's the way the game is

played.

VIVIAN

Some game.  Screwin' some poor

slob out of his retirement.

VIVIAN

Snails for dinner.  No wonder

everybody is in such a bad mood.

WAITER

Are we ready for the next course,

sir?

EDWARD

No.  Bring a check, please.

EDWARD

Thank you.

VIVIAN

You're upset, huh?

EDWARD

Upset.  No.  I never get upset

about business.

VIVIAN

You liked the guy, though.

EDWARD

Whether I liked him or not is

irrelevant.  It's business.

There's no emotion involved in

business... if you want to

survive.

VIVIAN

(excited)

We're the exactly the same!  Kit

keeps telling me don't get

emotional when you turn tricks

-- that's why no kissing -- it's

too personal.

The key is like you're saying,

stay numb, don't get involved --

when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,

I just do it.

(realizing what she's

saying and quickly

recovers)

Except with you.  At your price

I give my all...

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Let's not talks about this heavy

stuff.  Come on, relax.

EDWARD

That... is very good.

VIVIAN

Know what we're gonna do in a

little while then?  We're gonna

call Domino's and have'm deliver

a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat

it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out

and watch television.

EDWARD

Television?

VIVIAN

Yeah, it's this box, it has

pictures, sound.  You don't have

to use your brain at all.

EDWARD

I have work to do.

VIVIAN

Uh-uh.  No work.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

See... what you haven't figured

out yet...

VIVIAN (cont'd)

Is that while you're the boss

everyplace else... I'm the one

in charge here.

VIVIAN (cont'd)

You... just think you are.

EDWARD (O.S.)

Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop.

EDWARD

I still don't understand why you

only bought one dress.

VIVIAN

I wasn't as much fun as I

thought it was going to be.

EDWARD

Why not?

VIVIAN

Well, you know those cold bitches

that work in those stores and try

to intimidate you?  It works.

EDWARD

Was someone rude to you?

VIVIAN

I had a little problem in one

store.  I wasn't dressed right.

I don't know what to say.  I don't

belong there.  Maybe I'll just

go back to Bridget.  She was cool.

EDWARD

Vivian, you belong wherever you

are.  I don't care how you were

dressed, they were the ones who

were wrong, not you.

EDWARD (cont'd)

People aren't going to respect

you unless you respect yourself.

(a beat)

The next time someone is rude to

you, you stare at them right here.

EDWARD (cont'd)

It's an old trick I use,

especially with bankers.  Works

every time.  Will you try it?

VIVIAN

(confidently)

Okay.

EDWARD

Good.

VIVIAN

(a beat)

Come with me?

VIVIAN

Please.

VIVIAN

(nervous)

Hello.  Can you help me?

VIVIAN

(confidently)

I'm looking for a dress, nothing

too flashy, not too sexy,

conservative.  In a size six.

SALESGIRL

(uncomfortable under

Vivian's stare)

Do... do you have a charge

account with us?

VIVIAN

(sighing)

I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.

VANCE

Kross came out of his corner

swinging.  He started buying up

all available stock as soon as

the market opened.

EDWARD

(almost to himself)

He's a tough old son of a

bitch...

VANCE

It's up to ten and a quarter.

EDWARD

Offer nine and a half.  Bring

them back down to earth.

STUCKEY

Goddamit!  Where is he getting

the money to fight?

EDWARD

Someone's loaning it to him.

Get on it right away.

STUCKEY

Our contract guys are working

on the Kross pension funds.

There's another forty million

there.  We can bleed'm dry.

EDWARD

(to Vance & Stuckey)

Put the pension funds on hold

until I say otherwise.

STUCKEY

(surprised)

We're letting them slide?

EDWARD

I want the treatment plant

licenses to be top priority right

now.

STUCKEY

But, Edward...

EDWARD

Do it.

EDWARD

(looks at his watch)

You're on your own now, Vivian.

I've got to get to work.  Be

sensible and you can keep

everything.  Spend too much and

it all goes back.

VIVIAN

Not me!

VIVIAN

(imitating Bridget)

Horrid!

VIVIAN

Where'd you get your tie?

SALESWOMAN

(to the customer)

Isn't this lovely?  I think it

would look wonderful on you.

SALESWOMAN

(to her customer)

Would you like to try it on?

VIVIAN

'Scume me.

SALESWOMAN

Yes?

VIVIAN

Do you remember me?

SALESWOMAN

No, I'm sorry, I don't.

VIVIAN

I was in here yesterday.

VIVIAN

Yeah.  That's right.  It's me.

I want you to know something.

You made me feel terrible. I

wasn't dressed right and you said

I didn't belong here.  Well, I

do.  You're the one that was

wrong, not me.  And I want to tell

you something else.  I'm never

gonna shop here again as long as

I live.

VIVIAN

Wheee!!!

STUCKEY

(gloating)

You were right.  Kross mortgaged

everything he has down to his

grandson's college tuition to

secure loans from a bank.  Not

just any bank.  One we do business

with.

STUCKEY (cont'd)

It goes without saying that your

business means a great deal more

to them than our friend Kross's.

(a beat)

All you have to do is make a call.

STUCKEY

Excuse me for saying this but what

is wrong with you this week?

First, you go soft on the pension

funds.  Now, you're giving him

the chance to get away?  As of

two minutes ago, you are committed

to the tune of over fifty million

dollars --

EDWARD

Come on, Bill, don't talk to me

about how much money's involved.

It's my money.

STUCKEY

And some of it's mine.  Edward,

his jugular's exposed.

EDWARD

Get the bank on the phone for me.

VIVIAN (O.S.)

Hi.

VIVIAN

I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

EDWARD

Thank you.  I would.

(he fingers her dressing

gown)

Nice.

VIVIAN

Wait till you see what I have

on underneath.

EDWARD

Please.

VIVIAN

What about dinner?

EDWARD

Dinner can wait.

VIVIAN

You always been rich?

EDWARD

No.

VIVIAN

Seems like it.  I guess it's easy

to get used to, huh?

EDWARD

Easier than learning how to be

poor.

(a moment; and then:)

My father's family was wealthy.

When I was young there were cars

and houses, private schools,

nannies.  But then my father

divorced my mother to marry

another woman.  And he took his

money with him.

VIVIAN

Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.

EDWARD

Not much to tell.  I went to

public school.  Went to

university on scholarship.  Went

to work for an investment firm.

In eight years I owned it.

(and then; growing very

quiet)

My father was chairman of the

board of the third company I ever

went after.  I swallowed that

company and shit out the pieces.

One of the pieces was him.

VIVIAN

You still mad at'm?

EDWARD

He died a long time ago.

WAITER (O.S.)

Miss Vivian?

WAITER

You have a call.  Mr. Harris.

VIVIAN

(taking the phone)

Hi, baby.

(a moment)

I'll be ready.  Bye.

VIVIAN

What do you wear to polo?

VIVIAN

You're really pushing it,

bringing me here.

EDWARD

I think it's exciting.

VIVIAN

What id we run into someone I

know?

EDWARD

I really doubt anyone here

frequents Hollywood Boulevard.

VIVIAN

You did.

STUCKEY (O.S.)

Edward!

STUCKEY (cont'd)

Come on!  Over here!

STUCKEY

(looking at Vivian)

Well, well, well...

EDWARD

Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.

STUCKEY

(holding out a hand;

smiling)

Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife,

Elizabeth.

VIVIAN

Hi.

STUCKEY

Lots of fun people here.  Let me

get you two some champagne.

ELIZABETH STUCKEY

Excuse me.

VIVIAN

(sarcastic)

Real genuine guy.

EDWARD

He's good at what he does.

VIVIAN

You could freeze ice on his wife's

ass.  She anything like your ex?

EDWARD

(a small smile)

Shall we mingle?

WOMAN

I simply love your dress, Vivian.

VIVIAN

This old thing?

WOMAN

Of course, a figure like yours

can wear anything.  You must work

out constantly.

VIVIAN

I lead a very physical life.

OLDER MAN

Are you into running, Vivian?

VIVIAN

I'm into walking.  I walk a lot.

ANOTHER MAN

You look awfully familiar, Vivian.

Haven't we run into one another

at the spa in La Costa?

VIVIAN

Well, I do often spa there.

ELIZABETH STUCKEY

Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm

and witty and down to earth.

EDWARD

(with pleasure)

She is, isn't she.

ELIZABETH STUCKEY

So unlike your usuals.  Where on

earth did you find her?

A WOMAN

We're good together.  He has to

admit it.  I've been just what

he wants me to be.  I say the

right things, I know the right

people, I give wonderful parties.

No question, no arguments, no

embarrassments.  It works for both

of us.

VIVIAN

Edward, these women here, I don't

think any of'm like the guys

they're with.  They're just into

it for the money.

EDWARD

I'm sure that's true for some of

them.

VIVIAN

I thought I was the pro.  These

women make me feel like an

amateur.

EDWARD

(a beat)

Ready to stomp sod?

DAVID KROSS

Hi.

VIVIAN

Hi.  I never thought stomping

in grass could be so much fun.

DAVID

(laughs)

I like your hat.

VIVIAN

Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?

(pleased; a moment)

Uhm... how're... business things

going.

DAVID

Let's not talk about it, it's too

depressing.  Come on, I'll show

you Thunder.

VIVIAN

Please, we hardly know each other.

DAVID

Thunder's a horse.  Come on.

DAVID

Hey, big guy, you getting tired,

yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.

(a beat; and then:)

You two been together long?  You

and Edward?

VIVIAN

No.

DAVID

Hope to be?

VIVIAN

It's... it's not like that.

DAVID

I see.  Well.  Maybe that means

you'd have lunch with me sometime

then.

DAVID (cont'd)

I'm sorry, am I being too forward?

VIVIAN

You don't know anything about me.

DAVID

I'd like to find out.  You don't

know anything about me either.

That's why people have lunch.

STUCKEY

Fill me in on this.  How'd you

and Vivian meet?

EDWARD

We just did.

STUCKEY

(grinning)

Come on, you can tell me.  I sure

would like to know where a guy

runs into a girl as attractive

as this.

EDWARD

The night I left your house, I

was lost.  I was looking for

directions.

STUCKEY

And you just happened to run into

her.  Great.  What's she do?  She

work?

EDWARD

Yes...

STUCKEY

Doing what?

EDWARD

Vivian's in sales.

STUCKEY

Sales, really?  That's great.

What does she sell?

EDWARD

Why do you want to know?

STUCKEY

Hear me out.  I've known you a

long time.  I see a difference

in you this week.  Like that tie.

I'm suddenly wondering if this

girl's not the difference.

Especially when I see her talking

with David Kross.

EDWARD

She met him at dinner last

night... I like this tie.

STUCKEY

So now they're best friends?

Edward, this girl appears out of

nowhere and now I see her talking

to a guy whose company we're

trying to buy.  It's too

convenient.

EDWARD

You're being ridiculous.

STUCKEY

Industrial espionage is not

ridiculous.  Edward, how do you

know she hasn't attached herself

to you so she can bring Kross back

information?

EDWARD

Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,

she's a hooker.  I picked her up

off Hollywood Boulevard.

STUCKEY

I swear to God, you are the only

millionaire I ever heard of who'd

go looking for a goddam bargain

streetwalker!

EDWARD

Let's drop it, shall we?

MAN

Edward!  May we have your opinion

on something?

EDWARD

(to Vivian and Stuckey)

Excuse me a moment.

STUCKEY

Having a good time, Vivian?

VIVIAN

Yeah.  Thanks.

STUCKEY

All this must be quite a change

from Hollywood Boulevard.

VIVIAN

What?

STUCKEY

It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your

secret's safe with me.

STUCKEY (cont'd)

What do you charge, Vivian?

Maybe you and I could get together

after Edward leaves.

VIVIAN

(forcing a bitter smile)

Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me

at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

STUCKEY

I just might do that.

EDWARD

You're awfully quiet.  You haven't

said a word since the party.

VIVIAN

You asshole!  I can't believe what

a --!

EDWARD

Vivian, what the --

VIVIAN

Clean the slut up, take her out,

huh?!  What are you trying to

prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat

for you to offer to your friends!

EDWARD

I don't know what you're talking

about.

VIVIAN

I've been with stinking old men

who've made me want to puke but

I've never had anyone make me feel

as dirty as you did tonight.

EDWARD

Would you please calm down.  Tell

me what happened.

VIVIAN

Stuckey!  He wants an

"appointment" with me after you

leave.  You my pimp now or did

he think that up on his own?

EDWARD

What was I supposed to do?

(a beat)

I told the truth.  Why should the

truth upset you?  It's not as if

you're from a convent.

VIVIAN

I want my fucking money.  I'm

getting out of here.  I don't want

anything more to do with you.

EDWARD

Can we talk about this?  Can you

just try to calm down?

VIVIAN

Your goddamned friend, he thinks

the only reason I'm with you is

for the money.

VIVIAN

(defiantly)

Well, it's true.  Just pay me

what you owe me and I'm gone.

EDWARD

Vivian...

VIVIAN

Pay me!  Before I pick up this

chair and smash your face in.

EDWARD

Fine.  I'm only here a couple

of more days and I'm not going

to spend them fighting with you.

VIVIAN

Fuck off.

EDWARD

I'll call you a cab.  If you want

the clothes, pack them up.

EDWARD

Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't

prepared for questions about us.

It was an idiotic and insensitive

thing I did.  I should have known

that it would hurt you.

VIVIAN

I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt

you when somebody pisses on you,

it just pissed you off.

EDWARD

I really am sorry.

VIVIAN

You hurt me.

EDWARD

I'll make it up to you.

STUCKEY

This is no time to disappear.

We're in too far.

EDWARD

Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross

isn't going anywhere and I don't

need to spend the rest of the day

watching his stock go down.  I'll

be in the office tomorrow.

STUCKEY

Promise me you'll read those

contracts by then.

EDWARD

Goodbye, Bill.

STUCKEY

Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!

MR. THOMAS

Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.

EDWARD

Afternoon.

VIVIAN

C'mon, Kit...

VIVIAN

Do I look okay?

EDWARD

(a small smile)

Hmm... let's see... no, there's

something missing.

VIVIAN

What's that?

EDWARD

I don't want you to get too

excited... these are on loan...

however...

EDWARD

This is made for a princess.

I think she'd approve of you

wearing it tonight.  There.

Come look.

VIVIAN

Edward, I can't.

EDWARD

Shush.  Of course you can.

VIVIAN

What if I lose it?

EDWARD

You won't.

VIVIAN

What if someone tries to steal

it?

EDWARD

I'll guard them and you with my

life.

PILOT

Your plane is ready to go, Mr.

Harris.

EDWARD

Very good.

VIVIAN

Plane?

EDWARD

You don't want to go all the way

to San Francisco in a limousine,

do you?  I don't.

VIVIAN

Where are you taking me!?

EDWARD

To meet some friends.  Rudolpho,

a poet... Benoit, a landlord...

Mimi, a flower maker...

VIVIAN

Huh?

EDWARD

The opera.

VIVIAN

I've never been on a plane

before.

EDWARD

I'm glad you like it.  Now be

quiet, I've really got to read

these.

EDWARD

Vivian, what do you think you're

doing?

VIVIAN

Being quiet.

VIVIAN (O.S.)

You ever been in love with

anyone?

VIVIAN

Sorry.  You're not paying me to

ask you question like that.

EDWARD

Vivian.  I'm paying you to be

you.  Be you.

(a beat)

Have you?  Ever been in love with

anyone?

VIVIAN

You mean, besides Elvis?

(turning back to the

window)

I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once.

First time I ever ran away from

home, I got as far as Atlanta.

I met this boy.  He'd been with

his parents on their way to

Chicago.  They stopped at a gas

station.  He went to the john.

When he came back they'd split.

We sorta started looking out for

each other.  Aw, he was sweet.

And boy, was he good looking,

y'know, dark hair and eyes.

The chicken hawks were on him all

the time.  He hated that.

Sometimes we'd find a safe place

to crash nights and we'd curl up

together and we'd talk about all

these crazy things.  The two of

us getting married someday.

Having kids.  Stupid stuff.

EDWARD

What happened to him?

VIVIAN

My father found me.  Dragged me

home.  I don't know why, he never

seemed to like me much when I was

there.

(a bitter smile)

'Cept when he was drunk, then he

liked me a whole lot.

(a moment)

I made it back to Atlanta a year

later.  Andy was gone.

VIVIAN

Aw, but things sure look fine

when you're sitting way up high.

EDWARD

Some people say that opera is an

acquired taste, but I don't

believe it.  You can always tell

when someone goes to the opera

for the first time.  They either

love it or hate it.  Those who

love it will always love it; those

who hate it might come to

appreciate it, but they'll never

truly love it.

EDWARD

Viv?  I really doubt if anyone

here is going to try and grab it.

EDWARD

They all think you look very

beautiful, Vivian.

VIVIAN

If it's in Italian, how will I

know what they're saying?

EDWARD

I'll whisper some of the main

parts of the story to you.  But

you'll be surprised how much you

understand.  The music conveys

the story more powerfully than

any words.

VIVIAN

But don't they have it in

English?

EDWARD

Vivian, don't be afraid of what

you don't know.  That's the fun

of it.

VIVIAN

(resigned)

Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm

glad you brought me.

EDWARD

What am I?  I am a poet.  Not

a man of wealth but one rich in

dreams.  You have come to replace

my vanished dreams.  I dwell now

only in your eyes.

EDWARD

And now she asks Rudolpho if he

still thinks her beautiful --

OLDER WOMAN

Did you enjoy the opera, dear?

VIVIAN

(tearfully)

It was so beautiful I just about

pissed my pants.

EDWARD

If you'd gone on about how much

you liked it, I'm not sure I'd

have believed you.

VIVIAN

I more than liked it.

EDWARD

I know.  I'm glad.

VIVIAN

Did you?

EDWARD

Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more.

Thank you.

VIVIAN

Love you...

EDWARD

Yes?

STUCKEY

Did I wake you?

EDWARD

I'm up.

STUCKEY

I had to call.  I jus got off

the phone with James Kross.  Get

this.  He wants to see you.

Today.

EDWARD

Why?

STUCKEY

He wouldn't say.  Edward... I

think we got him.  His nuts are

on the block and we got him.

(silence)

You there?

EDWARD

Give me twenty minutes.

STUCKEY

We'll be there.  Listen, if he's

really caving in, we'll go from

there down to the office.  I want

him to commit his stock to us this

morning.

VIVIAN

Mmm.

(opening her eyes;

looking at him)

Hi.

EDWARD

Better get dressed.  We're having

guests.

VIVIAN

Here.  Let me.

EDWARD

(quietly)

One more night and you're finally

rid of me.

VIVIAN

Yeah, you've been pretty tough

to take.

EDWARD

I have to go to New York

tomorrow.

EDWARD (cont'd)

But I'll be back in Los Angeles.

Soon.  I'd like to see you again.

I thought we could work out

something... An arrangement.

EDWARD (cont'd)

I'll get you an apartment, buy

you a car --

EDWARD (cont'd)

What is it?

VIVIAN

(not unkindly)

What else?  You gonna leave some

cash by the bed when you pass

through town?

EDWARD

It wouldn't be like that.  I want

to get you off the street.  You'll

have a different kind of life.

What's wrong with that?

VIVIAN

I'm sorry.  That's very sweet,

Edward, and I know you mean it...

EDWARD

Vivian, I've thought about this

a lot.  This is the best solution.

VIVIAN

(shakes her head "no,"

then continues tying

his tie)

When I was a little girl, my

mother locked me in the attic when

I was bad, which was pretty often.

I'd stare out the window up there

and make believe I was a princess

trapped in the tower by the wicked

queen.  Then suddenly a knight

on a white horse with his bright

colors flying would ride up.

Rescue me from the tower, and then

we'd ride off... but never, ever

in all the times I had that dream

did the knight say, "Come on baby,

I'll put you up in a great condo."

EDWARD

Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.

VIVIAN

(softly; to herself)

I know.

(a beat)

Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being

stupid.

(more)

I'll think about it, okay?  It's

a real good offer for a whore.

EDWARD

I've never treated you like a

whore.

VIVIAN

(not mean)

You just did.

KROSS

Mr. Harris.

EDWARD

How are you, Mr. Kross.

KROSS

Not bad for a man who hasn't

slept in four nights.  I'll get

used to it.

KROSS

Young lady.

VIVIAN

Hello.

(to David)

Hi.

DAVID

Hello, Vivian.

STUCKEY

Let's not waste time here, shall

we?  Mr. Kross, you said this

morning, you wished to speak with

Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now

listening.

KROSS

Yes.  I'm here to tell you that

I've reconsidered my position on

your acquisition offer.

EDWARD

Expected... offer.

KROSS

Of course, yes.  After the

expected filing period is over,

I'm going to recommend to the

board that we accept your bid.

EDWARD

(a moment)

You're making the right decision,

sir.

KROSS

I'll see you on one condition.

I'm not so concerned for me but

the people who have worked for

me...

STUCKEY

(quickly)

They'll be taken care of.  Won't

they, Edward?

KROSS

I'll sign anything you want then.

STUCKEY

Today.

KROSS

Today.

EDWARD

Excuse me, please?

VIVIAN

Hello.  Is Kit DeLuca there?

When she comes in will you have

her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.

Yes.  Okay.

VIVIAN

What did you do to him?

EDWARD

What do you mean?

VIVIAN

Last time I saw him he was this

strong guy.  Now he's beaten.

And you liked him.

EDWARD

Vivian, I want you to listen to

me.  The man realized that it

would be better for his future

and his son's future, if he

cooperated.

VIVIAN

Right.

EDWARD

It's not your concern.  It's...

business, that's all.

VIVIAN

Business.

EDWARD

Yes.  The man made a business

decision.

VIVIAN

It's all just business to you.

Him.  Me.  Your life.

Everything's business.

EDWARD

It's what I do for a living.

It's how I make money.

EDWARD

I'll be back in a few hours.

We'll talk about this later.

EDWARD

We'll continue this down at the

office.

VIVIAN

Lo?

MR. THOMAS

Barnard Thomas here.  Miss

Vivian, I wonder if you might come

down to the front desk.  There's

someone here to see you.

VIVIAN

Me?

MR. THOMAS

I'd send them up, but sadly, I

don't trust the young lady to find

you on her own.

KIT

Viv?  Where are you, babe?

(glaring at Mr. Thomas)

The sphincter-police won't let

me through.

VIVIAN

Yes, I'm glad you're clean but

I've been calling and calling.

KIT

Was that you?

VIVIAN

Who did you think?

KIT

Carlos.  I still owe him two

hundred bucks...

VIVIAN

Kit, I left that money for you

days ago.

KIT

Yeah.  I just got it.

KIT

Fifty bucks, grampa.  For

seventy-five, the wife can watch.

VIVIAN

Kit...

KIT

Everybody keeps starin' at me.

VIVIAN

Yeah... I know what you mean.

KIT

What do you know?  You look good.

All dressed up.

(meaning it)

You clean up real nice.

(giggling)

You sure don't fit in down on

the Boulevard, lookin' like you

do.  Not that you ever did anyway.

VIVIAN

You think I fit here where they

just about chew your food for you?

KIT

Where do you fit?

VIVIAN

(suddenly)

I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.

KIT

Honey, you're not supposed to

do that.

VIVIAN

I know.  I stopped pretending

and started liking it with him

for real.

KIT

Oh, my god, you mean it was good?

VIVIAN

(miserably)

It was great.

KIT

Dummy.

VIVIAN

He wants to set me up in a place,

give me some money.

KIT

I pray for that.

VIVIAN

(nods)

All I'm doing is feeling lousy

about it.  I don't know what to

do.  What do I do, Kit?

KIT

Go for the bucks.

VIVIAN

I don't care about bucks.

(a beat)

I might love this guy.

KIT

Wow, are you in deep shit.

(a sigh)

You know he'll break your heart.

KIT (cont'd)

I blame myself here.  First time

I laid eyes on ya', I knew you

were too complicated to be a

whore.

JAKE

Congratulations, sir.

EDWARD

What?

JAKE

Mr. Kross is just getting off

the phone with his stock broker.

It's finished.  You've won.

JAKE

Who are you going after next, sir?

EDWARD

Who indeed...

STUCKEY

If we can get these letters of

intent out of the way now... Mr.

Harris and I would like to ask

you some questions about your

company.

DAVID

Dad, excuse me, but that's

inappropriate.  You're under no

obligation to answer any questions

at all.

KROSS

Could we at least wait till after

the filing period?

STUCKEY

Mr. Harris is preparing a bid

based on our speculation of the

corporation's net worth.  The

price he ultimately pays for your

father's stock will be based on

that bid.  The more we know, the

higher our bid can be.

KROSS

It's in my best interest to

cooperate, David.

DAVID

If he throws himself on your

sword, you promise to take care

of him and his family, huh?

STUCKEY

That's unfair!

DAVID

You bed it is.

(to Edward)

You're everything he said you

were.

(to his father)

Do what you have to do, Dad.

Just don't expect me to watch it.

KROSS

He's young.  He hasn't learned

how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll

sign your papers.  And I'll answer

your questions.  Whatever you

want.

EDWARD

Stop.  For just a moment.

(a moment)

Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you

a few questions before you sign.

You realize that you're a target.

If you weren't mine, you'd be

someone elses, correct?

KROSS

Yes.

EDWARD

If you had a... reprieve, what

would do?

STUCKEY

(quickly)

I don't think there's any sense

in --

EDWARD

Let him answer.

KROSS

I... I would take advantage of

it.

EDWARD

How?

KROSS

I... I don't know.  There...

there wasn't time...

EDWARD

I suppose you'd find out soon

enough that you have assets you

presently don't seem aware of,

wouldn't you?  The waste

processing licenses at that

abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd

certainly find out about that.

STUCKEY

Oh, my god... Edward, no!

EDWARD

I suppose you'd use them as

collateral on new loans, wouldn't

you?

STUCKEY

Have you lost your mind?

KROSS

(to Stuckey)

Quiet.

(to Edward)

Would I get the loans?

EDWARD

This time I imagine you would,

yes.

(as if thinking about

it)

Hmm...

(a moment)

With all this in mind, Mr. Kross,

I can't logically make a formal

bid on your company, can I?

KROSS

(a small smile)

You'd be initiating a financial

battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr.

Harris.

EDWARD

You're very right.  I think the

best thing we could all do is go

home.

STUCKEY

What!?

EDWARD

Have a good day, gentlemen.

STUCKEY

(calls)

Edward, what happened?  What kind

of move was that?

STUCKEY

(yells)

Dammit Edward, speak to me.

EDWARD

No... take the car back to the

hotel.  I need to walk.

STUCKEY

Well, well... Hello again.  I'm

looking for Edward.

VIVIAN

Edward's not back.  I thought

he was with you.

STUCKEY

No, I'll just have to wait then,

won't I?

STUCKEY (cont'd)

Mind if I have a drink?

VIVIAN

No.

STUCKEY

Do you want to know what he did?

Do you want to know what the crazy

son of a bitch did?  He handed

the whole thing back to Kross!

On a silver platter.  For no

reason!  What was he thinking,

I mean, what was going through

his goddam head?  Why?

(pours another drink)

What was all that benevolent

crap?  What are we going to

become, a philanthropic

foundation?  I'll probably be the

director of several worthwhile

charities.

VIVIAN

I think it's great.

STUCKEY

I bet.  A lousy whore and you're

the gum in a hundred million

dollar deal.

VIVIAN

(mocking)

Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just

business.

STUCKEY

But what do I know, maybe you're

worth it.  Come on, show me.

Let's see your act.

VIVIAN

Get out!

STUCKEY

Don't worry.  I'll pay for it.

What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty,

thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are

you a fifty dollar whore?

VIVIAN

Are you crazy?

STUCKEY

You got a mean streak in you,

don't you.

STUCKEY (cont'd)

Is that what he likes about you?

Huh?  Answer me!

STUCKEY

You broke my nose.

EDWARD

I think I broke my hand.

(a beat)

You're fired.

STUCKEY

Edward, we've been together ten

years.

EDWARD

And I don't like what we've

become.  I'll cover any losses

you have on this one.  Now get

out, you asshole!

STUCKEY

All this because of that whore!

EDWARD

Yes.

STUCKEY

Edward, think about what you're

--

EDWARD

(to himself, almost

proud)

Well, I didn't plan that!

VIVIAN

Why do guys always know how to

hit a woman?  Right across the

cheek, wham, so it feels like your

eye is gonna explode.  What do

they do, take you all aside in

high school and show you how?

It pisses me off!

EDWARD

Not all men hit.  And no one is

going to hit you anymore.

VIVIAN

Right.

(softening)

You're quite the Sir Galahad

today, aren't ya'?

(a beat)

I heard what you did with Kross.

EDWARD

It was a business decision.

EDWARD

I got tired of hating my father.

VIVIAN

(a small smile)

It was good.

EDWARD

It felt good.

EDWARD

You're packing.

VIVIAN

(nods)

I'm leaving.

(a moment)

Don't ya see?  If I stay with

you like you want me to, there'll

always be some guy, your friends

eve, treatin' me like that...

thinkin' they're allowed to.  What

are you gonna do, fight'm all?

No.  I'll take my money now,

please.

VIVIAN

Aw, don't... no...

EDWARD

Stay with me tonight.  Not

because you're being paid to.

Stay with me because you want to.

VIVIAN

I do.  I do want to.  That's why

I'm leaving.

(turning to him)

That's what you given me, see?

I know what I want now.  I want

a guy like you for real.  Not

because you buy me things and give

me money.  The nicest thing you

ever done for me is hold my hand.

You gonna give me that?

VIVIAN

I didn't think so.

EDWARD

Vivian...

VIVIAN

It's not your fault.  You're

right.  Kit's right.

(looks him right in the

eye)

But I want the fairy tale.

BELLMAN

Let me take those, miss.

VIVIAN

Thanks.

VIVIAN

I'll be out front in a minute.

I got a cab comin'.

VIVIAN

Hi, Barney!

MR. THOMAS

(looking up)

Miss Vivian.

VIVIAN

Look I just wanted to say

goodbye.

MR. THOMAS

Mr. Harris doesn't check out

until tomorrow.

VIVIAN

Yeah, well, I check out today.

MR. THOMAS

You're not accompanying him to

New York?

VIVIAN

(lightly)

Come on, Barney, you and me live

in the real world.

(a beat)

You don't know how to treat a girl

like anything but a lady, Mr.

Thomas.

MR. THOMAS

Certain ladies make that very

easy... Vivian.

(turning to the desk

clerk)

John, call a limousine for our

guest, please.  Have it take her

anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill

the hotel.

(turning back to Vivian)

See you again sometime soon.

DRIVER

You're sure this is the right

street, ma'am?

VIVIAN

Yes. 1312.  It's a big apartment

building.

LIMO DRIVER

Maybe I should go with you.  This

doesn't look like a good place

for a lady to be alone.

VIVIAN

I'll be okay.  I'm home.  Thank

you.

LANDLORD

Hey, we announce guests here.

You a relative of somebody?

LANDLORD (cont'd)

Viv -- is that you?

VIVIAN

Yeah, it's me.

LANDLORD

You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice

threads.  I gotta find time to

shop.

BELLMAN

Is that everything, sir?

EDWARD

(turning from the

window)

That's everything.

MAID

The lady, she go?

EDWARD

Yes.  She go.

BELLHOP

Do you have a car taking you to

the airport, sir?

EDWARD

Yes.

KIT

So whatta' you going to do in

San Francisco?

VIVIAN

Get a job and probably go back

to school.  Figure out what I'm

gonna be.

KIT

What kind of school?

VIVIAN

School, school.  Regular.  I used

to get pretty good grades in

school, you know.

KIT

So did I.  I made it with the

principal.

(recites)

Study hard And get a "B."  Lift

your dress and an "A" you'll see.

VIVIAN

Want a pair of boots?

KIT

Do I!?  Momma!

VIVIAN

You sure you won't come with me?

KIT

And leave all this?  Not in a

million.

KIT (cont'd)

What time's your bus?

VIVIAN

Couple a hours.

KIT

Yeah.  Well... I gotta split.

Goodbye's make me crazy.

VIVIAN

Cool your jets a second.

(going to her purse)

Here's some money.

KIT

No.  You took care of rent,

that's enough.

VIVIAN

I want to.  For food, got it?

Eat something before the wind

blows you away.

KIT

I'm gonna pay you back next time

I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm

gonna do something real nice for

you some day.

KIT (cont'd)

Shit, I'm gettin' all weepy now.

KIT (cont'd)

Take care of you, okay?  Take

care of you.  Love ya...

KIT

Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a

grilled cheese on white, okay?

KIT

Hey, how you doin'.  You new,

huh?

GIRL

Yeah.  Got a cigarette?

KIT

Sure.

GIRL

Jeez, did the wacko in the suit.

KIT

Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm,

I'll be back.

EDWARD

I'm looking for a girl, Vivian,

young, dark hair, big eyes...?

EDWARD

She's mouthy.  Sort of

difficult...?

PROSTITUTE 1

Ain't seen her, wouldn't know

her.

PROSTITUTE 2

What's wrong with us, man?  Two

for the price a one, what ya say?

EDWARD

(disappointed)

Thank you.  No.

KIT (O.S.)

Edward Harris, as I live and

breathe!

KIT (cont'd)

Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she

said.

KIT (cont'd)

You comin' or not?  I don't got

all day, I got a grilled cheese

waitin'.

VIVIAN

You are really lost this time.

THE END
