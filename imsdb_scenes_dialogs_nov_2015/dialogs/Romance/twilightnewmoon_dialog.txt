BELLA (V.O.)

"These violent delights have violent

ends..."

BELLA (V.O.)

"... And in their triumph die, like

fire and powder..."

BELLA (V.O.)

"... Which, as they kiss, consume..."

BELLA

Edward!

BELLA

Edward!

2.

BELLA

... Gran?

EDWARD (O.S.)

Bella...

BELLA

Stop - she'll see!

BELLA

Oh my God.

3.

EDWARD

Happy birthday.

SMASH TO:

CHARLIE

Happy birthday, Bells.

BELLA

Dad, we agreed, no gifts.

CHARLIE

At least mine's not wrapped.

BELLA

Okay, this is actually kind of great.

Thanks, Dad.

CHARLIE

(re: wrapped gift)

Goes with this one from your mom. We

coordinated - well, she coordinated

me.

CHARLIE

To put your pictures in, record your

senior year -- man, senior year.

How'd you get so old so fast?

BELLA

Not that old.

4.

CHARLIE

I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?

CHARLIE

I was kidding.

BELLA

So not funny, Dad.

BELLA (V.O.)

It was just a dream... but also my

worst nightmare.

MIKE (O.S.)

Wherefore art thou, Bella?

MIKE

You finish the Shakespeare assignment?

JESSICA

He means will you finish his

assignment?

MIKE

No, I don't -- okay I do.

BELLA

I can help you with it -- but first --

(pulling out her camera)

I need a picture. My mom's expecting

a scrapbook full of memories.

ANGELA

(holds up her own camera)

I take `em, I don't pose for `em.

BELLA

You do today.

5.

JESSICA

You'll photoshop my nose if it looks

big, right?

ERIC

Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no

one will be looking at you guys.

MIKE

(dry)

Oh good. Cullen's here.

JESSICA

(drier)

Yay.

ERIC

Check ya later.

EDWARD

Happy birthday.

BELLA

Don't remind me.

EDWARD

Your birth is definitely a day to

celebrate.

BELLA

Not for me.

6.

EDWARD

Eighteen is a little early to be

worrying about your age.

BELLA

It's one year older than you.

EDWARD

Bella, I'm ninety.

BELLA

True. Maybe I should be creeped out

that I'm dating such an old guy.

EDWARD

(smiles, amused)

Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not

the fact that you're dating a vampire.

EDWARD

Class.

BELLA

Right.   Class.

EDWARD

Someone wants you.

JACOB (O.S.)

Bella!

BELLA

God, Jacob, what are they feeding you

on that rez, steroids? You're huge.

JACOB

Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came

around more.

7.

BELLA

I will, soon. But isn't your school,

like, ten miles that way?

JACOB

(re: car part)

Just here buying this for the Rabbit.

I'm almost done with the rebuild.

Gotta come take a ride when it's done.

(as if remembering)

Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad

told my dad. So...

JACOB

I saw it the other day and thought of

you - it catches bad dreams.

BELLA

This, I need. It's great.

EDWARD

The bell's about to ring.

JACOB

Ooh, look at you, all psychic.

EDWARD

I don't have that particular gift.

But I can read a watch. I'm clever

that way.

BELLA

Bye, Jake, and thank you.

EDWARD

How come Jacob Black gets to give you

a gift and I don't?

BELLA

He's just a friend.

8.

EDWARD

"Friends" don't spend two weeks

looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.

BELLA

Stop reading his mind if he bothers

you so much.

EDWARD

Little hard to tune out.

ALICE

Happy --

BELLA

Shh!

ALICE

-- birthday.

BELLA

Alice, didn't I say no gifts?

ALICE

You did. I didn't. I've already seen

you open it and guess what? You love

it.

BELLA

You had a vision about my birthday.

ALICE

And about the green dress you'll be

wearing to your party tonight. Great

color on you.

BELLA

... My party?

9.

ALICE

Please?     It'll be fun.

BELLA

(beat, confused)

I... guess I can deal --

ALICE

(hurriedly)

-- Great! See ya at seven!

BELLA

Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood

control.

EDWARD

Vampires.    You can't trust them.

CUT TO:

ROMEO

Arms, take your last embrace, and

lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal

with a righteous kiss...

ROMEO

Here's to my love!

(drinks)

O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.

BELLA

I hate being... celebrated.

10.

EDWARD

Come on, the last real birthday any of

us had was Emmett's - I think Bing

Crosby was on top of the charts.

(then)

You'll be helping us feel normal for a

night.

EDWARD

There are worse tragedies than a

birthday. Look at Romeo. He's

responsible for his wife's death. Who

could live with that?

(looks at the screen)

... Though I do envy him one thing.

BELLA

(blanches slightly)

Juliet's alright... if you like that

obviously beautiful sort of thing.

EDWARD

Not the girl - the suicide.

(off her look)

Nearly impossible for my kind. But

humans, a little poison, dagger to the

heart. There are so many options.

BELLA

(appalled)

Why would you even think about that?

EDWARD

(shrugs)

I considered it. Once.      When James

had you trapped.

EDWARD

I didn't know if I'd find you in time.

If I'd gotten you killed --

BELLA

It wouldn't have been your fault --

11.

EDWARD

Either way, I had a plan.

BELLA

What plan?

EDWARD

There are... ways for us. At least

one way. I would have gone to Italy,

provoked the Volturi...

BELLA

The who?

MR. BERTY

Is there something you'd like to share

with the class, Edward?

EDWARD

(politely)

Certainly not. But I apologize for

being a distraction. Perhaps you

should rewind to act five, scene one,

line twenty-eight eighty-nine --

(reciting)

"If you had the strength of twenty men

it would dispatch you straight."

MR. BERTY

Eyes on the screen, people.

EDWARD (O.S.)

The Volturi are a very old, very

powerful family...

EDWARD (O.S.)

The closest thing my world has to

royalty...

12.

EDWARD

Francesco Solimena painted this; he

often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

BELLA

Is that... Carlisle?

EDWARD

Yes. He lived with them for a few

decades. He describes them as very

refined - for killers.

EDWARD (V.O.)

The Volturi are also what you might

call enforcers.

BELLA (V.O.)

Of what?

EDWARD (V.O.)

The only rule they have: to keep

secret the existence of our kind.

13.

EDWARD (V.O.)

We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

or kill conspicuously, unless we want

to die.

BELLA

Don't even -- talk about that. You

can't let anyone hurt you. The

Volturi or anyone else.

EDWARD

(sees she's worried)

Who else would hurt me?

BELLA

You said there were more dangerous

things out there than you. And I know

you have at least one enemy --

BELLA (O.S.)

You said she'd come after you for

killing her mate.

EDWARD

Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice

will see her coming. And she won't win.

BELLA

I hate that I can't protect you.

14.

BELLA

That was me being serious.

EDWARD

(kissing her face)

I know. But you do protect me...

(kisses her nose)

From boredom...

(kisses her lips)

And loneliness...

(in between kisses)

You give me a reason to stay... un-

dead. But it's... my job; to protect

you...

EDWARD

... from everyone but my sister.

ALICE

It's time it's time it's time!

CARLISLE

Sorry about all this.   We tried to

rein Alice in.

ESME

Like that's even possible.   Happy

birthday, Bella.

ALICE

(re: camera)

Found it in your bag.   Mind?

15.

EMMETT

Dating an older woman.    Hot.

EMMETT

What?

ROSALIE

It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

ALICE

(aims the camera)

Show me the love!

ALICE

For your scrapbook.    Now open your

presents!

BELLA

Alice, I'm the only one who even eats

cake. That thing could feed fifty.

ALICE

Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's

from Emmett.

BELLA

Um... thanks?

EMMETT

Already installed it in your truck.

EDWARD

Finally, a decent sound system in that

piece of --

16.

BELLA

No hating on the truck.     Thank you,

Emmett.

ALICE

Open mine.

BELLA

Ouch - paper cut.

ALICE

(soothingly)

Jaz... shhh --

17.

CARLISLE

Emmett, get Jasper out of here.

(no response)

Emmett.

ALICE

I'm sorry, I... can't...

CARLISLE

I'll have to stitch this up.

EDWARD

I'll carry her to the kitchen.

CARLISLE

I'll take care of her, Edward.

(Edward doesn't move)

Check on Jasper. Go.

BELLA

I sure can kill a party.

CARLISLE

It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't

been away from human blood as long as

the rest of us.

BELLA

Seems like you're the only one it

doesn't effect.

CARLISLE

Centuries of practice.

18.

BELLA

Did you ever think of... living

differently?

CARLISLE

I enjoy   my work too much. Helping

people,   saving lives. I'm hoping

there's   a point to my existence, even

if I am   damned.

BELLA

Damned?    You're not damned.

CARLISLE

Then you and I agree. But Edward

doesn't believe there's an afterlife

for our kind.

(looking at her)

He thinks we've lost our souls.

BELLA

(realizing)

That's why he won't... He thinks he'd

be damning me.

CARLISLE (CONT'D)

If you believed as he did, would you

risk it?

BELLA

Say something.

EDWARD

What do you want me to say?

BELLA

That I'm a klutz. That I should have

been more careful --

EDWARD

You got a paper cut. Normal people

get paper cuts. And a normal

boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into

a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend

wouldn't have had to fight the urge to

kill you --

19.

BELLA

Stop.   I don't want normal, I want

you.

BELLA

You can't protect me from everything -

something's going to separate us --

accident, illness, old age... as long

as I'm human...

EDWARD

(appalled)

That's your solution?   My ending your

life?

BELLA

Your giving me forever.

BELLA

Carlisle told me how you feel, about

my soul, but I don't believe that --

EDWARD

You should go in. It's late.

BELLA

I'll leave my window open for you.

EDWARD

(quietly)

I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.

BELLA

Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's

still my birthday.

(off his nod)

Kiss me?

20.

BELLA

Edward.   You're here.

EDWARD

Walk with me?

21.

EDWARD

We need to leave Forks.

BELLA

What?   Why?

EDWARD

It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be

ten years older than he looks; people

will start noticing.

BELLA

But... when?

EDWARD

Now.

BELLA

I'll have to think of something to

tell Charlie, but I can be ready --

EDWARD

Not you.   Us.

BELLA

(stunned)

What? -- no -- Edward, what happened

with Jasper - that was nothing.

EDWARD

Nothing compared to what could happen.

You don't belong in my world.

BELLA

-- I belong with you --

EDWARD

-- You don't --

BELLA

-- I'm coming --

EDWARD

I don't want you to come!

22.

BELLA

You don't... want me.

EDWARD

No.

EDWARD

I'd like to ask one favor though.

BELLA

(looks up, hopeful)

Anything.

EDWARD

Don't do anything stupid or reckless --

do you understand?

(adding)

... for Charlie's sake. Just... take

care of yourself.

BELLA

I... yes... I will.

EDWARD

Don't worry. You're human. Time

heals all wounds for your kind.

Particularly if you're not reminded.

BELLA

No, this is - don't do this.     Please.

EDWARD

Try to understand. Every second with

you is about restraint. You're too

fragile. I'm tired of pretending to

be something I'm not. Reining myself

in so I can be with a human.

BELLA

Then take my soul. I don't care!        I

don't want it without you --

23.

EDWARD

(sharply)

-- You're not good for me, Bella.

EDWARD

I've let it go on too long.     I'm

sorry.

EDWARD

I promise, it will be like I never

existed. Goodbye, Bella.

BELLA

-- Wait --

BELLA

Edward?!

24.

EDWARD (O.S.)

Move, Bella.

CHARLIE

I'll call the Cullens again. Her note

said she and Edward went for a walk.

BILLY

They left town, Charlie.

HARRY CLEARWATER

Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job

somewhere else.

HARRY CLEARWATER

We'll find her, Charlie.

JACOB

Charlie!

25.

BILLY

It's Sam Uley. He found her.

CHARLIE

Thank you, Sam. Thank God.

CHARLIE

What were you thinking, Baby?   Why

were you out there?

BELLA

He's... gone.

26.

BELLA (V.O.)

Dear Mom... I'm...

(beat)

... lost...

BELLA (V.O.)

Edward took everything with him.

Including my life. He promised it

would be like he never existed...

BELLA (V.O.)

... But I need to know he did.

27.

BELLA (V.O.)

It's like a huge hole has been punched

through my chest...

BELLA (V.O.)

But the pain is my only reminder that

he was real... that they all were...

BELLA (V.O.)

I miss them. Especially Alice...

BELLA (V.O.)

But I'm sure it's better for them, not

having me around...

CARLISLE

No.   We promised Edward.

ALICE

But she won't do well without us. I get

flashes of her, but they're unclear --

ROSALIE

Forget her, let's drag Edward home.

ESME

He'll come back when he's ready.

After Bella moves on.

28.

CARLISLE

Yes. When she's living her life, safe

from danger --

JASPER

(with self-contempt)

You mean safe from us.

ROSALIE

(pointedly to Alice)

And when will that be?

EMMETT

Can you see him, Alice?

ALICE

The only decision he's made...

SMASH TO:

ALICE (O.S.)

... is to be alone...

SMASH BACK TO:

BELLA (V.O.)

Time passes. Every tick that goes

by... aches...

29.

BELLA (V.O.)

Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

It's about time you got rid of those,

Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared

on the highway.

BOB

Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the

garbage truck hauls `em off, you and

my wife can rest easy.

(starts off, but stops)

Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear

problem? Folks are saying they're

huge.

CHARLIE

(distracted)

That's just... talk...

BOB

How you doin' there, Bella?

30.

CHARLIE

That's it.

BELLA

That's what?

CHARLIE

You're going to Jacksonville to live

with your mother.

BELLA

What?   Why?

CHARLIE

I just - don't know what to do any

more. You don't act like someone left

you; more like someone died.

BELLA

I'm not leaving Forks.

CHARLIE

Bells, the bastard's not coming back.

CHARLIE

It's not normal, this behavior. And

frankly, it's scaring the hell outta

me, and your mother.

(gentler)

Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some

new friends.

BELLA

I like my old friends.

CHARLIE

You never even see them anymore.

BELLA

I do, too. In fact, I'm... um...

Jessica and I are going to Port

Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.

31.

CHARLIE

(suspicious)

You hate shopping.

BELLA

That's how good a friend I am.

CHARLIE

(somewhat appeased)

Alright. Shopping.

BELLA (PRE-LAP)

Hi Jessica, it's Bella...

BELLA

... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance

you feel like shopping tomorrow?

BELLA

I don't get why are there so many

zombie movies.

JESSICA

It's, like, a metaphor? For crass

consumerism or something.

JESSICA

Not that you'd know anything about

consuming. You didn't buy anything

today.

BELLA

I bought something.

JESSICA

Socks don't count. `Course, I was

surprised you even called.

BELLA

I've been kind of... out of it.

32.

JESSICA

Kind of? I mean, at first I was

worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's

still bumming? It's not like I wasn't

going through things, too. Like Mike

deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"

That was really hard and --

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

How `bout a ride, girls?

EDWARD (O.S.)

Move, Bella.

JESSICA

Come on.

BELLA

I know them... I think...

JESSICA

Can we just go --

BELLA

I want to see something.

33.

GUY #1

Alright, we got a taker.

EDWARD

Turn around, Bella.     This is

dangerous.

EDWARD

Stop.   Now.

BELLA

... You're not them.

GUY #1

We'll be whoever you want, honey.

GUY #2

Ready for a thrill ride?

EDWARD (O.S.)

Walk away.     Go.

BELLA

I can break promises, too.

GUY #2

(confused)

... Okay.

34.

JESSICA

Bella!

BELLA

... Wait

BELLA

Stop - stop! - STOP!

GUY #2

Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.

JESSICA

What the hell is wrong with you?!

BELLA

(almost to herself)

I... saw something.

JESSICA

You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.

BELLA

(trying to figure it out)

The more dangerous... the more real it

was.

JESSICA

So, what, you're like an adrenaline

junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie-

jumping. Don't be a complete freak.

35.

BELLA (V.O.)

He wasn't real. I knew that. I

didn't care. I needed to see him. If

danger's what it took, that's what I'd

find.

JACOB

Bella!

JACOB

`Bout time you came by.

BELLA

I brought you something.

JACOB

Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

BELLA

I rescued them from the dump. They'd

cost more than they're worth to fix...

unless one had a mechanic-type friend.

JACOB

Me, being the mechanic-type friend?

(off her shrug)

Since when are you into motorcycles?

BELLA

Recently.

JACOB

(studying the bikes)

The parts alone will be pricey.

BELLA

I have a college fund I can dig into.

36.

JACOB

Charlie's gonna love that.

BELLA

Charlie won't know.

JACOB

Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through

college money. Repairing dangerous

machines - that I'm guessing you'll

want to ride?

BELLA

I really get it if you think this is

stupid and reckless.

JACOB

Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.

(leans closer, grins)

When do we start?

SMASH TO:

TIM

We're going the wrong way.

NATE

Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.

37.

TIM

(slapping a mosquito)

And the West Nile virus.

TIM

You hear that?

NATE

If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd

have brought my grandma.

TIM

Could be one of those giant bears.

NATE

There are no giant --

TIM

What the hell is that?!

NATE

I don't know!

TIM

Think it's gone?

TIM

Nate?   Nate!?

38.

DISSOLVE TO:

BELLA

If we're going to be working on this

every day, we should probably include

some homework. Don't want the Dads to

think I'm a bad influence on you.

JACOB

You influence me?     Please.

BELLA

I am older than you.

JACOB

Age ain't nothin' but a number.

BELLA

And I convinced you to secretly build

us two-wheeled death machines.

JACOB

(sudden mock-horror)

God, you're right, you're like Satan --

QUIL (O.S.)

Yo, Jake, you in there?

JACOB

It's cool, it's just my boys.

EMBRY

Hey, Jake --

39.

JACOB

Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's

Quil and Embry.

QUIL

So the bike building story is true.

BELLA

Taught him everything he knows.

QUIL

What about the part where you're his

girlfriend?

BELLA

Oh, we're just friends.

EMBRY

Ooh.    Burn.

JACOB

(scrambling)

I said she's a girl and a friend.

QUIL

Embry, you remember him making that

distinction?

EMBRY

Nope.

BELLA

So I guess you guys have girlfriends.

JACOB

(laughs loudly)

Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.

QUIL

Yeah, that's still a riot. You want

funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

EMBRY

I got five bucks on Quil.

40.

BELLA

You're on.

BELLA (V.O.)

I never forgot my reason for doing

what I was doing...

BELLA (V.O.)

But being with Jacob was a bigger perk

than I expected...

JACOB

Quil keeps asking to come over. I

think he likes you a little too much.

BELLA

Tell him I'm not into the cougar

thing.

JACOB

What is it with you and age? I mean,

that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem

to... bother you.

BELLA (V.O.)

Not even Jacob could keep away the

nightmares...

41.

BELLA (V.O.)

... the terror, the loneliness.

CHARLIE

You're alright, Bells.   You're okay.

CHARLIE

This thing's not working very well.

BELLA

It's... not as bad as it was.

CHARLIE

Yeah right.

(beat)

I know what it's like, you know. When

your mom left me. I had a hell of a

time. Imagined doing all kinds of

crazy things, just to stop the pain.

CHARLIE

But hanging out with Jacob seems to

help get your mind off... things.

BELLA

He's been keeping me afloat.

CHARLIE

That's good. He's a good guy.

42.

JACOB

We got lucky at the dump. You know

how much a new crankshaft goes for?

BELLA

Sure, I spend all my free time on

crankshaft-dot-com.

JACOB

I think that's a porn site.

(then)

These bikes are gonna be rolling soon.

Where should we ride first?

BELLA

Someplace sunny.

JACOB

Like there's any place sunny around

here.

BELLA

I know a place above the cloud line --

JACOB (O.S.)

Where is it?

BELLA

Actually, it's... too hard to get to.

JACOB

So we'll find our sunny spot, right?

43.

BELLA

Isn't that... Sam Uley?

JACOB

(bitter)

And his cult.

BELLA

Oh my God!   Stop them! --

JACOB

They're not really fighting, Bella.

They're cliff diving.

BELLA

What, on purpose?

JACOB

Scary as hell, but a total rush.

JACOB

Most of us jump from lower down.

BELLA

Think I could?

JACOB

Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?

BELLA

You said it was a rush.

44.

JACOB

Maybe on a warmer day. And not from

the top. We'll leave the showing off

to Sam and his disciples.

BELLA

You don't like them.

JACOB

They think they run this place.   Acting

all bad ass, calling themselves

"protectors."

BELLA

What are they protecting?

JACOB

The tribe, the land, their right to be

jerks. Embry used to call them hall

monitors on steroids; now look at him.

BELLA

That's Embry? I didn't recognize him.

What happened to him?

JACOB

He missed some school - then, out of

nowhere, he's following Sam around.

Same thing happened with Paul and

Jared. They weren't even friends, now

Sam owns them.

(beat)

Sam keeps giving me this look, like

he's waiting for me or something; it's

kinda freaking me out.

BELLA

Maybe you should just avoid them.

JACOB

I try but...

BELLA

Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my

Dad.   Or you can come stay with us.

45.

JACOB

Thanks.

(beat, holding her)

If this is how you're going to react,

I'll freak out more often.

JESSICA

I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.

ANGELA

It's going around. My sister was so

sick she couldn't come on our hike

this weekend... so she didn't see it.

ERIC

(sotto)

Ang, maybe you should keep that to

yourself --

ANGELA

We saw something, Eric.

ERIC

I believe you.

JESSICA

No he doesn't. He's just trying to

get lucky.

ERIC

(suddenly hopeful)

Is that an option?

ANGELA

(ignoring him)

It was jet black and huge; on all

fours it was still taller than a

person. A bear maybe.

46.

JESSICA

Or Big Foot.

MIKE

Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get

probed.

ANGELA

(quietly)

... We saw it.

BELLA

You're not the only one.

BELLA

My dad's been getting reports at the

sheriff's station. A couple hikers

went missing. People are scared.

MIKE

I did hear some guy talking about it

at the store.

ERIC

Last time you clowns doubt my

girlfriend.

CUT TO:

JACOB

You look scared.

BELLA

I'm not.

47.

JACOB

Brake?

(she taps it)

Clutch?

(she squeezes it)

Right. Gas?

(she grips it)

You ready?

JACOB

Slowly... release the clutch.

EDWARD (O.S.)

Stop.

JACOB

You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?

BELLA

I'm going again.

JACOB

I'm not sure that's a good --

JACOB

Guess we're going again. Now what are

you going to do with the clutch?

BELLA

Release it.    Slowly.

48.

BELLA

(yelling to Jacob)

I don't -- how do I turn!?

JACOB

Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

JACOB

What, are you training for the X-games?

BELLA

I want to go again.

JACOB

Forget it. I'm revoking your

motorcycle privileges. Man, look at

your head.

BELLA

God, I'm sorry.

JACOB

You're apologizing for bleeding?

BELLA

It doesn't... bother you?

JACOB

It's just blood, Bella.

49.

JACOB

What are you staring at?

BELLA

Just, you're actually... good looking.

JACOB

How hard did you hit your head?

BELLA

(realizing)

Oh I - yeah.

BELLA

Jake, you're hot.

JACOB

Upgraded from good looking?

BELLA

No, temperature hot.

(feels his forehead)

You're burning up.

JACOB

I feel fine.

JACOB

What?   I can't hold your hand?

BELLA

It just... means something else to you

than it does to me.

JACOB

One, that's my problem. But two... we

have fun, you think I'm hot --

BELLA

Good looking.

JACOB

I know you like me.

50.

BELLA

More than anyone.    But... that's all.

JACOB

Because of Cullen?

JACOB

Look, I know what he did to you. I

can see it in your face every time his

name comes up. But you need to know -

I would never, ever do that to you. I

promise I will never hurt you. You

can count on me.

BELLA

I already do. You don't know how

much. You're my best friend but... I

don't think my feelings will change.

BELLA

I'm sorry. I should've said something

right from the start --

JACOB

No. That's not -- I just feel...

weird.

BELLA

I told you, you have a fever.

Probably that flu everyone has.

JACOB

It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't

know what it is.

BELLA (O.S.)

Hey Jake. Just checking to see how

you're doing. And to say I'm sorry,

about, you know... how I feel and...

hope the flu passes fast. Call me.

51.

BELLA (O.S.)

Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono.

He won't let me visit but... would you

call me?

BELLA (O.S.)

Me again.   I just... need to hear your

voice...

BELLA

Jacob.   Please. Call me.

CHARLIE

Harry and I will be back by three --

CHARLIE

It's mono, Bells.

BELLA

He's too sick to even call?

CHARLIE

You just gotta wait it out.

(then)

You know, I don't have to go fishing...

BELLA

(forcing a smile)

No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.

52.

CHARLIE

Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No

hikes or anything. We're issuing a

warning about those bears.

BELLA (V.O.)

I was more afraid of the hole in my

chest than I was of bears. Without

Jacob, I needed Edward more than

ever...

BELLA (V.O.)

... I needed to know he existed.

There was only one place I might find

him, or the feeling of him...

53.

BELLA

Laurent?

LAURENT

Bella.

BELLA

Laurent!

LAURENT

I must admit, I didn't expect to find

you here.

BELLA

I live here. But you - I thought you

were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.

LAURENT

Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to

arrange, given my association with

James and Victoria, "The Enemy."

BELLA

You tried to help us.

LAURENT

I went to visit the Cullens, but their

house is empty. I'm surprised they

left you behind. Weren't you sort of

a pet of theirs?

BELLA

Um... something like that.

LAURENT

Do the Cullens visit often?

EDWARD

Lie.

BELLA

Absolutely.    All the time.

54.

EDWARD

Lie better.

BELLA

I'll tell them you stopped by.

BELLA

Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?

LAURENT

I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian"

family was pleasant enough. But the

dietary restrictions were difficult -

living on nothing but animals.

LAURENT

(conspiratorial)

Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel

compelled to... cheat?

LAURENT

But that's not why I left. I came

back here as a favor to Victoria.

BELLA

... You're still friends.

LAURENT

(shrugs)

More or less. She asked me to get the

lay of the land with the Cullens.

Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria

is quite put out with you.

BELLA

That's... too bad.

LAURENT

Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill

Edward's mate, given he killed hers.

Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.

55.

EDWARD

Threaten him.

BELLA

Edward will know who did it.   He'll

come after both of you.

LAURENT

I don't think he will. After all, how

much could you mean to him if he left

you here unprotected?

(then)

Victoria sent me here for information.

She won't be happy about my killing

you.

BELLA

No, Laurent...

LAURENT

(sincere)

No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm

doing you a kindness. Victoria plans

on killing you slowly, painfully -

whereas I'll make it very quick.

(inhaling)

And you smell so... mouth watering.

BELLA

(whispering, barely

audible)

Edward. I love you.

LAURENT

I... don't believe it.

56.

EDWARD

Don't.   Move.

CHARLIE

Bella?   What's wrong?

57.

BELLA

They're not giant bears -- I saw them.

Up in a meadow --

CHARLIE

Damn it, I told you not to go into the

woods!

HARRY CLEARWATER

What did you see, Bella?

BELLA

Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad.

BELLA

Five of them. The size of - of cars.

I swear. They went after -- something -

- and I ran.

CHARLIE

Harry, can you get some men from the rez?

HARRY CLEARWATER

Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --

CHARLIE

(into phone)

Jerry? Put a hunting party together --

tranq guns, large caliber shotguns --

there's something dangerous out there.

BELLA (V.O.)

Something dangerous. Victoria.

BELLA (V.O.)

If she came after me, Charlie would

try to protect me -- and he'd die.

CHARLIE

I've gotta go to the station.

BELLA

Good! -- That's good.

58.

CHARLIE

You okay here? You want to come with?

BELLA

Actually, I -- need to see a friend.

BELLA

Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --

BILLY

He's out with friends.

BELLA

(taken aback)

Oh.

BILLY

I'll let him know you came by.

BELLA

Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's

what you told my dad.

BILLY

(with compassion)

You should go on home, Bella.

59.

BELLA

You cut your hair.

JACOB

Go away.

BELLA

What happened to you?

BELLA

(lowers her voice)

I can help.

BELLA

Sam got to you. What did he do?

JACOB

Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.

BELLA

Then who?

JACOB

(bitterness seething)

How `bout those filthy, reeking

bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.

BELLA

(thrown)

I... don't know what you're --

JACOB

You know exactly what I'm talking

about.

60.

BELLA

The Cullens are long gone.    How are

they to blame?

JACOB

They started all this by existing.

Goddamn leeches --

SAM

Jacob.

JACOB

I can't be friends with you anymore.

BELLA

Jake, I know I hurt you. I should

have been more up-front but -- I

needed you, I still do. I don't know

what that means yet, but if you give

me time --

JACOB

Stop.    Don't. It's not you --

BELLA

-- "It's not you, it's me?"     God.

JACOB

It's true.   I'm not... good.

BELLA

You're wrong --

JACOB

It doesn't matter.    This is over --

BELLA

I can't take losing my best friend, too.

JACOB

You already have --

BELLA

Don't say that -- you promised --

JACOB

Go home, Bella. Don't come back.

61.

CHARLIE

Billy called, said you and Jacob had a

fight. But, hey, you guys will work

it out, I'm sure of it.

BELLA

I'm... going to change.

SMASH TO:

BELLA

Why!?

JACOB (O.S.)

(whisper shouting)

Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.

62.

BELLA

What the hell are you doing?

JACOB

Get out of the way.

BELLA

No!

JACOB

I pictured your room more...

cluttered.

BELLA

Why are you here?

JACOB

I had to talk to you.   Alone.

BELLA

To kick me in the gut again? It was

bad before, but you made it so much

worse.

JACOB

I know. And I want to explain.

But... I can't.

BELLA

Then leave.

BELLA

You're done with me, remember?   Get.

Out!

63.

JACOB

Bella, I literally can't explain...

JACOB

I broke my promise not to hurt you, I

know. But I'm trying to keep it now.

I need you to understand... even if

you don't want to see me when you find

out --

BELLA

Find what out?

BELLA

What's wrong?

JACOB

I can't do it.

BELLA

Yes, you can. I'll help you. We

can... we can leave. Leave home,

leave Sam.

JACOB

It's not something I can run away

from.

(then)

I would run with you though. If I

could.

(beat, realizing)

Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you.

You know this -- you can guess.

BELLA

I don't want to play games with you --

JACOB

You have to! I can't tell you, but if

you remember - it was that day I ran

into you at the beach. I told you a

story -- come on! I told you a

story... about?

BELLA

... about... "The Cold Ones?" You

said it was a stupid tribal myth.

64.

JACOB

(pointedly)

Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?

JACOB

What else did I say?

BELLA

That... the tribe made a treaty with

them. They can't come onto your land

and... I don't know, I don't remember.

JACOB

Try, Bella.

BELLA

You have to give me more. Tell me

where to look. Is there something I

should see -- ?

JACOB

No, that's too dangerous --

BELLA

I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me.

JACOB

Where was the last place you saw me...

the way I used to be?

BELLA

The motorcycles - that clearing in the

woods.

BELLA

Don't go. There are dangerous things

out there; more than you know.

65.

BELLA (V.O.)

If I was going to lose someone else, I

needed to know why.

PAUL

What the hell have you done?!

JACOB

I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I

did.

PAUL

She's here, isn't she?

SAM

Bella, there's nothing to see here.

You should go home.

BELLA

Not until I know what you did to Jacob.

PAUL

(advancing on Bella)

What we did?!

SAM

Both of you, calm down --

JACOB

Sam, she knows things about the

bloodsuckers. She's been on the

inside. She can help --

PAUL

Like a leech lover's gonna help us.

66.

JACOB

Watch what you call her.

EMBRY

Get a grip, guys --

BELLA

It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --

PAUL

All you care about is her --

SAM

(commanding)

Paul, back off.

PAUL

-- and she doesn't give a crap about

you --

SAM

Jacob.

JARED

Too late.

SAM

Bella, get back!

BELLA

Run, Jacob! --

BELLA

Jake, no!   Stop -- !

67.

SAM

Take Bella to Emily's place.

EMBRY

Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

EMBRY

(to Jared)

Pay up. She didn't puke.

EMBRY

Told you she was tough.     She does run

with bloodsuckers.

BELLA

Wait. We should go back, make sure

Jacob's okay.

JARED

I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.

Serve him right.

68.

EMBRY

No way. Jake's a natural. You see

him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver

says Paul doesn't touch him.

JARED

Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer.

EMBRY

Come on in.    We won't bite.

JARED

Speak for yourself.

EMBRY

Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance -

just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.

BELLA

Why would I stare? --

EMILY

You guys hungry? Like I have to ask...

EMILY

Who's this?

JARED

Bella Swan.    Who else?

EMILY

So you're the vampire girl.

69.

BELLA

And you're a... you're all...

EMILY

Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one.

But these animals --

(slaps Embry's hand)

Save some for your brothers.

EMILY

Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's

gag order.

BELLA

He didn't say anything, or...

couldn't.

EMBRY

That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders

get obeyed whether we want to or not --

JARED

How `bout you shut up now, Embry?

EMBRY

You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.

JARED

Yeah, I know every stupid thought he

has.

(to Bella)

Wanna know what he thinks of you?

EMILY

Like you need special powers to know

that.

EMBRY

(to Bella)

It's another wolf thing. We hear each

other's thoughts. Good for hunting.

Embarrassing for everything else.

JARED

Freaking out yet?

70.

BELLA

(meets his look)

You're not the first -- mind reader

I've met.

EMBRY

(grins)

Jake's right. You are good with the

weird.

BELLA

But I don't get -- how?   Why? --

SAM (O.S.)

-- Because there are bad things here.

SAM

And they're getting worse.

SAM

Hey, Em.

EMBRY

Ha!   Pay up.

BELLA

You just have to... stop.

71.

JACOB

It's not a life-style choice.   It's in

my DNA.

BELLA

Killing is in your DNA?

JACOB

Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be

such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the

right kind of monster for you? Can't

measure up to your bloodsucking

friends --

BELLA

(angry as well)

Hey, they manage to survive without

hurting innocent people.

JACOB

Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't

care that I morph into a giant dog.

Just that I... kill people?

BELLA

(appalled)

"Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that

little to you?

BELLA

(repelled, turns to go)

Oh my God.

JACOB

Bella -- Bella wait...

(he stops her)

We're not killing hikers.   We're

trying to protect them.

BELLA

From what?

JACOB

The only thing we do kill: Vampires.

BELLA

(stunned, reels)

Vampires? Jake, no --

72.

JACOB

(steps back, bitter)

Don't worry, we can't touch your

precious Cullens - unless they bite

someone and violate the Treaty --

BELLA

That's not what I -- you can't fight

vampires. They're too dangerous.

JACOB

Please. We took out that leech with

the dreads easy enough.

BELLA

You... killed Laurent?

JACOB

(worried)

... He didn't seem like a friend.

BELLA

No, God no.    But... how?

JACOB

It's what we do, why we exist. A few

"lucky guys" in the tribe have the

gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town,

our DNA kicks in, we reach the right

age and the fever hits --

BELLA

(realizing)

"Mono."

JACOB

I wish. Next thing I know, they're

telling me, this is your life now. That

future you saw for yourself? Gone.

BELLA

It's bad, huh?

JACOB

I just hate feeling... out of control.

Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't

be around me.

BELLA

Like you could get rid of me.

73.

JACOB

You've seen Emily.

JACOB

Sam lost it for a split second; Em was

standing too close -- he's still messed

up about it.

(beat)

I don't want to be that kind of

nightmare.

BELLA

You're not like that. You save

people, right? You saved me from

Laurent.

JACOB

Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His

red-headed girlfriend will be fun,

too.

BELLA

Victoria.     She's here?

JACOB

We chased her all the way to the

border the other night. But she won't

stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we

knew what she was after...

(sees Bella's face)

... What?

BELLA

I know what she wants.      Me.

SMASH TO:

74.

VICTORIA

James hated cars. He liked being

close to the ground. But I'd steal

one occasionally, to throw him off the

scent... See, we played hide and seek

sometimes. No one can hide like me --

(grins to her passenger)

-- but no one could seek like James.

DENISE

What -- what are you -- ?

VICTORIA

Some games   lasted months... but we

always got   hungry for each other.

(sly,   to Denise)

So I'd let   him find me...

DENISE

Michael?    Oh my God --

VICTORIA

We never could get enough of each

other...

(seething)

We would have had forever to try.

DENISE

Michael?!

VICTORIA

James always loved a screamer.

SMASH TO:

75.

JARED

Excellent. If the redhead's after

Bella, we've got bait.

JACOB

She is not bait.

BELLA

I should leave town.

SAM

Victoria will follow you and make it

harder for us to catch her.

BELLA

No one can catch her.   She can escape

anything.

PAUL

Ooh.   She has special powers.

BELLA

Some of them do.

JACOB

Like... what? Bella?

JARED

The mind reader you said you knew. He

was a suckhead? Can they all do that?

EMBRY

That would blow.

BELLA

No, I -- shouldn't have - no.

PAUL

She's still protecting them.

76.

JARED

I don't know why. It's not like they

stuck around to protect you --

JACOB

Guys, back off.

JACOB

Don't worry, we've got this place

covered. She won't get near you or

Charlie.

JACOB

Hey, we should do something fun.

Like... cliff diving, right?

BELLA

I could use the rush.

JACOB

Soon.   After we catch her.

BELLA

You're here.

77.

EMILY

Bella.   Are you okay?

BELLA

Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He

wasn't at home...

SAM

He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an

eye on things. I'm heading out soon.

Should I tell him something?

EMILY

You want to come in?

CHARLIE

You got something, Harry?

78.

HARRY CLEARWATER

Nope, nothin'.

79.

SMASH TO:

EDWARD (O.S.)

Step back.

EDWARD

Stop this now, Bella.

BELLA

You won't stay with me any other way.

BELLA

Yes!

80.

SMASH TO:

JACOB

Breathe, Bella! C'mon!

JACOB

Bella?   Can you hear me?

BELLA

... Jake?

SAM

She'll be alright.

JACOB

What the hell were you thinking?

BELLA

I needed... to see... something.

81.

JACOB

What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't

heard you scream --

SAM

Get her home. I'm heading to the

hospital. I'll meet you there.

JACOB

Why would you jump? Didn't you notice

it's like a hurricane out here?

BELLA

I know. It was stupid --

(realizing)

-- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?

JACOB

Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

BELLA

Oh my God - does my Dad know?

JACOB

He and my dad are both over there.

BELLA

Will Harry be okay?

JACOB

I don't know. Come on. I'll find you

something dry and drive you home.

JACOB

Hundred and eight degrees over here.

BELLA

Must be nice, never getting cold.

82.

JACOB

It's a wolf thing.

BELLA

It's a Jacob thing.   You're just...

warm.

JACOB

(grins)

Like the sun.

BELLA

(meaning it)

Like the sun.

JACOB

Which always comes back.   You can

count on me.

JACOB

There are other cool things about all

this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see

me stab my hand?

BELLA

(no!)

Yeah, `cause that would be fun.

BELLA

So... this wolf thing's not all bad?

JACOB

It's better. Now that you know.

But...

BELLA

... but...

JACOB

It just... comes so easily to me.

More than the other guys.

BELLA

That's a good thing, isn't it?

83.

JACOB

Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...

human than the others.

(beat, quieter)

Sometimes I'm scared I might...

disappear, you know? Who I really am.

BELLA

I won't let that happen.

BELLA

Thanks for driving - for everything.

JACOB

Holy crap -- !

JACOB

There's a bloodsucker out there.

BELLA

How do you know?

JACOB

I can smell the stink.   I'm getting

you out of here.

BELLA

Stop!   It's not Victoria --

JACOB

Forget it --

BELLA

It's Carlisle's car!   They're here.

Go back! --

84.

JACOB

It's a trick --

JACOB

Damn it, Bella --

JACOB

Stop.   You gotta come with me.

BELLA

It's okay.   They're my friends --

JACOB

Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back

here, this is their territory. The Treaty

says we can only defend our own lands.

BELLA

-- It's not a war --

JACOB

It is. And you'll only be safe in La

Push. I can't protect you here anymore.

BELLA

I don't need you to --

JACOB

-- You're about to cross a line --

BELLA

Only if you draw one.

JACOB

I'm not letting you do this.

BELLA

You don't have a choice.   I don't

belong to you.

85.

JACOB

Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.

BELLA

Alice!

ALICE

You're... alive.

BELLA

Oh my God, Alice.    You're here.

ALICE

I heard voices - I didn't think it was

you but - you're alive.

BELLA

You keep saying that.

ALICE

I saw you - a vision of you - you

jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too

late but --

(becoming angry)

Why the hell would you try to kill

yourself?!

BELLA

I didn't.    I was cliff diving.

ALICE

Why?!

BELLA

Um... fun?

ALICE

That was fun for you.

86.

BELLA

Until I hit the water.

ALICE

I have never met anyone more prone to

life-threatening idiocy... and what is

that hideous wet dog smell?

BELLA

Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a

werewolf.

BELLA

Werewolves are not vicious.

ALICE

Until they lose their tempers.

BELLA

They saved me from Laurent, they're

protecting me from Victoria --

ALICE

(shocked)

Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't

see you get pulled from the water

either.

BELLA

It was Jacob who saved me. More than

once. I couldn't have made it without

him. You have no idea what it was

like.

ALICE

(softening)

Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't

be good for you. I tried to tell

Edward, but he wouldn't listen.

BELLA

(hesitantly)

... Does he know you're here?

ALICE

No.   He's been... away...

87.

EDWARD

What?

ROSALIE (O.S.)

Wow, Edward finally answered the

phone. I feel so honored...

EDWARD

I'm hanging up now...

ROSALIE

Wait!... You should come home.

(no response)

Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.

Even Emmett's depressed. You've

really done a number on them.

EDWARD

(pained)

I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't

be happier with me around. Trust me.

ROSALIE

I... I just miss... us.   The family.

EDWARD

I know. But the further away I am,

the safer Bella will be. She deserves

a shot at a normal life --

88.

ROSALIE

But see, you don't have to worry about

that, not anymore --

EDWARD

Why, Rose?   Did something happen?

ROSALIE

I - uh --

EDWARD

Tell me, Rosalie.

(rises, fierce)

Tell me! --

ROSALIE

(blurts)

-- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella -

- throw herself off a cliff... She's

dead, Edward.

EDWARD

I... don't believe it.

ROSALIE

Alice is there now. Thought she could

help with the funeral or something.

ROSALIE

Come home, Edward. It's time...

Edward...?

CHARLIE

Thanks for understanding, Bells. They

wanted to keep the service small.

BELLA

Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna

be okay?

89.

CHARLIE

Yeah... but Sue, and those kids --

Leah's only a year older than you.

And Seth's, what, fourteen...

CHARLIE

There'll be a reception after. I

might stay late, see if I can help.

ALICE

You're not going?

BELLA

I'm not the most popular person on the

werewolf rez right now.

ALICE

(saddened)

Because you're friends with me.

ALICE

Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't

see him pull you out of the water -

maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.

BELLA

-- Alice.

ALICE

(jogging off)

I'll go do some hunting.

BELLA

Quil... you, too?

QUIL

(aggressive)

Yeah. Me, too.

90.

JACOB

You alone?

BELLA

Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?

JACOB

Had to talk to you first.

(to the guys)

I'll meet you there. Go on.

BELLA

Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --

JACOB

This place stinks to hell.

BELLA

You're welcome to leave.      In fact --

JACOB

-- How many Cullens are here and how

long are they staying?

BELLA

(snapping back)

Just Alice. And she'll stay as long

as she wants.

JACOB

Are the rest coming back?

BELLA

Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?

JACOB

That's it.

BELLA

Better go report to Sam.

91.

JACOB

I've done it again. I keep breaking

my promise not to hurt you.

BELLA

It doesn't have to be this way.

JACOB

Yeah, it does.

BELLA

Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?

JACOB

It was easier when we were both human,

wasn't it?

JACOB

Swan residence.

JACOB

He's not here. He's at a funeral...

JACOB

Filthy bloodsucker.

92.

BELLA

Wait, who was it?

JACOB

(spitting it out)

Dr. Carlisle Cullen.

BELLA

You should have let me talk to him.

JACOB

He didn't ask for you --

JACOB

Step away from me, Bella.

BELLA

Alice, what's wrong?

ALICE

... Edward.

BELLA

What about him? What happened?

ALICE

I just saw him in a vision.   He...

thinks you're dead.

BELLA

(realizing)

That was him calling, not Carlisle.

ALICE

Bella, he's going to Italy... to the

Volturi...

SMASH TO:

93.

JACOB

Why do you have to go?

BELLA

He won't believe Alice.    He has to see

that I'm alive.

JACOB

(stops her)

He left you, Bella. He didn't want

you anymore, remember?

BELLA

But I still love him, and I'm not gonna

let him kill himself out of guilt.

JACOB

What about your dad?

BELLA

I'm eighteen, legally free to go.

I'll leave a note.

ALICE

Got the airline tickets.

JACOB

(squaring off with Alice)

You Cullens might hunt animals but

those monsters in Italy don't.

ALICE

I'm well aware what the Volturi are.

JACOB

Then why are you taking Bella to them

like a bottle of wine to a party?

ALICE

Right, she's better off here with

Victoria stalking her. The one you

dogs can't seem to catch?

BELLA

Let's go.

94.

JACOB

Please, Bella. Stay here.   For

Charlie... for me.

BELLA

Bye, Jacob.

ALICE

Maybe Jacob's right.

(Bella tries to

interrupt)

No. You need to realize - the Volturi

could easily see me as Edward's

accomplice. And you're a human who

knows too much and tastes too good.

They could kill us all.

95.

EDWARD

Have you decided?

ARO

It was an intriguing debate.     We don't

get many suicidal vampires.

CAIUS

Pathetic.

ARO

I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable

to destroy. But if you're unhappy

with your lot, join us. We'd be

delighted to utilize your skills.

EDWARD

So you won't end this.

MARCUS

Not without cause.

ARO

Such a waste.

BELLA

Where'd you get the car?

ALICE

Hope you're not opposed to grand theft

auto.

BELLA

Not today.

96.

BELLA

How much time do we have.

ALICE (O.S.)

He's waiting till noon, when the sun's

at its highest...

SMASH TO:

ALICE

... He's going to make the Volturi

change their minds.

BELLA

(checking her watch)

It's almost noon now.

ALICE

There's Volterra.

BELLA

Why are they all wearing red?

97.

ALICE

San Marcos Day festival. The perfect

setting. Large crowds. The Volturi

won't let him get far enough to reveal

himself - he's counting on that.

BELLA

We only have five minutes --

BELLA

Where's the square?

ALICE

Follow that lane --

ALICE

He'll be under the clock tower!

ITALIAN MAN

Fare attenzione!

98.

BELLA

Edward! --

BELLA

No, Edward!    Don't!

EDWARD

Carlisle was right... heaven...

BELLA

No, I'm here. I'm alive.

EDWARD

(confused)

You're... not real.

BELLA

Look at me!    Alice was wrong.

99.

EDWARD

Bella?

BELLA

Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --

EDWARD

You're here.

BELLA

I'm here.

EDWARD

I won't be needing your services after

all, gentlemen.

FELIX

Aro wants to speak with you again.

EDWARD

No rules were broken.

DEMETRI

We should take this conversation to a

more appropriate venue.

EDWARD

Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and

enjoy the festival?

FELIX

The girl comes with us.

EDWARD

That's not going to happen --

100.

ALICE

Come on, guys, it's a festival.

ALICE

We wouldn't want to make a scene.

FELIX

There won't be any scene.    And we'll

still win.

EDWARD

But not easily --

JANE (O.S.)

Enough.

EDWARD

(nodding to her)

Jane.

BELLA

(sotto to Alice)

Who is she?

ALICE

(sotto to Bella)

Just do as she says.

JANE

Follow me.

101.

EDWARD

It's alright. Alice will catch you.

SMASH TO:

GIANNA

Buon pomeriggio.

102.

ARO

What a happy surprise! Bella is alive

after all. Isn't that wonderful?

ARO

Her blood appeals to you so much it

makes me thirsty. How can you stand

to be so close to her?

EDWARD

It's not without effort.

ARO

(laughing)

I can see that.

EDWARD

One touch and Aro can see every

thought I've ever had in my life.

ARO

You're quite the telepath yourself,

Edward. Though... you can't read

Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.

ARO

I would love to see if you are an

exception to my gifts, as well.

ARO

Interesting.

103.

ARO

I wonder if --

EDWARD

(reading Aro's thoughts)

No!

ARO

Let's see if she's immune to all our

powers, shall we Jane?

BELLA

Stop!

ARO

Jane, dear.    The girl?

ARO

Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So

what do we do with you now?

MARCUS

(seemingly bored)

You already know what you'll do, Aro.

CAIUS

She knows too much; she's a liability.

ARO

That's true. Unless Edward intends to

give her immortality...

(looks at Edward)

But that's not your intention, is it.

Shame.

104.

BELLA

Edward, don't!

BELLA

(to Aro)

Stop this! Please!

BELLA

Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them

alone!

ARO

Enough.

EDWARD

Get away from her -- !

105.

ALICE

Edward, stop. I've already seen it.

EDWARD

(through gritted teeth)

Alice, stay out of it.

ALICE

I know what to do.

ARO

Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your

gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it

you've seen?

EDWARD

... don't...

ALICE

I'm the one who will change Bella.

ARO

(beat, then gestures)

Please. Be my guest.

ALICE

Not here. Her father is in law

enforcement. If she goes missing,

there will be questions.

CAIUS

He is easily dealt with.

ALICE

It will happen, Aro.   See for

yourself.

SMASH TO:

SMASH BACK TO:

106.

ARO

Mesmerizing! To see the things you've

seen, that haven't happened yet!

ALICE

I'm so sorry.

ARO

(to Bella)

Your gifts will make for an intriguing

immortal. Go make your preparations.

CAIUS

You're letting them leave?

ARO

Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance

will be conspicuous at best. And

surely you see her potential.

MARCUS

(dispassionately)

Let us be done with this.    Heidi will

arrive any moment.

CAIUS

We will make sure she follows through.

I would not delay. We do not offer

second chances.

107.

DEMETRI

(sotto)

Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.

HEIDI

(to the group)

This way, please. Stay together...

TOURIST HUSBAND

Unusual tour, isn't it?

TOURIST WIFE

Bill, get a picture of that bust there.

SMASH TO:

BELLA

-- Stop!

BELLA

It... wasn't a dream.

EDWARD

Go back to sleep. You've been through

a lot.

108.

BELLA

No, you might --

EDWARD

I'll be here when you wake up.

BELLA

Why?   Out of guilt?

EDWARD

(realizing)

You... think I asked the Volturi to

kill me because I felt guilty?

BELLA

Didn't you?

EDWARD

I went to them because I thought I'd

lost you.

BELLA

You didn't even want me.

EDWARD

Bella. The only reason I left was to

protect you. I wanted you to have a

chance at a normal, happy life.

BELLA

But it was so easy for you to leave.

EDWARD

I had to be convincing. But easy?     In

my hundred years, I've never had a

harder time than what I just went

through.

BELLA

I kept seeing you. Visions of you.

Always protecting me. I thought I was

going crazy.

EDWARD

Your own instincts were speaking to

you. I wish it had been me. But

you're the heroic one. You saved me.

109.

CHARLIE

You alright? Another nightmare?

BELLA

I'm okay.    You don't have to worry.

CHARLIE

Last time you said that, you

disappeared. You want to talk

nightmares?

BELLA

(sincere)

I'm really sorry, Dad.

CHARLIE

Just... don't ever do that to me

again. Okay?

(off her nod)

And you're grounded for the rest of

your life.

BELLA

I know.

CHARLIE

Get some rest so I can keep lecturing

you in the morning.

EDWARD

He won't forgive me easily.

BELLA

Nope.

EDWARD

Will you? I don't deserve it but... I

hope you will. Because I honestly

have no idea how to live without you.

BELLA

You won't be able to get rid of me

once Alice changes me.

110.

EDWARD

She won't have to. There are ways to

keep the Volturi in the dark.

BELLA

(pulling away)

They'll come after your whole family.

You'd risk that just to keep me human?

EDWARD

Just? You really don't understand

what you'd be giving up.

BELLA

I really do.

BELLA

You're not the only one with a say in it.

BELLA

You all know what Edward wants. And

you know what I want. But I won't

force myself on you...

BELLA

I think the only fair way to handle

this is by vote --

EDWARD

You can't be serious --

BELLA

(firmly)

This is my meeting, Edward.

BELLA

However this turns out, I'm not

letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go

back to Italy alone --

111.

EMMETT

The hell you will.   I'm not missing

another fight.

BELLA

That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I

don't want you involved.

ESME

We've always been involved, honey, and

we're not going to stop --

BELLA

No, please -- I want you to seriously

think about this. If I join you,

you'll be stuck with me for a long

time - forever. It's a huge decision.

And I want - I need your honesty here.

BELLA

Then let's take a vote... Alice?

ALICE

Like you're not already my sister.     Of

course, yes!

JASPER

I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to

want to kill you.

BELLA

Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?

ROSALIE

Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I

really am. And I know you're not

ready to forgive me...

(to Bella)

But this isn't the life I'd have

chosen for myself. I wish there'd

been someone to vote no for me...

(she exchanges a glance

with Carlisle - then...)

So... no.

112.

EMMETT

I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight

with these Volturi some other way.

ESME

I already think of you as part of the

family. Yes.

BELLA

Thank you, Esme.

CARLISLE

Edward --

EDWARD

You can't go along with this,

Carlisle, you know what it means.

CARLISLE

You've chosen not to live without her,

which leaves me no choice. I won't

lose my son.

(turns to Bella)

But Alice has never turned anyone.

It'd be safer if I did it --

BELLA

Thank you.    Thank you all.

SMASH TO:

VICTORIA

Where you headed?

113.

DRIVER

Seattle.

VICTORIA

(a slow grin)

Sounds perfect.

EDWARD

When?

BELLA

After graduation.

EDWARD

Just two months.

BELLA

It'll be best for Dad that way. I can

pretend to be at college somewhere.

Carlisle suggested it. But...

(quiet, emotional)

I wish you'd be the one to change me.

EDWARD

(beat)

Would you be willing to trade for that?

BELLA

(hopeful)

Name it.

EDWARD

Five more years as a human.

BELLA

The Volturi won't wait that long.

EDWARD

I'll settle for three.

BELLA

(sadly, shakes her head)

I won't risk it. It'll have to be

Carlisle.

114.

EDWARD

Why are you so willing to give up your

soul?

BELLA

Because I don't believe you've lost

yours. And I want to share mine with

you forever.

BELLA

What is he doing?

EDWARD

He wants to talk to me.

BELLA

Well, he can talk to me first.

JACOB

You're still alive.

BELLA

I've been calling you.

JACOB

Couldn't drop by?

EDWARD

He thinks I'm keeping you away.

JACOB

(spinning on him)

Stay the hell out of my head!

BELLA

Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying

to get back before he wakes up.

115.

EDWARD

Jacob, I know you have something to

say to me, but I'd like to say

something first. Alright?

EDWARD

(sincere)

Thank you. For keeping Bella alive

when I... didn't.

JACOB

No, you didn't. And it wasn't for

your benefit, trust me.

EDWARD

I know. I'm still grateful.

(then)

But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving

Bella's side till she orders me away.

JACOB

We'll see.

EDWARD

Either way, we'll handle Victoria from

here on out.

JACOB

She's been laying low. Ever since

your freaky sister showed up. Guess

she can't stand you Cullens either.

EDWARD

She'll come back.

JACOB

She does, she's ours.   She killed on

our turf.

EDWARD

We'll see.

JACOB

My turn to talk. I'm here to remind

you about a key point in the Treaty.

116.

EDWARD

(reads his thoughts, nods)

I haven't forgotten.

JACOB

Good.

BELLA

What?   What key point?

JACOB

If any of them bites a human, the

truce is over. That's bite, not kill.

BELLA

(realizing)

But... if I choose it, it's none of

your business.

JACOB

If you... what!? No.      No way.   I

won't let you --

EDWARD

-- Bella, step back --

JACOB

You're not gonna be one of them.

BELLA

That's not your call --

JACOB

(even more intense)

You know what we'll do to you - I

won't have a choice --

EDWARD

We're done here --

JACOB

You don't speak for her!

117.

BELLA

Stop!

EDWARD

(to Bella)

Get out of here. Now!

BELLA

(to both of them)

You do this, you'll be going through me.

BELLA

I swear to God, I'm not moving.

BELLA

(turning to Edward)

Give me a second. Please.

BELLA

Read his thoughts.   Is he going to

hurt me?

BELLA

Jacob, I love you. You're my best

friend. But... I can't change how I

feel. Please don't make me choose.

(quietly, emotionally)

Because it'll be him. It's always

been him.

118.

BELLA

But you know how important you are to --

BELLA (V.O.)

There were problems ahead.     Seemingly

insurmountable...

BELLA (V.O.)

... If I didn't become a vampire, the

Volturi would kill me. If I did, my

best friend would do the job himself,

or get killed in the attempt.

BELLA (V.O.)

Victoria was still on the loose,

putting everyone I loved in danger...

BELLA (V.O.)

But I'd already survived the worst --

losing Edward. So I knew I could

survive anything...

EDWARD

I'm here.   Always.

BELLA (V.O.)

And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face

our fate together. Forever.

FADE TO BLACK:

THE END
