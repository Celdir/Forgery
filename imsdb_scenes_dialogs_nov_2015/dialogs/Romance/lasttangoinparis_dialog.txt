PAUL

(ENGLISH)

FUCKING GOD!!!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

2.

JEANNE

A phone token, please.

BARTENDER

No tokens. At the end, on the left.

JEANNE

Thank you.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found

a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going

to see it.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Then I've got to go to the station

to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see

you later. Bye!

CUT TO:

JEANNE

I've come to see the flat. I saw

the sign.

CONCIERGE

The sign?

3.

JEANNE

Yes.

CONCIERGE

It's always the same! Nobody ever

tells me anything.

JEANNE

I'd like to see it.

CONCIERGE

You want to rent it?

JEANNE

I don't know yet!

CONCIERGE

They rent, they leave and I'm the

last to know. Do you think that's

right?

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

If you want to go up alone--

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

Go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The

key is missing. Strange things

happen.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

They drink six bottles a day.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

Wait! Don't go! There must be a

duplicate.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

Here it is.

4.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

You must be very young.

JEANNE

Let go of me!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

She's crazy!

CUT TO:

JEANNE

Who are you?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

You gave me a fright.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

How did you get in?

5.

PAUL

(BARELY AUDIBLE)

Through the door.

JEANNE

Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't

hear you come in.

PAUL

I was already here.

JEANNE

Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I

had to bribe the concierge. These

old houses are fascinating.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

An armchair by the fireplace would

look good.

PAUL

The armchair should go in front of

the window.

JEANNE

Are you American? You've got an

American accent.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Are you going to take it? Are you?

PAUL

I don't know.

6.

JEANNE

What are you doing?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

(PERTURBED)

Oh la la. Should I answer It or

not? Oh...

DINING ROOM

JEANNE'S VOICE

Hello? Hello --

PAUL

(to the caller)

Hello -- Hello. There's no-one

here. There's no-one. I don't know.

JEANNE

So you're going to take it? You've

decided?

PAUL

I had already decided. But I'm not

sure now. Do you like it?

7.

JEANNE

I don't know. I shall have to think

about it.

PAUL

Think fast.

JEANNE

I thought you'd left.

PAUL

Ah... Oh, God.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh, Jesus... Oh... Oh, Christ.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh, God.

CUT TO:

8.

CUT TO:

TOM

Watch out!

JEANNE

Have they taken us for someone

else?

TOM

We're in a film.

TOM (CONT'D)

We're in a film. If I kiss you...

TOM (CONT'D)

... it might be cinema. If I stroke

your hair, it might be cinema.

JEANNE

What's going on? Do you know them?

9.

TOM

It's a long story. In short,

Portrait of a Girl. It's been

accepted for television! And the

girl is you. It's you!

JEANNE

You're mad! You might have asked me

first.

TOM

Yeah, but I wanted...

TOM (CONT'D)

I wanted to start with shots of

Jeanne at the station meeting her

fiance. Yes, I know them. They're

my crew.

JEANNE

So you kissed me, and you knew it

was being filmed. You're a bastard!

Traitor!

TOM

No, you'll see. It will be a love

story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling.

What did you do while I was away?

JEANNE

I thought of you day and night, and

I cried. Darling, I can't live

without you!

TOM

Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!

CUT TO:

10.

CATHERINE

I'd have finished by now, but the

police wouldn't let me touch

anything. They didn't believe it

was suicide.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

There was so much blood everywhere.

They had fun making me do a

reconstruction. "She went there."

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

"She came through here."

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

"She opened the curtain."

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

I copied all her actions. The

guests were awake all night! The

hotel was crawling with cops! They

enjoy playing around with blood.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

They were all spies! Asking if she

was sad, if she was happy, if you

fought, how long you'd been

married, why you didn't have any

children. Pigs!

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

They got familiar right away! They

said, "Your boss is a bit

unstable." "Do you know that he was

a boxer?" So?

(MORE)

11.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

"It didn't work out, so he became

an actor." "Bongo player,

revolutionary in South America,

journalist in Japan."

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

One day, he lands in Tahiti, hangs

around, Learns French." "Then he

comes to Paris. There... he meets a

woman with money, marries her

and... "Since then what has your

boss done?" "Nothing."

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

I say, "Can I clean up now?" "No!

Don't touch anything!" "Do you

really think she killed herself?"

He pushed me into a corner and

tried to paw me...

PAUL

Turn the tap off now.

CATHERINE

They'll be doing the autopsy right

now.

PAUL

Why won't you turn the tap off?

CATHERINE

They told me to give you your razor

back.

PAUL

It's not mine.

12.

CATHERINE

They said they don't need it any

more. The investigation is over.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

Yes, she had cuts there...

CATHERINE (CONT'D)

... and on the neck, too...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOVER

Excuse me, where shall I put this?

JEANNE

You could have rung the bell.

13.

MOVER

The door was open. I'll put it

there.

JEANNE

In front of the fireplace.

MOVER 2

Careful, madame.

JEANNE

There.

MOVER

What about the table?

JEANNE

How do I know? He'll decide.

MOVER 2

This is a king-size.

JEANNE

It won't fit!

MOVER

Well, your husband has no idea. All

this in an hour... It's not long.

JEANNE

What a mess!

MOVER

Thank you.

14.

MOVER 2

Thank you.

PAUL

The armchair goes in front of the

window.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Like that.

JEANNE

But I only came to return the key.

To return it to you.

PAUL

I don't care about the key. Take

your coat off.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Take your coat off and help me.

JEANNE

OK.

PAUL

Get those chairs and bring them

here.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Put them on the other side. Take

that, too. That's it.

JEANNE

You didn't waste any time...

15.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Listen monsieur! I've got to go.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Look, sir! I've got to go!

PAUL

The bed is too big for the room.

JEANNE

I don't know what to call you.

PAUL

I don't have a name.

JEANNE

Do you want to know mine?

PAUL

No, no! I don't. I don't want to

know your name.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You don't have a name and I don't

have a name either. Not one name.

JEANNE

You're crazy!

PAUL

Maybe I am, but I don't want to

know anything about you. I don't

wanna know where you live or where

you come from. I wanna know

nothing, nothing, nothing...

JEANNE

You scare me.

16.

PAUL

You and I are gonna meet here

without knowing anything that goes

on outside here.

PAUL (CONT'D)

OK?

JEANNE

But why?

PAUL

Because... Because we don't need

names here. Don't you see? We're

gonna forget... everything that we

knew. Every... All the people,...

all that we do,... wherever we

live. We're going to forget that,

everything, everything.

JEANNE

But I can't. Can you?

PAUL

I don't know. Are you scared?

JEANNE

No.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Come?

CUT TO:

17.

ROSA'S MOTHER

I thought you'd be here.

PAUL

I expected you later.

ROSA'S MOTHER

I took the first train.

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful,

Paul!

MOMENTS LATER

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Papa is in bed with asthma. The

doctor wouldn't let him come. It's

better like that. I'm stronger.

PAUL

What are you looking for?

ROSA'S MOTHER

Something that would explain... A

letter, a clue.

PAUL

Nothing. I told you, there's

nothing, nothing at all.

ROSA'S MOTHER

My little Rosa wouldn't have...

Nothing for her mother. Not a word.

18.

PAUL

It's useless to keep on searching.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Not even for you, her husband!

PAUL

You need to rest. I think room

12 is free.

GUEST

Hi.

ROSA'S MOTHER

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

With a razor?

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

What time did it happen?

PAUL

I don't know. In the evening.

ROSA'S MOTHER

And then?

PAUL

Then I... I already told you on the

phone... When I found her, I called

the ambulance.

19.

ROSA'S MOTHER

After you called, Papa and I stayed

up all night, talking about Rosa

and you. Papa kept whispering, as

if it had happened in our house.

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Paul!

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Where did it happen?

PAUL

In one of the rooms.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Did she suffer?

PAUL

Ask the Doctors. They're doing the

autopsy.

ROSA'S MOTHER

The autopsy.

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

I already had some announcement

cards. I've seen a lot of death. I

think of everything. I'll prepare

her a beautiful room with flowers.

20.

PAUL

The cards, clothes, relatives,

flowers. You've got everything in

that suitcase. You didn't forget

anything. But I don't want any

priests here.

ROSA'S MOTHER

But...

PAUL

No priests.

ROSA'S MOTHER

But Paul...

PAUL

Understand?

ROSA'S MOTHER

We have to. Funerals must be

religious.

PAUL

No!!!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Rosa didn't believe! Nobody

believes in the fucking God here!

ROSA'S MOTHER

Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like

that.

PAUL

The priest doesn't want any

suicides. The Church doesn't want

any suicides, do they?

ROSA'S MOTHER

They'll give her absolution.

PAUL

Heh!?

21.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Absolution and a nice mass. That's

all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my

little girl, do you understand?

Rosa... Why did she kill herself?

PAUL

Why? Why did she commit suicide?

Why?

PAUL (CONT'D)

You don't know? You don't know.

CUT TO:

22.

LATER

PAUL

OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just

look at each other.

JEANNE

It's beautiful without knowing

anything.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Maybe... Maybe we can come without

touching.

PAUL

Come without touching? OK.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Are you concentrating? Did you come

yet?

JEANNE

No. It's difficult!

PAUL

I didn't either yet. You're not

trying hard enough.

JEANNE

I shall have to invent a name for

you.

PAUL

A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God,

I've been called by a million names

all my life. I don't want a name.

I'm better off with a grunt or a

groan for a name. Do you wanna hear

my name?

23.

JEANNE

It's so masculine.

PAUL

Yeah.

JEANNE

Listen to mine.

PAUL

I didn't get the last name.

CUT TO:

TOM

You shouldn't have done that to me.

JEANNE

It's not a wig, it's my hair.

Doesn't it suit me? Tell me, don't

you like it? Tell me.

24.

TOM

Of course I like it. Listen, you

know... I don't know. You have

changed, and yet you haven't. I can

see the shot now.

TOM (CONT'D)

The camera is up high. It descends

slowly and follows you. You come

forward, and it moves in on you.

There's music, too. It gets closer

and closer to you.

JEANNE

I'm in a hurry. Let's start.

TOM

But... can't we talk a little

first?

JEANNE

Tonight we improvise. You follow.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

He was my childhood friend. He used

to watch me for hours and hours. I

think he understood me.

OLYMPIA'S VOICE

Dogs are worth more than people.

Much more.

JEANNE

Meet Olympia, my nanny.

OLYMPIA

Mustapha could always tell the poor

from the rich.

(MORE)

25.

OLYMPIA (CONT'D)

If someone well-dressed came in, he

never stirred. But if someone

scruffy came in, you should have

seen him! What a dog!

The colonel trained him to

recognise Arabs by their scent.

JEANNE

Olympia, open the front door.

OLYMPIA

Give me a kiss.

JEANNE

Go and open it.

(TO TOM)

Olympia is a compendium of domestic

virtues. Faithful, admiring, and

racist.

JEANNE'S VOICE

After Papa died, we moved back to

the family home for a while. My

childhood was made up of smells.

Musty smells, the smell of walls

and rooms.

Children used to come and play in

my jungle, all day long. Growing

old is a crime.

CUT TO:

JEANNE

That's me there. And that's

Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher.

She was very strict... and very

religious.

26.

OLYMPIA

She was too good. She spoilt you.

JEANNE

That's Christine...

JEANNE (CONT'D)

...my best friend. She married the

pharmacist and has two children.

It's like a village here. We all

know each other.

OLYMPIA

I couldn't live in Paris.

JEANNE

We're safe here. It's odd looking

at the past.

TOM

Cut!

TOM (CONT'D)

Why is it odd? It's you! It's

fantastic, it's your childhood.

It's everything I was looking for.

TOM (CONT'D)

What are you up to? Move it! Move

it!

(to the lead crewman)

Who are these zombies who are

always following you around?

(to all of them)

Scoot! Go on! The door, the door...

27.

TOM (CONT'D)

I'm opening the door. I'm opening

all the doors.

JEANNE

What are you doing?

TOM

Setting up my shot. There it is!

That's it! I've found it. Reverse

gear!

TOM (CONT'D)

What are you doing there? Beat it!

TOM (CONT'D)

That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do

you see? Like a car, you go into

reverse gear. That's it. Close your

eyes.

TOM (CONT'D)

Start reversing. Close your eyes.

That's it, come on. Come on

backwards. That's it. Go back to

your childhood.

JEANNE

Papa?

TOM

You're soaring. Take off and return

to your childhood.

JEANNE

In full uniform.

28.

TOM

Don't be afraid. Overcome the

obstacles.

JEANNE

Papa in Algeria.

TOM

You're...

TOM (CONT'D)

15...14...12...13...11...10...9...

TOM (CONT'D)

We're there.

JEANNE

My favorite route when I was eight.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

My old notebook.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

French homework. Theme: the

countryside. Exposition: the

countryside is cow country. The cow

is all dressed in leather. The cow

has four sides: the front, the

back, the top and the bottom. Isn't

that good?

TOM

Beastly.

JEANNE

Here are my cultural sources. Le

Grand Larousse.

(MORE)

29.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

I just copied from it.

Menstruation. Noun. Physiological

function comprising the discharge

of menses. Penis. Noun. Male

copulation organ, measuring five to

forty centimeters. That's Le Petit

Robert.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Tom! Tom! Tom! Look!

TOM

Who's that?

JEANNE

My first love.

TOM

Who?

JEANNE

My cousin Paul. My first love.

TOM

But his eyes are closed.

JEANNE

What?

TOM

His eyes are closed!

JEANNE

He played the piano divinely.

That's how I remember him...

CUT TO:

JEANNE'S VOICE

Sitting at the piano... His fingers

would skim the keys.

30.

JEANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

He played for hours and hours. At

the bottom of the garden, there

were two big trees. A plane tree

and a chestnut tree. After mass on

Sundays, we used to sit there, each

under our own tree. It was

wonderful. We sat gazing into each

other's eyes.

JEANNE

Aren't my trees beautiful? They

were my jungle.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

KID 1

Having a shit.

KID 2

No, we're doing a poo.

JEANNE

Shame on you, doing it in my

jungle!

KID 1

Watch out!

KID 2

Run for it!

OLYMPIA

Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go

and shit in your own country!

31.

TOM

Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't

stop, whatever you do!

JEANNE

Did you get it?

TOM

Everything.

JEANNE

Olympia was great. It'll give a

good idea of race relations in the

suburbs of Paris.

TOM

It's a real jungle here. So, tell

me about your father.

JEANNE

I thought we'd finished.

TOM

Five minutes.

JEANNE

I'm meeting someone for work.

TOM

But the colonel... the colonel!

CUT TO:

JEANNE

The colonel had green eyes and

shiny boots. I worshipped him. He

was so handsome in his uniform.

32.

PAUL'S VOICE

What a steaming pile of horseshit.

JEANNE

What?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

What? Don't...

PAUL

All uniforms are bullshit.

Everything outside this place is

bullshit. Besides, I don't want to

hear about your stories, about your

past, and all that.

JEANNE

He died in Algeria in 58...

PAUL

Or 68 or 28 or 98...

JEANNE

58, and don't joke about things

like that.

PAUL

Listen, why don't you stop talking

about things that don't matter

here? What the hell's the

difference?

JEANNE

OK.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

So what do I have to say? What do I

have to do!?

33.

PAUL

Come on the good ship...

(SINGS)

Lollipop...

JEANNE'S VOICE

Why don't you go back in America?

PAUL

I don't know. Bad memories, I

guess.

JEANNE

Of what?

PAUL

Oh... My father was a... a drunk.

Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter.

Super-masculine. And he was tough.

My mother was very... Very poetic.

And also a drunk. And... one of my

memories, when I was a kid, was of

her being arrested nude. We lived

in this small town. Farming

community. We lived on a farm.

And I'd come home after school and

she'd be gone. In jail... or

something. And... I used to... I

used to have to milk a cow every

morning and every night and I liked

that. I remember...

PAUL (CONT'D)

One time I was all dressed up to go

out and take this girl to a

basketball game. And I started to

go out and my father said, "You

have to milk the cow." I said,

"Would you please milk it for me?"

And he said, "No, get your ass out

there." So I went out and I was in

a hurry and didn't have time to

change my shoes. And I had cow shit

all over my shoes. And on the way

to the basketball game, it smelled

in the car. I don't know. I-I can't

remember very many good things.

34.

JEANNE'S VOICE

Not one?

PAUL

Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a

very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,

and worked real hard. I used to

work in a ditch, draining land for

farming. And he wore overalls and

he smoked a clay pipe. Half the

time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.

And I hated the work. It was hot

and dirty and... it broke my back.

And... all day long I'd watch his

spit which would run down the pipe

stem and hang on the bowl of the

pipe. And I used to make bets with

myself on when it was going to fall

off. And I always lost. I never saw

it fall off. I'd just look around

and it'd be gone and then the new

one would be there. And then we had

a beautiful... My mother... My

mother taught me to love nature.

And... I guess that was the most

she could do. And... we had... In

front of our house we had this big

field... meadow. It was a mustard

field in the summer and we had a

big black dog named Dutchy. And she

used to hunt for rabbits in that

field but she couldn't see them. So

she'd have to leap up in this

mustard field and look around very

quickly to see where the rabbits

were. And it was... very beautiful.

And she never caught the rabbits.

JEANNE

You have been had!

PAUL

Oh really?

JEANNE

I don't wanna know anything about

your past, baby!

PAUL

You think I was telling you the

truth?

35.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Maybe... Maybe...

JEANNE

I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're

the wolf.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

What strong arms you have!

PAUL

The better to squeeze a fart out of

you!

JEANNE

What long nails you have!

PAUL

The better to scratch your ass

with.

JEANNE

Oh, what a lot of fur you have!

PAUL

The better to let your crabs hide

in.

JEANNE

Ooh, what a long tongue you have!

PAUL

The better to... to stick in your

rear, my dear.

36.

JEANNE

What's this for?

PAUL

That's your happiness and my... my

ha-penis.

JEANNE

Peanuts?

PAUL

Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte.

Prick! Joint!

JEANNE

It's funny. It's like playing grown-

ups when you're little. I feel like

a child again here.

PAUL

Did you have fun as a kid?

JEANNE

It's the most beautiful thing.

PAUL

It's beautiful to be made into a

tattletale or forced to admire

authority or sell yourself for a

piece of candy.

JEANNE

I wasn't like that.

PAUL

No?

JEANNE

I was writing poems. I was drawing

castles,... big castles with tower.

A lot of tower.

PAUL

Did you ever think about sex?

37.

JEANNE

No. No sex.

PAUL

"No. No sex."

JEANNE

Tower.

PAUL

You were probably in love with your

teacher.

JEANNE

My teacher was a woman.

PAUL

And she was a lesbian.

JEANNE

How did you know?

PAUL

That's classical... Anyway...

JEANNE

My first love was my cousin Paul.

PAUL

No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid

if you keep telling me names. No

names. I don't mind if you tell

the truth, but don't give me the

names.

JEANNE

Sorry. Sorry.

PAUL

Well, go on. Tell the truth. What

else?

JEANNE

I was ... He was dark, very thin. I

can see him. Big nose! A big

romance. I fell in love with him

when I heard him playing piano.

38.

PAUL

You mean when he first got into

your knickers.

JEANNE

He was a child prodigy. He was

playing with both hands.

PAUL

I'll bet he was... Probably getting

his kicks.

JEANNE

We were dying of heat.

PAUL

Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?

JEANNE

In the afternoon, when the grown-

ups were napping...

PAUL

You started grabbing his joint.

JEANNE

You're crazy!

PAUL

Well, he touched you.

JEANNE

I never let him! Never!

PAUL

Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire,

nose as long as a telephone wire.

JEANNE

No, I'm not.

PAUL

Look me straight in the face and

say, "He didn't touch me once."

Huh?

JEANNE

He touched me, but the way he did

it.

39.

PAUL

Aha! The way he did it. OK, what

did he do?

JEANNE

Behind the house, there were two

trees. A plane tree and a chestnut.

I sat under the plane tree and he

sat under the chestnut. And one,

two, three... We each began to

masturbate. The first who came...

won!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Why aren't you listening to me?

PAUL

When did you first come? How old

were you?

JEANNE

The first time? I was really late

for school. I started running and

it was downhill. All of a sudden,

I felt a strong sensation here.

So I ran and ran and I came as I

ran. The faster I ran, the better

it was and the more I came. A

couple of days later, I tried to do

it again, but no luck.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Why aren't you listening to me?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Why do I feel like I'm talking to a

brick wall when I talk to you? Your

solitude weighs on me. It isn't

indulgent. It isn't generous. You

are selfish!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

I can be by myself, too, you know!

40.

DINING ROOM

LIVING ROOM

DINING ROOM

CUT TO:

ROSA'S MOTHER

I can't sleep with this music.

PAUL

I came to this hotel a long time

ago, to spend one night. And I

stayed for five years.

ROSA'S MOTHER

When Papa and I had the hotel,

people came here to sleep.

PAUL

Now, there's all sorts. They can

hide, take drugs, play music.

41.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Take your hand away.

ROSA'S MOTHER

You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.

ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

You're crazy! I'm starting to

understand.

PAUL

Do you want me to make them shut

up? OK. I'll make them shut up.

ROSA'S MOTHER

What are you doing, Paul? I'm

afraid!

PAUL

What's the matter, Mother? Are you

upset? Don't be. There's nothing to

be upset about. It takes so little

to make them afraid. I'll tell you

what they're afraid of.

PAUL (CONT'D)

They're afraid of the dark. Imagine

that! Come on, Mother. Meet my

friends.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Put the light on!

42.

PAUL

You should meet a few clients of

the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you

to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is

Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr

Saxophone, he's... He's our

connection, Mom. He gives us some

hard stuff once in a while. And

right here is the beautiful Miss

Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a

few points when she takes her teeth

out.

ROSA'S MOTHER

The light, Paul.

PAUL

Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh!

You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's

afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing.

All right, sweetheart. I'll take

care of you. I'll give you a little

light. I'll give you a little

light. Don't you worry about a

thing.

HOTEL ENTRANCE

MARCEL

Good evening, madame.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Good evening.

PAUL

Good evening, Marcel.

MARCEL

Goodnight, Paul.

43.

ROSA'S MOTHER

Who's that?

PAUL

Do you like him? He was Rosa's

lover.

CUT TO:

JEANNE

What am I doing in this apartment

with you? Love?

PAUL

Well... Let's say we're just taking

a flying... a flying fuck at a

rolling doughnut.

JEANNE

So you think I'm a wore.

PAUL

I think you're a what? A what? A

wore?

JEANNE

A wore.

PAUL

You mean whore.

JEANNE

Yes, a whore. Whore.

44.

PAUL

No, you're just a good old

fashioned girl... trying to get

along.

JEANNE

I prefer to be a whore.

PAUL

Why were you going through my

pockets?

JEANNE

To find out OOH you are.

PAUL

To find out OOH you are.

JEANNE

Yes.

PAUL

Well, if you look real close,

you'll see me hiding behind my

zipper.

JEANNE

Well, we know that he buys clothes

in some big store. That's not much.

But it's a beginning.

PAUL

That's not a beginning, that's a

finish.

JEANNE

Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old

are you?

PAUL

I'll be 93 this weekend.

JEANNE

Oh, you don't look it.

PAUL

Thank you.

45.

JEANNE

Have you been in college?

PAUL

Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the

University of Congo. Studied whale-

fucking.

JEANNE

Wow!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Barbers don't usually go to

university.

PAUL

Are you telling me that I look like

a barber?

JEANNE

No, but that's a razor's barber.

PAUL

That's a barber's razor.

JEANNE

Barber's razors, yes.

PAUL

Or a madmans.

JEANNE

So you want to cut me up?

PAUL

No. That would be like writing my

name on your face.

JEANNE

Like they do to slaves?

PAUL

Slaves are branded on the ass and I

want you free.

JEANNE

Free?! I'm not free! You want to

know why...

(MORE)

46.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

why you don't want to know anything

about me? Because you hate women.

PAUL

Oh, really?

JEANNE

What the hell have they ever done

to you?

PAUL

Well,... either they always pretend

to know who I am or they pretend I

don't know who they are and that's

very boring.

JEANNE

I'm not afraid to say who I am. I

am 20 years old...

PAUL

NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is

your brain? State zitta. Halt's

Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get

it?

PAUL (CONT'D)

I know it's tough but you're gonna

have to bear it.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You know, these sinks are really

beautiful. They're very rare, you

don't find them any more. I think

it's these sinks that let you stay

together.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hmm? Don't you think?

PAUL (CONT'D)

What's that? What's all this?

47.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Mad?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Mad? Mad? Mad?

PAUL (CONT'D)

I think I'm happy with you.

JEANNE

Again! Do it again! Again!

CUT TO:

JEANNE'S VOICE

I'm coming! I'm ready.

JEANNE

Shall we leave together?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Bastard! He's a git! Not even

goodbye!

CUT TO:

48.

JEANNE

Tom!

TOM

Jeanne! What are you doing there?

I'm coming! I'll fly!

JEANNE

Wait! I've got to talk to you.

TOM

Why didn't you speak on the phone?

What's up?

JEANNE

You must find someone else.

TOM

For what?

JEANNE

For your film.

TOM

Why.

JEANNE

Because you're taking advantage of

me! Because you make me do things

I've never done! Because you're

taking up my time! You make me do

whatever you want! The film is

over!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

I'm tired of being raped!

49.

CUT TO:

MARCEL

Come in!

PAUL

You wanted to talk to me. Go on,

then. You know I haven't come to

cry with you?

MARCEL

Do you mind if I carry on working?

MARCEL (CONT'D)

It helps me a lot after what has

happened.

MARCEL (CONT'D)

Identical. Rosa wanted them

identical.

PAUL

Our bathrobes? You can't tell me

anything I don't already know.

MARCEL

Same colour, same pattern.

PAUL

Yes, yes, yes.

50.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Your meticulous. I've always

wondered why you save newspaper

clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby?

MARCEL

Hobby? I don't like that word.

Let's say it's some extra cash.

I do it for an agency.

PAUL

Oh, so it's serious. It's a job

that makes you read? Very

educational.

MARCEL

Be honest. You didn't know we had

the same bathrobes.

PAUL

Marcello...

MARCEL

We've got a lot of things in

common.

PAUL

Marcello, I know everything.

No, Rosa often talked to me about

you. I don't think there are many

marriages like that. It's

strange... I'm thirsty.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Would you like a shot of bourbon?

MARCEL

Hold on. Here's the bourbon.

51.

PAUL

Was that a present from Rosa, too?

MARCEL

I don't really like bourbon, but

Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle

here in my room.

MARCEL (CONT'D)

I was asking myself this question.

If, with these little things,

unimportant things, we could go

back over things, and understand

together.

PAUL

Together?

MARCEL

It's almost a year that Rosa and

I... Not passionately, but

regularly... I thought I knew her

as much as you can know...

PAUL

Your mistress...

MARCEL

For example, a while ago, something

happened that I still don't

understand. Do you see there, on

the wall?

MARCEL (CONT'D)

She had climbed onto the bed and

she was trying to tear at the walls

with her hands. I stopped her

because she was breaking her nails.

She had a strange... violence about

her. I'd never seen her like that.

PAUL

Our room is painted white. Rosa

wanted it to be different from the

other rooms in the hotel.

52.

PAUL (CONT'D)

To make it look like... a more

normal home. But... it had to be

changed here, too. I think she

started with the wall.

MARCEL

A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.

PAUL

You're lucky huh? You were... You

must have been very handsome 20

years ago.

MARCEL

Not as much as you.

PAUL

You've still got all your hair.

MARCEL

My hair... I have to have it

trimmed often. And wash it. I wash

it nearly every day.

PAUL

Don't you have massages?

MARCEL

Yes, I do.

PAUL

You're in good shape.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What do you do for... your stomach?

That's my problem.

MARCEL

For that...

MARCEL (CONT'D)

I have a secret.

53.

PAUL

Tell me!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Ah...

MARCEL

Are you leaving us? I saw your

suitcase was packed. Ah... America.

Why was she unfaithful to you?

PAUL

You can't believe that Rosa...

killed herself. It's hard for me

to... believe, too.

MARCEL

This is my secret! Thirty times

every morning.

PAUL

(ENGLISH)

Really, Marcello, I wonder what she

ever saw in you.

CUT TO:

JEANNE

Are you in?

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Is anyone here?

DINING ROOM

54.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Hi, monster.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Is something wrong?

PAUL'S VOICE

There's butter in the kitchen.

JEANNE

So you're here? Why didn't you

answer?

PAUL

Go get the butter.

JEANNE

I have to hurry. I have a cab

waiting.

PAUL

Go get the butter.

JEANNE

It makes me crazy!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

That you're so damned sure that I'm

coming back here.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Do you really think that an

American sitting on the floor in an

empty flat eating cheese and

drinking water is interesting?

55.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

There's something under here. Can

you hear it? It's hollow. Can you

hear it? It's hollow.

PAUL

Yeah. That's a hiding place.

JEANNE

Don't open it!

PAUL

Why not?

JEANNE

I don't know. Don't open it.

PAUL

What about that? Can I open that?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Huh? Wait a minute. Maybe there's

jewels in it.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Maybe there's gold.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Are you afraid?

JEANNE

No.

PAUL

No?

PAUL (CONT'D)

You're always afraid.

56.

JEANNE

No, but... maybe there is some

family secrets inside.

PAUL

Family secrets?

PAUL (CONT'D)

I'll tell you about family secrets.

JEANNE

What are you doing?

PAUL

I'm gonna tell you about the

family.

PAUL (CONT'D)

That holy institution meant to

breed virtue in savages.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I want you to repeat it after me.

JEANNE

No and no! No!

PAUL

Repeat it. Say, "Holy family."

Come on, say it.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Go on. Holy family. Church of good

citizens.

57.

JEANNE

Church...

PAUL

Good citizens.

JEANNE

Good citizens...

PAUL

Say it. Say it! The children are

tortured until they tell their

first lie.

JEANNE

The children... are tortured...

PAUL

Where the will is broken by

repression.

JEANNE

Where the will... broken...

repression.

PAUL

Where freedom...

JEANNE

Free... Freedom!

PAUL

..is assassinated. Freedom is

assassinated by egotism. Family...

JEANNE

Family...

PAUL

You... You... You... You f...

You... fucking... fucking...

family. You fucking... family! Oh,

God... Jesus. Oh, you... Oh...

JEANNE

Shit!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Hey, you!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Yes, you!

PAUL

Huh?

JEANNE

I've got a surprise for you.

59.

PAUL

What?

JEANNE

I've got a surprise for you!

PAUL

That's good. I like surprises.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What is it?

JEANNE

Music. But I don't know how to work

it.

PAUL

Do you enjoy that?

CUT TO:

TOM

Do you know why I sent the others

away?

JEANNE

Because you're angry, or you want

to be alone with me?

60.

TOM

And why do I want to be alone with

you?

JEANNE

You have something really serious

to tell me.

TOM

I have something really very

serious to tell you.

JEANNE

Is it happy or sad?

TOM

It's a secret.

JEANNE

So it's happy. What sort of secret?

TOM

A secret...

SOUND PERSON

Speak up! I can't hear anything.

TOM

...between a man and a woman.

JEANNE

Is it dirty or is it about love?

TOM

About love. But that's not all.

JEANNE

A secret about love, but which

isn't love. What is it?!

TOM

Voila. That in a week I'm marrying

you.

JEANNE

What?

61.

TOM

JEANNE

TOM

JEANNE

TOM

TOM

JEANNE

TOM

So, yes, then?

JEANNE

Yes!

TOM

No!

JEANNE

Yes!

TOM

Yes.

JEANNE

No.

TOM

Yes or no?

CUT TO:

JEANNE'S MOTHER

Of course, I'll send everything to

the country. What do you think,

Jeanne?

JEANNE

Olympia will be happy. I went there

yesterday with Tom.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

She's preparing a family museum.

63.

JEANNE'S MOTHER

Of course, I'm not sending the

boots. I'm keeping them with me. I

get strange shivers when I touch

them.

JEANNE'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

All these military things never

age.

JEANNE

When I was little, it seemed really

heavy when Papa taught me how to

shoot.

JEANNE'S MOTHER

I'm keeping that here. In a

respectable household, it's useful

to have a weapon.

JEANNE

You don't even know how to use it.

JEANNE'S MOTHER

The important thing is to have one.

It makes an impression.

JEANNE

You really kept everything of

Papa's.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Who's that? His orderly?

JEANNE'S MOTHER

A fine example of a Berber.

JEANNE

Oh.

64.

JEANNE'S MOTHER

A strong race. I tried to employ

them as servants, but it was

disastrous. 'm glad I decided to

send everything to the country. All

his things were piling up and

piling up.

JEANNE

Don't worry. You'll soon have all

the space you want.

JEANNE'S MOTHER

What does that mean?

JEANNE

Nothing.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Madame, the colonel's lady, I

announce...

JEANNE'S MOTHER

What? What?

JEANNE

On this solemn day...

JEANNE'S MOTHER

What? What solemn day?

JEANNE

I'm getting married in a week!

JEANNE'S MOTHER

What did you say?

65.

JEANNE

To Tom! In a week!

JEANNE'S MOTHER

Pardon?

JEANNE

Tom! In a week!

JEANNE'S MOTHER

What are you doing in a week?

CUT TO:

TOM

Five... two!

TOM (CONT'D)

Move into shot! We're shooting!

TOM (CONT'D)

So,... how do you see marriage?

JEANNE

Marriage?

TOM

Yes.

JEANNE

I see it everywhere. All the time.

66.

TOM

What do you mean, everywhere?

JEANNE

On walls. On buildings.

TOM

Walls and buildings?

JEANNE

Yes, on advertising hoardings.

TOM

What are they selling? Cars. Tinned

meat. Cigarettes.

JEANNE

No. They're all about young

couples. Before marriage, no

children. Then the same couple,

married with children. In short,

marriage. The perfect, ideal,

successful marriage. It's no longer

the preserve of the Church. The

husband was burdened with

responsibilities and the wife

nagged. Now, weddings in

advertising smile!

TOM

They smile. On posters.

JEANNE

On posters, of course. But why t

take poster marriage seriously?

Marriage... Pop marriage!

TOM

Pop? That's the formula. For pop

youth, pop marriage! But... what if

the pop marriage doesn't work?

JEANNE

Then you have to fix it like you

would a car. The spouses are two

workers in overalls bending over an

engine to fix it.

TOM

And in case of adultery what

happens to the pop marriage?

67.

JEANNE

In that case, there are three or

four workers.

TOM

What about love? Is love pop?

JEANNE

No. That's not. Love isn't pop.

TOM

Love isn't pop. So what is it?

JEANNE

The workers retire to a secret

flat, take off their overalls

and become men and women again

and make love.

TOM

You're wonderful.

JEANNE

It's the dress that makes the

bride.

TOM

You're better than Rita Hayworth.

Better than Joan Crawford! Better

than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren

Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner

when she was Mickey Rooney's lover!

TOM (CONT'D)

What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but

keep filming! Why aren't you

filming in the rain?

CREW 1

You're crazy!

68.

TOM

You're all fired!

TOM (CONT'D)

Where's Jeanne?

DRESSER 1

She must have run off.

TOM

When? ln the rain?

JEANNE

Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!

CUT TO:

JEANNE'S VOICE

Please forgive me!

JEANNE

(FRENCH)

Forgive me! I wanted to leave you

and I couldn't.

I wanted to leave you and I

couldn't. I can't. I can't leave

you, do you understand?

Do you still want me?

Voila!

Oh, there once was a man

And he had an old sow ow! Hi-diddle-

dow...

PAUL (CONT'D)

You're wet.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What the hell?

70.

PAUL (CONT'D)

A rat. Only a rat.

PAUL (CONT'D)

There are more rats in Paris than

people. Yum, yum, yum.

JEANNE

I want to go!

PAUL

Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite

first? You don't want to run and

eat.

JEANNE

This is the end!

PAUL

No, this is the end...

PAUL (CONT'D)

...but I like to start with the

head. That's the best part. Are you

sure you won't have any? OK.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What's the matter? You don't dig

rat?

JEANNE

I wanna go! I can't make love in

this bed any more. I can't. It's

disgusting! Nauseating!

PAUL

Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or

standing on the mantel.

71.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Listen, I gotta get some mayonnaise

for this. Because, it really is

good with mayonnaise.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I'll save the asshole for you.

PAUL'S VOICE

Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!

JEANNE

I want to get out of here. I want

to go. I can't stand it here any

more. Yes. I'm going.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

I'm not coming back... ever.

FRONT DOOR

PAUL

Quo vadis, baby?

JEANNE

I forgot to tell you something. I

fell in love with somebody.

PAUL

Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know,

you're going to have to get out of

these wet duds.

JEANNE

I'm going to make love with him!

72.

PAUL

Well, first you have to take a hot

bath. Cos if you don't...

PAUL (CONT'D)

...you're gonna get pneumonia,

right? Huh?

PAUL (CONT'D)

And then you know what happens? You

get pneumonia, then you know what

happens? You die. And then, you

know what happens when you die?

I get to fuck the dead rat!

CUT TO:

PAUL

Give me the soap.

JEANNE

I'm in love.

PAUL

You're in love?

PAUL (CONT'D)

How delightful.

JEANNE

I'm in love! I'm in love, you

understand?

73.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

I'm in love, I'm in love!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Oh! I'm in love!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

You know, you're old! You're

getting fat.

PAUL

Fat, is it? How unkind.

JEANNE

Half of your hair is out and the

other half is almost white.

PAUL

In ten years, you'll be playing

soccer with your tits.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What do you think of that? You know

what I'm gonna be doing?

JEANNE

You will be on a... wheelchair!

PAUL

Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll

be smirking and giggling all the

way to eternity.

JEANNE

How poetic. But please, before you

go, wash my feet.

PAUL

OK. oblesse oblige.

74.

JEANNE

You know, he and I, we make love.

PAUL

Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he

a good fucker?

JEANNE

Magnificent.

PAUL

You know, you're a jerk. Cos the

best fucking you're gonna get

is right here in this apartment.

Stand up.

JEANNE

He is full of mysteries.

PAUL

Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb

dodo. All the mysteries that you're

ever gonna know in life are right

here.

JEANNE

He is like everybody but... at the

same time he's different.

PAUL

You mean, like everybody.

JEANNE

Yeah, but... even he fright me.

Even he frightens me.

PAUL

What is he, your local pimp?

JEANNE

He could be. He looks it. You know

why I'm in love with him?

75.

PAUL

I can't wait.

JEANNE

Because he know. He know how to

make me fall in love with him.

PAUL

You want this man you love to

protect and take care of you.

JEANNE

Yeah.

PAUL

You want this golden, shining,

powerful warrior to build a

fortress where you can hide in. So

you don't have to ever... have...

You don't ever have to be afraid.

You don't have to feel lonely or

empty. That's what you want, isn't

it?

JEANNE

Yes.

PAUL

Well, you'll never find it.

JEANNE

But I find this man.

PAUL

Then it won't be long until he'll

want you to build a fortress for

him out of your tits and out of

your cunt and your hair and your

smile and the way you smell. And...

and some place where he can feel

comfortable and secure enough so

that he can worship in front of the

altar of his own prick.

JEANNE

But I find this man!

76.

PAUL

No, you're alone. You're all alone.

You won't be free of that feeling

of being alone until you look death

right in the face. I mean, that

sounds like bullshit, some romantic

crap, until you go right up into

the ass of death. Right up in his

ass... till you find the womb of

fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe

then, you'll be able to find him.

JEANNE

But I find this man. He's you! You

are that man!

PAUL

Get me the scissors.

JEANNE

What?

PAUL

Get me the fingernail scissors.

PAUL (CONT'D)

No. I want you to cut the

fingernails on your right hand,

these two.

JEANNE

That's it.

PAUL

I want you to put your fingers up

my ass.

JEANNE

What?

PAUL

Put your fingers up my ass, are you

deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig...

and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig

fuck you.

(MORE)

77.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I want the pig to vomit in your

face and I want you to swallow the

vomit. Are you gonna do that for

me?

JEANNE

Yeah.

PAUL

Huh?

JEANNE

Yeah!

PAUL

I want the pig to die while...

while you're fucking him. Then

you'll have to go behind him. I

want you to smell the dying farts

of the pig. Are you gonna do all of

that for me?

JEANNE

Yes, and more than that! And worse!

And worse than before.

CUT TO:

PAUL

You look ridiculous in that make-

up. Like the caricature of a whore.

A little touch of Mommy in the

night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the

bathtub. I wish you could see

yourself. You'd really laugh.

You're your mother's masterpiece.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh Christ! There are too many

fucking flowers in this place. I

can't breathe. You know on the top

of the closet?

Go on, tell me something! Smile,

you cunt!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Go on, tell me... Tell me something

sweet. Smile at me and say I just

misunderstood. Go on, tell me. You

pig-fucker! You goddamn, fucking,

pig-fucking liar. Rosa, I'm

sorry... I just can't... I can't

stand it... to see these goddamn

things on your face. You never wore

make-up. This fucking shit. I'm

gonna take this off your mouth.

This lipstick... Rosa... Oh, God!

PAUL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I don't know why you did

it. I'd do it too, if I knew how. I

just don't know how. I have to... I

have to find a way.

PROSTITUTE'S VOICE

Is anyone there?

PAUL

What?

PROSTITUTE'S VOICE

There was a noise in there!

PAUL

All right, I'm... I'm coming.

(back to ROSA)

I have to go. I have to go,

sweetheart, baby. Somebody's

calling me.

PROSTITUTE'S VOICE

Well? Is anyone there?

PAUL

Yeah. I'm coming.

PROSTITUTE

Here he is.

(TO PAUL)

Hurry up! Wake up! Open up! Open

up!

PAUL

It's four in the morning.

PROSTITUTE

I need room four for a while.

(TO JOHN)

Half an hour?

(TO PAUL)

Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour.

PAUL

We're full.

PROSTITUTE

That's not true. When you're full,

you put a sign outside. I know the

hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on

the street. Call the owner. What

are you waiting for? The owner has

never made a fuss. Rosa and I are

old friends. Open up.

PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)

Don't make any trouble or I'll tell

your boss.

(TO JOHN)

Come in, it's all sorted...

PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)

You've won. He's taken off.

PAUL

I'm very sorry.

PROSTITUTE

Hurry up! He can't be far away.

81.

PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)

Make him come back. Tell him he

can't just walk off.

CUT TO:

JOHN

Oh,... please don't tell her you

found me. I don't fancy it any

more. Did you see her face? Once,

my wife satisfied me. But now she's

got a skin disease. It's like

snakeskin. Put yourself in my

place.

PAUL

Come. Come with me.

JOHN

But... Let go of me!

JOHN (CONT'D)

You're crazy! Let go of me! Let go!

PAUL

Get the fuck out of here!

82.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Faggot!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JEANNE

No!

CUT TO:

83.

JEANNE

Try and remember! The man from the

fourth floor. He moved in a few

days ago.

CONCIERGE

I told you, I don't know anyone.

They come and go. The man on the

fourth, the woman on the first.

What do I know?

JEANNE

Where did they take the furniture

too? It's empty. Where do you send

his mail? Give me his address.

CONCIERGE

I don't have it. I don't know these

people.

JEANNE

Not even his name?

CONCIERGE

Nothing!

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

Ma'zelle!

CUT TO:

JEANNE

I've found a flat for us. 1 rue

Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come

quickly! You'll come now? Do you

know where it is? I'll wait for

you. Come over.

84.

CUT TO:

JEANNE

Come in, it's open.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Do you like our flat? It's very

light. There's a tiny room, too.

It's too small for a double bed. It

would be fine for a child. Fidel.

That's a nice name for a boy.

Fidel, as in Castro.

TOM

But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As

in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but

I like it. You know, I wanted to

film you every day. In the morning,

when you wake up, in the evening,

when you sleep. When you first

smile, and I didn't film any of

that. Here.

TOM (CONT'D)

Today is the last day of shooting.

The film is finished. I don't like

things that finish, things that

end. You have to start something

else right away.

85.

TOM (CONT'D)

This flat is huge!

TOM (CONT'D)

Where are you?

JEANNE

I'm here!

TOM

It's too big! We'll get lost!

JEANNE

Stop it! Don't start!

TOM

How did you find this flat?

JEANNE

By chance.

TOM

We'll change everything!

JEANNE

Everything! We'll change chance to

destiny.

TOM

Go on, Jeanne. Take off!

TOM (CONT'D)

Fly away, you're in heaven! You're

soaring, you're in heaven! Come

down, take a nose dive, come down!

Make three turns, come down.

Jeanne, what's happening? There's

an air pocket.

JEANNE

What's happening?

86.

TOM

The patches of turbulence are over.

We can't play like children any

more, Jeanne.

TOM (CONT'D)

We're adults.

JEANNE

Adults? That's awful!

TOM

Yes. It's awful.

JEANNE

What do adults do?

TOM

I don't know. We'll have to invent

the gestures and the words. For

example, adults...

TOM (CONT'D)

But there's one thing I do know.

Adults are calm...

TOM (CONT'D)

...serious, logical, measured,

level-headed...

JEANNE

Yes...

TOM

And... they face up to problems...

JEANNE

...Yes, yes. Yes, yes.

87.

TOM

You see, Jeanne, this flat won't

work for us. This flat, it won't

work for us, Jeanne.

JEANNE

Where are you going?

TOM

To look for a flat.

JEANNE

What kind of flat?

TOM

A flat we can live in.

JEANNE

We can live here.

TOM

It's squalid. It smells. It makes

me sick. Are you coming with me?

JEANNE

No, no. I've got to close the

windows and return the key. There's

a lot to do.

TOM

OK.

JEANNE

Bye.

TOM

Bye.

CUT TO:

88.

PAUL

It's me again.

JEANNE

It's over. It's over.

PAUL

It's over, then it begins again.

JEANNE

What begins again? I don't

understand anything any more.

PAUL

There's nothing to understand. We

left the apartment. Now we begin

again with love and all the rest of

it.

JEANNE

The rest?

PAUL

Yeah, listen.

89.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a

little hotel, a kind of a dump. But

it's not completely a flophouse.

And... I used to live on my luck,

and I got married. My wife killed

herself.

CUT TO:

PAUL'S VOICE

But you know, what the hell. I'm...

no prize. I picked up a nail when I

was in Cuba in and now I got a

prostate like an Idaho potato. But

I'm still a good stick man, even if

I can't have any children. Let's

see. I don't have any stomping

grounds. I don't have any friends.

I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd

probably settle for a hard chair

and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a

long, dull story even duller, I

come from a time when a guy like me

would drop into a joint like this

and pick up a young chick like you

and... and call her a bimbo.

PAUL

I'm awfully sorry to intrude

but I was so struck with your

beauty that I thought I could offer

you a glass of champagne. Is this

seat taken?

90.

JEANNE

No.

PAUL

May I?

JEANNE

If you'd like to.

PAUL

Garcon!

PAUL (CONT'D)

You know, the tango is a, is a

rite. Do you understand "rite"? And

you must watch the legs of the

dancers.

DANCE FLOOR

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh, no! You haven't drunk your

champagne because it was warm. And

then I ordered you a Scotch and you

haven't drunk your Scotch.

DANCE FLOOR

PAUL (CONT'D)

Come on. Just a sip for Daddy.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Now, if you love me, you'll drink

all of it.

JEANNE

OK, I love you.

91.

PAUL

Bravo!

JEANNE

Tell me about your wife.

PAUL

Let's talk about us.

JEANNE

OK. But this place is so pitiful.

PAUL

Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?

JEANNE

Monsieur Maitre d'Hotel.

PAUL

That's rather nasty. Anyway, you

dummy, I love you. And I want to

live with you.

JEANNE

In your flophouse?

PAUL

In my flophouse. What the hell does

that mean? What the hell difference

does it make if I have a flophouse

or a hotel or a castle? I love you.

What the fuck difference does it

make?!

DANCE FLOOR

PRESIDENT

The jury has chosen the following

ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9

...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!

(MORE)

92.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

And now, ladies and gentlemen, good

luck for the last tango!

JEANNE

Give me some more whisky.

PAUL

Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.

JEANNE

But I'm thirsty now and I want some

more drink.

PAUL

All right. I think that's a good

idea.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Wait a minute. Because you're

really beautiful. Wait a minute.

I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I

didn't mean to spill my drink.

JEANNE

Let's have a toast to our life in

the hotel.

PAUL

No! Fuck all that! Come on. No.

Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to

our life in the country. Huh?

JEANNE

You're a nature lover? You didn't

tell me that.

PAUL

Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy.

Can't you see me with the cows and

the chicken shit all over me?

JEANNE

Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows.

93.

PAUL

Cows.

JEANNE

I will be your cow, too.

PAUL

And listen... I get to milk you

twice a day. How about that?

JEANNE

I hate the country.

PAUL

What do you mean you hate the

country?

JEANNE

I hate it! I prefer to go to the

hotel. Come on, let's go...

PAUL

No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you

wanna dance? We can start again.

PRESIDENT

That's the limit! What are you

doing?

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

You'll have to leave, sir.

94.

PAUL

Madame! 'Tis ever love.

PRESIDENT

Go to the circus if you want to see

love! Go on! Get out of here!

You'll have to leave.

PAUL

Oh my god, I've never...

PAUL (CONT'D)

Kiss me, sweetheart!

She is APPALLED and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the

PAUL (CONT'D)

Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I could dance for ever. Oh, my

hemorrhoid!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let

me peruse you and remember you

always like this.

95.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Garcon! Champagne! If music be the

food of love, play on.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What's the matter with you?

JEANNE

It's finished.

PAUL

What's the matter with you?

JEANNE

It's finished!

PAUL

What's finished?

JEANNE

We're never going to see each other

again. Never!

PAUL

That's ridiculous.

PAUL (CONT'D)

That's ridiculous!

JEANNE

It's not a joke.

PAUL

Oh, you dirty rat!

JEANNE

It's finished.

PAUL

Look, when something's finished, it

begins again.

JEANNE

I'm getting married! I'm going

away. It's finished.

96.

PAUL

Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a

subway strap, that's me cock!

JEANNE

It's finished!

PAUL

Oh... Jesus...

PAUL (CONT'D)

Wait a minute...

(TO HIMSELF)

You dumb bimbo...

PAUL (CONT'D)

Shit! Wait a minute. Goddamn it!

Hey!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hey, rube! Come here! Come here!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Come heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrreeeeee!

PAUL (CONT'D)

I'm gonna get you! Bimbo!

CUT TO:

97.

PARKING LOT

JEANNE

Stop! Stop!

PAUL

Hold it!

JEANNE

It's over!

PAUL

Hey, cool it!

JEANNE

Stop it! We're finished.

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Go away! Go away! Go away!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Let go! Go away!

PAUL

I can't win. Give me a break!

SIDE STREET

98.

JEANNE

I'll call the police!

PAUL

Aha! I smell the henhouse.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Well, shit, I'm not in your way.

PAUL (CONT'D)

After you, mademoiselle!

PAUL (CONT'D)

So long, sister. Besides, you're a

crummy-looking broad. I don't give

a damn if I never see you again.

Shit.

CUT TO:

JEANNE

It's over! It's over!

PAUL

Oh, fuck the police.

JEANNE

It's over!

99.

PAUL

Listen, I want to talk to you for

Christ sake...

JEANNE

Help!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Help! Help!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Please, help!

JEANNE (CONT'D)

Help! Help!

PAUL

Oh, man!

JEANNE

Help! Help me! Help!

PAUL

This is getting ridiculous.

100.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's the title shot, baby. We're

going all the way. Oh, Christ.

LIVING ROOM

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's a little old, but full of

memories, huh?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Mademoiselle...

PAUL (CONT'D)

How do you like your hero? Over

easy or sunny-side up?

PAUL (CONT'D)

You ran through Africa and Asia and

Indonesia.

PAUL (CONT'D)

And now I've found you. And I love

you.

101.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I wanna know your name.

JEANNE

Jeanne...

PAUL

Our children.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Our children.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Our children... will remember.

102.

JEANNE

I don't know who he is. He followed

me in the street. He tried to rape

me. He's a lunatic. I don't know

what he's called. I don't know his

name. I don't know who he is. He

tried to rape me. I don't know. I

don't know him. I don't know who he

is. He's a lunatic. I don't know

his name.
