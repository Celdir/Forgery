CREDITS

Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various

She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not

MICHELLE

God !...... No !......

She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put

BILL'S VOICE

So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a

specific answer...

The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-

MICHELLE

You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower

of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real

pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points

straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...

BILL

OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and

swoop down to finish me off.

MICHELLE

Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You

think that everything got to be either black or white

because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He

knows I'm not like you

BILL

Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.

MICHELLE

We all do what ?

BILL

Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a

keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have

to fill in the blanks. We invent things.

MICHELLE

I don't know what you mean.

BILL

You invent enemies to test your strength against. You

invent gods to protect you from these enemies.

MICHELLE

What a depressing view of life you have, that is such

horse-shit !

BILL

Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next

moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder

who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember

and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?

MICHELLE

No, why don't you tell me

BILL

Take a look in the mirror, Michelle

MICHELLE

Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...

BILL

Any mirror. Tell me what you see.

MICHELLE

I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there

is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the

view outside actually...

SEVERAL VOICES

All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your

car... Stop it...

BILL

My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around

her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...

BILL

Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from

Hell. And then the red started to fade away.

LARRY

Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.

BILL

Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I

don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.

LARRY

I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.

BILL

Starts to stand up.

Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a

bitch.

LARRY

Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.

Do you really believe that you're responsible for her

illness. You were a small recent part of her life.

BILL

Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking

glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that

easily.

LARRY

Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with

anyone else ?

BILL

No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be

romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of

them want to love me

LARRY

Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage

once.

BILL

She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody

else to death.

LARRY

Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to

deny emotion.

BILL

Oh yeah !

LARRY

As you know, that could be very dangerous.

BILL

Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got

something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get

fixed.

LARRY

You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man

like you to forgive himself.

BILL

I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.

LARRY

Don't run away because of one treatment failure.

BILL

I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los

Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up

here, isn't it...

Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.

STEWARDESS

Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain

seated until the aircraft comes...

VOICE IN THE RADIO

Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender

on 405, slowing thing down.

TAXI DRIVER

Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an

accident !...

... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?

What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving

here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !

Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK... Was

that an after-schock I felt ?...

Leave him alone, will you ?

BUCK

Clark !

CASEY

BUCK

Clark !

CLARK

Yeah !

BUCK

Did you read the paper to-day ?

CLARK

No !

BUCK

I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had !

CLARK

Oh Christ ! I fell right into that !

CASEY

16...

CLARK

4... 47...

BUCK

I care that he is late.

CASEY

I don't get it.

SONDRA

I do too.

CASEY

I don't care.

SONDRA

Why not ?

BUCK

Because his father's paying for his therapy.

SONDRA

Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.

CASEY

Unbelievable !...

BOB

I think we should get started now... Clark...

BILL

Hey Bob !

BOB

God ! Bill !

BOB

How you doing ? You look great.

BILL

I'm good...

BOB

OK...

BILL

I' sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic on the freeway.

BOB

Listen... We're just about to get started.

BILL

You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.

BOB

Why don't you join us ?

BILL

Oh no... Listen... I's the last thing I need right now...

BOB

I'm serious... I could use a second look.

BILL

No, Bob... Not tonight...

BOB

This is my friend, and colleague, Bill Capa, from New-York.

Why don't you sit down over there, Bill...

... I thought it might be interesting for you, and for him,

if he sat in one of our session.

BUCK

What kind of a shrink are you ?

BILL

I'm a behaviorist.

CASEY

Qualifications ?

BILL

Same as Bob. We went to college together. We fought the

battle at Penn State Mental Hospital, as interns...

BOB

No one is gonna be offended if you want to say no.

BUCK

No, Bob !

SONDRA

Nobod... Nobody wants to say no... I'm Sondra... How are you,

Bill ?

BILL

Fine, thank you, Sondra.

CLARK

Medical degree ?

BILL

No. I'm a psychologist and a psycho-analyst, not a

psychiatrist. The Ph.D. is from N.Y.U.

CLARK

OK ! Thank you...

CASEY

So, it's Bill and Bob, therapy "a deux" !

BOB

Why don't we begin by introducing ourselves and then saying

as much or as little about why we are here as we are

confortable with...

BUCK

Name's Buck.

SONDRA

Oh, that's helpful. Very macho of you

BUCK

That's an anti-gender remark

BOB

Sondra ! Sondra, whey don't you start us off ?

SONDRA

OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men

but...

... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time...

But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and...

sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing...

... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is

that OK !

BOB

Thank you.

SONDRA

THANKS

BOB

Richie !...

CASEY

This will be an event

BOB

Richie !

BUCK

Richie !

RICHIE

What !

BOB

Would you like to tell Bill a little something about

yourself ?

RICHIE

No !

CLARK

OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a

gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's

promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group.

BUCK

Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that.

CLARK

Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain.

BUCK

Saint Michael, sir.

CLARK

This is not about you.

BUCK

You're right...

BOB

You know what I am saying ?...

RICHIE

I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens...

except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so

that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I

blush too.

CASEY

Y-You c... can say that again...

RICHIE

Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off !

You fuckin' cocksucker !

BUCK

Get up!

RICHIE

Get the fuck off me !

BOB

Buck.

SONDRA

Richie !

BOB

It's all right... He'll come back...

BUCK

What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...

CASEY

Was it something I said ?

SONDRA

You are an asshole !

BOB

You know, guys... A little humanity...

BUCK

Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out

of you, aren't we ?

SONDRA

Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.

BUCK

Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.

SONDRA

Oh ! That's very nice !

BOB

Buck ?

BUCK

I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to

pass... All right ?

BILL

Very sorry. How did they die ?

BUCK

They say...

... I... I can't talk about it...

BOB

Casey ?

CASEY

I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft

downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...

SONDRA

Can't you ever be serious ?...

BUCK

Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark

CLARK

And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer.

And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.

CASEY

So what's the problem ?

CLARK

The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in

here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain

opened in minimum of fifteen inches.

SONDRA

I can't stand smoke... OK ?

CLARK

And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those

ashtrays...

SONDRA

How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do

anything about this, Bob ?

CLARK

... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine

dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-

ninety-nine point five.

CASEY

HE LAUGHS

He's going to open the door.

CLARK

One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure

you can work that out.

CASEY

He's going to open the door.

CLARK

I'm going to open the door.

SONDRA

You smell like an ashtray.

CLARK

You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.

SONDRA

Hi, Richie !

BUCK

He's back.

CASEY

He's back.

BUCK

Next time you get snot on the doorknob...

SONDRA

Come sit down here.

BOB

Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?

BILL

Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right

now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.

BOB

Fair enough...

SONDRA

...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that...

It's wonderful...

BOB

Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...

BUCK

Way to go.

BOB

Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.

SONDRA

Bye...

BUCK

Coffee, anyone?

BILL

Yeah.

CLARK

Nine.

CLARK

Have you read Bob's book ?

BILL

No, I haven't.

CLARK

It's really... it's quite excellent.

BILL

"Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.

CLARK

Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.

BILL

Good night.

BILL

Alone at last !...

BOB

Are you OK ?

BILL

Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making

progress...

BOB

You want to get a drink ?

BILL

Hu-hu !

BOB

You want to get laid ?

BILL

No !

BOB

So what do you think of my little group ?

BILL

What's Buck's story ?

BOB

You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know

yet. He's not talking yet... Either !

BILL

How about Casey ?

BOB

You tell me !

BILL

Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father...

How am I doing so far ?

BOB

A Plus !

BILL

Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very

expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in

therapy.

BOB

You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up !

BILL

Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get

you ten he likes to whack now and then.

BOB

Where did you get that from ?

BILL

I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.

BOB

What about Richie ?

BILL

Genuine nut-case.

BOB

Dangerous ?

BILL

Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !

BOB

Oh, I see. "Trapped rat" syndrome with a recommendation of

a "Non fuck with" therapy !

Well, can I quote you on that ?

BILL

Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...

BOB

OK, I'm ready.

BILL

All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you

recommend ?

BOB

Don't fuck with it !

BILL

Now, you got it.

BILL

It's all one place ?...

Goddamn...

Like peeking through a keyhole...

You get a very limited... view of the truth....

BOB

What's that ?

BILL

"Way to go" must have gone really well !

BOB

Yeah !

BOB

After you, wise guy... Come on.

BILL

Oh, men...

So, how are we as we approach forty ?

BOB

We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got

divorced. We have some money...

... We're meticulous.

BILL

I don't detect a woman's touch.

BOB

We have a little friend... You'll meet her.

BILL

She's too young for you.

BOB

Ohh !

BILL

Always get the cliches and you won't be disappointed.

BOB

This woman is not a cliche.

BILL

Thanks...

Good to see you, Bob !

BOB

You too !... So...

You're ready yet ?

BILL

Ready to what ?

So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...

I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my

practice.

BOB

Lost you religion, huh ?

BILL

Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.

BOB

I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.

BILL

There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel

the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right

now. And I think I'm going crazy...

I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.

BOB

You may be... Your mind may be shot...

BOB

... but I hope your body isn't.

BILL

Do I get to warm up ?

BOB

Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then...

... let's do ten.

BILL

Ten ?

BOB

Too much for you, huh ?

BILL

I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty.

They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the

BOB

Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop

our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can

go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?

BILL

Wouldn't be civilized...

BOB

Why ?

BILL

You'll be sulking !

BOB

You don't have hills in New-York...

Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...

BILL

What ?

BOB

What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...

BILL

What are you afraid of ?

BOB

I got a gear slip, here somewhere...

BILL

That's not what I meant... What with the security systems,

the security gates, looking over your shoulder.

BOB

I've been getting some threats.

BILL

What do you mean ?... Death threats ?

BOB

Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just

don't know who...

BILL

Monday night as in last night ?

BOB

Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that

you might have a hunch.

BILL

No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the

group ?

BOB

Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple

of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.

BILL

Call the cops ?...

BOB

Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in

L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if

anything happened.

BILL

That makes sense.

BOB

Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.

BILL

Yeah !

BOB

How about you ?

BILL

About me... what ?

What would you give a suicidal patient that's got

everything ?

BOB

Parachute, I heard it already.

BILL

Out here already, huh ?

BOB

Come on, old timer !...

BILL

Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.

BOB

You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...

BILL

Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about

that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !

BOB

Got a ring to it !

BILL

They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !

BOB

See you next week. All right ?

BARBARA

I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?

BOB

That'll be great, Barbara.

BOB

Barbara ?...

No... Nooooo !... Why ?

VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN

Have you thought about...

THE HOOKER

Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very

cute. I love you.

THE POLICE OFFICER

I love you too !

HECTOR

You're Capa ?

BILL

Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.

HECTOR

You're here because of the dead doctor ?

BILL

Yes...

HECTOR

I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about

this Monday group.

BILL

There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember

their names right now.

HECTOR

Like five cuckoos.

BILL

No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At

least, that's what Bob thought.

HECTOR

Bob Moore ?

BILL

Good. Yes, Bob Moore.

HECTOR

Four men and one woman.

BILL

Right.

HECTOR

And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?

BILL

Yes, I did.

HECTOR

So, who did it ?

Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man.

What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...

Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like

that, bro. Hey !

It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...

BILL

You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to

tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't

really know any of these people.

HECTOR

But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind

of suspicion.

BILL

I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even

if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.

HECTOR

Confidentiality ?...

BILL

Yes.

HECTOR

You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.

BILL

Similar to the Miranda oath.

HECTOR

If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between

the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?...

Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody,

because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...

BILL

Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in

Los Angeles four days.

HECTOR

You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?

BILL

Yes.

HECTOR

Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know,

like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a

situation like this ?

BILL

Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group...

continue the treatment.

HECTOR

How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures

dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion.

Is that what you're planning ?

BILL

No.

HECTOR

Why not ?

BILL

Because I really can't handle that right now.

HECTOR

Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and

you already have you own private screwing farm.

How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where

were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?

BILL

I was at his house, Bob's house.

HECTOR

You had to think about that ?

BILL

Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant

Martinez ?

HECTOR

Hey ! You want a lawyer ?

BILL

Do I need a lawyer ?

HECTOR

You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer.

All right !... You can go home now, take a shower.

And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going

for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't

want the press fucking things up.

BILL

All right !... All right !... Hold on !

BILL

Oh shit !

HECTOR

Capa !... Capa !... Are you there ?

BILL

Yeah...

HECTOR

How is it going ?

BILL

What do you want ?

HECTOR

I brought the victim's car back and I got to search the

house.

BILL

You got a search warrant ?

HECTOR

What is it with you ? Don't you want me to find out who

killed your friend ?... No, I don't have a warrant.

BILL

All right... Come on in...

HECTOR

Open the gate.

BILL

Yeah... Right... How's that ?

HECTOR

You got the sprinklers on !

BILL

How about that ?

BILL

Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...

HECTOR

Nice bush !

BILL

I'll tell you said so...

I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...

HECTOR

Check this fucking bed !

Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !

BILL

I do not like guns.

HECTOR

You prefer knives ?

HECTOR

I need you to do me a favor.

BILL

What's that ?

HECTOR

I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.

BILL

Me ?...

HECTOR

Yes.

BILL

Why ?

HECTOR

Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will

all come in, but then you would be able to spot something

wrong.

BILL

I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...

HECTOR

I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you

want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart.

BILL

What does that mean?

HECTOR

If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the

person to break the news to these people ?  Listen up, you

fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead.

Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in

this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked

up as you are or get worse.

BILL

You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.

HECTOR

It's better if you do it.

BILL

No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't

lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't

understand.

I have to call you back. Christ !

Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...

ROSE

Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose.

BILL

Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill

Capa...

ROSE

I got no insurance...

I know it's against the law and everything.

Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you

just get an estimate.

OK ?... Just give me a break !

BILL

Got a pen ?

ROSE

Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.

BILL

I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down,

because I am not sure about this number, and how long I

gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the

next couple of days.

ROSE

I will.

BILL

Bye !

ROSE

Hey !... Don't you want my address ?

BILL

You could lie.

BILL

Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?

BUCK

Sondra... Where's Bob ?

RICHIE

Wha... What's wrong ?

BILL

If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here.

She's always this late ?

CLARK

Depends on who is banging her...

SONDRA

Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.

CASEY

Was class was that, Sondra ? Advanced cunnilingus for the

single woman, or a CPR for pleasure and game ?

BUCK

Christ, don't excite her !...

SONDRA

Where is Doctor Moore ?

BILL

There's something I want to tell you.

RICHIE & CASEY

What ?

SONDRA

What's the matter ?

CASEY

Shhhh !...

SONDRA

I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !

BILL

You should prepare yourself for bad news...

SONDRA

Why ?...

BILL

Bob's been killed.

SONDRA

Ohhhh !

CASEY

What are you saying ?... What are you telling me ?

BILL

He was murdered.

CASEY

Sondra !...

BILL

He was locking up here late Friday night.

SONDRA

Here ?...

BILL

Yes, right here in the office.

BUCK

Was he shot... stabbed... beaten ?... Have they got a suspect... a

motive ? Three days go by, and you don't call us.

BILL

It was easier if you were here together.

CASEY

Oh, I see. So, even Bob's death is group therapy. That's

great. Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us a chance to grieve

together. Shit !...

BUCK

What the fuck is going on here ? I need to know more.

BILL

He was stabbed to death.

CLARK

How many times was he stabbed ?

SONDRA

This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact

numbers now ?

BILL

Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...

SONDRA

Get your fucking hands off me...

BILL

It's OK... It's OK !

CASEY

It doesn't make sense to me...

BILL

Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell

you...

CASEY

It wasn't a thief, I can tell you that right now.

CLARK

I agree.

CASEY

I mean, why stab a guy thirty times ?... Bob !... He'd piss in

his pants if you showed him a knife, you know that...

SONDRA

What are you saying ?

CASEY

I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a

person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,

right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a

shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they

want to.

CLARK

That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around

and stab someone thirty times.

BUCK

Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ?

SONDRA

It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.

RICHIE

What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the

group ?

CASEY

I bet Doctor Capa has an idea...

BUCK

What does he mean ?

BILL

I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to

replace Bob...

SONDRA

Maybe you should.

BILL

No... I can't do that... Not right now...

SONDRA

Why ?...

BILL

One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people

are.

CASEY

I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a

fucking Xanax ?

SONDRA

I have a librium...

BUCK

Stop with the drugs.

CASEY

It would be a good idea if you stayed.

BUCK

Bob isn't cold yet ?

CASEY

I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?...

SONDRA

You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him...

I'll be so much easier to trust you.

BILL

I know what kind of force a group can become in your life...

You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't

tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would...

But the truth is : You are the people that make this work.

I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you

to continue this, but I cannot help you.

CLARK

If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask :

why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.

BUCK

Maybe he just don't like us.

BILL

No, that's not it, Buck.

BUCK

Why don't you step on something?

CLARK

You stop.

BILL

Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she

committed suicide... Right in front of me.

Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my

colleagues say... But I don't know...

SONDRA

Oh, I'm sorry.

BILL

And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a

window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in

right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's

turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so

I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like

me around right now...

BUCK

I think I do.

RICHIE

M... me too.

CASEY

Why don't you give us a try for a month.

CLARK

Listen, if you need anything, any free legal advice, to

help you wrap up Bob's affair, please don't hesitate to

call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than

happy to help you in anyway.

BILL

Thank you.

HECTOR

You bring me a confession ?

BILL

No.

HECTOR

Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?

BILL

Listen, maybe it was not one of the group

HECTOR

Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob

Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.

BILL

Hey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other

for ? What's this place ?

HECTOR

I used to work in narcotics. They used to come here a lot.

I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's

parents. It's a nice place. I like it.

BILL

Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for

you. I'll see you around.

HECTOR

So, that's it, hey ?

BILL

Yeah.

HECTOR

Anything you want to tell me ?...

BILL

NO

VOICE OF THE CAR VALET

Yeah, it's a four-door, man !

HECTOR

So you better shut the group down.

BILL

Who say I hadn't ?

HECTOR

Oh, have you or haven't you ?

BILL

They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.

HECTOR

Ha ! Ha !... I figured... You're gonna do real well in this

town. Shut the fucker down.

BILL

Stop. You sent me over there.

HECTOR

No, I send you there to convey a piece of bad news...

Will you give me a break, will you, man !...

I didn't send you there to go trolling for business.

BILL

Come on !

HECTOR

You told me you couldn't handle it.

BILL

Well, it turns out that I handle it now.

HECTOR

You stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once.

Maybe you won't lose it. You leave it in there, it's gonna

get shewed up at the root.

BILL

I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.

HECTOR

I am being really nice, full of concern for your safety, in

case it's one of them, hey ? Shut it down, OK ?...

BILL

No... I can't do that.

HECTOR

Shut it down, chingada ! Don't be an asshole. You'll find

another set of wombats to exploit !

BILL

These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin

in childhood or in puberty?

HECTOR

Get out of my face.

BILL

Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words !

Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?...

If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you

special rates.

HECTOR

Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer

miles ?...

Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is

that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for

you ?

BILL

No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?

HECTOR

Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.

ROSE

Hello !

BILL

Who's there ?

ROSE

Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...

BILL

There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.

ROSE

So... did you get that estimate ?

BILL

No.

ROSE

Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but

it's kind of tasteful, right ?

BILL

And wet !

ROSE

You too, I guess.

BILL

Cold or tasteful ?

ROSE

So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...

ROSE

You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...

ROSE

Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared

or not ?

BILL

I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.

ROSE

Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for

your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick.

There is something about me that I bet you find a little

strange. Right ?

BILL

What is that ?

ROSE

Well, I haven't asked you what you do.

BILL

That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.

ROSE

Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually

get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure

it out for myself, you know ?

BILL

But what if I am ashamed of what I do.

ROSE

Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.

BILL

Who told you I was a shrink ?

ROSE

Well... Are you ?

BILL

How did you know ?

ROSE

The way you looked at me, you know ?

BILL

How I look at you ?

ROSE

You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think

you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to

play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of

thinking of a female.

BILL

So, you have a tuning fork too.

ROSE

I guess we have a lot in common.

BILL

We seem to be playing the same game.

ROSE

Why do you say I'm playing a game?

BILL

Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver?

The face glimpsed across a crowded room?

ROSE

Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.

BILL

You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no

rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those

burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.

ROSE

Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?

BILL

Yeah, sort of like that.

ROSE

I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room

here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up

with you.

BILL

Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to.

Thank you.

ROSE

Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !

BILL

No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough

for ?

ROSE

I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...

VOICE OF THE VALET

VOICE OVER

Cab's here ! Yo, who called a taxi ?

BILL

I am thinking you should just let me take you home and

forget about this stupid taxi.

ROSE

Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are,

'cause...

In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.

BILL

Give me your phone number and address.

ROSE

Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?

Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?

BILL

She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once.

Drives away without a backward glance.

DALE

Richie is what he is.

BILL

What exactly is that?

DALE

He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful

Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On

Down The Line."

BILL

Well, it could be worse.

DALE

Not much.

BILL

How long have you been his guardian?

DALE

Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of

Richie.

BILL

So, what can I do for you ?

DALE

Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of

therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been

like a mother and a father to him...

and I know I can get overprotective, but...

BILL

Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?

DALE

What Richie needs is normalcy.

BILL

Well, normalcy...

Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.

DALE

Richie has practically been raised by the state...

... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into

this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll

ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just

isn't right.

BILL

Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the

court to mandatory treatment.

DALE

Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to

help get him out.

BILL

You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling

pain... but I want you to know...

DALE

If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in

tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.

BILL

Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give

probation a call.

DALE

Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa.

I really appreciate it.

BILL

You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with

your hands.

DALE

Yeah, uh, I make furniture.

BILL

Really.

DALE

Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.

BILL

No kidding.

DALE

We called it the Chrysler desk.

BILL

Chrysler.

DALE

You ever see his bed ?

CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Hi. This is Casey.

I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a

message. Thanks.

BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father

sent me a check for the private sessions you were having

with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to

continue ? Let me know, okay ?

CASEY

I think I want to continue.

You bitch !

I called you a bitch !

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Oh!

Oh! I'm sorry.

A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked

BILL

Hey !

THE DRIVER

You idiot !

BILL

Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !

Fuck !

Hello !

I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck

with me !

Fuckin' bill. Great.

HECTOR

Capa !

BILL

Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a

cop ! You're never there when you need one !

HECTOR

What did I do now ?

BILL

Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !

HECTOR

A rattlesnake !

HECTOR

You scared the shit out of me outside.

BILL

Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?

HECTOR

I could use some assistance, some of your professional

wisdom.

BILL

I'm really flattered.

HECTOR

Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He

says he was alone in his loft.

BILL

Yeah ?

HECTOR

Mm-hmm.

BILL

What does that mean ?

HECTOR

What do you make of Casey?

BILL

He's a good kid.

HECTOR

You're an asshole, Capa.

BILL

Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?

HECTOR

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ?

Help me.

BILL

You're the cop. Figure it out.

HECTOR

You know what I think ? I think it was you. You've got the

look.

BILL

That's right.

HECTOR

Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone

says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.

BILL

Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the

way up... and I was on the way down.

HECTOR

Including...

Splat ! It unhinged you.

BILL

I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh?

Who is it?

ROSE

Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.

HECTOR

That's a very young girl to be going around... fending

benders.

BILL

Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing

a short dress of indeterminate color.

ROSE

It's red, poor thing.

BILL

Thank you.

ROSE

I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.

BILL

I can recommend someone.

ROSE

I feel better already.

BILL

God, I missed you.

ROSE

This time you won't miss.

ROSE

I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?

I want to get dressed up.

BILL

Right now ?

ROSE

Uh-huh.

In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.

Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see

ROSE

You're not eating. Don't you like my food?

BILL

I'd like your food five inches to the left.

ROSE

Okay.

But if you don't like this... I have something else for

you.

She laughs.

BILL

Yeah, okay.

ROSE

I think it's ready.

THE ARCHIVIST

It's a miracle. I found it.

Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.

That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,

about six years ago.

BILL

Does it say why?

THE ARCHIVIST

Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...

Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie

was 12.

No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple

years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until

recently.

BILL

What do you mean, "lost track" of them?

THE ARCHIVIST

Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.

Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children

of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and

there's two more down the hall.

Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,

BONNIE

Nobody's like your ex-husband!

SONDRA

That's for sure. That's for sure.

Okay, okay, okay.

BONNIE

Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it

great ?

SONDRA

I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.

ROSE

Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so

funny.

I think I should have got it in green or something.

ROSE

Oh ! Oh ! Lush !

What do you think?

SONDRA

I think... you look beautiful.

ROSE

You sure ?

SONDRA

Oh, yeah.

ROSE

Come zip me up.

SONDRA

Okay. Okay.

Oh, this is so tight.

ROSE

Thank you.

SONDRA

I need to find a new husband.

I need some more money.

ROSE

Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings

anywhere ?

SONDRA

Yes, I've got them.

ROSE

Oh, sweet !

Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?

SONDRA

They're so gorgeous, yes.

ROSE

Try yours on.

SONDRA

Okay.

ROSE

What now ? Sondra, what ?

SONDRA

I feel embarrassed.

ROSE

Why?

SONDRA

'Cause... the way you're looking at me.

ROSE

Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?

SONDRA

No... Yes... But it's different.

ROSE

You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at

all.

You better get that.

SONDRA

Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...

Um, mmm, okay.

N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You

are? Okay !...

Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a

minute !

SONDRA'S VOICE

Bye.

ROSE

Who's that?

SONDRA

That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.

ROSE

He what?

SONDRA

Oh, my God. He's coming over.

ROSE

Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !

SONDRA

What's the matter ? What ?

ROSE

Nothing !

If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a

nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.

SONDRA

Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay

here. Really.

ROSE

You just don't understand, do you?

SONDRA

I don't.

ROSE

Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use

you, and you don't even see it.

SONDRA

Oh, don't be upset.

ROSE

That's more like it. Ciao.

SONDRA

Oh, my God.

She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get

Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good

Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him,

BILL

Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.

SONDRA

Hi.

BILL

I didn't just walk in on my own.

SONDRA

Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend,

Bonnie. Yeah.

BILL

Bonnie. Yes.

SONDRA

Please, come in.

BILL

Thank you very much. Thank you.

This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.

SONDRA

You think so? Thank you.

BILL

A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.

SONDRA

What did you come here for?

BILL

Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to

do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with

Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything

that might help me... understand him a little better.

SONDRA

Richie's... my little baby.

BILL

His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should

be taken out of therapy.

SONDRA

That's insane!

BILL

I think it's a mistake too.

SONDRA

That Dale is a dangerous bastard.

BILL

But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.

There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year

ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?

SONDRA

I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did

you know that he was... molested as a child ?

BILL

No, I didn't know that.

It's sticking out all over.

SONDRA

It's fashionable.

I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a

book, go on Oprah.

BILL

That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie

has a violent streak ?

SONDRA

Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.

You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...

... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while

pretending to help your patients ?

BILL

You really think that I don't care about Richie ?

SONDRA

Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at

someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who

could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !

BILL

Clark ?

SONDRA

Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son

of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I

heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on

my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...

whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And

then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over

again.

We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes

She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.

Wow ! That's my trainer.

I gotta go. I gotta get the door.

This is my trainer, Chris.

BILL

Hi.

Bye-bye.

SONDRA

I don't feel like lifting weights today.

CHRIS

Okay.

SONDRA

Let's do something else.

Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the

Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the

Bill comes back the way he came toward the office. He stops in

Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men

BILL

Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?

The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.

Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.

Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are

BILL

Excuse me.

DALE

Hello. Did you go to the house?

BILL

Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...

I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone

number in our file.

DALE

No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?

BILL

After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another

psychiatrist ?

DALE

No. No, we moved.

Richie went to school. Everything was fine.

BILL

Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I

don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on

the brink.

DALE

A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they

just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain

is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.

BILL

What's the bullet ?

DALE

Whatever it was, I got him away.

BILL

You want to talk about that ?

DALE

No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let

the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's

gonna blow up in your face.

BILL

You think he's violent ?

DALE

Not with me.

BILL

I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time

to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's

get him someone else.

DALE

Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.

BILL

Yeah.

He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door

A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face

BILL

Mrs. Niedelmeyer?

EDITH

Yes.

BILL

Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through

the Psychiatric Institute.

EDITH

How very enterprising of you.

BILL

Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr.

Niedelmeyer.

EDITH

My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he

suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.

BILL

I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr.

Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie

Dexter.

EDITH

Why don't you leave me alone ?

BILL

If I could just ask you a few questions.

EDITH

You get out of here before I call the police !

BILL

Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...

EDITH

Get out of here !

CLARK

Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there

were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58

books on the shelf somehow.

BUCK

Clark... what's the ashtray situation ?

CLARK

Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and

five assorted sofas.

BUCK

Who cares ?

BILL

Okay, let's get started.

BUCK

... an emotional tar baby.

BILL

Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and

challenging topic.

SONDRA

Sex.

BILL

More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship...

in our life is often a symptom of our illness.

CASEY

Glad I wore my rubber pants.

BILL

We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over

every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic

wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change

your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ?

What's wrong ? What's missing ?

SONDRA

Now ?

BILL

You need a minute to think about it ?

CLARK

She's totally forgot her Rolodex.

Sorry, sorry.

SONDRA

Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The

last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man

thinks you're doing it with everybody.

BILL

He was jealous.

SONDRA

That's right. And I was as good as gold.

BILL

Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was

sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires

onto you.

SONDRA

This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in

his pants.

SONDRA

Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me

laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.

BILL

Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?

CASEY

Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted

every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever

seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter

how...

BUCK

I'll bet she does.

CASEY

That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem

comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you

study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a

transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could

ever, ever imagine.

BILL

How does this woman feel about you?

CASEY

She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But,

I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving

artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique

her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I

don't know what to do about that.

BILL

Do you think she loves you ?

CASEY

No. No.

BILL

Do you care, Casey ?

CASEY

I don't know. I don't know.

BUCK

He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.

CASEY

Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.

BILL

Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.

SONDRA

I agree.

BILL

Buck, what do you got?

BUCK

Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.

BILL

It's not a contest.

BUCK

Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ?

Thanks a lot.

Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray.

I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's

young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on

weekends.

I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married

to him.

BILL

Anything else you'd like to tell us?

BUCK

She doesn't mind the gray, you know.

She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through

my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I

could feel anything.

BILL

Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?

RICHIE

I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.

BILL

Okay. You want to talk about him?

RICHIE

H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l...

I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I

wish l-I had more of a l-life.

And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but

I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.

BILL

What would you like to be ?

RICHIE

I'd like t-to be a w-woman.

BILL

Have you seen a doctor ?

RICHIE

Yeah.

BUCK

So the next step is the chop.

BILL

Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us,

Richie ?

RICHIE

Nope.

BILL

Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your

partner ?

CLARK

Um, I think I'll pass... today.

SONDRA

Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you

think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ?

I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate

thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?

CLARK

Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s-

see how it's your business...

SONDRA

Your "little problems" ?

CLARK

To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.

SONDRA

Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this

is funny ?

Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair.

Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's

gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing.

Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal

coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking

problems are...

CLARK

Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And

if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black,

emotional hole, unattractive me !

BUCK

You can say that again !

CLARK

Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !

CASEY

Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?

BILL

Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting

everything.

CHILDREN

Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it !

CLARK

So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had

to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of

pages in each deposition.

BILL

So you were fired.

CLARK

Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave.

"Just please, please don't come back."

I do apologize for my outburst in group.

BILL

You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?

CLARK

I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra

is... A very warmhearted woman, but...

Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without

cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.

Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman

used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the

shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There

were 22 items I couldn't take.

BILL

It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to

your keen sense of order.

CLARK

I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.

She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except

for the faint smell of perfume.

BILL

Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?

CLARK

Take a look at this.

Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was

wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next

day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm

terrified to go near the woman.

BILL

Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.

THE VOICE IN THE PHONE

Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the

red car.

You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.

Shithead Capa.

BILL

Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?

THE VOICE IN THE PHONE

Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my

scalpel, Doctor.

BILL

Goddamn it !

Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road

The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of

Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and

To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and

The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches

BILL

Fuck you !

Fuck you!

Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...

When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on

Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a

Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?

Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car

Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.

There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others

HECTOR

I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey !

? Como esta? Gracias.

BILL

I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car

wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a

spooky feeling.

HECTOR

Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really

something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !

HECTOR

You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday

group ?

BILL

Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.

HECTOR

Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in

intensive care.

BILL

What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?

HECTOR

Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a

fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands

died of unnatural causes.

BILL

Probably lost some body fluids.

HECTOR

And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for

drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the

house on fire. So what do you think of that ?

BILL

I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.

THE VOICE

Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up

and your legs spread !

HECTOR

What the hell is this ?

THE VOICE

Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We

got something for you !

VOICES OF THE COPS

Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !

THE CROWD

For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good

fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !

For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !

People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.

BILL

If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by

tomorrow.

HECTOR

Me too.

Large shot on the orchestra singing.

ORCHESTRA

Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.

HECTOR

Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.

Ivengan a buscar el cake !

A MAN

Everybody inside !

BILL

How come you didn't mention Buck ?

HECTOR

There wasn't anything on him.

BUCK

You caught me at a bad time.

BILL

Can we get in out of the rain?

Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and

We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.

BUCK

Have a seat.

BILL

I don't like guns.

A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts

BUCK

Oh, shit !

BILL

Was it raining like this that night ?

BUCK

Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy

comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said,

"No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the

baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood,

nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other

car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes

wouldn't open. L...

Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy

rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull

my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head

for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my

daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They

got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.

BILL

Did they ever find out who did it ?

BUCK

No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But

that's a long story.

ANDERSON

Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?

BILL'S VOICE

It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ?

ANDERSON

Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case.

BILL

I need to talk to you.

ANDERSON

I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.

BILL

Okay.

ROSE

Hey.

Busy day ? Can I get you something ?

No ? Okay.

Oh! I forgot about that !

Bill's face still looks very shocked.

BILL

How did you get in here ?

ROSE

Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.

BILL

What about the alarm ?

ROSE

Oh ! I never thought about that.

BILL

It didn't go off ?

ROSE

No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the

car ?

BILL

No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are

getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's

goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to

you ?

ROSE

I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's

all. You don't look too happy to see me.

BILL

This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.

ROSE

I'm sorry.

BILL

I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise.

Really nice. I'm sorry.

ROSE

I'll never take a risk like that again.

BILL

Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...

your phone number.

ROSE

Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone

lines. I'm trying to run a business here.

BILL

General Patton comes out of the foothills.

Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.

Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in

the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.

Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !

ROSE

Oh.

BILL

Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.

ROSE

Yeah ?

BILL

It's goin' away.

ROSE

How's the submarine fleet ?

BILL

Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.

ROSE

Oh, you're chicken.

BILL

I gotta be up...

ROSE

You're chicken.

BILL

I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.

ROSE

You're chicken, chicken.

We hear Anderson and Bill in voice over.

ANDERSON

Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.

BILL

"Nobody," like Martinez ?

ANDERSON

Right.

BILL

That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.

ANDERSON

Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to

mess with.

BILL

What about Buck ?

ANDERSON

Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know

about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never

heard it from me, okay ?

Two, Angelo.

BILL

Why ?

ANDERSON

Why ?

Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?

ALEX

Right.

ANDERSON

Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my

career getting pissed on from above, okay ?

BILL

Okay.

ANDERSON

Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.

BILL

Holy shit.

ANDERSON

Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys

usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows

how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.

In the station, they had this big fight in front of

everybody.

Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.

BILL

Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?

ANDERSON

Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a

suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck

forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.

BILL

What do you think ?

ANDERSON

I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the

street. This was just payback

for both of 'em.

The phone rings. Casey doesn't move.

CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Hi, this is Casey. Can't get to the phone right now, but

please leave a message.

BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can

make it today. Are you there ?

CASEY

Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?

BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just

hang in there, okay ?

CASEY

Let me get this, huh ? No ?

BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30.

CASEY

Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?

Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom

BILL

Casey !

BILL

Casey !

BILL

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Casey ! Hey !

Casey!

He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are

A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,

Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings

He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on

He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable

BILL

Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !

ROSE

I love this song.

SONDRA

I know.

THE RED CAR PASSENGER

You girls want to go dancing ?

THE RED CAR DRIVER

Yeah. We're going to a party.

SONDRA

Hi ! Hi !...

THE RED CAR PASSENGER

Well, pardon me !

SONDRA

What are you doing ?

Wha... No!

Don't ! Don't !

SONG WORDS

Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did

And she did it real good. Once was not enough.

SONDRA

Ah !

ROSE

Sondra, go !

SONG WORDS

Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.

SONDRA

Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.

ROSE

Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !

SONDRA

Oh, my God !

ROSE

These are your neighbors !

SONDRA

They do this all the time.

SONDRA

Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!

ROSE

They're gonna see you !

SONDRA

Oh, I don't believe it !

ROSE

Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !

SONDRA

Oh, my gosh !

ROSE

Oh !

SONDRA

Believe me, they can fuck.

Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.

ROSE

Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.

SONDRA

Yeah.

Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,

ROSE

Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !

SONDRA

Oh, what are they doing now ?

ROSE

I can't tell.

SONDRA

Are they gonna do it ? No !

ROSE

My God ! It's gonna happen right now.

SONDRA

Ow !

ROSE

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Oh, champagne.

SONDRA

Mmm.

We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under

ROSE

No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.

SONDRA

Why ? It's wonderful.

ROSE

Sondra, I'm a jinx.

SONDRA

No. We can cancel each other out.

ROSE

No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with

somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.

SONDRA

Look, the sky isn't falling down.

ROSE

Yes, it is.

SONDRA

No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love

your brown hair.

BILL

Who is it ?

ROSE'S VOICE

I'm back.

BILL

Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making

her look even younger than she is.

She falls into his arms. And they kiss.

ROSE

Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if

you'd be in.

BILL

I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.

ROSE

Yeah ?

So, what color are my nipples ?

ROSE

Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.

BILL

Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better

than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I

mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you

do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all

the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.

ROSE

You do ?

BILL

Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I

wait for" department, you're it.

ROSE

Oh, my.

BILL

Bob's wife. My ex-wife.

ROSE

She's pretty.

BILL

Pretty fucked up.

Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.

ROSE

He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these

taken ?

BILL

Ten years ago.

ROSE

Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?

BILL

Maybe. Hold on.

I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except

maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which

leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead

as they were pretending.

I don't know who these people are.

ROSE

No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go

outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?

BILL

One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.

ROSE

What ?

BILL

The painter. Casey.

ROSE

Were you there ?

BILL

A little bit after.

ROSE

What did you see ?

BILL

You don't want to know.

About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You

gonna be okay out here ?

ROSE

Yeah.

BILL

Rose.

ROSE

Oh ! Oh !

BILL

Rose ! Rose !

BILL

Rose ! Jesus !

BILL

2ASB... 185...

A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid

VOICE OF THE ANGRY WOMAN

Oh ! Stupid, crazy bastard ! They'll give anybody a

license !

CLARK

Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that

will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will

be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that

makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really

odd. Now there's 59 again.

BILL

What ?

CLARK

Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf

where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and

this week there are 59 again, so I don't...

BILL

Which one, Sondra ?

SONDRA

I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got

it home. I couldn't help myself.

BILL

Which one, Sondra ?

SONDRA

It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly,

I promise !

CLARK

What did I do ?

BOB'S VOICE

I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This

cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's

monster. Today's the day.

BILL

Hi.

BUCK

Hi, Bill.

BILL

Hi, Buck.

Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think

we should get started.

BUCK

That's typical.

Oh, shit!

CLARK

Buck, are you all right ?

BUCK

It's none of your fucking business.

SONDRA

You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.

CLARK

I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the

group and Sondra.

Everything that you said last week in group was right, and

that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I

mentioned last week... that relationship has been

terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...

and told me, and that's it.

BILL

"The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a

normal character together, can become anything. Amorality

frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon

with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize...

recognize this woman ?

SONDRA

Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.

BUCK

Give me that !

This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ?

SONDRA

Yeah. Yeah.

BUCK

The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ?

This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your

shopping mall hag ?

SONDRA

Shut up.

BUCK

The one that makes you smile ?

SONDRA

Shut up !

BUCK

The one that you wish was a man ?

SONDRA

What are you getting at, Buck ?

BUCK

That Bonnie ? Is that it ?

SONDRA

That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.

BUCK

Sondra... this is my Bonnie.

SONDRA

You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I

don't believe you !

CLARK

Let me see that.

BUCK

Fuckin' A !

CLARK

Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been

talking about. This is my Bonnie.

Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that !

BUCK

Hey, hey, hey !

SONDRA

You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?

CLARK

Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child !

BUCK

Goddamn tar baby !

SONDRA

You're making it up ! You're making it up !

CLARK

Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop

it !

SONDRA

Stop it !

CLARK

Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to

stop showing off ! You're a little brat !

BUCK

Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup !

CLARK

You calm down, and you stop...

SONDRA

Where's the picture ?

HECTOR

How in the name of God... could all of you be going out

with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ?

Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention

Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself

in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the

Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this

woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of

your names are included... so you can all share in the

glory.

BILL

Well, you should know something about sharing, huh,

Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very

tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you

tell me the truth ?

HECTOR

What truth is that ?

BILL

Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a

suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.

HECTOR

Because... I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell

you shit !

BILL

That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell

me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some

fucking truth ?

BUCK

Get the fuck out of here !

BILL

One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?

HECTOR

You really know how to pick your women, you know that ?

BILL

I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit !

You can't fuckin' do it !

BUCK

Listen. After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this

cock-sucker !

SONDRA

Don't ! No more !

BUCK

But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a

bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ?

Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her.

So I forgave him instead.

HECTOR

All right ! So much for the famous fucking Monday group !

Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no

address. Now the cops need your help. What about the car ?

Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers ?

BUCK

"The license plates numbers" ?

SONDRA

We didn't even...

HECTOR

Huh ?

SONDRA

Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.

HOTEL ATTENDANT

Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.

HOTEL FEMALE GUEST

Thanks. Put my bags in my room.

BILL

Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.

HOTEL ATTENDANT

Dr. Ashland ? In the health club.

BILL

I don't think she is a sociopath.

LARRY

Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a

multiple personality disorder ? You've fallen into a trap.

You are not well. She is not well. And to you, Iit feels

like a bond.

BILL

She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way

for her to have a life.

LARRY

Or lives.

LARRY

You really want to go on seeing her, do you ?

BILL

Yes, I want to see her.

LARRY

In a, a nonprofessional sense ?

BILL

In every sense.

LARRY

I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that

two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect.

Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men.

BILL

Is that what I'm doing?

BILL

Anderson ! I need your help with something.

ANDERSON

Hey, man, how ya doin'?

BILL

I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out

the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a

space right in front of mine.

ANDERSON

A beautiful woman ?

BILL

Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the

headlight on my car.

ANDERSON

Uh-oh. Drives away, right ?

BILL

I don't even think she knew what she did.

ANDERSON

But you'd like to meet her ?

All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license

number ?

BILL

Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.

ANDERSON

Sure.

As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the

Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking

Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the

The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,

BILL

Damn !

HECTOR

I ought to shoot you!

ANDERSON

I came to make amends.

HECTOR

So make 'em, loudmouth !

ANDERSON

I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong

to our mystery lady.

BILL

Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.

EDITH

You leave me alone ! Get away from here !

BILL

I need your help, please !

EDITH

Why are you torturing me like this ?

BILL

Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !

The house is very heavily decorated.

BILL

I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He

was stabbed with a knife...

EDITH

You get out of my house !

BILL

... 38 times in the chest !

EDITH

You-You go away!

BILL

Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be

next !

EDITH

Go away !

BILL

I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What

are you hiding from me ? What is it ?

EDITH

Nothing.

BILL

Put that phone down.

EDITH

I'm calling the police !

BILL

Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !

EDITH

Please ! What kind of twisted creature are you ? I've never

done anything to you.

BILL

My patient Richie is involved...

EDITH

Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?

BILL

If you just help me...

EDITH

Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.

BILL

Why ?

EDITH

Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to

him.

He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I

mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.

BILL

What about the family ?

EDITH

He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were

alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,

Rose.

Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car

Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.

He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with

Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.

He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood

When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the

BILL

Richie.

Jesus Christ !

What did he... What did he do to you ?

RICHIE

W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away

from me.

BILL

Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose.

I need her.

ROSE

Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !

BILL

Where's Dale ?

ROSE

L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he

is.

BILL

Was this your idea, to become Richie ?

ROSE

No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.

BILL

What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.

ROSE

When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,

"Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name

is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And

he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did

things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I

was Richie from then on.

BILL

What happened to Rose ?

ROSE

After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.

BILL

And you had to come to group.

ROSE

They were our world. They were our family.

BILL

But then what ? Rose started coming back ?

ROSE

No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie

was first.

BILL

Oh, honey.

ROSE

Help me, please ! Help me.

BILL

Jesus! Oh, my God !

Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !

That crazy bastard !

ROSE

Oh, God !

BILL

Rose !

ROSE

Get away f-from me!

BILL

Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !

ROSE

I never get to be out a-anymore.

BILL

Rose. Come on.

ROSE

And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.

It did. It did.

BILL

I know. Come on, let's go.

Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.

Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

ROSE

Oh !

DALE

Back up!

ROSE

No ! No, Dale, don't !

BILL

Get back ! Get back !

ROSE

Dale, no !

DALE

Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.

Deadly.

HECTOR

Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it

in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !

BILL

What are you doing here, Martinez ?

HECTOR

Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !

That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let

that be your psych lesson for the day !

HECTOR

Go ! Run !

BILL

Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !

ROSE

No ! No !

HECTOR

Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !

We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,

Bill moves Rose away from him...

BILL

Let's go!

ROSE

No ! Get out !

DALE

Come on ! Come on !

BILL

You fucking son of a bitch !

You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little

brother killed.

DALE

No !

BILL

You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.

DALE

No, I saved him !

BILL

You knew what was happening...

DALE

I didn't know !

BILL

Because it happened to you before !

DALE

Would you goddamn shut up ?

BILL

Could have saved your little brother, but he killed

himself.

DALE

Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !

BILL

You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !

DALE

Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,

but I put a stop to that.

BILL

Yeah, you did.

Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?

DALE

Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't

keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and

pushin'. Huh ?

BILL

Why'd you do it, Dale ?

DALE

Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking

out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after

night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...

gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed

old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.

- And now...

I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.

BILL

The inspiration of madness, Dale.

DALE

The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.

DALE

Richie.

ROSE

My name is... My name is Rose.

No ! No !

No !

No !

BILL

Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !

BILL

Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !

A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill

Wait ! Rose!

ROSE

Don't !

BILL

For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !

ROSE

No !

BILL

Rose ! Stop !

BILL

No ! No. No !

BILL

Wait !

ROSE

Why ?

BILL

Rose ! No ! Stop, please !

Just stay there !

ROSE

It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.

BILL

If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.

ROSE

Why would you do that ?

BILL

Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.

Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in

dying. Come on.

ROSE

Oh, Capa.

BILL

Come on.

ROSE

L... No...

BILL

No !

ROSE

Capa !

No !

BILL

Come on.

HECTOR'S VOICE

Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me

hanging here all night, huh ?

Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking

Band-Aids !

Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !
