SAILOR

(into phone)

...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk

to Lula?

CUT TO:

MARIETTA

Theres no way in hell you can speak

to her and...

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(feeling a smile coming on)

What?...

CUT TO:

MARIETTA

...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever

call back here again.

LULA

Mama???

MARIETTA

You know who it was and you know

LULA

(quietly)

Like hell.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TEENAGERS

EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

CUT TO:

BEANY

I can dig this music...  But not

that singer.

LULA

Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

BEANY

Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and

beer guts aint quite my type.

LULA

(giggles)

Seeins how youre about as thick as

a used string of unwaxed dental floss,

dont know how you can criticize.

BEANY

Yeah, well, if he says that all that

flab turns into dick at midnight,

hes a liar.

BEANY

So, Sailors gettin out soon, and

youre gonna see him?

LULA

Meetin him at the gate.  That phone

call this afternoon was the signal.

My deranged mamas hid the keys to

my car.  But of course, I know

exactly where they are.

BEANY

I didnt hate me so much, Id feel

better wishin you luck.

LULA

Cant all husbands be perfect, and

your Elmo probly wouldnta ever

got that second one pregnant, you

hadnt kicked his ass out.

BEANY

So youre gonna be needin the

blue-bird pretty soon?

LULA

Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap

tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

MARIETTA

Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.

BARTENDER

Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.

MARIETTA

(slightly hysterical)

Well I gotta find him - right this

minute!

CUT TO:

LULA

Hey baby...

SAILOR

Peanut...

SAILOR

Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,

baby...  Did I ever tell you that

this here jacket for me is a symbol

of my individuality and my belief

in personal freedom?

LULA

Bout fifty thousand times.  I got

us a room at the Cape Fear, and

guess what?...  I hear Powermads

at The Hurricane.

SAILOR

(smiling)

Stab it and steer.

CUT TO:

LULA

Did you ever think somethin like

about the wicked witch of the east

comin flyin in?...  Did you ever

think somethin and then later think

youve said it out loud to someone?

SAILOR

I really did miss your mind while I

was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The

rest of you, too, of course.  But

the way your head works is Gods own

private mystery.  What was it you

was thinkin?

LULA

Well, I was thinkin about smokin

actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros

now, used to be she smoked Kools?

I stole em from her beginnin in

about sixth grade.  When I got old

enough to buy my own, I bought those.

Now Ive just about settled on Mores,

as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.

SAILOR

I guess I started smokin when I was

about six...  My mama was already

dead from lung cancer...

LULA

What brandd she smoke?

SAILOR

Camels, same as me...  Guess both

my mama and my daddy died of smoke

or alcohol related illness.

LULA

Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I

never would have guessed it.

SAILOR

Its okay.  I hardly used to see

them anyway.  I didnt have much

parental guiding.  The public defender

kept sayin that at my parole hearin.

He was a good ol boy, stood by me...

Even brought me some cartons of

cigarettes from time to time.

LULA

Id stand by you, Sailor ... through

anything.

SAILOR

Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after

I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant

ask for more than that.

LULA

You move me, Sailor, you really do.

You mark me the deepest.

SAILOR

Youre perfect for me, too.

LULA

You remind me of my daddy, you know?

Mama told me he liked skinny women

whose breasts were just a bit too

big for their bodies.  He had a long

nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever

tell you how he died?

SAILOR

In a fire, as I recall.

LULA

Started he couldnt remember things?

Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin

me it was on account of lead poisoning

from cleanin the old paint off our

house without usin a mask...  But

I dont know.  Seems like his brain

just fell apart in pieces.

CUT TO:

CLYDE

FUCKIN BITCH!!!!

CUT TO:

LULA

Finally in the middle of the one

night, with me and mama asleep

upstairs ... he poured kerosene over

himself and lit a match.

CUT TO:

LULA

(voice-over)

Near burned down the house.  We

got out just in time.

CUT TO:

LULA

It was a year before I met you.

SAILOR

You have such a pretty, long neck,

like a swan.

LULA

Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth

white neck.  It was like on a

statue it was so white?

CUT TO:

MARIETTA

I knew this would happen.  Soon as

that piece of filth got out of

Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble.

Hes just got some kind of influence

over her I cant decipher.  Theres

somethin wild in Lula I dont know

where it comes from.  You gotta find

em, Johnnie.

JOHNNIE

He served his time for what he did.

Another thing...  If Lula went with

him of her own volition - willingly,

that is - there aint much can be

done about it.

MARIETTA

Dont talk down to me, Johnnie

Farragut.  I know what volition means,

and thats why I want Sailor Ripley

off the planet!  Hes pure slime and

its leakin all over my baby.

Maybe you could push him into makin

some kinda move and then kill him

dead.  Youd only be defendin

yourself, and with his record,

nobodyd fuss.

JOHNNIE

Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if

shes with the Ripley boy, Ill

give him a talkin to and try to

convince her to come back with me.

Thats about all I can do.

MARIETTA

Ill hire a hit man if you dont want

to help me stop this thing.  Ill

call Marcello Santos.

JOHNNIE

Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.

And dont be gettin carried away.

You dont want to be bringin Santos

and his people into it.

MARIETTA

Youre just jealous of Santos cause

hes sweet on me.

JOHNNIE

Darlin, you aint seein Santos

again, are ya?

MARIETTA

Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you

trust your very own Marietta?

JOHNNIE

Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love

with you like I am brings out that

ugly jealous side.

MARIETTA

Well stop worryin about me and

start worryin about how youre

gonna get that Lula back here and

away from that murderer.

JOHNNIE

Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to

get off that kick.  And fars I can

tell, Sailor was entire clean prior

to that involvin Lula.  Even there

he was protectin her.  You oughta

be thankin him for that.  That Bob

Ray Lemon they say was comin after

the both of em.  Why am I tellin

you this, you was around that night.

You ought to know just exactly what

happened.  Sailor just got a little

too forceful is all...  You remember

that night...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARIETTA

Maybe I was there, but I didnt see

anythin.  All I knows that trash

killed a man with his bare hands.

Hands which are now probly all

over my baby!

JOHNNIE

Marietta, settle down now darlin...

I want whats best for her, too -

Like I said, Ill do what I can to

bring her home.

CUT TO:

LULA

Sailor, you are somethin else,

honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama

told me that pretty soon Id be

startin to think about sex, and

I should talk to her before I did

anything about it.

SAILOR

But honey, I thought you told me

your Uncle Pooch raped you when

you was thirteen.

LULA

Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt

really an uncle.  He was a business

partner of my daddys?  And my mama

never knew nothin about me and

him - thats for damn sure.  His real

name was somethin kind of European,

like Pucinski.  But everyone just

called him Pooch.  He came around the

house sometimes when Daddy was away.

I always figured he was sweet on

mama, so when he cornered me one

afternoon, I was surprised moren

a little.

SAILOR

Howd it happen, peanut?  He just

pull out the old toad and let it

croak?

LULA

Youre terrible crude sometimes,

Sailor, you know?

SAILOR

I cant hardly understand you when

you talk with one of them Mores in

your mouth.

LULA

I said you can be too crude sometimes?

I dont think I care for it.

SAILOR

Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how

old Pooch done the deed.

LULA

Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin

her hair dyed?  And I was alone in

the house.

CUT TO:

LULA

(voice-over)

Uncle Pooch came in the side door

through the porch, you know?  Where

I was makin a jelly and banana

sandwich?  I remember I had my hair

in curlers cause I was goin that

night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the

DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have

known nobody but me was home, cause

he came right in and put both his

hands on my butt and sorta shoved me

up against the counter.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Didnt he say somethin?

LULA

Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

SAILOR

So howd he finally nail you?  Right

there in the kitchen?

LULA

No, he picked me up.

CUT TO:

LULA

(voice-over)

He was short but powerful.  With

hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me

into the maids dayroom which nobody

used.  We did it there on an old bed.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt

he force you?

LULA

Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,

you know?  I mean, he raped me and

all, but I guess theres all

different kinds of rapes.  I didnt

exactly want him to do it but I

suppose once it started, it didnt

seem all that terrible.  It was over

pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch

just stood there and pulled up his

trousers and left me there.  I

stayed in bed till I heard him drive

off.  Then I just went back into

the kitchen and finished makin my

sandwich.

SAILOR

And you never told nobody about it?

LULA

Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted

strange or different after.  And he

never did anything else to me.  I

always got a nice present from him

at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?

(pause)

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LULA

Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three

years later while he was holidayin

in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way

too much traffic there for my taste...

And another thing, baby...  That

government of ours should be keepin

us separated from outer space...

SAILOR

Here she goes again...

LULA

Sailor, that ozone layer is

disappearin.  Seems to me the

government could do somethin about

it.  One of these mornings the

sunll come up and burn a hole clean

through the planet like an X-Ray.

SAILOR

(laughs)

That aint never will happen, honey.

Least not in our lifetime.

SAILOR

You okay, honey?

LULA

That womans laugh creeps me out.

I heard somethin like that...

somewhere before...  Soundd like

the wicked witch...

SAILOR

Just sounded like an old gal havin

a good time to me...  You ready to

dance?

LULA

Im always ready to dance.  But I

need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

CUT TO:

SANTOS

I knew youd want it again...

MARIETTA

Thats not why I called.

SANTOS

Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

MARIETTA

Santos...  It isnt.

SANTOS

Have it your way...  But you want it.

MARIETTA

Lulas gone off with Sailor.

SANTOS

What do you want me to do about it?

MARIETTA

I want you to take care of Sailor, so

he wont ever be able to bother my

baby again.

SANTOS

Take care of him?

MARIETTA

Yes.

SANTOS

What does take care of him mean?...

Do you want me to give him food or

some clothing?

MARIETTA

Whats with you?...  You know what

take care of him means.  I dont

call Santos except for one big reason.

SANTOS

Big is the key word, and Im telling

you I want it bad.

MARIETTA

I want you to get rid of Sailor.

SANTOS

Get rid of him?

MARIETTA

Yes...  Get rid of him.

SANTOS

How would I do that?  Send him on a

trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

MARIETTA

Santos, why in hell do you insist on

playin this stupid game?

SANTOS

Just tell me what you want.

MARIETTA

I dont need to explain anymoren I

have...  You know damn well.

SANTOS

You need to explain it.

MARIETTA

All right...  I want you ... to ...

kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

SANTOS

Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

MARIETTA

Thats your business...  I dont care

how.

SANTOS

Like an accident where maybe Lula

might also get hurt?

MARIETTA

NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

SANTOS

Well, like kill him with the atomic

bomb?

MARIETTA

Santos...

SANTOS

Explain it...  I told you.

MARIETTA

Shoot him.

SANTOS

Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

MARIETTA

Yes.

SANTOS

Where?...  In the leg?

MARIETTA

No.

SANTOS

Where?

MARIETTA

In the head.

SANTOS

Shoot Sailor in the head with a

gun...  Now Im beginning to get

it...  You want me to shoot Sailor

in the head with a gun.

MARIETTA

Yes.

SANTOS

But where in the head?...  Not the

chin, I hope.

MARIETTA

No...  In the brains...  What little

Im sure he has.

SANTOS

You want me to shoot Sailor in the

brains with a gun.

MARIETTA

Yes.

SANTOS

Through the forehead?

MARIETTA

Yes.

SANTOS

Wrong!  Its much better to blow a

hole in the back of the head ...

right toward the bridge of the nose

...  Lots and lots of irreparable

damage.

MARIETTA

See!  I knew you had it all under

control.

SANTOS

Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

MARIETTA

Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...

Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that

town.

SANTOS

On one condition...

SANTOS

You give me your permission to kill

Johnnie Farragut.

MARIETTA

(whisper)

Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

SANTOS

Youre not tellin me that youre

sweet on him?

MARIETTA

No...  But...

SANTOS

One day hes gonna find out what

were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and

he could cause us a lot of trouble.

SANTOS

Im gonna take your silence as a

yes...

MARIETTA

Santos...  I cant...

SANTOS

Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I

either take you or that pretty

daughter of yours to bed.

MARIETTA

You fucker, dont you ever touch

Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

SANTOS

(laughing)

Put your shoulders back.

MARIETTA

What?

SANTOS

Put your shoulders back, I said.

SANTOS

You got nice tits.

MARIETTA

Someones gonna see us.

SANTOS

(smiling as he starts

to feel her breasts)

Thats just another part of the price

to pay.

MARIETTA

Santos...  You kill that Sailor,

otherwise hes gonna turn my baby

against me.

SANTOS

Look at me...  Theres no turning back

on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor...

Thats for sure.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Are you going to provide me with an

opportunity to prove my love to my

girl?  Or are you gonna save

youself some trouble and step up

like a gentleman and apologize to her?

IDIOT PUNK

Dont fuck with me, man.  You look

like a clown in that stupid jacket.

SAILOR

This is a snakeskin jacket, and for

me its a symbol of my individuality

and my belief in personal freedom.

IDIOT PUNK

...Asshole.

SAILOR

(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)

Come here.

LULA

Sailor, honey...

SAILOR

(helping him up)

Im sorry to do this to ya here

in front of a crowd, but I want ya

to stand up and make a nice apology

to my girl.

IDIOT PUNK

(to Lula)

Im sorry.

LULA

Hell, you just rubbed up against

the wrong girl is all.

SAILOR

Thats good...  Now go get yourself

a beer.

(turning to the band)

You fellas have alotta the same power

Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

LULA

Why didnt ya sing Love Me Tender?

...  You told me that was your

favorite love song.

SAILOR

Cause Im only gonna sing that song

to my wife.

LULA

What you want to watch this trash for?

Aint one of those people have a real

thought in their brain.

SAILOR

That so?

(keeping his gaze on the TV)

You want to tell me what, if any,

real thoughts you had lately?

LULA

What you have to get personal about

so quick?  All I mean is you could

possibly read a book.

LULA

Whats that honey?

SAILOR

We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee,

baby, you know?

LULA

Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some

moments where all you been the last

two years.

SAILOR

Twenty-three months, eighteen days is

all.  Dont need to make moren it

was.

(referring to Dating Game show)

This couples goin on a date to

Hawaii.  The girl chose him over the

other two guys.

LULA

Dont the reject guys get anythin?

SAILOR

Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried

Chicken.

LULA

That dont seem fair.

SAILOR

Hell, why should the Datin Game be

different from real life?  At least

them boys is gonna get somethin to

eat.

LULA

Sailor?

SAILOR

Yeah?

LULA

Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow

stayed in love for the rest of our

lives?

SAILOR

(laughing)

You think of the weirdest damn things

to say sometimes, peanut.  Aint we

been doin a pretty fair job this far?

LULA

Oh, you know exactly what I mean,

honey?  Itd make the future so simple

and nice.

SAILOR

At Pee Dee, all you think about is

the future, you know?  Gettin out?

And what youll do and what youll

think about when youre on the

outside again.

LULA

I just think about things as they

come up.  I never been much of a planner.

SAILOR

It aint altogether terrible just to

let things go along sometimes.

Lula, I done a few things in my life

I aint too proud of, but Ill tell

ya from now on I aint gonna do

nothin for no good reason.  All I

know for sure is theres moren a

few bad ideas runnin around loose

out there.

LULA

You know theres somethin I aint

never told you about, Sailor, and

this heres a story with the lesson

that theres a right time and a

wrong time for things to happen...

When I was almost sixteen I got pregnant.

SAILOR

Musta been a lesson tellin ya it

was the wrong time...  What did you

do, your mama find out?

LULA

(nods)

She got me an abortion...

LULA

(voice-over)

...from some old doctor with the

hairiest nostrils and ears I ever seen.

LULA

(voice-over)

Afterwards...  Momma says...

LULA

(voice-over)

...I hope you appreciate my spendin

six hundred dollars, not countin

what it cost us to get here and

back...  This mans the best damn

abortionist in the South.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

You tell the boy who knocked you up?

LULA

It was my cousin, Dell, done it?  His

folks used to visit with us summers.

SAILOR

What happened to him?

LULA

Oh, nothin.  I never let on to mama

about Dell bein the one.  I just

flat refused to tell her who the

daddy was?  I didnt tell Dell, neither.

He was back home in Chattanooga by then,

anyhow, and I didnt see the point.

Somethin terrible happened to him,

though.  Six months ago.

SAILOR

Whats that, peanut?

LULA

Dell disappeared.  Dell was learnin

a hard lesson.  What I learned from

observin Dell is I think people who

are frightened want to disappear.

Hed startin behavin weird?  Like

comin up to people every fifteen

minutes and askin how they were

doin?

CUT TO:

DELL

Howre ya doin?

CUT TO:

LULA

And just seemin real spacey and

actin funny.

SAILOR

Actin funny how?

LULA

Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie,

Dells mama?  She found cockroaches

in Dells underwear.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LULA

One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell

puttin one big cockroach on his anus?

SAILOR

Hell, peanut...

LULA

One time - real late - like about two

thirty a.m.?  She found Dell up in

the black of night all dressed and

makin sandwiches in the kitchen.

CUT TO:

AUNT ROOTIE

Whatre ya doin?

DELL

Makin my lunch!!!

LULA

(voice-over)

Dell told her he was makin his

lunch and goin to work.  Hes a

welder?  And she made him go back

to bed.

CUT TO:

LULA

Then hed carry on about the weather?

Talk about how rainfalls controlled by

aliens livin on earth.  Also how men

wearin black leather gloves...

CUT TO:

LULA

(voice-over)

...are followin him around.

SAILOR

Probly the rain boys from Outer Space.

CUT TO:

LULA

It aint so funny now, though.  December

before Christmas?  Dell disappeared

again and Aunt Rootie hired a private

eye to find him.  He was missin for

almost a month before he wandered back

in the house on mornin dressed in some

filthy Santa Claus suit.

CUT TO:

LULA

(voice-over)

The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over

a thousand dollars?  Then a little

while later Dell ran off a third

time to some place he said would

give him peace of mind.  Nobodys

seen him since.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Sound like ol Dells moren just a

little confused, peanut...  Too

bad he couldnt visit that ol

Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.

LULA

Too bad we all cant, baby...  One

thing about Dell?

SAILOR

Whats that?

LULA

When he was about seventeen, he

startin losin his hair.

SAILOR

So?

LULA

Hes twenty-four now?  A year older

than you?  And must be bout bald.

SAILOR

Theres worse things that can happen

to a man, honey.

LULA

Yeah, I suppose.  But you know somethin

baby, hair does make a difference.

LULA

I sure am glad they didnt give you

no prison haircut...

(sexual whisper)

Gives me somethin to grab hold of

while were makin love?

SAILOR

Lets go dancin, peanut.  Im

ready.

LULA

We gotta be careful, honey, my mamas

gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us

like a duck on a june bug, and hes

one clever detective?  You know how

clever?  He once told me that he

could find an honest man in Washington.

My toenails gotta dry first anyways,

Sailor.

SAILOR

One thing puzzles my mind, sugar...

Youre twenty years old - arent

you ever curious why your mama has

this fixation on keepin us apart?

Puttin a detective on us.  Ill tell

ya Lula...  Well...  Its moren me

killin Bob Ray Lemon...

LULA

Maybe my mama cares for me just a

little too much...

SAILOR

Yeah, maybe...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARIETTA

Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lulas

mama?...

SAILOR

No.

MARIETTA

Well, she wants to fuck you.

OLD MAN

(covering his eyes from

seeing them)

Lousy fuckin homosexuals...

SAILOR

(instantly pulling away

from Marietta)

What are you, sick?...  Im with Lula.

MARIETTA

No...  I just wanted to kiss you

good-bye...  You know too much bout

little Lulas mom...

SAILOR

Whattya mean?

MARIETTA

Well, Johnnie told me you used to

drive for Clyde and Santos...

SAILOR

So?

MARIETTA

So maybe one night you got a little

too close to the fire...  And youre

gonna get burned, baby...  And

besides that, youre shit...  Dyou

think Id let my little girl go with

shit like you?...  Why, you belong

right here in one of these toilets.

SAILOR

Youre gonna have to kill me to keep

me away from Lula.

MARIETTA

Oh, dont worry bout that...

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Its a problm I dont thinks gonna

go away too soon though...  Peanut,

Im thinkin of breakin parole and

takin you out to sunny California.

LULA

Sailor!

SAILOR

You up for that?

LULA

Id got to the far end of the world

for you, baby...  You know I would.

SAILOR

Those toenails dry yet?  We got some

dancin to do.

CUT TO:

LULA

...Thats an awful long way to go,

just to get some pussy.

SAILOR

Yeah, I had my first taste on that

trip to Juarez.  At that age you

still got a lot of energy.

LULA

You still got plenty energy for

me, baby.

LULA

Take a picture, bitch...  Itll

last longer.

GIRL

Oh yeah?

LULA

Ill slap those eyes right outta

your head.

LULA

Sorry, baby...  Whens the first

time you done it with a girl who

wasnt hookin?

SAILOR

Maybe two, three months after Juarez.

I was visitin my cousin, Junior

Train, in Savannah, and we were at

some kids house whose parents were

out of town.  A girl comes up to me

that was real tall, taller than me.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(voice-over)

She looked right at me and run her

tongue over her lips and put her

hand on my arm - told me her name

was Irma.

CUT TO:

LULA

Whatd you say to her?

SAILOR

Told her my name.  Then she said

somethin like, Its so noisy

down here.  Why dont we go

upstairs so we can hear ourselves?

She turned around and led the way.

I knew I had an important lesson

to learn that day.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(voice-over)

When she got almost to the top step

I stuck my hand between her legs

from behind.

CUT TO:

LULA

Oh, baby.  What a bad boy you are!

SAILOR

(laughing)

Thats just what she said.  I had

a boner with a capital O.  I

went to kiss her but she broke off

laughin and ran down the hallway.

I found her lyin on a bed in a room

filled with assault weapons and

Penthouse magazines.  She was a wild

chick.  She was wearin bright orange

pants with kind of Spanish lookin lacy

black stripes down the sides.  You

know, them kind that doesnt go all

the way down your leg?

LULA

You mean like pedal pushers?

SAILOR

I guess.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(voice-over)

She just rolled over onto her stomach

and stuck her ass up in the air.  I

slid my hand between her legs and

she closed her thighs on it.

CUT TO:

LULA

Youre excitin me, honey.  Whatd

she do?

SAILOR

Her face was half-pushed into the

pillow, and she looked back over

her shoulder at me and said, I

wont suck you.  Dont ask me to

suck you.

LULA

Poor baby.  She dont know what she

missed.  What color hair she have?

SAILOR

Sorta brown, blonde, I guess.  But

dig this, sweetie.  Then she turns

over, peels off them orange pants,

and spreads her legs real wide and

says to me...

CUT TO:

IRMA

(her smiling face)

Take a bite of peach.

CUT TO:

LULA

(howls)

Jesus, honey!  You moren sorta

got what you come for...  You

better rum me back to the hotel,

baby...  You got me hottern

Georgia asphalt.

SAILOR

Say no more...  But go easy on me,

sweetheart...  Tomorrow we got alotta

drivin to do.

(he takes out a cigarette and laughs)

Hottern Georgia asphalt?

CUT TO:

LULA

Ill drop mama a postcard from

somewhere.  I mean, I dont want her

to worry no moren necessary.

SAILOR

What do you mean by necessary?  Shes

probly already called the cops, my

parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend

Johnnie Farragut.

LULA

I suppose so.  She knew I was bound

to see you soon as you was sprung,

but I dont figure she counted on

us takin off together like this...

I guess this means youre breakin

parole, then?

SAILOR

You guess?  My parole was broke two

hundred miles back when we burnt

Portagee County.

LULA

Whatll it be like in California,

Sailor, do you think?  I hear it

dont rain much there.

SAILOR

You got about six more big states

to go before we find out.

LULA

We got through two states already.

SAILOR

That dont smell like a More.

LULA

It aint.  Its part of the lessons

of life.  I picked me up a pack of

Vantages before we left the Cape?

SAILOR

They sure do stink.

LULA

Yeah, I guess, but - and heres the

lesson part - they aint supposed

to be so bad for you.

SAILOR

You aint gonna begin worryin about

whats bad for you at this hour, are

you, sugar?  I mean, here you are

crossin state lines with a A-

Number One certified murderer.

LULA

Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer.

Dont exaggerate.

SAILOR

Okay, manslaughterer whos broke his

parole and got in mind nothin but

immoral purposes fars youre

concerned.

LULA

Thank the Lord.  Well, you aint let

me down yet, Sailor.  Thats moren

I can say for the rest of the world?

SAILOR

You please me, too, peanut.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Life is a bitch and then you marry one.

LULA

What kinda trash talk is that?

SAILOR

(laughs)

What it says on the bumper sticker

up front.  On that pickup.

LULA

Thats disgustin.  Those kinda

sentiments shouldnt be allowed out

in public.  Is this Biloxi yet?

SAILOR

Almost.  I figure we should find us

a place to stay and then go eat.

LULA

Got anyplace special in mind?

SAILOR

We oughta stay somewhere outta the

way.  Not in no Holidays or Ramadas

or Motel Six.  If Johnnie Farraguts

on our trail hell check those first.

LULA

How about that one?  The Host of

the Old South Hotel.

SAILOR

Looks more like the Ghost of the

Old South, but well try her.

CUT TO:

LULA

I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads.  They

dont hardly never get washed, and

I dont like the idea of lyin on

other peoples dirt.

SAILOR

Come look at this.

LULA

(going to the window)

Whats that, honey?

SAILOR

(thinking about death)

There aint no water in the swimmin

pool.  Just a dead tree fell in,

probly from bein struck by lightnin.

LULA

(thinking about granddad)

Its huge.  This musta been a grand

old place at one time.

SAILOR

Lets get fed, sweetheart.  The

lights fadin fast.

CUT TO:

SANTOS

Hello there, Mr. Reindeer...

Marcello Santos speaking.

CUT TO:

MR. REINDEER

(laughing)

Mr. Marcello Santos...  Hey there...

That was great shit you sent in last

month...

CUT TO:

SANTOS

I gotta problem...  In fact, I gotta

coupla problems...

CUT TO:

MR. REINDEER

(laughs again)

Gotta coupla problems, huh?...  For

each problem drop a silver dollar

through my mail slot...  With all

particulars...  Well work out

il conto later...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LULA

(sing-song spells)

M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i...  You can almost

hear that jazz blowin up from the

big N.O.

SAILOR

Lula...  I learned somethin interestin

today on a science show I heard on the

radio...  How leeches is comin back

into style.

LULA

Say what?  Honestly, sugar, you can

talk more shit sometimes?

SAILOR

Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?

LULA

Yeah, its a real problem for me,

Sailor, you know?  When I went in

that drugstore by the restaurant in

Biloxi?  I saw em by the register

and the girl throw em in.  Im

not big on resistin.  So what about

a leech?

SAILOR

Heard on the radio how doctors is

usin leeches again, just in old

times.  You know, when even barbers

used em?

LULA

(shuddering)

I got one on me at Lake Lanier.

Lifeguard poured salt on it and it

dropped off.  Felt awful.  He was a

cute boy, though, so it was almost

worth it.

SAILOR

Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio

said back in the 1920s a I-talian

doctor figured out that if, say, a

fella got his nose cut off or bit

off in, say, a barfight or somethin,

theyd sew one of his forearms to his

nose for a few weeks...  Then put

leeches on it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LULA

Sailor?  You expect me to believe

a mand be goin around with a

arm sewed to his nose?

SAILOR

(nodding)

How they used to do it.  Course they

got more sophisticated ways now.

Radio said the Chinese, I think it

is, figured a better idea is by

insertin a balloon in the forehead

and lettin it hand down on the nose.

LULA

Sailor Ripley!  You stop!  Youre

makin this shit up and I aint

gonna sit for it!

SAILOR

Honest, Lula.  I probly aint

precisely got all the facts straight,

but its about what they said.

LULA

Honey, were goin to bed now and

its time to change the subject.

SAILOR

Were about dry bones, sweetheart.

We dont wanna have to push this

bird into New Orleans.

LULA

We sure dont, honey...

(shouting to Sailor as

he goes into the store)

Get me a Mounds?

BLACK MAN

(to Sailor and another guy

also waiting to pay for gas)

Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished

on my shoppin here.

ERV

This be it?

BLACK MAN

Yall take American Express?

ERV

Yessir.

BLACK MAN

Then lemme throw in a couple more

things.

BLACK MAN

(to Sailor, smiling - showing

no visible upper teeth)

Pussycats gotta eat, too.

BLACK MAN

(to Erv)

Id just soon have a paper bag

rather than a plastic one, if its

same to you.

ERV

(shoving the plastic bag he

filled towards the black man)

We dont have no paper bags.

BLACK MAN

(into phone)

Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my

way...

(to Sailor and other guy

as he picks up his bag

and heads out)

Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

SAILOR

(to Erv)

All I wants ten bucks regular.

Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

SAILOR

I aint got my American Express card

with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope

thats okay.

LULA

That took long enough.  You forget

my Mounds?

SAILOR

I really do think the country done

changed just a little while I was

away, peanut.

LULA

(as she chews)

You got to keep an eye on it.  Thats

sure.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MR. REINDEER

A coupla silver dollars came my way

today...  Im sending one of them

to you with a paper on the beneficiary

...  As usual, you are completely

free to fulfill the obligation in any

manner you so desire.

REGGIE

Do you mind if we share this table?

...  The others, they are occupied.

JOHNNIE

(cautiously)

Alright...  By all means.  Make

yourselves at home.

DROP SHADOW

(as he sits down)

Muchas gracias.

REGGIE

My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.

But please do call me Reggie.  This

is my friend, who we call Drop

Shadow.  He is always with me.

JOHNNIE

Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

REGGIE

You are from New Orleans, Senor

Farragut?

JOHNNIE

Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,

North Carolina.  Here on business.

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

REGGIE

Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

JOHNNIE

Only that its supposed to be a

pretty poor sight since the hurricane

came through last year.

REGGIE

Yes, thats so.  But there is not

much to destroy.

DROP SHADOW

No big buildings like in New Orleans.

JOHNNIE

Whattaya do there?

REGGIE

(laughs)

Oh, many things...

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance

shop.

REGGIE

But I am also with the government.

JOHNNIE

In what capacity?

REGGIE

In many capacities.

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the

Secret Service.

JOHNNIE

(reading aloud)

General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.

Telefono 666.

REGGIE

He is my sponsor.  The General is

the head of the secret police of

Honduras.

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his

operatives.

REGGIE

That is my permiso.

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

REGGIE

Only if necessary, of course, and

only in my own country.

(laughs)

JOHNNIE

Of course.

DROP SHADOW

Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to

carry a .45.

REGGIE

United States Marine issue, before

they made the unfortunate switch to

the less dependable nine millimeters.

I have it here, in my briefcase.

JOHNNIE

Why are you in New Orleans?  If you

dont mind my askin.

REGGIE

Certainly not.  We are here only

briefly, in fact, until this evening,

when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit

a friend of mine who is an agent for

the CIA.

DROP SHADOW

He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula

and me bass fishing.

REGGIE

We are in the same businesses and

also we are fishermen.

JOHNNIE

(extending his hand)

Its been a real pleasure.  I wish

you both buena suerte wherever you go.

REGGIE

The same to you.  If you are in

Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and

visit us.  The Hondurans are great

friends of the American people.  But

I have a joke for you before I go.

If a liberal, a socialist, and a

communist all jumped off the roof of

the Empire State Building at the

same time, which one of them would

hit the ground first?

JOHNNIE

I couldnt say, which one?

DROP SHADOW

(grinning)

Who cares?

CUT TO:

LULA

I love it when your eyes get wild,

honey.  They light up all blue almost

and little white parachutes pop out

of em.  Oh, Sailor youre so aware

of what goes on with me?  I mean, you

pay attention.  And I swear, you got

the sweetest cock.  Sometimes its

like its talkin to me when youre

inside?  Like its got a voice all

its own.  You get right on me.

SAILOR

You really are dangerously cute,

honey.  I gotta admit it.

SAILOR

Lets head out into the crazy world

of New Orleans...  I gotta get

somethin to eat.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

My names George Kovich.  Bet youve

heard of me.

SAILOR

Dont know that I have...  Should I

know about you for anythin in

particular?

GEORGE

Was in all the papers three years ago.

Im seventy-six, was only seventy-

three then.  Had a business in

Buffalo, New York, called Rats With

Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone

who wanted em killed.

LULA

Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.

Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

business?

GEORGE

No, maam.  I was a housepainter,

in the union forty-one years.  Im

retired now, livin with my sister,

Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five

years ago, married an oil man named

Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now,

so its just me and Ida.  I sold my

house and moved down after the city

of Buffalo put me out of business.

Hell, RWW was doin them a service,

and they charged me with endangerin

the public.

LULA

Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?

GEORGE

Theyre useless pests.  Ive shot

hundreds of em...

CUT TO:

GEORGE

(voice-over)

...My neighbors hired me to get rid

of the pigeons that gathered on

their roofs and porches...

CUT TO:

GEORGE

...Neighbors asked me how come the

spotted bastards didnt light on my

house or my brother Earls anymore,

and I told em the truth.  I shot

em...  Earls gone now...

CUT TO:

GEORGE

(voice-over)

...Heart attack six months ago -

had that cholesterol thick as shit...

His widow, Mildred, she still lives

in the house next to mine.

CUT TO:

GEORGE

Shes stone deaf but the racket the

pigeons made drove Earl crazy.  He

could hear em even with the TV on.

He owned a bar thirty years, The

Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street.

Earls roof was a favorite spot for

pigeons.  They lit there day and night.

I wanted to toss a grenade up there.

SAILOR

If your neighbors didnt mind,

howd you get put out of business?

GEORGE

Woman drivin down the street spotted

me with on a roof with my rifle.  She

called the police and they came over

and arrested me.  Thought I was a

sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that

one.  Cops didnt understand about

the pigeons, the damage they do to

personal property.  I used to complain

to the city but they never lifted

a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,

but I was afraid somebodys cat

would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats

myself.  So I used the .22 because

it didnt make much noise and the

ammo was cheap.

SAILOR

What happened on the charges?

GEORGE

Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred

dollar fine and ordered to desist.

Pigeons carry diseases and muss up

the place.  You seen it.  Plain filth.

GEORGE

Its a serious situation.  Not like

the Turks and the Armenians, maybe,

or the Arabs and the Jews, but I

want people to remember me and what

Ive done and pick up where I left

off.  Somebody had to make a move.

It was nice meetin you folks.

SAILOR

What lesson do get outta that story,

Lula?

LULA

Its just another case, Sailor.

SAILOR

Whats that, peanut?

LULA

One person thinks hes doin somethin

good and everbody else gets upset

about it.

SAILOR

Aint it the way...

CUT TO:

LULA

Sailor?...  Sailor, honey?

SAILOR

Huh?

LULA

Ever imagine what itd be like to

get eaten alive by a wild beast?...

Sometimes I think it would be the

biggest thrill?

SAILOR

My God,

(looks around)

it better be, darlin, cause itd be

the last...  What time is it?

LULA

Shhhhh...  Its four oclock...

That womans laugh the other day had

somethin to do with this feelin?

...  Like bein ripped apart by a

gorilla, maybe...  Grabbed sudden

and pulled apart real quick by a

real powerful one.

SAILOR

Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you

come up with some weird thoughts...

LULA

Anythin interestin in the world

come out of somebodys weird thoughts,

Sailor.  You tell me Sailor, who

could come up with shit like were

seein these days?

SAILOR

You got me, peanut.

LULA

(smiles - turns to him)

You certain?

SAILOR

I aint never met anyone come close

to you, sugar.

LULA

Recall the time we was sittin one

night behind the Confederate soldier?

Leanin against it.  And you took

your hand and put it on your heart

and you said, You feel it beatin

in there, Lula?...  Get used to it,

cause it belongs to you now.  Dyou

recall that?

SAILOR

I do.

LULA

I was hopin you would.  I know that

night by heart.  Sometimes, honey?

I think its the best night of

my life.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LULA

(lost in the memory)

I really do think its the best

night of my life.

SAILOR

We didnt do nothin special I can

remember.  Just talked, is all.

LULA

Talkins good.  Long as you got the

other?  Im a big believer in talkin,

case you aint noticed.

SAILOR

Too bad they dont give an award for

talkin...  Youd win first prize.

Especially with those tits.

LULA

You think so, baby?  Does my talkin

bother you, honey?

SAILOR

No, I like gettin up around four

a.m. and talkin bout wild animals

...  Though you woke me up this time

in the middle of a dream.  I kinda

wish I didnt remember it.  Up at

Pee Dee, I couldnt remember any of

my dreams.

LULA

What was this one?

SAILOR

It wasnt no fun, Lula.  The wind

was blowin super-hard and I wasnt

dressed warm.  Only instead of

freezin, I was sweatin strong.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(voice-over)

The water was rollin off me.  And I

was dirty, too, like I hadnt had no

bath in a long time, so the sweat

was black almost.

CUT TO:

LULA

Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.

SAILOR

I know.  I kept walkin, I headed for

your house, only it wasnt your

house, really.  You let me in only

you werent real pleased to see me.

You kept askin, Whyd you come to

see me now?  Why now?  Like itd been

a long time since wed seen each ohter.

LULA

Oh, baby, what an idea.  Id always

be happy to see you, no matter what.

SAILOR

I know, peanut.  But it wasnt all

like you were so unhappy I was there,

just you were upset.  My bein there

was upsettin to you.  You had some

kids there, little kids, and I guess

youd got married and your husband

was comin home any minute.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

(voice-over)

I tell you, Lula.  I was shakin wet.

All this black sweat was pourin

off me, and I knew I was scarin you,

so I took off.

CUT TO:

LULA

Sometimes dreams just dont mean

nothin...  Stuff comes into your

mind and you dont have no control

over, you know?  Anyways, dreams

aint no odder than real life.

Sometimes not by half.

SAILOR

Well, I aint upset about it, darlin.

Just give me an odd feelin there a

minute, is all.

LULA

Take a bite of Lula.

CUT TO:

CHET

Hey!!!...  Johnnie Farragut.  How

are you, my man.

JOHNNIE

Real good, Chet...  Its been awhile.

CHET

Everythins relative.  Wheres that

Marietta Pace Fortune?  You two

didnt split up, I hope.

JOHNNIE

No...  Shes fine.  Back home.

CHET

Whatll it be?  The regular?  Black

Label?

JOHNNIE

Set one up.

CHET

So who you out sleuthin for now?...

Can I help ya?

JOHNNIE

Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas

daughter, Lula.  Her and er beau

took off the other day.  Mariettas

real upset about it.

CHET

Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone

told me somebody lookin like her

was at the Nothin Fancy yesterday.

JOHNNIE

Sounds right...  Ill check it out.

CHET

(checking for a gold ring

on Johnnies hand)

You hitched yet?

JOHNNIE

No sir...

CHET

Its none of my business, but when

are you and Marietta gonna tie the

knot?  I always wondered why you

never did.

JOHNNIE

Not for lack of love, I can tell

ya that.

CHET

Thats what I mean...  Always looked

like you was just knocked out in

love...  Was real nice to see.

JOHNNIE

Ill tell ya though, its comin up

to the time when Marietta and me

might just set up house together and

settle down...  I think that times

comin up right soon.  But like you

said, everythins realtive.

CUT TO:

LULA

Lets get outta here...  I suddenly

got a funny feelin about this

place.  Feelin all that voodoo...

SAILOR

(winks at her)

Gotta hex from a voodoo?

LULA

(smiles)

Who do?

SAILOR

You do.

LULA

Oh my God...  Its Johnnie...  Duck

down!...  Get goin!

SAILOR

(looking around frantically)

Where?

LULA

Never mind where...  Get outta here...

I mean it, Sailor.

SAILOR

Im goin.

CUT TO:

JOHNNIE

(to himself)

Aint love wonderful?...

WAITRESS

Whats that?

JOHNNIE

I said, aint love wonderful?

JOHNNIE

Good luck to you kids.

CUT TO:

LULA

You think he saw us?

SAILOR

Who knows, baby?

LULA

He was sittin there havin a beignet

at the Cafe Du Monde.  Do you think

he saw us?

SAILOR

Lula, darlin...  Makes no difference

anyway...  Were outta here.

CUT TO:

SAILOR

Sweetheart, keep your panties up.

Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.

LULA

Sure you wanna do this?  Might be

a way they could track us.

SAILOR

Hes just a regular guyt needs help,

honey.  Look at him.

ROACH

Thanks a lot.  I been standin out

there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!

Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch

ya hitchin on a Interstate around here

they throw ya on a county road crew

for a week, less you can pay the

ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

SAILOR

My names Sailor, and this heres

Lula.  Whats yours?

ROACH

Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls

me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

LULA

You always make that strange little

funny laugh when you talk?

ROACH

Aint laughin, ha-ha!

SAILOR

What you got in the box?

ROACH

My dogs, ha-ha!

ROACH

Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These

dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

LULA

(to Sailor)

This guys crazy.

SAILOR

Where you from, Roach?

ROACH

If you mean where I was born, it was

Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I

been brought up in Baton Rouge.

LULA

Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered

you get them puppies?  They look sick.

ROACH

I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The

Call of the Wild.  I aint never

seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs

at the pound.  Nobody wanted em,

ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself

pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im

gonna feed these boys good so theyll

be big and powerful and they can pull

me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

LULA

(screeches as she sees this)

Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

LULA

Im sorry, but I cant take this.

Roach, or whatever your name is, you

come out of there with them dogs

this instant!

LULA

Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry,

Roach.  But aint gonna make it to

Alaska?  Least not any part of the

way with us.  Youd best find a

party to take care of those dogs

proper, before they all die?  And,

if you dont mind my sayin so?  You

could most certainly use some serious

lookin after yourself, startin with

a bath!

LULA

Drive.

SAILOR

You dont feel you was a little hard

on the guy, honey?

LULA

I know youre thinkin that I got

moren some of my mama in me?  Well,

I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really

couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,

but when he pulled that drippin hunk

of awful-smellin meat out of his

pocket?  I near barfed.  And them

poor diseased puppies!

SAILOR

(laughs)

Just part of life on the road, peanut.

LULA

Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up

no more hitchers, okay?

CUT TO:

JOHNNIE

No, Marietta, I havent found em.

MARIETTA

This is the kinda mistake can take

a Hindus lifetime to unfix...

You better get a move on, Johnnie,

before that boy got her holdin down

a Memphis streetcorner and shootin

dope up her arms.

JOHNNIE

Really, Marietta, you got more

scenarios swimmin around in your

brain than Carter got pills.  Try

to take it easy.  Go over to Myrtle

Beach for a few days.

MARIETTA

Im stayin right here by the phone

until you find Lula, then Im comin

to get her.  You call soons you got

somethin, even if its three in the

a.m.

JOHNNIE

I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

REGGIE

(shouting)

Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.

JOHNNIE

I thought you two were in Austin,

Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in

these parts.

DROP SHADOW

We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and

I are on our way back to Utila, in

the morning.

REGGIE

Would you like to enjoy a martini

with us?

JOHNNIE

Why not?  How was the fishin?

REGGIE

I think they are too serious, these

American fishermen.  In Honduras, we

are not so concerned with the method.

JOHNNIE

So, its back to the islands.

DROP SHADOW

Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke

yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach

San Pedro Sula, who is named after

Cary Grant, and he told them there

was a shooting.

REGGIE

Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local

shrimp boat captains is in jail now.

These people are friends of mine, so

I must return and find out what

happened.

JOHNNIE

This island of yours sounds like a

kind of unpredictable place.

REGGIE

(laughs)

It has its moments of uncertainty.

DROP SHADOW

But how are you finding New Orleans,

Senor Farragut?

JOHNNIE

Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always

been a good town to sit around in.

REGGIE

I can tell you are an intelligent

man, Johnnie.  One difference between

your country and mine is that in the

islands, it does not pay to reveal

ones intelligence...  Others may use

what they perceive against us...

REGGIE

Hasta siempre.

JOHNNIE

Hasta siempre.

REGGIE

Do you know how it came about that

copper wire was invented in Scotland?

JOHNNIE

Hows that?

DROP SHADOW

Two Scotsmen were fighting over a

penny.

JOHNNIE

I gotta admit, you guys are

(sliding off the stool)

two in four dozen.

REGGIE

The real joke is we never went fishing,

but were still fishing.

CUT TO:

LULA

I wouldnt mind a little night life.

How about you?

SAILOR

Hard to tell whats shakin in a

place like this, honey.  You dont

want to be walkin in the wrong door.

LULA

Maybe theres a place we could hear

some music.  I feel like dancin.

We could ask someone.

SAILOR

Someone up here might know somethin.

BUCK

Gas?

SAILOR

Got enough, thanks.  Were lookin

for a place has some music, where we

can maybe do some dancin - get

somethin to eat, too.  Anything like

that around here?

BILLY

JOHNNIE

Did she tell you where she was

callin from?

MARIETTA

No, but my guess is theyre headed

west, so probly Texas.  Their money

must be runnin low.  I dont think

Sailor had much to begin with, if

any, and Lula took the six hundred

she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.

JOHNNIE

Howd she sound?  Was she doin okay?

MARIETTA

Could she be doin okay, Johnnie?

little girl up good.

SAILOR

Yeah ... yeah...  I guess so...

SAILOR

LULA

SAILOR

That was in Vietnam.

LULA

Hes the kind liked it.

SAILOR

Lula, I got to get some sleep.

LULA

Buddy told me about that thing at

Cao Ben?

SAILOR

What?

LULA

Was a massacre.  Soldiers there

murdered old folks, women and babies,

and dumped em in a trench.  Bobby

Peru probly killed the most.

SAILOR

Lula, he mighta did, I dont know.

But it dont matter now.  Lotta guys

go outta control in a war and it

aint their fault.

LULA

I sure enjoy smokin, Sailor.  I

hate that its bad for you.

LULA

That mans a black angel, Sailor.

You hook up with him, youll regret

it.  If you live to.

Thanks, darlin, I know you got my

best interest in mind, and I

(hands him the .32)

Remember, soon as we get inside, you

PERDITA

MARIETTA

Well, you be careful with that boy,

LULA

Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

MARIETTA

Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

LULA

Really, mama, I gotta go.

MARIETTA

LULA

PACE

LULA

PACE

My daddy aint never killed nobody,

LULA

Course he aint never killed nobody.

Whyd you say that, Pace?

PACE

LULA

And?

PACE

Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

LULA

SAILOR

LULA

Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

SAILOR

Ill walk back to the depot.

LULA

Whatre you talkin about?  Thats

your son in there.

SAILOR

He aint never known me, Lula, so

there aint much for him to forget.

Not seein each other for six years

makes it next best to simple for us, too.

LULA

How can you say that, Sailor?

SAILOR

What makes sense, is all.

LULA

Dont do this, Sailor, please.

SAILOR

(to Pace)

Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin
