YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)

You wanna be Kareem?

QUINCY (CONT'D)

All his big butt do is stand by the

basket.

JAMAL

Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

KELVIN

I'm gonna be like Dr. J.

QUINCY

I'ma be like my Dad.

JAMAL

He ain't a star or nothing.

QUINCY

I don't see none of your sorry daddies in

the NBA.

KELVIN

Hey, look, Q.

KELVIN (cont'd)

Thought only girls were moving in.

QUINCY

That's what my Moms said.

KELVIN

I hope he can ball.

JAMAL

Bet he's a scrub.

KID

Hey.

QUINCY

Hey.

KID

Can I play?

QUINCY

You nice?

KID

Yeah, I'm nice.

QUINCY

You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

JAMAL

Ah man, he is a girl.

QUINCY

Girls can't play no ball.

MONICA

Ball better than you.

QUINCY

(whispering)

What a dog.

JAMAL

She heard you.

QUINCY

Nuh uh, they could only hear dog

whistles.

QUINCY (cont'd)

One, zip.

MONICA

One, up.

QUINCY

Lucky.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Two, one.

MONICA

Two, up.

KELVIN

Aaah, she dogged you.

JAMAL

Shut up.

QUINCY

Point.

QUINCY (cont'd)

I got her.

MONICA

Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be

the first girl in the NBA.

QUINCY

I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my

cheerleader.

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Eeew.

NATHAN

How are you feeling, munchkin?

NATHAN (cont'd)

Yeah, you're through.

CAMILLE

She needs to stop running around like a

little boy.

NATHAN

She's alright.

CAMILLE

How is she alright looking the way she

does?

NATHAN

Camille, she'll be fine.

CAMILLE

I'll get some ice.

ZEKE

Girl, who you trying to fool?

QUINCY

Alley-oop, Dad.

NONA

Boy...

NONA (cont'd)

New neighbors.

ZEKE

See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught

me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me

thinking I was getting a sister who could

burn.

QUINCY

I can't do this shit.

ZEKE

Boy, what'd I tell you about using that

word?

QUINCY

(sighs, then)

"Can't" should never be in a man's

vocabulary.

ZEKE

Why not?

QUINCY

Cause when you say can't, you ain't a

man.

ZEKE

That's right.

NONA

Zeke.

ZEKE

What?

(then)

Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

NONA

We should head over.

ZEKE

Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a

meeting.

NONA

With who?

ZEKE

Business folks.

NONA

You just got back from a four game road

trip.

ZEKE

Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe

two years left to play.  I'm just trying

to put some things together for us.

ZEKE (cont'd)

Later, Quincy.

QUINCY

Later, Dad.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Mom?

NONA

What?

QUINCY

We still have to go?

NONA

(beat)

Yeah.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

NONA

...we moved back here when Quincy was

about five, after Zeke was traded.

Neighborhood was a little more mixed

back then...

CAMILLE

Until the Black family down the street

became the Black family next door.

NONA

(nods)

Okay?

CAMILLE

Well, thanks again.  This was really nice

of you.

NONA

It was the least we could do.  And I love

to cook.

CAMILLE

Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my

friends' parties and things back in

Atlanta.

NONA

You're a caterer?

CAMILLE

Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled

and the girls get a little older, it's

definitely something I want to do.

(then)

Since you love to cook, maybe it's

something we can talk about.

NONA

You know, girl, long as I've lived next

door, I've never seen the inside of this

house.

CAMILLE

Really?  Well, come on, then.

CAMILLE (cont'd)

Honey, put this in the kitchen.

NONA

Help her, Quincy.

QUINCY

So...does it hurt?

MONICA

It's this big hole.  You could almost see

bone.

QUINCY

For real?

MONICA

Uh huh.

QUINCY

So how come you could play basketball?

MONICA

I just can.

QUINCY

I never knew a girl that could play.

MONICA

My Mom says she doesn't know where I come

from 'cause I act different.

QUINCY

Your Dad play?

MONICA

He works at a bank.

QUINCY

My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says

I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma

play for them, too.  Same number and

everything.

MONICA

I'm going to be number thirty-two, like

Magic.

QUINCY

He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

MONICA

What was the most points your Daddy ever

got in Junior High?

QUINCY

I don't know.  A lot.

MONICA

One time Magic scored forty-eight points,

and they only had six minute quarters and

he sat out the whole fourth.

QUINCY

You do act different.

MONICA

I don't care.

QUINCY

Well, if anybody bothers you, you could

just tell me cause I run this street.

MONICA

I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

QUINCY

She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad

showed me how to fight like Ali.

MONICA

So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

QUINCY

Bet you can't do this though.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Okay, how bout this?

CAMILLE

Monica, what did you do?

MONICA

Nothing.

CAMILLE

(to Nona)

Oh, all that work.

NONA

It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

QUINCY

Sorry.

NONA

No.  Good boy.

MONICA

Ow!

MONICA (cont'd)

Ow, Lena!!!

LENA

Ow!

MONICA

Ah, Mom.

CAMILLE

I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your

box of dresses under a pile of rags in

the garbage.

CAMILLE (cont'd)

Child, pick up your lip.

MONICA

I hate it.

CAMILLE

Fine, you don't like this one, which one

would you rather wear?

MONICA

Pants.

CAMILLE

(to Lena)

When you're done can you make sure she

brushes her teeth?

LENA

Are you okay?

CAMILLE

I just need to lay down.  I've been

running around all day.

NATHAN

Which one for tomorrow?

CAMILLE

The blue.

NATHAN

You sure?

NATHAN (cont'd)

Can you iron both tonight just in case?

CAMILLE

(beat)

Okay.

NATHAN

Thanks, sweetheart.

CAMILLE

The boy next door is riding with you to

school so you'll know somebody your first

day.

(to Lena)

Hurry so she can go to sleep.

MONICA

Make it look nice, kay.

EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING

QUINCY

You wanna be my girl?

MONICA

What do I have to do?

QUINCY

I guess, you know, we play ball and we

ride to school together.  And if you get

mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

MONICA

I don't like flowers.

QUINCY

Oh.

MONICA

How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever

buy them.

QUINCY

Kay.

MONICA

Okay.

QUINCY

I think we gotta kiss now.

MONICA

For how long?

QUINCY

Five seconds.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Ready?

QUINCY (cont'd)

Wait.  Cause you're my girl now you

gotta ride my bike.

MONICA

I want to ride my own bike.

QUINCY

My Dad always drives my Mom.

MONICA

So?

QUINCY

(impatient)

So that means I have to ride with you.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Come on.

MONICA

I don't have to do what you say.

QUINCY

Man, forget you then, stupid.

MONICA

You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for

the worst team in the NBA.

QUINCY

What?

MONICA

(laughs)

Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

QUINCY

Shut up!

QUINCY (cont'd)

I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly

dog!

MONICA

I don't want to be your girlfriend, big

head!

FADE TO:

REFEREE

No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty-

two.

MONICA

MONICA (cont'd)

She was still moving!

COACH HISERMAN

Monica!  Let it go!

REFEREE

Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.

MONICA

For what?

REFEREE

Taunting.

MONICA

Taunting?!

COACH HISERMAN

Sub!

MONICA

Man, you suck!

COACH HISERMAN

Sit down and shut up.

DISSOLVE TO:

CAMILLE

...and if you want a thicker base, you

can cut in a potato or just use a little

flour.

LENA

But you use potato?

MONICA

Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

NATHAN

And what am I supposed to say to the man?

MONICA

The coach from Tennessee was there and he

has me riding the bench.

NATHAN

You lost your head.

MONICA

I was just showing emotion.

CAMILLE

So that means it's alright for you to act

like that?

LENA

(to Monica)

What'd you do?

MONICA

(dismissive)

nothing.

CAMILLE

I don't know why I keep hoping you'll

grow out of this tomboy thing.

MONICA

I won't.  I'm a lesbian.

CAMILLE

That's not funny

MONICA

Well, that's what you think, isn't it?

Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an

apron...

CAMILLE

Watch your mouth.

NATHAN

Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's

time to start thinking about other things

besides basketball.

MONICA

(taken aback)

What?

NATHAN

You only have one game left and you

haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I

wanted it as bad as you did, but we have

to face reality.

MONICA

The coach from USC is going to be at the

championship.

NATHAN

I know.  But chances are...

MONICA

Chances are there's still a chance.

CAMILLE

If you'd just listen for once, you'd

realize you have a lot more going for

yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty

if you put a comb to your head.  I mean,

why walk around with your hair looking

like "whodunit"...?

QUINCY

Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.

QUINCY (cont'd)

And my mom's about to be home.

FELICIA

So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?

QUINCY

Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you

up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.

FELICIA

(kissing him again)

That's a lot of beating.

INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

SHAWNEE

Hey, girl.

MONICA

Hey.

SHAWNEE

Your hair looks so cute like that.

SHAWNEE (cont'd)

So...you know who Q's asking to the

Spring Dance?

MONICA

No.

SHAWNEE

C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's

been creeping?

MONICA

There's so many I just can't keep track.

SHAWNEE

Well, can you give him this for me?

MONICA

Give it yourself.

SHAWNEE

I don't wanna look fast.

(drops it in Monica's lap)

Thanks, girl.

SHAWNEE (cont'd)

Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want

to lick the sweat off it.

MATCH CUT TO:

JIM

Quincy, word has it you might make the

jump the NBA.

ZEKE

Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's

college bound with or without basketball.

JIM

You could make a career by telling me

where.

ZEKE

Gotta wait til the press conference.

JIM

But you'd love for him to play at USC,

like you did.

ZEKE

I'd love for him to get a good education.

(then)

That's it.

ZEKE (cont'd)

We should have another talk with Coach

Carril at Princeton.

QUINCY

Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is

going all the way.

ZEKE

I don't care about the team.  I care

about the school.

QUINCY

Didn't we already have this conversation?

ZEKE

You played good.  I was proud of you.

QUINCY

Yeah?

(then)

So you up for a game later?

ZEKE

I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

QUINCY

You don't wanna hurt your back.

ZEKE

(smiles)

Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.

Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

QUINCY

You work too hard, Pop.

ZEKE

Let's hope I can say the same about you

one day.

MONICA

Hey, Mr. M.

ZEKE

Hey, Miss Baller.

MONICA

Way to hoop.

QUINCY

I know this.  What do you want?

MONICA

A ride home.

QUINCY

Your legs don't look broke.

MONICA

Look, big head, I'll be at your car.

QUINCY

Guess "please" would be a stretch.

MONICA

(dryly)

Please.

INT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT

QUINCY

What's that?

MONICA

Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give

to you.

QUINCY

(thinks)

Big-ass titties?

QUINCY (cont'd)

Give it here.

MONICA

"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've

been wanting to get with you.  Let me

take you to the Spring Dance and I

promise I'll leave you satisfied."

MONICA (cont'd)

What a ho.

QUINCY

Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she

wants to get with me.

MONICA

She's a ho cause she's sending her

coochie through the mail.

QUINCY

And?

MONICA

And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a

nice guy and I wanna get to know you

better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

QUINCY

So she's honest.

MONICA

Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I

guess you'll stick your dick in anything.

QUINCY

Didn't know you cared so much.

MONICA

I don't.

QUINCY

So who you going to the dance with,

Spalding?

MONICA

Who's Spalding?

MONICA (cont'd)

Fuck you, Quincy.

QUINCY

See, that's why you ain't getting

recruited.

MONICA

Who said I'm not getting recruited?

QUINCY

Your hot-ass temper.

MONICA

I'm not the one who put this scar here.

QUINCY

God, here we go.

MONICA

When we were eleven years old cause he

was about to lose.

QUINCY

That's it, give it your best shot.

MONICA

Would you watch the damn road?

QUINCY

I mean it, give it your best shot, cause

I'm tired of you holding that over my

head.

MONICA

I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

QUINCY

I'm warning you.  You don't stall that

bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.

MONICA

Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk

smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But

because I'm a female, I get told to calm

down and act like a "lady".  I'm a

ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.

QUINCY

With a jacked-up attitude.

MONICA

Didn't know you cared so much.

QUINCY

I don't.

MONICA

Good.

INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - SHORT TIME LATER

QUINCY

What's up, Moms.

NONA

What is this?

QUINCY

Uh, your earring?

NONA

I look like some hoochie to you?  I

found it on your floor.

QUINCY

What are you doing in my room?

NONA

Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass

girls.

QUINCY

We were just studying.

NONA

I'm not playing with you, these girls are

looking to get you caught.  They see you,

they see dollar signs.

QUINCY

Okay.

NONA

You hearing me?

QUINCY

I've been hearing you.

NONA

How was your game?

QUINCY

Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and

still undefeated.

NONA

Still the man.

QUINCY

Yup.

NONA

Where's your dad?

QUINCY

Said he'd be home later.

NONA

Later when?

QUINCY

I don't know, he had a meeting or

something.

ZEKE

I had some players to see and hands to

shake.

NONA

At one in the morning?

ZEKE

I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a

clock just so my wife doesn't get an

attitude.

NONA

I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about

to come second to this bullshit scouting

job.

NONA (cont'd)

I didn't mean it like that.

ZEKE

Yeah.

NONA

I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found

time for your family.

You should see the tramps coming after

Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...

ZEKE

I have.

NONA

You said you'd think about going back to

get your degree.

ZEKE

No, you said I should get my degree.  I

like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's

gonna lead to a spot in the front office.

Til then, don't worry, there's just

enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci

and gold.

NONA

Fine, then how many nights home is that?

ZEKE

Keep your voice down.

NONA

How about now?  I got a week yet?

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - LATE DAY

LENA

That too tight?

MONICA

No.

LENA

Mom's going to hate it.

MONICA

Always on my ass, anyway.

LENA

Like you don't give her a hard time.

MONICA

Just cause I don't kiss her booty like

you...

MONICA (cont'd)

Ow!!!

LENA

You need to.  She's alone in this house

all day, taking care of Dad and your

ungrateful behind.

MONICA

No one's forcing her.

LENA

Just try and chill a little bit, alright.

MONICA

Ow!!!  Okay!

LENA

So what's going on with the Spring Dance?

You have a date yet?

MONICA

(sarcastically)

Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

LENA

I found you someone.

MONICA

Found?  I'm not some charity case.

LENA

I know...

MONICA

Mom tell you to do this?

LENA

No.

MONICA

Damn, Lena...

(then)

Who is he?

LENA

This brother from my college.

MONICA

He's in college?

LENA

And he's fine, girl.

MONICA

How'd you get him to say yes?

LENA

I told him you looked like me.

MONICA

Oh, great.

LENA

You do.

MONICA

Yeah, right.

LENA

If you were tore up I would not be

claiming you.  Trust.

LENA (cont'd)

We'll do something cute with your hair,

get you a dress, get you some heels...

MONICA

I don't know how to walk in heels.

LENA

Hey.  You just worry about playing your

behind off for that recruiter tonight.

Let me worry about your date.

MONICA

You ever been in love?

LENA

Too many times.

MONICA

They ever love you back?

LENA

Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATE DAY

CAMILLE

Monica, please.

MONICA

Sorry.

(then)

I'm leaving.

CAMILLE

Taste this.

MONICA

I can't eat before a game.

CAMILLE

Child, take a bite.

CAMILLE (cont'd)

I found some apricot chutney and mixed it

with the yams.

MONICA

You really should be a caterer or

something like you used to say.

CAMILLE

Sure.  In between all the other things I

have to do.

MONICA

What?

CAMILLE

Nothing.  So good luck.

COACH HISERMAN

I don't have to tell you girls how big

this game is.  We worked too damn hard

all season to leave without this

championship.  So let's play smart...

(looks at Monica)

...let's play in control, and let's kick

some butt.  Cougars on three.

Once...two...three.

MONICA

You really think I look beautiful?

JASON

Can I take your coat?

MONICA

You're cold?

JASON

No, I mean I can check it for you.

MONICA

(embarrassed)

Oh, sorry.

JASON

Your sister wasn't lying.

QUINCY

Oh...shit.

SHAWNEE

Q, I like this song...

QUINCY

See you made it.

MONICA

Yeah.

QUINCY

You don't look half-bad.

MONICA

You either.

JASON

What's up, Black.  I'm Jason.

QUINCY

Q.

SHAWNEE

Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made

dresses.

MONICA

Guess we'll see you later.

JASON

So, you like school?

JASON (cont'd)

Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't

remember sisters being as fine as you,

though.

JASON (cont'd)

So what do you like studying?

MONICA

Gym.

JASON

I'm an English major.  You like English?

MONICA

Sort of.

JASON

Careful.

MONICA

Huh?

JASON

That was two words.

JASON (cont'd)

Girl, how come you're so stressed?

MONICA

Sorry.

JASON

I mean, I'm having a good time with

you...

JASON (cont'd)

So tell me what I have to do to make you

have a good time with me.

MONICA

My mouth is kinda dry.

JASON

Then I'll get you some punch.

JASON (cont'd)

Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a

glass slipper behind.

JASON (cont'd)

There we go.

QUINCY

Hey.

MONICA

Hey.

QUINCY

You having fun?

MONICA

Yeah.

QUINCY

Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.

(beat)

So who is this clown?

MONICA

He ain't Spalding.

QUINCY

Guess not.

MONICA

So you took Shawnee, huh?

QUINCY

(embarrassed)

You know, it was late and she asked...

JASON

You want to dance?

MONICA

Sure.

QUINCY

C'mon.

MONICA

(rattling)

Freshman year, my free throw percentage

was fifty-one percent, cause I was

shooting it like a jump shot.

MONICA (cont'd)

Um...but then sophomore year I was

shooting seventy-five percent from the

line.

MONICA (cont'd)

...uh, by keeping my feet set and really

following through.

JASON

That was nice.

MONICA

Uh-huh.

JASON

Your sister told me hands off, but I

can't help myself...

Wait...

Shh.  It's okay.

DISSOLVE TO:

E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT

MONICA

Psst.

MONICA

Early night for you, isn't it?

QUINCY

I was about to ask you the same thing,

going out with a college boy and all.

QUINCY (cont'd)

So where'd you go after?

MONICA

(beat)

Mulholland Drive.

QUINCY

Figures.

MONICA

So what dead-end street did you and

Shawnee hit?

QUINCY

None of your business.

MONICA

Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left

you satisfied.

QUINCY

That what you think?

QUINCY (cont'd)

Little after you left, I told Shawnee it

was time to go and I drove her ass

straight home.  And after she told me I

was the dumbest brother in the world, I

took off.

MONICA

Why?

QUINCY

Cause I don't just stick my dick in

anything.

MONICA

I was sitting in Jason's ride with him

kissing on me and feeling on me and it

was really bugging me cause I couldn't

remember how many offensive boards I had

in the championship.  And then I guess

she got tired of me sort of accidentally

kneeing him in the balls.

QUINCY

Four.

MONICA

What?

QUINCY

You had four offensive rebounds.

MONICA

Hold up for a second.

QUINCY

When'd you get this?

MONICA

It was on my bed when I came in.

(then)

Can you just...?

QUINCY

(beat)

You sure?

QUINCY (cont'd)

Damn girl...

QUINCY (cont'd)

They want you.

Congratulations.

I don't know some of you very well yet,

and you don't know me because I'm still

being nice to you.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

But my philosophy is simple. Hard work

and sacrifice.

There's a lot of basketball history and

pride here at USC, but just putting on

the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a

great player.  Hard work and sacrifice

makes you a great player.  What you were

doesn't matter anymore.  For the first

time in your life, you won't be the best.

You'll be going up against women that are

bigger and stronger and better than you

ever imagined.  So the question is, how

will you respond?  Well, your answer

better be hard work and sacrifice because

that's the only way you're gonna make it

through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and

I teach it, "There is only one way to

succeed at anything and that is to give

everything."

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock

curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on

time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,

no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no

getting pregnant.  And finally, respect

yourselves, respect your coaches and

respect your teammates, right Sidra?

SIDRA

That's right, Coach.

COACH MILLER

By the end of this year some of you will

hate me...

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Some of you will want to go home...

UPPERCLASSMEN

(cat-calling)

Cree!

COACH MILLER

But I guarantee you, if you work hard and

sacrifice, all of you will be better

basketball players and better people.

COACH MILLER

Let's go, freshmen, you're getting

spanked!

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of

Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no

heart!

COACH MILLER

Way to work, Zvette.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Get lower, Monica, move your feet.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

I said lower!

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

This is low, got it?  Offense sells

tickets, defense wins games!

SIDRA

Dag, you took her out, T.

SANDRA

I think she just said "Mommy."

LISA

No, she said "mammary."

COACH MILLER

Monica, you trying to tell me you can't

take a little challenge?

MONICA

I can take it.

COACH MILLER

This time get your feet set.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Next!

SIDRA

You got it, c'mon, lift!

SIDRA (cont'd)

That's it.

MONICA

Coach hates me, doesn't she?

SIDRA

She hates all freshmen.

MONICA

What's up with that?

SIDRA

Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't

think just cause we play the same

position we have to compete with each

other.  We're teammates, okay?

MONICA

Thanks, Sidra.

SIDRA

Besides.  I've been starting point the

last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb-

ass freshman is taking my spot.

MONICA

You finish the reading for E-con?

QUINCY

Yeah.

MONICA

What'd it say?

QUINCY

Basically broke down how I'm gonna make

mad loot in the NBA, me being such a

limited commodity and all.

MONICA

Whatever, big head.

GIRL #1

Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the

Final Four?

QUINCY

We'll see.

GIRL #2

We'll be watching.

QUINCY

What?

MONICA

You do see me standing here, right?

QUINCY

I can't be nice to a fan?

MONICA

Fine, Quincy.

QUINCY

I can't help girls coming up to me.

MONICA

I said fine.

QUINCY

It's okay, little baby.

MONICA

(struggling)

Quit.

QUINCY

Shhh.  Daddy's here.

MONICA

You're such a punk.

QUINCY

All these girls...you're the only one I

know who's for real.

MONICA

Always.

INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

COACH MILLER

Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Monica!  Get over here.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

While you're so busy posing, your man

just scored!

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

Show me again.

MONICA

What?

COACH MILLER

You love to pose so much, let's see it

again.

COACH MILLER (cont'd)

I want you to stand like that for the

rest of practice.

MONICA

Coach...

COACH MILLER

I want you to stand like that until

you're sick of it because I don't ever

want to see it again, you hear me?

(then)

Dora, take her spot.

LISA

Z, I know you're gonna shower first.

ZVETTE

I don't smell bad.

SANDRA

And you wonder why your ass sits alone on

the bus.

CREE

You guys curse too much.

SANDRA

Since when is "ass" a curse?

MAEYEN

Whoa, it's as big as yours.

SIDRA

That's what you get for trying to show

out, freshman.

MONICA

I was just playing ball.

SIDRA

You were trying to make me look bad.

MONICA

Didn't have to try very hard.

SIDRA

Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy

seconds?

MONICA

What?

TONI

Sidra, let it go.

SIDRA

Only reason you're here is cause Tonya

Randall got pregnant and decided not to

come.  They were done recruiting.

KELLI

That's cold, Sid.

SIDRA

Just thought the girl should know.

SHAYLA

Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause

she's bow-legged.

INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

QUINCY

Forget Tonya Randall.

MONICA

I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was

here instead of me.

QUINCY

Then prove her wrong.

MONICA

I don't have it easy like you, alright.

There's no red carpet laid out for me.

QUINCY

So you're gonna act salty all night?

REGGIE

Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.

QUINCY

Nah, thanks.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Fine.  Don't worry about proving

everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle

the pressure, I'll understand.

MONICA

That was so weak.

QUINCY

Who cares if you're never known as the

first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more

play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Aaaah!  Damn, girl!

MONICA

That's what you get.

QUINCY

So how about a little one-on-one?

MONICA

What are we playing for?

QUINCY

Clothes.

MONICA

What?

QUINCY

I score, you strip.  You score, I drop

something.

MONICA

Give me the ball.

QUINCY

My court, I go first.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Strip.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Where's the "D"?

MONICA

Kiss my booty.

QUINCY

Plan to.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Hold up...

MONICA

All's fair in love and basketball.

Strip.

MONICA (cont'd)

Too bad you got your mama's height, huh.

QUINCY

Oh, my bad.

MONICA

Yo, where's the "D"?

QUINCY

Right here.

MONICA

I won.

QUINCY

I wanted you to.

INT. ESPN STUDIOS

DICK VITALE

It's the start of the new college season

and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too

many great teams to choose from.  You

have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas',

but my surprise treat this season...

ROBIN ROBERTS

...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the

Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning

four starters from that squad.  And many

consider their recruiting class one of

the best in the nation.  The highlight of

that class,...

DICK VITALE

...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper

dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime-

time player.  Every college in the

country wanted him but he chose to follow

in his father's footsteps and become a

Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his

shoulders this season...

ROBIN ROBERTS

...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if

just one of her freshmen has a breakout

year, they can go all the way.  It's a

long season, anything can happen, but one

thing is for sure...

DICK VITALE

It's gonna be awesome, baby!

CUT TO:

INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

QUINCY

...up and under between two defenders,

with the left hand.  That's gotta make

SportsCenter.

QUINCY (cont'd)

They can't stop me, Pop...

TERRY

What are you having, Zeke?

ZEKE

Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for

my kid.

TERRY

Cross-over's looking good, Quincy.  I

know your old man didn't teach you that.

ZEKE

Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.

QUINCY

You know, the numbers I'm putting up are

better than any freshman.  Some people

are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.

ZEKE

What people?

QUINCY

You know, people.

ZEKE

Well, tell them to mind their damn

business.  You're smart enough to get a

degree.

QUINCY

I'm also good enough to go pro.

ZEKE

You know how much higher the play level

is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to

develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The

NBA ain't going nowhere.

QUINCY

You came out early.

ZEKE

Your mom got pregnant and I had to make

choices.  You don't have a choice.

QUINCY

Okay...

ZEKE

Besides, the sooner you go pro, the

sooner you'll have to deal with the mess

I'm dealing with.

QUINCY

What mess?

ZEKE

there's this thing out there.  This

paternity suit.

QUINCY

What?

ZEKE

Some girl that's been hanging on at every

party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's

Daddy.

(then)

Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be

the one who told you.

QUINCY

Tell me what?

ZEKE

I just told you.

QUINCY

I mean, it's not true, is it?

ZEKE

You got the balls to ask me that?

QUINCY

Sorry.

ZEKE

No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say

it.  It's not true.

QUINCY

So what are you gonna do?

ZEKE

I want this thing to go to court, but my

lawyer's telling me to settle.

QUINCY

Why?

ZEKE

A case like this could hang around for

months and I'm up for this player

relations job with the "Clips."  This

gets out, false or not, no one'll touch

me.

QUINCY

What's Mom think?

ZEKE

We haven't exactly been living the fairy-

tale life the past few years.  Something

like this happens, it either brings a

family closer or pushes them further

apart.  We'll just have to see how it

plays out.

(then)

I'm giving her some space, couple

days...

COLLEGE STUDENT

Yo, Q-man, great game.

QUINCY

Thanks.

COLLEGE STUDENT

Can I get an autograph?

NONA

You scared me.

QUINCY

Sorry.  You okay?

NONA

I'm fine.

QUINCY

Last time I remember you drinking was

when Marvin Gaye died.

QUINCY (cont'd)

This about Dad?

NONA

Guess he talked to you.

QUINCY

Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later

the truth'll come out.

NONA

(beat)

Whose truth are you talking about?

QUINCY

Mom, we can't let something like this

mess up the family.

QUINCY (cont'd)

I mean, you believe him, right?

QUINCY (cont'd)

Mom?

NONA

Just...leave it alone.

QUINCY

This is just about money, you know that.

NONA

Quincy, please...

QUINCY

I mean, how many times have you told me

yourself to watch out for these ho's?

NONA

Guess I should have been telling your

father.

QUINCY

So you're gonna take the word of some

trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

QUINCY (cont'd)

What...what's this?

NONA

I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that?

After all his late nights and "meetings"

and I still needed proof.

NONA (cont'd)

I used to think I was lucky just to be

married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too

tired.

EXT. TRACK - NIGHT

QUINCY

Don't put your hands in your pockets,

hold your head up, always look a man in

the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on

his every word like he's God or

something...

MONICA

I know he messed up, but that doesn't

change what he's been to you.

QUINCY

What has he been to me?  I mean, he

looked me in my face and lied like it was

nothing.  Like it was easy.

(then)

And I'm standing there getting loud on my

mom like she's the one with no sense...

MONICA

She understands.

QUINCY

He even had me wanting to play for the

"Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.

MONICA

You're not stupid.

QUINCY

I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,

I just never thought my pops would do

some shit like this...

QUINCY (cont'd)

What?

MONICA

Nothing.

(beat)

Why don't we walk to my dorm?

QUINCY

I'm not up for running into anybody.

Let's just kick it here, alright?

MONICA

I...can't.

QUINCY

Why not?

MONICA

Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.

If I'm late, I don't suit up.

QUINCY

Didn't realize you were watching the

clock.

MONICA

I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.

QUINCY

Nah.  Don't sweat it.

MONICA

Quincy...

QUINCY

For real.  I should be alone, anyway.

MONICA

Will you call me when you get in?

MONICA

I shouldn't have left.

SHAYLA

Go to sleep.

MONICA

You should have seen him, Shay...

SHAYLA

Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you

got the start.  But you get caught

breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send

your ass back to the bench.  You'll see

your man tomorrow.

Hell yeah.

LISA

Oh damn, Mon.

MONICA

What?

LISA

I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis

with that charge.

MONICA

Kiss my ass.

SANDRA

Nah, I think she took that too.

MONICA

Sandra, please, last time you chest-

bumped me, it took you three tries.

MONICA (cont'd)

Yo, T, why you so quiet?

TONI

(beat)

I don't want to go play overseas.

DORA

I thought you were hyped about going to

Portugal next year.

TONI

It's never gonna be like this.  Playing

in front of my family, hanging out with

my girls.  Probably not even a

McDonald's.

SANDRA

Nah, there's always a McDonald's.

SIDRA

Least you got an offer.  My agent's

still looking.

CREE

(to Lisa)

What about you?

LISA

(beat)

Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day

I could come back here and play.  But for

right now, it's law school.

COACH MILLER (O.S.)

Monica.

COACH MILLER

You could've given up after you threw

that ball away.  But you kept your head

and you showed real heart.

MONICA

Thanks.

COACH MILLER

We've got our final games against Oregon

and Oregon State and I want to shake

things up a bit, so I'm starting you at

point again.

MONICA

(confused)

I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next

game.

COACH MILLER

You want the job or not?

MONICA

Yeah.  Yes.

COACH MILLER

What?

MONICA

It's just...it seems like you're always

yelling at me.

COACH MILLER

You think I'd go hoarse for a player with

no potential?   When I ignore you, that's

when you worry.

Go get dressed.

Sorry about your game.

It happens, right...

SHAYLA

What's up, superstar.

(then, to Quincy)

Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?

QUINCY

(beat)

I heard.

SHAYLA

She also tell you she ganked the starting

spot from Sidra?

QUINCY

Nah.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Where's the keg at?

SHAYLA

Balcony.

REGGIE

What's up, dog?

(to Shayla)

Hey, flyness.

SHAYLA

Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a

ho.

REGGIE

Coach is gonna kill us in practice

tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off

your dick, limp as your game was tonight.

QUINCY

That's funny.

MONICA

he's just playing, Q...

QUINCY

You think for once we could talk about

something besides basketball?

SHAYLA

Sure.

REGGIE

Whatever's clever.

MONICA

Y'all need to quit.

SIDRA (O.S.)

Monica.

MONICA

What's up?

SIDRA

Just wanted to say good game.

MONICA

But?

SIDRA

No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take

that charge.

MONICA

Thanks.

SIDRA

But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.

Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

SIDRA (cont'd)

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.

MONICA

I know.

SIDRA

Just one word of advice for next season.

MONICA

What's that?

SIDRA

Never let a freshman take your spot.

KERRY

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

What's your name?

KERRY

Kerry.

QUINCY

Q.

KERRY

I know.

KERRY (cont'd)

I'll see you.  Q-man.

MONICA

Who was that?

QUINCY

Nobody.

MONICA

Who's nobody?

QUINCY

Look, this party's whack.  You ready to

go?

MONICA

You want to go talk?

QUINCY

Not really.

MONICA

We could finish what we were talking

about last night.

MONICA (cont'd)

Q...

Quincy, quit.  You're drunk.

QUINCY

You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

ZEKE

Your door was unlocked.

QUINCY

Still is, so let yourself out.

ZEKE

We need to talk.

QUINCY

We ain't got nothing to talk about.

ZEKE

I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I

ain't that kid's father.

QUINCY

Lucky kid.

ZEKE

Look, I ain't saying it was right, but

sometimes things happen.

QUINCY

And some things should never fucking

happen!

ZEKE

Boy, you're so perfect you can look down

on me?

QUINCY

I ain't a damn liar.

ZEKE

Your mom was real quick to show you those

pictures, wasn't she?

Well, she was nineteen when she got

pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're

the best thing in my life, but she knew I

wasn't ready for no marriage.

QUINCY

So now you're saying my mother trapped

you?

ZEKE

I'm saying I handled my responsibilities

like a man.  But when you're in the NBA,

you pull into a city and there's a

hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And

another twenty that made it past security

on your floor.  And the boldest one is

standing right at your door.  And after

awhile, it just becomes part of the game.

(then)

I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't

have.  But I did it cause I love you.

QUINCY

Since we're being honest, guess I should

tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and

going pro.

ZEKE

What?

ZEKE (cont'd)

Quincy, you'd be making the biggest

mistake of your life.

QUINCY

(sarcastic)

From your mouth.

ZEKE

I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't

let you do this.

Didn't know I needed a reason to come

Yeah.

Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.

But it's just a game.

Can we talk?

MONICA

Talk to your new girlfriend.

QUINCY

I just took the ho to Burger King,

alright.

MONICA

Cheap date.

QUINCY

Least she had time for me.

MONICA

So you fucked around to prove a point!

QUINCY

I just said I didn't fuck around.  But

you got your head so far up your ass it

took a cheap date for you to notice me.

MONICA

What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your

ass like everybody else?

QUINCY

You forgot to be there.

MONICA

That night you wanted to talk about your

Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed

to do?

QUINCY

Stay!

MONICA

If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!

QUINCY

Least you got your priorities straight.

MONICA

I never asked you to choose.

QUINCY

Never had to.

MONICA

I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what

that means it should be you.

QUINCY

Well, if all you care about is

basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck

Dick Vitale.

QUINCY (cont'd)

Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright.

MONICA

How do I know next time you're feeling

neglected or whatever, you're not going

to run around on me?  If we're going to

be together I have to be able to trust

you.

QUINCY

I'm not asking for us to be together.

MONICA

What?

QUINCY

I'm going through a lot of shit right

now, more than you have time for.

MONICA

How are you going to tell me what I have

time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we

can fix this.

QUINCY

I don't think so.

MONICA

You don't think so?

QUINCY

Look, I'm entering the draft.

MONICA

You're what?

QUINCY

I decided to go pro.  And who knows where

I'll end up, you know?

MONICA

When did you decide all this?

QUINCY

Few days ago.

MONICA

So that's it, just forget about us?

QUINCY

Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us

anymore, it's about me.

QUINCY (cont'd)

But, you know, I'd still like us to be

friends.

about a thousand goats running around,

and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then

the whack club I'm on loses three games

in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire

me.

MONICA

Just like that?

SIDRA

Yup.  So I've been playing with this

Italian club the last three years.

MONICA

How's that been?

SIDRA

It's better.  Even though the whole first

season my teammates didn't pass to me

cause they were mad "The American" was

making more money.

(smiles)

I led the team in rebounds cause it was

the only way I could touch the damn ball.

SIDRA (cont'd)

Most of us don't win championships our

first year overseas.

MONICA

Please, I went through the same drama as

everybody else.  I mean, the first four

months, only person I could talk to was

this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words

of English from watching old "Dif'rent

Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to

tell her if she said, "What you talking

bout, Willis?" one more time, I was

gonna kick her ass.

SIDRA

So what are these Spanish guys like?

MONICA

I wouldn't know.

SIDRA

What?  You've been over here seven months

and you ain't tapped anything?

MONICA

Just not my type, I guess.

SIDRA

Shoot, Italian boys love them some black

women.  They can't get enough of me.

MONICA

You ever think about going back?

SIDRA

Sometimes.  But what's the alternative,

not playing?  You remember big Toni?

(off Monica's nod)

She quit last year, now she's working at

some bookstore.  I mean, look at us.

They treat us like we're Hollywood stars

over here.  We just played in the

championship game.  It doesn't get much

sweeter than this.

INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT

CHICK HEARN

Stu, this game is in the refrigerator.

The door is closed, the lights are out,

the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's

jigglin'.

STU LANTZ

And here come the subs.

STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)

It's good to see these guys get a little

playing time.  And the fans love it.

CHICK HEARN

Three-pointer is off for the kid from

SC.  Came out after his freshman year,

now in his fifth year with the league.

STU LANTZ

The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve

years with the Clippers.

CHICK HEARN

(nods)

Pretty good player.  The kid's moved

around quite a bit, but he's hoping to

finally have a home with the Lakers.

CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)

Watch out, folks, it's showtime.

ZEKE

Nona.

ZEKE (cont'd)

How's he doing?

NONA

Not great.

ZEKE

What's that, not great?

NONA

The doctor'll be back in a minute.

ZEKE

Nona, please.

NONA

He tore his ACL.

ZEKE

Almost didn't recognize you with your

hair like that.  How you been?

NONA

Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

ZEKE

Hey, son.

ZEKE (cont'd)

Well, you made SportsCenter.

QUINCY

What do you want?

ZEKE

Came by to check on you.

QUINCY

After five years.

ZEKE

Don't remember that being my fault.

Seems like you divorced me same time as

your mom.

QUINCY

Look, I'm busy.

ZEKE

I can see that.  I know things look

pretty bleak right now, but you can't get

down on yourself.

QUINCY

I stopped taking your advice a long time

ago, or did you forget?

ZEKE

No.

QUINCY

Good.

ZEKE

Quincy.  I know you left school early to

throw your middle finger up at me.

QUINCY

And now I'm paying for it, right?  That

what this is about?  "I told you so?"

ZEKE

You want me to fuck off?

QUINCY

Yeah.

ZEKE

Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say

something.

ZEKE (cont'd)

You're a better ballplayer than I ever

was.  But you got a lot of other things

going for you.  You're smart.  I always

felt...I always knew that you could do

anything you wanted.  You want to be a

ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know

you ain't like everybody else on that

court.  You ain't like I was.  You got

options.  That's all I ever tried to show

you.

QUINCY

You're still trying to tell me what I

should and shouldn't do.  How come you

couldn't be the man you kept trying to

make me?

ZEKE

I just couldn't

And I thought this was gonna be awkward.

QUINCY

Monica?

MONICA

I'm sorry.

MONICA (cont'd)

So, how you doing?

QUINCY

Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.

MONICA

I was.

(smiling)

I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.

QUINCY

Just something I'm trying.

MONICA

No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.

QUINCY

Thanks.

MONICA

Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

QUINCY

I'm alright.  But you can sit.

MONICA

I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.

QUINCY

Yup.

MONICA

What are the doctors saying?

QUINCY

(shrugs)

A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be

back in six months.

MONICA

I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

QUINCY

Not for Quincy McCall.

MONICA

I forgot, "Q-man."

QUINCY

So, how's pro-ball, Europe?

MONICA

We won the championship.

QUINCY

Still working on being the first girl in

the NBA?

MONICA

Well, I tried sneaking in after college,

but they found breasts during my

physical.

QUINCY

Funny.  I never did.

MONICA

Kiss my ass.

MONICA (cont'd)

I can't believe it's been five years.

QUINCY

Tried calling you a couple times.

MONICA

Oh yeah?

QUINCY

Wanted to give you props on making First

Team All-American.  And then when Magic

retired, I tried calling you again.

MONICA

(lying)

Must have been my cheap-ass answering

machine.  It was always messing up.

QUINCY

Figured it was something like that.

QUINCY (cont'd)

So, when do you go back?

MONICA

Actually, I don't...

QUINCY

What do you mean?

MONICA

I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking

about giving it a rest for awhile.

QUINCY

(completely thrown)

A rest?

MONICA

Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun

anymore.  You know?

QUINCY

No.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Quincy!

KYRA

I'm so sorry.  No one would switch

flights with me.

QUINCY

It's okay.

KYRA

Why are you up?  Get in bed.

KYRA (cont'd)

Tell me you're going to be okay.

QUINCY

I'm gonna be okay.

KYRA

Hello.

QUINCY

Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

KYRA

(recognizing)

Monica.  You grew up together, right?

Quincy's told me about you.

QUINCY

This is Kyra.  My fiance.

MONICA

Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.

KYRA

Thank you.

MONICA

I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.

(then)

Well...I should go.

QUINCY

It means a lot that you came by.

KYRA

Yes, we appreciate that.

MONICA

Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your

knee, and everything.

QUINCY

Thanks.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY

MONICA

Hey.

CAMILLE

Hi.

MONICA

Need any help?

CAMILLE

I can manage.

CAMILLE (cont'd)

Your sister's bringing the baby over.

You should try to be here.

MONICA

Yeah.  Can't wait to see him

(she falls silent, then)

I just saw Quincy.

CAMILLE

How is he?

MONICA

Engaged.

CAMILLE

To that stewardess?

MONICA

Yeah, you met her?

CAMILLE

His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.

He could do a lot better if you ask me.

MONICA

Maybe she is.

CAMILLE

I thought you were over him.

MONICA

So what do I do?

CAMILLE

Find out where they're registered and

send them a gift.

MONICA

(disgusted)

Whatever.

CAMILLE

You didn't want my opinion in the first

place, so why even ask?

MONICA

I asked but why does it always have to be

so damn prissy.

CAMILLE

Don't curse.

MONICA

There you go.

CAMILLE

What do you want me to tell you, Monica,

to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex

with him?  I'm not going to do that.

Yes, I believe thinking of other people

is important and yes I'd rather bake a

pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that

makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

MONICA

So that's why we can't get along?

Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump

shot?

CAMILLE

You're the one always turning your nose

up at me.

MONICA

No I don't.

CAMILLE

Child, please.  Ever since you were

little you thought you were too good for

anything I had to say.

MONICA

I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail

polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray

of your perfume.

CAMILLE

What was so wrong with wanting to teach

you the things I knew could help you?

MONICA

Because you're pushing me to be something

I'm not.

CAMILLE

So you're angry with me because you're

standing here with your hair combed and

wearing perfume?

MONICA

I'm angry because I want a mother, not

Martha Stewart.

CAMILLE

Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete

whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

MONICA

That's not it.

CAMILLE

Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that

because I know.

MONICA

I remember when I was eight years old,

you spent like four hours cooking up this

fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do

was set the table.  And I guess you and

Dad got your wires crossed or something

because he walks in with a couple of

pizzas.  And you didn't say anything.

You just threw the whole meal into some

tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

CAMILLE

I don't remember that.

MONICA

I do.  You never stood up for yourself.

Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because

of that.

CAMILLE

That's ridiculous.

MONICA

What's ridiculous is not being a caterer

so your husband can feel like a man

knowing his woman's home cooking and

ironing his drawers.

CAMILLE

Dammitt, Monica!

MONICA

I'm sorry.

CAMILLE

Is that really all you think of me?

CAMILLE (cont'd)

When I married your father, all I wanted

was a nice house with a big kitchen so I

could start my catering business.  And

then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I

got pregnant with you.  And I put it out

of my mind because that's what you did.

CAMILLE (cont'd)

But you want to know what day I remember?

In high school, you getting ready for the

Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around

your neck, told you you were beautiful

and you looked like you were going to

cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have

a catering business to run off to.  My

family had three meals a day, had someone

to pick up after them, and when my

daughters went to a dance, I helped them

get ready.  That's what I came to care

about.

MONICA

(softly)

That's all you cared about.  I must have

played in a thousand games and I can only

remember you being to two.

CAMILLE

You had your coaches and your father for

that stuff.  It never mattered one way or

the other if I went to your games.

MONICA

It mattered, Mom.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY

QUINCY

Damn, girl.

KYRA

What?

QUINCY

I don't wanna see that.

KYRA

Get used to it, babe.

QUINCY

Brother's gonna have to start locking

doors.

QUINCY

So how long is this trip?

KYRA

Four days.

KYRA (cont'd)

So are you going to be the kind of

husband who won't let his wife work?

QUINCY

Nah.

KYRA

(playfully)

Why not?

QUINCY

You might be the only one with a job.

KYRA

Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's

going well.  You'll be back before you

know it.

QUINCY

Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.

Busting my ass, for what?

KYRA

To do what you love.

QUINCY

I don't know sometimes.

KYRA

You're just scared.  I know rehab is

hard, and you have to worry about whether

you'll be as good as you were but you

will be.  I believe in you.  You just

have to get back on the court.  Like

you'd get back on a horse.

QUINCY

(beat)

A horse?

KYRA

Don't make fun of me when I'm being

wonderful and supportive.

(then)

You belong on the court.  Just like I

belong in the stands, looking cute and

cheering you on.

NATHAN

Hey, munchkin.

MONICA

Dad.  What are you doing here?

NATHAN

I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been

hearing good things about you.

MONICA

That tends to happen when you're the

boss's daughter.

NATHAN

So how's the job going?

MONICA

You know.

NATHAN

I think I know what the problem is.

NATHAN (cont'd)

There.

MONICA

You shoot like a girl.

NATHAN

I'll take that as a compliment.

MONICA

(whispering)

And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-

on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

MONICA (cont'd)

(still whispering)

It's good!  It's good!

QUINCY

I remember when your mom had to beat you

into a dress.

MONICA

You visiting?

QUINCY

(nods)

Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured

I'd keep Mom company.

MONICA

Who's this guy I always see her around?

QUINCY

Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

MONICA

So...how's the knee?

QUINCY

Getting there.

MONICA

Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

QUINCY

Yeah.  Two weeks.

(then)

I didn't get to send you an invitation,

but if you...

MONICA

That's okay.  I'm probably, you know,

busy.

QUINCY

Can I ask you something?

QUINCY (cont'd)

You never told me why ball isn't fun

anymore.

MONICA

It just isn't.

QUINCY

Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

MONICA

You had a rough couple years, that's all.

QUINCY

That a nice way of saying I rode the

bench?

MONICA

And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is

tough.

QUINCY

Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four

and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of

the attention, but besides that...

MONICA

You're serious.

QUINCY

Seems like I needed a ball when I was

trying to be like my pops...or trying to

be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I

need to try something else.

MONICA

Like what?

QUINCY

Maybe go back to school.

MONICA

Wow.

QUINCY

I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school

thing yet.

(then)

She'll probably say it's the painkillers

talking.

MONICA

It's a trip, you know?  When you're a

kid, you see the life you want, and it

never crosses your mind that it's not

gonna turn out that way.

QUINCY

So why'd you give up ball?

MONICA

Why do you keep asking me that?

QUINCY

Cause I don't get it.

MONICA

Something was just missing.

QUINCY

What?

MONICA

It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave

it alone.

QUINCY

Find.

You might want to put a jacket on him,

it's getting cold.

LENA

He's fine.

CAMILLE

(warning)

Okay.

LENA

Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too

cold.

CAMILLE

God.  "Grandma."

CAMILLE (cont'd)

You know, I'd probably be a lot more

"prissy" in the situation than you'd

like, but the thing I always admired that

drove me crazy, was the fight you had in

you.

MONICA

What are you talking about?

CAMILLE

When I said Quincy could do better, I was

thinking about you.

INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

QUINCY

(half-asleep)

What's going on?

MONICA

We need to talk.

MONICA (cont'd)

Please.

QUINCY

Hold on.

MONICA

You asked me what was missing.

QUINCY

What?

MONICA

From basketball.

QUINCY

you woke me up to tell me that?

MONICA

It's not fun for me anymore because

you're missing.

MONICA (cont'd)

What I'm trying to say is --

QUINCY

I heard enough.

MONICA

What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you

since I was eleven and the shit won't go

away.

QUINCY

We haven't talked since college and now

you wait two weeks before my wedding to

say something like this?

MONICA

I know, I probably should have said it

two weeks ago.

QUINCY

You haven't changed.  You still think the

sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,

guess what, it doesn't.

MONICA

Then why are you so upset?

QUINCY

Because you don't pull this on someone

who's about to get married.

MONICA

Better late than never, right?

QUINCY

Wrong.

MONICA

I'll play you.

QUINCY

What?

MONICA

One game.  One-on-one.

QUINCY

For what?

MONICA

Your heart.

QUINCY

You're out of your mind.

MONICA

So you're gonna bitch up?

QUINCY

What's that supposed to be, psychology?

MONICA

I know why you broke up with me in

college.  And not that what you did

wasn't messed up, but what I did was,

too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive

you.

QUINCY

Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I

couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I

was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that

was five years ago.  I moved on.

MONICA

Prove it.

QUINCY

What will this prove?

MONICA

You once said the reason I beat you was

because you wanted me to.

QUINCY

So?

MONICA

So, if I win it's because deep down you

know you're about to make the biggest

mistake of your life, and deep down your

want me to stop you.

QUINCY

And what happens when you lose?

MONICA

If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding

present.
