CUT TO:

HANNAH

What do you want?

JANE

Shelter.

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.

HANNAH

I can't take in vagrants. Here's

a penny. Now take it and go.

JANE

I have no strength to go.

HANNAH

You can move off. And if there

are others with you tell them we

are not alone. We have a

gentleman here, and dogs.

JANE

(DESPERATE)

But I must die if I am turned

away.

JANE (CONT'D)

God help me. I will die.

ST JOHN

All of God's creatures must die.

But not prematurely - and not on

my doorstep I hope.

HANNAH

We've had a beggar woman come, Mr

Rivers. I sent her - For shame!

ST JOHN

You did your duty in excluding

her. Let me do mine in admitting

her.

DIANA

St John, who is it?

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 5.

ST JOHN

I don't know; I found her at the

door.

HANNAH

(GUILTILY)

I thought her one of the gypsies

from the cross.

MARY

She's as white as death.

DIANA

Hannah, some water.

MARY

She's worn to nothing. She looks

like a spectre. St John, if you

hadn't taken her in, we would

have fallen upon her dead body in

the morning.

DIANA

Mary.

ST JOHN

She's no vagrant; I'm sure of it.

HANNAH

There's milk and bread for you.

ST JOHN

Ask her her name.

JANE

I - I am J -

JOHN REED

Jane Eyre!

DIANA

Please, tell us how we may help

you.

ST JOHN

Can we send for anyone? Who are

your people?

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6.

JOHN REED (V.O.)

Jane Eyre! Where are you?

JOHN REED

Come out, rat. I know you are in

here. Come out now and I won't

punish you.

JOHN REED (CONT'D)

Rat.

CUT TO:

ST JOHN (V.O.)

Diana, Mary help me get her

upstairs...

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7.

JOHN REED

I have been looking for you these

last ten minutes.

JANE

What do you want?

JOHN REED

Say forgive me, Master Reed.

JANE

I have done nothing wrong. Master

Reed.

JOHN REED

Who gave you permission to read

my book?

JANE

I wasn't aware it was yours.

JOHN REED

Everything in this house is mine.

You're lucky to live here with

gentleman's children like us.

Your father had nothing. You

should go and beg.

JOHN REED (CONT'D)

That's for the look you had on

your face. You bad animal.

JANE

Wicked and cruel - you are a

slaver - a murderer -

JOHN

I shall tell mother -

JANE

I hate you John Reed. I hate you -

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8.

JOHN

Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat!

BESSIE

For shame, hitting your master.

MISS ABBOT

If you don't sit still you must

be tied down!

BESSIE

What we do is for your own good.

If you are passionate and rude

like this, your Aunt Reed will

send you away.

MISS ABBOT

You're worse than us servants. We

work for our keep; you do

nothing. Pray for forgiveness

Miss Eyre or something bad will

come down that chimney and fetch

you away.

Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9.

BESSIE

Miss Eyre what is it?

JANE

Bessie!

BESSIE

Have you seen something?

JANE

There was a light.

MRS REED

Bessie, I gave orders that she

was to be left in the red room

until I came.

BESSIE

But she screamed so loud ma'am.

MRS REED

It is play-acting. Let her go. I

know your tricks Jane Eyre and I

abhor such artifice. Loose

Bessie's hands, child.

MRS REED (CONT'D)

You will now stay here an hour

longer.

JANE

No - Aunt, have pity -

MRS REED

And only when you are perfectly

submissive will I let you out.

JANE

Please - I cannot bear it -

MRS REED

Silence. This violence is

repulsive.

JANE

I shall be killed -

MRS REED

Get back!

JANE

Have mercy, have mercy I beg you -

MARY

She's awake.

ST JOHN

I'm sure we'll find she's simply

had a misunderstanding with her

people. I hope she's not done

anything deplorable; there's

nothing so sad as a fallen young

woman.

MARY

Look at the suffering in her

eyes. They're like dark pools -

DIANA

She has a peculiar face; I rather

like it.

ST JOHN

She's not at all handsome.

DIANA

She's so ill, St John.

ST JOHN

Ill or well, she'll always be

plain.

BROCKLEHURST

There is no sight so sad and so

deplorable as that of a wicked

little girl. Do you know, Jane

Eyre, where the wicked go after

death?

JANE

They go to hell.

BROCKLEHURST

And what is hell, can you tell me

that?

JANE

A pit full of fire.

BROCKLEHURST

And should you like to fall into

that pit and be burning there

forever?

JANE

No sir.

BROCKLEHURST

What must you do to avoid it?

JANE

I must keep in good health and

not die.

MRS REED

I've been her sole benefactress

and her kindest friend. But she

shows no gratitude and brings

nothing but discord into my

house.

BROCKLEHURST

What is her parentage?

MRS REED

She's an orphan. Her mother was my

late husband's sister. On his

deathbed he exhorted me to care for

her. I have always treated her as

one of my own.

MRS REED (CONT'D)

If you accept her at Lowood school

Mr Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye

on her. Her worst fault is a

tendency to deceit. I'm sorry to

tell you that Jane Eyre is a liar.

BROCKLEHURST

All liars will have their portion

in the lake burning with fire and

brimstone. She shall be watched,

Mrs Reed.

MRS REED

I wish her to be made useful, to

be kept humble.

BROCKLEHURST

You can rest assured dear lady

that we mortify our girls in the

sentiments of vanity and pride.

They are taught to be quiet,

plain and modest.

BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)

We shall root out the wickedness

in this small, ungrateful plant.

MRS REED

And as for its vacations, it must

spend them all at Lowood.

JOHN

So, Rat, you're being sent away.

It's as I thought; you're not fit

to associate with me.

JANE

You are not fit to associate with

me!

JANE

You said I was a liar. Well I am

not. If I was, I should say that I

loved you and I don't. I dislike

you the worst of anybody in the

world except John Reed. He is a

liar, not I.

MRS REED

How dare you speak in this manner.

JANE

I'll never call you Aunt again as

long as I live and if anyone asks

how I liked you I'll say that the

very thought of you makes me sick.

MRS REED

You wouldn't dare.

JANE

I'll remember how you thrust me

back into the Red Room and locked

me there to my dying day. Even

when you knew it was haunted and I

begged to be let out. People think

you are good but you are bad and

hard-hearted and I'll let everyone

at Lowood know what you have done!

MRS REED

Children must be corrected for

their faults.

JANE

Deceit is not my fault!

MRS REED

But you are passionate.

JANE

My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can

see all that you do and think; so

can my mother and father. They know

how you hate me and wish me dead.

They can see. They see everything

you do and they will judge you, Mrs

Reed.

BESSIE

You're such a queer, solitary

little thing. If only you could

make yourself more appealing.

Perhaps if you tried smiling from

time to time, people would find

you more pleasant -

JANE

Don't scold me Bessie. I know you

dislike me -

BESSIE

I don't dislike you Miss; I'm

fonder of you than of anyone.

JANE

You don't show it.

BESSIE

Miss Jane -

BESSIE (CONT'D)

You take good care of her.

MISS TEMPLE

What's your name, child?

JANE

Jane Eyre.

MISS TEMPLE

You are very young to be sent

alone, Jane Eyre.

JANE

My name is Jane Elliott...

MARY

Jane Elliot.

DIANA

Where do you come from, Miss

Elliott?

ST JOHN

Who can we send for to help you?

JANE

No one.

ST JOHN

Do you mean to say that you are

absolutely without home and

without friends?

JANE

Yes sir.

ST JOHN

How did you come to be roaming

the moors, Miss Elliott?

DIANA

Don't upset her, St John. She

must not be interrogated so.

JANE

Mr Rivers, you and you sisters

have done me a great service, the

greatest man can do - you have

rescued me from death.

ST JOHN

How are we to help you if we know

nothing about you?

JANE

I'll tell you as much as I can. I

am an orphan; brought up a

dependent; educated in a charity

school where I passed six years

as a pupil and two as a teacher.

I left a year since to become a

private governess -

MARY

YES -

JANE

A good situation, where I

remained until...

MARY

Diana, didn't I say so? Didn't I

say she was a governess?

DIANA

We did wonder. We mean no offence

but you have a certain look. Mary

and I work as governesses too.

JANE

(with great interest)

Do you?

MARY

We are currently trying to teach

ourselves German, so we may find

better positions.

JANE

You're not working at present?

DIANA

We came home only for our

father's funeral.

MARY

He died three weeks ago.

JANE

I am very sorry to hear it.

ST JOHN

Why did you leave your place of

employment?

JANE

I... It was a catastrophe.

ST JOHN

What did you do?

JANE

I am free from any blame, sir. I

was happy.

DIANA

That's enough for now, St John.

MARY

You must rest, Miss Elliott.

ST JOHN

Why did you start?

JANE

Because that is not my name.

DIANA

You haven't given us your real

name?

ST JOHN

Why not?

JANE

Because I must not ever be found.

ST JOHN (V.O.)

Merciful Jesus, enlighten thou me

with the brightness of thine

inward light...

ST JOHN (V.O.)

And take away all darkness from

the habitation of my heart...

ST JOHN

Join me to thyself with an

inseparable band of love... For

thou, even thou alone, dost

satisfy him that loveth thee...

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

And without thee all things are

vain and empty. Amen.

JANE, MARY, DIANA

Amen.

DIANA

Welcome to our table, Miss

Elliott.

JANE

I'd appreciate it if you called

me Jane. It is my own name.

MARY

It's wonderful to see you on your

feet, Miss Jane.

JANE

I trust I will not be eating long

at your expense, Mr Rivers.

ST JOHN

You wish to be independent of my

charity?

JANE

I wish to work, sir. Show me how

to work or how to seek work;

that's all I ask.

DIANA

You're not fit enough to work.

ST JOHN

My sisters have always taken

pleasure in keeping injured birds

but I'm more inclined to put you

in a way of keeping yourself -

and shall endeavour to do so, if

that's what you wish.

JANE

With all my heart, sir.

DIANA

It's a shame she has no choice of

helpers, St John, and must put up

with such crusty people as you.

ST JOHN

This school you were at, Miss

Elliot, this charitable

institution; what did it prepare

you for?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Was it a thorough education?

JANE

Most thorough.

MISS SCATCHERD

Burns, Helen Burns!

MISS SCATCHERD (CONT'D)

You're a slattern and a disgrace!

BROCKLEHURST

I might have known. The new girl.

Step forward, Jane Eyre.

BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)

It is my duty dear children, to

warn you that this girl is not

one of God's own lambs.

BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)

She is a castaway and an alien in

his flock and you must be on your

guard against her. For this

child... is a liar!

BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)

This is the pedestal of infamy -

and you'll remain upon it all

day. You'll receive no sustenance

and no comfort, for you must

learn how barren is the life of

the sinner. Children, I exhort

you to shun her, exclude her,

shut her out from this day forth.

Withhold the hand of friendship

and deny your love to Jane Eyre,

the liar.

HELEN

Come now, don't cry.

JANE

You're not allowed to speak to

me. I must be shunned.

HELEN

Mr Brocklehurst is not a God.

He's not liked or admired here -

JANE

He said I was a liar.

HELEN

JANE -

JANE

I am not a liar!

HELEN

If your own conscience approves

you, then so will I.

JANE

How do you bear it?

HELEN

Bear what?

JANE

Being struck.

HELEN

I'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd.

She hits me to improve me.

JANE

If she hit me I would get that

birch from her hand and break it

under her nose.

HELEN

You'd just be punished even more.

It's part of life here.

JANE

I have always been excluded and

alone and hated. Miss Abbott used

to call me an ugly little toad.

HELEN

You're not ugly. Do you know what

is inside you?

JANE

What?

HELEN

The spark of your spirit, the

principle of light and thought,

pure and bright, as perfect as

anything created.

JANE

What do you mean?

HELEN

Your soul. Your soul is beautiful,

your soul has value - more value

than anything on earth.

JANE

Is that true?

HELEN

Yes. God sees your beauty. Even

as you stand on that stool, there

is an invisible world around you,

a kingdom of spirits. It is

everywhere. Angels see your pain.

Angels know your innocence.

JANE

Angels?

HELEN

Do you not believe in angels?

MISS TEMPLE

Come here, Girls.

MISS TEMPLE (CONT'D)

I shall investigate Mr

Brocklehurst's claims against

you, Jane. And unless they are

proved, you will be exonerated.

MISS TEMPLE (CONT'D)

Also, I understand you girls

have had no food today.

MARY

We've lived here all our lives but

the house must be shut up now.

JANE

Why?

MARY

We can't afford to keep it on.

Diana and I will return to our

charges in a few days and St John

will go to his parsonage.

DIANA

It'll be a hard parting for us. We

may not see him again for years.

JANE

Why ever not?

MARY

He means to be a missionary. He's

going to India to do Gods's work.

JANE

Can he not do God's work here?

MARY

This quiet parish will never do for

him; he almost raves in his

restlessness. It breaks our hearts.

DIANA

St John burns with talents and

ambition. But he lacks the means

for advancement here. Our poverty

thwarts him at every turn and so he

has chosen to lay all his gifts on

God's altar.

MARY

We've tried to persuade him to

stay but in some things our

brother is - he is -

DIANA

Inexorable as death.

MARY

We are now without father. We'll

soon be without home and brother.

JANE

In one thing you are fortunate.

JANE (CONT'D)

You have each other.

MISS TEMPLE

This is the result of semi-

starvation and neglected colds;

Brockelhurst's idea of mortifying

their bodies to save their souls.

TYPHUS -

MADAME PIERROT

Write to the governors. You must.

JANE

Helen.

HELEN

Is it you, Jane? Have you come to

say goodbye?

JANE

You're cold.

HELEN

I'm very happy. I am going home.

JANE

Back to your father?

HELEN

My father has a new wife. He'll

not miss me much.

JANE

Then where?

HELEN

To my future home, where all is

light. I am going to God.

JANE

No...

HELEN

Don't be sad. I will escape great

suffering by dying young.

JANE

No...

HELEN

I don't have any talent to make

my way in life. I should be

always at fault. But God is my

friend. He loves me.

JANE

Then he must save you.

HELEN

He is saving me.

HELEN (CONT'D)

I feel like I could sleep now. I

like to have you near -

JANE

I won't leave you.

HELEN

You're so warm and alive. Jane,

you have a passion for living.

MISS TEMPLE

Jane...

JANE

No, no, no -

MARY (V.O.)

Jane?

JANE

Have you something for me to do?

MARY

You are doing something already.

May I see?

JANE

That's Miss Temple on her wedding

day. She was my teacher; a great

influence on me. Under her

guidance I became a teacher too.

MARY

St John -

JANE

No, Mary, please -

MARY

See how skilled Jane is.

MARY (CONT'D)

She is better than any drawing

master we have ever had.

ST JOHN

How fierce I am, Miss Elliott.

JANE

Mr Rivers, I wondered if you had

yet heard of any work that I

could do.

ST JOHN

I found you a situation some days

ago but I've delayed telling you

because the work is lowly and I

fear you'll scorn it.

JANE

I shan't mind what I do.

ST JOHN

As I am poor and obscure, the

help I can offer is of the

meanest sort.

DIANA

St John, what are you going to

offer her? Not washerwoman, I hope?

ST JOHN

When I took over the parish two

years ago it had no school. I

opened one for boys; I now intend

to open one for girls. The school

mistress will have a two-roomed

cottage paid for by local

benefactors and she will receive

fifteen pounds a year. You can see

how humble, how ignoble it is.

JANE

Mr Rivers, I thank you heartily

and I accept with all my heart.

ST JOHN

But you comprehend me? It's a

village school - cottagers

daughters. What will you do with

all your fine accomplishments?

JANE

I will save them until they are

wanted. They will keep.

BROCKLEHURST

I hear you are to leave us, Miss

Eyre.

JANE

Yes. Excuse me.

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

If Jane Eyre of Lowood School...

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

...Who advertised in the Yorkshire

Herald, possesses the acquirements

mentioned...

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

...And if she is in a position to

give satisfactory references, a

situation can be offered where there

is but one pupil, a little girl

under ten years of age and where the

salary is thirty pounds a year.

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

Jane Eyre is requested to send

references and all particulars to

Mrs Fairfax at Thornfield Hall.

MRS FAIRFAX

How do you do, my dear? What a

long and tedious journey you must

have had of it. John is quite the

slowest driver in the county. You

must be cold to the bone.

JANE

Are you Mrs Fairfax?

MRS FAIRFAX

Indeed I am; come and warm

yourself in here.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

Your poor hands must be quite

numb; here, let me help you.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

Leah, make a little hot port and

cut a sandwich or two.

MRS FAIRFAX

Draw nearer the fire. John is

taking your trunk up to your room.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I've put you at the back of the

house; I hope you don't mind. The

rooms at the front have much

finer furniture but they are so

gloomy and solitary I think.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I'm so glad you are come. To be

sure this is a fine old house but

I must confess that in winter one

can feel a little dreary and

alone. Leah is a very nice girl

and John and Martha good people

too, but they are servants - and

one cannot talk to them on terms

of equality.

JANE

Am I to have the pleasure of

meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?

MRS FAIRFAX

Who?

JANE

Miss Fairfax - my pupil?

MRS FAIRFAX

Oh you mean Miss Varens; Mr

Rochester's ward. She is to be

your pupil.

JANE

Who is Mr Rochester?

MRS FAIRFAX

Why, the owner of Thornfield.

JANE

I thought Thornfield Hall

belonged to you.

MRS FAIRFAX

(bursting into laughter)

Oh bless you child, what an idea.

To me? I am only the housekeeper.

JANE

Forgive me -

MRS FAIRFAX

There is a distant connection

between Mr Rochester and I - his

mother was a Fairfax - but I'd

never presume on it. Heavens, me,

owner of Thornfield?

MRS FAIRFAX

We shall have a cheerful house

this winter...

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

With Miss Varens here - and with

you - we'll have quite a merry

time of it.

MRS FAIRFAX

I'm sure that last winter - and

what a severe one - if it didn't

rain it snowed and if it didn't

snow it blew a gale - last winter

I declare that not a soul came to

the house from November to

February.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I got quite melancholy night

after night alone. When spring

finally came I thought it a great

relief that I hadn't gone

distracted.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

Here.

JANE

OH -

MRS FAIRFAX

Good night, my dear. I hope

you'll be comfy.

JANE

Thank you.

JANE

What a beautiful house.

MRS FAIRFAX

Mr Rochester's visits here are

always unexpected. He doesn't

like to arrive and find

everything all swathed up, so I

keep it in constant readiness.

Now, come and meet Miss Varens.

Did I mention she was French?

ADELE

(IN FRENCH)

Sophie has been crying because no

one understands. Nobody can speak

to us except for Mr Rochester and

he has gone away.

MRS FAIRFAX

Would you ask her about her

parents? Mr Rochester's neglected

to tell me anything about her.

JANE

(IN FRENCH)

Where did you live Adele, before

you came to Thornfield?

ADELE

(IN FRENCH)

With Maman - but she is gone to

the Holy Virgin now.

JANE

Her mother has passed away.

ADELE

(IN FRENCH)

Maman used to teach me to dance

and say verses. When gentlemen

came to see her I used to dance

for them or sit on their knees

and sing. May I sing for you now?

JANE

(IN FRENCH)

Well - that would be lovely.

(To Mrs Fairfax)

Adele is going to show us her

accomplishments.

MRS FAIRFAX

How very French...

ADELE

Me! It is me!

MRS FAIRFAX

Here. For you.

JANE

Who's there?

JANE (CONT'D)

Who sleeps up here?

MRS FAIRFAX

No one. This part of the house is

quite empty, except for you and me.

JANE

I heard someone.

MRS FAIRFAX

You can't have done.

JANE

A laugh. Someone laughed.

MRS FAIRFAX

Oh - that must be Grace Poole.

She likes to sit up here with her

sewing. Rather an eccentric soul.

(She shouts sharply)

Grace? Grace!

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

Miss Eyre has heard a laugh.

MRS FAIRFAX

I thought I might find you up here.

I've been waiting to pour our tea.

JANE

I'm not in need of tea, thank you.

MRS FAIRFAX

What is it, child? You've been

here three months now and I'm

worried that the position is not

enough / to occupy your -

JANE

Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so

thankful to be at Thornfield.

Please don't think I'm so

ungrateful as to be discontented.

MRS FAIRFAX

But it's a quiet life, isn't it?

This isolated house; a still doom

for a young woman...

JANE

I wish a woman could have action

in her life, like a man. It

agitates me to pain that the sky-

line over there is ever our

limit. I long sometimes for a

power of vision that would

overpass it. If I could behold

all I imagine... I've never seen

a city, never spoken with men.

I've never even seen a town of

any size. And I fear my whole

life will pass, without ever

having...

MRS FAIRFAX

Well now - exercise is a great

cure for anything, they say.

(MORE)

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I have some letters to post; will

you take them?

ROCHESTER

What the deuce -

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Hellfire.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY!

JANE

Can I do anything, sir?

ROCHESTER

Get back.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Mesrour. Mesrour.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Damnation.

JANE

Are you injured, sir?

JANE (CONT'D)

If you are hurt and want help I

can fetch someone from the

village. I'm on my way there to

post a letter.

ROCHESTER

Where do you come from?

JANE

Thornfield Hall.

ROCHESTER

Whose house is that?

JANE

Mr Rochester's.

ROCHESTER

Do you know Mr Rochester?

JANE

No, I've never seen him.

ROCHESTER

You're not a servant there...

JANE

I am the governess, sir.

ROCHESTER

The governess.

(A slow smile)

Deuce take me, I had forgotten.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

The governess.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Have you got an umbrella I can

use as a stick?

JANE

No.

ROCHESTER

Then try to get hold of his

bridle and lead him to me.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

If you would be so kind...

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Perhaps it would be easier to

bring me to the horse. Come here.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Forgive me. I must beg of you to

come here.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Mesrour.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Thank you.

(He bows.)

Now, make haste with your letter.

MRS FAIRFAX

Mr Rochester is here.

JANE

Oh?

MRS FAIRFAX

Go and change your frock; he wishes

to meet you.

JANE

I have to change?

MRS FAIRFAX

Oh yes - I always dress for the

evening when Mr Rochester is here.

JANE

But all my dresses are the same.

MRS FAIRFAX

(DESPERATELY)

You must have one that is better?

He's in a terrible humour; the

doctor has been. His horse fell

in Hay lane and his ankle is

sprained.

MRS FAIRFAX

Here is Miss Eyre, Sir.

ROCHESTER

(Without looking up)

Let her sit.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I have examined Adele and I find

you've taken great pains with

her. She's not bright, she has no

talents - yet in a short time

she's made much improvement.

JANE

Thank you.

ROCHESTER

You've been resident here three

months?

JANE

Yes, sir.

ROCHESTER

And from whence do you hail;

what's your tale of woe?

JANE

Pardon?

ROCHESTER

All governesses have a tale of

woe; what's yours?

JANE

(SLIGHTLY INSULTED)

I was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs

Reed of Gateshead, in a house far

finer than this. At ten years old

I went to Lowood school where I

received as good an education as

I could hope for. I have no tale

of woe, sir.

ROCHESTER

Where are your parents?

JANE

Dead.

ROCHESTER

Do you remember them?

JANE

No.

ROCHESTER

And why are you not with Mrs Reed

of Gateshead now?

JANE

She cast me off, sir.

ROCHESTER

Why?

JANE

Because I was burdensome and she

disliked me.

ROCHESTER

Lowood; that's a charity school,

isn't it?

JANE

Yes.

ROCHESTER

How long did you survive there?

JANE

Eight years.

ROCHESTER

No tale of woe...

MRS FAIRFAX

I daily thank providence for

sending us Miss Eyre. She's a

kind and patient teacher and an

invaluable / companion -

ROCHESTER

Don't trouble yourself to give

her a character. I'll judge for

myself. She began by felling my

horse.

MRS FAIRFAX

Sir?

ROCHESTER

I have her to thank for this

sprain.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Adele has brought me these; are

they yours?

JANE

Yes sir.

ROCHESTER

Where did you get your copies?

JANE

Out of my head.

ROCHESTER

That head I now see on your

shoulders?

JANE

Yes sir.

ROCHESTER

Who's this?

JANE

The evening star.

ROCHESTER

Why did you bewitch my horse?

ADELE

Tonight I will have my cadeaux.

He always bring me a cadeaux.

MRS FAIRFAX

Sorry to disturb. He's asked for

your art.

JANE

What for?

MRS FAIRFAX

He wishes to have it.

JANE

Why?

MRS FAIRFAX

To show to his company, I should

think. Is this it here? Thank you.

ADELE

Monsieur!

ROCHESTER

Ah, there she is...

ADELE

Ma boite, ma boite!

ROCHESTER

Take it away you genuine daughter

of Paris and amuse yourself with

disembowelling it.

MRS FAIRFAX

We'll open it together, shall we?

ROCHESTER

Miss Eyre. Sit there.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I'm not fond of children.

ADELE

Oh Ciel! Que c'est beau!

ROCHESTER

Nor do I particularly enjoy

simple-minded old ladies. But you

might suit me - if you would.

JANE

How, sir?

ROCHESTER

By distracting me from the mire

of my thoughts.

ADELE

Monsieur, je vous remercie mille

fois de votre bonte...

ADELE (CONT'D)

That is how Maman used to say, is

it not?

ROCHESTER

Precisely.

MRS FAIRFAX

Let's try it on, shall we?

ROCHESTER

(TO HIMSELF)

And that is how she charmed my

English gold out of my English

breeches pocket.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Your gaze is very direct, Miss

Eyre? D'you think me handsome?

JANE

No sir.

JANE (CONT'D)

I was too plain; I beg your pardon.

ROCHESTER

What fault do you find with me? I

have all my limbs and all my

FEATURES -

JANE

Mr Rochester, it was a blunder.

I ought to have replied that

beauty is of little consequence -

ROCHESTER

Now you stick a knife under my

EAR -

JANE

You have other qualities, sir.

ROCHESTER

Just so; other qualities... When

I was your age I was a felling

enough fellow. I might have been

insulted then. You're blushing

Miss Eyre.

JANE

Not at all.

ROCHESTER

And though you're not pretty any

more than I am handsome, I must

say it becomes you.

(HE LAUGHS)

And now I see you're fascinated

by the flowers on the rug.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I'd like to draw you out. Come,

speak to me.

JANE

What about, sir?

ROCHESTER

The choice of subject is entirely

yours.

JANE

How can I introduce a subject

when I don't know what'll

interest you?

ROCHESTER

The fact is, Miss Eyre, I don't

wish to treat you like an

inferior.

JANE

Yet you'd command me to speak?

ROCHESTER

Well I probably have a right to

be a little abrupt and exacting

on the grounds of my superiority

in age. There must be twenty

years between us and a century's

advance in experience.

JANE

I don't think you have a right to

command me just because you're

older. Your claim to superiority

depends on the use you've made of

your time and experience.

ROCHESTER

I've made indifferent use of

both. And this is why I sit,

galled by my own thoughts - and

order you to divert me. Are you

very hurt by my tone of command?

JANE

There are few masters who'd

trouble to enquire whether their

paid subordinates were hurt by

their commands.

ROCHESTER

Oh yes... paid subordinate; I'd

forgotten the salary. Well on

that mercenary ground, will you

consent to speak with me as my

equal - without thinking that the

request arises from insolence?

JANE

I'd never mistake informality for

insolence, sir. One, I rather

like. The other, nothing free

born should ever submit to - even

for a salary.

ROCHESTER

Humbug. Most free-born things

would submit to anything for a

salary. But I mentally shake

hands with you for your answer.

(MORE)

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Not three in three thousand

schoolgirl governesses would have

answered me as you've just done.

JANE

You've clearly not spent much

time in the company of schoolgirl

governesses. I'm the same plain

kind of bird as all the rest,

with my couple of accomplishments

and my common tale of woe.

ROCHESTER

I envy you.

JANE

How?

ROCHESTER

Your openness, your clear

conscience, your unpolluted mind.

If I were eighteen I think we truly

would be equals. Nature meant me to

be a good man, one of the better

kind and as you see, I am not so.

JANE

Are you a villain then, sir?

ROCHESTER

I'm a trite commonplace sinner,

hackneyed in all the dissipations

that the rich and worthless try

to put on life.

(HE SIGHS)

When I was your age, fate dealt me

a blow. I was - cursed with a

burden to carry through life. I

lacked the wisdom to remain cool

and I turned desperate. Dread

remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the

poison of life.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

And since happiness is denied me,

I've a right to get pleasure in

its stead. And I will get it,

cost what it may.

JANE

Then you'll degenerate still more.

ROCHESTER

Are you preaching to me?

JANE

I'm reminding you of your own

words; remorse is the poison of

life.

ROCHESTER

But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I

was seeking was sweet and fresh;

if it was an inspiration; if it

wore the robes of an angel of

light... what then?

JANE

I don't know. To speak truth, I

don't understand you at all.

ROCHESTER

My heart has long been a charnel

house. Perhaps it'll transform

into a shrine.

JANE

Sir, I find the conversation has

got out of my depth.

ROCHESTER

You're afraid of me because I

talk like a sphynx.

JANE

I'm not afraid.

ROCHESTER

Yes you are.

JANE

I've simply no wish to talk

nonsense.

ROCHESTER

If you did it would be in such a

grave, quiet manner that I would

mistake it for sense. Do you

never laugh, Miss Eyre?

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Only rarely, perhaps. But you're

not naturally austere, any more

than I'm naturally vicious. I can

see in you the glance of a curious

sort of bird through the close set

bars of a cage: a vivid, restless,

resolute captive. Were it but free,

it would soar. Cloud high.

JANE

Just as it turns to come down -

that's when you hit it.

JANE (CONT'D)

Mademoiselle has got to rest.

ADELE

Because I start to win!

JANE

Have mercy, Adele. Play with

Pilot for a while.

JANE (CONT'D)

Is our game disturbing you, sir?

ROCHESTER

On the contrary. I like your game.

I like this cold, hard day. I like

Thornfield.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I've been arranging a point with

my destiny, Miss Eyre. My destiny

stood up there by that chimney,

like one of the hags who appeared

to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?'

She said. 'Like it if you dare'.

Well, I dare. It's felt like a

plague house for years -

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

But Thornfield is my home and I

shall like it!

ADELE

Mademoiselle - Il faut jouer -

ROCHESTER

Get back! Keep at a distance

child, or go in!

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

She's the daughter of an opera

dancer, Celine Varens. Celine was a

beauty and she professed to love

me. Her ardour was so great that,

ugly as I am, I believed myself her

idol. So I installed in her in a

hotel, gave her servants, gowns

cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I

was an idiot.

JANE

To fall in love, sir?

ROCHESTER

You've never felt love, have you

Miss Eyre? Your soul still sleeps.

JANE

Does it?

ROCHESTER

You're still floating gently in

the stream of life, unaware of

the rocks ahead waiting to dash

you to pieces.

JANE

Were you dashed to pieces, Mr

Rochester?

ROCHESTER

Not by Celine. How can one ever

truly love a woman one has paid

for?

(MORE)

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

It ended when I visited her

unexpectedly one night and caught

her with her handsome, charmless

lover. I overheard her waxing

lyrical on all my defects - she was

mercenary, heartless, senseless.

The whole intoxication fell away

like a dream. I left her money to

support the little French floweret

over there, whom she swore blind

was mine. I see no proof of my grim

paternity in her features; I think

Pilot is more like me than she.

JANE

But you took her on?

ROCHESTER

Some years later, I heard that

Celine had abandoned the brat,

disappeared to Italy and left it

destitute. So I lifted it from the

mud and slime of Paris and brought

it here, to grow up clean in the

wholesome soil of an English

country garden. My one good work in

a sea of countless sins.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was

the most usual thing in the world

for a man like me to tell stories

of his opera-mistresses to an

inexperienced girl like you. Adele?

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Forgive me; for keeping Miss Eyre

from your game for so long.

JANE

Who's there?

JANE (CONT'D)

Wake up! Wake up! Sir!

ROCHESTER

Who's there?

JANE

It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.

ROCHESTER

What in the name of all the elves in

Christendom have you done with me?

JANE

For heaven's sake get up. Somebody

has plotted something; you must

find out who. I'll light the lamp -

ROCHESTER

Light the lamp at your peril.

JANE

I heard a laugh outside my door

loud enough to wake me. I opened

it. Someone was running towards

the third floor.

JANE (CONT'D)

And a candle was left burning in

the middle of the floor. Shall I

fetch Mrs Fairfax, sir?

ROCHESTER

What the deuce can she do?

JANE

Then I'll wake John and Martha.

ROCHESTER

Not at all. Stay here. You're

shivering.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I have to go to the third floor.

Don't make a sound. Sit there. I

shan't be long.

ROCHESTER

Did you see anything when you

opened your chamber door?

JANE

Only the candle on the ground.

ROCHESTER

But you heard a laugh?

JANE

Yes.

ROCHESTER

Have you heard that laugh before?

JANE

There's a woman who sews here;

Grace Poole - She laughs in that

way, I think.

ROCHESTER

Just so. Grace Poole - you have

guessed it. Well, you're no

talking fool; please say nothing

about this.

JANE

BUT -

ROCHESTER

I will account for this state of

affairs. Go back to your room and

say nothing.

JANE

Yes, sir.

(She takes off his coat)

Good-night.

ROCHESTER

Is that how you're going to leave

me?

JANE

You said I should go.

ROCHESTER

Jane, fire is a horrible death. You

have saved my life. Don't walk past

me as if we were strangers.

JANE

What am I to do then, sir?

ROCHESTER

At least... shake hands.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I have a pleasure in owing you my

life.

JANE

There is no debt.

ROCHESTER

I knew you would do me good in some

way. I saw it in your eyes when I

first beheld you. Their expression

did not - did not strike delight

into my very inmost being so, for

nothing. People talk of natural

sympathies... You.

JANE

Good night then, sir.

ROCHESTER

So you will leave me?

JANE

I'm cold.

ROCHESTER

Go.

GRACE

Good day to you, miss.

JANE

What's happened here?

GRACE

(CANNILY)

Only master reading in his bed

last night.

(MORE)

GRACE (CONT'D)

Fell asleep with his candle lit

and the curtains got on fire.

Managed to put it out with the

water from his stand.

Did you not hear anything, miss?

JANE

I did. I heard a strange laugh.

GRACE

It's hardly likely the master

would laugh when he was in such

danger. Perhaps you were dreaming.

JANE

I was not.

GRACE

Then you didn't think of opening

your door and looking out?

JANE

Has Mr Rochester not sent for us

today?

MRS FAIRFAX

Why, he's gone away. Were you not

aware? He left after breakfast.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

He's gone to The Leas, Mr

Eshton's place, about ten miles

from here. I believe Blanche

Ingram is there. She's a great

favourite of his.

JANE

Oh?

MRS FAIRFAX

I saw her two years ago when Mr

Rochester had a party here. Oh,

she was a beauty; I daresay the

most elegant girl I've ever seen.

So tall, with raven hair cascading

down her back; I don't know how

she'd had it done. She sang a duet

with Mr Rochester. They made a

lovely harmony.

(MORE)

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I was quite surprised he didn't

make a proposal. Perhaps that is

his intention now.

ADELE

Qu'avez vous mademoiselle?

JANE

(without looking at her)

Nothing. Speak in English,

please.

JANE

Thank you, girls. You may go.

ST JOHN

Do you find the work too hard?

JANE

Not at all. I'm getting on very

well.

ST JOHN

Do you feel the solitude an

oppression?

JANE

I hardly have time to notice it.

ST JOHN

Then perhaps your accommodations

have disappointed you. They are

in truth scanty enough -

JANE

A few months ago I had nothing. I

was wretched. Now I have a home

and work; free and honest. I

wonder at the goodness of God and

at the generosity of my friends.

ST JOHN

What you had left before I met

you, I don't know. But I counsel

you to resist firmly every

temptation to look back.

JANE

It's what I mean to do.

ST JOHN

We can overcome every kind of human

weakness. A year ago I was myself

intensely miserable. I considered

my life was so wretched that it

must be changed - or I would die.

After a season of darkness and

struggling, light broke. I heard my

call from God. Put your trust in

him, Jane. Let him lead you to your

future.

JANE

Thank you.

JANE (CONT'D)

Why were you intensely miserable?

ST JOHN

A year ago, I was weak enough to

fall in love.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Don't pity me; I have no compassion

whatsoever for you. I regarded this

love as a fever of the flesh; not a

thing that would ever touch my

soul. I scorned the weakness,

fought hard against it - and won.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

I could have listened to

temptation, sunk down in the silken

snare and known a feverish and

delusive bliss. I could have

squandered my future upon it.

JANE

You could have been happy.

ST JOHN

A slave in a fool's paradise? I'd

rather my life had purpose -

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Is this yours?

JANE

Yes.

JANE (CONT'D)

What's the matter?

ST JOHN

Nothing in the world.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Good night.

MRS FAIRFAX

He's back in three days he says -

heavens that's Thursday - and not

alone. He gives directions to

prepare all the best rooms. I'm to

get more staff from the George

Inn. The ladies will bring their

maids, the gentlemen, valets. We

must accommodate them all.

Supplies to be got; linen, the

MATTRESSES -

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I'll get started. I'll go to the

George. No, I'll tell Martha...

JANE

May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax?

UNDER COOK

She gets good wages, I'd guess?

LEAH

Wish I had as good; not one fifth

what Mrs Poole receives.

LEAH (CONT'D)

And she's laying it all by. I

shouldn't wonder if she's saved

enough to keep her independent.

UNDER COOK

She's a good hand, I daresay.

LEAH

Not everyone could do it, that's

for sure, not even for the money.

UNDER COOK

No wonder the master relies on

HER -

UNDER COOK (CONT'D)

Doesn't she know?

ADELE

They're here! They're here!

MRS FAIRFAX

Thank you.

JANE

Excuse me, miss.

ROCHESTER

Good evening.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

May I?

JANE

What is it, darling?

ADELE

She sing like Maman.

MRS FAIRFAX

Tonight. He wants you both in the

drawing room after dinner.

JANE

Not me, surely.

MRS FAIRFAX

It's his particular wish.

JANE

He was being polite.

MRS FAIRFAX

I'm instructed to tell you that

if you resist, he'll come up and

get you himself. You needn't stay

long. Just let him see you and

then slip away. Don't worry; no

one'll look at you.

JANE

May I present Miss Adele Varens?

ADELE

Bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs.

BLANCHE

Why, what a little puppet.

LADY INGRAM

(mutton dressed as lamb)

Is this your ward, Mr Rochester?

ROCHESTER

Yes.

LOUISA ESHTON

(English rose; nineteen)

What a love of a child.

BLANCHE

I thought you weren't fond of

children?

ROCHESTER

You're right; I'm not.

BLANCHE

Then what induced you to take

charge of that little doll?

ROCHESTER

She was left on my hands.

BLANCHE

Why don't you send her to school?

ROCHESTER

She has a governess.

BLANCHE

You should hear mamma on the

chapter of governesses. I had

half a dozen in my day - all

detestable, ridiculous incubi -

were they not, mamma?

LADY INGRAM

Did you speak, my lily flower?

BLANCHE

I said governesses.

LADY INGRAM

Oh, don't mention them; the very

word makes me nervous! I've

suffered a martyrdom from their

incompetence and caprice. I thank

heaven we're now done with them.

BLANCHE

I have just one word to say of

the whole tribe; nuisance.

BLANCHE (CONT'D)

We shall have music - and new

subject, if you please. Signor

Eduardo, what shall it be?

ROCHESTER

Donna Bianca, I give you beauty.

BLANCHE

Beauty? Why there's nothing new

to be said. I give you back male

beauty. Mamma, what's your idea

of male beauty?

LADY INGRAM

My son, of course.

LORD INGRAM

Hear hear.

BLANCHE

Oh, Tedo's quite typical of the

young men of today. They're so

absorbed in the pursuit of

fashion that they've forgotten

how to be men at all.

LORD INGRAM

I say -

BLANCHE

A woman who neglects herself is a

blot on humanity. But a man

should pay no heed to his looks.

(Glancing at Rochester)

A man should possess only

strength and valour. He could be

a gentleman or a highwayman. His

beauty lies in his power.

ROCHESTER

So a Levantine pirate would do

for you?

BLANCHE

(QUIETLY)

As long as he resembled you.

BLANCHE (CONT'D)

I am serious. To my mind, a man

is nothing without a spice of the

devil in him.

ROCHESTER

Why did you leave the room?

JANE

I am tired, sir.

ROCHESTER

Why didn't you come and speak to

me? I haven't seen you for weeks.

It would have been normal and

polite to wish me good evening.

JANE

You seemed engaged, sir.

ROCHESTER

What have you been doing while

I've been gone?

JANE

Teaching Adele.

ROCHESTER

You look pale.

JANE

I am well.

ROCHESTER

You're depressed; your eyes are

shining with tears. What's the

meaning of this?

MRS FAIRFAX

A gentleman has arrived to see

you, sir.

ROCHESTER

Who?

MRS FAIRFAX

He says he's travelled a long

way, from Spanish Town, Jamaica -

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

And indeed I think he must have

come from some hot country because

he won't take off his coat.

ROCHESTER

Spanish Town...

MRS FAIRFAX

Mr Richard Mason. He says you're

old friends. I've put him in the

morning room.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

Have I done wrong?

ROCHESTER

Not at all. Please tell him I'll

see him directly.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Oh Jane - Jane. This is a blow.

JANE

Can I help you sir?

ROCHESTER

Jane, if all those people came and

spat at me, what would you do?

JANE

Turn them out of the room sir, if

I could.

ROCHESTER

And if they cast you out for

adhering to me?

JANE

I should care nothing about it.

ROCHESTER

You'd dare censure for my sake?

JANE

For the sake of any friend who

deserved it.

MASON

Fairfax...

ROCHESTER

Richard. How the devil are you?

HELEN

He is yours.

MASON (O.S.)

Help! Rochester, for God's sake

come!

LADY INGRAM

Oh what is it?

BLANCHE

Who is hurt?

LORD INGRAM

Where the devil is Rochester?

ROCHESTER

I'm here, be composed.

BLANCHE

What awful event has taken place?

ROCHESTER

A servant has had a nightmare,

that's all. She's an excitable,

nervous person and has taken a

fit with fright.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Now I must see you back into your

rooms because until the house is

settled, she can't be properly

looked after.

BLANCHE

Is there anything I might do?

ROCHESTER

Miss Ingram, ladies, please

return to your nests like the

doves that you are. You'll take

cold for certain if you stay in

this icy gallery any longer.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Come this way. Make no noise.

ROCHESTER

Be steady. I need you.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Wait.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Thank you, Mrs Poole.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Here. Bring the candle.

MASON

Am I dying?

ROCHESTER

No.

MASON

She bit me - while the knife was

in - Bit me -

ROCHESTER

It was folly to attempt the

interview tonight and alone.

MASON

I thought I might have done some

good.

ROCHESTER

It makes me impatient to hear

you.

MASON

She sucked the blood. Said she'd

drain me - like a vampire -

ROCHESTER

Think of her as dead, dead and

buried. Say nothing!

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I am going for a doctor. I must

leave you here with him. Sponge

the blood away when it returns.

Give him water if he wants it. Do

not speak to him for any reason.

And Richard - on pain of death -

do not speak to her.

DR CARTER

I only wish I could have got here

sooner. He'd not have bled so much.

ROCHESTER

Jane, make sure the way is clear.

ROCHESTER

I'll ride over tomorrow to see

how you do. Goodbye, Richard.

MASON

Fairfax - Let her treated as

tenderly as may be -

ROCHESTER

I do my best and have done it and

will do it!

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Come, Jane. That house is a

dungeon, don't you feel it?

JANE

It seems to me a splendid

mansion, sir.

ROCHESTER

It is slime and cobwebs.

JANE

Will Grace Poole stay here now?

ROCHESTER

Oh yes, don't trouble your head

about her.

JANE

But sir -

ROCHESTER

Grace Poole is not the danger.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

You've noticed my tender feelings

for Miss Ingram?

JANE

Yes sir.

ROCHESTER

Keep vigil with me again, the night

before I marry. For now you've met

my lovely one and you know her.

She's a rare one, isn't she?

JANE

Yes sir.

ROCHESTER

A strapper, a real strapper; big

and buxom...

JANE

I'd do anything for you sir,

anything that was right.

ROCHESTER

(GENTLY)

And if I ever bid you do what was

wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet

and pale and say 'I cannot do

it.' And you'd be as immutable as

a fixed star.

JOHN

That's for the look you had on

your face.

JANE

Excuse me, sir.

BLANCHE

Does that creeping creature want

you?

JANE

If you please, I want leave of

absence for a week or two.

ROCHESTER

What to do?

JANE

This is from my old nurse, Bessie.

She says my cousin John Reed is

dead. He ruined himself and has

committed suicide. The news has so

shocked his mother, my Aunt, that

it's brought on a stroke.

ROCHESTER

What good can you do her?

JANE

She's been asking for me. I

parted from her very badly and I

can't neglect her wishes now.

ROCHESTER

Promise me you won't stay long.

JANE

Sir, it seems you are soon to be

married.

ROCHESTER

What of it?

JANE

Adele should go to school.

ROCHESTER

To get her out of my bride's way

who might otherwise trample her?

JANE

And I must seek another situation.

I intend to advertise.

ROCHESTER

At your peril you advertise. Trust

it to me. I'll find you a good

situation in time.

JANE

And sir? Forgive me but I have had

no wages as yet.

ROCHESTER

How much do I owe you?

JANE

Fifteen pounds.

ROCHESTER

Here's fifty.

JANE

That's too much.

ROCHESTER

Take your wages.

JANE

I cannot.

ROCHESTER

Then I only have a ten.

JANE

(TAKING IT)

Now you owe me five.

ROCHESTER

Just so. Come back for it quickly.

Meantime, I shall safeguard it in

here.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Do you trust me to keep it, Jane?

JANE

(SMILING)

Not a whit, sir. You are not to

be trusted at all.

BESSIE

Bless you! - I knew you'd come.

JANE

Bessie... I'm not too late? How

is Mrs Reed?

BESSIE

She may linger yet a while. She's

spoken of you daily. At first we

couldn't tell what she was saying

but when her speech came clear we

heard 'Jane Eyre, get Jane Eyre.'

JANE

Shall I see her now?

BESSIE

I'll take you up directly. But look

at you. What a lady you've become.

Why you're almost pretty.

JANE

Aunt Reed? It is Jane Eyre. You

sent for me, and here I am.

MRS REED

No one knows the trouble I have

with that child. Such a burden.

Left on my hands. Speaking to me

like a fiend. The fever at

Lowood. She should have died!

JANE

Why do you hate her so?

MRS REED

Her mother. Reed's sister - his

beloved. When news came of her

death he wept like a fool. Sent

for the baby. Sickly thing - not

strong like mine. But Reed loved

it. Kept it by his bed. Made me

vow to bring the creature up. Why

did he not love mine?

MRS REED (CONT'D)

Who are you?

JANE

I am Jane Eyre, Aunt.

MRS REED

You. Is there no one in the room?

JANE

We are alone.

MRS REED

I've twice done you wrong. I

broke the vow I made to Reed -

JANE

Please, don't think of it -

MRS REED

I am dying; I must get it out!

MRS REED (CONT'D)

Open that box. Take out the

letter. Read it.

JANE

'Madam, will you have the goodness

to send me the address of my

niece, Jane Eyre. I desire her to

come to me at Madeira. Fortune has

blessed my endeavours and as I am

childless I wish to adopt her and

bequeath her at my death whatever

I may have to leave. Yours, John

Eyre, Madeira.'

JANE (CONT'D)

This is dated three years ago.

Why did I never hear of it?

MRS REED

Because I wrote and told him you

had died of typhus at Lowood

school. You fury. You were born to

be my torment. I'll never forget

how you turned on me and raged.

(MORE)

MRS REED (CONT'D)

You called the names of the dead

down upon me. I was afraid.

JANE

Forgive me.

MRS REED

You cursed me.

JANE

I would have loved you if you'd

let me.

MRS REED

My life has been cursed.

JANE

Please, let us be reconciled.

JANE (CONT'D)

Then love me or hate me as you

will. You have my full and free

forgiveness. Now ask for God's -

and be at peace.

JANE

My mother.

JANE (CONT'D)

Why ever was I so afraid?

JANE (V.O.)

My dear uncle, some years ago, my

Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you

that I had died.

JANE (V.O.)

I am writing to tell you that I

am very much alive and living at

Thornfield Hall, where I am

currently governess to the ward

of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester -

ROCHESTER (O.S.)

There you are.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Just like one of your tricks to

steal into your home along with

the twilight. Where the deuce

have you been this last month?

JANE

I have been with my aunt sir, who

is dead.

ROCHESTER

A true Janian reply. If I dared

I'd touch you, to see if you were

real...

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Go home - stay your wandering

feet at a friend's threshold.

JANE

Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm

strangely glad to get back again to

you. Wherever you are is my home.

MRS FAIRFAX

We're expecting the announcement

very soon. He went down to London

only last week to buy her a new

carriage.

JANE

Then we must accept it. He'll

soon bring home his bride.

ROCHESTER

Come and look at this fellow, Jane.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Look at his wings. He looks West

Indian - I have never seen one

like him, here. There; flown.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Thornfield is a pleasant place in

summer, isn't it?

JANE

I'll be sad to leave it.

ROCHESTER

Yes, but it can't be helped. I

soon hope to be a bridegroom.

JANE

Have you found me a new situation,

sir?

ROCHESTER

A situation, yes of course. It's

the least I can do for a faithful

paid subordinate such as yourself.

You're to undertake the education

of the five daughters of Mrs

Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge,

Connaught.

JANE

Connaught?

ROCHESTER

You'll like Ireland. They're such

warm-hearted people, they say.

JANE

It is a long way away, sir.

ROCHESTER

From what?

JANE

From here. From you.

ROCHESTER

We've been good friends, Jane

haven't we? But with the Irish sea

between us you'd soon forget me.

JANE

I wish I could. I wish I'd never

come here. I love Thornfield -

I've lived a full life here. I've

not been trampled on or petrified

or buried with inferior minds.

I've talked face to face with what

I reverence, with what I delight

in. I've known you Mr Rochester -

ROCHESTER

Then why must you be torn from me?

JANE

Because of your bride.

ROCHESTER

I have no bride.

JANE

But you will have.

ROCHESTER

Yes, I will.

JANE

Then I must go.

ROCHESTER

You must stay.

JANE

Do you think I could stay to become

nothing to you? Am I an automaton,

a machine without feelings?

(MORE)

JANE (CONT'D)

Do you think that because I am

poor, obscure, plain and little

that I am soulless and heartless?

ROCHESTER

JANE -

JANE

I have as much soul as you and full

as much heart. I'm not speaking to

you through mortal flesh. It's my

spirit that addresses your spirit

as if we'd passed through the grave

and stood at God's feet, equal - as

we are.

ROCHESTER

As we are.

JANE

Let me go.

ROCHESTER

NO -

JANE

I'm a free human being with an

independent will, which I now

exert to leave you.

ROCHESTER

Then let your will decide your

destiny. I offer you my hand, my

heart and a share of all this.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I ask you to pass through life at

my side. Jane, you are my equal

and my likeness. It is you I

intend to marry.

JANE

Are you mocking me?

ROCHESTER

Do you doubt me?

JANE

Entirely.

ROCHESTER

You have no faith in me?

JANE

Not a whit.

ROCHESTER

You little sceptic.

JANE

Your bride is Miss Ingram -

ROCHESTER

What love have I for Miss Ingram?

What love has she for me? I

caused a rumour to reach her that

my fortune was lost and got

instant coldness. I wanted to

make you jealous, to move you to

love me. It's you - you strange,

unearthly thing. I love you as my

own flesh. You - poor and obscure

as you are - please accept me as

your husband.

JANE

Are you in earnest?

ROCHESTER

I must have you for my own.

JANE

You wish me to be your wife?

ROCHESTER

I swear it.

JANE

You love me.

ROCHESTER

I do.

JANE

Then sir, I will marry you.

ROCHESTER

It will atone. It will atone.

JANE

I must go.

ROCHESTER

Good night. Good night.

JANE

Good night.

MRS FAIRFAX

Have you accepted him?

JANE

Yes.

MRS FAIRFAX

Well I never would have thought.

JANE

Am I a monster? Is it so

impossible that Mr Rochester

should love me?

MRS FAIRFAX

No, I've long noticed that you were

a sort of pet of his. But you're so

young and so little acquainted with

men. I don't want to grieve you

child, but let me put you on your

guard. Gentlemen in his position...

Let's just say they're not

accustomed to marry their

governesses. Until you are wed,

distrust yourself as well as him.

Please, keep him at a distance -

JANE

Thank you.

ROCHESTER

Is this my pale elf? This sunny

faced girl with the radiant eyes?

JANE

It is I, Jane Eyre sir.

ROCHESTER

Soon to be Jane Rochester.

JANE

It can never be, sir. Human

beings were not meant to enjoy

complete happiness on this earth.

It's too much like a fairy tale.

ROCHESTER

(KISSING HER)

Let the fairy tale begin.

ROCHESTER

This morning I wrote to my banker

in London to send certain jewels.

In a day or two I hope to pour

them into you lap -

JANE

Oh, no sir -

ROCHESTER

I will put the diamond chain

around your neck myself -

JANE

I don't want jewels -

ROCHESTER

I'll dress you in these satins -

JANE

Then you won't know me. I'll not

be Jane Eyre any longer but an

ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put

them away.

ROCHESTER

Well for cool native impudence

and pure innate pride, you

haven't your equal.

JANE

I'm naturally proud. And hard and

flinty. You ought to know what

sort of bargain you've made while

you've still got time to rescind

it. I want only one thing from

you, Mr Rochester.

ROCHESTER

And what's that?

JANE

Your regard.

ROCHESTER

It's your time now, little tyrant

but it'll soon be mine and when I

have seized you, to have and to

hold, I'll attach you to a chain,

like this...

JANE

Adele?

JANE (CONT'D)

Adele, is that you?

ROCHESTER

What is it?

JANE

I'm afraid.

ROCHESTER

Jane, this is the only explanation.

It must have been half-dream, half-

reality. A woman did enter your

room last night and that woman was -

must have been - Grace Poole -

JANE

It was not Grace Poole.

ROCHESTER

You know how strange she is. What

did she do to me? To Mason? In a

state between sleeping and waking -

JANE

I was not asleep.

ROCHESTER

You noticed her entrance and her

actions but you've ascribed to

her an appearance different from

her own. That was your nightmare -

JANE

I know what I saw.

ROCHESTER

I see you'd ask why I keep such a

woman in my house. When we've been

married a year and a day, I promise

I'll tell you. Are you satisfied

Jane? Do you accept my solution?

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Dear God. It was only the veil...

ADELE

Mademoiselle...

SOPHIE

Please, you must look.

ROCHESTER

Come.

WOOD

I require and charge you both, as

ye will answer at the dreadful

day of judgement when the secrets

of all hearts shall be revealed,

that if either of you know any

impediment why ye may not be

lawfully joined together in

matrimony, ye do now confess it.

WOOD (CONT'D)

Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you

TAKE -

BRIGGS

The marriage cannot go on. I

declare the existence of an

impediment.

ROCHESTER

Proceed.

BRIGGS

The ceremony is quite broken off.

An insuperable impediment to this

marriage exists.

ROCHESTER

Proceed.

BRIGGS

Mr Rochester has a wife now

living.

ROCHESTER

(SHOUTS)

Where is your proof?

BRIGGS (O.S.)

I affirm and can prove that Edward

Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years

ago married to my sister, Bertha

Antoinetta Mason at St James

church, Spanish Town, Jamaica.

BRIGGS (CONT'D)

The record of the marriage will be

found in the register of that

church - a copy of it is now in my

possession. Signed, Richard Mason.

ROCHESTER

That does not prove that my wife

is still living.

BRIGGS

She was living two months ago.

ROCHESTER

How do you know?

BRIGGS

I have a witness to the fact.

ROCHESTER

Produce him or go to hell.

MASON

Good God -

WOOD

Sir, you are in a sacred place -

ROCHESTER

What have you to say?

MASON

She is at Thornfield Hall. I saw

her there in April. I'm her

brother.

ROCHESTER

This girl knew nothing. She

thought all was fair and legal.

She never dreamt she was going to

be entrapped into a feigned union

with a defrauded wretch.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Come, Jane, come all of you and

meet Mrs Poole's charming

patient. Come and meet my wife.

ROCHESTER

Get back! Do not come near! Go,

all of you - keep your

congratulations - they come

fifteen years too late!

GRACE

Sir, you can't be bringing folk

in here. It's madness.

ROCHESTER

This clothed hyena is my wife.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I was duped into marriage with

this lunatic fifteen years ago.

WOOD

Let us go. We have seen enough.

ROCHESTER

My own demon, Bertha.

BRIGGS

You, madam, are clearly not to

blame. Your uncle will be glad to

hear it.

BRIGGS (CONT'D)

You wrote to your uncle, did you

not? To inform him you were going

to marry Mr Rochester? Mr Mason

was staying with him when your

letter came.

BRIGGS (CONT'D)

Mr John Eyre has been the Madeira

correspondent of the Mason trading

house for some years. You can

imagine his distress when Mason

revealed the real state of matters.

BRIGGS (CONT'D)

He would have come himself but

I'm sad to tell you that his

health is in mortal decline. He

implored Mr Mason to prevent this

false marriage and referred him

to me for assistance. I only hope

that he survives long enough to

hear that you are safe.

JANE

Thank you.

ROCHESTER

JANE -

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Five minutes more of that death-

like hush and I'd have forced the

lock.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

No tears. Your heart has been

weeping blood. Forgive me.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

How could I? I am a worthless

sinner. Don't spare me. Rain your

tears up on me.

JANE

I cannot.

ROCHESTER

I deserve a hail of fire.

JANE

I'm tired and sick. I need some

water.

ROCHESTER

How are you now?

JANE

Much better, sir. I shall be well

again soon.

ROCHESTER

I know you. You are thinking.

Talking is no use; you are

thinking how to act.

JANE

All is changed, sir. I must

change too.

ROCHESTER

Yes. There is no doubt that we

both must change. I was wrong

ever to keep you here; this

narrow stone vault with its one

real fiend. I'll shut it up. I'll

pay Mrs Poole two hundred a year

to care for its inmate and then

no one will be harmed when she is

prompted to burn people, to stab

them, to bite the flesh from

their bones -

JANE

Sir - you speak of her with hate -

it is cruel. She cannot help

being mad.

ROCHESTER

It's not because she's mad that I

hate her. If you were mad do you

think that I'd hate you?

JANE

I do.

ROCHESTER

Then you know nothing about me,

nothing about the way I love. Your

mind is my treasure - and if it

were broken it would be my treasure

still. You are my sympathy, my

better self, my angel. I will wrap

my whole existence round you. Let

us leave here tomorrow. Come with

me - as my wife.

JANE

No.

ROCHESTER

I'll pledge you my fidelity -

JANE

You can't.

ROCHESTER

You'll live a happy, most

innocent life -

JANE

I must leave you, sir.

ROCHESTER

Don't you love me?

JANE

I do love you - But I mustn't

show it or speak it ever again. I

must begin a new existence -

strange scenes among strange

faces. I must part from you.

ROCHESTER

Must be a part of me; that's what

you mean. You are my wife, Jane.

In truth -

JANE

You have a wife already.

ROCHESTER

I was tricked, duped into wedlock

with that demon-hate, that harlot,

that succubus upstairs. My father

wanted her money and so I was sent

to Spanish Town and the match was

made. I hardly spoke with her. I

was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My

senses were besotted and I married

her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed

blockhead that I was.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I lived with her for four years.

She dragged me through all the

degrading agonies which attend

those bound to the intemperate and

unchaste. Her excesses developed

germs of madness and the doctors

shut her up. One night, unable to

bear her screaming hate and knowing

I could never be rid of her, I put

a gun to my head to kill myself.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I would have pulled the trigger,

died in that tropical place but for

a breeze which blew in from the sea

and smelt of home. With it, I came

to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta

Mason had abused my long suffering,

sullied my name, outraged my honour

and blighted my youth. It was

enough. At that moment, as I

decided to live, she ceased to be

my wife.

(MORE)

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Only my father and brother knew of

the marriage and by then they were

both dead. I let my connection with

her be buried in oblivion and I

brought her here. I have seen that

she's cared for as her condition

demands and that is all that God

and humanity asks.

JANE

I earnestly pity you, sir.

ROCHESTER

Jane, it's not pity that I see in

your face. It's not pity -

JANE

Do not say it -

ROCHESTER

It is love.

JANE

STOP -

ROCHESTER

I was wrong to deceive you. It was

cowardly. I should have appealed to

your spirit - as I do now - should

have opened my life, described my

hunger for a better existence -

shown you my chains. I give you my

life. I give you my pledge. Please,

be my wife.

JANE

I can not.

ROCHESTER

You would be my equal.

JANE

How?

ROCHESTER

I would make it so.

JANE

You once told me that hiring a

mistress is the next worse thing

to buying a slave.

ROCHESTER

Not my mistress -

JANE

I would not degrade you by having

you live with a slave.

ROCHESTER

I said wife, my wife -

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Do you really mean to leave me?

JANE

I do.

ROCHESTER

Jane...

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Do you mean it now?

JANE

I do.

ROCHESTER

And now?

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Oh Jane...

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

What friends would you offend by

living with me? Who would be

injured? Who would care?

JANE

I would.

ROCHESTER

Jane, it would not be wicked to

love me...

JANE

It would be to obey you. I care

for myself.

JANE (CONT'D)

The more alone, the more friendless,

unsustained I am, the more I must

respect myself -

ROCHESTER

Will you listen to me?

JANE

I must listen to myself -

ROCHESTER

Will you hear reason?

JANE

Let me go -

ROCHESTER

Because if you won't I'll try

violence.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

I could bend you with my finger

and thumb; a mere reed you feel

in my hands.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

But your eye; resolute, free. What

ever I do with this cage I cannot

get at you. And it is you, soul,

that I want. Why don't you come of

your own free will here, to my

heart? Oh come, Jane, come -

JANE

(CRYING OUT)

God help me!

ROCHESTER

You have never called me by my

name. My name is Edward.

JANE

Edward.

CUT TO:

ROCHESTER

Jane.

CUT TO:

JANE

Mr St John - What on earth brings

you away from your hearth on a

night like this? Has anything

happened? There's no bad news I

hope?

ST JOHN

How easily alarmed you are.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

The snow was up to my waist at

one point.

JANE

You are recklessly rash about

your own health.

ST JOHN

Nonsense.

JANE

Why are you come?

ST JOHN

An inhospitable question.

JANE

I mean on a night like this -

ST JOHN

I got tired of my mute books and

empty rooms. Besides I've been told

half a story and I'm most impatient

to find out the end.

JANE

Please...

ST JOHN

Twenty years ago, a poor curate

fell in love with a rich man's

daughter and married her. She was

disowned by her family and two

years later the rash pair were both

dead. They left a daughter which

charity received into her lap - as

cold as that snow drift I almost

stuck fast in. Charity carried the

friendless thing to the house of

its rich maternal relations. It was

reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to

names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Mrs Reed kept the orphan ten years

and at the end of that time she was

sent to Lowood school.

(MORE)

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

It seems her career there was very

honourable. She became a teacher

like yourself, and left it, like

yourself, to be a governess. She

undertook the education of the ward

of a certain Mr Rochester -

JANE

Mr Rivers! -

ST JOHN

I can guess your feelings but hear

me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's

character I know nothing but he

professed to offer honourable

marriage to this young girl and at

the very altar she discovered that

he had a wife yet alive. His

subsequent conduct is a matter of

pure conjecture but when the

governess was enquired after it was

discovered that she had fled

Thornfield Hall and no trace of her

has since been found. Now isn't

that an odd tale?

JANE

Since you know so much, perhaps

you can tell me how he is.

ST JOHN

Who?

JANE

Mr Rochester; how is he?

ST JOHN

I'm ignorant of all concerning him.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Well, since you won't ask the

governess's name, I must tell

you. I have it written down here

in black and white.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

A solicitor named Briggs wrote to

me of a Jane Eyre. I knew a Jane

Elliott. This paper resolved my

suspicion into certainty.

JANE

The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does

he have any news of Mr Rochester?

ST JOHN

Are you not going to enquire why

he has gone to such lengths to

find you?

JANE

What does he want with me?

ST JOHN

Merely to tell you that your uncle,

Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead;

that he has left you all his

property and that you are now rich.

JANE

What?

ST JOHN

You are rich; quite an heiress.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Your fortune is vested in the

English funds; Briggs has the

will and all the necessary

documents. You can enter on

immediate possession.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Your forehead unbends at last; I

thought you were turning to

stone. Perhaps now you will ask

how much you are worth.

JANE

How much am I worth?

ST JOHN

Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand

pounds - but what of that?

JANE

Twenty thousand pounds?

ST JOHN

If you'd committed a murder and

I'd found you out, you could

scarcely look more aghast.

JANE

There must be some mistake. It's

two thousand, surely.

ST JOHN

It's twenty. You look desperately

miserable about it, I must say.

JANE

Why did Mr Briggs write to you?

ST JOHN

You see, that is the strange thing.

It makes me wonder what power or

providence led you to our door.

Your name is Jane Eyre.

JANE

Yes.

ST JOHN

Then I'm you namesake. I was

christened St John Eyre Rivers.

JANE

St John Eyre -

ST JOHN

My mother had two brothers, one was

a clergyman, your father, the other

was John Eyre of Madeira. Mr Briggs

wrote to inform us that the

clergyman's daughter was lost. I

have been able to find her out;

that is all.

JANE

Your mother was my father's

sister?

ST JOHN

Yes.

JANE

My uncle John was your uncle

John?

ST JOHN

That is correct.

JANE

So you, Diana and Mary -

ST JOHN

We are cousins, yes.

JANE

Oh, I am glad! - I am glad!

ST JOHN

Here you are neglecting essential

points to pursue trifles. You were

utterly downhearted when I told you

that you were rich and now, for a

matter of no moment, you are

deliriously happy.

JANE

Of no moment? You have sisters and

maybe don't care for a cousin but I

have nobody. I have been alone,

always. And now three relations are

born into my world full grown. Oh, I

am glad. You, who saved my life -

ST JOHN

You must try to tranquillise your

feelings.

JANE

Write to Diana and Mary. Tell

them to hand in notice and come

home. They will have five

thousand each and so will you.

ST JOHN

I've told you the news too quickly.

You're confused.

JANE

Don't put me out of patience,

cousin. I am rational enough.

Twenty thousand divided equally

between the nieces and nephews of

our uncle, gives five to each.

ST JOHN

This is acting on first impulse.

You don't know what it is to have

WEALTH -

JANE

And you cannot imagine - family -

I never had a home. I never had

brothers and sisters -

JANE (CONT'D)

You are not reluctant to own me,

are you?

ST JOHN

Jane, I will be your brother.

ST JOHN

Good night.

DIANA

You call Jane your sister but you

don't treat her as such. You should

kiss her too.

JANE

Di, you are very provoking.

ST JOHN

Good night.

ST JOHN

You are wasted here.

JANE

Am I not being useful?

ST JOHN

You should look beyond Moor

House, beyond the selfish calm

and comfort of affluence.

JANE

Beyond to what?

ST JOHN

I go to India in six weeks.

JANE

So soon? -

ST JOHN

I can see what your gifts are and

why they were given. Come with me.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

God and nature intended you for a

missionary's wife. You are formed

for labour not for love. I want

to claim you - not for my

pleasure but for God's service.

JANE

I'm not fit for it. I have no

vocation.

ST JOHN

You're far too humble.

JANE

St John have mercy. I feel my

mind shrinking -

ST JOHN

Don't be afraid. You are diligent,

faithful, docile, courageous,

gentle and heroic. Cease to

mistrust yourself. I trust you

unreservedly. Let me give you time

to think. But know this; in you, I

recognise a fellow soul, a soul

that would revel in the flame and

excitement of sacrifice.

CUT TO:

JANE

I used to long for a life of

action, to overleap the horizon, to

move in the world of men. Maybe God

is giving me this. And what is

there for me here? Pain and longing

for what can't be. I don't know how

long I would survive in India. My

frame isn't strong. But I'll go

with you, if I may go free.

ST JOHN

Free?

JANE

You and I had better not marry.

ST JOHN

Why not?

JANE

Because I am your sister.

ST JOHN

But you'll go with me.

JANE

Conditionally - as your curate.

ST JOHN

Jane, I don't need a curate; I

need a wife.

JANE

I must have my heart and mind

free, my own self to turn to. I

couldn't become part of you -

ST JOHN

A part of me you must become or the

whole bargain is void. How can I, a

man not yet thirty take out to

India a girl of nineteen, unless

she is my wife? Don't offer God

half a sacrifice. He must have all.

And undoubtedly enough of love

would follow to make the union

right, even in your eyes.

JANE

Enough of love?

ST JOHN

Yes, quite enough.

JANE

St John, I scorn your idea of

love. I scorn the counterfeit

sentiment you offer and I scorn

you when you offer it!

ST JOHN

I've uttered nothing that

deserves scorn.

JANE

Forgive me but the very name of

love is an apple of discord

between us. My dear cousin,

please abandon your scheme of

marriage.

ST JOHN

No; and if you reject it, it's

not me you deny but God.

JANE

Do not be angry with me please.

It makes me wretched. I want us

to be friends.

ST JOHN

We are friends. I hope we can be

more.

JANE

I cannot come as your wife.

ST JOHN

Why this refusal? It makes no

sense!

JANE

If I were to marry you, you'd

kill me. You're killing me now.

ST JOHN

(FURIOUS)

I'd kill you? I am killing you?

Your words are violent, unfeminine

and untrue -

JANE

You'd kill me without drawing any

blood or receiving on your

conscience any stain of crime.

ST JOHN

What nonsense is this?

JANE

You'd experience no pain - but I

tell you it would kill me!

ST JOHN

Why?

JANE

Because I would inevitably come to

conceive love for you, because you

are so talented and good, because

there is such grandeur in your

look. You wouldn't want this

strange and torturing love; if I

showed it you would find it

unbecoming. And my lot would be

wretched.

ST JOHN

(UNDERSTANDING HER)

Jane...

JANE

You're a good man, but you forget

the feelings of little people. We'd

better keep out of your way lest

you trample us.

ST JOHN

I wouldn't trample you. You'd

walk at my side towards God's

altar. He'd be your solace,

heaven your reward. We seek to do

the greatest work, to open

death's gates, to save souls.

Love God Jane, love God.

ST JOHN (CONT'D)

Give up your heart to Him. He is

love.

JANE

If I were sure; if I were certain -

ROCHESTER (O.S.)

Jane! Jane! Jane!

JANE

Oh God, what is it?

ST JOHN

What have you heard? What can you

see?

JANE

I am coming!

JANE

Wait for me!

JANE (CONT'D)

Where are you?

CUT TO:

JANE

They sent me from the inn. I've

been up at the house -

MRS FAIRFAX

Come in, come in.

JANE

Is he dead?

MRS FAIRFAX

No, no. Mr Rochester still lives.

JANE

Tell me - please -

MRS FAIRFAX

Why did you run away in the night

like that? I would have helped. I

would have helped.

MRS FAIRFAX

He sought you as if you were a lost

and precious jewel. He didn't rest.

And as days turned into weeks and

no word came, he grew quite savage

in his disappointment.

JANE

He stayed at Thornfield?

MRS FAIRFAX

Didn't leave the house...

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

Shut himself up like a hermit. He

only went out at night, when he

walked like a ghost through the

grounds.

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He'd have no one near him. Adele

was sent off to school. He placed

me here. Only John and Martha

stayed - and Mrs Poole of course.

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

It was harvest time when it

happened. No one knows how she

got out.

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

My theory is that when Mrs Poole

was asleep, having taken too much

of the gin and water...

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

... The mad lady must have stolen

her keys and let herself out.

GRACE

Antoinetta?

MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)

He didn't leave the house until

everyone was out. Some say it was a

just judgement on him for having

her confined there all those years

but for my part, I pity him.

MRS FAIRFAX

He's alive child, but many think

he'd be better off dead.

JANE

Why?

MRS FAIRFAX

When he was taken out from under

the ruins, a beam had fallen in

such a way as to protect him,

partly - but his eye was taken

out and his left hand so crushed

that he lost it. The other eye

inflamed and - he is blind. He's

blind.

MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)

I know... it's a terrible thing.

JANE

I had dreaded worse. I'd dreaded

he was mad.

JANE (CONT'D)

Where is he?

ROCHESTER

I can see the candles, Martha, at

your side like a luminous glow.

And the fire; a red haze.

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Martha?

ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

Martha, is that you?

JANE

Martha is in the kitchen, sir.

ROCHESTER

Who's there?

JANE

Pilot knows me. Will you have

some more water? I've spilt half

the glass.

ROCHESTER

If you are real, touch me.

ROCHESTER,

Her hand, her shape, her size.

JANE

And her voice.

ROCHESTER

Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre.

JANE

My Edward, I am Jane Eyre: I have

found you out. I am come back to

you.

ROCHESTER

You're not lying dead in some

ditch? Not an outcast among

strangers?

JANE

I've been with good people; far

better than you, quite more

refined and exalted.

ROCHESTER

(DELIGHTED)

She insults me -

JANE

And I'm an independent woman. My

uncle in Madeira died and left me

five thousand pounds -

ROCHESTER

This is real. This is practical.

JANE

I'm here. I'm home. I am where I

love best.

CUT TO:

ROCHESTER

You're altogether a human being,

Jane?

JANE

I conscientiously believe so,

sir.

JANE (CONT'D)

But I see that you're turning

into a lion. It's time someone

undertook to rehumanise you.

ROCHESTER

I'm a sightless block -

JANE

I know.

JANE (CONT'D)

And the worst of it is, I'm in

danger of loving you too well for

this, and making too much of you.

ROCHESTER

Am I hideous, Jane?

JANE

Very. But you always were, you

know.

THE END.
