SAM

Mommy got sick and it happened

just like that and there was

nothing anybody would do.

(continued)

SAM

If we start asking why we'll go

crazy.  So, rule number one.

We don't ask why.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Why? I just want to know why?

That's my first rule.  I always

ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --

SETH

There's no why, Annie.  I'm

just not up for it.  I never

said I was.

ANNIE

Is there somebody else?

SETH

Nope.

ANNIE

You don't love me, is that it?

SETH

Nope.

ANNIE

How about ... you're too

narcissistic to commit to

another human being in a long-

term way.

SETH

(agreeably)

That's good.

CUT TO:

SUZY

Five minutes in the microwave.

Any one of them, five minutes

and done.  Ready to eat.  Do

you know how to make juice?

SAM

Microwave.  Five minutes.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

You take the microwave?

SETH

What am I going to do with a

microwave?

ANNIE

You turn it on, you open it and

you stand in front of it for a

very long time.

SETH

So you're angry.  Big deal.

CUT TO:

ROB

Young man, it's none of my

business, but maybe you should

talk to someone.  I myself

have consulted a professional.

I used to be up tight.

SAM

Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

Loss of Spouse support groups...

Single parent discussion nights...

Parents without partners.

(starts riffling, angry)

Partners without parents.

People who need people.  Guys

who go into the woods, beat

drums and bond.  Get a shrink.

Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.

SAM

(continued)

Don't mind him.  He's the guy

who just lost his wife.

(beat)

What I really think is we need

a change.

ROB

Good idea.  Take a few weeks

off, get some sun, take Jonah

fishing --

SAM

(shaking his head no)

A real change.  New city.

Someplace where every time I go

around a corner I don't think

of Maggie.

DISSOLVE:

ROB (V.O.)

Where you going to go?

SAM

I was thinking about Seattle.

LAURIE

Honey, he wasn't right for you.

ANNIE

(blowing her nose)

I know.

LAURIE

He wasn't even wrong for you,

like cosmically wrong, so don't

beat up on yourself for

wasting...however long it was.

ANNIE

I know.

(blowing her nose

again)

LAURIE

Maybe you should see a shrink.

ANNIE

I want my money.

LAURIE

Go home for the weekend.

ANNIE

(after a beat)

That's what I'm going to do.

I'm going to go home.

(she thinks about it)

I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm

going back to Baltimore.

(she's giddy)

How does a blonde do a high-

five?

CUT TO:

JONAH

(to Mack)

Dad says I'm going to get used

to it, but I don't think you

can ever get used to a

designated hitter.

SUZY

(to Sam)

Eventually, in a few months,

you'll start seeing women,

you'll meet someone.

SAM

Move on.  Right.  That's what

I'm going to do.  In a few

months, boom, I'll be fine,

I'll just grow a new heart.

SUZY

I'm sorry --

GREG

Sam, she didn't mean --

SAM

I know, I know.

(emphatic)

Look, it doesn't happen twice.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I'm going to meet someone,

someone nice and stable who

wears a hat so he won't catch a

cold, and I'm going to marry

him and have three children

and live happily ever after.

I mean, I am not cut out for this

--

DIANE

For what?

ANNIE

For life as we know it.

LAURIE

Just make sure he isn't fat

like my Michael or you'll spend

your whole life worrying he's

going to drop dead.

JUDITH

God, you guys are so romantic.

ANNIE

Do you know how long romance

lasts?

(she snaps her fingers)

That long.

DIANE

Steven still brings me flowers

every Friday and we've been

married 10 years.

LAURIE

(to Diane)

Honey, nobody wants to hear

that.

(to Annie)

Here, darling, have some Tic

Tacs.

ANNIE

The next time you see me I am

going to be incredibly happy.

SAM

I'm your dad.  Don't ever

forget that.  That's rule

number two.

(beat)

It's you and me, kid.

ANNIE

(to herself)

I guess it's just us.

WALTER

The short one with black hair

is your cousin Irene --

ANNIE

-- who's married to --

WALTER

Harold, who ran away with his

secretary but came back --

ANNIE

-- because Irene threatened to

put the dog to sleep if he

didn't --

WALTER

And your brother Tom is a

psychology professor and is

married to...Betsy --

ANNIE

-- who is the most competitive

woman in the world --

WALTER

Your Uncle Milton lost all his

money in a Puerto Rican

condominium that went belly up,

don't mention the IRS or the

Federal prison system.  Your

mother is Barbara, your father

is Cliff --

ANNIE

I hope he doesn't get out his

slides.

WALTER

Am I what they had in mind?

ANNIE

They're going to love you.

CUT TO:

BARBARA

Everybody! Annie has an announcement --

ANNIE

Walter and I are engaged!

IRENE

That's wonderful, Annie.  I

hope it lasts... for years

and years.

BETSY

(the competitive one)

Do you have a ring?

ANNIE

No.  Not yet.

BETSY

Oh.  Well.  How will anyone

know?

TOM

Because you're going to call

them all and tell them.

Congratulations, Walter.

CLIFF

Are you all right?

WALTER

It's nothing.  Nothing.

ANNIE

It's probably just the flowers --

BARBARA

We'll move them --

WALTER

Don't touch them.  I feel

terrible sneezing at a time

like this.  This is a big

moment for me --

ANNIE

(overlapping)

He's allergic to everything,

don't worry about it --

HAROLD

Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.

CLIFF

Not salmon I hope --

ANNIE

If he eats one tiny piece of a

nut --

WALTER

(cheerfully)

My head swells up like a

watermelon and I drop dead.

IRENE

It's the same with Harold and

bees.

CLIFF

Your mother and I had salmon at

our wedding, and I really think

a wedding without cold salmon --

WALTER

I'm not allergic to salmon.  I

don't think.  But you never

know.

HAROLD

You never know.

BARBARA

Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we

used up this magnum of

champagne we were saving on

something else, what did we use

it for?

TOM

Uncle Milton's parole --

BARBARA

Right.

UNCLE MILTON

And it was delicious.

BARBARA

It was, wasn't it, Milton

darling --

BETSY

When are you getting married,

Annie?

CLIFF

In early June.  In the garden.

HAROLD

Does it have to be in the garden?

IRENE

What about Harold and bees?

BARBARA

We'll spray you.

CLIFF

Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber

salad.  Strawberries.

WALTER

I'm afraid I'm allergic to

strawberries.

CLIFF

No strawberries.

ANNIE

(to Walter)

Is that all right with you?

WALTER

(to Lou Gehrig line)

Today I consider myself the

luckiest man on the face of

the earth.

IRENE

What are you wearing?

ANNIE

I don't know.

BETSY

I wish you would wear my dress.

I only wore it once, and you'll

barely have to do anything to

it except take it in in the

bust --

BARBARA

I have something that might do

--

BARBARA

The Historical Society wanted

this and I never would give it

to them --

ANNIE

Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.

BARBARA

I notice these things are back

in fashion.  Oh, honey.

(tears are rolling down

her face as she tries

the veil on Annie)

He's a lovely man, Annie.

ANNIE

I know.  He's wonderful, isn't

he?

BARBARA

Are his folks nice?

ANNIE

You'll love them.  We're going

down to D.C.  tonight to be with

them Christmas morning.

BARBARA

How did it happen?

ANNIE

It's silly, really.  I mean,

I'd seen him at the office,

obviously I'd seen him, he's

the associate publisher, and

then one day we both ordered

sandwiches from the same place,

and he got my lettuce and

tomato sandwich on whole wheat,

which of course he was allergic

to, and I got his lettuce and

tomato on white.

BARBARA

(utterly without irony)

How amazing.

ANNIE

It is, isn't it? You make

millions of decisions that mean

nothing and then one day you

decide to order takeout and it

changes your life.

BARBARA

Destiny takes a hand.

ANNIE

Oh, please.  Destiny's just

something we've invented

because we can't stand the fact

that everything that happens is

accidental.

BARBARA

Then how do you explain that

you both ordered exactly the

same sandwich except for the

bread? How many people in this

world like lettuce and tomato

without something else like

tuna?

ANNIE

It wasn't a sign.  It was a

coincidence.

BARBARA

I was in Atlantic City with my

family.  Cliff was a waiter.

He talked me into sneaking out

for a midnight walk on the

Steel Pier.  I've probably told

you this a million times, but

I don't care.  And then he held

my hand.  I was scared.  All

sorts of thing were going

through my head.  But after a

while I forgot about them.  At

one point I looked down, at our

hands, and I couldn't tell

which fingers were mine and

which were his.  And I knew.

ANNIE

(hearing it for the

first time)

What?

BARBARA

You know.

ANNIE

(she doesn't know, but

she doesn't want her

mother to know she

doesn't know)

What?

BARBARA

Magic.  It was magic.

ANNIE

(repeating)

Magic.

BARBARA

I knew we would be together

forever, and that everything

would be wonderful, just the

way you feel about Walter.

Walter.  It's quite a formal

name, isn't it?

(lowering her voice)

One of the things I truly knew

was that your father and I were

going to have a wonderful time

... in the sack I believe you

call it --

ANNIE

Mom!

BARBARA

Of course it took several years

before everything worked like

clockwork in that department,

so don't be worried if it takes

a while --

ANNIE

Mom, we already...

BARBARA

Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da

dee.  And how's it working?

ANNIE

Like... clockwork.

BARBARA

So you'll get married in a new

dress.

ANNIE

It's a sign.

BARBARA

(gently)

You don't believe in signs.

ANNIE

They loved you.  I told you

they would love you and they

did.

WALTER

I love you.

ANNIE

I love you, Walter.

(beat)

Did anyone ever call you

anything other than Walter?

WALTER

Nope.

ANNIE

Even when you were young?

WALTER

Nope.  Not even when I was

young.

WALTER

You sure you don't want to

drive with me?

ANNIE

How will I get back to

Baltimore Saturday?

(remembering something)

Oh God, I forgot my present for

your stepmother -- I took it

inside by accident.

WALTER

I'll wait.

ANNIE

Don't be silly.  I'll just be

ten minutes behind you.

DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE

Welcome back to "You and Your

Emotions." I'm Dr.  Marcia

Fieldstone broadcasting across

America from the top of the

Sears Tower in Chicago where we

would have a fantastic view of

Santa Claus and his reindeer if

there was a -- oops, never

mind.  Tonight we're talking

about wishes and dreams.

What's your wishes this Christmas

Eve? Maybe the best present

you can give yourself is a call

to me.  The number is --

ANNIE

Give me a break.

RADIO VOICE

The subject of the evening's

medical update is You and Your

Spleen and our host --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Our caller is from Seattle.

RADIO VOICE

Coming up, Jingle Bells

backwards, sung by the New

Jersey Cape Mayettes --

BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)

Hello, this is Jonah --

(there's a bleep as

Jonah says his last

name)

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

No last names, Jonah.  Hello

there, you sound younger than

our usual callers.  How come

you're up so late?

JONAH (V.O.)

It's not that late in Seattle.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Got me there.  What's your

Christmas wish, Jonah?

JONAH (V.O.)

It's not for me.  It's for my

dad.  I think he needs a new

wife.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

You don't like the one he was

now?

JONAH (V.O.)

He doesn't have one now.

That's the problem.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Where's your mom?

JONAH (V.O.)

She died.

ANNIE

I don't believe this --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.

JONAH (V.O.)

I've been pretty sad, but I

think my dad is worse.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

And you're worried about him.

JONAH (V.O.)

I'm worried about him, he's

worried about me, I ride my

bike to school, he follows in

the car, like I'm not supposed

to know he's there.  Now it's

Christmas, and you know what

happens to people at Christmas.

ANNIE

They lose their minds and call

crackpot doctors on the radio --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Have you talked to your dad

about this?

JONAH (V.O.)

No.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why not?

JONAH (V.O.)

It's very hard for him to talk

about this stuff.  It's like it

makes him sadder.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

You want me to talk to him?

ANNIE

Perfect.  Sandbag the father.

JONAH (V.O.)

And you crazy? He thinks shows

like this are dumb.  If you

didn't have an 800 number I

could never get away with this

--

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Is he home right now?

JONAH (V.O.)

Yeah.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Well, I think I can help a

little more if I talk to him

directly.

JONAH (V.O.)

I don't know --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

I'm sure he won't be angry once

he realizes how concerned you

are about him.

JONAH (V.O.)

Okay, but if I get yelled at,

I'm never gonna listen to this

show again.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Fair enough.

JONAH

Dad --

SAM

What is it?

JONAH (V.O.)

There's somebody on the phone

for you.

(into phone)

His name is Sam.

ANNIE

This is completely disgusting.

SAM

Hello.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia

Fieldstone on Network America.

SAM

I'm probably not interested in

whatever you're selling.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

I'm not selling anything.  Your

son called and asked for advice

on how to find you a new wife.

SAM

(he really didn't get

her name)

Who is this?

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

(repeating herself)

Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of

Network America.

SAM

Jesus, are we on the air?

Jonah, for God's sake --

JONAH

Don't be mad at me, Dad.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

He feels that since your wife's

death you've been very unhappy.

He's genuinely worried about you.

SAM

(to Jonah)

I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm

not mad at you.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

I think it's hard for him to

talk to you about all this.

Maybe we could talk and it

would make him feel a little

better.

JONAH

Please --

ANNIE

This is a grotesque violation

of this man's personal life,

but never mind --

SAM (V.O.)

All righ...

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Good.  How long ago did your

wife die?

SAM

It's been about a year and a

half.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Have you had any relationship

since?

SAM

No.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why not?

SAM

Look, Doctor, I don't want to

be rude, but --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

And I don't want to invade your

privacy --

ANNIE

Sure you do.

SAM (V.O.)

(overlapping)

Sure you do --

SAM

Look, we had a tough time at

first, but I think I'm holding

my own as a dad, and Jonah and

I will get along fine again as

soon as I break his radio.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

I have no doubt that you're a

good dad.  You can tell a lot

from a person's voice.  But

something must be missing if

Jonah feels that you're still

under a cloud.

JONAH

Tell her how you don't sleep at

night.

SAM

How do you know that?

JONAH

I can hear you walking around

sometimes.  At first I thought

it was a robber.  Go ahead,

tell her, Dad.

SAM

I don't think I have to now.

SAM

Look, it's almost Christmas --

(as the two of them sit

down together on the

bench)

A kid needs a mother --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Could it be that you need

someone just as much as Jonah

does?

ANNIE

Yes.

ANNIE

I'm losing my mind.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

We've been talking to -- well,

let's just call him Sleepless

in Seattle, and we'll be right

back after this break with

listener response, your

response, to the things we've

been discussing.  The number to

call is...

SAM

What's she talking about?

JONAH

This is where other people get

to call in and dump on what you

said.

LORETTA

I'll bet he's tall, with a cute

butt.

HARRIET

I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a

week.  I'll bet he stinks.

LORETTA

Shut up, Harriet.

(to Annie)

What'll it be?

ANNIE

Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.

LORETTA

Maybe I should hustle myself

out to Seattle.  Give him a

little present for New Year's

Eve.

HARRIET

You can go there if you want

but don't open his refrigerator.

They don't cover anything when

they put it in the fridge.

They just stick it in and leave

it there till it walks out by

itself.

LORETTA

Harriet, ever since you

divorced your last husband,

you've been no fun.  I'm

looking, and this guy pops my

tarts.

TRUCK DRIVER

Come on, Loretta, you're going

to have to jump-start this guy.

His battery's dead.  And look

at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.

Every six minutes, another

charge.

LORETTA

I'm looking for someone

sensitive.

ANNIE

Come on, nobody wants a guy

who's sensitive on the radio.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Let's take a call before we get

back to Sleepless.  Knoxville,

Tennessee, you're on.

SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE

Yes, I would just like to know

where I could get this man's

address?

LORETTA

(to the radio)

Honey, get on line.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Do you think there's somebody

out there you could love as

much as your wife? Maybe even

more?

SAM (V.O.)

It's hard to imagine.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

What are you going to do, Sam?

SAM

I don't know.  When I met my

wife, it was so clear.  I just

knew.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

What was it that made you know?

SAM

I don't think I could really

describe it.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why not?

SAM

And if I could describe it,

it probably wouldn't be on a radio

show.

(he laughs to himself)

But what the hell.  It's not

one specific thing.  It's more

of a feeling.

(continued)

SAM

You touch her for the first

time, and suddenly... you're

home.  It's almost like...

ANNIE

Magic.

SAM

Magic.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Well, it's time to wrap up,

folks --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

We hope you'll call again soon.

WALTER

(muffled, outside car)

Annie?

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

... and let us know how it's

going.

WALTER

Annie?

ANNIE

I'm sorry, Walter.  I just

heard the most amazing thing on

the radio.

ANNIE

People call up these shows and

you can't believe the stuff

they say.  It's the end of

privacy as we know it, this

country is just one big global

village with everyone out there

going blah blah blah --

CUT TO:

SAM

The hopes are perfect --

beautiful, identical, smooth --

and they are for something

really amazing I feel it in my

bones --

JONAH

It's a spice rack.

SAM

We desperately need a spice

rack.  Desperately.

CUT TO:

SAM

And we desperately need spices.

JONAH

Dad?  About last night?

SAM

It's never happening again.

Right?

JONAH

Right.

SAM

Then it never happened.

SAM

Hi.

LULU

Hi.  Sam?

SAM

Yes?

LULU

(looking in and seeing

Jonah)

You must be Jonah.

LULU

(to her friend)

See.  I told you.  Sam and

Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is

JoBeth.

LULU

(continues)

We live two piers over, don't

we? Number 12, right? We're

having like a really neat open

house today from like four to

whenever if you care to stop

by.

SAM

Thanks, but... we've got plans.

LULU

Well, here's the number.  If

you ever find yourself

Sleepless, give us a call.  We

also... do babysitting.

JONAH

Not.

SAM

My feelings exactly.

SAM

How many people do you think

heard that thing last night?

JONAH

It plays in 50 states.

SAM

What?!

JONAH

Nobody else is going to know it

was us.

SAM

You're right.

(after a beat)

You better hope so.

KEITH

This man sells the greatest

soup you've ever eaten, there's

a line around the block, and he

is, I am not kidding, the meanest

man in America.

(beat)

I feel strongly about this,

Becky.  This is not just about

soup.

BECKY

Do it.  What else?

WYATT

New Year's Eve.  Please don't

make me write it.

BECKY

Wyatt, I do not mean to remind

you of your mother, but if you

don't put that game away, no TV

for a week.

WYATT

(pushing it to the

center of the table)

Would someone look this up,

don't tell me where.

BECKY

Listen to this.  Phone service

in the greater Chicago area was

tied up for two hours Christmas

Eve because some kid called a

phone-in show to get a wife for

his father.  Two thousand women

called in for the number.

KEITH

Jesus.

ANNIE

I heard it.  This kid calls up

and says my dad needs a wife

and I'm talking to myself in

the car saying, this is

completely disgusting, you're

taking advantage of a child,

and then the father gets on and

this shrinkette says, do you

want to talk about it? And he

says no as a matter of fact I

don't, and I am saying, bravo!

Right on! Don't talk to her,

it's none of her business --

(she's completely into

this story now)

-- and then suddenly, for no

reason at all, he's talking

about how much he loved his

wife, and how he just --

(she snaps her fingers)

fell in love with her and I am

crying.  Me.  A tear is

actually rolling down my face.

It was like what happens when I

watch those phone company ads.

I don't have to see the whole

ad, I just have to see the part

where the daughter gives her

mother a refrigerator with a

big red bow on it, have you

seen that one?

BECKY

You should write something

about this.

ANNIE

About what?

BECKY

Whatever it is.

KEITH

(waving the AP story)

What it is is, there are a lot

of desperate women out there

looking for love.

WYATT

Especially over a certain age.

KEITH

It is easier to be killed by a

terrorist after the age of 40

than it is to get married --

ANNIE

That is not true.  That

statistic is not true.

BECKY

It's not true, but it feels

true.

ANNIE

There's practically a whole

book about how that statistic

is not true --

WYATT

Calm down.  You brought it up --

ANNIE

(sharply)

I did not, Wyatt.

BECKY

So where were we?

WYATT

New Year's Eve.  I'll do it,

okay?

BECKY

Okay.

ANNIE

If someone is a widower, why do

they say he was widowed? Why

don't they say he was widowered?

ANNIE

I was jus wondering.

BECKY

What was that about up there?

ANNIE

What was what?

BECKY

What's with you?

ANNIE

Nothing's with me.

BECKY

"Sleepless in Seattle"?

ANNIE

That's what she called him on

the show.  Because he can't

sleep.

BECKY

And now 2,000 women want his

number.  The guy could be a

crackhead, a psychopath, a

flasher, a junkie, a

transvestite, a chain-saw

murderer, or someone really

sick, like Rick.

ANNIE

Actually, he sounded nice.

BECKY

Oh? Oh, really? Now we're

getting down to it.

ANNIE

Not.

BOB LANGMAN

Now she wants a circular

stairwell off the den.

JAY

(to Jonah, in b.g.)

Punch me, punch in right here.

(points to his stomach;

Jonah punches)

And she wants the Sub-Zero with

the side-by-side doors --

BOB

Which means --

SAM

The cabinets have to be redone

--

BOB

So we thought --

JAY

Since you're on the make again

--

SAM

Great.  This is great.  The

whole town knows.  Just out of

curiosity, how do you two know?

BOB

Grace heard it.

SAM

Grace the dispatcher.  Great.

BOB

The point is, take the client

out to dinner and ask her to

marry you and then maybe we

won't have to redo the kitchen

cabinets.

SAM

Why me? What about Jay?

JAY

Hey, my plate is full.

SAM

Well, okay.  What's the big

deal?  If she'll forget the

new fireplace, I'll marry her.

Just point me in the right

direction.

JONAH

Dad, I don't know about this

one --

SAM

Oh, you're changing your mind

--

JONAH

No, I'm not, but --

SAM

What's the matter with this

one? Wouldn't you like to have

Imelda Marcos as your mother?

JONAH

Dad --

SAM

We better take the measurements

for the new cabinets.

BOB

Sam, if you're not doing

anything New Year's --

obviously you're not doing

anything New Year's -- we're

having some people over, all of

them married, not one even

remotely interested in playing

around.  Does that sound great

or what?

(whistfully)

I can't think of the last time

I was at a party when anything

actually happened.

SAM

Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's

kind of a big night.  I don't

like to leave Jonah alone.

CUT TO:

SAM

(as he starts putting

new spices into the

rack, in alphabetical

order)

Does red pepper go under R or

P?

JONAH

P.

(beat)

Dad?

SAM

(absently)

What?

JONAH

I forgot to mention.  Jed

called --

SAM

Just out of curiosity, do you

have any friends whose names

don't begin with a J?  I feel

like it was a failure of the

imagination on our part naming

you Jonah.

(looking at the spices)

What is marjoram? Does anyone

know?

JONAH

Jed is having a slumber party

New Year's Eve and he invited

me.

SAM

Fine.  Fine.

JONAH

So I can go.

SAM

Sure.

(almost done with the

spices)

Looking good.

JONAH

Shouldn't you have used a

toggle bolt?

SAM

I think I know how to have a

spice rack.

SAM

God fucking dammit!  Shit!

Fuck.  Piss.

SAM

(still angry)

I'm sorry.

(softening)

I'm sorry.

SAM

I'm sorry.  I'm just --

JONAH

Stressed.

SAM

Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm

sorry.

A VOICE

Can I have half your beer?

SAM

Sure.

MAGGIE

What did I used to say? Here's

looking at you? Here's mud in

your eye?

SAM

Here's to us.  You used to say

here's to us.

(he looks at her and

his eyes well with

tears)

Oh babe.  I miss you so much it

hurts.

CUT TO:

WALTER

Happy New Year, darling.

ANNIE

Happy New Year.

WALTER

I was thinking, I have to go up

to Boston for the AAP

convention and then visit

Winston-Hughes about switching

over our computers.  Why don't

we meet in New York for

Valentine's Day weekend?

ANNIE

Walter, I'd love to --

WALTER

We'll stay at the Plaza --

ANNIE

Go for a walk in Central Park --

WALTER

Go to the Symphony --

ANNIE

We will?

(beat)

The Symphony?

(beat)

Okay.

(beat)

I'll take you to the Russian

Tea Room for pelmeni.

WALTER

What is it?

ANNIE

It's delicious, trust me.

WALTER

Does it have wheat in it?

ANNIE

I don't think so.

JONAH

Look at this, Dad.  They're

all for you --

MAILMAN

If you're having trouble

sleeping, you might want to try

drinking a glass of water from

the other side.

JONAH

I thought that was for hiccups.

MAILMAN

Does it work for hiccups?

JONAH

For hiccups, a spoonful of

sugar, you hold it in your

mouth for a minute.

MAILMAN

Really?

SAM

Just out of curiosity, how did

they get our address?

JONAH

They called and asked for it.

(reading)

"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.

You are the most attractive man

I've ever laid ears on."

SAM

How did they get our phone

number?

JONAH

You have to give them your

phone number or they won't let

you go on the air.

JONAH

(continues, reading)

"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I

am an SWF"--

(to Sam)

What is that?

SAM

Thank God.  Something you don't

know.  It's a single white

female.

JONAH

This is no good.  She's looking

for someone French.  Or Greek.

(puzzled, he throws the

letter into the reject

pile, opens another)

"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I

live in Tulsa." Where is that?

--

SAM

Oklahoma.  Do you know where

that is?

JONAH

Somewhere in the middle.

SAM

I'm not going to think about

what they're not teaching you

in school.  I am not going to

think about it.

(beat)

Generally speaking I think we

should rule out people who

don't live somewhere near here

--

JONAH

She's willing to fly anywhere.

SAM

She looks like my third grade

teacher.  I hated my third

grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait

a minute! She is my third

grade teacher!

JONAH

Dad, you're not taking this

seriously.

SAM

This is not how you do it.

(referring to the

hamburger)

You want this on an English

muffin or a bun?

JONAH

English muffin.  How do you do

it?

SAM

You see someone you like, you

get a feeling about them, you

ask them if they want to have a

drink or --

JONAH

-- a slice of pizza --

SAM

But not dinner necessarily on

the first date because by the

time you're halfway through

dinner you might be sorry you

asked them to dinner whereas if

it's just a drink, if you like

them you can always ask them

for dinner but if you don't you

can go home if you see what I

mean.

(beat)

I wonder if it still works this

way.

JONAH

It doesn't.  They ask you.

SAM

I'm starting to notice that.

JONAH (V.O.)

If you get a new wife, I guess

you'll have sex with her, huh?

SAM (V.O.)

What do you think?

JONAH (V.O.)

Will she scratch up your back?

SAM (V.O.)

What?

JONAH

In the movies women are always

scratching up guy's back and

screaming and stuff.  When

they're having sex.

SAM

Whose show was this on?

JONAH

Jed's got cables.

SAM

Go to sleep.

JONAH

Kiss Howard.

(he holds out the

teddy bear)

G'night, Howard.

CUT TO:

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Up next, "You and Your

Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia

Fieldstone, clinical

psychologist and the best

friend you never had.

(the teaser continues)

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

He says he doesn't love me any

more.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why do you want to be with

someone who doesn't love you?

ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)

Every time I come close to

orgasm he stops and goes to

make himself a sandwich --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why don't you make him a

sandwich beforehand?

SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

When I met my wife, it was so

clear.  I jus knew.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

What was it that made you know?

SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

I don't think I could really

describe it.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Why not?

SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

And if I could describe it, it

probably wouldn't be on a radio

show.

(he laughs to himself)

But what the hell.  It's not

one specific thing.  It's more

of a feeling.

(continuing)

You touch her for the first

time, and suddenly... you're

home.  It's almost like...

magic.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

We'll be back after this

commercial with Dr. Marcia

Fieldstone.

ANNIE

I think I'm going crazy, Tom.

I really do.  Are you happily

married?

TOM

(completely panicked by

the question)

What?

ANNIE

I mean, why did you get

married? Was it all fireworks

and trumpets and --

TOM

(regaining composure)

I got married because Betsy

said we had to break up or get

married.  So we get married.

ANNIE

But when you met her, did you

believe she was the only person

for you? That in some mystical,

cosmic way, it was fated?

TOM

Annie, when you meet someone

and you're attracted to them,

it just means that your

subconscious is attracted to

their subconscious,

subconsciously.  So what we

think of as chemistry is just

two neuroses knowing that they

are a perfect match.

ANNIE

I don't even know him.  But

I'm having all these fantasies

about a man I've never met,

who lives in Seattle.

TOM

It rains nine months of the

year in Seattle.

ANNIE

I know, I know.  I do not want

to move to Seattle.  But what I

really don't want to do is end

up always wondering what might

have happened and knowing I

could have done something.

What do you think?

(Tom opens his mouth to

say something, but

before anything comes

out, Annie fills the

void)

It's just cold feet, isn't it?

Everyone panics before they get

married, didn't you?

TOM

Yes, I did.

ANNIE

Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much

better just having blown this

off.

TOM

Any time.

JAY

Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda

... She's a weightlifter, but

it's not like her neck is

bigger than her head or

anything --

SAM

I'm not asking you to set me

up, Jay.  That's not what I

need your help for.  I want to

know what it's like over there.

JAY

And that's what I'm trying to

tell you.  What women are

looking over, okay? Pecs and a

cute butt.

SAM

You mean, like, "He has the

cutest butt"? Where did I hear

that recently?

JAY

Everywhere.  You can't even

turn on the news without

hearing about how some babe

thought some guy's butt was

cute.  Who the first babe to

say this was I don't know,

but it caught on.

JAY

When's the latest time you were

out there?

SAM

(trying to remember)

Seventy... eight.

JAY

Well.  Things are different.

First, you have to be friends.

You have to like each other.

Then you neck.  This can go on

for years.  Then you have

tests.  Then you get to do it

with a condom.

(beat)

The good news is, split the

check.

SAM

I don't think it could let a

woman pay for dinner.

JAY

Great.  They'll have a parade

in your honor.  You'll be Man

of the Year in Seattle

Magazine.  Tira misu.

SAM

What's tira misu?

JAY

You'll find out.

SAM

What is it?

JAY

You'll see.

SAM

Some woman is going to want me

to do it to her and I'm not

going to know what it is.

JAY

You'll like it.

SAM

(grimly)

This is going to be tougher

than I thought.

SAM

Jonah?

SAM

Jonah?

SAM

Jonah?

SAM

Jonah?

JONAH

Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.

SAM

It's nice to meet you, Jessica.

JONAH

Dad, this is amazing.  If you

play this backwards, it says

"Paul is dead."

SAM

I know.

JONAH

How do you know?

JONAH

Dad, could you close the door?

JESSICA

H and G.

(Sam looks back)

Hi and goodbye.

SAM

(to himself)

Get a life.

SAM

Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam

Baldwin, I don't know if you

remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.

I was wondering if you wanted

to have a drink... Friday,

say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner

would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.

ANNIE

Now those were the days when

people knew how to be in love.

BECKY

You're a basket case.

ANNIE

(as she types)

They knew it.  Time, distance,

nothing could separate them.

Because they knew.  It was

right.  It was real.  It was...

BECKY

... movie.

(beat)

That's your problem.  You don't

want to be in love.  You want

to be in love in a movie.

(beat)

Read it to me.

ANNIE

(reading her letter)

"Dear Sleepless and Son..."

BECKY

It sounds like the name of a

mattress store --

ANNIE

"I am not the sort of person

who listens to call-in radio

shows" --

BECKY

And this woman is a writer!

That's what everyone writes at

the beginning of letters to

strangers.

ANNIE

I know that.  You think I don't

know that? "I know that's a

dumb way to begin, but it's the

only way I can think of to

convey what happened to me the

other night when I heard the

two of you on the radio.  On

the other hand, maybe I'm just

losing my mind."

BECKY

You are.  You're losing your

mind.  What about Walter?

ANNIE

I'm going to marry Walter.  I

just have to get this out of my

system.

BECKY

Right.

ANNIE

I should say something in this

about magic.

BECKY

What?

ANNIE

I don't know.  I mean, what if

I never meet him? What if this

man is my destiny and I never

meet him?

BECKY

Your destiny can be your doom.

Look at me and Rick.

ANNIE

(typing some more)

"I want to meet you..."

BECKY

"On top of the Empire State

Building at sunset on

Valentine's Day."

ANNIE

Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New

York with Walter, I can squeeze

it in.

BECKY

You want to hear about destiny?

If my husband hadn't gone on a

diet, which caused me to leave

him, I would never have been on

that flight to Miami, and met

Rick, and ended up having sex

in the bathroom of a 727 with

that nob you slide that says

"vacant-occupied, vacant-

occupied, vacant-occupied" --

(she shudders in

ecstasy, then pulls

herself together)

ANNIE

You never told me you left your

husband because he went on a

diet.

BECKY

(nods; after a beat)

He lost all the weight...

there.

ANNIE

That's impossible.  A guy can't

--

BECKY

Can too.

ANNIE

No.

BECKY

Yes.

ANNIE

And then you left him? He lost

weight there and you left him?

BECKY

Plus he fell in love with a

temp.

ANNIE

Listen to this, I love this

part --

BECKY

Men never get this movie.

ANNIE

I know.

BECKY

Do you think at the end of the

movie when she's in the

wheelchair they can still do

it?

ANNIE

I always wondered about that

too.

SAM

It's okay, it's okay.  I'm

here.

JONAH

It was sinking.

SAM

What was?

JONAH

Our house.  There was water

coming in all the windows.

SAM

(calm and definite)

You're worried we're going to

be all right.  We're going to

be all right.

(Sam gives Jonah a

squeeze)

I remember sometimes you'd have

nightmares as a baby.  Your mom

would hold you and rock you and

sing you a song.

JONAH

Bye bye blackbird.

SAM

Is that what she used to sing?

JONAH

I miss her.

(beat)

What do you think happens to

someone after they die?

SAM

I don't know.

JONAH

Like do you believe in heaven?

SAM

I never did.  Or the whole idea

of an afterlife.  But I don't

know any more.  I have these

dreams about... your mom... and

we have long talks about...

about you, and how you are,

which she sort of knows but I

tell her anyway.  So what is

that? It's sort of an afterlife,

isn't it?

JONAH

I'm starting to forget her.

SAM

I know.  But she's here, Jonah.

Because I have you.  And as

long as I have you, I have your

Mom.

SAM

I... uh... have a date with

someone Friday night.

JONAH

Good.

SAM

Did I ever tell you about the

time I ate a dog biscuit?

Fieldstone...?

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I'm a writer for the Baltimore

Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie

Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece

bereavement and I understand

I need to know about him

DET. WHEEDLE

Okay.

ANNIE

She has a pattern of getting

involved with losers... Once

she almost ran away with a

human cannonball from the

circus.

DET. WHEEDLE

Do you want a matrimonial, past

wives, any kids--

ANNIE

No, I know that part --

DET. WHEEDLE

So you want a financial, is he

a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --

ANNIE

No, no, no, it's more like, who

is he, does he have a sense of

humor, is he nice -- no forget

nice, I've got nice --

DET. WHEEDLE

A sense of humor.

ANNIE

I'll tell you the truth, I

heard this guy on a call-in

radio show and I might not

marry the person I should marry

because I've become obsessed

with him.

DET. WHEEDLE

Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that

movie.

ANNIE

No.  Not remotely.  I just want

to find out about him.

DET. WHEEDLE

You want a tail.

(picking up the phone)

I got a guy in Seattle --

GERALDO

So how long have you been a

WOMAN

(husky voice)

About two weeks.

CLARISE

Pssst!

Clarise, I'll be back by

CLARISE

Whenever.

SAM

This one's for both of us.

JONAH

(reading from the

envelope)

Sleepless and Son.

(reading the postmark)

Baltimore.

SAM

I left the number of the

restaurant I'll be at if

there's any emergency.

CLARISE

Fine.

SAM

(to Jonah)

How do I look?

JONAH

(absently)

Great.

SAM

(looks in mirror)

I look stupid.  I look stupid,

don't I? I look like I'm

trying too hard.  I was going

to get a haircut but then I

thought I'd look like I just

got a haircut.

(checks his teeth,

peers up his nose)

JONAH

(reading the letters)

This is a good letter, Dad.

SAM

(checks his fly, looks

down at his feet)

The heels on these shoes are

very large.  Why have I never

noticed this? The heels on

these shoes are grotesque.

JONAH

Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.

SAM

Now I'm late.  Bye.

JONAH

Listen to this --

SAM

Not now, Jonah --

JONAH

Just this one part, okay?

(reading)

"I have been an excellent

third-baseman for as long as I

or anyone else can remember,

and I guarantee you will not

get one past me"

SAM

Jonah, I'm leaving --

JONAH

WAIT!!!

(Sam stops, amazed at

Jonah's vehemence;

Jonah continues

reading)

-- "and while we're on the

subject, let's just say right

now that Brooks Robinson was

the best third baseman ever.

It's important that you agree

with me on that because I'm

from Baltimore."  Dad, she

thinks Brooks Robinson is the

greatest.

JONAH

Dad!

SAM

Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson

is the greatest.

JONAH

It's a sign.

SAM

Oh, right.

SAM

Come here.  I want to show you

something.

SAM

Here is Seattle.

(moves his finger

across the country)

And here is Baltimore.  Case

closed.

(he pulls the map and

it snaps back up)

JONAH

She doesn't want us to go to

Baltimore.  She wants to meet

us in New York City on

Valentine's Day.  On top of the

Empire State Building.

SAM

Perfect.  We'll be there.

SAM

Hi.

VICTORIA

Hi.

SAM

You look good.

VICTORIA

You look good yourself.

VICTORIA

I thought you were never going

to call me.

SAM

You did?

VICTORIA

I really wanted you to call me,

and I thought you were never

going to --

SAM

You could have called me --

VICTORIA

No way.  No way I was going to

be the first woman you went out

with after...

(she gestures

helplessly)

There is no percentage

whatsoever in being the first

woman anyone goes out with

after...

SAM

You are the first woman I'm

going out with.

VICTORIA

Oh.

SAM

So whatdya say? I'll get the

check, and I'll call you in

eight months.

VICTORIA

Oh, you are funny --

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Tell me he's living in squalor.

Tell me everything he has is

being repossessed, including

his filthy, dented mobile home.

WHEEDLE

He's got a houseboat.

ANNIE

I hate boats.

WHEEDLE

It sounds nice.

ANNIE

Boats.  You go out in them.

You come back in them.  I hate

them.

WHEEDLE

Houseboats don't go anywhere.

ANNIE

Boats.  All anyone talks about

is the wind.  Is it up, is it

down.  I can't live with a man

who only talks about the wind.

WHEEDLE

It's not a boat boat.  It's

really a house.

ANNIE

But it's on the water.

WHEEDLE

It's on the lake right in the

middle of Seattle.

(beat)

It rains nine months of the

year in Seattle.

ANNIE

I hope I don't have to pay for

that piece of information.

WHEEDLE

No, that's free.  He's an

architect.  Used to do big

high-profile projects.  He

scaled it all back when his

wife died.  Now he remodels

people's homes.  He works in

a small firm, makes a good

living.

ANNIE

He's real.

JONAH

I figure we could go to New

York, catch the Knicks, and

since we'd be there anyway,

obviously we'd go to the Empire

State Building --

SAM

There she is.

JONAH

Why is she bringing that bag?

SAM

She's going to cook something

for us?

VICTORIA

Hi, Sam.  And let me guess --

you must be Jonah.

JONAH

Hi.

(back to the subject)

He should book now because we

can get an excursion fare.

Jessica's parents are travel

agents and --

SAM

Not now, Jonah.

SAM

We can't finish the job.  She's

on her sixth painter, now she's

thinking maybe she wants the

fireplace rebricked --

VICTORIA

I know her pretty well.  Maybe

I could call her --

SAM

I've already solved it.  I've

hired a hit man.

VICTORIA

Oh that is so funny, you are so

funny.

SAM

Every time she wants to change

something, she talks in this

little baby voice --

(in a little baby

voice)

"Couldn't you just move the

stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--

JONAH

Do you like baseball?

VICTORIA

Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has

box seats for the Mariners.

Why don't we all go next week?

JONAH

What about camping?

VICTORIA

What about it?

JONAH

Do you like it?

VICTORIA

I went camping once.

(to Sam)

I love to brush my teeth in a

brook and floss with a weed.

JONAH

We ought to start camping

again, Dad.

SAM

Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.

JONAH

It's only ten o'clock.

SAM

(a little edgy)

Jonah!

JONAH

Okay.

SAM

Thank Victoria for dinner.

JONAH

Thanks for dinner.  I never saw

anybody cook potatoes that way.

SAM

(gracious)

I'm glad you liked it.  Good

night, Jonah.

ANNIE

(groggy)

Hello.

BECKY

(through filter)

Turn on your radio!

ANNIE

What?

BECKY

(through filter)

The kid is on.  You've got me

listening to this garbage.

Go on, turn it on.

WALTER

Who is it?

ANNIE

Oh, it's just Becky, she's

having trouble with Rich again.

(into phone)

Hold on, Becky, I'm going

downstairs.

JONAH (V.O.)

This is a complete disaster.  I

wanted him to find a wife, but

he's got the wrong one --

ANNIE

How am I going to explain this

to Walter?

BECKY (V.O.)

Shhh, listen to this --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Shouldn't your father be the

judge of whether she's right

or wrong?

JONAH

Please, please don't make me

sick.  He's not sane enough to

judge anything.  She's a ho.

JONAH (V.O.)

(muffled slightly)

My dad's been captured by a ho.

VICTORIA

Is he there?

SAM

(turning back)

No.

(beat)

After he was born, every time

we started to make love, he

would cry.  He had an uncanny

sense of timing.  We really

shouldn't do anything here

anyway.

VICTORIA

Absolutely.  Right.

JONAH

Oh God, it's major.  He's

kissing her on the lips.  I

have to stop this.

ANNIE

(muffled)

Come on, Jonah --

BECKY (V.O.)

Do something --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

Jonah, you can't butt in here.

JONAH

Yes, I can.

CUT TO:

WALTER

Miss Scarlett.  In the broom

closet.  With the radio.

ANNIE

(to Becky)

I gotta go.  I'll see you at

work.

(she hangs up, turns

off radio)

Walter, you scared me.  Don't

ever do that again.

SAM

Don't ever do that again.

JONAH

I thought I saw a black widow

spider.

SAM

What are you doing up?

JONAH

I was thirsty.

SAM

There's a bathroom upstairs.

JONAH

The water tastes better in the

kitchen.

SAM

That's true.  Why is that?

ANNIE

Becky heard this woman on the

radio complaining about this

guy she was sure was Rick,

which meant he was cheating on

her.  She was completely

hysterical.  Then it turned out

the woman lived in Duluth.

WALTER

That doesn't make any sense.

ANNIE

I know.  It makes no sense at

all.  Thank God my life is in

place.

JESSICA

Write her.

JONAH

You think so?

JESSICA

It's Y. O. H.

JONAH

(agreeing)

Yeah.

(a beat)

What's that?

JESSICA

Your only hope.

ANNIE

I thought I would look into

doing a story about those radio

shows.

BECKY

(nods; after a beat)

You'd probably have to go

somewhere to really look into

it.

ANNIE

Definitely.

SAM

(angry)

Get in the car right this

minute.

JESSICA

I'll call you later.

SAM

Did you call that radio station

again?

JONAH

No.

SAM

Everyone at work heard you.

JONAH

I just called for a second.

SAM

Long enough to call Victoria a

ho.

JONAH

It's a short word.

SAM

This is not a joke.  Thank God

Victoria doesn't know.  It

would really have hurt her

feelings.

JONAH

(really getting into

it)

If she knew, she'd never

forgive me.  It would be

hopeless for the two of you.

SAM (V.O.)

Don't open your mouth again.

Ever.

WALTER

Couldn't you just do a phone

interview?

ANNIE

Not for the kind of place I

want to do.  I won't be in

Chicago that long.

WALTER

When you get back, I'll be

gone --

ANNIE

And then I'll see you in New

York --

WALTER

Okay, okay.

PILOT'S VOICE

This is Captain Foster

welcoming you aboard Flight 132

to Seattle.  Our flying time

today...

ANNIE

Do you believe that any lie is

a betrayal? That's what Harold

Pinter says, but it seems to me

it's a very harsh way of

drawing the line.

VICTORIA

(turning to Jonah)

Can I bring something back for

you? A souvenir?

(to Sam)

Does he like those little snow

scenes?

(to Jonah)

You know -- you shake them up

and the snow floats down?

JONAH

(extremely polite)

Sure.  I'd really like that.

Thank you so much.

VICTORIA

Well...

JONAH

I think they're announcing your

flight.

SAM

He's ten.

VICTORIA

(he's good at it)

He's good at it.

SAM

I read an article about this

...

VICTORIA

I read the same article...

SAM

It takes time --

VICTORIA

Absolutely.  When I come back,

maybe the two of us should

spend some time together, on

our own.  What do you think?

SAM

Sure.  Sure.

SAM

(impatiently)

Jonah, this isn't fair.  You

don't know Victoria.  I hardly

know her myself.  She is, in

fact, a mystery to me.  She

tosses her hair a lot.  Why

does she do this? I have no

idea.  Is it a twitch? Does

she need a haircut? Should she

use barrette so it doesn't

keep falling in her face?

These are things that I'm

willing to get to the bottom

of, and that is why I am dating

her.  That is all I am doing.

I am not marrying her.  Can you

appreciate the difference?

That's what single people do,

they try people on and they see

if they fit.  But nobody fits

perfectly, everyone is an

adjustment.

JONAH

Was Mom an adjustment?

SAM

(complete exasperation)

I'm never going to meet anyone

who's going to measure up to

your mom in your eyes? What do

you think? There's a perfect

woman walking around out there?

SAM

There's no such thing as a

perf --

SAM

(to himself, referring

to Annie)

God, she's beautiful.

JONAH

(unaware he's talking

about Annie)

Victoria? She's okay.

JONAH

Dad, I was talking to Jessica

about reincarnation, and she

thinks that probably you knew

Annie in another life.

SAM

(completely distracted)

Who is Annie?

JONAH

The one who wrote us.

JONAH

(continuing)

But Jessica says you and Annie

never got together in that

life, and your hearts are like

puzzles with parts out of them

and when you get together the

puzzle's complete.

SAM

God dammit.

JONAH

The reason I know this and you

don't is that I'm younger and

purer so I'm more in touch with

cosmic forces.

SAM

I sincerely hope you are not

going to marry Jessica.

ANNIE

(practicing)

Hello, Mr.  Baldwin? No.

Hello, Sam?

(sweet)

I'm Annie Reed.

(dignified)

I'm Annie Reed.

(sultry)

I'm Annie Reed.

(matter-of-fact)

I'm Annie Reed.

ANNIE

I heard about you calling Dr.

Fieldstone, and well, I just

happened to be out here on...

ANNIE

(businesslike)

business...

ANNIE

(carefree)

vacation...

ANNIE

(losing confidence,

ready to pack it in)

for no good reason at all...

(rallying, businesslike

again)

business... and I thought I'd

drop and...

(breezy)

say hello...

ANNIE

(earnest)

invite you to lunch...

ANNIE

(sexy)

take a shower with you...

ANNIE

(embarrassed with all

this)

shoot myself.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE (V.O.)

I watched him play with his son

at the beach.

BECKY (V.O.)

Did you talk to him?

ANNIE

I couldn't do it.  How did I

get here?

BECKY

You told a lie and got on a

plane.

ANNIE

That's not what I mean.

(beat)

I'm going back over there

tomorrow and talk to him.  I

am.

BECKY

Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.

ANNIE

Becky?

BECKY

What?

ANNIE

Is this crazy?

BECKY

No.  That's the weirdest part

about it.

ANNIE

Thank you.  I love you.

BECKY

I love you, too.

ANNIE

Good night.

SAM

God, it's wonderful to see you.

Where's Greg?

SUZY

He's over at the boat show.

He'll be by later.

(she looks around)

It's so beautiful here.

DRIVER

Lady, what the hell are you

doing?

SAM

Hello.

ANNIE

Hello.

ANNIE (V.O.)

How could I have been such an

idiot?

BECKY

You were standing in the middle

of the street?

ANNIE

You know that dream where

you're walking down the street

naked and everyone is looking

at you?

BECKY

I love that dream.

ANNIE

That was nothing compared to

this humiliation, nothing.

BECKY

But he saw you, right?

ANNIE

He said hello.

BECKY

And what did you say?

ANNIE

All I could think of to say was

hello.

CUT TO:

BECKY

It's a sign --

ANNIE

It's a sign I've watched this

movie too many times.

(beat)

I'm so stupid.  From the minute

I listen to that stupid program

on the radio, I've been a

complete jerk.

BECKY

You don't know who she was,

Annie --

ANNIE

I saw her.  She looked just

like this --

BECKY

This is a photo of hair.

ANNIE

Well, it's the same woman.  And

he was crazy about her.

(looking at one letter)

What is this?

(beat)

This is from Seattle.

ANNIE

Becky?

BECKY

So I mailed your letter.

ANNIE

(reading the letter)

"Dear Annie: Thanks for your

letter.  It was great.  We're

very excited about meeting you

in New York on Valentine's Day

and seeing if we are M.F.E.O.

Sleepless in Seattle."

BECKY

M.F.E.O.?

ANNIE

Made for each other.

BECKY

It's cute.  It's like a little

clue.

BECKY

(continuing)

So he can't write.  Big deal.

I mean, verbal ability is a

highly overrated thing in a

guy, and our pathetic need for

it is what gets us into so much

trouble.

ANNIE

(with resolve)

I'm going to run back to

Walter's arms, if he's still

have me.

BECKY

What about the letter?

ANNIE

It doesn't mean anything.  It

was written before I went out

there.  Before the ho.

SUZY

You saw her in the airport and

then here?

SAM

I tried to talk to her...

(he shrugs)

It was like I knew her.  Weird.

GREG

Well, at least you're out there

seeing people again.  That's

terrific.

SAM

Well, just one really.

SUZY

How's Jonah taking it?

SAM

It'll take him a while to come

around.  A month ago he called

one of those radio call-in

shows and told them I needed a

wife --

SUZY

(charmed)

You're kidding --

SAM

Now that I'm seeing someone,

it's a whole other thing.

SAM

He's become obsessed with

some woman who wrote me --

GREG

Are you serious?

SAM

She wants to meet me at the top

of the Empire State Building.

SUZY

It's a little derivative.

SAM

What do you mean?

SUZY

"An Affair To Remember." Did

you ever see it? Cary Grant

and Deborah Kerr.  Before that

it was called "Love Affair With

Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."

GREG

Women love this movie.

SUZY

They met at the Empire State

Building, only they didn't.

Never mind.

GREG

What kind of person would write

to someone they heard on the

radio?

SAM

I got hundreds of letters from

women all over the country --

GREG

Desperate women --

SUZY

Just because someone's looking

for a nice guy doesn't make

them desperate.

GREG

How about rapacious and love-

starved?

SUZY

No.

GREG

It is easier to be killed by a

terrorist --

SUZY

It is not --

GREG

Right, right.

SAM

Anyway, Victoria's nice.

SUZY

Would you follow her through an

airport?

SAM

Look, I met somebody.  She's

good, and capable and smart.

We hit it off.  We can't spend

your life chasing after

fantasies.

ANNIE

Hi.

SAM

Hi.

(a beat)

So far so good.  So.  What

should we talk about? How

insecure we were in high

school.  Shirley Votypka, the

first girl I ever felt up.

Health.  What about health?

Did you know that eating six

macadamia nuts is the

equivalent of eating a steak?

ANNIE

Shhhh --

BECKY

You're going to miss the train.

ANNIE

No, I'm not.

(she starts assembling

her things)

BECKY

What are your plans in New

York?

ANNIE

We're going to the Rainbow Room

and the symphony tomorrow night.

BECKY

I love the symphony.

ANNIE

(cheerfully)

I hate it.

(she stands to go,

starts toward the

elevator)

I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I

feel happy.  This is right.

This is real.  Everything else

is what happens when you watch

too many movies and completely

lose sight of what counts.

(as she steps into

elevator)

Please don't tell anyone about

what happened.  "Sleepless in

Seattle" is history.

JESSICA

(weeping)

This is the best movie I've

ever seen in my life.

JONAH

I don't get it.

JESSICA

You have to go to her, Jonah.

You have to find her.

JONAH

Do you know how much it costs

to go to New York?

JESSICA

Nobody knows.  It changes

practically every day.  How

much money do you have?

JONAH

Eighty dollars.

JESSICA

I have forty-two.  So that

would definitely cover

taxicabs, I think.

JONAH

But how am I going to get

there?

JESSICA'S MOTHER

Honey, I'm going out for a few

minutes.

(sticking her head in

the door to the living

room)

Could you keep an eye on things

out front till I get back?

JESSICA

Sure.

JESSICA

Do you want an aisle or a

window seat?

JONAH

Window.

JESSICA

Do you want a fruit plate?

JONAH

I don't know.  Do I?

JESSICA

(shrugs)

I'd rather die than eat on an

airplane.

(beat)

I'm telling them you're twelve

so you can fly unaccompanied

and they won't make you be

carried around by a stewardess

and everything.

ANNIE

You go.

WALTER

Ever since Christmas, you've

been different.  Kind of

distracted, distant.  But I

feel like you're coming back

from wherever you were.

ANNIE

I am.

(she smiles at him)

I was just... I just got... I

think I got nervous.  It's

normal, right? Don't you ever

feel nervous about, you know?

WALTER

What?

ANNIE

About forever.

WALTER

No.

ANNIE

Well, I did.  And you know what

I think? I think that it was

almost... too perfect.

ANNIE

I started to wonder whether we

were the human equivalent of

two rights making a wrong, you

know?

ANNIE

It was like kismet but not, if

you see what I mean.

ANNIE

(continuing)

You have to grow up.  You can't

have all these adolescent

dreams about how exciting your

life is going to be --

ANNIE

(continuing)

Don't hate me but I love this

pattern.

WALTER

You couldn't.

ANNIE

I do.

WALTER

It's just like my grandmother's

china.

SALESWOMAN

How many place settings should

I put down?

ANNIE & WALTER

Ten.

WALTER

Exactly.  Eight is too few and

twelve is too many.

ANNIE

Walter.

WALTER

It was my mother's.

ANNIE

It's so beautiful.  It's just

what I would have picked out if

I'd had every ring in the world

to choose from.

(as she slips the ring

onto her finger)

You see what I mean.  There are

people who would like a

relationship to be full of

surprises, but I am not one of

them.

(as she starts out the

door with Walter

behind, thinking about

what she has just

said)

Surprises are highly overrated.

ANNIE

(continuing)

Promise me something, Walter.

Promise me you will never have

a surprise party for me.  Ever.

You know what happens, you walk

in the door in some horrible

sweater you put on that morning,

and there are hundreds of people

in their best clothes shouting

"Surprise!"

SAM

Have you seen my wallet?

JONAH

It might be in the kitchen.

SAM

I'm only going to be away one

night, okay, and Clarise will

be here.  You'll have a swell

time.  You'll watch a little

Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm

Street 12, I'll never know.

JONAH

Are you going with her?

SAM

Yes.

SAM

I have to have a life.  I have

to do things that I want with

people my own age.  It's none

of your business who I am going

out with.  I don't give a good

goddam if you're angry --

JONAH

(holding up Annie's

letter)

This is the one I like.

SAM

I don't care who you like.

It's who I like.  But the truth

is you're never going to like

anyone because it isn't your

mother.

JONAH

(yelling)

Fine.  I won't say anything.

You can marry Count Dracula.

SAM

Thank you, Jonah.  But the

point is, I am not asking

permission.

JONAH

(yelling)

What's wrong with Annie?

SAM

(emphasizing every

word)

Shut up.

JONAH

Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never

did that.  Mom never said shut

up to me.  Mom never yelled at

me.

SAM

This conversation is finished.

JONAH

You said we could go to New

York.

SAM

Did not.

JONAH

Did too.

SAM

I can't know what I said, but

we're not going.

JONAH

(crossing his arms

across his chest)

I'm not leaving this room until

you say yes.

SAM

Get out.

JONAH

No.

SAM

Goddammit, I am sick of this

--

JONAH

Put me down.  I hate you, I

hate you --

SAM

I'm sick of this phony

melodramatic bullshit.  I'm

sick of it.

SAM

Jonah?  Clarise is here, okay?

And I'm leaving.

SAM

Jonah?

(to Clarise)

He's probably still asleep.

TICKET CLERK

Next.

JESSICA'S MOTHER

Jessica, this is not

acceptable.

JESSICA'S FATHER

If you don't tell us right now,

right this minute, I'm going to

kill you.

JESSICA

He's on his way to New York.

JESSICA'S MOTHER

What?

SAM

How?

JESSICA

(the child of travel

agents)

United 597.

JESSICA'S MOTHER

Jessica!

SAM

When does it leave?

JESSICA'S FATHER

Eight-thirty.

STEWARDESS

Here you go... here's a nice pin

for you, for flying with us.

JONAH

(completely unmoved,

but polite)

Thank you.

STEWARDESS

You're welcome.  Can I take

that for you?

JONAH

(clutching it even

tighter)

No.

SAM

(frantic)

He's about this high, 90

pounds, never combs his hair,

Mariner's hat --

AIRLINE CLERK

(to his colleagues)

Anyone check in a

unaccompanied minor on the New

York flight?

FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK

I did.

SAM

I'll kill him.

(beat)

I have to get to New York as

fast as I can.

AIRLINE CLERK

We can get you on a flight to

Chicago and you can change

planes --

AIRLINE CLERK

How will you be paying for

this?

SAM

(taking out his wallet)

American Express.

(there's no American

Express card in his

wallet)

Visa.

(beat)

I really am going to kill him.

TAXI DRIVER

Where to?

JONAH

Empire State Building.

SAM

(to himself)

Come on... come on... come on...

COMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEON...

CABBIE'S VOICE

There it is.

CABBIE

What are you gonna do there,

spit off the top?

JONAH

No.  I'm gonna meet...

(trying to figure out

what to call her)

my mother.

WALTER

Is something wrong.

MAITRE D'

May I get you a drink?

WALTER

Some champagne?

ANNIE

Fine, fine.

WALTER

Beautiful view, isn't it?

ANNIE

Walter, there's something I

have to tell you --

SAM

Sorry, this is an emergency.

SAM (V.O.)

Empire State Building.

JONAH

Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?

WOMAN #1

No.

(smiles at him)

I'm Cynthia.

JONAH

Excuse me, are you Annie?

SAM

You're my family.  You're all

I've got.  What if something

happened to you?

SAM

What if I couldn't get to you?

JONAH

I was scared of what you were

gonna do.

SAM

When I found you?

JONAH

If I didn't go.

SAM

Listen, have I ever done

anything really stupid?

JONAH

No.

SAM

I mean, so far, have I screwed

it up for you?

JONAH

No.

SAM

I can't believe you flew first

class.

JONAH

It was all they had.

ANNIE

I don't know what to say about

it, Walter.  It was a form of

temporary insanity.  But I had

to tell you about it because --

WALTER

(matter-of-fact)

-- it was a betrayal.

ANNIE

Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It

was just...

WALTER

So what happened?

ANNIE

I told you.  Nothing --

WALTER

At the top of the Empire State

Building --

ANNIE

I'm not at the top of the

Empire State Building.  I'm

here.

WALTER

Not really.

(beat)

Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's

leave that out of it.  I don't

want to be someone you're

settling for.  I don't want to

be someone anyone settles for.

(beat)

I have a life insurance policy,

I'm fully invested in growth

stocks, I have a paid

subscription to Home Rox

Office, I have no sexual

diseases, I have been steadily

employed in a part of the

economy that isn't soft, I have

expectation in the way of

inherited wealth, I dress

nicely, I am a member of the

private sector, an independent

voter, I don't watch Monday

Night Football, the only thing

wrong with me is that I am

allergic to wheat,

strawberries, penicillin,

pollen, nuts and wool.  There

are plenty of women who see me

as the brass ring.  If you

don't -- marriage is hard

enough without bringing such

low expectations into it, isn't

it?

ANNIE

Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve

you.

WALTER

I think that's what I'm saying.

ANNIE

You okay?

WALTER

Yes.

(beat)

Some people will do anything to

get out of going to a symphony.

ANNIE

Oh!

WALTER

What?

ANNIE

Look!

WALTER

Go for it.

CUT TO:

ELEVATOR OPERATOR

Last call.  Closing time.

JONAH

This is pretty dumb, wasn't

it?

SAM

Big deal.

SAM

Maybe we'll get a dog when we

get back.

JONAH

Okay.

SAM

What do you mean, okay?

Wouldn't you like a dog?

JONAH

Sure.

SAM

Let's go home.

INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators

are closed.

ANNIE

(out of breath)

No.  Please.  I really need to

get up there.

INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

We're closing up.  No more runs

tonight.

ANNIE

(out of breath)

Listen, can I just take a look?

Maybe... maybe... There's

someone I was supposed to

meet... He's probably not

there, but if I don't at least

look I'll always wonder about

it.

INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

Cary Grant, right?

ANNIE

You know that movie?

INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

One of my wife's favorites.

ELEVATOR MAN

Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.

ANNIE

Can I take a minute?

ELEVATOR MAN

Go ahead.

JONAH

I left it near the...

SAM

It's you.

ANNIE

It's me?

SAM

The one in the street.  I

chased after you.

JONAH

Are you Annie?

ANNIE

Yes.

SAM

(confused)

You're Annie too?

ANNIE

(indicating the

backpack)

Is this yours?

JONAH

I'm Jonah.

(nodding back to Sam)

That's my dad.  His name is

Sam.

ANNIE

Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

(indicating the teddy

bear)

And who is this?

JONAH

Howard.

ANNIE

Howard.

SAM

We better go.

SAM

Shall we?

ANNIE

Sam?

ANNIE

It's nice to meet you.
