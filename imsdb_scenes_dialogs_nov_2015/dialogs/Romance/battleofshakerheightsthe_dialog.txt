THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS

Written by

Erica Beeney

KELLY

Where the hell are those Krauts?

KELLY

Shit.

KELLY

Bingo.

KELLY

"And so they buried Hector, breaker

of horses."

GERMAN OFFICER

(O.S.)

Eine maus findet den kase.

KELLY

Kill me Adolf.

GERMAN OFFICER

Mien Prisoner!

KELLY

Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you

waiting for? Kill me.

KELLY

Come on you pussies. Let's get this

over with.

GERMAN OFFICER

(German accent)

You will write your mother. Tell her

how you will die now.

KELLY

Genuine Third Reich issue, no less.

Nice work.

GERMAN OFFICER

You will write. How you die alone.

KELLY

My mother and I don't have that kind

of relationship.

GERMAN OFFICER

(hisses)

Write.

GERMAN OFFICER

Enough. Now you will beg for your

life.

KELLY

What don't you understand?

INFANTRYMAN

(interrupts sheepishly

in German accent)

The protocol says we should -

GERMAN OFFICER

I am the fucking protocol.

(to Kelly)

Beg!

GERMAN OFFICER

Beg - for - your - life!

KELLY

You got to be kidding me.

GERMAN OFFICER

Silence. Now I have a little fun.

KELLY

Now that's against the rules.

GERMAN OFFICER

(sneers)

There are no rules in war.

KELLY

(to Officer)

You've never killed anyone before,

have you?

GERMAN OFFICER

I shower in the blood of my victims --

GI

No wonder you smell so bad.

GERMAN OFFICER

Don't shoot, please.

GI

Will you look at the manners on this

guy?

(to German)

Remember to thank me when I kill

you.

GERMAN OFFICER

No, really, not in the neck -

GI

(to Kelly)

You all right?

KELLY

Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't

going anywhere anyway.

GI

You want me to give you a minute?

KELLY

That's okay. They'll get me

eventually. If you can't get killed

in a war, when can you?

GI

That's right. Look on the bright

side.

GI

Bart. Bart Bowland.

KELLY

Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.

BART

Kelly?

KELLY

(mimics)

Bart?

BART

I mean - that's Irish, right?

GERMAN OFFICER

(from the floor, now

with a decidedly

American accent)

Wow man, this is a really beautiful

scene and all, but I have to

interrupt.

(to Bart)

Why the fuck did you have to shoot

that cap so close to my neck? You

gave me a powder burn.

KELLY

Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should

talk. You slapped me. I'm not your

bitch.

GERMAN OFFICER

Well, what was that whole creepy

death wish thing about?

KELLY

Well it didn't work, now did it?

GERMAN OFFICER

(shrugs)

Sometimes I get so caught up in the

moment.

KELLY

And what was that ridiculous shit

about making me write to my mother?

GERMAN OFFICER

Inspired, wasn't it?

BART

Dude, you made him write to his

mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?

INFANTRYMAN

(also with American

accent)

Can we get up now?

BART

Might as well. There's only an hour

left anyway.

GERMAN OFFICER

(to Kelly)

Admit it. You were scared.

KELLY

(snorts)

Right.

BART

That Willys yours?

KELLY

Yup. Just got her. Three summers

packing out at Shop Rite.

KELLY

My bad. Thanks though.

KELLY

See you.

KELLY

Well, come on.

KELLY

I couldn't resist.

BART

Real funny, Ernswiler. You might

still get your chance to die today.

BART

Character building? Those crazy guys

from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.

KELLY

(shrugs)

That's what you get for invading

Wisconsin.

BART

D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At

Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a

guy who actually injected himself

with malaria.

KELLY

That's crazy.

BART

Where do you live, anyway?

KELLY

Shaker Heights.

BART

That explains the death wish. Me

too. What street?

KELLY

Penn Place.

BART

(chewing)

Hmm, don't know it.

KELLY

It's not technically in Shaker Heights

- but I go to Shaker Heights High.

BART

Langely Prep.

KELLY

Sorry to hear that.

BART

Well, I got kicked out of Shaker

Heights High because my birdhouse

came unglued in honors woodshop.

KELLY

Of course. I would have gone to

Langely myself only my polo pony had

the fits.

BART

No matter.

(raises his voice to

address the room)

We're all soldiers here.

CROWD

That's right./Here, here./ Whooping,

cheers, etc.

BART

You should come over some time.

Service our lawnmower.

KELLY

I would, but then I might soil my

croquet whites. You understand.

BART

How bourgeois. Cheerio then.

KELLY

Sleep tight Hot Lips.

ABE

Sergeant Keller! How was the war?

Did we win?

KELLY

Let me guess. Happy Meals for the

wavy gravy wellness center?

ABE

As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.

KELLY

As usual, your cheerful optimism

makes me ill.

ABE

(lightly)

You should get that checked.

KELLY

(O.S.)

Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif

Garrett for me.

MAO

(to Kelly)

Son of Eve. You are very dirty.

KELLY

(awkward)

A rough charge. You know.

EVE

(to Kelly)

Don't touch anything. We have to get

ready for the Starving Artist show.

(to Xiou-Xiou)

Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery,

not gloppy - see?

EVE

Now you try.

EVE

(to Kelly)

She loves the gold. Always overuses

it. And usually her touch is so light.

XIOU-XIOU

Gold is the color of the sun.

KELLY

You know why we never have anything

to eat in this house?

EVE

Mao, what did we say about the eyes?

MAO

More - empathy?

EVE

That's right. And didn't I tell you

to put in more cacti?

MAO

(shakes head)

No, no more cacti. Too busy.

Simplicity is best.

EVE

Oh boy. I'm not having this battle

with you again.

KELLY

Because your husband takes food from

his own family to feed every loser

druggie in Cleveland.

EVE

Well, you can always chip in here.

We're ordering pizza later.

KELLY

No. Some people have to work later.

(casual)

Will you drop something off at the

dry cleaners for me tomorrow?

EVE

Sweetie, you know what we said about

paying for the war things. Nothing's

changed.

KELLY

It's the only thing I ever ask you

for --

EVE

Don't be dramatic.

KELLY

But it's important to me.

EVE

You're just going to have to find a

way to pay for it yourself then, I

guess.

(to Mother Ling)

No - not that way - the sky should

be stormier. Angry clouds.

KELLY

Why do I bother?

EVE

More brown, less blue.

ABE

Now Keller, who needs that sandwich

more - you or the daughter of a crack

addict trying to make a new life?

KELLY

How about the son of a heroin addict

trying to get ready for work?

ABE

That went well.

SARAH

So how'd your battle go today? I

still don't understand how you could

reenact the Battle of the Bulge in

seventy-two degree weather.

(plays with hair)

Didn't all those guys freeze to death?

KELLY

Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a

couple of guys.

SARAH

That's gross.

KELLY

War is hell.

SARAH

Then why do you do it?

KELLY

You're never more alive then when

facing simulated death.

SARAH

Really? Maybe I should try it.

KELLY

You are William J. Stone of the 1st

Airborne, pinned down in Noville.

The Germans have the high ground and

they're shelling your position

heavily.

(starts throwing cans)

You're holed up in a stone barn.

Sustaining heavy casualties. Running

low on ammo. The cries of wounded

men fill the air like the cries of

hungry babies.

KELLY

Your commanding officer gets hit in

the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose

radio contact with headquarters. If

you withdraw, the Germans will flank

the entire Allied forces arrayed

along Bastogne and break the front.

What do you do? What do you do?

SARAH

Stop it!

KELLY

Battle of Bulge, the Southern

Shoulder, December '44.

SARAH

Sorry I asked.

KELLY

Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole

shipment in of busted Oreo's.

SARAH

I'll accidentally drop a couple pints

of milk and meet you over there.

SARAH

The frozen food woman came in with

her kids. They must eat out of those

little cardboard trays every night.

One of the kids looked like cardboard.

KELLY

Do you know we stock more flavors of

cat food than we do baby food?

SARAH

No.

KELLY

Sixteen flavors of baby food including

the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty-

one flavors of cat food.

KELLY

Next time you should tell that woman

to buy her kid some cat food.

WOMAN

Is this store open? I've been waiting

up front. If the store's closed, it

shouldn't have a sign that says twenty-

four hours.

SARAH

Sorry about that.

WOMAN

I have a lot of coupons and I don't

want to be here when they expire.

KELLY

(to Sarah)

Charge her double for everything.

LANCE

What the fuck are you looking at, GI

Jane?

LANCE

No really, what makes you think you

can look at me?

KELLY

I honestly didn't know it was you. I

thought it was a free preview of the

Spice Channel.

LANCE

That's pretty funny. You got dental

insurance?

BRIDGET

Stop it.

LANCE

What? What?

MR. NORMAN

Whoops!

MR. NORMAN

And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks

of Union soldiers fought bravely on.

They were willing to give their lives

so that others might be free.

MR. NORMAN

Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?

KELLY

No.

KELLY

Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad

simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second

grade history class, sure - but to

insist on still characterizing the

Civil War as some moral struggle?

The soldiers were drafted - the only

ones who had to fight were the ones

who couldn't afford to pay their way

out.

(losing it)

Why don't you talk about the Draft

Riots? Where are your slides for

that?

HOLMSTEAD

What gives you the idea that you can

or ought to question the curriculum?

HOLMSTEAD

Or question your teacher?

KELLY

I know. I mean, who ever heard of a

classroom dialog? Not Socrates.

HOLMSTEAD

Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But

you're making some serious mistakes.

KELLY

I don't need to. Everyone else makes

them for me.

HOLMSTEAD

This anger must be masking a lot of

hurt.

KELLY

I was wondering what the tissues

were for.

HOLMSTEAD

I see you're not going to college

next year. What are your plans?

HOLMSTEAD

How do I get through to you?

KELLY

Advertisers use status and sex to

appeal to my demographic.

HOLMSTEAD

I think we can come up with a

punishment which might actually be

more of an opportunity for you to

realize your true potential.

LANCE

You upset Bridget.

KELLY

Give me a break.

LANCE

You need to apologize.

KELLY

What are you going to do, make out

with me?

LANCE

Why are you fucking with me? You

little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?

KELLY

You just used fuck as a verb, noun,

and adjective. Impressive.

LANCE

Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got

in his knapsack.

KELLY

Rim job.

BART

Kelly. Hey.

KELLY

You work here?

BART

Just a couple days a month, to get a

heads-up on the latest stuff. What

are you doing?

KELLY

Looking for a backpack.

BART

Is that all? Don't bother. I have a

couple extras at home. I could give

you one if you want.

KELLY

(beat)

Sure, I guess.

KELLY

Very impressive.

BART

My dad's real into hoarding.

KELLY

What's this?

BART

Grant's field flask.

KELLY

Wow. Your dad should meet my history

teacher. He sent me to the principal's

office today for questioning his G-

rated interpretation of the Civil

War.

BART

Forget him.

KELLY

I would, but now the principal's

making me give a speech on the Civil

War at an assembly.

BART

(laughing in sympathy

and amusement)

What is he, some kind of sadist?

KELLY

She thinks she's doing me a favor.

BART

Jesus, she must think you're really

screwed up. Are you?

KELLY

Depends on who you ask. Everyone's

got an opinion.

BART

(grabs box)

Take this. That'll shut them up.

BART

Stonewall Jackson's.

KELLY

Yeah right.

BART

Can you imagine that? Losing your

leg and getting back up on your horse?

Unbelievable. What balls.

BART

He's got so much crap crammed in

here he doesn't even notice when

it's missing. I saw a backpack in

here somewhere.

BART

I thought he had a couple.

KELLY

I'd feel weird taking one out of the

tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.

BART

Trust me, you shouldn't.

(burps)

Where'd your old one go?

KELLY

I lost it.

BART

How?

KELLY

Someone took it.

BART

You let someone take it?

KELLY

I didn't let him. I told off some

idiot --

BART

Sounds like your mouth gets you into

trouble a lot.

KELLY

I'm telling you, it's not me, it's

the world.

BART

Tabby, this is Kelly.

TABBY

(to Kelly)

Don't give him any money, whatever

you do.

BART

Shut up.

TABBY

All these little old ladies are

looking for him in Arizona. He took

their retirement money and bought

defective bazookas with it.

BART

Very funny. We're paying attention

to you, are you happy now?

TABBY

Finally, my life is complete. Fait

accompli.

BART

(to Tabby)

Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want

one?

TABBY

Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.

TABBY

I have to go take a shower. Will you

call me when Miner gets here?

KELLY

Who's Miner?

BART

The fiance.

BART

Listen, I'm going to the flea market

on Saturday. I have a line on a couple

dealers. You could get a backpack

there.

KELLY

Oh yeah? Flea market, land of

bargains.

BART

Especially if you know who to talk

to.

LANCE

Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I

just joined the Boy Scouts.

KELLY

If you stay in it long enough, maybe

you'll get your fudgepacker badge.

LANCE

You're a regular Howie Mandel.

BRIDGET

Lance!

LANCE

Okay babe.

(to Kelly)

One day you and me will be alone.

And won't that be nice?

KELLY

Too bad my mom won't let me date

yet.

SARAH

Why do you mess with him?

KELLY

You're right. I should give him a

break.

EVE

Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need

you to go to the art supply store

for me.

KELLY

Get Abe to do it.

EVE

He was going to but he had to go

lead a meeting at Care House.

KELLY

What a surprise.

EVE

I'll make it up to you.

KELLY

Where have I heard that before?

EVE

When are you going to give me a break?

KELLY

Let me think - maybe when I finally

forget every single word of The Little

Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in

the car waiting for him to score.

No, probably when I don't prepare

myself before I go into the bathroom,

expecting to find him passed out on

the floor.

KELLY

Actually, you know what? I know I'll

be able to put it all behind me when

I go away to college.

(slaps his forehead,

pretend remembering)

Only, I can't go because someone

spent my college fund on Mexican

Black Tar. So looks like I'll have

to try to forget at Shop Rite, where

I'll be working for the rest of my

life.

EVE

You're right. You have every reason

to crawl into the corner and give

up. But please just get me some paints

first.

KELLY

What do you need?

EVE

We need burnt sienna, cadmium red,

and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue.

(looks at him)

What happened to your face?

KELLY

Forget it.

KELLY

They're having a sale on glitter.

TABBY

Oh, hello. What happened to you?

KELLY

(shrugs)

Tennis injury.

TABBY

You paint?

KELLY

Well, you see... That's a difficult

question.

TABBY

How so?

KELLY

I don't really feel comfortable

calling anything done since the

Renaissance "painting." We might

have a more experimental interaction

with the picture plane, but our skills

have suffered from it.

KELLY

You're working with acrylic. Why?

Oil's much - richer.

TABBY

Oh you're not one of those oil snobs

are you?

KELLY

Of course not.

KELLY

It's just - isn't acrylic a bit -

jejune?

TABBY

Jejune? You're jejune. How old are

you anyway?

KELLY

Older than my years.

TABBY

And you paint?

KELLY

Well, you know, my mother's kind of

an artist, so -

TABBY

That explains it.

KELLY

That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone

believe in innate knowledge anymore?

Michelangelo was fifteen when he

painted the Infanta.

TABBY

Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo

was Italian.

KELLY

Exactly. One world, one people. Just

like Jesse Jackson envisioned.

TABBY

Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.

KELLY

What the hell did you just say?

SKINNY GUY

(to Kelly)

That there's actual sand from Iwo

Jima.

BART

Or your sister's sandbox.

SKINNY GUY

Well, it don't come with no

certificate of authenticity.

(considers)

I could write one up for you, I

suppose. Get it notarized.

BART

No, that's quite all right. Actually,

I'm in the market for medals.

SKINNY GUY

Sure. I got a couple purple hearts.

A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them

to you though. They were gramp's.

(wink)

BART

Are you sure?

SKINNY

They have a lot of sentimental value

-

BART

Yeah. How much?

SKINNY GUY

A lot.

SKINNY GUY

What's this?

BART

General Ulysses S. Grant's field

flask, my friend.

BART

Throw in one of those backpacks and

we'll call it even.

KELLY

Buying and selling US service medals

is illegal.

BART

Exactly. That's why the resale value

is so high.

KELLY

Is that what they teach you at

Langely?

BART

Don't be so naive. We all have our

skeletons. Some of them just pay

more than others.

KELLY

And I'm not even going to ask about

the flask.

BART

Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets

everything right, don't they?

WOMAN

You boys look like Goldwater fans.

KELLY

I've never been accused of that

before.

WOMAN

Well jeez, you don't have to be

insulted.

BART

Anything military?

WOMAN

Fish around in that cigar box.

BART

What do you want for the box?

WOMAN

Twenty dollars.

BART

Fifteen.

WOMAN

Don't be so hasty.

(fanning)

I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins

I'm looking to unload.

KELLY

Goldwater fan. I think that's some

kind of insult.

BART

Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going

to go to school?

KELLY

I'm not.

BART

Ah, you have that luxury.

KELLY

You don't?

BART

(shrugs)

I didn't have much say in the matter.

Everything has been decided for me

since birth. I'm not whining about

it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?

KELLY

Easy for you to say. You got a royal

flush.

BART

Are you crazy? My life sucks.

Everyone's always telling me what to

do. You can't fight it. Go with the

flow.

KELLY

What about Tabby?

BART

She got to go where she wanted. Sarah

Lawrence. Six years. She's almost

done with grad school. Yale.

KELLY

I didn't think people actually went

to Yale.

BART

(thinking)

I don't know. I mean, she drives off

in her car in September. For all we

know, she could just pull her car

over in Albany and sleep there until

May.

KELLY

What do you mean?

BART

It was a joke. Joke?

KELLY

Oh. Is that what one of those sounds

like? Somehow, I always imagined

they would be funnier.

KELLY

Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for

lesbians?

BART

What happened to your face?

KELLY

Remember the backpack incident?

BART

Same guy?

KELLY

The one with mad cow-diseased

hamburger meat for brains? That would

be the one.

BART

What are you going to do about it?

KELLY

I'm not going to lower myself to his

level.

BART

Of course not. But there are

alternatives...

KELLY

Alternatives?

BART

Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd

Special Operations Wing?

BART

Well do you want to get this guy or

what?

KELLY

Yes.

BART

All right. Let's get the fuck out of

here, then.

BART

(on the move)

I have some things to show you.

BART

Once we've gathered the intelligence,

the plan will reveal itself.

KELLY

We don't plan first?

BART

No, it limits our scope - what's the

objective?

KELLY

Humiliation. Rage. Despair.

BART

Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go-

to war for that sort of thing. I

have the declassified briefs from

the Phoenix Project around here

somewhere.

TABBY

Hey. I have some stretcher bars out

in the car. Can somebody help me

bring them in?

BART

Of course we'll drop what we're doing

because what you're doing must be

more important.

KELLY

Sure. I mean, I'll help.

BART

I'll find those reports.

KELLY

Gold. The color of the sun.

TABBY

That's the Cleveland waterfront.

KELLY

As the viewer, I get to decide what

it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't

look a thing like it.

TABBY

It's the light. I was playing with

diffusion.

KELLY

Well make sure you put it away when

you're done with it.

TABBY

Very funny, wiseass.

KELLY

It must be nice to have a place like

this to get away to.

TABBY

It is.

KELLY

What about Farmer?

TABBY

Farmer?

KELLY

The boyfriend.

TABBY

(laughs)

Miner? What about him?

KELLY

Is he an artist, too?

TABBY

No. Definitely not. Thank god.

TABBY

You said your mom was a painter?

KELLY

She was, well - is I guess.

TABBY

What do you mean?

KELLY

She used to be. But then my dad -

wasn't working anymore so she turned

it into a business. She has a family

of Chinese immigrants in the garage

making them for her.

TABBY

Like Andy Warhol's Factory.

KELLY

More like Andy Warhol's tool shed.

It was nice before, though. My playpen

used to be in her studio.

TABBY

Wow. So you really grew up with it.

What does, did, your dad do?

KELLY

He's a VH-1 documentary without the

music.

TABBY

"Tragedy struck?"

KELLY

"And then, things took a turn for

the worse."

TABBY

Well, just wait. Those burnout types

always have a triumphant comeback

tour.

KELLY

I already changed the channel.

BART

Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a

little supply line assist and you're

gone for days. Come on.

TABBY

Have fun, boys.

KELLY

If only it were fun. War's deadly

serious, ma'am.

TABBY

(to Bart)

And I used to think you were the

only crazy one.

BART

Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi

Hannah.

KELLY

I'm worried about you playing with

diffusion unsupervised.

TABBY

Are you?

KELLY

Yes. I might have to come by and

show you the proper safety procedures.

Some time in the presence of an art

prodigy would do you good.

TABBY

I don't think I have room for a

playpen in here.

KELLY

Ouch.

BART

So, you have a thing for my sister?

KELLY

What? No, no.

BART

Everybody does.

KELLY

We just have a few things in common.

BART

Oh really, like what?

KELLY

I can't tell you. It's my feminine

side.

BART

You don't wear women's clothes when

you're alone, do you?

KELLY

Dad.

KELLY

(louder)

Dad?

ADDICT

Wha?

KELLY

Sorry.

ABE

Keller. There's a meteor shower.

KELLY

A funny thing just happened. A little

trip down memory lane. I thought you

were on our couch, dead.

ABE

Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't

have an empty bed for him at Care

House.

KELLY

Well that's one of your more brilliant

ideas.

(anger rising)

Have you thought about the fact that

it might be dangerous? That he might

steal something, or go into cardiac

arrest? Drink all our cooking wine?

Which he seems to have done.

ABE

He just needs a place to sleep for

the night.

KELLY

You're right. Besides, having him

here makes it feel like home.

ABE

I've been straight for four years,

almost five. A third of your life.

KELLY

Big whoop. I've been straight the

whole time.

ABE

I hate to tell you this, but I'm not

your problem anymore.

KELLY

No. That's the one thing I get to

decide.

ABE

Let me know. I can wait.

ABE

(to himself)

Keller, there's a meteor shower.

KELLY

I have the target in sight.

KELLY

I think he's leaving.

BART

Let me see. Don't be a farb, give

them up.

BART

The coast is clear.

BART

Let me prepare to deploy.

KELLY

Is this going to work?

BART

We've planned for every contingency

using the tried and true techniques

of the last great world power.

KELLY

Save it for the press conference.

BART

Stay low. On my signal.

KELLY

We're the good guys. If you scream,

the bad guys are going to come and

burn down your house. Okay? So stay

here and be quiet.

GIRL

My dad has a gun.

NEIGHBOR

Can I help you, young man?

KELLY

I was just inspecting your lawn.

KELLY

Have you thought about Astroturf? It

takes a lot less water to keep green.

I mean, no water, technically.

NEIGHBOR

I'm not interested.

KELLY

Oh. I see. Okay then.

KELLY

Oh, shit.

KELLY

Oh, shit.

LANCE

Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss

some day.

BART

What an asshole. His mom gave me

cookies, though.

KELLY

Did you get it done?

BART

Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go

home and listen.

BART

It was a five-watt FM bug, so we

should be in range -

LANCE'S MOM

(O.S.)

So then I told her, "Harriet, with

potato salad like that it's no wonder

Ray-Ray's cheating on you."

WOMAN

(O.S.)

You didn't.

LANCE'S MOM

You're right. But I was thinking it.

Instead I just told her to add more

vinegar next time, and -

KELLY

I don't think we can use any of this.

BART

Be patient. It's voice activated, so

we'll get everything. Trust me. It's

going to be great.

KELLY

All right, then.

BART

We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen

hundred hours.

EVE

-- And if we don't sell them there,

we'll set up on the corner of Stevens

and Lane, by the gas station. That's

a good location.

EVE

Are you listening to me?

ABE

Did you make this with more chili

pepper than usual?

EVE

The same as always.

EVE

Kelly. Want dinner?

KELLY

(O.S.)

I ate.

EVE

One day, we're all going to be happy.

ABE

That sounds nice.

BART

It's really too perfect, actually.

KELLY

What? What?

BART

I can't describe. Just hit play.

It's all cued up.

BRIDGET

(recorded)

I told you, that makes me nervous.

Me no likey.

LANCE

But baby, my birthday's coming up.

BRIDGET

Still. That's not a good enough

reason.

LANCE

Come on. A little action. A little

prime time action.

BRIDGET

But people might see us.

LANCE

That's the point. That's what makes

it sexxxy. Dangerous.

KELLY

Dangerous.

BART

Exactly.

KELLY

Let's draw up the plans.

BART

I have a few notes jotted down.

KELLY

Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry -

BRIDGET

Oh, it's okay -

BART

She dots her I's with hearts. And

her L's are loopier. The L is very

important.

KELLY

I'm working on it.

KELLY

I feel kind of bad for her. She's a

nice girl.

BART

Sometimes collateral damage can't be

avoided.

KELLY

Stop it.

KELLY

How does that look?

BART

(inspecting)

Pretty good. I think we're ready to

manufacture a document.

BART

(clears his throat)

Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday

and you've been a very bad boy. But

so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy

have to get punished, only this time

-

LANCE

(Cont.)

- baby makes the rules. Await further

instructions at school tomorrow --

LANCE

(V.O. cont'd)

-- Baby will be waiting where Daddy

least expects her. Love, Bridgie."

Yes!

BART

Do you have everything?

BART

We can't afford any errors.

KELLY

You don't need to tell me. It's my

ass on the line.

BART

I wish I could be there to see it.

KELLY

You'll get the de-brief.

BART

It's a day that will live in infamy.

KELLY

You couldn't do any better than that?

BART

I don't hear you coming up with

anything.

BRIDGET

What's gotten into you?

LANCE

Nothing, you bad girl.

BRIDGET

Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin

before school again?

LANCE

See you soon, my naughty baby.

LANCE

It's my birthday! I'm going to get a

present.

LANCE

Damn it, fuckface. What're you smiling

about? You wish you were me.

LANCE

Mr. Palmer? May I be excused?

KELLY

(to himself)

Eine maus findet den kase.

LANCE

Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt.

LANCE

Ooh, push my buttons.

LANCE

Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx.

BART

(serious grownup voice)

Yes, I need to get a message to

Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA.

BRIDGET

But I just got this note last period.

SECRETARY

Well I don't have anything here for

you - let me look again. Oh yes, the

MENSA called.

BRIDGET

Cool. They want me to be an honorary

member.

(pause)

Is that like a sorority or something?

LANCE

Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He

needs his medicine.

LANCE

I brought our friend along. He's

happy to see you.

LANCE

What the fuck are you all looking

at?

STUDENT 1

Look, he's got a hard on.

STUDENT 2

Eeeeew.

BART

You're kidding me.

KELLY

Yup. There it was. The whole school

saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.

BART

To Operation Mincemeat.

KELLY

To the 193rd.

BART

How does it feel to give better than

you get?

KELLY

Good. Real good.

BART

You want some more?

KELLY

(croaking)

Don't mind if I do.

BART

That's my boy.

KELLY

You know what this is?

KELLY

Eighteen volts of pure freedom.

SARAH

Sounds dangerous.

KELLY

Oh, it is. Unless you know how to

handle it.

KELLY

You ever seen the freshly waxed floor

in the produce section glistening

under full florescence? It's

breathtaking.

KELLY

Hold on tight.

KELLY

Close call.

SARAH

Have you been drinking?

MINNIE

Kelly? Bart's not here, he -

KELLY

Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm

here to see Tabby. Just to do a little

painting with her.

MINNIE

She's out back in her studio.

KELLY

Thanks.

TABBY

Kelly?

KELLY

Hey. I warned you I'd come.

TABBY

You did.

KELLY

Maybe I should go --

TABBY

Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set

your canvas up. Use one of the ones

in the corner.

TABBY

Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in

the drawer.

KELLY

I brought my own.

TABBY

Well then.

KELLY

Does it mess up your concentration?

Me being here?

TABBY

No.

KELLY

Oh. That's good.

TABBY

Just don't talk.

KELLY

Why would I?

TABBY

(pause)

I'm kidding.

KELLY

Right. Irony. I like that.

MINER

(O.S.)

Hey! Hey babe.

MINER

Miner Webber.

KELLY

Webber Miner.

TABBY

Kelly. This is Kelly -

KELLY

Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -

MINER

Quite all right.

(smiles as an

afterthought)

So, what do we have here, a little

painting class?

TABBY

Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.

MINER

Oh? What's your real job?

KELLY

That would be stock boy at the Shop

Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky

says, every employee is part owner.

So you could say I'm a captain-of-

industry in training. Kind of

capitalist larva.

MINER

That's quite an image.

KELLY

Only if you see the most magical

part. Do you see?

MINER

What?

KELLY

One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly.

First I'll have to be a pupa though.

I figure I won't be going out much

then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence

of the insect world.

MINER

Whatever it takes to get you through

the day.

MINER

I have the afternoon off. Come away

with me.

TABBY

I'm not at a good stopping point.

MINER

Oh, come on. They'll still be here.

(to Kelly)

I know you'll still be here.

TABBY

I really shouldn't.

MINER

But everyone will be coming soon.

And it will get all crazy, and we

won't have any time to ourselves.

TABBY

We will. I promise.

MINER

Like tonight? We can practice

honeymoon suite.

TABBY

Maybe. Probably.

KELLY

Is he always like that?

TABBY

Like what?

KELLY

Overbearing.

TABBY

Just because he didn't want to picture

you as a pupa?

KELLY

Oh, he will - later. When he's alone.

Whether he wants to or not.

KELLY

Not that though. How he wanted you

to stop.

TABBY

He wants to be with me. What's so

bad about that?

KELLY

Just because some one wants to be

with you doesn't mean they're good

for you.

KELLY

No one should ever ask you to stop.

If you stop, you might not be able

to start again. Or you might start

again, only things will be different.

TABBY

Well, that's sweet -

KELLY

It's not sweet, actually. It's just

the truth.

TABBY

Hey, I can take care of myself.

KELLY

When's the wedding?

TABBY

At the end of the month. But don't

ask me about it. It makes me nervous.

KELLY

Why? Is something wrong?

TABBY

No.

TABBY

What are you painting?

KELLY

Really, there are so many layers of

- imagistic symbolism - that I really

don't feel comfortable summing it

up, but, well - it's a recurring

dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket

ship.

TABBY

How?

KELLY

What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle.

She's riding it sidesaddle. She's

got a fish tail, for chrissake. I

haven't decided yet if she's got

scuba gear on or not.

TABBY

Do you have any idea what you're

talking about?

KELLY

Does that matter?

TABBY

Well, some people actually say what

they really think.

KELLY

What if they don't know what they

really think?

TABBY

It doesn't matter. It's called being

yourself.

KELLY

Sounds boring.

TABBY

Not boring. Scary and wonderful and

exciting.

KELLY

Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop

distracting me.

KELLY

Mom's got you working late?

XIOU-XIOU

No.

KELLY

Wow. You're really good. Why do you

make those stupid animals for mom?

XIOU-XIOU

Each painting is a lesson. Here -

KELLY

I'm making a lot of art these days.

I guess that means a lot of lessons.

XIOU-XIOU

Each line has a whole drawing

contained in it. Each drawing has a

whole life contained in it.

KELLY

Oh, that's all?

EVE

Hey you two. I'll try not to act

surprised. It might spoil the moment.

KELLY

I can't do this. I have to go.

EVE

Keller, I think I'm missing some art

supplies. Have you seen them around

the house?

KELLY

No, I haven't.

EVE

I don't know what to do with him.

XIOU-XIOU

You son is not yet cooked. Give him

time.

EVE

When are you going to let me give

you your own show? We could do it

for real.

XIOU-XIOU

No problem. When you offer me an

eighty-twenty split.

BART

(to Harrison)

-- But I told you I want to take

German --

HARRISON

German's a Cold War language. You

can't get any kind of State Department

position without more diverse

linguistic training than that. You'll

take Chinese.

HARRISON

Are we on the same page?

BART

(mutters)

Same page.

MATHILDA

(to Tabby)

So darling, when are you going to

bite the bullet and do the seating

arrangement?

TABBY

I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I

don't care who sits next to whom. I

should have eloped.

KELLY

After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes

when you bite the bullet, it explodes

in your mouth.

MATHILDA

(tentatively)

Why, I've never thought about it

before but that is a rather strange

expression, isn't it? You wouldn't

say, "Sooner or later you've got to

put the grenade in your pants," would

you?

HARRISON

But have you ever noticed how in

movies they always bite the grenade

before they throw it?

KELLY

Yeah, but they never take a bite out

of their pants.

MATHILDA

What an unusual conversation! Do you

have similar discussions at the dinner

table with your family, Kelly?

KELLY

Basically. I ask why all the furniture

is missing and my Dad reminisces

about dropping acid and watching

Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

TABBY

He talks about art.

BART/MATHILDA

You do?

KELLY

My mother's kind of an artist, so -

HARRISON

You come from a creative family, do

you?

MATHILDA

I wish my boys would talk to me about

my passions. I can't get them anywhere

near the subject of my garden.

KELLY

I noticed your magnolias. Very fine

specimens.

MATHILDA

They are fine, aren't they?

BART

(ironic)

Is there nothing you can't discuss?

HARRISON

Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks.

Minnie has a way with the white sauce.

BART

My dad has this friend who's a

director. He's shooting a documentary

for the History Channel.

KELLY

Cool.

BART

He needs some guys to do a reenactment

of some European theater battles for

him.

KELLY

We're going to be on the History

Channel?

BART

I haven't asked you yet.

KELLY

Oh, come on.

BART

Well, if you want to. Next weekend.

But you have to take it seriously.

KELLY

What do you mean? Of course I will.

BART

From what I've seen, you play fast

and loose with your characterizations.

This has got to be straight up.

KELLY

I'm not "fast and loose." I play the

emotional truth. I make it real.

BART

Like back in the dining room?

KELLY

What does that have to do with it?

BART

(mimics)

"I noticed your magnolias. Very fine

specimens." That was real?

KELLY

What is this about?

BART

(shrugs)

You just seem to have your own agenda,

that's all.

KELLY

My own agenda? What other reason is

there to do anything?

BART

I'm just saying. I know the difference

between fantasy and reality.

KELLY

Are you saying I don't?

BART

I don't know.

BART

Why didn't you tell me your dad was

a burn-out?

KELLY

Why do you steal from yours?

PRINCIPAL

Kelly! I told some of your teachers

about your presentation. We're all

really looking forward to it.

SARAH

What presentation?

KELLY

I don't want to talk about it. As a

matter of fact, do me a favor and

pretend you never heard anything

about it.

SARAH

Okay. Um.

KELLY

What, Sarah?

SARAH

It's nothing. I -

SARAH

I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith

this weekend.

KELLY

Aw Sarah, that's really great, I

mean. It's just that - I'm busy.

SARAH

Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see

you in the dairy section, though.

KELLY

Right.

KELLY

What are you doing here?

BART

I tracked you down. There's someone

I'd like you to meet.

CHARLIE

(to Kelly)

Are you one too?

KELLY

Yup.

CHARLIE

And what do you see in that?

KELLY

Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery

- the big stuff. Things we don't

have anymore.

CHARLIE

I see.

CHARLIE

And do you think it's brave getting

trench foot and syphilis, eating

another ration of spoiled frank and

beans out of a dented can?

KELLY

Well, no -

CHARLIE

Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun,

would it?

KELLY

No, sir.

CHARLIE

Parts of it were kind of fun though.

I got separated from my platoon and

lived for two weeks in the forest of

the Ardennes living off what I could

kill.

(pause)

I felt very close to the land.

BART

I met him when my mom made me go

around caroling with the Youth Group.

KELLY

You don't really believe that stuff

about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?

BART

Does it matter?

KELLY

Of course it matters. Doesn't the

truth matter?

BART

I don't know. You tell me.

KELLY

I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple

bucks.

BART

I told you not to play him for money.

KELLY

I was trying to be nice. He's your

friend.

BART

Exactly. You should know better.

What do you want.

KELLY

Mountain Dew -

KELLY

-- Oh shit.

EVE

Kelly!

BART

That woman's calling you.

KELLY

(low)

Bart. Meet my mom.

EVE

What a nice surprise. It's so nice

to finally meet you.

BART

Likewise. So, doing a little business?

EVE

A little is right. But I work it as

much as I can.

EVE

So, what have you boys been up to?

KELLY

Bart took me to meet his friend

Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.

EVE

Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?

KELLY

You don't know him.

EVE

You boys should swing by Care House.

There are some Vets there.

KELLY

We can't.

EVE

Oh. Well - okay.

EVE

I should go. But you boys should

come over to our house some time.

(to Bart)

I know your family must get tired of

him.

BART

Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.

KELLY

There you go. Now you know everything.

BART

What's your problem? She's pretty

cute.

BART

Don't you want your soda?

KELLY

Forget it.

BART

So filming's on Saturday. Can you

make it?

KELLY

Are you kidding?

BART

Good. It's gonna be really cool.

He's got an explosives expert coming.

BART

What's up?

KELLY

Remember that stupid speech?

KELLY

I'm supposed to give it next week.

BART

Maybe you should talk to my dad about

it.

KELLY

You think he'd go for that?

BART

Of course. He loves you. He was

talking the other day about helping

you out.

(ironic)

Want to go to Dartmouth?

KELLY

Are you serious?

BART

He was. If you applied for Spring

Semester, he could "pull some

strings."

KELLY

(shakes his head slowly)

I don't think that would work for

me. Considering -- my background.

BART

Yeah, probably not.

KELLY

I'm not properly socialized. I

wouldn't fit in.

BART

That's bullshit.

KELLY

No, it's not.

BART

Tell that to my family. They're like

your fucking fan club.

BART

Even Tabby likes you.

KELLY

So much she ratted me out to you.

BART

Well, she's inviting you to the

wedding.

KELLY

Oh.

BART

But you probably won't enjoy that

much, will you?

KELLY

I don't know what you're talking

about. Weddings? I love weddings. I

always get drunk and make out with

someone's cousin.

BART

Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher

and tell him to expect a little

action.

KELLY

Fletcher, eh?

BART

He's twelve. Let me give some advice.

He's very into sharks at the moment.

KELLY

Why did you tell --

KELLY

What? Oh, I'm sorry.

TABBY

Miner and I broke up.

KELLY

I'm sorry.

TABBY

Yeah.

KELLY

Honestly? I didn't think you two

were right for each other.

TABBY

You did, huh?

KELLY

Like this painting. Stare at it too

long and you can't see it anymore.

But if someone else sees it for the

first time, they can tell exactly

what it is.

TABBY

I don't need any more bullshit right

now.

KELLY

He could never understand you.

TABBY

I'm not as complicated as you think.

KELLY

I never said you were complicated.

TABBY

Oh.

KELLY

He just wasn't the right one.

TABBY

There's more to it than that.

KELLY

I'm really sorry. I really am.

TABBY

Thanks.

KELLY

Don't cry.

TABBY

You like me, don't you?

KELLY

Of course.

TABBY

No, I mean -- you like me.

KELLY

Yeah. I think you're amazing.

TABBY

Well, do something.

BART

(O.S.)

All right, all right. I'm going.

KELLY

Damn it. Damn it.

KELLY

What?

MATHILDA

Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly

coming over?

BART

Not tonight, ma.

MATHILDA

Okay, then.

DIRECTOR

Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?

KELLY

Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual

division. Technically, my patches

indicate -

DIRECTOR

Whatever. Make yourself comfortable.

We'll be a while setting up. Some of

the other boys are over by craft

service.

KELLY

Oh?

DIRECTOR

The snack table. It's over there.

Someone will come get you when we're

ready.

KELLY

Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?

DIRECTOR

Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't

know.

KELLY

Ok. Thanks.

MAKEUP ARTIST

(to Kelly)

And you are?

KELLY

Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.

MAKEUP ARTIST

All right, Kelly. Let's take a look

at you.

MAKEUP ARTIST

That's it, handsome.

A.D.

Okay, everyone. We're going to start

positioning. Then we'll go through a

few rehearsals.

(points at soldiers)

You, you and you - go over there by

that tree. You and you guys, behind

the hill.

(looks at clipboard)

Okay, who's got the Jeep?

KELLY

That MG? She's mine.

A.D.

Great. We'd like to use it. Can you

drive it beyond the hill over there?

KELLY

Sure. I don't think that would be a

problem.

KELLY

Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he

checked in?

A.D.

Don't know. We've got enough people.

It doesn't matter.

KELLY

(to Jeep)

Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to

be famous.

A.D.

(yells)

Okay people. Listen to my voice.

From now on, you do whatever this

voice says. Take your place.

KELLY

Password.

KELLY

Hey! Where the hell have you been?

BART

No where.

KELLY

They put you over here with me? That's

great. I think we'll get some close-

ups. They want me to drive old Lippy.

Isn't that awesome?

KELLY

What the hell's your problem?

BART

I ought to fucking kill you.

KELLY

What?

BART

You had to do it.

KELLY

What are you talking about?

BART

You just do whatever the fuck you

want. And consequences don't matter,

do they?

KELLY

Are you out of your mind?

BART

What the fuck do you think she's

going to do, run off with you?

BART

You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy.

She's a Yale grad student. Talk about

living in a fucking fantasy world.

KELLY

No. You'd rather have me be miserable

like you are.

BART

(biting sarcasm)

Once again, you've displayed your

uncanny ability to nail the truth of

a character.

KELLY

Stop talking out your dad's mouth

and use your own for once.

A.D.

Standby for rehearsal. Cue the

explosion.

A.D.

Cue the Jeep.

A.D.

Cue the Jeep. Cue the fucking Jeep!

A.D.

What the H. Christ is going on over

here?

A.D.

(to cameraman)

Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you

getting this?

A.D.

(to cameraman)

Follow him. Are you getting it?

A.D.

We can use this. We'll cut it

together.

A.D.

Get close on him.

KELLY

I don't want to talk about it.

EVE

Well, you're going to have to. Your

father's at the hospital.

KELLY

Which one of his loser friends ended

up there?

EVE

They think he has stomach cancer.

KELLY

Oh this is just perfect.

EVE

Why would you say something like

that?

KELLY

Because it seems to fit.

EVE

"Seems to fit." Do you understand

what I just said?

KELLY

Why, do you want to say it again?

EVE

Kelly -

KELLY

I have to go to work.

SARAH

I forgot to tell you this box was

booby-trapped.

SARAH

The concert was lame. The opening

act singer ripped his leather pants

during a stupid dance routine and

stormed off stage.

(pause, looks at his

cut)

Are you okay?

KELLY

No.

SARAH

Lance?

KELLY

No.

KELLY

Listen, I'm busy.

SARAH

Sure. I understand.

KELLY

I doubt it.

SARAH

Um, I don't have a perfect life, if

that's what you're asking.

KELLY

No, Sarah, actually, I'm not asking.

I never ask you anything but you

just talk anyway. Have you ever

noticed that?

SARAH

Fuck you.

KELLY

Hey, I hoped you were up -

TABBY

Kelly?

KELLY

I just came to get this.

TABBY

Hey.

KELLY

I guess the wedding's back on.

TABBY

We talked.

TABBY

I'm really sorry.

KELLY

Don't be.

KELLY

My dad's got cancer.

TABBY

Oh, Kelly.

KELLY

I guess we all get what we deserve.

KELLY

Stupid bitch.

MR. NORMAN

Kelly! There you are. I was just

telling the class about our special

treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going

to be giving the three first-period

history classes a little talk about

the Civil War.

MR. NORMAN

Let's all make our way in an orderly

fashion down to the auditorium, shall

we?

MR. NORMAN

Orderly, I said orderly.

MR. NORMAN

Well, what are we waiting for? I'm

so looking forward to hearing your

views.

HOLMSTEAD

For those of you who haven't had the

chance to get to know Kelly, you

should know he has a very interesting

hobby. He takes part in reenactments

of World War II battles right here

in Ohio.

AUDIENCE KID

I did that too. When I was seven.

HOLMSTEAD

He has an unusual first-hand knowledge

of history. We recently discovered

that this extends beyond World War

II to the Civil War, which he is

going to discuss with you today.

Kelly?

KELLY

I'm sorry.

HOLMSTEAD

(to Mr. Norman)

Well, go after him.

LANCE

What, they re-assign you to the

bicycle brigade?

KELLY

I'm busy.

LANCE

Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember

that little show I put on for the

school?

KELLY

I don't know what you're talking

about.

LANCE

Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard

on?

KELLY

Oh that. I heard about it.

LANCE

And did you hear me and Bridget aren't

going out anymore because of it?

KELLY

I haven't been following the story.

LANCE

Yeah well, let's get this over with.

KELLY

It is over.

KELLY

Just let me go home.

LANCE

Did you call me a homo?

KELLY

This isn't a good time for me. Let's

re-schedule.

LANCE

No time like the present.

KELLY

First you should probably get me to

write home to my mother.

MR. NORMAN

Stop it!

LANCE

Get off me.

MINNIE

Bart's not here. Sorry.

EVE

Oh Kelly. What happened?

KELLY

Nothing.

EVE

Jesus. Let me see that.

KELLY

Ow.

EVE

I'm going over to see dad.

KELLY

Oh.

EVE

And you need to come.

KELLY

I don't want to.

EVE

At this point that's not an option.

KELLY

Now's not a good time, ma.

EVE

It's never a good time.

KELLY

You can't make me.

EVE

(voice rising)

It's not about you anymore --

KELLY

Don't you get it? It was never about

me.

EVE

(yelling)

What is wrong with you? When are you

going to stop blaming us, blaming

him? I'm sick of you being angry. I

want to be angry! They just took out

half of your father's stomach -

KELLY

Enough.

EVE

(screaming and crying)

You will not tell me what's enough.

You don't know about anything. All

you do is fight fake battles, in the

woods, on the playground. But this,

right here, us - this is the real

one, the only one worth anything.

EVE

The man I love is dying.

KELLY

That's between you and him.

EVE

If I made a mistake, if you felt

left out, I'm sorry. But I can only

deal with one thing at a time.

HARRISON

Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters

next to me if you can help it.

(to guest)

Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank

you for coming.

HARRISON

(to Bart)

Where's the priest?

BART

He should be here any minute. Calm

down.

BART

What the fuck are you doing?

KELLY

I was invited.

BART

I uninvited you.

KELLY

It's not your wedding.

BART

Why are you wearing that?

BART

(softening)

I can't let you come in.

KELLY

Why?

BART

Because you know why. Just go home.

KELLY

She looks beautiful. Tell her - give

her my congratulations.

XIOU-XIOU

Oh! Son of Eve. You startled me.

KELLY

Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?

XIOU-XIOU

Your mom made it for you. I can fix

it.

KELLY

Did you come here to work on your

own stuff? Don't waste your time on

this.

XIOU-XIOU

I never waste time.

XIOU-XIOU

See. Everything can be mended.

KELLY

You're trying to tell me something,

aren't you?

XIOU-XIOU

Oh no. I could not tell you anything.

ABE

Hey. Kelly.

KELLY

Hey dad. How you feeling?

ABE

Not bad.

KELLY

They gave me some stitches downstairs.

(points to eyebrow)

Three.

ABE

Did you get punched?

KELLY

A couple times, actually.

ABE

I know the feeling. Come on in and

watch some television. Don't worry,

this one's bolted to the wall. As

you can see, my reputation precedes

me.

ABE

Any battles this weekend?

KELLY

A few.

ABE

Busy, busy.

ABE

Answer me this: how come no one ever

reenacts the Vietnam War?

KELLY

It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't

it?

ABE

I guess it would.

KELLY

Plus that, you'd have to have

protesters and stuff.

ABE

Folks dressed up like your mom and

me. People reenacting fleeing to

Canada, burning draft cards. I guess

that would ruin the spirit of the

thing, now wouldn't it?

KELLY

I could make it work.

ABE

I bet you could.

EVE

Kelly, is that you?

KELLY

You were expecting some one else?

KELLY

He looks good.

EVE

He looks just like you.

BART

Hey.

KELLY

Hey. You going away already?

BART

Yeah. The have this intensive summer

orientation thing.

KELLY

Is that good?

BART

Well, it's optional, but dad thinks

it would be "a good way to meet

people."

KELLY

He's probably right.

BART

He usually is.

KELLY

Well, go Big Green.

BART

Thanks.

KELLY

Have fun. And get laid, will ya?

HARRISON

Is that everything?

BART

Everything you'd let me bring.

HARRISON

Give me a break.

KELLY

Hey.

SARAH

Hey.

KELLY

How come you don't work here anymore?

The Electro-shopper's getting rusty.

SARAH

I've got a summer internship at an

ad agency.

KELLY

Fancy.

SARAH

It's all right, I guess.

KELLY

No, it's great.

KELLY

Hey -

SARAH

When are you going to get a real

job?

KELLY

I don't know. Probably when I figure

out something better to do.

SARAH

You can't be a stock boy your whole

life.

KELLY

Yeah I can. I mean, I probably won't,

but I could.

SARAH

Well, it was good seeing you.

KELLY

Um.

SARAH

What?

KELLY

Remember that presentation I told

you never to ask me about again?

KELLY

Lee arrayed his defenses over here.

Only this time, Grant was ready for

him.

OLD SOLDIER 1

(to old soldier 2)

This is boring.

OLD SOLDIER 2

Yeah. Let's see that slide of the

wife again.

MR. NORMAN

(to Charlie)

Remarkable, remarkable. And they

never knew?

CHARLIE

The real kicker was moving those

cutouts of tanks around. The thought

we had a whole regiment over there,

but it was just a couple of us and

those Hollywood props.

EVE

That's amazing. Art playing a part

in war.

CHARLIE

You're damned right. We practically

won the thing right there.

(eyeing Sarah and Eve

with approval)

Now this is more like it. Anyone

care to place a wager on the table?

SARAH

If you think it would be more fun.

MR. NORMAN

I can't imagine having more fun that

I am now.

CHARLIE

You're never been to a French

whorehouse, I take it.

EVE

I have.

MR. NORMAN

Oh, my.

KELLY

I still don't understand how you did

that.

SARAH

I spent my summers with my grandma

in the Catskills. She didn't give me

any spending money.

(shrugs)

So I played the bones for ice cream.

KELLY

Hot damn.

FADE OUT:

THE END
