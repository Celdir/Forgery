WHITE CHRISTMAS

"WHITE CHRISTMAS"

by

Melvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama

GENERAL CARLTON

(To Adjutant)

What's this all about, Colonel?

ADJUTANT

(Turning)

A little entertainment for the men,

sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve.

GENERAL CARLTON

These men are moving up tonight.

They should be lined up for full

inspection!

GENERAL WAVERLY

(Eyeing him)

You're absolutely right.

(To Adjutant)

There's no Christmas in the Army,

Colonel.

ADJUTANT

Yes, sir.

GENERAL WAVERLY

(To Carlton)

There's always a slip-up or two during

a change in command.  The men get a

little loose.  But I know I'm leaving

them in good hands.

GENERAL CARLTON

(Stiffly)

Thank you.

(To Driver)

Sergeant, take me to headquarters

immediately!  We'll have those men

turned out on the double!

GENERAL WAVERLY

Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short

cut.

SERGEANT

Yes, sir!

ADJUTANT

That's not the way to headquarters!

GENERAL WAVERLY

Joe, you know that, and I know that,

but the new General doesn't know it.

Or he won't for about an hour and a

half.

ADJUTANT

That Sergeant'll be a private

tomorrow!

GENERAL WAVERLY

Yes... isn't he lucky?

CUT TO:

BOB

Thanks, fellows.  I guess by now you

know the Old Man's being replaced by

a new Commanding General fresh out

of the Pentagon... this divisions's

been awfully lucky so far, but tonight

they're running a special on St.

Christophers at the PX... The Old

Man's heading back to the rear -

he's never moved in that direction

in his life.  All I can say is, we

owe so much to General Waverly and

the way --

WAVERLY'S VOICE

(A bellow)

ATTENTION!

GENERAL WAVERLY

Captain Wallace, button your shirt.

You're out of uniform!

(Bob, grinning, hastily

buttons his shirt)

This division is now under the command

of General Harold G. Carlton, and I

don't want anyone to forget it --

not that he'll let you.  He's tough --

just what this sloppy outfit needs.

You'll be standing inspection night

and day -- you may even learn how to

march.  And if you don't give him

everything you got, I may come back

and fight for the enemy.  Merry

Christmas!

GENERAL WAVERLY

(Embarrassed)

Well -- I guess that's about it - uh -

uh --

BOB

Perhaps I can help you out, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

COOKE

(To Bob and Phil)

New York's on the telephone.

PHIL

(Into phone)

Hello.

(He listens.  To Bob

and Cooke)

Oscar.

OSCAR

Listen, I just heard what you're

doing -- giving the cast a week off

with pay for Christmas.  You don't

know how touched I am.  I'm all choked

up.  Between sobs, I managed to book

you on the Ed Harrison show this

week to take up the slack.  It'll be

stealing money.

PHIL

(Into phone)

We'll have to go to New York -- four

days and four nights of rehearsals --

that's stealing money?

OSCAR

It is for me  -- I get ten percent.

(He listens for a

moment)

Next time you guys make a charitable

gesture, find out if you got with

what to make it.  See you Wednesday.

BOB

Well... while the cast takes it easy

we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie.

COOKE

What train do you want?  There's a

one-thirty this morning but you have

to sit up all night.

PHIL

Let's get out tonight.

BOB

Okay.

PHIL

What are we going to do until one-

thirty?

BOB

We'll eat dinner.

PHIL

(Looking at the

retreating bouncing)

Eat, eat  All you think of is your

stomach!

RITA

(Eagerly)

You said you had something to rehearse

with me after the show.  What is it?

PHIL

It's a kind of new dance number.

RITA

(Eagerly)

I'm ready.

BOB

(Taking Phil by the

arm)

He isn't.  Some business has come

up.  See you in a week.

(He pulls Phil away)

Come on, Romeo, dinner!

(Tempting him)

Lamb chops, lamb chops!

PHIL

(Pretending that he

is letting himself

be pulled while he

is still anxious to

go in the other

direction)

I'm looking at them!  We're going in

the wrong direction.

DISSOLVE TO:

BETTY

(Checking the tickets)

We'll have to rush to get the 1:30

train.

BOB

Have you ever considered laying off

the female sex for awhile?

PHIL

What other kind is there?

(He picks up the card

which announces the

performers names and

reads)

'The Stewart Sisters.'  Sister act!

(He smacks his lips.

He doesn't realize

that these two girls

are the Stewart

Sisters)

BOB

Down, Rover, down.  Remember, we

have an agreement--you chase no new

tidbits during the season.  You were

man enough to give me your hand on

it.

PHIL

You were sneaky enough to take it.

BETTY

(Quietly)

Ahem.

(Judy's eyes are toward

Phil.  A little louder)

Ahem!  All right dear, relax.

JUDY

He's awful cute.

BETTY

So was the one in Kansas City, and

the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one

in Waco, Texas.

JUDY

(Mock seriousness)

Canton, Ohio wasn't so much.

BETTY

One of these days you're going to

meet somebody extra cute and the

next performance I'll be doing a

single.

JUDY

(Sincerely)

Nobody'll ever be cute enough to

break up this sister act.

PHIL

I haven't much luck with sister acts.

They're all alike.  Shall I tell you

what these two are like?

BOB

Shoot.

PHIL

Four feet two inches tall.  Pudgy.

Round races.  Have big bows in their

hair.  Always smiling.

(He parodies a smile)

Lots of teeth.  Sister acts have

more teeth than anybody else.  Two,

three hundred teeth at a time.  The

American Dental Association is

investigating it.

BANDLEADER

Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart

Sisters!

PHIL

Say, Dolores!  That's Dolores!

BOB

Who?

PHIL

Remember that girl I told you about

who got sick in St. Paul?  That's

her!  The girl in the oxygen tent!

I told you about her!  The road

company of "Student Prince."  The

whole company went to church and

prayed for her!  It was the most

touching thing I've ever seen in

show business.

(HE GETS UP.)

I'll bring her over.

NOVELLO

Didn't you get your dessert yet, Mr.

Wallace?

BOB

I'm not having any, but I think my

partner's lining up some pastries

now.

NOVELLO

Sure wish I could afford to book you

boys here.

BOB

Call our agent - we've got half an

hour between trains.

PHIL

Hello, Mister Novello.

NOVELLO

Good evening, Mister Davis.

PHIL

(Burlesque formality)

Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace.

Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace.

JUDY AND BETTY

How do you do.

BOB

(Rising)

How do you do.

NOVELLO

See you later, folks.

PHIL

'Bye.

(He leaves)

JUDY

We saw your show at the matinee, and

we liked it very much.

BOB

Thank you, ma'am.

PHIL

Where are you going to be for

Christmas?

JUDY

We're booked in Vermont.

PHIL

Vermont?  What's there?

BETTY

Snow.  We spent last Christmas in

South Carolina, the year before in

Hawaii.  They didn't seem like

Christmases.  There ought to be snow.

This one's going to be real white.

BOB

Well, it's the way you've been raised.

If you saw a lot of snow when you

were a kid you miss it more around

Christmas. There's a lot of snow

around St. Paul.

JUDY

Is that where you come from - St.

Paul?

BOB

No.  You come from St. Paul.

JUDY

I come from Canton, Ohio.

BOB

(Just for the record

he knows)

I'd like to ask you something.  Were

you ever in an oxygen tent?

JUDY

Oxygen tent?  Oh no!

BOB

Were you ever in a road company of

"Student Prince?"

BETTY

No.  Why?

BOB

Very good.

PHIL

Thank you.

BOB

What I admire are the details, the

invention, the little lies all around

the big one.  It takes talent.

PHIL

Oh, it's nothing.

BOB

Don't say that.  Don't belittle

yourself.  Credit where credit is

due.  You did it fine.

BETTY

Private conversation?

BOB

Little game we play.

PHIL

(To Judy)

May I have this dance?

JUDY

I'd love to.

PHIL

(Helping her up)

I'm not going to keep calling you

Miss Stewart.

JUDY

The name is Judy.

PHIL

(To Bob)

What a pretty name!

BOB

(They're off)

Nicer than Dolores!

BETTY

I'm Betty.

BOB

I'm low man. Bob.

(He takes her arm,

indicating Phil and

Judy)

Follow that couple.

BETTY

Why?

BOB

Want to make sure they keep dancing.

BETTY

Stop worrying.  He won't get any

place with her.

BOB

You sure?

BETTY

I'm positive.  I trained her myself.

BOB

She's in the ring with the champ,

though.  You've heard of Alcoholics

Anonymous?

(She nods; he indicates

Phil)

Women Anonymous.  Their biggest case.

BETTY

Well, you keep an eye on him, and

I'll keep an eye on her.

BOB

Fine. We can make out the probation

report together.

JUDY

They're both very cute, aren't they?

BETTY

(Hiding her real

interest)

Both?

JUDY

Uh huh.

BETTY

Which one do you like best?

JUDY

I like them both.

BETTY

You can't have both.  There's a law.

JUDY

Oh, we'll never meet them again,

what does it matter?

BOB

Judy, you made even him look good.

JUDY

(Pleased)

You're very flattering, but he was

doing all the leading.

BETTY

(Fair)

You dance very well together.  If I

say it.

PHIL

(Sitting)

Lightest girl I ever saw.  Floats

like a bubble.  One big bubble.

BOB

All right, bubble lover, stand up!

PHIL

What for?  I just sat down.

BOB

La train.  At one-thirty, and we

have to pack.

PHIL

Train?

BOB

You know, choo choo.  Goes on tracks.

(Train whistle noise)

Wo woo.

PHIL

Oh no!

BOB

Oh yes!

PHIL

Can't we go tomorrow?

BOB

The train goes tonight.

(Phil looks

disconsolately at

Judy)

Say goodbye to the lady bubble,

because we're going to have to run

for it now.

PHIL

Lady bubble, I have an idea we're

going to meet up again sometime.

JUDY

We might, we're on the same train.

PHIL

No.

JUDY

Yes.

BOB

(Pulling Phil away)

No.

NOVELLO

The sheriff is here! He's in my

office!

JUDY

The sheriff!

NOVELLO

He's got a warrant to arrest you!

BOB

I thought we watched you every minute.

PHIL

Never stopped dancing.

BOB

(To the girls)

Can we help?

JUDY

(Fearful)

I've never been arrested!

PHIL

There's nothing to it!

BOB

Don't get panicky!

NOVELLO

Yes, don't get excited, you still

have to give your show!

(Apologetically)

He's not going to arrest them until

after the show!

BOB

That's considerate!  How'd you arrange

that?

NOVELLO

I'm a taxpayer here!  You better go

in and change, girls!  You haven't

much time!

BOB

May I enquire what you are being

arrested for?

BETTY

The owner of the hotel we were at

says we dropped a cigarette on his

rug and burned it.

JUDY

We couldn't have dropped a cigarette

because we don't smoke.

BETTY

He wants two hundred dollars, but

it's just plain stealing.

JUDY

We left the money for our bill in an

envelope on the bed.

BETTY

Then we dropped the bags out the

window and checked them at the depot.

JUDY

What are we going to do now?

NOVELLO

You have to give another show.

PHIL

The old burned rug routine.

BOB

Kind of old fashioned, isn't it?

I thought that went out with the

Cherry Sisters. We'll have to do

something.

PHIL

(Hopefully)

Got a flash?

BOB

A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a

little.

JUDY

We wouldn't want you boys to get

into any trouble.

PHIL

Why not?  Maybe we'll all wind up in

the same cell.

DISSOLVE TO:

LANDLORD

That's the second dessert you've

had, Sheriff!

SHERIFF

Real good, too.

LANDLORD

I haven't got all night to wait here

while you eat free food!  You've got

your warrant, arrest those girls!

SHERIFF

(Displeased)

Now, we agreed to let them finish

their show first.

LANDLORD

I didn't agree!

(To Novello)

That was his idea!

NOVELLO

I've got some rights, too.  You don't

get those girls until after they've

done their number!

LANDLORD

Well, how long is it going to take?

NOVELLO

Wait a minute! That's their music!

LANDLORD

They're clapping! It's over!  Arrest

them!

CUT TO:

BOB

Get out of these clothes! Toot sweet!

PHIL

Ma, unhook my bra!

SHERIFF

(Calm)

Just a second, folks!  I'll handle

this!

(He walks to the

dressing room door)

SHERIFF

(Winking)

You stay here.  Let them try to go

through the window.

LANDLORD

If they make a break for it, shoot

'em!

WIPE TO:

SHERIFF

Just a minute, Hank, couple of

customers coming up.

HANK

Okay, boss.

SHERIFF

Back you go, boys!

PHIL

Pete!

SHERIFF

Phil!  Bob!

BOB

Pete!

PHIL

(Unbelieving)

Are you the Sheriff here?

SHERIFF

You bet I am!

BOB

How'd you get in this line of work?

SHERIFF

After I got out of the army I sat

down and figured it out!  Who never

got in trouble in the army?  The

M.P.'s!  They were the ones who

arrested you!  So I came back here

and ran for Sheriff!

BOB

A civilian M.P.!  If the fellows

ever saw you now!  They'd skin you

alive!

PHIL

You ever see any of them?

SHERIFF

Whitey Harris and Jack Ross have a

filling station near here!

BOB

Jack Ross!  Will you ever forget the

party he threw in Naples?

PHIL

In a captured brewery.  Very sensible,

giving a party in a brewery.  Cuts

out the middleman.

BOB

Do you remember when Danny Beasly

climbed up -

(As he says 'Danny

Beasly' he recalls

Danny is dead)

- the tower of the City Hall and

rang the bell by swinging on the

clapper?  He couldn't hear anything

for two days.

SHERIFF

Danny Beasly!  Too bad he didn't

make it.

BOB

Not everybody was lucky.

PHIL

We were lucky in one thing - the old

man.

SHERIFF

You can say that again.  Say I'm

supposed to arrest a couple of dames!

A fellow swore out a warrant!

PHIL

He's a crook!  Burned a hole in a

rug and is trying to hold up two

kids.

SHERIFF

You don't say!

BOB

(At his watch)

We got to get our bags and be at the

station in ten minutes!  We'll never

make it!

SHERIFF

Just a moment!

(He goes to the window)

Hank !

HANK

Yes, sir.

SHERIFF

Take my friends where they want to

go!

HANK

Yes, sir.

SHERIFF

Hurry up!

BOB

(Going out the window)

Thanks, Pete.

PHIL

Do you think we can make it?

HANK

This thing goes over a hundred an

hour!  Hold on!

SHERIFF

They escaped!  We're pursuing 'em!

LANDLORD

Escaped!

SHERIFF

(Pointing)

What do you mean smoking on theatrical

premises!

LANDLORD

That's not mine!  I wasn't smoking!

SHERIFF

What's that burning?  A lollypop?

(He grabs him by the

shoulder, not too

gently, and starts

him out)

Come on!

WIPE TO:

JUDY

(Seriously)

You didn't steal the police car?

PHIL

No, no.  Friend of ours.

BOB

Well, we'll be together as far as

New York.

BETTY

Maybe it'll snow in New York for

Christmas.  If it doesn't, we'll

mail you a snowball from Vermont.

JUDY

I haven't been on ice skates in years.

PHIL

Ice?  You mean the stuff in a Scotch

and soda?

(Suddenly)

Bob, how about snow for Christmas?

BOB

You'll only thaw it out.

PHIL

Come on, Bob, we could have a great

week up in Vermont.

BOB

I see what you mean.  But Wednesday

we've got to be back in New York.

PHIL

All right -- so it's just for a couple

of days.  Don't you want me to enjoy

the winter sports?

BOB

You enjoy them all year round.

(He looks to Betty)

We won't get in your way, will we?

BETTY

As long as your friend doesn't try

to take my sister for a sleigh ride.

BOB

If he tries it, I'll smash his

flexible flyer.

(To Phil)

It's all set.

PHIL

(Really pleased)

The thing I like about you, Bob, is

you're not only kind and generous,

you're handsome.

BOB

We're going to have to sit up all

night.  Let's get some shut eye.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHIL

Are you sure this is the right

Vermont?

BOB

This isn't a southern Vermont?

JUDY

I don't understand it.

BETTY

There has to be snow!  This place is

advertised as America's Snow

Playground!

BOB

Well, if you say so.

(Gesturing to the

waiting Columbia Inn

bus driver)

Driver, your sleigh and reindeer.

DISSOLVE TO:

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

SUSAN

Mail, Martha.

MARTHA

(As she shuffles

through it)

What's the weather forecast down at

the Post Office?

SUSAN

Awful.  Fair and warmer.

MARTHA

If we don't get snow soon we can

turn this hotel into a haunted house.

We haven't had a guest for three

weeks.

SUSAN

(As Martha keeps

searching through

the mail)

What are you looking for?

MARTHA

(Not finding it)

Your grandfather's written Washington

asking if he can get back in active

service.  I think he wants to fly

jets.

SUSAN

I think he could do it.

MARTHA

He says older men have been called,

and besides, he misses the food.  I

tell you, Susan, he tried to make it

a casual letter, with little jokes,

but it came out just begging.

SUSAN

(Moved)

Oh, Martha!  What are we going to

do?

MARTHA

(Blowing her nose)

I don't know.  Don't let on we know

he's written.  He'll start in I'm

only his housekeeper and that I found

out through some chicanery or

something.

SUSAN

(Soothing her)

How did you find out?

MARTHA

Like any housekeeper --  I read the

carbon paper.

(She hands the mail

to Susan)

Bring him the mail.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTHA

(Happily)

Welcome to Columbia Inn.  How do you

do?

ALL

How do you do?

MARTHA

(Offering pen)

What kind of accommodations would

you like?  We can give you a fairly

wide choice--any room in the Inn,

including mine.

BETTY

We're not here as guests.  We're the

Stewart sisters.

MARTHA

(Disappointed)

Oh.

BOB

My friend and I are guests.  We've

come down for the snow.  Where are

you keeping it?

MARTHA

We take it in during the day!

BOB

(Looking around)

What are your rates here?

MARTHA

Make us an offer.

(To the girls)

I'm afraid we won't be able to use

you.  We'll pay you the half salary

for canceling.

JUDY

Oh, no!  Are things that bad?

MARTHA

We're using the ski-tow to hang the

wash on.

(To Bob)

You're not going to stay either, are

you?

BOB

(Shaking his head)

I'm afraid not, ma'am.

BOB

I'll tell Phil to leave the luggage -

(It hits him, he comes

to a stop, and then

to attention)

General Waverly!  Sir!

WAVERLY

(Easy, simple)

At ease!  How are you, Captain.

BOB

I'm fine, sir.

(But he looks around

questioningly,

bewildered)

WAVERLY

(Smiling)

We just try to keep the General part

quiet.

BOB

Why?

(Reminding himself)

Begging your pardon, sir.

WAVERLY

Well, to put it in one sentence,

people don't expect major generals

to carry firewood.

PHIL

Bob, I was thinking we ought to -

WAVERLY

At ease!

PHIL

Oh, sir!

(Horrified)

A janitor!

WAVERLY

Never thought I'd make it, he?

...Matter of fact, it's worse than

that.  I own this hotel.

MARTHA

He got it in a shrewd business move.

BETTY

(To Bob)

Was everybody in your outfit?  We

seem to run into them all over the

country.

BOB

The Draft Board didn't know when to

stop.

WAVERLY

If I start the introductions, can I

get to meet these young ladies?

(Indicating them)

My housekeeper, Miss Martha Allen,

my granddaughter, Susan Waverly.

BOB

I'm Bob Wallace -- this is Phil Davis --

BETTY

We're the Stewart sisters.

JUDY

Your floor show.

MARTHA

(To Waverly)

Don't worry -- I've already told

them we'd have to cancel.

WAVERLY

Why?  We have a floor, haven't we?

MARTHA

Last time I looked.  But who are

they going to sing to?

WAVERLY

Even if it's only to you and me, it

will be well worth it.  Besides,

there will be six inches of snow

tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow.

BETTY

(Happily)

Is that the weather forecast?

WAVERLY

No.  But if there was one thing I

learned in the army it was to be

positive -- especially when you don't

know what you're talking about. You'll

excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P.

PHIL AND BOB

Yes, sir!

WAVERLY

(To Betty and Judy)

And you two charming ladies, I want

you to know I'm looking forward to

your show this evening.  Whatever

your audience lacks in numbers, it

will make up for in enthusiasm --

(He glares at Martha)

or I'll know the reason why!

JUDY

(Utterly charmed)

Gee... no wonder we won the war!

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB

I think well stay a little longer

than we planned.

WAVERLY

Excellent.  I enjoyed it very much.

JUDY

Thank you.

MARTHA

It was nice, if you like music.

BETTY

(After a look that

the waitress is not

in a position to

hear)

Mister Waverly, we'd like to make

you a proposition.

WAVERLY

(Smiling)

Well, for heaven's sake!

BETTY

You've been very nice not canceling,

we'd like to make a gesture.  Until

it snows, and you have guests, we'll

take half salary.

MARTHA

(Appreciative)

That's really nice of you.

(She takes out pencil

and her order book)

Now let's get that in writing.

WAVERLY

(Pushing it aside)

Never heard of anything so ridiculous.

(Gets up)

Your next performance is tomorrow

night, after dinner.  Be here, or

I'll sue!

MARTHA

(Annoyed)

Light-Horse Harry.  Advance, advance,

never retreat!  He's advancing right

into bankruptcy.

PHIL

That's just the way he was in the

army.  Always thinking of the other

fellow.

BOB

We ate and then he ate.  We slept,

and then he slept.

PHIL

Then he woke up, and nobody slept

for the next forty-eight hours.

MARTHA

I happen to know he's sunk his life's

savings into this place.  I read the

carbon paper.

JUDY

Gee, I wish there were something we

could do to help.

BOB

Maybe there is.

PHIL

You got a flash?

BOB

A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a

bit.

PHIL

(To the girls)

Shhh!

(Indicating Bob,

tapping his forehead)

Ticking away madly.  Wheels within

wheels.  This is the brain that, in

darkest Italy, devised a formula to

make food out of K-Ration!  Shhhhhh!

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB

(Into phone)

Relax... I didn't ask you how much

it'll cost us...

(We hear an excited

high voice on the

phone)

Easy, easy, remember your blood

pressure... I don't care how much

it'll cost us... That's better...

Have everybody on the train first

thing in the morning.  The whole

Troupe, and the scenery, and the

costumes... You'll have to cancel us

off the Ed Harrison Show...  Oscar,

remember your blood pressure.

Incidentally, how much will this

cost?

(He hears some figure. -

It obviously is a

very large number)

Good night, Oscar.

(He hangs up)

There you are.

PHIL

Incidentally, how much will this

cost?

BOB

(Clears his throat)

We are coming out - even.

PHIL

You mean flat?

BOB

That's the same as even.

PHIL

Wheels within wheels.  It's nice how

you take care of the money for both

of us because you're older and so

level headed.  I wonder where I'd be

now if hadn't saved your life?

BOB

Do you want me to cancel the troupe

coming?

PHIL

(Getting off the desk)

No, no.  Let's go through the gesture.

If you had been on the Titanic when

it went down, you wouldn't've been

satisfied just to sink into the ocean.

(Gesturing)

You'd have done a swan dive into it.

With me on your back!

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTHA

I can't believe it!  You mean you

brought the whole show up here?

BOB

When you hired the Stewart sisters

you also hired a New York show.  It

was in the small print.

PHIL

And you can't get out of it.  We've

got lawyers.

SUSAN

I can't thank you enough, but I wonder

if Gramp'll let you do it?

PHIL

Why not?

MARTHA

His pride.  When he decides he's

going into bankruptcy he likes to

go.

BOB

Now just a second.  We're not doing

this for him!

PHIL

Oh no!  We're bringing the show down

here to rehearse!

BOB

The company's been getting a little

ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of

the hall.

PHIL

Of course we don't expect it free!

BOB

We'll pay a little, but not much. -

You see, the audience will be guinea-

pigs -- and for us, that's quite an

improvement.

SUSAN

I don't know what to say!

BOB

I hope this is not an indication of

advancing age, getting kissed out of

gratitude.

PHIL

You didn't expect a girl that pretty

to kiss you because she wanted to?

BOB

A body keeps hoping.

BETTY

(Sincerely)

That was the nicest thing I ever saw

anybody do.

BOB

It was still gratitude.

PHIL

(To Judy)

I'm his partner.  I'm entitled to

half the credit.

(Judy steps up to him

and just pecks him

on the cheek, then

joins her sister in

rehearsal)

She's not as grateful as her sister.

DISSOLVE TO:

WAVERLY

(Finally)

I'm not clear about some of it.

Explain it again.

PHIL

(Not too good a job)

Well, sir.  We have this show, and

we laid off for the holidays.  You

see, business was bad.

WAVERLY

I know about business being bad.

Go on.

PHIL

Yes sir.  Well, so we figured as

long as we had the opportunity we'd

do a little rehearsing.  Right here.

WAVERLY

Why here?

(There is a hint here

of the General)

Phil looks to Bob for help as they

move toward the lobby.

BOB

Well, sir, this nice empty room.

The minute we looked at it we said

it was ideal.  Didn't we?

PHIL

That's what we said.  Ideal.

BOB

And then we'll have an audience to

play to.  You see, sir, you need an

audience on which to try out your

new material.

WAVERLY

Where are you going to get the

audience?

PHIL

Oh, what guests there are in the

other hotels. They're pretty bored

here without snow, and a New York

show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.

WAVERLY

I would think so.

(He thinks)

How will they know you're here?

BOB

Oh, word gets around.

PHIL

Yes sir, and we also took the girls

twice around the town for a little

run.  They were stiff from the train.

In their practice clothes.

BOB

Makes the blood circulate,

WAVERLY

(Hers no dope)

Hmm.  Whose blood?

BOB AND PHIL

Yes sir.

WAVERLY

Apparently there must be a lot about

show business I don't understand.

PHIL

It'll come to you, sir.

BOB

It just takes time.

PHIL

We wouldn't be any good as generals.

WAVERLY

You weren't any good as privates!

PHIL

(Pointing to Bob)

He was an officer, sir.

WAVERLY

Only to confuse the enemy.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB

That's all for today, kids.

BOB

Get a little rest before tonight's

performance.

PHIL

(To Judy)

I'll walk you over.

BOB

Phil!

(He takes a sheet of

music out of his

inside pocket)

Look this over, I want to try

something.

PHIL

(To Judy)

See you later.

MARTHA

Guinea pig?

BOB

(Nodding)

That's the idea. Want you to hear a

song I just wrote.

MARTHA

If it's a love song, don't get too

close.

BOB

It isn't.  Just tell me how you think

the Old Man would feel about this

one.

MARTHA

(Very moved)

I think it's just wonderful --

SUSAN

I think so, too.

WAVERLY

I'm afraid I disagree. The song is

funny, but there is one thing wrong

with it.

PHIL'S VOICE

What's that, sir?

WAVERLY

It's true.  I'd rather you didn't.

BOB AND PHIL

Yes, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

FIRST OWNER

Great show, Waverly.

WAVERLY

Thank you.

SECOND OWNER

We needed something like this.  I

had six checkouts, and when they

heard about this they decided to

stay.

FIRST OWNER

Same here.

(Big smile)

Much obliged.

WAVERLY

Glad to help.

DISSOLVE TO:

JUDY

(Talkative)

The moon!   I can't get over the

moon up here.  The size of it!

BETTY

(In a quiet mood)

Same one they have all over.

JUDY

They'll never prove it to me.  And

everything smells so beautiful.

(She breathes)

What is it - pine or fir?

BETTY

(Small sniff)

We're near the bakery.

JUDY

(Friendly, not

realizing the stab)

You know your trouble, Betty?  You're

not romantic.

JUDY

Everything's so wonderful here, so

pretty, so exciting, I can't

understand how you stay frozen up.

Let yourself go, go, like me!

BETTY

(Afraid to ask)

Which one is it?

JUDY

What do you mean?

BETTY

Bob or Phil?

JUDY

Neither.

BETTY

You mean both.

JUDY

(Smiling)

It's the same.  No one is going to

break up our act.

BETTY

Isn't there one you prefer over the

other?

JUDY

The way Phil dances, and he's funny.

It's easy to see yourself married to

him.

BETTY

(An effort)

And Bob?

JUDY

He's different, deeper, and he's

funny, too.  It'd be nice to be

married to both of them.

BETTY

Good thing they're not a quartette.

JUDY

(Oblivious)

If I was Catherine the Great, that's

what I'd do.  Phil in the daytime,

Bob at night. Or should it be the

other way around?

JUDY

Phil'd be more fun in a night club,

but eventually a girl wants a pipe

and slipper fellow.  That's Bob,

smoking a pipe and petting a cocker

spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to

smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in

to suit you is something every girl

should go through.  I hear it's half

the fun.  Which one do you like

better?  Betty?

(No answer.)

Betty?

(Softer)

Are you asleep?

(No answer. Judy turns

over and closes her

eyes)

DISSOLVE TO:

BOB'S VOICE

Tuna fish, on the lower shelf.

BETTY

Oh!

BOB

What are you doing?  Sleep-walking?

BETTY

I couldn't sleep.

BOB

Little young for that, aren't you?

BOB

What shall I make you?

BETTY

Anything'll do.

BOB

If you tell me what you want to dream

about I'll know what to make you.

BETTY

(Amused)

How's that?

BOB

Different foods make for different

dreams.  I've got a whole theory

about it.  It's called "The Wallace

Way of Wishful Wooing."  You'll find

it in the American Medical Journal

under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese,

for instance, you get a cool, thin,

blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you

get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy

though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich -

(He shakes his head)

you get both girls at once.  Bad

night.

BETTY

What do you dream on tuna?

BOB

Darndest thing, I dream about me.

BETTY

(Evenly)

Then I'll have a tuna sandwich.

BOB

Now that's very flattering.  Tuna

coming up.

(He is occupied at

the frigidaire while

she watches him

yearningly)

Let me make you some warm milk.

That'll help the insomnia.

BETTY

(Meaningly)

No it won't.

(Looking straight at

his back)

Warm milk won't do it.

BOB

Whatever you've got on your mind

isn't worth staying awake for.

BETTY

I think it is.

BOB

Would you like to know how I handle

a situation like that...?

BETTY

Tell me, Doctor...

FADE OUT

PHIL

Don't make them too tight.  I wear

size 12.

BOB

All right kids!  Places!  Let's get

going! Phil, you're on!

BOB

(To Albert)

How long are we so far?

ALBERT

An hour and ten minutes.

BOB

Something has to come out.

BOB

All right, places for the next number!

(He turns to Sylvia)

You're next, Sylvia.

(Sylvia and Albert

exchange peculiar

glances,  Bob senses

it)

What's the trouble?

ALBERT

Mr. Wallace -

(He is embarrassed to

go on)

BOB

Come on, out with it.

ALBERT

I don't think Sylvia ought to go on,

unless you cut out the high kicks

and let her do some easy waltzes.

Very easy waltzes.

BOB

You're kidding!

SYLVIA

We don't want anyone else to know.

ALBERT

Please don't mention it.

(The orchestra starts

to play ROCKABYE

BABY.  Sylvia and

Albert are startled)

For heaven's sake!

SYLVIA

How did they know?

GIRLS

(Ad libbing)

You wouldn't tell us, would you?  We

had to find out ourselves, etc.

(Phil and Judy are

among the group)

MARTHA

(Formally)

There will be a celebration of the

forthcoming event tonight after the

show!

(Everyone approves)

PHIL

Obviously you're going to call the

boy after me!

BOB

After you?  I hired Sylvia!  The

baby'll be named after me!

PHIL

I've been dancing with her!  That's

more important!  The baby'll be named

after me!

BOB

The hiring was more important!  After

me!

PHIL

The dancing was more important!

After me!

ALBERT

I'm her husband.

(Small pause)

The baby'll be named after me.

BOB

Well, we're going to need another

dancer!

PHIL

How about Judy, she knows all the

routines, she could pick it up in no

time.

BOB

On the other hand, it's all right if

we lose a number, we're running too

long now.  We have to cut somewhere.

BETTY

Wouldn't it be better if you cut my

solo number?  I've never felt right

in it anyway.

(Indicating Phil)

The show needs every bit of his

dancing.

BOB

(Interpreting this as

mere selflessness

for love)

Well -

BETTY

There you are - painless.

BOB

Greater love hath no woman than to

give up a solo number.  Old Chinese

saying.

PHIL

(All this is beyond

him)

What are you talking about?

BOB

Drink your coffee.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHIL

(Referring to the

grip)

Don't you want me to breathe?

RITA

Not especially.

PHIL

What's gotten into you?

RITA

You were chasing me in Florida.

PHIL

And you were running.  What made you

stop?

RITA

You're interested in Judy, aren't

you?

PHIL

That's it, eh?  Unless it belongs to

someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch!

(Evidently Rita has

deliberately stepped

on his instep)

PHIL

What's the matter?

JUDY

Nothing is the matter.

PHIL

This isn't the way you dance.

JUDY

Some people dance closer than others.

PHIL

Yes, that's true.  I'm one of the

close ones.  That's my type.

PHIL

(Singing; looking at

Judy)

And once you've caught him, don't

ever let him go.

PHIL

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like

to make an announcement.

PHIL

It is my pleasure to identify the

man who has been doing the chasing.

I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway,

Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying

to say is, we're engaged.

BETTY

I hope you realize that you're getting

he most wonderful girl in the world.

BETTY

Darling, don't cry.

JUDY

(Turning to her)

I didn't know he was going to make

that announcement, I swear I didn't.

BETTY

I know you didn't.

JUDY

He had no right to do that.

BETTY

You do love him, don't you?

JUDY

That doesn't matter.

BETTY

Nothing else matters.

JUDY

We're not going to break up our act.

PHIL

I've been looking for you, Judy.

BETTY

Excuse me.

BOB

Don't take this too much to heart.

Phil is a great kid but constancy

isn't his long suit.

BETTY

I'm not the least bit worried.

(Phil and Judy enter

from the kitchen)

Frankly, this couldn't come at a

better time.  They want me to come

back to The Carousel again - I used

to sing there before Judy and I teamed

up - and I had to turn it down because

they can only use a single.

(Not too well)

So - this couldn't be more convenient.

You stay with the show and I'll go

back to The Carousel.

JUDY

When did you get this offer?

BETTY

Just today, as a matter of fact.  I

got a telegram.

JUDY

Why didn't you mention it before?

BETTY

I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

JUDY

Where is the telegram?

BETTY

I threw it away.  What is this, a

third degree?  You don't think I

made it up?

JUDY

Yes, I do.

WAVERLY

Well now, I wouldn't bet any large

sum of money on that, since I took

the message over the telephone, and

I had to deliver the telegram.

(To take the tension

off)

And she didn't tip me, either.

JUDY

Oh, Betty!

(She throws her arms

around her)

I'm sorry!  I misunderstood!

BETTY

Now, baby!  It's all right!

PHIL

Well, everything's fine now!

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

GENERAL

(Shouting over noise

of train)

Where are you going to be?

BETTY

The Carousel.

BETTY

(Whispering, during a

lull in the noise)

I sent them a telegram this morning.

BETTY

Take care of my little sister.

BOB

She can take care of herself.  Worry

about the menfolk.  Now don't forget

to write.

BETTY

I'll send you picture postcards.

WAVERLY

Must be interesting to be a woman.

BOB

The idea's never occurred to me,

sir.

WAVERLY

Well, think about it.

(Bob is thinking about

it)

Well?

BOB

Not interested!

WAVERLY

A man like you must be an expert on

women.

BOB

It's a little immodest to say so,

but I consider myself an authority

on the fair sex,  I've made a study

of the subject.  They're simple

creatures.

WAVERLY

They couldn't fool you?

BOB

I'm single.

WAVERLY

'Pride goeth before a fall.'

BOB

'Who knows his own strength is twice

armed.'

WAVERLY

It's always a pleasure to meet an

expert in any field.  Tell me, why

do you think Betty went to New York?

BOB

(Not willing to admit

it)

She has a job in The Carousel.

WAVERLY

Expert, you're wrong!  She went to

New York because she's so in love

with someone here she just couldn't

stand it.

BOB

Phil.

(A mixture of

resentment and

frustration)

I'm darned if I can figure out why.

WAVERLY

I thought you were an expert on women.

(To the horse)

Come on, Delilah!

DISSOLVE TO:

PHIL

(Fitting the action)

Good, Judy.

(During the dancing)

Now the same as the middle part.

PHIL

Betty get off all right?

BOB

(Slightly belligerent)

Certainly.

JUDY

Betty left something for you.  She

said to give it to you after she

left.  It's on the piano.

PHIL

What's the matter?

BOB

I don't get it.

PHIL

Don't get what?

BOB

I just don't see it.  You' re skinny,

you got a big nose, and you squint.

PHIL

Who?  Me?

BOB

Yes, you!  Nothing personal though.

PHIL

No, of course not.

BOB

I'm just trying to figure out what

anyone sees in you.

PHIL

Well, stop worrying about it.  When

I ask you for a date just turn me

down.  Come on, Judy.

DISSOLVE TO:

FIRST HOTEL OWNER

(Starting a new game)

How about it, Waverly, want to play?

WAVERLY

(Looking at him a

moment)

I'm too young for that sort of thing.

WAVERLY

Kind of warm for that kind of

exercise, isn't it?

BOB

(Trying to help)

It isn't very warm.

(He looks to the sky)

I think the weatherman's wrong about

his forecast.  Those look like snow

clouds to me.

WAVERLY

(Without looking up)

They're cumulus clouds, at an

elevation of seven thousand feet.

BOB

Yes, sir.

(Still trying)

Still, weather's a funny thing.

It could snow - overnight.

WAVERLY

(He thinks a moment)

I'll tell you something I haven't

told my family.  I'm going back in

the Army.

BOB

Really, sir? That's great news!

WAVERLY

Yes.  I miss the Army.

BOB

Where are you going to be sent, sir?

WAVERLY

Well, I'm not sure yet.  I've always

been a combat officer, but I got an

idea they're going to try and palm

off one of the training commands on

me.  They'd better not.  They just

better not.

(He's worked up now)

I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes

yet.

(He smiles)

Now nothing to the women folk about

this!

BOB

No, sir.

WAVERLY

Let's mosey over to the post office,

I'm expecting a letter any day.

BOB

(Remembering)

Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.

(He pulls the letter

out of his pocket)

That's what I came over to give you,

it slipped my mind.

WAVERLY

(Solemn)

This is the one.

(He opens it,  He

squints.  He looks

to Bob)

My glasses are in my room.  I'd like

to read it by myself, but I'm a little

anxious.

(He smiles at his own

predicament)

Read it, son.  Slowly.

BOB

(Reading)

Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old -

(He stops)

WAVERLY

(Pleased)

Skip that word.

BOB

Yes, sir.

(Continuing)

It certainly was a surprise hearing

from you.  Your amusing letter was

appreciated more than you imagine.

Of course you've got plenty of time

to be amusing, sitting on that porch,

rocking away, while we put in a full

day's work.  You always were a lucky

stiff, and I envy you.  A few years

more, I was saying to Emmy the other

evening, and I'm going to be able to

take it easy like old Tom.

WAVERLY

(Just repeats)

Old Tom.

BOB

Oh, well, some people have all the

luck.  Everyone in the family is

fine here.  Carol had the mumps,

which is no joke at eleven years of

age -

WAVERLY

The rest of the letter is about the

family.

(Bob looks at him,

and then glances at

the rest to see if

it is so)

He's telling me they have nothing

for me, we're not fooling each other.

(He holds has hand

out)

Thank you.

(Bob gives him his

letter.  There is a

pause.  An attempt

at being light)

Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to

pitch horseshoes.  Now could it?

BOB

(Trapped, unhappy for

him)

No sir.

(His nerve up)

Begging your pardon, sir, there's a

lot to be said for leisure.  You're

not used to it, you've always been

active, but in time -

WAVERLY

(Quietly)

Never kid a kidder.  Go on back to

the hotel.

BOB

Yes sir.

FADE OUT

PHIL

Judy thinks my eyes are soulful.  Do

you think my eyes are soulful?

BOB

One of them is.

PHIL

You have no poetry in you.  It's

about time you went in for girls,

too.  After all, you haven't many

years left for that sort of thing.

BOB

(Over above)

I'm the quiet type.  Little do you

know what's aged me.

PHIL

Wheels within wheels, eh?  Well,

live it up, Pops.  Eat, drink and be

merry -- is that why you're leaving

for New York?

BOB

I told you what I'm seein' Ed Harrison

about.  That's all.

PHIL

Business, business.  Glad to be rid

of you.  You're not in the girly

mood.

BOB

(Easily annoyed at

the moment)

What do you know about girls?  You

wouldn't know what to do with a girl

if she fell on you!

PHIL

Well, I'd know enough not to get up.

MARTHA

Mr. Wallace -- gonna miss your train!

PHIL

For her I'd get up.

BOB

I'm expecting Ed Harrison.

MAITRE D'

Very well, Mr. Wallace.

BETTY

(Stopping him, sotto)

Let's not do the new number.

LEADER

What?

BETTY

Play "Blue Skies" -- anything.

LEADER

Relax.  Just do it the way you sang

it this afternoon -- you'll be great.

BETTY

(As Bob holds the

chair)

Well, surprise.  What brought you to

the big city?  And don't say 'a

train.'

(Forced gaiety, hiding

her tension)

BOB

I never heard you sing that well.

That's a good number for you.

BETTY

(Her own significance)

Some numbers suit you better than

others.  What are you doing here?

BOB

Business, business.  Meeting a fellow

here.

BETTY

Judy all right?

BOB

She's fine.  Couldn't be better.

(Carefully)

Playing footsie with Phil.

BETTY

That's nice.

BOB

I think they like each other.

BETTY

I do, too.

BOB

(Eyeing her)

They're kind of suited, in a lot of

ways.

BETTY

Some people are.

BOB

Thanks for the knitted sock.

BETTY

Don't mention it.

BOB

I thought it was for Phil.

BETTY

(Evenly)

If the sock fits, wear it.

BOB

(Unsure of her meaning)

It started out for Phil.

BETTY

It just started out as a sock.

BOB

You're a very odd girl.

BETTY

You're a very odd fellow.

BOB

Two feet, one sock.  I must be.

BETTY

I'll get around to the other one,

eventually.

BOB

You mean to do any knitting in the

near future?

BETTY

The feeling comes and goes.

BOB

Think if the model hung around for a

while... the feeling might be more

permanent?

BETTY

Maybe.

BOB

What's this maybe, shmaybe, comes

and goes?  Friends tell me I don't

have many years left for this sort

of thing...  I ought to know right

now if --

ED

Bob!  How are you?

BOB

Hiya, Ed.

ED

(He knows Betty)

Betty.

ED

(To Bob)

Now what's this big deal you wanted

to discuss?  I shouldn't even talk

to you after canceling out on my

show.

BOB

(Carefully)

Ed, I saw the old man.

ED

Waverly?  Where, in the Pentagon?

BOB

Pentagon, nothing.  He owns a little

hotel in a winter resort in Vermont.

ED

Our old man?

BOB

Nobody even knows who he is.

BETTY

He's too proud to let them know he's

General Waverly.

ED

(To Bob, indicating

Betty)

Was she in our outfit, too?

BOB

Vermont branch.

ED

What are we going to do about it?

You got a flash?

BOB

A glimmer.

ED

Got to stir it around a little?

BOB

All stirred.  Remember how Old

Flintbottom always used to find a

way to keep our morale up... without

telling us?  It's about time we

returned the favor.  Let's surprise

him with a real big bang-up reunion.

ED

Now you're talking!  How do we spread

the word?

BOB

You're gonna read this little speech

on your television show.  People

look at it, don't they?

ED

(Scanning the paper)

Now's as good a time as any to find

out.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHIL

Bob, just leave it to me!  He won't

get near a set if I have to break a

leg... Goodbye, Bob!

PHIL

(Excitedly)

Now everybody pay close attention.

DISSOLVE TO:

ED

I hope Phil has been able to keep

the old man away from a television

set.

BOB

He has.  In anything involving

something crooked he's dependable.

WAVERLY

Ed Harrison will be on in a half

minute.  I like him.  I never miss

him.

PHIL

Ow!  Ow!  Ow!

WAVERLY

(Jumping up)

What's that?

PHIL

My leg is broken!  Ow, ow!

WAVERLY

Take it easy, boy.

(He starts feeling

his leg)

PHIL

Ow! Ow! It's broken!

WAVERLY

No it isn't!  You may have a bad

sprain, but no bones are busted!

PHIL

It's broken, sir.  I can feel it.

WAVERLY

Let me help you.

ED

I would like to address all former

officers, enlisted men, Wacs and

nurses who were under the command of

General Tom Waverly --

PHIL

Ow!  Ow! It's broken in two or three

places!

WAVERLY

That's just the impression you have!

I tell you it's only shock!

WAVERLY

(Laying him out)

Take it easy, boy!

PHIL

Don't leave me!  Everything is going

round and round!

WAVERLY

Nobody's leaving you!  Martha, get

me a cold towel!

ED

The objective is Pine Tree, Vermont ---

Synchronize watches for Operation

Waverly...

WAVERLY

Things still going around?

PHIL

Now they're going sideways!

PHIL

Now they're going in and out!

WAVERLY

This'll bring him out of it.

Where am I?

WAVERLY

He's all right.

BOB

There's nothing to cry about, is

there?

SUSAN

(Through the crying)

Thank you so much.

BOB

Can't you do something?

BETTY

They're just affected by the gesture.

BOB

That's fine.

Probably in their rooms, crying.

Who is it?  General Waverly?

BOB

The lovers.

BETTY

(To Bob)

We can't just stand here.  We have

to get some sleep.

JUDY

We were rehearsing for the show

tomorrow night.

BETTY

Is it going to be that kind of a

show?  We'll be raided!

JUDY

What are you doing here?  What

happened at The Carousel?

BETTY

I'm helping out here tomorrow.

PHIL

Hi, Bob. Everything's under control.

(Fluster)

I mean with the show. We've got a

lot of new material.  You both are

going to have to do a lot of

rehearsing.

(Flustered again)

I mean the other kind of rehearsing -

I mean - rehearsing  Well, good night,

Judy.

JUDY

Good night, Phil.  Good night, Bob.

BETTY

(To both)

Good night.

PHIL

Let's get out of here before the

gossip starts.

DISSOLVE TO:

BETTY

Bob is still pacing up and down on

the porch... I think I'll go out and

see what's bothering him.

JUDY

That's how I started in Canton, Ohio.

BETTY

This is Vermont.  Nothing can happen

here.

JUDY

Keep your guard up... That ain't

Coolidge out on that porch.

BETTY

What are you doing?  Sleep walking?

BOB

(Turning)

Couldn't sleep.

BETTY

Whatever you've got on your mind

isn't worth staying awake for.

BOB

Where have I heard that?

BETTY

Tell you how I handle a situation

like this, Doctor.

FADE OUT

WAVERLY

How could you send all my suits to

the cleaners?

MARTHA

You've only got two.

SUSAN

Why can't you wear your uniform?

WAVERLY

I won't appear in uniform!

SUSAN

Please, Gramp.

WAVERLY

Absolutely not!

MARTHA

Very well.  I'll explain to Bob and

Phil that you didn't care to come to

the show tonight.

WAVERLY

I'll have you court-martialed!

MARTHA

You don't mind being ungrateful, you

just don't like being told you are!

SUSAN

(Follows it up)

If you think you don't owe them

anything, you're not obliged to go.

MARTHA

They haven't done much for you.

Hardly anything.  You do what you

think is right!

WAVERLY

(Angrily)

Martha, I'll make my own decisions!

I got along very well in the army

without you!

MARTHA

It took 15,000 men to take my place!

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

(Seating a party)

Right this way.

BOB

(At the trousers)

This thing's shrunk.

PHIL

(Looking at the bulge)

Pants always shrink in closets.

BOB

I can't breathe in this.  What am I

going to do?

PHIL

I know what I'm going to do.

(Showing him)

I'm going to take one big deep breath,

and that's going to be it for the

next three hours.

WAVERLY

(Gruffly)

Well, I couldn't come down in my

bathrobe.

WAVERLY

(He must have had a

blood transfusion

from a sergeant at

some time)

I am not satisfied with the conduct

of this division!  Some of you men

are under the impression that having

been at Anzio entitles you not to

wear neckties!  You are wrong!

Neckties will be worn in this area!

I have also noticed a deterioration

in the quality of saluting!  This is

to be improved!  I have also had

complaints from the commanding officer

of the rest area in Naples!  He

informs me that the non-fraternization

rule is constantly being broken by

men of this division!  In fact, this

division is outstanding in its

violations of non-fraternization!

You all know the rules!  The non-

fraternization ban expressly declares

you are not to talk to women!

(A slightly different

tone)

Don't talk to them!  That is all!

BOB

(To the audience)

Doesn't that bring back memories?

Remember those terrible, trying days

in Italy... when we had to beat the

women off with chocolate bars?

PHIL

And wasn't it awful the way they

kept bothering us for American

cigarettes?  Why, I must have taught

fifty girls how to smoke...

BOB

For a month's pay all we got was 950

million lira...

PHIL

Nine hundred and fifty two...

BOB

I was forced to hire a caddy for my

loose change.

PHIL

Fore...!

BOB

I'm glad I'm well out of it.

PHIL

Who are we kidding?

ED HARRISON

Long distance call for you, sir.

WAVERLY

(Into phone, gruffly)

Hurry up, hurry up, I'm busy.

Yes, this is General Waverly.

WAVERLY

(Quietly)

And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr.

President... Yes, practically the

whole outfit is here.  A little

paunchy, but they're here.  It

certainly was a surprise -- more

like a frameup.  As usual, my

Intelligence was not functioning

efficiently... Yes?

(Long pause)

That's very nice of you, Mr.

President... any time you want me,

just say the word... but may I add

this?  It isn't always necessary to

take a job... sometimes it's enough

just to know it's there.

WAVERLY

If you ever take it into your mind

to grab a little rest from all that

work I wish you'd drop in on us here --

I can't promise you any golf but --

(As he looks at the

falling snow)

-- we can certainly give you plenty

of snow, Mr, President... Yes, Mr.

President... What?

(Smiles)

Thanks, Ike.

MARTHA

You frightened me to death!  That

bell hasn't been used for three

months!

GENERAL

Get this area policed up.  No telling

who might be dropping in.

MARTHA

Yes, sir!

FADE OUT

THE END
