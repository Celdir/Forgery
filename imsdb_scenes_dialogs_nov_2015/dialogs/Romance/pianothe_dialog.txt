----------------------------------------------------------------

ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7)

The voice you hear is not my

speaking voice, but my mind's

voice.

I have not spoken since I was

six years old. No one knows

why, not even me. My father

says it is a dark talent and

the day I take it into my head

to stop breathing will be my

last.

Today he married me to a man

I've not yet met. Soon my

daughter and I shall join him

in his own country. My husband

said my muteness does not

bother him. He writes and hark

this: God loves dumb creatures,

so why not he!

Were good he had God's patience

for silence affects everyone in

the end. The strange thing is I

don't think myself silent, that

is, because of my piano. I

shall miss it on the journey.

CUT TO BLACK

SEAMEN

Hold still you smutt! Blast the

boat!

Look up! Look up!

Lay to! Lay to.

Up with it you buggerers, hold

hard!

Damn me won't you hold?!

Etc.

SEAMEN

It's a little rough out there.

Could be they can't get through

to you in this weather. Maybe

they'll come over land.

SEAMEN

Have you things for shelter?

SEAMEN

What things have you?

FLORA

She says, "thank you".

SEAMEN

Does your mother prefer to come

on with us to Nelson?

FLORA

She says, No. She says she'd

rather be boiled alive by

natives than get back in your

tub.

SEAMEN

(stunned) You be damn fortuned

I don't smack your puppy gob,

missy. Damn lucky.

FLORA

(hand signaling) Mother... I'm

thinking

(speaking) I'm not going to

call him Papa.  I'm not going

to call HIM anything. I'm not

even going to look at HIM.

BAINES

Are we stopping?... Do you want

to stop?

BAINES

Shall we stop?

BAINES

Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me

tutatou I konei.

(Wait! We are stopping.. we're

stopping.)

SUBTITLED

STEWART

We must get on.

TAME

Aue tepatupsiarehe!

(The fairy people, what can you

expect?)

SUBTITLED

STEWART

Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart.

You'll have to wake yourself.

I've got men here to carry your

things.

Aut he anahera enci?

(Are they angels, they look

like angels.)

SUBTITLED

Te monohi hoki!

(So small!)

SUBTITLED

STEWART

I see you have a good many

boxes, I'd like to know what is

in each.

STEWART

CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME?

STEWART

Well that is good, yes that is

good, good.

STEWART

What's in here?

STEWART

Ohh, yes so it is, written

there, crockery.

STEWART

And this one?

STEWART

You're small. I never thought

you'd be small.

STEWART

What's here?

STEWART

What's in here then, lead?

FLORA

(gravely) It's my mother's

piano.

STEWART

A piano?

STEWART

Tell them to carry in pairs.

Those three and those two the

black and the red, then the

suitcases.

STEWART

What do you think?

BAINES

She looks tired.

STEWART

She's stunted, that's one

thing.

BAINES

Anei nga pouaka - ko era e

toro.

Me era e raa.

(Here are the boxes, those

three and those two.)

UNSUBTITLED

HONE

E Hoal

STEWART

Oh no, it can't come now.

FLORA

It must come.

FLORA

She wants it to come.

STEWART

Yes and so do I, but there are

too few of us here to carry it.

TOO - HEAVY

STEWART

Do you mean you don't want your

kitchenware or your clothes? Is

that what you mean?

FLORA

We can't leave the piano

STEWART

Let us not discuss this

further. I am very pleased....

FLORA

Mother wants to know if they

could come back directly for

it?

FLORA

After they have taken the other

things?

PITO

Kei Riri a te raho Maroke.

(shouted loudly at TAHU)

(Watch it dry balls is getting

touchy.)

SUBTITLED

STEWART

I suggest you prepare for a

difficult journey. The bush

will tear clothes and the mud

is deep in places.

STEWART

(to BAINES about the MAORIS)

What are they doing? We don't

have time for that.

BAINES

Mr. Stewart asked if I might

show you to the path. (ADA does

not move) ... May I carry

something?

BAINES

aha tenei?

(What is it?)

SUBTITLED

HONE

E hinga te Koroua ra B Pitama i

konci. Kare noa Kia hikina te

tapu.

(Old man Pitama died here.

(points to the spot)

The Tapu hasn't been lifted)

UNSUBTITLED

STEWART

What's he say?

BAINES

Someone died here. It's tapu.

STEWART

But we came down this way

didn't we? I'm sure we did.

0h Pitama eh.

HONE

E Tarna heke atu ki ram - tiro

his atu.

Rapuhia mai he huarahi re!

(Go and look, find another

track eh!)

UNSUBTITLED

TIPI

'cia tupato he ana taniwba ke

raro na.

(Go easy there's a ghost down

there.)

SUBTITLED

HOTU

'Ca, rongo koe i te haunga a

tans tutae i te tuatahi. (You

smell his shit first.)

UNSUBTITLED

STEWART

They want more money. They are

trying to make two days out of

it?

BAINES

No, no they know another track

- to the side of this.

AUNT MORAG

Watch your feet!

NESSIE

Watch your feet!

AUNT MORAG

Careful! Watch his hand.

NESSIE

Watch his hand

AUNT MORAG

Stop it!

AUNT MORAG

(shooing the Reverend out)

We'll bring out the bride.

AUNT MORAG

LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR.

FLORA

My REAL father was a famous

German composer

AUNT MORAG

Ohh the tag is broken.

FLORA

(continues) .... They met when

my mother was an opera

singer... in Luxemburg...

FLORA

Why?

FLORA

I want to be in the photograph.

STEWART

Beautiful.

AUNT MORAG

I thought she met your father

in Luxemburg.

FLORA

Well, yes, in Austria where be

conducted the Royal Orchestra.

AUNT MORAG

(frowning) And where did they

get married?

FLORA

(her Scottish accent becomes

thick and expressive) In an

enormous forest, with real

fairies as bridesmaids each

holding a little elf's hand.

FLORA

No, I tell a lie, it was in a

small country church, near the

mountains

AUNT MORAG

Which mountains are those dear?

FLORA

The Alps.

AUNT MORAG

Ohhh I've never been there.

(she leans forward)

FLORA

Mother used to sing the songs

in German and her voice would

echo across the valleys

That was before the

accident....

AUNT MORAG

Oh what happened?

FLORA

One day when my mother and

father were singing together in

the forest, a great storm blew

up out of nowhere. But so

passionate was their singing

that they did not notice, nor

did they stop as the rain began

to fall and when their voices

rose for the final bars of the

duet a great bolt of lightening

came out of the sky and struck

my father so that he lit up

like a torch... And at the same

moment my father was struck

dead my mother was struck dumb!

She- never-spoke-another-word.

AUNT MORAG

Ohhh ... dear. Not another word

From the shock, yes it would

be.

AUNT MORAG

Terrible.  Terrible

STEWART

I shall be gone for some days.

There is some Maori land I want

and may buy very reasonably.

(STEWART shuffles) I am hoping

you will use the time to settle

in, and, in some ways we may

start again

STEWART

All right?

BAINES

I'm not able to read.

FLORA

Please take us to the beach

where we landed.

BAINES

I'm sorry, I can't do that.

(FLORA and ADA stare evenly at

him)

I don't have the time.

(They continue to stare.)

Goodbye

BAINES

I - can't - take - you there. I

can't do it.

STEWART

Hello, then.

FLORA

Hello.

AUNT MORAG

(looking carefully at STEWART)

Well you stopped combing your

hair, which is a good thing, it

was looking over done.

(without pause but referring to

the sheet) You see these are

the slits that the heads will

go through, show him Nessie ...

they'll be dead, the Reverend

is going to use animal blood,

no doubt it will be very

dramatic. Tea!

(for NESSIE rather than to her)

NESSIE

It will be very dramatic.

STEWART

(sitting down)

What would you think if someone

played a kitchen table like it

were a piano?

AUNT MORAG

Like it were a piano?

STEWART

It's strange isn't it? I mean

it's not a piano, it doesn't

make any sound.

AUNT MORAG

(hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.'

No, no sound.

STEWART

I knew she was mute, but now

I'm thinking it's more than

that. I'm wondering if she's

not brain affected.

AUNT MORAG

No sound at all?

STEWART

No, it was a table.

AUNT MORAG

(musing) Well, she was very

violent with the gown. She tore

off a chunk of lace. if hadn't

been there I'd have sworn she'd

used her teeth

NESSIE

and wiped her feet an it.

STEWART

Well it has not yet come to

anything. Just a concern.

AUNT MORAG

Oh, yes, yes of course, a

concern.

STEWART

There is something to be said

for silence

AUNT MORAG

Oh indeed. Cotton'.

STEWART

(warming)  And with time she

will, I'm sure, become

affectionate.

AUNT MORAG

Certainly, there is nothing so

easy to like as a pet and they

are quite silent.

BAINES

Those 80 acres, that cross the

stream, what do you think of

them?

STEWART

On your property?

BAINES

Yes

STEWART

Good, flatish land with

reliable water, why? I don't

have money. What are you about?

BAINES

I'd like to make a swap.

STEWART

What for?

BAINES

The piano.

STEWART

The piano on the beach? Ada's

piano?

STEWART

It's not marshy is it?

BAINES

No.

STEWART

You'd have to organise it up

here.

BAINES

Yes, I thought that.

STEWART

Well Baines the music lover, I

never would have known. Hidden

talents George.

BAINES

I'll have to get lessons. It

wouldn't be much use without

them.

STEWART

Yes, I suppose you would.

STEWART

Well Ada can play.

STEWART

I have it in a letter she plays

well. She's been playing since

she was 5 or6.

STEWART

I have got us some excellent

land. Baines has taken some

queer idea to have a piano, and

you are to give him lessons.

Have you taught before?

FLORA

What on?

STEWART

On your piano, that is the

swap.

STEWART

What does she say?

FLORA

She says it's her piano, and

she won't have him touch it.

He's an oaf, he can't read,

he's ignorant.

STEWART

He wants to improve himself...

and you will be able to play on

it ... (ADA is not responding

well) Teach him to look after

it.

NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S

MINE!

STEWART

(getting up) You can't go on

like this, we are a family now,

all of us make sacrifices and

so will you.

You will teach him. I shall see

to that!

HiM na ake 'nun na'.

(Lift up the back)

UNSUBTITLED

Tern - tern!

(Ass hole!)

Hei niti niti maan!

(turning around)

You lick it.)

STEWART

I'd try children's tunes,

nothing more complicated

STEWART

Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.

STEWART

(lifting the lid) It looks

good, very nice looking thing.

Well . I wish you luck. The girls

are very excited about the

lessons.

STEWART

Flora will explain anything Ada says.

They talk through their fingers,

you can't believe what they say

with just their hands.

FLORA

My mother wants to see your

hands. Hold them out.

No, no, like this

FLORA

You have to wash them.

BAINES

They are washed.

FLORA

Wash them again.

BAINES

The marks do not come out.

They are scars and hardened

skin.

FLORA

There's no tune left in the

piano so she can't teach you.

BLIND MAN

Ah, a Broadbent. A fine

instrument. I've not come

across one here, or in the

Islands where I have tuned some

200. Yes, they like their

pianos there.

Scent? And salt of course.

What will you play when it's

tuned? What music do you play?

BAINES

I can't play.

BLIND MAN

You don't play?

BAINES

No, I can't.

I'm going to learn.

BLIND MAN

Well my dear Miss Broadbent,

tuned, but silent.

FLORA

Mother says she can't stand to

teach piano with it all out or

tune. So I'm to do scales.

FLORA

I hope you've scrubbed your

hands.

Oh, it's in tune.

FLORA

What's out there?

FLORA

You have to watch me where I

put my fingers.

FLORA

It's in tune.

FLORA

(Hissing) I was teaching.

FLORA

She wants to see what you can

do.

BAINES

I'd rather not play. I want to

listen and learn that way.

FLORA

Everyone has to practice.

BAINES

I just want to listen.

FLORA

What do you want to hear?

BAINES

Anything.

FLORA

Tell me about my real father.

How did you speak to him?

ADA (subtitled)

I didn't need to speak, I could

lay thoughts out in his mind

like they were a sheet

FLORA

What happened? Why didn't you

get married?

ADA cont.

After a while he became

frightened and he stopped

listening.

STEWART

Shall I kiss you goodnight?

BAINES

Do you know how to bargain, nod

if you do.

There's a way you can have your

piano back. Do you want it

back? You want it back?

BAINES

You see I'd like us to make a

deal. There's things I want to

do while you stay. If you let

me you can earn it back.

What do you think, one visit

for every key.

BAINES

Your dress?

Skirt ...?

For every black one?

That's a lot less, half.

All right, all right then, the

black keys.

It's better that you play.

BAINES

Play... Keep playing.

HIRA

I got the good wife for you

Peini. She pray good. Clean.

Read Bible. You sleep her

Peini. She chief daughter.

BAINES

No, no bible readers.

HIRA

Why? We need you pakeha clever.

You sleep her.

TAHU

(A big man dressed as a woman)

(Background) I give her plenty

clever. (Gestures sexually)

BAINES

I have a wife.

TAHU

(camping it up) I give her

clever eb Peini. Hallelujah!

HIRA

Don't answer, he low born. Jun

look at him, mongrel. Your wife

where she?

BAINES

She lives her own life in New

Jersey, America.

HIRA

You have spare wife here Peini.

You get rnana for that. Our

chief four wives.

I marry white man Peini, he a

whaler like you. He very good

to me. Love me, nurse me.

HIRA

Who do that? It not finish,

that no good Peini. You finish!

FLORA

(small voice)

I want to speak to my mother

I don't want to be outside, I

want to watch.

I'll be very quiet.

I won't look at him!

"I shall listen hard to rehearsal,

because I live too

far away to go often."

AUNT MORAG

(suspiciously) Which sign is

the word rehearsal?

AUNT MORAG

I can't imagine a fate worse

than being dumb. Turn around.

NESSIE

To be deaf?

AUNT MORAG

Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE!

AWFUL!"'

FLORA

Actually, to tell you the whole

truth, Mama says most people

speak rubbish and it's not

worth the listen.

AUNT MORAG

(stiffly) Well, that is a

strong opinion.

FLORA

Yes, it's unholy.

BAINES

Lift your skirt,

Lift it higher.

BAINES

Higher.

Lift it higher.

REVEREND

Nessie, your hand out ... out

here, please.

NESSIE

Oh, no use Mr Stewart, I can't

act.

REVEREND

Nessie, please.

REVEREND

Look you are being attacked!

REVEREND

And with the blood ... it will

be a good effect:

BAINES

Undo your dress. This part,

(he indicates the top) I want

to see your arms.

BAINES

Play.

Two keys.

AUNT MORAG

I hardly need to give one to

you, but there you are anyway.

Don't be late. You will see

there are two times and since

you are accompanying a

performer, you will need to

make the earlier time

STEWART

Wait.

STEWART

How are the lessons going?

ADA nods enthusiastically.

He's getting on all right?

ADA nods again

Good.

AUNT MORAG

That is good, yes.

She seems quieted down.  Is she

more affectionate?

AUNT MORAG

Ah well, slowly, slowly

BAINES

Ada, four keys.

I just want to lie.

All right, all right five.

FLORA

The Holly and the Ivy...

WOMAN

They're bringing in extra

seats!

ANOTHER WOMAN

Oh God, don't pin my hair too

high Alfred!

STILL ANOTHER

Yes, me too, do it about here

... (she shows Alfred)

MAN ONE

Look who's here, the musical MR BAINES

What will we have tonight

George, "Twinkle, twinkle?"

ANOTHER MAN

'Mary had a little lamb' or a

polka, come on George what's it

to be?

AUNT MORAG

Mr. Baines, do come and turn

pages

BAINES

I can't read music, I have just

begun.

STEWART

(turning) Lot of fools. Come

on, move up.

-sing up Billy!

-Come on sing out!

REVEREND

And so the young maid came upon

each and all of Bluebeard's

missing wives, their severed

heads still bleeding, their

eyes still crying.

REVEREND

But who it this?

BLUEBEARD

I am home early my sweet wife

... where art thou?

YOUNG WIFE

Hello husband, what a surprise!

BLUEBEARD

Yes wife, a surprise indeed! So

now you know my secret you, the

sweetest and youngest or all my

wives must be prepared to die.

Auc! Ha aba ra tenei?

SUBTITLED

YOUNG WIFE

No, no wait!

BLUEBEARD

I shall not wait. Bare your

neck.

Kia hiwara! Kin hiwara!

(Be on the alert! Brace

yourself)

Pokokohun - whakaputa mai ja

(Coward! Show yourself, come

out!)

SUBTITLED

NIHE

Hoki rnai! Hoki rnai!

(Come back here! Come back

here!)

SUBTITLED

BAINES

I have been waiting. You are

very late.

BAINES

I don't want you to play. I

just want you to sit.

BAINES

(angry) No, not two keys.

BAINES

(shouts) Two keys then!

MAORI NEGOTIATOR

(pointing to the places)

Nga awa kau kau, nga ana koiwi

(The bathing waters, the caves,

land. Explain it to the man

Baines.)

SUBTITLED

STEWART

(muttering to BAINES across the

previous speech) What do they

say? Are they selling? Offer

the blankets for half the land.

STEWART

T-w~e-l-v~e.

BAINES

for half the land.)

UNSUBTITLED

STEWART

(Quietly to BAINES)

Offer the guns.

MAORI NEGOTIATOR

Never behave like that, never

shamed and you have shamed

those trunks. (trees)

MAORI WOMEN

What o'clock say Mr Stewart?

-Ge Tupeka?

(got tobacco?)

-Time for puff puff.

FLORA

(sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines

can't play the piano.

STEWART

You've missed this bit.

FLORA

She never gives him a turn.

She just plays whatever she

pleases, sometimes she doesn't

play at all.

STEWART

And when is the next lesson?

FLORA

Tomorrow.

BAINES

I am giving the piano back to

you. I've had enough.  The

arrangement is making you a

whore and me wretched.

I want you to care for me, but

you can't.

HIRA

(softly) George, can I use this

comb?

BAINES

It's yours, leave, go on go!

STEWART

(stiffly from some distance)

Stop right there'. This isn't

yours  what are you doing with

the piano?

FLORA

He's given it to us.

STEWART

(out of breath) Hah, you're

very cunning Ada, but I've seen

through you, I'm not going to

lose the land this way. Wait

here!

HIRA

George sick, he don't wanna see

nobody. You got Tupeka for the

Hira?

STEWART

I don't think you should have

given up the piano. I will make

sure you are properly taught,

with music written on to sheets

and...

BAINES

I don't want to learn.

STEWART

You don't want to learn.

BAINES

No.

STEWART

And what does this do to our

bargain? I cannot afford the

piano if you mean me to pay.

BAINES

No, no payment. I have given it

back. I don't want it.

STEWART

Well, I doubt I want it very

much myself.

BAINES

It was more to your wife that I

gave it.

STEWART

Well, thank you, I expect she

will appreciate it.

So that is agreed on?

HIRA

You make BIG mistake George. In

first place you should swap

land for wife. Now look, she

gone, you no land, no music

box, you got nothing.

STEWART

Is it all right? Aren't you

going to play something?

FLORA

STEWART

FLORA

STEWART

STEWART

STEWART

FLORA

FLORA

STEWART

FLORA

To HELL!

BAINES

So what brings you here? Did

you leave something? I have not

found anything.

Does he know something?

The piano is not harmed? It

arrived safely? Would you like

to sit? I am going to sit.

BAINES

Ada, I am unhappy because I

want you, because my mind has

seized on you and thinks of

nothing else. This is how I

suffer, I am sick with longing.

I don't eat, I don't sleep. If

you do not want me, if you have

come with no feeling for me,

then go!

Go! Go NOW! Leave!

BAINES

What?  What?  whisper....

BAINES

Now you are going I am

miserable, why is that? (He

catches her hand and draws her

to hint) Ada I need to know,

what will you do? Will you come

again?

BAINES

Wait! I don't know what you're

thinking. (gently, teasingly)

Does this mean something to

you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of

hair behind her ear) I already

miss you. Ada, do you love me?

BAINES

(anxiously) Come tomorrow. If

you are serious, come tomorrow.

BAINES

Tomorrow?

FLORA

Stay still! It's the very worst

knots.

FLORA

Mama STOP IT!

FLORA

Stop it I feel sick!

FLORA

(TOP OF HER LUNGS) Mumma!

Mumma! They are playing your

piano!

FLORA

Here Papa!

FLORA

You shouldn't have gone up

there, should you? I don't like

it and nor does Papa. Mama, we

can play cards together.

FLORA

She is asleep, look.

STEWART

You are letting the clothes

float off... They are floating

off.

FLORA

Mama! Look out!

FLORA

One, two, three

One, two, three

STEWART

Ada!

AUNT MORAG

Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a

dank cave.

NESSIE

Yes, like a cave.

AUNT MORAG

Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!

AUNT MORAG

Alisdair, is it because of our

play? Have the natives

aggressed you?

NESSIE

(nodding her head in imitation)

... you are quite trapped.

AUNT MORAG

We have just come from George

Banes' and they have taken him

over. It is no wonder he is

leaving, he has got in too deep

with the natives. They sit on

his floor as proud as Kings,

but without a shred of manners.

NESSIE

(in unison) ... without a shred

of manners.

on plates putting them about the table.

AUNT MORAG

He is quite altered, as if they

had been trying some native

witchcraft on him. Well

tomorrow or the day after he

will be gone.

STEWART

Baines is packing up?

AUNT MORAG

Well he has NOTHING to pack,

but he is leaving. And it is

just as well; Nessie has

foolishly grown an affection

for him ... we have had some

tears

AUNT MORAG

(very firmly) STOP IT! STOP!

I am quite frightened of the

way back, we must leave in good

light. Will we be safe?

STEWART

(wanting them gone) If you

leave soon, yes, I am sure of

it.

AUNT MORAG

You know I am thinking of the

piano. She does not play the

piano as we do Nessie.

UP! UP! No she is a strange

creature and her saying is

strange like a mood that passes

into you. You cannot teach that

Nessie, one may like to learn

but that could not be taught.

Up! Your playing is plain and

true and that is what I like.

To have a sound creep inside

you is not all pleasant

what is that?

NESSIE

FLORA

STEWART

(Clears his throat) We must

both get on. I have decided to

trust you to stay here. You

will not see Baines?

(ADA nods) Good, good. Perhaps

with more trying you will come

to like me?

No!

FLORA

make me hurt you? Do you bear?

be happy

You have made me angry. SPEAK!!

STEWART

(speaking to his feet)

I lost my temper. I'm sorry.

STEWART

You broke my trust, you pushed

me hard, to hard. (he sighs)

You cannot send love to HIM you

cannot do it.  Even to think on

it makes me angry, very angry

STEWART

I meant to love you. I clipped

your wing, that is all.

STEWART

We shall be together, you will

see it will be better...

STEWART

(whispering) ...

my love bird.

STEWART

Ohhhhh my love

STEWART

You are feeling better?

STEWART

What...?

STEWART

Put that away, on the floor.

STEWART

I look at you, at your face. I

have had that face in my head

hating it. But now I am here

seeing it ... it's nothing, you

blink, you have your mark, you

look at me through your eyes,

yes. you are even scared of me

STEWART

Look at you!

STEWART

(softly)

Has Ada ever spoken to you?

BAINES

You mean in signs?

STEWART

No, words. You have never heard

words?

BAINES

No, not words.

STEWART

Never thought you heard words?

STEWART

(slowly)

She has spoken to me. I heard

her voice. There was no sound,

but I beard it here (he presses

his forehead with a palm of his

hand). Her voice was there in

my head. I watched her lips,

they did not make the words,

yet the harder I listened the

clearer I heard her, as clear

as I hear you, as dear as I

hear my own voice.

BAINES

(trying to understand)

Spoken words?

STEWART

No, but her words are in my

head. (he looks at BAINES and

pauses) I know what you think,

that it's a trick, that I'm

making it up. No, the words I

heard, were her words.

BAINES

(suspiciously) What are they?

STEWART

She said, "I have to go, let me

go, let Baines take me away,

let him try and save me. I am

frightened of my will, of what

it might do it is so strange

and strong".

BAINES

You punished her wrongly, it

was me, my fault.

STEWART

Understand me. I am here for

her, for her I wonder that I

don't wake, that I am not

asleep to be here talking with

you. I love her. But what is

the use? She doesn't care for

me. I wish her gone. I wish you

gone. I want to wake and find

it was a dream, that is what I

want. I want to believe I am

not this man. I want my self

back; the one I know.

HIRA

I worry for you.

BAINES

No, I love her, we will be a

family. I have her piano. I

will mend it, she will get

better.

HIRA

I miss you.

I teach piano now in Nelson.

George has fashioned me a metal

learning to speak. My sound is

still so bad I am ashamed. I

practice only when I am alone

and it is dark.

ADA (VOICE OVER)

At night! I think of my piano

in its ocean grave, and

sometimes of myself floating

above it. Down there everything

is so still and silent that it

lulls me to sleep. It is a

weird lullaby and so it is; it

is mine.
