BODY OF EVIDENCE

B O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C E

by Brad Mirman (second draft)

--------------------------------------------------------------

Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A

MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.

FADE IN:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking

man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of

him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we

catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side

to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched

back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches

down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him

deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what

we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS

standing before the television watching the act.

The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down

the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO

CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,

looking, dusting, talking.

We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the

tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet

covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his

dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of

his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The

wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.

The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the

end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,

their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps

out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,

with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.

He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a

homicide detective runs out to meet him.

2

CARDENAS

Is it Marsh?

REESE

Yeah.

Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an

instant, then it's gone.

REESE

Sir, do you mind if we get out of the

rain?

Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.

CARDENAS

Who found him?

REESE

His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.

CARDENAS

She was here?

REESE

No.  She stopped by to pick up some

papers.

CARDENAS

Show me.

Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night

sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.

INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of

Marsh in bed.

Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the

FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the

gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of

indifference.

Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER

TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the

body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a

portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.

CARDENAS

How long?

3

MCCURDY

About three hours.

CARDENAS

Cause?

MCCURDY

Not sure.  I'll have everything you

need tomorrow.

REESE

Take a look at this.

Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On

top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal

spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL

AIDES.

TROXELL

This guy was into some kinky shit.

Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of

the room.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from

crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come

more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right

cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.

CARDENAS

Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney

John Cardenas.  You arrived at what

time tonight?

JOANNE

A little after eleven.

CARDENAS

Why did you come by?

JOANNE

I had some papers to pick up.

CARDENAS

Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

JOANNE

I assume his girlfriend.

4

CARDENAS

Her name?

JOANNE

Rebecca Lawson.

CARDENAS

You wouldn't know her address, would

you?

JOANNE

No -- but I can get it for you.

CARDENAS

Thank you.

MCCURDY

Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces

of sperm on the sheets.  The

toxicology report says there were

high levels of cocaine in his blood.

CARDENAS

What'd he die of?

MCCURDY

The official cause of death was a

cardiac arrest.

CARDENAS

The official cause?

MCCURDY

That's what my report will read.

CARDENAS

But there's more?

MCCURDY

It's speculative at this point.

Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.

His heart attack was induced by

excessive aerobic activity -- in

conjunction with the drug.

5

CARDENAS

(to McCurdy)

What are you saying, Henry?  That his

girlfriend fucked him to death?

MCCURDY

Yes.

CARDENAS

What can we prove?

MCCURDY

We know Marsh had a head cold.   We

found cocaine mixed with water in a

nasal spray container on the

nightstand.  The coke would contract

the nasal membrane the same as any

decongestant, but for a much shorter

time.  He'd keep using more and more

-- never knowing what he was taking.

CARDENAS

Any prints on the nasal spray?

REESE

Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.

TROXELL

What if he did know what was in it?

A lot of users put it in nasal spray

bottles so they can use it in public.

MCCURDY

Cocaine is the last thing a man in

his condition would want.

CARDENAS

Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the

scene?

6

REESE

A man across the street from Marsh

saw her drive up about four thirty

Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are

all over the place.

TROXELL

Marsh's Cardiologist told me that

after Marsh was diagnosed with heart

disease he quit smoking, quit

drinking and started exercising every

day.  Does that sound like a guy

who'd start shoveling cocaine up his

nose?

CARDENAS

What did he say about Miss Lawson?

TROXELL

He can remember at least one occasion

-- and the receptionist can recall

two times when she accompanied Marsh

to the office.

CARDENAS

So she knew about his heart?

TROXELL

Had to.  I also interviewed three

women who were in past relationships

with Marsh.  There's no evidence that

he had anything but straight sex

prior to meeting Miss Lawson.

CARDENAS

What about the will?

TROXELL

That's the best part.  She gets it

all -- everything.

7

CARDENAS

Miss Lawson?

CARDENAS

I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

SATTLER

I don't think that this is the time,

or the place.

CARDENAS

I just wanted to introduce myself and

inform Miss Lawson that there will be

an inquiry.

SATTLER

An inquiry into what?

CARDENAS

For starters I'd like to know why she

left the house and didn't report the

death?

SATTLER

Because he wasn't dead when she left,

and even if he was, not reporting a

natural death in a timely fashion

isn't a crime.

CARDENAS

Did I say it was a natural death?

8

SHARON

You're on vacation, remember?  You're

supposed to be relaxing.

DULANEY

I am relaxing.

SHARON

(pushing the papers

aside)

This is not relaxing.

DULANEY

(playfully)

Really?

SHARON

Really.

DULANEY

(playing along)

And I suppose you're going to show me

how to relax?

SHARON

If you want me to.

DULANEY

I'm always open to learning new

things.

DULANEY

I'm beginning to see what you mean.

Why don't we go upstairs and work on

the advanced course?

9

SHARON

I can't.  I've got to finish a

counter offer on the Bergman

property.

DULANEY

Can't it wait?

SHARON

No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

DULANEY

Hey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

MICHAEL

Uh huh.

DULANEY

(into phone)

Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...

Well, I was sort of planning on...

Alright... Okay, goodbye.

(hangs up; to Sharon)

That was Sattler.  He thinks the

D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca

Lawson.  He wants me in the office

tomorrow morning.

SHARON

We're supposed to go to the lake.

DULANEY

I know.  What can I do?  He is the

boss.

SHARON

He could let you have your vacation.

MICHAEL

Dad -- is it true what they're saying

about that Miss Lawson Lady?

10

DULANEY

What are they saying?

MICHAEL

The kids at school say she humped Mr.

Marsh to death.

DULANEY

Hey, you know better than that.  What

did I teach you to say when someone

is accused of doing something?

MICHAEL

She allegedly humped him to death?

SHARON

I swear -- the both of you.

(to Dulaney)

Some example you set.

DULANEY

(imitating her)

Some example you set.

DULANEY

Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.

A trial like this is going to put

Cardenas in the spot-light.

SATTLER

We've already got press arriving from

over the country and she hasn't even

been charged yet.

Cardenas wants to see her in his

office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you

to go with her.

DULANEY

I'm supposed to be on vacation.

11

SATTLER

I know -- but she wants you to

represent her if Cardenas files.

DULANEY

Why?

SATTLER

Because I told her you were the best

criminal attorney we have.

DULANEY

Raymond, I'm the only criminal

attorney you have.

SATTLER

(jokingly)

Well, I guess that makes you the

best.

(candidly)

Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit

three million dollars.  As executors

of the estate and her attorneys that

could generate a lot of legal fees

for us.  All I'm asking you to do is

talk to her.

DULANEY

Alright, I'll talk to her

SATTLER

She's waiting in the conference room.

SATTLER

(continuing)

You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for

almost twenty years -- or thought I

did.  What do you think would make a

man in his condition do the things he

did?

DULANEY

I think the question is:  What is it

about her that made him want to do

it?

12

DULANEY

Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

REBECCA

(nervously)

Are you going to represent me?

DULANEY

There are no charges against you. I'm

here to decide if I'm going to

represent you should that occur.

(beat)

Did you kill him?

REBECCA

You don't waste any time, do you?

REBECCA

(continuing)

Do you think I did it?

DULANEY

I don't know.  That's why I'm asking

you.

REBECCA

You must have some feeling.  Some

immediate impression.  A young,

attractive woman, involved with an

older man who leaves her everything

in his will.  And the things that

went on in that house.  Such wild

sex.  What kind of picture does that

paint?

DULANEY

Not a very good one I'm afraid.

13

REBECCA

And that's exactly what the jury will

see when they look at me.  That's why

I need a very good lawyer, Mr.

Dulaney.

DULANEY

You're assuming the District Attorney

is going to file charges.

REBECCA

He'll file.  He's an ambitious man.

Ambitious men build their careers on

the bodies of others.

DULANEY

You still haven't answered my

question.

REBECCA

(emotionally)

I loved him.  A big part of my life

has been torn away from me, Mr.

Dulaney.  A part I can never get back

-- and on top of that people are

saying that I am somehow responsible

for it.  They've taken everything

that is good and caring about two

people in love and made it dirty.

REBECCA

No -- I didn't kill him.

TROXELL

I think I'm going to make your day.

CARDENAS

How?

14

TROXELL

I've got this guy in my office.

Doctor Alan Paley.  Wait until you

hear what he has to say.

SHARON

How can Cardenas possibly think he

can build a case against two

consenting adults?

DULANEY

He must have something or he wouldn't

be pressing so hard.

SHARON

If he files are you going to take the

case?

DULANEY

I don't know yet.  I want to hear

what she says at her statement

tomorrow.

SHARON

What's she like?

DULANEY

Attractive.  Bright.  Distant.

Charming when she wants to be.

SHARON

She sounds like quite a woman.

DULANEY

(joking)

Yeah -- but can she cook?

15

SHARON

The whole thing gives me the creeps.

I mean -- what if she really humped

him to death?

DULANEY

Humped

SHARON

(grinning)

Yes.

DULANEY

I can think of worse ways to go--

DULANEY

(continuing)

--and speaking of humping.

REBECCA

I didn't know that Andrew was dead

until Mr. Sattler called me at home

that night.

REESE

We have a witness who saw you go into

the house at four thirty.

DULANEY

She's not denying she was there.

REESE

Did you have sex?

16

REBECCA

Yes.

REESE

What time did you leave?

REBECCA

Six thirty -- and he was very much

alive.

CARDENAS

Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

REBECCA

I have.

CARDENAS

Did you use it the night Marsh died?

REBECCA

No.  I haven't done it in years.

REESE

Did Marsh use it?

REBECCA

No -- never.

REESE

It had to get there somehow.

REBECCA

It didn't get there from me.

CARDENAS

Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart

condition?

REBECCA

No.

CARDENAS

Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his

nurse have told us that you

accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office

on at least two occasions.

REBECCA

That's correct -- but Andrew never

told me he had a heart condition.  He

said he had a heart arrhythmia and it

was nothing serious.

REESE

He never mentioned his heart disease?

17

DULANEY

She just said that.

REESE

Why do you think he lied to you?

DULANEY

That's something only Marsh would

know.

REESE

I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I

think she slipped him the coke and he

popped his cork giving her the high-

hard-one.

DULANEY

That's it.  My client doesn't have to

take this crap from you.

CARDENAS

Sit down, Frank.

DULANEY

No.  Miss Lawson came in here

voluntarily to answer your questions.

She doesn't have to sit here and be

insulted.  So, either you charge her

now or we're leaving.

CARDENAS

Fine.

REESE

Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest

for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

REESE

You have the right to remain silent.

If you give up--

18

CARDENAS

(to Reese)

I don't think the handcuffs will be

necessary.  You can finish giving

Miss Lawson her rights outside.

REBECCA

(frightened)

Frank!

DULANEY

I'll have you out in a few hours.

DULANEY

Lookin' to make the papers, John?

CARDENAS

Marsh left her close to three million

dollars in his will.  That's motive.

She admits to being there the night

of his death.  That's opportunity --

and her fingerprints are on the nasal

spray bottle.

DULANEY

(continuing)

You can't show intent.

DULANEY

(continuing)

Can you?

CARDENAS

Take your pole out of the water,

Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

DULANEY

You're bluffing.  John, it's me,

remember?  I've known you since your

name was Juan Carlos.

19

DULANEY

(continuing)

C'mon -- think about it.  If she was

going to kill Marsh why leave the

nasal spray bottle there for the

police to find?

CARDENAS

She planned this.  She wanted us to

find the nasal spray.

DULANEY

Why would she want that?

CARDENAS

Because she's clever.  Because she

knows that even if we didn't find it

we'd have suspicions as to why a man

in Marsh's condition would use

cocaine.

DULANEY

Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions

aren't enough for a conviction.

CARDENAS

The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's

nasal membranes showed no sign of

prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal

spray we would have still treated it

as a poisoning.  We would have looked

for motive and the trail would have

still led back to her.

DULANEY

I don't buy it and neither will a

jury.

CARDENAS

We're going all the way on this one,

Frank.  Tell your client she has

until the prelim to cop a plea for

murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

DULANEY

I'll tell her but she won't take it.

CARDENAS

Then she's not as smart as I thought

she was.  You've seen her in the

depositions.  Tell me you don't have

any doubts?

20

DULANEY

She's innocent.

CARDENAS

Aren't they all?

DULANEY

Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the

blindfolded lady with the scales

decide that.

DULANEY

I want you to know right now that the

trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex

life is going to be dragged through

the mud.  They're going to say that

you enticed Marsh -- led him down a

dark path.

REBECCA

Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was

a very passionate man.  He was eager

to explore.  I gave him what he

wanted.  We fulfilled each others

needs.

DULANEY

This is a very small town -- people

here have very straight views on sex.

21

REBECCA

I'm used to being on the outside

looking in.  The same men who will

publicly profess their moral outrage

for my sexual tastes are the same

ones who privately rest their sweaty

little hands on my legs and talk

about weekend trips together.

DULANEY

Those same men will be sitting on the

jury.

REBECCA

I am who I am.  I can't deny it,

anymore than you can deny who you

are.  I like sex different -- I like

it wild.  That's not a crime.

(emotional)

I loved Andrew.  We made love

together.  We made it differently,

but we still made love.  It was our

way.  It was private -- and now the

whole world wants to look in through

the pretense of justice.  If I was

some middle-aged divorcee who screwed

him once a week do you think this

would be happening to me?

REBECCA

Have you ever seen animals make love,

Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion

-- such savage emotion.  They

struggle, and snarl, and claw, but

neither hurts the other.  Not really.

DULANEY

No pain, no gain?

REBECCA

Something like that.

DULANEY

We're not animals.

22

REBECCA

Of course we are.  Our primal urges

are still there -- but we've taken

sex and intellectualized it, refined

it down to its most essential

components.  It's bland, easy,

mechanical.  There's great passion in

the struggle -- such craving in

denial.  Do you know what it's like

to yearn for something?  I'm not

talking about wanting, or needing.

I'm talking about an urge so deep

that your skin burns and every cell

in your body pulses with desire?

DULANEY

(awkwardly)

I think we're getting a little off

the subject here.

REBECCA

I thought the subject was sex?

DULANEY

As it pertains to you -- not me.

(beat)

Did you always know you had

different... tastes?

REBECCA

Yes.

DULANEY

How?

REBECCA

I don't know if it's something I can

explain to you.

DULANEY

Why not?

REBECCA

Because -- it's beyond intellect.

It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has

to be experienced -- it can't be

imagined.

DULANEY

Try.

23

REBECCA

When I was growing up we had a

strawberry patch in our backyard. So

did this family down the road.  I

used to sneak in their yard and steal

their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.

The stone walls were high and I'd

scrape my knees as I climbed over.

On the other side were wild rose

bushes.  The thorns would dig into my

legs and cut my thighs as I lowered

myself down.

DULANEY

If you had what you wanted at home

why did you sneak into their yard?

REBECCA

Because -- somehow the fruit always

tasted that much sweeter because of

the pain it took to get to it.

MICHAEL

Albert's got the stomach flu.

SHARON

That's too bad.

MICHAEL

No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

SHARON

Michael, you shouldn't be happy when

someone else isn't feeling well.

MICHAEL

Not even if they're a dork?

SHARON

Not even if they're a dork.  You

should go by and see how he's

feeling.

24

MICHAEL

No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and

Albert puked right in front of him.

SHARON

Don't use language like that at the

dinner table.

MICHAEL

Sorry.

SHARON

Frank -- I know you're busy, but

Michael asked me after dinner if you

were angry with him.  He wanted to

know why you weren't talking to him.

DULANEY

I'll talk to him later.

SHARON

Why don't you talk to him now?

DULANEY

Because I go to trial in seven weeks.

I've got a lot of preparing to do.

SHARON

(angry)

No one's asking you not to work.  I

just think you could make some time

for your son.

DULANEY

I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not

paying attention to you lately.

25

DULANEY

(continuing)

You know how it is sometimes when

you're out playing ball with your

friends?  How you're really

concentrating on what you're doing --

and you lose track of time and you

come home late and Mom yells at you?

MICHAEL

Yeah.

DULANEY

Well, that's kind of how I am right

now.

MICHAEL

Is Mom yelling at you too?

DULANEY

Yeah -- a little.

DULANEY

I love you.

MICHAEL

I love you too, Dad.

BIGGS

How you doin' Mister D?

DULANEY

Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the

Marsh case?

26

BIGGS

Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real

dog and pony show going on up there -

-  I'll tell you, sometimes white

people are a real puzzle to me.  I

mean, did this old guy really think

he was gonna be able to keep up with

a sweet little number like that?

DULANEY

It could've happened to anyone.

BIGGS

(ghetto accent)

I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever

heard of no brother dying from

gettin' too much pussy.

DULANEY

We have to find out who else would

profit from Marsh's death -- and who

knew enough about his personal life

to know that putting cocaine in the

nasal spray would be fatal.

BIGGS

So -- where do we start?

DULANEY

I want you to hit all the dealers in

town.  Give them a list of people

close to Marsh and see if any of them

use.  Then I want you to check out a

Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in

Roseburg.

SECRETARY (VO)

Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson

on one.

DULANEY

(on the phone)

Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is

fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.

BIGGS

La Brasa?

27

DULANEY

(defensive)

I'm taking a client to lunch.  Where

should I go, Taco Bell?

DULANEY

How'd you meet Marsh?

REBECCA

I was at a cocktail party.  Very

trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on

business.  He had broken his wrist

the week before and was wearing it in

a sling.  He looked so helpless.

DULANEY

-- And then?

REBECCA

We started talking.  In fact, we

talked until four in the morning.  We

discovered we shared a lot of the

same interests.  After that we were

together all the time until he left.

He used to call me every night after

he came back.  Then after a few weeks

he invited me to come visit him.

I've never left.

DULANEY

Why didn't you live together?

28

REBECCA

Andrew was worried about how it would

look.

REBECCA

Can we get out of here?

DULANEY

Sure.  Where to?

DULANEY

This is your house.

REBECCA

(walking towards the

door)

I know.

DULANEY

I don't think this is a good idea.

REBECCA

Why not?

DULANEY

Because, I'm your attorney.  I

shouldn't be going to your house.

REBECCA

Is it against the law?

DULANEY

No -- it just doesn't look right.

REBECCA

No one's looking.

29

REBECCA

What do you think?

DULANEY

I think the photographer's probably a

voyeur.

REBECCA

I'm the photographer.

DULANEY

Oh -- Well, they're different.

REBECCA

That's not an answer.

DULANEY

It's not my taste.

REBECCA

(seductively)

Tastes can change.

REBECCA

There you are.

30

REBECCA

What are you thinking?

DULANEY

Nothing.

REBECCA

Not true.  Shall I tell you what you

were thinking?  You were wondering if

I was wearing anything under my

skirt.

REBECCA

I am.

REBECCA

Sorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass

you.

DULANEY

Yes you were.

SHARON

--he said it might be too expensive

to add another room.  He suggested we

might convert the garage into a guest

room.  He's going to check with the

contractor and let me know.  I'll let

you know how much and we can decide.

Alright?

31

SHARON

Is that alright, Frank?

DULANEY

Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be

right back.

REBECCA (VO)

Hello?

DULANEY

Hi.  It's Frank.

REBECCA (VO)

Hi, Frank.

DULANEY

(awkwardly)

I just wanted to see if my secretary

called to confirm your appointment

tomorrow.

REBECCA (VO)

Yes -- she did.

DULANEY

Great.  I'll see you at the office at

nine.

REBECCA (VO)

No -- not at the office.  I've got a

better idea.

REBECCA

I figured if we have to talk all day

we might as well do it someplace

nice.

32

(looks at the cabin)

Isn't it beautiful?

DULANEY

Yeah.

REBECCA

(sadly)

Andrew loved this old cabin.

(fondly remembering)

He always dreamed about moving to

Tahiti -- living in a hut and

becoming a beach-bum.

(a sad smile)

I could never imagine myself doing

that -- but somehow when he talked

about it, he made it sound so alive -

- so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes

and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the

world and it's problems behind.  I

wish he'd had a chance to do it.

REBECCA

(snapping out of it)

Sorry.

DULANEY

It's okay.

DULANEY

Tell me about Doctor Paley?

REBECCA

I hardly know him.  He wanted me and

he couldn't have me.

DULANEY

It's going to be hard to convince a

jury that he's testifying against you

in a murder trial because you blew

him off.

REBECCA

(confidently)

It won't be that hard.

33

REBECCA

Did you always want to be a lawyer?

DULANEY

No -- I wanted to be a professional

hockey player.

REBECCA

Really?

DULANEY

Yeah.

REBECCA

That seems so far away from who you

are now.  What happened?

DULANEY

I broke my ankle skating.  That ended

that dream.

REBECCA

It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't

it?  To let go of what you want?

REBECCA

I'm going to put the car away.  You

can let yourself in.  There's a key

under the flower pot.

34

REBECCA

Yes -- it would be nice.

DULANEY

What would?

REBECCA

You and me -- making love.

DULANEY

Is that what you think I was

thinking?

REBECCA

No -- that's what I know you were

thinking.

REBECCA

How often do you make love to your

wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes

twice?  There once was passion,

wasn't there?  But now it's bland,

predictable.  Tell me, when you do it

-- do you always think of her?  Or do

you wonder what it would be like to

be with someone else?  Someone wild.

Someone who would force you to lose

control.

REBECCA

(continuing)

There's nothing wrong in admitting

that you want me, Frank.

DULANEY

You take a lot for granted.

35

REBECCA

Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to

be alone.  I don't expect anything

from you -- no demands -- no

complications.  I just need to feel

close to someone.

REBECCA

I'll be back in a minute.  Help

yourself to a drink.

36

REBECCA

(whispering)

My way.

REBECCA

My way.

37

BIGGS

Before you ask there's nothing new on

the coke.

DULANEY

You've got to get me something I can

use, Charlie.

BIGGS

I'm trying.

SATTLER

Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from

the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you

a few questions.

MAN

It's an incredible story going on

here.

(as if quoting a

headline)

Woman accused of using sex to kill

lover.

BIGGS

I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole

new meaning to the state nickname.

MAN

(confused)

What's the state nickname?

DULANEY

(dryly)

The Beaver State.

38

JOANNE

I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.

He was a good man -- until she came

along.

DULANEY

What changed?

JOANNE

He did.  Look, I know you can lead a

horse to water but you can't make him

drink -- but you hold a pail of water

in front of an old horse for long

enough  -- and well...

DULANEY

You don't really believe what the

district attorney is saying about

Miss Lawson, do you?

JOANNE

I don't know.  It's incredible to

think that anyone could be capable of

doing that -- but if anyone could it

would be Rebecca.

DULANEY

I take it you don't like Miss Lawson

very much?

JOANNE

I really don't know her that well.

We would say hello to each other when

I would come to the house, but that

was about it.

DULANEY

If you don't know her that well what

makes you think she's capable of

murder?

JOANNE

Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but

he was thirty years older than her.

Where's the attraction to sleep with

someone like that -- to have the kind

of sex they had.

39

DULANEY

How do you know what kind of sex they

had?

JOANNE

I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole

if that's what you're thinking.  I'd

come to house sometimes to pick up

papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find

their little toys all over the place.

DULANEY

Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

JOANNE

No.

DULANEY

What about Miss Lawson?

JOANNE

Yes -- cocaine.

DULANEY

How do you know that?

JOANNE

I was at the house one morning -- I

thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with

Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the

guest bathroom she was standing in

front of the mirror pouring this

white powder out of a vial.

JOANNE

Is something wrong.

DULANEY

What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for

your time.

40

DULANEY

You lied to me!

REBECCA

What?

DULANEY

I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told

me she saw you doing cocaine at

Marsh's house!

REBECCA

She's mistaken.

DULANEY

(Yelling)

That's not good enough, Goddamit!

REBECCA

It isn't true.  You have to believe

me.

DULANEY

No, I don't have to believe you.  The

jury has to believe you and answers

like he's lying or she's mistaken

aren't going to convince them.

REBECCA

I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she

says she saw me doing it she's lying.

DULANEY

Why would she lie?

REBECCA

I don't know, Frank -- but don't you

think that's something we should find

out?

41

DULANEY

Michael -- get off the phone.

MICHAEL

Why?

DULANEY

(impatiently)

Because I'm expecting a call.

MICHAEL

-- But it's Sunday.

DULANEY

(snapping)

I know what day it is!  Get off the

phone.

MICHAEL

(hurt; into phone)

I gotta go.  I'll call you later.

REBECCA'S VOICE

This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in

right now.  So if you please leave a

message--

DULANEY

I called you all weekend.  Where were

you?

REBECCA

I went out on the boat.

42

DULANEY

(concerned)

Alone?

REBECCA

Of course.

JUDGE BURNHAM

This trial by its very nature is

explosive.  The press is going to

have a field day and I will not

tolerate any activity in my courtroom

that will fuel it.

(to Dulaney and

Cardenas)

Both of you are going to be delving

into very personal aspects of peoples

lives.  I warn you now.  When you do

so -- if you cannot establish a clear

line of relevancy early on in your

examinations I will stop you.  Is

that clear?

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Cardenas.

CARDENAS

(points to Rebecca)

You all can see the defendant,

Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial

proceeds you will see that she is not

only the defendant -- she is the

murder weapon itself.

43

(stops and thinks for

a moment)

Is that possible?  Can a person

actually be a weapon?  The answer is

yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I

am the cause of your death.  But can

sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And

what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson

made of it.  The State will prove

that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh

-- that she put increasing sexual

demands on him while she secretly

administered cocaine.  All the while

knowing that he had a severe heart

condition.

(beat)

She is a beautiful woman -- but when

this trial is over you will see her

no differently than a gun, or a knife

or any other instrument used as a

weapon.  She is a killer.  And the

worst kind -- one who disguised

herself as a loving partner.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney?

DULANEY

I know what you're thinking -- and

it's a mistake.  You look at Miss

Lawson and you see a beautiful woman

who was involved with an older man --

and you think she looks like the

type.  She could've done it.  And

that's exactly what the District

Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,

she is beautiful.  So what?  Does

that make her a killer?  Of course

not.  This case is not about

appearances.  It's about facts.

(beat)

As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you

will see that there are very few

facts -- that the bulk of the States

evidence is circumstantial.  I'm

confident that by the conclusion of

this trial you will not just have a

reasonable doubt.  You will have no

doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson

is innocent of the charges against

her.

44

CARDENAS

Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of

death?

MCCURDY

A massive cardiac arrest.

CARDENAS

What was Mr. Marsh's physical

condition prior to his death?

MCCURDY

Very poor.  He was suffering from

severe arterial disease.

CARDENAS

Was the heart attack the result of

natural causes?

MCCURDY

No.

CARDENAS

What induced it?

MCCURDY

We found a high concentration of

cocaine in his blood.

CARDENAS

So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

MCCURDY

I don't think so.  The membrane in

his nasal passage didn't show any

sign of long time usage.

CARDENAS

Then how did it get into his body?

MCCURDY

We found a bottle of Dristan nasal

spray on the nightstand.  It was

filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.

Marsh had a head cold at the time of

his death.  I believe he wasn't aware

that he was ingesting cocaine.

45

CARDENAS

Is this the bottle that was found on

the nightstand?

MCCURDY

(examines it)

Yes.

CARDENAS

Your Honor, the State enters this

evidence as exhibit A.

(to McCurdy)

Were any fingerprints found on the

bottle?

MCCURDY

Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb

print of Miss Lawson's.

CARDENAS

Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to

someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

MCCURDY

Increase his heart rate.

CARDENAS

-- And if he were in the midst of

making love while under the influence

of cocaine?

MCCURDY

It would be an added stress to his

heart.

CARDENAS

What would be the effect if someone

secretly administered cocaine to Mr.

Marsh and then induced him to make

love?

MCCURDY

It would be the same as shooting a

gun at him.

CARDENAS

Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.

(to Dulaney)

Your witness.

46

DULANEY

Can you say with any certainty that

Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine

himself?

MCCURDY

No -- but it seems highly unlikely

that a man in his condition would use

cocaine.

DULANEY

That's your opinion, Doctor -- but

I'm asking you if there is any

scientific test that can tell who

actually put the cocaine into the

Dristan bottle?

MCCURDY

No.

DULANEY

Thank you.

CARDENAS

Doctor Trammel, when did you first

diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart

disease?

DR. TRAMMEL

About a year and half ago.

CARDENAS

Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle

after that?

DR. TRAMMEL

Yes -- he stopped smoking and

drinking and exercised regularly.

CARDENAS

He did everything he could to take

care of his heart?

DR. TRAMMEL

Yes.

47

CARDENAS

Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.

Marsh to your office?

DR. TRAMMEL

Yes.

CARDENAS

Just one last question.  What does

the sign on your office door say?

DR. TRAMMEL

Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

DULANEY

Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to

Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's

condition?

DR. TRAMMEL

No.

DULANEY

Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he

had spoken to Miss Lawson about his

illness?

DR. TRAMMEL

No.

DULANEY

Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.

Marsh inside during his examinations?

DR. TRAMMEL

No.

DULANEY

Then you have no way of knowing what

Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the

reasons for his visits?

DR. TRAMMEL

No.  No, I don't.

48

CARDENAS

How long were you Mr Marsh's personal

secretary?

JOANNE

Six years.

CARDENAS

Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use

Cocaine?

JOANNE

No -- never.

CARDENAS

What about Miss Lawson?

JOANNE

Yes.

CARDENAS

Tell the court about that, please.

JOANNE

I opened the bathroom door one day

and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine

out of a vial.

CARDENAS

Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before

his death?

JOANNE

Yes.

CARDENAS

How did he look?

JOANNE

Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

CARDENAS

Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

JOANNE

Yes.

CARDENAS

What did Mr. Marsh say?

49

JOANNE

He was worried.  He said that she was

acting stranger and stranger.  He

said that if this kept up she was

going to kill him.  That his heart

couldn't take it.

CARDENAS

Thank you.

(to Dulaney)

Your witness.

DULANEY

How do you know it was cocaine that

Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

JOANNE

What other kind of white powder do

people keep in a vial?

DULANEY

Do you remember the date when you saw

Miss Lawson in the bathroom?

JOANNE

Yes--

(thinks a moment)

It was on a Friday.  I remember

because I was going to visit my

sister for her birthday.  It would be

October twenty-eighth.

DULANEY

Could you repeat the last part of

what Mr. Marsh said to you the day

before his death?

JOANNE

He said that if it kept up she was

going to kill him.  That his heart

couldn't take it.

DULANEY

Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that

Miss Lawson felt bored here and was

thinking about going back to Chicago

for awhile?

50

JOANNE

Yes -- he mentioned it.

DULANEY

So, the woman he loved passionately

was thinking about leaving.  That

must cause tremendous anxiety.

Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

JOANNE

I suppose.

DULANEY

So, isn't it possible that he was

confiding in you about the pain he

was feeling about losing what might

be his last chance for love?  That

what he really was saying was that

the uncertainty of her leaving was

driving him crazy and if it didn't

stop it was going to kill him.  That

if she did leave his heart couldn't

take it.

JOANNE

I don't know.  I'm not sure.

DULANEY

Well, think about it.  Isn't it

possible?

JOANNE

(begrudgingly)

Yes.  I suppose it's possible.

REBECCA

You were brilliant today.

DULANEY

It's only the beginning.

51

REBECCA

Strong endings start with strong

beginnings.

(growing excitement)

I love the way you twist what people

say around --  manipulating their own

words against them.

DULANEY

Can I see you later?

REBECCA

You can see me now.

DULANEY

What are you doing?

REBECCA

I want you inside me.

REBECCA

Something wrong?

DULANEY

Paley could be a problem tomorrow.

52

REBECCA

I'm sure you'll be able to handle

him.

DULANEY

I'm glad you have such confidence in

me.

REBECCA

Don't worry about Paley.  He can't

touch me.  No one can.  I've thought

it all out.

DULANEY

(sits up; very

concerned)

What does that mean?  You've been

thinking about the case?  Or you

thought everything out before you

killed Marsh?

DULANEY

I'm sorry.

(she doesn't look at

him)

Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really.

REBECCA

Sugar or honey?

DULANEY

Honey.

53

CARDENAS

The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.

CARDENAS

Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

DR. PALEY

At a dinner party -- about eight

months ago.

CARDENAS

Did you ever see her again after

that?

DR. PALEY

Yes -- several times.

CARDENAS

What eventually happened to your

relationship with Miss Lawson?

DR. PALEY

We stopped seeing each other.

CARDENAS

Why?

DR. PALEY

Well -- I realized that she wasn't

interested in me.  She was just

trying to get information out of me.

54

CARDENAS

What kind of information?

DR. PALEY

She said that she was working on a

novel and she wanted to know what

kinds of drugs would be harmful to

someone with a bad heart.

CARDENAS

Did you suggest any?

DR. PALEY

Yes -- Insulin and others.

CARDENAS

What did she say?

DR. PALEY

She said that those weren't any good

-- because their use would be

detected and the police would know

the victim had been poisoned.  She

wanted to know if there was a drug

that would induce a heart attack but

could also be used to enhance a

sexual high.

CARDENAS

-- And what did you suggest?

DR. PALEY

Cocaine.

CARDENAS

(to Dulaney)

Your witness.

DULANEY

Dr. Paley, where were you the last

time you saw Miss Lawson?

DR. PALEY

We had dinner at a restaurant.

55

DULANEY

Isn't it true that later that night

you tried to force yourself on Miss

Lawson in the parking lot?

DR. PALEY

No.

DULANEY

You didn't grab her and try to kiss

her?

DR. PALEY

No.

DULANEY

If necessary I can bring in the valet

parking attendant and two customers

who witnessed the occurrence.

DR. PALEY

Well -- as I remember it, we had an

argument.

DULANEY

And the argument was about the fact

that you wanted to be romantically

involved and she did not.

DR. PALEY

(hesitantly)

Yes.

DULANEY

And after that didn't you

continuously harass Miss Lawson?

DR. PALEY

No.

DULANEY

Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss

Lawson's answering machine.  I would

like to play it now.

CARDENAS

Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know

where this tape is from.  Who made it

-- or under what circumstances it was

made.

56

DULANEY

These are reports from two

independent audio labs.  They each

state that the voices were recorded

over the phone and that no

alterations have been made.

JUDGE BURNHAM

I'll allow it.

DR. PALEY'S VOICE

Rebecca -- I know you're there,

Godammit.  Answer the phone, you

bitch!  You can't treat me like this!

DR. PALEY'S VOICE

You want to play games with me?  Who

the fuck do you think you are? Okay -

- we'll play.  You'll be sorry.

DULANEY

(quoting)

You'll be sorry?

DR. PALEY

I was angry.

DULANEY

You're still angry, aren't you?

Isn't it true that your whole story

is nothing more than a vindictive

attempt on your behalf to get back at

Miss Lawson?

DR. PALEY

No -- she asked me about cocaine.

DULANEY

I suggest it never happened.

57

DR. PALEY

(angrily)

You can suggest anything you want.

It happened.

DULANEY

No further questions.

DR. PALEY

I may have been infatuated with her -

- but I wouldn't perjure myself.

DULANEY

That's all Dr. Paley.

DULANEY

What the...  What are you doing?

DULANEY

(nervously)

Rebecca -- take these off.

REBECCA

Tonight we open new doors.

58

DULANEY

What are you going you doing?

REBECCA

Are you scared?

REBECCA

(whispering)

I love you, Frank.  I love your

strength -- be strong for me now.

DULANEY

(pleading)

Rebecca -- please.  No more.

REBECCA

I told you in the beginning that it

was my way.  My way can be many

things -- pleasure or pain.

REBECCA

You see how life is, Frank?  We judge

things.  We look at things from the

outside and assume we know what's on

the inside.

59

REBECCA

Water.  But you assumed it was

vinegar -- because you were only

looking at the outside.

SHARON

Late night?

DULANEY

Yeah -- what are you doing up?

SHARON

We have to talk.

DULANEY

What's wrong?

SHARON

That's what I was hoping you'd tell

me.

DULANEY

Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the

point?

SHARON

Where have you been?

60

DULANEY

Working.  Charlie and I were going

over some statements.

SHARON

Charlie called at eleven thirty

looking for you.

(beat)

You were with her, weren't you?

DULANEY

Yes.

SHARON

Why did you lie to me?

DULANEY

Because I knew you'd think exactly

what you're thinking.

SHARON

This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to

turn this around on me.

DULANEY

I'm not.

SHARON

You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

DULANEY

No.

SHARON

It's bad enough that you are.  It's

even worse that you can stand here

and lie to me.

DULANEY

Sharon...

SHARON

You bastard!  Do you think I'm some

kind of idiot?  That I don't have

fuckin' eyes.  I see.  I feel.  I

hurt.

61

CARDENAS

Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's

maid for nine years?

ESTER

Yes.

CARDENAS

Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever

argue?

ESTER

Like cats and dogs.

CARDENAS

What did they argue about?

ESTER

You name it -- they argued about it.

Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her

happy -- but it seemed that no matter

what he did it was never enough for

her.

CARDENAS

Did they argue the day before he

died?

ESTER

Well -- he died on a Sunday and I

have the weekends off -- but they

were ripping at each other with both

barrels Friday afternoon.

CARDENAS

What was the nature of the argument?

ESTER

Sex.

CARDENAS

Could you be more specific?

62

ESTER

She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man

-- making discourteous insinuations

about his sexual abilities.  She said

that she had needs and that if he

couldn't fulfill them she'd find

someone who could.

CARDENAS

Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use

cocaine?

ESTER

No -- never.

CARDENAS

(to Dulaney)

Your witness.

DULANEY

Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

ESTER

No.

DULANEY

High school?

ESTER

No.

CARDENAS

Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs

Crawford's educational background has

to do with this case.

DULANEY

I was just about to make my point,

Your Honor.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.

DULANEY

(reading from note

pad)

"Discourteous insinuations about his

sexual abilities."  Who told you to

say that?

63

DULANEY

Did Mr. Troxell help you with that

phrase?

ESTER

I heard him say it.

DULANEY

Then -- those are not your own words?

ESTER

No.

DULANEY

What else did the District Attorney's

Office tell you to say?

CARDENAS

Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that

Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell

reconstruct her sentence and decided

to rephrase her words in a more

intelligent manner for the court

doesn't mean the incident never

happened.

DULANEY

(to Cardenas)

I'm just curious to see if Mr.

Troxell reconstructed anything else.

CARDENAS

Your Honor -- please!

JUDGE BURNHAM

I'll see both of you in my chambers.

Right now.

64

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney, before you cast

aspersions on the District Attorney's

Office by suggesting they've coaxed

this witness to say things that

aren't true -- you better have more

than a hunch.  Do you?

DULANEY

No, Your Honor.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Maybe you don't know what it's like

where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but

I do.  I came from a neighborhood

just like hers.  This is a whole

other world for her.  She's a poor

working woman who has been thrust

into a room full of highly educated

and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,

she puts on her best dress, fixes her

hair and tries to present herself as

intelligently as possible.

(beat)

Being poor and having pride is not a

crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you

attempt to impeach another witness'

testimony in my courtroom -- your

foundations better be based on

something other than semantics.

CARDENAS

I'm surprised you can walk after the

way Burnham chewed your ass out this

afternoon.

DULANEY

(coldly)

I've got work to do.

CARDENAS

Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's

between rounds.

DULANEY

I didn't hear it.

65

CARDENAS

What's happening to you, Frank?

You're acting like you're on trial

here.  This has become personal to

you.

DULANEY

Back off, John.

CARDENAS

You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

DULANEY

That's ridiculous.

CARDENAS

I'm talking to you as a friend now.

Don't ruin your life, your career for

her.  She'll spit you out when this

is over.

DULANEY

You don't know what you're talking

about.

CARDENAS

Really?  What does an attorney speak

to his client about at her house

until three o'clock in the morning?

DULANEY

You've been following me?

CARDENAS

Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm

building a case against her,

remember?

CARDENAS

If your head wasn't up your ass you

would have thought of it too.  You're

losing perspective.  Get out while

you can -- before she takes you down

with her.

66

BIGGS

I've been waiting for you to get

back.

DULANEY

You got something on the coke?

BIGGS

No -- but I got something.

BIGGS

During lunch I was watching some of

Marsh's home videos.

BIGGS

He was really into recording this

stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box

full of tapes.

BIGGS

This girl has really got some moves,

huh?

DULANEY

If you want to get your kicks go to a

video store and rent a porno movie.

BIGGS

This tape was recorded over an

existing recording.

67

DULANEY

Over what?

BIGGS

I would have missed it -- but the

phone rang and I let it play while I

talked.  It looks like blank tape --

but it isn't.  It's been erased

without any input signal coming in.

DULANEY

So, what good is it to us if it's

been erased?

BIGGS

It's very good -- because when the

D.A's office saw it they assumed it

was the end of the tape, otherwise

they would have buried it.

DULANEY

Why?

BIGGS

Because it hasn't all been erased.

DULANEY

(quoting Joanne)

Where's the attraction to sleep with

someone like that.

DULANEY

I need to speak with you.

68

JOANNE

I don't think we have anything more

to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

DULANEY

You were sleeping with Marsh.

JOANNE

Who told you that?

DULANEY

He video taped you.

JOANNE

That bastard!

DULANEY

I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

JOANNE

Yes, I slept with him but that was a

long time ago.

DULANEY

You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a

cast on the tape.  It was right

before he went to Chicago and met

Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,

didn't he?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

It must have been horrible.  Having

to go there -- seeing them together -

- knowing he was sleeping with her in

the same bed he did with you.

JOANNE

I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.

He switched me off like a little toy

he was finished playing with.  But I

didn't kill him.

69

JOANNE

(continuing)

I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.

Killing Andrew wasn't in my best

interest.  As it is I'm out of a job

and I'm not in his will.

DULANEY

Money isn't the only reason people

commit murder, Miss Braslow.

CARDENAS

The State calls Jeffery Roston.

DULANEY

Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston

listed as a prosecution witness.

CARDENAS

The State's investigation just

uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday

afternoon in Chicago.

CARDENAS

Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover

of Miss Lawson's.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Why didn't the State's investigation

uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

CARDENAS

He was away on an extended vacation

and just returned two days ago.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Alright -- I'm going to allow his

testimony.

70

DULANEY

But Your Honor--

JUDGE BURNHAM

That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

CARDENAS

Mr. Roston, what was your

relationship with Miss Lawson?

ROSTON

We were lovers.

CARDENAS

How long were you together?

ROSTON

For about one year.

CARDENAS

How would you describe your sex life

with Miss Lawson?

ROSTON

Intense.

CARDENAS

I know this is a very personal

subject, but could you be a little

more specific?

ROSTON

It was wild.  She was constantly

trying to get me more and more worked

up -- kinky things.  I tried to

satisfy her the best I could, but it

was difficult in my condition.

CARDENAS

What kind of condition are you

referring to?

ROSTON

I had a bad heart.

71

CARDENAS

What happened next?

ROSTON

I had bypass surgery.

CARDENAS

And how are you now?

ROSTON

Fine.  The doctors say if I keep

taking care of myself I can live to

be a very old man.

CARDENAS

How did your relationship with Miss

Lawson progress after the surgery?

ROSTON

It didn't.

CARDENAS

Why not?

ROSTON

She left me.

CARDENAS

Why did she say she was leaving?

ROSTON

She didn't.  She just left.

CARDENAS

Why do you think she left you?

ROSTON

Well -- I think that after the

operation she realized that...

72

DULANEY

Objection.  The question calls for a

conclusion on the part of the

witness.

CARDENAS

Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the

defendant for many months.  I feel

that his opinion is valid in

substantiating the character of the

Miss Lawson.

DULANEY

The opinion of a scorned lover is

hardly an objective view.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Objection sustained.

CARDENAS

Did Miss Lawson ever give you any

indication why she was leaving?

DULANEY

Objection.  The witness has already

stated that Miss Lawson left without

an explanation.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on

to another line of questioning.

CARDENAS

When you say your sexual relations

with Miss Lawson were intense what

exactly do you mean?

ROSTON

It was like she was trying to push me

as far as she could.  She called it

opening new doors.

CARDENAS

Can you give the court an example?

ROSTON

It was like sex was a game to her.

She got off on the control.  She

always used to tell me it had to be

her way.

73

ROSTON

(continuing)

It's hard to resist a woman as

beautiful as she is.

CARDENAS

What would she do that made it hard

to resist?

ROSTON

She's a woman who is very much aware

of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I

felt she could read my mind.  It was

uncanny how she knew exactly what I

wanted.  A few nights before my heart

surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had

handcuffed me to the bed.

ROSTON

She told me that tonight we were

going to open new doors.  I asked her

to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,

but she wouldn't listen.

CARDENAS

What did she say?

CARDENAS

Mr. Roston I know this is difficult

for you, but it's important you tell

the court what she did.

ROSTON

She said she was going to fuck me

like I've never been fucked before.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Due to the sensitive nature of this

witness' testimony and the inability

of the spectators to allow him to

complete it, I am clearing the

courtroom.

74

CARDENAS

What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

ROSTON

She started touching herself and

telling me how much she wanted me.

She reached down and put me inside

her.  My doctor had warned me about

exerting myself -- but you really

don't think of those things at a

moment like that.  You just think

about how beautiful this woman is --

how much you want her.  How deeply

you want to please her.

(beat)

At first it started off slowly -- but

the rhythm built and built.    Every

time I got close to an orgasm she

would stop.  Eventually I started to

have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just

kept going -- faster and faster.  No

matter what I said she wouldn't stop.

I really thought for a moment I was

going to die.

CARDENAS

If you knew it was bad for you why

did you do it?

ROSTON

I couldn't help myself.  You get lost

inside a women like her.  It was like

a drug.  It was the best sex I ever

had.

CARDENAS

What happened after that?

ROSTON

I woke up the next morning and she

was gone.

CARDENAS

Did you change your will while you

were with Miss Lawson?

75

ROSTON

Yes.

CARDENAS

Who was your primary beneficiary?

ROSTON

She was.

CARDENAS

Thank you.  The State rests.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mister Dulaney?

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mister Dulaney?

DULANEY

Mr. Roston, you said it was the best

sex you ever had.  Is that the best

sex with a woman, or a man?

CARDENAS

Objection!

DULANEY

I'll rephrase the question.  Mr.

Roston isn't it true you are

bisexual?

CARDENAS

Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual

preferences are not at issue in this

trial.

DULANEY

Your Honor, I'm trying to establish

the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson

felt when she discovered the man she

lived with was a different person

than she thought he was.

76

JUDGE BURNHAM

The witness will answer the question.

DULANEY

Mr. Roston?

ROSTON

Yes.

DULANEY

And your sexual tastes were something

that you hid from Miss Lawson?

ROSTON

Yes.

DULANEY

And didn't Miss Lawson come home one

day and find you in bed with your

male lover?

ROSTON

Yes.

DULANEY

And she left shortly after that?

ROSTON

No.  We worked things out.  It was

three weeks later when I told her

about the heart surgery that she

left.

DULANEY

Would it be fair to say that when she

did find out it was a shock to her?

ROSTON

(very upset)

Yes.

DULANEY

No further questions.

77

DULANEY

What's that for?

REBECCA

To celebrate how masterfully you

destroyed Roston today.

DULANEY

Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life

in open court.

REBECCA

(suddenly ice cold)

Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

DULANEY

He was only doing what he thought was

right.

REBECCA

You're too weak, Frank.  When you

want something you have to do what-

ever it takes to get it.  If

something gets in your way you remove

it.

DULANEY

You killed him -- didn't you?

REBECCA

I knew you were thinking that.  I

could see it in your eyes today in

the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.

I need you to believe that.

DULANEY

You don't need anybody.

REBECCA

I do need you.  No matter what you

think of me -- I didn't do it.

78

(beat)

I could see the looks on the juror's

faces.  To the men I represent what

they can never have.  I'm a cold,

heartless bitch -- and this is their

chance for pay-back for every woman

that's ever blown them off in a bar.

To the old women I'm a vulgar whore

and to the young ones I remind them

of what they'll never be.  It doesn't

matter to them that I'm innocent.

They've already convicted me.

DULANEY

I'm dropping the case.

REBECCA

(matter of factly)

No -- you're not.

REBECCA

It gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you

open the door it never closes.

79

REBECCA

I've got another copy.  How do you

think your wife would feel if she saw

this -- not to mention your

colleagues?

REBECCA

You can think whatever you want,

Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,

and I'm not going to prison for

something I didn't do.

DULANEY

You're a monster.

REBECCA

No -- I'm a survivor.

DULANEY

I'll get it.

BIGGS

I'm sorry to barge in -- but I

figured after that bombshell that got

laid on you today you could use some

good news?

DULANEY

You got something on the Coke?

BIGGS

Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers

I put the word out to.  He's been

following the trial pretty closely.

He said at one time he wanted to be a

lawyer before he became a dealer.

80

DULANEY

Charlie -- are you going to make a

point soon?

BIGGS

Right now.  Guess who's been buying

Coke from him for the last five and

half years?

BIGGS

Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.

DULANEY

Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do

you practice?

DR. WONG

Oriental medicine.

DULANEY

--And is Miss Lawson a patient of

yours?

DR. WONG

Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a

year.

DULANEY

Why does she come to you?

DR. WONG

She suffers from severe menstrual

cramps.

81

DULANEY

Did you ever prescribe any medication

for her cramps?

DR. WONG

Yes.

DULANEY

What did you prescribe for her?

DR. WONG

Chinese peony root.

DULANEY

Would you describe for the court what

Chinese peony root looks like?

DR. WONG

It's a white powder that comes in a

vial.

DULANEY

How do you instruct your patients to

take it?

DR. WONG

I tell them to pour an amount the

size of a quarter into the their hand

and mix it with water.

DULANEY

A previous witness stated that she

saw Miss Lawson pouring a white

powder into her hand on October

twenty-eighth.  According to your

records when did you prescribe the

drug?

DR. WONG

October twenty-seventh.

DULANEY

One last question, Doctor.  If

someone didn't know better, would it

be easy to mistake the peony root for

cocaine?

DR. WONG

Yes -- quite easy.

82

DULANEY

(to Cardenas)

Your witness.

CARDENAS

No questions.

JUDGE BURNHAM

You may call your next witness.

DULANEY

The defense calls Miss Margaret

Sellers.

DULANEY

Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan

Paley?

MISS SELLERS

Yes.

DULANEY

Where did you meet him?

MISS SELLERS

I'm a nurse.  I used to work at

Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr.

Paley's on staff there.

DULANEY

What was the nature of your

relationship with Dr. Paley.

MISS SELLERS

We dated for about a month last year.

DULANEY

Then what happened?

MISS SELLERS

I realized he wasn't serious.  He was

seeing other women -- asking other

nurses at the hospital out, so I

ended it.

83

DULANEY

-- And what did Dr. Paley do after

you stopped seeing him?

MISS SELLERS

He used to call me -- tell me that I

couldn't just walk out on him.  He

said that if I didn't come back he'd

make my life miserable.

DULANEY

Did he make your life miserable?

MISS SELLERS

Yes -- he did.

DULANEY

How?

CARDENAS

Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney

that the person on trial here is Miss

Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

DULANEY

Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a

pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with

women.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Objection overruled.  The witness

will answer the question.

MISS SELLERS

He'd call me in the middle of the

night.  Show up at my house and bang

on the door.  Finally after two weeks

I went to his office one day to tell

him to stop.

DULANEY

What did he say?

MISS SELLERS

He laughed -- and basically said he

would decide when it was over.

DULANEY

Do you remember his exact words?

84

MISS SELLERS

Yes.  He said, "If you want to play

games, we'll play -- and you'll be

sorry."

DULANEY

What happened next?

MISS SELLERS

While I was seeing Dr. Paley I

mentioned to him one night that

someone was stealing drugs from the

third floor dispensary.   Three days

after I spoke to him in his office he

went to the Head Nurse and told her

he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

DULANEY

What happened?

MISS SELLERS

There was an inquiry.  It was his

word against mine.  They believed

him.  I was fired.

BIGGS

Joanne Braslow is getting more and

more interesting.  I followed her

today to an attorney's office.

Joseph Koehler.

DULANEY

Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an

estate attorney -- and he's very

expensive.

BIGGS

What would Joanne Braslow need with

an estate attorney?  She wasn't even

mentioned in Marsh's will.

DULANEY

Not this will.

85

DULANEY

Here it is!  According to the old

will Joanne Braslow was to inherit

two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars.

BIGGS

What good does that do -- it's the

old will?

DULANEY

Under the law a person cannot profit

from their own wrong doing.  Since

Rebecca Lawson is the sole

beneficiary of the new will, if she

is found guilty the will is void and

Joanne Braslow could make a very good

case to have the old will reinstated.

BIGGS

She kills the old man and makes it

look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty

slick.

DULANEY

I was thinking that when the trial is

over we'd all go skiing for a

weekend.

SHARON

Maybe it would be a good idea if you

just took Michael.

DULANEY

(to himself)

Drug store.

86

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call

your next witness?

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?

DULANEY

Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls

Joanne Braslow.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you

that you are still under oath.

DULANEY

How often do you use cocaine?

CARDENAS

Objection, Your Honor.

JUDGE BURNHAM

(impatiently)

Counsel approach the bench.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of

seeing you this close to me.

CARDENAS

Whether or not Miss Braslow uses

drugs is not an issue here.

87

DULANEY

Your Honor -- the prosecution has

introduced cocaine as one of the

contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.

How it may have been introduced into

the household is of vital importance.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Are you able to back up this

allegation -- or are you fishing?

DULANEY

I can back it up.

JUDGE BURNHAM

You better.

(to Joanne)

Please answer the question.

JOANNE

I've tried it.

DULANEY

You've tried it?  Isn't it true that

you've been in and out of Rehab

centers for the last four years?

JOANNE

I've been to a few -- yes.

DULANEY

You don't like Miss Lawson much do

you?

JOANNE

(hesitantly)

No.

DULANEY

You don't like her because you were

involved with Mr. Marsh before she

came along.  Isn't that true?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

You resented the fact that she told

you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

JOANNE

Yes.

88

DULANEY

And you resented that he cared for

her in a way he once cared for you?

JOANNE

(breaking down)

Yes.

DULANEY

--And that Mr. Marsh paid less

attention to you?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

--and that he changed his will?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

In his previous will Mr. Marsh left

you two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why

do you think he did that?

JOANNE

She talked him into it.  She wanted

everything.

DULANEY

Two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars is a lot of money.  That must

have made you pretty angry?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

You testified that you returned to

Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock

the night of his murder.  Is that

correct?

89

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

Well - I'm a little confused.

(holds up the paper)

This is a charge receipt from Rosen's

Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an

account.  It's dated the day of the

murder.

(hands it to her)

Is this your signature?

JOANNE

(nervously studies

it)

Yes.

DULANEY

There's an item you picked up that's

marked.  Will you read it?

JOANNE

Dristan nasal spray.

DULANEY

Would you read for us the time of the

purchase?

JOANNE

Three fifteen.

DULANEY

A.M -- or P.M.?

JOANNE

P.M.

DULANEY

You see that's what bothers me.  No

other bottle of nasal spray was found

in the house.  The police looked.

There was only the one bottle.  But

you say you didn't arrive until after

Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he

was using the nasal spray prior to

his death.  How do you think it got

there?

JOANNE

I don't know.

90

DULANEY

Isn't it true that you stopped by the

house after you left the drug store

and dropped off the items you bought?

JOANNE

(nervously)

No.

DULANEY

Isn't it true that you put the

cocaine in the bottle?

JOANNE

No!  Why would I want to kill him?

DULANEY

Because you were jealous.  Because he

cut you out of the will.  Because you

have a cocaine habit to feed --

because you know that if Rebecca

Lawson is found guilty the new will

is void -- and there's a very good

chance the old one would be honored.

DULANEY

The defense rests.

SHARON

We can't go on like this, Frank.

DULANEY

I know.

SHARON

Talk to me.

SHARON

Please -- this is ripping us apart.

91

DULANEY

(emotionally)

I can't talk about it now.

SHARON

Don't shut me out.  Let me in.

DULANEY

You wouldn't like what you'd see.

You don't know me anymore.  I don't

know me anymore.

SHARON

We can't pretend this isn't

happening.

DULANEY

Please -- not now.

SHARON

Why didn't you come to me?

DULANEY

I don't know.

SHARON

You used to like to touch me -- to

make love to me.

DULANEY

It's more involved than that.

SHARON

It was a place to start.

DULANEY

You think that's the answer?  Sex?

Is that what you want?  You want me

to make love to you?

SHARON

I don't want our lives ruined because

of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want

this to work -- but you have to help

me.  You have to come back from where

ever it is you are.

92

SHARON

(screaming)

Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!

DULANEY

Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?

SHARON

Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

MICHAEL (OS)

(racked with fear)

Daddy -- stop it!

DULANEY

(softly)

Oh -- Jesus.

93

SHARON

Frank?

DULANEY

(ashamed)

I'm sorry.  God -- I'm so sorry.

DULANEY

Help me.  Please -- help me.

JUDGE BURNHAM

Mr. Dulaney.

DULANEY

The Prosecution's case is built on

theory -- speculation.  Could Rebecca

Lawson have done this?  Is it

possible that she did that? Where are

the facts?  The evidence.  The State

has presented two spurned lovers and

a jealous secretary.  Hardly what I

would call impartial witnesses.

Where is one shred of conclusive,

irrefutable evidence?  I don't see it

-- and I don't think you do either.

Do you know why?  Because there isn't

any.

94

(beat)

What's the issue here?  That Rebecca

Lawson likes wild sex?  No.  But the

District Attorney is trying to make

you think if Rebecca Lawson could

stray from the path of normal,

accepted sexual behavior, then she

could be capable of murder.  Did she

force Andrew Marsh to make love to

her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?

No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and

why wouldn't he?  She's beautiful,

alluring -- the type of woman men

dream about.

DULANEY

It's human nature.  We want what we

want -- when we want it.  We don't

think about the consequences of our

actions.  When desire fills us we all

do things that we know are bad for

us.  We live for the moment.

(beat)

Here was an exciting young woman who

unlocked doors.  Doors that led into

a new world.  A world he entered

willingly -- eagerly.  He wanted to

please her -- and so, he did not tell

her of his illness.  I know it might

be difficult for you to understand

wanting something so badly that you

are willing to risk everything -- but

that's what passion does to you.

It's a fire -- uncontrollable.  It

consumes you -- and the only thing

you can do is let it burn.  Andrew

Marsh let it burn.  It was his life -

- his choice -- and maybe his mistake

-- but making love is not a crime.

(beat)

We all have fires inside us -- secret

desires.  We guard them --hold them

in the cages that we've built.  When

someone comes along and opens the

gate, they rush out and feed blindly

on their pleasure.  Rebecca Lawson

loved Andrew Marsh.  She didn't kill

him -- if anything did, it was his

own passion.

95

CARDENAS

It's true -- we all have fires

burning inside us.  Rebecca Lawson

was very aware of the fire burning

inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked

those flames -- fanning them until

they burned so hot that reason and

judgement left him.  Is making love a

crime?  Of course not -- but the

question isn't as simple as that.

Rebecca Lawson used her seductive

qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.

She used sex as a catalyst and

cocaine as the terminus.  The

combination of the two provided the

conclusion of a premeditated act.

(beat)

She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.

Her fingerprints were found on the

nasal spray bottle that contained the

cocaine -- and she was the sole

beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.

She planned it from beginning to end.

She knew about his heart.  She

secretly administered cocaine, then

used wild and physically demanding

sex to induce a heart attack.

(beat)

Making love is an act of passion

between two people to affirm their

vows of love.  This was not an act of

love -- this was an act of greed.

This was betrayal.  Rebecca Lawson

killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm

counting on you to punish her for

that crime.

DULANEY

(to man)

They're back already?  It's only been

three hours.

96

JUDGE BURNHAM

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

have you reached a verdict?

JURY FOREMAN

We have, Your Honor.

COURT CLERK

The jury finds the defendant -- not

guilty.

BIGGS

What are you gonna do now?

97

DULANEY

Take some time off.

BIGGS

You think the D.A.'s gonna file on

Joanne?

DULANEY

I don't know.

DULANEY

You did a good job, Charlie.

BIGGS

Thanks, Mister D.

JOANNE

That bastard should have left me

something.  I worked for him for six

years -- and he goes and gives it all

to her.

JOANNE

You take what people say and make it

ugly.  You make others believe what

you want them to.  She should have

been found guilty.  She shouldn't

have gotten off.

DULANEY

Then you would have gotten your

money?

JOANNE

Yes.

DULANEY

You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?

98

JOANNE

Do you think if I did I'd be stupid

enough to tell you?

DULANEY

What do you have in your purse?

JOANNE

What do you think I've got?  A gun?

Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe

I'll blow your head off right now.

JOANNE

(crying)

I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're

gonna make it look like I did it.

They gotta put it on someone.

DULANEY

Why'd you come here?

JOANNE

(holds up the letter)

To show you this.  It's a letter from

that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to

me the day after I saw him.  He's the

one who told me I could get the money

if Miss Lawson went to jail.

DULANEY

You didn't know about it before that?

JOANNE

No.

DULANEY

Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler

in the first place?

JOANNE

Because he called me.

99

DULANEY

Hi, Joe.

KOEHLER

Frank -- what are you doing here?

DULANEY

I need to ask you a question.  What

made you get in touch with Joanne

Braslow?

KOEHLER

You know I can't talk about that.

DULANEY

I'm not asking for names or

specifics.  I just want to know what

prompted you to make the call?

KOEHLER

Sorry.

DULANEY

Please -- I need your help.

KOEHLER

All I can tell you is I was contacted

by an interested party on Miss

Braslow's behalf.

DULANEY

Hello?

REBECCA (VO)

Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see

you right away.  I've got the tape.

100

DULANEY

I'll be right there.

DULANEY

Rebecca?

REBECCA (OS)

Is this what you're looking for,

Frank?

DULANEY

(distant)

You killed him.  You killed him --

and I got you off.

REBECCA

That's crazy.

101

DULANEY

Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect,

wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on

the tape and find out about her coke

problem.  After that, the digging

should have been easy -- but we

missed the will.  You knew we were

following her, so you called Koehler

and had him contact her.  That put us

right back on track.  All we needed

then was to prove that she had an

opportunity.  The drug store took

care of that.  She dropped off the

stuff and you came back and killed

him.  Didn't you?

DULANEY

I want the tape.

REBECCA

I've been thinking about that.  I've

decided to give it to you after I've

collected the inheritance.  You can

take that one if you want -- but

there's another copy.

DULANEY

That wasn't the deal.

REBECCA

(provoking him)

So, sue me.

(as cold as ice)

Things have changed.  I think you

should go home -- and after you leave

I see no reason for us to ever have

contact again.

DULANEY

(growing angrier)

I'm not leaving without that tape.

REBECCA

Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose

my temper and send it out just for

spite.

102

DULANEY

You fuckin' bitch!

MAN'S VOICE

Let her go!

DR. PALEY

(to Rebecca)

Are you alright?

REBECCA

You've got to kill him, Alan.

DR. PALEY

What?

103

DULANEY

She's right, Paley.  You've got to

kill me.  She doesn't have to --

she's free -- she can't be tried

again -- but you, you planned it with

her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're

an accessory to murder.

REBECCA

Shoot him.

DULANEY

Don't you see what she's doing?  She

needs you to kill me.  She's planned

it that way from the start.  That's

why she phoned me tonight.

DR. PALEY

You called him?

REBECCA

No -- he's lying.

DULANEY

How's it supposed to work Rebecca?

You and Paley celebrate your victory.

You get me over here and provoke a

fight so he has to rush in and save

you -- but then he's given himself

away as your accomplice -- now he has

to kill me.

(to Paley)

After that I figure she'll tell the

Police that you broke in.  That you

were crazed because we humiliated you

in court?

REBECCA

Don't listen to him.  Can't you see

he's trying to turn you against me.

104

DULANEY

(continuing; to

Paley)

Here's the good part.  The truth dies

with me and she turns State's

evidence against you.  It won't

matter what you say.  No one will

believe your version -- you've

already discredited yourself in

court.  You'll go away forever and

she'll have the money all for

herself.  She's played us both

perfectly.

REBECCA

Alan, listen to me.  If you don't

kill him it's over.  Everything we

did will be for nothing.

DR. PALEY

Shut up, Rebecca.

DULANEY

She's good isn't she?  But maybe with

you it's the real thing.

(points to the

screen)

I'm sure all those nights she was

fuckin' me she was thinking of you.

DULANEY

I'm sure that every orgasm she had

with me was faked.

DR. PALEY

That's enough.

DULANEY

I mean she only screwed me two or

three times a night because she had

to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

REBECCA

(softly)

I love you, Alan.  You have to

believe I love you.  Kill him!  Kill

him and we can be together forever!

105

DULANEY

That's right, she loves you.  Just

like she loved Roston and Marsh and

me.  Don't be a fool.  You're nothing

to her.  The second you pull that

trigger she'll turn on you.

DR. PALEY

(to Rebecca)

I loved you.

REBECCA

(tense)

Alan, don't let him do this.  You're

everything to me.

(she moves closer)

Give me the gun.  Give me the gun and

I'll do it for you.

106

CARDENAS

Paley's confessed to the whole thing.

It's like he's got no will to live

now that she's gone.

(thinks for a moment)

She almost got away with it.  Ironic,

huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?

CARDENAS

Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.

Destiny.  We usually get what we

deserve in the end.

DULANEY

Can I go?

CARDENAS

(to Troxell)

You get his statement?

TROXELL

Yeah.

CARDENAS

Then you can go.

CARDENAS

Frank?

CARDENAS

I found this video in her room.  It

has your name on it.

CARDENAS

(holding it out)

I assume it's yours.

Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful

smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.

107

DULANEY

Thanks.

EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the

street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down

the street towards his car.

FADE TO BLACK
