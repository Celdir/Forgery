IKE (V.O.)

Hey, Fisher, pick up.  I have some

column ideas I want to bounce off you.

Not there?  Okay.  Listen I'm thinking

of writing about those mind-numbing

informercials that are always on.

IKE (cont'd)

What do you think?  Good idea, right?

Boring, down to death, pointless -- It

sucks.

IKE (cont'd)

If you guys are here any longer,

they're gonna make you sign a lease.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER

Your column should be so funny.

IKE

Okay, I was also thinking I might write

about...

IKE (cont'd)

Excuse me.  I was thinking of doing an

article on limousines.  What would you

say to people who never had a chance to

drive in a limo?

LADY

I'm sorry, I don't know any people like

that.

IKE

(into phone)

Fisher?  Come on -- I know you're

sitting there laughing at me.  Pick up.

I want to run an idea past you.

IKE (cont'd)

(into phone)

I just could use someone to toss it

back and forth with for a few minutes,

get the juice flowing, help me.  I have

an hour and twenty-seven minutes and

fifty-two seconds.  Hello?

T-SHIRT VENDOR

Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me

in an article?

IKE

When your t-shirts stop shrinking.

MAN

I see photos of a lot of dead writers

on these walls.  Got any living ones?

I have a story to tell that could win

one of them a Pulitzer.

(then, with enthusiasm)

Picture this, if you will.  A small

town in Maryland, a sleepy little

village, within that a hardware store...

WOMAN

So what's in store for us in tomorrow's

column?

IKE

I don't know yet.  I'm kind of a last-

minute man.  Ideas don't flow until an

hour or two before deadline.

WOMAN

(interrupting)

This is very interesting.  You get your

ideas for your column from life.  You

start up a conversation with a woman in

a bar, attack her choice of reading

material, try and get a rise out of her

while you contemplate whether or not

she's worth hitting on.

IKE

No, I can't hit on you until I get an

idea.

WOMAN

That's flattering.

IKE

No, you don't understand.

WOMAN

I think I do understand.  So my not

responding to your baiting me will

inspire one of those potential bitter

diatribes you love to write about women

and all the things we do to drive men

crazy?

IKE

(taken aback)

I don't write bitter diatribes about

women... very often.

WOMAN

Only when the ideas aren't flowing,

huh?  Well, it was very nice to meet

you, one-minute man.

IKE

(as she exits)

That's last minute man.

(then, louder)

And it's the quality that counts.

BARTENDER

You know, for a good looking man, you

strike out a lot.

MAN

I've seen much worse.

MAN (cont'd)

I said, I've seen much worse.

IKE

Excuse me?

MAN

The brush-off.

MAN (cont'd)

I've witnessed far more treacherous and

nefarious exits than that.  At least

she castigated you in private.

IKE

Not as private as I thought.

IKE (cont'd)

Kevin, you've got some napkins?

BARTENDER

Writing or wiping?

IKE

Give me a pen.

MAN

(throwing darts hard)

Ah, come on.  They deserve it.  They

love you, they hate you, they're hot,

they're cold, they're high, they're

low...

IKE

... They're up, they're down.  It's

really fun making this list with you,

but I've got a column to go write.

BARTENDER

Ike.

MAN

(undeterred)

But you don't have a really superb idea!

Well, there's a girl from my hometown

you could write about.

BARTENDER

(to Man)

Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas.

MAN

She likes to dump grooms right at the

altar.  They call her "The Runaway

Bride".

MAN

She performed the travesty seven or

eight times.  Right at the altar she

turns around and runs like hell.

Bolts.

MAN (cont'd)

Adios.  Plows down the aisle, knocking

old ladies out of her way like the

running of the bulls at Pamplona.  And

guess what?

IKE

I give up.

MAN

She has the next victim all lined up.

She's twirling another body on the

spit.

MAN

(beginning his story)

Imagine if you will, a small town in

Maryland...

IKE

(reading)

"Today is a day of profound

introspection, I have been accused

of using this column to direct bitter

diatribes at the opposite sex!  This

uncomfortable accusation has plunged me

into at least fifteen minutes of

serious reflection, from which I have

emerged with the conclusion that, yes

-- I traffic in female stereotypes."

FISHER

"But how can one blame me when every

time I step out my front door I meet

fresh proof that the female archetypes

are alive and well?  Te mother, the

virgin, the whore, the crone; they're

elbowing you in the subway, stealing

your cabs, and overwhelming you with

perfume in elevators."

ELAINE

"But perhaps, in fairness to the fairer

sex, I do need to broaden my horizon

and add some new goddesses to the

pantheon: I would like to nominate for

deity..."

FISHER

"... The cheerleader, the coed, and the

man-eater, the last of which concerns me

most today."

CUT TO:

MAN

(reads)

"To be fair, the man-eater isn't

exactly new.  In Ancient Greece, this

fearsome female was known as Erinys,

the devouring death goddess.  In India,

she is Kali, who likes to devour her

boyfriend Shiva's entrails while her

yoni devour his -- dot dot dot, never

mind.  In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed

man-eater is called Ragma..."

You noticed these are all countries

We have to go to Maggie.  Cindy, mind

the shop.

(exits salon;

"... She is known as Miss Maggie

Carpenter, AKA, the Runaway Bride."

MRS. PRESSMAN

Holy moly.

PEGGY

(reads)

"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter

is that she likes to dress her men up

as grooms before she devours them.  She

has already disemboweled six in a row

by leaving them at the altar."... I

can't ready anymore.

MRS. PRESSMAN

(takes paper from

her, reads)

"And her ritual feast continues as she

prepares to make a sacrifice out of the

seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and

we hope that this boomerang bride isn't

honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers

because many predict that this girl is

out of there before the race... before

the rice hits the ground"

(then)

Holy moly.

MRS. PRESSMAN

You tell Maggie.

PEGGY

No, you tell her.

MRS. PRESSMAN

No, no.  You're her best friend.

PEGGY

No.

MRS. PRESSMAN

(holding her

newspaper)

You know, it's just possible that she

hasn't read this yet.

PEGGY

Yeah.

MRS. PRESSMAN

Maybe she hasn't read the paper...

MRS. PRESSMAN (cont'd)

... Or not!

MAGGIE

(bright)

Here we go!  One antique hot water

handle with the "HOT" still on it,

guaranteed to fit any American Standard

cast iron tub with a four-inch center

made between 1924 and 1938.  In other

words, I think you're out of the

doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.

MR. PAXTON

(amazed)

Hallelujah.

MAGGIE

Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on

your account.

EARL

Maggie.

MAGGIE

(walking past customer)

You don't need an air conditioner, Earl,

you just need an attic fan -- There's

more in the back.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

What?

PEGGY

(delicate)

So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?

MAGGIE

(serious)

Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say

it's the rudest and most offensive...

joke anybody's ever played on me!

MAGGIE (cont'd)

You guys!  How long did this take you?

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Where'd you get this done?

(laughing)

You creeps!  I should disinvite you!

And why did you say seven times?  This

is four.

PEGGY

Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette

jokes, so we didn't...

MRS. PRESSMAN

Holy moly.

MAGGIE

Um, you know, now would be a good

moment to tell me this is fake.

(no response)

It won't be funny if you drag it out.

Okay?

(no response)

Okay, well... I mean, I can find out...

Real newspapers smear.  Phoney papers

don't.

MAGGIE (V.O.)

"Dear Editor..."

MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)

"Greeting from the sticks!  Perhaps you

believe that a rural education is

focused mainly on hog calling and

tractor maintenance rather than reading.

Why else would you print a piece of

fiction about me and call it fact?"

MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)

"I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy

thinking us slanderous statements about

how I dump men for kicks to bother with

something silly like accuracy in

reporting.  Which is understandable,

because with a "man-eater" like me on

the loose, who has time to check facts?"

MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)

"Still, we cannibalistic queens can get

pretty cranky when we see things in

print that hurt our feelings, like that

we deliberately abandon fiances with

malice aforethought."

MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)

"That's why I was surprised to find Mr.

Graham's editor was a woman. Call me a

sentimental fool, but I sort of hoped

we man-eater could stick together."

No, no, don't mention my name in there.

ELLIE

(reading letter)

"Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city

folk this little note to say that I have

thought of a ritual sacrifice that would

satisfy my current appetite: Ike

Graham's column on a platter.  Yours

truly, Maggie Carpenter.  P.S. -- I

have inclosed a list of the gross

factual misrepresentations in your

article.  There are fifteen."

IKE

(chuckles as he sits)

Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.

ELLIE

I left four messages.  You don't return

my calls.

IKE

So?  I never returned your calls, even

when we were married.  And what's

Fisher doing here anyway?

FISHER

Ellie asked me to come down to offer

moral support.

IKE

Since when does Ellie need moral supp--

ELLIE

-- It's for you, Ike.

IKE

What?

ELLIE

Journalism lesson number one.  If you

fabricate your facts, you get fired.

IKE

Lesson number two.  Never work for your

former spouse.

ELLIE

That's not nothing to do with it.  You

cooked this story up and you know it.

IKE

I didn't cook up a story.  I had a

source.

ELLIE

Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze-

hound in a bar?

FISHER

In vino veritas.

IKE

Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk

guys in bars are good.  It means

they're not driving.

IKE (cont'd)

Besides, I'm a columnist.  This is what

columnists are supposed to do.  This is

what you like.  We push, we stretch, we

go out on a limo.  That's what makes me

good!

ELLIE

No, that's what makes you unemployed.

IKE

I merely write the stuff.  You're the

one that serves it up.

ELLIE

Not anymore.  I have to draw the line.

(pushing a piece

of paper)

She sent us this list.  Our lawyers say

it's actionable.

IKE

(scoffs)

Lawyers.

(glances at list)

I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is

going to be very tough on you.  It's

going to be hard to get over.  There

will be therapy bills for you.

ELLIE

(shrugs)

I already made an appointment for later

today.

IKE

(putting the list

down, standing)

See?  You want custody of my job? ...

Why not just consider my wrist slapped

and call me when you feel I've served

my time?

ELLIE

I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.

ELLIE (V.O.; cont'd)

If you go quietly, I'll get you

severance pay.

MAGGIE

She canned him, she canned him...

BOB

Come here, Mag, and try this on.

MAGGIE

Listen: "Dear Ms. Carpenter, I

apologize to you for this unfortunate

matter.  Ike Graham's column will no

longer be appearing in this paper.

Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!"

BOB

That-a-girl!  You sacked him.

(checking pack)

This is the weight of the pack you're

going to have to carry in the Himalayas.

Tell me if it's too heavy.

MAGGIE (o.s.)

It's a little... It's a little heavy...

Help me, baby.

FISHER (cont'd)

Remember, we are putting the "fun" back

into formal.

(to Ike)

I just say that for the agency guys.  I

don't even know what that means.  Now

follow me.

FISHER

Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride

piece, and since I do freelance stuff

for G.Q., I'm in a different position

now...

IKE

What are you trying to say to me, Fish?

FISHER

Vindication.  How would you like to get

some?  A chance to prove that, though

your facts weren't entirely straight,

your theory was correct.

IKE

(hiding his hope)

The real story on Miss Carpenter.

FISHER

All the gory details.

IKE

(excited)

The anatomy of the black widow spider

of Maryland.

FISHER

It wouldn't be a bad way to get you

back into writing feature pieces

again.

IKE

(enthusiastically)

This is good.  It is a good story,

Fish.

FISHER

(nods)

If she runs, then it's a cover story.

All true.  All accurate.

IKE

(confesses)

Okay, you were right.  I hated my

column, but I can do this assignment.

FISHER

Then you've got it.  If you leave

tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll

have plenty of time before her next

wedding trot.

IKE

"Paid vindication"  That's what I call

justice.

FISHER

Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know.

They like the idea, but my hands are

tied with budget restraints.

IKE

But I'll get my normal fee, right?

IKE

You want me to do it on spec?!

CUT TO:

FISHER (V.O.)

Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word.

Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a

play!  Plato never got a book advance...

IKE (V.O.)

Oh yeah!  I happen to know from

reliable sources that Nietzche got

expenses and a rental car.

IKE (V.O.; cont'd)

I'm going to make this work, Fish.  I'm

going to do it!

CUT TO:

IKE

I think I'm in Maryberry.

MAGGIE

Cindy, you better 86 Sprout.  He seems

distillates.

CINDY

That's it.  Back to obedience school.

MAGGIE

(to Peggy)

Okay -- have a seat... gently,

carefully.

PEGGY

(delighted as

she spins)

You're a goddess!

MAGGIE

I didn't even need to change this

gasket, just put in a little hydraulic

fluid.

PEGGY

Stop it.  When you talk like that, I

get turned on and it frightens me.

IKE

Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie

Carpenter.  There was a sign at the

hardware store across the street...

PEGGY

Are you a reporter?

IKE

(shocked)

What?

PEGGY

(eyeing his loafers)

It's been our experience that anyone

with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers

ends up being another big city reporter

wanting to interview Maggie.

IKE

About her upcoming wedding and all.

PEGGY

No, about her getting that asshole from

New York fired.

IKE

I am just such a reporter.  And you are?

PEGGY

Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.

IKE

And who are these lovely ladies?

CINDY

Cindy.  Maggie's unmarried cousin.

MRS. PRESSMAN

Mrs. Pressman.  No relation.

PEGGY

And you are?

IKE

(turning toward her)

Looking for Maggie.

PEGGY

Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.

MAGGIE

(yelling to Peggy)

Reporter?

PEGGY

Yup!

MAGGIE

I hope you have a different angle.

It's pretty much all been covered.

IKE

Originality is my speciality.

MAGGIE

Excellent.

PEGGY

Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in

here unless they're getting haircut.

MAGGIE

She's the boss.

IKE

Sorry, no.  I just got one.

MRS. PRESSMAN

(to Ike)

Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact

for you.

IKE

(steps to Mrs. Pressman)

Yes, Mrs. Pressman.

MRS. PRESSMAN

It's her fourth time to the altar, you

know.  Not seven like they said.

IKE

I know.  Tell me something.  Do you

think she's going to make it all the

way this time?

MAGGIE

She swallowed her gun.

MRS. PRESSMAN

I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the

newsstand, he's our local bookie, you

know, he's giving eight to one odds she

won't.  He says she's so famous now,

maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm

going to wait to hear what the pros say.

IKE

Good fact.  Well, you let me know.

MRS. PRESSMAN

Oh, I will.

MAGGIE

Well, instead of a haircut, how about

a wash?  You know, get all that city

grit out of it.

IKE

You'll answer my questions?

IKE (cont'd)

(removing his jacket)

Fine.  You wash, I'll ask the

questions.

PEGGY

Great.

MAGGIE

Have a seat.  Peggy, why don't you give

him the special treatment that

strengthens the follicles.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

So, what do you want to know?

IKE

Getting nervous?

MAGGIE

Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never

been more certain in my life.  Except

-- I am having all kinds of weird

dreams.

IKE

Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me

about them?

MAGGIE

Yes.

PEGGY

(calming)

Let's just put this back here for the

aromatherapy.

MAGGIE

In another one...

PEGGY

Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.

MAGGIE

I'm inside the church.  Everyone I know

is there, only they're not really them.

They're like Frankenstein monsters, but

without the bolts coming out of their

necks.  It's all very "Night of the

Living Dead".  And here's the creepiest

part -- I look down at my dress and

it's red.  I mean, I have no idea what

it means.  Red's not my color!

MAGGIE (cont'd)

So what do you think?

IKE

I think you'd look good in red.

PEGGY

No, she's talking about your hair.

MAGGIE

You're all ready for football season,

Mr. Graham.

IKE

Yes, I think I nailed the personality

profile of the women of Hale.

IKE (cont'd)

(to Peggy)

My jacket, please.

IKE (cont'd)

(sarcastically)

Thank you.

IKE (cont'd)

(putting on jacket;

to Pete)

Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place

that sells shampoo... Strong shampoo?

PETE

Doc's Pharmacy.  Third and Elm.  Tell

him Pete sent you.  Want my hat?

IKE

No thanks.

MAGGIE

(to Peggy)

He seems crabby.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

If you're looking for Elm Street, it's

that way.

IKE

Thank you.

MAGGIE

If you came down here in the pursuit of

happiness, you might as well go back.

Because you can't make me feel bad.

IKE

I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm

here for vindication.  In my heart...

MAGGIE

You have one?

IKE

I feel I'm right about you.  You got me

fired, lady.  You destroyed my

reputation and you screwed up my hair.

You chew men up, spit them out and

loved it.  And I'm down here to satisfy

myself on that point.

MAGGIE

Did something happen to make you care

about reality?

IKE

Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm

onto the truth.  You're going to do the

same thing to "poor bastard number four"

that you did to the last three.  You're

going to run again.  And I'm not

leaving until you do.

MAGGIE

You're going to be very disappointed.

IKE

We'll see.

MAGGIE

I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got

to get back to work.  I still have my

job.

MAGGIE

I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham.

Talk to whoever you want.  You might

actually stumble upon a fact or two.

IKE

Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for

your hat.

WALTER

You know, when I only see one dog, I

know I've had too much to drink.

MAGGIE

You'll never guess who came crawling

into town with his tail between his

legs.

IKE (o.s.)

Who?

IKE (cont'd)

(innocently)

Hello, Maggie.  I just came by to

apologize to your family.

(looks to Walter)

When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I pushed a

story.  I made a mistake.

WALTER

In other words -- he's only human.  An

he brought us a bottle of wine.

IKE

They made me put my hat back on.

WALTER

Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of

Skipper.

MAGGIE

You've got to be kidding me.

BOB

(enjoying the moment)

No, no, you should have seen Skipper.

(then, imitates

growling)

It wasn't that funny.

MAGGIE

So, the forces of good and evil have

already met.

BOB

I'll help you take into the kitchen.

GRANDMA JULIA

Check on the crabs, Bob.

IKE

Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out

there.  You don't think they'll call it

off...?

WALTER

Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we

know.

IKE

You know, your daughter seems...

GRANDMA JULIA

Sorry.

IKE

That's okay, Grandma.

IKE (cont'd)

(continuing his thought)

... Like such a lovely girl.

WALTER

Like her mother.

IKE

(seeing the portrait)

Ah, beautiful.

(gets up to admire

the portrait)

I just can't see her leaving multiple

grooms in the dust like that.

GRANDMA JULIA

Oh, yes, you can.  She's has 'em all on

tape.

IKE

She has a tape?

WALTER

(good-natured)

Yeah.  Lee at the hotel videos wedding.

I mean Maggie didn't know she was going

to make the hundred-yard dash.

IKE

Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee

operation, Grandma's birthday...

WALTER

Gotta tell you this about my daughter.

My daughter makes real good time, even

in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may

not be Hale's longest running joke, but

she certainly is the fastest.

GRANDMA JULIA

(sarcastically)

Ha ha.

DISSOLVE TO:

WALTER (cont'd)

Emma and I were only blessed with one

child, not for lacking of trying.

MAGGIE

This is good, Dad, don't leave anything

out.

WALTER

So I've come to see it as a bonus,

really, that we've been able to plan,

and pay for, so many weddings.

MAGGIE

Not this one.  This one's on me.

IKE

That's fair.

MAGGIE

Despite what you think, I don't do it

on purpose.  And I have no intention of

doing it again.

BOB

That's right, Maggie.  Just keep your

eye on the ball.

BOB (cont'd)

Sports psychology.  It was my major in

college.

IKE

Ahh.

BOB

(false modesty)

I'm the town's unofficial fitness

trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and

body combining for success.  You could

say or you can quote me, I'm a glass

half full king of guy.

MAGGIE

(boasting)

Bob's the head of the P.E. department

at the high school.  And he coaches the

football team.  And he's climbed

Everest.

IKE

(impressed)

Everest.  Is that right?

MAGGIE

Twice...

IKE

Really?

MAGGIE

(sticking it to Ike)

Without oxygen...

BOB

My girl likes to brag about me.

BOB (cont'd)

I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on

our honeymoon.

IKE

How romantic.

MAGGIE

(sharply)

We think so.

IKE

Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed

with two Sherpas and a yak.

CUT TO:

IKE

(to Fisher; into phone)

You won't believe what I'm looking at,

Fisher.  A videotape of all three train

wrecks.

IKE

Kamikaze!

CUT TO:

IKE

Did you see that?

CUT TO:

MRS. TROUT

This one's very popular, but oh, you've

used this one before... Brian.  But I

like the white dinner jacket.

MAGGIE

No, he's no good.  Too blond.

MRS. TROUT

(picks up another)

We'll go with total traditional.

MAGGIE

Too dark.

IKE

But he's got the Bobster's eyes.

IKE (cont'd)

No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set.

IKE (cont'd)

(to Mrs. Trout)

Could I have two coffees, please?  And

what is that wonderful smell?

(seeing the

cinnamon rolls)

I'll have two of those delicious

looking cinnamon rolls.

MRS. TROUT

Sure.

(picking up a

miniature bride)

Here, Maggie.  I think this makes the

best you.

IKE

Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute?

Ahh...

IKE (cont'd)

Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!  Oh, help me!

Help me!  Yup!  That's her all right.

MRS. TROUT

You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.

IKE

Yes, I am.  And who are you?

MRS. TROUT

Betty Trout.  Five dollars.

IKE

(as he pays)

Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to

be making the wedding cake and they say

you're throwing --

MRS. TROUT

(interrupting)

-- The luau for Maggie.

MAGGIE

(all smiles for

Mrs. Trout)

Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I

can't wait to show it to you.

IKE

(cynical delight)

A pre-wedding luau?

MRS. TROUT

Yes.  My husband and I love luaus.

It'll be fun.

IKE

Fun?  Fun isn't the word.

MRS. TROUT

If you're still in town, you should

stop by.

MAGGIE

No, I'm sure he doesn't.

IKE

(to Mrs. Trout)

Actually, I would love to come.

(taps her service bell)

Thank you.  Thank you so much.

MAGGIE

(exasperated)

Is that what you're going to do now?

Follow me around everywhere I go?

IKE

No.

MRS. TROUT

(handing him the

other bag)

Your two cinnamon rolls.

IKE

Bye, Betty.  Thanks.

MAGGIE

He's not a nice person.

CUT TO:

DENNIS

(playful)

Maggie, don't marry Coach!  Marry me.

I love you.

MAGGIE

You're jail bait, Dennis.  Go away.

Run your laps.  Go. Go.

BOB

Drive!  Drive!  From your hips, get low,

get low, get low.  Next!

BOB (cont'd)

Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.

BOB (cont'd)

(to Maggie)

Hey, honey!

MAGGIE

(indicating Ike)

What is he up to now?

BOB

Ike just came by to check out the team.

IKE

And talk about you.

MAGGIE

Bob -- are you making friends with this

man?

BOB

I'm just bragging about how great you

are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.

IKE

Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot

of work to do today!  I'll see you two

love-birds later.

BOB

See you at the wedding.

IKE

You bet ya, Coach.

MAGGIE

At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob,

don't you realize he's writing another

article about me?

BOB

Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a

good offense, right?  You're not going

to let your opponent throw you off

your game.

MAGGIE

You don't understand this guy.

BOB

Let him come to the wedding.  You're

not running, right?  Say it. "I'm

not..."

MAGGIE

(irritably)

I'm not running.

BOB

So if you're not running and Ike Graham

is there to see it, then any article he

writes has got to have a happy ending,

right?  All we're doing is turning

lemon into lemonade.

MAGGIE

I've got news for you.  No amount of

sugar and water is going to turn like

Graham into something you want to take

on a picnic.

BOB

Where's that homemade sunshine?

BOB (cont'd)

I want you boys to take my princess on

the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em

where you parked your car.

MAGGIE

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

My last confession was... ahh...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

... Anyway, I have sort of a technical

question here.  I've been having -- bad

thoughts.  I mean, really bad thoughts

...

PRIEST

Of an impure nature?

MAGGIE

No -- like -- I'm having a problem with

that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept.

I want revenge.  I want to destroy this

guy's life, career, everything. On the

sin scale, how big is that?  I mean,

can I "Hail Mary" my way out of it?

PRIEST

Child, any sin in one's heart is...

MAGGIE

(impatient)

The name's Maggie.  It wasn't this side

of ten years ago that you had your

tongue down my throat.  So don't call

me "child", Brian.  It annoys me.

PRIEST/    BRIAN

Now don't get upset.

MAGGIE

(still inside

the booth)

Brian, open up.  Don't ignore me.

BRIAN

You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you

really shouldn't come to confession.

MAGGIE

I'm sorry.  I'm just so stressed out

about that slime-ball reporter being in

town.  I jus had to come warn you he

might show up here and start asking you

all kinds of ridiculous questions.

BRIAN

Actually, he only asked me one

ridiculous question.  The rest weren't

so bad.

MAGGIE

(sliding along

the pew)

What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell

him we dated before you were a priest?

BRIAN

Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good,

Maggie.

MAGGIE

What did he ask?

MRS. MURPHY

Father, am I too late?

BRIAN

No, no.

MRS. MURPHY

It won't take long.  Jus two venials.

BRIAN

Only respectful things.  What did we

have in common back then... What kind

of music did you like... Did you ruin

my life when you left me standing at

the altar...

MAGGIE

And what did you say?

BRIAN

How could I be angry at you when

clearly what has happened to me is as

God intended?

MAGGIE

(relieved)

Good one!  Thanks.

BRIAN

It happens to be how I feel.

MAGGIE

God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean,

I'm...

(sighs)

Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a

lunatic, but I know exactly where he's

going next.

BRIAN

God bless you, Maggie.

MAGGIE

Oh, wait, my purse.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse.

Good luck.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Wait -- what was the ridiculous

question he asked?

BRIAN

He wanted to know how you used to like

your eggs.

MAGGIE

Weird.  Like after all those years you

would remem--

BRIAN

(interrupting)

-- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and

dill.  Same as me.

MAGGIE

(tenderly)

I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.

BRIAN

I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to

be.  But if you ever become a Catholic,

may I ask you a favor, Maggie?

MAGGIE

Of course.

BRIAN

Could your confess to Father Patrick

from now on?

MAGGIE

Of course.

MAGGIE

Gill?  Lydia?  Gill?

GILL

Hey -- I found it!

MAGGIE

Found what?

GILL

Mags!  Hey, look -- The tape from the

Radio City Music Hall concert --

Remember that night I as trying to get

Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"?

GILL (cont'd)

(disappointed)

Oh, I'll play it for you.

MAGGIE

(shouts over the music)

Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter

who's ben making my life a living hell

... If he comes by here, don't talk to

him.  And whatever yo do....

(crosses to Gill)

... Don't show him that picture of me

at the concert in San Francisco --

MAGGIE (cont'd)

What was that?

GILL

We went to San Francisco twice.

Remember one time we had a flat tire...

Which picture?

IKE

(feigning shock)

Imagine!  Maggie Carpenter topless in a

public arena.

(checks photo again)

And I see there was a chill in the air.

MAGGIE

Give me that!

IKE

But the most interesting thing here is

that I don't see the rose tattoo that

I've heard about on your back.

GILL

Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still

have it, Mags.  I said "You're on, man!

Maggie loved that thing!"  And I could

really use fifty bucks.

GILL (cont'd)

(looking worried)

Mags?

MAGGIE

I'm not gonna show you guys anything.

I am a soon-to-be-married woman.  Now

give me that photograph.

IKE

Sure, I would love to give this to you.

Just give us one quick gander at that

rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.

MAGGIE

Fine.  Here.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

(turning back around)

Satisfied?

IKE

Completely.

GILL

Maggie?  You got it removed?

IKE

Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if

was a stick-on.

GILL

(dismayed)

Maggie?

MAGGIE

(admitting)

I'm really, really afraid of needles...

It doesn't make me a bad person.

GILL

Look.

IKE

(sincerely)

Look, look, man.  I think the man is

heartbroken.

MAGGIE

He is not!

GILL

I think I am.

GILL (cont'd)

Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?

IKE

Jerry.  He'd play.  He'd play... Jerry

would play his heart out.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about

my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn

that tattoo stuff into a big deal --

that I was never serious about Gill,

blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.

PEGGY

For what reason?  Some personal

satisfaction?

MAGGIE

That's what he says, but if he thinks

that I don't realize he's writing

another article, then he's an idiot.

PEGGY

It's probably because you got him fired.

MAGGIE

(sarcastic)

Ya think?

PEGGY

Not that he doesn't deserve to get

fired... Look!  Cory's going for

second!... Sneaky!

MAGGIE

There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.

PEGGY

Where?

MAGGIE

Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking

to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn

into one of those "sources say" things.

PEGGY

He looks better with that stuff out of

his hair.  He's an attractive man.

MAGGIE

I'd say you've been in the sun too long.

You handle him, okay?  I could use five

minutes off from that creep.

PEGGY

Okay, that's fine.  I can do that.

IKE

Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater".

PEGGY

(protesting weakly)

That's Maggie's seat...

IKE

... And this is Maggie's beer.

IKE (cont'd)

That your  husband out there?  Cory

Phleming, a local radio announcer.

PEGGY

Have you listened to his morning show,

"Wake up with ballplayer"?

IKE

Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I

hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

PEGGY

This game is pretty important to him.

He made all-stars in high school, you

know.

IKE

That must have made you proud.

PEGGY

He was going with Maggie back then.

(quickly)

He was never one of her... I mean, they

were never going to get... They just

dated for a while.

PEGGY (cont'd)

Good job, honey!

IKE

It's nice that they're still friends.

PEGGY

(looking at Maggie

and Cory)

Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago.

See, she's not a man-hater at all.

She's very supportive of men...

PEGGY (cont'd)

I'll be back in a second.

MAGGIE

You've been here for three minutes.

What did you do to her?

IKE

You can turn that finger around.

MAGGIE

(defensive)

You misinterpret everything.  We've all

been friends our whole lives.  But

that's the types of relationship you

wouldn't understand.

IKE

Obviously, I'm not the only one who

doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie

leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.

MAGGIE

See, I cheer good.  What is he, a cheer

critic?

MAGGIE

(to herself)

This guy never stops.

MAGGIE

Lee, hey, wake up.  Give me the key to

the reporter's room.  I want to snoop

around.

LEE

(handing her the key)

Okay.  Second floor.

MAGGIE

Thanks.

LEE

Don't take anything big.

MAGGIE

(reads)

"How does she get all these guys to

propose?  She's not that beautiful."

(snorts)

Bite me, paper boy.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

(as she takes post-its)

Rude...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Thief!

IKE

All right, I know you're in there...

You steal my research... You're messing

with the first amendment now.  Open up.

Open up.  You got no place to go.

IKE

I want to have a very serious discussion

with you as to why you're such a pain in

the ass.

IKE (cont'd)

That's breaking and entering.  I'll call

the sheriff.

MAGGIE

You do that.  And remind him he's

bringing the wine to the luau.  Thanks.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Do you think I flirt with Cory?

PEGGY

Good morning to you, too.  You look good.

MAGGIE

Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with

Cory?

PEGGY

Yes.

MAGGIE

I don't mean it.

PEGGY

I know.  I think sometimes you just

sort of spaz-out with random excess

flirtation energy and it just lands on

anything male that moves.

MAGGIE

On anything male that moves?  As

opposed to anything male that doesn't

move?

PEGGY

Like certain kinds of coral.

MAGGIE

I'm going to kill myself.

PEGGY

Why?

MAGGIE

Because you think I'm all like... "Hey

man, check me out".

PEGGY

(friendly)

No, I don't think you're like, "I'm

charming and mysterious in a way that

even I don't understand and something

about me is crying out for protection

from a big man like you".  Very hard

to compete with.  Especially to us

married women who have lost our mystery.

MAGGIE

But you haven't lost your mystery!

You're very mysterious!

PEGGY

No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious

are two different things.

MAGGIE

But I'm weird.

PEGGY

No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird

are two different things.

MAGGIE

Peggy, there's distinct possibility

that I might be profoundly and

irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that,

I love you and I can promise that I

will no longer flirt with Cory, and I

beg your forgiveness.

PEGGY

I'm not worried about you and Cory or

Cory and me or even that you're

irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie,

you've been like this since we were

kids.  And I think now that you are

aware of it and that it hurts people's

feelings, maybe it's time to move on

with your life and commit to someone of

your own, like Bob, if he's the one.

MAGGIE

I think you're right.

(then)

Is there anything I can do to make it

up to you?

PEGGY

Something that brings warmth to my heart.

(pause)

Duckbill platypus.

MAGGIE

It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at

three in the morning at a tick hunt.

It's not anymore.

PEGGY

You're right.  It's not funny now.

Maybe we both grew up.

MAGGIE

Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Freeze.  Hold on to those covers -- I

didn't come here to see Ike Junior.

IKE

I take it the desk clerk is one of your

many admirers.

MAGGIE

(deadpan)

How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.

IKE

Coffee.  Now.

MAGGIE

You're welcome.  Your notes made

interesting bedtime reading -- if you

like trashy fiction.  Your observations

are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete.

You must be very proud.

IKE

I'm not a boastful man.  What's your

point?

MAGGIE

My point is that one again, you're

getting it all wrong.  That won't

improve your reputation any, and it's

not very flattering to me either.  So,

I'm going to give you a chance to write

the truth.

IKE

Really.

MAGGIE

I've decided to cooperate and let you

interview me.

(beat)

For a thousand bucks.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I want a big wedding and a killer dress

and for a grand I will answer all your

questions and let you follow me around.

IKE

My magazine doesn't pay because for

stories.  It's not what you call ethical.

MAGGIE

Oh, but making up the facts as you go

along is ethical?  Actually, I meant

you.  You probably got severance or

expenses or both.  I'll take your check.

No credit cards.

IKE

(to Maggie)

You've seen the post-its.  I've already

got more juicy material than I need.

Why should I pay you dollar one?

MAGGIE

Because I think you're writing on spec

and with a first person interview, you

might actually sell that thing.

IKE

Too much.

MAGGIE

Seven-fifty.

IKE

Five hundred.

MAGGIE

Six-fifty.

IKE

Done.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Pardon the mess.  I haven't cleaned

since the fifth grade.

IKE (cont'd)

What's this over here?

MAGGIE

It's a birthday present for my cousin.

Put your finger in.

IKE

Cindy the manicurist.

MAGGIE

No, the other one.

IKE

(laughing)

This is wonderful.  You reconfigure all

these industrial parts and you do

something amazing with it.

IKE (cont'd)

Amazing.  Found industrial stuff.

Willow lamp... Rasta lamp...

IKE (cont'd)

Is this your preferred logo?

MAGGIE

I think so.

IKE

I like it.  This whole thing is pretty

incredible.

(studying a lamp)

I think you could probably sell this

lamp idea in New York.

MAGGIE

Maybe someday.

IKE

You afraid to try?

MAGGIE

(stares at him)

No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe

someday.

IKE

Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely

incredible.

(sitting)

I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this

isn't exactly a woman's room.

MAGGIE

What an incredible chauvinistic

observation.

MAGGIE

That's Brian's.  He took me ut canoeing

on the lake and gave me the ring in a

velvet box.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

(defensive)

It was classic.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Gill.  Of course.  He proposed at the

tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert.

It was very sweet until he hallucinated

that the drum set was a blood-sucking

space alien.

IKE

Always a mood killer.

MAGGIE

Still sweet.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

George.  He proposed at a butterfly

farm in St. Thomas.  The ring was

inside a cocoon.

IKE

(grimacing)

It's a little "Silence of the Lambs"

for me.  I can't believe you waited for

the wedding to run.

MAGGIE

He's an entomologist!  I thought it was

very unique.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

And here we are at Bob.  He proposed

during the seventh inning stretch...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

... At an Oriole's game.

IKE

Wait.  Don't tell me.  The scoreboard

lit up with "Mary me, Maggie."

MAGGIE

It was one of the most wonderful

moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even

applauded.

IKE

(stopping)

Highly suspect.

MAGGIE

What do you mean?  It was incredibly

romantic!

IKE

Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got

to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.

IKE (cont'd)

I think the most anybody can honestly

say is, "Look..."

(sits on the arm

of the couch)

"I guarantee that we'll have tough

times.  I guarantee that at some point

one or both of us will want to get out

of this thing.  But I also guarantee

that if I don't ask you to be  mine,

I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

Because I know in my heart -- you're

the only one for me"

MAGGIE

I like it.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I'd like it better on a scoreboard.

(lightly)

Is that how you proposed when you asked

your wife to marry you?

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Don't look so surprised, you've got

divorce written all over you.

IKE

I'm a work in progress.

MAGGIE

So?  Is that what you said to her?

IKE

No.  I think I said something eloquent

like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya

know.  What do you think?"

MAGGIE

Now that's romantic.  A proposal like

that and you didn't find eternal bliss?

What went wrong?

IKE

I don't know.

MAGGIE

You don't know.

IKE

No.

MAGGIE

Maybe you should ask her some time.

Ever thought of that?

IKE

Call me crazy, but I believe that check

I gave you entitles me to ask the

questions for a while.

MAGGIE

Fair enough.

(thinks a beat)

Actually...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I'll just need one more day to make sure

your check clears.

IKE

Ow!

DISSOLVE TO:

MAGGIE

Even with everything that's happened

I've still never been married and I

still deserve a beautiful dress.

IKE

Agreed.

POLLY

(to the mother)

She'll be the prettiest little flower

girl in your daughter's wedding.

MAGGIE

Mr. Whittenmeyer.  Hi, Polly!

POLLY

Hi, Maggie.  You'll have to excuse her,

Maggie.  Some of the children are

afraid of you since you dragged that

little boy up the aisle.

MAGGIE

I didn't drag.

(then to the girl)

He tripped on his shoelaces.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

You've come for your dress.  Good!

I'll get it from the back.

MAGGIE

(happily)

Actually, I would like to get this dress.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

(to Polly)

Polly, take Leslie into change.

(then, to Maggie)

But the one you have on hold is lovely.

MAGGIE

(pleasantly)

Yes.  But I've changed my mind.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

It's one thousand dollars.

MAGGIE

I have one thousand dollars.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

(firmly)

The other one is only three hundred

dollars.

MAGGIE

Is this dress for sale?

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

It just seems like an awful lot of

money to spend on one of your dresses,

Maggie... You only wear them for about

ten minutes.

MAGGIE

Yeah, that's a good point.

(then, sitting)

The other dress is nice.

IKE

Mrs. Whittenmeyer.  May I talk to you

for a second?

IKE (cont'd)

I don't know much about this kind of

thing.  I'm from out of town.  You're a

salesperson, right?  You're here to

sell wedding dresses.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

(huffy)

Yes.  I've been here for thirty years.

IKE

Perfect.  Because Miss Carpenter is

here to buy one.  But not just any one.

She wants that one.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

It's a thousand dollars!

IKE (cont'd)

Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this

beautiful dress and anything else she

wants or I'm coming back here with a

squirt gun filled with India ink.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

Will he really do that?

MR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd)

(to Maggie)

Well, why don't you pick out some

accessories while I get this ready,

dear.  Polly, will you come help me,

please?

POLLY

(whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer)

It's a thousand dollars.

MRS. WHITTENMEYER

Shhhh!  The man has ink!

IKE

Tough to spend money in this town.

MAGGIE (o.s.)

What do you think?

IKE

(stammering)

You look... uh... You look fine.

MAGGIE

Fine.  The newspaper's upside down.

That's better than fine.

IKE

Bob will be very happy.

MAGGIE

Bob!  I almost forgot!  I have to meet

Bob!

BOB

Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to

order.

MRS. PRESSMAN

We're out the special because

somebody...

(indicates COOK with head)

... didn't order enough sausage.

BOB

Let me have the garden omelette.  Egg

whites only.

MAGGIE

I'll have the same.

IKE

(clears his throat)

Of course.

MAGGIE

What was that?  I can't order  my eggs

without sarcasm?

BOB

Neutral corners you two.  You're on the

same team now.  Any more fighting and

it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.

(gently, to Ike)

Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever

meet.  But she's always focusing out

there.  She's got to start focusing

more in here.

(taps his chest)

That's why she's had some -- whatever

you want to call it -- problems in the

past.

(to Maggie)

That's what we're working on -- focus.

Right, Maggie?  Focus on Maggie.  Focus

on Bob.

MAGGIE

(quietly)

Right.

BOB

(to Ike)

I lead Maggie through a visualization

exercise.  All the sports shrinks use

this head stuff.  Visualize the end

zone, if you catch my drift.

BOB (cont'd)

Here's today's mantra: "It's an open

field to Big Bob."

IKE

Tell me.  When you get to the altar,

will you spike the bouquet?

MAGGIE

You know, there's no...

IKE

Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is

never done.

(heading to the door)

Mrs. Pressman, thank you.

MRS. PRESSMAN

Tootaloo.

GRANDMA JULIA (V.O.)

I'd like to explain about the weddings.

There are reasons why they didn't come

off.  Three weddings, no "I do's".  You

can't believe how much cake we were

left with.  I should weigh three

hundred pounds.  I don't think her

father minded spending so much money on

booze that nobody drank.

MAGGIE

Ike... Hi, Grandma.

IKE

Gram here was going to give me the

skinny on why you run from marital

bliss.

GRANDMA JULIA

Right, cover your ears, Netta.  It's

not that she's afraid of the wedding,

she's afraid of the wedding night.

Innocent girls are terrified of "the

one-eyed snake".

(getting into it)

Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took

a knitting needle with me into the bed...

MAGGIE

Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one-

eyed snake awhile ago.

GRANDMA JULIA

Oh, yeah, I forgot.  I'll tell you one

thing, your grandpa didn't forget that

wedding night.

(no Netta)

You can take your hands off your ears,

Netta.  Your tea's getting cold.

MAGGIE

Can you excuse us a minute?

(then to Ike)

May I have a word with you, please?

IKE

Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.

MAGGIE

I found this and didn't know if it was

something interesting.

IKE

(excited)

Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This

is "King of Blue"!  This is the

original recording.  Hard to find in

good condition.  Where did you find

this?

MAGGIE

(casual)

It was in the attic.  It was jus

sitting there gathering dust.

IKE

It's valuable.  Hang onto it.

MAGGIE

No.  You take it.

IKE

Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music

I like and then finding me a rare album.

You're not trying to soften me up, are

you?

MAGGIE

No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I

wouldn't attempt the impossible.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

(coaxing)

C'mon.  Let's go.

WALTER

(belligerently)

I haven't had any fun since you got

your driver's license...

MAGGIE

I'm not exactly having fun, either...

Steady.

WALTER

(to Dog)

Good boy, Port Hole.

MAGGIE

His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.

WALTER

I changed it.

(then to Drunk)

See you later, Mr. Travis.

(then to Maggie)

That guy has a problem... Maggie, you

can run everyone's life but your own.

WALTER (cont'd)

Good daughters let their fathers pass

out.

MAGGIE

(without difficulty)

Ike... Please don't write anything

about this --

IKE

No.  Forget about it.  Don't even think

about it.

MAGGIE

Watch your leg, Dad.

(then to Ike)

I'm so tired of this.

IKE

Why don't you let him sleep it off in

the trunk. I'll take you for a ride.

Then we'll come back for him.

(to Drunk on bench)

Keep an eye on him.

DRUNK MAN

I'm too loaded.

IKE

I was talking to the dog.

(turning to Maggie)

All right?

MAGGIE

Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.

CUT TO:

IKE

My dad managed a business and two

mistresses.  He wanted me to be a

novelist.  More?

IKE (cont'd)

My mother wanted me to become a

musician.  0 for two.  But at least

I'm a journalist and we all know

journalism is literature in a hurry.

MAGGIE

Your filter's clogged.  This takes

unleaded.

IKE

Can you fix it?

MAGGIE

First I have to find some tools.  I

need a half and a nine-six-tenth.

IKE

(removing his glasses)

Of what?

MAGGIE

(in amazement)

Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.

IKE

Kind of isolated.

MAGGIE

Yeah.  It's kind of nice.

IKE

There's one thing we New Yorkers know

how to do is hail a cab.  If there's no

cab, we walk.

MAGGIE

I can get some tools over there.... and

save the battery... There's one thing

we country girls know how to do is cut

across a field.  It's quicker.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Be careful of snakes.

IKE

Snakes?  Are you serious?  I don't like

snakes.  I've never even seen a snake.

MAGGIE

Do you think there's only one right

person for everybody?

IKE

No.  But I think attraction is too

often mistaken for rightness.

Attraction is very misleading.  And if

it's mutual, it's well, terribly

distracting.

MAGGIE

Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean

anything.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

(lightly)

I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence.

MAGGIE AND IKE

(breaking the

moment jokingly)

"Tools".

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Lionel, can I borrow some tools?

IKE

Yeah, we need a half and nine-

sixteenths.

LIONEL

Gonna bust out of another wedding?

IKE

You're sure well known around here.

FISHER

(into phone)

Yes, well, my theory was that she may

be running because she gets attention...

Negative attention is attention.

Like when women whack you on the street

because of your column, that's negative

attention.

IKE (V.O.)

This is about her negative attention,

not mine.  Did you get the

reimbursement for the dress yet?

FISHER

(into phone)

No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you

think she's still gonna run?

IKE (V.O.)

I don't know.

IKE

(into phone)

Look -- I'll be in there later today.

I'll come by and tell you all about it.

FISHER (V.O.)

You're coming here?

IKE

(into phone)

Yeah.

FISHER (V.O.)

Then come for dinner.

IKE

(into phone)

Okay, we'll order out.

FISHER (V.O.)

Order out like a Philistine, when you

got the Galloping Gourmet here?...

IKE

Get this man a Kamikaze.

GEORGE

Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter,

very professional job.

IKE

(whispers)

You could have told me you were fiance

number three.

GEORGE

And end up in the papers?  I've been

humiliated enough already to last a

lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got

you canned.

IKE

Thanks.

GEORGE

She's a cacophony of contradictions.

IKE

Well, I'm writing another article on

the cacophony.

GEORGE

Ah, can't stay away from her, can you?

Like a moth to a flame.

IKE

Guess you'd know about that.  You're an

entomologist, right?  How's business?

GEORGE

(taking a sip

of his drink)

Not bad.  I was traveling around

studying the reproductive and migratory

patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.

IKE

(sarcastic)

Neuter a locust, feed the world.

GORGE

Not the world.  Just Africa and China.

GEORGE (cont'd)

You know Maggie was the only girl I

ever met who would hold my tarantula.

On the first date.

IKE (cont'd)

So, tell me, George, why do you think

she ran?

GEORGE

Same as you said.  What did you call

her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death

goddess."

IKE

I don't think that's why she ran.

GEORGE

Why do YOU think she ran?

IKE

I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I

was on the wrong track.

GEORGE

And you defending her?

IKE

No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a

journalist.  I'm a truth teller.

GEORGE

Unbelievable, she got to you.

IKE

Oh, please!

GORGE

Join the club.

(passing him

his drink)

Here, you need this more than me.

IKE

(protecting, taking

his tape recorder

out of his pocket)

I'm writing an article, I'm getting

paid to do this, it's going to be a

cover story, it's going to be published

... The facts will be read someday.

IKE (cont'd)

What kind of eggs did she like?

GEORGE

Poached, just like me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FISHER

(sarcastically)

Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese

takeout.  That's New York living.

ELLIE

(into phone)

... Just call me when you have it.

(hangs up, then to Fisher)

Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a

man-eater?

FISHER

Or a vegetarian?

ELLIE

Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys,

But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap.

Nice guys, but he lives with his mom...

Nice guys, but he just out of prison.

IKE

No... They're interesting guys.  Each

one of these guys has something going

for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest.

Another's become a priest.  One's a

pretty good guitar player.  And this

guy today tried to end world hunger, if

you can believe that...

FISHER

Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

ELLIE

Fisher, let him talk.

IKE

(sits)

But one of those guys -- not one of

them -- knew her at all.  Each one was

convinced that she was perfect for them,

but they didn't see her.  And she never

showed up so they couldn't see her.

It's a very symbolic thing happening.

She becomes what she thinks they wanted

to be.

FISHER

(in shock)

Ike is turning sensitive and I can't

bear to watch.  I'm going to make a

fresh pot of tea.

ELLIE

(into phone)

Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye.

(hangs up, then yells to Fisher)

Fisher, don't forget the fortune

cookies.

IKE

Is that what I did to you?  Is that

what happened?  Did I just not see

you?

ELLIE

No.  No, you didn't.

IKE

(heartfelt)

Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,

Ellie.

ELLIE

I'm sorry, too.

(beat)

Wow.  That only took us between years

to say.

CUT TO:

LOU TROUT

Welcome to our annual country luau.  As

you know, Betty and I got married on

the rim of the crater, Diamond Head.

MRS. TROUT

(grabbing the

microphone)

This year, we're dedicating our first

dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the

King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and

Bob.

MRS. TROUT (cont'd)

King and Queen, dance.

MRS. TROUT (cont'd)

Everybody dance.

TIMES OUT:

MRS. TROUT

Pictures of the King and Queen.

PEGGY

Lighten up, wahine.

MAGGIE

Lighten up, what?

PEGGY

This party is for you and Bob.  Get

your mind off the reporter.

MAGGIE

I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours.

It just gives me the creeps a little bit.

I'd feel better if I knew where he was.

PEGGY

(nods to door)

Would it?

PEGGY (cont'd)

What are you doing?

MAGGIE

(after a beat)

I'm going to go dance with Bob.

Because he's the man.

(referring to her headdress)

I like those grapes.

LOU TROUT

Hey, Mr. Graham, welcome to our luau.

What can I get you?

IKE

You got something without a toy in it?

TIME CUT:

IKE

Aloha.  That's a very fetching

headdress you're wearing.

MAGGIE

Where did you disappear to?

IKE

Missed me bad, huh?

TIME CUT:

MRS. TROUT

Attention.  Listen to Walter.  Listen

close, he slurs.

(then)

Shut up, wahines!

WALTER

In the tradition that has grown through

the years, it is now Toast Time!  First

up, our host, "A Honey of a Beekeeper",

Lou Trout..

LOUT TROUT

May the groom's heart be filled with

hopes and the bride's feet be filled

with lead!

MRS. TROUT

May the pitter-patter of little feet

not be Maggie's.

MRS. PRESSMAN

May the gifts be returned!

TED

May the back of the dress be as pretty

as the front!

WALTER

You know the old saying, "You're not

losing a daughter..."  Well, I'd like to!

WALTER (cont'd)

Maggie may not be Hale's longest

running joke...

(under her breath)

WALTER AND     MAGGIE

-- But she's certainly the fastest.

WALTER (cont'd)

Oh, look, Mr. Graham, how about a toast?

IKE

I don't know, give me a minute.

(to Maggie)

Are you all right with this?

MAGGIE

Excuse me?

IKE

Are you all right with this?  You think

this is funny?

MAGGIE

Yes.

IKE

I don't and I don't think you should...

BOB

It's a joke.  They're kidding.

WALTER AND CROWD

(yell)

Come on and give us a toast.

IKE

You want me to make a toast?  Okay...

I'll give you a toast.  To Maggie's

family and friends.  May you find

yourselves the bull's eye of an easy

target.  May you be publicly flogged

for all of your bad choices and may

your noses to rubbed in all of your

mistakes...

MRS. TROUT

That was funny.

(a pause)

But enough toasts, let's hula.  Let's

start the music up.

CORY

Hey, Bob.  I got twenty dollars bet on--

BOB

Not now.

PEGGY

(calling after her)

Maggie.  Maggie.

(to Ike,  handing him a jacket)

Here.  She may need this.  It's not

really Hawaii.

BOB

Where'd Maggie go?

PEGGY

Oh, she just went to get me something

from the car.

IKE

I'm the only goddamn person in there

pulling for you.

MAGGIE

You humiliated me!

IKE

No, Maggie, I defended you.

Humiliating you is what everyone else

is doing.  It's the theme of this party.

MAGGIE

I had it under control.  Now they feel

sorry for me.

IKE

Well, they should.  Because they're

about to watch you hang yourself again.

IKE (cont'd)

-- Tell me something, do you really

care about Mount Everest?

MAGGIE

It's fun!  It's high.

IKE

Or the sexual habits of locusts?

MAGGIE

That was very interesting research

George was doing!

IKE

What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary

tattoo?

MAGGIE

I already explained about that.

IKE

And where you ever really going to run

the leper colony in Molokai?

MAGGIE

(wincing)

Brian told you that?

IKE

Or maybe you just wanted to wear the

headdress.

MAGGIE

Every one of those times I was being

supportive.  Something you won't

understand.

IKE

Supportive?  You weren't being

supportive.  You were being scared.

Just like now.  You are the most lost

woman I have ever laid eyes on.

MAGGIE

Lost!

IKE

That's right.  You're so lost you don't

even know how you like your eggs.

MAGGIE

What!?

IKE

With the priest, you liked them

scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried.

With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's

egg whites only, thank you very much.

MAGGIE

That's called changing your mind.

IKE

No, that's called not having a mind of

your own.  What are you doing, Maggie?

You really want to let that man drag

you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You

don't want to climb Annapuma.

MAGGIE

Yes I do!

IKE

No you don't.  You want a man who will

lead you down the beach with his head

over your eyes just so you can discover

the feel of the sand under your feet.

You want a guy who will take you into a

cave with a thousand candles just to

read you a poem.  You want a man to

wake you up at dawn because he's

burning to talk to you and he can't

wait another minute to find out what

you'll say.  Am I right?

IKE (cont'd)

Am I right?

MAGGIE

Stop.  Stop it!  I'm getting married on

Sunday, and you're just trying to make

me run!  Why?  Because you're a cynical,

exploitative, mean-hearted creep who

wouldn't know real love if it bit him

in the armpit!  And all you do is tear

other people down and-and-and laugh at

them, and criticize what they do,

because you're too afraid to do

anything yourself!  I read your column.

You never wrote one about you.  I'm not

the only one who's lost and you know it!

Am I right?  Well?  Am I right?

BOB

Mag.  Help me out here.  Green Bay.

Right guard.

BOB (cont'd)

You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut

... Are you okay?

MAGGIE

Yes.

BOB

Let me take you back inside, okay?

MAGGIE

Jerry Kramer.

CINDY

Tell me, why does Maggie need another

wedding rehearsal and two days before

the wedding?  She's already done this.

PEGGY

Bob is making her visualize the

ceremony.

CUT TO:

BOB

(to Maggie)

Okay, we're ready.  Want me to have Ike

leave now?

MAGGIE

No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the

pastor.

IKE

I'd rather not.

MAGGIE

(sarcastically)

Come on, it'll give you a great view.

It's perfect.

(seeing Peggy)

Hey.

BOB

Team effort, Pastor Ike... Cindy, ready?

(after no response)

Cindy, come on.

PEGGY

He's going to be the pastor?

MAGGIE

Yep.  I want him to be front and center

and to watch everything.

PEGGY

What happened at the luau?

MAGGIE

(flustered)

... I don't even want to talk about

the luau.

(then seeing a hanging rope)

What's this?

PEGGY

It's for the bell.

CINDY

Bob's in a hurry.

PEGGY

Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us

visualize.  Remember what Bob said?

"Be the ball."

CINDY

"Sink the putt."

PEGGY

"Make the shot."

CINDY

"Nothing but net."

PEGGY

"Never say die."

MAGGIE

Go!

BOB

Honey, are you okay?

IKE

(taking off his jacket)

At this pace, it could be an evening

wedding.

BOB

Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're

taking this too fast.

BOB (cont'd)

We need to limber you up a little.

You're tensing.

(thinks a moment;

to Ike, moving him

to groom's spot)

You stand here and be me so she knows

how far she'll have to go.

(then to Maggie)

I'm going to walk with you.

BOB (cont'd)

Visualize!  Visualize!  It's game time.

BOB (cont'd)

You are the football.  You're spiraling

through the air towards the hands of

the groom.

MAGGIE

(eyes down)

Yes, I'm spiraling through the air.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I streak towards the goal line.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

And I land on the goal line.

BOB

Okay, I'm the pastor.  Dearly beloved,

blah, blah, blah.  So on and so forth.

Ra ta ta ta.  Yabada dabada.  I now

pronounce you man and wife.  Kiss the

bride, badum dum.

(then moving toward Ted)

We have the crescendo that leads to us

right back down the aisle and out the...

BOB (cont'd)

Maggie!!!!?

BOB (cont'd)

(furious)

If you were imagining me, you did great.

(to Ike)

What the hell were you doing?

IKE

(eyes on Maggie)

I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.

MAGGIE

(dazed but happy)

I kissed him back.

BOB

Yeah, I caught that.  Want to tell me

how long this has been going on?

MAGGIE

About a minute...?

IKE

A little longer for me.

MAGGIE

Really?

BOB

What do you expect me to say to this?

IKE

How about -- "I hope you'll be very

happy together"?

BOB

I hope you'll be very happy together.

MAGGIE

(to Peggy)

Take care of him.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Bob, I'm sorry!

(half to herself)

At least I backed out before the

wedding.  That's progress!

MAGGIE (cont'd)

Some woman is going to make you a lot

happier than I ever could...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

See?

PEGGY

Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs.

Pressman: "Holy moly".  Call me later.

MAGGIE

Okay.  So... what, uh... What just

happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In

there?

IKE

I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't

even want to talk about it.

MAGGIE

Me, either.

IKE

(blathering)

I love you.  I love you.

MAGGIE

(blathering)

I love you, too.

IKE

Wait.  We have to talk.  We have to do

some talking now.  Pull up a railing.

IKE (cont'd)

You have to go down an aisle and say "I

do".  You have to get married.

MAGGIE

To who?  Are you asking me?

IKE

Me?

MAGGIE

Yes, you!

IKE

(thinks)

Well, you do have the dress.

MAGGIE

And the church.

IKE

And the wedding date.  There's the two

of us.

(beat)

So, you think... maybe... You have to

go down the aisle with somebody you

love and who love you back.

MAGGIE

I'm okay with that.

IKE

So am I.

MAGGIE

So, we'll...

TED

Good night.

IKE

I'm getting married.

CUT TO:

ELLIE

Ike's going to get married.

ELLIE (cont'd)

(without turning to him)

Fisher, if you pee on that Persian,

I'll kill you.

CUT TO:

CINDY

I love his eyes.  I just believe

they're listening to you.

PEGGY

His hair... any color.

GRANDMA JULIA

I like his tight butt.

MAGGIE

Grandma!

PEGGY

(to Cindy)

See, this is a mature relationship.

She's really found it.

CUT TO:

DINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL)

Wedding bells are ringing for the

fourth time today in Hale, Maryland.

Maggie Carpenter, "Always a Bride --

Never a Bridesmaid", will be attempting

to complete her fourth wedding ceremony.

We'll come back on the air when the

results are in.  Back to you, Jessica.

MEREDITH

The turnout for this morning's wedding

is usually reserved for royalty or

Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter

is Hale, Maryland's special star and

the citizens of Hale are out in full

force today.

T-SHIRT VENDOR

I got "Bye-bye Birdie".  "What part of

'I do' don't you understand?"... Get

your "Runaway Bride" T-shirts here...

JULIE MURPHY (Channel 6)

The bride's been here for almost an

hour, but being around in the beginning

was never her problem.  We'll be here,

showing you the full wedding ceremony,

we hope.

JACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16)

Will she or won't she?  That is on the

minds of these several hundreds folks,

who are standing here this morning.

Not to mention on the mind of Groom

Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike

Graham, who is missing in action.

MAGGIE

(moves to window)

He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not

coming.

PEGGY

No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a

"V".

MAGGIE

You and your lucky geese.  You always

see geese.

PEGGY

Not eight...

CINDY

And in a "V".

MAGGIE

Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.

CINDY

Rub your ears.

PEGGY

Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing.

Cory does that to me when I

hyperventilate.

CINDY

We do it to our dog.

MAGGIE

It's hurting.

CINDY

We'll rub.

PEGGY

He's here!  He's here!

CINDY

I'll get the dress.

MAGGIE

He's here!... He's here!

PEGGY

Now's the time for calm... If you don't

calm down, you won't get your dress on...

(reassuringly)

He's the one... He's the one.

MAGGIE

This is not a good sign.

CINDY

We have to hurry.  The Sunday School

kids will be here soon.

CUT TO:

JULIE MURPHY

Well, the groom just pulled up.  There

was talk of a "now show", but he is

here.

DINA NAPOLI

Ike Graham is here!

IKE

Shoot ours so she has one with an

ending.

IKE (cont'd)

(pleading)

Mrs. Pressman, please.

MRS. PRESSMAN

It's okay.  There's no microphone.

You're no fun.

IKE

No, I'm not.

IKE

Friends.  Thank you.  Thank you.

IKE (cont'd)

We are friends, aren't we, Fisher?

FISHER

(grinning)

Of course we are.  Of course.

IKE

Then you'll be my best man.

FISHER

Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm

best.

IKE

Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell

you what to do.  And someone will tell

me what to do.

ELLIE

You always looked great in that suit...

And Ike?

(emotional)

I'm happy for you, honey.

ELLIE (cont'd)

I'll have a car around the back to

whisk you out of here if she runs.

BOB

You look awful.

IKE

(sarcastically)

Thank you.

BOB

Ike.  Need help?

BOB (cont'd)

I'm glad it's you.

IKE

Really?

BOB

I didn't want to find out I wasn't for

her in the fourth quarter.

IKE

Got any last minute advice?

BOB

(motioning to their eyes)

Maintain eye contact.

IKE

(to himself)

Eye contact.  Eye contact.

IKE (cont'd)

Cover me.

FISHER

(to Ike)

I have no idea what I'm doing.

IKE

Your job is... the ring.

(to Fisher)

Do you have the ring?!

FISHER

I just found out I'm best man!  I'm

lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?

MRS. TROUT

You should thank Lou and I for the

wedding car -- a '63 Buick.

IKE

Thank you.

MRS. TROUT

Oh, come on.  You're practically family.

FISHER

Hello.  I'm Fisher.

MRS. TROUT

This doesn't want to come out.

FISHER

You just pull a hair from my neck.

IKE

Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!

GRANDMA JULIA

Good luck, Maggie.

MAGGIE

Thank you, Grandma.

WALTER

(quietly to Maggie)

I'm really rooting for this one.

MAGGIE

Thank you, Dad.

CINDY

Spit.

PEGGY

Let's go.

MAGGIE

No sauntering down the aisle.  Just

make time.  Let's just get there.

ELAINE

Hi, I'm Elaine from New York.

BOB

Hello.  I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth

attempt.

ELAINE

I'm sorry.

BOB

That's okay.  There's a lid for every

pot.  Besides, I'm comfortable with Ike.

I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his

heavyweight title to a New Yorker.

ELAINE

I know.  Gene Tunney.

DENNIS

They're ready, Maggie.

MAGGIE

Just a second.

IKE

(yelling out)

Block the doors!

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

There's a man coming down those steps

with lots of candy in his pockets.  If

you tickle him, he'll give candy.

IKE

Maggie!

IKE

Maggie!

ELLIE

Look, he's running after her.

FISHER

Look, he's in pretty good shape.

ELLIE

Poor Ike.

IKE

(running; yells)

Maggie!

ELLIE

Where do you think she's going?

FISHER

Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten-

thirty tomorrow.

IKE

Maggie!

CUT TO:

PEGGY

You okay?  I'm closing.

MAGGIE

I'm just finishing up, too.

PEGGY

Want to go to Butch's for a drink or

something?

MAGGIE

(interrupting)

No, I'm just going to head home.

PEGGY

Okay.

PEGGY (cont'd)

(stepping closer

and making a "V"

with her fingers)

You know, I was just thinking about

that geese thing.  I think the "V" was

half of a "W".  A "W" for...

MAGGIE

What are you talking about?

PEGGY

Wedding.  Wedding.

(holding Maggie's face)

You just have to get the rest of your

ducks in a row.

MAGGIE

Thank you.  You still think that he

was....

PEGGY

Quick.  Very quick.

VOICE

(whispers)

Marry me, Maggie.

MAGGIE

(softly)

Hi, Dennis.

DENNIS

I am going to propose, you know.  I

mean, the right way.  Soon as I turn

eighteen.

MAGGIE

You're sweet, Dennis.  But you've got

to go.  I'm closing up.  Here's a candy

bar and one for your brother.

DENNIS

I'm not giving up.   A person shouldn't

give up.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WALTER

That's Maggie.  Home for lunch.

GRANDMA JULIA

She's been doing this since the last

wedding.  I don't think it's good.

MAGGIE

Hey.  Grandma, what's for lunch?

GRANDMA JULIA

Turkey and cheese.

WALTER

Honey, your grandmother and I were

thinking about opening a wedding gift

museum.

MAGGIE

STOP!

WALTER

What?

MAGGIE

(quiet fury)

Just stop it.  Don't say another word

like that.

WALTER

(putting down the oranges)

Maggie, it's just a joke...

MAGGIE

No.  It's my life.

WALTER

A harmless joke.

MAGGIE

No, it's humiliating and you've been

doing it since I was a kid.  I don't

like it.  Stop.  You may not like

having a daughter with problems.  But

guess what?  I don't like having a

father who's drunk all the time.  I'll

eat in my room.

GRANDMA JULIA

That needed to be said.  You know --

you're always making jokes about her,

so they won't make jokes about your

drinking.

MAGGIE

I need a plan... A plan to life... What

would Bruce Lee do?  He'd kick some

ass...

MAGGIE

Hello, Ike.

IKE

Don't tell me.  My doorman is one of

your many admires... I knew I should

have given him a better Christmas gift.

MAGGIE

I've been making friends with your cat.

(then)

Is it okay that I'm here?

IKE

I don't have much choice in the matter

now, do I?  But I can't speak for

Italics.

(to Cat)

Traitor!

MAGGIE

I don't blame you for being mad...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

... Or... furious.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

... Irate?  Livid?  How's that?

IKE

Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie?

You here on business?  I saw your lamps.

They're terrific.

MAGGIE

It's something I've always wanted to do.

IKE

You actually could make breaking and

entering into a new career.

(after opening

the glass doors)

So, what are you doing here?

MAGGIE

I wanted to talk to you about why I run

or ride away from things.

IKE

(after sitting)

Does it matter?

MAGGIE

I think so... When I was walking down

the aisle?  I was  walking toward

somebody who didn't have any idea who I

really was.  And it was only half the

other person's fault, because I had

done everything to convince him that I

was exactly what he wanted.  So it was

good that I didn't go through with it

because it would have been a lie, but

you -- you knew the real me.

IKE

Yes, I did.

MAGGIE

I didn't.  And you being the one at the

end of the aisle didn't just fix that.

IKE

No, I couldn't fix anything...

(as he gets up)

But I still ended up chasing a truck.

MAGGIE

I understand why you bring up the truck.

Let me explain something.  The fact is,

you've seen me at my worst, most

embarrassing, deviously plotting,

potentially but not certifiably,

psychotic state.  And if you liked me

then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...

(crosses to him)

Benedict.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I love eggs Benedict.  I hate all the

other kinds.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

... I hate big weddings with everybody

staring.  I would like to get married

on a weekday while everybody is at work.

If I ride off into the sunset, I want

my own horse.

IKE

Should I be writing this down?

IKE (cont'd)

What's this?

MAGGIE

These are for you.

IKE

Used?

MAGGIE

They're mine.  I'm turning in my

running shoes to you.

IKE

This is getting serious.

MAGGIE

And one more thing.  I know it's hard

to believe there could be more.  Um...

MAGGIE (cont'd)

If you could have a seat, please.

IKE

(laughing)

Oh my God.  No.

MAGGIE

No, no -- don't hide your face, this

only happens once in a lifetime.  It's

definitely a first to me, and you're

not going to want to miss it.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham.

Will you marry me?

IKE

Maggie, I gotta think about this a

little bit.

MAGGIE

(cheerful)

Good.

MAGGIE (cont'd)

I was hoping you'd say that.

IKE

(laughing)

You were not.

MAGGIE

I was, because if you said "yes" right

away, I wouldn't get to say this next

part.  And I've been practicing it.

(pulling up a chair

and sitting)

Ready?

IKE

I'm listening.

MAGGIE

(tenderly)

"I guarantee that we'll have tough

times.  I guarantee  that at some point

one or both oof us will want to get out.

But I also guarantee that if I don't

ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for

the rest of my life. Because I know in

my heart -- you're the only one for me".

IKE

Pretty good speech, Maggie.

MAGGIE

I borrowed it from this guy I know.

So?

IKE

Dance with me.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE TO BLACK.
