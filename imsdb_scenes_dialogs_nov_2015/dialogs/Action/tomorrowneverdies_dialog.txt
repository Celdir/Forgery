BOND

There has to be an easier way to earn

a living.

BOND'S VOICE

(over a speaker)

Seven, in position.

TANNER'S VOICE

Roger, Seven.

M

... What were you saying, Admiral?

Something about this 'not being a job

for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing

playboy spy?'

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's

'assistance' in my report to the

Prime Minister. But this is, still,

a naval operation.

M

What do they say in Russia, General

Bukharin?

(asks questions in

flawless Russian)

GENERAL BUKHARIN

'In a joint operation, someone's nose

always gets put out of joint.'

M

I'm interested in success, Admiral.

Not who gets credit.

(turning to:)

Mr. Tanner: What have we got?

TANNER

(ironically)

A regular terrorist swap meet. Death

at discount: Two Chinese Long March

Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack

helicopters -

BUKHARIN

(interrupting)

Stolen -

TANNER

And the crates look like American M-16

assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel

mines, six French Exocet missiles, and

75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of

Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.

(beat)

Something for everyone. Fun for the

whole family.

M

(freezing him with a glance)

What about ID's?

TANNER

(pushes a button on a console)

One to seven: Deal the face cards.

TANNER

Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former

East German STASI agent. Ties to the

Beider-Meinhoff gang.

(pressing a button)

Aces high, seven. Bid to the east.

TANNER

Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war

criminal; thought to be operating

freelance out of Teheran.

(pressing a button)

Full house, seven. Bid to the North.

TANNER

Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious

fanatic. Wanted for the Tokyo subway -

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

(impatiently, cutting him off:)

I've seen enough. Let's finish this.

(ordering M:)

Tell your man to drop back. We're

initiating plan B -

M

But -

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

- Thank you, M. But this is more

than your man can handle.

(to Bukharin)

Are we in agreement?

BUKHARIN

(hesitant, at first)

- Yes. Yes.

M

Admiral -

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

Command to Nelson: Authorization to

fire.

CAPTAIN

Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire.

On my count: Five. Four. Three. Two -

FIRING OFFICER

Cruise missile away -

FIRING OFFICER'S VOICE (Cont'd)

Time to target: Four minutes.

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

I appreciate your assistance, M. But

this is now a military operation.

M

(urgently, to Tanner)

Bring up the tracking satellite. And

get 007 out of there.

TANNER

One to seven: Exit target area.

Repeat -

BOND'S VOICE

Seven to one. Negative. Wait.

TANNER

Oh, no.

M

Who is it?

TANNER

(calling up his stats)

Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear

specialist.

M

Meaning there may be nuclear material

down there?

VOICE FROM WARSHIP

Time to target: Three minutes.

(sfx: Beep!)

Target acquired. Weapon armed.

M

Who is that?!? What's in the box??

TANNER

(punching buttons)

I don't know. He's not in the database -

M

(to Bukharin)

What's in the box, General?

(he shrugs)

What's in the box???

M

Will it go off?

TANNER

Maybe. Maybe not.

M

Abort the cruise.

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

It's too late -

M

GET BOND OUT OF THERE.

TANNER

One to seven - one to seven -

BOND

Negative, one. NOT YET.

TANNER

Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield,

one kiloton.

M

Will the cruise set it off?

TANNER

Yes.

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

(to Bukharin)

Jesus. Can't you people keep

anything locked up?

GENERAL BUKHARIN

We didn't know it was missing.

M

Get me the Prime Minister. Alert

NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon.

(presses a button:)

Seven: This is a direct order. I

want you out of there. Do you copy?

TANNER

God help him.

VOICE FROM WARSHIP

Time to target: Thirty seconds.

BOND'S VOICE

Seven to base. I have a full

house. Your bid.

BOND

By the way: Thank the General for all

his "assistance." Over and out.

BOND

(running a finger across her lips)

... And what do you call these?

JENNY WU

Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

BOND

Indeed they are.

(kisses them, lightly)

Deadly little things.

BOND

And what do you call these? The Gang

of Two?

JENNY WU

(smacking his hand, laughing:)

Stop it!

BOND

I was just getting to the interesting part!

JENNY WU

We've already done the interesting

part. Do you forget?

BOND

Remind me.

JENNY WU

Sakwa!

BOND

Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?

JENNY WU

Mandarin. You jerk.

(tousling his hair)

I'm late. I have to get dressed.

BOND

(lightly)

Hello -

(catching himself)

Hello.

MONEYPENNY

Hello, James. I hope I'm

interrupting something important.

BOND

Not at all, Moneypenny. I was just

brushing up on a little Chinese.

MONEYPENNY

I'm sure she is, James. But I'm

afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the

rest of your lessons this afternoon.

BOND

(mock chagrin)

Moneypenny... Here I was, finally

getting a feel for a new tongue -

MONEYPENNY

Four o'clock. M will meet you in the

conference room.

BOND

4:30. It may take me a little longer

to wrap things up here.

MONEYPENNY

Four o'clock. Don't be late.

BOND

(hanging up:)

Tsi tien, Chien-penny.

MONEYPENNY

Ah, James. You always were a cunning

linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

MONEYPENNY

Don't ask.

M

Don't tell.

(walking away)

I don't want to know.

STUDENT

Good afternoon, Professor Wu.

JENNY WU

Good afternoon.

(then to Bond)

Are you sure you can't stay for the

lecture?

BOND

I can't. But I did enjoy the dress

rehearsal.

JENNY WU

Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.

BOND

Tsi tien, Professor Wu.

HNN ANCHOR

You're watching HNN, the Harmsway 24

hour news network. Coming up:

(mortise shot of:)

Valentin Zukofsky's stunning victory in

the Ukrainian Presidential elections...

(mortise shot of:)

Live coverage of the latest HNN

communications satellite launch from

Xichang (shi-chung) China... And -

(mortise shot of:)

A special report on the situation in

Hong Kong, since the Chinese take-

over from Great Britain.

COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART

To sum up: After analyzing the tire

inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6

video tape, NATO believes the "red

box contains approximately eighty

kilograms of U235 weapons grade

uranium - an incredibly hard,

incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal

substance.

M

And that's enough enriched uranium to

produce how many nuclear devices?

COL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART

Depending on the builder's sophistication

- one crude bomb that could devastate

London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all

four if they have the latest technology.

M

And the participants?

COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART

(pointing at the screen)

Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North

Korean nuclear weapons specialist;

apparently fell out of favor with the

current North Korean regime after a

botched attempt to steal fissionable

material from a British light-water

reactor in South Africa - an accident

that left him entirely hairless...

COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd)

And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as

Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary,

Laos and Cambodia. His father was

from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con-

scripted by the British government to

fight in China during World War II -

after which the family settled in

Hong Kong, where the young Stamper

was undoubtedly treated like a second

class citizen by both the Hong Kong

Chinese, and local British.

(beat, aside:)

We've all read about the signs at the

British swimming pools in Hong Kong

that said "No Ghurka's allowed."

BOND

Nothing like a little imperialism to

promote loyalty among the faithful.

COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART

(stifles a smile, then:)

In conclusion: Both these men have a

vendetta against the world. They are

nuclear armed, and dangerous. And

having failed to get the UZ35 through

the old opium route - the Khyber Pass

- it's NATO's belief that their next

attempt will be through Bulgaria -

where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force

will be there to stop them.

M

Thank you Colonel Everhart.

(stands, turns to:)

007, I'd like to see you in my office.

Why don't you and the Colonel exchange

numbers if you need more information?

BOND

Yes, M.

BOND

Interesting presentation.

DOMINIQUE

Interesting video tape.

BOND

They point, I shoot.

DOMINIQUE

(feels her pockets)

Do you have a pen? I just got promoted

and don't have my new cards yet.

BOND

Of course.

DOMINIQUE

... Does this do anything?

BOND

Depends what number you write.

BOND

Married?

DOMINIQUE

Happily.

BOND

... Kids?

DOMINIQUE

Three. You? Married?

BOND

No.

DOMINIQUE

(smiles)

I didn't think so.

DOMINIQUE

Here. I gave you my assistant's

phone number. If it's urgent, she

knows where to reach me.

BOND

Thanks.

(beat, holding her gaze)

Take care -

DOMINIQUE

You too.

BOND

Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting

like this. They may be on to us.

MONEYPENNY

Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?

BOND

In the darkest moments, it's what I

live for. Especially since I've

heard how much you like to watch...

On the hidden camera.

MONEYPENNY

By the way, James: Ordinarily I would

never ask, but... Weren't you and

that Colonel once stranded on a raft

for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?

BOND

Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have

you ever known me to kiss and tell?

MONEYPENNY

Actually, I've never known you to do

either... But -

BOND

- We all want what we can't have?

MONEYPENNY

Not all of us, 007.

BOND

What - no lust for adventure?

MONEYPENNY

No, 007. It's just that I've learned

from personal experience - that when

we get what we want -

(beat)

Somehow the reality is never as...

Satisfying as the fantasy.

MONEYPENNY

Don't keep M waiting.

M

Come in, 007. You know the Minister?

BOND

Of course.

(nods to)

Minister Johnstone.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

007.

M

Tell me, 007, what do you know about

Elliot Harmsway?

BOND

(quipping)

Only what I read in the newspapers.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(disdainfully)

His newspapers?

BOND

(glancing sideways)

Occasionally, yes.

(directly to M)

British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong;

controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable,

satellites; books, magazines, movies,

computer software. Theme parks.

M

(holding up a copy of:)

- Along with Tomorrow - the first

world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27

million. Daily. -

BOND

'Able to topple governments with a single

story' - as he says in his press.

JOHNSTONE

(hurrumph)

Exactly.

BOND

... What's Harmsway done?

M

It seems, 007, we've received a tip

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

A rumor - from an anonymous source -

M

- that Sir Elliot may be involved

with Stamper and Yung, and the

missing Uranium.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source

you can't identify - who insists on

talking only to 007. Nothing but

loose talk and innuendo.

M

That may be the case at present,

Minister Johnstone... But our own

sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway

used his considerable Russian media

- holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky

President of the Ukraine - in trade

for the uranium.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

BOND

Perhaps. But it does explain how an

ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms

dealer is suddenly portrayed as a

long-time friend of the people.

(beat)

If you believe what you read in the papers.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(annoyed)

Need I remind the two of you that

Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway

- is directly descended from the Earl

of Aberdeen? That his Scottish

ancestors practically invented Hong

Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,

Queen Victoria herself named the port

"Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?

M

(long pause, then:)

... No more than I need remind you,

Minister, that merely being a member

of the lucky sperm club - does not

preclude one from a life of criminal

activity.

M

The reason I invited the Minister

here, 007, was to reassure him that

this investigation will be handled

with the utmost discretion.

BOND

Of course.

M

Which is also why I've withheld this

information from NATO and our allies.

BOND

(nods, then, recalling)

... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

M

Yes. 1988. He was furious at the

British plan to return Hong Kong, and

supposedly started his own negotiations

with the Chinese Government. The inquiry

went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a

rather powerful enemy -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

Not to mention the chaos it caused at

Whitehall when his newspapers began

screaming for the recall of the

sitting government.

M

(a beat, then:)

I'm sending you to Venice, 007.

You're to check out the source,

determine whether Elliot Harmsway is

involved with the enriched uranium,

and, if so, stop him.

BOND

How will I meet the informant?

M

You're to wear this mask at the Venice

Carnival, and wait to be contacted.

BOND

I understand.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(standing, to leave)

There is one last thing, 007: Elliot

Harmsway is vital to the economic

interests of this nation. He's also

a major contributor to the party. I

expect him to be given every consideration.

BOND

Political considerations?

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

To the best of my recollection, Mr.

Bond, I suggested no such thing.

(beat, at the door)

In fact, I was never here.

M

Would you send in the new man from

equipment branch?

MONEYPENNY (O.S.)

Right away.

BOND

.... I hate to ask, but... Did you

ever think you'd miss Communism?

M

We serve the interests of the British

people, 007. No matter who we may be

foolish enough to elect.

M

But if Elliot Harmsway is involved

with that uranium, I want him

prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

BOND

Hopefully, it won't get that far.

M

Come in, Saunders.

SAUNDERS

M. 007.

BOND

Okay, Saunders. What is it this

time? Rocket in the leg? Machine

pistol in the arm?

SAUNDERS

Q's retirement party. I'd just put

the knife into the cake, and -

BOND

Come on. I know better than that -

BOND

It must do something.

SAUNDERS

Well... If you insist.

BOND

The die is cast.

SAUNDERS

Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much

time to demonstrate your new Q toys.

BOND

How is old Q?

SAUNDERS

Gone fishing.

BOND

Fishing?

SAUNDERS

Big game fishing.

(beat)

Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift

from his friends at the CIA.

SAUNDERS

In the meantime, perhaps this will

spark your interest.

(takes out a disposable lighter)

Cigarette lighter. Thumb here, press here -

BOND

Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -

SAUNDERS

Not from forty feet.

SAUNDERS

The disposable lighter also contains

a small self-detonation charge

(beat)

Depending on who - or what - you

wish to dispose of.

SAUNDERS

Stop fidgeting, 007. Next -

BOND

... Shoelaces?

SAUNDERS

Plastique explosive shoelaces.

(holding them out at length)

Cut them to regulate the size of the

blast; totally harmless until you

attach the detonator hidden in the

heel of your shoe.

BOND

(examining them curiously)

Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty'

problem?

SAUNDERS

(frowns)

Moving along -

(he produces:)

A typical plastic security card.

Name here, magnetic information

stripe here -

(pointing to)

And a code breaking microprocessor

here. Swipe it through any card

reader - anywhere - you're in.

BOND

Does it work on cash machines?

SAUNDERS

It was an authorized test. I returned the money.

BOND

(amused)

I see...

SAUNDERS

(ignoring this)

Finally, your new watch: Blue laser

here for signaling or burning

through locks; press this button, the

sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.

BOND

(needling him)

If you can't do the time, don't do

the crime?

SAUNDERS

(smirks at Bond, pauses, then)

Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last

thing: Before Q retired, he asked that

I give you one other protective device.

BOND

A wedding band??? What am I supposed

to be able to do with this?

SAUNDERS

I believe Q's exact words were:

(imitating Q, emphatically:)

"Hopefully, nothing."

BOND

...I'll give you a ring from Venice.

M

Good luck on your mission, 007.

BOND

Till death do us part.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

Buona sera, signore -

MAN

Vino?

MASKED WOMAN

I may have been followed. Meet me at

the Church in five minutes!

BOND

Looking for someone?

PARIS

Hello, James.

BOND

Paris?!? What are you doing here?

PARIS

Is that any way to say hello?

BOND

I thought your specialty was good-bye.

PARIS

Oh, James. I've missed you -

BOND

(grabbing her by the wrist)

Is this another one of your games?

PARIS

Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't

you just be nice?

BOND

I've got half the British government

breathing down my neck. I don't have

time for your nonsense.

PARIS

Don't you even miss me? Didn't I

mean anything to you?

BOND

Nothing.

BOND

What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is

this just another one of your stunts?

PARIS

(anguished)

No! He's crazy - he's insane. He

hates everybody. He's got these

plans -

(facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)

You've got to help me, James. I'm

sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I

know I was wrong - but you've got to

protect me. I know you still love -

PARIS

Do you feel better now?

BOND

(not giving an inch)

Do you?

BOND

What about the uranium?

PARIS

It's on the boat. He's holding a

press conference tomorrow.

PARIS

I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll

never leave you again.

BOND

(patting her head)

Shhhhh...

PARIS

Just hold me.

BOND

How do you know Harmsway?

PARIS

Kiss me.

PARIS

Bastard! Leave me alone!

STAMPER

Who is he?

PARIS

Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him

alone -

STAMPER

(to Thug #3)

Take her to the boat.

BOND

(to himself, flexing the cape)

So that's how he does it.

BOND

Prego, prego. Permissio.

TOURIST

Grazie.

BOND

Grazie -

THUG #2

Marco - I didn't know -

THUG #1

After him!

THUG #1

I owe you some pain.

BOND

He fought hard...

(holstering the gun)

But the case was terminal.

DISSOLVE TO:

BOND

You've confirmed all the legal

details with M?

DiGIACOMO

Si. Bueno. She's very...

'Competent.' ...For a woman.

BOND

Let's go over this one more time.

DiGIACOMO

You will investigate the boat.

You'll signal us if you find the

enriched uranium. And then -

(distracted)

Pardon.

ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY

Don Franco. I just want to say we're

voting for you in the election.

DiGIACOMO

(teasing, re: the baby)

Both of you?

ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY

(laughs)

Of course.

DiGIACOMO

Grazie, grazie. Ciao.

DiGIACOMO

So. You'll signal us if you find the

uranium -

BOND

And you'll wait until after the press

conference - and everyone is gone -

before you board the boat and arrest

him.

DiGIACOMO

Perfecto. Then we turn him over to you,

and the English government puts him on a

military transport back to London.

DiGIACOMO

Do not worry, my friend. I only want

what is best. For both of us.

DiGIACOMO

Rocco! Un Cappuccino!

HARMSWAY

...And so, it's somewhat fitting that

we are here today... To christen this

environmental research boat in Venice -

- 'Venezia' - the port where Marco

Polo sailed forth to explore the

world's great uncharted oceans...

(beat)

That 2/3 of the earth's surface where

the sharks are not working members of

the press.

HARMSWAY

With our six custom designed sea-bed

coring drills, we will probe the

long-term effects of pollution; our

sonars, radars, and research labs

will study the wind, the water, and

the sea life that so dearly feeds us.

HARMSWAY

And so, in the spirit of international

cooperation - thanking my good friend,

Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected

President of the Ukraine for all his

assistance -

HARMSWAY

I give this boat to mankind - selflessly

- in pure charity asking nothing for

myself... But the cable TV rights.

HARMSWAY

Miss Venice? If you'll do the honors -

HARMSWAY

Now I'll take some questions from the

press - even the few of you who

aren't on my payroll.

REPORTER #1

Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this

boat the Sea Dolphin II?

HARMSWAY

Actually, my first choice was 'No

Comment.' So if someone asked where

I was, I could truthfully respond 'No

Comment.'

(laughter; he points)

Over there.

REPORTER #2

Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in

negotiations to move your offices

from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?

HARMSWAY

(impishly)

No comment.

GUARD

Level one, secure.

HARMSWAY

The maiden voyage begins tonight. I

have some business in London - but

the ship will sail down the Nile,

across the South China Sea, stopping

in Australia, winding up in San

Francisco.

HARMSWAY (cont'd)

But having said that - let's get to

the real business - the only thing

that attracts newsmen faster than a

breaking story the free food and

beverage.

VALENTIN'S VOICE

Mr. James Bond!

BOND

Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise.

VALENTIN

What is it that brings you to

Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business -

(sly glance to the thugs)

Or somebody else's business?

SOFIA

Dimitri!!! You promised I could go

shopping!!

VALENTIN

(sotto, to Bond)

New mistress.

(to her, impatiently)

So? Go!

SOFIA

I need money.

VALENTIN

Here. Take an inch.

VALENTIN

Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's

free.

VALENTIN

(to the bartender)

Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred.

(to Bond)

And you?

BOND

One.

BOND

I must say, Valentin, capitalism

seems to be treating you well.

VALENTIN

(belting one back)

I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.

(then)

Off the record.

BOND

Of course. If you can't beat the

government, you might as well own it.

VALENTIN

Wait - I want you to meet a friend of

mine.

(calling out)

Elliot! Elliot! Come here.

VALENTIN

Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce

you to an old friend -

BOND

(putting out a hand to shake)

The name is Bond. James Bond.

HARMSWAY

Always nice to meet one of her

Majesty's fellow subjects...

(a nod to Valentin)

Especially one with such

distinguished friends.

BOND

You might say I've always been one of

Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.

VALENTIN

(chortling)

'Biggest followers?' He's

practically made a career' of it!!

BOND

It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.

Practically glows in the dark.

HARMSWAY

(smiles)

I can tell you're a man with an eye

for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.

(signaling off camera)

Darling! Come here.

(beat)

I want you to meet my wife.

HARMSWAY

Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce

you to James Bond.

HARMSWAY

But then... I believe you two have

already met.

DiGIACOMO

Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices

of the Italian government, I, Franco

DiGiacomo -

(pauses; smiles at a camera;

POP! A flash goes off)

Am arresting you for the illegal

possession of weapons grade enriched

uranium.

(to his underlings)

Seize the boat!

VALENTIN

I think I suddenly remembered an

urgent meeting in Moscow.

HARMSWAY

My friends, there's been a terrible mistake.

(putting his arm around DiGiacomo)

Come. Let me show you.

BOND

Paris -

PARIS

Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!

BOND

Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't

it in our files?

PARIS

(anguished)

He didn't want anyone to know. He

kept it out of the papers. He said a

third wife was bad for his image.

(beat)

You've got to protect me!

BOND

Go to my hotel room. I'll be there

in twenty minutes.

PARIS

Just - say it. Say it just once.

BOND

(pauses, discomfited)

One thing at a time. I'll see you

in twenty minutes. Go.

HARMSWAY

I believe this is what you're looking

for, Colonel.

HARMSWAY

Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -

(runs the Geiger counter over it)

It's depleted uranium! Completely

safe! A child could sleep on it.

HARMSWAY

I received it from the Russian

government - a by-product of their

nuclear arms program - in the hopes

that I could create tools for

oceanographic research.

(beat)

It's what I was talking about:

'Swords into plowshares'! The Sprit

of International Cooperation!

DiGIACOMO

Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies.

(snaps his fingers to a lackey:)

Give him the video tape.

HARMSWAY

Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go

upstairs, and enjoy the reception.

HARMSWAY

Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.

HARMSWAY

I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.

BOND

Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?

HARMSWAY

(icily)

A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't

screw with a man who buys ink by the

ton.

(beat)

It's deadlier than uranium.

BOND

(staring him down)

We'll see about that.

HARMSWAY

Aren't you late for a meeting?

BOND

The Danielli. Presto!

YUNG

That was too close.

HARMSWAY

Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the

message. So will his boss.

HARMSWAY

I'm going to the plane. Tell the

captain to set sail at once.

BOND

Paris? Paris?

DiGIACOMO'S VOICE

Signore Bond?

DiGIACOMO

You're under arrest.

CUT TO:

NAVIGATOR

We've cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir.

CAPTAIN

Position?

GPS OFFICER

Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a

hundred fourteen degrees, five

minutes, ten seconds east.

CAPTAIN

Coming about, sir.

CAPTAIN

Orders from London: For the next

ninety-six hours, we're to run on

full radio silence. Double watches,

full alert.

(beat)

We're to send one encrypted positioning

burst to London every six hours -

otherwise, zero electronic emissions.

CAPTAIN (cont'd)

Inform the men, then run a surprise

inspection. If someone paints us, I

don't want this ship showing up on their

radar screen like some god-damned

Harrod's Christmas tree.

FIRST OFFICER

Yes, sir!

CAPTAIN

I'll be in my cabin until oh-six-

hundred hours.

SECOND OFFICER

Captain leaving the bridge.

FIRST OFFICER

Attention all hands. Now hear this...

FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)

We will rig immediately for

electronic silence. All electronic

gear is to be shut down...

FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM)

All personal radios, video devices

and computers will be stowed at once.

ENGINEER

Check the engine baffles; rig the

generators for shielded operation.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

Communications set to receive only, sir.

RATING

Radar switched to passive mode; sonar

re-set to low-power operation.

(beat)

You couldn't find our signature with

a magnifying glass.

FIRST OFFICER

Let's hope so.

SECOND OFFICER

Looks like we're in for a long,

uncomfortable trip.

FIRST OFFICER

We'll all breathe a lot easier when

we get this cargo back to London.

CUT TO:

HARMSWAY

Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry

to bring you here under these

circumstances, but

(beat)

Considering our meeting was already

scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.

HARMSWAY (cont'd)

Number One, your report?

NUMBER ONE

Sir Elliot: The entertainment division

is releasing three new animated

children's movies this year.

(pause)

By the time we're finished promoting

them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper,

and magazine outlets -

(pause)

There won't be a parent in the universe

who won't feel guilty if they don't take

their children to our stores and theme

parks to buy the toys, books, video-

games and clothing featuring our

'lovable little creatures.'

(pause)

We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion

dollars.

HARMSWAY

Excellent, Number One. Build a better

rat-trap, and the world truly will beat

a path to your theme park.

(turns to)

Number Two?

NUMBER TWO

As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our

software division has introduced a new

computer operating system, Gates '99.

(beat)

It's deliberately filled with bugs -

so people will be forced to buy our

upgrades over the next five years.

(beat)

The window on revenues is 2.8 billion.

HARMSWAY

Outstanding, Number Two.

(beat, remembering:)

By the way - Number Five - ?

(a man looks up)

Who's ahead in the American elections?

NUMBER FIVE

The Democrat, sir. By nine points.

HARMSWAY

Maybe it's time to publish that story

about his sex life. Even things up.

A close race is always better for our

TV ratings.

NUMBER FIVE

Consider him slimed, sir.

HARMSWAY

Splendid. Next...

(with noticeable reserve)

Number Three. Your report?

NUMBER THREE

I regret to inform you, sir, that

Saddam Hussein is still demanding a

bonus for his role in the Gulf War.

HARMSWAY

...Haven't we already paid him for his services?

NUMBER THREE

Yes, sir. But he still feels his

people should share in the increased

profits of our news division. He has

proposed an additional 500 million

dollar payment.

HARMSWAY

... And there's no truth that 10% of

that money will go into your Swiss

bank account?

NUMBER THREE

No sir! I swear! This is not true!!

HARMSWAY

You disappoint me, Number Three.

NUMBER THREE

Please sir. Please -

HARMSWAY

...But because I am a just man, I've

decided to give Mr. Hussein what he

deserves.

HARMSWAY

Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.

NUMBER THREE

(overwhelmed with gratitude)

Thank you sir! Thank you!

HARMSWAY

Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.

HARMSWAY

Let's proceed with new business.

HARMSWAY

Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we

are going to initiate phase one of

the word's most perfect crime: The

biggest theft in the history of mankind.

(beat, pointing with a laser)

Right here. In the Strait of Malacca.

STAMPER

Gum?

NUMBER THREE

Thank you! Thank you so much. You

must thank Sir Elliot for me.

STAMPER

(producing a NEWSPAPER)

Here. Something to read on the plane.

STAMPER

Bye-bye.

CUT TO:

NAVIGATION OFFICER

... This doesn't make sense. What's

our heading now?

HELMSMAN

Zero one three. Due north.

HELMSMAN

We're on course again.

FIRST OFFICER

Can't see a damn thing in this fog.

(calling out)

Rating: What have we got?

RATING

A passenger ferry and two freighters

broadcasting on low-band -

COMMUNICATIONS

And two small fishing boats about 30k

north. No radar, but we've

identified their engine signatures.

HELMSMAN (O.S.)

Damn. It's doing it again.

FIRST OFFICER

(joining him)

What's wrong?

HELMSMAN

About every ninety seconds, the auto-

pilot jogs us to the west.

HELMSMAN

Then re-sets us to the north.

HELMSMAN (cont'd)

The Captain wants us on the East side

of the channel. ...Cross current?

FIRST OFFICER

Not in the Strait.

(to the Navigator)

How's our position?

NAVIGATING OFFICER

According to the satellite, we're

exactly on course.

FIRST OFFICER

Did you check the auto-pilot?

HELMSMAN

The back-up does the same thing.

FIRST OFFICER

Check it again. What about the global

positioning satellite? Could there be

something wrong with the signal?

GPS OFFICER

Two words: Im-possible.

FIRST OFFICER

How is it now?

HELMSMAN

Seems to be back to normal, sir.

SONAR OPERATOR

I have something off the port bow!

SONAR OPERATOR (cont'd)

100 meters out, just below the surface.

(adjusts the controls)

A meter in diameter; ten - twelve

meters long. ...Floating vertically?

FIRST OFFICER

A dead head.

(off the others' quizzical looks)

Water logged timber. Floats straight

up. You sometimes see them on the east

side of the channel - from the logging

camps on Sumatra - but they don't

usually float this far west.

(calling out)

Muncy! Engines to half!

HELMSMAN

Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

FIRST OFFICER

(explaining)

Chew up a log like that in the

propeller, you end up with enough paperwork

to go from here to London. Twice.

FIRST OFFICER

Punch up the radar -

RADAR OPERATOR

I've got it, sir. A large craft -

XX,OOO tons. Range -

(disbelief)

200 yards? It's anchored in a cove!

FIRST OFFICER

That's impossible! We're in the

middle of the channel!

JUNIOR OFFICER

Breakers off the port bow! We're

heading for shore!

SONAR OFFICER

Sir -

FIRST OFFICER

(reacting to the Jr. Officer)

Full stop!!! Call the captain!

SONAR OFFICER

Sir!

FIRST OFFICER

(annoyed)

What?!?!

SONAR OPERATOR

The log is moving!

SENIOR OPERATOR

(on the intercom)

We've been hit! We're taking water!

DAMAGE CONTROL

Flooding in the engine room!

FIRST OFFICER

Get me damage reports! Start the pumps!

SECOND OFFICER

(holding out a ship's phone)

It's the Captain -

THE CAPTAIN

What the hell is going on?!?

FIRST OFFICER

(intercut if necessary)

I think we've been holed, sir!

THE CAPTAIN

On my way!

HELMSMAN

The engines are gone!

DAMAGE CONTROL

Flooding on D deck!

FIRST OFFICER

Sound the general alarm! Seal all

compartments!

SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)

Attention all hands -

SECOND OFFICER (continuing)

Proceed to emergency stations -

SYSTEMS OFFICER

We've lost power!

FIRST OFFICER

Go to back up generators!

SECOND OFFICER (into intercom)

Repeat: Seal all compartments, and -

SECOND OFFICER (on intercom)

Proceed to emergency stations at once!

DAMAGE CONTROL

Flooding on C-Deck!

FIRST OFFICER

Where the hell are those generators?

SYSTEMS ENGINEER

Coming up, sir!

FIRST OFFICER

Get those pumps working!

SYSTEMS CONTROL

The back-up is gone!

DAMAGE OFFICER

Flooding up to B-Deck!

HELMSMAN

We can't hold out much longer, sir!

FIRST OFFICER

Where the hell is the Captain?!?!

HELMSMAN

Slipping to stern!

DAMAGE OFFICER

All major compartments flooded!

FIRST OFFICER

Abandon ship! Break radio silence!

Send our position!

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

(calling out)

What's our position?

GPS OFFICER

(reading off his screen)

One hundred degrees, thirty-one

minutes, and seven seconds East, by

two degrees, twenty-nine minutes, ten

seconds, North.

SONAR OPERATOR

Six. That's it? Only six of us?

COOK

Most of the crew never made it to

their life jackets. The Captain?

SONAR OFFICER

(shrugs, then:)

The First officer stayed on the bridge.

CREWMAN

Hey - look! Over there!

HARMSWAY

Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?

STAMPER

We've decoded their last transmission.

HARMSWAY

Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here.

(then)

Time for phase two. You can get the

men in the water.

YUNG

You heard him. Get the men in the water!

WOMAN

I can't believe it took us so long to

finally get together! What exactly

do you do for the government?

BOND

(after a beat)

You might say... 'Public relations.'

WOMAN

How fascinating! I bet you meet all

the most fabulous people.

MAITRE D'

Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a call.

BOND

Moneypenny! You're early. You

weren't supposed to call until -

(he stiffens)

Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

Good evening. I've just spoken with

the Prime Minister at the economic

summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a

full update within the hour.

(beat)

For those of you still unaware, some

forty minutes ago -

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

(interrupting)

Excuse me, but -

(all turn to him:)

I must formally protest this meeting.

Given the nature of what's occurred -

and the need for secrecy - I see no

reason to involve the air force, the

army, or MI-6.

(beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look)

This is an internal affair that should

be handled strictly by the officers of

her Majesty's Royal Navy.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(furious)

Admiral, are you suggesting -

BOND

Sorry I'm late -

M

Actually, you're just in time.

(she turns to)

Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander

Bond, don't you?

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

(deflated)

Yes. Of course.

BOND

I've looked forward to meeting you.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

As I was saying: Approximately forty-

five minutes ago, we received an abandon

ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable.

(flicks on a map display)

Looking at these infrared satellite

images - provided by Mr. Tanner of

MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here,

just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she

broadcast her last position.

CUT TO:

STAMPER

Divers approaching the hull.

HARMSWAY (O.S.)

(into microphone)

To the right, towards the stern.

DIVER

(through speaker)

It's titanium. we can't cut through.

STAMPER

I'll do it.

HARMSWAY (into microphone)

Divers, stand aside.

HARMSWAY

Gentlemen: I do believe we've struck

gold... Four minutes ahead of schedule.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(incredulous)

One-third of the British gold reserves?!?

(beat)

What kind of idiot loses -

(looks to the treasury officer)

What is it? The equivalent of ten

billion US dollars???

TREASURY OFFICIAL

(sheepishly)

Give or take. Depending on today's

currency rates -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(ignoring him)

What the hell was the gold doing on

that boat?

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

We were bringing it back from Hong

Kong. Under orders from the Treasury.

TREASURY OFFICIAL

During the cold war, we stored a

third in America, and another third

in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear

attack. And with the turn-over of

Hong Kong to the Chinese -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

Why wasn't the ship protected?!?!

Why was it sailing without radar?

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

I resent your tone, sir. I have men

who are missing -

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

And I have the entire British economy

to worry about.

BOND

(breaking in)

Minister -

(all turn to him)

Obviously, MI-6 was not involved in

this operation. But I have to defend

the Admiral.

BOND (cont'd)

Electronic silence was the safest way

to move that gold. Otherwise, any

country - or individual - with the

crudest missile could just lock onto

our signals, and take out the boat.

(beat)

That's what happened to the Sheffield

in the Falklands.

(beat)

Since then, it's standard operating

procedure for any sensitive shipment.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

(frowns)

At least we know where the gold is.

When are the recovery ships due?

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

36 hours. They've already sailed

from the Persian gulf.

MINISTER JOHNSTONE

I expect to have that gold recovered

in 36 hours. Until then, I'm

imposing my own electronic silence:

For the sake of the economy, not a

word to NATO, the press, the CIA.

(beat, looking at:)

...And so long as Commander Bond here

seems to be such an expert on these

matters, I want him to go along as an

observer. Are we agreed?

ROEBUCK

Yes.

BOND

Yes.

M

As you wish.

HARMSWAY

Remember the golden rule, Mr.

Stamper: He who has the gold, rules.

HARMSWAY

Is the helicopter ready?

STAMPER

Fueled and waiting.

HARMSWAY

Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.

M

...You're turning into quite the

politician, 007.

BOND

I have an excellent teacher.

(sideways glance)

'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

M

(ignoring his jibe)

What do you make of all this?

BOND

It doesn't quite add up.

BOND

The infrared satellite images. No

heat, no flame, no explosion. If

that boat went down where they said

it did, there should have been some

residual heat reading on the surface.

M

Sabotage?

BOND

A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't

just vanish into thin air.

M

I've already contacted our station in

Kuala Lumpur. They're lining up a

local contact.

(beat)

I want you to find that gold, and

secure it.

BOND

... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move

his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur?

M

Contrary to what you may believe,

007, the world is not filled with

mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,

stock them with big-breasted women,

and threaten the world with nuclear

annihilation.

M (cont'd)

The case is closed. The Italian

authorities ruled the girl a suicide.

We had enough trouble keeping your

name out of the media. For

everyone's sake -

(beat)

Your job is to find the gold. Not

settle some personal score with

Elliot Harmsway.

GENERAL LI

And that is the fifth document. With

your counter-signature, the sale will

be complete.

YOUNG CHINESE LAWYER

Are you sure? If we waited -

HARMSWAY

General Li: My young associate here

has just informed me that if I waited

a year, I could perhaps receive a

higher price for this building.

(beat, wryly)

He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did

my ancestors. With obvious results.

HARMSWAY (cont'd)

Yet to sell this building for more

money - to profiteer - would run counter

to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual

trust and obligation; it would violate

the ancient principles of feng shui -

(beat)

- the reason we sign five documents

instead of an unlucky four, and why this

building has a fifth, non-functioning

ventilation shaft on its roof.

(beat)

Wind and water, fire and rain, earth

and sky - feng shui. All things - at

one, in balance, with nature.

GENERAL LI

...Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot.

HARMSWAY

Thank you, General Li. Now I'll just

sign this last document -

HARMSWAY (cont'd)

Terribly sorry. Mr. Stamper?

GENERAL LI

Sir Elliot! Red ink -

HARMSWAY

Of course! How foolish. More bad

luck. I'll just borrow yours -

HARMSWAY

An old Chinese toast to our friends...

HARMSWAY

Confusion to the enemy. In 48 hours,

that building - and all of Hong Kong

around it - will cease to exist.

CREWMAN 1

Sounding: Bottom is thirty fathoms.

CREWMAN 2

Nothing. Negative bounce.

BOND

We should be right over it.

OPERATOR 2

Wait - I'm getting something.

BOND

Where? What is it?

OPERATOR 2

Not sure yet -

OPERATOR 2

The Shinjuku. Japanese troop

carrier. World War II.

BOND

Let's make another pass.

CO-PILOT

(calling out)

We have traffic on the deck -

BOND

Get rid of them.

PILOT (on pa speaker)

Please leave the area. please leave

the area.

YOUNG MALE ASSISTANT 1

Good morning Sir Elliot! Welcome to

Kuala Lumpur -

HARMSWAY

Morning, morning all. What have we got?

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

The Canadian Prime Minister wants to

set a lunch -

HARMSWAY

Pencil it in for the next trip -

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

The American presidential candidate called

to complain about that sex story -

HARMSWAY

Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution,

and explain I have no control over

what my journalists write -

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

Your bankers want an answer about the

Brazilian TV stations

HARMSWAY

No -

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

The Queen invited you to dinner -

HARMSWAY

Yes -

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

HARMSWAY

Excellent.

HARMSWAY

Morning, all my golden retrievers.

What kind of havoc shall we create in

the world today?

NEWS EDITOR 1

- A ferry sank and burned in

Pakistan; 457 dead.

HARMSWAY

Good.

NEWS EDITOR 2

American jetliner down in Omaha -

HARMSWAY

Better.

NEWS EDITOR 3

Economic summit ends in Tokyo -

HARMSWAY

Boring -

NEWS EDITOR 1

Riots broke out at the World Cup soccer

finals -

HARMSWAY

Dog bites man.

(explains)

Man bites dog is a news story. Riots at

the World Cup soccer finals is a social

announcement. Next?

NEWS EDITOR 4

This just came in: There's something

up with the British Navy in the

Strait. Rescue planes, helicopters;

two ships supposedly sailing from the

Persian gulf. They just chased away

one of our news boats.

HARMSWAY

(feigning complete innocence)

Is that so?

NEWS EDITOR 4

Yeah. Sounds like a plane went down

or something... Either way, they're

calling it - all together now:

ALL AT TABLE

"A routine training exercise."

HARMSWAY

I'm shocked!! Issue the usual vehement

protest: Freedom of the press, people's

right to know... Lather it up with a lot

of righteous indignation.

(off their laughter)

Next?

BOND

Still nothing?

CO-PILOT

Commander Bond: They've found one of

the crewman's bodies!

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Yo! Jimbo!

BOND

Wade, what the hell are you doing here?

WADE

I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has

absolutely no knowledge of the

missing ship, the missing gold, where

it was going, or when it left Hong

Kong.

BOND

That's reassuring.

WADE

Hey - the world is my office.

BOND

Let's take a look at the body.

WADE

Smells like... Coffee plants.

WADE

Colorful... Shark attack?

BOND

I don't think so. The veins are

cauterized - as if they were sealed

by heat...

(beat, confounded)

But there are no burn marks on the

flesh. It doesn't make sense.

(to the policeman)

Who found the body?

POLICE OFFICER

(points to)

Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came

in with the tide early this morning.

BOND

Ask him if it could have washed in

from the west side of the Strait.

POLICEMAN

No. He says it's not possible. The

current could have only brought the

body in from the east.

BOND

(to Wade)

You have a boat?

WADE

I don't know if you'd call it a boat...

BOND

Something with an engine? Not oars?

WADE

Step into my office.

WADE

What do you want with the Harbor Master?

BOND

Tide and current charts. Work

backward from the body - find where

the ship sank.

(Wade nods appreciatively)

Where did you get the boat?

WADE

Seized it from a guy smuggling

computer chips out of Bangkok.

(beat)

Should have seen his rose garden:

Blooms the size of hand grenades.

BOND

Over there.

WADE

I think I've just seen my next future

ex-wife.

BOND

(seeing they're about to crash)

Not if you kill us first - unless

that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

WADE

By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened

to that girl - in Cuba - ?

BOND

Natalya?

WADE

Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

BOND

She married a hockey player.

WADE

I envy your 'undercover' assignments.

BOND

(a look, then)

We work in the dark. We do what we can.

HARBOR MASTER

Wind, tide, currents... You're the

second person today asked for a full

set of charts.

(holds out a clipboard)

If you'd just sign here -

BOND

Thanks.

(apparent afterthought)

By the way - was there anything

strange the night before last? Odd

weather, lost boats - ??

HARBOR MASTER

No... Unless you're talking about

the bus problem.

BOND

...Bus problem?

HARBOR MASTER

Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He

runs the line across the Strait

between here and Sumatra. The lumber

mill workers coming back for the

weekend missed the last bus. Slept

on the docks. Hundreds of them.

BOND

Thanks.

BOND

I have to get these to London. Do

you know this Captain Cheong?

WADE

Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur

yacht club.

BOND

Can you arrange a meeting?

WADE

Hell. The CIA built that club.

WADE

Okay gentlemen. The name of the game

is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything

is wild!

CAPTAIN CHEONG

In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat

is even five minutes late, one begins

to worry, Mr. Bond.

BOND

I know. Pirates from Sumatra want

the cargo; smugglers from Thailand

and Burma want the ships.

CAPTAIN CHEONG

Sometimes kill the crew; other times -

(points to his eye)

Torture them.

BOND

I'm sorry.

CAPTAIN CHEONG

The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles

off-course that night. Captain blamed

the auto-pilot; I suspected he was

drunk - until the Sumatra ferry

captain had same problem.

BOND

Did you test the auto-pilots? The

satellite positioning receiver?

CAPTAIN CHEONG

Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.

(chuckles)

My 90 year old grandfather thinks

'Ghost in the computer - Silicon

Dragon.'

BOND

(smiles, standing to leave)

I appreciate your time -

CAPTAIN CHEONG

Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch.

Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody

knows more about the Strait.

BOND

Where can I find him?

CAPTAIN CHEONG

Him? He, is a she -

(points)

at the bar.

SIDNEY

Bourbon. Neat.

BOND

I wonder if you handle your liquor

more carefully than you handle your boat.

SIDNEY

Sometimes, you just have to plunge

into things. Be reckless.

BOND

- And I bet you always leave turmoil

in your wake.

SIDNEY

(thinking, 'not bad')

Have we met?

BOND

This afternoon. Our boats practically

kissed in the harbor.

(holds out his hand to shake)

James Bond.

SIDNEY

Sidney Winch.

BOND

Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

(to Sidney)

And another for you?

SIDNEY

No. But you can buy a drink for my

friend, Taro.

BOND

Boyfriend?

SIDNEY

Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.

BOND

Pity.

(to Bartender)

Bring him whatever he wants.

SIDNEY

So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,

Mr. Bond?

(beat)

Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage?

Running from some poor little girl

with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in -

London?

BOND

Actually, I'm here on business. You

might say it was a... Golden opportunity.

SIDNEY

(a chill in her voice)

And exactly what business are you in,

Mr. Bond?

BOND

Insurance. Lloyds of London.

SIDNEY

(daggers in her voice)

The Strait can be a very dangerous

place, Mr. Bond. A few words

scribbled on a piece of paper in

London doesn't carry a lot of value

out here. Including life insurance.

BOND

I'll keep that in mind.

SIDNEY

(looking off)

I see my date is here.

(to Taro)

And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.

BOND

Nice to run into you again.

SIDNEY

Let's not make it a habit.

TARO

I think you should go -

BOND

Not quite yet, Taro -

SIDNEY

Uncle Elliot!!

TARO

I said you should -

WADE

Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -

(seeing Taro)

What happened?

BOND

He tied one on.

GIRL ONE

Good morning!

GIRL TWO

Good morning.

GIRL THREE

(calling back into the cabin)

He's arrived.

Q'S VOICE

You're late 007. I've been expecting

you.

BOND

Q! How are you?

Q

Retired. I'm not getting paid to

help you save the world anymore.

BOND

I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -

Q

That hardly makes up for the imposition.

(beat)

Now, for what I hope will be the very

last time - pay attention, 007.

(he unfurls a map:)

First, computer generated retrograde

analysis map. Body here, meteorolog-

ical influences here, likely vector-

ing of the ship's coordinates here.

BOND

Do you have any idea of what any of

that means? In English?

Q

Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.

(reaches for a Filofax sized device)

Next, your new personal communicator.

(flips it open)

Picture-phone, fax, beeper.

BOND

(taking it)

Do I have to dial '9' to get out?

Q

I don't care who you dial, so long as

it's not me. Next -

Q

Your new car. (Insert name)

BOND

(interrupting)

- Four wheel drive?

Q

Yes. And do try to keep all four of

them on the road.

(continuing)

All the usual refinements: Smoke,

missiles, machine guns -

(shows him a key fob)

Fully operational remote control.

Drives forward, reverse -

(Bond presses a button,

opening a window)

Stop that!

(grabbing it away)

Plus infrared thermal imaging radar,

heads up instrumentation, and 17

beverage cup holders.

BOND

... 17 Beverage cup holders?

Q

Standard equipment. The world's

automobile manufacturers seem to be

in some kind of mad war to see who

can provide the most beverage cup

holders.

BOND

I must say, Q, you seem to be doing

rather well in your retirement.

Q

Don't even think about it. 007.

They're my granddaughters.

BOND

Slow down. We're close.

WADE

I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out

here. How could they get this far

off course?

BOND

(concentrating on the sonar)

Who knows? Fog, night...

WADE

They'd never sail this close to the shore.

BOND

Wait a minute -

(beat, pointing to the

screen)

I've got it. There! Off the port bow!

BOND

Cut the engines! It's about two-

hundred fifty feet down.

JUMP CUT TO:

WADE

Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You

should really be using mixed gases.

BOND

I'll make a bounce dive. If I can

keep my bottom time short, I'll be

all right.

BOND

(only half teasing)

Keep your eye out for pirates.

WADE

I got you covered.

BOND

That's reassuring.

CUT TO:

TARO

Uzi beats knife.

BOND

...Interesting point.

TARO

Get him up. Take his belt.

(motioning to Wade)

Take the two of them to the Captain.

TARO

By the way. I almost forgot.

(smashing Bond)

I owed you one.

WADE

(sniffs the air)

Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.

WADE

Hey - it could be worse. At least

they speak English.

BOND

...Somehow, that's not reassuring.

TARO

Here they are, Captain.

SIDNEY

Just give me one goad reason - Mister

Bond, from Lloyds of London - why I

shouldn't kill both of you, burn your

boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.

WADE

(chirping up)

So you two know each other!?! Small

world, ain't it? What happened?

Commitment problems?

SIDNEY

Who is he?

BOND

Sidney Winch, meet -

WADE

Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial

loan division. If you're ever lookin'

for a sweet refinance on the boat -

SIDNEY

- Shut up!

BOND

(to Wade)

You have to excuse Miss Winch: She

thinks she's on a 'seduce and

destroy' mission through life...

(pauses)

...But she won't kill us.

SIDNEY

No?

BOND

No. First, because I don't think

it's in your nature. And second,

because there's no gold down there.

SIDNEY

So charming! So suave!

(beat)

Don't insult me. I'm not one of your

'little London girls' who falls for

the lies.

WADE

So it was commitment!

SIDNEY

Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong

knows what's on that boat and I'm

claiming it. One-third of that gold is

mine.

BOND

That's fine, but - even a little

London girl knows that one third of

nothing is still nothing.

SIDNEY

Was he carrying anything?

SIDNEY

Search him.

SIDNEY

Do I have to do everything around here?

BOND

I hope so.

BOND

I hope you'll be gentle.

SIDNEY

Think about mom.

BOND

... Unusual technique.

SIDNEY

And what do you call this?

BOND

- The family jewels?

SIDNEY

What is this?

TECHNICIAN

...I don't know. I'm not sure -

CREWMAN

Boss! We got company - comin' up off

the starboard bow!

SIDNEY

(exiting, to Taro)

Bring them.

CAPTAIN MORTON

(on bullhorn)

Attention sea barge: Lay down your

weapons, and prepare to be boarded.

CAPTAIN MORTON

Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and

prepare to be boarded.

BOND

If I were you -

SIDNEY

- You're not.

BOND

(as she hoists the bullhorn)

Just remember: They think there's ten

billion dollars in gold down there.

SIDNEY

Thank you.

(clicks it on, and:)

"Now hear this: Drop dead."

BOND

Gatling gun beats Uzi.

CAPTAIN MORTON

(a tiny popinjay)

Who's in charge here?

SIDNEY

I am. What do you want?

CAPTAIN MORTON

You have precisely one minute to pull

up your anchor and be under way.

SIDNEY

Forget it. No way. I got here first.

CAPTAIN MORTON

(ignoring her)

Who's Wade?

WADE

That would be me -

CAPTAIN MORTON

(snidely)

Thanks for your message.

(turns to)

And you're Bond?

BOND

Yes -

CAPTAIN MORTON

Guard! Arrest these men! Escort

them to the cutter!

BOND

Wait a minute -

CAPTAIN MORTON

Get them out of here. If he says one

word, shoot him.

SIDNEY

(demanding)

What's your name?

CAPTAIN MORTON

Captain Morton.

SIDNEY

My name is Sidney Winch, and -

CAPTAIN MORTON

Good for you, Miss Winch. You now

have exactly 30 seconds to get this

rust bucket out of here.

SIDNEY

(furiously)

I know my rights. These are

international waters. The British

Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm

claiming it. Under international

law, I have the right to salvage

what's on that wreck.

CAPTAIN MORTON

Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should

consider hiring an attorney.

SIDNEY

I was an attorney!

CAPTAIN MORTON

Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above

that profession.

(beat)

Ten seconds. Are you leaving?

SIDNEY

No.

CAPTAIN MORTON

You leave me no alternative.

CAPTAIN MORTON

(upholstering a walkie-talkie)

Cut her anchor.

SIDNEY

You won't get away with this!

CAPTAIN MORTON

(stepping onto the bridge)

Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you

to get some steam up - before you run

aground.

SIDNEY

You bastards! Believe me - you

haven't heard the last of me!

WADE

- Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing.

CAPTAIN MORTON

It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got

half a mind to throw both of you in

the brig.

BOND

Don't you think you're overreacting?

CAPTAIN MORTON

(with great sarcasm)

Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard

all about you, sir. You were under

direct orders to act as an observer -

and yet you had to go off, on your own,

like some half-assed CIA cowboy -

(Wade reacts)

Endangering the gold, attracting that

lunatic woman, and then putting in a

distress call for us to save your

bloody hide.

BOND

(Calmly)

...That's all well and good, Captain,

save for one thing:

(beat)

There's no gold down there.

CAPTAIN MORTON

What are you talking about? We went

through all this and the ship isn't

even down there?

BOND

Yes, the ship is down there. But the

gold is gone.

CAPTAIN MORTON

That's absurd! It took two squads of

forty men fifteen days to load that

gold.

BOND

I know what I saw -

CAPTAIN

I don't care what you think you saw.

You're a damned amateur.

(beat)

Just get off my ship. Go back to

your trench-coats and your code names

- and leave the job to professionals.

BOND

(exchanges a glance with Wade, then)

Aye-aye, Captain.

WADE

Where to now, Jimbo?

BOND

(thinking)

I'm not certain... But I think

there's someone I want to press for

some answers in Kuala Lumpur.

BOND

Bond.

HARMSWAY'S VOICE

Hello, Mister Bond.

BOND

(with an edge)

Who is this?

HARMSWAY

Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in

K.L. and thought we might get

together for a chat...

HARMSWAY (Cont'd, O.S.)

We seemed to get off on the wrong

foot back there in Venice.

BOND

How did you get this number?

HARMSWAY

Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the

information age! Information is

currency - and with the right currency,

you can have any piece of information.

(Bond reacts, sourly)

Besides I own the phone company. What

do you say? Twenty minutes?

BOND

I'm on my way.

HARMSWAY

Let's find out exactly what he knows.

BOND

(from inside the car)

James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway.

PR WOMAN

Yes. I'm to bring you right up. The

valet will take your car -

BOND

I'd prefer to park it myself.

(off her questioning look)

Temperamental. Practically has a

mind of its own.

PR WOMAN

Don't they all?

PR WOMAN

Right this way.

PR WOMAN

(moving to a door)

Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon

editions. If you'll just follow me -

HARMSWAY

(spotting Bond, yelling:)

Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.

BOND

Sir Elliot.

HARMSWAY

Come. Let's get out of the noise.

(escorting Bond off)

- I'll give you a tour of the

building, then we'll talk.

HARMSWAY

It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the

things I own, nothing gives me as

much enjoyment as my newspapers.

HARMSWAY (cont'd)

Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I

still can't get the ink out of my veins.

BOND

Yes... A man with ink in his veins,

and blood on his hands.

HARMSWAY

We print 31 newspapers here; another

two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite

plants around the world.

BOND

... And how many of those newspapers

carried Paris Harmsway's obituary?

HARMSWAY

All of them, Mister Bond...

(motioning inside)

After you?

HARMSWAY

Before I became involved with Paris,

she was always involved with the most

inappropriate' men...

(beat)

Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle

aged Peter Pans who only brought out

the worst in her.

BOND

I see.

HARMSWAY

I tried to save her. But she remained a

manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate

behavior... Delusions of grandeur.

BOND

I wonder if it runs in the family.

HARMSWAY

(bursts out in a laugh)

The only difference between a

psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is

the degree of success.

HARMSWAY

Still, I do miss her. I only wish

she could have lived to see all this.

BOND

I can feel your pain.

HARMSWAY

By the way - what is it that brings

you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?

BOND

Sightseeing.

HARMSWAY

I call this the Rogue's gallery.

BOND

Yes. I can see: You've hung the

rest of your relatives.

HARMSWAY

(pointing to the first portrait)

My third great Uncle - the Earl of

Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of

Hong Kong from the Chinese.

(moving to)

His son-in-law - George Harmsway -

made the first family fortune,

running opium into Shanghai...

(moving to)

His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking

the opium...

And my grandfather Henry, who opened the

first telegraph station, and published

the colony's first English newspaper.

(pausing, wistfully)

It was a city of unlimited possibility.

BOND

So why did you leave?

HARMSWAY

Because it's a dying city. Since the

Chinese take-over, who knows what can

happen tomorrow?

(moving to the last two portraits)

In any case, this is my father, Charles: A

royal bastard who started the first radio

and television stations. Said I'd never

amount to anything, but...

(passing his own portrait)

I turned it into this

HARMSWAY

Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.

(starting to walk)

Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his

legions; I have my divisions:

(pointing)

News, sports, business, entertainment.

And these are my foot soldiers:

(a wave of his hand)

2000 people working on 14 floors to feed

300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87

magazines, and 29 different cable TV

channels - in 35 languages.

BOND

And still not a thing to watch.

BOND

...Although it must be fun to have

all those satellites.

HARMSWAY

They're merely tools to disseminate

information.

BOND

(wryly)

Or disinformation... If you wanted to,

say, beam down a signal to send a ship

off course? Maybe one degree a minute?

HARMSWAY

(guffaws)

Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I

should buy it for a book! It's

totally preposterous, but -

(off Bond's reaction)

You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I

can amuse you.

HARMSWAY

Let's see... First we have this

James Bond... I believe he's a field

adjuster for Lloyd's of London...

HARMSWAY

Then we have this James Bond.

HARMSWAY

(reading from the screen)

... Licensed to Kill...

(aside)

Not a bad title for that book...

(then)

Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond -

HARMSWAY

Who I believe they call "007."

HARMSWAY

You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both

men of action. But your era is passing.

Words are the new weapons; satellites the

new artillery. And make no mistake about

it: In the right hands, they can be as

deadly as your Walther PPK.

BOND

...Words to live by?

HARMSWAY

Your choice.

(glancing at his watch)

Look at the time! Come. There's

someone I want you meet - about a

story I'm thinking of publishing.

HARMSWAY

Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long -

SIDNEY

That's okay, Uncle Ell -

SIDNEY

What is HE doing here?

HARMSWAY

I see you two have met.

BOND

Briefly.

HARMSWAY

(crossing to his desk)

Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him

here hoping he might shed some light

on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of

London.'

(sly glance to Bond)

...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

SIDNEY

He's not going to tell the truth! He

was diving for the gold!

HARMSWAY

It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch

has told me the most incredible story: A

sunken British warship filled with gold;

a British cutter firing on her; billions

of dollars in bullion lying on the

bottom of the Strait.

HARMSWAY

Obviously, the British government

denies all of this -

SIDNEY

- I told you! He was there! -

HARMSWAY

- But as I've explained to Sidney,

without proof, there's just no story.

Don't you agree Mr. Bond?

SIDNEY

But I have proof! You ran out of here

so fast, I didn't get to show you.

HARMSWAY

(forcing a smile)

...And what's that, my dear?

BOND

Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

SIDNEY

He brought that up from the wreck.

HARMSWAY

...I see.

BOND

Sidney, I wouldn't -

SIDNEY

And what about this? Any idea what this is?

HARMSWAY

... I believe it's a depleted uranium

drill bit, my dear.

BOND

Why don't we just take these -

SIDNEY

(blocking him)

No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.

HARMSWAY

...Well! I do believe this requires

further investigation!

SIDNEY

Thank you, Uncle Elliot.

HARMSWAY

No matter what the British government

says, I won't kill this story.

(his secretary appears in the doorway)

Miss Oxford will show both of you to

the elevator... And one of my people

will definitely be in touch sooner

than later.

BOND

I'm sure they will.

HARMSWAY

Good-bye, Mister Bond.

HARMSWAY

Good-bye, darling.

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

Thank you both for coming in...

BOND

(glancing at the security camera)

... Do you have a gun?

SIDNEY

What?

BOND

(yanking it down)

You heard me. A gun?

(disabling it)

I left mine in the car.

SIDNEY

That's funny: you struck me as the kind

of man who always carries protection.

BOND

Listen to me! I'm a British secret

service agent. And we have about two

minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.

SIDNEY

Has anyone ever suggested that you're

a paranoid psychotic?

BOND

Harmsway sank that ship and stole the

gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.

(boosting himself up)

And thanks to your little show and tell -

(straining to open the panel)

- giving him the evidence -

(popping it open)

We're the only ones who can tie him

to the crime.

SIDNEY

Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!

BOND

Blood or Dutch?

SIDNEY

He was my father's best friend!

BOND

He's killed closer.

SIDNEY

You are seriously deranged.

BOND

Maybe. But why are we going up

instead of down?

BOND

Sidney, come with me -

SIDNEY

Not if my life depended on it.

SIDNEY

Thank God! He's crazy!

STAMPER

Does he have a gun?

SIDNEY

No.

STAMPER

Good -

SIDNEY

This is a mistake!

STAMPER

(gun against her skull)

Shut up!

STAMPER (into radio)

Open 14.

BOND

Need a lift?

STAMPER

Help me up.

BOND

(to the office workers)

... I'd try the stairs.

STAMPER

(rushing out)

The stairs!

(barking into his RADIO)

Attention all units! They're on the

71st floor!

HARMSWAY

Stamper! They're not to leave this

building alive!

SIDNEY

This has got to be a mistake.

BOND

The only mistake is that they didn't

kill us in the elevator.

BOND

Wait here.

SIDNEY

No. I'm going with you.

HARMSWAY

Where are they?

GUARD #1

I don't see them -

(scanning the monitors)

There!

HARMSWAY (OVER)

Warn him!

VOICE ON RADIO

Porter! They're behind you -

GUARD

(lifting the radio to reply)

Roger! Over and -

BOND

Out.

SIDNEY

JAMES!

SIDNEY

Okay. So it wasn't a mistake.

(Bond lets go a blast)

What do we do now? Offer them

dinner?!?!

BOND

Come here. You shoot. I'll cook.

BOND

Aim that way.

BOND

Shoot back!

BOND

One second -

BOND

... How did you get into marine

salvage?

SIDNEY

(gun burst, then)

My father left me the business.

SIDNEY

I used to be a divorce lawyer in New

York City.

BOND

Not a lot of difference.

SIDNEY

What do you mean?

BOND

Either way, you're taking the goods

from dead hulks.

BOND

Let's go -

BOND

Damn!

SIDNEY

What the hell does that do?

BOND

Cleans dirt. Let's go.

STAMPER

It's a trick! After him.

(into his radio, on the run)

They're in the south stairwell!

HARMSWAY

Get more men up there!

SIDNEY

Down?

BOND

Up.

SIDNEY

Down?

BOND

(shoots, then)

Up.

HARMSWAY

... And so much for that.

(into radio)

They're on the 72nd floor set-back.

(explains to the guards)

Nowhere to go.

SIDNEY

Now what?

BOND

That should buy us some time.

BOND

Help me move this.

GUARD

I'll call for a battering ram -

STAMPER

No. Get the fire ax.

BOND

We'll go down close to the sky bridge.

We may be able to swing over and use it

for cover.

SIDNEY

No way. I sail. I do not fly.

BOND

... Sometimes, you just have to take

the plunge.

SIDNEY

All I know is one thing: If we get

out of here alive, that gold is mine.

(beat)

I've earned it.

BOND

One thing at a time.

SIDNEY

(panicked, anxious, fast)

What now? And don't give me some

movie cliche like 'trust me.'

BOND

(what the hell)

Trust me.

BOND

Let's go -

SIDNEY

We're going to bounce off that thing!

BOND

Hold on!

STAMPER

(over radio)

They're on the bridge. Seal off the

50th floor!

HARMSWAY

(looking at the monitors)

I should have hired this man.

(to his guards)

Get somebody up there!

SIDNEY

What about the elevators?

BOND

We tried that already. Remember?

SIDNEY

You know, this is as much your fault

as it is mine.

BOND

Sidney, we don't have time for this -

SIDNEY

Sure! Just when I want to talk -

(beat)

Not that I would have believed you -

BOND

Put your back to the railing. Sit up

on it.

SIDNEY

(doing it)

Are you listening to me?

BOND

Put your arms around my neck. Lock

your legs around my waist.

SIDNEY

... We have time for that?

BOND

Sometimes you just have to -

SIDNEY

Don't say it.

SIDNEY

Is this - like - a normal day for you?

BOND

It's a lousy job, but -

(reaching for the balcony)

The only reason I stay is for the

health benefits.

STAMPER

(into his radio)

They're heading for the press room.

Stop them!

BOND

He was bad news.

BOND

Down there!

HARMSWAY (O.S.)

Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding

performance.

HARMSWAY (continuing)

I'm the certain the British taxpayers

would be impressed by your efforts.

Don't you agree?

BOND

I think they'd rather know who stole

their gold.

HARMSWAY

(chuckles)

Why, I did, of course. It's on the

Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside

of Hong Kong... Not that it will do

either of you any good to know.

(beat)

Now both of you: Stand up. And toss

the gun out, Mr. Bond.

SIDNEY

Uncle Elliot: How could you do this

to me?

HARMSWAY

Oh, please, Sidney. There's a

hundred billion dollars at stake.

(beat)

Besides, I never really liked your

father that much. He cheated at cards.

BOND

Are your guards really going to kill

a helpless girl?

HARMSWAY

My guards are from South Africa, Mr.

Bond. This is their chance to get even

with the formerly 'Great' Britain.

(beat)

Now both of you. Put your hands on

your heads, and step forward.

BOND

(trying to buy time)

What did you do, Harmsway? Make some

deal with the Chinese government for

the gold?.. Was the radioactive

uranium I found in Venice part of it?

HARMSWAY

Questions, questions, Mr. Bond...

Which I'm afraid I've neither the

time, nor the inclination to answer.

(to the guards)

Take them out to the jungle and -

BOND

I forgot to mention: The job comes

with a car.

HARMSWAY

Kill it! Shoot the damn thing -

BOND

Here. You shoot. I'll drive.

SIDNEY

...You know, that's another reason

you're probably not in a successful

relationship.

BOND

Another reason??? Did I miss something???

SIDNEY

(taking the gun)

You insist on calling all the shots.

(beat)

And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.

BOND

Aim that way.

BOND

Ready? Now!

HARMSWAY

Seal the garage! Cut the power!

He's got no headlamps!

SIDNEY

We're not going to make it!

BOND

If it's radio controlled, it'll break

the code.

SIDNEY

If not?

BOND

(pointing to a button)

We blast through.

HARMSWAY

- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.

(to Stamper, checking

Bond's pulse)

Are they alive?

STAMPER

Yes. Shall we kill them?

HARMSWAY

No. I have a better idea. In fact,

Mr. Bond may have actually improved

my original plan.

(beat)

Bring them both to Hong Kong. And

Make sure he has nothing else up his

sleeve.

ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO)

As part of our continuing report on

terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's

Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...

ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)

- Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior

engineer in charge of security.

(beat)

Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this

plant from a terrorist attack?

CHIN

Totally secure. Without codes, you'd

need a missile to blast through the

front door; you normally can't even get

this close (to the plant) without a full

security clearance.

ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER

...Could you say that a little closer

to the microphone?

CHIN

Of course. You'd need -

YUNG

(to the guards)

Now!

YUNG

Let's go!

HARMSWAY

Get the machine in the water!

POWER PLANT GUARD

What happened out there?

YUNG

A generator blew. Nothing to worry about.

(beat)

But I need one last shot of you. Why

don't you stand by the alarm?

POWER PLANT GUARD

No problem.

YUNG

(to the cameramen)

Up the stairs!

STAMPER

Put on your clothes.

(to the guard)

Cuff him.

YUNG

(to the half-dozen engineers)

I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we

need one more picture for the story.

YUNG (CONT'D)

Why don't you line up against the

wall? Let's make it a group shot.

BOND

Sleep well?

SIDNEY

Next time, I do the driving.

YUNG

The drill is in the water;

approaching the intake tunnel.

HARMSWAY

Excellent.

BOND

I see you're in your natural element,

Harmsway: A room filled with lethal

power...

(beat)

...With a toxic core at its center.

HARMSWAY

Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...

You're just in time for a nuclear

meltdown!

SIDNEY

You bastard -

HARMSWAY

Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember

you fondly.

YUNG

(calling from the console)

Approaching the first gate.

HARMSWAY

Start the grinders.

BOND

...So that's what the weapons grade

uranium was for.

HARMSWAY

Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of

minutes, the boring device will

arrive at the core of the reactor...

(beat)

And when the radioactive blades cut

into the plutonium -

BOND

- Instant melt-down.

HARMSWAY

Chernobyl will look like a campfire.

YUNG

We're through the first gate.

Approaching the second -

BOND

(demanding)

Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the

gold enough?

HARMSWAY

(to Yung)

Bore through.

(to Bond, chuckling)

...They used to say living well was

the best revenge, Mr. Bond.

(beat)

They're wrong.

(beat)

Revenge is the best revenge.

YUNG

Entering the main tunnel - ten

minutes to target -

BOND

(fiercely)

What could you possibly have to be

vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying

to prove yourself to daddy?

HARMSWAY

Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!

YUNG

You have to leave -

HARMSWAY

(enraged, ignoring Yung)

A hundred and fifty years ago, my

ancestors took this island - a

barren, lifeless rock - and turned it

into the greatest city known to

modern civilization.

(beat)

And now that I'm being forced to give

it back, I intend to return it in

exactly the same condition: A

barren, lifeless rock.

(beat)

The gold is merely reparations -

payment from the spineless British

government who wouldn't listen.

BOND

(to Sidney, glancing at the gun)

... I think Uncle Elliot is having

his own melt-down.

YUNG

Approaching the third gate -

HARMSWAY

Smash through it!

(then)

Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but

you fit perfectly in to my plans.

(he reaches for a newspaper)

Here. This just in. Newsflash.

Read all about it.

BOND

... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear

meltdown... British agent found in

reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway

calls for British government to resign.

HARMSWAY

...As the advertising says: Tomorrow

never lies.

BOND

What about the gold?

YUNG

You must go. Now. Otherwise the

boat won't be out of range -

HARMSWAY

Thirty seconds.

(then, to Bond)

That's the most brilliant part of the

plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,

I'll let the new British government -

my British government - announce that

the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong

- where no one will be able to touch

it for a hundred years.

(beat)

And just by coincidence:

HARMSWAY

...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.

(turns to Stamper)

Let's go. Put them in the airlock.

BOND

You'll never get away with it,

Harmsway. Too many people know.

HARMSWAY

Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the

crazies - the conspiracy theorists?

The Oliver Stones of the world?

(pausing, then, with great scorn:)

I'll publish their books, I'll make

their movies, I'll put them on my TV

shows!

(beat)

They're my bellboys. They carry my

luggage.

HARMSWAY

Now. Get them in the airlock.

BOND

One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And

the handcuffs. They'll give it away.

SIDNEY

No. I want to stay with him.

HARMSWAY

(breaking the moment, cynically)

How sweet.

SIDNEY

(satto, to Bond)

My timing always was lousy.

BOND

(cold and hard)

I'd rather die alone.

HARMSWAY

Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.

We'll drown her at sea.

SIDNEY

(to Bond, sarcastically)

Enjoy the rest of your life.

HARMSWAY

I'll meet you on the boat, south of

Lantau Island.

YUNG

Take the men. I can finish alone.

HARMSWAY

(to the technicians and cameramen)

You come with me -

(to the guard who handcuffed Bond)

You stay here.

YUNG

We'll cut through the last gate, then

set it on auto-pilot.

YUNG

(to the guard)

Check it out. Be careful.

HARMSWAY

Any news?

THE CAPTAIN

The call just went out on the Hong

Kong police radio: Fire at the power

plant.

HARMSWAY

(ironically)

Alert the media!

STAMPER

What do you want me to do with her?

SIDNEY

- Can't we make a deal? I won't say

anything -

HARMSWAY

(touching her cheek)

You're so cute, my dear.

(beat)

But I'm afraid not.

(to one of the cameramen)

Put her in the storage room.

HARMSWAY (CONT'D)

We'll get rid of her when we're in

International waters.

(then)

Set sail, full speed, due south.

I'll be in my cabin. Let me know

when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break

out the champagne.

CAMERAMAN

Don't get any ideas.

STAMPER

There it is.

STAMPER

It's him. They both made it.

THE CAPTAIN

I'll tell Sir Elliot.

HARMSWAY

Yes?

CAPTAIN'S VOICE

He's approaching from the north, sir.

CREWMAN

Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck

to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few

minutes.

CREWMAN

He seems to be coming in awfully fast.

STAMPER

Get the guns! It's not him! It's

Bond!!!

HARMSWAY

What the hell is going on?

THE CAPTAIN

(on a phone)

I don't know sir -

HARMSWAY

What the hell is going on?

STAMPER (O. S. )

It's Bond!

HARMSWAY

Kill him! Finish it!

STAMPER

You're mine now.

STAMPER

I'm going to do this slowly -

HARMSWAY

(barking into the radio)

Stamper! Report in!

HARMSWAY'S VOICE

(continuing, on Stamper's radio)

Report to the bridge!

BOND

I never believe what I read in the

newspapers.

HARMSWAY

Pity you'll miss your obituary.

BOND

Where is she, Harmsway?

HARMSWAY

You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.

BOND

(moving in on him)

Where is she Harmsway? -

HARMSWAY

What is it, Bond? You haven't the

guts?

BOND

You spineless paper tiger -

BOND

Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you

kill her like Paris?

HARMSWAY

(glaring, insanely:)

We all go down together!!!

SIDNEY

What do you mean, you'd rather die

alone?

BOND

I didn't say when I want to die -

BOND

... Yes???

SIDNEY

Before we go any further here, Mr.

Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just

want to get two things straight.

BOND

... Yes?

SIDNEY

First, that boat is in international

waters. I'm claiming it for salvage.

One-third of that gold is mine.

BOND

And number two?

SIDNEY

If you think we're going to have some

kind of 'life affirming' romance here

just because we cheated death, let me

be clear:

(pause)

We're going to have it where I want,

and when I want.

BOND

And when might that be?

SIDNEY

Now.

Q

... As usual, I see the situation is

in 007's very capable hands.

WADE

Life is not fair.

Q

(emphatically)

You're right.

OFFICER

Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the

message went to London.

Q

Thank you.

WADE

Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any

gardening?

Q

...The only thing I ever planted was

bugs.

M

Moneypenny, take the following release:

(beat)

The body of Sir Elliot Harmsway was

found floating in the South China Sea

this morning, at 08:00 hours local

Hong Kong time.

(pauses)

At present, local authorities believe

the media mogul committed suicide.

SIDNEY

James... Is this really what a

typical day is like for you?

BOND

Yes...

(pause)

But some days... Are longer than

others.

THE END

(save for one last line:)

James Bond will return.
