DONATO

Shit, those things will fuck up your

mind.

CRAGIE

If you gotta take a leak, do it now.

KOSALAS

I can't go wading in with my shlong

flapping in the wind.

CRAGIE

Sure you can. It's called diversionary

tactics.

BRENNAN (V.O.)

(from radio)

What's going on in the ballpark?

DONATO (V.O.)

(from radio)

Don't get froggy. Wait for the green

light.

MUSIC

Elevens, huh Victor?

(to cousins in Spanish)

This one's got some balls, huh?

(to Spider)

I don't juke anybody.

LUNA

Okay, by the numbers.

EDDIE

(to walkie-talkie)

Everybody on your toes.

MUSIC (V.O.)

(from radio)

Their Right Field's Clear. Those

painters are out of the way.

EDDIE

(to walkie-talkie)

What the hell you talking about?

MUSIC (V.O.)

(from radio)

We got a painting crew of painters

just went in the building next door.

EDDIE

Painters? That building's gonna be

condemned!

EDDIE

(shouts)

Play Ball! Play-fucking-ball!

DONATO

(to mike)

Home Team! We're goin in! Move it!

Move it!

KOSALAS

I knew it.

EDDIE

(shouts)

Police! No se mueve!

DONATO

They're goin out the front!

KOSALAS

Cragie?!

CRAGIE

It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch.

CRAGIE

(yelling into the

apartment)

Police! Stay where you are!

EDDIE

Take it easy, Kosalas.

CRAGIE

The kid didn't dust him. I did.

CRAGIE

Him or me, Sarge.

(pause)

The kid saw the whole thing.

CRAGIE

Tell him, Nick.

KOSALAS

(softly)

Yeah, that's how it went down.

EDDIE

(pause)

Stay here.

(to Cragie)

Take care of your partner.

VICTOR

(to relative)

Call Luis.

KOBAS

Get these people back out of here,

wouldja.

CRAGIE

Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A

friggin' dog and pony show. Some

dumb ass questions by dumb ass

bureaucrats. "When's the last time

you were at the range?" Crap like

that.

KOSALAS

Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why

can't you just be --

CRAGIE

(stiffens)

You born yesterday?! These ain't

cops. They'll roast our ass just

cause we carry a badge. Both of us.

(menacing)

We stick together on this, kid. We're

partners, right?

DONATO

Aw man, don't do that. You know how

much these things cost?

DONATO

Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms,

minnows. Don't even need real worms.

Storage problem. Got those rubber

ones, you know?

EDDIE

Yeah, what about the winter?

DONATO

We winter in Florida. Rubber neck

the beach bunnies. Aw, look at that.

Ruined my brand new fence climbers.

Hand made in Italy.

DONATO

Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell

her you shot me.

PARTIDA

Cusack. You were in charge here?

EDDIE

Does it look like it?

PARTIDA

(to Donato)

And you were a principal in one of

the shootings?

DONATO

OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!

PARTIDA

Where's the officer who was involved

in the other shooting?

EDDIE

(pointing)

Third floor rear.

EDDIE

Catch you later, Hopalong.

MUSIC

(to Efren)

You know that, Efren. When your big

bad brother Luis gets the word, your

ass is freeze dried and fried.

BRENNAN

Talk you hemorrhoid!

POMPAS

(in Spanish)

Your mother fucks dogs in the street.

BRENNAN

You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you

know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball?

Cause the harder you hit 'em, the

better their English gets.

EDDIE

We're jerking off here.

SANCHEZ

Let's cut the shit, Cusack.

SANCHEZ

Option 1: you can send em downtown.

If Judge Collins didn't get laid

last night, you can probably get him

to arraign my clients for loitering

in their own hallway. He'll set bail.

I'll take care of it. Option 2:

release them here and now and we'll

call it a day.

(pause)

Up to you.

EDDIE

I like to see you earn your money.

CRAGIE

We come up the back stairs. We start

cleanin' the hallway when the deceased

pops out of a doorway with a 25

automatic. I tell him to drop it,

but he's comin. We had no choice.

Kosalas here saw the whole thing.

KATES

Did you?

KOSALAS

I was on another doorway...

KATES

But you saw the action?

KOSALAS

I saw him fall.

KATES

And the kid was armed?

KOSALAS

That's the way it went down.

KATES

And you saw the weapon?

KOSALAS

(nods)

Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.

KATES

O.K.

(signs document)

Cragie, you'll be assigned to

headquarters until the hearing --

CRAGIE

Hearing? Who called for a hearing?

The little fuck tried to shoot me in

the back!

KATES

Ms. Partida --

CRAGIE

That piece of shit!

KATES

Shut-up, Cragie.

(pause)

Partida has demanded a formal hearing.

You will be under oath so the

department will provide you with a

lawyer unless you've got your own.

(stands)

An OPS Review Board member is waiting

to talk to you. Doesn't sound like

you got anything to worry about.

KATES

Kosalas, you work with Cusack until

this is over.

KOSALAS

Yes sir.

EDDIE

I ain't got no time to nursmaid a

rookie. I don't need a partner.

KATES

(explodes)

Your right! You don't need a partner!

You need a goddamn keeper!

(slams fist on desk)

Jesus Christ! How do I explain this

one upstairs?

(stands)

We gave you 600 man-hours, you took

a month planning the damn thing, and

what have you got to show for it?

Nine bodies? A dead informant? One

of my best men shot! For Christ's

sake!

(stares at ceiling)

You're going to have me back on a

beat busting perverts in the park.

EDDIE

We got a bigger problem. These

Comachos aren't gonna take this lying

down. The animals are out of the

cages.

KATES

Just what I need. A goddman war.

KATES

Keep track of this business with

Cragie?

EDDIE

Yeah.

KATES

I'll deal with upstairs.

KATES

Just get me some answers, huh.

EDDIE

That's my job.

PARTIDA

...you have the right to remain

silent. You have the right to have

an attorney present at all times.

Anything you say may be used against

you in a court of law...

EDDIE

I'm going to have to fix that.

EDDIE

You know, it's kind of interesting.

That 16 year old in the hallway with

the gun? Partida told me he doesn't

have a record. The kid's never been

arrested.

KOSALAS

Yeah, well, you know, if you read

the papers, cops only shoot honor

students. Sole support of the family

and all that.

TOWER (V.O.)

...Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for

landing -- wind south 20, altimeter

two-niner-niner-two...

KOSALAS

Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato

says they call him the Angel-of-Death.

EDDIE

Real sweetheart.

MOLLY LUNA (O.S.)

Now?

DIANA

No!

MOLLY (O.S.)

Now?

DIANA

Mama!

DIANA

Daddy, would you get that!

THERESA

Bella.

DIANA

Keep 'em closed now.

DIANA

O.K., open 'em.

DIANA

Happy birthday, momma.

THERESA

(in Italian)

Happy birthday, Molly.

TONY LUNA

Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok?

C'mon I'm in a hurry!

MOLLY

But Tony, why...?

TONY LUNA

Business! C'mon, move. Do what I

tell you!

DIANA

Don't do it, momma! Make him pack

his own bag.

TONY LUNA

I ain't got time to put up with your

bullshit today.

DIANA

Listen goddammit! It's momma's

birthday! She deserves better'n this!

GAMIANI

Hey, Tony. What's shaking? Sorry I'm

late. I got stuck on Wacker. Some

spook...

TONY LUNA

Victor Comacho is alive.

GAMIANI

Oh sweet Jesus.

DIANA

You can't go now.

TONY LUNA

Shut up!

TONY LUNA

Put someone on the house. And you

keep an eye on her.

GAMIANI

You got it, Tony. What about your

uncle?

TONY LUNA

What Felix don't know doesn't hurt

him.

TONY LUNA

Here. Happy birthday.

ODELL

Bow to your master!

EDDIE

Later, Odell. It's been a rough one.

ODELL

Y' tellin me! We all seen it on the

TV!

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Odell!

EDDIE

Bow to your master.

EDDIE

Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy.

PIRELLI

You look like shit.

EDDIE

Thanks, pal.

PIRELLI

They had a shot on the tube of you

guys comin' out in front of the

building. How's Donato?

EDDIE

Pissed cause he lost a shoe.

(pause)

Luis Comacho is in town.

PIRELLI

He'll collect himself some scalps

before this one's over. Your answering

machine is on the fritz again. Some

woman with a fantastic voice was

callin' about comin' over this weekend

ta help you with somthin', and then

the tape went nuts.

EDDIE

Want somthin' to drink?

PIRELLI

Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is

a bear Catholic?

ODELL

Me too.

EDDIE

I hate smart ass kids.

PIRELLI

Gonna get down in the 30's tonight.

Your pilot light is out.

EDDIE

I've been told that more than once.

PIRELLI

(seriously)

So, who you figure pulled out the

rug? Gypsies? Mob?

EDDIE

Somebody knew what they were doin'.

They blew the top off an anthill.

PIRELLI

I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't

that stupid.

(pause)

Hah! Sombody put the valve in

backwards.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Odell! I ain't calling you again!

ODELL

Later, fellas.

PIRELLI

There. Heat.

EDDIE

What was the Cubs final score?

PIRELLI

8 to 1.

PIRELLI

Machines just don't like you.

EDDIE

Maybe I don't like machines.

VOICE

(from speaker)

Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not

move! No se mueve!...

ENGINEER

...After the gyros are locked, any

movement of the hand controller is

duplicated by the 'Prowler.'

ENGINEER

This simple control system means

that even semi-skilled employees can

operate the unit with a minimum of

training. As they say, "Even a child

can operate it."

KATES

He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay

attention. You're all gonna have to

be qualified on this. It's the future.

EDDIE

Just what the world needs, another

gun without a brain.

KATES

You're looking at the perfect cop.

The damn thing follows orders.

EDDIE

I got better things to do than play

with toys.

ENGINEER

If the Commander will pick someone

to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can

show how our various target

acquisition systems function.

MACHINE

(from speaker)

Bang. You're dead.

EDDIE

Drop it.

SANCHEZ

(subtitle)

A war does no good for any of us. It

can only make what is bad worse.

LUIS

(subtitle)

Get them out of here. Fix them up. I

want them to be beautiful for their

mother.

LUIS

(subtitle)

I promise you, my brothers, there

will be blood for blood.

VICTOR

(subtitles)

This is the cop.

LUIS

How much did they pay you to set up

my brothers, Pig.

EDDIE

Stay off my streets, asshole. Or

I'll bite your head off, and shit in

your neck.

LUIS

(subtitle)

You're meat cop! Dead meat!

FLANNIGAN

Eenie Verona is the gentleman's name.

(looks down)

You did a hell of a job on him.

EDDIE

I was motivated.

FLANNIGAN

Know him?

EDDIE

He's a punk. Punk thief. Booster.

FLANNIGAN

Looks like he graduated.

EDDIE

He had a brother-in-law. They were

tight. Served time together.

Ganelli..., Gagleone...

KOSALAS

Gamiani.

FLANNIGAN

If I was you, I'd sit on him.

KOSALAS

You figure he's connected?

FLANNIGAN

Looks like you're gonna be busy,

Cusack. Uh, you gonna be using those

Cubs' tickets?

KOSALAS

This Ganiani's a swinger, huh?

EDDIE

He's just makin' up for the time he

spent in the joint.

KOSALAS

Now what? They selling protection to

the bears?

EDDIE

Relax kid.

KOSALAS (V.O.)

What's this? Kinda young for that

old fart ain't she?

EDDIE (V.O.)

Just watch, kid. Learn.

DIANA

Be back in a minute.

DIANA

What do you want?

LOU

Your Papa worries about you.

DIANA

Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.

EDDIE

Hold here a second.

EDDIE

Keep with Gamiani.

KOSALAS

Bang a few for me.

EDDIE

Wanna play ball?

DIANA

Are you pitching?

EDDIE

Some people say I've got a pretty

good inside curve.

DIANA

I don't know. You look strictly minor

league.

EDDIE

I'm Eddie.

DIANA

I make it Eddie-The-Cop.

EDDIE

You've had a lot of experience with

cops?

DIANA

All bad.

EDDIE

You'll get slivers.

DIANA

Hey, what the hell do you think you're

doing?

EDDIE

I thought you knew all about cops.

You don't put anything up your nose

do you?

EDDIE

Diana Luna?

(pause)

You're Tony Luna's daughter?

DIANA

I don't know where he is, and I don't

really give a shit.

(tired)

When are you people going to realize

I don't have anything to do with my

father.

EDDIE

For when you need a friend.

DIANA

I've got all the friends I want.

EDDIE

But do you have all the friends you

need?

EDDIE

(to phone)

This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a

team to cover a house on the southwest

side.

(pause)

L-U-N-A, Anthony.

(pause)

Yeah. Crazy Tony Luna. I don't think

he's around, but if he shows up bring

him in.

EDDIE

(nods)

Catch you later.

OFFICER

Police! Open up!

KOBAS (V.O.)

(from bullhorn)

Awright awright hold it.

KOBAS

For Christ's sake! You tryin to get

your partner killed, Jackson?

BRENNAN

(shouts across the

room)

Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me

get some signatures on this letter

for Cragie.

CRAGIE

Way to go, partner.

HOWARD

Let's try the mitts for awhile.

DONATO

Say, partner.

EDDIE

How ya doing, Richie?

DONATO

Swinging. How's this? Two G's, we

get a sausage and beef stand stand

outside Wrigley Field. You pass the

beef, I take the cash. Free games. I

got a contact downtown.

EDDIE

How you gonna watch the game if you're

hawking sandwiches?

DONATO

Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I

tell you about this nurse I met?

Talk about physical therapy.

DONATO

She's got this friend just dying to

meet you. Intensive care.

DONATO

(to Eddie)

Later, partner.

BRENNAN

Hey, Cusack. How about taking the

gloves off long enough to sign this

for Cragie.

EDDIE

This about the hearing?

BRENNAN

You bet.

EDDIE

I pass.

BRENNAN

(angry)

What the fuck's the matter with you?

EDDIE

He's burnt, Brennan, and you know

it. He was a good cop, but he ain't

now.

BRENNAN

Get off your high horse, Cusack. He

made a couple of mistakes, OK. The

guy was a hero. What the fuck does a

bunch of civilians know about comin'

up some shithouse stairway day after

day, scared outta your shorts.

EDDIE

We're all scared, Brennan. Cragie

should have been off the street a

long time ago. He's gonna hurt

somebody else with his bullshit.

Maybe even you.

MUSIC

(to mike)

The funeral director says they plan

on cruisin right past luna's house.

KOSALAS

(to radio)

They're wastin' the show. Tony's not

even in town.

EDDIE

He'll get the word.

LUNA

(to phone)

What the fuck are you talkin about?

Nobody's gonna touch nothin. Just

stay put.

(pause)

I give a shit about their fuckin

parade?

LUNA

(to phone)

They wanna throw flowers we can fix

it so they're pushing up daisys.

KOSALAS

I can back you up.

EDDIE

Stay by the radio.

ROCCO

What the hell you doin' here? Off,

asshole.

SCALESE

(referring to computer)

The modern age's answer to the crystal

ball. Marvelous. If you know how to

read it.

(pause)

Listen. If you have some extra cash,

buy oranges. The price is low, and I

can promise you the threatened

trucking strike will be avoided.

EDDIE

We talking about a bribe, Scalese?

SCALESE

It's a prediction.

SCALESE

No. I wouldn't try to bribe Eddie

Cusack.

SCALESE

You're incorruptible. Untarnished. I

hear they call you stainless steel

on the street. Me, I think you're a

fuckin' pain in the ass.

EDDIE

Thanks.

SCALESE

(frowning)

It's not a compliment.

EDDIE

I'm looking for your nephew.

SCALESE

Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna's none of

your business.

EDDIE

Wrong. Tony just made himself my

business.

SCALESE

No he didn't. We take care of our

own. Just like the cops. Just like

the Comachos. You understand.

EDDIE

He shit on my turf, old man. And I'm

going to nail him and anybody else

tied to him. You understand, Felix?

SCALESE

(with cool rage)

Nobody threatens Felix Scalese.

EDDIE

(softly)

It's not a threat. It's a prediction.

EDDIE

There's a shitstorm coming. You better

get yourself a good umbrella.

MUSIC

Tony Luna's bagman.

MUSIC

They call that a Columbian necktie.

MUSIC

They found the manager of Tony's

restaurant hanging from a hook in

his kitchen. Looked like someone

tried to carve a canoe out of him.

Tony's used car lot on Ashland is

burning as we speak. The head salesman

is a fried zuccini.

KOSALAS

Oh Jesus. It's starting.

EDDIE

Let's go.

KOSALAS

Music's at the scene.

EDDIE

(to mike)

Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish

hair.

MUSIC (V.O.)

(on radio)

Two male caucasians, two female. One

mid-to-late forties. The other a

grandmother.

POMPAS

Come on, Chika. We gonna have some

fun. You gonna take us to your father.

EDDIE

Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking

pain in the ass.

EDDIE

Let her go, pooch.

ANGEL

Another step, and I take her head

off.

EDDIE

You don't have the balls.

DIANA

Where are you taking me?

EDDIE

Downtown first. Then I'm gonna place

you in protective custody.

DIANA

The hell you are!

EDDIE

You'll be safe --

DIANA

I'll take my chances.

PIRELLI

(shouts)

Keep your goddamn pants on!

PIRELLI

This your idea of a social call?

EDDIE

Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana

Luna.

PIRELLI

C'mon, kid. Let's get you off your

feet.

EDDIE

Can you put her up till I find her

old man?

PIRELLI

Does a bear...?

EDDIE

Am I putting you on the spot?

PIRELLI

I spent 30 years on the spot. What

ever you need.

DIANA

Eddie?

EDDIE

I'll be right across the hall. I'm

just gonna clean up.

KOSALAS

(to phone)

Say, Eddie. Why don' you come by and

tip a few?

(pause)

Cause I gotta talk to you.

(pause)

Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk.

(pause)

Please.

(pause)

Yeah, at Mike's.

MUSIC

You oughta crash, man. You had a

helluva day.

FIRST HOOD

Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide.

Easy in, easy out.

SECOND HOOD

Just a quick and dirty?

FIRST HOOD

Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know

the drill.

DONATO

He picks her up on Forty-third, and

he's takin' in. She says, "Say, baby.

Ain't no need for goin' downtown."

An' she pulls back her skirt. So the

dumb shit climbs in the back an'

takes a piece...

(starts to chuckle)

...an' leaves the keys in the front

and locks the two of 'em in the squad.

And he hasta kick out the window

see, an' she starts screamin', "Rape!

Rape!" An' they charge him with rape

an' every other fuckin' thing in the

book. Internal Affairs is gonna give

him a kayak and a lantern an' put

him out in the lake.

SECOND HOOD

Bartender. Gimme a black russian and

a Courvoisier.

FIRST HOOD

(bellows)

Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers.

This is a ho --

SECOND HOOD

(to partner)

You stupid motherfucker.

SECOND HOOD

My old lady tol' me you was fucked

up in the head. Do I listen? Piece o

cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin

to it, you say.

COP

Shut up over there.

DONATO

Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental

Hygienist. She's oral.

DONATO

And this is... Marlene. She works

for a proctologist.

DONATO

Siddown, partner. I got a proposition

for you.

EDDIE

Not now, Donato.

DONATO

O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two

words in your brain. Alligator

farming.

KOSALAS

Beer?

KOSALAS

Looks like I'm caught between the

rock and the hard place, Sarge.

KOSALAS

You know I really wanted to be a

good cop, but... shit. It's hard

enough sometimes just to stay alive.

Comes so easy to you. You got all

the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still

tryin' to find the questions.

KOSALAS

Cragie planted the gun on the kid.

Just wasted him, and then I... I

don't know what to do about the

hearing tomorrow...

EDDIE

Tell the truth.

KOSALAS

See. It's all so nothin' for you. If

I talk straight every cop on the

force will shit on me. If I don't...

Cragie gets away with murder.

EDDIE

And the chance to do it again. Next

time he might take away a cop. That

make any difference?

KOSALAS

He's my partner.

EDDIE

Your partner's selling you out,

Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid,

and now he's risking your ass to

save his own.

KOSALAS

It was a mistake.

EDDIE

It cost an innocent kid his life.

KOSALAS

I know that! I KNOW THAT!

KOSALAS

(softly)

Jesus. I see that kid's face every

time I close my eyes.

EDDIE

Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back

you up.

CRAGIE

Nice to see you out with the boys

for a change, Sarge.

EDDIE

Hello, Cragie.

CRAGIE

They tell me my Sergeant wouldn't

sign for me. You want to tell me

why?

EDDIE

You know why.

CRAGIE

No. Tell me.

EDDIE

(gently)

You were a good cop for a lot of

years. You've passed your limit now

Cragie.

CRAGIE

Fuck you. Where do you get off?

EDDIE

Right about here.

PIRELLI

She's havin' a bad night. Gave her a

shot of brandy. Maybe she'll sleep.

EDDIE

Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli?

EDDIE

I'll be back right after the hearing

tomorrow, and you can get some sleep

then.

DIANA

What do you do when you don't have

anyone?

EDDIE

You find someone.

DIANA

Could you... Hold me for a while?

MALE PANEL MEMBER

How far were you standing from where

your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio?

CLERK

In the next doorway. Four meters.

DONATO

How you doin', Sarge?

EDDIE

What's the score?

DONATO

(nods toward witness)

Kid's grandmother says Cragie threw

down the pistola.

PARTIDA

(to steno)

Officer Cragie has already been sworn.

(pause)

Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs.

Murillio's testimony --

CRAGIE

Yes, sir.

PARTIDA

You have heard her tell this panel

that she saw you lay the gun in her

grandson's hand.

CRAGIE

I'm not saying the woman would make

this up. But there's no way she could

have seen anything from where she

was standing in a hallway that dark.

(pause)

Like you said, she's the boy's

grandmother.

PARTIDA

If it was dark, Officer, how were

you sure Vega had a gun?

CRAGIE

We were lucky. There was a glint of

light, a reflection comin off the

barrel of the weapon.

DONATO

You think he'll get a pass?

EDDIE

You heard it all. What do you think?

DONATO

If the hearing was over I'd have to

put my money on the old lady.

(smiles)

But Kosalas's next. My bet's on

Cragie.

EDDIE

The kid may surprise you.

PARTIDA

And right after you heard Officer

Cragie's gun discharge, what did you

do then?

KOSALAS

I immediately advanced down the hall.

PARTIDA

And what did you see?

KOSALAS

The deceased, Vega, lying on the

floor. Officer Cragie was checking

his vital signs.

PARTIDA

What happened then?

KOSALAS

We recovered a .25 calibre automatic

from the teenager's right hand.

PARTIDA

Did you see that weapon in Vega's

hand before Officer Cragie fired?

KOSALAS

Yes, sir.

PARTIDA

No more questions.

PARTIDA

I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack.

DIANA

You made that uniform look good.

PIRELLI

That good looking gorilla next to me

is Eddie's father. Better than good

cop. Killed in the line of duty.

'71.

(pause)

Another cop shot him. An accident.

EDDIE

I can't comment on that. It was over

before I got there.

PARTIDA

You are his superior officer, are

you not?

EDDIE

Cragie's in my unit, yes.

PARTIDA

Did you give the men their various

assignments?

EDDIE

I did.

PARTIDA

Did you request that officer Cragie

be on your TAC team?

EDDIE

No, I didn't.

PARTIDA

Sergeant... I have here a department

document dated 24 September, of last

year. It is a request by you, to

your superiors, to have Officer Cragie

transferred to another unit. Are you

familiar with this document?

EDDIE

Yes.

PARTIDA

Why did you request his transfer?

EDDIE

Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone

to look at the city's guts, Mr.

Partida.

PARTIDA

What happened to this request?

EDDIE

It was denied.

PARTIDA

This is a letter of support for

Officer Cragie.

(hands it to him)

Everyone in his unit signed it but

you.

(pause)

Why?

EDDIE

I don't agree with what it says.

PARTIDA

Are you saying you do not believe

Officer Cragie is fit to work the

streets of Chicago?

EDDIE

That's what I'm saying.

EDDIE

(to phone)

I just dialed 348-6610, and I get

this funny buzz. Check the line for

me? Thanks.

BRENNAN

Seems to me the man's got his tongue

stuck to his asshole, Cragie.

CRAGIE

Hey, that don't bother him. He's the

fuckin White Knight.

(to Eddie)

You wanna take on the whole world by

yourself? Now you're gonna get your

chance, Sarge.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

(from phone)

Sorry, sir, that number seems to be

out of service. I've reported it.

COP

He was a friend of yours wasn't he?

EDDIE

Yeah.

EDDIE

BRENNAN

HEAVY

Hey, you ain't got no business back

there.

EDDIE

I want your opinion I'll beat it out

of you.

EDDIE

Where is Luis?

DEGAS

Get the hell out of here.

EDDIE

Talk to me, Degas, or I'll hit you

with so many lefts you're gonna beg

for a right.

DEGAS

He's coming here. He's on his way.

DISPATCHER

LUIS

The sun comes up. You give me Luna,

DONATO

I would have been here, Sarge. They

kept it from me.

EDDIE

You're Ok, Hopalong.

DONATO

Listen, I'm havin' a drink with this

friend of mine, name of Mickie. She

works on a computer over in the

Federal Building, FBI. I got here as

soon as I heard.

EDDIE

They got Diana Luna.

DONATO

That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.

Mickie told me she read on the wire

Tony Luna's comin' into Union Station

at ten tonight.

TONY LUNA

(surprised)

Hello, Felix.

SCALESE

Hello, Tony.

SCALESE

(sighs)

You see, Tony. You make no sense.

You start a war... Waste people...

Money... You're like a kid, Tony.

You're a bad boy.

SCALESE

This sonovabitch is crazy!

EDDIE

You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for

him. Get me a time and place.

LUIS

Your cop friend is smart. Too smart

and he dies. Then I take care of you

personally.

KATES

What the hell is goin on?

BRENNAN

Cusack made off with a truckload of

armour.

MUSIC

(shakes his head)

He's a fucking one man army now.

CRAGIE

What'd I tell ya. The sonofabitch is

crazy.

KATES

OK, everybody. No more games. Where's

Cusack.

KOSALAS

I can't swallow this shit! Eddie

Cusack's out there takin' on the

world by himself. And you fuckin'

heros are gonna sit on your goddamn

asses!

CRAGIE

Cool it kid.

KOSALAS

Don't you fuckin' tell me to cool

it. I won't cool it. I'm not going

to fuckin' lie for you any more.

(to Kates)

I lied, Commander. He laid a gun on

that kid. I saw the whole thing.

CRAGIE

You little fuckin' bastard!

KOSALAS

What's this for partner? Your next

fuck up?

KATES

(to the others)

Get someone in the air. We're gonna

find Cusack.

LUIS

(subtitles)

Take off the gag. I want them to

hear her.

EDDIE

Here we go partner.

LUIS

(subtitles)

Now! Do it now! Kill her!

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

(from radio)

...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and

explosions in the vicinity of Calumet

Harbor...

KATES

That's Cusack.

KATES

Hey, Cusack!

KATES
