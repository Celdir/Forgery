MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Dr. Nick Topopolosis?

NICK

It's Tatopoulos.

TERRINGTON

The worm guy, right?

(extending his hand as he

approaches)

Kyle Terrington, U.S. State

Department.

NICK

What are they doing?

TERRINGTON

You've been reassigned.

You can't shut me down now! My

BRIEFING OFFICER

Nothing yet.

RAYMOND

Are there any other survivors?

Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.

RAYMOND

Get them out of there.

RAYMOND

(in French)

Ask him what happened.

BRIEFING OFFICER

(in English)

It's no use. He's been like this since

we fished him out of the ocean.

Whatever happened to that tanker put

him in a complete state of shock.

RAYMOND

What did you see, old man?

OLD COOK

MAJOR HICKS

Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

NICK

(correcting)

It's Tatopoulos.

MAJOR HICKS

Right. The worm guy.

(to guards at blockade)

Can someone get those people off the

beach?

NICK

Excuse me, would you mind telling me

what the hell I'm doing here?

MAJOR HICKS

Follow me.

NICK

You didn't answer my question. In

fact, for the last 18 hours no one has

answered any of my questions.

MAJOR HICKS

We have a situation on our hands that

requires your particular expertise.

NICK

Look, I may work for the Nuclear

Regulatory Commission but accidents

and spills are not my field.

MAJOR HICKS

We know.

NICK

Do you know that you just interrupted

a three year study of the Chernobyl

earthworm?

MAJOR HICKS

Yeah, you're the worm guy.

NICK

The radioactive contamination in that

area altered the earthworm's DNA! You

have any idea what that means?

MAJOR HICKS

No, but I have the feeling I'm about

to find out.

NICK

It means that due to a man made

accident the Chernobyl earthworms are

now over seventeen percent larger than

they were before. Mutated by seventeen

percent?

MAJOR HICKS

(bemused)

Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

NICK

They're enormous! A new species

created by man's recklessness. That's

what I've been trying to tell you, I'm

only a biologist. I take radioactive

samples and study them.

MAJOR HICKS

Then you're perfect.

(pointing to the ground)

Here's your radioactive sample. Study

it.

NICK

What sample?

MAJOR HICKS

You're standing on it.

NICK

I don't see it.

(no response)

Where is it?

NICK (CONT'D)

I don't see it!

18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18

NICK

(flabbergasted)

That was a footprint. I was standing

inside a footprint.

MAJOR HICKS

That's right.

NICK

But there's no animal in the world

that can make prints like that? Is

there?

MAJOR HICKS

We're hoping you're going to help us

figure that out.

NICK

Somebody must have seen it.

MAJOR HICKS

It happened so fast no one knew what

hit them 'til is was over.

PETERS

(on the run)

Tape's in. The French finally released

it.

MAJOR HICKS

A tanker was attacked and sunk

yesterday near the French Polynesians.

We think there's a connection.

WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)

Is that the tape of the witness?

NICK

Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

ELSIE

Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

ELSIE (CONT'D)

Dr. Craven, have you met the worm

guy?

DR. CRAVEN

Nice to meet you.

AUDREY (O.S.)

Murray wants these copied to each

field producer...

AUDREY

And I'm supposed to remind you to call

him on all of Caiman's expense

p.o.'s.

LUCY

Speak of the devil.

AUDREY

(nervous)

Think I should ask him? I'm going to

ask him. You think I should? I will.

LUCY

Oh girl...

AUDREY

Did you talk with Humphries?

CAIMAN

This is not the place...

AUDREY

Just tell me, did you talk with him?

CAIMAN

He said he'd consider it. It's between

you and Rodriguez.

AUDREY

Are you serious? He's going to

consider me for he job? What else did

he say?

CAIMAN

Why don't I tell you over dinner

tonight? Your place.

AUDREY

Mr. Caiman, you're married.

CAIMAN

And you're beautiful...

AUDREY

Mr. Caiman...

CAIMAN

Call me Charlie.

AUDREY

(stubbornly)

Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra

research for you after hours and

weekends for nearly a year. And I've

never asked for anything but this job

is really important to me. I'm too old

to be an assistant anymore. I need to

know this job is going someplace.

CAIMAN

So have dinner with me tonight.

AUDREY

I can't.

CAIMAN

It's your choice.

ELSIE

Three years digging up worms in

Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos

handle it?

NICK

Oh, I'm not married.

ELSIE

Really? A girlfriend then?

NICK

No. Perhaps I work too much.

ELSIE

(filtered)

You mean to tell me that there is no

one who holds a special place in your

heart?

NICK

Not for a long time, now.

ELSIE

Well, I think you're cute.

NICK

(awkward)

Oh, thank you.

(whispered to Clive)

Is she always like this?

CLIVE

(conspiratorially)

I had to beat her off with a stick.

MAJOR HICKS

Who are they? Lieutenant, get those

people away from there.

RAYMOND

(French accent)

They are with me!

MAJOR HICKS

And who are you?

RAYMOND

CHARGEURES, property and casualty

insurance. We are preparing a report.

MAJOR HICKS

You're fast.

RAYMOND

That is our job.

MAJOR HICKS

Well your people are getting in the

way of my job.

RAYMOND

Major, what do you think could have

done this?

MAJOR HICKS

Get your people out of there or I

will.

SOLDIER

Major, we just got a report of a

fishing trawler going down. Exact

position, forty seven degrees

latitude, 67 longitude.

MAJOR HICKS

What makes you think it's related?

SOLDIER

The trawler was pulled under.

MAJOR HICKS

Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred

miles off the American Eastern

seaboard and we don't even know what

it is.

ELSIE

Theropoda Allosaurus

. Some type of

enormous reptile the likes of which we

haven't seen since the age of

prehistoric dinosaurs.

CLIVE

(sarcastic)

So where's been hiding the last

sixty

million years

?

ELSIE

The depth and breath of the ocean

floor has barely been explored. His

kind could have survived there

completely undetected.

NICK (O.S.)

What about the traces of radiation?

NICK

The radiation is not an anomaly, it's

the

clue

. This creature is far too

unique on every level to be some lost

dinosaur.

MAJOR HICKS

Don't tell me why it's not, tell me

what the hell it is.

NICK

What do we know? It was first sighted

off the French Polynesian Pacific. An

area that has been exposed to dozens

of nuclear tests over the last thirty

years.

ELSIE

Hence the radiation.

NICK

More than that. I believe this is a

mutated aberration, a hybrid from the

fall out in that region.

CLIVE

(sarcastic)

Like your earthworms?

NICK

Yes! We're looking at a completely

incipient creature. The dawn of a new

species. The first of its kind.

Shut up. How can you eat like that?

ANIMAL

Big bites.

you're just a pair of breasts that

ANIMAL

I like that image.

AUDREY

You know how I spent last weekend?

Walking his damned dog.

No! I just couldn't see myself with

summer picking apart cockroaches. I

wanted to have some adventure, some

fun...

LUCY

And now you live the glamorous life of

Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,

ain't it?

ANIMAL

How long where you and dis guy goin'

AUDREY

Nearly four years...

LUCY

Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he

didn't ask you to marry him.

They've agreed to evacuate the city.

They've called out the National Guard

After the initial attack he

OFFICER

(interrupting)

Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on

the line.

NICK

I don't understand. How can something

that large just disappear?

SERGEANT

We're not sure. We're scanning the

area now.

ELSIE

He probably returned to the river.

Just like everywhere else we've been,

we're always one step behind.

NICK

I don't think so.

NICK

I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An

island, water on all sides. But like

no other island in the world, this is

a place where he can easily hide.

He's in there someplace.

We're been monitoring the waters

around the island. As far as we can

tell it hasn't left the area.

MAYOR

But you don't know for sure.

We think there's a strong reason to

believe it may be hiding inside one of

Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those

LT. ANDERSON

Only five, Sir. We've checked them

all. He hasn't used any of them.

Have them sealed off.

Fill them with cement, brick them up,

put land mines in them, bombs, I don't

I have this theory that we're

AUDREY

And you think this creature is one of

them?

NICK

Yes. The first of its kind. I found

this blood sample earlier this

AUDREY

Blood sample? How close did you get to

that thing?

NICK

I got pretty close.

AUDREY

What else do you know about it?

NICK

Well, we know he eats fish, he's of

reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's

amphibious and...

NICK

...he's

pregnant

.

AUDREY

Are you sure?

NICK

(thrilled)

Well, obviously these tests weren't

designed for this but fundamentally

they're looking for the same hormonal

patterns that would indicate

pregnancy.

AUDREY

I don't get it. If it's the first of

its kind, how can it be pregnant?

NICK

The ultimate expression of evolution,

it reproduces asexually. Think about

it, all kinds of creatures have been

known to travel great distances for

reproduction. That's why he came to

New York. Like every species of

insufficient progenitors, he's

nesting!

AUDREY

Nesting?

NICK

Yes. Do you realize that a creature

like this could lay as many as a dozen

eggs at a time!

Forgive me but I've got to get this

into the lab, to confirm all this.

You see, all we need to do is get a

better shot at it with weapons that

don't rely on heat seeking...

Um, excuse me, sir, but the

situation's more complicated than

that. The blood I recovered revealed

that the creature is either about to

lay eggs or already has.

Are you trying to tell us there's

another

one of those things out

there?

NICK

I don't believe so.

MAYOR

Then how can it be pregnant? What is

this, the "virgin lizard?"

No, it reproduces asexually. That's

why we must find the nest. If we

don't, dozens will be born, each one

capable of laying eggs of its own.

Very quickly we could be looking at an

enormous population.

MAJOR HICKS

So after we kill the creature we'll

begin a search for the nest.

It may be too late by then. These eggs

will hatch very quickly.

It's all my fault. What have I done,

You made a mistake.

AUDREY

Yeah, I just screwed up with the only

man who ever really cared about me.

ANIMAL

Didn't you tell me he left for the

airport?

AUDREY

Yeah. Why are you asking?

ANIMAL

I just saw him. He's with a bunch of

guys who want to sneak into the city

tonight.

My God. He's going after the nest.

Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
