INT. COURTROOM.

PROSECUTOR

The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls

himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly

committed criminal acts of a malicious

nature. This defendant possesses a

superior intelligence, which he uses to a

destructive and antisocial end. His

computer virus crashed one thousand five

hundred and seven computer systems,

including Wall Street trading systems,

single handedly causing a seven point drop

in the New York Stock Market.

JUDGE

Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family

forty-five thousand dollars...

JUDGE

...and sentence you to probation, under

which you are forbidden to own or operate

a computer or touch tone telephone, until

the day of your eighteenth birthday.

SEVEN YEARS LATER.

birthday.

DADE

Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from

Accounting. I just had a power surge here at

home that wiped out a file I was working on.

Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know

anything about computers?

NORM

Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...

DADE

Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just

went AWOL, and I've got this big project due

tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get

it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari

Kari...

NORM

Uhhh.. ahahaha...

DADE

Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management

techniques.

(pause)

Could you, uh, read me the number on the

modem?

NORM

Uhhhmm...

Mm-hmm.

MRS. MURPHY

Up all night again, huh?

DADE

Can this wait until both my eyes are open,

please?

MRS. MURPHY

Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll

sleep normal hours? He's been playing with

his computer all night for a solid week.

(pause)

Well yes, he could be playing with himself.

Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,

don't you?

DADE

Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as

charming as you yet.

MRS. MURPHY

You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,

Dade?

(louder)

Right, Dade?!

DADE

Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

MRS. MURPHY

(angry, through the bathroom door)

You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?

Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up

again and you won't get into college!

MRS. MURPHY

I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.

You know, you're right about that.

Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,

Yeah.

Why don't you come up here?

CURTIS

He's good!

DADE

TEACHER

"Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient

heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in

Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

DADE

No. No one special.

MRS. MURPHY

Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be

home late.  And would you try and please fill

these out?

MRS. MURPHY

Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your

FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do

like absolutely nothing and...

CEREAL

...and your name goes through like seventeen

computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's

a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living

large. We have no names, man, no names. We

are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.

PHREAK

Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But

he does know things.

JOEY

Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.

I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking

around...

PHREAK

(to Cereal)

D'you bring those Crayola books?

CEREAL

Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.

Cereal brings a book out of his bag.

CEREAL

Green one.

JOEY

What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What

are these?

DADE

International Unix Environments.

CEREAL

Luscious orange?

DADE

Computer security criteria, DOD standards.

DADE

The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So

called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy

wears on the cover.

CEREAL

What's that?

DADE

Devil book. The Unix Bible.

CEREAL

What's that?

DADE

Dragon book. Compiler design.

CEREAL

Oh yeah? What's that?

DADE

The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks.

Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that

won't fit on a shelf.

JOEY

Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm

in this computer, right. So I'm looking

around, looking around, you know, throwing

commands at it, I don't know where it is or

what it does or anything. It's like, it's

like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like

four hours I'm just messing around in there.

Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.

Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this

morning, I look in the paper, some cash

machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out

seven hundred dollars into the middle of the

street.

CEREAL

That's kinda cool.

JOEY

That was me. That was me. I did that.

DADE

You did this from your house.

PHREAK

What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't

hack a bank across state lines from your

house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where

are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know

anything?

CEREAL

Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.

JOEY

You guys always think I should know

everything, and you never tell me anything.

Am I right?

PHREAK

Alright, what are the three most commonly used

passwords?

JOEY

Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that

order, necessarily, right?

CEREAL

Yeah but don't forget God. System operators

love to use God. It's that whole male ego

thing.

PHREAK

Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a

righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

CEREAL

Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,

you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,

supercomputers they use to like, do physics,

and look for oil and stuff?

PHREAK

Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The

big iron?

DADE

Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy

metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some

low security, and try the back door.

CEREAL

Yeah but oh man,

(starts rubbing one of his

own nipples in mock sexual

excitement)

wouldn't you just love to get one of those

Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

PHREAK

Yo, who ate all of my fries?

CEREAL

(pretending to be enraged)

Joey?!

JOEY

What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your

fries. I did not touch your fries.

PHREAK

Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.

CEREAL

It was him, man!

PHREAK

You're psyched. You need to lay off of that

shit.

As you can see, this is just a simple

microcassette recorder)  Hook it up to the

RAZOR

Record the tones that the coins make. And

hang up and get your money back!

And never again have to pay for a service that

would be dirt cheap...

MARGO

Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I

see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.

PLAGUE

(to Margo)

Once again, don't call me Eugene.

(to the board)

A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a

superuser acount, giving him access to our

whole system.

MARGO

Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

PLAGUE

Someone didn't bother reading my carefully

prepared memo on commonly used passwords.

Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for

most used passwords are love,

(gesturing lewdly)

sex, secret and...

(eyeing Margo)

...God. So would your holiness care to change

her password?

PLAGUE

A hacker planted the virus.

MARGO

Virus?

PLAGUE

Yesterday, the ballast program for a

supertanker training model mistakenly thought

the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

MARGO

Excuse me?

PLAGUE

(as if to a child)

The little boat flipped over. A virus planted

in the Gibson computer system claimed

responsibility.

MARGO

What, it left a note?

VIRUS

Unless five million dollars are transferred to

the following numbered account in seven days,

I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson

fleet.

BOARD MEMBER

Is that...

PLAGUE

(interrupting)

That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The

problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and

we don't know which ones are infected.

DUKE ELLINGSON

Well then, put the ships' ballasts under

manual control.

PLAGUE

There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These

ships are totally computerized. They rely on

satellite navigation, which links them to our

network, and the virus, wherever they are in

the world.

MARGO

So what are we supposed to do?

PLAGUE

Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented

security officer. I traced the hacker's call.

The secret service picked him up this morning.

I'll just search his files for the original

virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL ATRIUM.

SUIT #1

Now look, now we expect you to get onto this

right away, yeah?

PLAGUE

Yeah!

SUIT #1

Well, how soon?

PLAGUE

Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.

This is a very common occurrence in

corporations as large as ours. You have

nothing to worry about.

SUIT #2

Yeah, right.

SUIT #1

Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?

PLAGUE

Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100

percent. Okay?

SUIT #2

Yeah.

SUIT #1

Okay.

PLAGUE

We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.

MARGO

What the hell was that all about?

PLAGUE

I had to move fast. The hacker copied my

garbage file.

MARGO

What?

PLAGUE

I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in

the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the

hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we

can't do on our own.

MARGO

I don't want to go to jail for this.

PLAGUE

Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.

MARGO

But you've created a virus that's going to

cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to

arrest some hacker kid?

PLAGUE

Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

MARGO

Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

PLAGUE

Sh, sh sh sh sh.

PLAGUE

I'll take care of this.

SECRETARY

Alright, sir.

PLAGUE

I can cancel it any time. I don't need any

program code. But it's the perfect cover, to

confiscate the disc and find out how much of

that garbage file has been copied.

MARGO

Get it!

(walking away)

Why did I ever trust you?

(going back up the escalator)

Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your

toys.

INT. SECRET SERVICE INTERROGATION ROOM.

GILL

Did you find the program for the virus on any

of the discs we confiscated?

PLAGUE

No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

GILL

Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an

accomplice. We'll release him until his

indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see

if he leads us to your disc.

Listen to this bullshit.

"This is our world now. The world of the

electron and the switch, the beauty of the

color, or religious bias. You wage wars,

murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us

believe it's for our own good, yet we're the

that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is

my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You

may stop me, but you can't stop us all."

Yeah, cool.

What is it with this guy?

PHREAK

His parents missed Woodstock and he's been

making up for it since. Hey, you hear about

Joey's bust?

CEREAL

Yeah. Probably had something to do with that

bank in Idaho.

PHREAK

Do you think he could hack a Gibson?

DADE

Did you talk to him?

PHREAK

Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next

three lifetimes.

(imitating her)

He isn't to consort with his computer friends.

(himself again)

PLAGUE

The year was 1988.  And this nasty virus

crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.

DADE

Fifteen hundred and seven.

AGENT RAY

(astounded)

Wow, huh!

GILL

It got you seven years probation. No

computer, couldn't even use a touch tone

phone.

PLAGUE

Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?

(getting to the point)

A virus has been planted in the Ellingson

Mineral computer system. You were our prime

suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found

no trace of it.

GILL

However, we have come to believe that one Joey

Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus.

He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that

Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We

want you to help us find it.

PLAGUE

I can't believe you were only eleven when you

on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us,

there's no such thing as family and friends.

We're each our own country, with temporary

allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty

with you.

DADE

I'm sorry. Who are you?

PLAGUE

I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we

be allies?

DADE

Nah. I don't play well with others.

DADE

Shit! Come on!

PLAGUE

Watch which friends you do play with. A

record like yours could land you in jail, get

you kicked out of school, no colleges would

take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and

everything you love.

like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and

they keep asking about you guys.

have something to give our lawyers, something

What's this one eat?

DADE

It nibbles. You see this?

DADE

This is every financial transaction Ellingson

conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to

the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

KATE

The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

DADE

And no one's caught it because the money isn't

really gone. It's just data being shifted

around.

KATE

Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out

with the money and erases its tracks.

DADE

Joey got cut off before he got to that part.

Check it out. By this point, it's already

running at, what, twice the speed as when it

started.

KATE

Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

NIKON

Two days.

DADE

And judging by this segment alone, it's

already eaten about...

CEREAL

21.8 million bucks, man.

KATE

Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the

fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and

that's us. We've got to get the rest of the

file, so we can find out where the money is

going before the worm disappears, so we can

find out WHO created it.

DADE

I know, I know who wrote it.

What?

copy of the disc you gave me.

Oh, shit! He got me.

NIKON

Joey's getting stupid busy.

DADE

Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go

after the worm. You're the closest.

DADE

It's root slash period workspace slash

period garbage period.

GILL

Freeze!

GILL

(pissed off but determined)

Ahhh Come on!

KATE

(to Razor and Blade)

Kill the Gibson.

RAZOR

Roger that.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

PLAGUE

Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you

got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you

can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha.

Are you nuts? Come at me!

HAL

They're in the kernal.

DA VINCI VIRUS

Help... me...

WOMAN

(off screen)

The tankers have stopped capsizing.

SOMEONE ELSE

(off screen)

Ballast tanks are emptying. It'll be okay.

ARF ARF!

WE GOTCHA!

MESS WITH THE BEST

DIE LIKE THE REST

PLAGUE

Little pissant!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.

NIKON

Yes!

DADE

We did it!

KATE

Let's get out of here!

GILL

FREEZE!

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

DADE

They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're

TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING!

TRASHING! TRASHING! HACK THE PLANET! HACK

THE PLANET!

GILL

Shut up and get in the car!

CEREAL

(understanding the hidden message)

HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

PLAGUE

Hello?

GILL

We caught 'em.

PLAGUE

Good.

GILL

Red handed! You won't be having any more

trouble from them.

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.

DADE

Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about

computers. She... she's just my girlfriend.

GILL

(laughing)

I suggest you modify your attitude. Because

you are floating. And I'm about to flush your

ass.

AGENT

You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.

KATE

Are you crazy? What are you doing?

DADE

I'm trying to help you.

KATE

Dade.

DADE

What?

KATE

Thanks for your help.

GILL

(grimly)

Your son is in big trouble. He has violated

his probation and he has engaged in criminal

activity.

MRS. MURPHY

My son happens to be a genius. He understands

something happening today that you won't

comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he

would never use what he knows to harm a living

soul.

AGENT BOB

The news crew you requested is here.

MRS. MURPHY

Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell

them.

GILL

Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an

ongoing investigation. You face possible

arrest if you do that.

MRS. MURPHY

Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.

GILL

Mrs. Murphy stays right here.

KATE

Oh, wow, she's great.

DADE

Yeah.

INT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICES.

REPORTER

...and attacked the Ellingson's computer

network. Is the last we've seen of this type

of high-tech espionage?

GILL

Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave

threat to the national security. This

incident just proves without a doubt that we

need increased funding to stop...

SOMEONE

That kid cut him off!

CEREAL

Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal

Killer, making my first coast to coast, world

wide, global television appearance. Yes,

that's right, I'm here to tell you about this

heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson

Mineral.

CEREAL

But for what, you ask? World domination?

Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called

Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause

Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be

blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was

really the smokescreen, right. What could be

so vitally important to protect that someone

would create such a nasty, antisocial, very

uncool virus program?

CEREAL

But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for

this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25

million bucks. The password for this hungry

little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head

of public relations at Ellingson Mineral...

INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

MARGO

Oh my God!

CEREAL

(continuing)

...and Eugene Belford, Computer Security

Officer.

INT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICE

GILL

(finally understanding what's been

going on all along)

Son of a BITCH!

CEREAL

(continuing)

What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the

Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I

think so!

CEREAL

Yo. I kinda feel like God!

MARGO

Plague?

Eugene?

INT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICES.

INT. POLICE STATION, WOMEN'S LOCKUP.

MARGO

I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone

a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make

a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his

mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need

a lawyer!

INT. AIRLINER CABIN.  IN FLIGHT.

STEWARDESS

Here you are, Mr. Babbage.  Flight time to

Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I

get you anything else?

PLAGUE

Just a pillow please.

PLAGUE

Thank you.

GILL

You're welcome.

PLAGUE

What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess!

I'll never fly this airline again!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SIDEWALK. NIGHT.

DADE

You look good in a dress.

KATE

You would have looked better.

DADE

Wanna go for a swim?

EXT. ROOFTOP SWIMMING POOL.

KATE

I can't believe they decided you won.

DADE

They didn't. The guys felt it was the only

way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty

good. You're elite.

KATE

Yeah? You know if you would have said so in

the beginning, you would have saved yourself

a whole lot of trouble.
