1.

WINCHESTER REP (V.O.)

the leader in all forms of armament used by the

United States Army. When you need a friend,

Winchester is by your side.         .

WINCHESTER REP

Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester

Corporation is proud to bring to you... a true

American hero. A patriot who has proven his

gallantry time and again on the field of battle.

WINCHESTER REP

I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of

the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ...

Captain Nathan Algren!

2.

ALGREN

My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents.

ALGREN

... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a

spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill,

nothing but grey as far as the eye could see:

Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down

into the, um, mael... mael...

(squints to see better)

-maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.

ALGREN

I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the

enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...

(loses his place, under his breath)

Shit...

(finds it again)

...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready

gone to Merciful Heaven...

DAVEY

They're coming, Nate.

ALGREN

Keep your head down.

DAVEY

(smiling)

Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy.

ALGREN

What'd he know?

(looks fondly at his brother)

You watch me now. Do whatever I say. .

3.

DAVEY

Aye-a ye, lieutenant.

GANT

How're the horses?

ALGREN

Better than you. Smell better, too.

(looks at him)

Can you hold on, Zeb?

GANT

(fighting the pain)

I got I choice?

BAGLEY

(panicking)

We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag!

ALGREN

What are you talking about?!

BAGLEY

Surrender, damn it! That's an order!

ALGREN

No thought of surrender among those boy.

Better to die as God made us, we thought, as

soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler,

sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare

arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had

fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny

ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister

.

Bugler, charge!

4.

ALGREN

And straight into them we went...

ALGREN

"Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we

had spirit in us yet--

ALGREN

Before they knew what hit them, we had broken

through into the rear of the rebel army.

DAVEY

We did it, bro', WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!

5.

ALGREN

Davey---!!!!

ALGREN

AHHHHHHH--!!!!!

ALGREN

And the 23rd rode on to glory.

ALGREN

Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one

thing on earth I could have had with me on that

glorious day, it would have been this beauty...

ALGREN

The Winchester Model '73 lever-action rifle.

15 shot capacity, one round-per-second,

accurate at 400 yards. You'll note the

patented loading port just beneath the

cartridge chamber and the smooth

cocking action. ...Lets' just see here--

6.

ALGREN

Smooth trigger action, too.

ALGREN

This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning The

West... Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is

here to answer any question and take orders. I thank

you.

WINCHESTER REP

What the hell was that?

ALGREN

Got their attention, didn't I?

WINCHESTER REP

Boston in three weeks. And sober this time.

ALGREN (V.O.)

June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me tonight.

They return each time I am obliged to tell their

story.

ALGREN (V.O.)

I can almost see them in the shadows, their

bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes

it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation --

7.

ALGREN (V.O.)

"We are dead," they whisper, "and we are happy."

ALGREN (V.O.)

"Do not be afraid," they whisper. "You have been

dead, too."

ALGREN (V.O.)

Is this why they gave their lives? So that I might

disgrace their memory?

ALGREN (V.O.)

And why, after taking so many lives, do I find

myself incapable of taking just one more?

ALGREN

Go awa y.

GANT (V .O.)

Not exactly the greeting I imagined.

8.

GANT

Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect.

ALGREN

Zeb...

ALGREN

Sit. Please.

GANT

... Saw your little melodrama         toda y.

Very inspiring... .

ALGREN

Given up soldiering to become a critic?

GANT

Got a job for you, unless you're running for

office...

ALGREN

I have I job.

GANT

I mean a real job. Back in uniform.

ALGREN

I' m retired.

GANT

I don't mean a U.S. uniform.

9.

BAGLEY

Nathan, good to see you.

ALGREN

(stunned)

Colonel Bagley...

BAGLEY

Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and

his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't

have names...

BAGLEY

They're looking to hire real American soldiers to

create the first Japanese Imperial Army.

BAGLEY

Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized

country and they're willing to spend what it takes

to hire white experts to do the job right.

BAGLEY

Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You

would be m y second-in-command.

ALGREN.

With approval from Washington, of course.

BAGLEY

Both governments prefer to consider our mission

unofficial. We'd be there as non-combatants

BAGLEY

(MORE)

only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help

them with training, ordinance and the like.

GANT

You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless

you intend to take up a career in the theater.

ALGREN

I have an agreement with the Winchester

Corporation -- I'm sure these people have some

concept of what an agreement is.

10.

OMURA

You are paid seven dollars for each performance.

You do, on average, fourteen performances a

year. We will pay you 400 dollars.

ALGREN

A year?

OMURA

A month.

ALGREN (V.O.)

June 23, 1876. It is impossible, standing here,

not to appreciate one's, own insignificance.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Here there is neither past, nor future. Only an

oblivion of water.

ALGREN (V.O.)

And yet I ask myself, will the dead follow me

across the ocean to this strange new land?

OMURA

...After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos

you would call them warlords --knew that Japan

needed a centralized government. So they asked

11.

OMURA (CONT'D)

the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the

Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.

ALGREN

And these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of

years of power?

OMURA

Economic incentives were offered. Most

provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of

modernization.

ALGREN

What about those that didn't?

OMURA

To deal with those who have resisted, the

Emperor has decided to create an Army with

allegiance only to him... We considered hiring

advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador

reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious

elements in your Civil War.

ALGREN

Who are we supposed to be fighting against?

OMURA

His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is samurai.

ALGREN

Samurai?

OMURA

The word you might use it "warrior". But that

does not quite capture it ... Katsumoto once served

the Emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a

band of traitors. He must be punished.

ALGREN

You told them about our experiences together

on Sutter's Hill, did you, Colonel?

BAGLEY

They know I was your commanding officer.

Yes.

12.

ALGREN

Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air.

(to Omura)

I'm sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with

more stories of patriotic gore.

OMURA

He is insolent.

BAGLEY

Get him in front of the troops, you'll see. Top

of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician.

Even wrote a book.

OMURA

Why did he leave your army?

BAGLEY

What's a hero to do when there's no more great

battles?

OMURA

Is that an evasive answer?

BAGLEY

Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter's Hill.

Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating,

but before they could bury him, he came back to

life. After the war he fought the Sioux, the Cree,

and the Blackfoot.

(leans closer)      .

Point him at the enemy. He was born for it.

13.

BAGLEY

I hope you realize the kind of second chance

this is for you. I won't tolerate insubordination.

ALGREN

Court-martial me.

BAGLEY

Would you rather I hadn't recommended you

for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?

ALGREN

We both know why you helped me, Colonel.

Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.

BAGLEY

I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity

for your own time.

GANT

Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail

he wouldn't have created infantry.

ALGREN

How many rimes you puke today?

GANT

I'm down to two.

OMURA

I understand you are a scholar, Captain Algren.

(to Gant)

Have you read his book., Mr. Gant?

GANT

Can't say I have.

OMURA

An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology

over antiquated military tactics.

14.

ALGREN

(wr y)

A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.

OMURA

Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading

military history. I spent two years studying

English at Princeton University.

ALGREN

And where did you learn to speak Japanese?

OMURA

Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven

words for "war." I will be impressed if you learn

only half of them. .

ALGREN

I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux,

Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language

when it comes to war.

OMURA

Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He

will be your translator.

15.

GRAHAM

Pleasure, Captain.

BAGLEY

You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now.

OMURA

The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure.

GRAHAM

If you please, Captain...

ALGREN

They're gonna carry us?

GRAHAM

You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk.

ALGREN

Why the hoods?

GRAHAM

So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking

at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now.

(coughs, wipes a bit of blood)

This wa y, gentlemen...

GRAHAM

Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little

port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and

changed all that.

ALGREN

All this in twenty years?

GRAHAM

Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired

lawyers from France, doctors from Germany,

naval architects from Britain, civil engineers,

railway designers, scientists, teachers. And, of

course, warriors from the United States.

16.

ALGREN

Buying the future.

GRAHAM

Or selling the past...

ALGREN

No chairs? . .

GRAHAM

Correct. And this--

(points to a mat)

..is your bed.

ALGREN

And this?

GRAHAM

Your pillow.

ALGREN

You mean to say there are no real beds in Japan?

GRAHAM

For its entire history Japan his been completely

aakoku, I "closed country." Thirty years ago, if

you had washed up on Japanese soil... you would

have been beheaded on sight. Now, they let you

keep your head... and give you a wooden pillow.

17.

GRAHAM

I remember when it was just America and the

Dutch. Now ever ybody' s getting into the game.

GRAHAM

The Germans are particularly eager.

ALGREN

What do they want?

GRAHAM

Same thing your country wants. Most favored

nation status.

ALGREN

How long have you been in Japan?

GRAHAM

Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here

... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857.

But I was soon relieved of m y position, as a result

of various...disagreements with the

Crown's attitude toward the locals.

OMURA

Gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying a taste of

home.

ALGREN

I've done with worse, believe me.

OMURA

America has much to offer us, though. Its'

industry and ingenuity are without peer.

(ingratiating)

I have spoken to the Emperor about you. He is

interested in the most modem theories of warfare.

ALGREN

I look forward to the opportunity of meeting

him someday.

OMURA

You will have that chance sooner than you think.

He has requested an audience.

18.

GRAHAM

Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in

human form. During the last two hundred years

no emperor was even seen by commoner. You

may look at him, with deference, but do not speak

unless you are spoken to.

OMURA

The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you

to know that he is most grateful for the assistance

your country offers ours, in order to rid ourselves

of the brutality of the provincial warlords - and

to accomplish the same national harmony which

you enjoy in your homeland.

OMURA

The Emperor is most interested in your American

Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen

them firsthand.

19.

ALGREN

I have seen many of them, and have fought them,

too. They are very brave.

EMPEROR

(accented English)

Thank... you... very ...much.

BAGLEY

That young pup runs this country?

GRAHAM

That "pup" runs the country no more than I do.

He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve

when the warlords realized Japan needed a central

government. But don't be fooled -- he may be a

powerless god, but to these people he's a god

nonetheless.

GRAHAM

Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka.

He will assist you in training the army.

ALGREN

General.

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

He greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if

you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.

GANT

Jesus....

20.

ALGREN

Ask the General what training they' ve had.

YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM

He sa ys... We have trained them not to shoot

their ...asses off.

ALGREN

Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention.

GANT

Imperial Army, Atten-tion!

ALGREN

For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in

charge here ... Mr. Gant.

GANT

(roars)

ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE

BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I

WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU

COCKSUCKERS!!

ALGREN (V.O.)

August 4,1876. As I watch this new army train,

I cannot help but think of those who rode with

me in me 23rd cavalry.

ALGREN (V.O.)

For four years they had survived, never once

shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my

order to charge the advancing rebel infantry,

they never hesitated. ...And they all died.

21.

ALGREN (V .O.)

Now I am training another army. In another

civil war.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead

men to their death?

YOSHlTAKA/ GRAHAM

... the problem is they're peasants. They have

never had this sort of responsibility or power.

ALGREN

(to Graham)

Ask him if they have a flag.

GRAHAM

No flag.

ALGREN

They need a flag.

GRAHAM

... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture

it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle.

22.

ALGREN

Mr. Graham...

GRAHAM

Ah... now this should be interesting... He's

waiting for them to show deference.

GANT

What the hell was that?

GRAHAM

That...is a samurai.

GRAHAM

... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate

himself in the presence of a samurai.

ALGREN

What edicts are those?

GRAHAM

The Council of State has been passing a series

of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.

GANT

Why?

23.

GRAHAM

Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the

last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her

wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.

GRAHAM

Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite

caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of

State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the

whole class had to go ...

(munching eel)

... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws.

But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto.

GRAHAM

General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that

the word samurai means "one who serves." Their

whole existence is based on serving their

country as warriors.

GRAHAM .

Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their only

reason for being ... So what are they to do now?

.

ALGREN

This is sake?

GRAHAM

Sake. Rice wine.

YOSHITAKA

Hie! Sake.

ALGREN

Sake..

(to Yoshitaka)

Good.

YOSHITAKA

Good!

24.

GRAHAM

Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,

honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to

write a book about them for years, but no

Westerner can get close enough.

ALGREN

Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.

GRAHAM

He is samurai.

GANT

My friend and I were looking for some

companionship...

GANT

Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie?

Boom-Boom?

ALGREN

( embarrassed)

Zeb.

(tries a bow to the madam)

...so sorry.

GANT

Universal language. boyo.

25.

GANT

That one's yours.

ALGREN

No tea... Sake.

GANT

Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.

GANT

Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:

ALGREN

Zeb. I don't think she --

GANT

She's just shy. Who knows what we white devils

have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?

GANT

Come on, now.

26.

ALGREN

Oh, shit.

GANT

Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good money.

GANT

Back off, short-stuff.

ALGREN

Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people

much larger than you, so we'll be leaving now...

YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM

The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant

evening?

ALGREN

It was... educational

(Yoshitaka nods)

Would the General mind telling me more about

our common enemy?

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader.

To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His

force is estimated at about five hundred and growing

by the day. All samurai.

ALGREN

What kind of man is be?

27.

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is

kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my

honored kinsman.

ALGREN

Kinsman?

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched

together and fought together. He is Kaishaku

the brother of my spirit.

ALGREN

Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.

GRAHAM

The samurai don't use guns.

ALGREN

No, ask him what kind of firearms they have.

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by

touching firearms.

GRAHAM

Colonel Bagley requires you.

ALGREN

They're not a fighting unit yet

BAGLEY

We have no choice.

(refers to the map)

--the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it

entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province.

28.

OMURA

Captain, we     cannot govern a country in which

we cannot tr    avel freel y. ... Katsumoto's

provocation     is strategic. His defeat will

demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that

resistance is   an act devoid of honor.

BAGLEY

The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're

savages with bows and arrows. You get up there

and show 'em how it', done.

ALGREN

With respect, sir, I need more time.

OMURA

With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.

He bows and leaves them alone. Bagley spins on A1gren.

BAGLEY

You think we're the only country interested in

Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the

French would like to oversee the new army?

ALGREN

Colonel--

BAGLEY

(brutally)

Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because

Remington and Colt and Winchester have

powerful allies in Washington. We're here to

sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and

timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester

whore like you to understand.

ALGREN

Yes, air.

29.

ALGREN

What is that sign?

GRAHAM

It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.

ALGREN

Zaibatsu?

GRAHAM

Old family businesses that own ever ything worth

owning. The molt powerful is the Omura

Zaibatsu. That's your friend, Omura.

ALGREN

They own all of this?

GRAHAM

They do now.

ALGREN (V.O.)

October 24,1876. Today we entered Kansai

province. Here the local warlords have all been

convinced to accept the emperor's rule.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Our destination is Yoshino, home of the rebel

Katsumoto. Protected by high mountain passes,

it can be reached only during the summer

months, and even then with great difficulty.

ALGREN (V.O.)

A long march. And then a battle. A new enemy,

but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one,

in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die

here, today, and will I be among them?

30.

ALGREN

(to Graham)

Ask him how they'll come at us.

YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM

They'll come straight on. They will push forward

and keep on attacking... And he adds that there

is no samurai word for "retreat."

YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM

He sa ys they're coming...

BAGLEY

Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard to

protect our supply train?

ALGREN

Yes.

BAGLEY

Who is overseeing their deployment?

ALGREN

No one.

BAGLEY

Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the rear.

I want to be certain we are protected from any

surprise assault.

GRAHAM

Yes. Of course.

31.

GANT

Son of a bitch.

ALGREN

(almost to himself)

...I'm going to kill him.

GANT

Waste of good ammo.

ALGREN

Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume

staggered firing positions.

GANT

Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.

32.

GANT

(quickly)

Hold the line ... hold the line...

ALGREN

FIRE!

ALGREN

Hold the line!

ALGREN

Sound fall back! Sound fall back!

33.

34.

.

35.

36.

KATSUMOTO

You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains

and winter is coming.

37.

ALGREN

Sake.

38.

YORITOMO

Sake?

ALGREN

Sake.

ALGREN

Sake.

39.

ALGREN

SAKE!

UJIO

(subtitles)

My lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is

shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

The barbarian doesn't know hit shame.

UJIO

(subtitles)

Then I will kill him.

KATSUMOTO

(pats him; subtitles)

Ujio-San, he will still be shamed tomorrow or in

a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.

40.

ALGREN

Sake!

ALGREN

(mumbling to himself)

Sake...

41.

KATSUMOTO

They are training.

ALGREN

Training what?

KATSUMOTO

Their minds. It is called bushido...

42.

KATSUMOTO

The wa y of the warrior. We study from when

we are young. Are my words correct?

KATSUMOTO

I will practice my Eng1ish with you.

ALGREN

Why do you learn English?

KATSUMOTO

To know m y enemy.

ALGREN

If I am your enemy, why have you not killed

me?

ALGREN

Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?

KATSUMOTO

No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.

ALGREN

That why you helped him kill himself?

KATSUMOTO

If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take

his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture.

It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend,

help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku.

ALGREN

Hell of an honor.

KATSUMOTO

It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace.

ALGREN

Who was the warrior in the red armor?

KATSUMOTO

My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.

ALGREN

And the woman who cares for me?

43.

KATSUMOTO

My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka.

Algren is incredulous.

ALGREN

I killed her husband?

KATSUMOTO

It was an honorable death.

ALGREN

(smiling politely)

You hope I choke on it, don't you?

ALGREN

You want to poison it and watch me fall over

the table and foam at the mouth.

YORITOMO

(to Taka, subtitles)

I promise I'll make him take a bath.

TAKA

(subtitles)

Soon. Please.

44.

45.

Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling

ALGREN

Who are you people anywa y?

ALGREN

You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't

even have any fucking walls. Your walls are

made of paper, what's the matter with you?

ALGREN

This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing

to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act

like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house.

What is wrong with you?

ALGREN

Do you have a soul at all?

46.

KATSUMOTO

Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword.

ALGREN

Is that what he's doing?

KATSUMOTO

At what age did you become I soldier?

ALGREN

Nineteen.

KA TSUMOTO

To fight in your American civil war.

ALGREN

Yes.

KA TSUMOTO

Tell me about that war'.

ALGREN

What about it?

KATSUMOTO

Everything.

ALGREN

Everything about the civil war?

ALGREN

That would take a year.

KATSUMOTO

You have pressing business elsewhere?

47.

ALGREN

The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the

rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it

probabl y began three years earlier when the

Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to

be returned to his master

DISOLVE TO:

ALGREN

--and Pickett says he wants to do it, over

Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know

what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men

go up that hill. And most of them die.

KATSUMOTO

Was that wise?

ALGREN

No, it was stupid.

KATSUMOTO

Why?

ALGREN

The point of a battle is to win, or at least have

enough men survive to fight another day.

KATSUMOTO

You did not try to survive when we took you

prisoner.

ALGREN

What do you want from me?

KATSUMOTO

What do you want for yourself?

ALGREN

You know they're not going to ransom me.

KATSUMOTO

We have little use for money.

48.

ALGREN

(mounting fury)

Then what are you doing, why are you asking me

these questions, what is going on here?

KATSUMOTO

The snows will melt in May, and the passes will

open, and the events of the world will unfold.

Until that time, you are here.

(smiles)

I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I

hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue

to live among these strange people.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Each day I am confounded by their strange customs

and contradictions, savagery followed by

mildness.

49.

ALGREN (V.O.)

They seem to value nothing more than their

families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded

men without a shade of remorse..

ALGREN

ALGREN

Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?]

(bolds up chopsticks)

What is this?

YORITOMO

Hashi.

ALGREN

Hashi.

YORITOMO

Hail!

YORITOMO

Yoritomo.

ALGREN

(points to himself)

Algren.

YORITOMO

All-gren.

YORITOMO

(points to each in rum)

Higen. Toshiie. Taka.

50.

ALGREN

(bowing)

Higen. Toshiie.

(turns to Taka)

Taka.

KATSUMOTO

The parliament of your country has two houses.

Why is that?

ALGREN

To keep either one from being too powerful.

KATSUMOTO

Does not a people need a powerful ruler to

protect them?

ALGREN

We believe the opposite.

ALGREN

I have a question. How do you come to speak

English?

KATSUMOTO

Members of the Council were required to study

I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.

ALGREN

So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to

protect it.

ALGREN

And now you must hate him for what he's done.

KATSUMOTO

He is my blood. I serve him with my life.

ALGREN

By fighting his army?

51.

KATSUMOTO

I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who

seek to influence him, those who betray the soul

of my country.

KA TSUMOTO

The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors

400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his

sacred honor.

KATSMUOTO

It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy

Act. A samurai's sword is his soul.

ALGREN

This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line

near the edge?

KATSUMOTO

One man is flexible and compromises too much

to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he

wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know

peace. A man who knows both is the perfect

warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel

bends, and the other cuts. And where they

meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. .

KATSUMOTO

Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the

blood of its enemy.

ALGREN

The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y

seven minutes.

KA TSUMOTO

We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It

takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile

awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy

to know who you have killed.

52.

ALGREN

I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.

KATSUMOTO

Do you?

ALGREN

I think all killing's a filthy business.

KATSUMO

TO Taking a man's life is

nothing. It is his honor you

can never take awa y.

ALGREN

In other words you have no respect for human life.

KA TSUMOTO

(fierce) .

What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for

money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons?

What is your legacy?

ALGREN

(undaunted)

And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the

South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting

for "honor" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands!

ALGREN

And my wife is dead.

KATSUMOTO

Mine, too.

KATSUMOTO

Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for

dominance in the..."Far East."

ALGREN

...I look forward to it.

53.

ALGREN (V.O.)

March 9. 1877. I have never known such a disciplined

people.

ALGREN (V.O.)

From the moment they wake, they devote themselves

to the perfection of whatever they pursue--

ALGREN (V.O.)

And yet the more time I spend here, the less I understand them.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Everyone is polite, every nuance of behavior seems to

have a great meaning, and increasingly I am convinced

that the lower they bow, the leas they mean it.

ALGREN (V.O.)

And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding

and unfathomable as I find theirs.

54.

YORITOMO

A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind.

ALGREN

What?

YORITOMO

(pointing as he explains)

Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch, too many mind.

(on Algren's confused expression)

No mind.

ALGREN

No mind?

YORITOMO

Hai! No mind. You try.

OMURA

Your majest y, beg permission to approach.

(the Emperor nods)

Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his

Majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.

EMPEROR

(after a long moment)

I am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float

upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.

OMURA

Yes, they represent the highest form of gyoko.

About the order, your Majest y.

55.

EMPEROR

This railroad must go through Yoshino Province?

OMURA

It is absolutely necessar y your Highness.

EMPEROR

If you sa y so, I shall sign.

KATSUMOTO (O.S.)

A perfect blossom is a rare thing...

KA TSUMOTO

You could spend your life looking for one.

And it would not be a wasted life.

ALGREN

Were you praying?

KATSUMOTO

Just sitting... I do not think I have the word.

Satori it means, maybe, awareness.

ALGREN

Of what?

KATSUMOTO

This moment alone, apart from all others ... You

know this?

(Algren shakes his head)

I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent.

I have only written one line on "His eyes were like my

own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean."

Can you suggest a second line?

ALGREN

I'm not much of a writer.

KA TSUMOTO

Is this why you spend so much time with your journal?

56.

.                     ALGREN

How do you know that?

(no answer)

She told you.

ALGREN

Did you love her husband as your own son?

KA TSUMOTO

You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have.

ALGREN

The difference is, you feel nothing.

KA TSUMOTO

Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.

ALGREN

What does that have to do with anything?

KA TSUMOTO

You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of trees.

ALGREN

How do you know?

KA TSUMOTO

The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.

ALGREN

(reluctantly)

We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother

and I climbed the maple trees.

KA TSUMOTO

Were they beautiful?

ALGREN

Yes.

KATSUMOTO

And you were sad to see them die in the winter.

KATSUMOTO

You were something before you were a soldier. You

were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the

trees die.

57.

KA TSUMOTO

Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is

an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.

We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup

of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold.

KA TSUMOTO

Every life we take.

KATSUMOTO

Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the

samurai.

58.

ALGREN (V.O.)

I am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate

in a1l it   s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly

without      sentiment. Even the children have a gravity

beyond      their years.

ALGREN

(in Japanese, subtitles)

Would last longer ... if stone.

YORITOMO

(subtitles)

No. House fall. House go back easy with wood.

ALGREN (V.O.)

And yet I have never seen a people with more capacity

for the joy found in the simplest things of life.

59.

TAKA

(subtitles)

No, please.

ALGREN

(insistent)

Hai.

TAKA

(subtitles)

Japanese men do not help with this.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

I know.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

I am not Japanese.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

1... didn't know he was your husband.

TAKA

(struck; subtitles)

He did his duty. You did your duty.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

And you do yours.

TAKA

(softl y)

Hai.

60.

61.

KATSUMOTO

The Emperor has requested my presence.

We leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.

ALGREN (V.O.)

April 13, 1877. Tomorrow we return to

civilization. As eager as I am to be among my

own kind, I confess to a curious reluctance.

ALGREN (V.O.)

These months have marked me, and I don't fully

know yet wh y.

ALGREN (V.O.)

I do know it is here that I have known my first

untroubled sleep in many years.

TAKA

(subtitles)

You are alwa ys welcome in our home.

ALGREN

Domo Arrigato.

62.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

...You will finish it soon.

TAKA

(subtitles)

If that is my destiny.

ALGREN

... The Emperor sends a message for you to return

to Tokyo, and you go?

KATSUMOTO

Yes.

ALGREN

Even though you're in rebellion against him.

KATSUMOTO

Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As

I have alwa ys done.    .

ALGREN

I don't understand.

KATSUMOTO

Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must

sa y to him.

ALGREN

But ever yone around him wants you dead.

KA TSUMOTO

And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his

command.

63.

KATSUMOTO

We will stop here for the night.

KATSUMOTO

Sit, Captain.

KATSUMOTO

Do you drink tea?

ALGREN

I've had little else for some time...

ALGREN

How's your poem coming?

KATSUMOTO

I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very

good poet.

(Algren smiles)

Do you know wh y you were sent here? To

Yoshino.

ALGREN

To protect the railroad.

.                              KATSUMOTO

Why is the railroad here?

ALGREN

So Tokyo can control the whole country.

64.

KATSUMOTO

You have seen my province. All mountains.

Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come

here?

ALGREN

You have something they want

KATSUMOTO

What do they want in my mountains?

ALGREN

Minerals ... Gold.

KA TSUMOTO

(smiles)

There is no gold in Japan.

ALGREN

Coal?

(Katsumoto looks at him)

For steamships.

KA TSUMOTO

And why would steamships be so important?

ALGREN

...China.

KATSUMOTO

Japan has nothing. China has ever ything.

ALGREN

Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to

China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and

America have a monopol y on the China trade.

KATSUMOTO

Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the

Zaibatus?

ALGREN

The wealthy families.

65.

KATSUMOTO

As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within

four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country

grows, so will his wealth.

(looks at him)

This is why you are fighting.

ALGREN

And you will tell the emperor to stop them?

KATSUMOTO

I do not tell the emperor what to do.

ALGREN

Then what do you hope to accomplish?

KATSUMOTO

Will you return to America?

ALGREN

...I have a job here.

KATSUMOTO

You should return to your home.

ALGREN

Why?

KATSUMOTO

Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy again.

KATSUMOTO

Go home Captain ... Anshinritsumai. I wish you peace.

66.

67.

68.

69.

70.

71.

BAGLEY

Algren? My God, you never cease to astonish.

ALGREN

They have new weapons.

BAGLEY

The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along

with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we

Americans still have a few teeth in our head.

BAGLEY

The ambassador and I have spent eight months

kissing Omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade

pact with us. You spent all this time living with

those savages?

(A1gren looks at him)

He's going to want to talk to you...

ALGREN

I need a bath.

BAGLEY

And your back pay, I imagine.

72.

BAGLEY

They got their flag. ...See?

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

No, Mori-san. We arc "civilized" now.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

I cannot touch the Sacred One.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

You can.

OMURA

(subtitles)

Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister Katsumoto?

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

It was uneventful.

73.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

If it is not a great imposition. I desire a moment alone with

Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.

OMURA

(subtitles)

Enlightened One, perhaps I can be of service in a conversation

of state.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid

me in private for neglecting my studies.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

You rise against me, my teacher.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

No, Highness, I rise against your enemies.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

They are my teacher, my advisers, like you.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

They advise in their own interest.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what

goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science.

I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be

left behind, and defenseless.

KATSUM OTO

(subtitles)

I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.

EMPEROR

(subtit1es)

The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against

a future you don't understand.

74.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

If I am no use, then I will happily end my life,

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State.

I need your voice.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You

are a living God, you can do what ever you

think is right.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

I am a living God only as long as I do what they

think is right.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitle)

Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying

what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic

drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone

a young man I know to have some modest intelligence.

EMPEROR

(subtitles)

Is it possible a living God can be too afraid to make

his voice heard?

(Katsumoto's look is not unkind)

Tell me what to do, Mori-San?

KATSUMOTO

(subtitles)

You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find

the wisdom for all of us.

75.

BAGLEY

As soon as they sign the agreement, they're obligated

to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers

to Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item

you might recognize.

BAGLEY

They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute,

The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.

ALGREN (V.O.)

May 15, 1877. The city I return to is immeasurabl y

changed

ALGREN (V.O.)

As though Tokyo were determined to become

another New York or Chicago .- all in one

headlong rush.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

(to Algren)

If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics.

But remember, this has to do with a lot more than

just weapons.

76.

SECRETARY

Ambassador Swanbeck, if you'll follow me.

OMURA

Please, sit down, gentlemen.

OMURA

(re: cigarette case)

A gift from Czar Alexander... Captain Algren,. it seems

you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.

ALGREN

Yes, sir.

OMURA

He's an extraordinary man, isn't he?

ALGREN

He is samurai.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

Mr. Omura, my people have been drawing up the documents

we discussed. I have a draft--

OMURA

We're not quite ready to announce the treaty, Ambassador.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

Excuse me?

OMURA

The Emperor is...sentimental. Katsumoto was his old mentor--

he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more days.

77.

AMBASSJ\DOR SW ANBECK

How many da ys is " a few?"

OMURA

I assure you the Samurai will not stand in the

wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

Soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.

OMURA

Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this array of

ordnance be sufficient?

ALGREN

Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

OMURA

I want my country to take its place as a modern power.

ALGREN

Then they will set you well on your way.

OMURA

I am pleased.

AMDASSADOR SW ANBECK

Mr. Omura, you assured us you had the influence

with your emperor to make this deal come to

pass. With all due respect perhaps there is someone

else we should be speaking to.

OMURA

With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps there is

someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the

French. Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting

in the next room.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

Yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.

OMURA

Good afternoon, gentlemen.

OMURA

Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment

And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious

provinces.

78.

OMURA

Cigarette?

ALGREN

Thank you.

OMURA

You fought bravely on behalf of our army--

against the rebel Katsumoto.

OMURA

And yet you helped save his life when attacked

by the Ninja.

ALGREN

My role was much less significant than you may have heard.

OMURA

Tell me about your role in Katsumoto's plans.

ALGREN

I have none.

OMURA

And your sympathies?

ALGREN

Again, I have none.

OMURA

I know you have little sympathy for Colonel Bagley.

ALGREN

He is.... unsympathetic.

OMURA

I thought it was we who are inscrutable.

OMURA

You have gained important knowledge of Katsumoto's

province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely

valuable to me.

79.

OMURA

You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my

weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to

Katsumoto.

ALGREN

Again, you flatter me.

OMURA

No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable.

And I buy it.

(looks at him)

In this case, I value your loyalt y.

ALGREN

I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.

OMURA

Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future

friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.

ALGREN

(stands)

Then I will consider it.

OMURA

And I will be grateful.

CLERK

All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves tomorrow

if you want a steamship you'll have to wait six weeks.

(Algren is silent)

Gets ya to Frisco by the 28th. 14 dollars for a

private cabin, 8 for a shared or 3 for a lower berth.

What can I put you down for?

CLERK

Sir..?

ALGREN

(after a moment)

Private cabin.

80.

GRAHAM

Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white

man has ever been in your position. Do you

have any idea what it will mean to have Omura

as your friend? You want land, you want women,

you want boys?

GRAHAM

Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years.

You must believe me there is a majest y about

these people -- can you imagine what your own

country would be if it had half the drive and the

discipline and the belief and the bravery of these

ridiculous little people?

ALGREN

Whit is this?

GRAHAM

My God, it's the edicts...

ALGREN

What edicts?

ALGREN

That's enough--

81.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

YORITOMO, WAIT!

GRAHAM

Don't be stupid.

KATSUMOTO

Captain, I had not thought to see you again.

82.

ALGREN

I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to

tell you what's going on here.

KATSUMOTO

You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers,

is that how you sa y it?

ALGREN

They're about to close a trade agreement that

will bring this country more weapons than

you can imagine.

KATSUMOTO

Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows

the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to

need those weapons before be will sign.

ALGREN

(realizing)

And you are to be the cause...

KATSUMOTO

Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause

a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons.

The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed

so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your

country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu

what it wants. And my country is sold to yours.

KA TSUMOTO

Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for

the elimination of our traditional topknots.

ALGREN

I know.

KATSUMOTO

The second banned the wearing of sword.

KATSUMOTO

(re: his swords)

Hand them to me, will you?

ALGREN

If you do this, they will kill you.

83.

KA TSUMOTO

I am hard to kill.

ALGREN

You don't know what their weapons can do. All

your men butchered ... Just for pride.

KATSUMOTO

Not for pride. For the emperor.

ALGREN

But the emperor is the one signing the agreement.

KATSUMOTO

He has not signed it yet.

ALGREN

Is it worth it? ... just for these,

KATSUMOTO

I cannot live without my soul ... Can you?

OMURA

(subtitled)

Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.

84.

KATSUMOTO

(subtitled)

It is my honor to join again the men who are leading

Japan into her glorious future.

OMURA

(subtitled)

You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict

regarding the wearing of swords?

KATSUMOTO

(subtitled)

I read ever y edict with singular attention.

OMURA

(subtitled)

Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?

KATSUMOTO

(subtitled)

This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred

years--

OMURA

(interrupting, subtitled)

We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now.

KATSUMOTO

(calm, subtitled) .

We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western

"allies."

KATSUMOTO

(subtitled)

Does Japan no longer need its patriots?

OMURA

(subtitled)

Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his

country trapped in the past, or the man who would help

his people into the future?

KATSUMOTO

(subtitled)

A future with no honor,

OMURA

(subtitled)

Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And

teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so

they will live.    .

85.

KATSUMOTO

And lining your own pockets in the process.

OMURA

(subtitled)

Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask

you to remove your sword, as this body has declared

in its edict.

KATSUMOTO

This sword serves the emperor, and only he can

command me to remove it.

OMURA

(quickly)

Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is

too pure and great to be heard in such worldly

circumstance as the Council of State.

KATSUMOTO

Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my

sword.

OMURA

Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to

accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where

you will be our honored guest. I think you will

find the surroundings there quite harmonious.

KA TSUMOTO

(subtitled)

Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done

and feel what I never will ... shame.

86.

GRAHAM

Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave

without even saying goodbye?

ALGREN

I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.

GRAHAM

You sod.

(trying to keep up)

Christ, give us. . second here

GRAHAM

You're making a mistake, I promise you.

Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made

his move -- he'll need you more than ever --

GRAHAM

Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that

time you were with him, up in those mountains,

GRAHAM

Then you should get out. Because Omura will

become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.

GRAHAM

Case in point.

ALGREN

Who are they?

GRAHAM

Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai

doing odd jobs for his Nibs.

87.

ALGREN

What do they want from me?

GRAHAM

To make sure you're on the side of God and

Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.

ALGREN

You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you.

GRAHAM

Look who's getting sentimental now.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

Take back to quarters. I walk.

88.

89.

BAGLEY

Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes you.

ALGREN

Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion.

BAGLEY

...Heard you were leaving, actually?

ALGREN

Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train his

personal guard.

BAGLEY

Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you

think that is?

90.

ALGREN

Could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up

his ass?

OMURA

Gentlemen...

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

Omura, you have a lovel y home. It must be very old.

OMURA

Nothing is "old" in Japan, ever ything is "ancient."

... But the views are pleasant. Sit down...

OMURA

Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is

the 'Leibestod' from Tristan and Isolde.

ALGREN

I'm surprised you enjoy it. Literally translated it

means `love/death. '

(looks at him)         .

A samurai concept, don't you think?

OMURA

Champagne? And cigars, of course.

91.

BAGLEY

(re: cigar)

A gift from President Grant?

OMURA

(smiles)

Queen Victoria.

ALGREN

Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?

OMURA

Certainly.

OMURA

Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I noticed

a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the

investment protocols for coal.

92.

ALGREN

This wa y...

ALGREN

How's the poem coming?

KATSUMOTO

The ending is proving difficult.

OMURA

What has become of Captain Algren?

KATSUMOTO

(re:Graham)

Who is this?

ALGREN

Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book

about you.

93.

GRAHAM

An honor. I have followed your activities with

great interest. I think the European public

would be fascinated by a book about your

adventures.

KATSUMOTO

Not a book. A play!

94.

ALGREN

Come on.

YORITOMO

(subtitled)

You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.

95.

ALGREN

No--

YORITOMO

...Please.

YORITOMO

(subtitled)

Tell my family.

ALGREN

No. Wait...!

ALGREN

There's a wa y out. Look--!

96.

ALGREN

This place is designed to keep people from getting

in, not from getting out. We can make it

KA TSUMOTO

This was your plan?

ALGREN

Do you have a better one?

ALGREN

I may die. But I'll die trying.

BAGLEY

... 1 don't know what to say, sir. I never would

have thought him capable of treason.

OMURA

I would say Captain Algren's acts tonight have

assured our success.

97.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

What do you mean?

OMURA

Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight.

We will destroy them with your new weapons.

BAGLEY

What if he just goes off to the mountains and

becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?

OMURA

You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can

do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama.

He must act out his destiny. He knows it.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

You trust a lot in destiny.

OMURA

This story was written years ago. From the first

sight of your warships in our harbor...

(stares out the window)

It is a1l inevitable.

ALGREN (V.O.)

June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field where

Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom

I now ride.

ALGREN (V.O.)

I am beset by ironies -- trained to fight rebels

now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f... can a man

be reborn?:

ALGREN (V.O.)

And if so, what would he make of it?

98.

KATSUMOTO

(his voice troubled)

I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And

yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were

you sent into my life. What is the lesson you

were meant to give me?

ALGREN

Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we

thought...

KATSUMOTO

You...ain't whistlin' Dixie...

ALGREN

(subtitles)

... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y.

TAKA

(subtitles)

Thank you, Algren-San.

99.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

Will you fight the white men?

ALGREN

(subtitles)

If they come here, yes.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

Why?

ALGREN

(subtitles)

Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.

TAKA

(subtitles)

The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He

misses his father.

ALGREN

And he is angry because I am the cause of that.

TAKA

No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well.

ALGREN

Higen.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

That is what he believed.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

I would be afraid to die in battle.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

So would I.

100.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

But you have been in many battles.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

And I was always afraid.

HIGEN

(subtitles)

I don't want you to go.

KATSUMOTO

Algren-san.

KATSUMOTO

They are corning.

ALGREN

I call it five thousand troops. They'll come in

waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between

each wave.

101.

ALGREN

German formations have the infantry staggered

with on1y light flanking. They'll come straight on

with rifles and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only

accurate to about 150 yards. They'll look to

overthrow us.

ALGREN

Colonel.

BAGLEY

Captain... (to Katsumoto)... Sir, the Imperial

Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you

and your fellows lay down your arms you will

not be harmed.

KATSUMOTO

That is not possible. As Omura knows.

BAGLEY

Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You

ride against us and you are the same as they are.

ALGREN

I take that as a compliment, Colonel.

(a deadly calm)

I'll look for you on the field.

ALGREN

They have the howitzers.

KATSUMOTO

How many?

ALGREN

About a dozen.

102.

ALGREN

A man could get lost up there ... Build an army.

Hold out a very long time.

KATSUMOTO

Algren-san...Have you seen what happens to the

villages that stand In the way of the railroad?

KATSUMOTO

That is what will happen to my village if we do

not stand and fight.

(looks at him)

No. We serve the Emperor here.

ALGREN

By dying?

KATSUMOTO

Perhaps.

ALGREN

At least make it battle, not a suicide.

KATSUMOTO

And what would that accomplish?

ALGREN

It might give you one more day ... One more

fine day like this.

103.

ALGREN (V.O.)

July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have managed

to convince myself that there was nothing worth

believing in.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Certainly nothing worth dying for.

ALGREN (V.O.)

Now I am not so sure.

ALGREN (V.O.)

And so, for the first time in my life, I am truly

afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something

worth living for.

GRAHAM

What is it:? .

ALGREN

The kenbu,.. his dance of death.

TAKA

(subtitles)

Algren-san, will you come with me?

104.

TAKA

(subtitles)

If you wear this, it will honor us.

kimono. Her hands move gracefull y around his body, never quite touching

KATSUMOTO

So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I

meet my ancestors ... (dry) ... You do not do this ?

ALGREN

I studied war at a place called West Point. They

taught us about a battle called Thermopylae.

Three hundred brave warriors held off the king

of Persia's army of a million men. For two da ys

they made them pay so dearly that the king lost

all appetite for further invasion

(looks at him)

... I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow.

KATSUMOTO

(bemused)

Do you really think we can defeat them?

105.

ALGREN

I sure as hell want to find out.

KATSUMOTO

You believe a man can change his destiny?

ALGREN

No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny.

He can only do what he can, until his destiny is

revealed.

ALGREN

What does it say?

KATSUMOTO

"I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways

have joined the new."

TAKA

(subtitles)

Return.

106.

ALGREN

(subtitles)

If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I

wish you peace.]

TAKA

Anshinritsumai.

ALGREN

Mr. Graham....

GRAHAM

Captain?

ALGREN

Would you please stay with the horses?

GRAHAM

As you suggest.

107.

ALGREN

Mr. Graham ... Take this.

ALGREN

Maybe you can use it for your book.

GRAHAM

I will.

ALGREN

The call to advance.

KATSUMOTO

Tell me ... what happened to those three hundred

warriors at Thermopylae?

108.

ALGREN

(a grim smile)

Dead to the last man.

HAGLEY

What the hell?

109.

OMURA

It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.

(snaps an order)

Send in the second wave. Two divisions.

KATSUMOTO

How long?

ALGREN

They need to regroup and report our position. Then

they'll come hard.

KA TSUMOTO

It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot

tell one warrior from another.

ALGREN

They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a

modern army.

KATSUMOTO

Not my world anymore.

110.

BAGLEY

A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using

Welt Point tactics.

111.

KATSUMOTO

He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend.

ALGREN

We won't be able to hold them back this time.

KATSUMOTO

This is not your battle. You do not have to die

here.

A long beat.

ALGREN

I died a long time ago.

KATSUMOTO

But now you live again.

ALGREN

Yes.

KATSUMOTO

It was not your time.

ALGREN

No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day.

112.

ALGREN

I'll stay.

BAGLEY

The gatling guns. Quickly.

113.

114.

BAGLEY

Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!

115.

KATSUMOTO

Help me up...

ALGREN

Just -- stay there.

KATSUMOTO

Help me up.

KATSUMOTO

My sword...

ALGREN

No.

KA TSUMOTO

You have your honor again. Let me die with

mine ... Kaishaku.

KATSUMOTO

You must help me. Hold it firmly...

KA TSUMOTO

Are you ready?

ALGREN

No, Kaishaku.

116.

Katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.

KATSUMOTO

We will ride together again.

KATSUMOTO

(whispers)

It is perfect... They are all perfect.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity

and cooperation between our two great nations.

OMURA

(subtitles)

Highness, if we could just conclude the matter

at hand...

117.

OMURA

(subtitled)

All your enemies are dead, Enlightened One.

EMPEROR/TRANSLATOR

(to Algren)

You were with him at the end.

ALGREN/TRANSLA TOR

Yes. He asked that I bring you this -- that the

strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.

OMURA

(after a moment)

En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but

the future of our country lies in-

EMPEROR

My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years.

And for all that time we have slept. During my

sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified

Japan. Of a country strong and independent and

modern...

(touches the sword lovingly)

And now we are awake. We have railroads and

cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot

forget who we are. Or where we come from.

.

EMPEROR

Ambassador Swanbeck I have concluded that your treaty

is not in the best interests of my people.

AMBASSADOR SWANDECK

Sir, if I may--

EMPEROR

You may not. From this moment on, economic investment

from ever y nation will be considered equally.

118.

AMBASSADOR SWANBECK

This is an outrage--

OMURA

(subtitled)

Enlightened One, we should discuss this

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

Omura, do you know our northern island?

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

There is a small one called Taraku. A rock in the sea.

There is nothing there but crabs who have been known

to tear a sleeping man apart ... I have had a small house

constructed on the island. You will go there now and

await our summons.

OMURA

(subtitled)

Sir...?

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

I hereby seize your family's assets and present them

as my gift to the people.

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

Further, I have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion

into Yoshino.

OMURA

(subtitled)

Enlightened One

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

You have served your function. I have no more

need of you ... You can conspire with the crabs

now. Remove yourself.

119.

OMURA

(protests, subtitled)

Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you

disgrace me.

EMPEROR

(subtitled)

If your shame is too unbearable ... I offer you

this sword.

EMPEROR

(in English again)

The samurai is not a man now. He is an idea.

(a beat)

Tell me how he died.

ALGREN

I will tell you how he lived.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

...And so the days of the samurai had ended.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

And in the years to come the Rising Sun of Imperial Japan

would fl y in triumph over Korea, over Russia, even over

China. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have

their own destiny

120.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

As for the American Captain, no one knows

what became of him. All that is left is his journal

which I have published, according to his last request.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

Some lay he died of his wounds, others that he

returned to his own country...

GRAHAM (V.O.)

But I like to think he may have found at last

some small measure of the peace we all seek,

but few of us ever find.

GRAHAM (V.O.)

Anshinritsumai. [I wish you peace.]
