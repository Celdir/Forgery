"Three Kings", shooting draft, by David O Russell

THREE KINGS

Draft Date: 6/22/98

TROY

Are we shooting people, or what?

SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)

Are we shooting?

TROY

That's what I'm asking you.

SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)

What's the answer?

TROY

I don't know the answer. That's

what I'm trying to find out.

SOLDIER #3

It looks like a grain of sand, but

I don't know how I'm gonna get it

out--

CAPTAIN VAN METER

If they surrender, don't shoot, if

they don't surrender, then shoot.

SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)

That guy just shot a towel head.

SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)

Bullshit.

SMASH CUT TO

VIG (V.O.)

(deep southern accent)

Congratulations, you got yourself

a rag head, my man.

VIG

Dag.

TROY

"Gettin' bugged drivin' up and

down the same old strip, gotta

find a new place where the kids

are hip, I get around --"

SOLDIER #1

I didn't think I'd see anyone get

shot over here.

VIG

It looked like the guy's head blew

three feet into the air --

SOLDIER #1

Bullshit, that's not what happened.

VIG

I said it

looked

like that

happened, but then we got here and

he was still breathing.

SOLDIER #2

Oh, my God, it's just like

'Predator,' where the guy, the

black guy --

SOLDIER #3

Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot

off.

VIG

And when it hits the ground, his

hand keeps on firing.

SOLDIER #5

Take my picture.

VIG

Do you still want to sell pictures?

TROY

(distracted monotone)

For twenty.

SOLDIER #5

Twenty dollars, man, what's the

meaning of life?

TROY

You're lucky you got to see

anybody shot in this war.

VIG

War's been over five days, Jim,

ain't gonna be much more of this.

SOLDIER #5

Bobby, take my picture.

SOLDIER #4

If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

SOLDIER #5

It's not like he shot a fucking

deer. It's the enemy.

VIG

Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.

TROY

Accept no substitute, this is the

real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --

VIG

What's wrong?

TROY

I got a really bad headache all of

a sudden--

VIG

No free pictures, motherfucker.

BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)

Spirits are high and the music is

boisterous as these young troops

celebrate -- Shit. Let me try that

again.

BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)

Spirits are high and the music is

fucking motherfucking sand in my

eye --

ARCHIE GATES

Is that what you got from this

experience? A goddamn watch?

HAVICHON

Ees a great fucking watch.

ARCHIE GATES

There's 700 million in gold out

there and you're fucking around

with a watch?

HAVICHON

Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of

gold, man.

ARCHIE GATES

One bunker of gold and we retire

from this horseshit, Hashy--

BILL SMITHSON

Gates.

ARCHIE GATES

Just a second.

The problem, Hash,

is how do you find it?

HAVICHON

Like one sowsan bunker out sair --

ARCHIE GATES

Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair,

Hash, how do you find Saddam's

bullion?

BILL SMITHSON

Could I have some help over here,

for Chrissakes?

ARCHIE GATES

My goodness, Bill, what seems to

be the problem?

BILL SMITHSON

I'm trying to do a story here and

the fucking sand is blowing in my

face --

ARCHIE GATES

You want me to stop the sand? I

can't do anything about that.

BILL SMITHSON

No, you're too busy talking about

the fucking gold, which by the way

makes a great story if you'd get

me a goddamn lead on it --

ARCHIE GATES

I think the Saddam story goes more

for the jugular, journalistically

speaking, I mean, he's still here

beating the shit out of his

country.

BILL SMITHSON

Would you just be my guide and not

my fucking producer? You're my

guide.

ARCHIE GATES

OK, go do your celebration story,

Bill.

SOLDIER #5

We're number one.

SOLDIER #6

Waaaa-hooooo--

BILL SMITHSON

You're heroes.

SOLDIER #6

We're heroes.

SOLDIER #7

Give war a chance.

BILL SMITHSON

You've exorcised the ghosts of

Vietnam with a clear moral

imperative --

SOLDIER #5

Is that what we did?

BILL SMITHSON

Where the hell are you going?

ARCHIE GATES

I'll be right back.

BILL SMITHSON

I don't want you helping other

reporters, goddamn it.

SOLDIER #1

We kicked ass.

SOLDIER #6

We didn't get rid of fucking

Saddam --

SOLDIER #8

Which totally sucks a big dick.

SOLDIER #6

Those people are getting reemed --

SOLDIER #7

Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.

BILL SMITHSON

Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?

SOLDIER #8

I don't know who they are, man --

SOLDIER #6

We got big firepower but we ain't

saving them --

SOLDIER #5

Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.

SOLDIER #1

Weehaaaaaaa.

SOLDIERS (CHANT)

'If tomorrow all the things were

gone that I worked for all my life

and I had to start again with just

my children and my wife--'

SOLDIERS (CHANT OS)

'I'd thank my lucky stars to --

CHOPPER PILOTS

'--be livin' here today because

the flag still stands for freedom

and they can't take that

awayyyyy --'

TROY

(screaming the song)

And I'm proud I to be an American,

where at least I know I'm free.

And I won't forget the men who

died, who gave that right to me.

And I'd gladly stand up; next to

you and defend her still today.

Cause there ain't no doubt I love

this land, God bless the U S A --

TROY

Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

VIG

Rahhhhhhhhh.

TROY

Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Goddamn it, where the fuck did

this beer come from we gotta take

more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.

TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE)

Hasnala shi aluno quibaan --

CAPTAIN VAN METER

We will not hurt you. Lay down

your weapons, get on the ground --

TROY

It's cool, no one's gonna hurt

you --

VIG

Did you rape and torture anybody

in Kuwait, Abdul?

TROY

You're making them all hysterical.

VIG

Take your fucking rags off, take

this off. No comprende English,

motherfucker?

TROY

What is your fucking problem,

Conrad?

VIG

I'm trying to git him to obey the

spirit of things but he won't take

his rags off.

TROY

(leans down)

Sir? We need you to disrobe like

all the other towel heads, OK?

VIG

Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.

TROY

There's a document in that guy's

ass, Conrad.

VIG

That's the freaky thing.

WALTER

Do you think he ate it?

TROY

It wouldn't come out perfect like

that if he ate it.

TROY

Go get it, Private.

IRAQI OFFICER

Hasa man timal!

TROY

Open it up.

VIG

You only gave me one glove.

TROY

I'm sorry I don't have another,

but you gotta open it up. That's

how the chain of command works.

VIG

What the hell is that?

TROY

Important enough to squeeze your

cheeks for.

CATHY DAITCH

You are a trained warrior, trained

warrior, trained warrior, Jesus

Christ, Colonel!

CATHY DAITCH

(breathless)

What's Bill got?

ARCHIE GATES

Just the celebration story.

CATHY DAITCH

That's it?

ARCHIE GATES

That's it --

ARCHIE GATES

How about you? Did you find

anything?

CATHY DAITCH

It could be another bullshit lead

but I need you to help me find a

guy who might have something on

the gold --

ARCHIE GATES

Who's the guy?

CATHY DAITCH

Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company

B--

ARCHIE GATES

Barlow.

CATHY DAITCH

Got a map out of a prisoner's head.

ARCHIE GATES

Out of a prisoner's head?

CATHY DAITCH

Or his ear, or his ass, or his

dick, and they got like a fifty

page full-color mini atlas of

Saddam's bunkers --

ARCHIE GATES

Out of a guy's dick?

GENERAL PYE

This is not the way we service the

media, Major. Stop her --

MP

You are in violation of code 37D,

grinding Major Gates.

ARCHIE GATES

You guys have no manners

whatsoever --

BILL SMITHSON

I told you he was with her --

GENERAL PYE

We're handling this, OK?

BILL SMITHSON

I wanted help with the gold story,

and he took off on me--

ARCHIE GATES

That's a lot of bullshit.

GENERAL PYE

I give you a prestige job in the

media war of the century and the

guy feels neglected.

ARCHIE GATES

I'm helping him plenty with his

big celebration feature --

Where

did you get this fucking star?

GENERAL HORN

They made me a general, pal.

ARCHIE GATES

For what? I don't even know what

we did over here, but Schwartzkopf

gets a book deal, you get a star,

Powell gets to be fucking

president--

GENERAL HORN

Are you high? This is a huge win

for us.

ARCHIE GATES

Running the press pool's a real

big win for me.

GENERAL PYE

You want us to kill more Americans

to occupy Iraq?

ARCHIE GATES

I'm just saying it's ironic,

that's all.

GENERAL HORN

What the fuck is ironic?

ARCHIE GATES

We got the biggest army in the

world here but Iraq still has the

d-bag dictator in power, but

that's how the world works I guess.

GENERAL PYE

Just take care of Smithson and

maybe he'll hook you up to consult

on movies.

GENERAL HORN

It's either that or be a security

guard when you retire.

ARCHIE GATES

Fuck you, Ron.

GENERAL HORN

I'm a general now, you can't say

fuck you to me.

ARCHIE GATES

OK, sir, but there's another thing

I'd like to say, if you don't mind.

GENERAL HORN

Go right ahead, Colonel.

ARCHIE GATES

Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.

TROY

You've washed your hands like a

thousand times, Conrad.

VIG

Lord knows what vermin live in the

butt of a dune koon.

DOC

Why do you let this cracker follow

you around?

TROY

He's a good kid.

DOC

He's a wall-eyed cracker.

TROY

He's got no high school, man, he's

from a group home in Jackson --

DOC

I don't give a shit if he's from

Johannesburg. I don't want to hear

dune koon or sand nigger from him

or anybody.

VIG

Captain uses those terms.

TROY

The point is, Conrad, 'towel head'

and 'camel jockey' are perfectly

good substitutes.

DOC

Exactly.

VIG

I'm sorry, man, it's a little

confusing is all.

DOC

What can I do for your headache?

TROY

Got any Vicadan?

DOC

All gone. How about Caffergot?

TROY

Excellent. Let's translate my

Iraqi ass map.

TROY

Van Meter's at the big pow wow?

DOC

We're cool for at least three

hours, but keep Walter on the door.

TROY

Would you take those fucking

things off?

WALTER

I never got to use night vision.

TROY

They don't work during the day and

stand outside the tent.

DOC

These are definitely Saddam's

bunkers near Karbala.

TROY

What's inside?

DOC

According to Intelligence --

Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes,

Sony you name it --  Kuwait was

Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam

sacked it.

VIG

Man, get an awesome stereo system

with like ten BOS speakers  --

TROY

Silver Lexus convertible.

DOC

Lexus doesn't make a convertible.

TROY

Yes, they do.

DOC

Infiniti has one coming.

TROY

You're wrong.

DOC

You can't get a car home from here

anyway.

TROY

If I get enough Rolexes I could

buy one when I got home.

VIG

One gold Rolex, I get a very fine

split level outside Jackson.

TROY

My one problem, see, is the risk

here --

DOC

What risk? We already did the

risk. I signed up last year to

bank some computer training--

TROY

Tell me about it.

DOC

Next thing I know I'm sitting here

waiting to get hit by a Scud. I

put my life on the line for what

purpose I'm not sure, and now the

good Lord puts this map in my

path --

TROY

He could put a land mine in your

path if we try to find this

place --

DOC

You're safe with me.

TROY

Cuz you have a galactic plutonium

forcefield.

DOC

I don't talk about it. But I do

have a ring of Jesus fire.

TROY

You have a ring of Jesus fire.

DOC

I was fire baptized.

VIG

I was baptized in water.

DOC

I'm fire baptized.

TROY

I don't even know what water

baptism means.

DOC

For those who understand, no

explanation is necessary; for

those who don't, no explanation

will suffice. You can benefit from

my Jesus ring if you do right by

me, you got that?

TROY

OK.

CUT TO

WALTER

This tent is restricted --

ARCHIE GATES

Get the fuck out of my way.

WALTER

May day, may day --

CUT TO

ARCHIE GATES

Good afternoon.

ARCHIE GATES

Would this be the proctology tent?

DOC

Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

Then maybe it's the urology tent.

TROY

Captain's at a staff meeting.

ARCHIE GATES

That's OK, I'm not looking for a

proctologist or a urologist I'm

looking for Sargeant Barlow.

ARCHIE GATES

You're on the path to truth when

you smell shit, isn't that what

they say?

VIG

I don't recognize you, sir. Are

you in this division?

DOC

He's not in this division. He's

Special Forces.

DOC

He's the guy taking Bill Smithson

around.

ARCHIE GATES

And you would be the Three Wise

Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and

Pappy --

ARCHIE GATES

That leaves Cappy outside.

CUT TO

WALTER

Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold

it, freeze. Stop. Freeze.

CUT TO

VIG

His name is Walter.

ARCHIE GATES

Did you good soldiers present this

map to Captain Van Meter?

TROY

Not yet.

ARCHIE GATES

Then I'll take it to him.

TROY

We'll take it to him. Sir.

ARCHIE GATES

It won't do either of us any good

then, will it?

TROY

He's our commander, sir. We'd have

to tell him you took it.

ARCHIE GATES

It could be nothing but a sandy

love letter from one Eye-raqi to

another --

TROY

It's a series of bunkers near

Karbala.

ARCHIE GATES

Maybe.

TROY

Not maybe, definitely. Recon

photos match the map.

ARCHIE GATES

May I look at the goddamn map?

VIG

Dag.

ARCHIE GATES

That's what makes Rangers badass,

we get the best flashlights.

ARCHIE GATES

Still looks like a series of three

bunkers in three villages. A bit

farther to the west.

DOC

Seventy-five klicks north.

ARCHIE GATES

More like 65.

TROY

Much closer to Karbala.

ARCHIE GATES

Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not

a big deal. Of course --

ARCHIE GATES

-- there could be nothing inside

but starving Arabs and stolen

watches, but I think it's worth

checking out, even if I have to do

it with clueless reservists like

you.

ARCHIE GATES

I mean, I could take the map, but

you could talk, it starts to

become a pain in the ass for me,

so we'll do the gold together.

DOC

What gold?

ARCHIE GATES

You don't even know what's inside

these bunkers, do you?

VIG

Rolexes.

ARCHIE GATES

Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking

about Kuwaiti bullion.

VIG

You mean the little cubes you put

in hot water for soup?

ARCHIE GATES

No. Not the little cubes you put

in hot water for soup.

TROY

Gold bricks.

ARCHIE GATES

5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's

market.

VIG

For one gold brick?

ARCHIE GATES

I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided

his bricks. into many different

hiding places, but just one hiding

place should be easy to take, and

that would be enough to get us out

of our day jobs. Unless the three

kings are in love with their day

jobs.

BACK TO

VIG

I don't really have a day job.

TROY

What about the risk of taking a

Humvee and all that --

ARCHIE GATES

We do this shit all the time.

VIG

What else did you do, sir?

ARCHIE GATES

In Panama we went sailing in

Noriega's boats.

TROY

Wow.

ARCHIE GATES

In Vietnam, we got a big gold

Buddha, which we unfortunately

dropped in a swamp by accident.

DOC

What about Iraqi soldiers?

ARCHIE GATES

Let's see. They had the shit

bombed out them for two months,

they're deserting all over the

place, and they've completely

surrendered to us. That's a beaten

army in every sense of the word.

ARCHIE GATES

You are now under my command,

salute --

ARCHIE GATES

What's the guy's name outside?

TROY

Walter.

ARCHIE GATES

Cappy

.

ARCHIE GATES

You will take Bill Smithson on a

special mission to find the gold

story, but it will be a

meaningless ride that lasts all

morning and takes him nowhere near

Karbala, is that clear?

WALTER

How am I gonna get out of the

company?

ARCHIE GATES

Your captain will be detained by

a friend of mine.

VIG

Is it true you got to take an

enemy ear to be Special Forces?

ARCHIE GATES

No, but if you talk to anybody

about this, I'll kill you.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

How about if I lean on it, like

this?

CATHY DAITCH

Very dashing.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Does it look too posed?

CATHY DAITCH

Would you ever stand like that?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

I think I might, Jesus, this feels

stupid.

CATHY DAITCH

You'll get used to it. First

question: did you dream as a boy

you'd be commanding an infantry

company in a desert war?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

As a boy, I wanted to be either a

veterinarian or a CIA

sharpshooter --

Bach's Gloria, from Mass in B Minor plays

as

DOC

Pull.

Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach.

DOC

Pull.

TROY

Pull.

TROY

I gave you a better arc, Doc.

DOC

What are you talking about?

TROY

I threw the ball in a higher arc

that was easier for you to hit.

DOC

Bullshit.

VIG

Blacks make better receivers than

quarterbacks.

TROY

Stop speaking right now, Conrad.

DOC

Warren Moon is an excellent

quarterback.

VIG

The Oilers have gone nowhere

behind Warren Moon.

DOC

Randall Cunningham.

TROY

Don't get down in the mud with

him, Doc.

VIG

The Eagles will never get to the

Superbowl with him.

DOC

Doug Williams took the Redskins to

the Superbowl and won, OK?

TROY

We can all agree there are many

excellent black quarterbacks.

DOC

Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker --

VIG

This gun's too heavy to shoot

one-handed like a movie star --

ARCHIE GATES

Shut the fuck up.

ARCHIE GATES

When we pull up to the bunker, the

approach is something called

violence of action, which is

standard in special operations. It

means your movement is so fast and

decisive that the guards are

frozen and we haven't fired a

single shot.

TROY

Shit.

ARCHIE GATES

We dropped a lot of bombs out here

and we buried some guys alive --

VIG

What do you mean?

ARCHIE GATES

Bradleys with big plows cut

through the berms and covered the

trenches --

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

They had the option to surrender,

but they chose to die for their

country.

ARCHIE GATES

Let's rehearse.

ARCHIE GATES

We'll say the cow is the primary

guard outside the bunker. We pull

up fast, and stop short.

TROY

Got it.

ARCHIE GATES

And --

Go.

thud

on the hood of the Humvee.

ARCHIE GATES

Who's hurt?

DOC

It's all cow, I think.

VIG

Yeah, it's all cow.

DOC

They said this was swept for mines.

ARCHIE GATES

Mines are forever, Doc. They never

get all of 'em.

TROY

(low murmur)

'If you could, help me Rhonda,

help help me Rhonda --'

ARCHIE GATES

Did you guys see any action at all?

VIG

Only night bombing on CNN, except

for Troy's supercool shooting that

guy in the neck--

ARCHIE GATES

Is sepsis cool?

VIG

What's sepsis?

DOC

Infection of the blood.

ARCHIE GATES

As in septic tank, because that's

what happens when a bullet hits

you. The lead tears in there --

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

Makes a cavity of dead tissue that

closes down in a convulsive motion

typical of all gunshot wounds. The

cavity fills up with bile and

bacteria and you're fucked.

ARCHIE GATES

But other than a wound that

blinds, paralyzes, or castrates,

the worst wound I've ever seen is

something called tension pneumo

thorax --

DOC

I heard something about that --

VIG

Tension pneumo what?

ARCHIE GATES

A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill

you, but makes a little hole in

the lung, so every time you

breathe, a little air leaks into

the chest cavity, which starts to

fill up like a balloon. And that

balloon starts to push your organs

to the side, crushing your lung,

your liver, your heart. Your own

breathing kills you, one breath at

a time -- kinda like a job you

can't stand or a bad lie you once

told.

DOC

That's not fatal, they can stop it.

ARCHIE GATES

If you know how to make another

little hole in the chest to let

the air out, just like you would

with an overinflated tire.

TROY

Can we play the Beach Boys when we

go in?

DOC

The goddamn Beach Boys.

TROY

I'm not ashamed of liking the

Beach Boys. It calms me down.

Better than Mozart.

ARCHIE GATES

Bach.

VIG

Where's the bunker?

ARCHIE GATES

It should be right --

ARCHIE GATES

There.

ARCHIE GATES

No -- there.

VIG

We are the Army of the United

States of America. We are here to

protect you. Remain calm.

plastic twist hand-cuffs

, as used in urban riots.

ARCHIE GATES

Orders from President Bush, step

aside.

IRAQI MOTHER

No milk. Baby milk.

ARCHIE GATES

Do not panic.  Step outside --

VIG

(into the megaphone)

We are here for your protection

and safety.

VIG

Ya'll be cool now, this is the

U.S. Marines in charge here.

TROY

Shit.

TROY

Freeze.

FRIENDLY IRAQI

I am love United States of

Freedom. I am hate Saddam.

TROY

Ya -- ya -- ha --

DOC

Let him go.

FRIENDLY IRAQI

No problem, my friend.

FRIENDLY IRAQI

You look for the chemical weapon?

TROY

No. We look for the gold.

ARCHIE GATES

Where's the gold?

FRIENDLY IRAQI

They move the gold.

DOC

Kill him.

ARCHIE GATES

Not yet.

TROY

Kill him now.

ARCHIE GATES

Where?

FRIENDLY IRAQI

(points to map)

This bunker.

I'll take you.

CHILD

Ma-Maa.

ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER

Ganan azwar!

ARCHIE GATES

Move. Out of the way.

SHIITE WOMAN

Hos-pital.

SHIITE MAN

America help.

ARCHIE GATES

Give them MRE's.

BILL SMITHSON

This is boring, I already did this

damn story, goddamn it, where the

hell is the gold?

WALTER

How about rare pelican migration

out by the marshes?

BILL SMITHSON

What?

WALTER

These brave pelicans are migrating

in spite of massive pollution --

BILL SMITHSON

Fuck that. Stop the bike.

DOC

I'm all right, I'm cool.

Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.

ARCHIE GATES

What is the art of war, because it

is not for killing people, it's a

stratagem to give life to many by

killing the evil perpetrated by a

few -- I am burning up in this

goddamn suit --

ARCHIE GATES

Discriminating use of violence as

a last resort, and even then,

carefully, surgically, that's what

I learned, that's what I'm good

at. But now they underestimate all

this, bomb the same towns for six

weeks  and still leave the scumbag

dictator to starve and butcher his

own people.

TROY

(agitated)

I don't even know what happened

back there. Civilians were

spitting on their own soldiers;

the soldiers were shooting the

civilians and ignoring

us

--

DOC

They already surrendered to us.

Now they're after Shiites.

VIG

What exactly is a Shiite?

ARCHIE GATES

They make up the ethnic majority

but they don't have any power.

When Bush pulled us out, he told

them to start a civil war to bring

Saddam down, and now they're

getting wasted.

VIG

(totally puzzled)

The civil war? How could it be the

civil war?

TROY

It's a war inside the same

country, Conrad. That's a civil

war.

ARCHIE GATES

Put these on, we are now U.S.

Marines.

TROY

I can't do this, OK? Because I've

got a family and if I shit in a

bag the rest of my life cuz I got

shot

after the war's already over

that would be pretty fucking

stupid, wouldn't it?

ARCHIE GATES

What is the most important thing

in life?

TROY

What the fuck are you talking

about?

ARCHIE GATES

What is it?

TROY

Did you hear anything I said.

VIG

Respect is the most important.

ARCHIE GATES

Too dependent on other people.

DOC

Money.

ARCHIE GATES

Comes and goes, man.

TROY

What is this bullshit?

DOC

What's the most important thing?

ARCHIE GATES

Necessity. That's what dictates

what will happen at any given time

in life. Necessity says we don't

spend American lives taking out

Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the

necessity of taking out the

Shiites so he can stay in power,

which leaves us to take the gold.

TROY

We could've been shot.

ARCHIE GATES

Did you notice they didn't touch

us?  We decimated their entire

country.

They're scared shitless

of us. [looks at his watch]

There's time to try another

bunker. I say we go.

DOC

Let's do it.

VIG

Rock and roll.

TROY

OK. And I'll be wearing

fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.

BILL SMITHSON

(on cell phone)

I'm at some goddamn marsh, all

we've seen are Russian cranes.

WALTER

Pelicans.

BILL SMITHSON

(on the cell phone)

I think the Saddam story goes more

for the jugular, journalistically

speaking, Al. Let's grow some

balls and do the Shiite uprising,

for Christ's sake.

BILL SMITHSON

We're going north to do the

Shiites.

WALTER

I thought the gold was the hot

spot.

BILL SMITHSON

Karbala's the new hotspot, and

I'm driving.

WALTER

Military regulations, you cannot

drive.

Walter

WALTER

Get off the vehicle, sir.

WALTER

Don't make me shoot you, sir.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

The M-16 is the basic weapon of

was fully automatic.

GENERAL HORN (O.S.)

Doug?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Yes, General.

GENERAL HORN

What the fuck are you doing?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Well, I'm giving an interview to

This is the United States Military.

suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.

IRAQI CAPTAIN

It's Saddam's gold.

INTERROGATOR

Shut up, he signed the treaty.

ARCHIE GATES

Listen to me: we leave you alone

to kill your Shiites, but

everything you took from Kuwait,

ARCHIE GATES

Put it back.

DOC

Why?

ARCHIE GATES

Stick to the plan. The plan is for

TROY

I told you Lexus doesn't make a

TROY

I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

DOC

OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it

won't be a convertible.

TROY

Shit.

ARCHIE GATES

They didn't get it here in these

bags.

DOC

The tensilary strength goes to 200

pounds.

TROY

The what?

DOC

Tensilary strength, it's what the

suitcase can hold.

ARCHIE GATES

Why would you know that?

TROY

He works at an airport.

DOC

60 bars, 13 pounds each is like --

800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons

handle 65.

ARCHIE GATES

You got any more luggage here?

ARCHIE GATES

It's crazy to take it all, we're

not prepared for it. It's crazy

not to take it all, how can we

leave it?

TROY

What's the shipping plan?

ARCHIE GATES

I told you that's handled.

TROY

How is it handled? You have to

tell us now.

DOC

Yeah, tell us now.

ARCHIE GATES

(pacing)

I've got a friend, he's in French

Special Forces. He's gonna put it

in barrels filled with oil and

bury it. In a few weeks, he'll

drive it to Yanbu --

TROY

Where's Yanbu?

ARCHIE GATES

It's a port in Saudi.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

Where another friend will ship it

on a Turkish boat up the Red Sea

to Perpignan, where a French boat

will take it to Baltimore --

TROY

I don't know about getting them to

Baltimore, but these hat boxes

ain't gonna fit in the Humvee.

ARCHIE GATES

We need a trailer.

TROY

OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to

see what they have on the lot

today.

ARCHIE GATES

See what you can get, Barlow.

TROY

Conrad, we need a trailer --

VIG

Did you get it? Troy, did you get

TROY

Yeah, we got it.

VIG

Is it a lot?

Yeah, it's a lot.

Thunderbird like it's standin'

TROY

'She'll do a hundred and forty

TROY

'She's my little deuce coupe --'

The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they

embrace.

Then the Major salutes Archie.

IRAQI MAJOR

You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?

ARCHIE GATES

We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.

IRAQI MAJOR

Saddam cannot keep.

ARCHIE GATES

No, Saddam cannot keep.

IRAQI MAJOR

Saddam have too many problem today.

ARCHIE GATES

He certainly does.

IRAQI MAJOR

You need help to load?

ARCHIE GATES

We can do it ourselves.

IRAQI MAJOR

Hazal jarat finan.

IRAQI MAJOR

These man help you.

INTERROGATOR

You go away fast from this

bullshit.

ARCHIE GATES

Let's load up and get out of here.

TROY

Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --

ARCHIE GATES

This isn't gonna work.

TROY

Sure it is --

IRAQI MAJOR

You need a truck.

ARCHIE GATES

We'll rig two carts.

TROY

Let's take the truck.

ARCHIE GATES

We're not taking their truck.

TROY

Why not?

IRAQI MAJOR

We cooperate with peace accord.

Please take truck.

TROY

Let's take the truck.

IRAQI MAJOR

Nazaran yafit haisul.

Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of

soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been

raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in

an open area and shoot her dead.

Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks

slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.

ARCHIE GATES

This has to stop.

INTERROGATOR

You get your ass kick in a war, it

feel good to be strong again.

ARCHIE GATES

What did you say?

IRAQI MAJOR

You go now, please.

ARCHIE GATES

I don't think so. I'm sure you

know about the Geneva Convention,

right?

INTERROGATOR

Geneva convention? You bomb my

house, man.

IRAQI MAJOR

That Shiite man is leader of

uprising. He kill my man.

TROY

Archie, let's stick to the plan,

sir. The plan is for gold, right?

DOC

We can help them first, then be on

our way.

TROY

No, we can't. It's not what we're

here for.

ARCHIE GATES

How much?

IRAQI MAJOR

What?

ARCHIE GATES

How much gold do you want to let

these people come with us?

INTERROGATOR

Cannot do.

ARCHIE GATES

What do you mean, cannot do? I'm

offering you a lot of money.

IRAQI MAJOR

Cannot let Shiite go --

INTERROGATOR

Saddam kill us.

IRAQI MAJOR

Saddam kill to me if we let them

go, OK? Now you go.

ARCHIE GATES

Cover me.

TROY

Jesus Christ, we can't save

everybody.

ARCHIE GATES

Are you listening? I said cover me.

and they nervously point

their pistols.

Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come

ARCHIE GATES

No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is

that clear?

VIG

Yes, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

Because we know what bullets do to

vital organs, don't we?

VIG

Make infected pockets filled with

bile, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

That's right, that's what they do.

IRAQI MAJOR

(pissed)

U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.

ARCHIE GATES

No shooting.

TROY

What's happening?

ARCHIE GATES

Accident. Stay cool.

TROY

No.

The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;

the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.

ARCHIE GATES

Cover these three.

ARCHIE GATES

Doc.

DOC

Down.

IRAQI SOLDIER

Kazal stan hamir in fatar.

ARCHIE GATES

Put the Shiites in the Humvee.

TROY

There's no room.

ARCHIE GATES

Make room.

TROY

What the fuck happened to

necessity?

ARCHIE GATES

It just changed.

TROY

Not for me.

ARCHIE GATES

Obey the fucking order, Barlow.

TROY

This is fucked up.

DOC

What if that was you?

TROY

What if this was you not wearing

Kevlar?

TROY

Great, a fucking tank. That should

send us on our way.

VIG

Grenade launcher, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

No. Let's get out of here.

TROY

It's about fucking time.

TANK IRAQI

Hazal mafan.

TROY

We were home free, you stupid son

of a bitch.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

What's the tank doing?

DOC (O.S.)

Lining us up --

DOC (O.S.)

Incoming.

ARCHIE GATES

Stay on the road.

VIG

I don't wanna get hit.

DOC

Gas.

VIG

Where's my mask?

ARCHIE GATES

Mine.

Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he

gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.

Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.

Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and

gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.

DOC

Cover your face, Conrad. Cover

your mouth, man.

TROY

Hey. Stop.

TROY

Goddamn it.

ARCHIE GATES

Don't do it, this isn't sarin.

We'd be dead by now.

DOC

Is it mustard?

ARCHIE GATES

It's C.S.

DOC

What's that?

ARCHIE GATES

Tear gas times ten, but it's not

lethal. Where's Barlow?

DOC

I don't know.

ARCHIE GATES

Does anybody see Barlow?

DOC

I can't even see the truck.

VIG

Look out.

ARCHIE GATES

Don't move.

VIG

What's going on?

DOC

Get in the tunnel.

VIG

Troy.

DOC

You're gonna die.

ARCHIE GATES

Barlow.

VIG

We have to go back. We can't leave

him there.

ARCHIE GATES

We have to wait until it clears.

VIG

You made the choice and we lost

Troy --

ARCHIE GATES

I had no choice.

VIG

You had a choice.

ARCHIE GATES

I had no fucking choice.

ARCHIE GATES

I can't walk away from a crime

like that and take the gold and

live my life like nothing

happened, and if you can, then I

hope you die right now.

VIG

What about Troy? What choice does

he have now?

IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES)

Can we shoot him?

IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES)

We're not even supposed to have

American prisoners.

INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES)

He's proof they broke the cease-

fire.

INTERROGATOR

They're taking the tank.

BILL SMITHSON

Start shooting, Paco.

WALTER

I don't like this, we gotta go--

WALTER

Hey.

BILL SMITHSON

Let me handle this.

IRAQI SOLDIER

Get dress.

TROY

OK.

IRAQI SOLDIER

Get dress.

TROY

I said OK.

OPERATOR (O.S.)

What number, please.

TROY

OPERATOR (O.S.)

I'm sorry?

TROY

The big army in the desert, come

OPERATOR (O.S.)

I don't have that number.

TROY

Maybe you could -- hello?

TROY

Fuck.

TROY

Come on, come on, come on.

DARLENE

(Southern accent)

Hello?

TROY

Honey, it's me.

DARLENE

Troy?

TROY

It's me, honey.

DARLENE

My God, the baby's crying.

TROY

I can hear her.

DARLENE

That's our little Krystal.

TROY

How's she doing?

DARLENE

She hasn't been sleeping good, and

Mamma had to go back to work, so

I'm real, real tired, baby.

TROY

I wish I was there to help, gooney-

bird.

DARLENE

Oh, gooney-bird, when are you

coming home?

TROY

I'm working on that right now,

baby.

DARLENE

I saw an ad for a computer job.

You want me to call and set up an

interview for my war hero?

TROY

Listen, honey --

DARLENE

What date are you coming home?

TROY

They haven't given us an exact

date yet. Listen --

DARLENE

I'm henpecking you.

TROY

No, you're not.

DARLENE

I'm lonely and tired and most of

all, I miss you.

TROY

I miss you, too.

DARLENE

What was that?

TROY

The wall just exploded.

DARLENE

I thought the war was over, honey.

TROY

It is and it isn't, babe. Can you

do me a favor and call the C.O. on

base?

DARLENE

You want me to call the C.O.?

TROY

Tell him I'm stuck in a bunker

near 223 north outside Karbala --

DARLENE

What do you mean 'stuck'? I

thought the war was over.

TROY

I'm gonna be fine, honey, I don't

want you to worry, I tried to do

something for the family,  and I

want you to know --

DARLENE

Know what?

TROY

That I love you.

DARLENE

What's happening, Troy?

TROY

Tell Krystal --

DARLENE

Troy?

TROY

Tell Krystal I'm a rich man and if

things work out she'll be taken

care of no matter what --

DARLENE

What are you talking about?

TROY

Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you--

DARLENE

Troy?

BILL SMITHSON

Spirits are high and the music is

soaring as these young troops

celebrate --

BILL SMITHSON

I'm being held captive by Iraqi

troops in the gritty city of

Karbala, where Shiite --

PACO

You said gritty city again.

BILL SMITHSON

OK, we'll go again.

PACO

What about Private Wogoman, Bill?

BILL SMITHSON

Let's lay a few of these down

first. In three, two, and, I'm

being held captive in a gritty

suburb of Karbala, where Shiite

fundamentalists are rising up --

IRAQI CAPTAIN

You better not let that fucking

reporter see you doing this.

IRAQI SARGEANT

Hey, that's the CNN guy.

IRAQI CAPTAIN

Wow. He's much shorter in person.

IRAQI CAPTAIN

Get them out of here

BILL SMITHSON

At least let me keep the tape.

WALTER

Could I have my helmet, please?

WALTER

Helmet. On my head.

GENERAL HORN

Who's missing?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Is Doc here?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Doc's not here?

GENERAL HORN

You don't know where one of your

own fucking aides is?

CAPTAIN VAN METER

How about Barlow?

GENERAL HORN

Check all the radio transmissions.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

I run a tight company, Ron. Don't

break my bails.

GENERAL HORN

I'm not breaking your balls, Doug,

I want to find these guys.

INTERROGATOR

What is your rank, bro?

TROY

INTERROGATOR

Your company?

TROY

B Company, infantry, United States

Army.

INTERROGATOR

My main man. Tell me something,

OK? What is problem with Michael

Jackson?

TROY

What do you mean?

INTERROGATOR

The King of Pop. 'I'm bad, I'm

bad, you know it --'

TROY

Yeah, Michael Jackson.

INTERROGATOR

He is fahking the small boys, man.

TROY

What are you talking about?

INTERROGATOR

He come to Egypt with the small

boys. I see picture in newspaper,

always he is with the small boys

in the hotel window. Hello with

the white glove. I am King of Pop

in my hotel with the small boys.

No girls. Just the boys.

TROY

He likes kids.

INTERROGATOR

Yeah, he like to fahk them up the

ass.

TROY

Bullshit.

INTERROGATOR

You are the blind bullshit, my

main man.  It is so obvious he

like the small boy so he all the

time travel with them.

TROY

Fine.

INTERROGATOR

And if it really true? You say --

TROY

I say it's sick.

INTERROGATOR

That's because you got a sick

country, bro, you got no respect

for the children. That's why you

bomb them over here, right?

TROY

I don't think so.

INTERROGATOR

Michael Jackson is Pop King of

sick fahking country.

TROY

Wrong.

INTERROGATOR

Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man

make the skin white and the hair

straight. You know why?

TROY

No.

INTERROGATOR

Your sick fahking country make the

black man hate hisself, just like

you hate the Arab and the children

you bomb.

TROY

I don't hate children.

INTERROGATOR

Do they care, buddy?

TROY

Does who care?

INTERROGATOR

Do your army care about the Shiite

children? Do they come to help?

TROY

No, they're not coming.

INTERROGATOR

(in subtitles)

That seemed like too much volts.

You got to build it up slow.

INTERROGATOR

Just figure it out.

INTERROGATOR

Are they coming to help the Shiite?

TROY

No.

INTERROGATOR

Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us

the big bummer.

INTERROGATOR

Does it hurt?

INTERROGATOR

I ask you question, bro.

TROY

Yes, it hurts.

INTERROGATOR

You bomb my family. Do you know

INTERROGATOR

You blow up my home. The whole

street. My wife is crush by big

fahking block of concrete. She

TROY

That's horrible.

INTERROGATOR

I said, that's horrible.

INTERROGATOR

Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even

INTERROGATOR

TROY (OS)

Ten days old.

INTERROGATOR (OS)

What's her name?

TROY

INTERROGATOR

What makes you decide to tell me

TROY

Because we're both fathers.

INTERROGATOR

I'm not a father no more, dude,

remember? My son is dead now.

DOC

I'm OK. I'm cool. I'm a survivor.

VIG

Is that guy dead? Where you gonna

put him?

SHIITE CLERIC

A shrine.

VIG

What kind of shrine ya'll got?

SHIITE CLERIC

Shrine that wash 700 year of sin.

VIG

Hey, that's a pretty good shrine,

right, Doc?

VIG

I'm sorry I hit you, man. I was

scared for Troy, I don't want

nothing to happen to him, he's my

friend. Doc? Come on, man, I know

you was comin' to help me --

VIG

Maybe we got kicked out of the

ring of Jesus fire, on account of

stealing.

DOC

That's not how it works.

VIG

How does it work?

DOC

I take care of what Jesus puts in

front of me. That's what we did

with the gold.

VIG

What about now?

DOC

I'm gonna see.

ARCHIE GATES

How you doing, Conrad?

VIG

I'm good to go, chief.

ARCHIE GATES

Let's check the suitcases.

DOC

We're missing 28.

ARCHIE GATES

That leaves 92 suitcases, five

bars each --

ARCHIE GATES

23 million dollars. Not bad for a

disaster, provided we can find

Barlow, get back before dark and

not get busted.

ARCHIE GATES

It was my choice today. So you can

head back if you want. I'll find

Barlow myself.

DOC

What about the gold?

ARCHIE GATES

Take what you can carry. Try to

find a vehicle. Bury what you have

outside camp. Be careful about it.

VIG

I want to find Troy.

DOC

I'm in.

ARCHIE GATES

OK, where does that leave us? We

don't have any water, we're

dehydrated. You got a radio here?

ARCHIE GATES

How is she?

DOC

How -- is -- your -- little

girl?

VIG

Broken -- arms. Girl.

MAN IN GLASSES

She's traumatized, what the fuck

do you expect?

MAN IN GLASSES

I went to b-school at Bowling

Green.

VIG

What's b-school? Is that like

terrorist training?

DOC

Business

school, Conrad.

MAN IN GLASSES

I came back to open a couple of

hotels near Karbala. I'm almost in

the black when Saddam starts this

stupid fucking war and you guys

bomb the shit out of my cafes. Now

we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush

leaves us twisting in the wind, Un-

be-fucking-lievable man.

ARCHIE GATES

You got a radio?

MAN IN GLASSES

No radio. No water.

ARCHIE GATES

Where's Barlow?

MAN IN GLASSES

They got him, I saw it happen. And

they won't take him back to the

same place.

ARCHIE GATES

Where would they take him?

MAN IN GLASSES

Oasis Bunker. It's full of

Saddam's hard core guys.

DOC

Where's that?

MAN IN GLASSES

Like 17 - 18 klicks from here.

ARCHIE GATES

Take us there.

MAN IN GLASSES

We got no wheels.

ARCHIE GATES

We'll walk until we find some.

MAN IN GLASSES

Why don't you call in the Marines?

ARCHIE GATES

With what? We don't have a radio.

MAN IN GLASSES

OK, we'll find a vehicle. You

drive back to get the choppers,

they fly in to get your man.

ARCHIE GATES

We can't do that.

MAN IN GLASSES

Why not? You got a huge army here.

ARCHIE GATES

We're not supposed to be involved

with Shiites. We killed Iraqi

soldiers. We broke the peace-

accord.

MAN IN GLASSES

Tell them it happened when you

reclaimed the gold. Don't tell

them it was about us.

ARCHIE GATES

They'd find out, we'd go to jail.

MAN IN GLASSES

You know what I think? I think

maybe you're boosting the gold.

That's what I think.

ARCHIE GATES

You're wrong.

MAN IN GLASSES

They got half a million men in the

desert, they send four guys to

pick up all this bullion? I don't

think so.

ARCHIE GATES

We need to find our man. How much

do you want to take us there?

MAN IN GLASSES

Fifteen suitcases.

ARCHIE GATES

That's too much.

VIG

Give it to him. We've got a lot.

ARCHIE GATES

We're gonna need it to buy our way

back today, so we better spend it

wisely. I'll give you eight.

MAN IN GLASSES

You need some guns, right? You

lost your gear.

ARCHIE GATES

Yeah, we need some guns.

MAN IN GLASSES

You need some fighters, too. I

mean, you can try to take Oasis on

your own, but look at these

grunts --

ARCHIE GATES

Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.

MAN IN GLASSES

So that's worth more than eight

suitcases.

ARCHIE GATES

Ten.

MAN IN GLASSES

Fifteen.

ARCHIE GATES

That's four million dollars.

MAN IN GLASSES

I think we need it more than you,

John Doe, don't you?

ARCHIE GATES

Archie Gates.

IMAM (MAN IN GLASSES)

Imam Katar. I'll give you back

five suitcases to get us over the

Iranian border.

ARCHIE GATES

What?

IMAM

We gotta get to a refugee camp or

we're dead. The camps are in Iran.

DOC

We can't go to the Iranian border.

IMAM

Then we don't have a deal.

VIG

Give me a fucking break, man.

DOC

We saved your life.

IMAM

And we saved yours.

ARCHIE GATES

We lost a man for you.

IMAM

What good is it if you leave us to

get wasted? The big army of

democracy beats the ugly dictator,

saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you

go to jail if you help us escape

the same dictator.  You saw what

happened to my wife. Look at my

daughter.

ARCHIE GATES

Who's going?

IMAM

Everyone but the priests. That's

55.

VIG

Fuck it. We'll find this place on

our own.

IMAM

It's not on a map. You can look.

DOC

Somebody else will take us.

DOC

Who will take us to Oasis bunker?

IMAM

Jarat yalam fantam uraz.

IMAM

I don't think so.

VIG

This is a human life we're talking

about.

IMAM

(laughs)

Tell me about it.

INTERROGATOR

I only join Saddam Hussein army to

make good living for family, good

car, good house, and now my son is

dead.

TROY

I signed up for the extra cash,

too.

INTERROGATOR

We got a lot in common, dude. I

got training and guns from America.

TROY

Not from America.

INTERROGATOR

Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to

Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.

TROY

What did they train you in?

INTERROGATOR

Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.

TROY

Great.

INTERROGATOR (O.S.)

So what we get from this dirty

Iraq war you and me, huh?

TROY

(whispers)

I don't know.

INTERROGATOR

(laughs)

You don't fahking know, right?! We

all scahmbag soldier who get

fahked, right?

TROY

Right.

TROY

So why are you doing this to me?

INTERROGATOR

It's my job, man, for Saddam, just

like your job when you bomb my

house.

TROY

It's not just a job, it still

matters what you do.

INTERROGATOR

Bullshit. It's all a job.

TROY

It still matters what you do, what

you're doing right now matters.

INTERROGATOR

Bullshit.

TROY

The art of war is not for killing

people, it's a stratagem to give

life to many with minimum

violence, minimum --

INTERROGATOR

Then why you bomb my fahking house

and kill my son? Can you think how

it feels inside your heart if I

bomb your daughter?

TROY

Worse than death --

INTERROGATOR

It feels like this --

TROY

Don't --

INTERROGATOR

Everyday, inside my heart --

INTERROGATOR

Like this, like this, like this --

ARCHIE GATES

Did we save anything from the

Humvee?

This bag.

VIG

You got the same name as the tall

model who does David Bowie.

DOC

That's Im-

Imam with an 'm.'

VIG

That's the same name.

DOC

It's not the same name.

VIG

Whatever. They're both attractive

names.

ARCHIE GATES

This is the United States Army.

Come out of the truck with your

weapons in the air.

VIG

Shit. Sorry.

ARCHIE GATES

They used a lot of decoys to throw

off our bombers.

DOC

Where are we gonna get a vehicle?

IMAM

I know a place that's full of

deserters. Maybe they got

something.

SHIITE

The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie.

ARCHIE GATES

We don't have any food.

Where'd you get these animals from?

ARCHIE GATES

We need water.

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

Water all gone. No one have water.

ARCHIE GATES

No radio, no water, but yes CNN.

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

ARCHIE GATES

Not exactly.

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

Congratulation!

ARCHIE GATES

Would you explain to these

gentlemen that we need a vehicle

of some kind?

Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement

: It's an underground

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

From Kuwait.

DOC

Could I ask a question?

DOC

Does Lexus make this model?

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

No. Infiniti convertible only.

FRIENDLY IRAQI 2

No Lexus convertible.

DOC

Exactly what I said.

ARCHIE GATES

Listen. We use these cars to go

fight Saddam soldiers.

DOC

What's so funny?

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

Cannot take.

DOC

What do you mean, cannot take? We

kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely

take.

ARCHIE GATES

We are the United States military.

IMAM

You're three guys with a bunch of

Shiites and no Humvee.

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER

Need money. Have no money. To eat.

To live. Kish falan azar yat imal

tanat.

IMAM

He says the Americans have many

tanks, many airplanes. We have

nothing.

ARCHIE GATES

We will rise up together.

IMAM

Jihala vamat.

ARCHIE GATES

Rise up together.

ARCHIE GATES

Look at us. Working together. Many

races, many nations. Tell him, Doc.

Jahal yaqat, brothers.

ARCHIE GATES

God bless America, and God bless

a free Iraq.

Iraqis burst into cheers.

ARCHIE GATES

What do you say now, my friend?

FRIENDLY IRAQI

Cannot give car.

ARCHIE GATES

Then I guess we'll have to buy

them.

VIG

Judas Priest will pump you, Doc --

DOC

I already had it with the Beach

Boys today.

VIG

One song.

The bags are buried. Archie drives a stake to mark the spot.

ARCHIE GATES

We get our man, we come back to

pick up the gold --

IMAM

And my people.

ARCHIE GATES

My gold isn't here, and I mean all

of it, your people will not

survive.

IMAM

I understand.

ARCHIE GATES

OK. Let's load and go.

VIG

Wait a second, I want to talk

about this plan some more --

ARCHIE GATES

We're going to drive in and get

Troy, exactly like we discussed.

VIG

I have a bad feeling like we're

gonna get wasted.

ARCHIE GATES

You're scared. It's good to be

scared when there's guns around.

DOC

I'm cool. I'm all right.

as Archie

and Vig keep singing.

TROY

Your son wouldn't be dead if

Saddam didn't invade Kuwait.

INTERROGATOR (O.S.)

I know.

TROY (O.S.)

I heard about some bad shit that

happened there.

TROY

Who's got the sick country?

INTERROGATOR

Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right?

And then you are crazy to bomb all

of Iraq.

TROY

Too much bombing is crazy, but not

saving Kuwait.

INTERROGATOR

You come here to save Kuwait

people?

TROY

Yes.

INTERROGATOR

Really?

(to the Second Iraqi)

Jahaza fan.

INTERROGATOR

Lots of people in trouble around

this world, my man. You don't

fight no fahking war for them.

TROY

You invaded another country. You

can't do that.

INTERROGATOR

Why not, dude?

TROY

It makes the world crazy. You got

to keep it stable.

INTERROGATOR

For what? Your pick up truck?

TROY

No, for stability. Stabilize the

region.

INTERROGATOR

This is your fahking stability, my

main man.

Splinter.

Shit.

Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,

INTERROGATOR

It's OK, buddy, we are just

talking now --

ARCHIE GATES

Let's go.

ARCHIE GATES

Come on.

VIG

You gotta be my disguise, Mr.

Shiite, cuz they need my help over

there --

TOUGH IRAQI

Let's go back and get them.

IRAQI #2

Fuck a donkey, no way.

TOUGH IRAQI

There's a chopper, we can do it.

TOUGH IRAQI

They killed your families, you

fucking cowards.

ARCHIE GATES

We're gonna get out of here alive,

just do what I say, do you hear me?

ARCHIE GATES

Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna

give it a five second fuse. That

gives you two steps out the door.

ARCHIE GATES

Wait --

VIG

God help me.

ARCHIE GATES

Go.

ARCHIE GATES

OK.  Shorter fuse this time.

ARCHIE GATES

We're not done. Check every Iraqi

here.

TROY

Where's Conrad?

ARCHIE GATES

Don't let your guard down.

ARCHIE GATES

Stay there, don't move.

IMAM

Jakar yizam ut naral --

TROY

How are we getting back?

DOC

We got the Rolls.

TROY

You got a Rolls?

ARCHIE GATES

It's been a busy day.

TROY

Hey. That's a convertible.

ARCHIE GATES

Keep your fucking guard up.

TROY

Is that leather interior?

DOC

I think he's in shock.

TROY

It's a fucking Infiniti

convertible, isn't it?

DOC

Yes.

TROY

OK. So I owe you a car. I'm not in

shock.

ARCHIE GATES

We can talk about cars later, OK?

TROY

Freeze --

IMAM

Take it easy.

TROY

Who is this guy?

ARCHIE GATES

He's with us.

TROY

You're the guy with the little

girl.

IMAM

That's right.

TROY

What are you doing here?

ARCHIE GATES

He helped us find you.

TROY

All right. You're all right.

TROY

How's your girl?

IMAM

She's safe. For the moment.

TROY

All right. Excellent. How can we

help?

DOC

Calm down, man.

TROY

I'm calm. Don't I look calm?

IMAM

We had a deal to get us to the

border, but we need more vehicles

for these people.

TROY

We're gonna work it out. We can do

it. We have to work it out.

DOC

I'm not sure how. This is a lot of

people.

TROY

OK, you choose who we take. You

tell the others it's not

convenient, they'll have to die.

DOC

Take it easy, man.

TROY

You think I don't know what I'm

saying. I know what I'm saying.

We're gonna do more than steal,

that's what I'm saying. We're

gonna help these people out.

IMAM

This guy was worth saving.

ARCHIE GATES

He's a soldier.

VIG (O.S.)

Yes. Yes. All right.

VIG

You made it.

VIG

I thought that was you. Yeah.

ARCHIE GATES

Cover him.

ARCHIE GATES

Lock it down. Shoot anything that

moves.

IMAM

(translates)

Haza janav yasat.

VIG

You made it, man --

TROY

Help him.

VIG

What happened to the Jesus fire,

Doc?

DOC

It's around you right now, man, it

works on this side or the other

side.

VIG

You never told me that part. I

guess I could go to one of them

shrines that erase the bad you

did --

TROY

We made the right choice today,

Conrad.

VIG

We did good, right?

TROY

We made the right choice.

DOC

Dear Lord watch over this man,

help him if you can. Our father

who art in heaven --

Troy stands up looking around helplessly.

TROY

Help.

DOC

-- hallowed be thy name, thy

kingdom come, thy will be done --

A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy

in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches

over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the

sound of tearing tissue.

Troy looks stunned as he is spun

Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy.

ARCHIE GATES

Goddamn it.

SOLDIER #5

Take my picture.

VIG

Do you still want to sell pictures?

TROY

(distracted monotone)

For twenty.

SOLDIER #5

Twenty bucks?

VIG

War's been over five days, ain't

gonna be any more of this, Jim.

SOLDIER #5

Twenty dollars, man, what's the

meaning of life?

TROY

You're lucky you got to see

anybody shot in this war.

SOLDIER #5

Bobby, take my picture.

SOLDIER #4

If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

SOLDIER #5

It's not like he shot a fucking

deer. It's the enemy.

VIG

It's Troy's enemy, yours for

twenty.

Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny

metal scalpel down.

Troy is in great pain as he watches

ARCHIE GATES

I've been waiting 18 years to get

that right.

TROY

He's got no family.

Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.

ARCHIE GATES

We're his family now.

DOC

He wanted to go to one of those

shrines.

IMAM

Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.

ARCHIE GATES

Good. Take him.

Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and

tapes it shut.

Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks

ARCHIE GATES

Air pressure will build up about

every fifteen minutes. Release the

valve, close it up again.

TROY

How long can I keep doing this?

ARCHIE GATES

Maybe four hours, if you're not

bleeding too bad inside.

TROY

I'm really thirsty.

DOC

There's no water anywhere.

IMAM

(to Archie)

I got you hooked up if you want to

call your man.

ARCHIE GATES

(into the radio)

Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do

you read me?

DOC

We're gonna be court-martialed.

ARCHIE GATES

No, we're not.

ARCHIE GATES

(into the radio)

Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are

you reading this?

WALTER

(into radio)

This is Tar Baby, come in.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

Where are you?

WALTER

(into radio)

About two clicks outside camp.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

We're about ready for the briar

patch, over.

WALTER

(into the radio)

Right.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

You got me, Tar Baby?

WALTER

I think so -- who handles the

briar patch?

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

You do.

WALTER

Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to

the briar patch if everything's

OK, right?

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)

No, the other way around.

WALTER

Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't

remember how the code goes --

ARCHIE GATES

Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.

WALTER

Wow. That's a tall order for a

secret operation, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

Talk to my friend Hash. Each

driver will get 100K.

WALTER

Did you say 100K?

ARCHIE GATES

Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North.

Add one medavac pack to the order,

and dump the reporter.

WALTER

Roger. Give me two hours.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

There's so many transmissions --

GENERAL HORN

Narrow it down to what sounds like

Archie Gates and a Humvee.

GENERAL HORN

I want a direction, we're not

gonna comb the whole goddamn

desert --

PRIVATE

This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort

Bragg, something with his wife.

GENERAL HORN

(reads)

Fort Bragg? I'll be damned.

BILL SMITHSON

Where the hell is he going now?

CATHY DAITCH

I say we keep watching the General.

HAVICHON

Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got

yourself shot.

ARCHIE GATES

Those better be words of sympathy.

WALTER

Watcha doing out here, Troy?

TROY

Protecting the free peoples of the

world, Walter, you know how it is.

WALTER

We better get you fixed up to go

home to the land of the brave.

TROY

Give me that penicillin, baby.

HAVICHON

Where ees bullion at, my man?

ARCHIE GATES

Bullion ees buried. I'll show you

after we get these people to the

border.

HAVICHON

Iranian border?

ARCHIE GATES

Part of the deal.

HAVICHON

C'est super, Archie, you got

yourself a pain in the ass mission

of mercy.

WALTER

Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.

ARCHIE GATES

It means we gotta move. They might

be coming for us.

HAVICHON

What are you seenking?

ARCHIE GATES

I see an opening we can walk

through. But it's not wide enough

for a truck.

ARCHIE GATES

We'll walk them to the border. The

Iranians will take them. We'll

walk back to the trucks and get

out of here.

ARCHIE GATES

Make a close group.

IMAM

(translates)

Jihad yamat -- yamat.

DOC

Let the air out.

TROY

It's not the air, I don't know

what it is --

DOC

Stay back.

TROY

I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or

something --

ARCHIE GATES

Double time.

TROY

Wait.

ARCHIE GATES

Let them get over the border.

TROY

Let them get over, wait --

Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.

TROY

I have to reach this --

ARCHIE GATES

Put his cuffs in front.

TROY

Look what's happening.

CAPTAIN VAN METER

Not our mission, Barlow.

TROY

Cut my cuffs --

CAPTAIN VAN METER

You fucked me and you're fucked

now, so shut your goddamn mouth.

Shiites are lined up in a firing squad.

DOC

He's gonna die.

ARCHIE GATES

Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical

attention, don't let him die --

GENERAL HORN

We are not involved in the Shiite

problem, do you understand

me? You are AWOL, you are a

fugitive, you are under arrest.

ARCHIE GATES

Cut his cuffs.

Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border.

Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's

body is dropped in the sand.

ARCHIE GATES

We got the gold.

GENERAL HORN

What?

ARCHIE GATES

We got the Kuwaiti bullion.

GENERAL HORN

Bullshit.

ARCHIE GATES

Pull that barrel.

GENERAL HORN

Pull it.

GENERAL HORN

How much do you have?

ARCHIE GATES

4 tons.

GENERAL HORN

Where's it at?

TROY

Get them over first.

ARCHIE GATES

They helped us get it, Ron. I made

a deal, and that's soldier's

honor. You can't fuck them now.

ARCHIE GATES

You can return this gold, be a big

hero, get another star maybe.

Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the

Shiites.

GENERAL HORN

Let's go, Doug.

GENERAL HORN

Who's in charge here?

GENERAL HORN

We have to talk about this

situation.

BILL SMITHSON

In a morbid tableau these men have

recovered some of the gold bullion

stolen from Kuwait --

CATHY DAITCH

--in violation of American policy,

saved over a hundred Shiite

refugees while recovering stolen

Kuwaiti gold --

GENERAL HORN

Turn that damn camera off.

BILL SMITHSON

That's a 75 thousand dollar

camera --

GENERAL HORN

What the fuck are they doing here?

SARGEANT

I thought they were authorized --

GENERAL HORN

They are not fucking authorized,

for Christ's sake --

GENERAL HORN

Haven't I taken care of you,

dammit?

CATHY DAITCH

I'm gonna get that tape back.

GENERAL HORN

You are under arrest. You are

going to be court-martialed. And
