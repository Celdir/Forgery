Act I

DRUID

Is it a girl?

ETHNA

It is a girl.

DRUID

Show me its arm.

DRUID

It's true then.  I must tell Queen

Bavmorda.

MOTHER

Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're

going to kill my baby.

ETHNA

They'll kill you.

MOTHER

Please save my baby.

ETHNA

Pretend this is the child.

MOTHER

Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

BAVMORDA

We will start the ritual at dusk.

You're certain this is the one?

DRUID

It bears the markings.

BAVMORDA

I must see for myself!  Just as the

omen foretold!

BAVMORDA

So.  You *were* the one.

MOTHER

Yes.  But nothing you can do will

stop the prophecy.

BAVMORDA

This child will have no power over

me....

BAVMORDA

(furiously)

Where's the baby!

GUARD

The midwife!

BAVMORDA

Find that baby!  Use the dogs!

Sorsha!

BAVMORDA

Kill her.

DEATH DOG

Bordak!

MIDWIFE

I don't have her!  No!  No!

RANON

Dada!  We found something in the

river!

WILLOW

I can't run off and play with you

now.  I've got work to do.

RANON/MIMS

But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

WILLOW

Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't

know where it's been.  It could be

diseased.

MIMS

It's a baby!

RANON

It's not a Nelwyn baby.

WILLOW

No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn

baby.  It looks like a daikini...

MIMS

Ooh, it's so cute...

WILLOW

Mims!  Get back here!  It might

bite you.

RANON

Can't we keep it, Dada?

WILLOW

Absolutely not.

BURGLEKUTT

Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

WILLOW

Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --

that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,

keep this thing hidden...

KIAYA

Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done

anything wrong!

BURGLEKUTT

Ufgood!  What do you think you're

doing!  I tell the planting seeds

in this village.

KIAYA

I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-

low.

BURGLEKUTT

You haven't paid your debts.  Where

did you get these seeds?

WILLOW

In the forest.  My family's been

gathering them since last fall.

There's no law against that, Bur-

glekutt.

KIAYA

Willow!  You left the children

alone by the river??

BURGLEKUTT

Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get

your planting done before the rains

start.  You're gonna lose this

land.

WILLOW

Absolutely, under no condition, is

anyone in this family going to fall

in love with that baby.

WILLOW

Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.

Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be

ignored!

WILLOW

This is bad.  If we're caught with

that little daikini it'll be the

end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need

that for the festival.

(indicates magic cloth)

Kiaya, what are we going to do?

KIAYA

We're gonna give this baby a bath.

WILLOW

Burglekutt's right.  There's not

enough time to finish plowing.

We'll lose everything and I'll end

up working in the mines.

KIAYA

Willow, do you think we should take

her to the Village Council?

WILLOW

No, no!  They'll think it's a bad

omen.  There'll be a flood or a

drought or a plague and

everybody'll blame me for it!

RANON

Look.  What's that?

WILLOW

I don't know.  This is trouble.

I'll talk to the High Aldwin about

it tomorrow at the Festival.

WILLOW

And now!  For our final amazing bit

of magic, I will make an entire pig

completely disappear!

CROWD

Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

WILLOW

Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

MEEGOSH

Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need

a better pig, that's all.

MEEGOSH

Now Burglekutt's got you in the

squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in

the mines like me.

WILLOW

Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.

That's the last thing I'd ever do.

(he shudders)

I gotta get my crop planted.

MEEGOSH

You know I'll help you as much as I

can, Willow.

MIMS

Dada, can we get treacle candy?

Can we, can we?  Please?

WILLOW

(preoccupied)

Meegosh, can you watch the chil-

dren?  I gotta talk to the High

Aldwin.

MEEGOSH

(truly amazed)

The High Aldwin??  Why?

WILLOW

Sir!  I have to talk to you.

HIGH ALDWIN

Not today, Willow.

WILLOW

It's a matter of great importance

to me!

HIGH ALDWIN

Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I

know you're eager to be my appren-

tice, Willow.  But today is the

spring festival.

BURGLEKUTT

Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!

Willow Ufgood???

DEATH DOG

Bordak!  Bordak!

MEEGOSH

What was it looking for?

A VILLAGER

It said "bordak"!  What does it

mean?

COUNCILMAN

(scholarly)

Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-

ing for somebody's baby!

MIMS

Mommy?

WILLOW

Kiaya!  Kiaya!

WILLOW

We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We

must take her to the Council.

BURGLEKUTT

An evil beast from the outer world

has invaded our peaceful village,

looking for a baby!

A VILLAGER

It's a sign!  An omen!

ANOTHER VILLAGER

Our crops will die!

BURGLEKUTT

Silence!  One beast we can kill.

But there may be more!  And they

won't give up their search till

they've found what they're looking

for!

MEEGOSH

Whose baby is it!

OTHER VILLAGERS

Who's to blame for this!

HIGH ALDWIN

Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

HIGH ALDWIN

Earlier today you tried to tell me

something, Willow.

WILLOW

(bows his head)

My family found this baby in the

river, High Aldwin.

HIGH ALDWIN

A daikini child...

(his eyes close)

...of some importance, I feel...

BURGLEKUTT

That's what the beasts want!  Give

it back!

WILLOW

They'll kill her!  We can't let

this baby die!

BURGLEKUTT

What do we care!

HIGH ALDWIN

...importance...yes...this child

is special...

COUNCILMAN

What should we do?

HIGH ALDWIN

This child must be taken beyond the

boundaries of our village.  All the

way to the daikini crossroads.

A VILLAGER

Who will do that?

SEVERAL VILLAGERS

Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

HIGH ALDWIN

The outer world is dangerous and

corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is

hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are

you willing to sacrifice your life?

VOHNKAR

If I go, who'll defend you if other

beasts attack?

BURGLEKUTT

He's right!  It seems only fair

that the man to take this baby to

the crossroads...

(walking stick up)

...be the very man who plucked

it...

(walking stick down)

...out of the river!

WILLOW

I can't do it!  I haven't put my

crop in!

A COUNCILMAN

You caused this trouble.  You found

the baby...you get rid of it!

BURGLEKUTT

I nominate Willow Ufgood!

HIGH ALDWIN

I will consult the bones!

HIGH ALDWIN

The bones tell me nothing.

(he eyes Willow)

But I must make a decision.  Is

there love in your heart for this

child?

WILLOW

Yes.

HIGH ALDWIN

The bones have spoken!  Willow?

The security of this village

depends on you!

MIMS

Dada?

MIMS

Watch out for brownies, Dada.

WILLOW

I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

RANON

Dada, what's a daikini?

WILLOW

Daikinis are giant people who live

far far away.

RANON

Are you scared?

RANON

I could be you rguard!  I could

carry your spear!

WILLOW

(smiles)

What a great son you are, Ranon.  I

wish I could take you with me.  Now

go to sleep...

HIGH ALDWIN

Now, you know where you're going?

(Willow shakes his head)

Down there, through those trees,

follow the river.  You'll know the

crossroads by a big daikini struc-

ture.  Willow, this is serious

business.  Don't waste any time,

the outer world is no place for a

Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first

daikini you see, then hurry home as

fast as you can.

WILLOW

If I'm not strong enough to be your

apprentice, how can I do this?

HIGH ALDWIN

You're strong enough.  But you're

going to need courage, Willow.

WILLOW

I don't want courage.  I don't want

to be a warrior.  All I've ever

wanted was to do magic, real magic,

like you!

HIGH ALDWIN

Real magic, Willow, is simply the

art of controlling the reality of

others.  You lack faith in your-

self.  You must learn to trust your

intuition.

HIGH ALDWIN

Go in the direction the bird is

flying.

WILLOW

(amazed)

Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd

turn Burglekutt into a toad!

HIGH ALDWIN

Waste magic on revenge?  You have

much to learn, Willow...

KIAYA

Willow, we've never been apart.  I

miss you already.  Take this.  It

will bring you luck.

WILLOW

You cut your hair, Kiaya?

KIAYA

Willow!!

LIEUTENANT

We've patrolled the hills.  This is

where they killed the nursemaid.

SORSHA

She must have done something with

the child.  Widen the search!

LIEUTENANT

Get away from there!

WILLOW

I hate this.  Where am I?  I should

stick you in a tree and go back

home.

(looks at baby)

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

WILLOW

That's it.  The crossroads...

WILLOW

I hate this.

WILLOW

I hate this.

WILLOW

I really hate this.

MADMARTIGAN

Hey, Peck...get me some water...or

you'll diiiiie...!

WILLOW

I will--I'll getcha water--getcha

lotsa water--anything you say--!

MADMARTIGAN

Peck!

MADMARTIGAN

You're a weasely little Peck!

Gimme some water!

WILLOW

I'm not coming near you!

MADMARTIGAN

Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in

here.

WILLOW

Good.  How long will it take?

MADMARTIGAN

Don't make me angry, Peck.

WILLOW

You be careful.  I'm a powerful

sorcerer.  I could turn you into a

toad just like that.

MADMARTIGAN

Miserable Pecks.

MADMARTIGAN

That's more like it.

WILLOW

Do any other daikinis ever come by

here?

MADMARTIGAN

Why.

WILLOW

I have to give this baby to some-

body.

MADMARTIGAN

I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll

take care of your baby.

WILLOW

No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a

reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

WILLOW

Hey!  Somebody's coming!

MADMARTIGAN

Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

MADMARTIGAN

No, you fool!  Put it out I say!

Out!

MADMARTIGAN

No!!

PICT

Whose fire!

MADMARTIGAN

No!  Help!  Stop!

PICT

Where are they?  Where did they go?

MADMARTIGAN

(spitting out dirt)

Thanks for your help, Peck.

WILLOW

Are you okay?

MADMARTIGAN

As if you care.  I saved your life,

Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!

(points dramatically)

You wanna give your baby to them??

They eat babies!

WILLOW

I don't know.

MADMARTIGAN

The world's gone insane.  Good men

locked in cages, criminals running

free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,

Peck.

WILLOW

Don't call me a Peck.  My name is

Willow.

MADMARTIGAN

Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN

You a woodcutter?

WILLOW

Farmer.

MADMARTIGAN

Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-

tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:

victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-

rupt, rotten world.

MADMARTIGAN

Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm

really a good man.  Give me my

freedom, and I'll look after that

baby for you.  Trust me.

MADMARTIGAN

That's it--good--good--like that,

yes, good, good, the chain--that's

it, come on--come on--!

WILLOW

Nooo, I don't think I should.

MADMARTIGAN

Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!

Let me out!

MADMARTIGAN

Morning, Willow.

MADMARTIGAN

Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been

in this cage toooo long.  Can't

think straight anymore.  Owww...!

WILLOW

You all right?

MADMARTIGAN

These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

WILLOW

See if this helps.

MADMARTIGAN

Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made

something for the baby.

WILLOW

What's inside?

MADMARTIGAN

A tooth.

(Willow reacts)

I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

WILLOW

Stop!  Wait!

MADMARTIGAN

(with authority)

Smells like a battle.

WILLOW

Are you a warrior?

MADMARTIGAN

The greatest swordsman that ever

lived.

WILLOW

What's that?  I hear something!

MADMARTIGAN

You hear trouble.

WILLOW

What is it?

MADMARTIGAN

A hundred horses...five or six

wagons...  and about six thousand

fools.

WILLOW

Sir?  Sir!

OFFICER

Out of the way!

AIRK

Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-

day!  We need to make ten more

leagues by dark!

WILLOW

Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We

found her in our village.  Will you

take her...?

AIRK

We're going into battle, little

one.  Find a woman to take care of

it.

MADMARTIGAN

He thought you were a woman, Airk!

AIRK

Madmartigan!  What did you do this

time?

MADMARTIGAN

Nothing you wouldn't have done it my

place!

AIRK

I always knew you'd end up in a

crow's cage.

MADMARTIGAN

Least I'm not down there herding

sheep!

AIRK

You're lucky somebody got to you

first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed

you myself after that stunt at

Land's End!

MADMARTIGAN

Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa

here.

AIRK

(really sarcastic)

Hey, remember?  You don't need my

help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit

trap like this?  Come on!  I could

open it for you, but I wouldn't

wanna insult you!

MADMARTIGAN

Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your

war for you.

AIRK

You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-

tigan.  And I got plenty of that.

Stay in your coffin and rot!

MADMARTIGAN

I'll be around long after you're

dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get

outa here I'll cut your head off

and stick it on a pig-pole!

WILLOW

Friend of yours?

MADMARTIGAN

Hello, little baby...

MADMARTIGAN

Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

WILLOW

I hate this.

MADMARTIGAN

Nobody's gonna take your baby.

Know why?  Nobody cares...

(beat)

Except me.

(wistfully)

You wanna go back to your farm.

You wanna go back to your family.

I could take care of that baby.

I'll look after her like she was me

own.

WILLOW

You don't know anything about ba-

bies.

MADMARTIGAN

Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women

who do.  Why, if I had somebody in

my life--a little daughter for

instance--I'd have a reason to

live...

MADMARTIGAN

Willow.  You can't let me die here.

Not when I wanna help you.

WILLOW

You gotta promise to feed her.

MADMARTIGAN

I will.

WILLOW

Fresh goat's milk.

MADMARTIGAN

Absolutely!

WILLOW

And give her a bath everyday, and

don't let her get cold.  And keep

her diaper changed.

MADMARTIGAN

Of course!  I promise!

MADMARTIGAN

Come to Daddy, little darlin'.

(picks her up)

I think she likes me!

WILLOW

Here are her diaper rags.  And this

is her milk bladder.  And when she

cries--she's either hungry or she's

tired--rock her on your left

shoulder.  She likes that.

MADMARTIGAN

Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good

hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

WILLOW

Bye.

WILLOW

(to Madmartigan)

Please take good care of her.

MADMARTIGAN

You've done a great job.  Now you

go back to your family and get your

crop in.

WILLOW

Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's

come home!  Welcome back, Willow!

He deserves a medal:  he's quite

mystical.  For honor, for bravery,

for his intuitive powers...

(he chuckles)

...let's make him Apprentice

Aldwin.  Better still:  High

Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-

good, High Aldwin of---

WILLOW

Come back here, you!  That's my

baby!!

WILLOW

Oh no, it's a trap!

WILLOW

Oh noooooo!!

WILLOW

(focusing)

Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN

I am Franjean, king of the world.

WILLOW

That baby's my responsibility!

FRANJEAN

I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go

back to sleep, monsieur...

WILLOW

Yeow!

(he loses consciousness)

Madmartigan...I never should've

trusted you...

TEEMO

Tongue.

WILLOW

Who are you?

ROOL

Quiet, you fool!

TEEMO

(formal)

We are emissaries of her majesty,

Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of

Coshairm.

WILLOW

Queen Cherlindrea?

TEEMO

She requests the presence of your-

self and the young princess.

WILLOW

Who??

TEEMO

You're the guardian, aren't you?

ROOL

Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get

outa here!

TEEMO

Elves!  They're always tormenting

babies.  They make them cry and

take their tears.

ROOL

Somebody has to do it.

WILLOW

Why??

ROOL

How else they gonna make dew drops?

WILLOW

I'm getting her out of there!

TEEMO

No!  You let us handle this.  Come

along, Rool!

TEEMO

Watch this.  Right between the

eyes.

ROOL

(to the elves)

He never misses.

TEEMO

Ooops.  Was that right?  That

wasn't right.

ROOL/TEEMO

Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

WILLOW

I can't go out there with the baby!

ROOL/TEEMO

(frantically point)

Elves!!

WILLOW

Ohhh, I hate this.

TEEMO

Take your time.  Don't worry about

the elves.  They won't come out

here.

WILLOW

Why not?

ROOL

Because of the trolls.

WILLOW

Trolls?

TEEMO

Relax.  They only come out at

night.

WILLOW

This is not going well.

TEEMO

Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know

what to do.

TEEMO

Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-

body ever gets called before Her

Majesty.

ROOL

Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA

Willow Ufgood.

WILLOW

(blinded)

Yes...?

CHERLINDREA

I hope you are comfortable here,

inside my kingdom...

TEEMO

Talk!  Say something!

WILLOW

I can't see anything--she's too

bright!

CHERLINDREA

I'm sorry...

CHERLINDREA

Broke-heart of nightingale for our

honored guest.

CHERLINDREA

It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy

has come true.

WILLOW

You mean, you know who this baby

belongs to?

CHERLINDREA

She belongs to all of us.  She is

the future queen and ruler of all

kingdoms on earth.

WILLOW

What a relief.  Now I can go home.

CHERLINDREA

No, Willow.  Your journey has just

begun.  It has been foretold that

this child shall bring about the

downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose

evil powers have darkened our

world.  Upon you depends this

princess's life.

WILLOW

Me?

CHERLINDREA

You are the guardian, Willow.  You

must take her to Tir Asleen.

WILLOW

What is Tir Asleen?

CHERLINDREA

It is a distant castle, where a

great king and queen will look

after Elora Danan and keep her safe

until she is old enough to rule.

WILLOW

Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is

it?

CHERLINDREA

The way has been lost in time. But

there is one person, a druid sor-

ceress, who might guide you there.

She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda

many years ago.  Her name is Fin

Raziel.

WILLOW

You need a warrior for this job.

I'm nobody.

CHERLINDREA

You are very important, Willow.

WILLOW

No I'm not.  Have you really looked

at me?

(jumps to his feet)

I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

WILLOW

(continuing)

Why can't you do it?  You have mag-

ical powers.

CHERLINDREA

My prsence cannot extend beyond

this forest.  But I can give you

these...

CHERLINDREA

They will protect you.  Use them

wisely.

WILLOW

They look like acorns.

CHERLINDREA

Anything you hurl them at will turn

to stone.

WILLOW

They're magic?  Are you serious?

CHERLINDREA

(sternly)

I am very serious, Willow.  There

is no time to lose.

WILLOW

But I've got a family to think

about!  They need me!

WILLOW

Hello...?

CHERLINDREA

Bavmord'a powers are growing like

an evil plague.  Soon she will con-

trol the lives of you children,

your wife, your village...everyone.

CHERLINDREA

The choice is yours.

WILLOW

I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do

it!

WILLOW

But I only have one shoe.

WILLOW

Wait till I tell my children.

Stuff like this never happens in my

village.

TEEMO

Hey, careful there!

WILLOW

How do these work I wonder?  I got-

ta save one to show the High

Aldwin.

ROOL

Look!  Death below!

WILLOW

Daikinis...

HORSEMEN

Hyaaaaahh!!

WILLOW

Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't

cry, Elora.  Things can't get any

worse than this...

TEEMO

I'm not going in there.

ROOL

Me neither!

WILLOW

Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What

could possibly happen?

WILLOW

Could you spare some milk for this

poor hungry baby?

BARMAID

Get outa here, Peck!

PATRONS

A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,

Peck!

WILLOW

I could use your help, boys.

TEEMO'S VOICE

Willow?

WILLOW

This is not fun.

WILLOW

Woah!

WENCH

Hurry!  Hurry!

THE OTHER WOMAN

(in a gruff voice)

How do I look?

WILLOW

You!!

MADMARTIGAN

Where the hell did you come from?

WILLOW

I trusted you...

ROOL

Who's he?

MADMARTIGAN

You're crawling with rodents.

LLUG

Where is he!!

WENCH

There's nobody here except me and

my, um, cousin.

MADMARTIGAN

How do you do.

WILLOW

Hey!  Give me that baby!

MADMARTIGAN

(high voice)

These Pecks make terrible nurse-

maids.

WILLOW

Nursemaid?!

MADMARTIGAN

(high voice)

They get too excited.

LLUG

Wanna breeeeeeed?

WILLOW

(mischievously)

Time to change her diaper.

MADMARTIGAN

Time to leave.

SORSHA

You!  Are you the mother of that

child?

MADMARTIGAN

No.

(looks at Llug; in a high voice)

I mean yes.

SORSHA

Let me see it.

MADMARTIGAN

(high voice)

I can't.

SORSHA

Let me see it.

WILLOW

No!  You can't!

MADMARTIGAN

(high voice)

I can't.

SORSHA

Why not?

MADMARTIGAN

(to Willow)

Why not?

WILLOW

Because she's sick.

MADMARTIGAN

(to Sorsha)

Because she's sick.

SORSHA

Give it to me!

MADMARTIGAN

(high voice)

Gawd...you're...beautiful...

SORSHA

You're not a woman.

LLUG

Not a woman??!!

SORSHA

After them!!

WILLOW

Madmartigan!  Wait!

WILLOW

We could've been killed, Madmarti-

gan!

WILLOW

Heeyah!  Heeyah!

WILLOW

Oh no!

DEATH

Bordak!!

DEATH

Bordak!!

WILLOW

Woah...woah...!

MADMARTIGAN

That girl is a vision.

WILLOW

Where's the baby??

MADMARTIGAN

I thought you had her!

ROOL/TEEMO

Willow!!

MADMARTIGAN

Now Willow, I know you're gonna

blame me for this but it wasn't my

fault...!

WILLOW

Elora Danan!

MADMARTIGAN

When I left the crossroads, I got

ambushed by an elf!

WILLOW

Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

MADMARTIGAN

I did?

MADMARTIGAN

I mean, of course I saved her life.

She's almost my daughter, isn't

she?

WILLOW

Let's get out of here before they

come back.

TEEMO

Northeast is that way.  We've come

west and south.  I think.

ROOL

Watch it!  You're gonna set us on

fire.

MADMARTIGAN

Not a bad idea.

MADMARTIGAN

So you're on your way to Tir

Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you

this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't

exist.

WILLOW

Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told

me.

MADMARTIGAN

The Fairy Queen?  And the baby

here's a princess?  And these two

rodents are your guides?

MADMARTIGAN

Yeah well...in the morning I think

I'll be on my way.

WILLOW

Madmartigan, I need your help.

MADMARTIGAN

My help?  A great magician like

you?  You don't need any help.

WILLOW

But you're a great swordsman!

WILLOW

(explodes)

You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!

A warrior wouldn't lie there and do

nothing!

WILLOW

We're in trouble!  You've seen the

big army that's after us!  You're a

fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--

you're a coward!!

MADMARTIGAN

What's with you, Peck?

WILLOW

I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-

dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing

up so fast, he even helps me on the

farm now!  And little Mims!  If you

ever saw her sweet little face

you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd

*melt*!

(sniffles)

Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't

know anything about love.  You

don't know anything about any-

thing...

MADMARTIGAN

I was in love once, Willow.  She

had a hold on my heart.  I could

barely function.

(a pause)

I *was* a great swordsman!  I was

knighted!  I could have been king!

WILLOW

You?

MADMARTIGAN

Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed

me.  She robbed me of my dream.

MADMARTIGAN

I'll never fall in love again...

WILLOW

Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

MADMARTIGAN

Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

ROOL

That's it!  The sorceress lives

there!

TEEMO

Are you sure?

ROOL

(excited)

Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on

that island!

TEEMO

That tree dosn't look like gold to

me.

MADMARTIGAN

Gold!!

TEEMO

Its branches are supposed to be

made of gold, solid gold.

WILLOW

How are we going to get out there?

MADMARTIGAN

We'll find a way, Willow.  Look

over there--that looks like a

village--maybe they've got a boat.

Come on, what are you waiting for?

MADMARTIGAN

Give me a hand here, Peck!

BOY

What are you doing?

MADMARTIGAN

It's nothing to do with you.

WILLOW

We need to get out to that island.

BOY

The island is cursed.

WILLOW

We've traveled a long way.  We're

looking for Fin Raziel.

TEEMO

The sorceress.

BOY

She's there.  But you can't go

there.  The island is cursed.

MADMARTIGAN

(no patience)

Yeah?  Who cursed it?

BOY

Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern

the elements.

MADMARTIGAN

Ahh, he's trying to protect the

gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

WILLOW

What would the Fairy Queen say?

ROOL

She's not here.

TEEMO

(to Rool)

Obviously.

WILLOW

Without Raziel we'll never find Tir

Asleen.

(decision)

We'd better go.

WILLOW

Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

RAZIEL

Get away!  Get away!

RAZIEL

You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL

Who are you!  Who are you!

WILLOW

I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to

find Fin Raziel.

RAZIEL

That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

WILLOW

This can't be right.  This isn't a

sorceress.  This is some kind of

animal.

TEEMO

Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

RAZIEL

What do you want!

WILLOW

We need your help.  To take this

baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-

cess.

RAZIEL

Elora Danan!

MADMARTIGAN

Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!

This whole tree is made of gold!!

RAZIEL

Fools!  You should never have come

to this place!  We're all going to

die!

RAZIEL

We've got to get off this island

right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's

our only chance!

WILLOW

Madmartigan!

MADMARTIGAN

Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

WILLOW

Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

MADMARTIGAN

My gold!

RAZIEL

Kill him!

WILLOW

No!

RAZIEL

Kill him!

MADMARTIGAN

No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

MADMARTIGAN

Willow...you...you got...magic...!

Wait...we could team up...!

RAZIEL

Flee!  Flee!

SORSHA

Raziel.  Did you think my mother

would allow you to escape?

SORSHA

This is what we're looking for.  It

bears the markings.

MADMARTIGAN

Don't worry, Willow.  If there's

one thing I'm good at, it's charm-

ing a woman...

MADMARTIGAN

So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

SORSHA

Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

MADMARTIGAN

Still got what counts.

SORSHA

Not for long.

SORSHA

We'll join the column.  Bring them

with us.

TEEMO

We gotta follow them.

ROOL

Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-

way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's

go home.

TEEMO

Get back here, Rool!

ROOL

Ouch!  Let go of me!

WILLOW

I can't go on...

MADMARTIGAN

Willow, why don't you use your mag-

ic to get us out of here?

RAZIEL

He's no magician.

MADMARTIGAN

He turned that monster into stone!

RAZIEL

Did *you* give that acorn its power?

WILLOW

No.

RAZIEL

A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool

can use it.

MADMARTIGAN

Then you get us out of here.

RAZIEL

I will!  But I need help!

WILLOW

I'll help you...!

MADMARTIGAN

I won't.

RAZIEL

You must learn magic.

WILLOW

That's all I ever wanted!

RAZIEL

Then I will teach you.

MADMARTIGAN

Nice horse...nice hair...real nice

hair...I'd say you've got the most

beautiful hair I've ever--

SORSHA

Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

SORSHA

Don't tempt me.

WILLOW

If you rest the baby on your

shoulder, she'll stop crying.

SORSHA

Shut up.

MADMARTIGAN

Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

SORSHA

(angry threat)

My step-father's going to tear you

apart.

MADMARTIGAN

I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!

Under all that armor is a

beautiful--

MADMARTIGAN

Who is that girl, anyway?

RAZIEL

Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

MADMARTIGAN

Forget that one, Madmartigan.

RAZIEL

Willow.  To learn magic, first you

must make your own philosopher's

stone!

WILLOW

What do I need for that?

RAZIEL

We must start with feathers, dung,

and a lock of your hair.

MADMARTIGAN

Now that's a woman...!

RAZIEL

Keep working at it.  Forget all you

know, or think you know.  A

magician's power depends on disord-

er of the mind.

MADMARTIGAN

You got that one covered.

WILLOW

I hope she's all right.  How much

more do I have to do of this?

RAZIEL

Till it's in a powder.  The energy

exits within you...

WILLOW

(reciting)

I know, and the magician's goal is

to find his true self.  But what's

this got to do with it?

RAZIEL

As below, so above.  You hold the

univers, Willow, in your hand.

MADMARTIGAN

I'm beginning to think you two

*deserve* to be locked up.

WILLOW

The universe is a living creature,

like you and me, Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN

We're a tiny version of all that?

RAZIEL

As above, so below.

WILLOW

I'm all finished.  Now what?

RAZIEL

Burn it to a fine ash.

WILLOW

How am I gonna do that?

RAZIEL

Patience.  Concentrate.  You will

find a way.

WILLOW

What's going on?

MADMARTIGAN

Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

SORSHA

This baby won't do what I say.  You

seem to know what to do.  Here!

Make it shut up.

WILLOW

She needs to be changed.

SORSHA

I changed her already!

WILLOW

She needs to be changed again.

SORSHA

Who is that horrible friend of

yours?

WILLOW

(watching the fire)

Madmartigan.

SORSHA

Who is he?

WILLOW

I don't know much about him.

SORSHA

He's very bold.  Do you really

think my hair is beautiful?

WILLOW

Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

WILLOW

She's hungry.

SORSHA

I know she's hungry.  I tried to

feed her but she wouldn't eat a

thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

WILLOW

Here.  Hold her.

SORSHA

I tried everything.  A spoon.  I

poured milk into her mouth, she just

spat it out.  I don't know what to

do, I'm not a mother.

WILLOW

Sometimes she likes it heated.

WILLOW

She's a good baby.

WILLOW

I did it!  I got the ashes!

RAZIEL

Good!  The first step is complete.

MADMARTIGAN

Did she ask about me?

WILLOW

Who?

MADMARTIGAN

Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard

time.  You were in her ten all

night.  Did she say anything?

WILLOW

She said lots of thing.s

MADMARTIGAN

Willow!

WILLOW

She asked about you, Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN

Well what did she say?

SORSHA

Here.  You're going to need these

where we're going.

MADMARTIGAN

She's in love.

WILLOW

You're crazy.  I think you're in

love.

RAZIEL

We don't have much time left!  Go

on!  Go on!

WILLOW

I must concetrate my

imagination...to creat a

new...reality!

RAZIEL

What's the magician's weapon?

WILLOW

The limitless power of...

RAZIEL

Your will!  Your will!  What else

could it be?

WILLOW

(frustrated)

I can't remember all these things.

What am I learning?

RAZIEL

The art of transformation!

WILLOW

(exasperated)

But what am I gonna transform??

RAZIEL

Me!

WILLOW

You?

MADMARTIGAN

What are you gonna become, Raziel?

Queen of the rodents?

SORSHA

The baby's cold.  Take her.

RAZIEL

You remind me of your father, Sor-

sha.

SORSHA

My father was a weakling.

RAZIEL

He was a great king.

(Madmartigan reacts)

Not like your step-father, not like

your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen

with kindness, and a generous

heart.

SORSHA

My mother calls that weakness.

MADMARTIGAN

What do *you* call it?

SORSHA

I do what I'm told.

MADMARTIGAN

Too bad you're not more like

your father.

SORSHA

Be careful.

KAEL

Don't tell me what to do.

MADMARTIGAN

We gotta get the baby out of here.

RAZIEL

Tonight!  Complete the

philosopher's stone!  I must be

turned back!

WILLOW

I'll do it, Raziel...

RAZIEL

Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.

Concentration and will.  Now pour

the water off.

WILLOW

Oooh, this smells terrible.

RAZIEL

That's the life spark.  Exxence of

magic and sorcery!

WILLOW

Ouch!!

RAZIEL

Shhhhh!

WILLOW

What'd you bit me for!!

RAZIEL

We need blood.  To nourish the

stone.  charge the stone with ener-

gy.

RAZIEL

The components of the stone are

fusing...

RAZIEL

Again:  what is the magician's

weapon?

WILLOW

His will.

RAZIEL

Now use it.

WILLOW

I just wanted to test it first.

RAZIEL

No!  Change me back into a sor-

ceress, Willow.

WILLOW

Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

WILLOW

What did I do?

MADMARTIGAN

Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You

busted the lock.

WILLOW

Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get

Eloran Danan.

MADMARTIGAN

Let's get Elora Danan.

RAZIEL

Wait!  What about me!

MADMARTIGAN

You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm

a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the

baby.

RAZIEL

I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=

man.

WILLOW

(whispers)

Come on, Madmartigan...!

WILLOW

What are you doing?  Get out of

there...!

MADMARTIGAN

I love you.

SORSHA

One move, and you really will be a

woman.

SORSHA

You're a fool.  Now put her back.

MADMARTIGAN

I'm not going to let this baby die.

SORSHA

Don't make me kill you.

MADMARTIGAN

I believe you would...

SORSHA

Why did you say that?

MADMARTIGAN

Say what?

SORSHA

I love you.

MADMARTIGAN

Because it's true.

SORSHA

I don't believe you.

MADMARTIGAN

I wish it weren't true.  I swore

I'd never let this happen.  I hate

you.  I hate your beauty, I hate

your innocence, I hate the feelings

you've awakened in me.

MADMARTIGAN

I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I

don't want to be, but a power has

enchanted me and I stand helpless

against it.  It's torture.  Battle-

field or prison cell was never half

as cruel.

MADMARTIGAN

I want you and I can't have you so

I want you all the more.  If this

were another time and another place

I'd--

SORSHA

You'd what?

KAEL

What's going on here!!

SORSHA

Deceiver!!

MADMARTIGAN

Whoops!

MADMARTIGAN

Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

KAEL

Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

MADMARTIGAN

Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I

love you!

KAEL

Kill them!!

WILLOW

Nooo!!!

MADMARTIGAN

Willow!  Willow!  Are you all

right?

VILLAGER

King Kael!

ANOTHER VILLAGER

Nockmaar troops!

MADMARTIGAN

(to villagers)

Help us.

AIRK

Madmartigan.  Settled down with a

family huh?

MADMARTIGAN

You left me to die, friend.

AIRK

You managed alright.

MADMARTIGAN

Is this what's left of your army?

OFFICER

Keep that baby quiet.

KAEL

Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn

your village!  Sorsha!

OFFICER

Kill her.

MADMARTIGAN

You'll draw the others.

AIRK

It's you they're after, Madmarti-

gan.  What did you do this time?

MADMARTIGAN

They're not after me.  They want

the baby.

AIRK

Who is this baby?

WILLOW

The princess, Elora Danan.

PEOPLE

The prophecy has come true.

AIRK

Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

RAZIEL

Not safe!  Not safe!

WILLOW

We're taking her to Tir Asleen.

She'll be safe there from

Bavmorda's powers.

AIRK

Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't

exist.

RAZIEL

It does!  It does!  I will show

you!

AIRK

You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?

I've lost half my men fighting

Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-

maar army.  Now you and this Peck,

and that magpie up in the rafters,

are gonna take 'em on alone?

MADMARTIGAN

(challenging)

Then come with us.

AIRK

The war is here!  In towns and vil-

lages like this!

AIRK

You're chasing a dream.

MADMARTIGAN

Just get me some horses.

MADMARTIGAN

Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

AIRK

One day one of us willl stand on

the other's grave.

RAZIEL

Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

RAZIEL

This way!  The cave!

WILLOW

Madmartigan!  I can't stand being

in closed-in places.

MADMARTIGAN

Want me to carry Elora?

WILLOW

I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

MADMARTIGAN

She's doing a lot better than we

are, Peck.

MADMARTIGAN

Willow...this may be a bad time to

ask this question but...what if

Raziel's wrong?

WILLOW

She can't be wrong.  She's a very

very very powerful sorceress.

MADMARTIGAN

She's a bird, Willow.

WILLOW

That's my fault, not hers.  I've

got to keep practicing.  I'm still

in the learning stage but magic,

Madmartigan, requires concentration

and--

MADMARTIGAN

Watch it!

WILLOW

Ahhh!

WILLOW

I hate this.

MADMARTIGAN

Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

MADMARTIGAN

Willow!  Willow!

KAEL

Go after them!

MADMARTIGAN

Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

RAZIEL

Look out!

KAEL

After them!!

RAZIEL

Tir Asleen.

WILLOW

There's nobody here.

RAZIEL

The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The

king's bravest warriors.

RAZIEL

Turn them back, Willow!

WILLOW

How??

RAZIEL

Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-

ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

WILLOW

Beings within, beings without!

Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

WILLOW

I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!

Look!  You gotta see this!  I did

it!

RAZIEL

More!  More!

KAEL

Assault!  Scale the walls!

WILLOW

Tuatha tuatha danu!

WILLOW

Raziel!  I transformed them all!

I'm a magician!

RAZIEL

You didn't transform them, Willow,

you released them.  That was noth-

ing.  Now change me.

WILLOW

I feel like I could do anything!

KNIGHT

It belonged to our king.

WILLOW

Capture the enery...limitless

power of the will...avvdachh doth

indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

WILLOW

Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What

happened?

RAZIEL

I hate this.

KAEL

Attack!!

MADMARTIGAN

Sorsha.

SORSHA

Madmartigan.

MADMARTIGAN

Whose side are you on?

SORSHA

Yours.

MINION

Arrrggghhh!

SORSHA

I love you.

KAEL

Sorsha!!

KAEL

Bordak!

KAEL

Kill them both!

KAEL

Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with

me!

WILLOW

I'm sorry.  There were too many of

them.

MADMARTIGAN

Out for a little ride in the coun-

try, Airk?

AIRK

Thought you might get lonely, Mad-

martigan!

MADMARTIGAN

Thank you, friend.

AIRK

Let's go.

MADMARTIGAN

Sorsha!  Any way in there?

SORSHA

No.  The fortress is protected on

all sides.

AIRK

Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

BAVMORDA

Kael!

KAEL

Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

BAVMORDA

We must start the ritual!

BAVMORDA

Who is that?

KAEL

An army of rebels and traitors.

BAVMORDA

Where is Sorsha?

KAEL

She has turned against you.

BAVMORDA

Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-

plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

BAVMORDA

This is not an army!

RAZIEL

Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!

Hide!

RAZIEL

Get down!  The ritual chant!

Quick!  Protect yourself!

WILLOW

Why?

RAZIEL

Just do it!

MADMARTIGAN

We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn

her over to us!

BAVMORDA

You dare to challenge me?  You are

not warriors.  You're pigs!

BAVMORDA

You're all pigs!

SORSHA

Mother!  No!!

BAVMORDA

You made your decision!

BAVMORDA

Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the

first candle.

BAVMORDA

Come, thunder.  Come lightning.

Touch this altar with your pwer.

Come into my tower...

BAVMORDA

Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and

bind, bind and blend, Universal

night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

RAZIEL

It's over, Willow.  You did well.

You protected yourself.

WILLOW

I've come all this way and now

Elora Dana's going to die!

RAZIEL

No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

WILLOW

She's too powerful, Raziel

RAZIEL

A true magician, Willow, never

surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I

am a sorceress!  Transform me now

and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

WILLOW

Banish all disturbing forces from

this place.  Fire, water, above and

below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-

ance.

RAZIEL

(voice distorted)

Don't give up!  Willow!

WILLOW

Raziel!

RAZIEL

We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-

low.  Bring in our brave men.

BAVMORDA

Black fire forever kindled within,

Let the second right begin!

AIRK

Uphill with our rough weapons,

we'll never make it!

SORSHA

Elora Danan will die!

RAZIEL

By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the

runic drum!

WARRIOR

Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need

more forces.  I say we retreat!

RAZIEL

Bavmorda cannot transform you.

I've protected this camp with a

spell.

MADMARTIGAN

Can you use your magic to get our

men into the fortress, Raziel?

RAZIEL

Bavmorda has shielded it with a

spell of her own.

WILLOW

Wait!!

WILLOW

I have an idea.  Back in my village

we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

MADMARTIGAN

Willow, this is war, not agricul-

ture!

WILLOW

I know, I know!  But this is a way

to get into that castle...

AIRK

It's too much work.

WARRIOR

It can't be done.

SORSHA

Kael will never fall for it.

MADMARTIGAN

(doubtful)

I don't know, Willow.

WILLOW

Madmartigan, you promised me you'd

take care of Elora Danan like your

own daughter.  She is all that

matters.  Are you going to abandon

her?

AIRK

Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna

listen to a Peck?  You and I are

warriors.  You know this plan will

never work.

MADMARTIGAN

We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

SORSHA

I have no family.

RAZIEL

If we do not fight, and the baby

dies, all hope for the future is

lost.  I shall face the danger

alone if I have to.

WILLOW

Me, too.

MADMARTIGAN

Time is running out.  We must now

decide who's going to leave and who

is going to stay...

BAVMORDA

Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

RAZIEL

Time is running out.

WILLOW

Surrender!!

WILLOW

We are all-powerful magicians!

Give us the baby or we will destroy

you!!

KAEL

Kill them!

RAZIEL

Patience, Willow.

WILLOW

Courage, Willow.

AIRK

Let's squah 'em!

SORSHA

No, Willow!!

SORSHA

I will face my mother alone.

BAVMORDA

Sorsha!!

SORSHA

I won't let you kill her!

BAVMORDA

You are a weakling.  Like you fa-

ther!  Can you not see that I am

about to become all-powerful!

SORSHA

No!!

BAVMORDA

Raziel...!!

RAZIEL

The baby will be queen.  It has

been foretold, Bavmorda.

BAVMORDA

My ritual will kill the prophecy!

Now the child dies with it, its en-

ergy exiled into oblivion!

(lightning flashes)

You see?  I hold the power of the

universe!

RAZIEL

Not until your ritual is complete!

BAVMORDA

And who will stop me?  The elements

are slaves to my command!

RAZIEL

There is no one who can match your

sorcery.  Except me!

MADMARTIGAN

Airk!!

MADMARTIGAN

Airk!  Airk!

MADMARTIGAN

Madmartigan...you're a brave

warrior...a true friend...a good

man...

MADMARTIGAN

We're gonna win this war, Airk.

BAVMORDA

As above, so below!  Universe of

evil, Raziel!  It conquers even

you!

BAVMORDA

*Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

BAVMORDA

Who are you?

WILLOW

I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

WILLOW

I'm a *great* magician.

BAVMORDA

Is that the extent of your power?

BAVMORDA

Place it on the altar.

WILLOW

No.  You can't have her.

BAVMORDA

By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw

the lightning and send this child

into the destructive realm.

WILLOW

And with my magic I'll send her

into the...into the...

BAVMORDA

You're no magician.

WILLOW

Into the good.

BAVMORDA

Even I don't have the power to do

that.  You're a fraud.

BAVMORDA

Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

BAVMORDA

Aaaaahhhh!!!

RAZIEL

Willow...Willow...how...how did you

do that?

WILLOW

It was just the old disappearing

pig trick.

RAZIEL

Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of

Sorcery.  You are on your way to

becoming a great magician.

WILLOW

Your dream has come true, madmarti-

gan.

MADMARTIGAN

Goodbye, Peck.

WILLOW

Farewell, Elora Danan.

KIAYA

Willow!!

WILLOW

Kiaya!!

*THE END*
