SPOILS OF WAR

by

John Ridley

WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT

JULY 26th, 1995

FADE TO:

PRESIDENT BUSH

...This act of naked aggression must be

checked.  The United States, along with

coalition forces from the Middle East,

have drawn a line in the sand.  There is

only one way for this situation to be

satisfactorily resolved.  The belligerent

forces from the Republic of Iraq must be

removed from Kuwait, be it by choice, or

by force...

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER (V.O.)

At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAEGER

At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

EPPS

What are you doing?

JAEGER

What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm

killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-

at-at--

WES

Could you stop, please.  You're giving me

a headache.

JAEGER

A headache?

WES

Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're

making me uncomfortable.

JAEGER

I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking

away in a desert in the middle of nowhere

facing three-hundred-thousand screaming

Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that

doesn't bother you.  But me making a

little noise is driving you out of your

skull.

WES

Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.

JAEGER

Okay.

JAEGER(CONT)

At-at-at-at-at.

EPPS

Knock it off!

JAEGER

Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I

want to be ready when this war starts.

EPPS

Ready for what?  What are you supposed to

be doing?

JAEGER

I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.

EPPS

No you're not.

EPPS(CONT)

The Iraqis are that way.  Those are our

troops you're shooting at.

EPPS(CONT)

You know what?  I think you got

Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the

General right in the ass.  Now that's

good shooting.

JAEGER

Blow me.

EPPS

Another month in this desert and I might

just.

WES

Think we're going to do it?  Think we're

going to war?

EPPS

Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All

they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

JAEGER

We ought to kick their asses anyway.

Even if they do get out of Kuwait we

ought to kick their asses.

WES

I don't think we'll go to war.  We

shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our

fight, it's a regional conflict.  It

should be decided regionally.

JAEGER

People are suffering.

WES

People were suffering in Afganistan, and

we didn't do anything.

EPPS

That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart

enough to be sitting on top of oil.

People suffering is one thing, but when

the Yuppies aren't going to have enough

gas for their BMWs it's time to break out

the tanks.  Come on.  Pack up.  We've got

a whole lot of nothing to patrol.

JAEGER

We ought to kick their asses.  Either way

we ought to.

CUT TO:

WES

...And it's very important when you sit

down never to point the soles of your

shoes at anyone.  It's considered

offensive.

EPPS

You know so much about the Middle East,

you know where we can get something to

eat.

JAEGER

When do you ever point the soles of your

feet at people?

WES

I'm saying don't do it accidently.

JAEGER

Oh yeah.  Accidently.

JAEGER(CONT)

I'm sorry.  My foot accidently jumped up

in the air where you could see the bottom

of it.  I hate it when that happens.

WES

Come on.  You're going to get us in

trouble.

JAEGER

It was an accident.  You saw it was an

accident.

WES

I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It

doesn't hurt to know something about

Saudi Arabia.

EPPS

Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn

Arabic you might as well learn were we

can get something to eat around here.

WES

I didn't learn Arabic because we were

getting shipped here.  You don't learn it

in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in

high school.

JAEGER

Spanish wasn't hard enough?

WES

I thought it would be good to know.

JAGER

Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug.

WES

Hey, Jaeger.  Why don't you try this:

Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib.

JAEGER

What does that mean?

WES

Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can

use that when you surrender.

JAEGER

How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm

horny."  I can use that now.

WES

Don't even try it.  You offend a woman

out here you're in serious trouble.

EPPS

Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his

personality as a form of birth control.

JAEGER

Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys

recently?  Blow me.

JAEGER(CONT)

What is this?

JAEGER(CONT)

Hey, Wes.  Wes!

JAEGER(CONT)

What is this?

WES

Now you need me.

JAEGER

What is it?  You know so much about

Arabland tell me what it is.

WES

Well, based on my knowledge of the

region, its culture and her people I

would have to say it's a box.

EPPS

Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I

really don't care what it is.

JAEGER

Ask him what it is.

WES

He says it's a box.

JAEGER

Yeah, you're funny.

WES

It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out

how to open it there's supposed to be a

treasure inside.

JAEGER

(Excited)

For real?  A treasure?

EPPS

Oh, man, you're not going to fall for

that.

JAEGER

There might be something in there.

EPPS

Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.

JAEGER

There might be.

WES

And you're the guy who's going to open

it.

JAEGER

I could.

EPPS

You could turn on a light if someone put

your hand on the switch.

EPPS(CONT)

Well, that showed me.  Now, can we eat?

CUT TO:

WES

You get it yet?

JAEGER

Naw, nothing.

WES

You will.  You'll get it.

JAEGER

I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I

get this thing open.

WES

You really think there's a treasure

inside?

JAEGER

I don't care if there's a lump of coal in

here.  I just want to be able to rub

Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

WES

Jaeger?

JAEGER

What?

WES

You know the fifteenth is the deadline

for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.

JAEGER

Yeah.  So?

WES

That's in two days.

JAEGER

Like I said; so?

WES

They're cancelling all leaves, all

passes.  No more drills.  We stand at

full ready starting--

JAEGER

What's your point, Wes?  You have a

point?

WES

We're going to war, aren't we.  If

they're doing all that it must mean we're

going to war.

JAEGER

It doesn't mean anything.

WES

Why would they do all that if we weren't?

JAEGER

Okay, so we're going to war.  We're

supposed to go to war.  We're soldiers,

that's what we do.  The guns, the tanks,

the planes; you're just now getting the

hint we're in the war business?

WES

Jaeger?

JAEGER

(For sure aggravated)

What!?

WES

You ever think about dying?

JAEGER

Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.

WES

You ever think about it?  You ever worry?

JAEGER

The only thing I worry about is how much

Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick

before this whole thing is over.  The

only people who I've got anything to worry

about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys

who don't know enough to get out of the

way when I come rolling at them; an M-16

in each hand, and a grenade between my

teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier,

I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got

a treasure to find.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

BUSH

Just two hours ago, Allied air forces

began an attack on military targets in

Iraq and Kuwait.  These attacks continue

as I speak...Our objectives are clear.

Saddam Hussein's forces will leave

Kuwait.  The legitimate government of

Kuwait will be restored to its rightful

place, and Kuwait will once again be

free.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER(V.O.)

At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAEGER

At-at-at-at-at.

WES

(Re:  His TV)

This is so weird.  It's happening, but

it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're

part of it.

JAEGER

At-at-at-at-at.

EPPS

Will you knock it off!  Damn, man.

You're going to annoy the Iraqis into

submission.

JAEGER

This is stupid.  It's going on a month

now.  How long are they going to let the

Air Force piss on those bastards?  They

can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't

going anywhere without a ground assault.

What the hell is the army waiting for?

EPPS

Why you in such a hurry to get to

shooting?

JAEGER

I've got to have something to tell people

when I get home besides I protected a

stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for

nothing in the first place.

WES

The longer the air force hits the Iraqis,

the safer it'II be for us when we have to

engage.

JAEGER

You know what, Wes?  If you get a note

from your mommy they might excuse you

from the war.

EPPS

You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope

the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my

misery.

JAEGER

OH MY GOD!

EPPS

What!?  What!?

JAEGER

I did it!  I got the box open.

EPPS

You almost got yourself shot, that's

what you did.

WES

What's inside?

JAEGER

It's...it's...I don't know what it is.

WES

It's a container.  Break the seal.

EPPS

Go on, man.

WES

Paper.

EPPS

It's a fortune box.

WES

What's it say?

EPPS

Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle

box factory.

JAEGER

It's a drawing, or something.  Some kind

of art.

EPPS

Looks like something a kid would do.

WES

It's a map, I think that's what it is.

EPPS

There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the

buried treasure, and you're a

millionaire.

JAEGER

You think?

EPPS

Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You

and the five thousand other suckers who

bought those boxes.  Let's get out of

here.  We got sand to protect.

CUT TO:

JAEGER

Woods.

WOODS

Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.

JAEGER

I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of

Iraqi.

WOODS

A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna

have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally

get out of here.  What kind of map you

need?  Topographical, geographical,

thermal?

JAGER

I don't know.  A map map.

WOODS

A map map.

WOODS(CONT)

That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq

is the pink thing.

JAEGER

I could use some recon photos too.

WOODS

Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?

JAEGER

Just...want to be ready when we do.

WOODS

Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?

JAEGER

The photos.

JAEGER(CONT)

Some good ones.

WOODS

They're all good ones.  Satellites we've

got can snap a shot of the boil on

Saddam's ass.

JAEGER

Saddam's got a boil on his ass?

JAEGER(CONT)

I don't know.

JAEGER(CONT)

Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.

WOODS

Yeah.  You figure out how to win the war

be sure to let us know.

CUT TO:

SOLDIER

Come on, Jaeger.  We're playing ball.

JAEGER

No that's okay.  I'm gonna...I'm doing some...

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

BUSH

This evening, as I report to you, the

military operation known as Desert Storm

enters its final phase.  The coalition

forces that face the tyranny of Saddam

Hussein have launched an all out ground

offensive...as this last, and most

critical part of the campaign begins I

ask for your prayers that God may bless

each and every one of the coalition

forces at our side in the Gulf, and that

He may continue to bless our nation, the

United States of America.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER(V.O.)

At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAEGER

They finally start the ground war, and

where are we?  Same place we've been

since we got here.  Securing freedom for

the dirt.

EPPS

Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it

this way:  At least you get to go home

alive.

JAEGER

I'd like to go home alive with a couple

of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.

WES

Hey, look at this!

WES{CONT)

They're surrendering to a news crew.  You

believe that?

JAEGER

That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours

into the war and it's over.

WES

Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What

kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

EPPS

A casual one.

WES

Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be

home in no time.

EPPS

Better grab up some sand to take home to

your family.

JAEGER

We...we could go home with something

else.

WES

What?

JAEGER

With...with millions.  Millions of

dollars.

EPPS

What are you talking about?

EPPS(CONT)

Don't even.  You're not going to show me

that tired map.

JAEGER

Wait.  Wait.

EPPS

I think you've got some issues to deal

with.  Really, when we get out of here

I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.

JAEGER

Just listen to me!  I've been doing some

reading.  In the Sixteenth century this

region was invaded by the Turks.  It

became part of the Ottoman empire.  When

the Turks rolled in they raped, they

pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who

had anything wanted to hide it from these

bastards.  They buried their treasures,

drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle

boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read

about it.

EPPS

(Sarcastic)

Wellllll, if you read it it must be true.

Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?

JAEGER

Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this

stuff.

WES

The Turks invaded, yeah. I guess people

would have hidden what they had.  But

that doesn't mean what was in that box

is--

JAEGER

Looks at this!  Look at it!  The drawing

is a map of this area right here.  You

can see it.  The geography, the

landmarks.  It's the same area.

EPPS

And you know what that area is?  It's

Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing

with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe

you've read about it.

JAEGER

What we're doing is kicking ass.  For

God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering

to news crews.  The war is over.  We've

just got to keep shooting people 'cause

the army spent all this money, and we've

got to put on a show for the taxpayers.

WES

You're not saying what I think you're

saying.  I can't believe you're even

thinking it.

JAEGER

It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf.

I got recon photos.  There're no troops

there, no fighting--

WES

You don't know where the Iraqis have

moved to.  And our forces haven't even

engaged the Republican Guard yet, we

don't know--

JAEGER

It's about a hundred miles from where we

are now.  How long do you think it would

take us to--

WES

It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred

miles through three different kinds of

terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a

river.  If the map is even real.

JAEGER

It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.

WES

So you just want to cross into hostile

territory in the middle of a war on a

wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him

it's crazy, Epps.

WES(CONT)

Epps, tell him.

WES

You're out of your minds, you know that?

Both of you.  You don't even know if

there's anything out there.  What the

hell are you thinking?

EPPS

I'm thinking about when this war is over.

Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got

tired of being president of GM?  If a

brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs

there aren't too many big money prospects

around, and I'm not particularly

interested in spending the rest of my

life fighting the oil companies' wars.

So I say if maybe there's something out

there, what the hell, that's what I say.

WES

It's desertion.

JAEGER

Deserting what?  What the hell are we

deserting?

EPPS

It's war.  People get lost all the time

in war, cut off--

JAEGER

We disappear for awhile.  We disappear,

we came back; nobody knows nothing.

EPPS

But we all got to be in for this.  We all

go, or we do nothing.

WES

Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I

understand, but you're smarter.

JAEGER

You know it's real.  You know it's real,

and you know it's there.  You know it.

WES

You're insane if you think you'll find

anything, and sure insane if you think

you can get us there and back alive.

EPPS

If you say that, then I say you don't

know Second Lieutenant Epps very well, do

you?

WES

God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I

don't.

JAEGER

Yes!

EPPS

It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all

right.

JAEGER

We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's

that easy.

WES

Yeah.  That easy.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EPPS

Now this is war.

JAEGER

Roger that.

WES

We're going to get court martialed, you

know that.

JAEGER

Hell, we'll just buy our way out.

EPPS

Hand me the navicom.

EPPS(CONT)

Hold on boys and girls...hold on...

EPPS(CONT)

Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land

of enchantment and riches.

WES

Oh, God.

JAEGER

You're such a pussy, you know that?

How'd you get in the army?

EPPS

Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?

WES

What?

EPPS

I know you think this is crazy, but a

couple of hours from now you're going to

be one rich dude trying to buy up every

other puzzle box out there.

WES

I'd settle for being alive.  Really.

Alive would be fine.

JAEGER

Epps, is that a sand dune.

WES

Oh, no.

EPPS

Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.

WES

No, please, not again.

CUT TO:

WES(VO)

Nooooooooo!

FADE TO:

WES(VO)

Came on, I'm serious.  Knock it off.

FADE TO:

WES(VO)

This isn't funny, all right?  I mean it.

CUT TO:

JAEGER

Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you

figure these people buried?

WES

If!  If there's a treasure.

JAEGER

Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you

figure it is?

WES

I don't know.  It would be small, easy to

transport and hide.  Gold or jewels.

Probably gold.

JAEGER

Yeah!  Gold!  How much?

WES

How the hell should I know how much?

EPPS

But that's the great thing about Gold.  A

little goes a long way.

JAEGER

You know what I'm doing with my part of

the gold?

WES

If there's gold.  If!

JAEGER

You know what I'm doing with my half?

EPPS

Third.  What you're going to do with your

third.

JAEGER

Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going

to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty-

three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out

and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.

EPPS

A car?  You're going to buy a car?

WES

This is too much.  You don't even have

the money and you're wasting it.

JAEGER

A car is not just a car where I come

from.  I had this friend, had this wicked

candy apple red Sixty-four and a half

Mustang--

EPPS

You're getting gold, and you're going to

blow it on wheels?

JAEGER

What are you going to do with your

third

?

EPPS

Invest it.

JAEGER

Oh, that's fun.

EPPS

It's not about being fun.  It's about

being smart.  You take that money, you

take care of it, let it grow, and you

don't ever have to do anything again.

Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm

talking about.

JAEGER

And I'm talking about enjoying myself.

EPPS

You know, you sound just like a boy who's

never--

WES

What's that?

EPPS

Take the binoculars.

JAEGER

Wh-what do you think--

EPPS

TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

JAEGER

Iraqis.

WES

Oh, God!

JAEGER

Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be

here.

WES

Oh, Jesus!

JAEGER

They're not...I had the pictures.

They're not supposed to be here!

EPPS

Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!

JAEGER

We've got to do something.  We've got to

turn around.

EPPS

We can see them, they can see us.  We

run, they chase.

WES

What are we going to do?

WES(CONT)

What are we going to do!?

EPPS

We're going to keep driving.

JAEGER

They'll shoot us!

EPPS

We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we

keep driving they might think we

friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know

we're Americans they might get scared,

think we're part of a detachment and keep

on going.

JAEGER

They're not going to--

EPPS

It's the only way.  We drive!

EPPS

Wave at them.  Don't look, just wave.

JAEGER

Yeah!  Yeah!

WES

I think I'm going to throw up.  I am.

I'm going to toss.

JAEGER

You see that?  Right by us.  They went

right by.  You had them Epps; you called

it.

EPPS

Figure they don't want to mess with us

anymore than we want to mess with them.

JAEGER

Look at you, not even breaking a sweat.

You're cool, boy.  You're cool.

WES

They stopped.

EPPS

Wha...

WES

Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.

WES(CONT)

They stopped, and they've turned around.

JAEGER

Go, go, go!

EPPS

Shoot them!

EPPS(CONT)

Shoot 'em!

JAEGER

Steady it out!

EPPS

I steady it out, they blow us out of the

sand!

JAEGER

I got him!  You see that, I nailed him!

EPPS

Damn it!

EPPS(CONT)

Wes, take the wheel.

EPPS(CONT)

Take it!

EPPS(CONT)

Keep it steady.

EPPS(CONT)

Damn it!  I said keep it steady.

WES

Shoot...shoot!

WES

SHOOT!

WES

I thought we were dead.

JAEGER

Yeah, well, we're not.

WES

We got to get out of here.

WES(CONT)

We have to go back.

JAEGER

We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we

get what we came for.

WES

(Incredulous)

We just about got killed.  You know what

happened?  We just about got killed, and

you want to go on?

EPPS

Jaeger, go check out the Hummer for

damage.

WES

You're crazy, you know that?  You're

insane!

WES(CONT)

You know that, right?  You know he's

sick?

EPPS

They shouldn't have been here.

WES

We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There

is a war going on!

EPPS

This is miles from the battle lines.

They were probably deserters.

WES

Deserters would have run, they wouldn't

have engaged.

EPPS

They shouldn't have been out this way,

that's all I'm saying.

WES

We're not going back, are we?

WES(CONT)

You bastard!  You're trying to get us

killed.

EPPS

I'm trying to get us paid.  I'm trying to

get us all paid!  As long as there's a

chance something is out there we go on.

There's not going to be anymore trouble.

If there is, we go back, but there won't

be.

EPPS(CONT)

You'll feel different after we find the

treasure.  Money has away of making

people feel different.

EPPS

She okay?

JAEGER

Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.

EPPS

Let's go.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

EPPS

What?

JAEGER

I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest

of the boys knew what we're doing.  I

mean if they knew what we were coming

back with.

EPPS

You can't tell anybody about this.

JAEGER

I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they

knew.  We're going to be millionaires,

man.  Millionaires!

EPPS

It'd make their heads explode.

JAEGER

Millionaires, man.

JAEGER(CONT}

You know we're going to be rich.  Admit

it.  You know.  Come on, admit it.

JAEGER(CONT)

Ahh, there it is.  There it is.  You know

it.

EPPS

Money, money, money, money...MONEY.

EPPS/JAEGER

Money, money, money, money...MONEY.

WES

What are you doing.

EPPS

Low on gas.  Got to refill.

EPPS(O.C.)

Jaeger...JAEGER!

EPPS

Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell.

It's been leaking gas since the fire

fight.  I told you to check for damage.

JAEGER

...I know.

EPPS

And you missed this?  How are you going

to miss something like this?

JAEGER

I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew

one of the reserves got hit you'd want to

turn back.

WES

So, you just let us drive on knowing we

were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going

to run low in the middle of nowhere?

JAEGER

...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

WES

...You stupid son of a bitch.

EPPS

Get off him.

EPPS(CONT)

You two fighting's not going to get us

anything.

WES

Him getting us stranded out here doesn't

do much good either.

JAEGER

We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas

in the other reserve to get us back.

WES

Then lets go back while we still can.

JAEGER

As soon as we hit the mountain we would

have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not

that far.  We can make it.

EPPS

What do we do with the Humvee?

JAEGER

We leave it.

WES

What if someone takes it?

JAEGER

Who?  Who's going to take it.  We mark

the location with the navicom, we can

come right back to this spot.

WES

You two don't even know how crazy you

are.  You want to go on your sick, little

treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me

absent.

JAEGER

You have to go with us, Wes.

WES

Really?  What is that, an order,

private

?

JAEGER

You have to go with us.  You can't walk

back...

JAEGER{CONT)

And you sure as hell aren't going to

drive.

EPPS

Load what you can; water, tools, weapons.

Anything you think we might need.

JAEGER

Who's he kidding?  He wants it as bad as

we do.  We're going to be fat, Epps.  As

soon as we get back to Saudivillie you

and me are going to--

EPPS

We're going to keep going 'cause I want

some of whatever's out there.  But you

ever pull something like trying to get my

ass stranded out here again, and I'll

kill you myself.  You got that?

EPPS(CONT)

SAY IT!

JAEGER

I got that...sir.

CUT TO:

JAEGER

Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to

go so fast.

EPPS

Faster we get there, faster we get back.

JAEGER

Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.

JAEGER(CONT)

I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a

little water.

EPPS

Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you

aren't getting any of ours.

JAEGER

I'm just going to have a little sip,

that's all.  Just a sip.

JAGER{CONT)

Wait for me!

EPPS

You can catch up.

JAEGER

Yeah...I'm right behind you.

WES

Thanks for straightening out Jaeger.

EPPS

Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But

if we do it, we do it right.  I just

needed to explain that in a way I

wouldn't have to do it again.

WES

Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an

idiot.

EPPS

He's not so--

WES

He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as

hard as he thinks.

EPPS

How tough you have to be to make the

army?  All you've got to do is shoot a

gun, and stop a bullet.

WES

Look at him.  We ought to just leave him

behind.

WES(CONT)

Like he said:  People get lost in wars

all the time.  And out here?  Out here

there are eight million ways to die.

EPPS

Okay, so he was riding you.  Get over it.

WES

I'm just talking.

JAEGER

Can't even slow up for me.  Wasn't for me

they wouldn't even be here.  I'm the one

that found the map.  Should have just

come by myself.  Should've.  Shouldn't

even cut them in.  Shouldn't.

JAEGER

Epps...

JAEGER(CONT)

Epps!

EPPS

What!?

JAEGER

Mine.

EPPS

What?

JAEGER

Mine.  Land mine!

JAEGER(CONT)

I stepped on a land mine!

EPPS

You didn't step on any mine.

JAEGER

I heard it click.

EPPS

If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by

now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines

anymore.

JAEGER

I heard it.

WES

Maybe it's just a can, or something.

JAEGER

JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE.

SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE!

EPPS

Paranoid, that's your problem.  You're

just paranoid.  Why'd the paranoid one

have to find the map?

JAEGER

Oh, God!  Oh God!

EPPS

Just be cool.

JAEGER

It's a mine, isn't it?

EPPS

Just relax.

JAEGER

How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?

EPPS

We're going to get off, all right.  We'll

get you off of there.  Just...be cool.

JAEGER

Where you going?

EPPS

Me and Wes are just going to talk.

JAEGER

Why you got to move away to talk!?

EPPS

We're going to be right over here.

JAEGER

You're moving away because it's going to

blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow

up!

EPPS

I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

WES

What kind of mine?

EPPS

I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess

with it.

WES

Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse,

that's Vietnam stuff.

EPPS

Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford,

okay?  Maybe they got it on discount.

Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe

it's going to go off in two seconds, and

we won't have to worry about getting

Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to

worry about is finding the pieces.

JAEGER

Epps...

WES

Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be

able to get him off it anyway.

EPPS

There's a way.

JAEGER

Epps...

WES

Can't do it.  Can't do it, and keep him

alive.

EPPS

I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.

JAEGER

Epps, my leg is falling asleep.

EPPS

(To Wes)

We've got rope?

WES

For climbing.

EPPS

Break it out.

JAEGER

My leg is falling asleep.

EPPS

It's not falling asleep.  You've only

been standing there for three minutes.

JAEGER

I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's

falling asleep.

EPPS

It falls asleep and you die, so wake it

the hell up.

JAEGER

How's this going to work?

EPPS

Me and Wes each going take an end of the

rope, run our asses of, and yank you off

the mine.

JAEGER

That's going to do it, right?  I'm going

to be okay.

EPPS

You're going to be fine.

JAEGER

You're not going to let me die, are you!?

Don't let me die!

EPPS

When we start running suck up your

breath.  You're going to get the wind

knocked out of you.

JAEGER

Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to

die.

WES

What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to

bounce right up out of the ground,

explode in the air, kill him and us.

EPPS

You just go when I say go.

WES

Should have at least gotten the map off

of him.  Blows up with him then we did

all this for nothing.

EPPS

Ready?

WES

Yeah.

EPPS

GO!

JAEGER

Oh, God.  Oh, God!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAEGER

I'm all right.  Oh, Jesus, I'm all right.

WES

The map okay?

CUT TO:

WES

How long we going to keep this up.

JAEGER

Until we're out of the mine field is how

long.

WES

Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.

JAEGER

That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could

have just spread them out like that; make

us think we're in the clear.

WES

You want to crawl, crawl.

JAEGER

You're going to blow yourselves up.

EPPS

Wes is right.  If there were any more

mines we would have found them.  Hell,

that one you stepped on was probably old

anyway; left over from the war with Iran.

JAEGER

You don't know that.  It could be a trick.

EPPS

If we step on a mine we'll know it was.

Let me see the maps.

EPPS(CONT)

Get up and give me the maps.

EPPS(CONT)

We're on course.  Northeast, twenty-eight

degrees.  When we hit the base of the

mountain we'll find a pass.  I can see it

on the recon photo.  Shouldn't be too

hard to traverse.  That'll take us to the

top and...

EPPS

This.  Whatever it is.

JAEGER

It's the treasure, that's what it is.

WES

It better be.

JAEGER

The map.

JAEGER(CONT)

The map.

EPPS

You're not losing trust, are you?

JAEGER

Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang

on to it.

WES

If all we wanted was the map out of you

we could have taken it while you were

standing on that mine pissing on

yourself.

JAEGER

Probably would've too if Epps wasn't

around to stop you.

EPPS

I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause

nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in

this together, understand?

JAEGER

Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to

come along in the first place, but he

gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet

deal.

WES

I'm getting tired of you riding me,

Jaeger.

JAEGER

Anytime you want to do something about it

just let--

EPPS

Quiet!

JAEGER

I don't hear any--

EPPS

Shut up and listen!

WES

Gunfire.

EPPS

Don't!

JAEGER

It's a fire fight.

EPPS

Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight.

That's not a battle going on.

WES

What is it?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAEGER

What is it?

EPPS

Iraqis.  A bunch of them.

JAEGER

What are they doing here?

EPPS

Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm

guessing that has something to do with

them being here.

JAEGER

What are they doing in the middle of

nowhere?

WES

Maybe they're looking for gold.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAEGER

Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for?

They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing

Iraqis?

WES

Those people down there are Shi'ites.

You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq

and Khurds in the North.  Neither of

them've got much love for Saddam.

Probably figured once the war started

there might be an uprising, so he sent

his soldiers out to slap them around some.

EPPS

They're doing more than slapping.

JAEGER

The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't

know that.

WES

Is there anything you do know?

JAEGER

I know you're a pussy.  I know that.

EPPS

All right.  Let's get out of here.

WES

The soldiers are going to kill those

people!

JAEGER

So?

WES

We have to do something.

EPPS

There's nothing we can do.

WES

We can fight.  That's what we're here

for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the

Shi'ites, and the Khurds.

JAGER

I didn't sign up to help any Shi'ites.

All we were supposed to do is get the

Iraqis out of Kuwait, and if we aren't

doing that then all bets are off.

EPPS

We carrying any ordinance?

WES

Some extra grenades.  A Claymore.

EPPS

Not enough.  We're out numbered and out

gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.

JAEGER

So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for

playing.  We have some lovely parting

gifts for you as you go.

WES

We're American soldiers.  We don't

abandon people.

JAEGER

Funny you should say that while we're out

looking for gold.

WES

You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so

bad.

JAEGER

I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich.

The only way the Iraqis figure into that

is not at all.

EPPS

(To Wes)

I don't want to see people killed any

more than you.  But we try to help out we

die, and all we do is die.

WES

We can't just go off and--

EPPS

There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't

even be here in the first place.

CUT TO:

JAEGER

This is it.  We're right on target.

EPPS

All we've got to do is make it to the

top.

WES

And find the treasure, and get it, and

get back to the Humvee, and get the hell

out of Iraqi without getting our heads

blown off, but that's about it.

EPPS

We're not going to find anything standing

here.  Let's get to climbing.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

EPPS

Not much of a pass.

WES

Probably was a couple of hundred years

ago when whoever drew the map came

through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

EPPS

Picks up again just on the other side.

JAEGER

Think we can make it?

WES

We make it, or we go back empty handed.

EPPS

Looks like we make it.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

WES

The US Army:  Always an adventure.

EPPS

Let me see the map.

EPPS(CONT)

Should be easy going from here.  Stay on

the pass straight to the dot.

WES

What do you figure it to be?

EPPS

Got to be some kind of landmark;

something distinctive.

JAEGER

X marks the spot.

EPPS

Something like that.

JAEGER

But the white dot in the middle; that's

got to mean something.

EPPS

I hope it means something, otherwise...

WES

Otherwise whatever we're looking for

could be anywhere.

EPPS

Basically.  But the map has been pretty

precise so far.  I don't think it'll be

too hard to--

EPPS(CONT)

Take cover!

EPPS(CONT)

Let's hit 'em!

EPPS(CONT)

Cover me.

EPPS(CONT)

Clear.

WES

Where'd they go?

EPPS

I don't know.  There's a lot of space up

here.  They could be just about--

WES

Weird they didn't chase us.

JAEGER

Maybe they're as scared of us as we are

of them.

WES

Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

EPPS

What's weird is how they disappeared.

Doesn't make sense.  Doesn't...

EPPS(CONT)

Scatter!

JAEGER

Where is it?  Where'd it go?

EPPS

Stay low.

JAEGER

Where the hell is it!?

EPPS

Just stay down.

JAEGER

What are we going to do?  What the hell

are we going to do?

EPPS

We're not going to do anything.

JAEGER

(Panicked)

They're going to kill us!

EPPS

They can't shoot us in here.

WES

And they can't fly around out there

forever.

EPPS

So we wait.

JAEGER

If they land--

EPPS

If they land, we can take them.  If they

don't land, then we've got nothing to

worry about.

WES

Missile!

EPPS

Move!

JAEGER

Epps!

WES

They want us to surrender.

EPPS

Yeah, I'll surrender.

EPPS(CONT)

Get down!

JAEGER

Oh, God...

WES

Yeah.  Just keeps getting better and

better, doesn't it?

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

WES

What do you think?

JAEGER

Lines up with the map and the photos.

EPPS

We're right where we should be.

EPPS(CONT)

I sure don't see much place else around

here to hide anything.

WES

Can't see anything.

WES(CONT)

It's got a bottom.

JAEGER

Guess we know what the next stop is.

EPPS

All right.  Let's break out some utility

shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case

we have to do any blasting.  Me and

Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can

see.

WES

What am I supposed to do?

EPPS

Got to have someone here in case we need

help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to

have a look out either.

JAEGER

Think there might be more Iraqis?

EPPS

Right now I wouldn't be surprised if

Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The

Clowns.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WES

You down?

JAEGER

Yeah, we're down.

WES

What do you see?

EPPS

Nothing.

EPPS(CONT)

A whole lot of nothing.

JAEGER

So where do we start?

EPPS

Wherever you want.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

WES

Hey...Hey!  Sun's going down.  Epps!

Jaeger!  It's getting dark up here.

CUT TO:

WES(O.C.)

Epps!

EPPS

I heard!

CUT TO:

WES

There's nothing down there.

CUT TO:

EPPS

What are you doing?

JAEGER

What does it look like I'm doing?

EPPS

It looks like you're not doing anything.

JAEGER

I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything,

because there's nothing down here.

EPPS

Get up and dig.

JAEGER

We've been digging.  We've been digging

for hours.  If there was anything here to

find we would have found it.

EPPS

Get up off your ass and dig!

JAEGER

What's the point?  There's nothing here.

The map's a fake.  Christ, even I see

that now.  We're just wasting our time.

We might as well give up and--

EPPS

You listen to me.  The whole reason we're

here is because of you and that map of

yours.  I didn't do all this for nothing,

and I'm not leaving with nothing.  If you

think for a second I'm giving up just

'cause you're too tired to turn over some

dirt, then you don't know John Epps too

well, do you?  So you dig, and you keep

on digging 'til I say you don't have to

dig anymore.

CUT TO:

WES

What are you doing...?  What the hell are

you doing down there?

CUT TO:

JAEGER

Must be a compartment.

EPPS

I feel air.  Probably opens up outside

somewhere.  That's where the light comes

from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.

JAEGER

The white dot; light in the dark.

JAEGER (CONT)

Maybe we should blast it loose with the

claymore.

EPPS

It's giving.

JAEGER

Jesus Christ!

EPPS

No, don't shoot!

EPPS

It's just a mongoose.

JAEGER

Is it dead?

EPPS

Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

CUT TO:

WES

What the hell are you doing!?

CUT TO:

JAEGER

I think we found something.

CUT TO:

WES

What is it?  What'd you find?

CUT TO:

EPPS

Gold.  It's gold.

JAEGER

IT'S GOLD!

CUT TO:

WES

Gold...

CUT TO:

JAEGER

It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And

it's heavier than I imagined.

EPPS

I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this.

Not in my whole life did I ever imagine

this.

JAEGER

You don't have to imagine it.  Not

anymore.  Now all you've got to think up

is what it's going to buy you.

EPPS

Wes!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EPPS

Wes, thrown down a pack.

EPPS(CONT)

I don't think the line will take the

weight of a man and the coins.

(Yelling up.)

Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me

and Jaeger'll climb back.

WES(O.C.)

Ready when you are.

JAEGER

Wait.

EPPS

What?

EPPS(CONT)

What?

JAEGER

We send the gold up what's to stop him

from taking off and leaving us down here?

EPPS

He's not going to leave us.

JAEGER

What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All

he has to do is cut the line...

WES

You ready?

EPPS

(To Jaeger)

All right.  I'll go up, then you send up

the gold and--

JAEGER

Why do I have to stay down here?

EPPS

Jesus, Jaeger.

JAEGER

I don't see how that plan's any better.

EPPS

Someone's got to send the gold up.  It

can't get on the line by itself.

JAGER

Why's it got to be me?

WES

What are you doing?  You ready?

EPPS

All right.  You go up, I'll send up the

gold, then follow.

JAEGER

Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.

EPPS

If you're even thinking about leaving me

down here, you better think again.

JAEGER

Wes, I'm coming up.

EPPS

Okay!

EPPS(CONT)

Wes?  Jaeger?

EPPS(CONT)

Jaeger?

EPPS(CONT)

Jaeger!?

CUT TO:

EPPS

What the hell took so long.

JAEGER

Just had to get the pack unhooked from

the line.  It didn't seem that long.

EPPS

Not when you're up here with the gold, I

guess not.

WES

Not losing trust, are you?

EPPS

It'll be too dark to make our way back

now.  Let's bed down for the night and

head out at first light.

WES

What about the gold?

EPPS

What about it?

WES

Maybe we should split it up now.

EPPS

We started this together, and we're

staying together, so there's no point in

splitting things up now.

WES

What if we get separated?  Way I see it

if something happens I want to be

carrying my share.

JAEGER

Wes might be right about that.

EPPS

It stays as it is.  We're halfway home

now.  Let's not blow it by people getting

ideas.

WES

You're the one with all the ideas.

EPPS

You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

WES

Maybe you've got ideas of your own for

the gold.  Maybe you've already got

things worked out.

EPPS

Maybe I do.

WES

Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I

can do better on my own.

WES(CONT)

You got no reason to do that!

EPPS

I told you:  When I straighten someone

out they stay straightened.  This is how

it works:  Nobody touches the gold.

Except when we're on the move and

someone's carrying it, nobody so much as

opens the pack to get an eyeful of it.

Agreed?

JAEGER

Yeah.  Sure.  That sounds like a plan to

me.

WES

You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting

tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.

EPPS

Then get up and do something about it.

EPPS(CONT)

Then just lay there and bleed.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

WES

Stay down.  Stay the hell down, or I will

rip your stinking head off!

JAGER

What the hell?

WES

I caught him!  I caught him trying to

steal the gold.

EPPS

Get off him.

WES

(Slightly crazed)

He snuck in here thinking we were asleep,

only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit

our throats if I hadn't stopped him.

EPPS

Get off him!

EPPS(CONT)

What happened?

WES

I told you.  He tried to steal our gold.

He tried to kill us.

JAEGER

With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.

WES

He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a

weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare

hands.

WES(CONT)

Shut up!

EPPS

Stop it!

WES

I told you; don't push me around.

EPPS

Tell me what he's saying.

WES

Says he's one of the soldiers that was in

the helicopter.

JAEGER

He lived through that?

WES

Says they were deserters, they were

afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam

anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to

hide out.  When they saw us they figured

we were going to kill them, so they shot

first.

EPPS

Why'd he come in our camp.

WES

Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted

the gold.

EPPS

How's he going to want the gold?  He

couldn't even know we had it.

WES

He...he could have been watching us.

JAEGER

Maybe we should give him some water.

WES

All last night he could have been--

JAEGER

I think he wants something to drink.

WES

I'm not wasting my water on him.

WES(CONT)

I don't care what he says, he wanted our

gold.  Would have slit our throats if he

had the chance.

EPPS

Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he

didn't get it.  We've got no need staying

around here.  It's light enough.  Let's

pack up and head out.

WES

What about him?  We...we have to do

something.

WES(CONT)

We can't just leave him.  He'll run back

to his outfit, report our position...

EPPS

You said he was a deserter.

WES

That's what he says.  He could be a spy,

or something.

EPPS

You don't know that.

WES

You don't know he isn't.

JAEGER

So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til

we get back to the Hummer.

WES

He'd just slow us down, and drink our

water.  And if we ran into any more

Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.

EPPS

We don't leave him, we don't take him

with us.  What does that leave?

EPPS(CONT)

You're out of your mind.

WES

He's an enemy soldier.

EPPS

I'm not going to let you kill him.

WES

We're at war.

EPPS

We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger

are AWOL.  We have no authority--

WES

He tried to kill us.  If not just now,

then in the helicopter.  That's all the

authority I need.

JAEGER

We don't need to do this.  We got the

gold, all right?  Let's just get out of

here.

WES

I'm not going to leave him be just so he

can stab us in the backs the minute we

turn around.  I have been through too

much to lose it all now just because the

two of you don't have the stomach to do

what has to be done.

EPPS

I've got no stomach for murder.

WES

It's a combat action.

EPPS

It's murder, and I won't be any part of

it.

WES

Then step aside.

EPPS

No.

WES

Get out of my way.

JAEGER

For Christ's sake, we don't need this.

Let's just go.  Let's just...let's just

get out of here.

WES

Shut up!  Shut the hell up!

JAGER

He's getting away!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WES

I had to.  You saw how he ran.  Would

have given us away.  I had to.

JAEGER

Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him.

Say some words over him.

WES

You want to say some words?

WES(CONT)

Go to hell.  How are those words?

CUT TO:

EPPS

We should head Northeast.

JAEGER

Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer;

further into Iraqi.

EPPS

There's another pass on the photo.  We

can avoid that narrow one we had to cross

on the way up, and it should get us back

down.

JAEGER

It should, or it will?  Least going back

the way we came we know what we're up

against.

EPPS

You think you can make that pass weighted

down when you almost fell the first time

you're wrong, and you're not going to

take my share of the gold with you trying

it.  We're heading Northeast.

WES

You've got an awful lot of orders in you.

Always giving orders.

EPPS

I out rank you, that's why.

WES

In the service you do, but we're not

particularly in the service right now.

Way I see it, what we're doing, that

doesn't particularly give you the right

to toss orders around.

EPPS

We been down this road.  I told you how

it is.  Unless you feel like there's

something you want to do about it...

WES

What if I do?

WES(CONT)

What if I do?

WES(CONT)

You talk loud, and don't even have a big

stick to back it up with.

EPPS

Something happens to me I let go of this

grenade.  I go, and I take the navicom

with me.  And how do you suppose you're

going to find your way back to the Hummer,

when you won't even know what's up or

down.  It's a big country, and you could

be heading for the allies, or wandering

right into Bhagdad.  That's if you don't

die of thirst before you even get that

far.  How you like my stick now?

JAEGER

Why don't you put the gun down, all

right, Wes?  You put the gun down and

Epps'll put the pin back in the grenade.

Won't you Epps?

WES

I'm starting to think you're a real

bitch, you know that?

FADE TO:

JAEGER

You're going to burn up in those.

WES

The white reflects the sun; it keeps you

cooler.  That's why they wear them.

JAEGER

Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

WES

Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest.

Murderers.

EPPS

(Pointed)

Murder, or a combat action?  It's hard to

tell them apart?

WES

You saw how he ran didn't you?  First

chance he got he ran out.  Would have

gone straight to his CO, told him all

about the gold.  What do you think would

have happened then, huh?  Then what do

you think would have happened?  Two

thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on

us.  You ought to thank me for killing

him.  I'll get a medal for it.  Watch and

see if I don't get a medal.

EPPS

What the hell...?

EPPS(CONT)

Help!  Help me!

EPPS(CONT)

Help me!

EPPS(CONT)

For Christ's Sake, Jaeger!  Help me!

Help me!

JAEGER

Wes...Wes!

EPPS

The navicom!

JAEGER

What are we going to do?  How are we

going to find our way back!?

EPPS

We'll find our way.

JAEGER

How!?

EPPS

We'll find our way!  We'll...

WES

No navicom.  A lot of good you are now,

Epps.

EPPS

Lot of good you were when I was sinking

in the sand.

WES

Without that navicam looks to me like you

forfeit the right to be in charge.

EPPS

And let me guess who is.

WES

I'm the one's got the big stick.

EPPS

Suppose I don't go for that?

WES

Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and

I suppose I'd have to kill you.

(Beat)

I suppose.

EPPS

What about Jaeger?

WES

Nothing about him, unless he's got a

problem about me dealing with you.

JAEGER

Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps.

JAEGER(CONT}

I mean, in principle.

WES

{Sneering)

You know, Jaeger, you really are a bitch.

WES(CONT)

You die!

EPPS

We got to go back.  We got to go back for

Wes.

JAEGER

Forget Wes.

EPPS

We can't just leave him.

JAEGER

Wes is dead!

EPPS

What if he's not?

JAEGER

Then he will be when those Iraqis get to

him.  He was going to kill you.  He was

one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps,

and I'm sure as hell not getting my head

blow off over his carcass.

JAEGER(CONT)

It's a helicopter.

JAGER(CONT)

There.

JAEGER(CONT)

Ours, or theirs?

JAEGER(CONT)

Ours, or theirs?

EPPS

Ours.  It's one of ours.  We've got to

signal them; let them know we're down

here.

JAEGER

No.

EPPS

We need something:  A flare, a signal

mirror.

JAEGER

No.

EPPS

What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.

JAEGER(CONT)

They'll ask questions; want to know why

we were out here.

EPPS

We'll lie.

JAEGER

They'll search the pack.

JAEGER(CONT)

They'll find the gold.

EPPS

We're lost, you understand that?  We've

got no navicom, and no means to find a

way back.  So right now I don't give a

damn about the gold because if we don't

get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all

it's going to be good for is buying us

tombstones.

JAEGER

I can't do it, Epps.  Not when we're so

close.  I can't let you ruin everything.

EPPS

First Wes, now you?

JAEGER

I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.

EPPS

(Sarcastic)

And you; you've got it all together.

JAEGER

I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't

kill you just to kill you, but I can't

let you lose the gold for me.  Not when

we're so close.

EPPS

That helicopter passes, and the only

thing we're close to is death.

JAEGER

Sit down, Epps.

JAEGER(CONT)

I'm sorry about that, Epps.

EPPS

Is it all right if I stand up?

JAEGER

Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.

JAEGER(CONT)

I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm

glad it didn't come to that.

EPPS

Yeah.  Well, me too.

JAEGER

I never killed anybody before.  I talk a

good game, but I'm not like that.

EPPS

Sure.

JAEGER

Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was

talking I wanted to blow away all those

Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I

was scared out of my mind to go to war.

I still haven't gotten over stepping on

that land mine.

EPPS

You still got a map on you?

JAEGER

What?  Yeah.

JAEGER(CONT)

Epps?

EPPS

Yeah.

JAEGER

I don't want to die.

EPPS

Makes two of us.

JAEGER

I know what I did just now was crazy, but

you got to understand how much I want

that gold.

EPPS

It's all right.  I don't like it, but

it's over now.

JAEGER

I never had anything before, Epps.  I

never was anybody.  Not the kind of

somebody you can be with a pocket full of

gold coins.  When I was in high school I

used to--

EPPS

Hey, you know what?  Can I be honest with

you?  Right now I'm not all that

interested in how you're messed up 'cause

you didn't get the bicycle you wanted for

your thirteenth birthday.  What I'm

interested in is how I can keep from

getting dead.  And listening to sob

stories from some           about how the

system wasn't good to him because he had

to work like everybody else instead of

being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn

thing to help keep me alive.  So do me a

favor; either shut up, or...just shut up.

JAEGER

Sorry.

EPPS

Damn.

JAEGER

What do you think our chances are?

EPPS

If we can find the Hummer, or some

friendlies by sundown we might be okay.

We've got enough water for that.  But we

won't make another day otherwise.

JAEGER

Wonder how the war's going?

EPPS

It's got to be going better than this..

EPPS{CONT)

All right.  pick a direction.

EPPS(CONT)

We can't just sit here.  We've got to

start moving, so pick.

JAEGER

You sure you want me too?

JAEGER(CONT)

I pick that way.

EPPS

Okay.  Then we go this way.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER

Getting cold.

EPPS

It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at

night; they get cold.

JAEGER

Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a

second.

EPPS

No!

JAEGER

Just let me rest for a second.

EPPS

We've got to keep moving while there's

still light.

JAEGER

You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just

going to take a second.  I want to look

at the gold.

EPPS

Don't you touch it.

JAEGER

I just want to look at it.  Remind me of

what I'm dying for.

EPPS

The deal was no one touches it until we

get out of here.

JAEGER

Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was

still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new

deal.

EPPS

You listen to me.  If,

if

we get out of

this I don't care what you do with your

share, but until then you've only got one

thing to think about and that's staying

alive.  So you leave that gold alone, or

you and I are going to have to have a

serious talk.

JAEGER

Look.

JAEGER(CONT)

What do you figure it is?

EPPS

Place all alone like that?  Must be a

boarder check point.

JAEGER

Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?

EPPS

Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone

that far north.  It's got to be Saudi.

Come on.

EPPS(CONT}

They've got to have water.  We'll get

same water, some directions, maybe they

even have a vehicle.

JAEGER

Epps.

EPPS

We can head back for our lines, and they

don't even have to know about the gold.

JAEGER

Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.

JAEGER(CONT)

If it's a checkpoint, it could be Iraqi.

EPPS

We've got no cboice.  Either way, we've

got no choice.

JAEGER

Well?

EPPS

Well, we should identify ourselves.

JAEGER

Yeah, I guess we should.

EPPS

Even if they are Iraqis probably all

they'll do is take us prisoner for

awhile.  Got to figure we're still

kicking their asses in the war.  They

don't want any trouble.

JAEGER

Hell, they'll probably just surrender to

us.  Probably.

EPPS

That's if the war is even still going on.

Way things were shaping up it's probably

long over.

JAEGER

Probably.

EPPS

Hellooooo--

JAEGER

Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib!  Ashra Ka

mahari dahra sahib!

EPPS

What did you say?

JAEGER

I don't know.  Something Wes had taught

me.  I think it means "Don't shoot.

We're your friends."

EPPS

They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi

checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on.

Come on!

JAGER

Oh, man, this is good.  What do you think

the chances are they've got a whirlpool

in this place?

JAEGER(CONT)

Oh, God...

EPPS

They must have thought we were Iraqi when

you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell

in the dark.

JAEGER

What are we going to do?

EPPS

Slip out your M-16.

JAEGER

And then what?

EPPS

And then shoot them.

JAEGER

I...I never killed anyone before.  I told

you that.

EPPS

Well, you're going to start with a bang,

'cause you've got four of them to take down.

JAEGER

Can't you--

EPPS

I don't have a weapon.

EPPS(CONT)

Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going

to kill me.  Kill them!

JAEGER

I just said I would.  I don't think I--

EPPS

Shoot them!

EPPS(CONT)

Shoot them, Jaeger!  SHOOT THEM!

EPPS(CONT)

Let's get some sleep.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER

Epp...Epps!  There's someone at the

window!

EPPS

An Iraqi?

JAEGER

I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform

on.  He...he had on white robes, like the

guys who killed Wes.

JAGER(CONT)

See anything?

EPPS

Nothing.

JAEGER

What do we do?

EPPS

We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't

an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of

time before some show up.  Get all the

water you can carry, and we'll head out

on foot.

JAEGER

To where?

EPPS

Sun rises in the East.  We go the

opposite direction.  May not find

anything, but at least we'll know we're

heading towards Saudi Arabia.

EPPS(CONT)

Ready?

JAEGER

Look!

JAEGER(CONT)

What do we do?

EPPS

We keep going, that's what we do.  We

ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

JAEGER

Jesus!  How many of them are there?

EPPS

I don't like this.  Let's go.

CUT TO:

JAEGER

What do you make of them?

EPPS

Shi'ites, I think.

JAEGER

Is that good, or bad?

EPPS

I don't know.  They killed Wes.

JAEGER

Why haven't they killed us!?

EPPS

I don't know!

JAEGER

...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way

out.

EPPS

With what?  Against how many?

JAEGER

We can't just sit here waiting to die.

EPPS

You come up with a better plan, let me

know.

JAEGER

Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold.

If we gave it to them they might let us

live; they might not kill us.

VOICE(O.C.)

I always knew you were a bitch.

EPPS

...Wes...?

JAEGER

You were shot.  We were standing right

there, you were shot!

WES

In the flack jacket.  Still like getting

hit in the back with a baseball bat.

Took the air right out of me, but I was

just unconscious for awhile.  'Course,

you didn't stick around to find that out.

You left me for dead.

EPPS

We thought--

WES

YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!

WES(CONT)

When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had

shot an American they were very

apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking

ass in this little war.  They figure

we've finally gotten Saddam off their

backs.  They brought me to their camp,

cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new

best buddy.  America number one, Joe.

But there's something the Shi'ites can't

figure out:  They can't figure out why my

two buddies, two fellow Americans, left

me out in the desert.  They can't seem to

figure out what those same two guys were

doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost

as if they were Iraqi spies, or

something.  And I've got to tell you they

hate anything that's got to do with the

Iraqis.  See how I mean?

JAEGER

We had to take shelter in the checkpoint.

Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.

WES

You actually got around to killing

someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're

only half a bitch.

EPPS

Wes, we thought you were dead, and we

thought we were next.  Hanging around to

get killed wouldn't have done anyone any

good.

WES

Sure, and I guess it was just convenient

there was one less person to split the

gold with.

EPPS

Wes--

WES

Look, I know you guys are telling the

truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know

that.  I guess you could tell them...but

then you don't speak the language do you?

WES{CONT)

Do you!?

WES{CONT)

They're going to kill you slow.  I'll see

to that.

WES(CONT)

Thanks for taking care of this for me.

EPPS

Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy,

greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says

you're crazy.

JAEGER

I didn't say that.  I never said--

EPPS

Me?  I say you don't have enough brains

to be stupid.

WES

You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured

you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I

had respect for you.

EPPS

That why you tried to put a bullet in my

head in the middle of the desert.

WES

That's just what things came to.

Sometimes you can't help that.  It

doesn't change me respecting you.  And

now you let me down.  I expected more

from you, you know?  I really did.  I

expected you to--

EPPS

You expect this?

EPPS(CONT)

Get the gold!

EPPS(CONT)

(To Wes)

Now let's try things another way.  Let's

try this:  You and me and Jaeger are

going to walk out of here.  We're going

to walk out all smiling and friendly so

your little Shi'ite buddies won't suspect

a thing.  Then we're going to hop on some

horses, and ride away, and live happily

ever after.  It's all going to happen

just like that, because if it doesn't

then I'm going to gut you like a fat pig.

You understand me...soldier?

EPPS(CONT)

I'll take that as a yes.

EPPS(CONT)

Get the water.

WES

They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten

feet before they cut you down.

EPPS

You don't know John Epps very well, do

you?

JAEGER

Can you ride a horse?

EPPS

No, but I figure now's a real good time

to start.

EPPS(CONT)

Don't say anything.

EPPS(CONT)

Just keep quiet.

WES

I have to answer him.

EPPS

So you can give us away?

WES

If I don't answer, he'll know something's

up.

EPPS

You answer him, but you answer him wrong

and you're going to be staring at your

insides while you're dying.

EPPS(CONT)

Bastard!

WES

Stop them!

JAEGER

They coming?

EPPS

Oh, yeah.  They're coming.

EPPS(CONT)

Ride for the hills.  We'll try to lose

them.

JAEGER

We lost them!

JAEGER(CONT)

Which way?

JAEGER(CONT)

Which way do we go!?

EPPS

We go this way.

EPPS(CONT)

Jaeger!

give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their

WES

The gold; give it to me.

WES(CONT)

Give it to me!

EPPS

If I give it to you, will you let us go?

WES

Sure.  Whatever you want.  For old time

sake.

WES(CONT)

Looks like at the end of the day we

finally find out who's better than who,

don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected

more from you.

EPPS

It's like I said; you don't really know

lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

EPPS(CONT)

Damn it.  We lost the horses.

JAEGER

The...the gold...

EPPS

It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore

mine.  The gold's in my pack.

JAEGER

When did you make the switch?

EPPS

It's always been like that.  When you

left me down in the crevice to send the

gold up I figured I'd better...take

precautions.  I rigged it to blow if

anyone opened the pack.  Just in case

somebody thought they could do better on

their own.

JAEGER

But...

EPPS

We had a deal.  No one touches the gold

until we're out of here.  No one breaks

the deal, no one had anything to worry

about.

JAEGER

What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I

mean, accidently, what if I had...

EPPS

You shouldn't think about things like

that.  It'll just make you crazy.

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

JAEGER

Well?

EPPS

A car's got to come along sooner or

later.  When it does, we jack it.

JAEGER

How do we do that?

EPPS

You lie in the middle of the road, look

like you're hurt.  When the car stops I

run over to the driver and put a gun to

his head.

JAEGER

Why do I have to lie in the road?

EPPS

Somebody has to.

JAEGER

Yeah, but why me?  What if the car

doesn't stop?

EPPS

Then I'm a rich man.

JAEGER

Epps.

EPPS

Yeah.

JAEGER

I want you to know... I don't know.  I

just think you're a hell of a guy.

EPPS

Thanks.

JAEGER

This whole time, you've kept your head.

You didn't go money simple like me and

Wes.  You've just been trying to figure

how to get us out of here.  And you've

been fair too.  I mean, even after

I...you know...

EPPS

Threatened to blow my brains out?

JAEGER

Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take

it out on me, except for maybe making me

lie in the middle of the road now.  But

I'd say you've been very fair.  I just

think it's a hell of a man who can keep

from going money simple.

EPPS

Don't make so much out of it.  Only

reason I haven't figured a way to get all

that money for myself is because I've

been too busy figuring ways to stay

alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to

catch my breath I might have played

things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no

better than anybody else.  I've just been

busier.

JAEGER

Epps?

EPPS

What?

JAEGER

I'm thinking about taking a trip.

EPPS

Thought you were going to buy a car.

JAEGER

Still am.  There's more gold than I

thought, and since there's only two of us

now...  Where should I go?

EPPS

I don't know.

JAEGER

I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't

know where to go.  Where would you go?

EPPS

How the hell should I know?

EPPS(CONT)

Australia.

JAEGER

What?

EPPS

I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not

many people.  I think after this I'd like

to quit people for awhile.  And the girls

go crazy for brothers down there.

JAEGER

Really?

EPPS

That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls

go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.

JAEGER

Well, this is it.  We get the car, find

some Americans.  We find Americans we'll

be all right.

EPPS

We'll make up some kind of lie.  They

won't find the gold.

JAEGER

Okay.  See you in a minute.

JAEGER(CONT)

Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.

EPPS

He'll slow down.

JAEGER

He's not slowing.

EPPS

He's going to slow down.

JAEGER

Epps...Epps!

JAEGER(CONT)

Aw, damn!

EPPS

You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK

ENGLISH!?

DRIVER

(Frightened)

Y-yes.

EPPS

Where were you going?

DRIVER

Baghdad.

EPPS

What's in the other direction?

DRIVER

This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

EPPS

Turn the car around.

DRIVER

Please, I beg of you.  The American army

is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill

me.

EPPS

Nobody's going to hurt you.

EPPS(CONT)

You see that?  Gold.  You take us to the

Americans, and we'll give you another

one.  Now drive.

DRIVER

You are Americans, yes?

DRIVER(CONT)

We didn't not all want this war, do you

know?  We didn't not all want to invade

our brothers and sisters in Kuwait.  Now

your army crushes us.  So few days, and

so many have died.  And many fear we will

all die.  Please tell this to your

people:  We did not want this war.

DRIVER(CONT)

I have a brother in our army.  When I

take you back, will you look for him?  If

he is still alive, will you look for him

and take care of him?

EPPS

Yeah.  We'll look for him.

JAEGER

Look at this.

DRIVER

Iraqis.  They are fleeing from Kuwait,

from your military.

EPPS

See if you can't drive around this.

JAEGER

What the hell are they doing?  There're

civilians in there.

JAEGER(CONT)

DON'T SHOOT!  DON'T SHOOT!  THEY'RE

CIVILIANS!

EPPS

The gold!

JAEGER

No!

FADE TO:

FADE TO:

CHIEF JUSTICE

The members of this tribunal have reached

a verdict.  Based on the evidence

presented we find the defended guilty as

charged of desertion, insurrection,

insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.

Further the tribunal will recommend that

the defendant be sentenced to life

imprisonment, and that from this day

forward he shall no longer walk as a free

man.  You should consider yourself quite

fortunate, son.  There was a time when

lesser crimes would have found you before

a firing squad.  I don't know that a

person like you has much to say for

himself, but it is your right say

something.

JAEGER

I'm sorry, I guess.  Not for looking for

the gold, or leaving my post.  You know

what it's like to have gold raining out

of your hands?  That'll give me enough to

think about the rest of my days in the

brig.  I'm just sorry about Wes.  He was

all right.  It was the gold that made him

what he became.  If I hadn't found that

map, if I hadn't talked them into going

searching...Wes just might have made it

home after all.  I guess I feel

responsible for him.

CHIEF JUSTICE

The way I view things you're responsible

for the lives of two men:  Private First

Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant

John Epps.

JAEGER

Yeah, well, I've been thinking about

that.  See, there was an explosion and

everything, but I never really aaw Epps

get killed.  And nobody ever found the

gold.  I guess they both could have been

burned to slag.  I guess.  But there were

a lot of bodies out on that road.  A

smart man could have found some

identification to use.  A smart man could

have made his way up to Syria or Turkey.

A smart man could have gotten himself

right out of the Middle East.  A smart

man with enough gold.  Way I figure,

right about now old Epps is sitting in a

bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe

Brisbane telling stories to one of the

prettiest Aussies you ever saw.

CHIEF JUSTICE

I find it highly unlikely that anyone

could accomplish such a thing.

JAEGER

Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second

Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

FADE TO:

END
