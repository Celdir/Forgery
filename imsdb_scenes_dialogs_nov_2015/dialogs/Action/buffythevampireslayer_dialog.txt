Joss Whedon

KNIGHT

A tankard of ale, wench.

KNIGHT

(continuing)

Some plague we're having, huh?

CUT TO:

KNIGHT

Oh, my god...

CUT TO:

AMILYN (O.S.)

The lord giveth, and the lord taketh

away.  Ashes, ashes...

AMILYN

(continuing)

... All fall down

LOTHOS

You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends

to drool before supper.

SLAYER

Lothos...

LOTHOS

You people will never learn.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

We can't be stopped.  This is our

world now.

CUT TO:

GIRL

I can't!

MAN

You know you must.  There is only

one.  Now you are that one.  It is

time.

GIRL

Why?  Why me?

MAN

She has died.  You are the next to

be called.  Why do you think you

were sent to me?  Trained as you

were?  You bear the mark.

MAN

(continuing)

The mark of the Coven.

GIRL

I don't understand.

MAN

Ever since Adam and Eve first left

the garden, he followed: the serpent.

Satan.  He sends his legion in the

shape of men, to feed on us, to

breed his Hell on our earth.  They

are a plague upon us.

MAN

(continuing)

But as long as there have been

vampire, there has been the Coven;

the line of Slayers.  Ones with the

strength and the skill to kill them,

to find them where they gather and

stop the swell of their numbers.

One dies, the next is called.

GIRL

I'm just a girl.

MAN

You are much more.

MAN

(continuing)

One dies, the next is called...

COACH

Come on, do the play!  The one

where...  the one from the book!

Where you make it go forward!

ANDY

All right, guys, come on!

ANDY

(continuing)

Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They

were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run

twenty-two.  Grueller, close the

pocket, watch out for thirty-five.

Thompson, run the post, right, wide

out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and

run around like a chicken.

BUFFY AND CHEERLEADERS

Jeffrey!  Jeffrey!

He's our man!

If he can't do it

We don't want it!

COACH

(looking around)

Is that good?  Was that a good thing?

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's

always giving me a hard time.  I

get a C-plus on the test and he

tells me, 'You have no sense of

history.'  I have no sense of

history?  He wears a brown tie.

NICOLE

You got a C-plus?  I can't believe

I cheated off you.

BUFFY

Excuse me for not knowing about El

Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to

Spain anyway.  Ooh!

BUFFY

(continuing)

Mmmm.  Wouldn't I look just edible

and nutritious in this?

KIMBERLY

Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.

BUFFY

(modeling the dress for

Kimberly))

What do you think?

KIMBERLY

Please.  It's so '91.

GIRL

Oh.

KIMBERLY

What are we doing?

BUFFY

Why don't we see a movie?

KIMBERLY

Well, where?

JENNIFER

Omniplex?

NICOLE

Nee sitch.  No way.

BUFFY

No THX.

NICOLE

They don't even have Dolby.

KIMBERLY

Beverly Center.

BUFFY

Please.  They show previews for

foreign movies.

NICOLE

AMC?

KIMBERLY/BUFFY

Bogus corn!

KIMBERLY

Totally stale.  And the ushers are

like, the acne patrol.  We're

thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?

BUFFY

Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

JENNIFER

Excellent.

BUFFY

What's playing there?

BUFFY

(continuing)

Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.

KIMBERLY

(calling back)

Nice ensemble!

NICOLE

What a homeless.

NICOLE

(to Buffy)

So, is Jeffrey really spending the

night at your house?

BUFFY

That's the plan.

NICOLE

Good enough!

JENNIFER

Your parents are always going away

for the weekend.  You're so lucky.

BUFFY

(maybe not)

Yeah, I guess.

JENNIFER

My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She

even does the shopping network.

I'm gonna die a virgin.

KIMBERLY

What did Jeffrey's dad say?

BUFFY

'Just remember you're in training,

son'

NICOLE

Oh, God.

KIMBERLY

He is so bald.

PIKE

Will you guys shut up, please?

BUFFY

It could happen.

PIKE

Booo!

BENNY

Suck!

PIKE

Wrong answer!  No prize.

NICOLE

God!  Take a chill lozenge.

KIMBERLY

Like we don't have rights too?

BUFFY

Ignore them.

BENNY

I can't believe these people.  We

paid money to see this.

PIKE

No, we didn't.

BENNY

Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know

what happens.

BUFFY

Everyone get horribly killed except

the blonde girl in the nightie, who

finally kills the monster with a

machete but it's not really dead.

JENNIFER

Oh, my God.  Is that true?

BUFFY

Probably.  What movie is this?

CUT TO:

GRUELLER

Look at that moon!  It's huge!

Come on, guys, we gotta do something

tonight.  Party.

ANDY

You know, if you would spend more

time at home sleeping, you would

spend less time on the field,

sucking.

JEFFREY

You were a bone out there today.

Anyway, I'm booked.  Gonna spend

some quality time with the little

woman.

ANDY AND GRUELLER

(coughing it into their

hands)

Pussy-whipped.  Pussy-whipped.

JEFFREY

You guys are pathetic.

GRUELLER

Later for you, then.  I'm blowing.

Andy, you coming?

ANDY

No, I'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey.

GRUELLER

Okay.  Later.

ANDY

Headbutt!

ANDY

(continuing)

Later.

BUFFY

Nice game.

ANDY

Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist

or anything, but can I borrow her?

BUFFY

Andy!

JEFFREY

No way.  You'd get her dirty.

(off her look)

He would, honey.  He's an animal.

CUT TO:

GRUELLER

Yo!  Who is that?  Don't mess with

me man, I'll rip your head off.

GRUELLER

(continuing)

Come on, come out here.  Let's see

what you got.

GRUELLER

(continuing)

Forget this.

GRUELLER

(continuing)

Bessel!  What are you doing here?

WALLY

Hi, Grueller.

GRUELLER

What are you grinning at?  You think

I was scared?

WALLY

Could be.

GRUELLER

You think so?

WALLY

Could be.

GRUELLER

Listen, you little worm.  I could

beat your head to a pulp for you,

just like I did last year, you got

that?  You got that?

WALLY

(repeating)

Got that.

GRUELLER

Good.

GRUELLER

(continuing)

What the...

ANDY

It's um... you had to be there.

JEFFREY

You okay?

BUFFY

I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

CUT TO:

NEWSCASTER

-- The fourth such disappearance in

less than two months.  The sheriff

was not available for comment, but

a police spokesman issued a

statement, saying that the situation

is not out of hand...

CUT TO:

BUFFY'S DAD

We're gonna be late.  I knew it.

BUFFY'S MOM

(to Buffy, but not looking

at her)

Now, we'll be back on Sunday,

number's on the fridge, don't drive

the Jaguar and tell Consuela my

underwear does not go in the

dishwasher.

BUFFY'S DAD

Have fun be good stay away from the

Jag.

BUFFY

I know.

BUFFY'S MOM

Well, that's everything.  Kiss noise.

BUFFY

'Bye.

BUFFY'S MOM

(calling out)

Bye-bye, Bobby!

JEFFREY

Bye!

(to Buffy)

They think my name's Bobby?

BUFFY

Well... it's possible they think my

name's Bobby.

JEFFREY

Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.

BUFFY

Something like that.

JEFFREY

Hey, it works for me.  If they want

to leave you alone in the house,

all helpless and vulnerable...

BUFFY

What show is this?

JEFFREY

It's the news, Buffy.

BUFFY

Oh.  Who's in it?

(off his look)

I know what it is.  It's what's on

instead of the movie.

JEFFREY

I just want to see the basketball

scores.  It's important.

BUFFY

(over a handful of popcorn)

Mmmnkay.

JEFFREY

Of course, there are... other

considerations...

CUT TO:

SAILOR

You never touched my heart.

LOTHOS

Soon.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Buffy!  Hey, what's the sitch?!?

Wake up!

BUFFY

Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.

JEFFREY

You were having a nightmare.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

What'd you dream about?

BUFFY

Nothing.

JEFFREY

Come on, what was it?

BUFFY

Nothing.  It was just a dream.

CUT TO:

AMILYN

You have brought us here, and we

thrive.  We thrive.  You will awake

in a new world.  Just as I promised,

untold splendor, rubies dripping

from our lips.  Just as we said.

AMILYN

(continuing)

Soon...

CUT TO:

BUFFY

The environment.

NICOLE

The homelesses?

KIMBERLY

Oh, please.

JENNIFER

Are there any good sicknesses that

aren't too depressing?

BUFFY

Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling

you, it's totally key.  The earth

is in terrible shape, we could al

die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

KIMBERLY

I thought he was doing Indians.

JEFFREY

Hey there.

BUFFY

Hi.

JENNIFER

(shyly)

Hi, Jeffrey.

ANDY

Whatchya guys doing?

NICOLE

The winter dance.  We need to come

up with a theme.

JEFFREY

The senior dance?  How about...

'Our Friend, the Beer?'

ANDY

'Putting Out for Fun and Profit'...

possible thought...

KIMBERLY

Try new Clue-flakes.

BUFFY

It has to be, like a socially

conscious theme.

CASSANDRA

(reading from a memo)

'One that reflects the students'

growing awareness of and involvement

in the world around them.'

JEFFREY|ANDY

Downer.

BUFFY

I still say the environment.  That's

my suggestion.

CASSANDRA

It is a pretty crucial subject.

BUFFY

See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's

my friend.

ANDY

I like it.  Can I be your friend?

JEFFREY

Stay away from my thang.

(to Buffy)

Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'

NICOLE

Environment.  That's cool with me.

KIMBERLY

Okay.

CASSANDRA

So, what are the most immediate

threats to the world environment

right now?

JEFFREY

Well, um... litter?

ANDY

Litter, yeah!

JEFFREY

(to Cassandra)

Write that down.

JENNIFER

Okay, what else?

NICOLE

Forest fires?

ANDY

Communism?

BUFFY

Bugs.

CASSANDRA

(helpfully)

Okay, guys, how about the ozone

layer?

KIMBERLY

Oh, yeah!

NICOLE

Right!

BUFFY

We gotta get rid of that!  That's

right.

GARY MURRAY

I don't suppose you kids heard the

first bell, did you?  The first

bell was saying, 'Start going to

class, it's time to go to class.'

In about thirty seconds the second

bell is going to be saying, 'Already

be in class.'

JEFFREY

We're having a very important

discussion here.

GARY MURRAY

Why do I have trouble believing

you?

JEFFREY

Something from your childhood, maybe?

GARY MURRAY

Button it, Kramer.  Classes are

starting.  Be there or beware.

ANDY

Man has a complex.

BUFFY

He's got a...  What do you call it?

A Napoleonic Code.

JENNIFER

It's 'cause he's so tiny.

ANDY

Yes, but what he lacks in height he

makes up in shortness.

KIMBERLY

Let's meet tonight, okay?

BUFFY

Where?

KIMBERLY

Cafe Blase.

NICOLE

Cool.  We can figure decorations

and stuff.

BUFFY

Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

CASSANDRA

Can't.  History report.  The Normans

and the Saxons.

BUFFY

Bogutude.  Blow it off.

CASSANDRA

I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty

interesting.

BUFFY

(not harshly)

You're weird and I'm afraid of you.

Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot

cooler things you could be doing

than your homework.

CASSANDRA

Like what?

BUFFY

Like my homework.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KIMBERLY

I don't see why we have to invite

everyone.

BUFFY

Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

NICOLE

If we don't invite all the seniors

we can't use the school funds, you

know that.

KIMBERLY

Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne

Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't

we have a Maryanne clause?

NICOLE

Well, look who's here.

WAITRESS

Hey!

BENNY

The Fifties are over.

PIKE

(earnestly)

We have to learn to let go.

WAITRESS

Don't give me any trouble, okay?

PIKE

No trouble.  We just want to eat.

PIKE

(continuing)

Come on, come on, fork up the scub.

BENNY

That's it, man.  That's the whole

story.

PIKE

We're looking at a dog, possible

coffee...

PIKE

(continuing)

It's coffee.

BENNY

Amazing!

KIMBERLY

(to the other girls)

Smell of booze much.

NICOLE

Nice much.

PIKE

(to the waitress)

Can we have a hot dog, please, medium

rare, and a cup of joe?

BUFFY

You guys are thrashed.

JENNIFER

(to Buffy)

What are you talking to them for?

BENNY

(to Buffy)

What did you say?

PIKE

Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks.

What's your name?

BUFFY

Buffy.

BENNY

Figures.

PIKE

Do people ever call you 'Buffy the

Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

PIKE

(continuing)

The don't.  You kind of wish they

would, though.

KIMBERLY

Wit-tay.

PIKE

I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.

KIMBERLY

Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.

PIKE

Hey, wait a minute...

BENNY

You're the guys from the movie!

PIKE

(good naturedly)

We hate you guys!

PIKE

(continuing)

You guys were way rude.  It was

shocking.

NICOLE

You just snuck in anyway.

PIKE

So you have to ruin the movie for

us?  You know, other people have

feelings, too.

KIMBERLY

I am so sure.

BENNY

Hey, Buffy, you hungry?  I got

something for you...

BENNY

(continuing)

Hey!  She wasted my dog!

PIKE

(smiling)

Bummer metaphor.

CUT TO:

BENNY

Rich bitches.  They're a plague.

They've gotta be stopped.

PIKE

You didn't like them.

BENNY

They're all the same!  They're so

stuck up, they're just... they're

not even human.  I hate them.

PIKE

Would you sleep with them?

BENNY

Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely.

Please, God.

PIKE

Well, there it is, isn't it?  You

don't even like them, and you'd

sleep with them.  What's that all

about?

BENNY

I got a news flash, man, another

shot of this and I'll have sex with

you.

PIKE

Oh, yeah, and then you'll never

call me.

CUT TO:

NICOLE

Come one, that was so weird.

BUFFY

(uncomfortable)

What, it's not weird.  I just cut

the stupid hot dog in half.

KIMBERLY

I can't believe they still ate it.

JENNIFER

(to Buffy)

Where'd you learn how to do that?

BUFFY

I didn't learn... I just... it's

not a big deal.

KIMBERLY

Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you

were playing with another man's

Hebrew National.

BUFFY

(annoyed)

Get a boob job.

NICOLE

It's like when we took gymnastics

in eighth grade.

JENNIFER

What happened?

NICOLE

Buffy was on the uneven parallels --

she was really good; coach said she

could have been in the Olympics --

but she was doing a routine,

spinning, and the beam broke.

JENNIFER

You're kidding.

NICOLE

Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on

the upswing, and I swear to God she

went across the room.  Perm over

heels.

JENNIFER

Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you

quit.

NICOLE

Well, that's the thing.  She landed

on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a

toe.  And I go up to her and she

turns and looks at me and she's

like this --

NICOLE

(continuing)

-- like she's gonna kill me.

BUFFY

I was just scared is all.

NICOLE

No.  It was mondo bizarro.

KIMBERLY

Buffy, the ape-woman.

NICOLE

Seriously, Buffy.  That look was

way twisted.  What were you thinking

about?

CUT TO:

PIKE

I'll have it running in a week.

It's be beauty.  It just needs new

shocks, you know, break pads, an

engine, and some wheels.  It'll be

totally cherry.

BENNY

When you get your car together,

man, let's bail.

PIKE

You think?  Split?

BENNY

Utterly.  Let's bail this town.

It's getting... I don't know.  Let's

go somewhere where there aren't any

rich bitches.

PIKE

Our own world, where we could live

and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.

BENNY

I think I'm gonna ralf.

PIKE

Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for

you.

PIKE

(continuing)

I'm here for you, Ralf.

AMILYN

You wanna go for a ride?

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

What was the step after...  The one

from Thursday.  I never learned it

right, I don't think.

BUFFY

That is so cool.

NICOLE

Thank you very much.

BUFFY

Nobody is even gonna look at the

game.

JENNIFER

Hey, I was thinking, for the dance,

what about a big sign that says

'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and

a picture of the earth.

BUFFY

Don't tread on the earth?

NICOLE

I don't get it.

BUFFY

How do you not tread on the earth?

I mean, you kind of have to.

JENNIFER

I never thought of that.

NICOLE

I gotta bail.  You coming?

BUFFY

You guys blow.  I'm waiting on

Cassandra.  She's gonna help me

with my history.

NICOLE

Cassandra's really smart.

BUFFY

Yeah... She's okay, though.

NICOLE

I guess.

JEFFREY

Are you going out with Jeffrey

tonight?

BUFFY

Jealous?

BUFFY

(continuing)

Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday

your prince will come.

NICOLE

Yeah, just make sure you do first.

Let's go, guys.

BUFFY

B'bye.

BUFFY

(continuing)

God, where the hell did you come

from?  You scared me to death.

MERRICK

I'm sorry.  That was impressive.

The...  tumbling.

BUFFY

What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics.

Are you looking for someone?

MERRICK

I'm looking for you, actually.

BUFFY

Am I in trouble or something?

MERRICK

Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I

was sent to find you some time ago.

I should have found you much sooner

but there were...  complications.

You should have been taught,

prepared.

BUFFY

What are you talking about?

MERRICK

I've searched the entire world for

you, Buffy.

BUFFY

Why?

MERRICK

To bring you... your birthright.

BUFFY

My birthright?  You mean, like a

trust fund?

BUFFY

(continuing)

I had a trust fund my great-

grandfather, or maybe it was an

inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and

I spent it on shoes.

MERRICK

You must come with me.  It's much

too late already.  You must come

with me to the graveyard.

BUFFY

Wait a minute.  My birthright is in

the graveyard?  Later not.

MERRICK

Wait!

BUFFY

You're one of those skanky old men

that, like, attack girls and stuff.

Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend

is gonna be here in about thirty

seconds, and he's way testy.

MERRICK

You don't understand.  You have

been chosen.

BUFFY

Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why

don't you just take the first runner

up, okay?

MERRICK

You must believe me.  You must come

with me while there's still time.

BUFFY

Time to do what?

MERRICK

To stop the killing.  To stop the

vampires.

BUFFY

Let me get this straight.  You're

like, this greasy bum, and I have

to go to the graveyard with you

'cause I'm chosen, and there's

vampires.

MERRICK

Yes.

BUFFY

Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you

to do things?  Do you see spots?

MERRICK

I don't have time for your prattling.

I have proof.  You bear the mark.

MERRICK

(continuing)

The mark of the Coven!  The --

where's the mark?

MERRICK

(continuing)

The mark of the -- wait a minute.

BUFFY

You mean that big hairy mole?  Excuse

me:  eeyuu.  I had it removed.

And, like, knowing about my big old

mole isn't proof of anything except

that it's way past medication time.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Just stay away from me, okay?

MERRICK

Did you ever dream that you were

someone else?

BUFFY

Everybody does.

MERRICK

In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A

Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess.

A slave.

BUFFY

I was a slave.

MERRICK

In Virginia.

BUFFY

I don't know.  It was...  There was

a big gram or something.  And there's

one, I'm like a prostitute...

MERRICK

China.

BUFFY

Oh, my God.  I never told anybody

about this.  I remember the one

about the peasant, too.  God, there's

a bunch.  Is this, like channeling

or something.

BUFFY

(continuing)

I had a dream once where I was...

There was like, knights in it, and

I worked in this bar.  And I... was

fighting.  I'm always fighting.

And there's a guy...  He's not always

there, but he's horrible, all white,

and he's always... trying to kill

me.

MERRICK

Lothos.

BUFFY

How do you know all this?

MERRICK

I have to show you.

CUT TO:

BUFFY

I can't believe I'm doing this.  I

can't believe I'm in a graveyard

with a strange man hunting for

vampires on a school night.

MERRICK

Why didn't you ever tell anybody

about your dreams?

BUFFY

Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy.

Beauty ida.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Ow.

MERRICK

Cramps?

BUFFY

None of your business.  God.

MERRICK

This is it.

MERRICK

(continuing)

Robert Berman was killed three days

ago.  The body was found in the

bushes out by the canal.  Extensive

tissue damage -- tearing -- at the

neck and shoulders.  Coroner thinks

it's a dog.  You sit her.

BUFFY

Wait a minute.

MERRICK

Just for protection.  You won't

have to do anything.  I just need

you to watch.

BUFFY

All right.  What do we do now?

MERRICK

We wait for Robert to wake up.

BUFFY

Do you have any gum?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUFFY

'Bye now.

MERRICK

Where's the other one?

BUFFY

She --

CUT TO:

MERRICK

Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act

normal.  Don't let anyone know what's

happening.  This is important.

When the vampires find out who you

are... you won't be hunting them

anymore.

BUFFY

All right.

MERRICK

Meet me at this address after school.

BUFFY

I have cheerleading squad.

MERRICK

Skip it.

BUFFY

Merrick.

BUFFY

(continuing)

They can't come in, right?  Unless

you invite them.  Is that true?

MERRICK

It's true.

CUT TO:

BUFFY'S MOM

Do you know what time it is?

BUFFY

Uum... around ten?

BUFFY'S MOM

I knew this thing was slow.

BUFFY'S MOM

(continuing)

You pay a fortune for something...

(calls out)

Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look

beat.

BUFFY

I do?  I guess I do.

JEFFREY

Where were you last night?  I called

your house like four times.

BUFFY

I went to sleep.  I think I have

the flu or something.

JEFFREY

I can't get sick.  You know --

training and all.  I'm gonna be

late.

BUFFY

'Bye.

NICOLE

Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

BUFFY

Thanks.

NICOLE

You and Cassandra get anything done

last night?

BUFFY

Oh.  No.  She never showed.

CUT TO:

LOTHOS

I find it restorative, sleeping in

the life-blood of so many.  To feel

their souls coursing about me.

CASSANDRA

What's happening?  What do you want?

LOTHOS

(smiling)

So very much.

CASSANDRA

My parents have money...

LOTHOS

Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place

is everything you said it was,

Amilyn.

CASSANDRA

What... are you?

LOTHOS

Are we so strange?  So alien to

you?  I've seen this culture, the

wealth, the greed, the waste...

it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect

place to spread my empire.  Honestly,

Eastern Europe was so dead, the

Communists just drained the blood

out of the place.  It's livened up

a bit in the past few years, but

it's nothing compared to this....

this Mecca of consumption.  The

city of Angels.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

What are we?  We are man, perfected.

We exist to consume.

AMILYN

So?  Do we change this one, or do

we just drain her?

CASSANDRA

Here, look.  My gold card.  It's

your.  I'll never report it.

LOTHOS

She has a certain quality, this

one...

AMILYN

I don't think this is gold.

LOTHOS

Not as single-minded as the others,

not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful.

She's useless.

CASSANDRA

No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really.

Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn.

I'm useful.

LOTHOS

Really?

CASSANDRA

Swear to God.

LOTHOS

I wish you wouldn't mention him...

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Fire the help.  No kidding.

MERRICK

It's not pretty, but it does suit

our purposes.

BUFFY

Our purposes.

BUFFY

(continuing)

What, um...  What do we do?

MERRICK

There's a great deal I have to show

you, I'm not even sure where to

start  There's so little time.

BUFFY

Why do you keep saying that?

MERRICK

Do you know what a Vampire-King is?

BUFFY

A Vampire-King?  You mean like

Dracula?

MERRICK

Oh, yes.  And the man from your

dreams.  Lothos.

BUFFY

Oh, him.

MERRICK

Yes.  They travel about, usually

with one or two of their followers

to lay the groundwork.  The vampires

find a community and they feed on

it, make it their own.  You were

difficult to trace, and I think the

process has gone a lot further than

I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads

a community into some kind of

paranoid frenzy.  But for some

reason, nobody here seems to be

paying any attention.

BUFFY

(not paying attention)

What?

MERRICK

(annoyed)

We'll cover it later.

BUFFY

I still don't get how they happened

to come to my town.  I mean, was I

born here because... because they

were coming here?  That Lothos guy,

and his buddies?

MERRICK

In a way, yes.  Your fate is

inexorably connected to them.

BUFFY

Great.  First I have a birthright,

now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I

have to take notes on this?

MERRICK

(put down his paper)

We're going to have the work hard.

You'll need some excuse for staying

out.  For your parents.

BUFFY

Not a pressing issue.

MERRICK

I tell you, the best thing I can do

right now is find out more about

you.  What your strengths are, your

likes...  Everything.  What's your

best subject?

BUFFY

Uh... gym.

MERRICK

Yes, you used to do gymnastics.

But you stopped.  Why?

BUFFY

Well, everybody says... it's just

kind of dorky.  I mean, have you

ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're

like --

(indicating huge)

-- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.

MERRICK

But you enjoyed it, yes?

BUFFY

Well... I do cheerleading now.

It's way cooler.

MERRICK

Cheerleading.  For... sporting

events, yes?

BUFFY

Sporting events, yeah.

MERRICK

All right.  Why don't you show me a

cheer?

BUFFY

Here?

MERRICK

Yes, yes.  It would be interesting.

A nice cheer.

BUFFY

Okay.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Who we gonna beat?

MERRICK

(pathetically following her

motion)

Who we gonna beat?

BUFFY

(stops)

No -- you don't have to --

MERRICK

Oh.  I thought... you lead me --

BUFFY

No.  You don't do anything.  I do

it.

MERRICK

Oh.  Good.

BUFFY

Who we gonna beat?

Who do we defeat?

Who will we be pulverizing

Into cream of wheat?

BUFFY

Oh, what the hell is wrong with

you?  You threw a knife at my head!

MERRICK

I had to test you.

BUFFY

But you threw a knife at my head!

MERRICK

And you caught it!  Only the chosen

one could have done that.

BUFFY

I don't want to be the chosen one,

okay?  I don't want to spend the

rest of my life chasing after

vampires!  I just want to graduate

from high school, go to Europe,

marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It

may not sound too exciting to a

sconehead like you, but I think

it's swell.  And then you come

along...  and... and then I'm a

member of the hairy mole club, so

you throw things at me!

MERRICK

It was necessary.

BUFFY

(realizing)

Last night.  You knew I was sitting

on a fresh grave, didn't you?

MERRICK

I don't think you understand the

full implications of --

BUFFY

Oh.  Sorry.

MERRICK

(getting up)

Don't you see what's happening?

You're changing.  You've got powers

you've only just begun to tap.

Physical, mental prowess you've

never dreamed of.

(pulling a handkerchief out

of his pocket)

God, this hurts.  I've administered

a few shocks to your system to start

the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry

I have to take so many shortcuts in

the training process.

BUFFY

Put your head back.

MERRICK

Two days ago, would you have even

hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?

BUFFY

No... I guess I would have gotten

Jeffrey to hit you.

MERRICK

Exactly.  You're changing.  You're

becoming something extraordinarily

powerful.

BUFFY

(as announcer)

Ooh, another embarrassment for the

teabag, while the chosen one is

still well under par.

MERRICK

Your turn.

BUFFY

What about bats?  Do they turn into

bats?

MERRICK

No.  No bats, no flying.  They...

float, occasionally.  Not really

flying.

BUFFY

Toasty.  Were there ever any, like,

famous vampires?

MERRICK

Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph

Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are

any of those names familiar?

BUFFY

If I say 'no' does that make me a

bad person?

MERRICK

Good Lord.  What do you study in

history?

BUFFY

My nails.

MERRICK

All right.  You've heard of the

emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack

the Ripper?

BUFFY

They were vampires?

MERRICK

Same one.

BUFFY

Oh.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Excuse me...

PRIEST

Yes, my child?  Is something

troubling you?

BUFFY

Well, sort of.

PRIEST

Well, maybe I can help.

BUFFY

Yeah.  Um... Could you bless these?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MERRICK

... Lothos was probably born in the

eleventh or twelfth century; he's

been difficult to trace.  His power

has increased with age.  It will be

a long while before you are ready

to face him.  We'll be lucky if we

can get him to leave the area, to

lie low for awhile.  That will

scatter the rest of them.  Lothos

is...

MERRICK

(continuing)

... is extremely powerful, but he

is still a vampire, and vulnerable

to the same...

MERRICK

(continuing)

Daylight is still his enemy.  The

stake can still find his heart.

MERRICK

(continuing)

I have huge antlers growing out of

my buttocks.

BUFFY

(angry)

What!?!

MERRICK

Try to pay attention.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GARY MURRAY

Well, I think we can safely say

that something's going on with you,

Buffy.  Now, there's nothing to be

nervous about; you're not in any

trouble.  I just hoped maybe we

could talk.  Don't think of me as

Gary Murray, administrator.  Think

of me as Gary Murray, party guy!

Happening dude who can talk to the

young.  Me and you.  It's open...

Tell me.  It's drugs, isn't it?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GARY MURRAY

Hey, there's nothing to be afraid

of!  I know where you're coming

from.  Believe me.  I'll tell you

the truth.  I've had my drug

experiences, too.  I did a lot -- I

did some acid in the Sixties.  Well,

the late Seventies, actually.  It

was at a Doobie Brother's concert.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GARY MURRAY

... and I could see the music flowing

into me, it was bright red and

electric, and I felt like a big

toaster, and I thought, maybe I am

a toaster, we're all molecules, and

my friend Melissa, her head looked

like a big party balloon, and that

scared me, I started to freak out...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GARY MURRAY

I guess you're surprised.  Well,

you know, there's more to most people

than meets the eye.  Everybody's

got a secret.  I just want you to

know that you can always share your

secrets with me.  What you say in

this office, it will stay in this

office.  I'm your pal.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BENNY

Pike...

PIKE

Benny, man, where you been?  You

bailed on me, I passed out, man, I

almost did a Jimi Hendrix!

BENNY

Let me in.

PIKE

Hey, I'm trying, but this window is

burnt --

BENNY

Invite me in, Pike.

PIKE

Wait a minute.  What's wrong with

you, man?

BENNY

I'm fine.

PIKE

You look like shit, Benny.

BENNY

I... feel.... pretty.

PIKE

No offense, man, but I think you're

on something nasty.  Why don't you

just go and cool out and I'll see

you in the morning or something.

BENNY

The sun!  It burns!  It burns!

BENNY

(continuing)

Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!

PIKE

Get away from here.

BENNY

I'm hungry.

PIKE

I mean it.

BENNY

I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Sure is cold.  What a dark night.

Nice night for a walk.

BUFFY

(continuing)

'Feelings, la la la la feelings'...

Boy, I'm helpless.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Yeucch.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Hello...

BUFFY

(continuing)

What do you want?

BUFFY

(continuing)

Toaster-caked him!

CUT TO:

MERRICK

He was slow.  Very simple.  They

won't all be that easy.

BUFFY

Fine.

MERRICK

And the alley was a mistake.  Never

corner yourself like that.  If they'd

come at you in force you'd be dead

now.  One vampire is a lot easier

to kill then ten.

BUFFY

Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything

to you?

MERRICK

You felt a little sick, didn't you?

The cramps.

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I

felt 'em a little, but I ain't due

for two weeks since you're so excited

about the subject.

MERRICK

It's natural.  A reaction to their

presence, to the... unnaturalness

of it.  It's part of how you are

able to track them.

BUFFY

Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is -

PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks

for telling me.

MERRICK

You'll get used to it.  I'm more

worried about your tactical mistakes.

BUFFY

You are such a wet.

MERRICK

A what?

BUFFY

A wet!  Didn't I just kill that

vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't

see you killing any vampires.  You

were too busy playing 'Beat the

Clock'.

MERRICK

Don't start with me again.

BUFFY

Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The

one and only?  The Grand High Poobah

and doesn't that mean you have to

be nice to me?  Like, ever?

MERRICK

Buffy...

BUFFY

And why are you always wearing black?

It's so down.  It's totally not

your color.  I don't think you have

a color.

MERRICK

What do you want?  Encouragement?

(in bad American accent)

'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I

just want to give you a great big

hug, oh I'm just having a warm

fuzzy.'

BUFFY

Oh, fuck you!

MERRICK

Do you know how many girls I've

trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five

properly prepared girls, girls who

faced their responsibilities, who

worked hard to become women overnight --

harder than you've ever worked in

your life -- and I saw them ripped

apart.  Do you want to live?  Do

you?

BUFFY

I...

MERRICK

What did you think, that being able

to jump about and hit people makes

you a Slayer?

BUFFY

Five?

MERRICK

Five.

BUFFY

So, basically, I've got the life

expectancy of a zit, right?

MERRICK

Not if you're careful.

BUFFY

How can you keep doing this?

MERRICK

It's what I was raised to do.  There

aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

BUFFY

Watchers?

MERRICK

There's a small village in Hampshire,

near Stonehenge...

(sees she doesn't know it)

... near a bunch of big rocks.

That's where I was born.  My father

taught me about the training, about

finding the Slayers, reading the

signs.  There's a small cluster of

us, a few families, really... most

of the neighboring villagers think

we're just a bunch of harmless old

loonies.  I thought so myself for a

time, when I was younger...

(stops himself)

I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to...

I shouldn't go on like this.

BUFFY

I wish you would.

MERRICK

It isn't important.

BUFFY

I'm curious, is all.

MERRICK

Buffy, don't... don't start thinking

of me as your friend.  It interferes

with the work, and it...

BUFFY

And it makes it worse when I die,

right?

BUFFY

(continuing)

Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick

so easy.  I've got a few things the

other girls didn't have.

MERRICK

As for example, what?

BUFFY

Well... there's my keen fashion

sense, for one.

MERRICK

Vampires of the world, beware.

BUFFY

(impressed)

Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you

okay, I mean, do you want to lie

down?  I know it hurts the first

time.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

So they found Cassandra's body out

by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's

saying anything, but they think she

was involved in something, like,

illegal or something.  Like dealing.

KIMBERLY

Well, I hope so.

JENNIFER

Probably was.  What do you suppose

she was doing out there.

BUFFY

Dying.

JENNIFER

Eeyuu.

ANDY

... And they're having some memorial

service or something tomorrow.  You

going?

JEFFREY

I don't know.  Coach said I had to

work on my 'ab's.'

ANDY

Coach knows what abs are?

ANDY

(continuing)

Got to get some!

ANDY

(continuing)

Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

I don't actually need any right

now.

JEFFREY

(to Buffy)

What's with you?

BUFFY

Don't grab me, okay?

ANDY

Absolutely.  I see now the error of

my mistake.

JEFFREY

Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang.

I'll pop you one.

(to Buffy)

Did he scare you?

BUFFY

I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

So I noticed.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

Nice to feel needed.

ANDY

Let's move out!

JEFFREY

(rallying)

Yes!

CUT TO:

BUFFY

I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's

really sweet, but sometimes he gets

kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know

what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I

guess.

(no response)

Merrick?  Are you still breathing?

MERRICK (O.S.)

(from inside)

I can't work this.

BUFFY

We call them zippers.  They're not

supposed to be a challenge.

MERRICK

But it's in the back.  Why are we

wasting time with this, anyway?

BUFFY

Because you clash, Merrick.  You

clash with everything.  I mean you

might as well go around with a sign,

'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly,

you look like something out of...

Pasadena.

MERRICK

My clothes have always been perfectly

serviceable.

BUFFY

Well, you're on my turf now.  You're

just gonna have to trust me.

MERRICK

I want to die.

BUFFY

(doesn't like it either)

Okay.  The important thing is not

to panic.

CUT TO:

PIKE

You said you'd have the part by

two!  Christ, it's almost dark.

ZEPH

What nasty bug crawled up your bungus

and where the hell are you going?

PIKE

I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town.

This place has gotten way too hairy.

ZEPH

Where am I gonna find another

mechanic stupid enough to work for

my money?

PIKE

Hey, have you seen Benny lately?

ZEPH

No...  You want me to give him a

message?

PIKE

You should think about leaving,

too, man.  Sell this place...

Something's going on here.  I don't

know.  Something real weird.

ZEPH

Ah, you'll be coming back.

PIKE

I don't think so.

ZEPH

All right.  Take care of yourself.

PIKE

I am.

ZEPH

Hey.  What should I do if I see

Benny?

PIKE

Run.

ZEPH

That's my guitar...

CUT TO:

PIKE

Come on, come on.  Don't leave me,

baby.  Come on, breathe.

PIKE

(continuing)

This is for the money, baby.  Make

me proud.

PIKE

Oh, give me a break.

BUFFY

(into walkie-talkie)

I'm on the east side, near the

playground...  all right.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Hi.

PIKE

Hi there.

BUFFY

Is that your car?

PIKE

It was.  I think it's pretty much

ready for the --

MERRICK

Interesting.

BUFFY

I kind of had to improvise.

(to Pike)

Sorry about your guitar.

PIKE

That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm

not.... I have to fall down now.

CUT TO:

LOTHOS

What's wrong with you!?!

AMILYN

My arm!  He took my fucking arm!

LOTHOS

Shut up!  You let him have it!

LOTHOS

(continuing)

You reckless imbecile.  This place

is ours for the taking and you let

yourself... twelve hundred years

old and you act like a child.

AMILYN

I had him in my grasp.

LOTHOS

Cheer up.  You may still.

AMILYN

(forlornly)

I look horrible.

LOTHOS

The other two -- the new ones.

Where are they?

AMILYN

I don't know.  But the boy, he

couldn't kill them.

LOTHOS

(thoughtfully)

No... Not a boy...

(gathers himself)

Find out if they're dead.  And do

something about that arm.  Honestly,

I don't know how you made it through

the Crusades.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

Let me know about our little

recruits.  I'll be in my chamber...

LOTHOS

(continuing)

... having a snack.

CUT TO:

BUFFY

How are you doing?

PIKE

Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of

miss my knees, though.

BUFFY

You want some water or something?

PIKE

Water.  Okay.

PIKE

(continuing)

Do you do this kind of thing a lot?

I mean, is this like a hobby?

BUFFY

Not exactly.

PIKE

They were vampires, weren't they?

BUFFY

Yeah.

PIKE

God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

BUFFY

You had a car full of stuff.  Were

you leaving?

PIKE

Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a

friend, and he's really... well,

he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad

scene.

BUFFY

Well, stay here tonight.

PIKE

Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a

bus.  I'm gone.

BUFFY

Where are you gonna go?

PIKE

Well, I've always wanted to see

Oxnard.

PIKE

(continuing)

Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a

hand?

BUFFY

It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.

PIKE

(almost awed)

Who are you?

PIKE

(continuing)

I'm sorry, I just mean... well you

seemed like such a flake.  But, in

a good way!  I can just keep talking

till you strike me dead, or...

BUFFY

Things are kind of confusing.

PIKE

I'll back that up.

BUFFY

Three weeks ago all I thought about

was... well, I didn't actually think

about anything.  I definitely didn't

expect this.

PIKE

I know.  My guidance counselor never

mentioned anything about vampires.

'Prison' came up a few times, but

nothing about undead.

BUFFY

It's weird.  I went back to my old

grade school once, to the playground --

I used to hang out there all the

time, playing on the swings and

stuff... I went back and it was so

tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't

even fit on the swings.  Everything

just looked so small.

(collects herself)

I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.

PIKE

No, you're not.

BUFFY

I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my

mom's room if you want.

PIKE

I think I'll just hang out here.

Make sure the sun comes up and

everything.

BUFFY

You sure?

PIKE

Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair,

got my window, I'm great.

BUFFY

Mmkay.

PIKE

Hey, Buffy...

BUFFY

Yeah?

PIKE

You know, you saved my life.  And I

just wanted to say... I forgive you

for talking during the movie.

Almost.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MERRICK

There isn't time.

BUFFY

Make time, okay?  You're the one

who told me to act normal.  I've

missed three practices already.  If

I'm not there for the Barber game

tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.

MERRICK

Another distraction.  It's not right.

BUFFY

Why because it's not my fate?  It's

not in the Book-of-All-

Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be

cheerleading at the Barber game?

MERRICK

Sooner or later you're going to

have to accept it.  Your fate.

BUFFY

I'm pretty much learning not to

accept anything anymore.  Come on,

Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we

can kill and kill until there is

nothing left.

MERRICK

All right.

BUFFY

Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna

be a great game.

MERRICK

Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm

not letting you out of my sight.

Not till you're ready.

BUFFY

Try and be inconspicuous, okay?

Act like a fan.

MERRICK

(being a fan)

Football is my life.

BUFFY

You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly

slowly, but you're learning.

MERRICK

None of the other girls ever gave

me this much trouble.

BUFFY

And where are they now?

JEFFREY

So that's your tutor, huh?  What is

he, like, your boyfriend now?

BUFFY

Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.

COACH

Some people say winning is a state

of mind.  Can't win out there if

you don't win --

(point to his head)

state of mind.  I say winning is

having more points.  And how do we

get point?  By putting the thing,

the ball over the.. in the place.

AMILYN

End zone.

COACH

Right.  So I don't care about your

minds.  Maybe you're tired.  Maybe

you're worried about your grades.

Maybe you dog just died or you've

suddenly found that you're attracted

to other men.  I don't care!  'Cause

we're a team.  And there only on

thing that matters to a team.  What

that?

TEAM

Winning!

COACH

And how do we win?

TEAM

By putting the thing in the place!!

COACH

So let's go!!

Yeahh!!!!

There you are!  You missed practice

Sorry.

Hey, can I borrow your binoculars,

man?

MERRICK

(without looking around)

No.

TEEN

You're checking out the cheerleaders.

All right.  Buffy, man.

MERRICK

What about her?

TEEN

Everybody knows about her, man.

MERRICK

Knows what about her?

TEEN

She's had sex.

MERRICK

I'm on the wrong bloody side.

Twenty-three!  Thirty-two!  Hike!

Come on!  Do the thing!  Where you...

go towards the guy!  Come one!

Throw the thing!

Oh, wow.  She's really lost it.

You know, Buffy, I've always wanted

you.

PIKE

I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean

it!

BUFFY

I didn't expect to see you.

PIKE

I know.

BUFFY

Why'd you come back?

PIKE

I don't know.  I kind of thought I

ought to be here.  You know, this

isn't exactly the kind of thing you

can run away from.

BUFFY

Thanks.

PIKE

Besides, Oxnard sucks.

PIKE

(continuing)

Listen, I... I really do want to

help.  I mean, these guys are dag

nasty, and somewhere my best friend

is out there, and I'd like to, I

don't know.  Even the score.  Do

some damage.  I'm good with damage.

BUFFY

Pike, I don't think you're up to

this.

PIKE

I think I could help.  You gonna

tell me you don't need help?

CUT TO:

MERRICK

Did you see a girl come by here?

BIKER

You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

MERRICK

Yes.

BIKER

Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my

wheels.

MERRICK

Wheels?

BIKER

My bike!  She's a lesbian, too.

She told me.

MERRICK

Which way did she go?

BIKER

Down there.

MERRICK

Idiot girl.  Can't watch over her.

How long ago did --

MERRICK

Oh, my God.

LOTHOS

It's a beautiful night.  I have

never understood the human tendency

to equate darkness with emptiness.

To me the black is so thick with

life, like soil...  like blood.

Darkness writhes under my eye.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

I know who you are.  She's out her,

as well, isn't she?  Another Slayer.

Who is it this time?  What offering

have you brought me?

PIKE

Buffy?  What's wrong?

BUFFY

Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's

him.

PIKE

Who?

BUFFY

(not answering)

Merrick...

BUFFY

(continuing)

Stay here.

CUT TO:

LOTHOS

It doesn't really matter.  The names,

the faces, they all melt together.

After a time, there really is no

difference.  One more pathetic bitch,

begging for me to suck on her clotted

heart.

MERRICK

This one may surprise you.

LOTHOS

I rather doubt it, if she was raised

here.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

Where is she?  I can't wait to meet

her.  Do you think she's ready to

face me?  Or perhaps you can stop

me with that gun.

MERRICK

Perhaps.

LOTHOS

Look at you.  You pathetic thing.

So small, so full of fury.  After

you've served me for a hundred years,

I think you'll have a little more

perspective.

MERRICK

I don't think so.

LOTHOS

Fool.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven,

duhmm... hallowed be Thy name.

Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, I

don't know.  I don't even know if

you're religious.  You probably

are.  But you're dead, you know.

You're just totally dead.  and...

BUFFY

(continuing)

... and I don't know what to do.

You were the one who... I don't

know if the training was over.  I

don't even know if I passed.  You're

so stupid!  How could you be so

stupid?  What am I supposed to do

without you?  You son of a bitch!

BUFFY

(continuing)

Amen.

CUT TO:

ZEPH

Hah, I'd knew you'd be back.  Didn't

I say you'd be back?  Ha, ha, ha!

You're sitting in your old car saying

'Nope, I'm never coming back.'

Hee, Hee!  Like you got anywhere to

go.  'I'm never coming back'  But I

knew you would.  Birds got to return

to the nest sooner or later.  That's

what I said.  Just like I told you...

ZEPH

(continuing)

Hah!  Shot the damn tire, dumbass,

didn't even look, just going around

shooting things, popped it flat, ya

bonehead.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

I got all the plastic stuff.  What

should I do with it?

KIMBERLY

("you idiot")

Throw it out.

NICOLE

I really was way way too too.

KIMBERLY

Oh, please!  When she ran onto the

field in the middle of the game?

Was that the most out-of-it thing

ever, or did I blink?

NICOLE

I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What

are you doing?'  And she's going

'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

JENNIFER

Hi, Buffy.

BUFFY

Hi, guys.

KIMBERLY

You were supposed to be here at

three.

BUFFY

I forgot.

KIMBERLY

Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're

acting like The Thing From Another

Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.

BUFFY

Look, a lot's been going on.  That's

what I wanted to tell you guys about.

I need to tell you.  You see... a

while ago, I met this guy --

KIMBERLY

Oh my God you're having an affair.

NICOLE

Cool!

JENNIFER

Does Jeffrey know?

BUFFY

It's not that at all.  This is an

old guy, he's like fifty.

KIMBERLY/NICOLE

Eeyuu.

BUFFY

No, no.  Listen.  Haven't you guys

noticed how weird things have gotten

around here?  Like, people

disappearing, people turning up

dead...

NICOLE

What are you talking about?

KIMBERLY

Weird?  You mean like you hanging

out with that homeless, Poke?  I

saw you last night after the game.

BUFFY

Pike.

NICOLE

You're having a fling with him?

JENNIFER

He doesn't look fifty.

BUFFY

Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of

her five minutes ago.

KIMBERLY

Oh, thank you very much.

NICOLE

Like you've got a grip.

KIMBERLY

You're so out of it.  You've blown

off cheerleading, you've blown off

dance committee --

BUFFY

Excuse me for having something

important to do.

KIMBERLY

This isn't important?  The earth is

our home.

BUFFY

Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a

stupid dance with a bunch of stupid

kids that I see every stupid day.

NICOLE

So, we're stupid now?

KIMBERLY

You know, just because you're having

full-on wiggans doesn't mean you

have to drag us into it.  This isn't

just any dance.  It happens ot be

the last dance of our last year.

NICOLE

Except for Prom.

KIMBERLY

Right.

JENNIFER

And Spring Fling.

KIMBERLY

Okay.

NICOLE

And the January Semi-formal --

KIMBERLY

Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to

play house with the unwashed masses,

that's fine.  But personally, I

think you ought to spend a little

time prioritizing.  I really do.

BUFFY

Listen to you.  What language are

you speaking?

KIMBERLY

Get out of my facial.

NICOLE

Well, I guess you got what you came

for.

BUFFY

Nicole...

NICOLE

Later for it.

CUT TO:

BUFFY'S MOM

Dinner's in the fridge, stay away

from the Jag, we'll be back by

twelve.

BUFFY'S MOM

(continuing)

Buffy, honey?

BUFFY

(wanting to talk)

Yeah?

BUFFY'S MOM

Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe

it's that outfit...

BUFFY

Maybe.

BUFFY'S MOM

What's Bobby gonna say?

BUFFY

I don't know, Mom; I've never met

Bobby.

BUFFY'S MOM

(laughs)

Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss

noise.

CUT TO:

PIKE

Buffy, hey, I've been looking all

over for you.

PIKE

(continuing)

I been working on some stuff for

you.  What'cha doing?

BUFFY

I'm going shopping.  Don't try to

stop me.

PIKE

Cool.  I could actually use a couple

of Allen wrenches.  What do you

need?

BUFFY

A dress.

PIKE

Dress, huh?  What for?

BUFFY

For the dance.

PIKE

Come again?

BUFFY

I'm going to the senior dance.

PIKE

(charades)

Second word... sound like 'dance'.

BUFFY

I'm going to the dance.

PIKE

What for?

BUFFY

In order to dance and to drink punch

and to be with my friends.

Comprende?

PIKE

I don't believe this.  The world's

under attack by the legions of the

undead and you're going to a mixer?

BUFFY

It's not a mixer.  It's the senior

dance.  And it's important.  You

wouldn't understand.

PIKE

You got that right.  I thought you

wanted to kill vampires.

BUFFY

I don't want to kill anybody, and I

don't want to talk about it anymore.

PIKE

Listen, I know you're bummed about

your friend, and I'm really sorry...

BUFFY

(offhand, almost disdainful)

He did what he was supposed to.

PIKE

But, Buffy, you're the guy, the

chosen guy.

BUFFY

Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I

choose to be shopping.

PIKE

I should have known.

BUFFY

Leave me alone.

PIKE

Benny was right.  You guys are all

exactly the same.

PIKE

(continuing; calls after

her)

I'm not disappointed, I'm just angry.

BUFFY

Buffy?  Buffy?

CUT TO:

LOTHOS

Buffy...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANDY

Well, it came with the tux.

ANDY

Buffy!  Looking tasty.

BUFFY

Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

BUFFY

(continuing)

Hi, guys.

NICOLE

Hi.

BUFFY

Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The

limo never showed, I thought he

might be here.

NICOLE

I haven't seen him tonight.

BUFFY

Oh.

BUFFY

(continuing)

I'm glad you guys are here.  It's

good to see you.

KIMBERLY

(miss sarcasm)

Yeah, whoops I came.

BUFFY

(tries again)

You look way pretty, Kim.

KIMBERLY

I know.  I like your little outfit.

NICOLE

It's amazing what you can do with a

parachute and some starch.

KIMBERLY

As long as there's room for three

in it.  What, didn't you bring your

new friends?

BUFFY

I guess you guys are mad at me.

I'm sorry.  I've been really --

BUFFY

(continuing)

Jeffrey!  There you are.  I --

JEFFREY

Buffy, what are you doing here?

BUFFY

I thought we were meeting here.

JEFFREY

I'm here with Jenny.

BUFFY

I don't understand.

JEFFREY

Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's

going on.  It's not working out at

all.  I've got to move on.  I mean,

I've got needs, too.  I told you

about all this.

BUFFY

No, you didn't.  When?

JEFFREY

Didn't you get my message?

BUFFY

You broke up with my machine?

JEFFREY

You weren't home.  Like always.

BUFFY

You left me a message?

JEFFREY

I'm out of here.  Jenny.

PIKE

I crashed your party.

BUFFY

Pretty shallow of you.

PIKE

That's me.

BUFFY

I'm glad you came.

PIKE

Yeah, you look like you're having a

swell time.

PIKE

(continuing)

Will I get the shit kicked out of

me if I ask you to dance?

BUFFY

I don't actually think Jeffrey's

gonna notice.

PIKE

Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid

of.

PIKE

(continuing; gee-whizzically)

You know, you're not like the other

girls.

BUFFY

Yes, I am.

KIMBERLY

I can't believe it.

BLOODY STUDENT

They're out there!  They're vampires!

God, help me!

BUFFY

Don't go near the door.

1ST VAMPIRE

It's party time.

BUFFY

Don't worry!  They can't come in

here.  They can't come in unless

they're invited.

KIMBERLY

I already invited them.

KIMBERLY

(continuing; defensively)

They're seniors!

BUFFY

The first thing we should --

1ST VAMPIRE

Buffy... You wanna dance?

PIKE

(to Buffy)

Looks like you're busted.

2ND VAMPIRE

We want her!  We want Buffy.  Send

her out.

1ST VAMPIRE

Or we come in.

GARY MURRAY

All right, everybody stay calm.

(to Buffy)

What's going on?

PIKE

Looks bad, Buffy.

SENIOR GIRL

Send her out.

BUFFY

What?

KIMBERLY

They'll kill us!  She's the one

they're mad at.

SENIOR BOY

Yeah!  Send her out!

GARY MURRAY

Everybody be quiet!

ANDY

What, are you kidding?  They'll

kill her!

KIMBERLY

They'll kill us!

PIKE

(moving toward Kimberly,

fist raised)

You want some punch?

GARY MURRAY

I got detention slips here, I'm not

afraid to use them...

PIKE

There's gotta be a back way out of

here, or something.

BUFFY

I'm going out the front.

PIKE

Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a

hundred of them out there.  They'll

rip us apart.

BUFFY

You're staying here.

(before he can speak)

Some of them might not come after

me.  If they don't this place is

gonna turn into a total stain.

PIKE

You say that like it's a bad thing.

ANDY

Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these

guys want?

BUFFY

Andy, start breaking up some chairs.

You'll need weapons.

BUFFY

(continuing)

Good thing one of us was prepared.

PIKE

Buffy, there's no way you're going

out there alone.

BUFFY

Don't piss me off.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PIKE

(to himself)

Come on, move.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PIKE

Yes!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KIMBERLY

It's okay!  I think they're going

after her!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PIKE

(to Kimberly)

I'll bet you feel stupid.

GARY MURRAY

Let's get away from these windows!

Find something to cover them with.

PIKE

Bring round the table.

NICOLE

There's nails and stuff we used to

put everything up.

PIKE

Get 'em.

CUT TO:

JENNIFER

Oh, yes!  Yes!

JEFFREY

Oh, baby!

JENNIFER

Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a

woman!

BUFFY

(pissed)

That was quick!

(looking up)

Oops!

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Buffy?

JENNIFER

(whining)

Jeffrey!

JEFFREY

(terrified)

Well, I'm done.  Are you done?

JENNIFER

No --

JEFFREY

Okay, let's go.

JENNIFER

But --

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PIKE

The heart!  Stab them in the heart!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BENNY

Isn't this great, Pike?  Isn't it

great?  Finally got those bitches

on the run.

BENNY

(continuing)

Of course I'm angry!  I leave you

alone for five minutes, and look

who you're hanging out with!

BENNY

(continuing)

I don't want girls with good taste;

I want a girl that tastes good!

BENNY

(continuing)

I was gonna change you, man.  I was

gonna give you life!  Do you know

what that means?

BENNY

Never die.  Never get kicked around,

never get busted.

BENNY

(continuing)

It means never having to say you're

sorry!  And you blow it all off for

that slut?!  What about my needs?!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BENNY

(cattily, to herself)

'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey...

oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical...

I love you...'

AMILYN

All clear?

AMILYN

Pleased to meet you!  Won't you

guess my --

(kicks her hard)

-- name?

BUFFY

(defiantly, through the

pain)

It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?

BUFFY

(continuing)

'Lefty'?

AMILYN

You're a fool, bloodbag.  Die a

fool and go to hell!

AMILYN

(continuing)

The chosen one.  You're just another

bloodbag -- not even fit to die for

the Master.  When will you ever

learn?

BUFFY

(with difficulty)

I do know... one thing...

AMILYN

What?

BUFFY

I know... what time sunrise is.

AMILYN

No!

BUFFY

It's in about four hours, Dick.

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Oh, god, no... not yet...

LOTHOS

I knew you'd come.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

You knew it, too, didn't you?  All

your life, dreaming... waiting to

feed me.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

Ah, my fool is dead.  He was

careless, always.  Still, I'll pull

out your tongue for that.

(coming toward her)

Don't you understand?  I've killed

you a dozen times.  Your life is

not a blink of my eye, not a single

breath.  I have lived in the shadows,

in the pulsing filth behind men's

eyes.  A thousand years, and more.

I have conversed with the worms

that fed on my corpse and I have

bathed in the blood of emperors.

BUFFY

(breaking the spell)

Have you ever thrown up in the front

row of a Richard Marx concert?

LOTHOS

What?

CUT TO:

LOTHOS

You waste time.  That is a sin.

LOTHOS

(continuing)

You're even weaker than the others.

BUFFY

I think you've forgotten something.

LOTHOS

This?  This is you only weapon?

Your puny faith?

BUFFY

No...

BUFFY

(continuing)

... my keen fashion sense.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUFFY

This is the suckiest party I have

ever been to.  It's not even a

contest.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUFFY

Oops.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KIMBERLY

Don't let her in!  Don't let her

in!

KIMBERLY

(continuing)

They'll kill us!  Get her out!

PIKE

Are you okay?

BUFFY

Get away from me!

LOTHOS

You bitch!

LOTHOS

(continuing)

You would challenge me?

LOTHOS

(continuing; to Buffy)

I'll rip the flesh from your stinking

bones!

LOTHOS

(continuing)

I am a God!  A God!

BUFFY

I am so sure.

LOTHOS

It doesn't... hurt... as much as I

had imagined.

GARY MURRAY

Just a minute, you!  I'm not finished

with you!

DISSOLVE TO:

REPORTER (V.O.)

The death toll now reaches twelve

and a half in the tragedy of Hemery

High School.  It was at the Senior

Prom five days ago that the school

was beset by a roving gang of crack-

crazed gunmen.  Survivors say some

two hundred of the ruffians laid

the school gym under a kind of siege,

claiming several lives in the

process.  Said one administrator,

'Things here will never be the same.'

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

JENNIFER

She was even crazier after that.  I

mean it, you wouldn't even have

recognized her.

KIMBERLY

Buffy?

JENNIFER

She didn't even hardly talk to anyone

in school.  All year.  She didn't

even go to the prom.

JEFFREY

I heard she got straight A's.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

That's what I heard.

KIMBERLY

The worst is, her parents -- this

is true -- her parents were gonna

send her to the Bahamas for

graduation, and she refused.  True

story.  She said she didn't want to

go.  It is to vomit.

BOY

Well, where is she now?

CUT TO:

PIKE

I didn't say it was a bad idea, I

just said the timing was off.  We

could maybe wait till later.

BUFFY

Don't be such a fraidy-cat.

PIKE

Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.

BUFFY

We've come all this way.  We just

have to check it out.  I got a hunch.

PIKE

You're the boss, boss.  I just

thought maybe we should wait.

BUFFY

Trust me.

BLACK OUT.
