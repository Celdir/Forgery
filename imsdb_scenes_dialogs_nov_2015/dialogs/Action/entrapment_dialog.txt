"Entrapment", early, by Ronald Bass

ENTRAPMENT

Ronald Bass

First Draft Screenplay

December 2, 1996

Story by:

Ronald Bass

and Michael Herzberg

CRUZ

Baker.  You got it solved?

GIN (O.S., from the rear)

Actually.  Yeh.

CRUZ (glances at his watch)

What took you so long, Gin?  I

called 4:30 this morn...

GIN

I was with someone, all right?

CRUZ

So?  This is work.

GIN

Hector, I hardly know the guy.

Why be impolite to strangers?

CRUZ

Look at those assholes...

CRUZ

If the Vermeer were lying on that

table, they'd toss their doughnuts

on it.

GIN

Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,

so they don't

have

to solve this.

To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24

mil, less re-insurance, which is...

CRUZ (grim)

Only thirty percent, Gin.

CRUZ

Which is why you're on this.

GIN

He came in through the window.

CRUZ

That's not possib...

GIN

What's not possible is entry through

the doors or the vents.  That would

have triggered instant alarm.

CRUZ

The windows are wired, too.

GIN

Only for trauma.  They used smart

glass, where the sensors respond to

violation of the panel's integrity.

GIN

I think he scaled the wall, popped

the frame.  In one piece.

GIN

Then, he only had to deal with

heat and motion sensors.  They

were on 60-second delay, so the

owner wouldn't trigger the alarm

just be walking arou...

CRUZ

The pane weighs 200 pounds, the

building's 1100 feet high.

GIN

This particular guy is the best.

The best there ever was.

CRUZ

Popping the frame would trigger

the alarm.

GIN (gently)

I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.

GIN

Here's how I figured it out...

GIN

No one arranges flowers like that.

It was the draft from the window.

CRUZ

You said.  This particular guy.

GIN

Andrew MacDougal.

CRUZ

Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy

Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.

GIN

Because they couldn't do it.

CRUZ

He's been out of the business.

For ten

years

.

GIN

Maybe not.  No one ever proved,

hell, even

arrested

him, for

stealing

anything

.  But we all

know

he was numero ichiban for

thirty years.  Why not forty?

CRUZ

Why?  Because of the Bozo switch?

Guys have been copying his pack-

rat signature for

decades

.  Maybe

the thief wanted it to

look

like

MacDougal.

GIN

A list of his private collection.

Complete to three acquisitions

last Thursday.

and

black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas

CRUZ

No Vermeer.  Nothing close.

GIN

Don't be a putz.  This is his

legitimate

collection, which he

buys

.  Presentable for any search

warrant surprise party.

GIN

What he rips off, he fences.  And

the money feeds his portfolio of

investments, which are daring, savvy,

and obscenely succesf...

CRUZ

Oh, I get it.  He has no interest

in Vermeers, so that proves he stole

one.  By that logic, he oughta be a

suspect most of the time.

GIN

You love to embarrass yourself.

GIN

The auction.  Where our client

bought

the painting...

GIN (O.S.)

Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire,

four

weeks

ago.

GIN (O.S., murmur)

Anyone we know?

CRUZ

So he was there.

GIN

Staking it out.  Why bid, when

you can mark the buyer, and jack

it within the month?

GIN

At this moment, he is winging on

JAL flight 307 to Narita,

ostensibly

to attend a prestigious auction at

the Hotel Akura, which will include

a mixed media collage/oil by Georges

Braques, on which he

supposedly

has

his eye.

CRUZ

But you know better.

GIN

Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.

GIN (O.S.)

Research reveals three known fences,

still at large, who are believed

to have brokered Vermeers to black

market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is

hospitalized in Malta with ovarian

cancer.

GIN

The other two.  Live in Tokyo.

CRUZ

And you did all this since 4:30

this morning.

CRUZ (murmur)

Plus.  You were polite to a

stranger.

GIN (soft and playful)

Sounds like you're sorry you're

already a friend.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese)

Don't do it.

GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese)

You're already over value.  By

15 percent.

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

Will you stop being stubborn

for one sec...

MAC (quietly, subtitled Japanese)

I have a question.

GIN (brightly, subtitled Japanese)

Who the fuck am I?

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

That is of no interest.

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

What, then?

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese?

GIN

Uh.  I'm showing off.

MAC

Something of a habit?

MAC

You know the alleged value of this

piece from some fucking

computer

,

which has no

clue

of the price I

can turn the scroll around for in

30

minutes

.

GIN

No, you can't.

GIN (

really

sorry)

It's sold.

MAC

Are you a confederate of my

adversaries?  Or are you just

stupid.

GIN (softly)

How about.  If I try humility.

MAC

Virginia Romay...

GIN

Gin, actually, Gin Romay.  I

was named after a card game.

MAC

Or a cheap cocktail.

MAC (softly)

As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay,

please.  With a twist.

GIN

You're supposed to be charming.

MAC

I'm supposed to be selective.

MAC

Art and Antiquities Acquisition

Advisor, how alliterative...

MAC

And am I the antiquity?

GIN

In mint condition.

GIN

Look, I've studied you, I know...

pretty much...everything.

GIN

Made your first millions selling

scrap metal.  Then, gold mining

concessions, gems, art, and lately

strategic metals for new technologies

- platinum, zirconium, titanium...

MAC

You said.  Everything.

GIN

The cat burglar stories?  Why

would anyone...with so much to

lose...take those kinds of risks?

GIN

You'd have to be.  Stupid.

MAC

Excuse me.

GIN

I didn't know Porsche made

things like this.

MAC

Well, they don't...

MAC

...as a rule.

GIN

Recognize that?

GIN

My seller is in Shinjuku, we can

go there tonight.

GIN

He wants 4.6 million.  I can

get it for three.

MAC

No, you can't.

MAC (O.S.)

...only it's not bloody

football

!

really

fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled,

MAC (O.S.)

...it's just that crap Americans

call

'football', like you could

call your ass a butterscotch scone

and have it

be

one!

MAC

Why you'd want to bring that

foolishness to

Japan

, you're

just pissing your investment

down a

bungee

hole.

SUMO GUY (major accent)

You got Cubano this trip?

MAC

Seriously, put the money into

pharmaceuticals or prostitution,

something

stable

.

MAC

Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial

plastics.

MAC

My favorite thing in life.

Coincidence.

GIN

I'm staying here, what's your

excuse?

MAC

Staying here, as well.  You

are in room...?

GIN (half a beat)

One thirty-eight.

MAC

Will you send a half-bottle of

Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,

please?  And some berries and

chocolates for the lady to enjoy

it with.

MAC

Actually, I was just across the

room, dickering with a gentleman

over the purchase of an interesting

Spitzweg.  Until I determined the

painting was apparently stolen...

MAC

Goes against my grain.  The

DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6

million you can get for 3.  Can

you get it for 2 and a half?

GIN

Sure.

MAC

My checkbook is in my safe.  You

wait here.

GIN

Okay.  I'll wait here.

GIN

That's my purse.

MAC

Just want to see if I'm with the

person you say you are.  Can't be

too caref...

MAC (quietly)

Oh, dear.

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

We'll go in there, and call

the police.

GIN

Are you all right?

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

I have damaged the car of these

kind people.  Please help them

call the police...

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

May I use a washroom, please.

MAC

These are my papers, passport, car

registration.  If the police arri...

GIN

You're going to need stitches,

let me get you to a hospital.

GIN

Really, this can all wait.

I'll handle it.

MAC

That's actually.  Very sweet.

MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)

Might you have a First Aid kit,

of some kind?

VOICE (subtitled Japanese)

Excuse me.

OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)

The company picnic.  Saturday or

Sunday?

MAC (subtitled Japanese)

Better eat first.

GIN

Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?

GIN

Uh.  Mr. Ma...

MAC (O.S., from the stall)

Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became

of a gentleman's privacy?

MAC (O.S.)

My God, more females?

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

Stand outside.  That door.  Two

minutes...

GIN

I was worried, it's been twenty...

MAC (O.S.)

Eighteen, actually.  The leg is

fine, but I got sort of...woozy.

GIN

Woozy.

MAC (O.S.)

Lost my stomach once or twice.

MAC

I'm an old man.  You probably

noticed.

MAC

You should see me without

my teeth.

MAC

Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up.

MAC

Odd place, this.

MAC

What do you suppose they make

here?  Video recorders?

GIN

Microchips, I think, for computers.

MAC

Bad investment.  The best ones

are here today...

MAC (O.S.)

Gone tomor...

GIN

This isn't the way to my sel...

MAC (quietly)

I've changed my mind.

GIN

Mind telling me why?

MAC

You can't get it for me at 2.5,

can you?

GIN

Well, we can tr...

MAC

You were setting me up.  The correct

price is 2.8.  You conspire with the

seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be

grateful when you 'bargain' him down

to three.  Close enough to fool some

people.  unfortunately...

MAC

I'm old.  I know what everything

is worth.

GIN

So where are we g...

MAC

I am going to the airport.  You

are going on to the rest of your

life.  Which...

MAC

...should be interesting.

GIN

You forgot your lugg...

MAC

The hotels deal with that.  The

things I need are always waiting

at the next one.

(afterthought)

I don't carry.  Baggage.

GIN

Sensible.  And you're off to...?

MAC

Oh, that's highly personal.

GIN

I did so hope to impress you.

GIN (hopeful)

I'm still hoping...

MAC

Young lady.  I am old enough to

be your grandfather.

GIN (soft)

My father.

GIN (whisper)

That's part of the rush.

TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)

Still on fo' airport?

GIN

Here.  A reward.

MAC

A reward for what?

GIN

For not being old.  After all.

MAC

You mean.  Not as old as I look.

GIN (a whisper)

Yeh.

GIN

Do I deserve a reward?

GIN

It's so hard to find good casual

sex, anymore.  I'm probably out

of practice.

MAC

What's hard to find.  Is someone

you truly want to be with.

MAC

Even for awhile.

GIN

It's lucky we stopped by my room,

for the wine.

GIN

Otherwise, we'd never have found

my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.

MAC

Would that make it more stolen?

GIN

They even got my prescriptions.

MAC

Something you need? There are

all-night chemists...

GIN

I take Prilosec.  For stomach

acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.

GIN

But since I didn't have to work

all that hard tonight...

GIN (softly)

Ouch.  I had that coming.

GIN

Why would someone steal

my

luggage?

Every guest

in

this place must

have more than a wannabe art dealer.

MAC

Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you

had something valuable in there.

GIN

Such as...

MAC

Well.  Wannabe dealers make

excellent fences.

GIN

He thought I had a stolen

painting.  In my bag.

MAC

I'm joking, of course.

MAC

The Vermeer wouldn't fit.

GIN

Excuse me?

MAC

Why, did you do something wrong?

GIN

You said.  Vermeer.

MAC

The most famous painting stolen

this week.

MAC

If you don't keep up on your

craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.

MAC

I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.

GIN

I love a guy who knows how to

sweet talk.

MAC

There was a call.  While you

were sleeping.

MAC

An art dealer I know.  He has a

Monet.  Minor, but it

is

Giverny.

He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.

GIN (cautiously)

We can maybe beat that.

MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)

I agree.  This is a bank debit card.

It gives the bearer access to an

account containing 4.6 and change.

I dislike round numbers.

MAC

I'd like you to go down there,

and pick up the painting.  If

that's all right.

GIN

Me.

MAC

If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You

just hand him the debit card, with

that...luminous smile.  And say,

take it or leave it.

MAC

Oh, dear.  I thought you so

wanted to make a good impression.

GIN

Thought I already did th...

MAC

And along with making an

excellent

impression.  You will also make 2

percent of the purchase price.

MAC

That's $92,000.  And change..

For two hours work.

MAC

Any problems.  Just give me

a ring.

GIN

Stolen painting is it?

MAC

Of course not.

MAC

If it was.  I wouldn't pay more

than three.

MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)

You have reached the voice-mail

of AMD Investments.  And, yes,

you

are

at the right place.

GIN (into phone, pissed)

I like men with a sense of humor.

This does

not

qualify.

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

May I please speak with Mr. Okati.

OKATI

You doin' it.

GIN

I think there's some mista...

OKATI

You from Mac?

GIN

I'm from Mac.

OKATI

Lemme see card.

OKATI

Four million, six hundred

thirteen thousand, five hundred?

GIN

You first.

does

look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.

GIN

Now bring me the real one.

OKATI

This as real as it gets, lady.

MAC (O.S.)

You got it?

GIN (into phone)

Is this an audition, a joke, or

a rip-off?  I'm staring at an

obvious forgery, here.

MAC (O.S.)

Turn it over.

MAC (O.S.)

Is there an envelope?  Taped to

the back?  In a Ziploc bag?

GIN (into phone)

Uh-huh.

MAC (O.S.)

Detach the bag.  Read what's

in it.  Aloud.

GIN (reading into phone)

Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it

says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,

statistics...specs on some kind of

machine, diag...

MAC (O.S.)

Papers

back

in the envelope,

envelope

back

in the Ziploc, very

quickly, without seeming to hurry...

MAC (O.S.)

Now take the debit card

from

your

purse, slipping the Ziploc

into

the

purse

as

you do it,

shielding

the move

from everyone in the room but Okati.

MAC (O.S., quietly)

Give him the card.

GIN (into phone)

Mac, the painting's a forg...

MAC (O.S., even quieter)

This is a test.  Of whether you'll

still be alive four minutes from

now.  Do you hear me?

GIN (into phone)

Yes, Mac, I do.

MAC (0.5.)

Now.  Hand him the card, and tell

him in Japanese to pretend he is

checking it by phone.  Tell him to

take awhile, as if he's on hold.

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

Mac says, pretend you're checking

this by phone, and take your ti...

OKATI (subtitled Japanese)

...like I'm on hold, sure.

MAC (O.S.)

While he's checking, look around

the room casually, as if searching

for the cheesy handbags...

MAC (O.S.)

All the while laughing, as if you

are chatting with someone you

actually

like

.

GIN (into phone)

I'm not that good.

MAC (O.S.)

As you're looking around, do you

notice any m...

GIN (into phone)

Three guys, two together, one

alone.  Cheap suits, not looking

at me in a cop-casual way.

MAC (O.S.)

Call out cheerily to Okati, in

English, 'Where's the toilet?'

GIN (into phone)

Can I say, 'little girl's room'?

MAC (O.S.)

Wing it.

GIN (calls out, cheerily)

WHERE'S THE CRAPPER?

MAC (O.S.)

Get going.  Now.

GIN (into phone, as she saunters)

Mac, the painting isn't...

MAC (O.S.)

You've got what we bought, are

you out of their sight?

MAC (O.S.)

Run

into the

men's

toilet.

I know you know how.

MAC (O.S., ominous)

Are you

running

?

GIN (subtitled Japanese)

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

MAC (O.S.)

Jump.

GIN (into phone)

It's too small.

MAC (O.S.)

The

window

, twit!

GIN

SHIIIIIIIIIIT...

MAC

ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

GIN

ACTUALLY.  IT'S INCREDIBLY COOL!

GIN

OH NOOOOOO...

GIN

WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?

MAC

JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!

GIN

FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU

TWIT

!!

MAC

HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING

CHANCE...

MAC

...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED

FROM THE BRITS!

GIN

I guess you're gonna explain

all this, huh?

MAC

Dry clothes, you'll need them.

In five minutes.

GIN

I'm supposed to change?

Here

??

MAC

I won't look.  Gentleman's word

of hon...

GIN

There are a million

sailors

!

MAC

I've seen you naked.  Give the

boys a thrill.

MAC

You probably won't be dating

any of them, so what the hell.

GIN (astonished)

These...these are mine!

MAC

Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps

the thief wasn't your size.

MAC

We have a business appointment.

In four minutes.

GIN

Business, huh?

MAC (never turns)

Time has come to tell you.  What

business.  I'm actually in.

GIN

Uh.  Am I gonna like th...

MAC (quietly)

I'm a thief.

believe

he's admitting this.

MAC

And now that I've told you.

I'll have to kill you.

MAC

Or...

MAC

...you can spend the most

interesting three weeks of

your life.  Training.

GIN

Training for wha...

MAC

...followed by the most exciting

night

of your life.  After which,

you can walk away with 20

million

untraceable

dollars...

means

this.

MAC

...which will come in handy.

Things being what they are.

MAC

From now on.  You can valet park.

GIN

And if I refuse?

MAC (very quietly)

Don't.  Please.

GIN

I mean, you won't

really

kill

me, I'm far too adorable.

MAC

Last night, at Fujitsu, I did

some business.  While you thought

I was in the toilet.

GIN

What could you possibly steal

in 18 min...

MAC

Thirty-five

super

-microchips.

Each worth one million dollars.

And change.

GIN

You hate round num...

MAC

I stole your suitcase when I

left you at the bar.  I have

since sent it on to the States,

with

three

chips, well hidden.

MAC

Since you aren't there to claim

it, the bag will sit at Customs.

Safe.  Unless...

MAC

They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip.

GIN

That's entrapment.

MAC

No, entrapment is what cops do

to robbers.

MAC

Blackmail.  Is what robbers

do to schmucks.

MAC (softly)

Even adorable ones.

MAC

Pop quiz.

MAC

Admit it's a rush.  The best day

of your heretofore drab life.

GIN

Fuck you.

GIN

...accompanied by related foreplay.

VOICE (O.S., British cheer)

Hullo, there!

MAN

Nickerson Carlsby, Mr...

MacDuff, yes?

MAC

Banquo MacDuff.  This is my

associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan.

CARLSBY

That is...fiancee

and

assoc...

GIN (cheery herself)

I'm a hyphenate.

CARLSBY

Well, it's a pleasure, in this

alien place, to do business with

a countryman.

MAC

I'm a Scot.  It's a different

country.  Culturally and historically.

CARLSBY (looking around)

Well.  They've brought you to

quite the wrong place, I see.

MAC (looking around)

Thank God.

CARLSBY (confidential code-voice)

In Penny Lane, the barber shaves

another customer...

CARLSBY

Five feet thick with hidden rein-

forcements, no way to drill through!

GIN (authoritative)

Impressive.

CARLSBY

Only the tip of our security

iceberg.  See these two Brinks

locks...?

CARLSBY

The Captain keeps one key.  The

other is continually forwarded:

to the Chief of Security at next

port.  There is no way to enter

during voyage.

GIN

I like this.

CARLSBY

The best armed guard, rotated every

six hours.  A redundancy, of course,

but we would rather be safe three

times over than merely two.

GIN

Sound mathematics.

MAC (very quiet)

What if there's a fire?  In the

chamber.

CARLSBY

Sprinklers.  New design.  Incredible

power.  The entire chamber is water-

proof, fireproof, airtight.  If the

ship

sinks

, God forfend, your cargo

is secure for salvage.

not

look convinced.

CARLSBY

And your cargo is...?

MAC

Wine.

MAC

The bloody Japs bought up half

the premium clarets in the universe.

You may have heard.

MAC

I'm in charge of shipping some

14,000 bottles, most quite rare,

to a number of premium hotels in

Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore,

Phuket, and Penang.

MAC

All of which are destinations on

your October voyage.  Five months

from now.  However...

MAC

Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be

jostled.

CARLSBY

Our 'delicate treasure' platforms,

suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo

remains unruffled by roiling seas.

Then, on arrival, is plucked...

CARLSBY

By that forklift, and gently

deposited on dock through the

cargo hatch...

MAC

Adequate.  I suppose.

MAC

Did we see...a bathing pool.

On deck?

CARLSBY

Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru

carries sixteen luxury suite pas-

senger cabins.  The finest cuisine.

For valued clients who prefer to

cruise in privacy.

MAC

Mildly.  Interesting.

MAC

Adequate.  I suppose.

GIN

But dearest, in five months,

we'll be in Cape Town.

MAC

Anything sooner?  That goes

perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka?

To Jakarta.

CARLSBY

Why, yes.  In three weeks.

MAC (O.S.)

You seem depressed.

GIN

At your insistence, I'm leaping

to my death, and I don't know

why

!

MAC

Because.  You're a greedy girl.

GIN

I'm not jumping until you

talk

about this, it's been two

days

!

GIN

Why are we going in three

weeks

,

if the wine is on a

different

route months lat...

MAC

There

is

no wine.  That just bought

us a look at their security.

GIN

I knew that.

MAC

What

we

want is on the boat in

three weeks.  Now can we jump?

GIN

The machine in those diagrams.  on

the back of the painting.

GIN

What does it do, make gold?

MAC

We're nearing the targ...

GIN

Why won't you trust me?

MAC

How do I know who you are, hmmn?

MAC

For all I know, your name isn't

Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're

a cop.

GIN

Why would a cop do all th...

MAC (softly)

Entrapment, remember? What cops

do to robbers.

GIN (just as softly)

Oh.  That.

MAC

One...two...

GIN

Mac, I'm afraid.

GIN

Of you.

MAC (a murmur)

Smart girl.

GIN

NEXT TIME, I'M ON TOP!

MAC

Consistent.  And rather impressive.

MAC

All right, six and seven...

MAC

Three and four...

GIN

What the hell are we building?

MAC

A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse.

MAC

Forty seconds.

GIN

Get your

fucking

equipment

together, man, this is a

professional

operation!!

MAC (O.S.)

This time, when you raise your

arm.  Don't breathe.

MAC

Very, very nice.  Had a tour

with the Mosad, did you?

GIN

Where does this fit in the

game plan?

MAC

Oh, it doesn't.  But one

never knows...

MAC

You might need it with me.

GIN

Shit.

GIN (O.S.)

DID I SAY SHIT?

GIN

This one, I will

not

get!

MAC

But you will, you'll get it all.

You are actually...

MAC

Quite remarkable.

MAC

Take the rest of the evening off.

VOICE (O.S.)

Webber Assurance.

GIN (O.S.)

This is oh-four-six-one.  Hector

Cruz, please, on a secure line.

VOICE (O.S.)

Please hold.

VOICE (O.S.)

Go ahead, please.

GIN (O.S.)

Thank y...

GIN

...no way I'm telling you shit.

CRUZ (O.S.)

Baker, this is an extremely

dangerous

g...

GIN

...right now,

you're

more dangerous

than he is.

CRUZ (O.S.)

You want to explain th...

GIN

If I tell you

what

this is, and

where

this is, you'll send back-up,

and those morons will blow my cover,

and I'll be too dead to accept your

apology.

CRUZ (O.S.)

You're fucking him, aren't you?

GIN

Right to the wall.

CRUZ (O.S.)

You're over your head, Baker.

GIN

Only romantically.  I'll write to

him in prison.

CRUZ (O.S.)

Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time

I see you, I owe you a spanking.

GIN

Ooooo.  Is that a promise?

CRUZ (O.S.)

While you're on secure, do you want

a transfer?

GIN

Nope.  I'm headed back to the hot

tub.  I'll call again, if I'm in

the mood.

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

Is it over?

QIU (subtitled Mandarin)

...it's not over yet, it hasn't

even begun.

QIU (subtitled Mandarin)

...after Midnight, when his meeting

ends.  In Zhongnanhai.

QIU (subtitled Mandarin)

The mask will be ready...

QIU (subtitled Mandarin)

You fucking bring the bones.

HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)

We send this to the lab for finer

analysis.  One piece of advice,

huh...?

HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)

No more red pepper in your eye.

Not for awhile.

GIN (O.S.)

I'm freezing my tender parts.

MAC (O.S.)

I'm relieved to hear you have some.

MAC

What's amazing, is that only eleven

workers died during construction of

this thing...

GIN (grim)

...thanks for sharing...

MAC

Of course, the others were saved by

a safety net.

MAC (loving it)

Now, as for the suicides, they

always jump

facing

the city.  Avoids

that tall fence about 50 stories down,

see it, there?

GIN

I never liked you.

GIN

One act of fucking human kindness...

MAC

Call it a lapse.

GIN

And how does

this

fit into

the game pl...

MAC

Oh, it doesn't.  We came for

the view.

MAC

To Ginger Baker.

GIN

I'm partial to drummers.  If they

played with Clapton and Winwood.

GIN

The prescription bottle.  When you

stole my suitcase.

GIN

Armand Baker was my husband, May 13

to October 27, 1982, he played alto

sax, I was 17 years old.

GIN

He named me Ginger.  He likes

drummers, too.

MAC

And you get sentimental for him.

Every time you order drugs.

GIN

I have I.D. in that name.  I use

it for various things I don't want

traced.  When credit unions turn

their computers my way.

MAC

I could listen to you lie all night.

GIN (softly)

Same here, fella.

MAC

Do you like diamonds?

MAC

You asked.  Does the machine.

Make gold.

MAC

Gold is shit.  It's six thousand

dollars a pound.  Worth your weight

in gold...?

MAC

That would put you at seven

hundred thousand.

GIN

Would you pay it?

MAC

When the light hits you just

right.  I'd pay more.

GIN

The machine.  That we are stealing.

Makes diamonds?

GIN

Real ones?

MAC

Gem quality.  First ever.  God

save Japan.

MAC

A diamond reactor takes graphite,

runs it through a combination of

lasers, electron beams, and scanning-

tunnel mg microscopes.

MAC

This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,

with a new isotope of krypton.

MAC

The atoms are rearranged.  And

the molecule of graphite becoznes

a molecule of...

GIN

I hate it.  When you make

a point.

STEWARD (O.S.)

All right, then.  All set.

STEWARD

We will keep your passports in

our safe until Jakarta.

MAC

Of course.

STEWARD

You are Suite 16...

GIN

...and never been kissed.

MAC

We had booked Suite 9.

STEWARD

16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far

superior, trust me.

STEWARD

You luggage is

in

the room,

these

are your keys, the housekeeper

will show you t...

GIN (pouting)

Oh.  Can't we stroll around the

port?  Just a little?

STEWARD

I'd be on board in forty minutes.

Just to be safe.

GIN (sweet smile)

Better safe.  Than sorry.

MAC

Down there.  Ten o'clock.

GIN

Are you dumping fuel?

MAC

Changed my mind.  There's nothing

on the instruments downrange.  The

longer she flies before she ditches,

the less chance they notice on the

Bridge.

MAC

You should lose the oxygen tank

at 8000 feet.

GIN

And how do I judge that?  Babe's

intuition?

GIN

So I just ask you on the way down?

Or were you planning to e-mail me.

MAC

I hate a crybaby.

MAC (simply)

You can do this.

GIN

FLARE, FLARE...

MAC

It's over, it's over...

MAC

Catch your breath, quickly.

Hang on for the wake.

GIN

DO IT! GO!

MAC

HOLD TIGHT!

GIN

IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!

MAC

If I were you, I'd watch

the desserts.

GIN

Boy, I'll bet you were in

shape before you got old.

MAC

Too long ago to remember.

GIN

I can take it from here, thanks.

GIN

If you'd packed my primary chute

right, I wouldn't ha...

MAC

Yes, you would.  You're a girl.

MAC (O.S.)

Anytime you're ready.

MAC

Better angle.

MAC

You might want to move aside...

MAC

May I trouble you for the torch?

Or would you rather just dance.

GIN

I know I packed it.

MAC

Coal into diamonds.  A wealth

machine.

GIN

How do you know that's it?

MAC (as if stating the obvious)

It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's

the only thing worth waterproofing,

in case the ship sinks.

GIN (softly)

...you twit.

MAC

Hmmn?

GIN

I'm just finishing your sentence.

Can't you answer a question with-

out making me feel stupid?

MAC

Why would I bother?

GIN (concerned)

They don't

look

like flotation

bags...

MAC (working fast)

Shit.  Well then, let's forget

the whole thing.

GIN

Okay, it was a dumb ques...

MAC

Let's get one thing straight.  I

don't work with partners much,

because basically, I find most

people to be idiots.

MAC

You, in contrast, are first-rate.

MAC

And if

I

think so.  Maybe

you

should start thinking the same.

Now move your ass.

MAC

GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled

signal by satellite...

MAC

Precise coordinates.  You could

find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.

GIN

Where you g...

MAC (walking away)

Fork lift.

GIN

That's

my

assignm...

MAC (turning back)

Unless you've got the keys,

someone has to hot wire it.

MAC

Finish up on the floaters.

GIN

Won't they hear it?

MAC (O.S.)

Over these engines?  Through five

feet of steel?

MAC (O.S.)

Hell, if they do, they don't have

the second key to get in.

MAC

Thank God for redundant security.

really

straining.

GIN

How many tries do I get?

MAC (with effort)

One, before I beat you senseless,

dump you over the side, and donate

your share to charity.

GIN

You gotta work on that impatient

streak.

GIN (amazed)

How professional.

GIN

Uh.  Thing on the left is

the brakes?

MAC (laconic)

Or the thing on the right.

GIN

MAC, IT'S JAMMED!

MAC

JUMP, for God's sa...

MAC

You did activate the floaters.

GIN

Activa...

MAC

I did say, 'Finish up on the

floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.

MAC (softly)

Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.

GIN

Um...

GIN

...I wouldn't do that.

MAC

Excuse me?

GIN

Well...I saw our suction things.

Lying...over...there?

GIN (a mouse)

...so I put 'em in my pack?

GIN

Or maybe.  I put 'em there.

MAC

I like a quick study.

MAC

...no matter how many stones we

make, the diamonds are just an

appetizer.

GIN (dreamily)

And the meal...?

MAC

My contract.  With DeBeers.

GIN

Oh my G...

MAC

Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world

monopoly in diamonds based on one

simple principle...something's only

priceless if it's scarce.

MAC

These guys dig up all the diamonds

on the planet, just to keep them

out

of circulation.  Otherwise, you could

buy 'em at the Five and Dime...

GIN

Watch the old guy stuff, they don't

have dimestores anym...

MAC

Imagine the chaos

we

could cause.

GIN

You said 'contract'...

MAC

We're sort of bounty hunters.

MAC

Our machine is worth

far

more

dead.  Than alive.

VOICE (O.S.)

Glad to see you're both alive.

STEWARD

When you missed cocktails.

And

supper.  I thought of knocking

on your door...

GIN

Oh, I

wish

you had.  We

love

having

strangers join us!  Maybe

later

...?

MAC

Promise you an interesting time...

MAC

Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff.

MAC

...well, I

would

ask what you're

doing with the rest of your life.

But that's your own bloody affair,

isn't it?

GIN

Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too

choked up on the farewell.  I feel

I owe you a confession.

GIN

Time has come to tell you.  What

business.  I'm actually in.

MAC

Not here.

MAC

It only looks dangerous...

MAC

You couldn't fall off.  Unless

someone threw you over.

MAC

More intimate.  For a confession.

MAC

What business.  You are actually.

In.

GIN

Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer.

MAC

Of course not.  You're a cop.

MAC

An insurance investigator for

Webber Assurance, your boss is

an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've

been there four years and ten

months, you're quite the rising star.

GIN (evenly)

Nope.

MAC (very softly)

Nope?

GIN

I'm a thief, Mac.

GIN

For five years, I've used the

database of every client Webber

has to plan my jobs.  Museums,

banks, jewelers, rich people, I

have floor plans, alarm codes,

passwords, the works.

GIN

I've made a fortune.  It's not

enough.

MAC

Why n...

GIN

Why wasn't it enough for you?

GIN

The Vermeer that was stolen from

Hancock Tower?  That was my job.

I scaled the building with

electromagnets, and parachuted

down an air vent...

GIN

...

after

mailing the painting.  To

where we're going next, actua...

MAC (quietly)

We.

GIN

Yeh, we.  You passed the audition.

MAC (a murmur)

Imagine my relief.

GIN

I need a partner.  For the biggest,

smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you

retire off of, because nothing else

could ever compare with the rush.

MAC

Ever.  Is such a long time.

GIN

This is a job that can only be done

in

one

place, in

one

split-second

in human history.  If we miss that

instant.  We lose.

MAC

And it's worth...?

GIN

Eight

billion

dollars.  That's

eight

thousand million

.

MAC

How much in shillings?

GIN

You're not a real trusting guy.

MAC

And I tried so hard to hide that.

GIN

It's two jobs.  The first steals

something priceless from the National

Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't

keep that.  We trade it in for our

ticket to the show.

MAC

One moment in time, you s...

GIN

Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight

days from now.  The moment that

Hong Kong is annexed by china.

GIN

80-20 split.

MAC

Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's

your plan, you should take at least

thirty perc...

GIN

My

80,

your

20.  Asshole.

MAC

50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei.

MAC

What are you gonna do with six

billion dollars that you can't do

with four?

GIN

Hold the record.  Alone.

MAC

Your share is 50%.  And one dollar.

GIN

I like what you left.  In the hold.

MAC

You didn't even see wha...

GIN

A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers.

A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.

GIN

Squeeze hard.

GIN

That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's

my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide.

MAC

No surprise.

MAC (gently)

Tired?

GIN

I have a lot on my mind.

MAC

You look beautiful doing it.

GIN (O.S.)

You wanna buy a Vermeer?

MAC

Rather steal it.

GIN (O.S.)

Been there, done that.

GIN

National Palace Museum, Taipei,

Taiwan.  Repository of four

thousand years of Chinese culture...

GIN

Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,

pots and scrolls, paintings and

porcelains and lacquer work.  Every

treasure the Kuomintang could loot

before the Reds took over.

(beat)

Ever rob the place?

MAC

No.  If memory serves.

GIN

You need to eat something, or

are you ready for sex?

MAC (torn)

The options seem so limited.

MAC

Ginny...?

MAC (reads)

This lovely parting gift can be

yours.  If the price is right.

MAC

Good morning.

MAC

Quite a parting gift.  I would

have settled for roses.

GIN

It's a joke.  You know, a joke?

People who have a sense of humor

make them?

GIN

You're rich, go buy an American,

have him fill you in on the culture.

MAC

Ah.  American culture.  Well,

that

is

a joke.

MAC (murmurs)

Relax.  It's only eight billion

dollars.

MAC (softly)

Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of

Delft better than the larger one.

The sky is more emotionally rendered.

GIN

Nice.  When a sky is that.

MAC

Is it easier now? Not pretending.

MAC

Not pretending you're an innocent.

Not pretending you...like me.

MAC

Here's a tip from an old-timer.

Never forget who you are...

MAC

It gives you someone to be.  When

you stop pretending.

MAC (still soft)

So.  Our train runs from the museum,

through an underground tunnel.  To

a mountain.

GIN

Because the museum displays 10,000

relics at any given moment.  But

there are 60

times

that many, stored

in the mountain.

GIN

Which is why it's guarded.  By an

army.

GIN

The train shuttles relics to and

from storage.  It looks exactly

like that.

GIN

I've been down the air ducts four

times.  The train always has two

armed guards.  Always travels between

32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics

don't like to be jostled too much.

MAC (all business now)

Your model has five vents.

GIN

We go down the first.  Back up the

third, if you're lucky.  If not, we

have

to get out by the fourth.

MAC (simply)

Then we will.

GIN

Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.

This switch is on-off.

MAC

Seems like overkill.  For one

simple jump.

GIN

Well, it's an eight billion

dollar jump.  You miss the

train...you've missed the train.

GIN

We've got five days to grab the

Bones, trade them for the Scan, and

pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong.

Once midnight passes on July 1st...

MAC

...we've missed the train, yeh.

The Bones?  The Scan?

GIN

Oh.  Have I neglected to fill

in the details?

MAC

An oversight.

GIN

Which I learned from the master.

Hey.  Wish me luck...

really

pissed.

MAC (quietly)

Jump sooner.

GIN

Be my fucking guest.

MAC

I'm too

old

for this shit!

GIN

Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?

GIN (softly)

Forget it.

extremely

short skirt, revealing

GIN

Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?

GIN

Five years, you won't need

make-up.

MAC

We agreed.  No underwear.

GIN

Overkill.  I can do it with legs.

MAC

I'd lose the underwear.

GIN

The Oracle Bones date back to the

Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.

They are writings...carved into

ox bones, tortoise shells...

GIN

The oldest Chinese writing any-

where, the first proof of Chinese

civilization.

MAC

What makes

this

one so valuable?

MAC (subtitled Italian)

Except it's Chien-lung,

mimicking

Sung Period.  The color is far too

delicate.

real

insulted.  Apparently, he's right.

MAC (subtitled German)

It's all right, you have a nice

body.

MAC

When you're old, you can do

anything

GIN

There we are.

GIN

Last year, ancient artifacts were

discovered in the Gulf of Mexico.

An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.

GIN

Amazingly, markings on these

Olmec figures were identified

as Shang Dynasty writing...

GIN

This

particular

Bone is price-

less, because it is the one that

establishes the

link

.

Proves

that

American civilizations descend from

Chinese ancestors.

GIN

Exactly the kind of propaganda

shit they eat up in Beijing.  The

mainland would pay

anything

to get

its paws on th...

MAC (old guy voice)

SHIT!  BLOODY

HELL

!!!

very

slowly...

GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)

Those are the coins.  These

are my legs.

MAC (old guy voice)

Amanda!  Time for my pills!

GIN

...no, I don't think that way.

GIN

...and I suppose you do?

MAC

Get lonely?  Sure, all the time.

It's healthy.

MAC

What's unhealthy.  Is denial.

GIN

Be real.  you could never see

yourself...you know, quitting the

game.  Settling...down.

MAC

Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.

GIN (strapping on a backpack)

...way we can use those in here.

I thought I was in charge of

this operat...

MAC

You're in charge of ego and worrying.

I'm in charge of keeping you alive.

MAC

These are plasma jet.  All the

force is directed forward, instead

of dissipating in a sphere like a

grenade.

GIN

I don't need th...

MAC (whispers)

Shut up.

MAC

You don't trust me, you won't get

through this.

MAC

Try to adjust to that for three

more days.  After July 1...

MAC

...you'll never have to trust again.

MAC

Something.  To look forward to.

GIN

WE HAVE TO ABORT!

MAC

HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER

OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE

INCONVENIENCE?

GIN

THEY'VE GOT AN

ARMY

DOWN TH...

MAC

I can do this.

GIN (through mask)

THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY

45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!

GIN (through mask)

TEST THE CASE!

GIN (through mask)

TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!

GIN (through mask)

THIRD VENT GONE!

GIN

THERE'S THE FOURTH!

GIN

OUR LAST CHANCE, THE FIFTH IS

AT THE BARRACKS!

GIN

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

MAC

ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.

MAC

FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE.

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

There you are!  Do you know how

filthy this place is?

SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)

Madam, no one is supp...

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll

need eight pairs.

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

Unless you're too busy to help me.

SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)

Well, no, I...

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

Come to think of it, I need some

dresses for evening...

GIN (subtitled Mandarin)

Are you coming?

MAC (subtitled Mandarin)

It's all right, the security cameras

behind the mirrors are working again.

MAC (subtitled Mandarin)

Well.  If everything is in order...

MAC

WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY

IS

THIS?  IN

BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE

WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!

MAC (subtitled Mandarin)

FUCKING

HELL

!  WATCH WHERE

YOU'RE GOING, MAN!

SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)

I believe I took your case.

SOLDIER

21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.

BUTLER

Will you please come this way?

MAC

I like this.

GIN

You like wha...

MAC

Not being told what the fuck

we're doing.

GIN

You're on a 'need to know' basis.

You'll get each step in time to

execute, I thought you agreed to

those condit...

MAC (quietly)

I like your not trusting me.

Because it frees me to do

the same.

GIN

I trust you.  I only need to...

MAC

...remain in control.

MAC

Which is a sign of weakness.

MAC

I like that, too.

GIN

Colonel

QIU

You look lovely, Ginger.  Is

the rose for me?

GIN

Of course.

GIN

Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is

Andrew MacDougal.

GIN

Real names here, darling.  The

Colonel and I have every incentive

to keep each other's secrets.

QIU

Like the place, Andy?

MAC

Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.

QIU

This way.  Doesn't matter if we

spill.

MAC

My sentiments exactly.

QIU

This place was a gift.  From

its former owner.  A Brit whose

business will now happily continue

to function.  Perhaps...even expand.

MAC (spreading his napkin)

Planning to spend much time here?

QIU

Tho it has required many sacrifices.

GIN

The Colonel has divorced his

wife.  To facilitate the necessary

entertaining of Western women.

QIU

Tho some are more entertaining

than others.

MAC

Colonel.  You are touching the woman

I love...

MAC

From time to time.

QIU

You're a Scot.  Would you like

some 25-year-old Macallan?

MAC

Sure, I'll take a case.

GIN

The Colonel told his Minister

of Culture that he could mount

a surgical raid to liberate this

treasure from Taiwan.

MAC

Ah.  How much was the Minister

told the raid would cost?

QIU (not looking up)

Counting equipment, personnel,

bribes, an even fifty million

American.  All in.

MAC

Which you can now keep.

QIU

He would have paid twice that.

But my needs are modest.

QIU

Unlike.  The woman you love.

From time to time.

GIN

How do I look, honey?

MAC

Like a woman.  Of mystery.

GIN

In the Hong Kong and Shanghai

Bank Building.  Is a room with

two computers.  One for you.

And one for me.

MAC

Glad I have a function, here.

GIN

The room is a vault on the 14th

floor.  Access codes to that room

are changed daily, computer pass-

words on the hour,

but

...

GIN

Four

men in the

world

.  Don't

need

codes.  Their retinas will scan to

unlock everything.  One of these is

China's Minister of Finance.

MAC

And his retinal plate is in there.

MAC

Our trade for the great train

robbery.  All right, let's say

we're in the door.  Now what?

GIN

Hong Kong has a huge portion of its

holdings invested in foreign banks.

In hundreds of separate accounts...

GIN

This CD ROM is programmed to send,

instantaneously,

thousands

of instruc-

tions,

with

all necessary confirmation

codes, to transfer reasonably modest

sums

out

of those accounts....

MAC

Modest.

GIN

Two or three million at a crack,

in odd numbers.  Total, eight

billion.  And change.

MAC

And you've set up a laundry.

GIN

Every wire transfer gets rocketed

through a series of multiple switches,

Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel

Islands, the Caymans...

MAC (quietly)

Seychelles?

GIN (beat)

I left that out.

MAC

You're forgiven.

GIN

Thank you.  As soon as each deposit

lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere

else, til the

Mafia

couldn't find it.

MAC

But those

first

instructions,

transferring the 8 billion dollars.

They're

recorded

in the main computer.

GIN

Nope.  The CD instructs the computer

to

erase

the real transactions.

And replace them in its memory

with an innocuous loan coded XJ6.

Little homage to Limeyland, there.

MAC

Dearest.  The

accounts

won't

reconcile.

GIN

Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer

to

over-report

all account totals

forever, in the exact amounts we've

lifted.  So the Chinese think the

money's still there.

MAC

The money.  Is still.  Missing.

GIN

Sure, the foreign banks know

they sent out some money.  But

they think Hong Kong knows it,

too.  And since we're leaving

plenty

in

every account...

MAC

The shit doesn't splatter.  Until

the first account runs dry.

GIN

And

then

.  Comes the really

brilliant

part of the whole

thing!

MAC

I was hoping there'd be one.

GIN

Admit it, so far you're

blown away.

MAC

It does sound like the beginning

of a beautiful friendship.

MAC

Pity it will be over.  In

21 hours.

GIN

Bet you say that.  To all the

one-night-stands.

MAC

No, ma'am...

MAC

Only the best of them.

MAC

Nice of the Colonel to provide an

invitation...

GIN

Well, I promised him a bonus.

Five million.  Comes out of

your share.

MAC

...long as I don't have to have

sex with him.

MAC (politely)

We'll take the next one.

MAC (subtitled Mandarin)

What time tomorrow do the tanks

roll in?

MAC

So all that time, sitting at your

computers.  All the research, the

access codes your job allowed you

to steal, floor plans, schematics...

setting up all your bank accounts...

MAC

Years of work, comes down to....

(checks his watch)

...six minutes.  Don't be

nervous.  Easy come, easy go.

MAC

Your share prob'ly works out

to, what?  Dollar and a quarter

an hour?

GIN

What's your point?

MAC (very real)

That I like you, Ginger.

MAC

The dedication, the skill,

the guts...

MAC

I'm going to see you get

everything you deserve.

MAC

Woman.  If you can't have

fun, right now.  You're in

the wrong business.

GIN (whispers)

Open.  Sesame.

GIN

Uploading.  And you've got...

two minutes, fifty seconds.

MAC

So let's see.  Across town at

the British Consulate...

MAC (V.O.)

...everyone is working frantically

to complete transactions before

they go off-line at midnight.

MAC

...then, deep in the high-tech

bowels of the Bank of China

Building, just across the square...

MAC (V.O.)

...the Chinese are sitting on

their thumbs, waiting to come

on-line at midnight.

MAC

I feel for these boys.  Let's

give them a breather, hmmn?

MAC

We'll let the Brits go off-line

4 seconds early.

later

than the others.

MAC

And we'll give our new Chinese

overlords 4 extra seconds of rest

before they have to go on-line.

MAC

Playing God here, Ginger.  We've

created 8 seconds that do not

exist, anywhere but in this room.

MAC

8 seconds, where no one is on-line

but your little CD-Rom.

MAC

And when, eventually, everyone

discovers what transaction XJ6

was

really

about...

GIN

China will think it happened

before

midnight.  Britain will

swear it happened

after

midnight...

MAC

They'll each be positive.  The

other guy.  Did it.

MAC

Liable to be an ugly international

incident.

GIN

Britain off-line in 18 seconds.

We're bulletproof.

MAC

Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is

bulletproof.  Ever.

MAC

Britain goes bye-bye in 6...

5...4...3.

GIN (softly)

Jesus God, it's going through.

MAC (watching his clocks)

Hong Kong midnight, happy new year.

Except at China Bank.

GIN (to her screen)

C'mon, c'mon...

MAC

Feel like a nightcap?

GIN

The CD won't come out of

the driver.

MAC

Relax, don't jam it...

GIN (jamming it)

FUCKING

THING!!

MAC

Don't panic, now, there's no rush...

GIN

We can't leave it IN THERE, it's

got all our

accounts

, everything

that can NAIL us to a goddam

CROSS

!!

MAC

Easy with that, there's no ru...

GIN

There's a rush.

GIN

LET'S MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU

WAITING F...

MAC

The disc.  Is still in there.

GIN

We can't help it, we...we've

gotta...

GIN

What a guy.

MAC

Was wondering where to leave

this...

MAC (quietly)

Time to go.

GIN

They don't know we're the

bad guys.

MAC

Time they find out.

GIN

Okay.  How do we get down?

MAC

Down?  I never liked down.

GIN (out of breath)

WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!

MAC (not)

SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!

MAC

You can do this.

GIN

Okay, now what?

MAC (absently)

Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-

know' basis.

GIN

Mac, I'm sorry.

GIN

Turns out, I'm a screw-up.

MAC

Well.  Something to be said for

being self-aware.

MAC

May I have the last grenade, dear.

It's about to rain.

MAC

You see, banking

will

be more

democratic under China.

MAC

Well.  No more glass ceiling.

MAC

How refreshing.  The night air.

GIN

I can't do this.

MAC

You can.  If I say so.

MAC

If you stay.  You'll have to pay

for the damage...

MAC

Now that split.  Did we say

60-40?

GIN

HEY!

MAC

Got the keys?

GIN

I thought you could...hot-wire

stuff?

MAC

They fix those things so you

can't steal them...

MAC

These, they're not so worried.

MAC

Go grab that hook.

MAC

Let me rephrase that.

Run

and grab that hook.  Or

die

...

GIN (O.S.)

SHIT!  DON'T

DO

THAT!

MAC

This only works if you shut

your eyes.

GIN

You're not gonna lower me over

the side.

MAC

Of course not.  Now close baby

eyes...

(she won't)

Suit yourself.

GIN

OH NOOOOOOOOOO....

MAC

Let go NOW!!

MAC

Planning.

MAC

And dumb luck.

GIN

God, I hate you.

MAC (softly)

Good.  I hate you, too.

MAC (into phone)

...if I can't have my usual

suite, I'll take my business

to the Bristol, simple as that.

MAC (into phone)

...why indeed should I be more

loyal to you than you've been to

me?  Think it over.

MAC

You ran your calls.

GIN

All

the transactions,

all

the

transfers.  It's a miracle.

MAC

Why?  The CD erased the trans-

actions, all accounts seem in

order.  It looks like the thieves

were stopped in time.

is

a miracle.

GIN

The Colonel says police have

nothing.  A man in black-tie, a

blonde in a gown.  The elevator

guards saw faces, but no mug shots

to ID.  I think it's over.

MAC

Except it never is, really.

Quite.  Over.

GIN

Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol,

huh?  In...Paris?

MAC

You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,

and the nine-to-five?

GIN

Not hardly.  I've arranged to be

killed in a car crash.  On Taipei.

Amazing how little it costs.

MAC

Well.  You want to watch those

pennies.

GIN

I could arrange for two.  In that

crash.

MAC

You know, for a bitch.  You can

be awfully sweet.

GIN

Woman of mystery.  What do you say?

I like the Bristol, just fine.

mean, it's not the Ritz...

MAC

You know, all night I've been

wrestling with something...

GIN

Not the most flattering way to

put it.

MAC

I've changed your travel plans.

GIN

Mine.

MAC

Instead of taking the subway to

the airport, you change at Jordan

Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?

MAC

Jordan is only 90 seconds up the

line.  Like a wire transfer, you're

gone.  Vanished.

MAC

In this bag are passports,

tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a

good one.  A dress you can slip on

in five seconds.

MAC

You're on a tight connection to

the Trans-Siberian Express, be in

Europe in a week.

GIN

Mac, wh...

MAC

Shhh.  You always talk too much.

MAC

Time has come to return the favor.

One last time.

MAC

Tell you.  What business.  I'm

actually in.

GIN (hushed)

My God.  You're a cop.

MAC (very softly)

That's my girl.

MAC

See, my profession was cover,

too.  A notorious thief has access

to colleagues, their plans...

MAC

I've turned in...well, couple

hundred.  over forty years.

Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...

MAC

Thought I might retire.  After you.

GIN

And all the...microchips, the

diamond machine...

MAC

Well, the chips were returned.

The machine was just a box, did

you

actually

think it was real?

GIN

I thought...everything was real.

Stupid girl.

GIN

Those were

your

jobs, so I could

have claimed entrapment.  You had

to wait.  For mine.

GIN

The Oracle Bone...

MAC

Well, the State Department liked

that one.  They have more fish to

fry with Beijing than Taiwan.

MAC

So they're taking credit for

letting it go through.  Tho I'm

afraid your Colonel may be in for

a career disappointment.

GIN

And the 5 billion.

MAC

I haven't told them.

MAC

I said you hadn't revealed the

job.  That it wouldn't take place

until after the changeover.

MAC

Don't look, they're there.

GIN

And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?

MAC

Well.  Kept my options open.  If

I give you up, they don't matter,

do they?

GIN

If.

MAC

Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One

was retirement.  With four billion

dollars.  After all, I know some

places where life could be private...

GIN

But you couldn't do that, huh?

GIN

Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.

MAC

Creature of habit.  I suppose.

GIN

Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...

MAC

Keep smiling.  They won't move,

until I raise my left arm.

MAC

I thought.  Well, I've got the CD.

I could contact the banks, reverse

all the transactions...

MAC

...except maybe.  Leave you with...

oh, a hundred million, say.  To

tide you over.

MAC

Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.

MAC

I figured.  What the hell?

MAC

Let her keep the lot.

MAC

No rush.  The doors won't close for

60 seconds.

MAC

There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach

in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point

it at my temple.

MAC

You can do it.  If I say you can.

MAC

Step onto the car, keep the

pistol trained on my face.

MAC

Seems I was wrong.

MAC

Entrapment.  Is what robbers.

Do to cops, huh?

MAC

Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the

shoulder, it'll slow them down.

GIN

Oughta shoot you in the face.

MAC

Come on, you can do it, if I sa...

GIN

No way.  Not anymore.

MAC

Ten seconds, hold on.

GIN

When do I see you?

MAC

Airport.  Changing at Mongkok

Station, we can cut her off.

MAC

She might lose the wig, be looking

brunette

or

blonde, navy pants suit...

AGENT

I think Yaumatei changes for the

airport, and it's closer.

MAC (O.S.)

I think you're wrong, but cover it.

You got maybe four minutes.

MAC (O.S., calmly)

No problem.  She's trapped.
