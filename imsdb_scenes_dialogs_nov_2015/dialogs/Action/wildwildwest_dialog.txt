And they says you scientists are

supposed to be smart.

SALOON GIRL (O.S.)

The legendary Captain James West

and I finally got him all to

myself.

That's right, sugar, and you

should feel free to treat him

just bad.

WEST

(to himself)

General McGrath's boys. I thought

y'all was never gonna show up.

SALOON GIRL

Mister West, you wouldn't be here

workin' tonight, now would you?

WEST

No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight.

Would you be working if you were up

here with you?

SALOON GIRL

Good.

They start kissing again. He surreptitiously peeks out

the knothole, while continuing his kiss.

6   INT. FAT-CAN CANDY'S - NIGHT                                  6

This two-story, Victorian building across town is a

"gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. Drunken

roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul

the rouged-up tarts.

AT BAR - WOMAN

shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse

Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and

makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not

to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make

eye contact with two men seated at a table across the

parlor.

SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON

HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored

suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under

a homburg hat. As for his companion...

McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating

like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized

Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.

His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to

be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at

our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.

ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this

Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB

licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.

Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.

DORA

I'm sorry. That won't be

possible. I have... tonsillitis.

7   EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT         7

The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon. We see the wheel

of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water

tower.

BIG REB

Pack'er up good, Virgil.    Next stop

N'Orleans.

8   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                     8

West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching

her.

SALOON GIRL

(admonishing)

Jim!

WEST

Ah, this hole is a safety issue.

I'm thinking, what if it starts to

rain and the water level goes up.

It could suck you right up. I'm

protecting you. (variations)

Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts

(with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with

them.

SALOON GIRL

Problem solved.

WEST

Belle, you don't just ram a man's

underbritches into a knothole.

You wanna plug the hole, you ram

your own britches in there.

West is at a loss.    She moves in for another kiss.

WEST

(serious)

Much as I'd like to take credit

for that you might need to hand

me my gun...

WEST

... Hand me my gun.

McGRATH

I'm still waiting on my guns and

ammo, but I see my men have

brought your merchandise.

McGRATH

I had expected to be delivering it

personally to Mr...

HUDSON

My employer, here in a brothel?

(a small ironic

smile)

That would be quite... redundant.

Now...

the 'merchandise'?

McGRATH

Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't

planning to walk those oaken

stairs with you. Direct me to the

poot, sir. Something young and

creamy. A gamer that takes to the

crop and spur.

EYE-CROSSED REB

You drive a hard bargain, lady.

All right, fifty cents to take

them big juicy lips and...

DORA

Still not interested.

EYE-CROSSED REB

But you gotta be interested.

You're a whore.

DORA

(baritone)

That doesn't mean a girl can't

have high standards.

Could I have a little privacy

here?

WEST

Thank you.

WEST

You'll have to excuse me,

darlin'... but my evidence is

getting away.

WEST

Sorry about there not being any

towels.

GORDON/DORA

(demurely; back to

his falsetto)

Dora. Would you like to go

upstairs?

McGRATH

Oh, indeedy I would.

EYE-CROSSED REB

Hey, c'mere!   Who the hell are you

anyway?!

McGRATH

She's... mine!

McGRATH

I feel like... a ditty!

GORDON/DORA

A ditty? But General...

(trying to be

coquettish again)

... my talents really lay

elsewhere.

McGRATH

Nothing stokes the fire in my

loins like a ditty.

McGRATH

You've got some pretty fair lungs

on ya, girl, now use 'em!

Oh really. One can hardly

notice...

(fiddles with her

belt buckle)

Would you mind...? I... I...

can't seem to release the clasp of

my belt.

McGRATH

Wha... what's this?

GORDON/DORA

It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe

your old swimmin' hole. Getting

sleepy, General?

McGRATH

(ga-ga)

Yes, I'm sleepy.

GORDON

(normal voice)

Good. You're going to be my

little doggy. And when I say

'speak,' you tell me everything I

want to know. Understood?

McGRATH

(barks)

Woof!

GORDON

All right, little doggy. Sit up.

(as he does)

Now tell me who's in the sack next

door. Is it the scientist, Dr.

Escobar? Speak!

McGRATH

Woof!   Woof!

GORDON

Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me

the name of the man you kidnapped

him for...

Looked like you could use some

help.

GORDON

(clears throat to

recover falsetto)

Looks can be deceivin'... dark

stranger. I am perfectly fine.

WEST

I can see that, darlin'. Woman of

You can run along. I'll take care

WEST

Sir, I had him right in my hands

PRESIDENT GRANT

Artemus Gordon.

WEST

You... know him?

PRESIDENT GRANT

Of course I know him, he's the

best marshal I've got! He's a

genius.

(off West's

incredulous look)

Gordon has proven himself time and

again as a very cunning operator

with a rapacious intellect.

Nothing will stop him from

completing a mission for his

President... except the impulsive

actions of a headstrong cowboy!

WEST

Who are you?

PRESIDENT GRANT

I am the President of the United

States!

WEST

Wrong answer.    Who are you?

Sir, in perilous times like these,

I was simply illustrating how

someone impersonating you could

actually walk right into the very

bowels of the White House...

PRESIDENT GRANT

You're clever, Gordon. One day

it'll get you killed.

PRESIDENT GRANT

... And you, West -- not every

situation calls for your patented

approach of shoot first, shoot

later, shoot again -- then when

they're all dead, try to ask a

question or two.

Working together will be good for

both of you.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Ten of our country's best

scientists... all kidnapped in the

last year. By General McGrath, it

now seems.

(turns to them)

The fact is, gentlemen, you've

both been working on the same

case all along. Why did it take

you so long to realize it?

WEST

Well, sir, one of us was still

trying to figure out if he was a

man or a woman.

PRESIDENT GRANT

I don't have time for this

bickering! One week, if we're to

Marzipan, isn't it?

Wait!

WEST

It's McGrath, sir. The South is

rising again. I'm gonna stop it.

GORDON

Sir, West's obsession aside,

McGrath may be a vicious killer,

but a mastermind he is not. So

whom do we seek? After consulting

with Intelligence...

WEST

(cuts him off)

McGrath's headed for New Orleans.

The longer we stand here talkin',

the farther away he gets. I don't

need 'Intelligence' to tell me

that.

States will truly be united.

Someone wants us divided. Now

look, you two are the best I've

is. If you fail, well... we may

never know how great this country

could've been.

GORDON

An armed, Negro cowboy costume,

how creative. In a room full of

white Southerners, you oughtta

fit right in. You might even win

ancestors used drums to

communicate between villages. I'm

sure y'all can see that this young

girl here can communicate all the

redneck comment. I'm getting the

pot-bellied rednecks just like

y'all here.

That slavery thing, I don't see

what the big deal was. Hell, who

you going to get your big, fat,

lazy ass out of bed every morning

I don't think so.

McGRATH

Loveless, I demand you give the

order to stop this slaughter now!

LOVELESS

(ignores him)

... We're going to need more

loading drills! I'm hearing too

much time between screams.

McGRATH

For the last time, give them the

order to desist!

LOVELESS

General, I understand your

distress. But believe me, those

men are not dying senselessly. It

is for a far greater cause than

you can imagine.

LOVELESS

Bloodbath McGrath indeed.

LOVELESS

Well, that concludes the

festivities. Ladies, feed him to

the crabs.

LOVELESS

But, my friends, that tank is just

a little ol' toy compared to what

this country's greatest scientists

are cooking up for me next. So if

I've piqued your interest, bring

1000 kilograms of your country's

gold to Spider Canyon four days

from now.

(starts to roll

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got

LOVELESS

If you don't want to miss the

from the way these corpses are

positioned, laid down a 360-degree

pattern of cannon fire... then

disappeared in moments.

scratches his chin)

My God, what kind of weapon is it?

RITA

Excuse me, I think I'm going to be

sick.

WEST

It just rolls on and on. Makes a

screeching sound -- like a wounded

animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with

a cannon... swivels 'round like an

eagle's head.

GORDON

You saw it?

WEST

Heard about it. Thought it was

crazy survivors' stories.

GORDON

What survivors? There aren't any

here.

WEST

New Liberty, Illinois -- the free

slave town just over the border.

Just one week before the War ended

in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry

that discovered it. Old men,

Little wheels fit on the inside of the track. Once

MACHINE ROARS over him. At the last second, he lassos

the rope around the rear axle. It slows him for a

beat... then stretches. He's gotten Gordon's trick rope.

We see his silent scream -- "Artemus!" He slides way

behind the tank/train, then springs back... past the

tank/train. Finally, West slides back underneath and

manages to grab hold of their caboose. He swings his

legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.

through the door, past their heads... and into the parlor

wall.

steel chain it's attached to draws tight...

114   EXT. LOVELESS'S TRAIN - ROOF - MOVING - DAY                   114

West and Hudson roll around precariously. West claws

desperately at the garrote. It looks grim for our hero

until he knocks his boot heels together. CLICK... his

STILETTO BLADE appears.

Summoning his last ounce of strength, he mule-kicks...

sinking the blade into Hudson's leg. West grabs him and

shoves him head first into the smokestack. The big

Indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle.

before the compartment begins filling with smoke.

Choking clouds that send Loveless et al into coughing

Just in time, Amazonia swings it shut as the unvented

BOILER EXPLODES, sending a FIREBALL ripping through the

Gordon and Rita are thrown across the car, along with

everything else inside, as Loveless's train's sudden

stop... jerks them with it. The SCREECH of STEEL WHEELS

SCRAPING on IRON RAILS is sickening. They clutch onto

one another... as the Wanderer skids to a stop.

As they pick themselves up, Gordon looks to Rita who's

shaken up and scared. Now FOOTSTEPS coming up the

stairs.

RITA

I won't let Loveless take me

again! I'd rather be dead!

GORDON

(recalling West's

words)

That's not a good one to wish for.

To defend herself, Rita grabs one of the sleeping-gas

pool balls rolling around on the ground. Gordon leads

her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his

hand.

RITA

It's a trick, I know Loveless.

CLICK, she pushes the number.     Gordon makes a grab for

it.

GORDON

Rita, no!   It's just...

CLUNK... she drops it to the floor.

ANGLE - WEST

standing in the doorway. He rubs a raw welt on his neck

from the garrote, smirks when he sees Gordon on the bed

with Rita. But his smirk drops when he sees the pool

ball roll between his feet -- spewing a purple cloud of

sleeping gas.

West gives Gordon a Wile E. Coyote look, croaks...

WEST

Too damn late, is what it is.

118   EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY                                              118

A sea of corn tassels waving in the wind. Loveless's

destroyed train is in the b.g. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to

find...

ANGLE ON WEST AND GORDON

lying on the ground with their BACKS TO us. They stir.

West props himself up, looks over at Gordon, who has just

regained consciousness.

WEST

(mimicking him)

An innocent billiard ball this

way, but depress the number and on

impact... a sleeping-gas bomb.

West shakes his head disparagingly and stands. He feels

the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch

wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle.

West is about to step over it. Gordon grabs his leg.

GORDON

Don't move!

119   EXT. WANDERER - BACK PLATFORM - DAY                            119

Loveless is sitting in his wheelchair, fifty yards from

West and Gordon. On Loveless's elbow sits Miss

Lippenreider. She looks through binoculars and lip reads

West and Gordon.

LOVELESS

Continue, Miss Lippenreider...

MISS LIPPENREIDER

(doing both voices

in a monotone)

West. Let go of my leg! Gordon.

Listen to me. Loveless collared

us with the same metal device we

found on Morton.

Loveless turns to Munitia, who is loading two 36-inch-

diameter metal discs into what looks like a CD

changer/clay-pigeon-thrower.

LOVELESS

Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not

going to leave evidence behind

like we did last time.

MUNITIA

Nitro this time, sire.

As she arms the device, and a red light comes on...

LOVELESS

(through megaphone)

Good morning, gentlemen! I trust

you slept well.

120   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - DAY                               120

West and Gordon squint through the corn, see Loveless on

their train.

GORDON

What have you done with Rita?

(CONTINUED)

120   CONTINUED:                                                      120

LOVELESS

Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita

is sleeping off the after-effects

in the stateroom.

(looks toward bedroom)

Quite lovely, isn't she? Who

knows... I might even become

'familiar' with her myself.

Gordon takes a step.    West stops him.

WEST

And that would become one more

reason why I'm going to kill you.

LOVELESS

Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well-

endowed blackamoor like yourself

must find it absolutely

impossible... that a freak like me

could fully enjoy the pleasure of

a woman. But having witnessed my

use of mechinology so far...

wouldn't you think I could provide

myself with something for the

lower half of my body that was

hard-pumping and indefatigably

steely?

Loveless looks O.S.

LOVELESS

... And speaking of 'hard

pumping...' Mr. Coleman, full

steam ahead!

121   EXT. WANDERER - ENGINE ROOM - COLEMAN - DAY                     121

In the engine room.    Amazonia has a gun to his head.

122   EXT. WANDERER (STARTING TO MOVE) - DAY                          122

Loveless takes his last shot at them from the back.

gentlemen?

LOVELESS (CONT'D)

Other than a lack of wheelchair

access, I find it a most

comfortable way to pass the long

miles from here to my laboratory

in Spider Canyon...

(louder, as they

move off)

I'll be seeing President Grant

soon at Promontory Point. What

shall I tell him for you? I'm

afraid it can't be that you're

alive and well...

And as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air...

123   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - GORDON AND WEST - DAY             123

frustrated, as the train pulls away from them.    West tugs

at the metal collar around his neck.

WEST

Gordon, get out your little tool

kit and get this damn thing off of

me!

Gordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool

kit... empty except for a note. Gordon opens it and

reads.

GORDON

'Gentlemen, welcome to the

Loveless Experimental Camp for

Political Dissidents. There are

no guards. No barbed wire. As

long as you stay within the

designated perimeter, you will

stay alive.'

124   EXT. CORNFIELD - WANDERER - MOVING - BACK PLATFORM - DAY       124

Miss Lippenreider is still eavesdropping for Loveless,

through binos.

MISS LIPPENREIDER

West. How do you know it's not

just bullshit? Gordon. Step over

the fence and find out. Rita and

I will put flowers on your grave

every year.

76.

125   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - WEST - DAY                        125

stands next to the little fence, watching Loveless

escape.

WEST

I don't have time for this.

GORDON

Wait, I have an auxiliary tool

kit!

Gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. But

it's too late. West has jumped over the fence. Then he

hops back inside it. He holds his hands out to Gordon.

WEST

See?     Nothing happened.

West grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him

over the fence. Now they hear a slight BUZZING in the

air and it's not a bee.

NEW ANGLE - DISC

comes whipping over the corn straight for West's head.

In a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of

the corn off and banks around for a new attack.

GORDON

Oh, really...?

Now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start

running like hell through the cornfield.

WEST

Is it too late to take it off of

me now?

126   EXT. CORNFIELD - DISC LAUNCHER - DAY                           126

The second disc machine light turns green and the second

disc is launched.

127   EXT. CORNFIELD - WANDERER BACK PLATFORM - MOVING - DAY         127

Loveless is laughing his head off. Certain of Gordon's

and West's impending death, he rolls his wheelchair

inside.

and tries to control her sense of dread and loathing.

She smiles nervously at Loveless, who's being fawned-over

by his women.

MUNITIA

Caviar...?

LIPPENREIDER

Blini...?

LOVELESS

(opening champagne

bottle)

Rita, my dear, not that I'm

ungrateful to Providence for

bringing you back to me...

Rita jumps as the champagne CORK POPS.

LOVELESS

... I'm just a wee bit curious as

to how you managed to wind up with

them.

RITA

(scrambling)

Well, they uh... seemed so... sure

that they could find you... and I

thought if I stayed with them...

they'd lead me back to... all my

friends...

Munitia shoots a look at Lippenreider.

RITA

And not to give you a big head

but...

(wrinkles her nose

to Loveless)

I kinda missed you.

LOVELESS

(not buying it)

Isn't that a coincidence?    I miss

me, too.

128    EXT. CORNFIELD - WEST AND GORDON - DAY                        128

The discs, like giant razors, are mowing off the tops of

the corn stalks, heading straight for their heads!

West and Gordon dive to the ground... the discs just

missing them. West stands to run again. We see the back

of his head's been buzzed.

129   EXT. CORNFIELD - AERIAL SHOT - WEST AND GORDON - DAY              129

running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield.

West sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them.

GORDON

Head for that gully!

West zigs out of the cornfield one way. Gordon zags out

the other. They're both beat-up and exhausted from

running and flopping on the ground.

131   EXT. RIVER CANYON - GORDON'S POV - DAY                            131

It's no gully. It's a canyon that drops 100 feet down

to a ribbon of brown water. And that's not the worst of

it...

132   EXT. RIVER CANYON NEAR CORNFIELD - DAY                            132

West is on the other side of the precipice.       They're

separated by about 15 feet of air.

They both see the discs closing in.       Think fast.

WEST

When I give the signal.   Jump off

the cliff into my arms.

GORDON

Are you crazy?! Do you see what's

down there?

WEST

(watching the discs

approach)

Five, four, three, two...

West holds out his arms.

133   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                                  133

Loveless raises his glass to Rita, makes a little kissing

West and Gordon, caked in mud, are coming up a ridge,

below which is a stream.

WEST

All right, Gordon, what's your

plan? How are you gonna get this

damn thing off my neck?

Gordon turns to West, simmering, controlling himself.

GORDON

Excuse me?

WEST

Isn't that why you're here?

'Cause you're the master of,

you know, mechanical stuff?

GORDON

(smiles)

Oh. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master

of... 'mechanical stuff.' As opposed

to five minutes ago, when I was trying

to collect my thoughts and figure

out a way to get us out of these

contraptions! But no!

Gordon starts moving towards West, who is forced to back

up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the

movie.

GORDON

-- That wouldn't have been any

fun for a certain somebody, and I

won't mention any names -- Jim

West! -- who decided to take me on

a bracing romp through a cornfield

and play a fanciful game of hide

and seek with serrated, spinning

death discs, while our only mode

of transportation is in the hands

of a sadistic madman with weapons

of mass destruction, who kidnapped

Rita, and is on his way to kill

Let's bash it with a rock!

WEST

Gordon, you don't want to do that.

GORDON

Oh, but I do.

Gordon grabs a rock and smashes West's collar.

Suddenly --

ZIIIINNG! West's collar emits a LOW HUM. Suddenly,

West is thrown into Gordon, their collars locking.

CLANG!

GORDON

(suddenly calm)

That's odd. What did you do?

WEST

I didn't do shit!

GORDON

No, you must've reversed the

polarity of the magnets.

WEST

I did not do shit!

West lifts his leg to Gordon's collar to push him

partner's neck -- is stunned. But before he knows what

even happened, West flips upside down onto his shoulders.

GORDON

Are you all right?

WEST

Oh, I'm peachey. Now help me get

my boot off!

First, Gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his

foot in West's crotch and pulls the boot.

WEST

Ahhhh!

GORDON

Apologies, apologies.

Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot

(attached to Gordon's collar).

Finally, West's foot comes free. But when he sits up

-- THWAP! His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle.

West is face to face with his partner's crotch.

WEST

Do me a favor. When you're

telling this story to your

grandkids, leave this part out.

GORDON

Don't worry.

West starts unbuttoning Gordon's belt.

WEST

Now, when I undo your belt,

I'm going to run as fast as I

can that way, and you run as

fast as you can the other way.

Understand?

GORDON

You're going to run as fast as

you can one way and I'm going to

Ingenious.

The men run in opposite directions. (Gordon's belt on

West's collar, West's boot on Gordon's). They get about

thirty, forty yards. Then --

They're yanked backwards into each other.

SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every

time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is

under water.

WEST

(rolling face up)

Get off me, you steaming pile of

(GURGLE)!

GORDON

(rolling face up)

I'm trying, you son of a (GURGLE)!

WEST

(rolling face upGURGLE)        you!

GORDON

Finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land.

They sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back.

I do not want to spend the rest

of my life looking like a meatball

on a plate.

GORDON

We're going to have to discuss

bathroom etiquette soon. Very

soon.

ANGLE ON TOOL KIT

bobbing in the stream.    Gordon grabs it out of the water.

GORDON

Aha. My auxiliary tool kit.

A prop. I'm an actor. Or was. I

WEST

No. How did you wind up in this

line of work?

GORDON

The pinnacle of my life in the

theater came in a production of

Our American Cousin -- a light

comedy -- at Ford's Theater in

Washington. There was this one

line I had... always got the

biggest laugh in the show. One

night, it drowned out the

Lincoln.

He's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut

Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet,

West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with

the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron

railroad tracks covered by drifting sand.

Well I think our partnership is

That's the Wanderer.

Gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not

And would it be too much to

hope that I'm simply seeing a

World's Fair down there... ?

Yeah, it would. That's Loveless'

Lair.

140   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - POV FROM RIM - DAY                        140

A natural bowl that appears to have been made by a

meteor, is gouged out of the desert floor. In the bowl

are several spectacular Victorian-style buildings made

almost entirely of glass, plus a huge silo. Ant-sized

figures are moving around.

141   OMITTED                                                        141

142   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - DAY                                       142

Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE

as from a jet engine. Loveless appears in the f.g. He's

rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator.

Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes

INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards...

all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect.

West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a

giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full

terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high.

The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns

and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster

passes over their faces...

GORDON

Now that's impressive.

WEST

Nice to see an invention that

actually works.

143   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                  143

Loveless is sitting in a captain's seat 60 feet in the

air. He's surrounded by his adoring crew Amazonia,

Munitia and Lippenreider. He spreads his arms wide,

world at his feet.

86.

144   EXT. SPIDER CANYON RIM - ANGLE - GORDON AND WEST - DAY         144

They watch the Tarantula head toward a narrow opening

between two red-rock outcroppings.

GORDON

(dismissive)

We'll see about that. The fool

doesn't even realize he's trapped.

145   EXT. MESAS NEAR SPIDER CANYON RIM - DAY                        145

Suddenly... a VOLLEY OF CANNON FIRE EXPLODES the

impediment to dust. The Tarantula marches on.

148   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                     148

West is dressing for battle. He straps his six guns

on his hips, flips the pool table over, grabs a coach

gun, tucks that behind his chaps.

He belts on his shotgun shell bandolero. An extra six

gun gets tucked in the belt. Another in his boot.

Pocketfuls of shells. The man's ready for war.

WEST

Gordon, let's ride!

(pause)

You do know how to ride...?

He sticks his head through the door to...

149   INT. WANDERER - LAB CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                        149

Gordon's Nitro-cycle is out.   Gordon fusses with it and

some canvas.

WEST

Yes... I know how to ride a horse.

something primitive.

WEST

How about now? There's a big

spider stompin' towards our

President!

But Gordon won't be hurried. He has a big book out,

studies it, then looks back to his Nitro-cycle.

GORDON

I was just thinking about another

spider. Remember in the desert,

when that little wasp killed the

tarantula...?

West rolls his eyes impatiently.

WEST

Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small

advantage. It could fly.

GORDON

Exactly!

Gordon excitedly shows the book to West. Pictured is an

archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft. West looks at

it in disbelief as Gordon prattles on manically.

GORDON

In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci

invented a flying machine called

the 'Ornithopter.' Though he

never actually flew it...

West's heard enough.    He grabs Gordon, shakes him.

WEST

Artemus! There's no time for

plans or half-cocked inventions!

They don't work. We gotta stick

to what we're each good at!

As West drags Gordon to the wardrobe...

150   EXT. DESERT (UTAH) - DAY                                     150

Two riders galloping TOWARD CAMERA. As they THUNDER

PAST, we see West is in the lead, jaw set. And right

behind him comes... President Grant...?! (It's Artemus

in disguise, of course. And he actually can ride a

horse.)

He's reading an inscription on it.

PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)

May God continue the unity of our

country...

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd present to watch

President Grant knock in the famous spike. Behind him,

two train engines are facing each other. The detectives

scan the crowd for possible trouble.

PRESIDENT GRANT

... as this railroad unites the

two great oceans of this world.

Now he swings back the sledgehammer... but at the top of

his swing...

CLOSE - SPIKE

starts to shake, wiggle, and actually pop out of its

hole. Very curious. As it begins to hop on the ground,

bounced by a RESOUNDING THUMPING...

look across the desert to see...

152   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - LONG SHOT - DAY                       152

The Tarantula in full view. People start screaming

in terror as it appears over a ridge, huge even at

this distance. The metal beast closes the 200-yard

distance in seconds.

The citizens flee. The detectives are not far behind

them. The soldiers take cover and ready their weapons.

Grant stands his ground... even as a huge FOOT CLOMPS

down in front of him, VIBRATING the CAMERA.

153   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                 153

LOVELESS

Well, isn't this a coincidence!

I'm out for a little mornin' ride,

and right in the middle of

Ulysses S. Grant himself!

(leans over edge,

mocking salute)

We've never been properly

introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss

Loveless, formerly with the

Confederate Army.

154   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY (INTERCUT WITH TARANTULA            154

Cool and collected, Grant lights a cigar.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do

for you today?

(to his military aides)

Flank him, left and right.

LOVELESS

I have a humble abode nearby, and

I hope you'll accept my

hospitality. I have a little

proposition to make.

PRESIDENT GRANT

What proposition is that?

LOVELESS

The unconditional and immediate

surrender of the United States of

America to the Loveless Alliance.

PRESIDENT GRANT

I didn't realize we were at war.

Loveless gives the nod to Munitia.

155   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY                                     155

157   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - BEHIND OBLITERATED TRAIN - DAY         157

The crowd who'd taken refuge behind it runs away in

panic. All but one of them. A second President Grant

(Artemus Gordon). He calmly lights a cigar on the

flaming train, strides up to the other Grant, and

shouts up at Loveless.

GORDON/GRANT

In matters of war, the person to

talk to would be me.

If there's anyone more surprised than the President

himself it's...

158   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DAY (INTERCUT WITH PROMONTORY          158

Loveless, squinting down at the two Grants. This new

wrinkle has also attracted the attention of the

Love-lettes and everyone else aboard.

LOVELESS

Now just who are you?

GORDON/GRANT

The President.

(turns to President,

snorts)

He's just an actor hired to stand

in for me on public occasions. A

very bad actor, I must say... a

little puffy and overweight.

As the President eyes him, puffs on his cigar,

Gordon/Grant apes his every move, bigger, mockingly.

PRESIDENT GRANT

(aside)

Gordon, you've got a lot of brass.

Where's West?

GORDON

You know him, sir...

Gordon/Grant shifts his eyes toward...

cowboy starts to climb up toward the belly of the beast...

161   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY                       161

Gordon/Grant turns to an Army officer, standing behind.

GORDON/GRANT

Captain, get this man out of my

sight! And next time get me a

real actor!

As the bewildered captain starts to lead the President

away...

162   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                  162

Loveless has had enough.

LOVELESS

Take them both!!!

Munitia, manning a sort of cannon, takes a bead on

the two Grants. She pulls the trigger...

163   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY                       163

... and a sticky white silk shoots out covering both

Grants with spider web material.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Well, Gordon... was this part of

your plan?

GORDON

I'm by your side, sir.   That's

what's important.

Now Munitia hits a lever and they're hoisted up off the

ground. They only get a couple of feet when... BLAM!

West shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop.

All eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting...

164   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TARANTULA LEG - DAY                    164

West has almost reached the lowest deck. Now all the

firepower of the Tarantula is trained on him.

West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now

a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping

for a twitch, something... But there is none. The ants

march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on

ANGLE ON MAP OF "THE DE-UNITED STATES"

There have been some significant internal changes which

Loveless now describes. The delegation from each country

stumbles in and looks around discouraged.

The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are

empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is

Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.

West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally

he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the

breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt

in disgust.

Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.

LOVELESS

My partner nations insist that we

make this as legal as possible.

Personally, I like the symmetry of

it. After all wasn't it you who

made us sign a surrender at

Appomattox?

Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of

his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Never will I sign that paper,

never will the United States ever

surrender!

LOVELESS

Well, sir, we're at loggerheads

then, aren't we? And I suppose

the threat of death to someone

with your valorous war record,

would mean nothing.

Grant sets his jaw intractably.     He's right about that.

LOVELESS

... so, if you still refuse to

sign this surrender... we'll start

by shooting your man, Gordon.

Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President

back to his seat, pulls Gordon out of his. Rita can't

help her outburst.

RITA

Artemus!

Artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the

circumstances. He whispers to Rita and the President.

GORDON

(tugs at his vest)

Don't worry, I'm wearing the

Impermeable.

Rita turns to Grant. What the hell is that? Gordon has

no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage.

As Munitia aims her rifle... Gordon holds up a finger.

GORDON

If I may have one request... it's

that she aim at my heart... which

has loved this great country so

much!

LOVELESS

(considers for a moment)

Shoot him in the head.

GORDON

Great.

Munitia cocks her rifle, then just as Loveless holds his

hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...

177   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                       177

A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and

illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black CHANTEUSE

who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown

Gals."

CHANTEUSE

(singing)

'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump

and rosy...'

Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and

forgets Gordon's execution instantly. And why not?

She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About

six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon

had in his dressing room.

Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa,

silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those

can-can moves.

CHANTEUSE

(singing)

'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'

She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out

her derriere to the crowd. They stare, mouths agape at

this piece of ass worthy of Othello.

CLOSE - LOVELESS

Intrigued.    Well, maybe more than intrigued.

LOVELESS

A new girl!   What a nice surprise!

He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her.

CHANTEUSE

'Painted cheeks and frilly

corsets.'

(bends over showing

her undergarment)

Touch them...'

Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with

his hand and whap! She slaps him right in the face.

CHANTEUSE

'... And they'll sting like

hornets!'

There's a hush in the crowd. Loveless, a red handprint

on his face, is a little nonplussed. Amazonia moves in

threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh.

LOVELESS

(making her name up

on the spot)

Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to

me?

Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she

probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost

aches" in certain amputated places.

ANGLE - GORDON

waiting to be executed.    Something's not quite kosher

about her for Gordon.

GORDON

(musing to himself)

I have a dress like that.

ANGLE - CHANTEUSE

Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the

stops. Her gestures and dance moves become more

exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.

CHANTEUSE

(singing)

'Hangtown gals are lovely

creatures

Think they'll marry Mormon

preachers.'

She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his

monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it,

steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...

CHANTEUSE

(singing)

'Heads thrown back to show their

features...'

Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their

relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.

Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia

hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs. Coleman looks from

the keys to Ebonia. He just caught on.

Go, Ebonia, go.

Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to

him. Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with

a mixture of amusement and relief. Of course, it's his

"I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.

WEST

(singing)

Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...

GORDON

Not to sound ungrateful, but you're

a little over the top.

WEST

(sings)

Ha... Ha... Ha...

West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck --

hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks

worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks

it up his sleeve...

GORDON

Let me warn you about that

dress...

WEST

Gotta go. Big finish...

(belts it out)

'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'

An immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows

Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles.

Grant looks at the keys.

PRESIDENT GRANT

WEST

(suddenly blinks)

Wait a minute. What the hell

is this?

He stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their

own.

178   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                      178

Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like

bosoms.

Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to

Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of

Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked...

right into Rita.

RITA

Serves you right for staring at

them.

As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless

turns to the rest of his goons.

LOVELESS

Kill him!

(off their confused

looks, points)

Him! Him! The girl!

Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of

July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West

reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of

Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and

rolls it at the guards.

GORDON

Was that the eight ball?

WEST

Mmm-hmm.

Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar.

(CONTINUED)

THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         101.

GORDON

That one's an incendiary bomb.

KA-BOOOOM! An EXPLOSION rips the place and a Santa Ana-

sized fire starts immediately.

Rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a

bearded SCIENTIST.

WEST/GORDON

Rita!

She unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles.

RITA

(disappearing into

the chaos)

Meet me after the show!

Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as

three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their

torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon

and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks.

Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.

COLEMAN

Special Marshal... President

thought you needed some lookin'

after.

Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's

RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE

himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from

behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his

chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder

and carries him away.

179   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - BEHIND STAGE -            179

DUSK

As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to

retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women,

who carry the unconscious President Grant, Loveless heads

through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the

door closed, the foreign dignitaries BANG on the door

begging for admittance.

(CONTINUED)

102.

179    CONTINUED:                                                      179

FRENCH MINISTER

Monsieur, we are your partners!

You can't let us die in this

fire!!

LOVELESS

It's not the first time y'all have

been burned in America.

He chuckles, nods to Amazonia, who SLAMS the DOOR closed.

180    EXT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - WEST, GORDON AND          180

COLEMAN - DUSK

emerge from the smoking lair, coughing and gasping for

breath. They watch helplessly as...

181    EXT. AMPHITHEATER - TARANTULA - DUSK                            181

CLAMBERS out of the bowl -- with Grant captive on the

bridge.

COLEMAN

This is diabolical! They've got

the President and I've still got

that silly song in my head!

GORDON

(freaking out)

C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride

horse! Something!

West is watching the Tarantula, turns to calm him.

WEST

No, Arte.   Right now, we need

a plan.

Gordon tries to compose himself.

WEST

That flyin' machine idea of

yours... were you just acting like

you knew what you were talking

about... or could you build it?

182    OMITTED                                                         182

103.

184   EXT. NEAR SPIDER CANYON - WANDERER - STOPPED - DUSK             184

PANNING an expanse of canvas comprising a 20-foot wing

span. In the b.g., we hear Gordon SCRIBBLING.

GORDON (O.S.)

Now Bernoulli's Principle states

that the air flowing over a bird's

wings... is moving at a lower

pressure than the pressure below

the wing... that's called 'lift.'

Course, it's just a theory... it's

never been tested.

NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING

It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows

indicating airflow. Circular lines indicating "life."

Only one problem, it's upside down. Gordon remedies

that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing

a leather flight jacket and goggles.

WEST

You're not makin' me feel any

better.

Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is

connected to the Nitro-cycle.

Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his

mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and

Gordon's design. They look like Flash Gordon's

spaceship. He passes them out.

COLEMAN

Here's a coupla bon voyage

presents.

GORDON

Coleman! Must you smoke when

handling explosives!

Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of

the Nitro-cycle. West looks at Coleman apologetically as

he stuffs the bombs into his jacket.

WEST

He's just a little nervous 'cause

no one's ever flown before.

West is barely on the back when Gordon kicks it over and

they BLAST OUT OF FRAME.

104.

185   EXT. DESERT AND CLIFF - NITRO-CYCLE - DUSK                     185

builds ground speed. Gordon is nervous at the wheel.

West gives him an encouraging pat.

WEST

Avant...! Avant!!!

But their speed is not enough to get them airborne.

GORDON

We're not getting enough lift!

We need more speed!

Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon, he turns the

machine around and heads for the cliff.

WEST

Hey, uh... that's the cliff over

there, you know?

He guns the accelerator.

GORDON

Yes, I do know.

And with that, the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff! It

disappears for the count of five. Then suddenly it

swoops up and PAST CAMERA. They're flying!

186   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP - IN FLIGHT - DUSK                      186

GORDON

(amazed)

It worked...? It worked!!

WEST

(looking down)

If you had to get one right, I'm

real glad it was this one.

GORDON

(exhilarated, with

West-like abandon)

Yeee-haaa!

And with that, they bank the Desert Wasp around and fly

off to save the Republic.

187   EXT. SILVERADO - TARANTULA - DUSK                              187

is entering the town.

105.

188   EXT. BRIDGE - TARANTULA - DUSK                                  188

Loveless turns to Grant, his face beaten and bruised.

LOVELESS

Mr. President, I'll ask you once

again. Sign the surrender or I

decimate this town!

PRESIDENT GRANT

You've had my answer.

Loveless's face darkens as Amazonia hands him a tray of

cotton balls.

LOVELESS

(as he puts in earplugs)

I find the sound of people

screaming while they get blown to

smithereens, ruins the ear for

music. Don't you?

He offers them to the President.    Grant swats them away.

LOVELESS

Commence firing!

And with that the Tarantula OPENS FIRE on the town.

There's a lot of stomping and smashing, too.

189   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK                       189

high above the Tarantula. Gordon, lost in the joy of

flight, turns to West who is more of a white-knuckler.

GORDON

I think I'll call it...

WEST

Lemme guess... an Elevation Enhancer?

GORDON

(why would you

call it that?)

No, Air... Gordon.

Now West points to the Tarantula and chaos below.

WEST

Go down, down there!

(CONTINUED)

106.

189   CONTINUED:                                                      189

GORDON

(as if to a child)

You can't just 'go down there.'

Flight depends on lift, which must

be calibrated to the angle of

descent...

WEST

Shut up and go down there, will

ya?

West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward.

As the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the Tarantula

and Gordon strains to keep control...

190   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  190

Loveless and Grant are oblivious to our heroes above.    He

unlocks one of Grant's handcuffs, presents him with a

pen.

LOVELESS

Well, Mr. President. Have you had

enough yet? Would you like to

sign the surrender or shall we set

a course for Denver? Wichita?

Washington, perhaps?

Suddenly there's a LOUD WHOOOSH and...

191   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          191

DUSK

West and Gordon swooping down low. West unfastens

BOMBS from his vest, waits for the right moment. As

they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them.

BOOM! BOOM! The big gun falls limp.

192   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  192

The dumbfounded Tarantula crew, which has been whittled

down to Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia. They

never counted on having to shoot something in the air,

and can't raise their weapons any higher than 90 degrees.

193   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          193

DUSK

West and Gordon banking around for another sortie.

107.

194   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  194

Loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos,

shocked. WARNING HORNS are GOING OFF.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Well, I'll be damned... it's West

and Gordon... flying!

Grant chuckles at the dauntless pair's pluck.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Keep that surrender handy. I

think you're going to need it!

LOVELESS

Don't be too sure...

Loveless thinks for a moment, pushes Grant out of the

way, and rolls over to the controls. He pushes a lever

and the Tarantula bends down on its knees. He barks to

Munitia.

LOVELESS

I'm through with diplomacy... Take

him away and kill him!

195   EXT. DESERT - TARANTULA - DUSK                                  195

On its front knees...

196   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  196

Now its rear end is tilted up in the air giving

Amazonia at the Gatling gun a shot at...

197   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          197

DUSK

The BULLETS PERFORATE the Desert's Wasp's wings and BLAST

through its STRUTS. They're going down!

WEST

What does your boy da Vinci say

about puttin' this bird down?

GORDON

I don't think he thought it would

ever work, so he didn't get that

far. I'm open to suggestions.

(CONTINUED)

108.

197   CONTINUED:                                                      197

WEST

Take out as many bad guys out as

you can.

Gordon aims wasp at the Tarantula kamikaze-like just

as...

198   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - MUNITIA - DUSK                    198

Munitia cocks back the hammer of her pistol and aims

it at the President... The WASP CRASHES into her.

The SHOT GOES OFF wildly and Munitia falls off the

deck, to her death.

As Grant and the wasp hang over the edge...

199   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  199

Loveless at the controls.

LOVELESS

Munitia!   Munitia!!!

200   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - DUSK                              200

West and Gordon, bruised but alive, climb off the wasp

and onto the lower deck. They pick up the President

and dust him off.

GORDON

Sorry about that, sir. Nose up,

flaps down. Have to remember that

next time.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Son, never apologize for saving a

President's life.

As Gordon realizes that he's finally made amends for that

night long ago in Ford's Theater...

AMAZONIA (O.S.)

Soon you all can fly again. This

time with little angel wings.

West, Gordon and Grant turn to see Amazonia and

Lippenreider with the drop on them.

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             109.

201   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  201

West, Gordon, and Grant are now under Loveless's control.

LOVELESS

Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by

your effort and ingenuity. Why

not swear an oath of loyalty to

me... and forego your executions.

WEST

Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd

rather see what happens when I

stuff your ass into that cannon

up there and fertilize the

landscape.

GORDON

Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no'

would suffice...

Loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens

up beneath West. He goes crashing down a story.

Loveless sics Amazonia on Gordon and Grant and proceeds

down the ramp to the level below.

LOVELESS

Lippenreider, take over the

controls.

(looks down at West)

We may not have a woodshed on

board, but that boy is gonna get a

whoopin' anyway!

202   INT. BELLY OF THE BEAST - DAY                                   202

West plunges down into the metal chamber. Oiled pistons,

thrusting. Steam, billowing. Struggles to his feet.

There, out of the shadows, steps...

KNIFE GUY

He's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they

used to be. They lock eyes.

WEST

So, I guess you're the one who's

gonna give me my whoopin'.

They square off. A beat. Then, a long steely blade

shoots out from where his left hand used to be.

(CONTINUED)

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             109A.

WEST

Pfft.   I got one a' those.

West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in

his boot. Knife Guy responds by producing another

blade from his other cuff.

WEST

But you've got two of those.

(beat)

Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll

see if he can...

No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of

moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding

speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of

his stiletto and boot.

And the fight begins...

Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of

the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes

up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades

and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.

WEST

Damn.

West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks

fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but

misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.

West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands

a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...

WRENCH GUY

just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head.

West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across

the room, lands flat on his back. Now...

SHOVEL GUY

makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's

groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and

backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in

-- it does a moderate amount of damage.

Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's

head. West escapes it, barely...

Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West

catches his foot, holds on for dear life.

(CONTINUED)

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             109B.

Wrench Guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. He swings

on West, but West blocks it with Knife Guy's leg... OUCH!

West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF

FRAME.

West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck...

Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects

squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and

throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a

set of jewels.

West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left

hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.

Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed!

He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and

West flies backward toward a...

HANGING CHAIN

which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip,

then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum,

and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off

their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.

West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to

block the blades which are flying at him, left and right.

Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of

the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears...

the blade snaps.

WEST

No more Mister Knife guy!

West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife

Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow

up...

ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT

to replace the broken one.    It stops about a half-an-inch

from West's nose.

A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain

around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.

West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by

his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a

track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into

the abyss, chain and all.

Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West

grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession...

Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the

action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing-

ing wrench... sparks fly.

West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks

Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to

land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.

Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again.

West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with

him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting

West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but

hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!

West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure,

whacks him in the back.

Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel

and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes

down...

West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel

and he goes down...

Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at

his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks

the deadly blow at the last second.

West has now found his rhythm...

He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the

foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head --

BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling

Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the

space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!

West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat

little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West

backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...

Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...

He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan-

kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.

SHOVEL GUY

I learned that from a Chinaman.

West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which

flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one

right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon.

WEST

I just made that up.

Shovel Guy reels back and tumbles over the railing,

through the hole and he's gone...

WEST

Don't forget your shovel!

West casts the shovel out into the abyss.

WEST

(upward)

Is that all you got for me,

Loveless?!

West, exhausted, turns and sees...

METAL HEAD

all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal

plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West

soaks him in, sighs.

WEST

Uh, I just threw my shovel out.

So this really isn't fair. If

you don't mind, I'd like to...

West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin-

ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one

really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't

fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to

the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!!

WEST

(incredulous)

Noooo.

Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West

up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West

tumbles, and lands right next to...

WRENCH

He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body

... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG!

Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not

so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING!

PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head...

PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been

backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling

over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the

rocky cliff.

WEST

Sorry.

Metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward

West, slowly but menacingly... West braces himself.

METAL HEAD

Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!!

West side-steps and Metal Head falls face first into

the open air.

WEST

You guys just don't get out

CUT TO:

202A   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              202A

West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over

him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead

strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp

jamming the wheels.

A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's

frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.

WEST

When you get right down to it,

Loveless, you just can't beat

a good pair of legs.

LOVELESS

(thin smile)

You're obviously not a poker

player, Mr. West...

Loveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS

ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath

the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten.

LOVELESS

Two pair always beats a pair.

West stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his

sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight.

LOVELESS

Now... Was it someone particularly

close to you who perished in that

military action?

West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that

makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair.

Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve.

Loveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash

of an alloy leg. It's a rib cracker that sends West

sprawling.

LOVELESS

A mother, perhaps? A father?

CLOSE - WEST'S HAND

He's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot

stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch.

As West screams in pain...

203    EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                203

Gordon tries to come to West's aid, but Amazonia points

a gun barrel at his temple. Gordon can only watch

helplessly as...

204    INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                            204

Loveless begins a metallic-flamenco, hands on his hips,

his piston-like legs kicking West's body and head.

LOVELESS

It feels so good to stretch my

legs.

(CONTINUED)

111.

204   CONTINUED:                                                      204

West can't take much more of this, he's about to pass

out. Loveless lowers his alloy foot over West's head and

begins to crush it like a grape.

LOVELESS

I likes to beat my feet on the

Mississippi mud!

205   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  205

Gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries

to hold off the metal foot. But he's slowly losing.

Gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out

beseechingly. When he does, the derringer comes snapping

out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his

pen.

GORDON

Stop this violence!

Gordon blinks at the gun. So do Lippenreider and

Amazonia. Grant knows what to say, if Gordon doesn't.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Drop 'em.

They obey, chucking their guns overboard.

206   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              206

West's eyes are popping out of his head, the mechanical

pressure of Loveless's leg.

GORDON (O.S.)

Stop or I'll shoot!

If possible, West's eyes pop even further.     Gordon shoot?

NEW ANGLE - LOVELESS

looks up to see Gordon holding the derringer on him from

up above.

LOVELESS

You expect to kill me with that

little pea shooter?

GORDON

If I have to.    Yes.

LOVELESS

Why is it, that I'm unafraid?

(chuckles)

I believe you gentlemen are the

polar opposites of a moral

dilemma and I'm stuck in the

middle. On one end, we have

Mr. West, a man of primitive

vigours uncomplicated by

intellect. And on the other,

there's Mr. Gordon. A man of

ideas, but unlike myself, lacks

the passion to kill for them.

He'd like to be able to act his

way out of it. And for some

reason when he's actin', someone

always seems to get killed.

Loveless puts more pressure on West's head, he groans.

Gordon aims.

WEST

(gasps)

Shoot him, Gordon...!

LOVELESS

I'm right about you, aren't I,

Gordon? And that's why I'm

gonna kill your friend here.

Then I'm going to kill you.

POP! The SHOT startles Loveless, West and even Gordon.

But when Loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.

LOVELESS

After all that, you missed.

GORDON

Not exactly.

He gestures down Loveless's legs to a punctured metal

tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over

the deck -- rendering the foot on West's head, powerless.

West gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain

circulation.

WEST

Better than a fountain pen, don't

you think.

(nods behind Gordon)

By the way, your chivalry's about

to be tested.

Gordon turns to see...

ANGLE - AMAZONIA AND LIPPENREIDER

Charging him. They smash into him, driving him to the

rail. As they pummel him, trying to throw him over,

Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. He

retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would

make West proud. Over the rail, goes Lippenreider. In

that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths

"bye-bye."

Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs

him from behind. Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it

surprises them both. Over the railing she goes! As

Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the

kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.

PRESIDENT GRANT

(to Gordon, impressed)

We'll be joining them in a moment

if you can't stop that thing!

207   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  207

Gordon turns to see Grant gesturing at the horizon. His

eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling

comes to a sudden halt at a 1000 foot cliff.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Let's see how clever you really

are...

Gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that.

Meanwhile...

208   OMITTED                                                         208

209   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              209

West approaches Loveless.    There's going to be some

payback.

WEST

For almost four long years I've

been trackin' the animal

responsible for the Massacre at

New Liberty. And I hear that's you...

But with the hydraulic fluid, the fight has gone out of

Loveless. His mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes,

and Loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the

Wicked Witch.

Whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the

useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair

that's stuck against the railing.

LOVELESS

Please, West... show a little mercy

to a poor defenseless cripple...

WEST

(imitating his accent)

Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud

this otherwise sunny day with that

poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just

buck up and say to yourself, 'I am

indefatigably hard-pumpin' and

steely!'

Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it.

LOVELESS

After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna

boil you down to axle grease!

WEST

Now that's the ol' doctor I know!

But the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's

shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist.

West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the

I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers

on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM!

The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They

PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is

going to have an effect on something.

210   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DUSK                                   210

Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to

stop the thing. Finally, Gordon throws up his hands.

He doesn't know what else to try when suddenly the

Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack

and tilts forward.

211   EXT. CLIFF - EDGE - DUSK                                       211

The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter-

totters on the brink.

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             114A.

212   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             212

The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free.

Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the

opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of

hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180

degrees.

West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins

under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into

the railing and wedges there.

213   EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DUSK                                         213

The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches

away from toppling over.

214   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             214

The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls

through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking

quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel-

chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His

weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it

hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the

wheel of the chair and hangs there.

LOVELESS

Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

How did we arrive in this dark

situation?

WEST

I don't know.    Guess I'm stumped!

LOVELESS

And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid

of heights. They just give me the

spooks!

WEST

Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless.

With this being the last leg of

our journey and all, you should

soak in the view, you're really

missing something.

LOVELESS

Mister West, I'm gonna cut this

conversation short...

WEST

Good one, Loveless.   I didn't think

of that one.

LOVELESS

(furious)

Mister West!!! I am faced with a

difficult decision here. On one

hand, there is the overwhelming

love that I have for myself, and

on the other, the raw, seething

hatred I have for you! Now, I

could kill you very easily, just

by pulling this lever...

He moves the joystick.    The chair jerks back.

LOVELESS

But, of course, I would die along

with you. I guess the only thing

that I can take comfort in is the

hope that you would hit those

rocks a second before me and I

could enjoy immeasurable bliss

before I vanish.

(moving joystick

back and forth)

What to do, what to do...

West grabs the joystick.

WEST

Allow me to make that decision

easy on you, Loveless. Because

I want to see you dead a hell of

a lot more than I want to live.

LOVELESS

Why is it that I have a sneaking

suspicion, that although you are

as black as the night on the

outside... inside, you are yellow?!

They lock eyes.    A beat.

LOVELESS

You don't have it in you, do you...

boy?!

WEST

You were right. Let's cut this

conversation short!

West yanks the joystick back.

his eyes widen. The wheels spin for a second, finally

catch, and in a flash, Loveless and West free-fall into

space.

LOVELESS

Weeeeeeeeeest!!!!

A beat, then...

ANGLE - CHAIN

which is dangling from the belly of the beast. At

the bottom of the chain is the Knife Guy from the fight

scene. West is hanging on to his ankles, enjoying a

vindictive, belly laugh.

WEST

(downward)

Now that looked like it hurt.

216   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - CLOSE ON GOLDEN SPIKE - DAY            216

It's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. PULL

BACK to reveal that President Grant, his sleeves rolled

up, has delivered the blow.

Hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. The specter of

Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.

Grant turns to West and Gordon.

PRESIDENT GRANT

Gentlemen, I now strongly believe

the United States is going to be

truly united. Not because of this

railroad... but because of you.

Grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this

momentous event. He reaches into his pocket, takes out

two silver shields.

PRESIDENT GRANT

I've signed into law the creation

of an agency whose sole duty is to

protect the President and the

country from lunatics like

Loveless.

their vests)

Welcome to the Secret Service,

Agents No. 1 and No. 2.

The President shakes both their hands.       Gordon resists

looking down.

GORDON

Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...

who's Agent No. 1?

Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.

PRESIDENT GRANT

I don't think that matters very

much, do you? Gordon? Besides,

you'll have plenty of time to

discuss it on your new assignment.

(hands them piece

of paper)

See you back in Washington.

He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.

Gordon looks up, very troubled.

GORDON

But, sir... what about our train?

PRESIDENT GRANT

(over shoulder)

Well, I'm taking it of course.

Hell, you let Loveless blow up

mine.

As they look at one another in dismay...

RITA (O.S.)

Jim... Arte...?

They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of

scientists. She's looking extraordinarily fetching

in a print dress and parasol.

West and Gordon sit up like dogs.

WEST

Rita!   You look great.

GORDON

Ravishing, a vision.

She hugs West, she hugs Gordon.        Who's it gonna be?

RITA

I just wanted to thank you for

everything you've done for me...

before I went back home to Texas.

WEST

Texas? Why're you going back

there? Why don't you come with me

back to Washington?

GORDON

Or better still, come with me to

Washington. I could introduce you

to people I still know in the

theater...

WEST

She's not really an entertainer,

remember?

RITA

(intercedes)

I can't go with either of you.

She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.

RITA

It's not that you both don't have

your attributes.

(to Gordon)

You're so sophisticated and such a

wonderful cook.

(to West)

Jim, you're good with a gun... and

have great legs.

(to both)

And you're both so brave. But...

I'm afraid I haven't been

completely honest with you.

WEST AND GORDON

Uh-oh...

RITA

Professor Escobar's not my father.

He's my husband.

She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for

her. Shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we

thought.

WEST

Rita... why didn't you just tell

us that in the first place?

(CONTINUED)

118.

216   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                   216

RITA

Well, I was going to... but would

you have really brought me along

if I said I was married?

Honestly.

Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.

RITA

I didn't think so.

She turns and starts to walk away.       Stops and smiles.

RITA

At least you still have each

other.

As West and Gordon look at one another...

217   EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - SUNSET                                       217

We gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful John

Ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices.

WEST (O.S.)

You know, Arte...

GORDON (O.S.)

What's that, Jim?

WEST (O.S.)

Maybe Rita's right...

Suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg.

Then another LEG CLOMPS down... and the Tarantula comes

INTO FULL VIEW. As our heroes ride slowly into the

sunset.

WEST

Besides... there's a lot of

other women in the world.

GORDON

That's easy for you to say. She

didn't walk off with your best

dress.

FADE OUT.

THE END
