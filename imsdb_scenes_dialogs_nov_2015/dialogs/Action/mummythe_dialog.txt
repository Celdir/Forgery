"THE MUMMY"

by

Stephen Sommers

THEBES - 2,134 B.C

NARRATOR

Thebes. City of the Living. Crown

jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

NARRATOR

Home of Imhotep, High Priest of

Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

NARRATOR

Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's

Mistress. No other man was allowed

to touch her.

NARRATOR

But for our love, we were willing to

risk life itself.

PHARAOH

What are you doing here?

PHARAOH

WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

PHARAOH

Imhotep?... My priest.

PRIESTS

Pharaoh's bodyguards!

ANCK-SU-NAMUN

You must go. Save yourself. Only you

can resurrect me.

ANCK-SU-NAMUN

My body is no longer his temple!

NARRATOR/IMHOTEP

For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's

body was to be cursed. And it was I,

the High Priest, whose duty it was

to curse it.

IMHOTEP

Her body was mummified, her vital

organs removed and placed in sacred

canopic jars.

IMHOTEP

The Book of The Living contained

sacred incantations that would send

the evil dead on a journey into the

dark underworld.

IMHOTEP

The slaves were killed...

IMHOTEP

...and the soldiers who killed them

were also slain, so that no unholy

person should ever know the exact

location of the burial site.

IMHOTEP

But there was another book, The Book

Of The Dead, which was never to be

opened, never to be read, for it

contained the incantations that could

bring a dead body back to life a

most unholy thing.

HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

IMHOTEP

It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of

the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis,

so that no such sacrilege might ever

disgrace Egypt.

IMHOTEP

But for my love of Anck-su-namun I

was willing to defy the gods.

IMHOTEP

Anck-su-namun's vital organs were

still fresh, so a human sacrifice

would not need be made.

IMHOTEP

Anck-su-namun soul had come back

from the dead! Now all that was

needed, was to return her organs to

their rightful place within her body.

IMHOTEP

My Priests were condemned to be

mummified alive.

IMHOTEP

As for me, I was condemned to endure

the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient

curses. One so horrible, it had never

before been bestowed.

IMHOTEP

By eating the sacred scarabs, I would

be cursed to stay alive forever. And

by eating me, they were cursed just

the same.

IMHOTEP

I was to remain sealed inside my

sarcophagus, the undead for all of

eternity.

IMHOTEP

They would never allow me to be

released. For I would arise a walking

disease, a plague upon mankind, an

unholy flesh-eater, with the strength

of ages, power over the sands, and

the glory of invincibility.

IMHOTEP

And if I could raise my beloved Anck-

su-namun from her place in hell,

together, we would be an unstoppable

infection upon this world. The

Apocalypse. The End.

THE MUMMY

THE SAHARA - 1925

O'CONNELL

I knew this was gonna be a lousy

day.

BENI

Personally, I would like to surrender.

Why can we not just surrender?

O'CONNELL

Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

BENI

Then let's run away. Right now. While

we can still make it.

O'CONNELL

Now gimme your revolver, you'll never

use it anyway.

BENI

Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody

ever does that anymore.

O'CONNELL

Now go find me a big stick.

BENI

In the desert? What for?

O'CONNELL

So I can tie it to your back, you

appear to be without a spine.

O'CONNELL

How'd a guy like you end up in the

Legion anyways?

BENI

I got caught robbing a synagogue.

Lots of good stuff in them holy

places; churches, temples, mosques,

and who's guarding them?

O'CONNELL

Altar boys?

BENI

Exactly! I speak seven languages,

including Hebrew, so my specialty

was synagogues. How about you? Kill

somebody?

O'CONNELL

No, but I'm considering it.

BENI

What then? Robbery? Extortion?

Kidnapping!

O'CONNELL

None of the above, thank you.

BENI

Then what the hell are you doing

here!?

O'CONNELL

I was just looking for a good time.

O'CONNELL

Oh shit. Steady!

O'CONNELL

STEADY!

(to himself)

What the hell am I sayin'?

O'CONNELL

STEADY!!

(to himself)

What the hell am I doin'?

O'CONNELL

FIRE!

O'CONNELL

FIRE!

O'CONNELL

FIRE!

O'CONNELL

Son-of-a-bitch.

O'CONNELL

Hey! Beni! Wait up!

O'CONNELL

What are ya doing?! Wait up!

O'CONNELL

Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU

CLOSE THAT DOOR!

O'CONNELL

I'm gonna get you for this!

CAIRO

EVELYN

Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up

here?

EVELYN

OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!

EVELYN

Oops.

CURATOR

Look at this! Sons of the Messiah!

Give me frogs, flies, locusts,

anything but this! Compared to you,

the other plagues were a joy!

EVELYN

I'm sorry, it was an accident.

CURATOR

When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it

was an accident. You are a

catastrophe! Why do I put up with

you?

EVELYN

You put up with me, because I can

read and write ancient Egyptian,

decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic,

and I'm the only person within a

thousand miles who knows how to

properly code and catalogue this

library.

CURATOR

Who needs smart women? I put up with

you because your mother and father

were our finest patrons, Allah rest

their souls. Now straighten up this

mess!

EVELYN

Hello?

EVELYN

Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

EVELYN

You...! YOU...!

JONATHAN

Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please

call me something original.

EVELYN

Have you no respect for the dead?

JONATHAN

Right now, I only wish to join them.

EVELYN

Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather

than later, before you ruin my career

the way you've ruined yours.

JONATHAN

My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll

have you know, that at this moment

my career is on a high note.

EVELYN

High note? Ha! For five years you've

been scrounging around Egypt, and

what have you to show for it? Nothing.

JONATHAN

Oh yes I do! I have something right

here!

EVELYN

Oh no, not another worthless trinket,

Jonathan, if I bring one more piece

of junk to the Curator to try and

sell for you.

EVELYN

Where did you get this?

JONATHAN

On a dig, down in Thebes.

JONATHAN

My whole life I've never found

anything, Evy. Tell me I've found

something.

EVELYN

Jonathan?

JONATHAN

Yes?

EVELYN

I think you found something.

EVELYN

See the cartouche there, it's the

official royal seal of Seti the First,

I'm sure of it.

CURATOR

Perhaps.

JONATHAN

Two questions. Who the hell is Seti

the First? And was he rich?

EVELYN

He was the last Pharaoh of the Old

Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest

Pharaoh of them all.

JONATHAN

Alright, good, that's good. I like

this fellow, like him very much.

EVELYN

I've already dated it, this map is

almost four thousand years old. And

the hieratics over here...

(Inhales deeply)

It's Hamunaptra.

CURATOR

My dear girl, don't be ridiculous,

we are scholars, not treasure hunters.

Hamunaptra is a myth.

JONATHAN

Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

EVELYN

Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the

early Pharaohs were said to have

hidden the wealth of Egypt.

JONATHAN

Right, right, in a big underground

treasure chamber. Everybody knows

the story. The entire necropolis was

rigged to sink into the sand. On

Pharaoh's command, a flick of the

switch! And the whole place could

disappear beneath the dunes.

EVELYN

All we know is that the city

mysteriously vanished around 2,134

B.C.

CURATOR

As the Americans would say: it's all

fairy tales and hokum.

JONATHAN

You burned it! You burned off the

part with the lost city!

CURATOR

It's for the best, I'm sure. Many

men have wasted their lives in the

foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no

one has ever found it, most have

never returned.

JONATHAN

(devastated)

You killed my map.

CURATOR

I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm

surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to

be so fooled.

EVELYN

You told me you found it on a dig

down in Thebes!

JONATHAN

I was mistaken.

EVELYN

You lied to me!

JONATHAN

I lie to everybody, what makes you

so special?

EVELYN

I'm your sister.

JONATHAN

That just makes you more gullible.

EVELYN

You stole it from a drunk at the

local Casbah?!

JONATHAN

Picked his pocket, actually.

EVELYN

And what is he in prison for?

WARDEN

I did not know, so when I heard you

were coming, I asked him that myself.

EVELYN

And what did he say?

WARDEN

He said... he was just looking for a

good time.

EVELYN

But he's just a filthy criminal?

JONATHAN

(cringing)

Way to go, Evy.

O'CONNELL

So who's the broad?

EVELYN

Broad?!

JONATHAN

She's my sister, actually.

O'CONNELL

Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a

total loss.

WARDEN

I'll be back in a moment.

O'CONNELL

(sarcastic)

I tremble with anticipation.

EVELYN

We uh,... found... your puzzle box,

and we've come to ask you about it.

O'CONNELL

No.

EVELYN

No?

O'CONNELL

No... You came to ask me about

Hamunaptra.

EVELYN

How do you know the box pertains to

Hamunaptra?

O'CONNELL

Because that's where I found it. I

was there.

JONATHAN

How do we know that's not a load of

pig swallow?

O'CONNELL

Hey,... don't I know you?

JONATHAN

Um, well, you see...

EVELYN

You were actually at Hamunaptra?

O'CONNELL

I just decked your brother

EVELYN

Yes, well...

(shrugs)

I know my brother.

O'CONNELL

Yeah, I was there.

EVELYN

You swear?

O'CONNELL

Every damn day.

EVELYN

No, I mean --

O'CONNELL

-- I know what you mean. I was there,

alright. Seti's place. The City Of

The Dead.

EVELYN

What did you find? What did you see?

O'CONNELL

I found sand. I saw death.

EVELYN

Could you tell me how to get there?

The exact location?

O'CONNELL

Want to know?

EVELYN

Yes.

O'CONNELL

Really want to know?

EVELYN

Yes.

O'CONNELL

Then get me the hell outta here.

EVELYN

Where are they taking him?

WARDEN

To be hanged.

WARDEN

Apparently, he had a very good time.

WARDEN

No women allowed.

EVELYN

I am an English woman.

EVELYN

I will give you one hundred pounds

to spare his life.

WARDEN

I would pay one hundred pounds just

to see him hang.

EVELYN

Two hundred pounds.

WARDEN

Proceed!

EVELYN

Three hundred pounds!

HANGMAN

Any last requests, pig?

O'CONNELL

Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

EVELYN

FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

WARDEN

And what else?

EVELYN

NOOO!

WARDEN

His neck did not break! Good! Now we

watch him strangle to death.

EVELYN

He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

WARDEN

You lie.

EVELYN

I would never!

WARDEN

Are you saying this filthy godless

son of a pig knows where to find The

City Of The Dead? Truly?

EVELYN

Yes and if you cut him down, we will

give you ten percent.

WARDEN

Fifty percent.

EVELYN

Twenty.

WARDEN

Forty.

O'CONNELL

Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--

!

EVELYN

Twenty-five percent, and not one

single farthing more.

CURATOR

She must die.

HOOK

She is like all the others. She will

die in the desert.

CURATOR

No! She has seen too much. She knows

too much.

CURATOR

Not only does she have a map, but

she has the key.

HOOK

The key!? She has the lost key!?

CURATOR

Yes. No one has ever had so much,

been so close. We must stop her, or

it will be the end of us all.

HOOK

Then we will kill her, we will kill

her and all those with her.

CURATOR

And burn the map and retrieve the

key.

HOOK

It will be done. But what of the

American expedition? They leave

tomorrow as well.

CURATOR

Forget the bumbling Americans, they

will be like all the others. Without

the map to guide them, how can they

possibly find Hamunaptra?

BENI

It is three days down the Nile, then

two days by camel, sahibs.

DANIELS

For all the money we're paying you,

something better god-damned well be

under that sand.

HENDERSON

"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya

gotta keep sayin, to yourself,

"Hamunaptra."

EVELYN

Do you really think he'll show up?

JONATHAN

Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he

may be a cowboy, but his word is his

word.

EVELYN

Personally, I think he's filthy,

rude and a complete scoundrel. I

don't like him one bit.

O'CONNELL (O.S.)

Anyone I know?

EVELYN

Oh... um,... hello.

JONATHAN

Smashing day for the start of an

adventure, eh, O'Connell?

O'CONNELL

Yeah, sure, smashing.

BURNS

You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

BENI

Along with the scorched bones of my

entire garrison, sahib.

BENI

A thousand pardons, my good sahibs

but there is much work to be done.

EVELYN

Mister O'Connell, can you look me in

the eye, and guarantee me this is

not some sort of flimflam? Because

if it is, I'm warning you --

O'CONNELL

All I can tell you, miss, is that my

Colonel found that map in an ancient

fortress, and the whole damn garrison

believed in it so much, that without

orders, we marched halfway across

Libya and into Egypt to find that

city. Like I told ya, all I saw was

sand. Everybody else was wiped out

by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your

bags.

JONATHAN

Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude,

a complete scoundrel, nothing to

like there at all.

WARDEN

A bright good morning to all.

EVELYN

What are you doing here?

WARDEN

I have come to protect my investment,

thank you very much.

JONATHAN

Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we

could use another good player.

O'CONNELL

I only gamble with my life, never my

money.

DANIELS

Never? What if I were to wager five

hundred dollars says we get to

Hamunaptra before you?

O'CONNELL

Yer on.

BURNS

What makes you so confident, sir?

O'CONNELL

What makes you?

HENDERSON

We got us a man who's actually been

there.

JONATHAN

I say, what a coincidence, why --

JONATHAN

-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal?

I thought I just dealt?

O'CONNELL

Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

EVELYN

The only thing that scares me, Mister

O'Connell, are your manners.

O'CONNELL

Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

EVELYN

If you call that a kiss.

EVELYN

Did I miss something? Are we going

into battle?

O'CONNELL

The last time I was at that place

everybody I was with died.

O'CONNELL

There's something out there, you

know, something under that sand.

EVELYN

Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain

artifact, a book, actually, my brother

thinks there's treasure. What do you

think is out there?

O'CONNELL

Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin

believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,

they call it, "the doorway to hell."

EVELYN

Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to

the underworld", actually.

EVELYN

I don't believe in fairy tales and

hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do

believe that one of the most famous

books in history is buried out there,

The Book Of The Living. It's what

first interested me in Egypt as a

child. It's why I came here, sort of

a life's pursuit.

O'CONNELL

And the fact that they say it's made

out of pure gold, makes no nevermind

to you, right?

EVELYN

You know your history.

O'CONNELL

I know my treasure.

EVELYN

By the way,... why did you kiss me?

O'CONNELL

I was about to be hanged, seemed

like a good idea at the time.

O'CONNELL

What?... Wha'd I say?

BENI

My very good friend! What a surprise.

O'CONNELL

Why if it ain't my little buddy,

Beni. I oughta kill you.

BENI

You never were any good with the

ladies, O'Connell.

O'CONNELL

So you're the one leading the

Americans, I shoulda figured. So

what's the scam? You get 'em out in

the middle of the desert then leave

'em to rot?

BENI

Unfortunately no, these Americans

are smart, they pay me only half

now, half when I get them back to

Cairo, so I must go all the way.

BENI

You never believed in Hamunaptra,

O'Connell. Why are you going back?

The devil himself lives out there.

O'CONNELL

The girl saved my life, figured it

was the least I could do, keep her

out of trouble.

BENI

You always did have more balls than

brains.

O'CONNELL

Let's make us even, shall we?

BENI

Even?

BENI (O.S.)

O'Connell! I am going to kill you

for this!

O'CONNELL

Sounds familiar.

HOOK

Where is the map?

HOOK

And the key? Where is the key?

HOOK

Then I'll find it myself.

O'CONNELL

Friend of yours?

EVELYN

The map! We need the map!

O'CONNELL

Relax! I'm the map!

(taps his forehead)

It's all up here.

EVELYN

Oh that's comforting.

O'CONNELL

C'mon, there's still one more of

those guys around here somewhere.

JONATHAN

EVY!!

JONATHAN

Hey that's mine --

O'CONNELL

Can you swim?

EVELYN

Well of course I can swim, if the

occasion calls for it.

O'CONNELL

Trust me.

O'CONNELL

The occasion calls for it.

JONATHAN

Americans.

JONATHAN

I say! Good show!

JONATHAN

And did I panic?

JONATHAN

I think not.

BENI

Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I

got all the horses!

O'CONNELL

Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on

the wrong side of the river!

JONATHAN

I can't believe the price of these

fleabags.

O'CONNELL

We coulda had 'em for free, all we

had to do was give 'em your sister.

JONATHAN

Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

O'CONNELL

Awfully.

O'CONNELL

Then again...

JONATHAN

Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.

They smell, they bite, they spit.

Disgusting.

O'CONNELL

Yeah, disgusting.

EVELYN

Well I think they're cute.

JONATHAN

And you snore!

WARDEN

I do not snore!

JONATHAN

All night you snored!

WARDEN

I have never snored!

O'CONNELL

We're almost there.

EVELYN

Are you sure?

O'CONNELL

Pretty sure.

JONATHAN

What in bloody hell is this?

WARDEN

Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

BENI

Good morning, my friend!

DANIELS

Well, what the hell we doin'?

BENI

Patience, my good sahib, patience.

HENDERSON

First one to the city, O'Connell!

Five hundred! Cash bucks!

O'CONNELL

Get ready.

EVELYN

For what?

O'CONNELL

We're about to be shown the way.

DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS

HEYA!

DANIELS

SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

JONATHAN

Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't

we be going?

EVELYN

After all, you rode us night and day

to win that bet.

BENI

Fools.

O'CONNELL

Evelyn! Slow down!

O'CONNELL

SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S

A REALLY BIG --

O'CONNELL

Never mind.

O'CONNELL

You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

DANIELS

Where'd all these camels come from?

BENI

They belong to the dead. They will

wait years for their masters to return

before leaving.

JONATHAN

That thing gives me the creeps.

O'CONNELL

Be nice. That thing saved my life.

EVELYN

That "thing" gets me excited.

O'CONNELL

(sarcastic)

The things that get you excited.

EVELYN

According to Bembridge Scholars,

inside the statue of Anubis was a

secret compartment, perhaps containing

The Book Of The Living.

O'CONNELL

What are those mirrors for?

EVELYN

Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

EVELYN

Do you realize, we are standing inside

a room that no one has entered in

over four thousand years.

WARDEN

Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

O'CONNELL

You're welcome to my share of the

spider webs.

JONATHAN

And it stinks to high heaven in here.

EVELYN

Cretins.

O'CONNELL

That is a neat trick.

EVELYN

Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

O'CONNELL

Preparation for what?

EVELYN

For entering the afterlife.

JONATHAN

Mummies, my good son, this is where

they made the mummies.

HENDERSON

Ya scared the bejeezus out of us,

O'Connell.

O'CONNELL

Likewise.

DANIELS

This here is our statue,... friend.

O'CONNELL

Don't see your name on it,... pal.

BENI

Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are

no-so-good.

O'CONNELL

I've had worse.

JONATHAN

Yes, me too.

EVELYN

Let's be nice, children, if we're

going to play together, we must learn

to share.

EVELYN

According to my calculations, we

should be right under the statue.

We'll come up right between his legs.

(she blushes and laughs)

Oh my.

JONATHAN

And when those dirty Yanks go to

sleep --

(looks at O'Connell)

No offense.

O'CONNELL

None taken.

JONATHAN

We'll sneak up and steal that book

right out from under them.

O'CONNELL

And you're sure you can find the

secret compartment?

EVELYN

Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't

already found it.

JONATHAN

I say, what's our smelly little friend

got himself up to?

EGYPTOLOGIST

Seti was no fool.

HENDERSON

Yeah, sure...

HENDERSON

We'll let him open it.

O'CONNELL

Lemme get this straight, they stuck

a sharp, red hot poker up your nose,

cut your brain into small pieces,

then ripped it all out through your

nostrils?

JONATHAN

OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

EVELYN

It's called mummification. You're

dead when they do this

JONATHAN

Still...

O'CONNELL

Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

EVELYN

You two are worse than a couple of

schoolboys.

EGYPTOLOGIST

FENI!

EVELYN

Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks

like a sarcophagus.

O'CONNELL

Why would they bury somebody in the

ceiling?

EVELYN

They didn't, they buried him at the

foot of Anubis. He was either someone

of great importance. Or he did

something very naughty.

JONATHAN

Well?... Who is it?

EVELYN

'He that shall not be named.'

O'CONNELL

There's some sort of lock here. You

say these thing's are made of granite

with a steel interior?

EVELYN

Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

JONATHAN

Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting

out.

O'CONNELL

No kiddin', without a key, it'll

take us a month to crack this thing,

EVELYN

A key! That's it! That's what he was

talking about.

O'CONNELL

Who was talking about what?

EVELYN

The man on the barge. The one with

the hook, he was looking for a key.

JONATHAN

Hey that's mine!

EVELYN

What do you suppose killed him?

JONATHAN

Did you ever see him eat?

O'CONNELL

Seems the Americans had a little

misadventure of their own today,

three of their diggers were killed.

EVELYN

How?

O'CONNELL

Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.

Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

JONATHAN

Maybe this place really is cursed.

EVELYN

You two!

O'CONNELL

You don't believe in curses, huh?

EVELYN

No. I believe if I can see it and I

can touch it, then it's real. That's

what I believe.

O'CONNELL

I believe in being prepared.

O'CONNELL/EVELYN

WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

JONATHAN

Seagrams!

JONATHAN

Well, he may have been a stinky

fellow,... but he had good taste.

O'CONNELL

Stay here!

JONATHAN

Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man

just say -- !

O'CONNELL

Goin' somewhere?

BENI

Just looking for you, O'Connell! I

wanted to be with my friend!

O'CONNELL

C'mon, friend.

BENI

(struggling)

Why do you like to fight so much?

O'CONNELL

'Cause I look good doin, it.

JONATHAN

Let 'em have it, boys!

JONATHAN

I say, bloody good show.

ARDETH RAY

LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE

OR DIE!

O'CONNELL

You alright?

EVELYN

Yes,... fine,... thank you.

DANIELS

See! That proves it! Old Seti's

fortune's gotta be under this sand!

HENDERSON

For them to protect it like this,

you just know there's got to be

treasure down there.

O'CONNELL

These men are a desert people. They

value water, not gold.

EVELYN

Where's Jonathan?

EVELYN

Unlike my brother, sir, I know when

to say no.

O'CONNELL

Unlike your brother, Miss, you I

don't get. You're a whole new brew.

EVELYN

I know, you're wondering, what's a

place like me doing in a girl like

this?

O'CONNELL

Something like that.

EVELYN

Egypt is in my blood. My father was

a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so

much that he married an Egyptian. My

mother! Who was quite an adventurer

herself

O'CONNELL

Okay, I get your father, I get your

mother and I get your brother, but

what are you doing here?

EVELYN

I may not be an explorer, or an

adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or

a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But

I'm proud of what I am.

O'CONNELL

And what is that?

EVELYN

...I am a librarian!

EVELYN

I'm going to kiss you, Mister

O'Connell.

O'CONNELL

No you're not.

EVELYN

I'm not?

O'CONNELL

Not unless you call me Rick.

EVELYN

Why would I do that?

O'CONNELL

Because that's my name.

EVELYN

I can't believe I allowed the two of

you to get me drunk.

JONATHAN

Don't blame me, I don't even remember

being there.

EVELYN

Well neither do I, thank you.

O'CONNELL

You don't?

EVELYN

No... Why?... Should I?

O'CONNELL

Gee, yeah, you told me it was the

best time you ever had.

EGYPTOLOGIST

There is a curse upon this chest.

DANIELS

Curse my ass.

HENDERSON

Yeah, who cares.

EGYPTOLOGIST

In these hallowed grounds, that which

was set forth in ancient times, is

as strong today, as it was then.

HENDERSON

Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

EGYPTOLOGIST

"Death will come on swift wings to

whomever opens this chest".

EGYPTOLOGIST

It says, there is one, the undead,

who if brought back to life, is bound

by sacred law to consummate this

curse.

HENDERSON

Yeah, well, let's just make sure we

don't bring anybody back from the

dead then, huh?

EGYPTOLOGIST

He will kill all who open this

chest,... and assimilate their organs

and fluids.

DANIELS

Assimilate their organs and fluids?

Ya mean eat 'em?

EGYPTOLOGIST

And in so doing he will regenerate.

And no longer be the undead, but a

plague upon this earth.

HENDERSON

Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

EVELYN

Oh my god, I've dreamed about this

ever since I was a little girl.

O'CONNELL

You dream about dead guys?

EVELYN

Look, all the sacred spells have

been chiseled off. The hieratics and

hieroglyphs that protect the deceased

on his journey into the afterlife,

they've been removed. This man was

cursed,... doomed.

O'CONNELL

Tough break.

JONATHAN

Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see

who's inside, shall we?

O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN

AHHHHH!!!

BENI

The curse,... beware the curse!

DANIELS

Stupid superstitious bastard.

O'CONNELL

Is he supposed to look like that?

EVELYN

No. I've never seen a mummy look

like this. He's, he's still...

JONATHAN

Juicy?

EVELYN

Yes. He's more than four thousand

years old and still decomposing.

O'CONNELL

And look at this.

EVELYN

Oh my god, he was buried alive.

EVELYN

And he left a message.

EVELYN

It says: 'Death is only the

beginning.'

O'CONNELL

Where's my gun?

JONATHAN

What are you going to do? Shoot him?

O'CONNELL

If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

EGYPTOLOGIST

I have heard told of this book, but

I never truly believed it existed.

This, good gentlemen, is a most

priceless treasure.

HENDERSON

I wouldn't trade ya for a brass

spittoon!

DANIELS

Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta

pure gold!

JONATHAN

What is this stuff? It smells like

our late friend, the Warden.

JONATHAN

You did not!?... We're not!?

O'CONNELL

Rat gizzards. They smell bad and

taste worse, but that's the best the

desert has to offer.

HENDERSON

Say O'Connell, whadaya think these

honey's'll fetch back home?

BURNS

We hear you gentlemen found yerselves

a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

DANIELS

Ya know if ya dry him out, you can

sell him for firewood.

EVELYN

Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them

inside our friend's coffin. They can

stay alive for years living off the

flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

EVELYN

Famished.

O'CONNELL

Are you saying somebody threw these

things in with our guy, and they

slowly ate him alive?

EVELYN

Very slowly.

JONATHAN

He certainly was not a popular fellow

when they planted him.

O'CONNELL

Must of got a little too frisky with

the Pharaoh's daughter.

EVELYN

According to my readings, our friend

suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of

all ancient Egyptian curses, one

reserved for only the most evil

blasphemers. In all of my research,

I've never read of this curse actually

having been performed.

O'CONNELL

That bad huh?

EVELYN

Yes, they never used it because they

feared it so. It's written, that if

a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever

arise, he would bring with him the

ten plagues of Egypt.

O'CONNELL

The ten plagues?... You mean all ten

plagues.

BENI

Like what that Moses guy did to that

Pharaoh guy?

EVELYN

That's one way of putting it.

JONATHAN

Let's see, there was frogs, flies,

locusts...

BURNS

Hail and fire.

HENDERSON

The sun turning black.

DANIELS

Water turning to blood.

JONATHAN

And my personal favorite: people

covered in boils and sores.

EVELYN

Fried gizzard anyone?

O'CONNELL

You sure you outta be playin, around

with that?

EVELYN

It's just a book, no harm ever came

from a book.

EVELYN

Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

EGYPTOLOGIST

NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

EGYPTOLOGIST

What have we done?

JONATHAN

Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!

Billions of grasshoppers!

O'CONNELL

That's one of the plagues, right?

The grasshopper plague!

EVELYN

This is not a plague. It's

generational. Every so many years

the locusts of Egypt have a population

explosion and they all take flight.

O'CONNELL

Okay,... and what about frogs?

BURNS

Daniels! Henderson!

BURNS

Daniels?... is that you?

BURNS

Henderson?

JONATHAN

EVY!?

EVELYN

Oh thank goodness, you're one of the

Americans, aren't you?

IMHOTEP

Anck-su-namun?

O'CONNELL

Damn-it! Must be a trap door around

here or somethin'.

HENDERSON

RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

EVELYN

Help me,... please,... help me.

IMHOTEP

Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

O'CONNELL

Would you quit playin, around! Let's

get outta here already!

O'CONNELL

WHOA!

IMHOTEP

ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

O'CONNELL

Ahhhhhhhh!!

ARDETH RAY

I told you to leave or die, you

refused, and now you may have killed

us all. For you have unleashed the

creature that we have feared for

more than four thousand years.

O'CONNELL

Relax, I got him.

ARDETH RAY

No mortal weapons can kill this

creature. He is not of this world.

O'CONNELL

Are we talkin, about the same

creature? The walking corpse? Really

big mouth? Really bad breath?

BENI

May the good Lord protect and watch

over me as a shepherd watches over

his flock. And may Satan in all his

forms be vanquished forever.

IMHOTEP

(subtitled)

The language of the slaves.

IMHOTEP

(in Hebrew -- subtitled)

I may have use for you. And the

rewards will be great.

IMHOTEP

Where are the other sacred jars?

DANIELS

You bastards!

HENDERSON

What did you do to him!?

ARDETH RAY

We saved him! Saved him before the

creature could finish his work. Now

leave, all of you, quickly, before

he finishes you all.

JONATHAN

You're not going to kill us?

ARDETH RAY

We must now hunt him down, and try

and find a way to kill him, before

he consumes the earth. Allah be with

us.

O'CONNELL

I told ya, I already got him!

ARDETH RAY

Know this, the creature will be coming

for you. He must consummate the curse.

And until he does, he will never

eat, he will never sleep, and he

will never stop.

IMHOTEP

ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

O'CONNELL

I thought you didn't believe in this

stuff!?

EVELYN

Having an encounter with a four

thousand year old walking-talking

corpse tends to convert one.

O'CONNELL

Forget it, we're out the door down

the hall and gone.

EVELYN

No, we are not.

O'CONNELL

Oh yes we are.

EVELYN

No we are not. We woke him up, and

we must try and stop him.

O'CONNELL

We?! What we?! You didn't read that

book. I told you not to play around

with that thing.

EVELYN

Alright then, Me, I,... I read the

book, I woke him up and I intend to

stop him.

O'CONNELL

How!? You heard the man, no mortal

weapons can kill this guy.

EVELYN

Then we'll have to find some immortal

ones.

O'CONNELL

There goes that belief again. Not

me, I am outta here!

EVELYN

According to that Book, once this

creature has been reborn, his curse

will spread, and as he grows in

strength, so will his curse grow,

infecting the people until the whole

of the earth is destroyed.

O'CONNELL

Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

EVELYN

(incredulous)

It's everybody's problem!

O'CONNELL

Look lady, I appreciate you saving

my life and all, but when I signed

on, I agreed to take you out there

and bring you back, and I did, now

were even, end of job, end of story,

contract terminated.

EVELYN

That's what I am to you? A contract?

O'CONNELL

You can either tag along with me, or

you can stay here and play around

with Mister Maggot.

EVELYN

I'm staying.

O'CONNELL

FINE.

O'CONNELL

Beni ya little stinkweed, where did

you slink off to?

BENI

You left me! You left me in the desert

to rot.

O'CONNELL

Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.

(gestures to Imhotep)

So who's this guy?

BENI

This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest

of Osiris.

O'CONNELL

Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

BENI

The Prince does not like to be touched

by other humans. A Silly eastern

superstition, I'm afraid.

O'CONNELL

Yeah, well, we all got our little

problems today don't we?

BENI

He has come to help Mister Burns.

Somehow I feel responsible.

O'CONNELL

Don't gimme that, you never had any

scruples.

BENI

Do you know where I can steal some?

O'CONNELL

See ya around, Padre.

WINSTON

I'm the last of the Royal Force still

stationed here, you know? All the

other laddies died in the air and

were buried in the sand.

WINSTON

Ever since the end of the Great War,

there hasn't been a single challenge

worthy of a man like me.

O'CONNELL

I've heard it before, Winston.

WINSTON

I just wish I would've chucked it

with the other laddies, gone down in

a flame of glory, instead of sitting

around here, rotting from boredom

and booze!

BURNS

The drawer there, spectacles.

(tries to laugh)

As you see, I won't be needing them.

BENI

Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks

you for your spectacles, -- and for

your eyes,... and for your tongue.

BENI

But I am afraid more is needed, the

Prince says he must finish the job,

consummate the curse which you and

your friends have brought down upon

yourselves.

HENDERSON

Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,...

like...

O'CONNELL

Blood.

JONATHAN

"And the rivers and waters of Egypt

went red and were as blood."

O'CONNELL

He's here.

JONATHAN

Who's here!?

O'CONNELL

The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

O'CONNELL

Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

O'CONNELL

We got problems.

O'CONNELL

He's here! I saw him! That thing is

here!

EVELYN

The creature!? Are you sure!?

O'CONNELL

Pretty sure!

O'CONNELL

We are in serious trouble.

O'CONNELL

Back off, creep.

IMHOTEP

You saved me from the undead. For

this, I shall make you immortal.

HENDERSON

The curse. The curse.

EVELYN

There's only one person I know who

can possibly give us some answers.

EVERYBODY

YOU!

CURATOR

Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

EVELYN

What is he doing here?

CURATOR

Do you truly wish to know? Or would

you prefer to just shoot us?

O'CONNELL

I just saw my fist vanish into some

guy's head.

O'CONNELL

I'm willin, to go on a little faith,

here.

CURATOR

You will not believe it.

O'CONNELL

Try me.

CURATOR

We are part of an ancient secret

society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and

we have a sacred mission, passed

down through thirty-nine generations.

For over four thousand years we have

guarded The City Of The Dead. we are

sworn at manhood to do any and all

in our power to stop the High Priest

Imhotep from being reborn into this

world.

ARDETH RAY

And because of you, we have failed.

EVELYN

(appalled)

And you think this justifies killing

innocent people!?

CURATOR

To have stopped this creature? Yes!

O'CONNELL

Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's

afraid of cats, what's that about?

CURATOR

According to the ancients, cat's are

the guardians at the gates of the

underworld. Imhotep will fear them

until he is fully regenerated, and

then he will fear nothing.

DANIELS

Right! And ya know how he gets fully

regenerated?! By killing everybody

who opened that chest and sucking us

dry! That's how!

CURATOR

Yes, the creature must first try and

regenerate, and then he will attempt

to resurrect the one he has loved

for more than four thousand years.

EVELYN

Anck-su-namun.

EVELYN

In the necropolis, when I saw him, -

alive,... walking, he called me Anck-

su-namun. And then in Mister Burns'

quarters he tried to kiss me.

CURATOR

It is because it was you who read

from the Book. He has chosen you to

be the human sacrifice needed to

regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

JONATHAN

This is not good. Not good at all.

ARDETH RAY

Tonight is the full moon. The moon

of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

JONATHAN

"...and he stretched forth his hands

towards the heavens, and there was

darkness throughout the land of

Egypt."

EVELYN

We must stop him from regenerating.

EVELYN

Who opened that chest?

HENDERSON

Well, there was me and Daniels here

and then poor Burns of course, oh

yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

O'CONNELL

What about my buddy, Beni?

DANIELS

Naw, he scrammed outta there,

EVELYN

We must find the Egyptologist and

bring him back here to the safety of

the fort, before the creature can

get to him.

O'CONNELL

Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you

two come with me.

HENDERSON

The hell with that! I'm not goin'

nowhere! We're safe here.

DANIELS

Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for

nothin'.

EVELYN

Who put you in charge? You can't

just leave me behind like some old

suitcase. I'm the one responsible

for this mess and I intend to be the

one to clean it up.

O'CONNELL

Keep an eye on her. If you leave her

door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,

Jonathan.

JONATHAN

Me?

O'CONNELL (O.S.)

Well, well, well.

O'CONNELL

Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

O'CONNELL

Where's your new friend?

BENI

What friend? You're my only friend.

O'CONNELL

Then you got no excuse for living.

What the hell you doin, being buddies

with this creep, Beni? What's in it

for you?

BENI

It is better to be the right hand of

the Devil,... than in his path. As

long as I serve him, I am immune.

O'CONNELL

Immune from what?

BENI

You shall see.

O'CONNELL

What are you looking for? Lie, and

I'll slit your throat.

BENI

The book! The black book they found

at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back.

Said to me it would be worth it's

weight in diamonds.

O'CONNELL

What does he want the book for?

BENI

(shrugs)

Something about bringing his dead

girly-friend back to life. He needs

the book...

(looks at Jonathan)

And your sister.

JONATHAN

That looked rather painful.

O'CONNELL

(wincing)

Ya know, ever since I met you, my

luck has been for crap.

JONATHAN

Yes, I know, I do that to people.

O'CONNELL

Damn-it! That's two down and only

two to go.

JONATHAN

And then he'll be coming after Evy.

SOLDIER

Ten o'clock! All is well!

DANIELS

The hell with this. I'm goin,

downstairs to get me a drink. You

want somethin'?

HENDERSON

Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a

shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

O'CONNELL

Get your hands off my girl, pal.

O'CONNELL

Nice lips.

O'CONNELL

I figured you might be here, so I

brought a friend.

EVELYN

You called me your girl?

O'CONNELL

What?... Oh yeah, that was just um,

you know, figure a speech.

EVELYN

I think you were jealous

O'CONNELL

Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see

that guy's face?

DANIELS

Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do

somethin'! we gotta do somethin,

NOW! Before it's too late!

EVELYN

Last month I came across an

inscription that mentioned The Book

Of The Dead.

DANIELS

That book we found at Hamunaptra?

EVELYN

Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked

about bringing people back from the

dead. A notion I was unwilling to

believe.

O'CONNELL

Believe it, sister. That's what

brought our buddy back to life.

JONATHAN

And now he's going to use it to bring

his girlfriend back

ARDETH RAY

And if he succeeds, the two of them

together will bring about the

apocalypse.

THE CURATOR

The plagues we have seen so far, are

merely Imhotep flexing his muscles.

Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's

resurrection will he be truly

invincible.

EVELYN

I'm thinking that if the black Book

Of The Dead can bring people back to

life --

CURATOR

-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of

The Living can return them to the

underworld.

EVELYN

Exactly --

O'CONNELL

So your sayin', if we find the book

made outta gold --

CURATOR

-- And read the sacred incantations

contained inside it.

O'CONNELL

You think it'll send this guy back

to hell?

CURATOR

Correct, And that's when --

ARDETH RAY

It has begun. The beginning of the

end.

EVELYN

Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

EVELYN

Got it!

O'CONNELL

Got what?

EVELYN

Since the black Book of The Dead was

found inside the statue of Anubis,

then according to this, the golden

Book of The Living should be inside...

O'CONNELL

What?

JONATHAN

What?

DANIELS

WHAT!?

EVELYN

The golden Book Of The Living, is

inside the statue of Horus.

CURATOR

Which would be located not far to

the east of the Anubis statue.

O'CONNELL

Don't tell me we gotta go back out

there?

CURATOR

If we want to kill the creature,

yes.

JONATHAN

Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

BENI

Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

O'CONNELL

You're gonna get yours, pal!

O'CONNELL

C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

EVELYN

He's gorgeous.

THE CURATOR

He has consummated the curse, now

all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun

from the dead, then it will be the

end of us, and the beginning for

them.

IMHOTEP

Koontash dai na.

BENI

Take his hand and he will spare the

others.

EVELYN

Any bright ideas?

O'CONNELL

Sorry, fresh out.

O'CONNELL

Don't do it, Evelyn.

EVELYN

I have no choice.

IMHOTEP

Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

BENI

Come with me my princess. It is time

to make you mine, forever.

EVELYN

All eternity, idiot.

EVELYN

You better think of something, because

if he turns me into a mummy, you're

the first one I'm coming after.

O'CONNELL

Got guts, lady.

EVELYN

Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep

them.

JONATHAN

Hey that's mine -- !

O'CONNELL

Evelyn!

ARDETH RAY

Be calm. There is still time. We can

stop him yet.

IMHOTEP

Pared oos.

EVELYN

NOOO!!

BENI

Kill them.

O'CONNELL

EVELYN!

CURATOR

Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

O'CONNELL

We gotta get her back.

JONATHAN

I'm with you, old man. No one touches

my sister like that and gets away

with it.

O'CONNELL

You know where he's taking her?

ARDETH RAY

Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the

ritual.

JONATHAN

And what ritual would that be?

ARDETH RAY

The ritual to bring the body of Anck-

su-namun back to life.

JONATHAN

And how does one do that?

ARDETH RAY

By reading the Book Of The Dead.

JONATHAN

Oh yes, of course.

ARDETH RAY

And then killing your sister.

JONATHAN

Excuse me?

ARDETH RAY

Imhotep is now able to cross the

desert with great haste.

JONATHAN

Begging your pardon, but I wasn't

quite clear on that last part.

ARDETH RAY

If he arrives before us, it will be

too late.

JONATHAN

Did you say 'kill' my sister?

O'CONNELL

I know how to beat him to it.

HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

WINSTON

So what's your little problem got to

do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

O'CONNELL

Not a god-damned thing.

WINSTON

Is it dangerous?

O'CONNELL

You probably won't live through it.

WINSTON

By Jove, do you really think so?

JONATHAN

Everybody else we've bumped into has

died, why not you?

WINSTON

So what's the challenge then?

O'CONNELL

To save the damsel in distress, kill

the bad guy and steal his treasure.

WINSTON

Winston Havlock at your service,

sir!

EVELYN

What just happened?

BENI

All I remember is him turning into a

blast of sand,... and then I remember

nothing.

WINSTON

Hang on, men!

WINSTON

We're going down!

WINSTON

Here I come, laddies!

EVELYN

Stop it! You'll kill them!

JONATHAN

Excuse me... A little help would be

useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH

TROUBLE!!

O'CONNELL

Okay, now what the hell does this

Horus guy look like?

JONATHAN

He's a big fellow with pointy ears

and a face like a falcon.

O'CONNELL

Got it.

BENI

Keep moving.

EVELYN

You know, nasty little fellows such

as yourself, always get their

comeuppance.

BENI

Yeah?

EVELYN

Oh yes, always.

JONATHAN

I say, look at that.

JONATHAN

Say, gents! You should come have a

look at this.

O'CONNELL

From now on, don't touch anything.

Not a damn thing. Keep your hands

off the furniture, got it?

BENI

Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

EVELYN

Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but

that it's already taken.

BENI

He wants your heart and your brain,

your liver, your kidneys...

BENI

...and how do you say? Those slimy

things, in your stomach?

EVELYN

Intestines.

BENI

Yeah! Them.

EVELYN

You only want me for my organs?!

O'CONNELL

Who the hell are these guys?

ARDETH RAY

Priests. Imhotep's priests.

O'CONNELL

I never killed a priest before.

ARDETH RAY

They are evil, cursed, they matter

not.

O'CONNELL

Well, okay then.

O'CONNELL

Oh come on, gimme a break here.

IMHOTEP

(ancient Egyptian --

subtitled)

Kill them! Kill them all! And bring

me the Book Of The Living!

ARDETH RAY

My turn.

O'CONNELL

This whole place is comin, alive!

ARDETH RAY

I'm out.

JONATHAN

There he is!

JONATHAN

Hello Horus old boy.

ARDETH RAY

Allow me.

O'CONNELL

These guys just don't quit.

ARDETH RAY

Keep digging!

ARDETH RAY

Save the girl! Kill the creature!

O'CONNELL

That's the last one, we better get

lucky.

IMHOTEP

With your death, my love and I will

be invincible!

JONATHAN

I found it, Evy! I found it

EVELYN

Shut-up and get me off of here!

EVELYN

Open the book, Jonathan! Open the

book! That's the only way to kill

him!

JONATHAN

I can't open it! It's locked or

something!

JONATHAN

We need the key!

JONATHAN

What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

EVELYN

Read the inscription on the cover!

JONATHAN

Keetash-something, naraba-something.

JONATHAN

Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

JONATHAN

Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

JONATHAN

Oh boy.

O'CONNELL

This just keeps gettin, better and

better.

O'CONNELL

Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

JONATHAN

You have got to be joking?

EVELYN

Finish the inscription, idiot!

JONATHAN

Oh.

JONATHAN

Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now

what is this last symbol here?

EVELYN

What's it look like!?

JONATHAN

It's an Anck symbol, with two little

squiggly lines above it, and a bird,

a stork! on either side.

EVELYN

Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

JONATHAN

Yes,... I see.

JONATHAN

Hootash im Ahmenophus!

O'CONNELL

Okay pal, let's see how tough you

are without your right arm.

O'CONNELL

Alright,... so he's left handed.

JONATHAN

I got it!

EVELYN

Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos!

PARED OOS!!

EVELYN

Death is only the beginning.

O'CONNELL

C'mon!

BENI

O'CONNELL!!

BENI

Go away.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

JONATHAN

Well,... I guess we go home empty

handed.

O'CONNELL

Wouldn't say that.

O'CONNELL/JONATHAN

TUK-TUK-TUK!!

THE END
