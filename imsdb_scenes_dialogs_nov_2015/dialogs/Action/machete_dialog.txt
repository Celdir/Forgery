Officer Cruz! Stand down! Do not

attempt to take the safehouse

alone! Officer Cruz! You hear me!?

OFFICER ERHMAN

Torrez sounds mad. You going to

answer him?

OFFICER ERHMAN (CONT'D)

On route to target, no need for

assistance.

TORREZ

(ON RADIO)

Machete, you son of a bitch! I told

you to wait! Set up a perimeter and

wait for further orders. You hear

me, Pendejo!?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 2.

OFFICER ERHMAN

What are you doing? We're going to

set up a perimeter right? You heard

the boss.

MACHETE

This is the boss.

OFFICER ERHMAN

Hijo de puta!

MACHETE

Get dressed.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 3.

CHICA

It's too hot for clothes.

CHICA (CONT'D)

Hey... what's your name?

CHICA

Oh... wow.

MACHETE

We need to go. Now.

CHICA

In what? That?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 4.

CHICA (CONT'D)

That looks like me.

CHICA (CONT'D)

What's this long, hard thing?

MACHETE

My machete.

CHICA

Is it sharp?

CHICA (CONT'D)

Good.

CHICA (CONT'D)

(INTO PHONE)

I got him.

CHICA (CONT'D)

(HANGING UP)

Pobrecito.

GIRL

Como hice? (Sub: How'd I do?)

TORREZ

Bueno... pero no tanto. (Sub:

Good... but not that good.)

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 5.

TORREZ (CONT'D)

You had to stick your neck where it

didn't belong, amigo.

MACHETE

Torrez?

DRUGLORD

No, not Torrez. El Santo Muerte,

pendejo. (I'm Saint Death,

pendejo.)

DRUGLORD (CONT'D)

Quemalo. Quemalo todo. (Sub: Burn

it. Burn it all.)

AND WE

CUT TO BLACK.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 7.

ELEKTRA

Jesus, Sis. How long have you known

this one? Twenty minutes?

NAKED MAN

What the fuck? You're a twin? Hot.

SIS

Mind your own business.

ELEKTRA

I'm trying to. I've got to get

ready for work. And you're in my

room.

NAKED MAN

Whoa, whoa. Why don't you join us?

ELEKTRA

What a charmer. You sure know how

to pick `em, Sis.

SIS

Fuck off.

(TO MAN)

Get out.

NAKED MAN

What?

SIS

You've been kicked off the island.

Get the fuck out.

NAKED MAN

Talk nice. And you--get that robe

off and get up here.

ELEKTRA

Sure thing. I like a man who takes

control.

NAKED MAN

What the fuck?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 8.

ELEKTRA

You're under arrest, dick.

NAKED MAN

You're a cop?

ELEKTRA

Yeah, this is Agent Elektra Rivers,

Homeland Security. I could use some

unis at the corner of Newning and

Drake for an assault. Suspect in

custody.

NAKED MAN

You're fucking hot.

ELEKTRA

(clicking phone shut)

Yeah. Thanks. I gotta get dressed

now.

NAKED MAN

Can I watch?

ELEKTRA

Suit yourself.

Have a nice day, bitch.

You too, slut.

his ties to an extremist militia

organization in the capitol city--

up, Luz? Two potato and egg tacos,

please. And coffee.)

LUZ

Pancho vamanos! Leave him alone.

MOCO

It's OK Luz. You gotta feed your

little man, he's hungry.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 10.

LUZ

He's a fat fuck, don't do nothing

and eats all day, like my last

husband.

MOCO

Orale, you ain't getting married

again with that attitude.

LUZ

Thank god. Why buy the pig when I

can get the chorizo for free?

MOCO

Puta.

LUZ

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 11.

HANDLER

He wants you.

HANDLER (CONT'D)

$500 if you lose. $2000 if you win.

HANDLER (CONT'D)

Hey, you, wetback! You're gonna

kiss off $500 for five minutes?

RICO

A hundred on the new guy!

RICO (CONT'D)

Orale! Come on!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 12.

BRUNO

Hey man, that was some good work

back there. Let me borrow some

money.

BRUNO (CONT'D)

Hand it over.

GANGSTER ONE

Don't make us carve you up farmer.

LUZ

I do the carving around here

pendejos.

BRUNO

(SPANISH)

What the fuck is this? Get back to

the kitchen chica.

LUZ

Come to mami.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 13.

BENZ

You.

BENZ (CONT'D)

Not you, Ragged Dick. Him.

BENZ (CONT'D)

Get in.

BENZ

You speak English?

MACHETE

$70 a day for yardwork. Hundred for

roofing. One-twenty-five for

septic. Sewage.

BENZ

$125?

MACHETE

I cost the most, because I'm the

best there is.

BENZ

Naturally.

BENZ (CONT'D)

You can call me Benz.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 14.

MACHETE

Like the car.

BENZ

You're sharp. That's right. Just

like the car.

MACHETE

What are you looking for, Mr. Benz?

BENZ

Have you ever killed anyone before?

BENZ

Drink?

BENZ (CONT'D)

Like angels pissing down my throat.

BENZ (CONT'D)

Do you know this man?

BENZ (CONT'D)

State Senator John McLaughlin,

Independent from Cocksucker County.

As you know, illegal immigrants

such as yourself are being forced

out of our country at an alarming

rate. If he had his druthers, he'd

ship you back to old Meh-Hee-Co.

That's his platform: Ship `em back.

(MORE)

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 15.

BENZ (CONT'D)

But first, he'd make you build a

wall along the border for no pay.

Not so much as a thank you then get

the fuck out.

BENZ (CONT'D)

What?

MACHETE

That doesn't sound like your

problem.

BENZ

That's where you're wrong, friend.

What our senator fails to realize

is that this country runs on

illegal labor. Thrives on it. Keeps

costs down, keeps the wheels

moving. Bust that, and the world

stops turning. You've chaos and

shit.

MACHETE

What do you want me to do?

BENZ

For the good of both our peoples,

our new senator must die. And for

that I will pay you $150,000 cash.

BENZ

You like the machete, huh? Strictly

low-tech, but good close-up, or if

you're trying to make a

particularly brutal point. But it's

entirely unsuited to our purposes.

Here. Have a look at this.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 16.

BENZ (CONT'D)

(specific dialogue about the

weapon, the laser-sight on it, the

ammo it uses, then) Cheer up,

Charlie. This is your golden

ticket.

LUZ

(SMILING)

You still owe me, amigo. Two tacos

y cafe. What's this?

MACHETE

Collateral.

REPORTER

But isn't this anti-immigration

platform a hard sell in this part

of the country, where so many

voters have strong ethnic

backgrounds?

MCLAUGHLIN

Not at all. Those voters are here

legally.

(MORE)

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 17.

MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)

It cheapens their experience, their

hard work, to have people jumping

the border, taking advantage of

loopholes in our system. It makes a

mockery of everything they've

worked for and turns it into a big

steaming pile of--

BENZ

Thank you, that'll be all.

BENZ (CONT'D)

Who the fuck is this?

MCLAUGHLIN

It's Mario. He's my goddamn

hairdresser.

BENZ

Get out. Get the fuck out.

MCLAUGHLIN

I've got to look good for my

constituency.

BENZ

You're in here with a reporter and

a fucking shampoo queen, for Christ

sake.

MCLAUGHLIN

Mario's the best.

BENZ

People want to know you're one of

them. From now on, No manicures, no

massages, no English tailored

suits.

MCLAUGHLIN

Who died up your ass, Benz? I'm

elected, you sonofabitch. The

people have spoken, by a slim

margin maybe, but they picked me.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 18.

BENZ

And they'll be picking through your

trash looking for a reason to fuck

you up. I'm doing everything I can

to make your Von problem go away.

Don't add more fuel to the fire.

MCLAUGHLIN

Von... that fat sonofabitch. What

does he say?

BENZ

I don't give a damn. As long as he

lays low and doesn't take a step

out of his little tree fort, he and

his boys can play soldier till Hell

freezes over.

MAN

Maybe we shouldn't be doing this,

Von. Not with the heat we're under.

VON

"Congress shall make no law

abridging the right of the people

peaceably to assemble, and to

petition the Government for a

redress of grievances." Do you know

what that's from?

MAN

The Constitution?

VON

The First Fuckin Amendment

"Congress shall make no law

abridging the right of the people

peaceably to assemble, and to

petition the Government for a

redress of grievances." I would

like to assemble peaceably as I

have some grievances to redress.

Now is that all right with you?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 19.

WOMAN

You!

WOMAN (CONT'D)

You're not Cisco. You're new here,

aren't you? Well, one of the

toilets in the ladies' is busted

again, and you need to clean it up

snappy.

MACHETE

This is Cisco's floor. I'm on 11.

WOMAN

But this is an emergency!

MACHETE

Find Cisco.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 20.

SPEAKER

We're at a crossroads in this great

land, and one man has the vision to

see us into the future.

MILITIA MAN

(APPLAUDING)

Our man's up next.

VON

It's a great day in America, Amen.

SPEAKER

Please join me in welcoming our

great State Senator John

McLaughlin!

MCLAUGHLIN

Make no mistake, my friends: We are

at WAR. Every time an illegal

sneaks across the border by dark of

night it is an act of aggression

against the United States. And I

submit to you, it is an overt act

of TERRORISM. These people are

TERRORISTS.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 21.

GUARD

(INTO RADIO)

Roger. I'm on my way.

GUARD (CONT'D)

Hey!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 22.

MCLAUGHLIN

The fuck was that?

BENZ

I'd say it was a fucking gift from

the Gods.

MCLAUGHLIN

What are you talking about?

BENZ

Get ready for your numbers to rise

like Lazarus. A thousand bucks says

it was some bean-eating wetback

just took a potshot at you. It will

put the fear of God into the ethics

commission. Now we get you to the

hospital, you make your bedside

speech and you're set.

MCLAUGHLIN

Fix me a goddamn drink.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 23.

PATROLMAN

Go ahead Jorge, I'll grease your

chips all over this fucking alley!

PATROLMAN (CONT'D)

It's going to turn into a lynch mob

if we don't get him out of here

now.

PATROLMAN

This is fucking big. This guy took

a shot at a Representative.

COP

Senator.

PATROLMAN

Same fucking thing. He could die,

and we caught him.

COP

Yeah, we did. They're gonna hang

him like Saddam.

PATROLMAN

We're fuckin' heroes, buddy.

COP

I'm gonna call it in. Unless you

want to do it.

PATROLMAN

No. You go ahead. You're good at

it.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 24.

COP

What the fuck is that supposed to

mean? That I'm not good at the

action stuff? Just the pussy stuff?

PATROLMAN

Did I fuckin' say that?

COP

Did you fuckin' mean it?

PATROLMAN

Look, you and me both apprehended

this fuckin' suspect. We frisked

him and we cuffed him and now we're

bringin' him downtown. We're gonna

get a medal for this.

COP

I didn't frisk him.

PATROLMAN

Yeah, you did.

COP

I'm telling you. I didn't frisk

him. You must have done it.

PATROLMAN

I didn't frisk him. I thought you--

COP

Jesus fuck! What's wrong, man?

PATROLMAN

(SPITTING BLOOD)

Oh, fuck!

COP

Slow down, man!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 25.

COP (CONT'D)

Holy shit!

ELEKTRA

Hey, turn that up, would you?

TV REPORTER

(ON TV)

...at the scene of an incredible

accident just moments after the

attempt on State Senator

McLaughlin's life and we're not

sure if this individual was in

custody or was hit by the vehicle

but he appears to be injured--

TV REPORTER

Holy fuck!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 26.

ELEKTRA

I'm watching it.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

Don't watch it. Get on it now! I

want that suspect.

ELEKTRA

What do you know?

BOSS

I only know what you know, and

right know, you don't know dick.

ELEKTRA

I'm gone, relax.

SNIPER

(ON PHONE)

I think he's toast.

BENZ

(ON PHONE)

Don't think. Know. Check the

hospital. Check the morgue. Fucking

verify.

SNIPER

(HANGING UP)

Now that's what I call a fuckable

ass.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 27.

NURSE

(quietly in Spanish)

They don't know you're here yet.

You were brought in as a Juan Doe.

Innocent bystander.

NURSE

Here he is, Doc.

DOC FELIX

Good girl.

NURSE

Hey Doc... I can feel your eyeballs

in my uterus.

DOC FELIX

Let's investigate that.

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

Oh hey, the hero has awoken. Check

it out.

(Holds up X-Rays)

This is amazing. You can see the

bullet rebounded, entered the back

of the cranium and was stopped by

another bullet already lodged in

the bone. I've never seen anything

like it. If he hadn't been shot

before he would be dead now.

There's a lesson in there

somewhere...

SECURITY GUARD

You're going to tell me who you're

working for or I'll bury your spic

ass and have your wife turning

tricks for tacos by breakfast.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 28.

DOC FELIX

Hey, buddy. This is a patient of

mine. He's in a fragile state. He's

got a bullet in his cranium.

SECURITY GUARD

This wetback tried to kill the

Senator, Doc! It's all over the TV.

DOC FELIX

Yeah? In that case you better let

me keep him alive so you can beat

the truth out of him. And collect

the reward.

SECURITY GUARD

You're alright, Doc. You know how

it is, they take our welfare money.

There ain't none left for us decent

folk... Now you get him lucid so I

can torture him good.

DOC FELIX

Lucid. That's a good word. Go get a

coffee and donut out in the lobby.

I'll come get you when he's ready.

SECURITY GUARD

I'll be waiting.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 29.

DOC FELIX

(IN PERFECT SPANISH)

Don't worry, amigo, this is not my

country. I'm from Cuba; one hundred

percent. She's from Puerto Rico.

We're all Children of the Sun.

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

Leave him alone.

(BEAT)

Now these are my friends.

(taps the needles)

They will cheer you up special

until these bullet holes feel like

little butterfly kisses.

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

This one here...

SECURITY GUARD (0.C.)

Hurry up in there!

DOC FELIX

...is for me.

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

Oh wow, that hit the spot... all

the spots!

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

This one, I call this one "Popeye."

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 30.

MACHETE

Another way out?

DOC FELIX

Wait, I got something.

DOC FELIX (CONT'D)

SKULL SCRAPER. We use this to

scrape the bones clean. It cuts

through flesh like butta.

MACHETE

Thanks.

DOC FELIX

Vaya con Dios.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 31.

MCLAUGHLIN

(ON PHONE)

This act... this cowardly act...

(MORE)

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 32.

MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)

will not end my struggle, to keep

our country safe from those who

would destroy it. God bless

everyone who stood with me today, I

will return to the fight. And God

Bless America.

BENZ

No further statements. We only hope

that the perpetrator is brought to

swift justice in an American court.

ELEKTRA

Elektra Rivers, Department of

Homeland Security.

BENZ

This is a state matter. We've

already talked to--

ELEKTRA

DHS has jurisdiction over everyone

so give it a rest, Mr--

BENZ

Booth. Michael Booth.

MCLAUGHLIN

I don't know what I can do to help

you in here, Agent Rivers. You want

to find the bastard did this, go

look for him.

ELEKTRA

I appreciate that, sir, and I

ASSURE YOU--

MCLAUGHLIN

You can't assure dick. Just ask

what you want and then you can be

on your way.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 33.

ELEKTRA

Is the shooter known to you, I

mean, did you have any warnings or

communication before today?

MCLAUGHLIN

No.

ELEKTRA

My expertise is in profiling and

assessing risks of potentially

dangerous individuals who are in

this country illegally.

BENZ

Looks like you missed one.

ELEKTRA

Would you like additional DHS

officers assigned to your security

detail?

BENZ

The senator is trying to project an

image of resilience, not fear. Now

I'm sure you'll agree, the Senator

has had a very trying day.

ELEKTRA

Here's my card, in case you change

your mind. Or you think of anything

else.

BENZ

You'll be the first person I call.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 34.

LUZ

Hijo de la chingada. What happened

to you?

HENCHMAN

Booth isn't going to like this.

What are we going to tell him?

SNIPER

(CALM)

"Oops."

LUZ

You'll be safe here.

MACHETE

Did you open it?

LUZ

No.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 35.

LUZ (CONT'D)

Nothing worth nothing here, unless

you were going to make a pinata.

Now lie back.

LUZ (CONT'D)

You know what this is, right?

LUZ (CONT'D)

Works every time. When the sun

rises, you'll be good.

MACHETE

I don't know about that.

LUZ

Cuidado, chico. You might burn

yourself.

MACHETE

Why are you helping me?

LUZ

You know why Machete.

MACHETE

You know me?

LUZ

No, but I know the myth of the last

honest cop in Mexico.

MACHETE

The myth might be better.

LUZ

Cada uno lleva su cruz (sub. We

each have our cross to bear)

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 36.

ELEKTRA

Good. Now I can get some answers.

ELEKTRA

McGraw? McGraw, are you here?

ELEKTRA

Goddamnit! You're fucking my

sister?

MCGRAW

Your sister? Holy shit. I thought

it was you.

ELEKTRA

Fuckin' liar.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Did you at least get me the files?

MCGRAW

Sure I did.

ELEKTRA

Well, where the hell are they?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 37.

MCGRAW

Uh... uh... uhh...

ELEKTRA

Never mind. I see `em.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

If you need me, I'll be in the

bath. Slut.

SIS

Bitch.

JUNE

The nerve. An honest, dedicated

American like John. What on earth

were they thinking?

BENZ

They weren't, dear. They weren't.

JUNE

I worry more about April. What kind

of world are we leaving her?

APRIL

I think Cole is going to ask me to

marry him.

JUNE

Oh, honey that's--

APRIL

But I don't want to marry him.

JUNE

Terrible.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 38.

APRIL

I mean, look at me. I'm not ready

for that kind of commission.

BENZ

Commitment.

APRIL

That either. I have priorities.

JUNE

Good for you.

BENZ

School, career. Those come first.

APRIL

I'm talking about my modeling.

BENZ

You're a beautiful girl, April, but

that's a tough nut to crack.

APRIL

No it isn't. Do you know how many

hits I've gotten on my website?

BENZ

You have a website?

(TO JUNE)

She has a website. You know about

this?

APRIL

I know what the online public

wants, and they want me. All of me.

Cole's just going to have to wait.

BENZ

We'll talk about this later. I'll

be in my office.

JUNE

(whispering to April)

Are there cute guys on there? You

need me to inspect them I think.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 39.

APRIL

(WHISPERING)

No way! You're such a slut, Mom!

You're a Cougar slut!

BENZ

I hope you've got something to

celebrate.

SNIPER

He's off the grid. Sonofabitch

disappeared.

BENZ

I picked him up here. Find out if

anyone's seen him. He couldn't have

done it on his own. He has help.

Find the help.

Local contact?

ELEKTRA

Ex-boyfriend. Whatever.

BOSS

And?

ELEKTRA

He's dangerous.

BOSS

I knew there was a reason we kept

ELEKTRA

I'm working on it.

Get him. The hammer's coming down

MACHETE

Bless me, Padre, for I have sinned.

It's been a long fucking time since

my last confession.

PADRE

I was wondering when you were going

to show yourself. They're combing

the city for you. How long before

they get your file and track down

your stepbrother, the priest?

MACHETE

Sorry, bro. I mean, Padre.

PADRE

You were wrong to come here. How

long have you been here anyway?

MACHETE

Few weeks.

PADRE

Why didn't you come to me before?

MACHETE

Didn't need you before.

PADRE

What do you think I can do for you?

Give you absolution? You have to be

sorry for your sins, first.

MACHETE

I'm not sorry.

PADRE

I'm not surprised.

MACHETE

They used me.

PADRE

They use all of us. Welcome to the

real world.

MACHETE

They need to pay.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 46.

PADRE

In money or blood?

MACHETE

Either. Both.

PADRE

I am a man of faith. I took a vow

of peace. You want me to help you

kill all these men?

MACHETE

Yes, bro. I mean, Padre.

PADRE

I'll see what I can do.

LUZ

Hey Culero, leave them alone. They

don't like pork.

I'm no cop. You seen this guy?

LUZ

Have you seen him?

SNIPER

Call me when he shows or I'll carve

that pretty face of yours into a

seven layer burrito got that puta!?

MACHETE

When I get the money, I'll give

some to the church.

PADRE

You think Jesus wants your blood

money, Judas?

PADRE (CONT'D)

How much blood money are we talking

about?

MACHETE

A hundred-fifty thousand.

PADRE

(SPIT-TAKE)

Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I want you

to say ten Our Fathers, ten Hail

Marys and ten Glory Be's, and I

want you to light a candle for Dad.

PADRE (CONT'D)

I had them installed last year. Too

many things were walking away from

the altar, the collection plate.

Check this out.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 48.

PADRE (CONT'D)

No time for that now. You need to

see this. I Tivo'd it earlier.

MACHETE

Stop it.

MACHETE (CONT'D)

That one. He's the one who hired

me. Benz.

PADRE

That's Michael Booth. McLaughlin's

aide or something. Cabrones, los

dos. Why would he hire you to kill

his boss?

MCLAUGHLIN

(ON TV)

.....that I may return to the

senate and fight on.

NEWS ANCHOR

(voice-over on TV)

Polls show McLaughlin's numbers are

surging since the assassination

attempt and officials say they've

put a hold on the ethics committee

investigation into McLaughlin's

ties to the Freedom Force militia.

Meanwhile, police continue to scour

the city for the perpetrator. If

you have any information on the

whereabouts of this man--

MACHETE

Where does he live?

PADRE

Machete, you can't just kill

everyone!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 49.

MACHETE

I'll leave some for you.

PADRE

That's not what I meant.

GUY

What are you looking for, gringo?

SNIPER

This guy.

GUY

Looks like my sister's boyfriend's

cousin's mother's son.

SNIPER

You're sharp. You're liable to get

cut.

SNIPER (CONT'D)

Safety first.

SNIPER

Lead's ran cold. He's underground.

Probably back in the homeland by

now.

SNIPER (CONT'D)

Ho-ly shit. Who knew that your

Mexican day laborer was a goddamn

Federale?!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 50.

BENZ

Yeah.

MACHETE

(ON PHONE)

My money.

BENZ

Holy Mother of Christ. You've got

some balls. You missed, asshole.

MACHETE

Or else.

BENZ

Or else what?...Hello?

APRIL

Hey, you're not the usual boy!

MACHETE

He called in sick.

JUNE

That little bastard promised me a

ride on his leafblower.

APRIL

Don't be shy.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 51.

APRIL (CONT'D)

Why don't you come in? The water's

fine.

JUNE

That's right. Come on in, sugar! We

like variety around here, no matter

what the boys say. You want a wine

cooler?

APRIL

Oh, momma! He's got the good stuff!

DISSOLVE TO:

BENZ

June? April?

MACHETE

(ON PHONE)

Or else this.

BENZ

Where is my wife and daughter!?!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 52.

PADRE

Holy...

VON

Well, well, Look what's come asking

for Papa Von's help.

BENZ

It's beyond my reach, Von. I need

you on this now.

VON

You needed me from the get go, but

let's not piss on what's past.

BENZ

He's got my wife and daughter.

VON

Sweet Jesus. I bet he's got a big

imagination what to do with a

couple cutie pies like that. Makes

me ill just thinking about it. You

must have broken off a dick in his

ass. First he comes after your

boss, then he comes after your

family. Who's next?

BENZ

Just find him.

VON

Ain't you worried about staining

the Senator bringing us into this?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 53.

BENZ

Don't you read the papers?

McLaughlin's a goddamn saint, a

fucking martyr. I've seen to that.

VON

What do you think he meant by that?

VON (CONT'D)

Boys! We're goin hunting.

MACHETE

Drive.

ELEKTRA

You can put the gun away. I'm not

going to give you any trouble.

MACHETE

You're a cop.

ELEKTRA

Homeland Security. I guess that

makes you a terrorist.

MACHETE

How did you find me?

ELEKTRA

Come on. Give me some credit. It's

not every ex-Federale-turned-

assassin that has a local priest on

the family payroll.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 54.

MACHETE

Turn here.

ELEKTRA

So are you going to tell me why you

did it? Destiny, maybe?

MACHETE

It was just a job.

ELEKTRA

A job? Who hired you? The

undocumented workers' union?

MACHETE

Michael Booth.

ELEKTRA

Sonofabitch. Can you prove that?

MACHETE

Maybe. Turn here.

MACHETE (CONT'D)

Give me ten dollars.

ELEKTRA

What? Why?

MACHETE

Ten bucks.

MACHETE (CONT'D)

Stop the car.

MACHETE

Wait.

LUZ

You get around.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 55.

MACHETE

For the tacos and coffee.

LUZ

Yeah, they came looking for you. I

told them nothing, as far as I know

you're a myth.

ELEKTRA

"Feelings of righteousness and

purpose."

MACHETE

Drive.

ELEKTRA

Sure thing, Boss.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Sonofabitch!

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

What the fuck, man?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 56.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

My gun!

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

You're shot.

MACHETE

No hospital.

ELEKTRA

Let me bring you to a safehouse. I

can negotiate your safety. We'll

bring Booth down together.

MACHETE

Onions.

ELEKTRA

You want onions?! Oh shit, you're

delirious, dying. Don't die please.

MACHETE

Onions!

ELEKTRA

What? What do you do with...

MACHETE

Come here.

ELEKTRA

What, is this some "old Aztec" shit

that's supposed to heal you?

MACHETE

Yes.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 57.

ELEKTRA

What do I do with this?

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Wait, you want this gunk squirted

in there...I don't...

MACHETE

Do it.

ELEKTRA

I....can't.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Fuck.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Ahhhh!

APRIL

Mom? Where are we? I'm scared.

JUNE

Me, too, honey.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 58.

APRIL

What is this place?

ELEKTRA

That was disgusting.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Do you mind not breaking knives in

the house? It's kind of one of my

rules. I mean...

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Oh shit. All right. I'm going to

tell him what you told me. Wish me

luck.

MACHETE

Luck.

ELEKTRA

(ANSWERING PHONE)

Yeah.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

Where the hell have you been?

ELEKTRA

I had a little fender bender.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

Goddamnit! I said where have you

been?

ELEKTRA

Calm down! I have him right now.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 59.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

You do?

ELEKTRA

Yes, but it's complicated. He's

innocent. Sort of.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

Sonofabitch. What kind of Stockholm

Syndrome bullshit are you trying to

pull?

ELEKTRA

Just listen. Michael Booth

orchestrated the assassination

attempt on McLaughlin's life.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

His own advisor?

ELEKTRA

That's right. This was all some

kind of hare-brained scheme to call

off the ethics investigation. I

think I can get Machete to testify.

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

You do, huh? Well that doesn't

matter because no charges are going

to be filed against Booth.

ELEKTRA

What?

BOSS

(ON PHONE)

The order's come down from top

brass: No more black eyes on DHS.

Bring in the Mexican. Dead or

alive. Now are you gonna DO your

fucking job or are you gonna LOSE

your fucking job?

BOSS (CONT'D)

(ON PHONE)

Agent Rivers! Agent Rivers! Answer

me, goddamnit!

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 60.

PADRE

What do you want me to do with

this? We can't keep them locked up

forever.

VON

The day is upon us, my friends.

We'll take down the interloper, and

anyone who gets in our way.

VON (CONT'D)

Do you believe in freedom?!

VON (CONT'D)

Will you die for freedom!

VON (CONT'D)

If that's what it takes to make you

free, I will kill you with my own

bare hands, Amen.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 61.

VON (CONT'D)

Heal up, brothers. Heal up good.

The day is upon us.

SNIPER

Oh shit.

SNIPER

Yeah.

BENZ

You seeing this?

SNIPER

Yeah.

BENZ

We have to find him. We have to

find him now! I'm going to rip his

heart out with my teeth!

SNIPER

Moron.

God has mercy. I don't.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 65.

SNIPER

Where is he?

PADRE

In your nightmares.

PADRE (CONT'D)

(TO BOOTH)

You're afraid to get your hands

dirty, so you make others carry out

your sins.

BENZ

You want to be a martyr? I'm good

at making martyrs.

PADRE

Like McLaughlin?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 66.

BENZ

That's right. In our own way, we

can all be like Christ. Too bad for

you, you chose the worst way.

PADRE

You're so drunk with power, you

ordered the hit on your own boss.

BENZ

This is the boss.

BENZ (CONT'D)

Now for the last time... where are

my wife and daughter?

ELEKTRA

I came back to look for you, and I

found him like... this.

MACHETE ELEKTRA

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

That's what my Grandma used to say.

MACHETE

The guards told me that before they

beat me.

ELEKTRA

I'm sorry.

MACHETE

You came to arrest me?

ELEKTRA

Not me. I'm out. But others will.

MACHETE

Out?

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 68.

ELEKTRA

They don't care about Booth. They

just want to wipe you out. You're

an embarrassment to the feds. I

guess I am, too.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

You could have killed me.

MACHETE

(SMILING)

The day's still young.

ELEKTRA

I want to help you.

MACHETE

Help me find Booth.

ELEKTRA

First things first, I need a drink.

ELEKTRA

Shit my heel is broke.

MACHETE

Give it here.

ELEKTRA

It's nice having a man around. It's

been a while.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

How long awhile you ask? Well,

About two years.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 69.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Oh that got your attention? Hmm,

Actually you're better than my last

boyfriend. He never listened. I

don't know why I got so desperate.

Don't want to grow old alone I

guess. You ever get that feeling

you're alone and that you'll never

meet that one person...

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Are you listening to me?

MACHETE

Si.

ELEKTRA

Give me that bottle.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

So what happens now, when you get

him, that's it? It's over?

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Did you hear that? Stay here.

ELEKTRA

Oh wow...is that a machete in your

pocket or...

MACHETE

You're borracha.

the agency.

MACHETE

Come on!

SNIPER

Machete you can come quietly and we

won't hurt the girl.

Goddamn A T & T.

MCLAUGHLIN

Where the fuck have you been?

BENZ

Taking care of business.

MCLAUGHLIN

My business is here. Did you see

those crews out there? They expect

a statement.

(noticing Booth's ragged

APPEARANCE)

Jesus, what happened to you?

BENZ

Nothing. Just had a little talk

with a priest.

MCLAUGHLIN

Well, what am I going to tell `em?

BENZ

Whatever you tell them, I'm sure

it'll be golden.

(off McLaughlin's blank

LOOK)

Just feed them the line about

standing steadfast in the face of

terrorism, continuing the fight.

You know it by heart.

MCLAUGHLIN

I do. All right. Once this is done,

you need to take a vacation. You

need some air.

BENZ

Maybe.

MCLAUGHLIN

No doubt about it. You're losing

your marbles, Booth.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 75.

MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)

It's showtime.

MCLAUGHLIN

I'd just like to thank the all of

you for your support during this

difficult time.

MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)

My will to fight has only just

begun. We must not let the

terrorists win this battle for our

land, our America! Thank you.

REPORTER

Congressman, there are reports

implicating your advisors as having

orchestrated the shooting. Would

you care to comment?

You want to be a martyr? I'm good

No further comment. Thank you.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 77.

MCLAUGHLIN

What did you do, Booth? You

jeopardized my career with that

wetback! He could have fucking

killed me!

BENZ

Not with that scope.

MCLAUGHLIN

You stupid sonofabitch. You pull

something like this, without

consulting me?! You fucked me. You

are a stupid sonofabitch. The press

is going to demand answers! You got

another brilliant solution for

that?

Up? Up where?

Up your fat, fishbelly ass!

Fine. Bring him here. Papa Von's

got a big surprise a-waiting.

ELEKTRA

Shit. I don't even want to know who

she's fucking now.

ELEKTRA

Fucking shit, bitch. Make him pay

for a goddamn hotel.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Sis?

TORREZ

She was just a warmup. Now I'm

ready for dessert.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 80.

BENZ

Shut the gate quick! He's after me!

BENZ (CONT'D)

He killed McLaughlin. He's coming

after me.

VON

And you led him right to Papa Von.

That's some kind of thank you.

BENZ

I saw to it that McLaughlin gave

you the keys to this fortress. You

owe us.

VON

The senator, maybe. But what

exactly do I owe you, turncoat?

BENZ

What are you talkin--

VON

You held the hand that held the

gun, Booth. Just as good as you

killed him.

VON (CONT'D)

Put the traitor in the brig.

BENZ

You can't do this to me, Von! You

need me!

TORREZ (CONT'D)

Most people die in the fire, but

you survived, you unlucky bastard.

MACHETE

I was born in the fire. It wasn't

luck.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83.

TORREZ

Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good

job picking melons. While I bought

the world.

MACHETE

Machete. Your father taught it to

MACHETE

Why do I want to be a real
