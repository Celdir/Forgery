SALESMAN'S VOICE

You don't like flying, do you?

MCCLANE

No, no, where'd you get that idea?

SALESMAN

(smiling)

Ya wanna know the secret of successful

air travel?  After you get where you're

going, ya take off your shoes and socks.

Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot

and make fists with your toes.

MCCLANE

Fists with your toes.

SALESMAN

Maybe it's not a fist when it's your

toes...I mean like this...work out

that time zone tension.

(demonstrating)

Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot

shower for the old jet lag.  I know

it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've

been doing it for nine years.

MCCLANE

It's okay.

(showing badge)

I'm a cop.

(pause)

Trust me.  I've been doing it for

eleven.

3-C     A PRETTY STEWARDESS                                    3-C

STEWARDESS

(smiling, about the bear)

Maybe you should have bought her a

ticket.

MCCLANE

Her?

MCCLANE

She doesn't complain.

STEWARDESS

(eying him)

Neither would I.

TAKAGI

Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate

each and every one of you for making

this one of the greatest days in the

history of the Nakatomi corporation...

ELLIS

What about dinner?

WOMAN (HOLLY)

Harry, it's Christmas Eve.  Families...

Stockings...chestnuts...Rudolph and

Frosty...those things ring a bell?

ELLIS

(in reply)

I was thinking more of roaring

fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice

brie...

HOLLY

Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me

feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Go on,

join the party, have some champagne.

GINNY

(grateful)

Thanks Ms. Gennaro.

(worried)

Do you think the baby can handle

a little sip?

HOLLY

(eyeing her)

Ginny, that baby's ready to tend bar.

ELLIS

(not giving up)

How about tomorrow night?

INTERCUT:

LUCY

McClane residence.  Lucy McClane

speaking.

HOLLY

(with affection)

Hello, Lucy McClane.  This is your

mother.

LUCY

Mommy!  When are you coming home?!

HOLLY

Soon.  You'll be in bed when I get

there, though.

LUCY

Will you come say 'good night'?

HOLLY

Don't I always, you goose?

(enjoying Lucy's giggle)

Now put Paulina on the line, and

no searching the house for presents!

LUCY

(caught)

I didn't look in the front closet

under the steps!  Is Daddy coming

home with you?

JOHN, JR.

(hearing this, jumping up

and down)

Yeah!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!

(on second thought)

And a Captain Power!

HOLLY

(a little tightly)

Well, we'll see what Santa and Mommy

can do.  Goose, put Paulina on, okay?

PAULINA

Hello, Mrs. Holly.  You coming home

soon?

HOLLY

I'm working on it.

(beat)

Did Mr. McClane call?                               *

PAULINA

No ma'am.

HOLLY

Well...maybe there wasn't time before               *

the flight.  You should probably make

up the spare room just in case.

PAULINA

(smiling)

Yes, Mrs. Holly.  I do that already.                *

MCCLANE

I'm John McClane.

ARGYLE

(introducing himself)

Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey,

nice bag.

MCCLANE

Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?

ARGYLE

(stops)

Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to

help me, man.  This is my first time

driving a limo.

MCCLANE

That's okay.  This is my first time

riding in one.

CUT TO:

8       WITH THE LIMO - DUSK                                   8

ARGYLE

Just kick back and relax, man.  We

got everything you need:  CD, CB,

TV, VHS, telephone, full bar.

ARGYLE

If your friend is hot to trot...I

know a couple of mama bears.

(turning to McClane)

...Or is he married?

MCCLANE

Married.

ARGYLE

The girl was off today.  Hey, I

didn't expect you to sit up front.

(back to the topic)

So, your lady live out here?

MCCLANE

The past six months.

ARGYLE

(thinking about that)

Meanwhile, you still live in

New York?

MCCLANE

You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?

ARGYLE

Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a

cabdriver, see, people expected a little

chit chat, a little eccentricity and

comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you

limo guys were, so excuse me.

MCCLANE

(amused)

It's okay, it's okay.

ARGYLE

(instantly)

So, you divorced of what?

MCCLANE

She had a good job, it turned into

a great career.

ARGYLE

But meant her moving here.

MCCLANE

Closer to Japan.  You're fast.

ARGYLE

So, why didn't you come?

MCCLANE

'Cause I'm a New York cop who used

to be a New York kid, and I got six

months backlog of New York scumbags

I'm still trying to put behind bars.

I don't just get up and move.

ARGYLE

(to the point)

You mean you thought she wouldn't

make it out here and she'd come

crawling on back, so why bother to

pack?

MCCLANE

Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

ARGYLE

(popping in a cassette)

Mind if I play some tunes?

MCCLANE

How 'bout some Christmas music?

ARGYLE

That is Christmas music.

ARGYLE

So, you go on upstairs to the party,

your lady sees you, you run into each

other's arms.  Music comes up, you

live happily ever after, that it?

MCCLANE

It's corny, but I could live with it.

ARGYLE

What is it don't work out that way?

Where you gonna stay?

MCCLANE

I'll find someplace.

ARGYLE

Tell you what.  I'll pull into the

parking garage and wait.  You score

with your wife give me a call on the

car phone and I'll leave your bags

inside at the desk.  You strike out...

I'll get you to a hotel.

MCCLANE

(taking the number)

You're all right, Argyle.

ARGYLE

Just remember that when you sign

for the tip.

(pointing to the

building)

They're paying for it, so don't be

shy.

MCCLANE

Excuse me, I'm looking for --

TAKAGI

Holly Gennero?

MCCLANE

Yeah.  How'd you know?

TAKAGI

I've spent half my life on airplanes,               *

I can recognize someone who just

got off one.

(shaking hands)

I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have

...something to do with this company.

MCCLANE

So I've heard.

TAKAGI

Holly went to the Vault room to FAX

some documents...she should be back

any...

16      HOLLY'S OFFICE                                         16

ELLIS

Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick

call, and this was the nearest phone...

TAKAGI

(as Ellis rises)

Ellis, this is John McClane...

(with meaning)

Holly's policeman?

(to McClane)

Ellis is in charge of International

Acquisitions.

MCCLANE

(shaking hands with Ellis)

That explains the recent deal with

Bolivia.

MCCLANE

(sotto)

Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.

TAKAGI

(eager to change the

subject, to McClane)

Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake?

Watered down champagne punch?

MCCLANE

(grinning)

I'm fine.

(looking through the

glass)

You throw quite a party.  I didn't

know they had Christmas in Japan.

TAKAGI

Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor

didn't work out, we got you with

tape decks.

ELLIS

Actually, it's kind of a double celebration.        *

We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot

of it was due to Holly.

HOLLY

All set, Joe.  The contracts went

over the wire, and --

(surprised)

John...!

16-A    MCCLANE AND HOLLY                                      16-A

HOLLY

(recovering)

I was hoping you made that flight.

JOHN

(quietly)

I was hoping you were hoping that.

TAKAGI

(to McClane)

You wife's made for this business.

She know how to drive a hard bargain.

MCCLANE

Yeah.  I remember our first date.

ELLIS

Show him the watch.

ELLIS

Go on, show him.  What're you,

embarrassed?

(to McClane)

A little token of our appreciation

for all her work.

MCCLANE

Nice, but one of us is three hours

out of sync.  I think it's me.

(to Holly, pointedly)

Is there a place I can wash up?

HOLLY

(happy for the excuse)

Sure.  Follow me.

MCCLANE

(surprised, actually feeling

tension decline)

Son-of-a-bitch.  It works.

Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie

shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath.

HOLLY

What are you doing?

MCCLANE

It's a long story.  You know, I

think that Ellis has his eye on you.

HOLLY

That's okay...

(pause)

... I have an eye on his private

bathroom.

McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not

to show any).

*

HOLLY

So, where are you staying?  This                    *

all happened so fast I didn't even

ask you on the phone.

McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.

MCCLANE

Well, Cappy Roberts retired out

here a couple years ago.  He said I

could bunk with him.

HOLLY

Oh...Where does he live?

MCCLANE

Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.

HOLLY

Pomona!  You'll be in the car the

whole time...Look, let's make this

easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's

not huge, but the kids would love to

have you at the house.

McClane fixes her with a look.

MCCLANE

They would, huh?

HOLLY

(beat; honest)

I would too.

*

They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that

says a lot about how they still feel about each other.

Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the

door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty

retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly

tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.

HOLLY

...I've missed you.                                 *

MCCLANE

Especially my name.  You must miss

it every time you write a check.  When

did you start calling yourself

'Ms. Gennero'?

HOLLY

(caught)

This is a Japanese company, you know?

They figure a married woman, she's on

the way out the door...

MCCLANE

Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember

this one particular married woman,

she went out the door so fast there

was practically a jetwash...I mean,

talk about your wind chill factor...

HOLLY

Didn't we have this same conversation

in July?  Damn it, John, there was

an opportunity out here -- I had to

take it --

MCCLANE

No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?

HOLLY

My job and my title and my salary did

nothing to our marriage except change

your idea of what it should be.

MCCLANE

Oh, here it comes.  One of those

'meaningful relationship conversations.'

I never should've let you get those

magazine subscriptions --

HOLLY

You want to know my idea of a marriage?

It's a partnership where people help

each other over the rough spots --

console each other when there's a

down...and when there's an up, well,

hell, a little Goddamn applause or

an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

(quietly)

I needed that, John.

(pause)

I deserved that.

There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to

say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

the door opens and Ginny leans inside.

GINNY

Miz Gennero?  Mr. Takagi is looking

for you...he wants you to say something

to the troops...

HOLLY

Thanks, Ginny.  I'll be a second.

Oh, this is --

MCCLANE

(mock bright 'radio' voice)

Hi.  John Gennero here.  I'm the

sensitive and supportive man of the

eighties.

Ginny looks puzzled, goes out.  Holly sighs, moves to the

door.

HOLLY

I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --

MCCLANE

Don't I always?

She's gone.  Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite.

MCCLANE

Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your

You'll lock them up there and come

Stay low.  They're expecting transports,

LITTLE JOHNSON

I figure we take out all the terrorists,

25, tops.

I can live with those numbers.
