PADDY

Tommy?

PADDY (CONT'D)

What're you doing here?

TOMMY

I was just passing through. Figured

why not have a belt with the old

man.

2.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

She looks good.

PADDY

(patting car hood)

Yeah, she's hanging in there.

TOMMY

Well, you always did take good care

of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of

priorities.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Got a little something for ya. Mom

always said never go anywhere empty

handed.

PADDY

She did. But that's not for me

anymore, Tommy.

TOMMY

What? You change brands?

PADDY

C'mon, let's go inside.

TOMMY

I like what you've done with the

place.

3.

PADDY (O.S.)

Appreciate that.

TOMMY

There's not much of a woman's touch

around here.

PADDY (O.S.)

No more women for me, Tommy.

TOMMY

Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl

who can take a punch nowadays.

PADDY

Here you go.

TOMMY

Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in

14 years and you're not gonna have

a drink with him?

PADDY

I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming

up on a thousand days.

TOMMY

C'mon, just one drink.

PADDY

No.

4.

PADDY (CONT'D)

(OFF PICTURE)

He's a school teacher down in

Philly.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Remember Tess? They've got two

beautiful little girls.

TOMMY

So you found God, huh? That's

awesome. Mom kept calling for him,

but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus

was down at the mill forgiving all

the drunks. Who knew?

TOMMY (CONT'D)

So, you gonna ask about her, or you

just gonna sit there all sober?

PADDY

I know.

TOMMY

Oh, you know? What do you know? Do

you know it wasn't enough just to

drive west to get away from you?

When we hit the water we drove

north, too.

PADDY

When I got sober I hired a man to

find you.

5.

TOMMY

(taking a swig)

Is that one of the 12 steps? Or

does a guy like you get 24?

PADDY

Just the 12.

TOMMY

Did your guy tell you what you

needed to know?

PADDY

Just that your mother died in

Tacoma. And you were in the

Marines. That was all. That was

enough.

TOMMY

That's too bad. You could've gotten

some good details.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

You could've heard about her

coughing up blood in a shit box

with no heat. Having me rub her

down with holy water, because she

didn't have no insurance. All the

while waiting for your pal Jesus to

save her. Did your man tell you

that?

PADDY

I'm sorry, Tommy.

TOMMY

It's good to know you're sorry,

Pop. Goes a long way.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

I think I liked you better when you

were a drunk.

6.

TESS

What's going on here?

BRENDAN

Well, I'm not sure, but I think

Daddy is now a princess.

TESS

Em, you want to open your presents?

TESS (CONT'D)

(off pink box)

This an awfully big box.

BRENDAN

It's her birthday.

7.

TESS

(TEASING)

I know, but that's why you call it

a budget. You set it, and you don't

budge.

TESS

Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying

goodbye to the girls. She's gotta

get on the road. They've been fed.

They just need a bath.

BRENDAN

I'm on it.

TESS

Can you get them down at a

reasonable time tonight? They're

exhausted.

BRENDAN

Where's the rest of that skirt?

TESS

Babe.

BRENDAN

Listen, if any guys give you a

hassle in that joint tonight you

give me a call, okay?

8.

TESS

(off his cut)

Yeah. Just like you gave me a call

when those Temple frat boys decided

to smash up your face.

BRENDAN

I told you, most nights I sit on

the stool and grade papers, but

every now and then I need some

action.

TESS

Alright, well wait up for me

tonight. I'll see what I can do

about that.

BRENDAN

Promises, promises.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)

And we return here on MMA Live, Jon

Anik alongside billionaire fight

promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout

crew is also here. Punk and Skrape

are in the building. Now J.J., what

led to this project that is

redefining Mixed Martial Arts here

in the States?

J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)

Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport

that I've always been incredibly

passionate about. As for where the

idea for Sparta came from, I've

always kind of dug the Grand Prix

format, so I tracked these guys

down to help me out.

9.

PUNKASS (ON SCREEN)

When J.J. came to us he said he

wanted to create the Super Bowl of

Mixed Martial Arts.

SKRAPE (ON SCREEN)

And he decided to put up the five

million dollar purse, too.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)

Well, there you have it. It shall

be done. Hedge fund king J.J.

Riley, going from the lion's den of

Wall Street to the cage, promoting

the biggest winner-take-all

tournament in MMA history. Sparta.

TOMMY

Fitzy still own this?

FENROY

Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns

this gym.

FENROY (CONT'D)

Can I help you with something?

TOMMY

How's it work here?

FENROY

Thirty five a month with locker.

We're open at 7, lights out at 11.

You wanna join?

TOMMY

Sure.

FENROY

Put your name and contact info on

the card.

10.

BRENDAN

Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in

this too, OK? Listen up. So we have

a body at rest, and you have the

bat which needs--

TITO

Acceleration.

BRENDAN

Acceleration, right. If you have

enough acceleration, you have might

have a chance to break the body at

rest. OK. Go ahead.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

There we go. Alright Tito, well

done. Remind not to mess with you.

Sit down everybody. Dial it down.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

So, have we got it?

NASH

Force equals mass times

acceleration. We got it.

BRENDAN

Alright. The third law--

11.

STEPHON

How many laws this dude got?

BRENDAN

(LAUGHING)

The dude? The dude has three.

Newton the dude says that for every

action, there's an equal and

opposite reaction.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

For example, if KC does not stop

the action of sending texts in

class...

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

...and tell her posse outside to

beat it...

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

...then my reaction might be to

send her down to Principal Zito's

office. Thus setting our world back

in proper balance.

KC

Mr. C, I put it away.

BRENDAN

Alright, before you go, I have your

tests from last week.

12.

MAD DOG

Where do you find these girls?

COLT BOYD

We got a tournament coming up. You

gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?

(TO FENROY)

Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call

that Puerto Rican kid, the one that

fights outa the Bottoms. If he's

here in 20 minutes, he gets 200

bucks.

TOMMY

Yo, I'll fight him.

COLT BOYD

Do me a favor guy, go back to your

bag. We don't need anybody else

getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.

MAD DOG

Yo Rock, what happened? You leave

Mick and Paulie at home today?

FENROY

(TO COLT)

His phone's disconnected.

13.

COLT BOYD

Then go through the list. Get me

Joe Bones.

TOMMY

(TO COLT)

All I'm saying is if you need

somebody to help you, I'm happy to

keep your boy warm for you.

COLT BOYD

You ever fought before?

TOMMY

Yeah.

COLT BOYD

(TO FENROY)

This guy sign a waiver?

FENROY

All good.

COLT BOYD

What's your name?

TOMMY

Tommy.

COLT BOYD

You get tuned up in here, it's on

you, Tommy.

TOMMY

Sure, no problem.

COLT BOYD

Come on in.

14.

MAD DOG

Gonna be a hero? Alright.

TOMMY

You owe me two hundred bucks.

DAN TAYLOR

This is the new appraisal figure,

and this is how it effects the

monthly. As you can see, that puts

you upside down on your mortgage.

That's the problem. It's the

country that did the assessment,

not the bank. So, the numbers are

what they are, Mr. Conlon.

BRENDAN

Brendan.

15.

DAN TAYLOR

The numbers are what they are,

Brendan. I mean, you're a Math

teacher, you can appreciate that.

BRENDAN

I teach Physics.

DAN TAYLOR

Physics. OK. But the bank has got

to go by the new appraisal figures.

According to these figures, you're

upside down on your mortgage--

BRENDAN

You said that three times already.

I get that. But I'm asking you if

there's something else you can do.

Not the bank, you. Can you shift

things around, restructure--

DAN TAYLOR

Well, you've already refinanced

twice.

BRENDAN

Because you advised us to do that.

DAN TAYLOR

I presented you with that option.

It was your choice.

(BEAT)

I'm also showing you netted a

substantial payout with the refi.

BRENDAN

We had that conversation. I was

paying medical bills. Is that in

your file?

DAN TAYLOR

Oh, right. Sorry. Your

daughter's...kidney?

BRENDAN

Heart.

DAN TAYLOR

Heart, right.

(off stack of files on desk)

Lot of stories.

16.

BRENDAN

So my option is I've got no

options? You're not even gonna try

to help me?

DAN TAYLOR

I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can

get you 90 days to get even--

BRENDAN

90 days is not enough. My wife and

I have three jobs between us and

that doesn't cut it. So, what do

you suggest?

DAN TAYLOR

Let me ask you a question: have you

considered bankruptcy? It's a

viable option. There's no shame in

it these days.

BRENDAN

That's not how I do things.

DAN TAYLOR

Well, then you're looking at

foreclosure.

ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)

Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,

the undefeated freshman from

Pittsburgh...

ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)

...the prodigy has yet to yield a

single point in the entire

tournament. It's just

unprecedented.

17.

ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)

Tommy trained by his father since

the age of five.

ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)

You're talking about Paddy Conlon.

ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)

The controversial Paddy Conlon.

ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)

Say what you will about the methods

of the former Marine, but he's led

his son to six straight junior

Olympic titles, and now just

moments away from a high school

state championship. And there it

is! Wow!

ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)

There's just no limit to what the

future holds for this kid!

ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)

Tommy told me that he's chasing the

record of Theogenes, apparently a

mythical Greek fighter said to be

unbeaten in over 1400 bouts...

COLT BOYD

How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for

Tommy Riordan.

PADDY

Who?

COLT BOYD

Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.

PADDY

What business you got with Tommy?

18.

COLT BOYD

None yet. That's why I'm here. I

manage fighters.

COLT BOYD (CONT'D)

Tommy's been working out at my gym.

He put a beating on the number one

middleweight contender in the world

today. I want to know more about

the guy. Maybe help him out. I have

a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

PADDY

Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything

you want to know about Tommy, you

gotta ask him yourself.

COLT BOYD

I'm just looking for some general

information here.

PADDY

Like I said, anything you want to

know about Tommy, you gotta ask him

yourself.

COLT BOYD

Look, I don't mean to interrupt

your night. He put this address

down when he signed up at the gym.

PADDY

He doesn't live here.

BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)

Listen kiddo, I need you put Mommy

back on, OK? I love you.

(BEAT)

Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh,

they've got this open mic night

thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep

well. You too. Bye.

19.

ANNOUNCER

It's time for our next contest!

Introducing first, fighting out of

the red corner, from Ripley, West

Virginia, please welcome Mike "The

Mutilator" Moore!

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

And in the blue corner. He fights

out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Please welcome "Irish" Brendan

Conlon!

A

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

This bout is scheduled for three

five-minute rounds, and when the

action begins your referee is Mr.

Rick Fike.

20.

REFEREE

Fighters to the center! I want you

to obey my commands at all times.

If you have no questions, touch

gloves, back up, and wait for my

signal. Come out fighting!

REFEREE (CONT'D)

Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!

PROMOTER

Nice fight. Two more wins and you

take home the bacon.

21.

TESS

(SLEEPY)

Hey babe. How was work?

TESS (CONT'D)

Oh my God. What happened? You said

it was going to be a slow night.

BRENDAN

I'm not bouncing at a club.

TESS

What do you mean you're not

bouncing?

TESS (CONT'D)

You've been lying to me?

BRENDAN

I went in to apply. They were only

paying nine bucks an hour. Then I

saw a sign for this other thing.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

They're putting us out of the house

in three months, we're running out

OF OPTIONS--

TESS

(FURIOUS)

Then they'll put us out of the

house in three months. I'd rather

go back to the old apartment than

see you in the back of an ambulance

again.

(BEAT)

I thought we agreed that we weren't

going to raise our children in

a family where their father gets

beat up for a living.

22.

BRENDAN

We're not giving up the house. This

is our home. We're not going

BACKWARDS

TESS

We'll figure it out. But this is

what we're not going back to.

PADDY

You wanted to talk?

TOMMY

Yeah.

(BEAT)

I'm gonna start fighting.

PADDY

That right?

TOMMY

Don't play babe in the woods with

me. I know that guy from the gym

came to see you.

PADDY

Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him

anything, Tommy.

TOMMY

We wouldn't be sitting here now if

you did.

23.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Alright. Look. There's this

tournament. A big tournament. Top

sixteen middleweights in the world.

Single elimination. Winner take all

for a lot of money. I'm gonna do

that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm

gonna need a trainer. Now that much

you were good at.

(off Paddy grinning)

No, no, no. This doesn't mean

anything.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

I'm serious. We train. That's it. I

don't wanna hear a word about

anything but training, you

understand? You wanna tell your war

stories, you can take `em down to

the VFW. You can take `em to a

meeting, or church, or wherever the

hell it is you go nowadays.

PADDY

What about Colt Boyd?

TOMMY

What about him? I told him I don't

train with people I don't know.

PADDY

Ah, the devil you know.

TOMMY

Excuse me?

PADDY

The devil you know is better than

the devil you don't.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda

like old times.

24.

TOMMY

(ANGRY)

I just told you, this doesn't mean

anything. You get that through your

skull right now or I'm walking.

PADDY

Alright. Alright. But you get

something through your skull, too.

You called me. So don't go

threatening to walk every five

minutes. And since this is about

training, you dump whatever it is

you need to dump as far as those

pills are concerned. I don't want

to see `em.

PADDY (CONT'D)

In fact, hand `em over right now.

(BEAT)

I know they're on you, Tommy. You

sounded like a goddamn maraca

coming through the door.

PADDY (CONT'D)

That's not gonna do.

(SHAKING BOTTLES)

When you came through that door it

was chhh-chhh-chhh.

(holding up 3 fingers)

Three.

PADDY (CONT'D)

(off French fries)

And another thing, you don't eat

crap like this. This is for losers

and old men.

(BEAT)

And we're gonna have to bunk up. If

we're gonna do this right, you

gotta stay at the house.

(MORE)

25.

PADDY (CONT'D)

I watch your diet, we follow the

old regimen. You copy?

PADDY (CONT'D)

Copy.

TITO

My brother said he was at the strip

club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---

NASH

What's MMA?

STEPHON

Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different

styles of fighting.

KC

Your brother's a liar.

BRENDAN

Take your seats.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Now, please.

26.

TITO

Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the

titty bar last night and said you

was choking brothers out. What's

up? Is it true?

STEPHON

Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really

work on some fools or something?

KC

You have to tell us.

BRENDAN

C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.

JOE ZITO

Are you being literal or

figurative? Because literally it

looks bad. And figuratively it

looks even worse. The

superintendent's coming by in a few

minutes. So gimme a little help

here, Brendan. Can you explain to

me what the hell you were doing?

BRENDAN

I need the money, Joe.

JOE ZITO

Yeah, but we can't have this. This

isn't moonlighting at Applebee's

for Christ's sake.

JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

Shit, Brendan. Leaving everything

else aside, which we can't, are you

out of your mind? You're gonna get

yourself killed. I mean, you're a

goddamn teacher.

(MORE)

27.

JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

You've got no business in the ring

with those animals.

BRENDAN

Actually, I used to be one of those

animals.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

I fought for a living.

(BEAT)

Guess I forgot to put that down on

my application.

JOE ZITO

Yeah, I guess you did.

BRENDAN

Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--

JOE ZITO

Listen, the school district's not

going to tolerate school teachers

cockfighting in strip clubs.

BRENDAN

It was the parking lot of a strip

club.

JOE ZITO

Wherever it was, you can't be doing

it, alright? I mean this is a

serious--shit, he's here.

JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

This is a serious problem.

(BEAT)

Guy hasn't been inside a school

since 9-11.

BRENDAN

What are we gonna do?

JOE ZITO

You say yes, sir. And you say no,

sir. And you say it'll never happen

again, sir. And then we just pray

to God he's in a good mood.

28.

JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

UFC?

JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

Sonofabitch.

TESS

What are you doing?

BRENDAN

(OFF PIANO)

The girls have an important piano

recital in the morning. Got an

equipment malfunction.

(BEAT)

How'd it go?

TESS

They're gonna review your case at

the end of the semester, but until

then you're suspended without pay.

Joe gave me the number of his

attorney.

BRENDAN

How the hell are we gonna pay for

an attorney?

TESS

He talked to me for free. As a

favor to Joe.

BRENDAN

That was nice.

29.

TESS

He said there's no precedent for

this. You'll be back by next

semester.

BRENDAN

Next semester?

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Look, Tess. They have these smoker

fights all over. There's one in

Lancaster next week. There's two in

Dover the week after. Wilmington.

Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us

afloat.

TESS

You're gonna put yourself through

this over and over, for five

hundred bucks a pop?

BRENDAN

Some of them pay a little more than

that.

(BEAT)

I would have had to bounce for a

month to make what I made in two

hours last night.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

And these guys, they're not real

fighters. They're just guys who

have seen too much UFC on TV. If

you have a better solution, I'm all

ears.

TESS

What are we gonna tell the girls?

BRENDAN

It'll be fine. I'll just leave the

house as usual, except now I'll be

going to the gym.

30.

PADDY

(SINGING)

Oh the duck says quack and the cow

says moo, and the old red rooster

says cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a-

doodle-doo.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Look what I found in that disaster

of a basement. Whattya say we sit

down and update this sometime? You

can fill me in on how close you got

to that record.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Did you continue wrestling after

you left with your mother?

(BEAT)

C'mon, Tommy. Tell me something.

TOMMY

Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You

can take that thing back to where

you found it. And you can leave the

coffee in the pot. I can pour that

myself. I can wake myself up, too.

PADDY

OK. Hurt my knees coming up and

down those stairs anyway.

(BEAT)

(MORE)

31.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Coffee pot's on til 0-500, then I

dump it.

MARINE #1

Damn dude, that's brutal.

BRADFORD

What's that?

MARINE #2

"Mad Dog" Grimes gettin' tuned up

by some dude in a gym in

Pittsburgh.

BRADFORD

Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?

MARINE #2

Shit, Bradford. The stuff you don't

know amazes me.

(OFF COMPUTER)

Oh my god, did you see that?

BRADFORD

Wait, rewind that.

32.

BRADFORD

AV, I need to see the tape!

AV

What tape?

BRADFORD

The tape.

BRADFORD

Freeze.

BRADFORD (CONT'D)

That's him. That's him.

FRANK

Let the music sink in to you. This

is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.

33.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Do I know you? I think I know you.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Long time, brother.

BRENDAN

Liking the place, Frank.

FRANK

Thank you, brother.

(off Brazilian fighter)

You see this beast? Marco Santos?

I'm training him for Sparta.

BRENDAN

Amazing, man.

FRANK

Come on back.

FRANK

You look good, brother. How're the

girls?

BRENDAN

Good. Good. I had another little

one. Rosie.

FRANK

I know. Johnny C. told me she was

in the hospital for a bit. I was

gonna call, but then time went by.

I don't know. I'm a piece of shit.

I should have called.

BRENDAN

It's alright.

FRANK

No, Brendan. I'm sorry.

34.

BRENDAN

It's all good. She's good now.

FRANK

It's great to see you, man. So

everything's going good?

BRENDAN

Yeah. Well, I've got a little

problem. The guys at the bank want

to take my house away. That's kind

of why I came to see you, actually.

FRANK

I've got most of my dough tied up

in this joint, but how much do you

need?

BRENDAN

I didn't come here for a loan,

Frank.

(BEAT)

I was hoping you'd train me.

FRANK

Train you for what?

BRENDAN

I want to get back in the cage.

FRANK

You're serious?

BRENDAN

I just won an event the other

night.

FRANK

Ah, you won an event.

(off bruised face)

That's what this is. Let me guess,

it was in a parking lot. DJ from

the local radio station. Couple of

ring card girls you wouldn't bang

on a dare. Am I right?

35.

BRENDAN

Ish.

FRANK

Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But

why would I train you? When you

were in shape and on the right side

of 30 you were barely a .500

fighter. You never listened to me.

You never listened to anyone. These

guys are animals. I mean, you're a

teacher, right? What're you gonna

do? You're gonna come down here for

a couple days a week after

detention? You're gonna skip out of

the girl's volleyball game early?

BRENDAN

I've got loads of time. Time's not

an issue. The parking lot thing

kinda got me suspended. I need to

keep working the smokers.

FRANK

Tess know about this?

(off Brendan's nod)

Yeah? `Cause the last time you

fought, I got read the riot act

sitting in a hospital waiting room.

You remember that?

BRENDAN

No. I was unconscious.

FRANK

She's not gonna come down here with

the two puppies, screaming at

Frank?

BRENDAN

It's not gonna happen. Come on.

Whattya say, Frank?

FRANK

What do I say? What am I gonna say

to you? No? I mean, all my time is

wrapped up with Marco. You come

down, I'll throw you in the

rotation, you spar with these guys,

no problem. But I can't promise you

much more than that, Brendan.

36.

BRENDAN

That's all I need.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

I appreciate it.

FRANK

Let me know when you're coming

down.

BRENDAN

(WALKING AWAY)

Well, I'm just gonna go get my

stuff from the car.

FRANK

Now?

PADDY

Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.

BRENDAN

What're you doing here?

PADDY

I have some news for you.

BRENDAN

Something wrong with your hands?

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

If there's nothing wrong with your

hands then there's no reason for

you not to phone. That's the deal.

37.

PADDY

Yeah, I forgot--

BRENDAN

Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

PADDY

Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my

hands so steady? Have you?

BRENDAN

I'm going inside.

PADDY

I've got a thousand days. A

thousand days sober today.

BRENDAN

Well, that's great, Pop. But it

doesn't change anything.

PADDY

What do you mean it doesn't change

anything? Have a heart, Brendan.

BRENDAN

You listen to me. You take your

have-a-heart bullshit and you run

it down the road. Run it out on

someone who doesn't know you like I

do.

PADDY

C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we

could break bread. Open some lines

of communication.

BRENDAN

You got two lines of communication,

the telephone and the post office.

Just because you decide it's a

special day, it doesn't make it one

for me. I got a wife and kids

inside and they're waiting for me,

so I don't have time for whatever

this is.

38.

PADDY

I know you got a wife and kids in

there. I got a grand-daughter I

haven't seen in three years and

another I haven't even ever met.

BRENDAN

Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do

you remember having anything to do

with that?

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

That shit you pulled. Never again.

And all the shit I saw growing up?

That doesn't happen here.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Take care of yourself.

PADDY

Tommy's back.

PADDY (CONT'D)

He's in the `Burgh.

BRENDAN

Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

PADDY

He came to see me.

BRENDAN

He came to see you?

PADDY

He's over at the house. We're doing

a little training at Fitzy's.

Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's

anymore.

BRENDAN

You and Tommy are training

together?

39.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Tommy Conlon.

PADDY

Riordan. He's using your mother's

maiden name now.

BRENDAN

I know what her name is.

PADDY

I thought you'd want to know he's

back. That's why I drove all the

way over here.

BRENDAN

I thought you came to break bread

over a thousand days?

PADDY

That too.

BRENDAN

Did he say if he wants to see me?

PADDY

He doesn't say much. He's just not

that happy kid he was.

BRENDAN

Wow, look at you. Mister inside

man.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

You and Tommy training together

like nothing ever happened. This is

unbelievable. Now I know what

you're really doing here.

PADDY

What's that?

BRENDAN

You came to gloat.

PADDY

I did not come to gloat. I came to

get my son back.

40.

BRENDAN

Well, there you go. You got your

son back.

PADDY

I'm talking about you, Bren--

BRENDAN

You got your son back.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

You know, part of the reason I

stuck around was `cause I thought

I'd finally get you all to myself.

But you didn't have any interest in

training me. Tommy was the one.

PADDY

Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,

you know. I'm sorry.

BRENDAN

Forget it. You were always a front

runner. You never had any interest

in underdogs. But I was your son.

PADDY

You are my son.

BRENDAN

Am I?

PADDY

Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you

to find just a little space in your

heart to forgive me.

BRENDAN

Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I

do not trust you. Tell Tommy this

is where I am if he wants to see

me.

PADDY

Alright. But they're not different

things. You've gotta trust to

FORGIVE--

BRENDAN

Goodnight, Pop.

41.

PADDY

My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's

grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?

ROSIE

Daddy, who is that?

BRENDAN

Just some nice old man.

JON ANIK

Huge news breaking here at ESPN.

Koba is coming to America and will

fight at Sparta. Universally

considered to be the greatest pound

for pound fighter that ever lived,

the mighty, mythical Russian has

never fought on U.S. soil in his

legendary career...

COLT BOYD

Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got

you into Sparta. Took some doing,

but I made it happen..

(off no reaction from Tommy)

Thank you and 10 percent is

customary.

42.

PILAR

Bueno?

TOMMY

Pilar. It's Tommy.

PILAR

Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe

it! How are you?

TOMMY

Good good. How you doin'?

PILAR

OK. You know me, Tommy.

(BEAT)

I was getting really worried about

you.

TOMMY

How're things? Kids are good?

PILAR

They're good. Maria's getting so

big. She looks more like Manny

every day.

TOMMY

How's little man?

43.

PILAR

He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

Takes care of his sister. He's a

great kid. Everyone's good.

TOMMY

You know, Pilar, I haven't

forgotten for one minute what I

promised you. What I promised

Manny. I've got an opportunity

coming up to help you guys out. To

take care of you guys.

PILAR

Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know

Manny would really appreciate it.

You worry too much. It's OK. We're

hanging in there.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)

With eight weeks left til Sparta,

J.J. Riley and the TapOut crew take

time out of their international

press tour to join us.

(MORE)

44.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)

J.J., we've never seen this kind of

Grand Prix tournament in the

country before. Tell us, why the

unique format?

J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)

Well, Jon, you know as well as

anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts,

anyone can beat anyone on a given

night...

J.J. RILEY (V.O.)

...but with this type of format,

it's gonna be tough to deny who the

champion is.

J.J. RILEY (V.O.)

You've got four fights in two

nights, sixteen fighters down to

one. Winners gonna be the last man

standing.

45.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)

Only five weeks left `til Sparta

and the hype continues for the War

on the Shore. Fourth of July

weekend in Atlantic City and you

know what that means: the great

Koba, bringing his act stateside.

Let me ask you about the other

guys. What are they thinking

entering a winner take all

tournament against a guy that

seemingly can't be beat?

RASHOD EVANS (ON SCREEN)

They're thinking five million

dollars, and five million dollars

is a lot of money, but they've

gotta remember one thing: they're

going against Koba. Mission

impossible. Game over. Go home.

46.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)

The `Pittsburgh Beatdown' has

become one of the most watched

videos on YouTube this year. Now

joining us via satellite is the

victim of the infamous incident,

Mad Dog Grimes. Mad Dog, what is

your response to all the hoopla

surrounding the video and Tommy

Riordan?

MAD DOG (ON SCREEN)

This guy's a nobody. It was just a

sparring session. It is what it is,

and he's gonna pay for it next

month in Atlantic City.

JON ANIK (V.O.)

With Sparta now only two short

weeks away, J.J. Riley and the

TapOut crew returned to the U.S.

after a world tour that saw them

visit ten fighters in ten different

countries.

47.

JON ANIK (V.O.)

They stopped in Philadelphia today

to check in on renowned trainer

Frank Campana and top contender

Marco Santos.

FRANK (V.O.)

You've gotta relax and stay calm in

there. The cage is your home. You

set the pace.

FRANK (V.O.)

You set the rhythm. Feel the

Beethoven. Be smarter than him.

More patient. Wait for him to make

a mistake. And when he does, that's

your moment.

FRANK

No he did not tap you! Physics

teacher! That's the best in the

world there, son.

48.

BRENDAN

You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?

FRANK

Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta

call the boys and break the news.

I'll call you tomorrow.

BRENDAN

Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a

great time. And it's too bad about

Marco. But what about me?

FRANK

You talking about Sparta? Brendan,

please. You got a better chance of

starting a boy band. I'll talk to

you tomorrow.

BRENDAN

It's a grand prix tournament. Which

means anything can happen. You know

that as well as I do.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

They'll have to kill me to get me

out of that cage.

FRANK

That's what I'm afraid of.

BRENDAN

Frank, I need this. You're real

tight with those guys. You call

them, they'll listen to you.

49.

FRANK

You realize what you're asking me

to do here, Brendan? We go down to

AC and you get tapped out in five

seconds, how does that benefit

either one of us?

BRENDAN

That's not gonna happen.

FRANK

Not gonna happen. Wish I had a

nickel for every time I heard that.

BRENDAN

(SMILING)

It's not gonna happen.

FRANK

I'll make a call.

BRENDAN

I love my coach!

TESS (INTO PHONE)

Yeah, the girls are good. They're

good. Yeah, you should. You've been

spending so much time with Brendan

these days it's like you're part of

the family or something. Yeah, he's

right here.

(handing phone to Brendan)

It's your boyfriend.

BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)

Hey Frank.

(BEAT)

That's unbelievable. I can't thank

you enough. I don't know what to

say. Alright, listen, I've gotta

call you back. Alright, bye.

50.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

I'm in. I'm going.

TESS

Really? So that's your decision?

You decided? `Cause I really

enjoyed that conversation we just

had about making that decision

together.

TESS (CONT'D)

You told me you were gonna fight

guys that watched too much UFC. I

saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's

the guy they're watching.

BRENDAN

It's a lot of money, Tess.

TESS

I don't give a shit about the

money, Brendan. I told you that.

We're gonna end up cashing in your

life insurance policy before we

pick up that prize money.

BRENDAN

You don't think I can do it.

TESS

I think you can get killed.

BRENDAN

I'm not gonna get killed.

TESS

Fine, you're not going to get

killed. But can you promise me

you're not going to get hurt?

You're not gonna end up in the

hospital? You're not gonna end up

paralyzed? We'll have no prize

money. No house. Payments for

HOSPITAL BILLS--

51.

BRENDAN

Tess, I can promise you this: if I

don't try, they're gonna take the

house. How's that for a promise?

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd

really love it if you'd be with me

on this.

TESS

I'm not gonna watch you fight

again. I'm not.

(BEAT)

I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Fourth of July weekend doesn't

officially start until tomorrow...

CALLEN (V.O.)

...but fight fans are already

descending on Atlantic City for the

Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts,

Sparta.

52.

CALLEN

J.J., you've made a fortune with

your hedge funds, yet you turned

your back on Wall Street and

dedicated your life to making

Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this

tournament so important to you?

J.J. RILEY

Growing up, we all wanted to know

who the toughest kid in the

neighborhood was, right? I wanna

know who the toughest man on the

planet is. That's why I put this

together, that's what all these

people are here to see, and come

Saturday night, that's what we're

gonna find out.

SHERIDAN

Thank you, J.J. And here's

something fans never thought they'd

see: Koba is here! The legend

arriving to fight on U.S. soil for

the very first time...

53.

FRANK

Hey. Where'd you go? You can't

leave me like that. They wanna talk

to you, not me.

MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN)

...the only fighter missing from

the event was dark horse entry

Tommy Riordan.

MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)

Recent revelations that Riordan

was not only a United States Marine

but a hero in the Iraq War, has

cast an even brighter spotlight on

a fighter who seems to have come

out of nowhere.

(MORE)

54.

MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)

Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's web

testimony to Riordan, who saved his

life earlier this year in Iraq, is

spreading like wildfire throughout

the media.

PADDY

Tommy!

BRADFORD (ON SCREEN)

...the bridge just crumbled. The

Amtrack was upside down. Water was

coming in from everywhere. The

water pressure was too much. We

couldn't get the back hatch open.

BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)

We were all drowning, man. It was a

death trap.

BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)

I couldn't have had more than

another minute. Suddenly the back

ramp gets ripped off, and there he

was. Before I could get out and

thank him, he was gone. He just

vanished like a ghost.

TOMMY

I'm takin' a walk.

BRADFORD (ON SCREEN)

You saved my life, brother. Anybody

seeing this at Sparta, anybody out

in Pittsburgh, reach out to Tommy

Riordan. Tell him Mark said thank

you.

55.

MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN)

Footage taken from a helmet camera

on the ground captured the heroic

incident...

PADDY (INTO PHONE)

Hello?

(BEAT)

Brendan.

BRENDAN

Been looking all over for you.

How's it going?

TOMMY

It's going.

BRENDAN

I was thinking maybe we could grab

a coffee.

TOMMY

I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?

BRENDAN

You don't want to go sit down

somewhere?

TOMMY

I'm good right here.

56.

BRENDAN

Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to

know I was never gonna see you guys

again?

TOMMY

You were briefed. You had the

information. You chose the old man

and the girl.

BRENDAN

She wasn't some girl. I married

her. She's my wife.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

(handing Tommy the picture)

That's Tess. And that's Emily and

Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.

TOMMY

Don't know `em.

BRENDAN

I know you don't know them. Of

course you don't know them.

TOMMY

Why am I looking at pictures of

people I don't know?

BRENDAN

Because that's my family.

TOMMY

And who are you exactly?

BRENDAN

I'm your brother, man.

TOMMY

You were in the Corps?

BRENDAN

What?

57.

TOMMY

I said I didn't know you were in

the Corps.

BRENDAN

I wasn't in the Corps.

TOMMY

Then you ain't no brother to me. My

brother was in the Corps.

BRENDAN

Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old

kid. What the hell did I know?

TOMMY

I don't know what you know. Why

don't you go ask your girlfriend

about it?

BRENDAN

She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it?

I stay with Tess and I never get to

see you guys again? Not a single

phone call? Nothing?

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

God, man, I don't understand this.

You won't forgive me, but you'll

forgive Pop?

TOMMY

Shit. He's just some old vet I

train with. He means nothing to me.

From what I hear he means nothing

to you, either, so you got balls

talking about forgiveness.

BRENDAN

That's got nothing to do with

forgiveness. I've got a family to

protect. Everything I do is for

them.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

But I forgave Pop. Just like I

forgave you and Mom.

58.

TOMMY

(TURNING AROUND)

You forgave us?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

TOMMY

I'm not surprised you made the

tournament, Brendan. You got some

stones.

BRENDAN

I fell in love, Tommy. What the

hell was I supposed to do?

TOMMY

You were supposed to stick to the

plan. You were supposed to come

with us. Mom needed you. I needed

you. You were my big brother and

you bailed on me.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Hey, I'm glad you stayed and

everything worked out for you,

Brendan. See, you leave, you get

the opposite. You leave, you get to

bury people.

BRENDAN

You're not the only one who

suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know

she was sick. I never even got the

chance to say goodbye to my own

mother. You had no right to keep

that from me! That was not your

decision to make!

TOMMY

You know what? You walk around with

your pictures in your wallet and

you're all, I forgive you, I

forgive Pop. I forgive everyone.

But you know what? You're full of

shit.

59.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Are we done, Brendan? Are we

finished?

JOE ZITO

You realize you're supposed to seek

my wise counsel when school's

actually in session, right?

STEPHON

We want to use the auditorium this

weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

TITO

What do you say?

JOE ZITO

Let me get this straight. You want

to use the auditorium to watch a

suspended teacher engage in the

activity he was suspended for? Am I

hearing this correctly?

(BEAT)

I gotta talk to your parents. You

guys might need to be in summer

school after all.

NASH

But everyone wants to see it.

60.

KC

The gym's the only place that's big

enough.

JOE ZITO

It's never gonna happen.

STEPHON

What if we get a petition?

TITO

Yeah. We'll get the whole school to

sign it.

NASH

The power of democracy!

JOE ZITO

Look, I appreciate that you guys

love your teacher. I really do. But

there is nothing I can do for you.

CALLEN (V.O.)

The roof is about to blow clean off

Boardwalk Hall Arena! It might be

Fourth of July weekend, but this is

Christmas Eve for fight fans! This

is Atlantic City! This is the War

on the Shore! And this is what

everyone has been waiting for!

61.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Sixteen of the baddest men on the

planet duking it out over a 24-hour

period for the largest purse in

Mixed Martial Arts history. In the

town everyone knows from the game

of Monopoly, we've got ourselves a

winner-take-all affair. Buckle your

seatbelts, roll the dice, and take

riiiiide on the Reading. Sparta.

Is. Here!

CALLEN

Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along

with best-selling fight author Sam

Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley

conceived Sparta he wanted to

create, quite simply, the biggest

Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in

history.

SHERIDAN

Five million dollars, Bryan. Five

million dollars. J.J. Riley put his

money where his mouth is and put up

the biggest purse this sport has

ever seen.

CALLEN

It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the

hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan,

the war hero who has become an

overnight sensation...

OFFICIAL

Five minutes, Paddy.

62.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

It looks as though the moment of

truth has arrived, because here

comes Tommy Riordan.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy Riordan's captured the

media's attention, but the question

still remains: who is this guy? And

more importantly, can he compete in

this talent pool? Can he win?

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew

who he was, and I've gotta say the

fact that I don't know is strange.

In an internet age where there are

no secrets, this guy is a complete

mystery. I can't find out anything

about him. Tommy Riordan is

officially Google proof.

CALLEN (V.O.)

You gotta love this guy, Sam. No

walk out music, no sponsors, no

interviews. He skipped out on the

press conference. Wouldn't have his

picture take for the program. He's

breaking every rule!

63.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

The only reason that Tommy is even

in this tournament is because of a

video showing him beating up Mad

Dog Grimes in the gym.

CALLEN (V.O.)

But the reason a lot of his fans

are in the stands is because of

another video, which is even more

stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes

video. Let me describe it for you

folks for the few who haven't seen

it, and I don't know anyone who

hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped

the door off a tank in the heat of

battle, saving lives in the

process, and then walked away

without claiming a medal. He ripped

the door off a tank!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Tommy Riordan is a genuine war

hero, I'm not taking anything away

from the guy. He's a very, very

tough guy, Bryan, but the tank

don't hit back. We've seen YouTube

sensations fail on the big stage

before.

CALLEN

Sam. He ripped the door off a tank!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy Riordan definitely has his

hands full in his first opponent,

Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is

nothing to scoff at.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Yeah, he's the real deal. Very

tough guy. Very high caliber

fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of

nowhere, and I imagine he's going

to disappear just as quickly.

(MORE)

64.

SHERIDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Great story, but I think your boy

is about to be exposed as a YouTube

sensation.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, you've been given your

instructions. I expect a clean

fight. Obey my commands at all

times. Defend yourselves at all

times. Touch gloves, go back, let's

do this.

CALLEN (V.O.)

We're about to get the big answer

to the big question: is Tommy

Riordan for real? And here we go!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Barbosa's gonna be looking for a

take down.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Definitely gonna be looking for a

take down.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been

knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most

definitely for real!

65.

CALLEN (V.O.)

And now he's walking out of the

cage! He's leaving the cage! There

goes another rule out the window!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and

he is out of this tournament,

Bryan.

OFFICIAL

Show time.

FRANK

You can do this.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I want to hear you say it.

BRENDAN

I can do this.

FRANK

Then let's go do this.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours

to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he

basically had to rely on the word

of Frank Campana.

66.

CALLEN (V.O.)

And he chose Brendan Conlon, which

quite frankly is something I just

don't understand.

PADDY

Go get `em, son.

CALLEN (V.O.)

I can understand coming out to no

music, by why in the world would

you choose classical music for your

entrance?

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

This is Beethoven, Bryan. This is

Ode to Joy.

CALLEN (V.O.)

My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

You want to talk about renaissance

men, you gotta talk about Frank

Campana. Very unorthodox trainer,

and one of the best in the game.

He's well known for using classical

music to train his fighters to

remain calm, to remain patient, and

to remain composed under pressure.

CALLEN

Classical music is about as fitting

to this setting as Brendan Conlon

is to this tournament. In fact, let

me show you something.

67.

CALLEN (CONT'D)

This is Brendan Conlon. He's a

feeder fish, and he's about to get

dropped into a shark tank.

SHERIDAN

C'mon, give the guy a break. At

least we've seen him fight before.

He was in the UFC. We remember him.

CALLEN

I remember him, too. I remember him

being very unmemorable.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Midnight Le getting ready to climb

into the cage and go to work.

CALLEN (V.O.)

When the brackets were announced,

Midnight thought he'd be going up

against Marco Santos. He's gotta be

thrilled to be seeing Brendan

Conlon standing across from him.

FRANK

You asked for it.

68.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Brendan retired from fighting some

years ago, he's actually a high

school Physics teacher now, and

Midnight had some fun with that at

the press conference.

CALLEN (V.O.)

He said he was gonna give the

teacher a serious lesson, and that

getting killed was no way to spend

a summer vacation.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Alright, gentleman, you've been

given your instructions, I expect a

clean fight. Obey my commands at

all times. Defend yourselves at all

times. Touch gloves, go back, let's

do this.

FRANK

Have some fun, baby.

ZITO

Move! You gotta move!

69.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Midnight is all over Brendan.

CALLEN (V.O.)

This can't last much longer. This

won't last much longer. The teacher

just has no answers.

ZITO

C'mon, Brendan, get outta there!

FRANK

Get out of there! Get out of there!

CALLEN (V.O.)

And now he's got the hooks in. 20

seconds left.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

The end is near. Can he make it to

the end of the round is the

question.

70.

CALLEN (V.O.)

10 seconds left, and Brendan's face

is turning purple. Conlon's whole

world is about to go from day to

night.

FRANK

Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't

know what hit him!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

He's got a Kimura locked in.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Are you kidding me?

71.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Midnight is in big trouble!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

I don't think he's got anywhere to

go!

CALLEN (V.O.)

This isn't happening! This can't

happen!

SHERIDAN

It just did, Bryan.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight! I

can't believe it!

ZITO

He tapped him out! He tapped him

out! He did it! He did it! He did

it!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

This is what makes Mixed Martial

Arts so great. There's so many ways

to lose. One tiny miscalculation at

any time and that's it.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Frank Campana embracing his man,

Brendan Conlon. I don't think

either one of them can believe what

just happened.

72.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Great show of sportsmanship from

the teacher.

CALLEN (V.O.)

That's a hallmark of Frank

Campana's philosophy right there.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Midnight Le is shocked. He thought

he had a free pass into the second

round, but instead he's going home.

He dominated the fight the entire

way, but fell prey to a very

technical finish.

CALLEN

Very technical finish, but come on,

that's a fluke.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

You call it a fluke. I call it a

guy maintaining composure and

waiting for his opportunity.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Conlon beats Midnight!

SHERIDAN

I hope you got a receipt for your

goldfish.

TESS

Yes!

73.

CALLEN (V.O.)

We're down to eight fighters, soon

to be seven as Koba prepares to go

to work for the second time

tonight.

CALLEN (V.O.)

That was quick.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Wow. Once again, Koba does not

break a sweat.

CALLEN (V.O.)

I'm afraid he might have broken

something else, Sam.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

It's certainly possible, Bryan.

Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

74.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Mad Dog fighting like a man

possessed. Like a man with

something to prove.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Mad Dog said he had a message for

Tommy Riordan and there it is right

there.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Here comes the underdog, Brendan

Conlon.

CALLEN (V.O.)

The teacher miraculously passed his

first test, but now he's gotta face

The Dane.

PADDY

You can do it, Brendan.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Halfway through round three now and

the beating continues.

CALLEN (V.O.)

I honestly don't know how Brendan

Conlon is still standing, Sam.

(MORE)

75.

CALLEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He has been absolutely battered in

both his fights tonight.

FRANK

Take him down!

PADDY

That's it, Brendan!

76.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Do it one time, it's a fluke, do it

twice, that's something else!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Pull the bandwagon over, I think

I'm hopping on! I think I'm a

believer!

PADDY

Way to go, Brendan!

BRENDAN

I'd doing this!

PADDY

OK, son.

BRENDAN

I'm doing it!

CALLEN (V.O.)

The crowd catching fire for war

hero Tommy Riordan.

77.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

He doesn't seem to want anything to

do with all this adulation, Bryan.

He's just here to fight.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?

Let's go to war!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Here he comes again like a buzzsaw.

Tommy is all over Diego Santana!

CALLEN (V.O.)

There he goes again! Storming right

out of the cage!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy Riordan marching through the

crowd, and straight into the final

four!

78.

PADDY

Can't sleep, huh?

PADDY (CONT'D)

I know that other thing's bothering

the hell out of you, but I'm proud

of you. What you did for that kid

in the tank? That was really

something.

TOMMY

How about deserting my unit? Is

that really something, too? Yeah. I

was on my way outta country when I

came across those guys. What was I

supposed to do, let `em drown?

PADDY

No.

(BEAT)

What'd you do?

TOMMY

What'd I do? I took off.

PADDY

That's why you go by Riordan.

That's why the press can't find

your service records.

79.

PADDY (CONT'D)

What the hell happened over there,

Tommy?

TOMMY

That is none of your business.

PADDY

Come on, kiddo. I've been there.

I've done it. I've seen it. You can

trust me. I'll understand.

TOMMY

Spare me the compassionate father

routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.

PADDY

I'm really trying here, Tommy.

TOMMY

You're trying? Now? Where were you

when it mattered? I needed this guy

back when I was a kid. I don't need

you now. It's too late now.

Everything's already happened. You

and Brendan don't seem to

understand that. Let me explain

something to you: the only thing I

have in common with Brendan Conlon

is that we have absolutely no use

for you.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I

think I liked you better when you

were a drunk. At least you had some

balls then. Not like now. Tip

toeing around like some beggar with

your cup out. Take it somewhere

else, old man.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

In fact, you know what? Here's a

cup. Why don't you take this and go

buy some more of your shitty tapes?

(MORE)

80.

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Go back to the room and listen to

some more fish stories no one gives

a shit about. Go on, get outta

here.

(BEAT)

Get the fuck outta here!

PADDY

God pity `em! All shall perish

except me! You bastards! Stop the

ship, you bastards!

PADDY (CONT'D)

Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the

ship! Please stop the ship!

Somebody help `em!

PADDY (CONT'D)

Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!

PADDY (CONT'D)

You stop the ship, you Godless

sonofabitch!

81.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship.

For the love of God. We're lost.

PADDY (CONT'D)

Please stop the ship.

PADDY (CONT'D)

We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy.

We'll never make it back.

PADDY (CONT'D)

(MUMBLING)

I always loved you. You know that,

don't you Tommy? I always loved

you. You and your brother. My two

boys.

82.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy Riordan, coming down the

tunnel without his trainer.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Once again, no walk out music.

CALLEN (V.O.)

I wouldn't say no walk out music,

Sam. Listen to this.

MARINES

(SINGING)

From the halls of Montezuma to the

shores of Tripoli, we will fight

our country's battles in the air,

on land, and sea...

SHERIDAN

It sounds like VJ Day in Times

Square, Bryan. I've never seen

anything like it!

83.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy acknowledging his comrades

for the first time, and climbing

into the cage.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for

revenge ever since the day Tommy

Riordan walked into his gym in

Pittsburgh and turned his life

upside down.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

It's been a very long, very

miserable few months for Mad Dog to

say the least.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a

camouflage motif for his mohawk

tonight and the Marines are really

letting Mad Dog have it.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Alright gentlemen, you've been

given your instructions. I expect a

clean fight. Obey my commands at

all times. Defend yourselves at all

times. Touch gloves, go back, let's

do this.

84.

MAD DOG

It's not gonna happen again.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Mad Dog predicted an early

knockout. Said he was gonna knock

Tommy out with one punch.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Let's see what Tommy has to say

about that.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?

Let's go to war!

CALLEN (V.O.)

And they are off!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Tommy tackles him and he's on top!

He's raining blows!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Someone has to stop this.

COLT BOYD

Stop it! Stop the fight!

CALLEN (V.O.)

That's the fastest knockout I think

I've ever seen.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.

He is not moving.

85.

CALLEN (V.O.)

I'll tell you what: you do that to

someone on the street and they'd

lock you up and throw away the key!

Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

Tommy's walking away from the cage

like he's leaving a crime scene.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Brendan Conlon came into this

tournament as a 1000 to 1 underdog,

and now here he is in the final

four. The crowd's showing their

appreciation. They're giving him

quite the reception.

CALLEN (V.O.)

He's getting a huge reception. I

mean, this guy shocked everybody

last night.

86.

FRANK

You've got a visitor. Second row,

10 o'clock.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You alright with that?

CALLEN (V.O.)

And here comes the great Russian

Koba.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Koba is so intimidating. His

reputation is larger than life.

FRANK

I want you to look right at him

when he comes in here. Don't take

your eyes off him.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'm proud of you brother. This is

your cage.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Alright, gentlemen, you've been

given your instructions. I expect a

clean fight.

(MORE)

87.

JOSH ROSENTHAL (CONT'D)

Obey my commands at all times.

Defend yourselves at all times.

Touch gloves, go back, let's do

this.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Should I be nervous for Brendan?

`Cause I am. I want to stop the

fight before it even begins.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?

Let's go to war!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Now the question is, how long can

Brendan Conlon stay alive?

CALLEN (V.O.)

Koba just pounding on Brendan

Conlon! He's pounding on him like a

side of beef!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Koba's got him in the air. Oh no!

88.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Frank Campana has to think

seriously about stopping this.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Seriously, Sam. How much abuse can

one man take?

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Let's go to war!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!

CALLEN (V.O.)

That one shook the entire building!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Everyone has gotta be concerned

about Brendan Conlon's bravery

getting him into trouble here.

CALLEN (V.O.)

His bravery can get him killed,

Sam. He's got nothing more to

prove. He's already lasted two

rounds against Koba, which is more

than anyone else can say. You

wonder what's keeping this guy up.

89.

FRANK

Sit down. Breathe.

(grabbing Brendan's face)

Look at me! Look at me! Why are we

here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are

we here to win this fight? You tell

me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw

in the towel right now. We'll get

Tess and we will go home. You don't

knock him out, you lose the fight.

Understand me? You don't knock him

out, you don't have a home.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Let's go to war!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Conlon somehow answering the bell

for round three, but Koba's all

over him again.

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There

are signs of life in Brendan

Conlon. He's starting to mix it up!

90.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Koba's got him caught in an iron

vice, squeezing for all it's worth

and trying to choke the teacher

out.

CALLEN (V.O.)

He just launched Koba! Can you

believe this? Conlon just shook off

a guillotine!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Conlon's staying after him! He's

squeezing him! The tables have

turned, and the boy scout is

squeezing the bear!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Conlon standing and trading with

the Russian! I've never seen this!

CALLEN (V.O.)

This is a fight! We've got

ourselves a fight!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Conlon going for a knee bar! He's

got it very deep!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

He's deep on that knee bar!

91.

FRANK

Crank it! Crank it!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Brendan Conlon wrenching that knee

for all it's worth! He's putting

everything he has in it, and Koba

is screaming in pain!

CALLEN (V.O.)

He did it! Brendan Conlon has

tapped Koba! I can't believe it! He

can't believe it! Frank Campana

can't believe it! This whole place

can't believe it!

CALLEN (V.O.)

That's gotta be the biggest upset

in MMA history! Brendan Conlon has

tapped the great Koba!

CALLEN (V.O.)

Brendan Conlon, the Physics

teacher! Brendan Conlon, the

civilian! He's done the impossible!

He's pulled off a miracle! This

place is going crazy `cause we've

just seen a miracle!

92.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

This is CNN breaking news...

DON LEMON (ON SCREEN)

A surprising turn in the story of

Iraq War hero Tommy Riordan. CNN

has learned that Riordan's true

identity is that of Marine Staff

Sergeant Thomas Conlon, who went

AWOL from his unit earlier this

year following the friendly fire

death of his brother-in-arms,

Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

Fernandez' wife, Pilar Fernandez,

spoke with me in an exclusive

interview moments ago.

PILAR (ON SCREEN)

Bombs started dropping. They were

coming from U.S. planes. Tommy and

Manny were waving their flags to

let them know they were Americans,

but they didn't stop. Everyone

died. Everyone except Tommy.

(BEAT)

You know, my Manny used to say

Tommy was the brother he never had.

93.

DON LEMON (V.O.)

Conlon, who is fighting in the

Mixed Martial Arts mega tournament

Sparta, is expected to be taken

into custody by military police

following tonight's winner take all

finale in Atlantic City.

DON LEMON (V.O.)

If victorious, he has pledged his

five million dollar purse to the

widow of his fallen comrade.

CALLEN (ON SCREEN)

We've just got some incredible news

that I'm having trouble putting

into context, but here it is: the

two men fighting for the

championship tonight, for the five

million dollar prize, for the

middle weight championship of the

world, are brothers.

94.

TESS

(TO BRENDAN)

What are you gonna do?

BRENDAN

I'm gonna fight him.

95.

FRANK

One more time.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, this is the final. Five

rounds. I expect a clean fight.

Obey my commands at all times.

Defend yourselves at all times.

Touch gloves, go back, let's do

this.

BRENDAN

Where's Pop?

96.

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you

ready? Let's go to war!

TESS

What was that!

FRANK

C'mon, Josh!

FRANK (CONT'D)

Sit down. Look at me. Look at me,

Brendan! Let it go! Breathe.

(MORE)

97.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Beethoven. He's coming hard, just

like we planned. I want you to

angle out, hit, and move.

BRENDAN

Angle out, hit, and move.

FRANK

Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your

brother, right? He's just a guy

who's in the way.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'm taking a little more time for

the cheap shot! Do your job, Josh!

98.

CALLEN (V.O.)

Here we go, Mom! Time to lock up

your china, the boys are at it

again!

FRANK

Switch! Switch!

SHERIDAN (V.O.)

Oh my God, that's a deep omoplata!

CALLEN (V.O.)

He's doing it again! Conlon's doing

it again! This is going to be over!

BRENDAN

Tap, Tommy!

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Tap!

99.

BRENDAN

I popped his shoulder.

FRANK

Relax, breathe.

BRENDAN

I heard it tear.

FRANK

You popped his shoulder? Good. I

want you to pop his other shoulder.

BRENDAN

Josh!

100.

FRANK

Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You

got two rounds left! You need both

rounds! Go in there, kick him in

the head, take him down, and finish

him!

BRENDAN

Tommy! What are you doing?

TOMMY

Shut up! C'mon.

BRENDAN

What are you that crazy?

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Let's go to war!

BRENDAN

What are you doing? It's over!

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't

have to do this.

101.

FRANK

Finish him! You finish him!

JOSH ROSENTHAL

Break! Break!

102.

BRENDAN

I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

Tap, Tommy! Tap!

BRENDAN (CONT'D)

I love you, Tommy! I love you!

103.

THE END
