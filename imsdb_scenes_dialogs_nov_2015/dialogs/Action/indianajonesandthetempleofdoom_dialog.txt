SHANGHAI - 1935

LAO

Dr. Jones.

INDIANA

Lao She.

LAO

Nee chin lie how ma?

INDIANA

Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey

hung jing chee jah loo nee kao

soo wah shu shu.

LAO

You never told me you spoke my

language, Dr. Jones.

INDIANA

I don't like to show off.

LAO

For this special occasion, I

ordered champagne and caviar.

LAO

So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you

found Nurhachi?

INDIANA

Sure, I found him.  Then last

night I had a little trouble.

Somebody tried to slit my throat.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

It was dark, but I think one of

your sons tried to get Nurhachi

without paying for him.

LAO

You have insulted my son.

INDIANA

Next time I'll cut off more than

his finger.

LAO

Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

INDIANA

As I recall the deal was consid-

erably more.

WILLIE

(to Lao)

Aren't you going to introduce

us?

LAO

This is Willie Scott.

(watching Indy)

And this is Indiana Jones, the

famous archaeologist.

LAO (Cont'd)

Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me

and is about to deliver him --

now.

WILLIE

Well -- I thought archaeologists

were always funny little men

searching for their mummies --

(yelping)

Aaahhh!

WILLE (Cont'd)

I was only kidding, can't you

take a joke -- ?

(to Lao)

Lao, he's got a knife!

INDIANA

Put the gun away, sonny.

INDIANA

Now I suggest you pay me what you

promised -- or your girlfriend

here is going to be squealing a

new tune.

INDIANA

Try again Lao -- the deal was

more.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

Bingo...you see, Lao, with a

but of persuasion, even you can

be an honest fellow.

WILLIE

Look at this!  He put a hole

in my dress from Paris!

LAO

Sit down!

LAO (Cont'd)

To your health, Dr. Jones.

INDIANA

What's that?

LAO

A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is

poison.  You just drank the

rest of it.

LAO (Cont'd)

There is an antidote for this

poison.  You give me Nurhachi --

I give you the antidote.

LAO (Cont'd)

The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.

Where is Nurhachi?

WILLIE

(nervously)

This Nurhachi's a very small guy.

INDIANA

Inside are the remains of Nur-

hachi -- the first Emperor of the

Manchu Dynasty.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

Now what about the antidote,

Lao.

LAO

(holding the box)

At last I have the ashes of my

sacred ancestor!

WILLIE

So, what's the big deal?  Let

me see it --

LAO

You fool!

WILLIE

Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-

able little hood!

INDIANA

Let go of her, Lao.  And give me

the antidote.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

(smiling at Wu Han)

I like the service here.

WILLIE

(puzzled)

Hey, he's not a waiter...

INDIANA

No, Wu Han's an old friend I

brought along.

(to Lao)

So, the game's not over. Put

the antidote on the table, Lao.

INDIANA

Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm

going to get you out of here.

WU HAN

Not this time, my friend...

(smiling bravely)

I followed you on many adventures --

but into the great Unknown Mystery,

I go first, Indy...

LAO

Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you

will soon join him.

INDIANA

The antidote -- !

INDIANA

Look out, damn it, I need that

antidote!

WILLIE

Who cares?  Where's that diamond!

WILLIE

(acidly polite)

Excuse me, but I believe that's

my diamond!

WILLIE

Aw nuts!

INDIANA (O.S.)

Hey,doll!  Don't move!

INDIANA (Cont'd)

(shouting to Willie)

Hey, don't go away!  I need that!

INDIANA (Cont'd)

If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...

Somehow I think you've got bigger

problems.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

a lion tamer?

INDIANA

Since I was nice enough to let

you tag along, why don't you give

your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll?

(to Indiana)

What'd he say?

INDIANA

He told me they knew I was coming

here.

WILLIE

What do you mean -- how?

INDIANA

The old man saw it in a dream.

WILLIE

Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

INDIANA

He said that's whey they were at

river -- they were waiting for

the plane to fall down.

WILLIE

(quietly to Indy)

I hope this means we're going to

get some dinner.

WILLIE

(quietly)

God, I am starving, but I can't

eat this...

INDIANA

That's more food than these people

eat in a week.

(pointedly)

They're starving, too...

WILLIE

I'm sorry, I -- here, please.

CHIEFTAIN

You will rest here before you go

on.

INDIANA

We'd appreciate that.  This was an

unexpected detour.  We'll have to go

to Delhi now and find a flight west.

SHORT ROUND

(smiling)

Indy is taking me to America.

INDIANA

I'm a professor.  I have to re-

turn to the university.  Can you

give us a guide to take us to Delhi?

CHIEFTAIN

Sanju will guide you.

INDIANA

Thank you.

SHAMAN

On the way to Delhi, you will

stop at Pankot.

INDIANA

(puzzled)

Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

SHAMAN

You will go to palace there.

INDIANA

Hasn't the Pankot palace been de-

serted since the Mutiny of 1857?

SHAMAN

(darkly)

No. Now there is new Maharajah --

and palace is powerful again.

SHAMAN (Cont'd)

It is Pankot Palace that kills my

village.

INDIANA

I don't understand.  What's hap-

pened here?

SHAMAN

The evil starts in Pankot.  Then

like monsoon, it moves darkness

over all country.

INDIANA

What evil?

SHAMAN

They came from Palace and took

sivalinga from out village.

WILLIE

Took what?

INDIANA

It's a sacred stone in a shine

that's supposed to protect a

village.

SHAMAN

It is why Krishna brought you here.

INDIANA

(politely firm)

Nobody brought us here.  Our plane

crashed.  We were shot down by --

SHAMAN

(interrupting)

No.  We pray to Krishna to help us

find the stone.  It was Krishna who

made you fall from sky -- so you can

got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva-

linga -- and bring back to us.

CUT TO:

40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40.

SHORT ROUND

Indy, they make out plane crash?

To get you here?

INDIANA

It's just superstition, Shorty.

Like a ghost story.

CHIEFTAIN

Yes.

INDIANA

Was the stone very smooth?

(he sees the

chieftain nod)

It was probably brought here from

a sacred river.

SHAMAN

(joining Indy and

the chieftain)

Long ago -- before my father's

father.

INDIANA

And it had three lines painted

across it?

(seeing the

shaman nod)

The lines represent the three

levels of the universe.  I've seen

stones like the one you lost.

WILLIE

I don't understand how losing one

rock could destroy this village.

(whispering to Indy)

Is it really powerful?

INDIANA

But why would the Maharajah take

this sacred stone?

SHAMAN

They say we must pray to their

evil god.  We say we will not.

INDIANA

(translating)

He says that when the sacred stone

was taken the village wells dried

up first and then the river stopped.

INDIANA

(translating)

He says their crops dies and then

the animals died.

INDIANA

(translating)

And then they took their children.

WILLIE

Their children?

INDIANA

(translating)

He says one night there was a fire

in the fields.  The men went to

fight it.  When they came back,

they heard the women crying in the

darkness.  And the children were

gone.

SHAMAN

You will find them when you find

sivlalinga.

INDIANA

I'm sorry, I don't know how I can

help you here.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

The English authorities who con-

trol this area are the only ones

who can help you.

CHIEFTAIN

They do not listen.

INDIANA

I have friends in Delhi and I will

make sure they investigate this...

SHAMAN

No, you will got to Pankot...

WILLIE

What'd he say now?

INDIANA

It was destined that I came here --

and the future cannot be changed...

Nope, you got a little surprise

over there, Shorty.

INDIANA

Hey, Willie -- I think you better

get out now.

WILLIE

Stark naked?  You wish... If you're

trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones,

this is a very primitive approach.

INDIANA

Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the

one who took your clothes off.

I just came over to remind you

that you never know what else

might be in the water.

WILLIE

Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what

I tell you now.

PET IT??!!

Yes, stroke it right along the

maxillary and precaudal verte-

brae.

Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet

it!

It's starting to let go!

It's letting fo.  I think it's --

I think it's going to sleep!

See -- I got you out...

Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes!

we can get job in the circus --

you like that?

WILLIE

Where'd you find your little body-

guard?

INDIANA

I met Short Round when he tried

to pick my pocket.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

Shorty's family was killed when

they bombed Shanghai.  He was

living on the streets.

WILLIE

(smiling)

He'll be okay.  He's a good kid.

WILLIE (Cont'd)

All these fires -- you expecting

more snakes, Dr. Jones?

INDIANA

By the way, how'd you end up in

Shanghai?

WILLIE

Well, when my nightclub career was

run over by the Depression, some

pinhead convinced me that "a girl

could go places in the Orient..."

So, look where I got.

INDIANA

What about the future?

WILLIE

Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to

latch onto a good-looking, in-

credibly rich prince.

INDIANA

I'd like to find one of those

myself.

WILLIE

(raising an eyebrow)

Oh really?

INDIANA

Yeah, but he's got to be dead and

buried for a couple of thousand years.

(smiling)

Fortune and glory...

WILLIE

Is that what you're hoping to find

at this palace, Dr. Jones?

INDIANA

Maybe...

WILLIE

What's that?

INDIANA

Something that kid gave me last

night.  It's a piece of an old

manuscript.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

The drawing shows a priest named

Sankara who lived centuries ago.

WILLIE

What does the writing say?

INDIANA

It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story

of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa

where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

WILLIE

(examining it)

That's Shiva?  What's he giving

the Priest?

INDIANA

Legend says he told Sankara to go

forth and combat evil.  To do that

he gave him five sacred stones that

had magical powers.

WILLIE

(looking at Indy)

You mean magical like the rock that

was stolen from that village?

INDIANA

It could be.

WILLIE

(quietly)

Fortune and glory...sweet dreams,

Dr. Jones.

INDIANA

I think you should sleep closer.

(seeing her sus-

picious look)

I meant for safety.

WILLIE

(smiling)

I'd be safer sleeping with

that snake.

WILLIE

Did you see it?!  It was one

of those bats!

(staring into

the darkness)

God, what else is out there...?!

INDIANA

Couldn't keep away, huh?

WILLIE

Just try and control yourself.

INDIANA

(without looking)

Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you

can get closer if you want...

INDIANA

Honey, I knew you'd be the first

one to give in...

INDIANA (Cont'd)

You're going to start something

I'm going to have to finish.

(moaning)

Okay, doll, you asked for it.

WILLIE (O.S.)

Why are we stopping here?

SHORT ROUND

What you look at, Indy?

INDIANA

Just a statue.

WILLIE

What's the guide talking about?

He hasn't said a word the whole

trip.

WILLIE

He's afraid of something.

INDIANA

He said he couldn't take us any

farther.  He has to go sell the

elephants.

WILLIE

You mean we have to walk the rest

of the way?

nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,

attacked by a bat -- I smell like

an elephant!

(yelling)

I tell you I'm not going to make it!

INDIANA

Any more complaints?

WILLIE

(smiling faintly)

Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this

sooner...

INDIANA

It doesn't feel like there's been

any permanent damage.

INDIANA

Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)

WILLIE

(frightened)

Hi...(hi)...(hi)...

CHATTAR LAL

I would say you look rather lost.

(disdainfullt)

But then I cannot imagine where

in the world the three of you

would look at home...

INDIANA

(smiling evenly)

Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're

on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss

Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's

Indiana Jones.

CHATTAR LAL

(surprised)

Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae-

ologist?

WILLIE

Hard to believe, isn't it...?

CHATTAR LAL

I remember first hearing your name

when I was studying at Oxford.  I

Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for

His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)

Welcome to Pankot Palace.

59.    INT.  PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON                                59.

WILLIE

(to Short Round)

How'd you like to run into him in

a dark alley...that one's kind of

cute...I could see myself married

to a prince like that...

CHATTAR LAL

The plane crash and your journey

here sound -- most incredible.

WILLIE

You should have been there...

INDIANA

We'd appreciate it if the Mahara-

jah would let us stay tonight.

We'll be on out way in the morn-

ing.

CHATTAR LAL

I am only his humble servant, but

the Maharajah usually listens to

my advice.

WILLIE

Is that him?

WILLIE (Cont'd)

(politely)

He's not exactly what we call

"a spring chicken".

CHATTAR LAL

No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the

present Maharajah's late father.

WILLIE

Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres-

ent Marahajah is a little younger?

And thinner?

CHATTAR LAL

They will escort you to your rooms

now.  You will be provided with

fresh clothes.  Tonight you will

be dining with His Highness.

WILLIE

Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My

luck is changing.  But look at

me -- my god, I've to to get

ready!

CHATTAR LAL

Eight o'clock in the Pleasure

Pavilion.

CUT TO:

INDIANA

(smiling)

I've always had a weakness for

folk dancing.

WILLIE

(snidely)

She might get away with that act

here, but she'd never make it in

a real nightclub.

CHATTAR LAL

We are fortunate tonight to have

some many unexpected guests.  his

is Captain Phillip Blumburtt.

CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)

Captain Blumburtt and his troops

are here to check up on the

"natives".

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

(politely)

Just a routine inspection tour.

CHATTAR LAL

The British worry so about their

Emprie -- it makes us feel like

well-cared-for children.

WILLIE

Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call

the Maharajah's  wife?

CHATTAR LAL

His Highness has not yet taken a

wife.

WILLIE

(happily)

No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't

met the right woman...

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

(joining Indy)

Interested in local curios?

INDIANA

No.  But I am interested in the

occult.  And this is a krtya.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

(grimacing)

Charming.

INDIANA

It's like the voodoo dolls of West

Africa.  The kryta represents your

enemy -- and gives you complete

power over him.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

That God all that mumbo jumbo

rubbish is disappearing.

INDIANA

You think so?

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Of course.  Admittedly, it's taken

time.  Britian's controlled India

for almost two hundred eyars now.

INDIANA

You're hanging on better here

than you did in America.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

(smiling sourly)

This is a different situation, Dr.

Jones.  These people are like

children.  We have to lead them

slowly into the twentieth century.

INDIANA

The Prime Minister doesn't seem

that naive.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

No, he's a very shrewd old boy.

Power behind the throne and all

that.  He actually runs this whole

province.

WILLIE

I think this Maharajah is swim-

ming in money.  Maybe coming here

wasn't such a bad idea.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

I believe we're being called to

dinner.

WILLIE

Finally!

CHATTAR LAL

His Supremem Highness, guardian of

Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah

of Pankot -- Zalim Singh.

WILLIE

That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

INDIANA

Maybe he likes older women.

INDIANA

Cheer up, you lost your prince,

but dinner's on the way.

WILLIE

I've never been so hungry in my

life...

WILLIE

(grimacing)

My god, sort of grusome, isn't

it...?

CHATTAR LAL

His Highness wants me to welcome

his visitors.  Especially the

renowned Dr. Jones from America.

INDIANA

We are honored to be here.

WILLIE

Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

INDIANA

I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini-

ster.  I was examining some of the

Maharajah's artifacts.

CHATTAR LAL

A very fine collection of very old

pieces, don't you think?

INDIANA

Yes, very fine.  But not all of the

pieces look old.  Some were carved

recently and look like images used

by the Thuggees to worship the god-

des Kali.

CHATTAR LAL

Dr. Jones, you know very well that

the Thuggee cult has been dead for

nearly a century.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Of course.  The Thuggees were an

obscenity that worshipped Kali

with human sacrifices.  The Brit-

ish Army wiped them out about the

time of the Mutiny of 1857.

MERCHANT

(looking at Willie)

But you're not eating!

WILLIE

(weakly)

I uh -- had bugs for lunch.

INDIANA

I suppose stories of the Thuggees

die hard.

CHATTAR LAL

There are no stories anymore.

INDIANA

Well, I don't know... we came here

from a small village and the peas-

ants there told us that the Pankot

Palace was growing powerful again

-- becuase of some ancient evil.

CHATTAR LAL

(sneeringly)

Their stories are just fear and

folklore.

INDIANA

(cooly)

Maybe.. but how do you explain

The Thuggee shrine I saw right

below the palace?

CHATTAR LAL

The local peasants are just as

superstitious.  You're very ob-

servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're

beginning to worry Capt. Blum-

burtt.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

I'm not worried, Prime Minister,

just interested.

WILLIE

(to Short Round)

Give me your hat...

SHORT ROUND

What for?

WILLIE

I'm going to puke in it...

INDIANA

You know the villagers also

claimed that this palace stole

something from them.

CHATTAR LAL

Dr. Jones, it our country a guest

does not usually insult his host.

INDIANA

Sorry, I thought we were just talking

about folklore.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

(trying to make peace)

I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru-

mors.

(but interested)

What was it they claimed was

stolen?

INDIANA

Something magical.  A sacred rock.

CHATTAR LAL

(condescendingly)

There, you see, Captain.  A rock!

INDIANA

When they lost this rock their

fields and animals dies.  They

also said their children were

taken from them.

CHATTAR LAL

I think that's enough  of this

nonsense, Dr. Jones...

WILLIE

So you have something, you know,

simple -- like soup or something?

MERCHANT

Looks delicious!

WILLIE

I wanna go home...

INDIANA

(to Chattar Lal)

I was dubious muself at first.

Then something connected -- the

village's rock and the old legend

of the Sankara Stones...

CHATTAR LAL

(controlling himself)

Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable

to vicious rumors.  I seem to re-

member that in Honduras you were

accused of being a grave robber

rather than a scientist.

INDIANA

(shrugging)

The newspapers exaggerated the

incident

CHATTAR LAL

And didn't the Sultan of Madagas-

car threaten to cut your head off

if you ever returned to his coun-

try?

INDIANA

That was a misunderstanding.

CHATTAR LAL

(smiling)

Exactly what we have here, Dr.

Jones.

MAHARAJAH

I have heard the terrible stories

of the evil Thuggee cult...

MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)

I thought the stories were told

to frighten children.  Later, I

learned that the Thuggee cult was

once real and did unspeakable

things.

MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)

I am ashamed of what happened here

so many years ago.  We keep these

objects -- to remind us that this

will never again happen in my

kingdom!

INDIANA

(after a moment)

I'm sorry if I've offended you.

MERCHANT

Ah, dessert!

MERCHANT (Cont'd)

Chilled monkey brains!

Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you

say?

INDIANA

Even if they were trying to scare

us away, a devout Hindu would

never touch meat.

(looking around)

Makes you wonder what these people

are...

MAHARAJAH

I have seen this thing.  What is

it, Dr. Jones?

Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!

INDIANA

We're guests here, Shorty.

MAHARAJAH

You will show me how it works

please.

INDIANA

You wish is my command, your

Highness.

MAHARAJAH

That is wonderful!  Please teach

me how!

INDIANA

Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

INDIANA (Cont'd)

an enemy even to its owner.  If

you get some rope, it'll be easier

to learn with, your Highness.

Now, I think we'll say goodnight.

Yeah -- and nothing else.

I'm a scientist.  I like doing

research on certain "nocturnal

activities" --

WILLIE

You mean like love rituals...

INDIANA

And mating customs...

WILLIE

Primitive sexual practices?

INDIANA

You're taling to an authority

You're dying to come into my room,

aren't you?

You want me so bad, why don't you

invite me?

MOLA RAM

You were caught trying to steal

the Sankara Stones.

INDIANA

(shrugging)

Nobody's perfect.  The way I

heard it, you stole one of them

from a small village.

MOLA RAM

There were five stones in the

beginning.  Over the centuries

they were dispersed by wars,

sold off by thieves like you...

INDIANA

Two are still missing.

MOLA RAM

No.  They are here -- somewhere.

A century ago when the British

raided this temple and butchered

my people, a loyal priest his the

last two stones down here in the

catacombs.

INDIANA

That's what you've got these chil-

dren -- these slaves digging for?

MOLA RAM

They dig for the gems to support

our cause.  They also search for

the last two stones.  Soon we will

have all five Sankara Stones and

the Thuggees will be all powerful!

INDIANA

Nobody can say you don't have a

vivid imagination.

MOLA RAM

You do not believe me?  You will,

Dr. Jones.  You will become a true

believer.

MOLA RAM (Cont'd)

Your Highness will witness the

thief's conversion.

MAHARAJAH

You will not suffer.  I recently

became of age and tasted the blood

of Kali.

MOLA RAM

Hold him!

MAHARAJAH

You will learn to obey because

you are powerless!

MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)

I control you now!

MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)

You told me that a whip could be

an enemy to its owner.  We shall

see!  Turn him over!

MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)

As Dr. Jones suggested, I have

been practicing.

MOLA RAM

The British in India will be

slaughtered.  Then we will over-

run the Moslems and force their

"Allah" to bow to Kali.

MOLA RAM (Cont'd)

And then the Hebrew God will fall

and finally the Christian God will

be cast down and forgotten.

MOLA RAM (Cont'd)

Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

What?

We found a tennel that leads to a

temple below the palace!  Please,

come with me, I'll show you!

CHATTAR LAL

Miss Scott, you're not making any

sense.

I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We

saw horrible things down there --

they had a human sacrifice and they

ripped a man's heart out!

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Who?

WILLIE

It's some kind of cult!  And they've

got the sacred stones that Indy was

searching for.

up the habit in Shanghai.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Miss Scott panicked?

INDIANA

When she saw the insects she passed

out cold.  I carried her back to

her room.  She was sleeping when I

re-entered the tunnel to look

around.

CHATTAR LAL

As she slept, she undoubtedly had

nightmares.

INDIANA

Then she must have run out of the

room and you found her.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Did you discover anything in that

tunnel, Dr. Jones?

INDIANA

Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That

tunnel's been deserted for years.

CAPT. BLUMBURTT

Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-

port will duly note that we

found nothing unusual here in

Pankot.

CHATTAR LAL

I'm sure that will please the

Maharajah, Captain.

What's wrong?

INDIANA

Ouch...

her tracks)

Oh... shit...

tunnel...

Some short cut!

SHORT ROUND

Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!

WILLIE

Indy -- looks out behind you!

INDIANA

Let my friends go!

INDIANA (Cont'd)

That's far enough!

MOLA RAM

You are in no position to give

orders, Dr. Jones.

INDIANA

You want the stones, let them go

and call off your guards!

MOLA RAM

Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I

don't believe you would kill

yourself!

MOLA RAM (Cont'd)

Your friends will die with you!

INDIANA

Then I guess we're all going to

take a big dive!

MOLA RAM

Give me the stones!

INDIANA

Mola Ram -- you're about to meet

Kali -- in Hell!

SHORT ROUND

Willie, look!

MOLA RAM

No, the stones are mine!

INDIANA

You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-

peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-

ing)

in Sanskrit)

wanted.

Not quite.

SHAMAN

We know you are coming back --

(indicating the

countryside)

-- when life returns to our village.

WILLIE

It's a real miracle.

SHAMAN

Now you see the magic of the

"rock" you bring back.

INDIANA

Yes, I've seen its power

INDIANA

The last Sankara Stone.

WILLIE

And they don't even know what

it really is.

INDIANA

(smiling at her)

Well, you didn't get your prince,

and there goes your diamond.

WILLIE

You didn't do so well yourself.

Finding that stone could've got-

ten you all the fortune and

glory you were talking about.

INDIANA

It's still a long way to Delhi.

Who knows what might happen.

WILLIE

Oh no, I'm finding a native guide

who knows the way.  No more de-

tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones.

WILLIE (Cont'd)

If you think I'm going to Delhi

or anyplace else with you, after

all the trouble you've gotten me

into...
