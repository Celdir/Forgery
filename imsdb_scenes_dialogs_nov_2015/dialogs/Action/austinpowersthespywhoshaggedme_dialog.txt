AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME

By

Mike Myers

NARRATOR

In his last adventure, Austin Powers,

a swinging spy from the Sixties, was

unfrozen in the Nineties to battle

his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled

Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear

warhead to the center of the earth

and banished him into space forever.

Or so he thought.

VANESSA

I love you, Mr. Powers.

AUSTIN

And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

VANESSA

Let's go out on the terrace. It's a

beautiful night, we can look at the

stars.

AUSTIN

Look how beautiful the night sky is.

VANESSA

Isn't that the big dipper?

AUSTIN

Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.

VANESSA

Austin!

AUSTIN

(sheepish)

Well, you know.

VANESSA

Hey, I've never seen that big star

before.

AUSTIN

Yeah, what is that?

DR. EVIL

This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I

have one more trick up my sleeve,

don't I Mr. Bigglesworth?

AUSTIN

Oh well, I guess it was nothing.

AUSTIN

Care for some champagne?

(pouring)

Here's to monotony-- I mean, monogamy!

AUSTIN

Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing,

luv?

VANESSA

(back turned)

Just putting on my--

FEMBOT VANESSA

(computer voice)

MAKE-UP!

AUSTIN

(frightened)

Vanessa, you're a Fembot!

AUSTIN

Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss

those?

VANESSA

(robot voice)

PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY

FOREPLAY.

AUSTIN

(very sad)

I can't believe Vanessa, my bride,

my one true love, the woman who taught

me the beauty of sharing your whole

life with another, the person who

taught me the meaning of love, was a

Fembot. How will I ever go on?

(beat)

Wait a tic! That means I'm single!

Oh, behave!

AUSTIN

Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and

free!

AUSTIN

Shaguar, baby, yeah!

BOBBY

Dad, I know you're against race mixing

and all that, but I met someone...

KLANSMAN

Don't say it!

BOBBY

I met someone... and he's black.

KLANSMAN

He?

JERRY SPRINGER

Please welcome Tim.

JERRY SPRINGER

Now Scott, tell us about your father.

Share with us.

SCOTT

Well he's the head of an evil

organization that has aspirations

for world domination.

JERRY SPRINGER

And where is your father right now?

SCOTT

He's in outer space, like frozen in

a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big

Boy rocket with his cat, Mr.

Bigglesworth.

JERRY SPRINGER

Really? Well, we have a surprise for

you, Scott. Let's bring out

SCOTT'S

father, Dr Evil.

DR. EVIL

Hello Scott, I'm back.

SCOTT

I can't believe you'd do this to me

on national television!

DR. EVIL

They offered me a free makeover.

JERRY SPRINGER

Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the

fathers here today open up to their

sons, sons to the fathers. Is there

anything you'd like to share?

DR. EVIL

Share?

JERRY SPRINGER

Yes, don't you have any secrets?

DR. EVIL

OK. I have a vestigial tail.

DR. EVIL

It's more of a nub, really. The spine

just goes on a little longer than it

should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean,

perform fellatio once and you're a

poet, twice and you're a homosexual.

I remember once I was being fisted

by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where

the story gets interesting. He was

lactose-intolerant. He could eat red

meat all night long, but one sip of

milk and it was gastric hell. And I

remember we were caught in fragrance

delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you

can imagine my humiliation at having

Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no

teeth." One of my greatest

disappointments is that I never became

a song and dance man. I could have

been a quadruple threat, kind of

like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,

singer, actor, and I would possess

nuclear weapons, the latter being

the most threatening of the four. I

once sat on a bus and tried to will

myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended

up with was a sense of failure and a

mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth

and perhaps a grudging respect for

the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.

For the most part I distrust dogs. I

slept in a horse once. It was quite

roomy. On second thought, it was the

Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'

and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I

wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the

Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I

also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy

of The Fonze while I was in coma

after smoking some Peruvian prayer

hash, but who at the end of the day

can honestly say they haven't done

that?

KLANSMAN

What are you, some kind of freak?

SCOTT

Shut up, jagoff!

KLANSMAN

I'll kick your ass punk!

DR. EVIL

No one talks to my boy that way!

DR. EVIL

I'm OK, I'm OK.

DR. EVIL

Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new

evil lair.

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman

of your organization, I seized upon

the opportunity to invest in a small

Seattle-based coffee company several

years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-

flung empire with 2000 outlets

worldwide.

DR. EVIL

Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a

good cuppa joe.

NUMBER TWO

If I may continue, I believe if we

shift our resources away from world

domination and focus on providing

premium quality coffee drinks, we

can increase our gross profits

fivefold.

DR. EVIL

Right. Perhaps you've confused me

with someone who gives a shit.  Might

I remind you that I run the show

here? I demand a little respect.

NUMBER TWO

(indicating Dr. Evil's

milk mustache)

Dr. Evil, I think you--

DR. EVIL

Silence! I will not tolerate your

insolence! Remember what happened

last time.

NUMBER TWO

May I add, I appreciate you

reinstating me after our little...

misunderstanding.

DR. EVIL

Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?

FRAU

Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.

DR. EVIL

How are things?

FRAU

I have come to embrace the love that

dare not speak it's name. To my right

is my lover.

FRAU

Her name is Unibrau. I met her on

the LPGA Tour.

DR. EVIL

Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.

FRAU

Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'

DR. EVIL

(wiping it off,

embarrassed)

Oh, I know. I know.

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the

Greek assassin, Oedipus.

DR. EVIL

Welcome to my private army, Oedipus.

Excited?

OEDIPUS

I could give a shit.

DR. EVIL

Kiss your mother with that mouth?

OEDIPUS

Yes.

DR. EVIL

Of course you do.

NUMBER TWO

(clearing throat)

Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at

which you liquidate henchmen far

exceeds our ability to replace them.

DR. EVIL

I have so few pleasures left to me,

Number Two. The key to life is to

rotate your vices. One day it's

executions, another day it's creamy

French cheese.  It's like frickin'

heroin.

NUMBER TWO

Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the

answer. While you were frozen, we

began a program to clone you.

DR. EVIL

Cool.

NUMBER TWO

We had a few glitches, but I think

you'll be pleased with the results.

FRAU

(shouting)

Send in the clone!

NUMBER TWO

He is identical to you in every way,

except he is one-eighth your size.

DR. EVIL

Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-

Me.

(to clone)

Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

DR. EVIL

Come Mr. Bigglesworth!

DR. EVIL

Mini-me, something to eat?

(expectant pause)

No?

(pause)

OK.

(to room)

Tired.  Gentleman, I have a plan. As

you know, the most powerful man in

the world is the President of the

United States. But he is just that-

a man, subject to temptations of the

flesh like any other man. Here's

what we do: we make it seem that the

President has had "extra-marital

oral relations" with- and this is

the kicker-

DR. EVIL

With a White House intern!

NUMBER TWO

(clearing his throat)

Uh-hem.

DR. EVIL

What, that already happened?

DR. EVIL

This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well,

how about a frickin' time machine?

Does the president have a time

machine? Have I been scooped on that?

NUMBER TWO

No, not that I'm aware of.

DR. EVIL

Alright, time machine it is. As you

know, every diabolical scheme I've

hatched has been thwarted by Austin

Powers. And why is that, ladies and

gentlemen?

SCOTT

Because you never kill him when you

get the chance and you're a dope?

DR. EVIL

No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".

NUMBER TWO

Mojo?

FRAU

Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force,

the essence, the libido, the "right

stuff".

DR. EVIL

It's what the French call a certain

'I don't know what.'

SCOTT

If you've got a time machine, why

don't you just go back and kill Austin

Powers when he's a baby or something?

DR. EVIL

No, no, no.

NUMBER TWO

(interrupting)

Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to

use your knowledge of the future to

play the stock market? We could

literally make trillions.

DR. EVIL

(smug laugh to himself)

Why make trillions when we could

make...

(pause)

Billions?

NUMBER TWO

Excuse me?

DR. EVIL

Why think small is all I'm saying.

SCOTT

A trillion is more than a billion,

numb-nuts.

DR. EVIL

Zip it. Unveil the time portal!

DR. EVIL

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the

time portal. As you know, Austin

Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore,

I time travel to 1969, two years

after he was frozen. Security will

be lax and I'll strike when he is

totally helpless.

SCOTT

Can I come?

DR. EVIL

No, Scott, Daddy has a score to

settle. Austin Powers is the snake

to my mongoose, or the mongoose to

my snake. Either way it's bad, I

don't know animals. But I do know

this: This time it's personal. Frau,

Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969.

Come, Mini-Me.

DR. EVIL

Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number

Two, you look very youthful and

healthy.

(turning to Frau)

And Frau you look...right.

DR. EVIL

OK, people, we now officially have a

chair problem. If another one of

these chairs hits me in the nuts,

I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want

you to meet Number Two.

NUMBER TWO

Hello there.

DR. EVIL

Mini-Me?

DR. EVIL

Shy. Low blood sugar.

(to room)

Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I

have an operative inside the Ministry

of Defense. By this time tomorrow,

Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.

DR. EVIL

(maniacal laugh)

Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

DR. EVIL (V.O.)

(maniacal laugh)

Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

BRITISH COLONEL

We've had reports that there's a spy

in the Ministry of Defense.  The

contents of this room are vital to

the country. Be on special alert.

FAT SOLDIER

(thick Scottish accent)

Those bastards will have to kill me

before I let anything happen to this

wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

BRITISH COLONEL

Very good. And try and lose some

weight for God's sake!

FAT SOLDIER

Yessir!

(sotto after the

Colonel)

I outta smash your teeth out with a

Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel

Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing-

our-Oil-Refusing-To-Recognize- our-

Scottish-Independence!

AUSTIN

Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's

funny, I just filled the Shaguar up

this morning.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(on picture phone)

Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of

British Intelligence.

AUSTIN

You always are, Basil. Listen, the

weirdest thing just happened, I've

run out of petrol.

BASIL EXPOSITION

We'll send a man around immediately.

How was your honeymoon?

AUSTIN

Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She

was a Fembot!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Ah women, who can understand them?

Moving on, let's discuss your new

case.

AUSTIN

New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!

BASIL EXPOSITION

You'll be doing a photo shoot. We

know that one of the models is an ex-

KGB agent selling top secret material

to the highest bidder.

AUSTIN

That sounds easy enough, you know

what they say: all work and no

shagging makes Austin a dull boy,

man!

AUSTIN

(looking around)

Tres chic, baby.

REG

Austin, the models are ready.

AUSTIN

Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks.

Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?

REG

What?

AUSTIN

Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making

models!

SUPERMODELS

(circling Austin)

It's him! Oh my God! It's Austin

Powers!

AUSTIN

One at a time, girls. One. At. A.

Time!

CINDY

Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've

had the pleasure.

AUSTIN

Of course you haven't had "The

Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah!

REBECCA

How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.

(indicating the photo

gear)

Your equipment is quite impressive.

AUSTIN

Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

AUSTIN

And what's your name, baby?

MODEL

(thick Russian accent)

Ivana Humpalot.

AUSTIN

Excuse me?

IVANA

Ivana. Ivana Humpalot.

AUSTIN

And I vanna toilet made of solid

gold but it's just not in the cards,

now is it?

AUSTIN (V.O.)

(inner monologue)

Now, which one is the Russian spy?

Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin...

or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!

AUSTIN

Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and

pout for me baby! Smashing!

AUSTIN

Great, darling. Give me some shoulder.

Yes, yes, yes.

(angry)

No! No!

AUSTIN

(to Rebecca)

Show me love. Smashing! You're an

animal. You're a tiger. Be a tiger,

baby! You're great! You're Grrrrrr-

eat! You're Tony, be corn flakes,

baby, be frosted. Now be a lemur,

baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur.

REBECCA

A lemur?

AUSTIN

A small mammal native to the African

savannah. C'mon baby, you know. Like

this!

(imitating lemur)

OK, predator coming! Now, burrow,

burrow! You're a lemur. It's all

you've got.

(beat)

I take it back. Be a tiger again.

Smashing!

AUSTIN

And... done! I'm spent!

REG

Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.

AUSTIN

I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot

and I are going to have a 'private

session'.

IVANA

When did you get "The Clapper"?

AUSTIN

November, 1964, Dutch East Indies,

shore leave.

IVANA

Are you cold, Mr. Powers?

AUSTIN

I once had a bad experience with

frostbite. I had to dip my tadger

into a brandy snifter.

IVANA

Do you know how we keep warm in

Russia?

AUSTIN

I can guess, baby.

IVANA

We play chess.

AUSTIN

I guessed wrong.

IVANA

It takes a keen intelligence to play

chess. Of course, you know what they

say about men with big brains, don't

you?

AUSTIN

They wear large hats?

IVANA

No, they make better lovers.

AUSTIN

Wrong again.

IVANA

I assume you know how to play.

AUSTIN

Of course.  The... horsey... moves

in an L shape.

AUSTIN

Let's stop playing games with each

other... especially difficult ones.

May I ask you a question, Miss

Humpalot?

IVANA

Of course.

AUSTIN

Do I make you horny? Do I?

IVANA

I'll tell you anything you want to

know, just make love to me.

IVANA

You are hairy, like an animal!

AUSTIN

(growling and barking)

Grrrr, baby.

AUSTIN

Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!

(covers the bear's

eyes)

Wait a tick, I don't want him watching

me while I'm on the job!

IVANA

Make love to me, monkey man.

AUSTIN

Groovy, baby!

IVANA (O.S.)

What's the matter?

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

(to camera)

Crikey, I've lost my mojo.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Where is he? In here?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, I came as soon as I heard.

AUSTIN

There must be some kind of mistake,

Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't

know it.

BASIL EXPOSITION

What's wrong with your neck, Austin?

AUSTIN

(turning stiffly to

face Basil)

I took a Viagra and it got caught in

my throat. I've had a stiff neck for

hours. Basil, is it true? Have I

lost my mojo?

BASIL EXPOSITION

We're going to run a few tests,

Austin. Don't worry, old friend,

we'll get to the bottom of this.

NURSE

Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to

give you a sponge bath before we

begin the test.

AUSTIN

(not paying attention

to her)

Alright, miss, just let me finish

this article on the Suez crisis.

AUSTIN

What's going on?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Alright, everyone, we're done.

AUSTIN

But the test hasn't even started!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin.

Not only were you actually reading

an article in that Playboy, but a

candy-stripe nurse offering to give

you a sponge bath didn't so much as

turn your head.

AUSTIN

Wait, I can explain, man! I was going

to shag her but the article was so

fascinating--

BASIL EXPOSITION

I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's

true: you've lost your mojo.

AUSTIN

(crushed)

Without my mojo, I'm useless to the

Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think

it's time to retire.

BASIL EXPOSITION

I'm afraid that's not possible,

Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has

returned.

AUSTIN

Again?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Again.

BASIL EXPOSITION

We have evidence that Dr. Evil has

developed a time machine.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Our researcher noticed that these

photos from the archives have changed.

That means Dr. Evil is traveling

back in time and creating alliances

with each decade's most despised

villains.

AUSTIN

I can't read in the car. I get a bit

vomy.

AUSTIN

Got it. I almost gipped.

BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)

Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is

in the year 1969. Luckily, we also

have a time travel device. After

years of research we've developed a

machine that will transport you back

to the Sixties.

AUSTIN

But Basil, isn't that the new

Volkswagen Beetle?

BASIL EXPOSITION

That's what they'd like you to

believe.

AUSTIN

So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969

and I was frozen in 1967, I could go

look at my frozen self. But, if I'm

still frozen in 1967, how could I

have been unthawed in the 90's and

traveled back to the Sixties?

(goes cross-eyed)

Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(to camera)

I suggest you don't worry about those

things and just enjoy yourself.

AUSTIN

This is smashing Basil. I'll go back

to the Sixties, recharge my mojo,

defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time

for tea.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Good luck, Austin.

AUSTIN

Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

AUSTIN

Sorry.

(changing gears)

Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby,

yeah!

AUSTIN

I feel better already, man!

AUSTIN

Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

AUSTIN

(singing)

'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU

CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE

SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY

JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

AUSTIN

(singing)

HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES

US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER

THAN THE SWORD

AUSTIN

(singing)

THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU

AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING

IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET

AUSTIN

(singing)

HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.

WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'

AUSTIN

(singing)

SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--

SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE

OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

EVERYONE

(chanting)

FREE-- LOVE!

(louder)

FREE-- LOVE!

(louder)

FREE-- LOVE!

(shouting)

IT'S THE SIXTIES!

FELICITY

Care for a ride?

AUSTIN

That's my Beetle, baby.

FELICITY

It was your Beetle. Get in.

FELICITY

Austin Powers, I presume?

AUSTIN

Powers by name, Powers by reputation.

FELICITY

Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by

name, Shag-very-Well by reputation.

AUSTIN

(turning to camera)

Crazy, baby!

FELICITY

Grab the wheel, would you?

ASSASSIN

Ahhhhhhhh!

FELICITY

Well, Austin, I think this time you

may have met your match.

AUSTIN

Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and

I'll beat him again.

FELICITY

I was talking about me.

AUSTIN

Welcome to my shag pad, baby.

AUSTIN

Care for something to drink?

AUSTIN

Or perhaps something to read?

AUSTIN

How about a hot cup of coffee?

FELICITY

Yes, I rather fancy a grind.

AUSTIN

Oh, Behave!

AUSTIN

Would you like a... mas-sage? A

sensssual mas-sage?

AUSTIN

How does that feel, baby?

FELICITY

Mmm, lower.

AUSTIN

(lowering his voice)

HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?

FELICITY

Wait, something's itching me.

FELICITY

That's better.

AUSTIN

Crikey!!!

AUSTIN

Sorry.

AUSTIN

(talking to his crotch)

Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do

it for England.

FELICITY

Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity

stretches very sexily.

AUSTIN

Would you 'like to see my etchings?

FELICITY

(sexy)

I think I'm ready for bed.

AUSTIN

I'll get you some PJs.

FELICITY

No, I'm ready for bed.

AUSTIN

Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth

then.

FELICITY

No, I want to have sex with you,

Austin.

AUSTIN

Hello Vicar!

FELICITY

I've studied everything about you-

your methods, your accomplishments,

your preferences. You're the reason

I became a spy. Now, I've waited two

years to meet you, so I say we get

busy making up for lost time.

AUSTIN

(reflective)

Felicity, I used to think that way,

too, but I guess... I guess I've

changed.  Not to make a short story

long, or to ramble on and on, or to

keep talking in a repetitive manner

ad infinitum until it becomes

impossible to remember what I was

talking about in the first place,

but- where was I?

AUSTIN

Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you.

I've lost my mojo.

FELICITY

(obviously disappointed)

Oh.

AUSTIN

I thought coming back to the Sixties

would bring it back, but it hasn't.

FELICITY

Austin, don't worry. I know just the

man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo

recommended him and he's the best.

AUSTIN

I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!

FELICITY

There he is. That's my guru.

FELICITY

Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin

Powers.

AUSTIN

How are you baby?

GURU PITKA

My chakras are aligned and I am in a

perfect state of equipoise.

AUSTIN

Good on ya. I don't know what that

means but it sounds fab.

FELICITY

Guru, we need some advice.

GURU PITKA

Hold your horses and any other beasts-

of burden. I must lead my disciples

in meditation and then I will help

you.

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhhh!

GURU PITKA

My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a

spiritual teacher and I have combined

many disparate disciplines into a

unified movement of human potentiality

and equipoise that I learned from my

guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste

man who died mysteriously of a disease

that strangely had all the hallmarks

of syphilis. He would say to me,

Sparky, love is all, life is breath.

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhhh!

GURU PITKA

Now, perhaps you are wondering where

I got the nickname Sparky.  Well,

when we were young we used to play a

game called "Stinkmop". We would

urinate into a bucket, dip a mop

into it, and play tag. I did not

care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise

old man said to me 'oh lighten up,

Sparky', and I don't know, the name

kind of stuck.

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhhhhh...

GURU PITKA

Now, the reason I am a spiritualist

instead of a therapist is that

'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist'

and that will not help us attain

potentiality. Now what is

potentiality? It is the ability to

achieve those goals that we wish to

achieve for ourselves. People often

say to me that they feel "nowhere",

and I am going to change that to

"Now here."

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhhhh...

GURU PITKA

And you have many assumptions about

your goals, but when you "assume"

You make an "ass" out of "u" and

"me".

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhhhh....

GURU PITKA

The being, or that which we call

'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It

is not the taughts. It is the Gap

between the tinker and the taughts!

We are not our mind, we are not our

body, we are the Gap!

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhh...

GURU PITKA

(rapid fire)

The heart of the matter is that you

are the heart of the matter.  There

is no "I" in "team". Beer before

liquor, never sicker. Don't take a

wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short

and your pump is weak, you better

stand close or you'll piss on your

feet. He who goes to bed with itchy

bum wakes up with smelly finger.

DISCIPLES

Ahhhhh...

GURU PITKA

Finally, the path to spiritual

awakening requires the death of ego.

Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the

mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay

Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

DISCIPLES

(chanting)

Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu

Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

GURU PITKA

Go with God, and pay at the door

please.

GURU PITKA

How can I help you?

AUSTIN

Guru, I'm having trouble performing.

GURU PITKA

What do you mean?

AUSTIN

You know- my bits and pieces are a

bit sleepy.

GURU PITKA

I'm not understanding.

AUSTIN

I've forgotten the steps to the Mummy-

Daddy dance.

GURU PITKA

Still not clear.

AUSTIN

My flag's at half mast and no one

will salute it.

GURU PITKA

Sorry?

AUSTIN

My Willie don't work.

GURU PITKA

Why are you beating around the bush?

AUSTIN

That's my problem.

GURU PITKA

Ohhhhh, I get it.

(beat)

No, I don't get it.

FELICITY

He's impotent!

AUSTIN

Alright, easy.

(to Guru)

Felicity and I were all set for some

hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for

six.

GURU PITKA

Oh, yes, I see.

AUSTIN

You have no idea what I'm saying, do

you?

GURU PITKA

Not a word.

AUSTIN

Guru, I've lost my mojo.

GURU PITKA

Oh, mojo! You should have said so.

Well, you've lost your mojo because

your chakras are misaligned. You

have lost love.

AUSTIN

Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?

FELICITY

Who's Vanessa?

AUSTIN

She was an evil robot minion of Dr.

Evil. I couldn't have loved her.

GURU PITKA

Denial ain't just a river in Egypt,

buddy. You will only get your mojo

back when you surround yourself with

love.

AUSTIN

Oh, I get what you're saying now!

He's talking about free love, baby!

Tune in, turn on, and drop out!

GURU PITKA

I am talking about true love. You

must stay and study until you are

worthy.

AUSTIN

No way, man. The only way to surround

yourself with love is to throw a

swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!

DR. EVIL

Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have

the mojo?

FAT BASTARD

First things first, where's your

shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle

head pokin' out.

DR. EVIL

(disgusted)

Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you

don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard

do you?

FAT BASTARD

I've got a lot of demons kickin'

around in my noggin, but weight issues

ain't one of them.

DR. EVIL

Alright, Fatty-

FAT BASTARD

The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the

incorrect weight for my height and I

was born out of wedlock, hence the

moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not

kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck

that could choke a donkey.

DR. EVIL

Fat Bastard, the mojo?

FAT BASTARD

Where's my (bleeping) money?

DR. EVIL

A gentlemen never discusses money.

FAT BASTARD

Fine, you can take your (bleep)in'

money and shove it up your (bleep),

you stupid (bleeping) prick! While

you're at it you can suck my greasy,

two-toned (bleep)!

DR. EVIL

(pause)

Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

FAT BASTARD

(Bleep) you!

DR. EVIL

Right. Bring in the money.

FAT BASTARD

Alright, here it is.

DR. EVIL

Mini-Me, fetch.

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin

Powers is back in the Sixties. One

of our best assassins spotted him

but he got away.

DR. EVIL

This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have

his mojo.

NUMBER TWO

There is another. Felicity Shagwell,

CIA.

DR. EVIL

Scott, what are you doing here?

SCOTT

I don't know, I was sitting around

watching the tube and The Courtship

of Eddie's Father came on Nick at

Nite, you know, and I was just

listening to that theme song--

(hums/sings the theme)

Anyway it made me think that maybe

we could try and work things out.

You know, you are my Dad and I need

you.

DR. EVIL

You had your chance, Scott. I already

have someone created in my image.

He's evil, he wants to take over the

world, and he fits easily into most

overhead storage bins.

(looking around)

Has anyone seen Mini-Me?

(calling out)

Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver?

Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a

frickin' bell on him or something?

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, phase three. We place a

giant laser on the moon. Let me

demonstrate.

(beat)

Where's my laser?

DR. EVIL

Mini-Me, don't chew my laser.

(to room)

Not feeling well. He has an ear

infection, but tit's OK.

(pause)

No? Nothing?

(back to model)

Anyway, the laser is powerful enough

to destroy every city on the planet

at will. We'll turn the moon into

what I like to call a "Death Star".

DR. EVIL

What?

SCOTT

(snickering again)

Nothing Darth.

DR. EVIL

What did you call me?

SCOTT

Nothing.

(pretends to sneeze)

Rip-off!

DR. EVIL

(unsure)

Bless you? Anyways, since my "death

star" laser was invented by the noted

Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I

thought we'd name it in his honor--

the Alan Parsons Project.

DR. EVIL

What now?

SCOTT

The Alan Parsons Project was a

progressive rock band from 1982.

Why don't you just name it Operation

Wang Chung, ass?

DR. EVIL

(indicating laser)

When you get your own evil empire,

you can call it whatever you want.

Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate

the awesome lethality of the Alan

Parsons Project. Fire the laser!

NUMBER TWO

My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the

Wihite House with no warning!

DR. EVIL

Actually, that was just footage from

the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture

Independence Day, but it would be a

lot like that. What do you think,

Scott?

SCOTT

Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was

really impressive.

DR. EVIL

Shhhh!

SCOTT

I'm nineteen, I don't-

DR. EVIL

Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh-

shh! It's Morse code.

(reading imaginary

paper)

Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'

SCOTT

You are so lame-

DR. EVIL

(like Electric Company)

Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, what are we going to do

about Powers?

DR. EVIL

Fat Bastard, in addition to being

extremely rotund, you're a vicious

killer.

FAT BASTARD

It'll be my pleasure.

DR. EVIL

It's an easy job. Without his mojo,

Powers will be...powerless?

AUSTIN

This shag-in is gonna blow your mind,

baby, yeah!

PREGNANT WOMAN

Hey!

AUSTIN

You'll thank me later, baby.

AUSTIN

(noticing someone)

Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?

RICARDO

Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen

and the king laughed because he had

too.

AUSTIN

(to camera)

Crazy, man!

FELICITY

Let's split up and scope the scene.

AUSTIN

Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at

least not without me.

AUSTIN

Oh, behave!

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

(to chick)

You're very exotic, baby. Do you

have a little English in you?

CHICK

No.

AUSTIN

Would you like to?

CUT TO:

ALAN ZEUS GUY

(rolling his eyes)

This is ridiculous!

CUT TO:

LONDON COP

Have you ever been picked up by the

fuzz?

FELICITY

No, but I bet it really hurts.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary

defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty

prosty.

CUT TO:

ESKIMO

(to camera)

I don't get it.

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

Those are skin tight. How do you get

into those pants, baby?

FELICITY

Well you can start by buying me a

drink.

CUT TO:

VIKING

You were great last night. By the

way, I'm Thor.

FELICITY

You're Thor? I'm tho thor I can hardly

thit.

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

(German accent)

Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed.

Last night I had German-Chinese food.

An hour later I was hungry- for power.

CUT TO:

ZEUS GUY

Oh puh-leez, why don't you take a

handful of F-off pills?

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

Did you hear about the contortionist

who was engaged to be married?

FELICITY

Yeah, I heard she broke it off.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ARTIE JOHNSON

Verrrrry interesting- but shtupid!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FELICITY

Look at that.

AUSTIN

That's not a pretty sight. Who is

he?

FELICITY

Until recently he worked security

for the MOD, but we think he might

be a double agent, possibly for Dr.

Evil.

AUSTIN

How do you know?

FELICITY

We've noticed that his lifestyle has

changed dramatically. He's made a

lot of cash purchases, he's hanging

out with foxes half his age, and

he's becomes quite a fixture on the

London party circuit.

AUSTIN

Who's the girl?

FELICITY

I don't know, but it looks like he's

splitting.

FELICITY

I'll follow him. You see what you

can get out of the girl. We'll

rendezvous later.

AUSTIN

Hello, hello.

GIRL

Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party.

AUSTIN

Who are you today, baby?

GIRL

Robin. Robin Swallows.

AUSTIN

Swallows? That's an interesting name.

Are you English?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

German, actually. My maiden name is

Spitz.

AUSTIN

Well which is it, baby, Spitz or

Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

The pleasure is mine.

AUSTIN

Charmed, I'm sure.

(still shaking, her

breasts jiggle)

How do you do?

(still shaking,

jiggling)

Yes, quite.

(shakes, jiggles)

I always enjoy meeting new people.

(shakes, jiggles)

How's your mum? Good.

(shakes, jiggles)

I love shaking hands.

AUSTIN

(snapping out of it)

So, who was your friend?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

His name is Fat Bastard.

AUSTIN

It suits him.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

He's my lover.

AUSTIN

OK. Would you happen to know if he's

in business with a man named Mr.

Evil?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.

AUSTIN

Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin

does a smug take.

AUSTIN

Something to drink? Would you like a

Mister Pepper?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper.

AUSTIN

Really? I said Mister Pepper.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

You're a groovy boy, I'd like to

strap you on sometime.

AUSTIN

Oh, behave!

CUT TO:

ALAN ZEUS TYPE

Meanwhile...

BACK TO:

FAT BASTARD

...and I'll have a fried-prawn

sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two

whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad

in the hole, bubble and squeak,

bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish

and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.

FELICITY

I love a man with a large appetite.

FAT BASTARD

And I love a woman with big (bleeps),

so let's shut up and get to

(bleep)ing.

AUSTIN

Can I ask you a question?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

Yes.

AUSTIN

Thank you.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

Well, what's the question?

AUSTIN

Oh, yes. Would you like to shag?

Would you?

ROBIN SWALLOWS

I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come

right... over... here.

AUSTIN

You're a bit of alright.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

(strained)

Oedipus... use the revolver.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

(strained)

Oedipus... use the machine gun.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

Oedipus, Oedipus...

AUSTIN

Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead

as vaudeville.

ROBIN SWALLOWS

You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has

your mojo and it's only a matter of

time before he kills you and takes

over the world.

(weak)

Tell Fat Bastard I'll miss him...

CUT TO:

FAT BASTARD

I always get (bleep)in' hungry after

I get my end away!

FELICITY

I never would have thought that a

man of such tremendous girth could

be such a, um, creative and sensuous

lover!

FAT BASTARD

You want some chicken? I have more!

FAT BASTARD

Frisky are we? Alright lets have

another go!

DR. EVIL

Get me the President of the United

States.

PRESIDENT

Dr. Evil, what do you want?

DR. EVIL

Not what I want Mr. President, but I

will receive. In 12 hours I will

destroy Washington, DC with a giant

laser.

DR. EVIL

OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the

laser get a frickin' room. Honestly.

(to President)

I will destroy another major city

every hour- that is, unless you

pay me-

DR. EVIL

One hundred billion dollars!

PRESIDENT

Dr. Evil that's more than the entire

federal budget for 1969.

DR. EVIL

Don't play games with me. The capitol

will disappear if I don't receive

DR. EVIL

One hundred billion dollars!

PRESIDENT

That much money simply doesn't exist.

I don't think l00 billion is even a

number. It's like saying I want a

kajillion bajillion dollars.

DR. EVIL

Come on, Mr. President...

DR. EVIL

"Show me the money!"

PRESIDENT

What?

DR. EVIL

"Show me the money!"

PRESIDENT

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

DR. EVIL

You know, kwan? Show me the money?

No? Nothing?

SCOTT

It's 1969. That movie won't come out

for another 30 years, ass.  They

don't know what you're talking about.

DR. EVIL

Right. OK, see if you understand

this: give me the money or I'm going

to blow you to frickin' bits, OK?

PRESIDENT

But-

DR. EVIL

(making 'stop' gesture)

Talk to the hand!

DR. EVIL

(to Scott)

I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding

Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech,

very touching.

DR.EVIL

Okay, everybody clear the room!

DR. EVIL

Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.

(beat)

This isn't working. I don't feel

anything.

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.

DR. EVIL

I was just... right. Would it kill

you to frickin' knock?

FELICITY

Austin, tell me about the Nineties.

AUSTIN

You know I can't tell you details

about the future, baby, it could

alter history.

FELICITY

Not details, just what it's like.

You know, what's the scene?  Where's

it at?

AUSTIN

There've been a lot of advances in

the Nineties, baby. The economy is

stable, people take better care of

their health concern for the

environment is on the rise and, um,

let's see, there's an entire

television channel dedicated to golf.

FELICITY

Sounds awful.

AUSTIN

It's not so bad once you get used to

it. The Nineties are about

responsibility. You know, having

respect for yourself and other people.

I even got married.

FELICITY

You? Married? What about the sexual

revolution?

AUSTIN

Well, it turns out there were some

casualties, baby. Don't you think

you'll ever get married?

FELICITY

No, not until I get a little more

'experience' under my belt.

AUSTIN

Oh, behave!

AUSTIN

(wide-eyed)

Oh my God!

FELICITY

(looking around)

What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?

AUSTIN

No, written here on my hand, see?

AUSTIN

Says 'Oh my God!'

FELICITY

Austin, look.

AUSTIN

Felicity, I haven't had this much

fun since I worked undercover in

Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.

FELICITY

1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch

cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from

poisoning the world's water supply.

FELICITY

I've studied your file, Austin. I

want to be a trailblazer, just like

you.  The Seventies are right around

the corner. It's going to be a

glorious time for fashion and music

and technology-- it won't be long

before every flying car has its own

8-track.

FELICITY

The CIA has always been a boy's club

until now. Well move over, this

chick's taking over.

AUSTIN

(hoarse)

Very impressive.

FELICITY

Austin, your voice!

AUSTIN

Yes, I think I'm coming down with

something.

AUSTIN

I'll get some ice cream. Would you

like some?

FELICITY

No thanks.

AUSTIN

(hoarse, to ice cream

man)

Could I have two scoops of Vanilla,

please?

ICE CREAM MAN

Right away, governor. Would you like

chocolate syrup?

AUSTIN

(hoarse)

Yes, please.

ICE CREAM MAN

Will you have any whipped cream?

AUSTIN

(hoarse)

I will, thank you.

ICE CR@ MAN

Candy sprinkles?

AUSTIN

(hoarse)

Yes please.

ICE CREAM MAN

Crushed nuts?

AUSTIN

No, laryngitis.

ICE CREAM MAN

Here's your change, sir. Oh, and

Austin--

AUSTIN

(now with phlegmy

throat)

Basil!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Hello, Austin. What's wrong with

your voice?

AUSTIN

(still phlegmy throat)

I just had ice cream. Listen to me,

I have dairy throat.  "Mary had a

little lamb and it was always

gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar

gate and kicked it's little-

BASIL EXPOSITION

(Interrupting)

Austin! Things are heating up, so I

thought it best to contact you in

disguise. Felicity, your plan worked.

You and Austin track Fat Bastard

back to Dr. Evil.

AUSTIN

But how can we track Fat Bastard?

FELICITY

I planted a homing device on him

last night.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Yes, and we're starting to pick up

the signal now.

AUSTIN

How did you get close enough to plant

a homing device?

FELICITY

I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.

AUSTIN

You... him? Just like that?

FELICITY

Yes, Austin, we needed that

information.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity,

we now know that-

AUSTIN

(interrupting, to

Felicity)

Did you use an elaborate set of

pulleys? A block and tackle?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Anyway, you two follow the signal

back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and

then-

AUSTIN

(interrupting, to

Felicity)

I just can't get my head around it,

baby. You're so small and he's so

... not small. The sheer mechanics

of it are mindboggling!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Never mind, Austin, you two have

work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.

AUSTIN

I got it! A Chinese basket with a

counter-weighted ballast.  That's

how you did it, right?

FELICITY

Austin, it almost sounds like you're

jealous.

AUSTIN

Who, me? That's not possible, baby!

(beat, to himself)

is it?

AUSTIN

Get down!

FELICITY

We're obviously on the right track.

(re: tracking screen)

It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an

island in the middle of the ocean.

AUSTIN

According to the readings, Dr. Evil's

headquarters is over the next ridge.

FELICITY

Can I have a look?

AUSTIN

Sure.

FELICITY

Question is, how do we get in?

AUSTIN

(muffled)

Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...

FELICITY

Austin, did you hear me?

AUSTIN

I seem to be stuck in your dirty

pillows.

FELICITY

Where are the topographical maps

that Basil drew up?

AUSTIN

I think they're in the tent.

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Have you got it out yet?

FELICITY (V.O.)

Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things

do you put in there?

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Oh, anything that catches my fancy.

FELICITY (V.O.)

How do you manage to fit it all in?

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Oh, it stretches to fit.

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Are you almost done? I can't hold it

much longer.

FELICITY

Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing

how much this duffel bag will hold.

DR. EVIL

(singing)

'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?

JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I

do have some bad news.  Powers' is

on the island.

DR. EVIL

How tedious.

NUMBER TWO

Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to

him by using the girl.

DR. EVIL

Really?

NUMBER TWO

I have the perfect weapon. Frau?

FRAU

(shouting)

Bring in the He-Bots!

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots.

What kind of woman could resist these

perfect specimens of masculinity?

Their clothes are stylish, their

posture is ramrod straight, and their

buttocks are tight, like tigers.

And, each He-Bot is armed with a

secret weapon.

NUMBER TWO (O.S.)

Poison gas...

NUMBER TWO (O.S.)

Machine gun...

NUMBER TWO (O.S.)

And deadly acid.

DR. EVIL

Right. I object to the last one on

aesthetic grounds, but I don't care

how you get Powers, just bring him

to me.

(to Mini-Me)

Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and...

(singing)

ME, AND MY SHA-DOW STROLLING DOWN

THE A-VA-

(rapidly)

WASN'T A STREET, WASN'T A ROAD

WASN'T A BOULEVARD

(dancing in step)

ME, AND MY SHA- OW ALL ALONE AND FEE-

LING...

MINI-ME

(voice unnaturally

low)

BLUE!

FELICITY (V.O.)

Do you want everything to go back

in?

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat

Bastard-

FELICITY (V.O.)

It's my job, Austin. You of all people

should understand that.  Marakesh,

1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I

know your record backwards and

forwards.  You've had more sex on

the job than a Swedish stewardess.

AUSTIN (V.O.)

You're right, Felicity, I can't deny

it. But the world changed, and I

changed too.

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Ow!

(beat)

My back hurts.

FELICITY (V.O.)

Are you OK?

AUSTIN (V.O.)

I'm fine, just keeping packing.

FAT BASTARD

Christ Almighty, it smells terrible

in here.

DR. EVIL

It's the volcanic sulphurous

emissions. We've put up some air

fresheners.

FAT BASTARD

Great, now it smells like someone

took a shite in a pine tree.

NUMBER TWO

Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded

into the rocket. You're ready for

launch.

DR. EVIL

I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis.

I have so few pleasures, you know.

DR. EVIL

Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome

to my hollowed-out volcano.

AUSTIN

We meet again, Dr. Evil.

DR. EVIL

Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you

alive is so you can feel the agony

of watching my plan unfold.

AUSTIN

Dr. Evil your plan will never--

DR. EVIL

Oh, is that yours?

AUSTIN

My mojo!

DR. EVIL

You know what they say: finders

keepers, loser weepers.

FELICITY

Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?

DR. EVIL

Of course. Why?

FELICITY

Now you've got a couple of achers.

DR. EVIL

Oww! My stomach hurts!

AUSTIN

(wincing)

I don't care if he is evil, you don't

give a man a shot in the pills. It's

just not cricket, baby.

DR. EVIL

Take them away.

SCOTT

She just hoofed you in the sack and

you're going to leave them alone in

a jail cell with one inept guard?

They'll escape, dipshit. You do this

every time!

DR. EVIL

You're going the right way for a

smacked bottom, young man.

SCOTT

You don't own me!

DR. EVIL

I do actually.

(pulling out paper)

It's complicated. Usually it's illegal

but this buddy of mine... but I

digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving

you in charge. I'm going up the moon

to hold the world ransom with my

giant laser, I shouldn't be long.

FAT BASTARD

What about Powers?

DR. EVIL

He's tucked away safely in his cell.

He's harmless without that mojo.

Guard it with your life.

(to Number Two)

Number Two, begin the countdown.

NUMBER TWO

Five, four, three...

NUMBER TWO (V.O.)

Two, one, liftoff!

OPERATOR

Colonel, you better have a look at

this radar.

COLONEL

What is it, son?

OPERATOR

I don't know, sir, but it looks like

a giant--

CUT TO:

PILOT

Dick!

CO-PILOT

Yes?

PILOT

Take a look out of starboard.

CO-PILOT

Oh my God, it looks like a huge--

MAN

Pecker!

WOMAN

Where?

MAN

Over there. A rare red-billed

woodpecker!

(looks over with

binoculars)

What sort of bird is that? Oh

goodness, it's not a bird, it's-

CUT TO:

SERGEANT

Privates! We have reports of an

Unidentified Flying Object. It has a

long, smooth shaft, complete with-

UMPIRE

Two balls! No strikes.

(looking up)

What is that? It looks just like an

enormous--

COLONEL

Johnson!

RADAR OPERATOR

Yes, sir?

COLONEL

Get on the horn to British

Intelligence and let them know about

this.

FELICITY

How are we going to get out of here?

AUSTIN

Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard

again?

FELICITY

(exploding)

Austin, that is it! I don't know

what happened to you in the Nineties,

but I'm still here, in the Sixties,

and I still swing! Don't try to lay

your hang-ups on me just because you

lost your mojo! That one hurts.

AUSTIN

Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.

FELICITY

I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap

shot.

AUSTIN

No, baby, you're right. I was wrong

to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.

FELICITY

But the Austin Powers I knew was

wild and crazy and free. He could

never be jealous.

AUSTIN

That Austin is gone. I've changed. I

knew someone, not long ago, a very

special woman. She taught me that

life isn't about jumping into the

sack with whoever comes along, it's

about caring and responsibility. And

while it is true she turned out to

be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil,

I suppose I really did... love her.

FELICITY

Was that your wife?

AUSTIN

Yes, Vanessa.

FELICITY

Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to

understand everything you've gone

through, but I trust you. I'll make

you a deal: if we get out of here

alive, I'll give monogamy a try.

AUSTIN

With me?

FELICITY

Yes, silly.

AUSTIN

Groovy, baby!

FELICITY

We need to lure the guard inside and

get his key.

AUSTIN

Alright, what if I pretend to be

desperately ill with food poisoning?

The guard, drawn by my cries of pain,

will come to investigate.  Meanwhile,

you dig a pit and line it with

makeshift punji sticks made from

sharpened toothbrushes. The guard

falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've

got the key.  What do you think?

FELICITY

That might work, but how about this?

FELICITY

(giving a wolf whistle)

What do you think of these, my man?

GUARD

Mommy...

FELICITY

(seductive, to guard)

It's very hot in here, don't you

think?

FELICITY

(irritated)

It's very hot in here, don't you

think?

FELICITY

(breaking cover)

Austin!

AUSTIN

(from above)

I'm very firmly wedged.

FELICITY

If you want something done...

AUSTIN

Almost... got it!

AUSTIN

Let's go get my mojo!

DR. EVIL

Has anyone seen my gravity booties?

Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin'

moon base. Hello, we're on the moon,

no gravity?

(calling out)

Mini-Me? Are you alright?

DR. EVIL

My frickin' mascot is stuck to the

ceiling, OK? Not good. Papa not happy.

DR. EVIL

(looking up)

Somebody get the stick. Hold on,

Mini-Me.

(into microphone)

Begin laser-

DR. EVIL

(into microphone).

Begin-

DR. EVIL

(into mic)

Begin laser ignition sequence.

DR. EVIL

Lunar alignment in 6 hours.

FELICITY

Where's your mojo, Austin?

AUSTIN

I'm not sure.

AUSTIN

Watch out, baby, He-Bots!

AUSTIN

I can't fight them without my mojo.

FELICITY

Who said anything about fighting?

AUSTIN

Smashing, Felicity, you were making

me very horny, man! Extremely randy,

indeed!

FAT BASTARD (O.S.)

C'mon, give the lads a show. Take of

your top. Put 'em on the glass! Make

'em bounce. Let's have a look at

your tits.

AUSTIN

Fat Bastard!

FAT BASTARD

Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

AUSTIN

Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!

FAT BASTARD

I give the orders, (bleep) for brains.

Guards, take them back to their cells.

FELICITY

Hold on, let me ask you one question.

FAT BASTARD

Alright, I guess I owe you that much

for a night of carnal ecstasy.

FELICITY

Are you happy?

FAT BASTARD

What kind of stupid ass question is

that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up

to my tits in clean stinky.

FELICITY

You didn't answer my question, are

you happy?

FAT BASTARD

It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I

could lose a few pounds, but I could

shiva git!

FELICITY

Are you happy?

FAT BASTARD

Of course I'm not happy. Look at me,

I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger

titties than you do! I've got more

(bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone

book.  I've got more crack cheese

than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay

seen ma willie in two years. That's

enough time to declare it legally

deed! I can't stop eating. I eat

because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy

because I eat.

(starts to cry)

I'm caught in a cycle and there's no

escape!

AUSTIN

Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's

a thin bastard, trying to get out

FAT BASTARD

Maybe there's big crap inside me

trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough

of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms.

Listen, I've run the gamut of self-

help books.  "Food isn't love", right,

but how do you get it from the page

to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak,

I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here,

take the mojo.

FAT BASTARD

I appreciate you trying to reach me,

no one can do it for me, I know this

now.  There's a hole in my soul that

food won't fill. This is the beginning

of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym

everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's

someone I have to get in touch with

and forgive... myself.

(pause)

Sorry. I farted.

(pause)

It's a long road ahead.

AUSTIN

Hold on, I have something very

important to do.

FELICITY

How do you feel?

AUSTIN

Sound as a pound, my spuds are

boiling. Fancy a shag?

FELICITY

Austin, we don't have time.

AUSTIN

C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good

foot and do the bad thing!

FELICITY

Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the

moon. The world is in danger.

AUSTIN

Right, the moon. I think I know

someone who can give us a lift.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

There's been some sort of delay in

the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but

we understand that America's first

manned mission to the moon will be

blasting off shortly.

AUSTIN

Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket

scientist to figure this stuff out.

ASTRONAUT

I am a rocket scientist.

MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.)

We will have lift-off in T minus 10

seconds... 9... 8... etc.

AUSTIN

Felicity, if you get frightened,

just hold my hand.

MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.)

We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has

cleared the tower and is heading for

a rendezvous with the moon.

FELICITY

(yelling)

Yaaaaa-hoooo!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit.

How was that lift-off?

AUSTIN

To be honest it was terrifying. It

felt like sitting on top of a bomb.

As I punched through the atmosphere,

I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled

myself.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Happens all the time in that

situation.

AUSTIN

No, I mean I soiled myself just now

when I said oh 'my God!'

FELICITY

Basil, it was amazing!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Prepare for moon landing. We only

have one hour until Dr. Evil fires

the laser!

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Mission control, the swinger has

landed.

AUSTIN

This is one small step for man, but

a giant step for shagging.  Can you

imagine it, baby, weightless? The

permutations are mind-boggling.

FELICITY

Naughty boy!

AUSTIN

God Save the Queen.

MISSION COMMANDER

The Queen? This is an American show,

goddammit. Let's roll that footage

we shot last week in the studio.

DR. EVIL

Position the laser.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

WARNING, LASER CALIBRATION!

DR. EVIL

Get me the President.

DR. EVIL

Mr. President, your time is up. This

is your last chance to pay 100 billion

dollars or see Washington DC

destroyed.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

WARNING, LASER CALIBRATION!

PRESIDENT

What? I can't hear you.

DR. EVIL

Pay me 100 billion dollars or see

Washington DC destroyed!

PRESIDENT

I'm sorry, I just can't hear you.

DR. EVIL

(louder)

How about now?

PRESIDENT

Better.

DR. EVIL

The Capital will be destroyed-

PRESIDENT

Sorry! I just can't- I think it's

that alarm.

DR. EVIL

Could someone shut off that frickin'

alarm? I'm trying to hold the free

world hostage here. Honestly.

(shouting)

WILL DESTROY WASHINGTON DC UNLESS

YOU PAY ME-

DR. EVIL

(shouting)

100 BILLION DOLLARS!

PRESIDENT

Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's

more money than is in the entire

Federal Treasury!

DR. EVIL

Oh well, I guess you have one minute

to- "show me the money"!

PRESIDENT

I still don't know what that means.

I can't show you the money because

we don't have the money.

DR. EVIL

Then I suppose you're up shit's crick

without a paddle.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the

moon. We'll soon know whether he has

succeeded or whether the world will

be destroyed!

FELICITY

Let's find Dr. Evil.

AUSTIN

Shhh...

FELICITY

Austin, you've done it! You got Dr.

Evil!

AUSTIN

Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo

working overtime.

FELICITY

Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my

rear!

AUSTIN

Oh, behave!

AUSTIN

Poor little bugger. He's so small,

he's like a dog or something.

AUSTIN

Poor little bugger.

(realizing)

Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is

still alive! Felicity?

AUSTIN

(holding his gun on

Dr. Evil)

Alright, slap-head, turn around.

Slowly.

DR. EVIL

Aren't you forgetting something?

AUSTIN

Felicity!

(to Dr. Evil)

What have you done to her?

DR. EVIL

Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.

FELICITY

(muffled through glass)

Don't worry about me Austin. You've

got to save the world!

DR. EVIL

It looks like you have a choice,

Powers: save the world, or save your

girlfriend.

AUSTIN

I've got my mojo back, man, I can do

both.

DR. EVIL

We'll see. Fire the laser!

AUSTIN

Hands off my joystick, baby.

DR. EVIL

Damn you, Powers!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Warning! Self-destruct sequence

initiated!

AUSTIN

See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do

both.

DR. EVIL

Perhaps you spoke too soon.

AUSTIN

Noooooo!

AUSTIN

Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake

up! Please God, don't take her away.

AUSTIN

Felicity, you have to understand, I

thought I had my mojo back.  This

isn't fair.

AUSTIN

I love you, Felicity! I know I

couldn't say it before, but I really

do love you!

(enraged)

Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!

CUT TO:

DR. EVIL

You make love to your wife out of

duty, your mistress for pleasure,

and a Roman boy for ecstasy.

(noticing Austin)

Shit.

AUSTIN

I have to commandeer this vehicle.

(noticing)

Hey, aren't you Hutch?

VOICE (O.S.)

No.

PAUL MICHAEL GLASER

I'm Starsky.

DAVID SOUL

I'm Hutch.

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN (O.S.)

Iceberg, dead ahead!

JAMES CAMERON

I'm king of the world!

CUT TO:

AUSTIN

I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

DR. EVIL

(breathing heavily)

Before you do that, know this: Austin,

I am... your... father.

AUSTIN

Really?

DR. EVIL

No. I can't back that up. I was just

grasping at straws. I had nothing.

But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers,

you really have become a product of

the Nineties.

AUSTIN

How so?

DR. EVIL

You're more interested in your job

as glorified policeman than you are

in love. You won the battle, but I

won the war. Love means nothing,

you've proved it.

AUSTIN

I didn't think that Felicity was

going to die, man.

DR. EVIL

What a cowardly response. I'm

disappointed really. You have the

power to go back in time and save

her, but it means letting me go.

DR. EVIL

Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going

to be? Me or the girl?

AUSTIN

Felicity!

CUT TO:

DR. EVIL

It looks like you have a choice:

save the world, or save your

girlfriend.

AUSTIN

I choose love, baby.

AUSTIN

Felicity, I love you.

FELICITY

(breathless)

But I thought-

AUSTIN

That was another place and another

time, baby.

FELICITY

(gasping)

Can't. Breathe.

AUSTIN

Sorry, baby, I got a little over-

stimulated.

DR. EVIL

Fire the laser!

AUSTIN

What do we do?

FELICITY

Use your mojo!

AUSTIN

I don't have it!

FELICITY

Trust me, you do!

BASIL EXPOSITION

He did it, he saved the world!

(calming down)

Of course, I thought he might.

FELICITY

Austin, you did it!

AUSTIN

Uh-oh.

(beat)

I think I just got my mojo back.

Really.

FELICITY

Austin, you had it all along. No one

can take your, mojo away from you!

DR. EVIL

Good-bye, Mr. Powers, for the last

time.

RADAR OPERATOR

Sir, you better have a look at this

radar.

COLONEL

What is it?

RADAR OPERATOR

don't know, sir. It's hard to

describe.  It's... it's-

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Just a little prick!

DOCTOR

All done!

(out the window)

Good lord, what is that? If I didn't

know better I'd say it's a-

CUT TO:

CHINESE TEACHER

Wang!

CHINESE TEACHER

Pay attention!

CHINESE STUDENT

I'm sorry, Comrade Teacher.

(pointing out window)

was distracted by that enormous flying-

RACHEL HUNTER

Rod?

ROD STEWART

Yes, Rachel?

RACHEL HUNTER

(pointing to sky)

What's that?

ROD STEWART

(looking up)

It looks like a giant-

CUT TO:

OLD LADY TEACHER

Penis!

(pointing to her chart)

The male reproductive organ. Also

known as tallywhackers, wankers,

schlongs, or--

CUT TO:

BASIL EXPOSITION

Peters!

CAPTAIN PETERS

Yes, sir?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Any word from Austin?

CAPTAIN PETERS

We've picked up his signal, but the

lunar base seems to self-destructing.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(on microphone)

Austin, if you can hear me, use the

time portal! There's no time to get

to the lunar module! Use the time

portal!

FELICITY

Austin, you have to get to the time

portal!

AUSTIN

Come with me, Felicity! It's the

only way out!

FELICITY

Austin, will I fit in the Nineties?

AUSTIN

If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!

FELICITY

Sorry!

AUSTIN

Don't worry baby it takes some getting

used to. Let me ask you Felicity, do

you feel any side effects from the

time travel?

FELICITY

I'm as healthy as a horse.

AUSTIN

I love you, Felicity.

FELICITY

And I love you.

AUSTIN

Do you want to get married?

FELICITY

Absolutely not.

AUSTIN

Thank God.
