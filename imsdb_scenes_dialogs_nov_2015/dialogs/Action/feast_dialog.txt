CHIEF

This is it.

LANKY

Why did it have to be these caves...

COLLEGE BOY

Is something wrong?

LANKY

(to College Boy)

Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

CHIEF

Let's get that first barrel.

COLLEGE BOY

What's with the awkward silence?

LANKY

You don't know?

CHIEF

Last winter, a man kidnapped a little

girl and holed up in one of these

caves. The cops had him pinned down

and began to move in. This guy started

shooting... but he wasn't aiming at

the officers...

(getting closer)

...he was firing at something inside.

CHIEF

When the dust cleared, all they found

was the little girl's shoes.

(beat)

With the feet still in 'em.

COLLEGE BOY

Ahh!!!

COLLEGE BOY

Assholes.

CHIEF

Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself

when my boss pulled that one on me.

LANKY

I went well beyond nearly.

CHIEF

What was that?

COLLEGE BOY

Once was plenty, fellas.

CHIEF

Shhhh...

MEAN GREEN

Stop it right there! You will not

rape Mother Nature one more day!

CHIEF

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

HIPPIE GROUP

Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't

dump in her any-more/Mother Nature

is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-

more...

CHIEF

Take it easy! We have a permit!

MEAN GREEN

(handing a document)

And we have an injunction from the

State to prevent any dumping in these

caverns! This is virgin land! The

aqueducts in these caves bring

drinking water to our families, and

its piping provides drainage for our

farms that enrich this barren land!

And it won't be tainted by waste of

any kind! Not now! Not ever!

CHIEF

Fine, just back off!

CHIEF

Let's roll... Now-now-now!

CHIEF

How do you guys always know where

we're going?

MEAN GREEN

(with a smirk)

I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

MEAN GREEN

Score one for the green team!!!

BEARDED CAMERAMAN

Hey, man, that was righteous, but I

need a shot with the sign up.

MEAN GREEN

We saved you today, ol' gal.

FUZZY

Oh, fuck!

MEAN GREEN

Sister, why do you always swing for

the fences?

FUZZY

(eyeing breach)

It's okay, but I... I think I see

something in there... something shiny.

FUZZY

Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

MEAN GREEN

Give me the keys!!!

CUT TO BLACK:

COACH

(into pay phone)

They took my laptop with my PowerPoint

presentation, my Blackberry, my

cell... And to top it off, my car

crapped out on the side of the road!

I'm not making the conference and I

have fourteen leads waiting for me.

You gotta help me out here. I'm not

kidding, I've have fourteen PRIMO

leads waiting in the lobby of the

Mariott... MARIOTT...

COACH

Son of a --

(deep breath, soothing)

In with anger, out with love.

PARA

(rolling away)

Hey...

BOZO

Shut up, fag.

EDGY CAT

(to Bozo)

You're late!

BOZO

Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em!

BEER GUY

I mean, we'd been together for so

long and then... bang! She drops me.

Since then, it's been like a damn

country song: she's gone, the car's

repossessed, and a father figure

made a pass at me. I'm not saying I

ever had it. But I have definitely

lost it.

(beat)

Now I haul this swill from armpit to

armpit. I used to be a model for

Christ's sake.

COACH

For what, may I ask?

BEER GUY

JC Penny. Spring wear.

COACH

You know, Chach, catching you at

this low point is pure serendipity.

BEER GUY

Why is that?

COACH

Because I take the rubble of man and

build superstars. In my briefcase

here is a doorway to a self-help

sensation. Give me a minute, because

I'd like to buy you a drink and change

your life forever. I have a brochure --

BARTENDER

Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets

'round here. We stick to chemistry.

And his drinks are on me.

BARTENDER

Was that the last keg?

BEER GUY

Yup, one keg of Beast for the

basement, then the truck's dry.

BARTENDER

If you're stayin', move the truck,

boss gets pissed about you using

primo parking.

BEER GUY

Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.

NEWSCASTER

...the search for the missing

protesters will be further complicated

by the unstable conditions of these

deep tunnels. Thus far, no sign of

life has been detected, yet town

officials are still optimistic.

NEWSCASTER

On a brighter note, or should I say

a darker note, tomorrow's solar

eclipse will bring out adults and

children alike for a citywide fair

of this metrological event. Stay

tuned for our man on the street to

take a closer look...

BOSS MAN (O.S.)

Listen, bud. I got a load ready to

move and your man's not here.

ROADIE (O.S.)

He's coming. Relax. And if he doesn't

show --

BOSS MAN (O.S.)

We got a problem.

TRAMPY

He said there was no reason I had to

stay a teller and that if I did good

work and didn't mess up, I could

become an assistant manager within

three years.

(pause)

Can you believe that?

ADULTERER

That sounds great.

TRAMPY

That sounds like bullshit! I could

be an assistant manager at The Lake

Arrowhead Casino for knowing the

fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty

in three months...

ADULTERER

Just bring the whole bottle.

BELLE

If I could made that kind of money,

I'd be in Hollywood next week.

TUFFY

'Round here, there are ways.

EDGY CAT

That cash is gonna look much better

in my pocket.

BOZO

(re: mounted head)

Ya know, that deer only looks scared

when you're in the room.

PARA

Excuse me, please.

EDGY CAT

Jesus!

EDGY CAT

That's all she wrote...

EDGY CAT

What?!

BOZO

Ohhh, now that's a rough one.

EDGY CAT

That's motherfuckin' impossible!

BOZO

(crude Oriental accent)

Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go

again?

EDGY CAT

Goddamn it! NO!

BOZO

Oh, come on. Crape Diem!

BOZO

Wake up! Check your pants!

GRANDPA

Get outta here.

BOZO

(mocking)

What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh?

(to Grandma)

How much for the whole night, Grandma?

GRANDMA

You should be so lucky.

GRANDPA

(re: his fists)

This one will stun ya, but this one

will put ya to sleep.

BOZO

Whoa!

BOZO

You boys wanna try your luck at the

loot?

BOZO

Come on, I'll even throw with my

left hand.

BOZO

Nothin' but a bunch of butts and

pussies in here!

BELLE

Shit! Shit! Shit!

BARTENDER

Don't sweat it, just clean it up

before he's done.

TUFFY

Keep these on, sweetheart.

CODY

Mommy, I want Nemo.

TUFFY

Mommy's working on it.

TUFFY

Let's get this over with.

BOSS MAN

I love a woman with enthusiasm.

BOZO

I got two hundred bucks says none of

you can beat me!

BARTENDER

Hey! Get quiet or get out.

BOZO

C'mon guys --

BOZO

Gimme some ACTION --

HERO

Unless you people want to die you'll

do what I say and you'll do it fast!

BARTENDER

You hold it right there, mister.

HERO

A storm of hell's coming down on

this place any minute!

BARTENDER

Drop the canon!

HERO

I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

BARTENDER

I'll drop you and not even think

about it!

HERO

Let me explain!

BARTENDER

You got one second to --

HERO

Take a good look and listen to me!

There's at least a four of these

things out there!

HERO

I saw one of them tear up five men

like they were corn on the cob!

(off silence, shock)

I don't know what they are. I don't

know where they came from. All I do

know is that these fuckers are fast,

nasty, and hungry.

HERO

And they can fly. Not to mention

they got claws like Ginsu knifes and

more teeth than a chainsaw.

HERO

They're like goddamn blood hungry

biker tattoos come to life. They're

clocking us. Right now. And we have

to lock this bar down!

(moving around)

That means doors, windows, drains,

and basements. We have to do it fast!

HERO

(looks to Belle)

You! Get on that phone. Call the

cops, National Guard, townies, whoever

kicks ass and get 'em out here.

HERO

Any questions?

BARTENDER

Who are you?

HERO

I'm the hero --

HEROINE

HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

HEROINE

GET DOWN!

EDGY CAT

I got you!

BOZO

Got 'cha!

HEROINE

Goddamn you!

ROADIE

You'll hit her!

BOZO

What the FUCK was that?

HEROINE

The jungle has a new king.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOSS MAN

Is it clear?!

BARTENDER

Yeah.

BOSS MAN

Is there a gun pointing at you?

BARTENDER

Nah, I got the gun.

BOSS MAN

Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!?

Who did it!?

BOSS MAN

My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin'

shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

BARTENDER

(motioning to Heroine)

Her fella.

HEROINE

My husband...

BOSS MAN

Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

HEROINE

He's dead.

BOSS MAN

What?

(noticing destruction)

What the hell happened down here?!

BOZO

I didn't do it! It was fuckin'

monsters, asshole!

BOSS MAN

Jesus Christ on the cross... someone

make sense.

HEROINE

Easy. We're surrounded by something

the likes none of you have ever seen

before. Some kind of animals. Real

fast, volatile, predators. One went

through three of your patrons like

nothing.

BOSS MAN

So, your dead hubby shot me twice,

three of my customers have been eaten,

and there are angry creatures outside?

HEROINE

He only shot you once.

BOSS MAN

Huh?

HEROINE

(re: Bartender)

He shot you the other time.

BARTENDER

It was an accident. Sorry.

ADULTERER

Look at it!

BOSS MAN

Fan-fuckin-tastic.

TUFFY

My god... what is that?

HEROINE

That's one piece of four problems.

BOSS MAN

Please elaborate.

HEROINE

That head over there, that's the

oldest of the bunch, looked like the

Grandpa. We caught the little one,

Junior, in the cooler there. As we've

seen, what he lacks in size he more

than makes up for in speed.

BARTENDER

And the rest of 'em?

HEROINE

Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are

still outside.

HEROINE

The next one is taller, but all out

of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

HEROINE (V.O.)

He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly

just the same.

HEROINE

I just took the eye out of the mother.

She calculates, guiding the attacks.

HEROINE

If you are face to face with her,

dive left.

ROADIE

And the last one is the --

HEROINE

Father. The biggest, the strongest...

HEROINE

No sign of any weaknesses. No sign

at all. He's an eating machine.

COACH

Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck

in.

HEROINE

That's not it. Four are here, but

there's three others... which I can't

account for.

HEROINE

We need to lock this place down. Is

everyone in this room?

TUFFY

Oh my god! My son! My SON!

HEROINE

Wait!

TUFFY

Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!

HEROINE

Stop her!

BARTENDER

Hey!

CODY

Mommy --

TUFFY

Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking?

Mommy is never gonna let you go!

HEROINE

Let's lock off this room.

TUFFY

(moving to exit)

Never, ever, never. Never, ever,

never, baby. I love you --

TUFFY

NOOOOOOOO!

HEROINE

Damn it.

BEER GUY

Oh god...

COACH

(to Tuffy)

Are you --

HEROINE

Just let her be... please.

(beat)

Is that the only phone?

BARTENDER

The back phone is wrecked, too.

BELLE

This is really happening. I can't

believe this is really happening.

GRANDPA

What'd you say?

GRANDMA

I didn't say anything.

PARA

Thank you, but I don't need any help --

BELLE

What's this? A power magnet or

something?

PARA

No. It's nothing.

BELLE

I didn't peg you for a con man.

PARA

Hey, it pays more than the couch.

BELLE

Lots of stuff around here does.

TRAMPY

Here!

TRAMPY

Hey!

ADULTERER

Back off!

BEER GUY

So, what now? Did those things leave?

BOZO

Why don't you go check it out?

BEER GUY

Fuck no.

ADULTERER

(into cell phone)

I have a signal! I have -- Diane?

Diane listen to me... get the kids

and get in the basement... do it

right now...

ADULTERER

I'll explain later. Not now! I'm at

a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT

UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT,

DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Damn

it! I lost the signal!

ADULTERER

Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get

outta here! I gotta go! My wife...

See my wife is alone... She could be

in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

HEROINE

I wouldn't do that.

ADULTERER

Fuck you, bitch!

HEROINE

You can risk your life, but not mine!

My daughter's no more than twenty

miles from here waiting for me. I

have just as much reason to leave

this place as you do. But I also

know that if they're here, then

they're not there yet.

HEROINE

You understand me?

ADULTERER

Get the fuck off...

HEROINE

You understand me!?

ADULTERER

Yes!

HEROINE

Now pull that tough boy shit again

and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!

ADULTERER

You can't keep me here. This is

bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is

fucking BULLSHIT!

HEROINE

We can't risk letting them in.

ADULTERER

(trembling, pissed)

Right.

BOZO

Anything?

PARA

Yeah, you got it.

BELLE

See! This has to be isolated. That's

a local broadcast.

NEWSCASTER

And now, we head to our man on the

scene with a live look at tomorrow's

event in Red Mountain.

HEROINE

My daughter's in Red Mountain.

NEWSCASTER

Can you hear us? Apparently we're

having some technical difficulties...

HEROINE

Oh no.

NEWSCASTER

Oh, there we go!

REPORTER

That's right, the crowds are lining

up early to witness tomorrow's

meteorological phenomenon.

REPORTER

But always remember, don't look

straight into the sun because a

special filter is needed to avoid

damaging your cornea.

REPORTER

And we're all looking forward to it

tomorrow. Back to you.

NEWSCASTER

Thank you. And in other news...

ROADIE

That studio's local, we can call in.

BOSS MAN

I have a short wave radio upstairs.

TRAMPY

I'm calling them... it's ringing!

ROADIE

They'd have a police scanner.

TRAMPY

(into cell)

Hello? Yes, we're at the United --

NEWSCASTER

...it has been reported that the

power outage --

TRAMPY

Oh no! Oh fucking no!

HEROINE

Keep it together! I came from the

east. That studio is south of here.

For all we know, north and west are

okay.

ROADIE

An associate of mine was coming in

from the north, ain't heard a word

from him in hours.

HEROINE

So, that leaves the west.

TUFFY

And Red Mountain. Your daughter.

HEROINE

Right.

BEER GUY

This is goddamn depressing.

BOSS MAN

I've got some tools and extra planks

in the kitchen, if we're on the same

page here.

HEROINE

Let's work.

BARTENDER

We'll it ain't pretty...

BOSS MAN

But its got teeth.

BOZO

I think it's hungry again.

HEROINE

We have to kill it.

(to Boss Man)

Can you help?

BOSS MAN

Fire in the hole!

BOZO

I think we got --

TUFFY

You're welcome.

TRAMPY

Jesus, it took all that? All those

bullets? How can we possibly fight

off the others?

HEROINE

Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears

and mouth. From what I've seen, it's

their only weakness.

ROADIE

(looking at the corpse)

Looks like they're soft on the inside

like any other animal. Trick is to

get in there and do the damage.

BELLE

Maybe we don't have to fight them.

BOZO

Right, let's just call 'em names.

COACH

Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have

your attention.

COACH

We have to think outside the box

here. We don't need to fight them,

we need to scare them. Scare them

right back. This is a species stand-

off. We just need to show them we're

not vulnerable. That we're formidable.

ADULTERER

How?

COACH

I need a stick.

COACH

Stand back.

COACH

Let's get that board down.

HEROINE

What are you doing?

COACH

Showing superiority. The scent of

their dead may drive them away.

BEER GUY

I don't see them.

COACH

Come on. Come onnnnnn.

BELLE

Is there a call, or something?

BOZO

See that you monkey fucks! That's

what you get when you mess with us!

Woman or man, I don't give a fuck!

Shit don't make me gay because you'll

be sucking my dick!

PARA

Sweet...

BEER GUY

It's working. I think it's working.

COACH

You see? What I tell you?

ADULTERER

Good christ! They're cannibals!

COACH

Oh dear...

TRAMPY

Oh... my... god.

PARA

What are they doing now?

BOZO

Dude, they're humpin'!

HEROINE

Get back!

BOZO

Any more ideas, Animal Planet?

COACH

I-I-I was just being proactive...

BEER GUY

(to Bozo)

Hey, you weren't helpin'!

BOZO

Go douche.

BARTENDER

What the hell now?

ADULTERER

We're stuck in here. That's what.

ROADIE

Hey, Miss?

ROADIE

If you don't mind me asking, how did

you run into these things?

BOSS MAN

More importantly, how did you run

away from these things?

HEROINE

Well, it all started about forty

hours ago...

DISSOLVE TO:

HEROINE

(into phone)

So, how is staying with Grandma

working out? Ya know, if you stare

into her glasses, you can see what

cards she is holding. But I didn't

tell you that.

HEROINE

Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night,

okay baby?

HEROINE

Hello? Charlie?

HERO

Holy mother of...

HEROINE

We barricaded ourselves in the cellar.

Then it was just listening. We heard

those things destroy an entire heard

of livestock. They just kept coming.

Closer and closer, consuming anything

in the way. Slashing, feeding and

licking the bones clean. Just when

we said our prayers, the first ray

of sun hit the house...

HEROINE

That first beam of sunlight drove

'em away. Somewhere. We called who

we could and then decided to run for

it. We didn't see a soul the whole

drive out. When the tank went dry,

we came upon a gas station to refill.

HERO

What's goin' on? The pumps are off.

TUBBS

There's nobody here --

HEROINE

They've been here!

HERO

Turn on the pump!

HEROINE

We had no time. All we knew was the

sun was dropping and we had to get

enough fuel to make it through the

night at 90 miles per hour...

HERO

Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck

it down.

HEROINE

It happened fast...

HERO

Move it!

HERO

Get in the car, baby.

HEROINE

That's when I saw three others...

just for a second.

HERO

Roll!

HEROINE

Close the roof!

HERO

Shit!

HERO

We made it!

HEROINE

It must have smelled the blood or

something. We buried the body and

got back on the main road when...

HERO

Break!

HERO

Go! Go! Go!

HERO

Look out!

HEROINE

And that's how I ended up here.

BARTENDER

And the head?

HEROINE

I don't want to talk about that.

BARTENDER

So, your husband ditched you?

HEROINE

No. It was wild out there. No time

to think. We just moved. He didn't

leave me. He just ran.

BARTENDER

Well, justice is funny.

ROADIE

The three from the gas pump are over

at the TV station? And you say there's

four here, huh?

HEROINE

It appears so.

COACH

There's five here now, actually.

BOZO

Yeah, thanks for that.

PARA

(to Heroine)

Hey, you lived on a farm, right?

HEROINE

Yeah.

ADULTERER

Do you think they're gone? I haven't

heard anything for a while, maybe

they're gone.

BELLE

Well, maybe they migrate?

HEROINE

As long as it's dark, they're around.

They hide, wait for you to drop your

guard, and then attack.

TRAMPY

How can you be so sure? You said

yourself this started a day ago.

HEROINE

We learned fast.

BOZO

We? We learned fast? You are all

that is left of we. No offense

Pocohantas, but I think someone else

should play "Chief" tonight. Someone

that knows the lay of the land.

(beat)

Like me.

HEROINE

Fine.

ADULTERER

Maybe these things are like locusts

or something and only come out for a

few days to feed. This could just be

a part of their life cycle.

BELLE

Somebody's gotta know something about

these things. This stuff just doesn't

happen out of the blue.

BOZO

You!

GRANDPA

Wha?

BOZO

You gotta know somethin', you're

old.

GRANDPA

I don't know a thing.

BOZO

Old people know stuff like this.

Legends, tall tales, shit like that.

GRANDPA

No!

BOZO

Spill it!

GRANDPA

I don't know anything!

BOZO

(to Grandma)

How 'bout you? Or do I have to get

rough?

GRANDMA

Heavens no!

BOZO

Come on! Think back!

GRANDPA

If I throw a stick, will you go away?

BOZO

That's just horse shit.

HEROINE

Relax, they don't know anything.

BOZO

Yeah... allegedly.

PARA

(to Heroine)

Hey, where was your farm?

HEROINE

(points to map)

East. Why?

PARA

Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter

livestock?

HEROINE

Previous owners did, I think.

COACH

What are you talking about?

PARA

Slaughterhouse run-off used to be

drained into piping that ran through

the mountains.

PARA

Earthquakes often cracked the piping

and those flow lines were condemned,

but never drained.

COACH

Cheese n' rice...

TRAMPY

I still don't get it.

PARA

What I am saying is... there's a

distinct possibility that what we

are up against is the result of steady

stream of blood and tissue that has

been leaking into the caves. And a

day ago... something broke out.

BOZO

The first order of business is gettin'

a big fuckin' tampon in that cave!

PARA

Nope, that wouldn't do it.

BARTENDER

I wouldn't do that.

BOZO

They're probably on to the next buffet

by now. There's a retirement home up

the road, they'd be easy pickings.

HEROINE

(to Adulterer)

Careful.

ADULTERER

I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

HEROINE

Everyone stay in the middle of the

room! Off the walls! NOW!

HEROINE

Now, does everyone agree that they

are still out there?

HEROINE

(to Bozo)

'Eh, Chief?

BOZO

...Duh.

TRAMPY

He's out cold.

BELLE

I know some first aid if we have a

kit. Do we?

BOSS MAN

In the kitchen, under the sink.

HEROINE

No one goes anywhere alone. Least of

all, unarmed.

TUFFY

(to Coach)

There's some sweats in my bag behind

the bar.

COACH

Thanks.

ROADIE

You're a clever man.

(re: Bozo)

Why do you take shit from him?

PARA

Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my

brother. Que sera-sera.

ROADIE

Your brother, huh?

PARA

Yep.

ROADIE

Same parents?

PARA

Look man, I read books. He reads

bumper stickers.

HEROINE

Alright, we need to stay alert and

for everyone to take a role.

(to Boss Man)

You gotta have some guns or weapons

around here.

BOSS MAN

I got my .38 here. That's six shots

and two refills. Downstairs, I have

locker with a sawed-off and some

gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes

of shells.

BARTENDER

I got shells, too. Box and a half

tops. Machete behind the bar.

HEROINE

Okay, well that's something.

ROADIE

So we've got guns, kitchen knives,

pipes, fire and sticks.

BEER GUY

I might be able to do something with

the bottles.

GRANDPA

You're gonna need a whole lot more

than that to get outta here alive.

BOZO

Oh, now you have something to say?

GRANDPA

You young'uns worry about weapons,

I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.

BOZO

Oh? And what's that?

GRANDPA

Sit still, look less like a meal.

BOZO

That's for bears and sharks, chunky

chew.

HEROINE

Alright, what else do we have? Can

we somehow contact the outside world?

TRAMPY

I can't get anybody. I don't even

know if I have a signal anymore.

BEER GUY

I have a CB in my truck, we could

get some help out here.

BARTENDER

Who the hell would you call?

BEER GUY

Anyone.

BOZO

Do you drive a short beer bus or

something? You go out there, you get

eaten. You stay in here, you get

eaten. Anyone comes to help, they

get eaten. Don't you see a pattern

here, Spuds Makenzie?

BEER GUY

Then I guess we should just give up.

BOZO

(re: Trampy)

Believe me, I'd love to save the day

and get some heroic snatch, but it's

not in the cards, partner.

HEROINE

(to Boss Man)

You said you had a short wave radio.

TRAMPY

Where?

BARTENDER

Upstairs.

BOSS MAN

Go for it. It's by the far wall.

Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.

HEROINE

Good. I'm heading to the basement

for supplies.

(to Bozo)

And you're going upstairs.

BOZO

Let's not get carried away...

HEROINE

Step up, Chief.

BOZO

So that's how it is?

(hands out)

Fine! Shotgun, please.

BOZO

(to Bartender)

You're coming with, portly. 'Cause

if I'm attacked, I want a fat man

close by.

BARTENDER

I'll wait by the door.

BOZO

Now who else is comin'?

GRANDPA

(rising from his seat)

I'll go with ya.

BOZO

What are you gonna do? Throw your

teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

BOZO

You! Zorba! You're coming too!

(to Heroine)

Now gimme the keys.

HEROINE

No. You're locked in.

BOZO

What?

HEROINE

Those two will be on the other side

waiting for you. If you become food,

I don't want the only set of keys in

the belly of one of those things.

BOZO

Don't get your hopes up.

HEROINE

Any volunteers to head into the

basement with me?

TUFFY

I will.

BEER GUY

That's not a good idea.

BOSS MAN

With what happened upstairs --

TUFFY

Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have

no idea what is running through me

right now. No idea.

(to Heroine)

I'm ready.

HEROINE

Alright.

ROADIE

Count me in.

BEER GUY

Me too.

BOZO

Alright you two, I don't want to

hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the

key, wrong key, ain't no key here."

When I want out, I want out, ok?

BARTENDER

(displaying keys)

They're right here.

COACH

We've got your back, bro.

BOZO

Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

BOZO

Wish me luck...

BOZO (O.S.)

I'm okay! I'm okay!

BOZO

Come on. Come on. Come on.

BOZO

Geeezzzus.

(moving gingerly)

Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths.

Easy steps.

BELLE

How are you holding up?

BOSS MAN

Well...

BELLE

What is this?

BOSS MAN

Morphine. My magic potion. I need a

few drops.

BOSS MAN

You should try a little, it'll calm

your nerves. Works like a charm.

BELLE

No other time than now, right?

BOSS MAN

Wait, before you do that, help me

move. There's a small room off the

kitchen where I can lay down.

BELLE

But --

BOSS MAN

It's much safer in there. Trust me.

ROADIE

Stay on your toes everybody.

HEROINE

What's this?

ROADIE

You don't need to know what that is.

BEER GUY

There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.

COACH

Come on, bro.

BOZO

Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

BOZO

HAAAA!

BOZO

Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat!

BARTENDER

If he doesn't shut up...

COACH

He is human kabob.

BELLE

Doesn't your foot hurt?

BOSS MAN

I can't feel a thing, Hon.

BELLE

(touching his crotch)

How 'bout now?

BOSS MAN

You're a bad girl, aren't you.

BELLE

Um-hmmm.

BOSS MAN

The girl's got rhythm.

BOSS MAN

There it is.

ROADIE

This is all junk.

BEER GUY

This could come in handy.

HEROINE

Let's get everything upstairs.

HEROINE

I'm sorry.

TUFFY

Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.

HEROINE

I admire your strength.

TUFFY

Trust me, I plan on having a full

breakdown when this is over, but for

now, we all have to be strong, right?

HEROINE

This is my daughter, Charlie. She's

all I'm after.

TUFFY

(fighting back tears)

Oh...

HEROINE

And I'm gonna need your strength,

every bit of it.

TUFFY

You have it.

HEROINE

Good. But still do me a favor.

TUFFY

Name it.

HEROINE

(with a wink)

Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

TUFFY

(tiny smile)

Deal.

BOZO

Hello? Anyone there? We need help

out here at the United Nations Tavern.

Send guns, tanks, and all that shit.

10-4. S.O.S.

BELLE

You wanna see, baby?

BOSS MAN

Hell yeah.

BELLE

How much you got?

BOSS MAN

How much I got, what?

BELLE

How much you got to see the show?

BOSS MAN

You don't understand, sweety. Daddy

doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for

free. But you do get points for being

horny on a night like this.

BELLE

What?

BOSS MAN

You can't expect a man to buy a car

without a test drive first, can you?

BELLE

Um, hmm --

BOSS MAN

Now wiggle that sweet little ass

over here and sit on Daddy's face, I

wanna do some appraising.

BOZO

Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling

all cars! Calling all cars! We need

help at the United Nations Tav --

BOZO

Shit!

BOZO

Double shit!

BOZO (O.S.)

Okay, I'm ready to come out now!

BARTENDER

Oh!

BOZO

"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh"

mean?

BOZO

HEY! OPEN IT!!!

BARTENDER

Wha?

BOZO

OPEN THE DOOR!!!

BELLE

What was that?

BOSS MAN

Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

BOSS MAN

NO! NO! NO!

COACH

Great god, why do you damn me?!

BOZO

GET ME OUTTA HERE!!!

PARA

Oh please, no.

BOSS MAN

They're getting in! Somebody help!

BOZO

HELP!!! GODDAMN IT!!!

BARTENDER

The key broke off!

HEROINE

(to Coach)

Move it!

BOZO (O.S.)

HELP ME PLEASE!!!

BOSS MAN

HELLLLLP!!!

BOZO

HELLLLLLLLP!!!

PARA

I thought that was it for a second

there.

TRAMPY

What happened?

BOZO

I got Papa in the stones.

(beat)

He's neutered.

PARA

Whoa... good one...

ROADIE

That back room is sealed shut.

HEROINE

I told you to stay in the main room.

BOSS MAN

Yeah... I will. I will. Promise.

COACH

(rising, full of brawn)

If they can't reproduce anymore --

we are one step closer! A big step!

Now is the time to band together. We

need to rise up against these monsters

of the night! Those creatures are no

match for the human spirit! We can

do it! We just need to believe in

each other! In all of us! We need to

make a stand! Right here! Right now!

BOZO

Dude, are you gay?

HEROINE

We know what not to do. We must stay

focused and together. The beasts

will find a breach. We gotta find a

way out before they find a way in.

TUFFY

Let's run for the cars, cause mass

confusion.

BARTENDER

The lot's too damn far, that's

surefire suicide.

HEROINE

(to Boss Man)

What?

BOSS MAN

What?

HEROINE

You know what.

BOSS MAN

I don't know shit.

HEROINE

(to Roadie)

You. What was that door downstairs?

BOSS MAN

Wait, wait, wait.

HEROINE

Don't bullshit me.

BARTENDER

It's a tunnel.

BARTENDER

It runs about a hundred yards and

spits out on the backside of that

hill down the way.

HEROINE

What's it for?

HEROINE

What's it for!?

BOSS MAN

Grass, man. I grow pot down there.

HEROINE

Does the tunnel spit out near a car?

BOSS MAN

It spits out behind the parking lot.

BOSS MAN

My truck is near, but it ain't nearly

big enough to haul the whole lot.

HEROINE

It's a shot. Is it gassed up?

BOSS MAN

Fully.

HEROINE

Four door?

BOSS MAN

Two.

HEROINE

How many can it hold?

BOSS MAN

Six.

HEROINE

Max?

BOSS MAN

Seven.

HEROINE

It's gonna fit thirteen.

BOSS MAN

Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit.

HEROINE

(with hand out)

Keys.

ROADIE

What're you planning?

HEROINE

Three of us go. Two to defend, one

to drive. We back up to the bar and

then tear ass out of here.

BOSS MAN

Sounds sketchy.

HEROINE

Let me make this clear; if we stay,

we die.

ROADIE

Give 'em to me, I'm going.

BARTENDER

You're trusting that con? He'll ditch

us and never look back.

ROADIE

Fuck you too.

BARTENDER

Get in line!

HEROINE

Hey! I'm not trusting him either,

that's why I'm going with.

COACH

"Courage is being scared to death,

but saddling up anyway."

(off blank stares)

The Duke. I will go.

HEROINE

This is it. They have this place

surrounded, but if we go under them

we might just make it.

BARTENDER

This is a bottleneck waiting to

happen.

BOZO

This one's great under pressure. I

wish you luck.

HEROINE

The rest of you prepare the weapons,

whatever you got left. 'Cause when

we crash through those walls, we're

bringin' death with us.

COACH

No, I don't believe in guns.

BARTENDER

This ain't time for a political

stance.

COACH

This doesn't run out of ammo.

BARTENDER

Got ya.

BOZO

Hey!

BOZO

When you get to that truck... drive

it like you stole it.

TRAMPY

How does it feel?

ADULTERER

Lousy.

TRAMPY

You still have one left.

ADULTERER

Yes, the silver lining.

TRAMPY

It serves you right for cheating.

ADULTERER

Spare me.

TRAMPY

I figure it's karma. You wronged me

and you wronged your wife, so this

is karma biting you on the ass, or

in your case... in the eye.

BOZO

Oh yeah?

TRAMPY

It could be worse, you could be dead.

Then again, the climax is upon us.

BOZO

(re: Trampy's hair)

Ya know, that's not a bad look on

you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd

hook it up.

TRAMPY

I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

BOZO

Tease.

ADULTERER

Leave her alone.

BOZO

Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet

contest... starting now.

BOZO

Ya know, in situations of duress, I

have found that women are attracted

to my authority.

ROADIE

(to Heroine)

You handle yourself pretty well. You

a cop or a criminal?

HEROINE

Neither. Just a farmer.

ROADIE

Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?

HEROINE

I just think about my husband and

daughter... and the rest is easy.

HEROINE

Easy.

ROADIE

This place is creepy in the daytime,

too. Ready?

ROADIE

Scared?

COACH

No. You?

ROADIE

Of course not. I fight monsters all

the time.

(gripping the door)

On three.

COACH

One... two... three!!!

COACH

Well, look at that.

COACH

Hey, little fella.

HEROINE

Let's go.

COACH

Looks like a brothel for plants.

ROADIE

Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

BOZO

Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!

BEER GUY

What do you know?

BOZO

I know you're doing it wrong.

BEER GUY

Prove it.

BOZO

Move aside, princess.

COACH

(to Roadie)

You and I are similar. We both have

accents. We both travel a lot. We

both don't really have homes...

ROADIE

You should be quiet.

COACH

I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous.

HEROINE

Quiet.

COACH

It's just that this seems like the

opportune time for someone to be

horribly... offed.

ROADIE

What did I say?

COACH

Sorry. I'm done now.

BOZO

You don't want the rag touching booze,

that way you can hold it and ensure

it explodes when you throw it.

PARA

You sure? I thought the rag had to

touch?

BOZO

I'm sure.

BOZO

Perfecto. What we should do, though,

is put those peanut barrels to use.

Fill 'em with booze and line up some

planks. If the walls come down... we

hit 'em Donkey Kong style.

PARA

Genius.

BEER GUY

You aren't nearly as dumb as you

look, are you?

BOZO

Next time, look within. Stereotyping

can be ugly and hurtful.

BOZO

Excuse me for being forward, but I'm

curious about your dimensions.

ROADIE

Hold up. You hear something?

ROADIE

They're trying to burrow through the

tunnel walls.

HEROINE

Move.

COACH

Like moles these things.

ROADIE

Duck!

ROADIE

Stay down!

HEROINE

Go! The bitch is mine!

HEROINE

Look out!

ROADIE

The shells are wet!

COACH

Grab onto ceiling and get out of

water!

ROADIE

What?

COACH

Do it!!!

COACH

(to Heroine)

Get out of water!!!

HEROINE

You fuck with my family.

(aiming shotgun)

I fuck right back!

HEROINE

Oh shit.

COACH

They will write stories of your

bravery.

ROADIE

If there's anybody left.

HEROINE

Send it up! Send it up!

TUFFY

Hey! Hey! She's in the shaft!

HEROINE

Move it! Move it! Move it!

BEER GUY

Come on!

BOZO

Ol' Crazy Horse has seen it.

TUFFY

Shut up!

HEROINE

Goddamn it!

TUFFY

It stopped. It fuckin' stopped!

TRAMPY

Do something!

HEROINE

I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR!

ADULTERER

Stop!

TRAMPY

What the fuck are you doing?!

ADULTERER

They can't get in here! We agreed!

They'll get us!

TUFFY

She can make it!

ADULTERER

I will not die because of her!

BARTENDER

Don't be stupid, drop the gun!

TRAMPY

YOU'RE KILLING HER!

ADULTERER

They'll get in! We'll all die!

BOZO

Welcome back.

HEROINE

F-f-fuck you.

BARTENDER

What the hell happened?

TUFFY

You okay?

HEROINE

I think they made it.

HEROINE

Stop trying to get people killed. It

is getting very old.

HEROINE

What's this?

BOZO

Ingenuity, baby. Ingenuity.

HEROINE

(to Bartender)

I need some shells.

BARTENDER

I have two left.

BARTENDER

Make it count.

HEROINE

Let's prepare ourselves, they ought

to be here with the truck any minute.

BOSS MAN

Bullshit.

BOSS MAN

If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay

right here, wait for sunrise, then

walk on out of here.

HEROINE

That's your choice, but this is going

to get a whole lot worse before it

gets any better.

BOSS MAN

If all of you run for it, they won't

care about lil ol' me. They like the

food that moves...

BOSS MAN

OHHH!!!

HEROINE

Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!!

PARA

HELP ME!!!

BOZO

Bonsai!

BOZO

Hot potato!!!

BEER GUY

We're gonna die!

ADULTERER

What the hell?!

HEROINE

Settle down!

TRAMPY

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

BARTENDER

What's that?

TUFFY

They didn't make it.

ROADIE

RUN!!!

BARTENDER

That wall's coming down!

BOZO

Commence Plan B!

HEROINE

What's Plan B?

BOZO

Just watch the floor and keep the

others safe!

BOZO

Bomb's away!!!

HEROINE

Now!

BOZO

One down, one to go!!!

HEROINE

(to Bartender)

Help me!

HEROINE

Come on!

BARTENDER

I can't hold him!!!

HEROINE

Do something!!!

TUFFY

CHOKE ON IT!!!

BARTENDER

God...

BOZO

I need to get your number.

HEROINE

Come on, I'll help you.

GRANDPA

No thank you, we're content.

HEROINE

I'm not leaving anyone behind.

GRANDMA

Maybe next time, dear.

HEROINE

She's still out here.

HEROINE

Stay put.

HEROINE

Where are you... come on...

HEROINE

Come on! Come on!

HEROINE

Come and get me you blood-chugging

CUNT!

TRAMPY

You got her? You got her!

HEROINE

Not for long, we gotta burn it.

HEROINE

Come on! Let's blow this thing!

BEER GUY

When this lights, run like hell.

HEROINE

(catching lighter)

Here we go...

TUFFY

What is that?

HEROINE

She's calling for help.

BOZO

The fan has officially been buried

in the shit.

TRAMPY

We have to run --

HEROINE

Get to your cars!!!

BOZO

Motherfucker! Give him back!

BOZO

Oh Jesus!

PARA

HELLLPPP!

BOZO

I thought we lost you --

BOZO

You FUCKER!

TUFFY

(to Heroine)

Get in!

ADULTERER

Run and quit looking back!

BOZO

DO IT!

BOZO

Get me FUCK BIRDS!

BOZO

No you don't!

BOZO

VENGEANCE!

PARA

Oh Jesussss...

GRANDPA

We had a good run.

PARA

HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

BOZO

Hang on!

PARA

Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

BARTENDER

Oh shit!

PARA

NOOO!!!

PARA

COME ON! GODDAMN IT!

BOZO

Brother!!!

ADULTERER

Shit!

BOZO

(overly endearing)

I meant to tell you so much!

GRANDPA

Close your eyes, hon.

BOZO

YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!!

BOZO

Motherfucker!!!

BOZO

Lord, if I die, bury me upside down

so the world can KISS MY ASS!

BARTENDER

I think we're in the clear --

TUFFY

Are you okay?!

HEROINE

I don't know, I think --

ADULTERER (O.S.)

Hey!

ADULTERER

Are you two all right? They left! We

made it! I think we made it!

TUFFY

They'll be back.

HEROINE

We're safe until dark, but we need

to find other people.

HEROINE

You know where the IGA grocery store

is over in Red Mountain?

ADULTERER

Um, yeah, ten miles west.

HEROINE

They have a bomb shelter.

HEROINE

We'll meet in three hours?

ADULTERER

I don't wanna go home alone... I

don't wanna see what might have...

TUFFY

Don't worry about that. Just go.

ADULTERER

I'm sorry about your son. I really

am.

ADULTERER

Where are you two going?

HEROINE

We're going to get my little girl.

ADULTERER

I wish you luck.

HEROINE

Oh no...

TUFFY

They're alive!

ADULTERER

I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

HEROINE

It's right up there, in the back of

the store.

HEROINE

Where is everyone?

ADULTERER

I don't know, I just got here. Did

you find your girl?

HEROINE

She's supposed to already be here.

TUFFY

Your family?

TUFFY

I'm sorry.

HEROINE

This place is a ghost town.

ADULTERER

(pointing)

Look!

HEROINE

Charlie?

HEROINE

Charlie!

ADULTERER

Stop! There's something wrong!

HEROINE

Honey!?

TUFFY

Oh god.

CHARLIE

Mommy!

ADULTERER

It's a trap!

ADULTERER

(gurgling blood)

Run!!!

HEROINE

(a whisper)

I love you...

CUT TO BLACK:

THE MAN IN TAN

Relax. We know. We're the calvary.

THE MAN IN TAN

What happened to you?

BOZO

Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn

hero for Christ's sake!

GRANDMA

G'morning.

BOZO

Thanks for waitin' for me back there,

TUFFY

How'd you survive?

BOZO

I found a new weak spot on 'em, but

it damn ain't pretty getting to it.

HEROINE

Where are you taking us?

THE MAN IN TAN

A trauma center. We have doctors

waiting.

(off Heroine's pause)

You're in good hands now.

THE MAN IN TAN

Do it quick and spread the mess.

FADE OUT:

THE END
