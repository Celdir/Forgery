JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing

the nasty last night. Thanks for

that one. By the way, who the fuck

is Nancy?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling

her friends that you're hung like a

light switch.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes

the reach and... yes! Both balls

at the same time! One heck of a

double play!

JIMMY (O.C.)

And the sniff to finish it off.

3.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Fucking freak show.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY

Do you like that nigger?   Come on

nigger, do you like it?

PROSTITUTE

(humors him)

Oh yeah baby, I like it.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY (O.C.)

Okay, so. What was going through

your mind when I called you a

nigger?

PROSTITUTE

This costs you an extra fifty.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I know.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Well, what did it feel like?

4.

PROSTITUTE

It felt like nothing.

JIMMY (O.C.)

What do you mean?

PROSTITUTE

You ain't the first person to call

me a nigger when we was fucking.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(not surprised)

Oh.

PROSTITUTE

Johns call me nigger all the time.

Especially white guys. Nothing

new. Just dirty talk.

PROSTITUTE

That it?

PROSTITUTE

What about you? You like calling

me nigger? You get your nut off?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(calmly)

No.

PROSTITUTE

Then why'd ya call me that?

JIMMY (O.C.) (O.C.)

Have you ever wondered what it was

like to treat someone so completely

cruel that it was unthinkable?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I was trying to do the unthinkable

and unimaginable when I called you

that. I wanted to see if was even

possible for me to do that.

5.

PROSTITUTE

Yeah, so?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I think I want to die. Like I

don't deserve to live anymore.   And

that I will never want to do

something like that to someone

again.

PROSTITUTE

Why ya wanna die?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Because everyone hates me.

JIMMY (O.C.)

They hate me because I seek beauty

and appreciate destruction. They

hate my mind, my thoughts, my

imagination. They hate everything

about me. And I hate them.

PROSTITUTE

(trying not to care)

Really?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yep. Everyone. Everyone that

knows or who has ever met me.

PROSTITUTE

Your parents don't hate you. Look

at this room in this big 'ole house

you got.

JIMMY (O.C.)

My parents provide me with food and

shelter because they have been

conditioned by society into

thinking it's the appropriate thing

to do. In reality they can't stand

to be in the same room with me.

They're fascists, brainwashed, and

unforgiving.

(MORE)

6.

JIMMY (O.C.) (cont'd)

They dismiss my feelings of ill

regard towards them on simple

rebelliousness of youth, but that's

only because they are patently and

intentionally unaware of their own

hypocrisies.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(accidental condescension)

Do you understand me?

PROSTITUTE

You wanna know what I think?

JIMMY

Yes, I really do.

PROSTITUTE

I think you're a spoiled ass white

boy, thinks you everything, but you

don't know shit. All you do is

bullshit complain and there's folks

out there that'd kill for all this.

PROSTITUTE

I don't feel sorry for you.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(calmly)

No one is asking you to.   Thank you

for letting me film you.

JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)

So Melissa talked Gary into the SL

instead of the seven series. I

couldn't believe it.

JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)

They paid way too much.

JUDY'S DAD

I strictly buy American anyway.

JUDY'S MOM (O.C.)

Where you going honey?

JUDY

Bathroom.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

Can we start already?

JIMMY (O.C.)

One second.

9.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Who do you hate most in the world

and why?

JUDY

(kind of bitchy)

Why? Who cares?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I do.

JUDY

God, I just wanted to come up here

to say "hi" and get away from my

parents' bullshit for like two

seconds and you have to put the

stupid camera in my face.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Now we're onto something.

JUDY

You're weird Jimmy. You were weird

when we were kids and now you're

just getting weirder.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Is that why you had a crush on me?

JUDY

(scoffs)

Yeah right.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You didn't have a crush on me?

JUDY

You're a loser. You're twenty one

and you're still living with your

parents.

10.

JUDY

I heard that you got kicked out of

college because you tried to talk

your roommate into killing himself.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Where'd you hear that?

JUDY

From everyone.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You wanna know the truth?

JUDY

Yeah.

JIMMY (O.C.)

He asked me if he should kill

himself. I told him to look inside

himself for the answer. I didn't

tell him to. I didn't tell him not

to. I said he shouldn't be afraid

of the unknown. If he was going to

kill himself, I wanted him to do it

for the right reasons.

JUDY

I swear to God, you're a fucking

psycho.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Like you're normal.

JUDY

More than you.

JIMMY (O.C.)

If I'm such a freak, what are you

doing in my room?

JUDY

I was bored.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I wanna show you something?

11.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

I can't believe I'm doing this.

JUDY

(offended; turns to

camera)

Can you start the tape?

JUDY

Don't think this means I like you

or anything.

JUDY

And as soon as this is over I'm

going back downstairs.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(in bedroom)

That's Mrs. Holzclaw's car. She's

your P.E. teacher, right? I hated

her too.

12.

JIMMY (O.C.)

And Bill McAllister... I went to

school with his brother. They're

both dicks.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(in bedroom)

I planted an ounce of weed in his

locker then sent an anonymous

letter to Principal Lipsky.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I took care of her too.

13.

JUDY

Why did you do that?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I had to.

JUDY

Why?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I did it for you.

14.

JUDY

I don't understand.

JUDY

Please tell me.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I felt like if I didn't save you

then no one else would.

JUDY

(screams)

Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!

JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)

Jimmy! What the hell are you guys

doing up there?

FEMALE PARTY GUEST #1

(covers her mouth)

Oh my God!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey, great party, huh? I'm making

a tape for my parents. Want to say

something to them?

JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)

Jimmy!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You

want to say anything to yourself?

JIMMY'S DAD

That's enough.

JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)

(muffled)

Get out! Now!

16.

CAMERA ON:

DR. WALTERS

Jimmy, we discussed this. You

can't tape our sessions. It's not

allowed.

DR. WALTERS

You know, you can't film someone

who doesn't want their image and

voice recorded. Technically,

you're actually breaking the law.

DR. WALTERS

Does your defiance make you feel

more powerful?

DR. WALTERS

Filming people makes you feel like

you're in control of the situation

doesn't it?

DR. WALTERS

I can sit here as long as you can.

You're not going to be able to

force me to participate in your

little game here.

17.

DR. WALTERS

Jimmy, this isn't something that

friends do to each other is it?

DR. WALTERS

Jimmy, put the camera away, please.

DR. WALTERS

You're wasting your time and mine,

Jimmy. We could be doing something

productive.

DR. WALTERS

That's enough.

DR. WALTERS

Put it away.

DR. WALTERS

Now Jimmy!

18.

DR. WALTERS

Come on Jimmy.

DR. WALTERS

Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

No. No filming.     I'm leaving, I

swear.

JIMMY

Okay, okay. Wait.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY (O.C.)

Say what you said to me before.

JUDY

I don't know how I said it.

19.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Paraphrase it then.

JUDY

Do what?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Say it like you did before but it

doesn't have to be exactly the

same.

JUDY

You mean paraphrase it.

JIMMY (O.C.)

That's what I said.

JUDY

I didn't hear you.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Are you ready?

JUDY

I'm waiting for you.

JIMMY (O.C.)

OK.

JUDY

Tell me when.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Now.

JUDY

You want me to paraphrase it?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(impatient)

Yes!

JUDY

I can't remember what I said.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Then just ad-lib.

20.

JUDY

Ad-lib?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yes.

JUDY

I don't know what that means.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(getting frustrated)

It means make it up.

JUDY

(confused)

Do you want me to make something up

or paraphrase what I did the first

time?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Let's take a break.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

I'm not good on camera.    It makes

me nervous.

JIMMY

Forget about the camera.   Talk to

me.

JUDY

OK.

JIMMY

Tell me what you said earlier.

About me about how you felt when

you saw the video.

21.

JUDY

(relaxes)

It felt like someone had been

reading my mind.

JIMMY

Go on.

JUDY

It was like someone had jumped into

my head and watched what was being

projected.

JIMMY

And earlier, what you said about

God.

JIMMY

(off her look)

Tell me.

JUDY

I said that it felt like God had

sent someone to protect me, and to

look out for me.

JUDY

And I said that you are the only

person in my life who has ever

looked after me like that.

JUDY

God, I hate it when you film me

crying!

22.

JUDY (O.C.)

How do you like it, huh? How do

you like having a camera shoved

right up your ass?

JUDY (O.C.)

Do you like it? Do you?

JIMMY

I don't like it or dislike.   I'm

used to it.

JIMMY

Generally I'd place the camera

further away from my nose, but if

this is your preferred shooting

style then I guess I'll have to

adjust to it.

JIMMY

How's this work for you?

JUDY (O.C.)

Give me a break.

JIMMY

OK.

JUDY (O.C.)

So... why do you have to film

everything?

JIMMY

I don't film everything.

JUDY (O.C.)

Why do you like to film me crying?

23.

JIMMY

I don't.

JUDY (O.C.)

Then why do you?

JIMMY

Because it's rare that I get to

find someone that lets their

emotions go. When a person is

crying, I mean truly crying, or

truly laughing or smiling or

frowning or gasping. For a few

seconds or minutes I get a chance

to see that person's soul. And

really, now that you've forced me

to think about it. I think it's a

very rare and beautiful thing to be

afforded that opportunity.

JIMMY

Anything else?

JUDY (O.C.)

Why me?

JIMMY

Because.

JIMMY

Why do you think?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Why you and why me? Why are we

together right now?

24.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Go ahead say it. I want you to.     I

know what you're going to say so

just say it.

JUDY

Stop.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(soft)

Tell me.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(bullies her)

Tell me!

JUDY

(blows her top)

Because we're both fucking weird!

JUDY

Because we're the two weirdest kids

in the world. And God made us for

each other and I fucking love you,

and you did all this because you

love me too, and fuck everyone and

everything that doesn't get it!

JUDY

That's right, right?

CAMERA ON:

JUDY (O.C.)

Where are you taking me?

25.

JIMMY

To a beautiful place.

JUDY (O.C.)

Where?

JIMMY

Chuck E. Cheese.

JUDY (O.C.)

No seriously.

JIMMY

I can't tell you.    It'll ruin it.

JUDY (O.C.)

Fine.

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy, can I ask you something?

JIMMY

Anything.

JUDY (O.C.)

Do you hate your parents?

JIMMY

Yes, but I understand them.

JUDY (O.C.)

What's to understand?

JIMMY

Lots of things.

JUDY (O.C.)

Like what?

JIMMY

I understand that my ascension into

young adulthood triggered their

descent into mid-life crisis.

Generally when an only child leaves

the nest, the parents begin

reassessing their own lives. They

see us as a younger, better version

of themselves.

(MORE)

26.

JIMMY (cont'd)

They feel abandoned by our need for

privacy and insecure because we no

longer seek their approval. They

used to take us to baseball games

and cover our scrapes with

bandages, but once we no longer

need Mom to nurture our bruises or

Dad to be our hero it puts their

roles and subsequent sense of self

worth into question.

JUDY (O.C.)

How do you know all these things?

JIMMY

When you don't have any friends,

don't play sports, don't go out,

have no one talk to, nowhere to go,

no one to listen to you, or no one

to help you figure things out, you

sort of have to figure things out

by yourself. And without any of

those things I have nothing but

time to think about stuff.

JUDY (O.C.)

You are SO smart.

JIMMY

You are so beautiful.

JUDY (O.C.)

You think I'm pretty?

JIMMY

I think you're the most beautiful

person I have ever met. The most

beautiful person in the universe.

JUDY (O.C.)

No one has ever told me that.

JIMMY

Get used to hearing it.

JUDY (O.C.)

Do you think I'm smart?

JIMMY

Yes.

27.

JUDY (O.C.)

Do you think I'm fat?

JIMMY

Yes.

JUDY (O.C.)

How could you say that? I only way

a hundred and ten pounds.

JIMMY

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said

flat. As in flat chested.

JUDY (O.C.)

I am not FLAT!

JIMMY

Prove it.

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't have to prove it.   Here

look.

JIMMY

I still can't tell.

JUDY (O.C.)

I wear a full B cup.

JIMMY

Show me.    Take em out.

JUDY (O.C.)

I am not going to take them out!

You take yours out.

JIMMY

It's already out.

28.

JUDY (O.C.)

I can't believe you did that.

JIMMY (O.C.)

That's why I did it. Now come on.

I showed you mine, let me see

yours.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Wow.    Give me the camera.

JUDY (O.C.)

No.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Please, pretty, pretty please with

sugar on top.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Here, I'll pull over.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Let me see 'em.

JIMMY (O.C.)

That doesn't count. Come on, for

real this time.

JUDY

I'm embarrassed.

29.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Don't be.    You can trust me.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You can. You can trust me with

your life.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(gently)

Please.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Will you take off your bra?

JUDY

(struggling)

I just realized something.

JIMMY (O.C.)

What's the matter?

JUDY

I just showed you my breasts and I

saw your penis and we haven't even

kissed.

JUDY

You haven't even asked me to be

your girlfriend and I did that.

I'm a slut.

(wiping her eyes)

I don't want to be a slut.

30.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Will you be my girlfriend?

JUDY

Yes.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Can I kiss you?

JUDY

(sniffling)

Yes. Will you turn off the camera?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I want this moment to be captured

forever. I'd rather not kiss you

at all than waste the opportunity

to document the most beautiful

moment of my life.

JUDY

(whispers)

I wanna see your smiley face again.

JUDY

(whispering)

Turn the camera off. Turn the

camera off. Turn it off.

CAMERA ON:

31.

JUDY (O.C.)

How do you feel?

JIMMY

Relaxed, happy, confident, studly,

excited, relieved, delighted... I

love you Judy.

JUDY (O.C.)

You do?

JIMMY

Very much so. I always have.

JUDY (O.C.)

Me too.

JUDY (O.C.)

Do you want to pull over again?

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY

Are you getting this?

JIMMY

Come on.   Are you getting this?

JUDY (O.C.)

This is where you wanted to take

me?

JIMMY

Yeah, what's the matter?

32.

JUDY (O.C.)

I wanna go home.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY

Don't fuck this up.    Please don't

fuck this up.

JIMMY

Just try to be normal.

(screaming)

Just be normal! God damn it why do

you have to fuck everything up?

JIMMY

Be normal.     Be normal.   Be normal!

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

(big smile)

Hi.

33.

JIMMY (O.C.)

So how do you feel now, right at

this moment?

JUDY

I don't know.

(trying)

That was soooo good.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You were good. What got into you?

JUDY

I don't know. I've just really

been wanting you lately. Really

bad.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Why's that?

JUDY

I'm embarrassed.    I can't say.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Now you have to tell me.

JUDY

It was after yesterday.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yesterday?

JUDY

Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot

that gun.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You were crying. I wanted to kill

myself after I did that. You were

scared and you were shaking. It

was the most awful thing I ever

did. I didn't think I'd ever see

you again.

34.

JUDY

I was scared at first. Really

scared. I didn't expect it to be

so loud and you looked so mean.

But then I got home and started

thinking about it. About how your

muscles looked and how dangerous it

all seemed. It made me like... all

excited, and like...

JIMMY (O.C.)

Horny?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Here.    Hold this.

JUDY (O.C.)

Where you going?

JIMMY

One sec!

JUDY (O.C.)

That is so hot!

JIMMY

My dad keeps it in his closet.

Here.

JUDY (O.C.)

It's heavy.

35.

JIMMY

Now I see the appeal.     Give me the

camera.

JUDY

What do you think of this?

JUDY

Do you like that?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yes.

JIMMY (O.C.)

That is SO hot.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Fuck!   It's my parents!

CAMERA ON:

36.

JIMMY'S DAD

Hi sweety.

JIMMY'S MOM

Are you ready for me, you fucking

slut?

JIMMY'S DAD

Not quite.

37.

JIMMY'S MOM

I don't feel like waiting. Hurry

up bitch. What do you have left to

do?

JIMMY'S DAD

I just need to put on my makeup.

JIMMY'S MOM

Come on slut.

38.

JIMMY

Hi mom.     Hi dad.   What are you guys

up to?

JIMMY'S DAD

What the fuck are you doing here?

JIMMY'S MOM

(to his dad)

I told you he would find out you

fucking freak! No wonder he's a

fucking psycho. Look a his father.

JIMMY'S DAD

Turn off the that fucking camera!

Turn off that fucking camera right

fucking now god damn it!

JIMMY

Gee dad, what do you say the two of

us go out to the front yard and

throw some ball together? We'll

have a nice friendly game of catch.

JIMMY'S DAD

You little mother fucker.     Turn off

that fucking camera!

39.

JIMMY'S MOM

Stop it!     You're going to kill him.

JIMMY'S DAD

Bitch!

JIMMY'S MOM

Fuck you! You think you know me?

You don't know me! You piece of

shit!

JIMMY

(laughing)

Mom!

JIMMY'S MOM

You little beast! You want to film

something? Film this!

JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)

Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please

someone call me Nancy. My name is

Nancy.

JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)

(crying hysterically)

Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... Jimmy

please call him "Nancy" for the

love of God. Call your daddy

Nancy. Call him Nancy...!

40.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Take me out to the ball game, take

me out to the crowd, buy me some

peanuts and crackerjacks...

JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)

Give me that fucking tape!

JIMMY (O.C.)

I don't think so Nancy.   Nancy,

Nancy, Nancy...

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

I'm so glad you're out. Next time

your dad wants to take it in the

ass, DON'T FILM HIM!

41.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I know. Ironic that I was the one

sent to the nut house.

JUDY

I thought I was going to die

without you. What if you and I

could live here together? Forever.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Right here?

JUDY

I'm serious. Maybe not here, but

eventually we'll buy some land, and

we can live together on it, and be

naked whenever we want.

JUDY

Excuse me.     What do you think?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I think you're drunk.

JUDY

I think you're right mister.

JUDY

I don't want this to ever end. I

want to be here forever. I want to

dance and be naked and be free, and

I want us to ball our brains out

everyday, and I want to feel the

air on my body and I want to get

drunk and not care about anything

in the world. I just want us to be

together in this moment.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I know a place like that.

JUDY

You do?

42.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yep. We can go there one day if

you want.

JUDY

We can?    Where is it?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Erlanger.

JUDY

(doesn't buy it)

Erlanger!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was

talking about it in the nut house.

That's ALL anybody fucking talked

about was this dude who lives up

there named Uncle Rodney. He

supposedly has a commune where we

can do this kind of thing every

day.

JUDY

Uncle Rodney's commune?

JUDY

That's funny.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(playfully)

No, I'm serious.

JIMMY

Hey!

JUDY (O.C.)

Okay, now it's your turn.

JUDY (O.C.)

How does it feel to be a free man?

43.

JUDY (O.C.)

Come on, come on, come on...

JIMMY

I'm thinking.

JUDY (O.C.)

Just let it go, be free.

JIMMY

(adoringly)

You're such a hippie all of sudden.

JUDY (O.C.)

Come on.

JIMMY

No.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY (O.C.)

Okay, go.

JUDY (O.C.)

Come on!

JIMMY

Okay, you really wanna hear

something?

JUDY (O.C.)

Yeah.

44.

JIMMY

I want to go one day without

masturbating. I want to liberate

my penis. I want to clone you so

we could have a three way and

neither of us would be cheating. I

want you to scrape my balls with a

cheese grater...

JUDY (O.C.)

That's gross!

JIMMY

And I love you. I love you so much

it hurts.

JUDY (O.C.)

It hurts?

JIMMY

Like God is stabbing me in heart

with a thousand knives at the same

time and you're the only one who

can make the pain go away. Do you

love me that much?

JUDY (O.C.)

I love you so much, I'd rather die

than be without you.

JIMMY

Here.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Make me a promise... the way a

husband and wife make a promise...

that we will be together always and

forever.

JUDY

You mean get married?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Something more powerful than

marriage. It's a bond. It's our

bond. It's transcendental.

45.

JUDY

What?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Transcendental.

(grabs the camera)

Here.

JIMMY

It's transcendental because it

transcends everything. Life, love,

law, people, things... A bond so

strong that our souls will become

one and it can never end, even in

death. If you swear on the bond,

it means you'd rather die than

break your promise.

JUDY (O.C.)

That's so beautiful.

JIMMY

You're so beautiful.    I want to

love you forever.

JUDY (O.C.)

Swear on the bond. Swear we'll be

together forever, that you'd rather

die than be apart.

JIMMY

I swear on the bond.

JUDY (O.C.)

And we'll never let anything come

between us, not even death.

JIMMY

Not even death. I swear. Nothing

will come between us, ever.

46.

JUDY

We'll be together forever.

JIMMY

(whispers)

Together forever.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY

This is action ten news reporter

Jimmy Van Muffmuncher reporting to

you live from the parking lot of

Dick's grocery store where we're

going to witness the beautiful, the

talented, the amazing Judy, commit

her first crime.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Is there anything you would like to

say to the public and your adoring

fans before you go through with

this?

JUDY

Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher. I just

want to say that I look forward to

losing, my, um...

JUDY

What did you call it before?

47.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Your conformist crimeless

virginity.

JUDY

Yes, I am very much looking forward

to losing my conformist crimeless

virginity. I would also like to

share with my fans these.

JIMMY (V.O.)

(in his reporter voice)

Thank you and thank your tits for

this rare, behind the scenes look

at your first crime slash moment of

truth.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

Jimmy, turn it off.    We're gonna

get busted.

JIMMY (O.C.)

No way, this is the best part.

MAN (O.C.)

Hey you two. Stop.

48.

STORE MANAGER

What the hell do you think you're

doing?

STORE MANAGER

Turn that damn thing off. You

can't be running around the store

playing with a camera. It's

against the store policy. Now get

out of here.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

What is the matter with you Jimmy?

You almost got us caught. You're

so worried about that camera. What

is it? What is it!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Twenty years from now, when we're

together watching these tapes

you'll realize how special this

moment is. I owe it to you. And I

owe it to us to capture everything

and anything we do together.

JUDY

Well you freak me out sometimes.

Why do you have to tape everything?

It's like you have a problem or

something.

49.

JUDY

You know, most of the reason kids

think you're so weird is because of

it. Why do you think everybody

makes fun of you? And then I have

to hear it and I have to deal with

it.

JIMMY (O.C.)

So everybody makes fun of me, huh?

JUDY

Yeah. Can't you give the thing a

fucking rest?

JIMMY (O.C.)

And you don't want to deal with it?

Well fuck them and fuck you too if

you think that. I couldn't give a

fuck what people say. This is my

life and I want to document it.

And right now me filming you

happens to be the only reason I

manage to get out of my fucking bed

every morning! You can't take this

away from me!

JUDY (O.C.)

How does it feel Jimmy? How does

it feel to have someone taping you

while you're crying?

JUDY (O.C.)

Tell me. Look at the camera and

tell me how it feels!

JIMMY

You're not getting it. It doesn't

matter how it feels right now.

(MORE)

50.

JIMMY (cont'd)

What matters is that you're seeing

what's inside of me and your taping

it. Can you understand that?

JIMMY

Can you?

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't know.

JIMMY

Well can you at least try?

JUDY (O.C.)

Yes.    I can most definitely try.

JIMMY

And you can never, ever, ever ask

me to not film you or anything we

do. That's the only thing I'll

ever ask of you. Agreed?

JUDY (O.C.)

Okay.   I'm sorry.

JIMMY

Will you swear to it?     On camera,

will you swear to it?

JUMP CUT TO:

JAMES (O.C.)

Please raise your right hand.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Please repeat after me.    I Judy...

51.

JUDY

I Judy...

JIMMY (O.C.)

Do hereby solemnly swear...

JUDY

Do hereby solemnly swear...

JIMMY (O.C.)

That I will never ask, request, or

even insinuate to Jimmy to cease

filming, no matter the situation.

JUDY

That I will never ask, request, or

even insinuate to Jimmy to cease

filming, no matter the situation.

JIMMY (O.C.)

And furthermore, I do hereby

solemnly swear to commit myself to

giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and

will continue to perform various

sex acts with the skill and

enthusiasm that he has become

accustomed to.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Keep your right hand up.

JUDY

I do hereby solemnly swear to g...

JIMMY (O.C.)

Mother fuckers.

52.

JIMMY

Here, you're definitely going to

want to tape this.

JUDY (O.C.)

(to herself)

Oh my God.

JUDY (O.C.)

(to herself)

Oh, God Jimmy...

53.

JUDY (O.C.)

(to herself)

I love you Jimmy.

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy...

oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it,

fucking stop!

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy...

54.

POLICE CHATTER (O.C.)

(over the police radios)

We're going to need an ambulance

stat at the parking lot of the

grocery store on Route 18...

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

Hi baby. I miss you.

(blowing a kiss)

Mwaa! I'll be waiting for you when

you get out. Be good and don't

wait too long. Look what I did for

you!

JUDY

I can't wait to use it on you!

CAMERA ON:

55.

JIMMY

Can I get a double cheese burger,

no pickles, large fries and a coke?

JIMMY

That's what I fucking missed more

than anything. Fast food.

JIMMY

And a number two.

JUDY (O.C.)

What did you do in there all day?

JIMMY

Masturbated mostly.

JUDY (O.C.)

(jokingly)

You cheated on me! I want to be

the only person responsible for

making you cum.

JIMMY

I hope you're willing to be on call

twenty four hours a day.

JUDY (O.C.)

Seriously, what did you do? What

was a day in the life of Jimmy in

the nut house?

JIMMY

Well, besides masturbating, I

talked and talked and talked and

fucking talked until they were

satisfied. But basically I told

them what they wanted to hear. I

said shit like...

56.

JIMMY

"Now that I'm finally able to talk

about my problems, I now realize

that my behavior was inappropriate

and harmful to others."

JIMMY

Then I figured it out. I had to

cry as much as possible. Whenever

someone would cry they'd call it a

"break through." So I'd be like.

JIMMY

You start out slow, then you build

it up like this... "Now I know

that using violence is not the

answer."

JIMMY

Then you go like this:

(snaps back into the

impersonation)

I was wrong, I know I was wrong and

I'll never do it again. I don't

want to hurt people or myself.

JIMMY

Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo,

waaaaaaa.

(snaps out of it)

Then you always give them the

obligatory hug at the end. After a

couple of weeks, then they

officially diagnose you with

something, give you a prescription,

then you're done.

JUDY (O.C.)

God, you're a genius.

57.

JUDY (O.C.)

So what did they say you have?

JIMMY

ODD. Oppositional Defiance

Disorder.

JUDY (O.C.)

You're so lucky. I wish I was

diagnosed with something. What

does it mean?

JIMMY

ODD is a disorder characterized by

an overwhelming pattern of

negative, hostile, and defiant

behavior which causes severe

delusions where the patient can no

longer distinguish fantasy from

reality.

JUDY (O.C.)

Wow.   I love that!

JIMMY

You see. They fucked up my order.

I specifically asked for no

pickles.

JUDY (O.C.)

(playing along)

Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle

this? Will his ODD brain be able

to withstand a pickle screw up at

the drive thru?

58.

JIMMY

Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt

my nipples with the pickles.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY (O.C.)

I love the ghetto. I don't know

what it is about it. I fucking

love it. It's always the first

place I go to when I get out.

JUDY

I love it when you're out of the

looney bin. Do you think you might

be able to try to avoid the place

for a while?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(joking)

If they don't send me to the bin,

maybe they'll send me to jail.

JUDY

I'm serious. You act like it's no

big deal when you go away!

JIMMY (O.C.)

(tired of it)

All right.

59.

JUDY

No it's not all right! When you're

in there I have to be out in the

real world alone, by myself Jimmy.

You go away and come back like it's

no big deal. Well it is a big

deal. I don't want to spend

another day without you. Do you

understand me? I'd rather die.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'm not going back.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Judy.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I promise. I swear on my life and

I swear on our bond, I'll never go

back.

JUDY

If you swear on our bond, then I

believe you.

JUDY

I love you so fucking much.

JIMMY    (O.C.)

I love you too.

JIMMY (O.C.)

What's the matter?

60.

JUDY

I was thinking, the last time you

got out we did it like five times,

like as soon as we saw each other,

we got naked and started doing it.

And today, my parents weren't even

home and I tried to do some stuff

to you, but you were acting like

you weren't interested.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I didn't mean to.

JUDY

Was it because you jerked off so

much while you were locked up?

JIMMY (O.C.)

No.

JUDY

(voice cracking)

Then why don't you want to have sex

with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm

pretty anymore?

JIMMY (O.C.)

No, no, no! That has nothing to do

with it. After I saw my dad being

rammed in the ass by my mother, I

kind of blocked it out, but when I

was in there they kept talking to

me and talking to me about it. Now

I can't stop it from coming into my

head. Every time I get wood, the

instant replay machine in my brain

projects this image of my Mom

pounding into my Dad.

JUDY

God, that's awful.   I didn't know.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yeah well, you know you didn't give

too much of an effort to get in my

pants anyhow. You just sort of

made your sex face and grabbed my

crotch.

61.

JUDY

How do you like this?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Now we're talking.

JIMMY (O.C.)

That is so hot.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Watch out!

JIMMY (O.C.)

I think you hit someone.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Stay here.

JUDY (O.C.)

(calls to him)

Oh my God, what are you doing?

62.

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god.

Jimmy?

JUDY (O.C.)

Don't put him in here!

JIMMY (O.C.)

We're taking him to the hospital.

JUDY (O.C.)

No, we'll get busted.

JUDY (O.C.)

What... what are you doing?

JIMMY (O.C.)

He's not breathing. He's not

fucking breathing!

JUDY (O.C.)

Is he dead?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(has decided)

Pop the trunk for me.

JUDY (O.C.)

No.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Judy.

JUDY (O.C.)

What are we gonna do?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I don't know right now, but we're

not driving around with a dead guy

in our back seat.

JUDY (O.C.)

I just want to go home. Jimmy,

let's leave him. He's dead. We

should just go.

63.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Pop the fucking trunk already

before someone sees us!

JUDY (O.C.)

(to self)

I want to go home.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(screams; frustrated)

Fuck!

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy, I...

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'm driving.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Get in.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Are you gonna fucking get in!

JUDY (O.C.)

We should just leave him here.

JIMMY (O.C.)

We can't leave him in the middle of

the fucking ghetto. Get in before

someone sees us!

64.

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't want him in my fucking car!

I want him out!

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh shit!

JUDY (O.C.)

It's the fucking cops.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Just shut up.

JUDY (O.C.)

It's the cops. It's the cops.

It's the...

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shhhhhh!

JIMMY (O.C.)

You gotta play it cool, okay?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm

begging you. Stop it.

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh God. He's getting out of the

car. We've got a dead homeless guy

in our trunk and he's...

JIMMY (O.C.)

SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

65.

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking

towards us.

JIMMY (O.C.)

SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.

COP (O.C.)

Good evening. License and

registration please.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Certainly, sir.

COP (O.C.)

Could you please step out of the

vehicle?

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy!

66.

JUDY (O.C.)

AAAAAHHHHHHH!

JUDY (O.C.)

What happened?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shut up!

JUDY (O.C.)

What happened!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Just shut the fuck up! I don't

fucking want to talk about it!

JUDY (O.C.)

I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT FUCKING

HAPPENED! I WANNA KNOW. I WANNA

KNOW. I JUST WANNA FUCKING...!

CAMERA ON:

67.

JUDY (O.C.)

What are you doing?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(it's obvious)

I'm filming.

JUDY (O.C.)

It's dark.     You can't see anything.

JIMMY (O.C.)

It's on infra-red. Do you wanna

see?

JUDY (O.C.)

No, I don't wanna see.

JIMMY (O.C.)

He's beautiful. He really is.

There's a certain serenity to death

I appreciate.

JUDY (O.C.)

He's dead. He's in my car, Jimmy,

and he stinks. I wanna go home.

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't think I can do this.

JUDY (O.C.)

I'm not like you. I can't do this.

(holds back a sob)

I wanna fucking go home.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yeah, well you can't fucking go

home. And you will do this. You

did do this. You killed him. You

didn't get in the car until the

cops showed up. Now we don't have

a choice. You want me to go to

jail? You want that?

JUDY (O.C.)

(softer)

No.

68.

JUDY (O.C.)

(half crying)

What are we going to do?

JIMMY (O.C.)

We just need to make intelligent

decisions. That's all. We'll find

a way to take care of it. Then

we'll go away. We'll fix it.

It'll be okay. I promise.

JUDY (O.C.)

You promise?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yeah.   Come here.

JIMMY (O.C.)

It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take

care of everything. I promise.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY (O.C.)

(coughing)

Oh, my god. The hair burning is

making me nauseous.

69.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies

fucking stinks. That bum's body

odor is being cooked right off him.

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy!

JUDY

What?    I'm not in the mood.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(making light)

Don't have to be in the mood.

Doesn't matter. The camera's on,

it's on.

(changes the subject)

You wanna know where we're gonna

go?

JUDY

Okay, where are we gonna go?

JIMMY (O.C.)

We're going to Lincoln to visit

Dinko.

JUDY

Who's Dinko, Jimmy?

JIMMY (O.C.)

He's cool. And he's got his own

place, and he said I could stay

there whenever ever I wanted. Plus

he knows about you and he wants to

meet you. And he doesn't like

cops, so he's not gonna call 'em.

Okay? Now gimme a smile.

JUDY

No.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see

my smiley face again.

70.

JUDY

I can't get sexy with that smell.

I just can't.

CAMERA ON:

DINKO

Hey! The video-man. I remember

that shit when we was in together.

Said you video-ed everything.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Yep.

DINKO

Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay

here for a while, but I have a

small business to run man. There's

going to be some people knocking on

the door and shit. I can't have

you guys answering the door or the

phone. That's the only rule.

Other than that man, we're going to

getting fucked up together all the

time. I got a shit load of crank

dude, that shit is off the fucking

hook. Here, take a hit.

71.

JIMMY (O.C.)

No thanks, I just want to film Judy

dancing.

DINKO (O.C.)

Right man. That's cool. Hey um...

If I tell you to stop taping

though, man, you gotta stop. I got

some hard core junkies coming over

here. Sometimes, if they see shit

like that, they fucking flip.

Crank junkies are a whole different

kind of breed man. They're fucking

hard core mother fuckers. You

don't know what they're gonna

fucking do. This one guy got

paranoid about something. He used

to climb on his roof to take a

dump. That's the only place he

would shit! How fucked up is that?

JUDY

You're not even paying attention to

me Jimmy.

JUDY

Don't I look sexy?

DINKO (O.C.)

Yeah, you look real sexy baby.

Real nice.

DINKO (O.C.)

Hey, I may have some work for you

if you're cool with that.

72.

JIMMY (O.C.)

What kind of work?

DINKO

You know some hustling, some good

money. I'll teach you how to mix

the shit. Your girlfriend too if

she wants.

JIMMY (O.C.)

(sarcasm)

Yeah. That's what I've always

wanted to do. Learn to make and

sell crystal methamphetamine.

You're a fucking genius Dinko.

DINKO

(big smile)

Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five.

DINKO

(re: Judy)

So is she, like, your girlfriend or

are you guys just fucking?

JIMMY (O.C.)

She's my girlfriend, my best

friend, and yes we fuck. And don't

ever, ever fucking touch her.

That's MY only rule Dinko.

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy!

DINKO

It's all good man. I ain't gonna

touch your old lady. Shit man,

she's so into you anyway.

73.

DINKO

So there's this dude. Fucker

taught me everything I know about

meth and shit. He'd fucking flip

for your girl, man. You should go

up and see him. He's in Erlanger.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Uncle Rodney?

DINKO (O.C.)

Right, right! I forgot.     Yeah,

Uncle Rodney!

JUDY (O.C.)

You have an Uncle Rodney baby?

JUDY

I want to meet your uncle.

JIMMY (O.C.)

He's not my uncle. He's not

anybody's uncle. People just call

him that. He's the one I told you

about from the nut house.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I said one day I'd take you up to

Erlanger one day, remember?

JUDY (O.C.)

When was that?

74.

JIMMY (O.C.)

When we were naked.

JUDY

We're always naked, Jimmy.

JUDY

(re: crank)

Fuck... Woah, that's cool.

DINKO (O.C.)

That's some good shit, huh?

JUDY

(disoriented)

Uh huh...

DINKO

So you guys should like, totally go

see him, man. I don't fuckin' go

up there no more, 'cuz like, I got

all the shit I need right here man,

'cuz my place is cool and all, but

there's no fucking room here, ya

know? So like you should go see

him and shit.

JUDY

You like this, Jimmy?

DINKO (O.C.)

(calls out to door)

Yo!

(to Jimmy)

Customers call.

75.

DINKO (O.C.)

Yo, Jimmy.     Is your girl into

chicks?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I don't know.

(to Judy)

Are you into chicks?

JUDY

Do you want me to be into chicks?

JIMMY (O.C.)

(calls to her)

Sure Dinko. Bring her in.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You know what, never mind Dink.    I

don't think Judy's into chicks.

JUDY

Yeah, I'm not into chicks.

DINKO

Well Hazel here will do anything we

want. Ain't that right Hazel?

DINKO

You're into chicks aren't you

Hazel?

76.

HAZEL

Um, I really just want to get some

stuff and get out of here.

DINKO

Shut up you fat fucking junkie and

take your clothes off or you ain't

DINKO

Come on!

HAZEL

I don't...

DINKO

(screaming)

Just do it, you fucking whore!

JUDY

Jimmy.

JUDY

Jimmy, stop him!

JIMMY (O.C.)

He's a big boy, he can do what he

wants.

DINKO

Ever made a porno?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Not with you.

77.

DINKO

Well all right! Keep filming

mother fucker, I'm gonna fuck this

junkie for you. You guys are free

to join in whenever you like.

JUDY

I swear to God Jimmy if you let him

go through with this I'll never

talk to you again!

DINKO

You ready?     You filming?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'm filming. Are you going to fuck

her or are you just gonna talk

about it?

JUDY

(screaming)

Jimmy!

DINKO

(to Jimmy)

How's this? You getting good

camera angles and shit?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Turn her ass towards the camera.

DINKO

(laughing it up)

Take off them panties bitch...   Oh

yeah! Come on bitch. Move.

DINKO

That's it.     Just like that.

78.

DINKO

We're going to be doing this shit

all the time brother.

JIMMY (O.C.)

You think so?

DINKO

Fuck yeah!

DINKO

You don't have to hold a gun to her

head man. There's plenty of other

chicks we can do that to. If

that's what you're into, then fuck

it, I'll...

JIMMY

Take it!

JIMMY

Finish him off! He deserves a

bullet right in the fucking face,

JUDY

(nervous, cranked out)

Yeah. Yeah. He does.

JIMMY

Then do it.

ELVIS

Weeeeeelllll, you ain't nothing but

a young bride... walking down the

aisle.

JIMMY

Here she comes.

ELVIS (O.C.)

You ain't nothing but a young

bride... walking down the aisle.

ELVIS

Well, if you don't marry Jimmy,

then you ain't no friend of mine.

ELVIS

Do you...

JIMMY

(helping)

Judy. And here, we wrote our own

vows.

ELVIS

Do you Judy promise to always

swallow, to never cut your hair, or

have another man's penis injected

into any part of your body for as

long as you both shall live?

82.

JUDY

I do.

ELVIS

Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck

Judy with enthusiasm, to take a

shower once a day, and promise not

to inject your penis into any part

of another person's body as long as

you both shall live?

JIMMY

I do.

ELVIS

Can I get the rings?

ELVIS

I'm Judy Wright now!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shhhh...     Shut up!

ANCHORMAN

...from Burlington, Kentucky are

wanted for questioning in the

alleged murder of a Hamilton County

Sheriff's Deputy that was killed

two nights ago while on Patrol in

the Over the Rhine section of

Cincinnati. On a very serious

note, the producers here at KPX-TV

4 would like to warn you that the

images we are about to show are

violent and graphic in nature and

may not be suitable for young

children. Once again, these are

the images that were taken from a

video camera that was mounted on

board the patrol car. Viewer

discretion is advised.

COP

(on TV)

Go ahead and open it.

COP

(on TV)

Put your hands on the vehicle.

COP

(on TV)

On the vehicle, now!

85.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I didn't want us to be apart.

86.

JIMMY (O.C.)

They know who we are now.

(making light)

Actually, we're famous now.

JUDY

That's the most romantic thing I've

ever even heard of.

ATTORNEY (O.C.)

(on TV)

...have a few words and then we'll

be taking questions.

JUDY

Oh my God, that's my parents!   And

your parents!

JIMMY'S MOM

(on TV)

We are very shocked about recent

events. Our son has always been a

dear sweet boy who is sometimes

confused, but we want him to know

that we love him very, very much

and just want this whole thing to

be over.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Bitch.

87.

JUDY (O.C.)

Shhhh...

JUDY'S DAD

Jimmy if you're out there, we know

you're scared, but you're only

making it worse. Please bring Judy

back to us. We really miss her

terribly.

CAMERA ON:

JIMMY

Wait a second.

JUDY

What?

JIMMY

I just want to look at myself one

last time with hair.

JUDY

OK, that's enough.

88.

JIMMY

Stop.

JUDY

What's the matter?

JIMMY

I'm not sure about this.

JUDY

Come on.     I changed mine.

JIMMY

Yeah, but you look fucking great.

JUDY

This was your idea Jimmy.

JIMMY

Fuck it.     Let's do this thing.

JIMMY

This is the look.

JIMMY

(joking)

Let's just leave it like this.

JUDY

Don't be stupid.

89.

JIMMY

I am one ugly mother fucker.

JUDY

It feels funny.

JIMMY

I look like Dr. Evil.

JIMMY

Come on. Let's go across the

street and get a shit burger.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY (O.C.)

You're such a fucking pig when you

eat.

JIMMY

Aaaaaaaaaahhh!

JUDY (O.C.)

Gross. That's it. I'm not taking

you to the country club, ever!

JUDY (O.C.)

(mocking)

Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your

feelings?

90.

JUDY (O.C.)

I'll take you to the country club.

I promise.

JIMMY

When?

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't know.

JUDY (O.C.)

Thanks for marrying me. You're my

prince charming that came and

swooped me off me feet.

JUDY (O.C.)

And one day, we're gonna have a

house and a white picket fence and

a baby. Tell me what you think we

should name the baby.

JUDY (O.C.)

What's wrong?

JUDY (O.C.)

What?

JIMMY

Shhhh. Shut up.

(grabbing camera)

Give it to me.

91.

JUDY (O.C.)

What are they doing?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shhh.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shit.

JUDY (O.C.)

What?

JIMMY (O.C.)

They're outside our room.

JUDY (O.C.)

Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we

are. We're going to get caught!

JUDY (O.C.)

Jimmy!

JIMMY (O.C.)

(to self)

Let's go.

92.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Get in.

Jimmy slides into   the driver seat and throws the camera onto

JUDY (O.C.)

They don't see us.

JIMMY

I know.    Just shut up!   Let me

think.

JIMMY

Are they coming?

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't know. I don't think so.

JUDY (O.C.)

No.   I don't think they're coming.

JIMMY

(relief)

Oh, fuck.

(to Judy)

That was close.

CAMERA ON:

93.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey baby, wake up baby. Time to

get up little fuck nugget.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Good morning Mrs. Wright. And how

are we feeling this afternoon?

JUDY

Where are we?

JIMMY (O.C.)

It's a surprise. Come on. I want

you to drive us in. I want to film

you when we get there.

JUDY

(big smile)

Okay.

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

What am I gonna see?

JUDY

I hate it when you do that.    Tell

me!

94.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Nope.    Keep looking.

JUDY

How much further!    Aaa!

JIMMY (O.C.)

Shhh.    Just drive.

JUDY

Oh my God.     Is that it?

JUDY

Is this where your friend lives?

JIMMY (O.C.)

This is where we live.

JUDY

We do?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Maybe. If you want to.       For a

little while.

95.

JUDY

This is sooo amazing.       It's like a

dream.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Go over here.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Stop here.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Take it.

JUDY (O.C.)

Is that Uncle Rodney?

JIMMY

No, that's Buddy. He said Rodney's

been expecting us. We're, like,

celebrities or something Judy.

JUDY (O.C.)

Really?

96.

JIMMY

Yeah!   He wants to meet you.

JUDY

Wow.

CAMERA ON:

BUDDY

We got like thirty five trailers

here. Long as we've got some

that's empty you can stay in one.

Sometimes people come in and we got

get you a tent or-- fuck,

everybody's friendly--- you can

always find a bed to crash in.

BUDDY

It don't look like much but we do

some pretty good partying around

here. Ya'll are welcome to stay as

long as ya like. Fuck it, you can

stay forever. There's only two

rules. Don't mess around with the

labs which are down back there...

BUDDY

Woah... No filming that shit.

Seriously. That's part of rule

number one.

(MORE)

97.

BUDDY (cont'd)

Don't even go near there with the

camera, and two is no cops, but

fuck, seeing what kinda shit you

guys got into, I don't think we

gotta worry about you calling 'em

up for a visit.

BUDDY

Other than that, ya'll can do

whatever the hell you want,

whenever the hell you want. You

wanna do some of the stash at the

parties, that's cool too. We'd

like it if you do it, normally we'd

say you gotta sell some too, but

Rodney says y'all's is a special

case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til

the heat's off for sure, that could

be months or... shit, years for you

guys. But no one up here's in a

fucking hurry.

BUDDY

Look at you. Little bitch from the

nut house, and you got yourself one

sweet looking bride! I still can't

get over the tits on this girl.

(to Judy)

Come here sweetheart.

BUDDY

We're gonna have a party for y'all

tonight. You know that? We have

parties damn near every night, but

this one's gonna be special just

for you guys.

(to Judy)

You like that sweety?

JUDY

Sure Buddy.

98.

BUDDY

(to Jimmy)

Nice piece of ass you got here.

Best you keep an eye on it so it

don't wander off on ya.

BUDDY

We're here!

BUDDY

Shit! Y'all's on your honeymoon.

Ain't gonna film it yourselves.

BUDDY (O.C.)

That's nice.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Let's go inside.

BUDDY (O.C.)

(shouting)

Hold on! Hold on!

CAMERA ON:

BUDDY (O.C.)

And, three, two, one... Now!

99.

BUDDY (O.C.)

All right! Look at the happy couple

coming into their new home.

(wedding march)

Da, da, da, dum...

BUDDY

How do you turn this thing off?

SALLY

Just give your love to Uncle Rodney

and you'll get it back ten times.

Don't be afraid to love him and

you'll learn to love yourself in

return. He'll teach you the cycle,

how we're all connected. If you

give yourself freely and completely

to him, you'll have nothing to

worry about. That's what I did.

CAMERA ON:

100.

SAM

Ya'll are going to love it here

man. See this?

SAM

This shit goes on every day. I

been here for six months man and I

love it. Thank God my parents

kicked me out... All you got do is

listen to Uncle Rodney and you'll

have the best fucking time of your

life. Oh, yeah.

(big dopey grin)

And don't fuck with him, 'cuz he'll

kick your ass!

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

Jimmy, come swimming.      The water's

warm.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Is it?

JUDY

Come on.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Later.    I just want to look at you

now.

JUDY

Why?

101.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Because you look happy, happier

than you've looked in a long time.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Hey!

CAMERA ON:

JUDY

Hey again.

JIMMY (O.C.)

So you like it here?

JUDY

How long will they let us stay?

JIMMY (O.C.)

It's up to Uncle Rodney.

JUDY

What's he like?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I never met him. He's supposed to

be cool, though... and weird.

Weird as hell.

JUDY

Well if he's weird, he's great

weird, whatever he is.

(MORE)

102.

JUDY (cont'd)

If we could stay here forever, like

Buddy said, I wouldn't need

anything else.

JUDY

The cops won't come will they?

JIMMY (O.C.)

Buddy said Rodney's cousin's the

Sheriff or something. Do you want

to meet him?

JUDY

(surprised)

The Sheriff?

JIMMY (O.C.)

No!   Rodney.

JUDY

(lights up)

Can I?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy

says he wants to talk to me. Maybe

he wants to talk to you too.

JUDY

He does?

JIMMY (O.C.)

I don't know. Buddy said he

thought you were pretty.

JUDY

Oh my God!

JIMMY (O.C.)

I told you you were. You're the

prettiest girl in the world.

103.

JUDY

(whispers)

I love you Jimmy.

JIMMY

Me too.

CAMERA ON:

BUDDY (O.C.)

You nervous?

JIMMY

(lying)

No.

BUDDY (O.C.)

I would be.

JIMMY

He's suppose to be cool.

BUDDY (O.C.)

He's more than cool man. God, you

really don't have a clue do you?

JIMMY

Um... Judy wants to meet him.   I

don't know if I can ask.

BUDDY (O.C.)

Shit man. Don't have to. She's

one of his girls, man. She'll meet

him.

JIMMY

What the fuck does that mean?

104.

BUDDY (O.C.)

Relax dude... Just like you're one

of his boys. Shit man, I'll give

you two weeks and you'll WANT her

to experience him. You may even

want to, too.

BUDDY (O.C.)

Just go see him. Here, take your

camera.

BUDDY (O.C.)

He wants you to film him, man.

With the camera. He'll tell you

when to turn it on, then you video.

CAMERA ON:

105.

JIMMY (O.C.)

Just one second.

UNCLE RODNEY

Take your time man. I want you to

feel comfortable. More

importantly, I want you to get this

right.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'm ready whenever you are.

UNCLE RODNEY

Just a second. I have to take care

of my baby.

UNCLE RODNEY

She's beautiful isn't she?

HAZEL

(begging, pleading)

Please...

UNCLE RODNEY

Some people come here too far gone.

Like Hazel here. The only thing I

can do for her is ease her pain.

HAZEL

Please...

106.

UNCLE RODNEY

(to Hazel)

Shhhhh... How about a baby one?

HAZEL

Yes.

UNCLE RODNEY

(to Hazel)

There you go...

UNCLE RODNEY

There's something about addiction

that brings out something beautiful

in a person. Addiction is pure.

Addiction reduces a person to an

infant. And there's nothing more

pure and beautiful in the world

than an infant.

UNCLE RODNEY

Hazel is no longer an adult. She's

an infant and I'm the surrogate

mother who provides her with much

needed breast milk. It's a role

that both of us have accepted and

embrace.

107.

UNCLE RODNEY

(proudly)

That's my girl!

UNCLE RODNEY

She's a little jumpy.

UNCLE RODNEY

Let's begin shall we? And

please... I'm going to use this

tape for my fans, so let's try to

get this right.

JIMMY (O.C.)

OK.

UNCLE RODNEY

I apologize if any of this

frightens you or makes you

uncomfortable.

JIMMY (O.C.)

I'll be fine.

UNCLE RODNEY

No. You won't be fine. What I'm

going to teach you will be

frightening. The truth is an

acquired taste but once you get to

it, it's all you'll ever want.

UNCLE RODNEY

Those kids out there... we, the so

called "undesirables" - you and me,

we know the truth. You know that

society doesn't want you, your

parents don't want you, corporate

America sure as fuck doesn't want

you... You wouldn't be here

otherwise.

(MORE)

108.

UNCLE RODNEY (cont'd)

If this government had a choice,

they'd gas us all in a heartbeat,

exterminate us like the Jews,

enslave us like niggers, cuz don't

kid yourself, WE ARE the new

niggers in this country. No one

respects us... No one sees what we

have to offer... No one has

compassion for us.... They don't

care, or they're too naive to see

that we're a by-product of a

wasteful society that has failed to

educate, embrace, influence, or

inspire any of us. We're societal

garbage. The counter culture no

longer exists. It's dead... It's

been replaced by us--

UNCLE RODNEY

The garbage culture... thrown

aside, imprisoned,

institutionalized, systematically

abused, executed, and enlisted into

wars started by government ass-

fuckers just to kill us off. JUST

TO KILL US OFF. And every week one

of you shows up here,

disillusioned, addicted, angry,

pissed 'cuz they tossed you

aside... into the garbage. Every

time someone like you shows up here

the garbage culture gets a little

bit stronger and they get a little

bit weaker. Until the "them" and

the "they" of this country run out

of places to put us, to put its

garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS

into their cities from out of the

confines of the spaces that they

have set aside for us.

UNCLE RODNEY

(biblical)

And we will SET FIRE to their

world! And we will burn it, until

a living HELL REIGNS over what was

their former world, and we will

fornicate in their ashes!

109.

UNCLE RODNEY

That's what's here for you.   That's

what's here...

JIMMY

Where's Judy?

UNCLE RODNEY

I'm so glad you guys came down

here. We never would have guessed

you'd come and see us.

JIMMY

You've been awesome.   Judy loves it

here.

UNCLE RODNEY

I knew she would. By the way.

UNCLE RODNEY

I know what you did to Dinko.

JUDY (O.C.)

JUDY (O.C.)

JIMMY

Come on.     Not the camera.

JUDY (O.C.)

Nooooo. It reminds me of when we

first met. Just you, me, and the

camera. God, do you remember how

you used to freak me out?

JIMMY

Yeah, those were the good old days.

How much money do we have?

JUDY (O.C.)

I don't know, why?

JIMMY

How do you feel about Canada?   It's

closer.

JUDY (O.C.)

Are we going together?

JIMMY

I think I should take you home.

JIMMY

I could write you a letter. Or I

could make a video saying I made

you do everything. They'd believe

you. You could tell them it was

all my fault. You could tell them

I was going to Mexico and I'd

really go to Canada.

JIMMY

We swore on the bond we'd never be

apart... but...

(MORE)

120.

JIMMY (cont'd)

I'll let you out of it... If you

want to be out of it, I'll let you

out.

JUDY (O.C.)

You're never leaving me, and I'm

never leaving you. That's all

there is to it.

JIMMY

Okay.

You're so handsome, you know that?

JUDY (O.C.)
