REVISED DRAFT

VOICE

Shhhhh.

LITTLE GIRL

Mommy, the men on the mountain...!

MOM

Shhhh. Gone, all gone now.

(strokes her hair)

I'm here. Mommy's always here and no

one can ever hurt you. Safe now...

safe and warm... snug as a bug in a

rug.

(beat)

I'll sit with you, think you can

sleep?

LITTLE GIRL

Turn on the nightlight.

MOM

Close your eyes now. I love you.

UPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO.

Three Weeks Earlier.

SAMANTHA

How you holdin' up?

EARL

Freezing my nuts off.

SAMANTHA

*Put that away*.

BURNOUT

Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!

SAMANTHA

I can't take it, Earl, this dumb

costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving

me crazy, but there's these *kids*

here --

EARL

Right, you don't wanna be rootin' --

SAMANTHA

In front of little Billy, age four,

yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses

to go butt-mining."

EARL

This is little Billy talking?

SAMANTHA

Age four, kid's unbelievable.

(sighs)

I'm too old for this, Earl.

EARL

Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate

the size of a melon.

EARL

Seriously, half my life's a doctor's

hand up my ass, I should marry the

fucker.

SAMANTHA

Say that a little louder, there's a

kid in back didn't catch it.

EARL

It's not that fucking little Billy

again, is it?

SAMANTHA (V.O.)

Eight years. I keep hiring detectives,

but they never find anything.

(beat)

I was born 3000 days ago on the beach

in New Jersey. I entered the world

fully grown, wearing clothes I don't

remember buying. Nothing in the

pockets but a single key, filed

smooth.

(beat)

I'm married now. Nice guy, early

forties. I stand naked in the mirror

and try to guess my age. Thirty-five,

maybe. I have lots of scars.

SAMANTHA

Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the

Christmas pageants I've seen, this

was by far the most recent.

HAL

Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing

the wise men, what'd you expect?

SAMANTHA

Teenage boys?

HAL

Well, I thought they did fine.

SAMANTHA

Just fine? Come on, it was ground

breaking stuff. The first Nativity

where Joseph stares at the wise men's

tits all night.

SAMANTHA

Hey, you!

SAMANTHA (V.O.)

Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter

and when I woke up on that long-ago

day, she was two months grown in my

belly. I don't know who put her there.

I may never. I just know she's mine,

and she's about to turn eight.

SAMANTHA (V.O.)

3000 days. I teach now, fifth grade.

I have the key, I wear it around my

neck for luck. Except for that, and

my name, all traces of my prior life

are lost.

(beat)

Was I in love ever...? Did someone

look in my eyes, did I say, "Darling,

I'll never forget you...?"

(beat)

Because fuck me, darling, I managed.

CAITLIN

His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named

him for me.

GIRL #1

That's her?

GIRL #2

That's who?

GIRL #1

(excitedly)

Her Mom, she's got amnesia.

GIRL #2

Swear?

CAITLIN

Swear.

GIRL #2

Too weird.

SAMANTHA

Excuse me.

SAMANTHA

Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to

help Dad with the refreshments.

(leans in, whispers)

Which one's Dad? I forget.

SAMANTHA

*Kidding*.

CUT TO:

YOUNG MAN

POLICE. DON'T MOVE.

MAN ON BED

What the hell is this...?!!

YOUNG MAN

Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're

assuming I won't shoot your sorry

ass, and everyone knows when you

make an assumption, you make an ass

out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant

Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude,

jerkoff, I will see to it you spend

the next ten years in prison getting

ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown

out because my arrest is too violent,

then I will personally HIRE men to

ass-fuck you for ten years. So if

you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead

and mouth off, but meanwhile you're

under arrest for the crime of

prostitution, now shut the fuck up

before I cut out your kneecaps and

use 'em as ashtrays.

(beat)

Officer Donleavy, read him his rights.

MAN ON BED

(a trifle confused)

Please, this is my first, I... I've

never done this before, I'll do

anything...!

YOUNG MAN

Sir, listen to me. I understand you're

not a wealthy man, but in light of

the damage this arrest will cause

you, we might be able to make an

arrangement --

MAN IN BED

Is he all right...?

GIRL

We gotta stop using bums.

MITCH

(lights a smoke)

Forget it. They looked like cops. We

pulled it off, didn't we?

GIRL

It was embarrassing.

MITCH

You want I should hire actors, for

Chrissake? These guys are cheap,

they work for food.

GIRL

Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over

you is that, like, a refund?

MITCH

Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here,

you're so funny. What's this?

TRIN

New case, honest to God chick with

amnesia. You want the job?

HENESSEY

Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

TRIN

Wasn't there a lady on TV named

Samantha? Had a magic nose or

something.

HENESSEY

'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick

lived with a faggy guy, then in the

last season it was a different faggy

guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on

the horn to amnesia chick, tell her

yes. Then tell her in 1967 she

promised to give me a blow job. Worth

a try, right?

HAL

Christ, guy's all over you like a

cheap suit.

SAMANTHA

That's funny, there's a cheap suit

all over him like a cheap suit.

HAL

Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my

father home. I'm plowed.

SAMANTHA

This is all I ever wanted.

CAITLIN

How would you know?

NEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.)

...So much for the flame-swallowing

Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile,

KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky,

where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle

turned out to celebrate her hubby's

worldwide tour. After one look at

her, I'm thinking Santa got what he

wanted this Christmas.

ONE-EYED JACK

Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No

way. SHIIIT!!

EARL

You're married what now, five

years...?

EARL

You and Hal, how often you two...?

SAMANTHA

Stick our fingers in out hands and

pull them out again? Every chance we

get. Shut your piehole.

EARL

Don't get all snippy...

SAMANTHA

Earl, do me a favor. Every few words

say "hic" and have bubbles come out

your mouth, okay?

EARL

Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a

drunk man have this much raw talent?

DISSOLVE TO:

HENESSEY

...and here's the jail here, see...?

Escape chute for the Borian, he's a

dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't

take no shit neither. See, you can

make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell,

look, I played with it a little

myself, I'm sorry.

VOICE (O.S.)

TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW.

HENESSEY

Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you

like the present.

TODD

It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she...

(sighs)

She gets weird. On my birthday, when

you gave me the Schwinn... she called

bicycle stores to see if there'd

been any robberies.

HENESSEY

Tell her I don't steal them locally.

HENESSEY (V.O.)

Dear Ma: Filled out the child support

stuff last week. Office got pissed,

under ex-spouse I put "Spawn of Satan,

Dweller in Eternal Dark." Just being

honest, Ma, lady wants me to die.

HENESSEY (V.O.)

I'd go without a ripple, that's the

truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired.

Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth

from me for so long. Or maybe you

believed in me. I miss you. I hope

you believed, even for a day. No one

did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold

here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your

son, Mitch.

HENESSEY

Me. What's up?

TRIN (O.S.)

Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia

chick's photo. Found a guy remembers

seeing her, fall of '87. He wants

cash, should I grease him?

HENESSEY

Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let

the fucker squeeze the Charmin.

TRIN

You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do

it, but we're talking time and a

half. Plus a night on the town when

I get back, and *no cockfights this

time*.

SAMANTHA

I want a cigarette, why do I want a

cigarette...?

SAMANTHA

What... what do you want...?

REFLECTION

I want a cigarette.

SAMANTHA

I don't smoke.

REFLECTION

(chuckles)

You used to.

REFLECTION

Relax, you can drop the act. Nice

and smooth, take another hit. There

you go. See how easy it comes back?

REFLECTION

*I'm* coming back. You know that,

don't you? Name's Charly, by the

way. You're gonna love me.

HAL

Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong

about this.

SAMANTHA

I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are

coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I

know it.

CAITLIN

Daddy, make her stop!

SAMANTHA

Hush. Go to the garage and get me

something, anything. A veggie, go,

man, go! I'm hot to trot.

HAL

Tomato.

CAITLIN

Tomato.

HAL

Onion, flying in.

SAMANTHA

More. Faster.

CAITLIN

Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.

SAMANTHA

Uh... chefs do that.

MAN

Please, man... I don't know why you

gotta kill me... But use the gun,

not the knife. Please. As a fucking

favor, I'm begging you...

TIMOTHY

It'll be over soon.

MAN

Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the

knife... Shit, I can't handle getting

shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...!

TIMOTHY

Last chance. What do you know about

a town called Santa Claus?

MAN

What is this, *what the fuck is

this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you

can't do this to me. I don't know

ANYTHING.

TIMOTHY

No. You don't.

(beat)

I can always tell, you know... If

someone's lying to me. A little skill

of mine, something to trot out at

parties.

TIMOTHY

Timothy.

VOICE (O.S.)

Message from Mr. Daedalus.

TIMOTHY

I'm listening.

VOICE (O.S.)

He says he's sorry, but he needs you

right away. Something's come up.

TIMOTHY

Nix. I'm just finishing up here.

Then I'm going bunjee jumping.

VOICE (O.S.)

He's aware of your weekend plans,

and he apologizes.

TIMOTHY

All right, what's so fucking

important?

VOICE (O.S.)

Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack...?

Recently escaped from a high-security

prison, as you're aware. But listen

to this: prior to his escape, seems

he saw something on TV that disturbed

him. So much he had to be sedated.

TIMOTHY

I saw it, too. It's called "Empty

Nest." How the fuck is it my business?

VOICE (O.S.)

The man was overheard talking to

himself under sedation.

(beat)

He said Charly Baltimore's alive,

sir.

SUIT

I know it's incredible, sir, but...

if she were alive, I'm thinking she

might be in contact with the old man

in Pennsylvania. Should I --

TIMOTHY

Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus

I'm on my way. Timothy out.

SAMANTHA

They were on sale.

CANADIAN #1

Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. (Subtitle:

I'd like to fuck her.)

CHECKER

Don't you love hearing people speak

French?

CANADIAN #2

Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour

d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une

femme c'est comme Gumby avec des

seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her

over a chair, women are merely Gumbys

with tits.)

HAL

Beautiful language.

SAMANTHA

*Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils

de pute*.

SLAM CUT TO:

SAMANTHA

I speak French.

PSYCHIATRIST

You do.

SAMANTHA

You bet your life, fluent French,

whatever the fuck that means.

(chortles)

Quand j'etais a l'ecole, Jai eu un

professeur qui s'est fabrique du

dentifrice!

PSYCHIATRIST

You just said when you were in school,

your teacher was made of toothpaste.

SAMANTHA

Right, he was, you got a problem

with that? Pasty Joe, we called him.

Look, the accent's perfect, so piss

off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.

CAITLIN

Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.

SAMANTHA

Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.

CAITLIN

Are the training wheels off?

SAMANTHA

Just pretend they're still there.

Piece of cake. You can do it.

CAITLIN

Wait...! I'm scared.

SAMANTHA

Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend

you're one of the X-men, you're tough.

Let's go, now. Three, two, one...

CAITLIN

Mom, I can't do it, swear --

CAITLIN

Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-!

SAMANTHA

Nonsense. You can do it. You don't

want to, but you can.

CAITLIN

My arm hurts, please take me home...!

SAMANTHA

You can go home, Caitlin. You can

ride there.

CAITLIN

Mom, no...!

SAMANTHA

Look, I know you're afraid, that's

the whole *point*, can you see that?

Now stop being a little baby and get

on the damn bike.

SAMANTHA

You gonna be afraid of things all

your life? Huh? That what you want?

CAITLIN

My wrist hurts...!

SAMANTHA

Life is pain. Get used to it. See,

you *will* ride this bike home,

princess. You will ride it and you

will not fall again, *is that

understood*...?

SAMANTHA

Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas

station... Right. Thank you Mr.

Henessey, I'll see you shortly.

HAL

She rode all the way home. She didn't

fall, not once. She didn't cry.

(beat)

You're good. You should work with

kids, you know that?

SAMANTHA

She said her wrist hurt. I didn't

know it was broken, God. I can't

even remember what I said to her...!

HAL

We can still make six o'clock mass,

you coming?

SAMANTHA

A private detective's coming by,

he... he's found something.

(beat)

I may have to go away. For a bit.

Now please leave me alone.

HAL

Go away. With a detective. Jesus,

it's the holidays, Sam --

SAMANTHA

Are you deaf? I said leave me alone.

Go to church. Drink blood. Drink

some for me.

ONE-EYED JACK

Evening Charly. Long time.

CAITLIN

Mommy...!

SAMANTHA

GET OUUTTTTT!!!!

SAMANTHA

NO!!!!

ONE-EYED JACK

I want my eye back, bitch.

ONE-EYED JACK

Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong

with you, *fight* me!

SAMANTHA

It took me three seconds. That's...

that's good, huh...?

SAMANTHA

Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.

HENESSEY

Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay,

she's in my car, what the hell is

going on?

FADE OUT:

SAMANTHA

That man who tried to hurt us...? If

I stay here... other people will

come. I have to leave. Just for a

little while.

SAMANTHA

I want you to light a candle and

keep it in the kitchen window. And

never, *ever* let it go out, because

as long as it burns...? It means

you're thinking of me. And if I'm

alone... if it's dark and I'm lost...

It's how I'll find my way home.

SAMANTHA

That's for a portable phone. I keep

it with me, you call me anytime, you

don't worry about the bill. And last

but not least --

SAMANTHA

For luck.

HAL

No matter what you find, I'm not

scared. Not of you. Not ever...

SAMANTHA

"Movin' in."

HENESSEY

Hah?

SAMANTHA

It's not linen. The song's not about

linen.

HENESSEY

Whatever. You cold?

SAMANTHA

(shivers)

I'm freezing.

HENESSEY

Turn on the heater. It doesn't work,

but it makes a very annoying noise

which distracts from the cold.

SAMANTHA

I'll pass.

(clears her throat)

So, you're a former cop. Atlanta,

was it...? Stop me if I'm out of

line, but I'm curious. How did you...

well, succeed? I mean, where six

other detectives failed?

HENESSEY

You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my

secretary used her feminine wiles.

She's got two, one wile per side.

Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em

coming around a corner, you got time

to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd

dig her.

(beat)

Ah. Here we are.

HENESSEY

Putting my glasses in my cooooat..."

HENESSEY

I sing what I do so I'll remember

it. "Turning off the downstairs

liiiight..." You know?

WALRUS MAN

The elder Trelawney rented to her in

'87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself

to dispose of her things. I'faith,

she's welcome to whatsoe'er she

wishes, for ne'er has trod these

walls a lass so easy on the eye,

divil take me if I'm lyin'.

HENESSEY

Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me

Lucky Charms."

ANGUS

"Always after me Lucky Charms."

HENESSEY

Thanks. Just needed to hear that.

HENESSEY

See anything you recognize?

SAMANTHA

Yeah, this dirt used to be outside

my window, shut up and let me look.

(sighs)

I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little

on edge.

SAMANTHA

I can feel her. Like a ghost.

(beat)

We could walk away, you know. There's

still time, we could just... leave

her dead.

SAMANTHA

Ay-i-yi!

SAMANTHA

Size four, no way. You know how long

it's been since I could wear a size

four?

(beat)

Can't be mine. Can they...?

HENESSEY

Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a

guy.

SAMANTHA

What's in it?

HENESSEY

Another guy's address. Two addresses,

is basically what I'm saying.

HENESSEY

Anything else in there?

SAMANTHA

Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes.

HENESSEY

Yeah, well take a look at this.

NATHAN

Alice, please...?

NATHAN

Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite

are mutually exclusive.

ALICE

What's wrong with the dog?

NATHAN

It's simple. He's been licking his

asshole for three straight hours. I

submit to you that there's nothing

there worth more than an hour's

attention, and I should think whatever

he's attempting to dislodge is either

gone for good or there to stay.

*Wouldn't you agree*?

NATHAN

Hello?

SAMANTHA (O.S.)

Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number

from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd

like to speak with you.

NATHAN

Who... who is this?

SAMANTHA

You tell me, Mr. Windeman.

NATHAN

...Charly...?

SAMANTHA (O.S.)

My full name, please.

NATHAN

God, it really is you...!? Chapter,

they think you're dead, *everyone*

thinks --

SAMANTHA

*My full name*. Please...!

NATHAN

You don't know your name.

NATHAN

Your full name... is Charlene

Elizabeth Baltimore.

MAN

Signal Daedalus. We just got her,

she made contact. Initiating phone

trace.

NATHAN

Charly, don't talk, just listen: We

have to meet, understand? We have to

meet *right away*.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)

Meet me off I-79. Highmile exit,

Salt & Pepper Lounge. Eleven a.m.

NATHAN

A former student... is in trouble.

SAMANTHA

What's this? What the hell is this...?

We don't have time for this, of all

the cocksucking bullshit --

HENESSEY

Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck

on the side, do you?

SAMANTHA

What are you, a Mormon?

HENESSEY

No, ma'am, it's just that... well,

when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey,

I burned the darn cupcakes." Now,

you go into a bar, ten minutes later

sailors come running out, they can't

take it.

HENESSEY

What the hell...? Lemme check the

scanner.

VOICE (O.S.)

...without endangering the hostages,

over... ...Roger that two-niner. PCP

confirmed, he's on a fuse, please

provide backup, over... ...Conneaut,

I'm waiting on Special Weapons, sorry,

over...

COP VOICE (O.S.)

GIVE YOURSELF UP AT ONCE. LEAVE THE

BUILDING, HANDS ON HEAD. DROP THE

WEAPON, REPEAT, DROP THE WEAPON.

MR. SHOTGUN

I'm the man! I'm the man! I elicit

the explicit!

SAMANTHA

Go up this hill.

HENESSEY

Why?

SAMANTHA

*Drive up the fucking hill*.

HENESSEY

Where the shit did you get that?

HENESSEY

Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill

someone! Hey!

HENESSEY

The diner...? That's half a mile

away, are you fucking crazy?

SAMANTHA

HK M-40 assault rifle. At three

hundred yards, vertical drop six

inches.

SAMANTHA

Shit. He's gonna do the girl.

HENESSEY

How the fuck can you tell?

SAMANTHA

I read lips.

SAMANTHA

See? Took care of it. Knew I could.

SAMANTHA

Pull over.

SAMANTHA

Had to, he... he would've killed

her... Had to... Oh God I took him,

such a good shot... I felt proud of

it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I

be proud*...?

(sobs)

I'm scared... I want to go home...

PRESIDENT

*Mister Perkins*.

(frowns)

Please, say it again, I'm a little

slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You

lost an operative, a trained

counterassassin, and you just saw

her on TV in a Christmas parade.

SILVER-HAIRED MAN

On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks

old, intelligence just caught it.

PRESIDENT

You recruited this woman in the late

seventies?

SILVER-HAIRED MAN

For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of

her father's, you see, and... I took

her in.

PRESIDENT

Well, it looks like she returned the

favor, now doesn't it?

(throws up his hands)

Unbelievable. You people, you dump

this on me, then next week you're

screaming, "Where's our funding?"

Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can

you say health care?

CIA DIRECTOR

Mr. President, please calm down. The

CIA bears no responsibility for this

problem.

PRESIDENT

Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many

double agents you got on the payroll,

last count...?

CIA DIRECTOR

Sir! That controversy has been

thoroughly dealt with, and if there

still exists a leak, perhaps this...

woman agent of his --

SILVER-HAIRED MAN

If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore

hasn't had classified access since

1987.

(beat)

But thank you, Kent, for trying to

fuck me in the ass.

SILVER-HAIRED MAN

I'm afraid rooting out double agents

may have to wait. The primary threat

is the woman. Her specialty is

counterassassination, a horseshit

turn of phrase which implies the

other fellow shot first, but in point

of fact she's a takeout artist of

the first order. Nearly disposed of

our friend the Beard down in Cuba a

few years back. Specializes in long

rifles, accurate to a mile and a

half. Presumed dead; now, after eight

years, back in the field, agenda

unknown. She knows enough to hurt

us. I'm frightened. Understand?

PRESIDENT

Yes, yes. I believe you. Just one

question:

(beat)

*What in pluperfect hell is she doing

in a Christmas parade*???

HENESSEY

Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out

eight months, I'm back doing skip

traces, now you got me stealing

fuckin' bicycles?

EX-WIFE (O.S.)

I don't want you around Todd, hear

me? Shrink told me what those men

did to you in prison. This is a

Christian household, my son's not

gonna develop any... tendencies.

Understand?

SAMANTHA

I still can't believe it. You're

saying my hands didn't even shake...?

SAMANTHA

What's the matter with you?

HENESSEY

You. You're the matter. Look, you

wanna keep going, good luck. I'm

driving back to Ohio. You're free to

come with me.

SAMANTHA

What... what are you telling me?

HENESSEY

Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you

*home*.

SAMANTHA

I'll spell it out for you, ready? I

have no future, *I can't go home*.

Until I know what's happening, I'm

in *prison*, you know how that

feels...?

HENESSEY

Yeah, matter of fact. Four years

inside. Marion, Illinois, real

shithole. Get in the car.

SAMANTHA

I'm sorry.

(clears her throat)

Um... what did you...?

HENESSEY

Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and

my partner, we handled a lot of

impounded shit. Fucker hated me,

boy. One weekend, when he was

conveniently gone...? Some bearer

bonds disappeared from his office.

And lo and behold, when the police

responded to an anonymous tip, you'll

never guess what just happened to be

sitting in my closet.

SAMANTHA

The bonds. Your partner put them

there?

HENESSEY

(laughs)

Hell no, I did, I stole the fucking

things.

HENESSEY

Now every dollar I hand my kid, he

asks his mother did I steal it.

HENESSEY

No more killing.

SAMANTHA

No more killing.

SAMANTHA

It was a helluva shot, wasn't it..."

DISSOLVES TO:

SAMANTHA

Quarter til. Any time now.

HENESSEY

Nice crowd.

SAMANTHA

You're just jealous of their

girlfriends.

HENESSEY

Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's

a beaut. While you're doing her doggie-

style you can pop the zits on her

back.

CNN COMMENTATOR (V.O.)

Violence in Northern Ireland continues

today, despite a plea by British

prime minister John Major --

SAMANTHA

I just... got a flash of something,

I...

(blinks)

I hurt my father.

HENESSEY

Whoa. You remember your father?

SAMANTHA

No... that's what's strange.

(shakes her head)

If I saw him on the street, I... I

wouldn't... oh.

HENESSEY

Ms. Caine, last week at a party I

ran into a girl I knew from college

and we chatted for a few minutes.

And it wasn't til I was driving home

on the freeway that I remembered

that I'd screwed her in the back of

a car once.

(beat)

Everyone forgets.

SAMANTHA

That's it? That's your helpful story?

Jesus Christ!

HENESSEY

No, see, all's I'm saying is you're

not alone.

SAMANTHA

Oh, shut up.

HENESSEY

Fine. I gotta use the head.

TIMOTHY

For you. Another in a long line of

bad investments.

SAMANTHA

Excuse me?

TIMOTHY

Just saw the ring on your finger.

TIMOTHY

Do I know you from somewhere...?

TIMOTHY

Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line,

let's forget I said that.

SAMANTHA

Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't

know you.

TIMOTHY

No, you don't, do you...? I'd know

if you did. I can tell if someone's

lying.

(smiles)

Sorry to bother you.

TIMOTHY

Okay, people, I got what I needed.

Wait until she comes out. Then do

them both.

(beat)

Walk soft, we got local law.

SAMANTHA

(sotto)

What are you doing?

HENESSEY

Pork. On your nine.

SAMANTHA

So?

HENESSEY

So you shot a guy in the head

yesterday. We wait outside.

SAMANTHA

It's freezing.

HENESSEY

Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other

people in the head. Just themselves.

During that show with the little

girl who's a robot.

SAMANTHA

Bingo. That's an old guy's car.

HENESSEY

How do you know?

SAMANTHA

Because there's an old guy in it.

Come on.

SAMANTHA

Gun bulge.

HENESSEY

You think I'm gonna shove it down my

pants? Shoot my damn dick off.

SAMANTHA

So now you're a sharpshooter?

HENESSEY

Ho, ho.

SAMANTHA

Mr. Windeman...?

SAMANTHA

Oh, SHIT!

HENESSEY

*Jesus wept*...!

NATHAN

Get in! Both of you, NOW!

TIMOTHY

East, they're going east. *Head them

off*.

NATHAN

Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe

what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*.

SAMANTHA

I'm... um, I mean... what?

NATHAN

What in God's hell have you been

*eating*, you look positively bovine!

Hang on.

SAMANTHA

Oh, God, no more--!

NATHAN

Bulletproof. Put it in myself.

NATHAN

Charlene, darling --

SAMANTHA

My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.

NATHAN

(exasperated)

Yes, yes, you said that on the phone.

*Must* I point out to you that the

letters in the name SAM CAINE, when

rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your

mind was missing a name, so it simple

invented one that was an anagram of

your current condition.

NATHAN

Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher,

that was your cover! Your memory was

gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT

YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio

housewife business, it's a fantasy,

you *wrote* the bloody thing!

SAMANTHA

It's not a fantasy, *I'm in the

fucking PTA*.

NATHAN

Then quit. You're an assassin for

the United States government.

(beat)

I ought to know, I trained you.

HENESSEY

Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.

HENESSEY

*What happened to bulletproof*?

NATHAN

*The side windows were next, I swear*.

NATHAN

Here, you might as well have one

too.

SAMANTHA

My God. How many do you carry?

NATHAN

Three. One shoulder, one hip, and

one right next to Mr. Wally --

(pats his groin)

Where most patdowns never reveal it,

as an agent is often reluctant to

feel up another man's groin.

HENESSEY

Got a tail.

NATHAN

Lucky bastard found the only cool

car in the fucking midwest.

NATHAN

Your father was in the British SIS,

assigned to the Irish situation.

After he was murdered in 1971, his

friend Perkins recruited you for

Chapter, a black bag operation working

out of the U.S. State Department.

NATHAN

Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come

down. You're to flush out a terrorist

by the name of Daedalus. You never

complete the mission, electing instead

to die, of all things, despite clear

orders to the contrary. And dead you

remain until, without preamble, you

re-emerge, eight years later and

fifteen pounds heavier.

SAMANTHA

Would you lay off the weight?

NATHAN

I think we can safely assume Daedalus

is aware of your resurrection and is

attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I

can't drive around in this thing.

(beat)

Any idea where we can go to stash

this car?

SAMANTHA

This address...? I... I recognize it

now. I think it belongs to a friend.

NATHAN

Perhaps you'd best drive.

SAMANTHA

Don't be afraid, we don't want to

hurt you.

(beat)

I just want to know who you are.

MAN

CHARLY, BABY!!

LUKE

(sighs)

Look, is this America's Funniest

Practical Videos or something?

NATHAN

Let me do it.

LUKE

I can't believe you don't remember

dating me. Charly, please, you pursued

me for months.

SAMANTHA

Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot

you. Sorry.

LUKE

It's December, you'll remember.

Right...?

SAMANTHA

(sotto)

This is ridiculous. What do we do

with this guy?

HENESSEY

Don't ask me, I just work here. Did

you bump pelvises with him or not?

SAMANTHA

It's possible.

HENESSEY

And you kid, Cathead --

SAMANTHA

Caitlin.

HENESSEY

Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be

the...?

SAMANTHA

I don't know.

(beat)

It's coming back, though. All these...

little details about him.

SAMANTHA

I know he's got a pin in his leg,

car accident. I know he cuts his own

hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an

ass. I know he sits down when he

pees. I know --

HENESSEY

Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.

LUKE

Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call

the poor bastard an ambulance!

NATHAN

*No ambulance*. The car I ordered

will be here soon.

SAMANTHA

Mr. Windeman, please let him help

you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty

sure I slept with him.

NATHAN

I'm about to faint... And if you

call an ambulance, I will fucking

kill you.

NATHAN

Where's Charly...?

HENESSEY

Relax. She's with Luke. That's his

name, Luke.

NATHAN

Goddammit, I told you --

HENESSEY

Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on

what you told us. I had him call you

an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be

here within fifteen minutes.

HENESSEY

The guy's story checks out. Sam knows

things about him. Stuff only a lover

would know.

NATHAN

Sod that... just watch them.

HENESSEY

Don't worry about it. Chick signs my

checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced?

Lie back down.

NATHAN

Checks. You're not fooling anyone,

dear boy.

(bemused)

You'd wash her feet and drink the

water... wouldn't you?

HENESSEY

Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married

with a kid.

NATHAN

My star pupil...

(smiles thinly)

That man in Pennsylvania yesterday...

The one at the diner, that was hers,

wasn't it...?

HENESSEY

How'd you know?

NATHAN

(nods)

I saw the news report, they found a

shell casing a thousand yards away,

helluva shot.

HENESSEY

Tell me about Daedalus, what's his

story?

NATHAN

Arms broker, man without a face.

Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the

Red Brigades. He's rumored to be

based in the U.S. Doesn't travel

much, they say. Too afraid of metal

detectors, the poor sod's got a foot-

long piece of steel in his leg.

HENESSEY

Come again?

NATHAN

A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.

HENESSEY

Where the hell...? I know I just

heard that somewhere, something about

a...

HENESSEY

Oh, fuck.

HENESSEY

Nathan, that son of a bitch has one

in *his* leg.

NATHAN

You blithering idiot, the son of a

bitch wasn't her lover, he was her

target, he's Daedalus!

HENESSEY

Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew

all that shit, not from *dating* him --

she *studied* the fucker to take him

out!

LUKE

Sure don't look like an ambulance,

does it?

CUT TO BLACK:

BRIGADIER

...the bombing has been linked to

the Ulster Volunteer Force, which,

as you know, is the counterpart of

the provisional IRA and the most

violent of the Protestant Paramilitary

groups.

ANNOUNCER

Despite threats of reprisals,

Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he

will seek to cut UVF supply lines,

especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S.

President Nixon concurs that...

GREGORY

You've never made it with a boy,

then?

GIRL

There's nothing odd about it. I'm

only sixteen.

GREGORY

Rubbish.

GIRL

What?

GREGORY

You're fourteen and not a day more.

Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.

GIRL

Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my

father, we never stay in one place,

I never meet bloody anyone.

GREGORY

Saw him on the telly. Think he'd

kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.

GREGORY

You know what, I'll bet you've never

even kissed a boy... now, have you?

(beat)

Aye, but you want to...

GREGORY

Thanks for shutting off the alarm,

you bloody Papist bitch.

GREGORY

Tell the press the Ulster Force claims

full credit.

GIRL

*DA*!

BRIGADIER

How much...

BRIGADIER

...did they pay you...?

DAEDALUS

Well, good afternoon. If it isn't

the forgetful spy. How you feeling?

SAMANTHA

Not-so fresh.

SAMANTHA

You... you're... the man from the

bar...?

TIMOTHY

Look at her. She's not faking it,

she doesn't know me from Adam.

DAEDALUS

It's not that I don't trust my

compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In

fact, I had every confidence that

your amnesia was genuine -- until

you showed up *here*. You follow?

(beat)

Meanwhile, I just got around to

reading the papers, there's the small

matter of an incident upstate. Long

range rifle shot, blew a man out of

his socks.

(coldly)

You can see where I'm coming from.

I'm trying to pull of the biggest

job of my career. I have to know.

How much you really remember... and

who you've told.

SAMANTHA

I didn't tell a soul, I swear.

DAEDALUS

We'll soon know.

SAMANTHA

Is... is this a torture thing...?

DAEDALUS

Torture, yes. The torturing of

beautiful women, albeit politically

incorrect, is an addiction with me.

(beat)

A woman never looks quite so beautiful

as when her face is distended in

pain. Witness the beauty of

childbirth.

SAMANTHA

Please, I'm getting all misty. Look,

untie me, I'll make any face you

want.

DAEDALUS

Let's not, and say we did. Do you

smoke?

SAMANTHA

Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really.

DAEDALUS

Good. You'll last longer. Now hush

yourself, and take a deep breath.

We're gonna do the torture thing.

TIMOTHY

We're running on schedule, I just

secured the tanker. We're borrowing

it from Carbide in South Carolina.

Cargo listed as fire retardant.

DAEDALUS

(nods)

Juice up the bird, we head out soon

as I'm done here.

DAEDALUS

Take all the air you can, that's

right. If you need to vomit, do it

now.

TIMOTHY

You don't remember *at all*...? The

greatest night of your life, shit,

drown this ungrateful wench.

DAEDALUS

Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity

safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot

you in the head. Nice and quick.

Otherwise, you're in for a long night.

*Who did you talk to*?

SAMANTHA

...Nobody... fuck you...

DAEDALUS

Hate to see you like this, Charly. I

heard you were a helluva spy once.

SAMANTHA

Watch your back. I'm not done yet.

DAEDALUS

That's a very funny joke. You're an

entertaining woman. Good night.

TIMOTHY

Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your

money will be waiting, and Jack...?

Do yourself a favor, do her and dump

her, I'm serious. Don't get cute,

try to play doctor first. I made

that mistake.

CHARLY

Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let

me go now...? I'll leave you the use

of your legs... Bargain, trust me...

DAEDALUS

How did you find me? Who knows about

this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?

CHARLY

I let you touch me, cowboy... I think

I need a bath.

DAEDALUS

Samantha... Please...!

CHARLY

Who's Samantha?

CHARLY

You see in the movies, badguy says,

"Talk to me and I'll let you live."

We're gonna run a variation, it goes

like this: Talk to me...? I'll let

you die.

CHARLY

Where's Henessey...?

PERKINS

This can't happen, Harry. The

President's already up at night,

prowling his sock drawer for double

agents, and now we've got a fucking

rogue on our hands.

HARRY

Sir, there's someone in the conference

room to see you.

PERKINS

Oh, for the love of Christ, who can

be so fucking important?

TIMOTHY

It's me, your poor black cousin. The

one you can't be seen with.

PERKINS

*You*...! Are you crazy, coming here??

TIMOTHY

(Lights a cigarette)

My boss is dead.

PERKINS

What...?

TIMOTHY

Your rogue bitch just took him out.

Probably went shopping in his weapons

storage too.

TIMOTHY

We're still on, Perkins. I've got

the tanker, the chemist, all ready

to go... but you gotta contain her,

man. We gotta step on her hard and

fast.

SWITCHBOARD

You have a call on line three, sir.

PERKINS

Who is it?

SWITCHBOARD

Charly Baltimore, sir.

PERKINS

Perkins.

CHARLY

It's cold, I want to come in.

PERKINS

Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell

are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm

going to direct you to a safe house,

get you on a plane --

CHARLY

Can the bullshit, I'm not telling

you where I am. I'll come in for a

full debriefing, but we do it my

way.

PERKINS

Charly, you're being paranoid. It's

not like it used to be, you're eight

years out of date.

CHARLY

Do tell.

PERKINS

Congress won't authorize a dime,

Charly. Chapter's on the way out,

we've been reduced to a records-

keeping agency, we *don't have enough

money to kill you*, understand...?

CHARLY

Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me

dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing

pool to buy bullets. We do things my

way.

PERKINS

Your way, I see. And if I say go to

hell?

CHARLY

From where I stand, it ain't much of

a commute. You'll hear from me.

PERKINS

She mustn't threaten our success.

Contain her, whatever it takes. But

be *careful*. If it gets out you're

working for me... we'll both be

grabbing our ankles on the White

House lawn.

CHARLY

Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-

oh, you're seeping.

CHARLY

Here, look at this.

HENESSEY

Ah, that hurt like shit!!

CHARLY

That's why I distracted you first.

(dabs at his wounds)

Same principle as breaking in virgins.

HENESSEY

Same as -- virgins, *what*...?

CHARLY

Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy

bites her on the ear as he goes in.

Distracts from the pain. You ever

try that?

HENESSEY

No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell

"pop goes the weasel," what the fuck

are you talking about? Who are you??

CHARLY

Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to

meet'cha. Drink?

CHARLY

See? Sit next to the dance floor,

every drink's free. People finish

dancing, they think the waiter lifted

'em.

HENESSEY

I'm confused. Gimme a minute.

CHARLY

Take two, they're small.

HENESSEY

Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're

actually a trained killer, Jesus, I

can't even say it with a straight

face.

(frowns)

So then... Samantha, she...

CHARLY

Never really existed. Like Nathan

said, she was a total fabrication, I

made her up.

HENESSEY

Fabrication. And now she's just...

gone? Forever and ever?

CHARLY

Thank God. Look at my inordinately

large ass, look what she did to me.

HENESSEY

Pretty convincing act.

CHARLY

Guess so.

HENESSEY

I mean, her personality, it had to

come from *somewhere* --

CHARLY

Change the subject. Better yet, steal

me another drink.

HENESSEY

Drink up. What's next?

CHARLY

I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring

us in from the field alive...

HENESSEY

Chapter. Can you trust them?

CHARLY

Not sure. Until I know, you might

wanna stay away from curbs.

CHARLY

They like to push people in front of

buses.

SANTA CLAUS

(bad Caribbean accent)

Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the

lambada wit'choo. *Come this way,

everybody*!

CHARLY

If I could come that way I wouldn't

need to dance the lambada. Follow

me, I need you to do something.

HENESSEY

...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's

lost it and I want fucking out, now

*call the Feds*. She's moving us

tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone,

call you back at midnight with the

details.

HENESSEY

All right, Charly. What did that

accomplish?

CHARLY

I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure

he's gotta be tapping your office.

Got a light...?

HENESSEY

(pause, then:)

Oh, no. He just traced that call?

CHARLY

Come midnight, you hang by the phone.

Nobody shows, we think about trusting

him. He tries to kidnap and torture

you, well, there it is.

HENESSEY

Whoa, time out.

CHARLY

Oh, don't be such a baby.

(lights her cigarette)

Ten o'clock, we got two hours to

kill. I'm a woman, feed me.

CHARLY

Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a

food baby.

HENESSEY

"Charly." fucking unbelievable.

(beat)

Shame about the fat ass. I bet you

were really attractive once.

CHARLY

Oh, I was. Check this out. One time?

A guy said he'd fuck me.

HENESSEY

No.

CHARLY

Swear to God.

HENESSEY

Did he make good?

CHARLY

Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh

my God, afterwards I said the most

funny thing, you know what I said...?

(beat)

I said, "Go back to your room. Dad..."

CHARLY

It's why he thought I had him killed.

HENESSEY

Your father was murdered.

CHARLY

When Da died, I went to his funeral.

12 years old, today I wouldn't. And

I overheard a woman, she was

praying... She was thanking God --

sounded so happy -- thanking Him it

hadn't been *her* father who was

killed. See... she didn't really

care that God had let someone die...

just so long as it missed *her*.

(beat)

...and she bought her cross at the

same store as mine, see, that's what

we do, we all pray to the same cross

on a hundred different walls, and

sit back and wait to see who gets

hit and who gets missed.

CHARLY

Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid.

I determine who gets hit, and how

hard. And I thank no one. It's

pathetic to thank someone who spares

you -- when they're just taking

someone else.

(beat)

Walk me upstairs?

CHARLY

This is my first date in eight years,

Mitch. Is this a fun date...?

HENESSEY

Okay, what's going on?

CHARLY

True love, shut the fuck up.

HENESSEY

You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady.

I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked,

and the last time I got blown candy

bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly,

so what's up?

CHARLY

Chemistry. Be quiet.

HENESSEY

Chemistry my ass. Know what I think?

I think this is why you'd fuck me.

(beat)

To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any

trace of her.

HENESSEY

Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher.

When she comes back, give me a call.

HENESSEY

Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will

ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and

she's under the mistaken impression

that Mommy gives a shit.

CHARLY

I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch.

Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY

ASKED ME.

CHARLY

Easy, baby. She ain't coming back,

no way. Bitch is dead.

BEARDED MAN

Good evening.

CHARLY

Fuck off.

BEARDED MAN

I see me a good-looking lady, all

upset, I wonder if she doesn't need

some male company.

CHARLY

Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I

get raped.

BEARDED MAN

Step into the alley, honey. I ain't

asking, I'm telling.

CHARLY

Oh, don't tell me. You're early,

Goddammit, you're supposed to be at

the pay phone. Go away and come back

at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got

a light?

BEARDED MAN

Lady, I have a gun!

VOICE (V.O.)

This ain't no ham on rye, pal.

CHARLY

What the hell are you doing here?

HENESSEY

Saving your life. Woulda got here

sooner but I was thinking up the

sandwich line.

CHARLY

You think I couldn't take him?

*Idiot*, you probably scared the

other guy away --

HENESSEY

What other guy -- ?

CHARLY

Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs,

were you always this stupid or did

you take lessons?

HENESSEY

I TOOK LESSONS.

BEARDED MAN

Hey!

CHARLY

*What*?

BEARDED MAN

I still got this fucking gun!

CHARLY

No, you don't.

BEARDED MAN

SHIIIIT!!

CHARLY

Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.

CHARLY

Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that

prick.

CHARLY

Easy, Spike. I got myself out of

Beirut once, I think I can get us

out of New Jersey.

HENESSEY

Don't be so sure, others have tried.

The entire population, in fact.

(beat)

Look, about me...? I mean, what's

up, you're this hot survival chick,

I'm getting the feeling you don't

need me anymore.

CHARLY

Good point.

HENESSEY (V.O.)

Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in

Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams

just threw me out of a speeding car.

Now more people will come an shoot

me in the head. On the plus side, I

won two bucks at video poker.

CHARLY

Get in.

HENESSEY

Found a use for me.

CHARLY

Yep.

(beat)

I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money,

a whole bunch.

HENESSEY

Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second

while I pull it out of my ass.

CHARLY

The key, Mitch. The one I keep around

my neck.

HENESSEY

What about it?

CHARLY

What if I told you it's the key to

Box 406 at Pittsburgh International

Airport?

HENESSEY

How would you know? Someone filed

off the numbers.

CHARLY

Not someone. Me. I filed them off.

(beat)

There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.

HENESSEY

What's in it?

CHARLY

$200,000.

CHARLY

Payment for my last assignment. I

need you to retrieve it for me.

HENESSEY

Why me?

CHARLY

Don't be stupid, they might have the

place covered. I don't want to get

shot to pieces.

HENESSEY

Shoulda known.

(sighs)

Gimme the key.

CHARLY

I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin

back in Ohio.

HENESSEY

Humor me: you're a paid assassin,

then you fall off a cliff. Sink under

the ocean, and when you come out

you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna

tell me what happened?

CHARLY

I fell into a school of fish, they

elected me principal. Shut the fuck

up.

HENESSEY

Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking

maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act.

Maybe you forgot to hate yourself

for eight years, ever think of

that...?

CHARLY

Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope,

seems clear enough to me. Hate myself,

Christ almighty. What are you, my

shrink?

HENESSEY

No, just some loser thought he could

maybe understand, fuck it. I been

there, you know. I'd kill for fucking

amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I

can think is I got reamed in the ass

by three guys. Merry Christmas, son,

here's a ball glove, did you know

Daddy screamed when they carved the

name in his back...? Mary, by the

way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell.

God, I'm tired.

(beat)

I never did one thing right, you

know it, not one fucking thing. Not

even accidental, that takes skill.

CHARLY

Drive past, don't slow down.

(points)

Park under those trees, honk if

there's trouble.

HENESSEY

(bad Rochester)

Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw

down fo' you.

CHARLY

Good morning, Raymond.

RAYMOND

Um... morning, Ms. Caine.

CHARLY

What did we learn about the dangers

of smoking...? Give it here.

CHARLY

Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll

blow your fucking head off.

AGENT #1

Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just

to follow it back to the ass it came

from.

AGENT #2

Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast.

VOICE (O.S.)

Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more

pass, let's make sure the house is

secure.

DRIVER

He's dead. Goddammit, how did that

happen??

BACKSEAT

*Go bulletproof, now*!

TIMOTHY

Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're

about to have 2.4 children.

TIMOTHY

I know where you live. Close your

mouth, you look like a fish. Merry

Christmas.

DRIVER

Target two, acquired! Red Dog in

pursuit, backup requested.

(over his shoulder)

You got him?

BACKSEAT

I got him.

HENESSEY

Jesus wept.

CHARLY

This is gross, this is gonna be so

Goddamn gross...

DRIVER

Shit... it really... *is* you...

CHARLY

Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe

it, they moved you from cyphers.

Long time, man, I figured you were

dead by now.

CHARLY

So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and

fuzzy?

HENESSEY

Sure. It's not your fault the gun

accidentally went off in mid-air as

you tripped and flew over the car.

CHARLY

Exactly. What's in the glove box?

HENESSEY

Phone bill, Christmas card... Five

buck, swell. You didn't have to kill

him, you know.

CHARLY

Back off, man. Do I tell you how to

snap photos of extramarital blowjobs?

No.

CHARLY

Hello?

TIMOTHY (O.S.)

It's me, I got your kid. Give your

location, we gotta lose the cellular.

CHARLY

State Road 80, 15 minutes west of

Harrison.

TIMOTHY

Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to

Harrison, find their main bus stop.

Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better

drive fast, after five rings I hang

up.

HENESSEY

What the hell was that?

CHARLY

He's got the kid. Doesn't want to

talk on the airwaves, he's routing

me to a land line. A pay phone.

HENESSEY

Which phone? Where?

HENESSEY

Shit. Service centers...! They list

'em on the back of phone bills, right?

CHARLY

Excuse me?

HENESSEY

Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5.

CHARLY

Verify you have her.

TIMOTHY (O.S.)

I got your cellular number off a

cast on her right wrist. Right below

Mommy loves you... Picture of a panda.

Dog, panda, it's got funky ears.

TIMOTHY (O.S.)

I want money, Charly. I know you've

got numbered accounts, we all do.

I'll let you know where and when.

Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid

and shoot out her knees.

CHARLY

You're dead, motherfucker. We don't

involve families. It's not the way

it's done, *we don't take families*.

TIMOTHY

I'll be in touch.

CHARLY

Give me an ANI trace. Do it.

TIMOTHY

It's done, she hooked. All I gotta

do is set the ransom meet.

PERKINS

She mustn't suspect a trap.

TIMOTHY

No way. She thinks I'm acting alone,

remember? Say the word, I'll hand

her to you on a plate.

PERKINS

God. We're monsters, aren't we...?

(pause, then:)

Forget Charly. Talk to me about

tonight.

TIMOTHY

The tanker's on its way from

Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One

terrorist on ice, waiting to play

patsy.

(points)

What's in the sack?

PERKINS

That...? Something to prove that I'm

not a complete ogre.

PERKINS

See? The young one will have a doll

to play with on Christmas. Very

popular item. It... well, it pees.

You put water in it and... oh, fuck

you.

HENESSEY

Almost dark now.

CHARLY

Another ten minutes. You want my

Crazy Meal action figure?

HENESSEY

Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing

the right thing? We've got money, we

could negotiate...

CHARLY

*I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God,

I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's

dead weight if she's sedated.

HENESSEY

Not so emotional, I'm getting

embarrassed with these outbursts

here.

CHARLY

Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I

can. This is an extraction, nimrod,

and she's the target, that's how to

play it, the only way to beat this

guy.

HENESSEY

Yeah? How come you know so much about

this fucking guy?

CHARLY

Don't go there, Mitch, you don't

want to know.

HENESSEY

I'm here. Suppose you tell me.

CHARLY

Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises

with this guy. In Paris, back in

1987.

CHARLY

I'd been assigned to kill his boss,

remember...? Needed him out of the

way. So I let him seduce me. Had a

steel needle under the pillow, figured

to stick him *en flagrante*, that

means while we were screwing. But he

was too slick. Bashed me in the head,

finished, then threw me in the trunk

of a car. Still think I'm a girl

scout, Mitch...?

CHARLY

It's almost dark. Let's get it done.

HENESSEY

What's the matter?

CHARLY

They're here.

HENESSEY

Who?

CHARLY

Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy

acting alone, Caitlin had a chance.

Now...? She's dead meat.

BLUE-SUIT

1800 hours. We're still trying to

clean the tanker --

TIMOTHY

(scowls annoyance)

Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and

reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee

jumping after this.

HENESSEY

Let me go in.

CHARLY

Negative. You stomp around like a

forties drunk and you're a lousy

shot.

HENESSEY

I get by.

CHARLY

You couldn't hit a lake if you were

standing on the bottom, now shut the

fuck up.

CHARLY

I saw a little girl.

HENESSEY

(frowns)

Come again?

CHARLY

That's what happened under the water.

That night, eight years ago.

CHARLY

At the end... there she was, this

pretty little girl at the bottom of

the ocean, smiling at me. Three years

old, didn't know Daddies hid in

closets, not yet. Stared up at me in

the strangest way... saying how'd it

come to this, we were so pretty and

perfect, now look at us, sinking

with our head all open... Said when

she grew up she was gonna teach

school. She couldn't wait.

CHARLY

Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet

me at 26-9, you need to talk. As

soon as you spot me with the kid,

start blowing the charges.

CHARLY

They're gonna blow my head off, you

know.

(softly:)

This is the last time I'll ever be

pretty.

CHARLY

Time now. What I do next, they tell

me it... looks like a machine or

something. You don't like it, don't

look.

CHARLY

Don't say it.

HENESSEY

I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out

more often.

CHARLY

Gotta go.

(beat)

If she's alive, she's coming out of

there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll

know we stopped by.

SENTRY

All clear.

HENESSEY

Christ, lady, what are you doing in

there, playing fucking mah-jongg?

*Move*.

TIMOTHY

Bogey.

TIMOTHY

Take her alive, Perkins wants her!

VOICE (O.S.)

I smell gasoline, you have a little

accident...? I got plenty of matches

up here. Bad way for a kid to go.

Thirty seconds, think it over.

TIMOTHY

Good to have you back again, Chuck.

PERKINS

You know, Colonel, you ought really

to have stayed dead. You don't know

the rules of the game anymore.

CHARLY

No shit. Eight years ago, you send

me to kill Daedalus and this clown.

Now you're working *with* him.

PERKINS

Budget cuts, remember? Congress

blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central

America. Across the board, an

intelligence blackout. We had to

recruit any eyes and ears we could

find, even if it meant going to former

targets.

CHARLY

Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that*

what this is about...? The foot

soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck

me, you're running a fundraiser!!

CHARLY

You'll get all the money you want at

the next budget hearing, won't you...?

All you need is a major terrorist

incident.

PERKINS

Interesting theory.

CHARLY

Theory, my ass. I think some

terrorists were planning a strike.

Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's

how you knew they were coming...

(eyes widening)

No way. Don't tell me you're gonna

sit there and let them go through

with it, *just to get a budget

increase*.

PERKINS

It's not without precedent. 1993,

remember the World Trade Center

bombing...? The CIA had advance

knowledge, don't think they didn't.

Worse, the diplomat who issued the

terrorist's visa was CIA, they

*facilitated* the bombing. Purely to

justify a budget increase. Of course,

they'd no way of knowing the

terrorists would botch the job.

CHARLY

That's not gonna happen this time...?

PERKINS

No. This time, the terrorist event

will come off precisely as planned.

This time the terrorists can't muck

it up... because we've killed them

and taken over.

POCK

Found these buried around the

perimeter.

TIMOTHY

Make sure you get all of them.

TIMOTHY

Chuck, you give me the fuck of my

life then try to stick me, come back

from the dead, whack my boss... No

sense lyin', I'm miffed.

CHARLY

So what's the plan? What's going out

in the tanker?

CHARLY

What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I

wanna know.

TIMOTHY

You wanna know the plan?

TIMOTHY

Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A.

personified. We drive the chemical

tanker in tonight, park it. Add a

catalyst, chain reaction, it goes

hot. We evacuate. The mix heats

overnight, goes critical at 312

degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas

morning... Main Street looks like a

meteor strike.

HENESSEY

Are you fucking insane? You're talking

about 10,000 people!!

CHARLY

Easy, Mitch.

(to Timothy)

How you gonna blame it on terrorists?

TIMOTHY

Those roads are treacherous this

time of year. When we dump a car to

the bottom of a ravine, with the

corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get

the picture?

CHARLY

Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let

my kid go.

TIMOTHY

Why? For old times' sake...?

CHARLY

Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*...

TIMOTHY

And why exactly should I do that...?

CHARLY

(spits blood)

Because they're yours, motherfucker.

CHARLY

That night in Paris, I got pregnant.

The little girl's your daughter.

TIMOTHY

Priceless. Can't believe it...

TIMOTHY

Kid's down there. What it is, Charly,

they're gonna find you both frozen

to death in the woods. Suicide pact.

CHARLY

She's no risk, Timothy, *let her

go*.

TIMOTHY

The freezer's downstairs, Charly.

Let's get it done.

HENESSEY

I'll wait for you to rescue me.

CHARLY

Be just a minute.

TIMOTHY

Shit, this place is loaded with fumes,

nobody light a fucking match. You

check her for flammables?

GUN GUARD

(shrugs)

Checked her for colon cancer.

CAITLIN

Mommy...

CHARLY

Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay.

Safe and snug... what comes next,

huh...? What's the next part?

CAITLIN

...bug in a rug... man with white

hair... says the same thing you say...

CHARLY

We're going to take a nap together,

Cate. You can have your dolly, and

Mommy will be next to you, how's

that? It'll be like bears in winter.

When they get cold, see, they fall

deep, deep asleep...

TIMOTHY

Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough.

CHARLY

You're murdering us both, cocksucker,

let the kid have her fucking dolly.

TIMOTHY

Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll

make you a deal, okay? There's a

knife in that box. Now, you and the

kid, you're going to freeze, *but* --

if you kill the kid *by your own

hand*...? I won't kill your husband.

Serious. We're gonna open that door

and you'll both be frozen solid, but

I wanna know that you've cut your

own child's throat.

CHARLY

It ain't over, motherfucker. You're

gonna die screaming and I'm gonna

watch. Am I telling the truth...?

CAITLIN

Mom, it's cold in here-!

CHARLY

Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar

bear, remember?

TIMOTHY

Tell me where Charly keeps her money.

She must have mentioned it.

HENESSEY

Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly

called Washington, by morning this

whole place'll be crawling with Feds.

TIMOTHY

We'll be gone by then, Mitch.

HENESSEY

Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying,

there's a couple Feds, they couldn't

sleep, said they might come early.

Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just

watch.

TIMOTHY

Already did, Mitch, someone already

did. Perkins got stuck with a double

agent, someone trusted, highly placed.

HENESSEY

Who?

TIMOTHY

Me.

(chuckles)

Chinks are paying me to bring down

Chapter.

TIMOTHY

Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue

teams within minutes, guess what

they find...?

HENESSEY

The patsy.

TIMOTHY

Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught

with their pants down. See, Mitch, I

dumped in a much faster chemical

catalyst...

(beat)

The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*.

In the center of town, thirty-five

minutes from now.

CHARLY

Open.

CHARLY

Gimme a spark... show me, show me...

CHARLY

Come on, come on... do it...!

CHARLY

All this, just one fucking match,

*Goddamit*...!

CAITLIN

Mommy...?

CAITLIN

Don't cry. I keep these here.

(beat)

For lighting your candle.

CHARLY

I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you

know how much I love you...?

CAITLIN

Am I gonna die...?

CHARLY

No, baby, you're not gonna die. They

are.

TIMOTHY

Charly's stash. What's the number of

the locker, Mitch...?

HENESSEY

Fuck you.

TIMOTHY

Left nut, five bucks I make it.

CHARLY

When I tell you, scream as loud as

you can, or else your ears'll get

hurt.

CHARLY

Hey, should we buy a dog...?

HENESSEY

You foxy bitch.

TIMOTHY

Move it out of here, now!

CHARLY

*Run, Catey*.

CHARLY

Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...

NOSY BLUE-SUIT

Hey. Hey, you see that? A little kid --

CHARLY

Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't

make a sound. Snug as a bug in a

rug...

HENESSEY (V.O.)

Charly, you there? Hello, Charly.

CHARLY

Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen,

if you say, "Are we having fun yet"

I'll rip your nuts off. Where are

you?

HENESSEY

Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin

with you?

CHARLY

No, but she's safe for the moment,

she stowed away on the tanker truck.

HENESSEY

Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to

go off early. We got fifteen minutes.

No more.

HENESSEY

Hello...! Charly...?

CHARLY

Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just

locked her in, she's stuck in there

and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!

HENESSEY

All right, I'll go in and get her,

you watch my back.

CHARLY

No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch,

automatic weapons.

HENESSEY

So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ,

what are you good for?

HENESSEY

(to himself)

C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right,

just this once... please...

HENESSEY

Piece of cake.

CHARLY (V.O.)

*Your nine, on your nine*!

CHARLY (V.O.)

*30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*.

(beat)

*Your other left*.

CHARLY (V.O.)

*Nix, nix, I can't see in there,

don't do it, break right...*!

CHARLY (V.O.)

*Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta

threre*!

HENESSEY

Gracias.

CHARLY (V.O.)

*De nada*.

CHARLY (V.O.)

*End run, Mitch, go wide*!

CHARLY (V.O.)

*No, Goddamn you, they got you

flanked...*!

HENESSEY (V.O.)

Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants,

they're pretty great. Some really

funny ants here, Ma. All these funny

ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em

awhile...

TIMOTHY (V.O.)

I tried to give you a pretty death,

baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked,

now it's ground beef time.

CHARLY

The truck. How long til it blows?

TIMOTHY

(incredulous)

Sweet Loretta, you're another animal

entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees...

Make it ten minutes, give or take.

CHARLY

Then I better hurry.

TIMOTHY

Oh, spare me. You made a big noise

and bought five more minutes on the

planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in

what's left of your face.

TIMOTHY

All units converge. Divert local

law, this is a government matter.

Brook no interference, I want the

Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's

the fucking chopper*?

CHARLY

I'm the Missus. Drive.

VOICE (O.S.)

...yes, she's with Santa Claus,

correct, er, excuse me, the individual

*playing* Santa, er... they're

pursuing the tanker truck, sir.

CHARLY

Sorry, man. Government agents, high

level conspiracy.

SANTA

Fuckin' government.

CHARLY

Veer left.

SANTA

Away from the truck?

CHARLY

Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own

that fucking truck.

CHARLY

Hang on, Catey.

CHARLY

*No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!

CHARLY

Can't stop, Catey, can't...

CHARLY

Suck my dick, every one of you

bastards...

TIMOTHY

Call it four minutes to detonation.

I got a chopper on the way, lots of

time.

CHARLY

Oh, honey. Only four inches...?

TIMOTHY

You'll feel me.

VOICE (O.S.)

Point team leader, reporting...

She's... incapacitated the truck...

I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm

dying... Instructions...?

PERKINS

Continue dying. Out.

PERKINS

Anthony, get me the President...

TIMOTHY

You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles

never recovered from C-section, I'll

bet. Am I right?

CHARLY

Please, man... She's only... eight...

she's a beautiful little girl...

TIMOTHY

She's a worthless bitch. I know it

'cause she came out of me.

TIMOTHY

It's called shock, Charly... Your

body wants to go into shock...

CHARLY

Fuck you, your breathing's lousy...

TIMOTHY

Look at you. You're out of your

motherfucking league, dearie.

CHARLY

...You want a piece...? Take my

shoulder.

PILOT

Got her. Heading for the tanker,

thirty yards out. She's all over the

place, something's wrong with her.

CHARLY

*Cover your ears*.

CAITLIN

MOMMY...!

CHARLY

Run... get out...

CAITLIN

Don't go away again, Please...!

CHARLY

The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up,

RUN... I'm right behind you, go...

CHARLY

...*Go and don't look back*...

CAITLIN

*Mommy, no...*!

CAITLIN

It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please

wake up, come on please...

PILOT

Sir, your shoulder --

TIMOTHY

Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse.

Just bring me around and hold her

steady. I'm not leaving until I know

the bitch is dead.

CAITLIN

Mommy, get up now. You just stop it,

Mommy, you stop being a little baby.

Stop it, you're not dead, I know

you're not dead so you get up now.

CAITLIN

*Don't you die*, you get up now,

Goddammit...! Life is pain, you just

get used to it, and stand up *right

this minute*, Mommy. Life is pain,

do it, you bitch. *Do it*.

CHARLY

...mommy... here...

CHARLY

...You're grounded...

CHARLY

I'm gonna get the gun, you run for

that car. We go on three, okay? One...

Two... *Three*.

CHARLY

Somebody get that motherfucker off

me! I got a kid here, I got my eight

year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...!

It's Christmas Eve, who are you

*people*, fucking pull him off! Do

you hear me...?

CUT TO:

CHARLY

Distract him, for God's sake give me

ten seconds, please, I'm begging

somebody, anybody, *she's my

daughter*...!

CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT

Negative, ma'am, we understand your

request, but we've decided to go

ahead and let this play out...

TIMOTHY

Where are *you* going??

CHARLY

Suck on it.

CHARLY

Die screaming, motherfucker.

CAITLIN

Hurry! The truck is a bomb!

HENESSEY

Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a

fucking lightning rod on the roof...?

No, Caitlin, *don't check*.

CHARLY

Hey... you're bleeding...

HENESSEY

I think that's yours...

CHARLY

Right, sorry...

CAITLIN

*You're a bad driver! Who said you

could drive*?

TIMOTHY

*Somebody do her, somebody kill that

fucking whore, kill her*!

CAITLIN

Don't hit the cars!

HENESSEY

Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?

CHARLY

(grimaces)

...Are you... stupid...?

HENESSEY

...funny thing...? You aren't going

to die... I am...

CHARLY

I know.

HENESSEY

Hey, gorgeous... know something...

you got your mother's eyes... don't

let... nobody tell you different...

HENESSEY

Scared... to be nobody... without a

ripple... please... remember me...

(beat)

...Love you...

DOCTOR

Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here.

They'll be right in.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

AIDE

...They'll push for dismantlement of

our apparatus in Chile, but we've

got a degree of plausible

deniability...

VOICE (O.S.)

Stay very still.

CHARLY

Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab

you're standing on is actually a

land mine. Keep your foot on the

pressure plate, nothing happens.

Step off the stone, we'll all be

wearing you.

PERKINS

Charly, I know we've treated you

poorly, please, it was just business --

CHARLY

My terms are these. Call State and

order full disclosure on your personal

correspondence. Then disband Chapter,

effective immediately. In exchange...?

I won't shoot you, and I won't make

you stand on that mine. I won't touch

you. I won't touch you. I promise.

PERKINS

You... you promise.

PERKINS

It's done. Now, you promise... you

won't shoot me... won't make me get

on the mine...?

CHARLY

I promise.

PERKINS

Goddamn you, I can't hold him... You

bitch... YOU FUCKING BITCH...!

CHARLY

Yes, Mr. President, you have my

assurance that Perkins' latest

operation has been rendered beyond

salvage.

CHARLY

He's not in the greatest shape either.

PRESIDENT

I owe you an astounding debt of

thanks, Colonel. Would it be

impertinent to ask if you'd consider

working for State again? The moneys

involved would be substantial.

CHARLY

Out of the question. I've got a stack

of papers to grade. Listen, before I

go, I need a small favor...

UNIFORM COP #1

...As I say, we can only apologize

for the system, Ma'am, but it's

confirmed that your husband is

innocent of the crime for which he

was imprisoned. This is a photograph

of the actual criminal...

UNIFORM COP #1

A petty thief, now deceased. I'll

respect your wishes should you choose

to file charges against the State

Attorney...

HAL

Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's

gonna need the full braces. Even

with your teaching, insurance won't

cover it... I don't know what to do.

THE END
