ELI

Dear Lord, thank you for your

generosity in providing us today

with this bountiful feast.

ELI

Thank you for the many gifts that

you have given me. Thank you for

your protection and your guidance.

Thank you for bringing me this far.

I know my long journey's end is

near. I ask now only for the

strength and the courage to

complete the task that you in your

infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow

upon me over all men. I won't let

you down. Amen.

6.

ELI

Hey. You hungry?

7.

ELI

Come on now.

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,

take anything you want. You want

some food? Take it.

ELI

I'm not going to hurt you.

YOUNG WOMAN

That's what the last guys said.

ELI

Here.

8.

YOUNG WOMAN

Could you help me? The wheel came

off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I

could get it out of the ditch. But

I can't.

ELI

One good thing about no soap any

more. You can smell the road agents

a mile off.

BANDIT LEADER

Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?

BANDIT LEADER

What you got there in the pack?

ELI

Nothing.

BANDIT LEADER

Yeah, that's what they all say. How

about you take it off real slow and

tip it out so's we can take a look?

9.

BANDIT #2

He's got a gun.

BANDIT LEADER

Shit, it ain't loaded. They never

are. Ain't that right, old man?

(BEAT)

Open the fucking pack or die.

ELI

I can't do that.

BANDIT LEADER

Want us to do it for you? We can

get it off real easy after we've

hacked your fucking arms off.

ELI

It's real important you boys listen

to me and understand. The man I

work for, you do not want to cross

him. See, I'm under his protection.

You stand in my way, you stand in

his. And he will cut you down with

a righteous fury - through me. For

I am his faithful instrument.

BANDIT LEADER

What the hell are you, some kinda

preacher?

ELI

Something like that.

BANDIT LEADER

Well I got news for you, preacher

man. Whatever kinda God you reckon

yourself to be working for, he left

these parts a long time ago. He

ain't here to protect your ass. Now

take off the pack and set it on the

ground.

10.

BANDIT LEADER

You fucking listening to me?

ELI

I hear you. You lay that hand on me

again and you will not get it back.

BANDIT LEADER

All right, I had just about enough

of this shit...

BANDIT LEADER

What... you just... he just cut my

fucking hand off! My fucking hand!

BANDIT LEADER

What you standin' around for? Kiss

him!

BANDIT #3

What's he talkin' about, kiss him?

ELI

He's in shock. He means "kill him".

11.

ELI

I told you you wouldn't be getting

that back.

BANDIT LEADER

Who are you?

ELI

My name is Eli.

ELI

Take it and go on your way. And

don't fall in with men like these

again. No good can come.

YOUNG WOMAN

Why are you doing this?

12.

ELI

God, the father of mercies, through

the death and resurrection of his

son has reconciled the world to

himself and sent the holy spirit

among us for the forgiveness of

sins.

ELI

Through the ministry of the church

may he give you pardon and peace,

and I absolve you from your sins in

the name of the father, and of the

son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.

YOUNG WOMAN

Thank you. You're... a good man.

ELI

There are no good men on the road.

YOUNG WOMAN

Where are you going?

ELI

West.

YOUNG WOMAN

Can... can I come with you?

ELI

No.

13.

ELI

It ain't your concern. Stay on the

path. It ain't your concern. Stay

on the path.

14.

15.

ELI

You got an engineer or a fuelman

around here?

ELI

Thanks.

CHAIN GANG BOSS

Come on, move it!

16.

ENGINEER

I don't know you.

ELI

I'm not from around here.

ENGINEER

No shit. Who are you?

ELI

I'm just a customer.

ENGINEER

A customer with a shotgun?

ENGINEER

You come in here to rip me off?

ELI

No. I'll set it down. Okay?

ENGINEER

Slowly!

ENGINEER

You carry a gun in the outland, you

don't bring one into town less you

live there. Don't you know that?

ELI

I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on

the road a long time.

17.

ENGINEER

Show me your hand.

ELI

I'm not a-

ENGINEER

I said show me your fucking hand!

ELI

I'm not one of them.

ENGINEER

What do you want?

ELI

I'm just passing through. I need

some help. I can pay.

ENGINEER

What kinda help? And what kinda

pay?

ELI

I'm going to get something out of

my pack. Okay?

ELI

I know, I know. Slowly.

ENGINEER

Holy shit.

ENGINEER

Where'd you find this?

18.

ELI

Years ago, in the outland back east

aways.

ENGINEER

Does it work?

ELI

Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can

you do it? I got the cables.

ENGINEER

Depends if you also got the coin.

ENGINEER

It'll take a couple hours. There's

a bar across the street you can

wait, they just opened up.

ELI

I'll wait here.

ENGINEER

You don't trust me?

ELI

(SMILES)

I don't know you.

19.

CARNEGIE

What is it?

REDRIDGE

Survey team just finished up their

inspection. It ain't good.

CARNEGIE

How bad is it?

REDRIDGE

Pressure is down again, and going

by the new rod they sank levels're

lower than they've ever been.

CARNEGIE

How long?

REDRIDGE

Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A

little longer if we're careful. But

we're already-

CARNEGIE

Halve the rations.

REDRIDGE

We just halved `em last-

CARNEGIE

So halve them again!

20.

REDRIDGE

You're going to have to say

something. Folks were none too

happy last time. Gonna be worse

now, you can count on it.

CARNEGIE

I want you all to remember how far

we've come together. And how far we

still can go, if only we believe.

When I brought us here to this

oasis - this promised land - we

knew there would be hardships. Knew

there would be sacrifices. But we

also knew that we were creating for

ourselves a world where we could be

safe from the horrors of the

forsaken lands beyond our borders.

CARNEGIE

And I want you all to remember

above all that it is not the water

with which we have been blessed

that is the true lifeblood of this

town... but faith.

CARNEGIE

It is our faith that sustains us,

brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!

21.

CARNEGIE

And mark me, the ultimate

validation of that faith is coming!

The sacred Word of Our Lord that

formed the world before and will

reform it once again is coming to

this town to bring it succor, bring

it nourishment, bring it new life!

For the Almighty Himself has spoken

unto me and promised it!

CARNEGIE

In the meantime, He has asked us

all to be patient. To walk the hard

road of the faithful just a little

longer. And to do that, we must

give just a little more.

(BEAT)

Water rations will be halved until

further notice.

CARNEGIE

I understand your frustration. The

road to salvation is a difficult

one - but what lies at the end of

that road is a greater glory,

beyond anything you can imagine.

DISCONTENTED VILLAGER

We've heard this all before! When

are you going to-

22.

CARNEGIE

I know each and every one of you

will understand the necessity of

this action. It was faith that

built this town - and faith that

will sustain it even through the

dark times that may lie ahead. But

it is always darkest before dawn -

and the new dawn is coming.

(BEAT)

May God go with you all.

REDRIDGE

One of the road crews just rolled

into town.

CARNEGIE

Of course they did, the bar's open.

Outlanders, always looking for

answers at the bottom of a bottle.

REDRIDGE

Not these guys.

(BEAT)

These guys say they got something.

CARNEGIE

Get them up here now.

23.

CARNEGIE

Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to

see you again! I understand your

latest excursion into the outland

has been a profitable one?

HOG

We did good.

CARNEGIE

Well, let's see, shall we?

24.

CARNEGIE

No. No. No. No. No.

CARNEGIE

It's not here.

HOG

These ain't worth nothin'?

CARNEGIE

When you bring me the book I asked

you for, it'll be worth something.

HOG

We been doin' this a long time now.

Had to make a whole lotta corpses

to bring you all these books. You

want us to keep at it, reckon it's

worth more than a few free glasses

of that swill you call liquor.

CARNEGIE

Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you

once again to take the long view

here. When we find this book - and

believe me, we will find it - we

are going to build a new world. A

world far greater, far more

righteous than this one. And you

and I are going to be perched right

on top of it, looking down upon it,

masters of all creation!

CARNEGIE

And you know, I think you're

absolutely right.

(MORE)

25.

CARNEGIE (cont'd)

That is worth more than a few

glasses of liquor. A whole lot

more.

CARNEGIE

The book I want is out there

somewhere, just waiting to be

found. Once there were millions of

copies - you only need to find one!

Find it and bring it here. And I

promise you, you will be rewarded

beyond anything you can imagine.

HOG

This better not be bullshit.

REDRIDGE

Might help if they knew just what

they were looking for.

CARNEGIE

Not one of them can read. How would

they even know when they found it?

REDRIDGE

So how's about you just tell me?

REDRIDGE

Two years now you been sending

these crews into the outland.

Burning up gas we can barely spare.

For a goddamn book? What the hell

kinda book can be worth all this?

26.

REDRIDGE

What about these?

CARNEGIE

Put them with the others.

ELI

What's this place across the

street? They got any water?

ENGINEER

We got our own underground spring

here. Only fresh water in a hundred

miles - if's you can pay for it.

ELI

I'll be back.

ELI

If that battery ain't here when I

get back, I will use this gun on

your kneecaps and I will put this

building to the torch and I will

watch it burn to the ground with

you alive inside it. So help me

God.

27.

CLAUDIA

Is that you, honey?

CLAUDIA

Something wrong?

CARNEGIE

More books came in from the road

today.

CLAUDIA

Oh? It's been a while.

CARNEGIE

And it'll be a while longer. Just

another pile of useless junk. If we

don't find the right one soon - if

I can't give these people what they

want to hear...

CLAUDIA

You'll find what you're looking

for. It's out there somewhere. You

just have to have faith.

CARNEGIE

Faith? Is that what you think we're

missing around here?

CARNEGIE

My old man used to have faith. He

had it in spades. My mother, too.

(MORE)

28.

CARNEGIE (cont'd)

You know where it got them? You

know where it got me?

CARNEGIE

Faith is for the weak. It's for

them out there, the sheep. This

world is what you can see and touch

and taste. It's what you make it.

All these years with me, you still

don't have any grasp of that?

What's wrong with you, woman?

CLAUDIA

I'm sorry.

CARNEGIE

No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

scare you. Hey. You okay?

CARNEGIE

You just get me all riled up with

that kind of talk. It's not what I

need from you right now.

(SMILES)

You know what I need right now?

BARTENDER

Outlander? Let me see-

29.

BARTENDER

What'll it be?

ELI

Water.

BARTENDER

That's the good stuff. Gotta eat

into my own ration to sell it - so

I don't sell it cheap.

BARTENDER

That'll get you maybe half-way.

BARTENDER

What about that?

ELI

That's the best I got.

BARTENDER

Solara!

30.

BARTENDER

Take this out back and get it

filled.

HOG

That was my cat.

ELI

Fine specimen.

HOG

I saw you push him off the bar.

ELI

I didn't push him.

HOG

You raised your hand at him.

31.

ELI

Sorry. It won't happen again.

BARTENDER

Hey, how about another drink, Hog?

HOG

That cat's been comin' in here for

nigh on two years. It got more

right to be here than you. Who the

fuck do you think you are?

ELI

I don't want any trouble.

HOG

Well, that's too bad, `cause-

ELI

I know you. Murderer of innocent

travelers on the road. You're going

to spend eternity drowning in a

lake of fire for the things that

you've done. Did you know that?

ELI

You go on back to your table and

I'll be on my way. All right?

BURLY PATRON

You push Hog, you push all of us.

32.

ELI

Cursed be the ground because of

you. By toil shall you eat of it.

Thorns and thistles shall it sprout

for you. From the ground were you

taken. For dust you are.

ELI

And to dust you shall return.

CARNEGIE

Did you hear that? What was that?

CLAUDIA

Maybe you should go check.

CARNEGIE

What in the hell is going on?

33.

CARNEGIE

Get your asses out here!

SOLARA

Stop!

SOLARA

Please don't.

ELI

Go.

HOG

(CONFUSED)

...What?

ELI

It ain't for me to judge you. Your

time for that's gonna come. Believe

me. Now go on. Get out of here.

ELI

Thank you.

34.

ELI

I'm sorry for all the mess.

CARNEGIE (O.S.)

Hold it right there.

CARNEGIE

So, who are you?

ELI

Nobody. A walker in the outland.

CARNEGIE

I've met walkers before. Not a

particularly civilized bunch. Some

have even taken to eating their own

kind, did you know that? You

wouldn't be one of those savages

now, would you?

CARNEGIE GUNMAN

He ain't got the shakes.

35.

CARNEGIE

Good. This is a civilized town.

Under God. Do you know what that

means?

CARNEGIE

It means we have laws here. Laws

set down long before any of us ever

walked this earth. And one of them

is, you don't eat the flesh of your

brother. Else you're no better than

an animal. And not welcome here.

CARNEGIE

So what's your business here,

friend? Walkers don't usually come

into town less they want something.

ELI

I had a battery needed charging and

a canteen needed filling. I didn't

come here looking for trouble.

CARNEGIE

Well, you sure as hell found it. Do

you know who I am?

ELI

No.

CARNEGIE

My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.

I own the whole town. You've never

heard of me?

ELI

That's you out there on the street.

CARNEGIE

Remarkable likeness, isn't it?

You'd never guess half the men who

built it were blind. A small

tribute from a grateful people. I

was deeply touched.

36.

ELI

You had slaves build you a monument

to yourself?

CARNEGIE

Don't call them slaves. That's an

old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm

trying to help these people.

CARNEGIE

In the outland the sightless are

preyed upon like sick animals. Here

at least they're protected. They do

the essential work others don't

want. And in return they eat, they

drink, they survive. Last year, a

couple of them even got married -

performed the ceremony myself.

(BEAT)

You see, I'm not exploiting these

people - I'm saving them! Any one

of them is free to leave whenever

they wish. But here they stay. And

they thank me every single day for

their salvation!

ELI

It's none of my business what you

do here. Like you said, it's your

town. I just want to be on my way.

CARNEGIE

What's your name, walker?

CARNEGIE

All right, I guess we just call you

Walker. Don't see too many folks

your age these days. You lived in

the world before? You can read?

ELI

I read every day.

37.

CARNEGIE

ELI

CARNEGIE

(BEAT)

ELI

CARNEGIE

ELI

CARNEGIE

ELI

CARNEGIE

ELI

38.

CARNEGIE

By who?

CARNEGIE

All right, look. I'm going to make

you an offer of goodwill. Stay the

night, think it over. Try a little

local hospitality. We'll talk again

in the morning. If you're still not

interested, you're free to go. No

hard feelings.

ELI

Thank you for your offer. But I'd

prefer to just leave right now. So

you can either let me out of here,

or I can kill my way out.

CARNEGIE

Let him go.

ENGINEER

Oh, shit...

ELI

How's my battery?

ENGINEER

It's, uh... it's gonna take a

little longer than I thought.

ELI

How much longer?

ENGINEER

It's gotta charge overnight. You,

uh, you can always stay here in

town, pick it up in the morning.

39.

ELI

You remember what I said would

happen if I came back here and you

didn't have my battery?

ENGINEER

It's right here! It's just gonna

take a while longer. I swear.

CARNEGIE

I knew you'd reconsider.

ELI

Yeah? How'd you know that?

CARNEGIE

None of the walkers I've seen come

here from the outland were ever

what you'd call smart. I mean all

those years out there alone on the

road, some with their brains half-

fried from eating each other - it's

understandable why you people

aren't the brightest bulbs in the

box. But I never met one so dumb

that he'd turn down a meal and a

bed if it was offered.

ELI

So you didn't send someone across

the street to the engineer?

CARNEGIE

Engineer? I don't know what you're

talking about. If there's something

wrong, maybe I can help.

40.

CARNEGIE

This is Redridge. He's kind of my

right-hand man around here.

CARNEGIE

He'll show you to your room.

REDRIDGE

Enjoy your stay. There'll be

someone outside your room all

night. If you need anything.

ELI

Hello?

CLAUDIA

I have this for you. Water for

washing and some food.

CLAUDIA

Well... are you going to take it?

ELI

Oh. Thank you.

41.

CLAUDIA

You're very welcome.

CLAUDIA

It'll be dark soon.

CLAUDIA

Can I get you anything else?

ELI

No, thank you.

CLAUDIA

Well. Have a good night.

ELI

You're Carnegie's woman?

CLAUDIA

Why do you ask?

ELI

Just making conversation is all.

Haven't had one of those in a

while. Not a real one, leastways.

CLAUDIA

He found me in the outland. I was

sixteen, my family had been...

well, they were gone. There was

just me and my baby.

ELI

You had a baby?

CLAUDIA

I'd met some men on the road. Bad

men. They...

ELI

It's all right.

42.

CLAUDIA

I was on the road for a year after

that. I couldn't feed myself, let

alone my little girl. And then Bill

found us and he promised he'd take

care of us. He told me he was going

to make a place where we could be

safe. And he did. He did all that.

He built this whole town. He kept

us safe. And he raised that child

like she was his own. He's been so

good to both of us. He saved us,

really.

ELI

You want to eat some?

ELI

When did you go blind? In the war?

You get caught in a flash?

CLAUDIA

No, I was born this way. I think

I'm lucky like that.

ELI

Lucky?

CLAUDIA

It's not like I ever knew what I'm

missing. I was already used to

being like this by the time... by

the time it all happened. So I got

around pretty good even when I was

on my own. And now it's easy. I

know every creaky old floorboard in

here, and it's not like I ever go

any place else. Bill would never

allow it. He worries about me so

much.

CLAUDIA

I should go. He'll be wondering

where I am.

43.

CLAUDIA

Thank you. I enjoyed our

conversation.

ELI

So did I.

CARNEGIE

You took your time in there. How

long does it take to deliver a

plate of food and some water?

CLAUDIA

He wanted to talk.

CARNEGIE

Oh? What about?

CLAUDIA

Nothing really. He asked me what it

was like to be blind.

CARNEGIE

He tell you anything about him?

CLAUDIA

No. I don't think he likes to talk

about himself much.

CARNEGIE

Yeah, I got that.

CLAUDIA

I don't think he's going to change

his mind by morning. I don't think

he's going to stay.

CARNEGIE

What makes you say that?

44.

CLAUDIA

Just strikes me as the kind of man

who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't

seem like the type to go changing

it once it's set.

CARNEGIE

Well, we'll just see about that.

CLAUDIA

You saw him. He's not like the

others. You won't be able to smooth-

talk him and wrap him around your

finger like you usually do.

CARNEGIE

Who said anything about me?

(BEAT)

I'm sending Solara.

CLAUDIA

You're doing what?

CARNEGIE

You know how often these walkers

get laid? Never. Least not by

anything living or willing. Girl

like her can be very persuasive.

CLAUDIA

You can't send her in there with

him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!

CARNEGIE

You went in there readily enough.

CLAUDIA

That's different. Solara's just a

child, she can't-

CARNEGIE

She's a grown woman now, Claudia.

Sooner or later you're going to

have to accept that. She has to

earn her keep around here, same as

the rest of us.

CLAUDIA

By working as a whore? That's all

you think she's fit for?

45.

CARNEGIE

We've each been given a talent to

help us make our way in this world.

Some people's gift is more evident

than others. Solara's sure as hell

is.

CLAUDIA

What kind of a man are you?

CARNEGIE

I'm the kind of man who'd pull a

helpless blind girl off the road, a

girl who'd been beaten and raped,

and give her a place where she can

live without fear! Without me you'd

be just another no-eye, lying dead

in the outland, picked clean by the

buzzards, or shoveling dirt down

there with the others. That's the

kind of man I am!

CLAUDIA

I don't live without fear. I

haven't for a long time now.

CARNEGIE

Where are you going?

CLAUDIA

I'm not going to let you do this.

CARNEGIE

You're not going to let me?

(BEAT)

Nobody tells me what I can and

can't do in my own town. Nobody. I

built this world, and I am God

here! So don't go thinking about

screwing with my plans. You know

how this works. Solara goes against

me, you get hurt. You go against

me, she gets hurt.

46.

CARNEGIE

So let's not see anybody get hurt.

Okay?

ELI

Come in.

SOLARA

Hi. Can I come in?

ELI

Someone was already here with food

and water. I got everything I need.

SOLARA

You sure about that?

SOLARA

It's too bright in here. Mind if I

turn it down a little?

SOLARA

That's better. I'm Solara. You're

Walker, right?

47.

ELI

No. My name's Eli.

SOLARA

That short for something? Elias?

ELI

Elijah.

SOLARA

Elijah. I never heard that one

before. It's kinda cute.

ELI

Look, I don't mean to be rude. But

I'm really not interested.

SOLARA

You sure about that? It gets mighty

lonely out there on the road.

SOLARA

If you're worried about money, this

is all paid for. The whole night.

ELI

It's not that. You're a very nice

girl. But I'm not that kind of man.

SOLARA

They're all that kind of man.

ELI

I'm not.

SOLARA

They told me you were crazy. Maybe

they were right.

48.

ELI

I'm sorry. Good night.

SOLARA

Please don't make me leave. I have

to stay the night. If I don't...

ELI

If you don't, what?

SOLARA

He'll hurt my mom.

ELI

Who will? Carnegie?

ELI

Maybe he and I oughta have words.

SOLARA

No! Please, don't!

ELI

He's hurting you. He's hurting your

mother. He's-

SOLARA

He's my dad.

SOLARA

Look, if you want to help me, just

let me stay here tonight. We don't

have to do anything. I'll sleep on

the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my

dad that we had a good time. I'll

be no trouble, I swear.

ELI

You want to have a conversation?

49.

ELI

You know, you don't have to be

afraid of me. What happened down

there in the bar...

SOLARA

I'm not afraid of you. I know you

didn't start that trouble. When I

first saw you, I knew you weren't

the type to go looking for it.

ELI

How'd you know that?

SOLARA

My mom says I'm a good judge of

character. She says I can read

people. That I know a good man when

I see one.

SOLARA

So... you're pretty old, right?

SOLARA

I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't

seen too many people your age. How

old are you exactly?

ELI

You know, I don't rightly remember.

SOLARA

But you're old enough. I mean, you

remember what it was like? In the

world before?

SOLARA

What was it like?

50.

ELI

Better than this.

(BEAT)

People lived longer back then.

Longer than me. Some were more than

a hundred years old.

SOLARA

Come on.

ELI

I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's

not the same. If you're sick or

you're weak or you're old you won't

last long out on the road.

SOLARA

So how come you have?

ELI

Can I read you something?

SOLARA

Wait. You can read?

SOLARA

And you have a book?

ELI

Not just any book.

ELI

The Lord is my shepherd. I shall

not want. He makes me lie down in

green pastures. He leads me beside

still waters. He restores my soul.

He leads me in the paths of

righteousness.

51.

ELI

Though I walk through the valley of

the shadow of death, I will fear no

evil. For you are with me. Your rod

and your staff, they comfort me.

You prepare a table before me in

the presence of my enemies. You

anoint my head with oil. My cup

runs over. Surely goodness and

mercy shall follow me, all the days

of my life. And I will dwell in the

house of the Lord forever.

SOLARA

That's beautiful. Did you write

that?

ELI

(SMILES)

No.

SOLARA

What book is it from? Is it poetry?

ELI

I guess you could think of it that

way. It's from the Holy Bible.

SOLARA

I never heard of it. What's it

about?

ELI

It's about love, and forgiveness,

and life and death, and mercy, and

revenge, and the beginning and the

end of the world. I guess it's

about a little bit of everything.

SOLARA

Can I see?

SOLARA

What? I'm not going to do anything.

ELI

I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect

this book. I can't trust it with

anyone. Not even for a while.

52.

SOLARA

What's so special about that book?

ELI

It's the last one. There are no

other books like this. All the

others are gone - destroyed by the

war or in the burnings that came

after. This is the only one that

survived until now. The last one

anywhere.

SOLARA

How can you know that?

ELI

I just know.

(BEAT)

For a long while after it happened,

I just wandered on the road like

most everybody else. There were

still a lot of people around back

then, in the beginning. I didn't

really know what I should do or

where I was going. I was just

moving from place to place, trying

to stay alive. And then one day I

heard this voice. I don't know how

to explain it, it's like it was

coming from inside me. But I could

hear it, clear as day. Clear as I

can hear you talking to me now.

SOLARA

What did it say?

ELI

It led me to this place, I don't

really know where. And I found this

book buried deep under some rubble.

No way no-one was ever going to

find it if they didn't know exactly

where to look.

SOLARA

But you knew because the voice told

you?

ELI

That's right. And that voice told

me to carry the book west.

(MORE)

53.

ELI (cont'd)

It told me that a path would be

laid out before me, that I'd be led

to a place where this book would be

safe. It told me I'd be protected

against anyone or anything that

tried to stand in my way. If only I

would have faith.

(BEAT)

That was twenty-five years ago. And

I've been walking ever since.

SOLARA

(SKEPTICAL)

Because a voice you heard in your

head told you to.

ELI

I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.

I know what I heard.

SOLARA

So who was it? The voice?

ELI

A very important, very powerful

man.

SOLARA

More powerful than my dad?

ELI

(SMILES)

I should say so, yes.

SOLARA

Would you teach me to read?

ELI

What?

SOLARA

I never learned. No-one around here

knows how. Only my dad, and he

won't teach me. I think he likes

being the only one who can read. I

think it makes him feel powerful.

ELI

I think you're probably right.

54.

SOLARA

So would you teach me?

ELI

I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.

And I won't be back this way, ever.

ELI

Are you hungry?

SOLARA

I guess a little.

ELI

There's some food on the table over

there. Let's eat.

ELI

It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.

(to the rat)

Don't be afraid, pal. This is

Solara. She's our friend.

ELI

It's okay. It means he likes you.

SOLARA

It does?

ELI

Trust me, if he didn't like you,

you'd know about it.

SOLARA

Did you really mean that?

ELI

Mean what?

55.

SOLARA

That I'm your friend.

ELI

Sure.

ELI

Our father, we thank you for this

meal which you have been so

gracious to place before us.

ELI

We thank you for a warm bed and a

roof over our heads on a cold night

such as this.

(BEAT)

And we thank you for the gift of

friendship in these hard times.

ELI

Amen.

(BEAT)

You say that last part too.

SOLARA

Amen. And now we eat?

ELI

And now we eat.

56.

CARNEGIE

Good morning, Solara.

CARNEGIE

I said good morning, Solara.

SOLARA

Morning, dad.

CARNEGIE

How was your night? Did you sleep

well?

SOLARA

I did like you asked. Isn't that

what you really want to know? Just

come out and say it.

CARNEGIE

You don't speak to your father like

that. When I ask you a civil

question, I expect a civil answer.

CARNEGIE

Did he say anything?

SOLARA

No. We didn't talk much.

CARNEGIE

Well, do you think you managed to

change his mind about staying?

SOLARA

I don't know. He said he had to go.

57.

CARNEGIE

So he did talk? What else did he

say? Come on, I want all of it!

SOLARA

That's all he said. That he was

going to be leaving this morning.

CARNEGIE

We'll see. This is my town, nobody

leaves until I say they leave.

CLAUDIA

Solara, honey, eat something.

SOLARA

Our father, thank you for this meal

which you have been so gracious to

place before us.

SOLARA

Thank you for my mother. Please

watch over her and keep her safe.

CARNEGIE

Solara...

SOLARA

Thank you for all the-

CARNEGIE

Solara!

CARNEGIE

What the hell are you doing?

CARNEGIE

God didn't put this food on the

table. Do you hear me?

(BEAT)

Who put this food on the table?

58.

CARNEGIE

I said who put this food on the

table?

SOLARA

(SOFTLY)

You did.

CARNEGIE

Who taught you that?

SOLARA

Eli taught me.

CARNEGIE

(PUZZLED)

Who the hell is Eli?

SOLARA

The walker. That's his name.

CARNEGIE

And he taught you how to say those

words? How did he know them?

SOLARA

He had them written down in a book.

CARNEGIE

What kind of a book?

SOLARA

I don't remember! It was an old

leather book. It had kind of a...

thing on the front of it.

CARNEGIE

Show me.

CARNEGIE

He had a bible?

SOLARA

That's what it was. A holy bible.

Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...

59.

REDRIDGE

Something wrong, boss?

CARNEGIE

Something wrong? Something wrong?

The walker's gone!

REDRIDGE

That can't be. I had a man outside

his room the whole time.

CARNEGIE

He jumped out the window, you

idiot! You didn't think to put a

man outside the fucking window?

(beat; fuming)

Find him. Now!

REDRIDGE

Boss, he could be anywhere. He...

(REALIZATION)

A battery. Didn't he say something

about a battery?

60.

CARNEGIE

Go! Go!

61.

ELI

(quietly; to himself)

It ain't your concern. Stay on the

path.

ELI

Dammit...

ELI

Let her go.

62.

CARNEGIE

That cannon of yours casts a pretty

wide net. I don't reckon you can

hit me without hitting her.

ELI

I reckon you're right.

ELI

This, though? With this I'll shave

the hairs clean off your balls at a

hundred paces. You believe me?

CARNEGIE

I believe you. I have to say I'm

surprised to hear that language

coming from you, though. I mean,

you being a holy man and all.

CARNEGIE

She told me all about it. Told me

all about the bible, too.

(BEAT)

Can I see it?

ELI

No.

CARNEGIE

You know, I've been searching for a

book like that one for years. All

I've ever wanted was to bring the

word of God to these poor

unfortunates here. To shine its

light upon them and give them

something in this wretched world

that they could believe in.

Something to live for! It's why I

built this town, did you know that?

All we've been missing is the word

to show us the way. And now, praise

the Lord, you've brought it to us.

63.

CARNEGIE

It's not right to keep that book

hidden away, all to yourself. The

word is meant to be shared with

others. It's meant to be spread!

Isn't that what you want? I could

help you do that. You and me, we

could do it together.

ELI

The Lord himself told me that if I

carried this book west, one day I

would find the place where it was

needed. Where it would be safe.

Where it belonged.

ELI

But this ain't it.

ELI

Come on.

SOLARA

What? What is it?

ELI

You shall not make for yourself any

graven image...

64.

ELI

Now we can go.

SOLARA

Where are we going?

ELI

I told you where I'm going. You're

free to go wherever you want.

SOLARA

Wait... I'm not coming with you?

ELI

You're only going to slow me down.

SOLARA

So what the hell was all that about

back there?

ELI

The man was hurting you. I don't

like that, so I put a stop to it.

Now you're free. He can't hurt you

any more.

(off her stare)

No need to thank me.

SOLARA

Thank you? For what? What am I

supposed to do now?

ELI

Whatever you want. That's what

being free is.

SOLARA

Whatever I want. Except go with

you.

65.

ELI

I have to get where I'm going. I

can't be worrying about someone

else along the way.

SOLARA

I thought you were my friend.

ELI

It's dangerous in the outland. I

wouldn't want you to get hurt.

SOLARA

I'll be safe so long as I'm with

you. I know it.

ELI

You don't want this life. I gotta

do what I gotta do. Don't have no

choice in it. But you do. And I

can't let you choose this. You

don't want to be like me. You don't

want to spend your life alone.

SOLARA

If I came with you, I wouldn't be

alone. And neither would you.

ELI

I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best

you just go on back to town.

SOLARA

Fine! I'll do just that! I had a

life there! A family! I didn't ask

you to save me! I didn't ask you

for anything!

66.

SOLARA

(SOFTLY)

Fine.

CARNEGIE

Thank you, darling.

REDRIDGE

He killed four of my men and walked

out of town without a scratch. They

shot off a hundred rounds at him

and he didn't get hit once. I never

even heard of anything like that.

CARNEGIE

You know, I always thought of

myself as a shepherd. Bringing

together the wayward and the lost.

Tending to my flock. But all the

things I want to do, I can't do

them on my own. The one thing I've

needed is the one thing that's

always been missing. Then one day

it walks right into town - so close

I can almost touch it - and then

walks right on out again.

67.

CARNEGIE

I want you to put a crew together

and go out after him.

REDRIDGE

He's not going to work for you. I

think he's made that plain.

CARNEGIE

I'm not interested in him any more.

I only want the book he's carrying.

REDRIDGE

If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting

down this maniac in the outland, I

need to know it's gonna be worth

it. I need to know what's so

special about this goddamn book.

CARNEGIE

You have no idea. You're too young,

you don't remember the world

before. But I do. I remember.

CARNEGIE

When I was a kid my parents used to

read that book every goddamn day.

My mother, she'd read it along with

this smooth-talking preacher on the

TV screen. They used to be able to

beam these guys right into your

house, into every house in the

world, through the air. Like magic.

(BEAT)

She worked two jobs and she sent

every spare penny she had to that

fucking guy on the TV. My old man,

he'd read that book, then he'd get

liquored up and kick my ass, tell

me all about the power and the

glory and how I was going to burn

forever in hell for the sins I was

born with. He made sure he beat it

into me good.

CARNEGIE

Don't you see? It's not just any

book.

(MORE)

68.

CARNEGIE (cont'd)

It has the power to motivate

people. It can give them hope, it

can terrify them. It can shape

them. Control them.

(BEAT)

Do you remember how I built this

town? It wasn't done with force,

and it wasn't done just with water.

It was done with the power of

words. I created this place out of

nothing, because people believed in

a promise that I sold to them.

Those guys on the TV, they were

richer than you could ever dream,

and it was all built the same way.

With words. With promises. And with

that book.

(BEAT)

That book is a weapon. Aimed right

at the hearts and minds of the weak

and the desperate. Just imagine

what I could do with it.

REDRIDGE

Boss... we're running out of water

and the people are running out of

patience. You're trying to tell me

that a book is going to keep them

in line?

CARNEGIE

Oh, it'll do much more than that.

The water in this town may run dry,

but faith - that springs eternal!

And that faith will help turn this

town into a city. And this city

into a nation. It will help me

build a new world. In my image.

People will come from far and wide

to hear what's inside of it.

They'll follow me anywhere just to

get a taste of it. And they'll do

whatever I tell them.

REDRIDGE

And what if this book don't work?

What if it don't say what you want

it to say?

69.

CARNEGIE

Oh, it'll say what I want, I can

promise you that. Because I'm going

to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts

that work for me and make the rest

whatever I need it to be.

(BEAT)

A new bible, for a new world.

CARNEGIE

What do you think, darling? A whole

new world, to do with as we will.

Won't that be grand?

CARNEGIE

Find that book.

REDRIDGE

He has half a day on us already.

CARNEGIE

So use the motor pool.

REDRIDGE

There ain't much gas in reserve.

CARNEGIE

Whatever there is, use it.

CLAUDIA

What about Solara?

CLAUDIA

She's still out there. With him.

CARNEGIE

Right. Right. Of course. Bring her

back, too, if you can. But-

REDRIDGE

The book. I know.

70.

SOLARA

Shit. Shit.

SOLARA

Where the hell am I?

71.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Hello?

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Hello? Can anyone help me?

SLUMPED FEMALE

Hello? Is anybody there?

72.

SOLARA

Are you all right?

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You

go along, I'll be okay.

SOLARA

You look like you need some help.

YOUNG WOMAN

No, really! I'm fine. Really... I

need a man to help. Not you. You

just keep along. Please.

SOLARA

It'll just take a minute.

YOUNG WOMAN

Really, it's fine! Please!

YOUNG WOMAN

Let her go! She ain't got nothing!

BRIGAND LEADER

I ain't too sure about that.

YOUNG WOMAN

This wasn't the deal!

73.

BRIGAND LEADER

Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta

be grateful you're getting a break.

BRIGAND LEADER

Never did care much for that dried-

up old snatch anyhow.

BRIGAND LEADER

This one, though... this one looks

fresh. You a virgin?

BRIGAND LEADER

Well, let's find out.

74.

ELI

I offer you both one final chance

in this life to seek forgiveness

for your sins so that your souls

may find salvation. Will you say

with me the act of contrition?

BRIGAND LEADER

Fuck you.

ELI

Some might think it'd be most

fitting to leave you here like

this. Let you die slow in the sun.

But I know better. I know where

you're going. And the sooner you

get there, the sooner you'll get

what's coming to you.

RIFLE BANDIT

Wait!

75.

RIFLE BANDIT

I want to say it. I want to be

forgiven.

ELI

Repeat after me. Oh God, I am

heartily sorry for having offended

thee, and I detest all my sins.

ELI

I firmly resolve, with the help of

thy grace, to confess my sins, and

do penance, and to amend my life.

Amen.

RIFLE BANDIT

Amen...

SOLARA

You came back for me.

ELI

What are friends for?

ELI

This is the deal. You keep up. You

pull your weight. You fall behind,

I can't help you. Okay?

SOLARA

Okay.

SOLARA

What about her?

76.

ELI

There's nothing can be done for

her.

SOLARA

You killed it! That cute little

thing!

77.

ELI

It's good eating, is what it is.

SOLARA

That's not funny.

ELI

If you're going to be on the road,

you can't be picky about what you

eat. You eat what's there to eat.

SOLARA

I'm not eating that.

ELI

(SHRUGS)

More for me.

ELI

Father, we thank you for your

generosity in providing us with

this meal. Bless this food to our

use and us to thy service, and keep

us ever mindful of the needs of

others. Amen.

SOLARA

What does that taste like?

ELI

Tastes like chicken.

78.

SOLARA

What is that?

ELI

It's a Saint Christopher medal.

SOLARA

Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a

character from your book?

ELI

Christopher was a man who lived a

long time ago. He wanted to be a

good man, he wanted to help people.

So he would stand by a river that

had no bridge and carry people

across. He was a big strong man and

there was no one he couldn't carry.

ELI

Then one day a young child came to

the river and asked to be carried

across. Christopher tried to carry

him but he was too heavy. He was

just a small boy but he was heavier

than any man he had ever carried.

The boy explained that he was the

son of God, and that he was so

heavy because he bore all the sins

of the world. After that,

Christopher was able to carry him

across and when they got to the

other side the boy baptized him in

the river. And that's how he became

a saint. Later on, he was known as

the patron saint of travelers.

SOLARA

What is a saint, anyway?

79.

ELI

It's someone who spent their life

doing good things for others.

Enough that God himself took a

special interest in them.

SOLARA

Someone like you.

ELI

No. Not like me. Saints ain't

killers. And I done too much of

that. Spilled too much blood.

SOLARA

Will you read me some more from the

book?

ELI

It's late. You should get some

sleep. Maybe tomorrow.

SOLARA

Eli?

WELCOME TO WAL-MART

MY NAME IS "ELI"

HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

80.

ELI

What are you doing?

SOLARA

You scared me! I thought you were

asleep.

ELI

On the road you sleep with one eye

open. I asked you what you were

doing.

SOLARA

I just wanted to see the book.

ELI

You want to see the book, you ask

me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.

Until it gets where it's going. Do

you understand?

ELI

Tell me you understand!

SOLARA

Okay! I understand! Ow!

ELI

It's no use to you anyway. You

don't know how to read it.

81.

SOLARA

Well... now we have the time, maybe

you can teach me.

ELI

Maybe. Get some sleep.

REDRIDGE

He's been here.

REDRIDGE

The girl's with him.

REDRIDGE

Move out!

REDRIDGE

I said move out!

CARNEGIE GUNMAN

I heard this guy's protected

somehow, some... power from up

above. That there ain't nothing on

this earth can touch him.

REDRIDGE

He's just a man. You put a bullet

in him, he'll go down like any

other. I don't want to hear no more

of this superstitious horseshit!

82.

SOLARA

You say you've been walking for

twenty-five years. Have you ever

considered that you might be lost?

ELI

No.

SOLARA

But how can you know? How can you

know this is the right way?

ELI

I told you. My path has been laid

out before me.

SOLARA

Yeah, but laid out by who?

ELI

By Almighty God.

SOLARA

Well if this God guy's so mighty,

how come it's taking you so long to

get where you're going? Doesn't he

know the way?

ELI

You want to stay on this road with

me, don't ever let me hear you take

his name in vain like that again.

SOLARA

Sorry.

83.

ELI

God has a reason for everything

being the way it is. It's not

always apparent to us. But it is

his plan nonetheless.

SOLARA

So, is he talking to you right now?

Telling you where to go?

ELI

It's not like that. It's kinda hard

to explain. I'm guided by faith.

SOLARA

I don't know what that word means.

ELI

It means you know something even

though you don't know it.

SOLARA

That doesn't make any sense at all.

ELI

It doesn't have to.

SOLARA

I don't get it. It looks almost...

normal. Like nothing ever happened.

How can it still be out here?

84.

ELI

I don't know.

SOLARA

Maybe we should look inside. There

might be food.

ELI

Stay behind me.

SOLARA

This is weird.

ELI

Yeah.

ELI

Shit.

SOLARA

What?

85.

ELDERLY MAN

Who are you?

ELI

My name is Eli. This is Solara.

We're travelers, that's all. We

don't mean you any harm.

ELDERLY MAN

You cut my padlock. I saw you.

Trying to break into our house.

ELI

I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody

lived here. We thought it was

abandoned, like all the rest.

ELDERLY MAN

Take a look around you. Look at

this yard. Does it look abandoned

to you?

ELI

No, sir. I... like what you've done

with the place.

ELDERLY MAN

What's your business here?

ELI

No business. We're sorry to have

troubled you. If you'll let us down

we'll happily be on our way.

ELDERLY WOMAN

George, look at them! They're not

robbers or road agents! One of

them's just a girl!

ELDERLY MAN

Seen that before. Oldest trick in

the book.

86.

ELDERLY WOMAN

Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them

down!

ELDERLY WOMAN

I'm so sorry about my husband. We

so rarely get visitors these days,

he's suspicious of everybody.

(BEAT)

I'm Martha and this is my husband

George. Would you care for some

tea?

MARTHA

I'm afraid we don't have any cake

or biscuits for the tea. They ran

out some time ago.

MARTHA

Please.

87.

MARTHA

How do you like it?

ELI

It's.. uh...

SOLARA

It's very good.

ELI

Have you always lived here?

MARTHA

For almost forty years now. This

home is our pride and joy, isn't

it, George?

MARTHA

We refused to leave, even during

the troubles. We said, didn't we

George, we said if we're going to

die anywhere, we're going to die

right here, in our own home.

ELI

I don't understand how you've

survived out here this long.

MARTHA

Well, George is something of a

handyman, aren't you, dear? He did

a lot of work on the place, making

it safe. We may be old, but we're

resilient. We've had more than a

few who've tried to take this place

from us. Haven't we, George?

GEORGE

Yes. Yes we have.

88.

SOLARA

Are these... graves?

MARTHA

Of course. It would be uncivilized

not to bury them. We're not

barbarians.

GEORGE

Plus, it's good for the soil.

MARTHA

Come on back inside. I think I

might be able to rustle up some

sandwiches.

ELI

We have to get out of here.

SOLARA

They look so sweet... I would never

have believed they were killers.

ELI

They're worse than that.

SOLARA

What?

ELI

They didn't just kill these people.

(BEAT)

They ate them.

SOLARA

They what?

ELI

There's a disease in the outland.

Spread by eating human meat. It

affects the brain. Dementia, loss

of motor function. Did you notice

the old woman's hands shaking?

She's got it. They've both got it.

89.

SOLARA

Oh my God...

MARTHA (O.S.)

I found some meat for those

sandwiches! Are you hungry?

SOLARA

No! Thank you!

ELI

We really must be going.

GEORGE

So soon?

ELI

Yes, I'm afraid so.

MARTHA

Are you sure you won't stay?

ELI

Yes. Thank you again for the tea.

SOLARA

Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.

90.

ELI

Are you sure?

SOLARA

I recognize the cars.

ELI

Back inside.

GEORGE

What did you bring upon us?

MARTHA

George? What's wrong?

GEORGE

A whole convoy of armed

degenerates, that's what's wrong!

Coming here for them! And they led

them right to us!

MARTHA

Oh no they don't...

GEORGE

Martha, what are you doing?

MARTHA

I finally got this house just the

way I want it. I'm not going to let

anybody tear it apart!

91.

SOLARA

Where did you get all this stuff?

GEORGE

Took `em off them who came looking

to take the place from us. Built up

quite the stash over the years.

GEORGE

You know how to fire a gun?

SOLARA

My daddy showed me once.

GEORGE

Just like riding a bike.

SOLARA

I never rode a bike.

GEORGE

How about you, you know how to-

GEORGE

Never mind.

REDRIDGE

We know you're in there! Come on

out with your hands up and your

weapons on the deck and nobody

needs to get hurt.

92.

REDRIDGE

All right, look. I'm gonna make it

easy on y'all. Bring out the girl

with the book.

REDRIDGE (O.S.)

That's all we want. The girl and

the book. The rest of you's can go

your way.

SOLARA

What are we going to do?

ELI

Hand me my pack.

CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2

They ain't comin' out. They-

THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY

REDRIDGE

Holy shi...

93.

REDRIDGE

Get down! Everybody get down!

REDRIDGE

Damn you, return fire!

MARTHA

Come and get it, you god-damn sons

of mother-fucking bitches!

ELI

It's all right. We're going to be

all right. Trust me.

ELI

You remember what I told you about

faith?

94.

ELI

We're going to get out of this

alive. Both of us. I know.

SOLARA

Because God told you?

ELI

Because God told me.

GEORGE

What about us?

ELI

He didn't mention you.

GEORGE

Martha? Martha!

95.

REDRIDGE

We got any more of those RPGs?

CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3

That was it.

REDRIDGE

Screw this.

REDRIDGE

Get clear!

ELI

Solara?

SOLARA (O.S.)

Eli!

ELI

Are you all right?

96.

SOLARA

I'm fine.

SOLARA

Oh God...

ELI

Come on. We're going out the back.

We're running.

REDRIDGE

Go ahead and try it, holy man. You

ain't that fast.

REDRIDGE

Where's the book?

REDRIDGE

I ain't playing.

REDRIDGE

Check the pack.

CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4

It ain't here.

97.

REDRIDGE

It's gotta be.

REDRIDGE

Hello, what have we here?

REDRIDGE

Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!

REDRIDGE

If you don't got the book, what

fucking use are you?

SOLARA

Wait!

SOLARA

It's here! I've got it! Please

don't kill him.

ELI

Solara...

SOLARA

It's just a book, Eli. No book is

worth giving up your life for.

ELI

You're wrong.

98.

REDRIDGE

You did good, sweetheart. Your

daddy would be proud. He knew you'd

come through for him.

SOLARA

He said he would hurt my mom. If I

didn't help him.

REDRIDGE

(SMILING)

Daddy's little girl...

SOLARA

I want you to let him go.

REDRIDGE

What?

SOLARA

You've got what you came for. You

don't need him. Let him go.

REDRIDGE

He's killed a dozen of my men.

SOLARA

If you hurt him, I'm not coming

back with you. You'll have to drag

me kicking and screaming.

REDRIDGE

Take your shit and get out of here.

REDRIDGE

No weapons.

99.

ELI

I told you we'd both live. Now do

you have faith?

DRIVER

What the hell...?

REDRIDGE

Stop, stop!

REDRIDGE

Shit. Turn around!

DRIVER

We ain't got the gas for it!

100.

REDRIDGE

She's getting away!

DRIVER

We got the book! And we got barely

enough gas to make it back as it

is! We can't go chasin' her!

REDRIDGE

Stupid little bitch...

(BEAT)

Drive on.

SOLARA

Come on, come on...

SOLARA

No... No!

SOLARA

Eli! Eli!

101.

SOLARA

Eli...

ELI

Thought you'd gone back to town.

SOLARA

I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so

sorry.

ELI

For what?

SOLARA

For what? I betrayed you! I gave

them the book!

ELI

You did what you believed you had

to.

SOLARA

You're not mad at me?

ELI

I forgive you.

SOLARA

Here. I thought you might still

need this.

ELI

Thank you.

SOLARA

What are you going to do now?

ELI

Same as always. Keep heading west.

SOLARA

Why? I mean, you don't have the

book any more.

102.

ELI

But I still have my faith.

SOLARA

What's that?

ELI

It's grass. It used to grow all

over the place.

SOLARA

How come it's here?

ELI

I don't know. Less poison in the

air this near to the ocean, maybe.

SOLARA

What's wrong?

ELI

Nothing. Just a cramp.

SOLARA

What?

ELI

Do you smell that?

SOLARA

Smell what?

ELI

Salt in the air. We're close to the

ocean. We're almost there.

103.

ELI

Come on.

ELI

Watch your footing. Step where I

step.

SOLARA

This... this is the world before?

104.

ELI

What's left of it.

ELI

Do you see that?

SOLARA

I see it. Is that it?

ELI

That's it.

105.

VOICE (O.S.)

Who goes there?

ALCATRAZ GUARD

Identify yourselves!

ELI

My name is Elijah Stone. I have a

message for your boss. I need you

to tell him that I have a King

James Bible in my possession.

ALCATRAZ GUARD

Remain where you are! Do not

attempt to move or you will be

fired upon!

ALCATRAZ GUARD

Be prepared to surrender any

weapons at the gate!

106.

SOLDIER

They're clean.

THIN MAN

Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor

Lombardi. I'm the curator here.

ELI

Elijah Stone.

SOLARA

Solara.

LOMBARDI

Solara. What a delightful name. Is

that by any chance Shakespearean?

SOLARA

I, uh, I think it's Japanese.

LOMBARDI

Wonderful.

LOMBARDI

Is it true what they tell me? You

have a King James Version?

ELI

Been carrying it with me for twenty-

five years.

LOMBARDI

My goodness. I can't tell you how

exciting this is. Well, come, come!

(MORE)

107.

LOMBARDI (cont'd)

I'll give you the nickel tour and

then we can all sit down and take a

look at it.

LOMBARDI

Yes, we've been doing this for some

time now. Collected over thirty

thousand volumes from generous

donors all across the nation. We

even have a printing press that we

hope to have operational soon.

SOLARA

You turned the whole prison into a

library?

LOMBARDI

Well, not exactly. We're more like

a storage facility. We're holding

these books here in trust, if you

like. When society gets back on its

feet and no longer needs us to

preserve these volumes, they'll be

here waiting.

(BEAT)

I must ask you, how did you hear

about us? We've been doing

everything we can to get the word

out, but we always like to know

where our benefactors come from.

ELI

I was sent here by God.

108.

LOMBARDI

Is that right? Well, it's good to

know we're getting such high-

profile referrals these days.

(BEAT)

I must say, I am so excited that we

finally have a King James. You

know, we have a Talmud here, we

have two Korans, we even have that

Scientology book. But never a

Christian bible, until now. I

honestly believed it was the one

book I'd never see again, after

what happened...

LOMBARDI

May I ask what condition it's in?

ELI

It's a little beat-up. But it'll do

the job.

LOMBARDI

Well, then. What say we take a look

at it?

ELI

Is there someplace we could sit?

LOMBARDI

Of course. Right this way.

CARNEGIE

Did you get it?

CARNEGIE

Show me.

109.

CARNEGIE

The new world begins here...

CARNEGIE

What the fuck is this?

ELI

Do you have something you can write

with?

LOMBARDI

Mmm? Oh, yes of course!

LOMBARDI

Could you please bring us some

writing paper?

ELI

Bring a lot of it.

REDRIDGE

What? What is it?

ELI

Are you ready?

LOMBARDI

What exactly am I writing?

110.

ELI

Pay close attention and write down

every word exactly as I say it.

ELI

The First Book of Moses called

Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In

the beginning God created the

heavens and the earth. Verse two.

The earth was without form, and

void; and darkness was on the face

of the deep. And the spirit of God

was hovering over the face of the

waters. Verse three. And God said,

"Let there be light," and there was

light.

CLAUDIA

What's wrong?

CARNEGIE

You told me once that you know how

to read this. This blind language.

CLAUDIA

Well, a long time ago, when I was a

little girl...

CARNEGIE

You're going to read it for me.

Every word. And I'm going to write

it down. Start at the beginning.

111.

CLAUDIA

I'm sorry. It's been so long. I

don't remember. I don't remember

any of it.

CARNEGIE

God fucking dammit!

CLAUDIA

Bill, is there something-

CARNEGIE

Just go. Just get out of my sight.

ELI (V.O.)

Dear Lord, thank you for giving me

the strength and the conviction to

complete the task you entrusted to

me. Thank you for guiding me

straight and true, through the many

obstacles in my path.

(MORE)

112.

ELI (V.O.) (cont'd)

And for keeping me resolute when

all around seemed lost.

ELI (V.O.)

Thank you for your protection and

for your many signs along the way.

ELI (V.O.)

Thank you for the good that I have

done. For whatever light you were

able to shine into the darkness of

this world through me.

113.

HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE

DIED AUGUST 21, 2048

FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD

AND FRIEND TO SOLARA

LOMBARDI

You know, you don't have to leave.

You're welcome to stay here with

us. You'll be safe.

SOLARA

Thanks.

SOLARA

But I gotta do what I gotta do.

LOMBARDI

Where will you go?

SOLARA

Home.

ELI (V.O.)

Thank you for the friend I made.

114.

ELI (V.O.)

Please watch over her as you

watched over me.

ELI (V.O.)

Thank you for allowing me finally

to rest. I'm so very tired. The

time of my departure is at hand and

now I surrender my soul into your

care, at peace in knowing that I

have carried out your will. That I

have done right with my time on

this earth.

ELI (V.O.)

I have fought the good fight. I

have finished the race.

ELI (V.O.)

I have kept the faith.

FADE OUT:
