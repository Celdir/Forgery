Man On Fire

Based on the novel by

(V 2.0)

CREASY'S VOICE

Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the

name of charity and good will shepherds

the weak through the valley of darkness

for he is truly his brother's keeper and

the finder of lost children.

DISSOLVE TO:

JORDAN

The family paid the ransom and he was

returned two days later.

(laughs; chews)

His father still hasn't gotten up the

nerve to ask him if they fucked him up

the ass.

SAMUEL

And now every mother with money in Mexico

City wants bigger and better bodyguards.

My own wife included.

JORDAN

If she pisses you off, you get another one.

SAMUEL

(laughs grimly)

Do you know what she told me last night?

FLASH TO:

LISA

A man's worth can be judged by what he

has or what he owes. Only the amount

matters.

SAMUEL

And bankruptcy. Where will that put me

in the social strata?

LISA

I'm only asking for one thing. And it's

not an extravagance. It's not even for

me; it's for our daughter.

SAMUEL

Our daughter.

LISA

Our child's safety is at stake.

SAMUEL

(stops playing)

These people are professionals. They

don't waste their time taking children

whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

LISA

Samuel, it is not something we should

skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the

car or outside the school was at least

some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I

feel totally exposed.

RETURN TO:

SAMUEL

Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be

as beautiful as her mother one day.

JORDAN

Yeah?   And if she was ugly?

JORDAN

All my clients have kidnap and ransom

insurance.

SAMUEL

I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and

my family and when it runs out in sixty

days, without a bodyguard, I will not be

able to renew it.

JORDAN

I know you need to please Lisa. An ass

like that is hard to find. Good

bodyguards are even harder.

SAMUEL

(interrupts)

I know! I just had to let one go because

I couldn't afford him!

JORDAN

You need a bodyguard of some description.

It's a dangerous world we live in. But

you will get what you pay for. He

doesn't need to be Superman, does he?

Can you go fifteen grand?

SAMUEL

For a year?

JORDAN

For a few months. Hire someone cheap.

You have to have a bodyguard to keep the

insurance. Then fire him for

incompetence. The important thing is

Lisa's daughter will return to school.

SAMUEL

And Lisa will be able to save face.    We

won't be the only family without a

bodyguard.

JORDAN

Her beauty fucks with your mind.

SAMUEL

For an American she understands this

country very well.

JORDAN

She understands men.

CUSTOMS

Where are you coming from?

CREASY

South America.

CUSTOMS

Where are you staying in Mexico?

CREASY

I'm on to Juarez.

CUSTOMS

Why?

CREASY

I have a friend there.

CUSTOMS

I cannot see your eyes, Senor.

CUSTOMS

Senor?

CREASY

It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.

The gun you're about to find in that

suitcase.

RAYBURN

Rayburn here.

CREASY

When did Mexican Customs start getting

smart?

RAYBURN

Creasy???   Where the fuck are you?

CREASY

I'm here.

RAYBURN

What do you mean, I'm here?

CREASY

I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico

City International. Bring a bunch of

cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

RAYBURN

This is going to cost you big time.

RAYBURN

You got a secondary search and you had a

gun.

CREASY

Listen it was a calculated risk. I've

done it a million times and never got

caught.

RAYBURN

Everything happens once if you live long

enough.

CREASY

It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags

coming off the plane.

RAYBURN

This is Mexico, they do everything

backwards.

RAYBURN

So what's wrong?

CREASY

Nothing wrong.

RAYBURN

Don't give me that bullshit.

CREASY

So how's business?

RAYBURN

Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap

labor. Factory space. But they feel a

lot safer living over the border in El

Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They

think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.

CREASY

But don't you stay in El Paso?

RAYBURN

Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king

down here.

CREASY

Yeah, right...

RAYBURN

Oh, like you haven't been in worse

places.

CREASY

And a level five shithole is better than

a level six. Your logic's inescapable.

RAYBURN

You been working?

CREASY

Not for eight months. I was in Columbia

looking around, but, nothing seemed

interesting.

RAYBURN

How long you staying, Crease?

CREASY

(shrugs)

Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just

wanted to see you, how you were. Came by

on impulse.

RAYBURN

You did something on impulse?

CREASY

Everything happens once if you live long

enough.

PINTA

Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or

wealth. People ask you so often that you

can't have any left. Give me God what

you still have. Give me what no one else

asks for. Amen.

LISA

You should be sleeping, baby.

PINTA

I'm trying, mom.

LISA

Good news.     You're going back to school.

PINTA

(sits up; excited)

When?

LISA

Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard.

It may take a few days, but you're going

back.

PINTA

Could he speak English?     Emilio couldn't

speak English.

LISA

We'll see. And thank your father in the

morning. A man always needs to be

thanked.

RAYBURN

That's right, a bodyguard.

RAYBURN

Your Spanish is good enough.     You

certainly look the part.

CREASY

You're crazy. People would hire a has-

been, Ray? A drunk?

RAYBURN

Well, you'd have to keep it under

control.

CREASY

And what if, just say, there was a kidnap

attempt?

RAYBURN

You do your best. They won't be paying

you enough to perform miracles.

RAYBURN

It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at

half speed you're pretty damn good.

CREASY

A bodyguard has to be close to someone

all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not

good at that.

RAYBURN

So you'll be the silent type.    People

will appreciate that.

RAYBURN

What are you doing here?

CREASY

I came to visit you.

RAYBURN

Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years.

You don't visit.

CREASY

A bodyguard... Who's the guy?

RAYBURN

Samuel Ramos.    Owns one of the plants in

Juarez. The    Jap car industry is in the

toilet. He's    trying to persuade Ford to

partner with   him. I think he's in

trouble. He    asked me if I knew anyone he

could trust.

CREASY

Oh, now you think I can be trusted.

RAYBURN

Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air.

Then decide if you want to... stick

around or not.

RAYBURN

Instructional tape on what I tell my

clients about bodyguarding.

SAMUEL

You drive easily. Smoothly.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)

Were you provided with a gun?

CREASY

Yes.

SAMUEL

Show me, please.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)

What is it?

CREASY

Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

SAMUEL

Have you used this type before?

SAMUEL

Is it loaded?

CREASY

It's loaded.

SAMUEL

You will meet my wife first. She would

like it if you are presentable, polite

and respectful. You'll be the fifth

candidate she's seen this week.

SAMUEL

Your resume is impressive. Nine years in

the Army. Extensive counter terrorism

work. I shouldn't be able to afford you

in my current state. What's the catch?

CREASY

(honest)

I drink.

SAMUEL

How does it affect you?

CREASY

My coordination. Reaction time. If top

professionals try to kidnap your

daughter, the service will be on par with

the pay.

SAMUEL

And what if amateurs try it?

CREASY

I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely?

SAMUEL

No. And no one is to know of your

drinking problem. That includes my wife.

LISA

The world of our children.   How dare

they?

CREASY

(shrugs)

It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

LISA

You're American.

CREASY

So are you.

SAMUEL

(introducing)

My wife, Mr. Creasy.

LISA

Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

LISA (CONT'D)

Would you like a drink?

CREASY

Thank you.     Scotch and a little water.

LISA

You've done much of this work before?

CREASY

Never.

SAMUEL

He has experience in related work.     A

great deal of it.

LISA

Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

CREASY

No.   I do not have family.

CREASY

Thank you.

LISA

Pinta!

PINTA

Yes, mom?

LISA

This is Mr. Creasy.

LISA

Pinta, show him to his room.

PINTA

This way, Mr. Creasy.

LISA

I think it's nice he's American.

SAMUEL

I think it's fantastic.

LISA

You realize that you've brought a killer

into the house.

LISA

Thank you.     I feel better now.

PINTA

Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?

CREASY

If they like me.

PINTA

Frank doesn't take to most people.       Do

you speak German?

CREASY

(in German)

Ein Klines Bisschen.     [A tiny bit.]

PINTA

Frank only responds to commands in

German. He was trained in Frankfurt.

My Dad loves the idea of having a dog

around, but hates the fact he lives

inside.

PINTA

We fixed the room up two weeks ago.       Mom

and I. It's nicer than before.

PINTA

You've got a CD player if you like music.

I like music a lot.

PINTA

That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him

with when he left.

CREASY

Who's Emilio?

PINTA

My last bodyguard. He drove me to school

in the morning and picked me up in the

afternoon.

CREASY

I'm here for you?

PINTA

In between you can take Mom shopping and

to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr.

Creasy?

CREASY

Creasy.   Just call me Creasy.

PINTA

(big grin)

Creasy...

PINTA

Looks like he approves of you.

LISA

School tomorrow, baby.

PINTA

I like him, Mom.

LISA

You do?

PINTA

He's like a great big bear.

(a secret smile)

'Creasy bear'...

PINTA

There's something about him.

PINTA

I think he's been sick. He's alright

now, but I think he's been very, very

sick.

LISA

Well, think about going to sleep.   Good

night, baby.

PINTA

Just like you, a big old bear.

CUT TO:

CREASY

Now's your chance.

LISA

She likes him.

SAMUEL

Hmm?

LISA

Creasy.   Pinta likes him.

SAMUEL

Pinta loves school. She'd like Count

Dracula is he took her back there.

CUT TO:

PINTA

Where are you from, Creasy?

CREASY

The United States.

PINTA

I know.    But which state?

CREASY

No state in particular.

PINTA

My mom and me are from Houston, Texas.

Have you been there?

CREASY

No.

PINTA

You can drive and talk at the same time,

can't you?

CREASY

(turns left)

No.

PINTA

Why not?

CREASY

I'm looking for potential.

PINTA

Potential?     I don't understand.

CREASY

Places where the road bends, places away

from buildings, places where the traffic

thins out. But you don't have to

understand. I do. So no talking.

PINTA

Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard

quit.

CREASY

Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?

PINTA

Someone gave him more money than we

could.

CREASY

I'm a bargain.

PINTA

Being black, is that a positive or

negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

CREASY

Time will tell.

PINTA

There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City

in the last six days. Four a day. What

do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?

CREASY

Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my

fee or get a larger gun.

PINTA

Beep the horn.

PINTA

Isn't it beautiful?

PINTA

Sister Anna, the headmistress.

(to nun; proudly)

This is Creasy, my bodyguard.

SISTER ANNA

Mr. Creasy.

PINTA

No, Sister, he told me just to call him

Creasy. He's American. From no state in

particular.

SISTER ANNA

You must look after our Pinta. We're so

happy to have her back in school. Run

along now, Pinta.

SISTER ANNA

She's late, Mr. Creasy.

CREASY

Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes.

I -- It won't happen again.

SISTER ANNA

No offense, but I'm sorry that your

profession needs to exist.

CREASY

So am I, Sister.

SISTER ANNA

Do you ever see the hand of God in what

you do?

CREASY

Not for a long time, sister.

SISTER ANNA

The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil,

but overcome evil with good."

CREASY

Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.

CREASY

I'm the sheep that got lost.

CREASY

Here we go again.

SLOPPY COP ONE

Do you speak English, Senor?

CREASY

Yeah.   And Spanish.

SLOPPY COP ONE

You have an identification?

CREASY

It's a temporary license for the gun I'm

carrying. I just went through all of

this at the airport.

RAYBURN

Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?

(listens; laughs)

Yeah?

CUT TO:

CREASY

There's still ink on my fingers from last

week.

CUT TO:

RAYBURN

You got tossed. Don't trust the cops,

especially the Judicials.

(listens; laughs again)

Oh you know that?

PINTA

We're taking a different way home.

CREASY

That's right.

PINTA

I understand.     Smart.

PINTA

Did you like school, Creasy?

CREASY

No.

PINTA

Not at all?

CREASY

No.

PINTA

But why not?

PINTA

Hmmm?

CREASY

It wasn't a school like yours and there

was no Sister Anna.

PINTA

So you were unhappy?

CREASY

Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I

never thought about it.

PINTA

Oh...

PINTA

What happened to...

PINTA

...your hand?

CREASY

No more questions.

CREASY

I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid

to protect you.

CREASY

(exasperated)

And don't start crying.

PINTA

I'm not crying.

CREASY

Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like

questions. I --

CREASY

Shit.

PINTA

You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.

CREASY

Come in.

LISA

Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you

have everything you need.

CREASY

I'm fine.

LISA

Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that

you didn't eat.

CREASY

The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.

LISA

(smiles)

It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if

you have to... Do you mind if I talk to

you for a moment?

LISA

How are you getting along with Pinta?

CREASY

We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a

new toy.

LISA

(smiles)

Yes, she told me.   Do you have children,

Mr. Creasy?

CREASY

No.

LISA

You should know they're tenacious when

they want something. And Pinta wants to

be friends.

CREASY

You're paying me to protect her, not

amuse her. Right?

CREASY

Look. Maybe this isn't going to work.

Maybe you should ask your husband to hire

someone... more sociable.

LISA

No, you're right. You were hired to

protect her, that's enough. I'm

confident you'll do that.

LISA

I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know

that's silly to say.

LISA

It makes it all seem so serious.

CREASY

It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.

LISA

Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with

you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.

PINTA

Give me God what you still have.    Give me

what no one else asks for.

RONSTADT

"I'm going back someday, come what may,

to Blue Bayou..."

LINDA RONSTADT

Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come

true, on Blue Bayou...

RAYBURN

Rayburn...    Creasy! What's wrong?

CREASY

I said, have you ever had a nine

millimeter round that just didn't go off?

INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:

RAYBURN

You mean a misfire?

CREASY

I mean nothing. The hammer came down and

nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

RAYBURN

I've heard of it. Never happened to me

though. Maybe the firing pin's off.

CREASY

Maybe...

RAYBURN

It's like we always used to say: a bullet

always tells the truth. What were you

shooting at?

RAYBURN

(focusing; concerned)

Creasy?

CREASY

Sorry I woke you, Ray.

CREASY

Pinta, do you have a pencil?

PINTA

I go to school, don't I?

CREASY

Please?

CREASY

Sorry.

LISA

The traffic takes some getting used to.

PINTA

Bye, Mom.

LISA

Don't forget your towel.

LISA

She has swimming practice today.    You'll

need to pick her up at the pool.

LISA

I talked to her. She understands.     She

won't bother you anymore.

LISA

(sees him)

Creasy!

(stepping over)

Meet Jordan and Evelyn.

JORDAN

So you're the bodyguard?

(Creasy nods again)

You used to be, what did they used to

call it, a soldier of fortune?

EVELYN

(giggles)

Does he talk?

EVELYN

He's sexy...

JORDAN

You see any danger out there?

(laughs)

The fear's worse than the reality.

JORDAN

I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would

you take a bullet for your employer, for

Samuel?

CREASY

I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.

JORDAN

For Pinta then?

LISA

Jordan!

CREASY

If something happened, my reaction would

be to fight to protect her. I have

skills in that respect. Pinta would

benefit by the fact that... I'm a

soldier.

JORDAN

What kind of an answer is that?

CREASY

The answer is the truth.   The question is

foolish.

LISA

Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.

I promise not to let Evelyn spend too

much.

CREASY

You're fast.

PINTA

Once I get in the water but not starting

off. By the time I catch up, it's too

late.

CREASY

Hey... Pinta...

CREASY

What are you doing?

PINTA

Calling for Emilio's macaw.    I thought I

heard him.

CREASY

Do you think he'll come back?

PINTA

Maybe.    Did you hear him?

CREASY

No.

PINTA

How do you think he got out?

CREASY

(a beat)

Well, I let him go.

PINTA

It's better to be free, right?

CREASY

Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy.

PINTA

I got you to talk, Creasy bear.

RONSTADT

"...I'm so lonesome all the time, since I

left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou."

LISA

I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

PINTA

You're going to miss Mexican Halloween.

The Day of the Dead.

SAMUEL

You enjoy it for us, Pinta.

CREASY

They'll be back in a week.

PINTA

They can stay for two weeks.   I don't

care.

CREASY

The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a

real talent.

MARIA

My pleasure, Creasy.

PINTA

Come on.   Come on.   Bird!

PINTA'S VOICE

CREASY!

CREASY

Pinta!

PINTA

It hurts.

CREASY

Where?

PINTA

(Short)

Everywhere!

CREASY

I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere

else?

PINTA

My ankle.

CREASY

I'm going to get you out, okay?

PINTA

Oh, Creasy...

CREASY

It's okay.    She's just scared.

LISA

You're sure she's alright?

LISA

Okay, good,   you're sure.

(to   Samuel)

He took her   for an X-ray, but it's just a

bruise and   a sprain.

LISA

Thank you, Creasy.      Give her my love.

PINTA

The night you arrived, Mom asked you if

you had a family and you lied, didn't

you?

CREASY

White lie. I didn't have a family. But

I did have two kids. They're adults now.

CREASY

Do you always sleep with him?

PINTA

I'm too old for him.     Don't tell my

friends.

CREASY

I don't talk to them much.     Does he have

a name?

CREASY

I spoke to your mother.     She sends her

love.

CREASY

Some bodyguard I turned out to be.       Good

night, Pinta.

PINTA

Creasy?   Could you play the song?

CREASY

Blue Bayou.   You got it.

PINTA

I think I'll sit in the front.     There's

more room for my foot.

PINTA

He's only allowed to travel in the car on

weekends. Dad says the car will smell

'doggie'.

CREASY

Did you sleep alright?

PINTA

Yes.

CREASY

How's the ankle? Can you put your weight

on it?

PINTA

It's   not too bad. Will it take a long

time   before it's better? Our big swim

meet   is in three weeks. Interschools.

I was   going to swim in the one hundred

meter   freestyle.

CREASY

In a week you should be fine.

PINTA

Doesn't matter. I always finish second.

CREASY

You need to practice.

PINTA

I will.

PINTA

Creasy, what's a concubine?

CREASY

Why do you ask?

PINTA

It was in a book at school.   Concubine.

CREASY

Well, it's a sort of wife.

PINTA

But the Emperor of China had 1000 of

them! How can that be?

CREASY

In the West, it's one wife for one

husband, but different cultures have

different rules.

PINTA

It must be difficult having lots of

wives.

CREASY

You feel sorry for the husband?

PINTA

(in Spanish)

Yeah. Can you imagine my mother

multiplied by a thousand?

PINTA

Creasy, you're smiling.

CREASY

I guess I am.

PINTA

So how come you know so much about those

countries?

CREASY

I had to do my homework on them when I

worked there. Also I enjoy history.

PINTA

What did you do in Asia? Is that where

you met the man with cigarettes?

CREASY

No, that was in Columbia.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CREASY

Bang!

CREASY

No, no, come back.

CREASY

You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you

react. You go. Don't listen for the

sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate

on the sound itself.

PINTA

I don't understand.

CREASY

Don't worry.    You will.

PINTA

Creasy, what happened to your hand?

CREASY

A man asked me questions once.   He smoked

a lot. There was no ashtray.

CREASY

Remember you asked me what state I was

from?

PINTA

Yes.

CREASY

Where you're from isn't so much about

geography; it's about events. Where

you're from is what happened to you.

PINTA

Good things happen, too, Creasy.

(smiles big)

Like meeting me.

CREASY

(after a beat)

I guess that really does make me a hard

case.

PINTA

Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?

CREASY

No.

PINTA

Did you used to?

CREASY

Yeah.   Two or three.

LISA

Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off

Pinta, could you come back to take me to

get my hair done?

LISA

Alright, I'll leave you two to your

history.

CREASY

Don't move.

LISA

Murdering people in the street... You

had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?

CREASY

Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,

there was another one in the passenger

side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.

If I'd started shooting his friends, he

would've had me. And you.

CREASY

A minimum close protection team consists

of four men for high threat targets and

environments. Even in a low threat

situation, you need two guards plus a

security trained driver.

PINTA

(happy to see him)

You're late.

CREASY

I'm sorry.

PINTA

You were never late before, I was

worried.

PINTA

Where's my mother?

CREASY

I dropped her at home.

PINTA

It's no wonder you're late.      Why didn't

she just come with you?

PINTA

Do you think my mother likes you?

CREASY

I think she's afraid of me.      But not the

same way most people are.

PINTA

I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

CREASY

I know you're not.

PINTA

Are you afraid of me?

CREASY

I used to be.     At first.   But not

anymore.

PINTA

Good.

CREASY

The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it.

PINTA

The gunshot holds no fear.

CREASY

You welcome the sound. The sound is what

lets you go. The sound is what frees

you. You are a prisoner in those blocks

until you hear the sound.

PINTA

I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you.

CREASY

There's no such thing as tough.    You're

either trained or untrained.

CUT TO:

PINTA

Hi, Dad.

SAMUEL

I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what

you did for my wife.

LINDA RONSTADT

I'm going back someday, come what may, to

Blue Bayou.

DISSOLVE TO:

PINTA

What's so important in Los Angeles?

CREASY

Your father has business.

PINTA

Why today?    And why'd she have to go with

him?

CREASY

Good luck. I'll be waiting here when

you're done.

PINTA

You're coming with me.

PINTA

Stand near the finish line.

CREASY

Pinta.

CREASY

The blocks.

PINTA

(smiles; knows)

I'm a prisoner in them.    Until the

gunshot sets me free.

SISTER ANNA

Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.

CREASY

(apologetic)

Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.      I

was going to wait in the courtyard,

but...

SISTER ANNA

Today you are her father.

CUT TO:

PINTA

I won, Creasy! I won!

PINTA

My Dad said all your friends were dead.

RAYBURN

All but one. The most important one.

When we were eighteen, we made an

agreement to "take the world" together.

CREASY

Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in

love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said

what happened to the plan?

RAYBURN

I said the plan was right here.

CREASY

I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I

got it.

CREASY

Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone

to bed?

PINTA

Okay, I think now is as good as time as

any.

PINTA

I bought it with my own money.     I saved

it.

PINTA

It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost

causes.

RAYBURN

And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St.

Jude became a Saint in the first place.

PINTA

Yeah, that's right.

CREASY

Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.

RAYBURN

Come on, baby. I feel like a third

wheel. Watch the kid.

PINTA

Could I ask you a question?

CREASY

Could I stop you?

PINTA

You don't drink like you used to.

CREASY

That's not a question.

PINTA

I know because I go in your room and

check the bottles.

CREASY

Still not a question.

PINTA

My mom drinks, too...    Why do people

drink, Creasy?

CREASY

Now that's a question. I don't know

about your Mom. For me, the problem

isn't in the glass. The problem's in

between my ears.

PINTA

You think too much?

CREASY

Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't

think enough.

LISA

He has to go, Samuel.

SAMUEL

What?   Who?

LISA

Creasy.

SAMUEL

Why?    You were so pleased with him.

LISA

Pinta likes him too much.

(a beat)

She thinks of him as a father.

SAMUEL

That's ridiculous.

LISA

It's not.

SAMUEL

I've just been so busy, Lisa.

LISA

He has to go.

SAMUEL

The three month trial ends in a week. I

just won't confirm the position. That

possibility was understood when I hired

him.

SAMUEL

I won't create bad feelings. And another

week won't make a difference.

SAMUEL

It will be a hard break.

LISA

She's young.     She'll get over it.

SAMUEL

I wasn't thinking of Pinta.

SAMUEL

Creasy, how are you?

PINTA

I don't want to play piano!   I want to

swim!

SAMUEL

No discussion, Pinta. Mr. Lozzi is a

famous teacher. If he accepts you, you

will play.

PINTA

Frank.   Frankie.

CREASY

Pinta, we've got to go.   Travel sucks at

this time.

PINTA

Frank.   Frankie.

CREASY

That's strange. Frank was a no-show.

Not like him to miss a ride.

PINTA

(distant)

You should break all my fingers, Creasy,

then tape them back together. I won't be

able to play the piano, but I could still

swim.

CREASY

Don't be a baby. You're tougher than

that.

PINTA

There's no such thing as tough, Creasy.

Just trained and untrained.

CREASY

(smiles)

Then be trained.

PINTA

I'm going to keep people safe someday.

Just like you.

CREASY

Be a swimmer.

PINTA

I could do it. Remember the day   you

wanted the pencil? I know why.    And I

saw that car again. I wrote the   license

number in my notebook. Except I   missed

the last number.

CREASY

You'll have to show me that number when

we get home.

CREASY

Continue to play in the wrong key, like

you're dyslexic.

PINTA

Dyslexic?

CREASY

Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has

a complete block about 'C' Minor. But

remember, "Whoever resists authority will

bring judgement upon themselves." New

Testament, Romans 13.

PINTA

You got that right.

CREASY

You'll be back in the water in twenty-

four hours.

PINTA

For you, Creasy.

CREASY

Remember 'dyslexic.'

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CREASY

(drawing his 9mm)

Run, Pinta, run!

PINTA'S VOICE

CREASY!

CREASY

NOOO...

PINTA

Creasy...

PINTA

Creasy!

CREASY

Pinta...

CREASY

Don't die, Creasy, don't die.

CHIEF

This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an

American citizen, is under arrest for the

murder of two police officers, Hector

Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also

the prime suspect in the kidnapping of

Pinta Martin Ramos.

CUT TO:

LAWYER

When did he say he would call back?

Do not tell them you have a kidnap

policy.

They usually ask for three times the

amount they expect...

TAZINARI

Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari,

commandante of the Judicial anti-

kidnapping division.

JORDAN

We do not need or want police

involvement. I am the negotiator. We

feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta

back without your involvement.

TAZINARI

I have a written order from the Public

Ministry. Two police officers were

killed.

(he holds up the phone)

This is the Attorney General Navarro

Bernal Diaz.

TAZINARI

The law requires an intervention by the

authorities "de officio."

SAMUEL

It's impossible. I cannot afford thirty

million. I will need to borrow the

money.

CUT TO:

SAMUEL

The realities are I do not have access to

this type of money.

CUT TO:

KIDNAPPER

Two and a half million in two different

bags. The bags you can get from Save-On.

Fifteen gallon, black canvas, divide the

money equally.

CUT TO:

SAMUEL

Yes, I will give you interest.

KIDNAPPER

I will instruct you on the exchange over

the next 24 hours.

CUT TO:

CHIEF

The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her

father is Samuel Valencia Ramos.

ROSANNA

A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a

9 year old. The bodyguard's American.

Not only that he's black.

MANZANO

Is that good or bad?

ROSANNA

That's good. Really good. He shot and

killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper

died in the attack. They're saying he's

responsible.

REPORTER ONE

Beside the American in custody, are any

other Americans involved in the

kidnapping?

CHIEF

We're looking into it.

ROSANNA

The two officers who were killed.

Records show they were off duty at the

time.

CHIEF

I'm not sure.     All I know is they died

bravely.

ROSANNA

If they were off duty, why were they in a

patrol car? What exactly were they doing

at the scene of a kidnapping?

ROSANNA

Were they known for their exceptional

good luck?

CHIEF

They were known for their professionalism

and integrity!

COP ONE

No visitors.

COP TWO

Who are you?

RAYBURN

I'm here to see my friend.

COP TWO

Identification.

MANZANO

When I heard it was this hospital I was

so pleased. There's a pastry shop

nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it?

MANZANO

The best pastries in Mexico.

MANZANO (CONT'D)

Miguel Manzano.

RAYBURN

He's not a cop killer.

MANZANO

I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly

adept at killing.

RAYBURN

He was doing his job, protecting the

girl. If police were involved, you

figure it out. I'm here for him.

MANZANO

So am I.

RAYBURN

You hear me, Crease?

RAYBURN (CONT'D)

(whispers)

You got three of the fuckers.   All dead.

CREASY

Pinta...

RAYBURN

Two days gone. They're negotiating a

ransom.

MANZANO

These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

VOICE

You have the money.

JORDAN

Yes.

VOICE

OK,repeat the drop instructions.

JORDAN

The money, 10 million U.S. will be

divided into two 15 gallon black canvas

bags each containing five million which

will be checked at the bank by the K&R

agent. Then driven to the house in an

armored car where it will be transferred

to the delivery car.

VOICE

The car will not be powerful and have no

trunk.

JORDAN

I need a driver to drive Samuel, the

father.

VOICE

No.    Why?

JORDAN

He has a heart condition.     Angina.   He

responds badly to stress.

VOICE

OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle

and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will

drive around the square two times.

Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it

out the window to I.D. the car.

VOICE     (V.O.)

There is a payphone     on the Southeast

corner. The phone      will ring. You will

answer and wait for     instruction.

JORDAN

We need proof of life.

VOICE

Is the father, there?

SAMUEL

Hello.

VOICE

If this girl's life  is as important to

you as it is to me,  do not play with the

process. Family is   everything. I am a

professional. You   keep your word and I

will keep mine.

RAYBURN

What's the deal here?

ROSANNA

I wouldn't gamble leaving him here.

These guys will kill him in a heartbeat

'while trying to stop him from escaping.'

SAMUEL

He said no phones!

TAZINARI

You do your job. I'll do mine.

VOICE (V.O.)

Leave the money in the trunk of the car

with white paper taped to the windshield,

then return to your car and go home. Do

not look back.

VOICE (V.O.)

Remember, I am a professional. If you

keep your word, I will keep mine. If you

do not, then God be with your child.

CREASY

She's dead.   Isn't she?

RAYBURN

It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the

drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got

killed.

VOICE (V.O.)

You betrayed me. You killed my nephew

and took the money.

K&R AGENT

No, not us...No we did not.

VOICE (V.O.)

Remember my words. Family is everything

and do not play with the process.

RAYBURN

She's dead Creasy.

MANZANO

She's dead. They fucked with 'the

process' and his nephew died.

DOCTOR

He suffered gunshot   wounds to the upper

extremity, chest and   abdomen. He has a

collapsed lung which   is stabilized,

injured his spleen,   which we may have to

remove and ruptured   his intestine. He's

on strict bedrest or   there's a good

chance we could lose   him.

NURSE

A strange man. He has much experience of

hospitals.

MANZANO

Did he say so?

NURSE

No.   But a nurse knows.

CUT TO:

MANZANO

Nothing?

MANZANO

Excellent work by the way. Three men

dead. Only ten rounds fired.

MANZANO

If two of the men in my division could

shoot like that, I could get rid of the

other thirty-six.

CREASY

What am I doing here?

MANZANO

Believe it or not, you're safe here. The

Judicial police will kill you. If they

can.

(re: book)

This page?

CREASY

No.

MANZANO

You have a rather checkered past. Mr.

Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages

long.

CREASY

Am I a suspect?

MANZANO

No.   It would be convenient, but no.

CREASY

Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.

Maybe then we'll get somewhere.

MANZANO

All these photos you just saw were of

policemen. Sadly they're protected. La

Hermanidad. The brotherhood.

RAYBURN

(whispers)

Okay?

RAYBURN

How do you feel?

CREASY

Stomach's gone. But... okay.

RAYBURN

I'll get you up to the border. Friend of

mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop

you right at the hospital.

CREASY

Got a thing I gotta do first.

FEMALE VOICE

Creasy...

ROSANNA

A lot of people are looking for you.

CREASY

I guess that makes you the smart one.

ROSANNA

We're interested in the same thing.         I'm

writing a story.

ROSANNA

This might interest you.       I found it

across the street.

ROSANNA

It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The

religion of La Hermanidad. There's a

curse on you.

CREASY

It's a little late.

ROSANNA

What are you going to do?

ROSANNA

I can help. I have a situation Mr.

Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le

Hermanidad which protects both high

ranking Government officials, corrupt

police, and organized crime at a level

that is very difficult for me to touch.

I believe you were a victim of this

organization. You and this story may

help to unmask them.

CREASY

Thank you.

LISA

(softly)

You let them take her.     She loved you and

you let them take her.

LISA

Why are you here?     Why didn't you die?

CREASY

Because...

(shrugs)

I was already dead.

CREASY

I want you   to know something.

(a   beat)

I'm going   to kill them. Anyone who opens

their eyes   at me.

LISA

Creasy...

LISA

Kill them, Creasy.

LISA (CONT'D)

Kill them all.

PINTA'S VOICE

Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where

you're from?

CREASY

Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta.     Like you.

PINTA GHOST

Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but

life is better.

CREASY

(smiles)

Why are you here?

PINTA GHOST

I have to watch you now.

RAYBURN

You'll be Stateside by suppertime.

CREASY

I'm going to need help, Ray.

RAYBURN

Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day

the shape you're in. Unless you stop

bleeding you should have your spleen

removed.

CREASY

Yes or no?

RAYBURN

(after a beat)

I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave

that up. Anything else? It's yours.

RAYBURN

Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.

RAYBURN

Candy store. Every town in Mexico has

one if you know what door to bang on.

CREASY

I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.

RAYBURN

I know it's old fashioned, but it's

reliable. Like us.

CREASY

I need less than standard packing. Can

you knock up a case for fifteen of each?

CREASY

(indicating)

Cut the stock here. The barrel here.

Make sure you file it smooth.

(looks around)

Rocket launchers?

RAYBURN

Different door. Not far from here.

CUT TO:

CREASY

Maybe I can help your situation and you

mine.

ROSANNA

So where do we begin?

CREASY

I need the name and address of the owner

of a Toyota Corolla, license number

ME31704...We didn't get the last digit so

I need the ten possible matches.

ROSANNA

So what do I get in return?

CREASY

Let's see how the relationship develops.

I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.

MANZANO

He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death

before he can do anything.

ROSANNA

He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than

we are.

ROSANNA

Because he's outside. Because he's not

tied to the same system we are.

MANZANO

We did voice analysis of the last five

high profile kidnappings, including the

little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'.

Listen to this.

VOICE

"I used to run through the streets of

Neza because I was scared of being fucked

with. I swore one day I would cross the

street walking. Now I walk."

ROSANNA

He's protected by La Hermanidad.

MANZANO

I know this.    Your point?

ROSANNA

Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is

he could be very valuable to us.

ROSANNA

Then what do you have to lose?

MANZANO

It's a moral issue. On one hand you're

cleaning up the bad guys, but in another

way we are feeding the problem that

produces bad guys.

CREASY

Drive.

JORGE

(incredulous)

Do you know who I am?

CREASY

You are Jorge Ramirez.

CREASY

Drive.

CREASY'S VOICE

Stop here.    Turn off the ignition.

CREASY

Can you hear me?

CREASY

I am going to ask questions. If you

don't answer, fully and truthfully, you

will suffer much more than you have to.

CREASY (CONT'D)

I'm going to cut your fingers off.     One

by one. If I have to.

CREASY

That's to cauterize the stubs.

JORGE

Do you know who I am?

CREASY

Who are you?

JORGE

I am the President of La Hermanidad.

JORGE'S VOICE

No!   No!

CUT TO:

JORGE

Wh- wh- what do you want to know?

CREASY

The Ramos kidnapping.   How did it work?

JORGE

I don't know. We were just given

instructions to take her.

CREASY

Ordered by who?

JORGE

I don't know.

JORGE

(a mile a minute)

I don't know! We work in parts. A    voice

calls in a kidnapping. We deliver   the

target to the guardians. We don't   even

know them. They might transfer to   other

guardians. The negotiators and the

bosses don't even see the target.   They

just make the deal!

CREASY

Who ordered it?

JORGE

The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.

CREASY

Where do I find him?

JORGE

(shrugs; terrified)

I don't know. No one knows.

JORGE

I don't know, I swear.

CREASY

(after a beat)

I believe you.

JORGE

(crying)

I'm professional. I just do my job.

CREASY

Me, too.    Tell me about the guardians.

JORGE

He called me on the cell phone to set a

time and location for the switch.

CREASY

Who's he?

JORGE

The one who transferred Pinta to their

car.

CREASY

Who's he?

JORGE

I don't know, but I know his face.

JORGE

I see him sometimes at the handball court

in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.

CREASY

How do I recognize him.

JORGE

He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of

his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.

CREASY

In the next hour, where do I find your

partner?

JORGE

One-one-three Arco Iris.    Third floor.

GIRL

(nods)

When will I see you again?

CREASY

Her name was Pinta.

CUT TO:

CREASY'S VOICE

Roman's Chapter 13:21. Do not be

overcome by evil, but overcome evil with

good. There is no authority except from

God.

CUT TO:

GUARDIAN TWO

Hola!

CREASY

Tell me about the girl.

GUARDIAN ONE

Who the fuck's that?

CREASY

How does it work?

GUARDIAN TWO

Everything on the cellphone. We wait for

calls. We have no number to call.

CREASY

Who pays you?

GUARDIAN TWO

We have an ATM bank card. We draw out

300 dollars every two weeks.

CREASY

What's the PIN number?

GUARDIAN TWO

The what?

CREASY

The number you use at the bank machine.

GUARDIAN TWO

Four-seven-four-seven.

CREASY

Who killed her? You?

GUARDIAN TWO

No!

CREASY

Don't lie to me.

GUARDIAN TWO

The boss did or his brother.

CREASY

Who's the boss?

GUARDIAN TWO

We don't know! We never see his face!

We have to wait in the other room. He

was screaming to the girl that...

GUARDIAN TWO

...his nephew was killed in the exchange.

And the money was stolen.

CREASY

What money?

GUARDIAN TWO

The ransom money. At the drop. He said

Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken

it. He was crazy.

CREASY

Who's Tazinari?

GUARDIAN TWO

Head of the antikidnapping division.

CREASY

Show me.

FEMALE GUARDIAN

He was screaming about the money and his

dead nephew. He threw the little girl

against the wall.

FEMALE GUARDIAN

She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw

her body in the trunk of the car and

drove away.

CREASY

Who?   Who's they?

FEMALE GUARDIAN

The boss's brother, I recognize his

voice. It's high pitched. We call him

Woody Woodpecker.

CREASY

Now listen to me. If you tell me where

to find the boss. I will let you live.

FEMALE GUARDIAN

Please.    I don't know.

ROSANNA

Rosanna Guerrero.

CREASY'S VOICE

It's Creasy.

ROSANNA

Where are you?

CREASY'S VOICE

Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped

recently? About twelve maybe?

ROSANNA

Last night.    Do you know something?

CREASY'S VOICE

What was her name?

ROSANNA

Camila.   Camila Valencias.

CREASY

Camila.

CREASY

(into phone)

I've got her.

CREASY

I need something. Do you have banking

connections?

ROSANNA

(hesitates, then...)

I have connections.

CREASY

The PIN number is 4-7-4-7.    I need to

know whose account it is.

ROSANNA

Where do I find you?

CREASY

I'll call you tomorrow.

CREASY

What do you know about the cop?

Tazinari. The one who made the ransom

drop with Samuel Ramos?

ROSANNA

He's an old fashioned patrone with the

worst reputation. He's high on my hit

list.

CREASY

Where does he live?

ROSANNA

He lives in a Judicial Compound. He

travels by motorcade. He has better

protection than George Bush. Even more

importantly he is part of La Hermanidad.

His reach is far and wide.

CREASY

Give me the address.

ADJUTANT

Two in one day. And they died very

badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime

suspects in twelve kidnappings in the

last six months.

MANZANO

Whoever did this was methodical,

unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the

photos we showed Creasy?

ADJUTANT

No, I checked. But right   after Sandri

was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found

naked, hysterical in the  street. She

said it was a man fitting  Creasy's

description who shot him.

MANZANO

Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a

very lethal human being.

ADJUTANT

You don't seem very surprised?

MANZANO

What's surprising these days?

MANZANO

Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like

this.

AGENT

(laughs)

Your man's here. Interrogation room two.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MANZANO

Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo

sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in

lemon and orange juice. It's a stew

really.

RAYBURN

(sets it down)

I already ate.

MANZANO

Tell me about your friend Creasy.

RAYBURN

You just said it. He's my friend.

Nothing else to say.

MANZANO

I read the file. You and Creasy have

seen quite a bit together.

RAYBURN

Two tourists who never went home.

MANZANO

You helped him get this job.

RAYBURN

That's what friends do.

MANZANO

Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you,

others will do it as well. Their

facilities are as good as my own, if not

better.

RAYBURN

I can take care of myself.

MANZANO

You and Creasy both. A two man army

according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon

with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you

were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt

down elite Iraqi military commanders.

(laughs)

You two were a married couple.

RAYBURN

The kind that gets divorced, but still

stay friends.

MANZANO

What happened to him?   What happened to

Creasy?

RAYBURN

None of your business. Or mine for that

matter. I got nothing more to say.

MANZANO

This is my jurisdiction. I want these

men as much as Creasy does.

RAYBURN

He'll deliver more justice in a weekend,

than ten years of your courts and

tribunals. So stay out of his way.

MANZANO

I plan to. I'll even help him if I can.

He's going to lead me to the 'The

Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly.

But I'd like to understand him. Give me

that.

RAYBURN

Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to

you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a

number. One more dead.

MANZANO

What was she to Creasy then?

RAYBURN

Light. At the end of a long, dark

tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was

alright to live again.

MANZANO

And they took that away.

RAYBURN

A man can be an artist in anything.

Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if

his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is

death. And he's about to paint his

masterpiece.

RAYBURN

Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive

across the border. So, if you'll do me a

favor and let me the fuck out of here...

MANZANO

Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl

that was kidnapped yesterday.

ROSANNA

And left three more dead men.

MANZANO

When you talked to him, did he look sane?

ROSANNA

No. Not by the rules of polite society

at least.

MANZANO

I think he's... magnificent.

MANZANO

(smiles)

You only fuck me to get information.

ROSANNA

(smiles back)

You only give information so you can fuck

me.

MANZANO

A beautiful circle.

ROSANNA

Let's put Creasy to press. There's a

vigilante cleaning up Mexico. An

unstoppable hero.

ROSANNA

And as long as we're talking information,

there's something else as well.

MANZANO

(as he takes card)

I should start going for your tits first.

CREASY

I'm not here to hurt you. I need to

borrow your house and your car. Are you

the proud owners of the Coupe deVille?

CREASY

If you promise to speak softly and not to

shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.

CREASY

Did you know you have a dishonest

policeman living in your neighborhood?

OLD MAN

I know of you. You're the American. The

bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.

OLD MAN

In the church, they say to forgive.

CREASY

Forgiveness is between them and God.

It's my job to arrange the meeting.

CREASY

Do you have an old blanket you don't care

about? I don't want to burn that wall.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CREASY

You know where you are?

CREASY

Under the bridge. Where the deal went

south. Now why don't you tell me what

went down?

TAZINARI

Do you know who I am? I am the

commandante of the Judicial anti-

kidnapping division.

CREASY

And one of the founding members of La

Hermanidad.

TAZINARI

Correct!

CUT TO:

CREASY

That's not my dick. That's the barrel of

your own gun. Shoved up your own ass.

CREASY (CONT'D)

.44 Magnum. Now, how's your hearing?

TAZINARI

Please, don't...

CREASY

It's all up to you, commandante.    Tell me

about you and 'The Dreamer'.

TAZINARI

I don't know him. I saw the opportunity

and got lucky.

CREASY

Lucky how?

TAZINARI

That he used policemen. That you killed

them, it made it a police matter. The

Ramos family couldn't refuse our

involvement.

CREASY

And?

TAZINARI

And I had my men ready.

CREASY

You stole the drop.

CREASY (CONT'D)

You done it before?

TAZINARI

Yes.   Many times.

CREASY

O.K.   So tell me more.

TAZINARI

There was no ten million dollars.

CREASY

The ransom was ten.

TAZINARI

Two and a half. That's how much there

was.

CREASY

Don't lie to me!

TAZINARI

Two and a half! The rest was paper!

Strips of paper!

CREASY

Maybe your men stole from you.

TAZINARI

No. Whoever took the rest took it before

the exchange.

CREASY

Who gave the bags to Ramos?

TAZINARI

His lawyer.   Jordan Kalfus.

CUT TO:

TAZINARI

That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry

for the girl. But it was business! I'm

a professional.

CREASY

That's what everybody keeps saying.

CUT TO:

CREASY

Another favor... get me banking info on

Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or

withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the

same on Samuel Ramos.

ROSANNA

How do I contact you?   We still don't

have the ATM info.

CREASY

You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a

tape recording that I am sure will

interest you.

CREASY

(to Samuel)

I'm going to talk to your wife. If you

move or say one word, I'll kill you.

CREASY

I'm going to tell you a story. Your

lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him

talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million

into his U.S. bank account. Colonel

Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He

hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5

million. If my arithmetic is correct it

means $5 million remains.

CREASY

Your husband magically had five million

deposited in a U.S. bank account last

Friday.

CREASY

They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.

LISA

Planned what?

CREASY

An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for

Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm

sure he thought she'd sit there for three

days eating pizza and watching TV. It

didn't work out that way. Everything got

fucked up when I killed the cops and

Tazinari saw an opportunity.

CREASY

On the surface it was low risk and high

return. This was the third autosequestra

Jordan had organized for clients. The

other two succeeded.

SAMUEL

Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain

and weakness only fueled your anger and

determination. I wasn't sure about

whether to go through with it or not.

Then I woke up one day and it was done.

(beat)

Jordan was supposed to take care of it.

CREASY

A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells

the truth. And the truth will set you

free.

CREASY

In many ways I think this bullet should

be shared between you and Lisa.

PINTA'S VOICE

From the backseat I can see   Creasy's eyes

in the mirror. He watches    and thinks.

He never smiles. I wish I    was back in

the front seat with him. I    wish he would

smile.

CREASY

Hola...

ROSANNA'S VOICE

Creasy.

CUT TO:

ROSANNA

I traced the PIN. I have an address for

you. But I need to see you.

CREASY

I show, you give me the information?

ROSANNA

Deal.

CREASY

Where?

TECHNICIAN

(to Manzano)

We got the whole place wiretapped. But

no males that sound anything like 'The

Dreamer'.

MANZANO

He'll show.

ROSANNA

Who's that?

MANZANO

He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got

into the house on the pretext of giving

cholera shots. We had to inject the

whole Barrio. We bugged the house and

stole the picture of him. Manzano looks

at Rosanna. Now's the time to really

pressure him. Lets publish his picture

in tomorrow's edition.

ROSANNA

So how are going to recipricate?

CUT TO:

CUT TO

CREASY

I'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero.

OWNER

This way.

MANZANO

(holds up paper)

Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's

what the papers have named you.

CREASY

It's what you and Rosanna named me.

Right?

MANZANO

Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens

from now on does so with my permission.

(smiles)

Really. You won't find a better carne

asada in all of Mexico.

MANZANO

(laughs at himself)

The last few days may represent the best

police work of my life.

CREASY

What do you want?

MANZANO

The same thing as you. Except, my reach

isn't as long as yours. My father was a

policemen, did you know that?

CREASY

I don't know shit about you.

MANZANO

He was one of the original founders of

'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it

represented good not evil.

MANZANO

He was murdered. And now here I am.

Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by

bureaucracy and corruption. The

organization that he began now protects

criminals at the highest level where I

would need a Presidential finding in

order to expose it...or you.

MANZANO

My family lives in Miami.   Because of the

death threats.

CREASY

It's not worth it. Be with them instead.

MANZANO

It galls me to watch you. You can do as

much in days as I can in years. Men like

the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of

everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.

CREASY

Are you going to arrest me or talk me to

death?

MANZANO

My country needs justice. Proper

justice. Gunning men down in the street

only feeds the violence. They need to

be brought to trial. Dealt with

properly.

Then people will respect the law. When

they see it works.

CREASY

So you are going to talk me to death.

MANZANO

You walk out and deal justice. You're

what I wish I could be.

(another laugh, then a beat)

The policemen who kills you, his family

will have all they want.

CREASY

Then I hope the one who gets me has got

lots of kids. What do you want?

MANZANO

I want to arrest you for murder! I want

to shake your hand and reload your gun!

I want to kill my pride and give you my

blessing.

CREASY

My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys

were up to something. Are you two

fucking?

MANZANO

No, but I have to admit I thought about

it.

CREASY

Liar. Just tell me who the bank card

belongs to. Name and address.

MANZANO

You have no interest in making things

easy, do you?

CREASY

I'm not... easy.

MANZANO

Percodan.   I imagine you need handfuls by

now.

MANZANO

Account belongs to a woman we think is

The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas,

who is 8 months pregnant.

MANZANO

The plan is the girlfriend will lead you

to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll

arrest him. Agreed?

MANZANO

Creasy...

(Creasy turns)

I'd have liked to have known you under

different circumstances.

CREASY

Off the top of my head, I don't know what

they could've been.

FADE TO BLACK.

CREASY'S VOICE

Romans chapter 13:4 - therefore whoever

resists authority will bring judgment on

themselves. Now it is time to awake out

of sleep for our salvation is nearer than

we first believed.

CUT TO:

VOICE

He's inside.    What should we do?

MANZANO

(keys mic)

Do nothing.

CUT TO:

CREASY

Reina Rosas.

REINA

Si.

CREASY

How do you contact 'the Boss'?

REINA

We page him and he calls back on this

cell phone.

CREASY

What is his name?

REINA

Daniel.

CREASY

Daniel what?

REINA

Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

CREASY

So you're married to him? And this looks

remarkably like his brother.

CREASY

What is his name?

REINA

Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.

TECHNICIAN

What do we do?

MANZANO (V.O.)

Do nothing. Prepare yourself for an

incoming call.

CREASY

Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I

want to negotiate.

DANIEL

Mr. Creasy.     What do you want?

CREASY

I want you.

DANIEL

How much do you want?

CREASY

It's non-negotiable.

DANIEL

Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?

CREASY

I told you, non-negotiable.

CUT TO:

MANZANO

Damn.

CUT TO:

CREASY

Yeah.

DANIEL

The most important thing in life is

family. And there you are. You have my

family. What do you want?

CREASY

I want you.

DANIEL

This is not possible. But in that house

I have money. If I tell you where --

CREASY

(interrupts)

Your brother wants to talk to you.

AURILLIO

Daniel?

CREASY

Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take

your family apart piece by piece.

REINA

Under the sink. We have money under the

sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but

good.

CREASY

Yeah.

(silence)

Yes.

DANIEL

Listen!    I will give you a life for a

life.

CREASY

What do you mean?

DANIEL

Her life for your life.

CREASY

Whose life?

DANIEL

The girl's.    Pinta's.

CREASY

You're a liar. Pinta's dead.

DANIEL

I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth

nothing. She is alive.

CREASY

I want proof of life.     What did she call

her bear?

DANIEL

Creasy.   She calls the bear 'Creasy

Bear.'

CREASY

Okay.   Where?

TEAM LEADER

We received enough of a signal to at

least put him in the Zona Colonia. Shit

not enough time. He hung up.

CREASY

Lisa, don't hang up on me.     Pinta is

alive.

LISA

(silence)

I don't believe you.

CREASY

I want you to get into your car now and

meet me on the south end of the

footbridge between Reforma and the

freeway junction. In 45 minutes.

LISA

You're lying.     I don't believe you.

CREASY

Then don't come.

LISA

Creasy... Wait.

CREASY

Stay here. If you do something stupid,

we won't get her back.

CREASY

Pinta.   Pinta.

PINTA

I love you, Creasy... And you love me,

right?

MANZANO

I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.

MANZANO

All units. Commence the operation.

Repeat. Commence.

MANZANO

Creasy?   Creasy?

MANZANO

Goddamn you.

MANZANO

(keys mic)

Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.

CREASY'S VOICE

Ezekiel 25:17. Blessed is he  who in the

name of charity and good will shepherds

the weak through the valley of darkness

for he is truly his brother's keeper and

the finder of lost children.
