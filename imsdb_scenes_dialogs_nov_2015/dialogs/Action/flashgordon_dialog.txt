FLASH GORDON

Written by

Lorenzo Semple Jr.

FLASH

What was that, fellas?

2.

PILOT

Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing

SERIOUS

CO-PILOT

But nothing you'd want to toss a

third-down pass through either --

(Grinning back at

FLASH)

Can I have an autograph for my kid,

Mr. Gordon?

FLASH

Sure -- my pleasure.

PILOT

Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see

what they've got.

FLASH

I sure hope we don't have to turn

back. I mean this is first day of

training camp, I wouldn't want to be

LATE --

PILOT

Seat-belt time.

FLASH

Maybe it'd be smoother if you went

HIGHER --

DALE

Will you SHUT UP?

(as FLASH's head

SWIVELS)

Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have

their hands full -- just let 'em

drive.

3.

FLASH

When you're nervous, it can help to

chew on something

DALE

Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough

to take candy from a stranger?

FLASH

I'm not a stranger exactly -- You

know my name.

DALE

Who doesn't. Number one draft pick,

cover of PEOPLE mag -- what'd the

GIANTS sign you for, eighty-nine

million? Big deal!

FLASH

Of course.

DALE

God, I hate flying -- I'm Dale Arden

it's crazy of me to hate flying --

I'm a travel agent, you see? -- I've

just been checking out a little hotel

in Vermont -- can I still have that

candy bar?

(and in the same breath)

Are we going backward?

FLASH

Backwards?

DALE (GASP)

Holy cow! Look at the clouds!

TV NEWSMAN

The extraordinary weather disturbances

reported from Africa this morning

are now crossing the Atlantic, and

are expected to reach the East Coast

of the United States by noon.

According to scientists at NASA, the

Earth is being struck by an immense

stream of cosmic energy, apparently

the result of some catastrophic

stellar accident beyond the reaches

OF --

ZARKOV

Fools! Can't you understand? This

is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An

attack planned by a MIND! This is

ATTACK!

MUNSON

Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from

the last balloon!

5.

ZARKOV

I predicted it, didn't I?

MUNSON

Yes, sir -- you sure did. And this

funny sun too ---

ZARKOV

Ozone layer starting to crack up.

By tonight Carbon dioxide will be

combining with free nitrogen to form --

(breaks off, crumpling

THE SHEET)

Well, this is it.

MUNSON

Sir, the President is on the TV behind

YOU --

ZARKOV

What the hell do I care? I tried to

warn him -- he called me mad, like

all the others.

ZARKOV (CONT'D)

Time for us to go, Munson. Get your

toothbrush and whatever.

MUNSON

Go where?

ZARKOV

Up. Up and at him.

MUNSON

You're crazy!

ZARKOV

I can't handle the capsule alone get

your toothbrush.

6.

PILOT

What's ,e word from Westchester

Approach, Bill?

CO-PILOT

Zip. All chanels dead.

(Reacting to the panel)

Say, get a load of the VOR's....

PILOT

On the left, about six o'clock

high......

PILOT (CONT'D)

Hold on tight, let's put baby down

right here......

DALE

Can you fly it?

FLASH

I can fly all right -- I've had a

couple of lessons! -- just don't if

I can land!

(MORE)

7.

FLASH (CONT'D)

(FIGHTING CONTROLS)

Grab that other wheel! Help me pull

her up!

DALE

Oh boy! Ever hear about the man who

fell ninety stories from a window

and didn't break a bone?

FLASH

No but I'd sure like to! How'd The

man fall ninety stories didn't break

a bone?

DALE

The window was ninety-one stories

up!

(FLASH)

FLASH

Brace yourself I'm aiming at that

field up ahead!

(ZARKOV'S VOICE)

ZARKOV'S VOICE

I see you, Munson! Come out or I

shoot!

8.

MUNSON

So what's it matter if I'm shot or

go up in that thing? I'm a goner

either way, right?

ZARKOV

Of course -- I admit that! But this

way you'll be giving your life for a

chance of saving Earth! Haven't you

any spirit at all??

MUNSON

Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all

right about you. Have a nice trip.

ZARKOV

I tell you I can't take it off alone!

If you won't come, who will I find?

9.

FLASH

Dale! Are you all right?

DALE

I'm terrific.

(WEAK SMILE)

Flash Gordon, you have just made me

a Giant fan for life.

FLASH

Come on -- let's get out before she

blows!

FLASH

Hello. i'm Flash Gordon, this is

Miss Dale Arden --

ZARKOV

(MEANS IT)

Delighted to see you.

FLASH

This crazy storm knocked us down

could we use a phone?

ZARKOV

Certainly. Just follow me -- up those

stairs.

FLASH

Some weather huh?

ZARKOV

It will get worse.

DALE

You're Dr. Hans Zarkov!

ZARKOV

How did you know?

10.

DALE

I saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you

left NASA, remember? It said you

were utterly ---

ZARKOV

Insane? Off my rocker?

DALE

I forget what it said:

(TURNING HASTILY)

Flash, let's find some other phone,

okay? I'm sure Dr. Zarkov is very

busy.......

FLASH

Well, all right -- but it seems to

me we ought to --

ZARKOV

Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead

of me -- quick! --

(as they gape at him,

FROZEN)

Quick I said: We haven't much time --

Earth is being attacked! -- there's

only one slim chance of saving it!

FLASH

Mister, you are insane!

ZARKOV

Up the stairs -- RUN!

FLASH

Go with the flow -- wait for a chance!

11.

ZARKOV

I need your help to take off! Get

in or I shot you dead!

FLASH

Take off for where?

ZARKOV

God only knows -- whatever black

corner of space this is coming from --

wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge

into the devil's heart and destroy

him! We'll die ourselves, of course,

but our names will be honored till

the end of time!

DALE

Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze

tours -- never.

ZARKOV

Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal!

DALE

Flash! Sack him!

12.

ZARKOV,

Friendship...Built this to send to

them in...Friendship...The end

now...End of the world....Unless we

(every sound an effort

NOW)

Unless...We...Three...Can...

13.

RED MARS

WE HEAR:

MING (O.S.)

They survived our Black Hole --

14.

KLYTUS (O.S.)

Hail Ming! Shall I drown them in

the Sea of Fire?

MING (O.S.)

Later, Klytus -- I think we will

look at them first.

15.

ZARKOV

By God, we did it! We made it!

FLASH

Made it where, Doctor?

ZARKOV

I don't know.

DALE

Don't. Suddenly I like it in here

just fine --

FLASH

Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon --

can you understand me?

(SILENCE)

We're from EARTH -- we come as

friends.

ZARKOV

(URGENT)

Extend your hand! That's the gesture

of friendship known everywhere!

FLASH

Hi!

LEADER

You are prisoners. I will take you

now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of

the universe!

ARMORED MEN

(CHORUS)

Hail, Ming!

16.

FLASH

Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll

call my own play.

DALE

Just do what I'm doing. Flash --

FLASH

What are you doing?

DALE

Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked

us to Disneyland.

(ARMORED MEN)

ARMORED MEN

Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without

Mercy!

ZARKOV)

17.

ZARKOV

Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and

out the other side -- to this. Who

said Hans Zarkov was mad?

DALE

You're mad.

FLASH

You got us into this -- HOW DO WE

GET OUT?

ZARKOV

Get out? Why? We're being taken to

Ming -- getting at him is our only

hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!

FLASH

Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you

what it feels like to be clipped by

a New York Giant --

DALE

Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!

MING

Step forward, Soldier.

MING (CONT'D)

Are you loyal to Ming? Would you

die for him?

ARMORED MAN

Gladly!

MING

Fall on your sword.

18.

ZARKOV

You inhuman fiend!

MING

Of course I'm "inhuman"! -- that's a

compliment!

(Dropping his voice)

Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering

if you are alone in the universe --

beaming you plaintive messages into

to the void for anything that might

hear you -- even hurling your bodies

out into it -- and all without the

faintest inkling of who or what is

out here. If you had known anything --

anything at all about the true nature

of the universe, you would have hidden

from it, in terror!

DALE

Watch it, fella -- you came with me!

MING

You know who Ming is now -- who are

you and why do you come to Mongo?

19.

FLASH

I'm Flash Gordon of the New York

Giants this is Dale Arden -- Dr.Zarkov

hijacked us in an effort to save

EARTH.

KLYTUS

Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet

you are in the process of

obliterating.

ZARKOV

(pouncing on that)

In the process? You mean Earth still

exists?

MING

For the moment -- not for much longer.

FLASH

But why? What in hell have we ever

done to hurt you?

MING

You exist -- and yet you pay no homage

to Ming! What greater crime can be

committed?

VOICES

Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without

Mercy!

MING

Come closer, Dale Arden -- let me

see you.

KLYTUS

This woman will amuse you.

20.

ZARKOV

(INTERESTED)

Klytus can see the future, eh?

MING

He can foresee it -- but for a few

moments only. It gives him a unique

gift for survival, -- and treachery.

ZARKOV

Extraordinary. I'd like to study

his beta factors -- I wager I could

extend them with a course of

telekinetic exercise.

(peering at KLYTUS)

Tell me -- when you use this fit

does your temporal lobe prickle?

Here?

MING

Chain this one up. Preserve him for

further examination.

LEADER

Hail, Ming!

FLASH

Oh no you don't! We came together

and we're STAYING together!

MING

That one is useless to us. Remove

him and kill him.

DALE

You dirty old bastard can kill me

too!

21.

AURA

Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him

to me!

MING

(EYEBROWS UP)

What would your Prince Barin say?

AURA

I can handle Barin.

MING

Really, Aura -- your appetites are

too monstrous -- even for our family.

This could cause great trouble with

Barin -- I must forbid it.

WHISPERS AGAIN:

AURA

But you adore me, Father -- you ca

refuse me nothing . Yes?

WIDER SHOT

MING

Take the Earth-woman to our quarters!

Bathe and annoint her for our

pleasure!

DALE

My God -- and I thought that book

was another rip-off-

FLASH

Watch out! Behind you!

QUICK ANGLES

22.

DALE

(low and tremulous)

What's the play, Flash?

FLASH

I can't -- I just can't --

DALE

Can't what?

FLASH

Clobber a woman, Dale --

DALE

(OUTBURST)

You damn fool, those aren't women

they're murderous AMAZON DYKES!

DALE (CONT'D)

Help!!

23.

(DALE)

DALE

Flash!!

KLYTUS

She betrays you! She'll take him to

Aboria!

MING

So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon

for me -- I don't care.

KLYTUS

Don't be too sure!

24.

MING

I haven't taken a wife in centuries.

I could bring myself to marry this

Dale Arden --

(A BEAT)

What do you see in her future, Klytus?

AURA

Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle

after we hit the water -- I'll lead

you!

FLASH

Hit what water?

AURA

Catch your breath -- then I'll take

you up and find you a disguise.

25.

FLASH

You're saving my life. How can I

Thank you?

AURA

I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria -

we'll find a way.

FLASH

Let's get one thing straight -- I've

got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov

too -- rescue them and try to save

Earth too.

AURA

Do you realize how foolish you are

to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?

FLASH

I'm no good at lying.

AURA

You're funny -- are all Eathlings

like you, Flash Gordon?

PLASH

I guess I'm about average.

FLASH (O.S.)

What's that?

AURA (O.S.)

The plasma core. It's e source of

the energy-beam my father ia aiming

at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is

merciless and all-powerful!

26.

AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they

had their own water Kingdom, the

fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to

rebel. They will suffer for it here

forever.

(AURA)

AURA

You can't reach him. If a soldier

spots you, it's instant death! --

Come!

ZARKOV

Incredible - the very core of this

planet, is it not?

SOLDIER

We are but soldiers. We do not know.

MING'S VOICE

You guess well, Dr. Zarkov!

27.

MING

I am forcing this plasma through the

successive nuclear phases of a star -

building it toward the apocalyptic

moment that will end Earth's pathetic

history in one flash of fire.

ZARKOV

Devil! Why don't you turn this science

to peaceful use? The name Ming would

be blessed instead of cursed.

MING

Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers --

we wish to show him wonders.

EVERYONE

Hail! Ming! Hail, Great one Without

Mercy!

FLASH

Listen, where's he got Dale?

AURA

Forget Dale Arden!

FLASH

I can't! I mean I hardly know her,

BUT --

AURA

Forget her, Flash Gordon: I saw a

look in my father's eye -- I think

he intends to marry her.

FLASH

What?? Marry her? What are you

talking about??

28.

AURA

Oh you ask so many questions.

(SEDUCTIVE)

I'm taking you to people who'll help

you. Trust me!

FLASH

Can I honestly?

AURA

Trust me!

AURA (CONT'D)

Here we are.

FLASH

Here we are where?

AURA

I've dressed you as a Royal Pilot,

First Class. We'll slip into my

personal car and you'll fly it.

AURA

FLASH

Those are ROCKET SHIPS in there! I

can't fly a damn rocket ship!

AURA

(soft, teasing)

Learn from me -- I'll teach you so

much!

29.

ZARKOV

Earth!

MING

Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it

will be, when my plasma reaches full

force.....

MING (CONT'D)

And as it will be in yet another

time, long after you have died. Earth

reborn! A pleasant image, no?

ZARKOV

But that's impossible! Even your

perverted genius can't create new

life!

MING

Of course I can create life. There's

nothing easier. It only requires

myself and one woman.

ZARKOV

(SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING)

Dale Arden.....

MING

Who else? As in that childish myth

of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it?

I will breed with her and repopulate

the Earth in my own image. I've

already done it on over a thousand

planets.

30.

MING (CONT'D)

The magic blades are not for your

kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other

will only be withdrawn by my rightful

heir. Pull on them with all your

MIGHT:

ZARKOV

Monster!

MING

Return him to the dungeon.

HEDONIA

Drink this.

DALE

What is it -- some rotten drug?

HEDONIA

It has no name. But many brave men

died to bring it across space from

Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It

will make your hours with Ming more

agreeable.

31.

HEDONIA (CONT'D)

We are of different race, Dale Arden

but we all are women here. I know

your fears. Believe me, it will be

better if you drink it...

DALE

Flash! Where are you??

DALE (CONT'D)

Say, this stuff isn't bad at all.

(AURA)

AURA

Frigia -- eleventh of the moons of

Mongo. It's inhabited by the Bear

Men who eat their own young...

AURA (CONT'D)

Now pull up -- go starboard around

that next moon rising -- Ardentia.

32.

FLASH

Some lucky people live on that one

too?

AURA

Of course - the Sand Men. Every

Moon is a kingdom -- seperate and

hostile to all the others. They

have nothing in common but Ming's

rule -- and their hatred of him.

FLASH

Why don't they team up and fight

him?

AURA

Fight Ming the Merciless?

(LAUGHS)

You saw what happened to the Lizard

Men.

FEATURE FLASH

FLASH

Sue -- but that wasn't a team effort.

AURA

I don't know these words what's a

"team"?

AURA (CONT'D)

Telekinetic Thought Transfer.

(setting its dials)

I'm going to get together with Prince

Barin in Arboria and tell him I'm

arriving. He's the one who'll help

you.

FLASH

Why?

33.

AURA

Because he does anything I ask. He

loves me.

FLASH

You can really transfer your thoughts

with that? Like I could get in touch

with Dale?

AURA

If I showed you how.

(TEASING)

But I'm not going to.

FLASH

Please.

AURA

What are you doing?

AURA

Are you mad> We're diving straight

at Ardentia!

FLASH

That's right, Princess  and we're

not pulling out until you put that

gadget over my head and tune me in

to Dale Arden!

34.

HEDONIA

Rub this on your body. It gives

Ming pleasure.

FLASH'S VOICE

Dale, it's me -- Flash! Am I with

you?

CU DALE

HEDONIA

What's the matter?

DALE

I'm dreaming.

(FLASH'S VOICE)

CU FLASH

FLASH'S VOICE

No, Dale -- you're not dreaming I'm

Flash -- I'm with you and you are

with me!

FLASH'S VOICE

Are you receiving my thoughts?

DALE'S VOICE

I'm receiving something --

35.

FLASH' S VOICE

(EXCITEDLY)

I read you, Dale -- I'm getting you

too! Think of me -- hard!

DALE'S VOICE

Where are you Flash?

FLASH'S VOICE

Speeding for the Kingdom of Arboria

to get help! I'm in a spacecraft

with Aura, Ming's daughter!

DALE'S VOICE

What? That bitch? Don't trust her!

She's after you!

FLASH'S VOICE

Listen, she means nothing to me --

not a darn thing. Where are you,

Dale?

DALE'S VOICE

Naked in a bathtub.

FLASH'S VOICE

(CHOKED)

Oh God -- if I could only see you,

Dale. If I could touch you -- what

are you in a tub for?

DALE'S VOICE

I'm being fixed up for Ming.

FLASH' S VOICE

No! Where's Dr. Zarkov?

DALE'S VOICE

Chained in a dungeon, I think.

What'll I do, Flash?

FLASH' S VOICE

Fake 'em out!

36.

DALE'S VOICE

How?

FLASH'S VOICE

Just fake 'em out, Dale -- girls

know how. But don't go too far. I

mean get to Zarkov and release him,

I'll have help by then -- I'll find

you. Can you do all that?

DALE'S VOICE

Sounds like fourth down and about

ninety yards to go, but I'll try.

FLASH'S VOICE

Dale, you're some girl -- God, you

really are.

(PAUSE)

Do you get what I'm thinking now?

DALE'S VOICE

(SUPER-SENSUOUS)

Oh yes.

FLASH' S VOICE

Dale, we're gonna get out of this

jam -- I swear we will -- I'll find

you, and when I do we'll -----

(AURA)

AURA

Enough!

AURA (CONT'D)

There's Arboria!

37.

(FLASH)

FLASH

Sorry. I guess landings aren't my

thing.

FLASH

Where's Robin Hood?

AURA

Who?

FLASH

It doesn't matter. How do we get

down.

AURA

Follow me.

SERVING GIRL

He is coming to see you now. Are you

ready?

38.

DALE

(easy, smiling)

Very.

SERVING GIRL

Do you need any more of this?

DALE

No, thanks. Just turn down the light

a bit, would you? I'm shy.

(GUARD)

GUARD

Serving Girl - what business have

you in this dungeon?

39.

FLASH

Listen -- are you sure this Barin

will help me?

AURA

Ssssh...... Trust me!

FLASH

It's amazing -- I dreamed of this

tree-house when I was a kid --

AURA

It's Barin's hunt! Watch!

40.

TREE MAN

Barin got him!

ALL THREE MEN

Hail, Ming!

FLASH

These are the guys who are gonna help

me?

AURA

It means nothing. They only shout

that because it's treason not to.

They hate Ming.

BARIN

I scent a Tiger Man near the lodge!

Form battle lines above and below!

41.

FLASH

I know just how he feels -- we played

the Pittsburgh Steelers last year.

TREE MAN (O.S.)

Prince Barin! We have him!

BARIN

Not him! Bring him back for sport:

(AURA)

AURA

Go inside -- let me talk to Barin

first.

(as FLASH hesitates)

Foolish Earthling - trust me!

BARIN

Aura!

42.

AURA

It's so long since I've been with

you, Barin -- I couldn't stand it.

Please don't be too angry at me for

coming.

BARIN

Angry at you?

BARIN

You'll stay the night?

AURA

I've dreamed of it!

BARIN

Get me a sword --

(turning to AURA)

This is the fiercest Tiger Man we

have ever hunted. I'm going to kill

him now -- and dedicate his blood to

you, my beloved.

AURA

(DELIGHTED)

But that's treason! Blood can be

dedicated to Ming alone!

BARIN

I know you, Aura -- the more a man

risks, the greater your passion. If

I knew a greater risk, I'd take it.

AURA

Flash Gordon -- come out!

43.

FLASH

I'm from Earth, Prince Barin. My

friends and I were Ming's prisoners.

She kindly brought me here to enlist

your help.

BARIN

What in hell? My help?

AURA

Hide him from my father -- don't let

him wander -- keep him for me!

FLASH

Keep me for.....????

(STUNNED)

Oh, my god. I trusted you.

AURA

You still must -- I'm playing a game!

CU BARIN

BARIN

What? What are you saying?

WAY:

AURA

He's a mere toy to me, my love --

when I'm tired of it we'll kill him!

AURA (CONT'D)

It's the risk I ask, Barin hide him

for me in Arboria.

BARIN

I'll hide him, all right -- under

six feet of Arborian dirt!

FLASH

I'm not your enemy, Prince Barin. we

share a hatred of Ming

44.

AURA

Are you so afraid of my Earthling,

Barin; Won't you even give him a

chance?

BARIN

Snake keeper! Rouse your beast!

BARIN (CONT'D)

Who dares the beast?

BARIN

I did him a mercy. This venom brings

death only after long tortured

madness. Your turn, Earthling.

CU FLASH

45.

FLASH

I think I'll pass on this one.

INCLUDE BARIN

BARIN

There are six openings to the serpent.

Five are safe -- the sixth is death.

Choose one -- or take your end from

my sword here and now.

FLASH

FLASH

Would you give Dale a message from

me? Tell her I'm sorry how things

have panned out -- I Loved her.

AURA

I'll do that.

FLASH

What the hell? Forget it. Sending

that message by you is like sending

a lettuce-leaf by a rabbit.

FLASH (CONT'D)

Whew! -- Your turn, Prince Barin.

AURA

If your love for me is great enough,

Barin, surely it will protect you

from the serpent -- no?

46.

BARIN

Go again.

FLASH

What are you waiting for?

BARIN

Fooled you, didn't I?

AURA

It's an even chance now, Flash Gordon --

that's better than Daddy would have

given you --

FLASH

Boy. You oughta be handled with a

forked stick yourself.

BARIN

If I were you, I'd choose the sword --

47.

FEATURE BARIN

BARIN (CONT'D)

A mere toy of yours, eh?

AURA

(TAUNTING)

Maybe I was wrong -- surely the Prince

of Arboria wouldn't be beaten by a

toy.

BARIN

The hunt's on, my Tree Men!

TREE MEN

To the hunt with Barin!

TIGER MAN

Thank you for freeing me.

48.

FLASH

You can speak?

TIGER MAN

For all the good it does me.

FLASH

Have we a chance, Tiger Man?

TIGER MAN

Only if we climb -- out of the green

light -- to the sky -- Prince Barin's

Tree Men can't follow us up there!

FLASH

What do you mean?

TIGER MAN

Ming's Law -- outside his own kingdom,

every hunter becomes the hunted!

FLASH

Damn. End of the line.

FLASH

49.

FLASH (CONT'D)

How far will this take us?

TIGER MAN

I don't know --no man has ever been

above the green.

TREE MAN

The sight -- call came from the left!

BARIN

Up and across we'll cut them off!

TIGER MAN

What is that color above?

FLASH

Blue. We call is blue.

50.

TREE MAN LEADER

You haven't a chance! Throw down

your weapon!

FLASH

Which way to the border:

TIGER MAN

Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean

to the west.

51.

BARIN

I saved you because your death must

be mine.

FLASH

What's the point of all this killing?

Why don't we team up and overthrow

Ming?

AURA'S VOICE

Princess Aura returns to Mingo City

The passage through the force-field

opens at her approach --

PROVOCATIVE TONE:

AURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Daddy darling -- am I with you? Are

you getting me?

DALE

Will it fly?

ZARKOV

My God -- your hands! Your hands

ZARKOV

Not gone -- Just invisible. See?

DALE

Does it hurt?

ZARKOV

Not a bit. I believe Mongo's

gravitational. field must have

reversed the polarity of my generator

so that --

Neat trick. I wonder if it's

controllable?

send out the Imperial Fleet to bring

them back?

MING

We'll let Vultan tame her first --

I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after

Sire, it is not for me to tell Great,

Ho! -- Barin! - I knew my Hawkmen

would catch you one of these days.

SARIN

Be careful how you address me, Vultan.

I am Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.

VULTAN

Not in my Kingdom -- here you're

just a stray animal to be killed for

our sport!

BARIN

Will you do that, Vultan?

VULTAN

What would you do if you'd caught me

in Arboria?

BARIN

Yes -- I would hunt you down and

kill you without mercy.

No. What have you to say to Vultan,

We're all Ming's prisoners. I say

let's team up and smash him.

Well, back home it's what I'm paid

against the Dallas Cowboys once ---

VULTAN

(TO BARIN)

Do you understand him?

BARIN

Not a word.

(LIKE ICE)

I was hunting him when you seized

me. Before you finish me. Vultan I

beg only that you let me finish him.

Oh god -- here we go again --

Is everyone on Mongo CRAZY? Haven't

you guys ever heard of TEAMWORK?

(TO BARIN)

When I had that damn snake in my

hand, I could've poked it in your

face and KILLED you.

I had you in bow-sight you were

In the high grass east of Mingo.

HEDONIA

Your wedding dress.

BARIN

A force-field covers the whole city,

from here to here. With luck, Flash

can lure them into lowering their

defenses.

VULTAN

What if he fails?

(ABRUPTLY)

This is suicide, Barin! I can't

order my men to suicide!

VULTAN (CONT'D)

The flight brought me back to my

senses -- good luck and goodbye.

Ming destroyed your kingdom!

We'll build another.

When I think of being given to Klytus,

I wish it was myself who had fallen.

I don't believe you. You -- you

awful Mongo person -- you were born

without a heart:

AURA

Then what is it that melts into my

eyes, Dale Arden? Feel it breaking --

DALE

You poor kid -- don't you have a MOM

to talk to?

Ming tired of her. He blew my Mother

into outer space. I look into the

night sky sometimes and wonder what

star she's orbiting --

God, Aura -- no wonder you've had

problems -- that bastard:

Well? What is it this time?

I can't remember. I feel danger --

but I cannot see it.

deserves you.

will be seen on the scanner.
