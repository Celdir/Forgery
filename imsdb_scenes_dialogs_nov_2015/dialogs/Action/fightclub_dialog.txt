FIGHT CLUB

JACK (V.O.)

People were always asking me, did I

know Tyler Durden.

TYLER

One minute.

(looking out window)

This is the beginning.  We're at

ground zero.  Maybe you should say a

few words, to mark the occasion.

JACK

... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

JACK (V.O.)

With a gun barrel between your teeth,

you only speak in vowels.

JACK

(still distorted)

I can't think of anything.

JACK (V.O.)

With my tongue, I can feel the

rifling in the barrel.  For a second,

I totally forgot about Tyler's whole

controlled demolition thing and I

wondered how clean this gun is.

TYLER

It's getting exciting now.

JACK (V.O.)

That old saying, how you always hurt

the one you love, well, it works both

way.

JACK (V.O.)

We have front row seats for this

Theater of Mass Destruction.  The

Demolitions Committee of Project

Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns

of ten buildings with blasting

gelatin.  In two minutes, primary

charges will blow base charges, and

those buildings will be reduced to

smoldering rubble.  I know this

because Tyler knows this.

TYLER

Look what we've accomplised.

(checks watch)

Thirty seconds.

JACK (V.O.)

Somehow, I realize all of this -- the

gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is

really about Marla Singer.

JACK (V.O.)

Bob had bitch tits.

JACK (V.O.)

This was a support group for men with

testicular cancer.  The big moosie

slobbering all over me was Bob.

BOB

We're still men.

JACK

Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

JACK (V.O.)

Six months ago, Bob's testicles were

removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He

developed bitch tits because his

testosterone was too high and his

body upped the estrogen.  That was

where my head fit -- into his huge,

sweating tits that hung enormous, the

way we think of God's as big.

BOB

They're gonna have to open my pec's

again to drain the fluid.

BOB

Okay.  You cry now.

JACK (V.O.)

Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

JACK (V.O.)

For six months.  I could not sleep.

JACK (V.O.)

With insomnia, nothing is real.

Everything is far away.  Everything

is a copy of a copy of a copy.

JACK (V.O.)

When deep space exploration ramps up,

it will be corporations that name

everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.

The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet

Starbucks.

BOSS

I'm going to need you out-of-town a

little more this week.  We've got

some "red-flags" to cover.

JACK (V.O.)

It must've been Tuesday.  he was

wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

JACK

(listless management speak)

You want me to de-prioritize my

current reports until you advise of

a status upgrade?

BOSS

You need to make these your primary

"action items."

JACK (V.O.)

He was full of pep.  Must've had his

grande latte enema.

BOSS

Here are your flight coupons.  Call

me from the road if there are any

snags.  Your itinerary...

JACK (V.O.)

Like everyone else, I had become a

slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

JACK

(into phone)

Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika

Pekkari slip covers.

JACK (V.O.)

If I saw something like clever coffee

table sin the shape of a yin and

yang, I had to have it.

JACK (V.O.)

Like the Johanneshov armchair in the

Strinne green stripe pattern...

JACK (V.O.)

Or the Rislampa wire lamps of

environmentally-friendly unbleached

paper.

JACK (V.O.)

Even the Vild hall clock of

galvanized steel, resting on the

Klipsk shelving unit.

JACK (V.O.)

I would flip through catalogs and

wonder, "What kind of dining set

defines me as a person?"  We used to

read pornography.  Now it was the

Horchow Collection.

JACK

No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that

sounds nice.  Apricot.

JACK (V.O.)

I had it all.  Even the glass dishes

with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

proof they were crafted by the

honest, simple, hard-working

indigenous peoples of wherever.

INTERN

No, you can't die of insomnia.

JACK

Maybe I died already.  Look at my

face.

INTERN

You need to lighten up.

JACK

Can't you give me something?

JACK (V.O.)

Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red

Seconals.

INTERN

(overlapping w/ above)

You need healthy, natural sleep.

Chew valerian root and get some more

exercise.

JACK

I'm in pain.

INTERN

(facetious)

You want to see pain?  Swing by First

Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the

guys with testicular cancer.  That's

pain.

SPEAKER

I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and

a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and

one boy.  We never could agree on

anything.

SPEAKER

Well, she had her first child a month

ago, a girl, with her new husband...

And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,

because she deserves...

LEADER

Everyone, let's thank Thomas for

sharing himself with us.

EVERYONE

(in unison)

Thank you, Thomas.

LEADER

I look around this room and I see a

lot of courage.  And it gives me

strength.  We give each other

strength.

LEADER

It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's

follow Thomas's example and open

ourselves.

LEADER

Can everyone find a partner?

JACK (V.O.)

The big moosie, his eyes already

shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees

together, invisible steps.

JACK (V.O.)

Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You

know that chest expansion program you

see on TV?  That was his idea.

BOB

...using steroids.  I was a juicer.

Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for

racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm

bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids

won't return my calls...

JACK (V.O.)

Strangers with this kind of honesty

make me go a big rubbery one.

BOB

Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

JACK (V.O.)

Then... something happened.  I was

lost in oblivion -- dark and silent

and complete.

JACK (V.O.)

I found freedom.  Losing all hope was

freedom.

JACK (V.O.)

Babies don't sleep this well.

JACK (V.O.)

I became addicted.

JACK (V.O.)

If I didn't say anything, people

assumed the worst.  They cried

harder.  I cried harder.

LEADER

Tonight, we're going to open the

green door -- the heart chakra...

JACK (V.O.)

I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host

to cancer or parasites; I was the

warm little center that the life of

this world crowded around.

LEADER

...And you open the door and you

step inside.  We're inside our

hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a

white ball of healing light.  That's

right, the pain itself is a ball of

healing light.

LEADER

It moves over your body, healing you.

Keep this going and step forward,

through the back door of the room.

Where does it lead?  To your cave.

Step forward into your cave.

LEADER'S VOICE

That's right.  You're going deeper

into your cave.  And you're going to

find your power animal...

PENGUIN

Slide.

JACK (V.O.)

Every evening I died and every

evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

CUT BACK TO:

JACK (V.O.)

Bob loved me because he thought my

testicles were removed too.  Being

there, my face against his tits,

ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

JACK (V.O.)

And, she ruined everything.

MARLA

This is cancer, right?

JACK (V.O.)

This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...

did not have testicular cancer.  She

was a liar.

JACK (V.O.)

She had no diseases at all.  I had

seen her at my melanoma Monday night

group ...

JACK (V.O.)

... and at "Free and Clear," my blood

parasites group Thursdays.

JACK (V.O.)

-- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my

tuberculosis Friday night.

CUT BACK TO:

JACK (V.O.)

Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie

reflected my lie.

JACK (V.O.)

And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I

couldn't cry.  So, once again, I

could not sleep.

JACK

(into phone)

No, I just can't believe that card is

declined -- Okay, okay, let me give

you a different card number.

JACK (V.O.)

Next group, after guided meditation,

after we open our chakras, when it's

time to hug, I'm going to grab that

little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her

arms against her sides and say...

JACK

Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I

need this.  Get out.

JACK (V.O.)

When you have insomnia, you're never

really asleep and you're never really

awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

JACK (V.O.)

-- But, in here, in everyone, there's

the squint of a five-day headache.

Yet they forced themselves to be

positive.  They never said

"parasite;" they said "agent."  They

always talked about getting better.

LEADER

Okay, everyone.

LEADER

To open tonight's communion, Chloe

would like to say a few words.

JACK (V.O.)

Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way

Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look

if you made it smile and walk around

a party being extra nice to everyone.

CHLOE

Well, I'm still here -- but I don't

know for how long.  That's as much

certainty as anyone can give me.  but

I've got some good news -- I no

longer have any fear of death.

CHLOE

But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

No one will have sex with me.  I'm so

close to the end and all I want is to

get laid for the last time.  I have

pornographic movies in my apartment,

and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

LEADER

Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's

thank Chloe.

EVERYONE

Thank you, Chloe.

LEADER

Now, you're standing at the entrance

to your cave.  You step inside your

cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

JACK (V.O.)

If I did have a tumor, I'd name it

Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on

the roof of your mouth that would

heal if only you could stop tonguing

it, but you can't.

LEADER

Now, find your power animal.

MARLA

Slide.

LEADER

Pick someone special to you tonight.

CHLOE

Hello, Mr. Tayler.

JACK (V.O.)

I never gave my real name at support

groups.

JACK

Hi, Chloe.

CHLOE

We've never actually talked.

JACK

You look good.  You ... look ... like

a pirate.

JACK

Excuse me, I have to...

JACK

We need to talk.

MARLA

Sure.

JACK

I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You

aren't dying.

MARLA

What?

JACK

Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy

way, we're all dying.  But you're not

dying the way Chloe is dying.

LEADER

Tell the other person how you feel.

JACK

You're a tourist.  I saw you at

melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular

cancer.

MARLA

And I saw you practicing this...

JACK

Practicing what?

MARLA

Telling me off.  Is it going as well

as you hoped... ?

(reads his nametag)

"... Mr. Taylor."

JACK

I'll expose you.

MARLA

Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

LEADER

Share yourself completely.

JACK

Why are you doing this?

MARLA

It's cheaper than a movie, and

there's free coffee.

JACK

These are my groups.  I was here

first.  I've been coming for a year.

MARLA

A year?  How'd you manage that?

JACK

Anyone who might've noticed either

died or recovered and never came back.

LEADER

Let yourself cry.

MARLA

Why do you do it?

JACK

I... I don't know.  I guess... when

people think you're dying, they

really listen, instead...

MARLA

-- Instead of just waiting for their

turn to speak.

JACK

Yeah.

LEADER

Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

JACK

(warning)

It becomes an addiction.

MARLA

Really?

JACK

Look, I can't cry with a faker

present.

MARLA

Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not

my problem.

JACK

Please.  Can't we do something... ?

LEADER

Now, the closing prayer.

JACK

We'll split up the week.  You can

have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

MARLA

You take tuberculosis.  My smoking

doesn't go over at all.

JACK

I think testicular cancer should be

no contest.

MARLA

Well, technically, I have more of a

right to be there than you.  You

still have your balls.

JACK

You're kidding.

MARLA

I don't know -- am I?

MARLA

I'll take the parasites.

JACK

You can't have both parasites.  You

can take blood parasites --

MARLA

I want brain parasites.

JACK

Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and

organic brain dementia --

MARLA

I want that.

JACK

You can't have the whole brain!

MARLA

So far, you have four and I only have

two!

JACK

Then, take blood parasites.  It's

yours.  Now we each have three.

JACK

You... left half your clothes.

JACK

You're selling those?

MARLA

(for the Clerk to hear)

Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

MARLA

So, we each have three -- that's six.

What about the seventh day?  I want

ascending bowel cancer.

JACK (V.O.)

The girl had done her homework.

JACK

I want ascending bowel cancer.

MARLA

That's your favorite, too?  Tried to

slip it by me, eh?

JACK

We'll split it.  You get it the first

and third Sunday of the month.

MARLA

Deal.

MARLA

Looks like this is goodbye.

JACK

Let's not make a big thing out of it.

MARLA

How's this for not making a big thing?

JACK

Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange

numbers?

MARLA

Should we?

JACK

In case we want to switch nights.

MARLA

I suppose.

MARLA

It doesn't have your name.  Who are

you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.

Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you

give each night?

JACK (V.O.)

This is how I met Marla Singer.

JACK (V.O.)

You wake up at O'Hare.

JACK (V.O.)

You wake up at SeaTac.

ATTENDANT

Check-in for that flight doesn't

begin for another two hours, Sir.

JACK (V.O.)

Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an

hour, gain an hour.  This is your

life, and it's ending one minute at

a time.

JACK (V.O.)

You wake up at Air Harbor

International.

JACK (V.O.)

If you wake up at a different time

and in a different place, could you

wake up as a different person?

JACK (V.O.)

Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.

Single-serving sugar, single-serving

cream, single pat of butter.

CUT TO:

JACK (V.O.)

Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

JACK (V.O.)

Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-

serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

JACK (V.O.)

The people I meet on each flight --

they're single-serving friends.

Between take-off and landing, we have

our time together, but that's all we

get.

JACK (V.O.)

You wake up at Logan.

JACK (V.O.)

On a long enough time line, the

survival rate for everyone drops to

zero.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is

to apply the formula.  It's a story

problem.

TECHNICIAN #1

Here's where the infant went through

the windshield.  Three points.

JACK (V.O.)

A new car built by my company leaves

somewhere traveling at 60 miles per

hour.  The rear differential locks up.

TECHNICIAN #2

The teenager's braces around the

backseat ashtray would make a good

"anti-smoking" ad.

JACK (V.O.)

The car crashes and burns with

everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we

initiate a recall?

TECHNICIAN #1

The father must've been huge.  See

how the fat burnt into the driver's

seat with his polyester shirt?  Very

"modern art."

JACK (V.O.)

Take the number of vehicles in the

field, (A), and multiply it by the

probable rate of failure, (B), then

multiply the result by the average

out-of-court settlement, (C).  A

times B times C equals X...

CUT TO:

JACK

If X is less than the cost of a

recall, we don't do one.

BUSISNESS WOMAN

Are there a lot of these kinds of

accidents?

JACK

Oh, you wouldn't believe.

BUSINESS WOMAN

... Which... car company do you work

for?

JACK

A major one.

JACK (V.O.)

Every time the plane banked too

sharply on take-off or landing, I

prayed for a crash, or a mid-air

collision -- anything.

JACK (V.O.)

No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,

not even bad breath.

JACK (V.O.)

Life insurance pays off triple if you

die on a business trip.

VOICE

There are three ways to make napalm.

One, mix equal parts of gasoline and

frozen orange juice...

TYLER

Two, equal parts gasoline and diet

cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter

in gasoline until the mixture is

thick.

JACK

Pardon me?

JACK (V.O.)

This is how I met --

TYLER

Tyler Durden.

TYLER

You know why they have oxygen masks

on planes?

JACK

No, supply oxygen?

TYLER

Oxygen gets you high.  In a

catastrophic emergency, we're taking

giant, panicked breaths...

TYLER

Suddenly, we become euphoic and

docile.  We accept our fate.

TYLER

Emergency water landing, 600 miles

per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as

Hindu cows.

JACK

What do you do, Tyler?

TYLER

What do you want me to do?

JACK

I mean -- for a living.

TYLER

Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's

what you do." -- And be a smug little

shit about it?

TYLER

You have a kind of sick desperation

in your laugh.

JACK

We have the same briefcase.

TYLER

Open it.

TYLER

Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.

(reaches in his pocket)

I make and sell soap...

TYLER

If you were to add nitric acid to the

soap-making process, one would get

nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one

could blow up the world, if one were

so inclined.

JACK

Tyler, you are by far the most

interesting "single-serving" friend

I've ever met.

JACK

You see, when you travel, everything

is small, self-contained--

TYLER

The spork.  I get it.  You're very

clever.

JACK

Thank you.

TYLER

How's that working out for you?

JACK

What?

TYLER

Being clever.

JACK

(thrown)

Well, uh... great.

TYLER

Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

TYLER

... As I squeeze past, do I give you

the ass or the crotch?

TYLER

We are defined by the choices we make.

JACK (V.O.)

How I came to live with Tyler is:

airlines have this policy about

vibrating luggage.

SECURITY TFM

(to Jack)

Throwers don't worry about ticking.

Modern bombs don't tick.

JACK

Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

SECURITY TFM

Baggage handlers.  But when a

suitcase vibrates, the throwers have

to call the police.

JACK

My suitcase was vibrating?

SECURITY TFM

Nine time out of ten, it's an

electric razor.  But, every once in

a while ...

(whispers)

...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy

not to imply ownership in the event

of a dildo.  We use the indefinite

aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your

dildo."

JACK

(to Security TFM)

I had everything in that bag.  My

C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

SECURITY TFM

(into phone)

Yeah, uh huh... yeah?

(pause, still on phone)

Oh...

SECURITY TFM

I'm terribly sorry.

SECURITY TFM

You know the industry slang for

"Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

JACK (V.O.)

Home was a condo on the fifteenth

floor of a filing cabinet for widows

and young professionals.  The walls

were solid concrete.  A foot of

concrete is important when your next-

door neighbor lets her hearing aid go

and has to watch game shows at full

volume...

JACK (V.O.)

-- Or when a volcanic blast of debris

that used to be your furniture and

personal effects blows out your floor-

to-ceiling windows and sails flaming

into the night.

DOORMAN

There's nothing up there.

DOORMAN

You can't go into the unit.  Police

orders.

JACK (V.O.)

How embarrassing.

DOORMAN

Do you have somebody you can call?

JACK (V.O.)

The police would later tell me that

the pilot light might have gone

out... letting out just a little bit

of gas.

DOORMAN

Lots of young people try to impress

the world and buy too many things.

JACK (V.O.)

The gas could have slowly filled the

condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet

with high ceilings, for days and days.

DOORMAN

Many young people feel trapped and

desperate.

JACK (V.O.)

Then, the refrigerator's compressor

could have clicked on...

DOORMAN

If you don't know what you want, you

end up with a lot you don't.

JACK (V.O.)

If you asked me now, I couldn't tell

you why I called him.

JACK

Hello?

TYLER'S VOICE

Who's this?

JACK

Tyler?

TYLER'S VOICE

Who's this?

JACK

Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the

plane.  We had the same briefcase.

I'm... you know, the clever guy.

TYLER'S VOICE

Oh, yeah.

JACK

I just called a second ago.  There

was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

TYLER'S VOICE

I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick

up my phone.  What's up?

JACK

Well... let me see... here's the

thing...

JACK

You buy furniture.  You tell

yourself: this is the last sofa I'll

ever need.  No matter what else

happens, I've got the sofa issue

handled.  Then, the right set of

dishes.  The right dinette.

TYLER

This is how we fill up our lives.

JACK

I guess so.

TYLER

And, now it's gone.

JACK

All gone.

TYLER

Could be worse.  A woman could cut

off your penis while you're asleep

and toss it out the window of a

moving car.

JACK

There's always that.

TYLER

I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe

it's a terrible tragedy.

JACK

...no ...no ...

TYLER

I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,

neat little shit.  The trendy paper

lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,

am I right?

TYLER

But maybe, just maybe, you've been

delivered.

JACK

(toasts)

Delivered from Swedish furniture.

TYLER

Delivered from armchairs in obscure

green stripe patterns.

JACK

Delivered from Martha Stewart.

TYLER

Delivered from bullshit colors like

"Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

JACK

Insurance'll cover it.

TYLER

Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the

list.

JACK

What list?

TYLER

The "now I get to go out and buy the

exact same stuff all over again"

list.  That list.

JACK

I don't... think so.

TYLER

This time maybe get a widescreen TV.

You'll be occupied for weeks.

JACK

Well, I have to file a claim...

TYLER

The things you own, they end up

owning you.

JACK

Don't I?

TYLER

Do what you like.

JACK

(looks at watch)

God, it's late.  I should find a

hotel...

TYLER

A hotel?

JACK

Yeah.

TYLER

So, you called me up, because you

just wanted to have a drink before

you... go find a hotel?

JACK

I don't follow...

TYLER

We're on our third pitcher of beer.

Just ask me.

JACK

Huh?

TYLER

You called me so you could have a

place to stay.

JACK

No, I...

TYLER

Why don't you cut the shit and ask if

you can stay at my place?

JACK

Would that be a problem?

TYLER

Is it a problem for you to ask?

JACK

Can I stay at your place?

TYLER

Yes, you can.

JACK

Thank you.

TYLER

You're welcome.  But, I want you to

do me one favor.

JACK

What's that?

TYLER

I want you to hit me as hard as you

can.

JACK

What?

TYLER

I want you to hit me as hard as you

can.

JACK (V.O.)

Let me tell you a little bit about

Tyler Durden.

JACK

Tyler was a night person.  He

sometimes worked as a projectionist.

A movie doesn't come in one big reel,

it's on a few.  In old theaters, two

projectors are used, so someone has

to change projectors at the exact

second when one reel ends and

another reel begins.  Sometimes you

can see two dots on screen in the

upper right hand corner...

TYLER

They're called "cigarette burns."

JACK

It's called a "changeover."  The

movie goes on, and nobody in the

audience has any idea.

TYLER

Why would anyone want this shitty job?

JACK

It affords him other interesting

opportunities.

TYLER

-- Like splicing single frames from

adult movies into family films.

JACK

In reel three, right after the

courageous dog and the snooty cag --

who have celebrity voices -- eat out

of a garbage can, there's the flash

of Tyler's contribution...

TYLER

One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's

how long it's up there.

JACK

No one really knows that they've seen it.

But they did.

TYLER

A nice, big cock.

JACK

Only a hummingbird could have caught

Tyler at work.

JACK

Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter

at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

JACK

He was the guerrilla terrorist of the

food service industry.

TYLER

Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

TYLER

... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

JACK

He farted on meringue; he sneezed on

braised endive; and, with creme of

mushroom soup, well...

TYLER (O.S.)

Go ahead.  Say it.

JACK

You get the idea.

JACK

I don't know about this.

TYLER

I don't know, either.  I want to find

out.  I've never been hit, have you?

JACK

No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

TYLER

I don't want to die without any

scars.  How much can you really know

about yourself if you've never been

in a fight?  Come on... you're the

only person I've ever asked.

JACK

Me?

TYLER

Why not you?  I'm letting you go

first.  Do it.

JACK

This is crazy.

TYLER

Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

JACK

Where do you want it?  In the face?

TYLER

Surprise me.

JACK

Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

TYLER

Like hell.  That counted.

TYLER

How do you feel?

JACK

Strange.

TYLER

But a good strange.

JACK

Is it?

TYLER

We've crossed the threshold.  You

want to call it off?

JACK

Call what off?

TYLER

The fight.

JACK

What fight?

TYLER

This fight, pussy.

TYLER

If you could fight anyone... one on

one, whoever you wanted, who would

you fight?

JACK

Anyone?

TYLER

Anyone.

JACK

My boss, probably.

(pause)

Who would you fight?

TYLER

My dad.  No question.

JACK

Oh, yeah.

(nodding)

I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew

him, till I was six.  He went and

married another woman, had more kids.

Every six years or so he'd do it

again -- new city, new family.

TYLER

He was setting up franchises.  My

father never went to college, so it

was really important that I go.

JACK

I know that.

TYLER

After I graduated, I called him long

distance and asked, "Now what?"  He

said, "Get a job."  When I turned

twenty-five, I called him and asked,

"Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.

Get married."

JACK

Same here.

TYLER

A generation of men raised by women.

I'm wondering if another woman is the

answer we really need.

JACK

We should do this again sometime.

JACK

Where's your car?

TYLER

What car?

JACK (V.O.)

I don't know how Tyler found the

house, but he'd been there for half

a year.

JACK (V.O.)

It looked like it was waiting to be

torn down.  Most of the windows were

boarded up.

JACK (V.O.)

None of the doors locked.  The stairs

were ready to collapse.  I didn't

know if he owned it or he was

squatting.

JACK (V.O.)

Neither would have surprised me.

JACK (V.O.)

Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing

leaked.  Turning on a light meant

another light in the house went out.

JACK (V.O.)

There were no neighbors.  Just

warehouses and the paper mill.  The

fart smell of steam, the hamster cage

smell of wood chips.

JACK (V.O.)

At night, Tyler and I were alone for

half a mile in every direction.

JACK (V.O.)

When it rained, we had to kill the

power.  By the end of the first

month, I didn't care about TV.  I

didn't mind the warm, stale

refrigerator.

JACK (V.O.)

The previous occupant had been a bit

of a shut-in.

TYLER

(of magazine)

Hum.

JACK

What?

TYLER

Oh, a new riot control grenade...

(reading)

"...the successful combination of

concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-

blasts and simultaneous high-velocity

disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

JACK

("Reader's Digest")

"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in

first person.  "Without me, Joe could

not take in oxygen to feed his red

blood cells."  There's a whole

series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

TYLER

"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

JACK

What are you reading?

TYLER

Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.

New Republic.

JACK

Show-off.

JACK (V.O.)

I should have been haggling with my

insurance company.  I should have

been looking for a new condo...

JACK (V.O.)

.... I should have been upset about

my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

JACK (V.O.)

But I wasn't.

JACK (V.O.)

Most of the week, we were Ozzie and

Harriet.

JACK (V.O.)

But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday

night...

JACK (V.O.)

... we were finding something out: we

were finding out, more and more, that

we were not alone.

JACK (V.O.)

Thursday mornings, all I could do was

think about next week.

WALTER

The basic premise of cyber-netting

your office is -- make things more

efficient.

BOSS

Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

WALTER

Absolutely.

JACK (V.O.)

Walter, the Microsoft account exec.

Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.

Maybe he was thinking about the free-

range potluck he'd been to last

weekend, or his church-group car-wash

fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

WALTER

I showed this already to my man here.

You liked it, didn't you?

JACK (V.O.)

You can swallow a pint of blood

before you get sick.

WALTER

Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened

to the other guy.

JACK (V.O.)

Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't

last a second Wednesday night.

IRVINE

Drink up people.  We're closing.

JACK (V.O.)

It was right in everyone's face.

Tyler and I just made it visible.

JACK (V.O.)

It was on the tip of everyone's

tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a

name.

TYLER

Welcome to fight club.

JACK (V.O.)

Every week, Tyler gave the rules that

he and I decided.

TYLER

The first rule of fight club is --

you don't talk about fight club.  The

second rule of fight club is -- you

don't talk about fight club.  The

third rule of fight club is -- when

someone says "stop" or goes limp, the

fight is over.  Fourth rule is --

only two guys to a fight.  Fifth

rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth

rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh

rule -- fights go on as long as they

have to.  And the eighth and final

rule -- if this is your first night

at fight club, you have to fight.

JACK (V.O.)

This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --

couldn't remember whether you ordered

pens with blue ink or black ink ...

JACK (V.O.)

But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

last week when he trounced an actuary

twice his size.

JACK (V.O.)

Sometimes all you could hear were

flat, hard packing sounds over the

yelling, or the wet choke when

someone caught their breath and

sprayed...

GOATEED MAN

(spittle-lipped)

Ssssstop... !

JACK (V.O.)

Even if I could tell someone they had

a good fight, I wouldn't be talking

to the same man.

JACK (V.O.)

Who you were in fight club is not who

you were in the rest of the world.

JACK (V.O.)

You weren't alive anywhere like you

were there.  But fight club only

exists in the hours between when

fight club starts and when fight club

ends.

BOSS

What are you getting yourself into

every week?

JACK (V.O.)

After fight club, everything else in

your life gets the volume turned

down.  You can deal with anything.

BOSS

Have you finished those reports?

JACK

(handing him reports)

Yes.

JACK (V.O.)

The people who had power over you

have less and less.

JACK (V.O.)

By this point, I could wiggle most of

the teeth in my jaw.

JACK (V.O.)

A guy came to fight club for the

first time, his ass was a wad of

cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he

was carved out of wood.

JACK

If you could fight any celebrity?

TYLER

Alive or dead?

JACK

Doesn't matter.

TYLER

Hemingway.  You?

JACK

Shatner.  William Shatner.

JACK (V.O.)

We all started seeing things

differently.  Wherever we went.

JACK (V.O.)

I felt sorry for all the guys packing

into gyms, trying to look like what

Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said

they should.

TYLER

Self-improvement is masturbation.

Self-destruction is the answer.

JACK

(to Tyler, so the

Man can hear)

You could take him.

TYLER

The trick is not to care.

CUT TO:

JACK (V.O.)

Fight club wasn't about winning or

losing.  It wasn't about words.

JACK (V.O.)

They hysterical shouting was in

tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

JACK

... stop...

JACK (V.O.)

When the fight was over, nothing was

solved, but nothing mattered.

TYLER

Cool.

OPPONENT

How about next week?

JACK

Look at me.  How about next month?

JACK (V.O.)

Afterwards, we all felt saved.

TYLER

He fell down some stairs.

JACK

I fell down some stairs.

JACK (V.O.)

Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

JACK (V.O.)

Fight club became the reason to cut

your hair short and trim your

fingernails.

TYLER

Any historical figure.

JACK

Okay... Ghandi.

TYLER

Good answer.

JACK

You?

TYLER

Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys

fight till they're burger.

TYLER

Remember, even the Mona Lisa's

falling apart.

JACK

Hello?

MARLA

Where have you been the last few

weeks?

JACK

Marla?

JACK

(quietly)

How did you find me?

MARLA

The forwarding number.  I haven't

seen you at any support groups.

JACK

That's the idea -- we split them.

MARLA

You haven't been going to yours.

JACK

I found a new one.

MARLA

Really?

JACK

It's for men.

MARLA

Like testicular cancer?

JACK

Look, this is a bad time...

MARLA

I've been going to debtor's

anonymous.  You want to see some

truly fucked up people?

JACK

I'm just on my way out...

MARLA

Me too.  I got a stomach full of

Xanax.  I took what was left of a

bottle.  Might've been too much.

JACK (V.O.)

Picture yourself watching Marla

Singer throw herself around her

crummy apartment.

MARLA

This isn't a for-real suicide thing.

This is probably one of those cry-for-

help things.

JACK (V.O.)

This could go on for hours.

JACK

So you're staying in tonight?

MARLA

Do you want to wait to hear me

describe death?

MARLA'S VOICE

Do you want to listen and see if my

spirit can use the telephone?

CUT TO:

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been

living here two months, and Tyler's

door was never closed.

JACK

You're not going to believe what I

dreamt last night.

MARLA

I can hardly believe anything about

last night.

JACK

What are you doing here?

MARLA

What... ?

JACK

What the hell are you doing here?

MARLA

Fuck you.

TYLER

She's a piece of work.  Get this --

I come in here last night, the

phone's off the hook...

JACK (V.O.)

I already knew the story before he

told it to me.

MARLA'S VOICE

(from handset)

I'll tell you when I'm floating out

of my body.

JACK (V.O.)

How could Tyler, off all people, think

it was a bad thing that Marla Singer

was about to die?

MARLA

You got here fast.

MARLA

The mattresses are all sealed in

slippery plastic.

MARLA

Did I call you?

MARLA

Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

MARLA

Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

COP

8-G!  Where's 8-G?

MARLA

(pointing)

End of the hall.

MARLA

(calling after)

The girl who lives there used to be

a charming, lovely girl, but she's

lost faith in herself...

COP

Miss Singer, let us help you!  You

have every reason to live!

MARLA

She's a monster!  Infectious human

waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

MARLA

If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

You're gonna have to keep me up all

night.

TYLER

Unbelievable, huh?

JACK (V.O.)

He was obviously able to handle it.

TYLER

I mean, this girl... uh, you're not

into her or anything... ?

JACK

No.  Not at all.

JACK (V.O.)

I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

TYLER

You're sure?

JACK

Yeah, I'm sure.

TYLER

Good.  This chick was up on the table

with her legs in the stirrups before

the doctor even walked in the room.

The things that she said... I've

never heard a woman talk like that...

MARLA

(whispering)

I want to have your abortion.

JACK (V.O.)

How could Tyler not go for that?

Night before last, he was splicing

sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

TYLER

You're okay with this?

JACK

I'm fine.

JACK (V.O.)

Put a gun to my head and paint the

wall with my brains.

TYLER

She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay

away from that one.

JACK

Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

TYLER

Hey... don't knock librarians.

JACK

Marla doesn't need a lover.  She

needs a case worker.

TYLER

She needs an exorcist.  This isn't

love.  This is sport-fucking.

JACK (V.O.)

She'd invaded my support groups, now

she's invading my home.

TYLER

Listen... do me a favor... sit here

a minute...

JACK

What?

TYLER

You've gotta understand something

about me.  I have a little rule,

okay?  Don't ever talk to her about

me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind

of shit.

TYLER

If you ever say anything about me or

about what happens here in this

house, to her or anyone -- I will

find out.  And you'll never see me

again.  Promise me.

JACK

Okay.

TYLER

Promise you won't.

JACK

Yes, I promise.

TYLER

Promise?

JACK

I said I promise!

TYLER

That was three times you promised.

JACK (V.O.)

If only I had wasted a couple of

minutes and gone to watch Marla die,

none of this would have happened.

MARLA'S VOICE

(muffled through wall)

Miserable fucking discharge!

JACK (V.O.)

I could've moved to another room, one

on the third floor -- so I wouldn't

have heard them.  But I didn't.

TYLER

What are you doing?

JACK

I... uh... just going to bed.

TYLER

You want to finish her off?

JACK

Uh... nah...

JACK (V.O.)

I became the calm, little center of

the world.  I was the Zen master.

"Worker bees can leave

Even drones can fly away

The queen is their slave"

JACK (V.O.)

I wrote little haiku poems.

JACK (V.O.)

I faxed them around to everyone.

BOSS

Is that your blood?

JACK

Some of it, yes.

BOSS

Take the rest of the day off.  Come

back tomorrow with clean clothes.

Get yourself together.

JACK (V.O.)

I got right in everyone's hostile

little face.  Yes, these are bruises

from fighting.  I'm comfortable with

them.  I am enlightened.

JACK (V.O.)

You give up the condo life, give up

all your flaming worldly possessions,

go live in a dilapidated house in the

toxic waste part of town...

JACK (V.O.)

... and you come home to this.

TYLER'S VOICE

(laughing)

You fucking slut!!

MARLA'S VOICE

Thank you, sir, may I have another!

Thank you sir, may I have another... !

JACK

Yeah.  Speaking.

DETECTIVE STERN

This is Detective Stern with the

arson unit.  We have some new

information about the "incident" at

your condo.

JACK

Yes?

DETECTIVE STERN

I don't know if you're aware... your

front door -- it seems someone

sprayed freon into the lock, then

tapped it with a chisel to shatter

the cylinder.

JACK

No, I wasn't aware...

JACK (V.O.)

I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

DETECTIVE STERN

Does this sound strange to you?

JACK

Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

DETECTIVE STERN

The dynamite...

JACK

Dynamite?

DETECTIVE STERN

Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium

oxalate and potassium perchloride.

Do you know what that means?

JACK

What does that mean?

DETECTIVE STERN

It means it was homemade.

JACK

This is... really a shock...

DETECTIVE STERN

Whoever set this homemade dynamite

could've blown out the pilot light

days before the explosion.  The gas,

it seems, was just a detonator.

JACK

Who do you think could've done this?

DETECTIVE STERN

I'll ask the questions, son.

TYLER

(whispering in Jack's ear)

Tell him...

JACK

Huh?

TYLER

(overlap w/below)

"The liberator who destroyed my

property has re-aligned my paradigm

of perception."

JACK

Shhhhhh!

(into phone,

overlap w/above)

I don't know what to make of this,

sir, I really don't...

DETECTIVE STERN

Do you know anyone who'd have the

expertise or motive to do something

like this?

TYLER

"I reject the basic assumptions of

civilization, including material

possession."

JACK

(into phone)

No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.

I loved every stick of furniture.

The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were

me.  The dishes were me.  The plants

were...

JACK (V.O.)

I'd like to thank the academy...

DETECTIVE STERN

Well, if any ideas come to you, give

me a call.  In the meantime, don't

leave town.  I may need to bring you

in for questioning.

TYLER

Could be worse.  You could be cursed

with the three terrible Karmas.  You

could be beautiful, rich and famous.

JACK (V.O.)

Except for their humping, Tyler and

Marla were never in the same room.

MARLA

I got this dress at a thrift store

for one dollar.

JACK

(keeps scrubbing)

Worth every penny.

JACK (V.O.)

My parents pulled this exact act for

years -- one came in, the other

disappeared.

MARLA

(seductive)

It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone

loved it intensely for one day, then

tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --

so special, then, bam -- it's

abandoned on the side of the road,

tinsel still clinging to it...

MARLA

Like sex crime victims, underwear

inside-out, bound with electrical

tape.

JACK

(coldly)

It suits you.

MARLA

You can borrow it sometime.

TYLER (O.S.)

Get rid of her.

JACK

You get rid of her.

TYLER

(pointing at Jack)

Don't mention me.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm six years old again, passing

messages between my parents.

JACK

I, uh... think you should go now.

JACK

It's time for you to leave.

MARLA

Don't worry, I'm leaving.

MARLA

You're such a nutcase, I can't even

begin to keep up.

JACK

Goodbye.

TYLER (O.S.)

Nice work.

TYLER

To make soap, first we have to render

fat.

TYLER

The best fat for making soap --

because the salt balance is just

right -- comes form human bodies...

JACK

What is this place?

TYLER

A liposuction clinic.

TYLER

Paydirt.  From society's richest

asses and thighs.

TYLER

As the fat renders, the tallow floats

to the surface.  Remember the crap

they taught you in Boy Scouts.

JACK

Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

TYLER

This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll

mix it back in when we make the soap.

TYLER

Lye -- the crucial ingredient.

(adding lye to mix)

Ancient peoples found their clothes

got cleaner if they washed them at a

certain spot in the river.  Why?

Because, human sacrifices were once

made on the hills above this river.

Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain

feel.  Water seeped through the wood

ashes to become lye.  The lye

combined with the melted fat of the

bodies, till a thick white soapy

discharge crept into the river.

TYLER

The first soap was made from the

ashes of heroes.  Like the first

monkeys shot into space.

TYLER

Without sacrifice, without death, we

would have nothing.

TYLER

This is a chemical burn.  It will

hurt more than you've ever been

burned and you will have a scar.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the

back of my hand.

TYLER

Look at your hand.

JACK (V.O.)

Guided meditation worked for cancer,

it could work for this.

TYLER

Come back to the pain.  Don't shut

this out.

JACK (V.O.)

I tried not to think of the words

"searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my

pain as a ball of healing white light.

TYLER

Stop it.  This is your pain -- your

burning hand.  It's right here.  Look

at it.

JACK (V.O.)

I was going to my cave to find my

power animal.

TYLER

Don't deal with this the way those

dead people do.  Deal with it the way

a living person does.

JACK

I... I think I understand.  I think

I get it...

TYLER

No, what you're feeling is premature

enlightenment.

TYLER

This is the greatest moment of your

life and you're off somewhere,

missing it.

JACK

No, I'm not...

TYLER

Shut up.  Our fathers were our models

for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,

what does that tell us about God?

JACK

I don't know...

TYLER

Listen to me.  You have to consider

the possibility that God doesn't like

you, he never wanted you.  In all

probability, He hates you.  This is

not the worst thing that can happen...

JACK

It isn't... ?

TYLER

We don't need him...

JACK

We don't... ?

JACK

... Marla ... ?

TYLER

Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We

are God's unwanted children, with no

special place and no special

attention, and so be it.

TYLER

You can go to the sink and run water

over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you

can use vinegar to neutralize the

burn, but first you have to give up.

First, you have to know that someday,

you are going to die.  Until you know

that, you will be useless.

JACK

You ... you don't know what this

feels like, Tyler.

TYLER

Congratulations.  You're a step

closer to hitting bottom.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler sold the soap to department

stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God

knows what they charged.  How ironic.

We were selling rich women their own

fat asses back to them.

JACK (V.O.)

He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must

be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie

to work anymore.

BOSS

"The first rule of fight club is you

don't talk about fight club."

JACK (V.O.)

I must've left the original in the

copy machine.

BOSS

"The second rule of fight club...

Is this yours?

JACK

Hmm?

BOSS

You don't get paid to abuse the copy

machine.

JACK

"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an

image.

BOSS

Pretend you're me.  You find this.

What would you do?

JACK

Me? I'd be very careful who I talked

to about this.  It sounds like

someone dangerous wrote it... someone

who might snap at any moment,

stalking from office to office with

an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas

semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round

after round into colleagues and co-

workers.

JACK

Might be someone you've known for

years... somebody very close to you.

Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing

me every little piece of trash you

pick up.

JACK

Compliance and Liability.

MARLA'S VOICE

My tit's going to rot off.

JACK

Just a second.

(to Boss; smiles)

Could you excuse me?  I need to take

this call.

JACK

(into phone)

What are you talking about?

MARLA

Would you do something for me?  I

need you to check and see if there's

a lump in my breast.  I can't afford

to throw money away on a doctor.

JACK

I don't know ...

MARLA

Please.

JACK (V.O.)

She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral

in her book.

JACK

This is a sweet side of you.  Picking

these up for ...

(reads the boxes:)

"Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."

Where are they?

MARLA

Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive

and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

JACK

No, thanks.

MARLA

Good.

MARLA

What happened to your hand?

JACK

Nothing.

JACK

Where?  Here?

MARLA

Here.

JACK

There?

MARLA

Here.

JACK

Here.

MARLA

Feel anything?

JACK

No.

MARLA

Make sure.

JACK

Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

MARLA

You feel nothing?

JACK

Nothing.

MARLA

Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

JACK

No... no problem.

MARLA

I wish I could return the favor.

JACK

I think everything's okay here.

MARLA

I could check your prostate.

JACK

Uh ... nah.

MARLA

(pause)

Well... thanks, anyway.

JACK

So.... are we done?

MARLA

Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

BOB

Cornelius!  How are you?

JACK

Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

BOB

Better than I've ever been in my life.

JACK

Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men

Together?"

BOB

No.  I found something new.

JACK

Really, what's that?

BOB

(quietly)

The first rule is... you aren't

supposed to talk about it...

JACK

Oh.

BOB

And the second rule about it is...

you're not supposed to talk about it.

And the third rule...

JACK

Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

BOB

You are?!

JACK

Look at my face.

BOB

That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking

great! Congratulations.

JACK

Yeah, both of us.

BOB

You know about the guy who invented

it? I hear all kinds of things.

Supposedly, he was born in a mental

institution.  They say he only sleeps

one hour a night.  You know about

this guy?  Tyler Durden?

BOB

Thank you.  Thank you.

JACK

You're welcome.

JACK (V.O.)

Fight club -- this was mine and

Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

TYLER

No thanks, I quit.

JACK

You quit?

TYLER

Yeah.  Where you headed?

JACK

Work.  Going to work.

JACK

What... ?

TYLER

Nothing.  Do what you like.

JACK

We need to talk.

BOSS

Okay.  Where to begin?  With your

constant absenteeism?  With your

unpresentable appearance?  You're up

for review...

JACK

I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

JACK

Let's pretend.  You're the Department

of Transportation, and you discover

that our company intentionally did

nothing about leather seats cured in

third world countries with chemicals

we know cause birth defects?  Brake

linings that fail after a thousand

miles.  Fuel injectors that burn

people alive.

BOSS

Just who the fuck do you think you

are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

JACK

What about this?  Keep me on payroll

as an outside consultant.  In

exchange for my salary, I'll keep my

mouth shut.  I won't need to come to

the office.  I can do this job from

home.

BOSS

You little fucker!  I oughta...

JACK (V.O.)

I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

JACK

Please... don't hit me again, please.

I'm your responsibility...

JACK (V.O.)

For some reason, I thought of my

first fight -- with Tyler.

JACK

Please... give me the paychecks like

I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.

You won't see me again.

JACK (V.O.)

Under and behind and inside

everything this man took for granted,

something horrible had been growing.

JACK

Please... please...

JACK (V.O.)

And right then, at our most excellent

moment together...

JACK

(gurgling blood)

Please don't hit me again.

JACK

Six months advance pay.  Six months!

TYLER

Fucking sweet.

JACK

Okay, and... and...

JACK

Forty-eight airline flight coupons.

Plus... hold on... just a minute...

JACK

I am now officially self-employed.

TYLER

Good for you.

TYLER

I look around... I look around and

see a lot of new faces.

TYLER

Shut up!  Which means a lot of you

have been breaking the first two

rules of fight club.

TYLER

I see in fight club the strongest and

smartest men who have ever lived --

an entire generation pumping gas and

waiting tables; or they're slaves

with white collars.

(more)

TYLER (cont)

Advertisements have them chasing cars

and clothes, working jobs they hate

so they can buy shit they don't need.

We are the middle children of

history, with no purpose or place.

We have no great war, or great

depression.  The great war is a

spiritual war.  The great depression

is our lives.  We were raised by

television to believe that we'd be

millionaires and movie gods and rock

stars -- but we won't.  And we're

learning that fact.  And we're very,

very pissed-off.

TYLER

We are the quiet young men who listen

until it's time to decide.

TYLER

Who are you?

FAT MAN (LOU)

Who am I?!  There's a sign on the

front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm

fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

TYLER

Tyler Durden.

LOU

Who told you motherfuckers you could

use my place?

TYLER

We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

LOU

Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a

broken collarbone.

LOU

He don't own this place, I do.  How

much money's he getting for this?

TYLER

There is no money.

LOU

Really?

TYLER

It's free to all.

LOU

Ain't that something?

TYLER

Yes, it is.

LOU

Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone

outta here now!

TYLER

You're welcome to join our club.

LOU

Did you hear what I just said?!

TYLER

You and your friend.

LOU

You hear me now?

TYLER

No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

TYLER

We really need to use this place.

TYLER

That's it.... that's good.  Get it

all out.  You'll feel better.

TYLER

Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and

this whole fucking world...

TYLER

You don't know where I've been.

TYLER

We need this place.  We need it.

Please let us keep it, please...

LOU

What are you doing?!

TYLER

Pleeeeeease!

LOU

Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the

basement!  Get off me!

TYLER

We need some towels, Lou.  We need

replacement light bulbs.

LOU

Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

TYLER

Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

LOU

Let go of me!!

TYLER

This week, each of you has a homework

assignment.  You're going to go out

and start a fight with a total

stranger...

(pause, drooling blood)

You're going to start a fight... and

you're going to lose.

JACK (V.O.)

Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll

do just about anything to avoid a

fight.

YUPPIE

Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what

are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

YUPPIE

Get away from me!  Keep away!

NO... !

YUPPIE

Who are you!?  Why are you attacking

me... ?!

FIRST MAN

Hey... hey...

SECOND MAN

Watch out, jackass!

SEMINARIAN

You... you did that on purpose!

JACK (V.O.)

Now nobody was the center of fight

club except the two men fighting.

The leader walked around in the

crowd, out in the darkness.

JACK (V.O.)

Everyone took a homework assignment.

JACK

There's fight club in Delaware City.

TYLER

I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

JACK

Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.

And, Bob said he was at fight club in

Newcastle last week.

TYLER

Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

JACK

I thought you did.

TYLER

Let me have that a minute...

JACK

What are we doing?

TYLER

Homework assignment.

JACK

What is it?

TYLER

Human Sacrifice.

JACK (V.O.)

On a long enough time line, the

survival rate for everyone drops to

zero.

CLERK

Please... don't...

TYLER

Give me your wallet.

TYLER

Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,

apartment A.  A small, cramped

basement apartment.

RAYMOND

How'd you know?

TYLER

They give basement apartments letters

instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're

going to die.

TYLER

Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

RAYMOND

Yesssss...

TYLER

Your mom and dad will have to call

kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up

your dental records, because there

won't be much left of your face.

RAYMOND

Please, God, no...

JACK

Tyler...

TYLER

An expired community college student

ID card.  What did you used to study,

Raymond K. Hessel?

RAYMOND

S-S-Stuff.

TYLER

"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

TYLER

I asked you what you studied.

JACK

Tell him!

RAYMOND

Biology, mostly.

TYLER

Why?

RAYMOND

I... I don't know...

TYLER

What did you want to be, Raymond K.

Hessel?

TYLER

The question, Raymond, was "what did

you want to be?"

JACK

Answer him!

RAYMOND

A veterinarian!

TYLER

Animals.

RAYMOND

Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

TYLER

Stuff.  That means you have to get

more schooling.

RAYMOND

Too much school.

TYLER

Would you rather be dead?

RAYMOND

No, please, no, God, no!

RAYMOND

NOOOOO!

TYLER

I'm keeping your license.  I know

where you live.  I'm going to check

on you.  If you aren't back in school

and on your way to being a

veterinarian in six weeks, you will

be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

JACK

I feel sick.

TYLER

Imagine how he feels.

JACK

I don't care, that was horrible.

TYLER

Tomorrow will be the most beautiful

day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

TYLER

His breakfast will taste better than

any meal he has ever eaten.

TYLER

(muttering quietly)

... You are not how much money you

have in the bank.  You are not the

shoes you wear.

TYLER

You are not the contents of your

wallet...

JACK (V.O.)

He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't

see it till it hit you between the

eyes.

(pause)

But, it started to make sense... in

a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No

distractions.  The ability to let

that which does not matter truly

slide.

JACK

Hey.

TYLER

Hey.

TYLER

Go on in.  We're celebrating.

RICKY

You are not your job.

OTHERS TOGETHER

You are not your job.

RICKY

You are not how much money you have

in the bank.

BOB

Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

ANGEL FACE

(to Jack)

Great, thanks.

BOB

Shhhhh!  Watch!

REPORTER (V.O.)

Police Commissioner Jacobs has just

arrived... just a second... excuse

me, Commissioner, could you tell us

what you think has happened?

COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)

We believe this is related to the

recent acts of vandalism around the

city.  It's some kind of organized

group, and we are coordinating a

rigorous investigation.

JACK

What did you guys do?

BOB

The first rule of Project Mayhem

is... you do not ask questions.

CUT TO:

TYLER

Wrap it around the top of his hackie-

sack.

BOB

Man, his balls are ice cold.

TYLER

You're not going to continue your

"rigorous investigation."  You will

publicly state that there is no

underground group.  Or -- imagine,

the rest of your life with your

scrotum flapping empty.

JACOBS

(mouth taped)

... no... please, no...

TYLER

We'll send one to the New York Times

and one to the Los Angeles Times.

Press release style.  Your nuts will

be bicoastal.  Understood?  The

people you're after are everyone you

depend on.

(more)

TYLER (cont)

We do your laundry, cook your food

and serve you dinner.  We guard you

while you sleep.  We drive your

ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

JACK (V.O.)

I felt like putting a bullet between

the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't

screw to save its species.

JACK (V.O.)

I wanted to open the dump valves on

oil tankers and smother all the

French beaches I'd never see.

TYLER

Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

JACK

I felt like destroying something

beautiful.

VALET

There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport

parking, long term.

JACK

(motions to car)

After you, Mr. Durden...

TYLER

No... after you.

TYLER

Something on your mind?

JACK

No.

JACK

Why wasn't I told about "Project

Mayhem?"

TYLER

What should I have told you?

JACK

Why wasn't I involved from the

beginning?  You and I started fight

club together.

TYLER

Fight club was the beginning.  Now

it's out of the basements and there's a

name for it -- Project Mayhem.

RICKY AND MECHANIC

(together)

The first rule of Project Mayhem is

you do not ask questions.

JACK

This is as much mine as yours.

TYLER

Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it

about you and me?

JACK

You know what I mean.

TYLER

What do you want?  A statement of

purpose... ?

JACK

Look...

TYLER

Should I E-mail you?  Should I put

this on your "action item list?"

JACK

I want to know --

TYLER

What do you want to know about

Project Mayhem?

RICKY AND MECHANIC

(together)

The first rule of Project Mayhem --

JACK

(to Ricky and Mechanic)

Shut up!!

(to Tyler)

I want to know what's going on.

TYLER

This does not belong to us.  We are

not the leaders.  We are not special.

JACK

What are you doing?!

TYLER

We are the all-singing, all-dancing

crap of the world.  We are all part

of the same compost heap...

JACK

Tyler...

JACK

What the hell ... ?!

TYLER

You choose your level of involvement.

I won't make decisions for you.

JACK

I'm not asking you to.

TYLER

You're asking questions that don't

have answers.  You know just as much

about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

JACK

I don't think that's true.

JACK

Tyler... what is this... !

TYLER

What will you wish you'd done before

you died?

RICKY

Paint a self-portrait.

MECHANIC

Build a house.

TYLER

(to Jack)

And you?

JACK

I don't know!  Nothing!

TYLER

If you died right now, how would you

feel about your life?

JACK

I would feel nothing about my life?

Is that what you want to hear?!

TYLER

I want to hear the truth.

JACK

Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck

you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of

this.  How's that?

TYLER

Why do you think I blew up your condo?

JACK

What?

TYLER

Hitting bottom isn't a weekend

retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You

have to forget everything you know,

everything you think you know --

about life, about friendship, about

you and me.

JACK

Okay, okay... fine...

JACK (V.O.)

I'd never been in a car accident.

This must've been what all those

statistics felt like before I filed

them into my reports.

TYLER

We just had a near-life experience.

TYLER

In the world I see -- you're stalking

elk through the damp canyon forests

around the ruins of Rockefeller

Center.  You will wear leather

clothes that last you the rest of

your life.  You will climb the wrist-

thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears

Tower.  You will see tiny figures

pounding corn and laying-strips of

venison on the empty car pool lane of

the ruins of a superhighway.

TYLER

(leaving)

Feel better, champ.

MARLA

I'll be out of your way in a sec.

JACK

You... don't have to... leave.

MARLA

Whatever.

JACK

Really... I mean it.

(pause)

Have you been going to your groups?

MARLA

Chloe's dead.

JACK

When?

MARLA

Do you care?

JACK

I don't know.

MARLA

It was the smart move on her part.

JACK

Why are we both... caught up like

this... with... ?

JACK (V.O.)

I came so close to saying Tyler's

name, I could feel it vibrate inside

my mouth.

JACK

I don't understand.  Why does a weak

person have to go out and find a

strong person... to hang onto?

MARLA

What do you get out of it?

JACK

You hear that?

MARLA

Hear what?

JACK

That... sawing and hammering.

MARLA

Have we been talking too long?  Must

we change the subject?

TYLER

(harsh whisper)

You're not talking about me, are you?

JACK

(to Marla and Tyler)

No.

MARLA

That day you came over to my place to

play doctor... what was going on

there?

TYLER

(still a whisper)

What are you talking about?

JACK

(to Marla and Tyler)

Nothing.

MARLA

Nothing?  I don't think so.

TYLER

(whisper)

This conversation...

JACK

This conversation...

TYLER

... is over.

JACK

... is over.

MARLA

What is this?  Who did this?

JACK

... A person.

MARLA

Guy or girl?

JACK

Why would you ask if it's a guy or a

girl?!

MARLA

Why would you get bent if I asked?

JACK

Let go of me...

(pulls his hand free)

Leave me alone.

MARLA

You're afraid to say.

JACK

(calling upstairs)

Tyler... ?  What's this for?

JACK

Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

TYLER

You're too young.  Sorry.

JACK

Wait a minute...

JACK

"Too young?"

TYLER

If the applicant is young, we tell

him he's too young.  Old, too old.

Fat, too fat.

JACK

"Applicant?"

TYLER

If the applicant waits at the door

for three days without food, shelter

or encouragement, then he can enter

and begin training.

JACK

"Training?"  Tyler...

JACK

Uh, look.  You're too... young to...

train here.  You should probably be

on you way.

JACK

Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!

You will never get inside this house!

TYLER

Look, friend, I'm sorry for the

misunderstanding.  It's not the end

of the world.  Just go away.  You're

trespassing and I will call the

police.  Nothing personal.

JACK

You're never getting through this

door, you stupid little weasel!  Look

at me when I talk to you... !

JACK

What is your major malfunction!?

JACK (V.O.)

Sooner or later, we all became what

Tyler wanted us to be.

TYLER

You have two black shirts?  Two pair

black trousers?  One pair black

boots?  Two pair black socks?  One

black coat?  Three hundred dollars

personal burial money?  Go inside.

TYLER

You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're

too fat.  Nice seeing you.

JACK

Bob... Bob, wait...

(leading Bob back)

Let me explain this to you...

TYLER

A monkey, ready to be shot into

space.  A Space Monkey, ready to

sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

RICKY

(to Bob)

You're too fucking old, fatty!  We

don't want your kind here!

(to short guy)

You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!

Go back to the circus!

JACK (V.O.)

So it went...

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler built his army.

JACK (V.O.)

To what purpose, might one ask?

Well, one might ask, if not for the

first rule of Project Mayhem.

JACK (V.O.)

In Tyler We Trust.

JACK (V.O.)

And, then...

JACK

Tyler...

JACK (V.O.)

He was gone.

FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY

"You are not a beautiful and unique

snowflake.  You are the same decaying

organic matter as everything else.

We are all part of the same compost

heap."

JACK (V.O.)

Planet Tyler.

FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY

"We are the all-singing, all-dancing

crap of the world."

JACK (V.O.)

I had to hug the walls, trapped

inside this clockwork of Space

Monkeys, cooking and working and

sleeping in teams.

JACK (V.O.)

The house became a living thing, wet

inside from so many people sweating

and breathing.  So many people

moving, the house moved.

ANGEL FACE

That wouldn't interest you.

JACK

Where's Tyler?

ANGEL FACE

The first rule of Project --

JACK

Right, right.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken

Heart.

JACK

Get away from me!

MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)

Who are all these people?

JACK

The Paper Street Soap Company.

MARLA

Can I come in?

JACK

He's not here.

MARLA

What?

JACK

He's not here!  Tyler's not here

anymore!  He's gone away!

JACK

What's going on?

JACK

Bob... oh, Christ...

JACK

What... what happened... ?

MECHANIC

(out of breath)

We were on assignment...

MECHANIC (V.O.)

We were supposed to kill two birds

with one stone:

MECHANIC (V.O.)

A piece of corporate art...

MECHANIC (V.O.)

... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

MECHANIC (V.O.)

We had it all worked out, man.  It

went smooth... until...

HARSH VOICE

Police!  Freeze!

MECHANIC

They shot Bob... they shot him in the

head.  Those fuckers...

ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY

We gotta do something.

RICKY

We got to get rid of the evidence.

We have to get rid of this body.

ANGEL FACE

Bury him...

JACK

What... ?

ANGEL FACE

The garden.  Take him there.  Move,

people.  Let's do this!

JACK

No... !

JACK

Get your hands off him!  Get off...!

What the hell do you think you're

doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a

man... !  You killed him!

ANGEL FACE

He was killed in action.

JACK

No!  Look at you!  You're... you're

running around in ski masks,

exploding things...

ANGEL FACE

He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

RICKY

It's what he would have wanted, sir.

JACK

What he wanted?  Look... look at him.

Look at him!  What does he want?

(wipes tears,

points at Bob)

This is a person.  This is not a cog

in your machine...

RICKY

But, this is Project Mayhem.

JACK

No, no.  This is a man -- this man

has a name...

RICKY

But, in Project Mayhem, we have no

names.

JACK

No!  Wrong!  This man's name is

Robert Paulson.

RICKY

Robert Paulson?

JACK

Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,

because of you...

MECHANIC

I understand.

MECHANIC

In death, a member of Project Mayhem

has a name.

JACK

No -- !

MECHANIC

His name is Robert Paulson.

RICKY

His name is Robert Paulson!

JACK

No!

ALL SPACE MONKEYS

His name is Robert Paulson!

JACK

Stop that -- !

ALL SPACE MONKEYS

(louder)

His name is Robert Paulson!  His name

is Robert Paulson...

JACK

Tyler?

DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE

(from phone)

This is Detective Stern of the arson

unit.  I'd like to see you in my

office tomorrow morning...

JACK (V.O.)

I went to the cities on Tyler's used

tickets stubs.

JACK (V.O.)

In every city, I branched out from

the airport to downtown, bar-

hopping...

JACK (V.0.)

I didn't know how or why, but I could

look at fifty different bars, and

somehow I just knew...

JACK

(to driver, points)

Here.  Let me out, right here...

JACK

I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

BARTENDER

Never heard of him.

JACK

This is an emergency.  It's important

I find him.

BARTENDER

I wish I could help you... sir.

JACK (V.O.)

Every city I went to...

JACK (V.0.)

...as soon as I set foot off the

plane...

JACK (V.).)

...I knew fight club was close.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler was setting up franchises, all

over the country.

JACK

I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't

you help me?

BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

Sir, you're disturbing the other

patrons with your laudish behavior.

JACK

(pointing)

There's no one else here.

BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest

idea what you're talking about.

JACK

Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I

just need to know if you've seen

Tyler Durden.

BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such

information to you, nor would I, even

if I had said information you want,

at this juncture be able.

JACK

You are a moron.

BANDAGED PROPRIETOR

I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

JACK (V.O.)

Under and behind and inside

everything I took for granted,

something horrible had been growing.

BRUISED PATRON #1

No one's ever seen him.  No one knows

what he looks like.

BRUISED PATRON #2

He has facial reconstructive surgery

every three years.

JACK

That's the stupidest thing I've ever

heard.

BRUISED PATRON #1

Is it true about fight club in Miami?

BRUISED PATRON 12

Is Mr. Durden building an army?

JACK (V.O.)

Am I asleep... ?

JACK (V.O.)

Have I slept?  I'm not sure if Tyler

is my bad dream or if I'm Tyler's.

JACK (V.O.)

I was living in a state of perpetual

deja vu.

JACK (V.O.)

Everywhere I went, I felt I had

already been there.

KITCHEN WORKERS

His name is Robert Paulson.  His name

is Robert Paulson...

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

(from behind Jack)

Welcome back, sir.

WOUNDED BARTENDER

How have you been?

JACK

... You know me?

WOUNDED BARTENDER

Is this a test, sir?

JACK

Yes... it's a test.

WOUNDED BARTENDER

You were in here last Thursday night.

JACK

What?

WOUNDED BARTENDER

You were standing right where you are

now, asking how good our security is.

It's tight as a drum.

JACK

Who do you think I am?

WOUNDED BARTENDER

Is this part of the test?

WOUNDED BARTENDER

You're the one who did this to me.

You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

JACK (V.O.)

Please return your seatbacks to their

full upright and locked position.

MARLA

Yeah?

JACK

Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we

ever had sex?

MARLA

What kind of stupid question is

that?!

JACK

Because the answer's "yes" or because

the answer's "no?"

MARLA

Is this a trick?

JACK

Will you just answer me, for

Christsake?!

MARLA

You mean, you want to know if I think

we were just having sex or making

love?

JACK

We did make love?

MARLA

Is that what you're calling it?

JACK

Answer the question!

MARLA

You fuck me, then snub me.  You love

me, you hate me.  You show me your

sensitive side, then you turn into a

total asshole!  Is that a pretty

accurate description of our

relationship, Tyler?

JACK (V.O.)

We've just lost cabin pressure.

JACK

What did you say... ?

MARLA

What is wrong with you?

JACK

Say my name.

MARLA

What... ?

JACK

Say my name!  What's my name!?

MARLA

Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you

fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm

coming over there...

JACK

Marla, no, wait...

TYLER'S VOICE

We've got six fight clubs in Chicago

now...

TYLER

Four in Milwaukee.

JACK

What's this all about, Tyler?

TYLER

And, we're definitely filling a void

in the rural South.

JACK

Why do people think I'm you?

TYLER

You broke your promise.  You talked

to her about me.

JACK

Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

TYLER

Why did you do that?

JACK

Answer me, Tyler.

TYLER

Why do people think anything?

JACK

I don't know!  Tell me!

TYLER

People think that you're me, because

you and I happen to share the same

body.

JACK

What... ?

TYLER

Is this really news to you?

JACK

What are you talking about... ?

TYLER

Sometimes I control it, and you

imagine yourself watching me...

JACK

The first rule of fight club is --

you don't talk about fight club.

TYLER

And, sometimes you control it...

JACK

He's not here!  Tyler's not here

anymore!  He's gone away!

TYLER

You can see me and hear me, but no

one else can...

JACK

Anyone?

(thinks)

My boss, probably.

(pause)

Who would you fight?

JACK

Oh, yeah.

(nodding)

I didn't really know my Dad...

TYLER

But, when you fall asleep, I do

things without you...

TYLER

I go places without you.  Get things

done...

JACK

(shouting)

You are not your job.  You are not

how much money you have in the bank.

BRUISED MAN #1

I am not my job!

BRUISED MAN #2

I am not how much money I have in the

bank!

TYLER

There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing

from you... one simple promise.  Now

look what you've done!

JACK

This isn't possible...

TYLER

We're going to have to do something

about Marla...

JACK

What... what are you saying?

TYLER

It's okay.  We okay... a little

codependent, sure, but...

JACK

No!  This isn't true.  We... we were

around other people, together, both

of us...

TYLER

You never talked to me in front of

anyone else.

JACK

Wrong, wrong -- what about the car

crash... the two guys in the backseat?

TYLER

What about them?  They're lunatics.

JACK

You took me to the house.

TYLER

The house is rented in your name.

JACK

You have jobs.

TYLER

Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

JACK

What about Marla?

TYLER

What about Marla?

JACK

She's... you... you're fucking her.

TYLER

Um, well... technically, no.

JACK (V.O.)

It's called a "changeover."  The

movie goes on, and nobody in the

audience has any idea.

DESK CLERK

Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

JACK

Yes.

DESK CLERK

Please initial this list of phone

calls.

JACK

Bill me!

JACK

Wait...when were these made?

DESK CLERK

It says right there, sir... between

two and three-thirty this morning.

JACK

I need a copy of this.

JACK (V.O.)

Had I been going to bed earlier every

night?  Have I been sleeping later?

Has Tyler been in charge longer and

longer?

JACK

Wait here.

JACK (V.O.)

Deja vu, all over again...

VOICE

(from phone)

Eighteen-eighty-eight.

JACK

Who is this?

VOICE

Maintenance.

JACK

Listen, something is going to happen,

something terrible...

VOICE

Very good, Sir.

JACK

Excuse me?

VOICE

Don't worry about us, sir.  We're

solid.

JACK

Now wait, there's been a mix-up.

Everything's changed...

VOICE

You told me you'd say that.

JACK

Abort the plan.

VOICE

You told me you'd say that, too.

JACK

Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist

dickhead?!

VOICE

Well, sir, you said you might.

DIFFERENT VOICE

(front phone)

Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

JACK

Marla!

JACK

Marla...

MARLA

Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me

with a fucking broom.  I thought they

were going to break my arm.

JACK

I'm sorry, I...

MARLA

The were burning their fingertips

with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

JACK

Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's

going to take a tremendous act of

faith on your part for you to hear me

out.

MARLA

Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

JACK

-- A little more faith than that.

MARLA

I don't want to hear anything you've

got to say.

JACK

Give me a minute, Marla, alright...

just sixty seconds.

MARLA

Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

JACK

Absolutely, you have every right.  I

need you to do me a favor.

MARLA

I've done you enough favors.

WAITER

Sir!  Anything you order is free of

charge, sir.

MARLA

Why is it free of charge?

JACK

Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

MARLA

Then, I'll have the clam chowder...

fried chicken and a baked potato with

everything and a chocolate chiffon

pie.

JACK

Clean food, please.

WAITER

In that case, sir, may I advise

against the lady eating the clam

chowder?

JACK

Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

MARLA

You got about thirty seconds.

JACK

(takes a deep breath)

I know that I've been... unwell.  I

know it's been like there's two sides

to me.

MARLA

Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.

Jackass.

JACK

I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've

only just realized

MARLA

What?

JACK

I mean, the depth and breadth of our

relationship has only recently been

illuminated for me.  I know this...

I know us hasn't been such a great

thing for you...

MARLA

Whatever.

(to waiter)

I'll take my food to go...

JACK

Sit down!  Sit down and give me my

last fifteen seconds without opening

your mouth!

JACK

I'm trying to tell you -- and this is

where you have to trust me -- but, I

think your life might be in real

danger.

MARLA

What?

JACK

You have to get out of here.  Leave

as soon as possible.  Go to any rural

town, away from any major city...

MARLA

You are an insane person.

JACK

Marla...

MARLA

No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.

I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

MARLA

There's a part of you I really like,

but I can't do this anymore.  I just

can't.  This is killing me...

JACK

I'm sorry, but I...

MARLA

What?!  You're sorry?  I don't

believe that for a minute.

JACK

I can't explain.  You wouldn't

believe me anyway.  I'm trying to

protect you...

MARLA

Let go of me!

JACK

Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for

me, if you never do anything else...

MARLA

Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to

see you again!

JACK

Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll

never have to see me again.

(digs in his pocket)

Here... here...

JACK

Take this money, get on this bus...

(pointing to bus)

Get on, and I promise you, I'll never

bother you again, if that's what you

want.  Please...

MARLA

Tyler...

JACK

I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.

Get on the bus.

MARLA

Why are you doing this?

JACK

I can't let myself see where you're

going.  Go wherever it takes you,

remember... keep away from major

cities...

MARLA

(holds up the money)

I'm not paying this back.  I consider

it "asshole tax."

JACK

Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away

a couple of weeks, at least.

MARLA

Tyler...

MARLA

You are the worst thing that ever

happened to me.

JACK

Son of a bitch!

JACK

(loudly)

I want you to arrest me.  I'm the

leader of a terrorist organization

responsible for acts of vandalism all

over the city.  Detective Stern in

arson knows who I am...

JACK

There are probably several hundred

members in the metropolitan area.

Chapters are sprouting in at least

five other major cities.  They're

tightly-regimented, with many cells

capable of operating without a

central leader.  Check this address:

1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the

body of Robert Paulson buried in the

garden.  You'll also find numerous

tubs used to make gallons of

nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,

is to blow up these credit card

headquarters and the TRW building.

STERN

Why these buildings?

JACK

You are not your job.  You are not

how much money you have in the bank.

STERN

(to other detectives)

Keep him talking.

FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE

I really admire what you're doing.

You're a brave man to order this.

JACK

What?

REDHEAD DETECTIVE

You're a genius, sir.

BALD DETECTIVE

You know the drill.  You said if

anyone ever tries to interfere with

Project Mayhem, even you, we got to

get his balls.

FLAT-TOP

It's useless to fight.

REDHEAD

This is really a powerful gesture,

Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an

example.

JACK

No... you're making a mistake!

FLAT-TOP

You told us you'd say that.

JACK

I'm not Tyler Durden!

BALDY

You told us you'd say that, too.

JACK

Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm

ordering you to abort the mission!

FLAT-TOP

You said you would definitely say

that.

BALDY

What's our best time for a "cut and

run?"

FLAT-TOP

Four minutes.

BALDY

Is somebody timing this?

REDHEAD

(looks at his watch)

Wait till the second hand gets to the

twelve.

STERN

Some of this info checks out.  Let's

go to the place on Paper Street.

REDHEAD

(checking his watch)

Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up

the time!

TYLER

Could be worse...

TYLER

You could be standing under 37

stories of steel and concrete with a

150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped

to the support... oh, maybe it

couldn't be...

JACK

(points at bomb)

You... you can't be serious about

this.

TYLER

What a ridiculous thing to say.

JACK

I can't let you...

TYLER

...go through with this?

What are you going to do?

JACK

I'm going to...

TYLER

...stop me?

JACK

I'm not going...

TYLER

...to let this happen!

JACK

Stop finishing...

TYLER

...your sentences!  They're

our sentences.  Get your mind around

that.

TYLER

What are you doing running through

the streets in your underpants?  We

both use that body.

JACK

Since when is Project Mayhem about

murder?

TYLER

The buildings were evacuated thirty

minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding

exactly as planned.

JACK

You don't know that.  There could

still be people inside.

TYLER

Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with

shaved heads couldn't synchronize

their watches.  Good riddance.

TYLER

I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you

know which wires, in what order...

JACK

If you know, I know.

TYLER

Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I

spent the whole day thinking about

the wrong ones.

JACK

If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

TYLER

This is not about martyrdom.

JACK

I'm pulling the green wire.

TYLER

Green?  Did you say green?

JACK

Yes...

TYLER

Don't pull the green wire.  Pull

anything but the green wire.

JACK

Fuck you.

TYLER

I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

TYLER

Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in

the nick of time, eh?

TYLER

See for yourself.

MARLA

You motherfuckers...

TYLER

I've got everything.  The bombs.  The

army.  I've got Marla.

JACK

Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew

a hole in his head.  Was that part of

your plan?

TYLER

Bob was a grown man.  In any great

struggle, there will be casualties.

Wouldn't that be implicit in the

name?  Project "Mayhem."

JACK

Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

TYLER

You want out?

JACK

I quit.

TYLER

Not an option, for the most obvious

of reasons.  You need to get with the

program.

(looks at his watch)

Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

JACK

Tyler...

TYLER

(still walking away)

What?

JACK

(COCKS the gun)

Defuse the bomb.

TYLER

Ask me nicely.

JACK

Defuse the bomb, please.

TYLER

Defuse the bomb?

JACK

Yes.

JACK

Please.

TYLER

I did that for you.  As a gesture.

Now, how fast can you run?  There are

ten other bombs, in ten other

buildings in the immediate area.  If

you're going to get them all, you

better get cracking.

(looks at watch)

Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.

I'll be upstairs.

TYLER

Whoa!  What was that all about?

TYLER

Fire at will.

TYLER

What did you expect?

CUT TO:

FADE TO BLACK:

PULL BACK TO:

TYLER

One minute.

JACK (V.O.)

I think this is about where we came

in.

TYLER

(looking out window)

This is the beginning.  We're at

ground zero.  Maybe you should say a

few words, to mark the occasion.

JACK

i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

JACK

(still distorted)

I still can't think of anything.

TYLER

It's getting exciting now.

TYLER

Look what we've accomplished.

(checks watch)

Thirty seconds.

(looks out windows)

Out these windows, we will view the

economic collapse.  One step closer

to global equilibrium.  I'm glad

you're here with me.

JACK

(distorted)

Can't you call it off... ?

TYLER

It's out of our hands.

(looks at watch)

This is it.

JACK

Please...

TYLER

Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see

alright?  10... 9... 8....

TYLER

5... 4... 3... 2...

TYLER

What the fuck -- ?

JACK

Paraffin.

TYLER

What?

JACK

(relieved)

Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the

nitro with paraffin.  I saw it

floating in the bomb.

(more)

JACK (cont)

They must've run out of cotton and

Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

TYLER

Damn it!  God-damn it...

JACK

Not exactly according to plan.

TYLER

Do we have to do everything

ourselves?!

TYLER

(into WALKIE TALKIE)

... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First

Strike...

JACK

NO...

TYLER

(into WALKIE TALKIE)

Proceed with remote detonation.

TYLER

Haven't we already done this?

JACK

(pointing)

How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking

figment of my imagination... you're

psychogenic fugue state...

TYLER

Fuck that, maybe you're my

hallucination.

JACK

Oh... Christ...

JACK

Why... why... why... ?

TYLER

Why what?

JACK

Why can't I get rid of you?  Why

can't I just wish you away?

TYLER

You need me.

JACK

No, no, I don't.

(pause)

I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,

but I don't need you anymore.

TYLER

Look, I can be selfish, I know that.

(pause)

I'm not blind to my own failings...

JACK

Noooo, please...

TYLER

From now on, we'll share Marla.

We've been spending too much time

apart...

JACK

... no, no, no...

TYLER

No more running off without you.

From here on out, we do it together.

JACK

Why are you doing this?!

TYLER

I'm doing this for us.

JACK

Please understand... I've gotten all

I can from this, Tyler.

TYLER

(sullen)

If I leave, you will be right back

where I found you...

JACK

I swear on my life, I won't...

TYLER

You will.  You know you will.

TYLER

Can you live with that?

TYLER

What are you doing?

JACK

What have you left for me?

TYLER

Why do you want to do that? Why do

you want to put that gun in your

mouth?

JACK

Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

TYLER

This is interesting.

TYLER

Why are you going with this, Ikea-

boy?

JACK

It's the only way to get rid of you...

TYLER

I can see you feel very strongly.  I

feel strongly too.

(pause)

Hey, you and me.

(pause)

Friends again?

JACK

Do something for me.

TYLER

What?

JACK

Appreciate something.

TYLER

What?

JACK

Look at me...

TYLER

What?

JACK

My eyes are open.

TYLER

What's that smell... ?

TALL SPACE MONKEY

Are you all right, sir... ?!

JACK

I'm okay...

SHORT SPACE MONKEY

Are you sure?  You look terrible,

sir!  What's happened?

JACK

Everything's fine.

ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY

Sir, you look really awful!  Do you

need medical assistance?

JACK

Bring the girl to me.  The rest of

you get out.  Now!

MARLA

What happened... ?

JACK

Don't ask.

JACK

Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

MARLA

My God, you're shot...

JACK

Yes.

MARLA

Who did this to you?

JACK

I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm

fine...

JACK

I'm sorry... you met me at a very

strange time in my life.

FADE TO BLACK:
