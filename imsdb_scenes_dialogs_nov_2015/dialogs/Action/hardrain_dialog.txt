SHOOTING DRAFT

SHERIFF

So, are we all going to die?

HANK

Not right now. But I'm gonna have to

let out a little more.

PHIL

I think my best was when I turned

twelve. My Dad set up a treasure

hunt. It was really cool.

(off Wayne's disdainful

look)

Well, it was.

WAYNE

This blows.

PHIL

My most awful birthday was sweet

sixteen. I had mono. How about you?

What was your worst?

WAYNE

You kidding? You think I could've

possibly had a birthday worse than

this? What kind of loser do you think

I am?

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Don't answer that, Phil.

SHERIFF

Hank says he's gonna open another

gate. We're gonna get another rise.

MAYOR

Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday,

Wayne.

MAYOR

(to the Sheriff)

Mike, I gotta say, what you're

doing... I don't know if I'd be here,

considering.

SHERIFF

(good-natured)

Well, you would be if you wanted to

get the last couple of paychecks

some bastard owed you.

MAYOR

(grins, then:)

I just want you to know I think the

people 'round here made a big mistake.

PHIL

"The people"? You're the one who

screwed him.

MAYOR

Sorry, Phil?

PHIL

(blushes)

I, uh --

SHERIFF

(to Mayor, saving

Phil)

You know, Bob, as much as I'd love

to stand here all day talking about

how great I am, if you don't get

moving I'm gonna have to haul your

sorry ass off to jail.

MAYOR

(laughs)

Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the

good work, boys. It's appreciated.

WAYNE

Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's

house and blame it on looters. Or

how about we put a dead cow in his

living room. He comes back after

it's been in the water a couple of

days. Hello!

SHERIFF

(shakes head)

You wanna know how to get the best

revenge on the Mayor and his boys?

You do exactly what we're doing. You

protect the town. You protect it

better than they would. Better than

they ever could.

WAYNE

(thinks, shrugs)

I think the dead cow's better.

SHERIFF

(ignores Wayne)

Any looter that comes in here is in

for a big surprise, cause as long as

I'm still wearing this pointy thing...

(indicates badge)

...nobody's taking anything from

this town.

CHARLIE (O.S.)

Do you think you could go a little

faster, pal?

WELLMAN

I -- I'm going as fast as I can.

TOM (O.S.)

Well, it's not fast enough.

SECOND MAN (O.S.)

That it?

WELLMAN

Yes. We don't keep any of our --

WELLMAN

Hey, wait!

CHARLIE

Excuse me?

WELLMAN

You forgot to sign.

CHARLIE

Okay.

CHARLIE

For Christsakes!

TOM

It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna

get wet.

CHARLIE

Hey! Do you know what kind of crap

is in that water?

TOM

(of course he knows)

Well, yeah.

CHARLIE

Dispatch, this is 31.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Go ahead, 31.

CHARLIE

We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be

back in an hour.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Ten-four. Get out of there.

CHARLIE

We're gone. Over and out.

CHARLIE

What?

TOM

Your ear.

CHARLIE

What about my ear?

TOM

You've got a major hair growth going

on.

CHARLIE

Shut up.

TOM

I'm serious. You're gonna need

somebody to go in there with a weed

whacker.

CHARLIE

Here.

TOM

You're offering me one of your donuts?

I don't know what to say. I'm getting

all misty.

CHARLIE

If it'll shut your mouth you can

have the whole bag.

TOM

Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll

never get out of this truck.

CHARLIE

(disgusted)

I love how you think you're better

than this.

TOM

Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's

a lot to like about this job -- and

I don't just mean the dashing

polyester ensemble and the solid

three-figure income.

CHARLIE

(angry)

You ungrateful shit! I don't believe

you!

TOM

(surprised)

Charlie, relax! I was kidding!

CHARLIE

You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go

back to selling hot construction

machinery. That's a helluva career.

TOM

It had better hours.

CHARLIE

You think this is a joke? This is

funny? Jesus Christ! You know how

lucky you are you could get in here?

Thirty years old and all the crap

you pulled and you never got caught?

TOM

(angry)

That wasn't luck, old man. That was

skill. I was good at it.

CHARLIE

Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to

fence bulldozers. That's goddamn

genius time.

TOM

About as much skill as it takes to

sit in a truck and get fat eating

donuts.

CHARLIE

Oh, so that's all I've been doing,

huh? Just wasting my life away.

TOM

I didn't say that.

CHARLIE

Yeah, building a home, raising a

family -- that's just stupid.

TOM

I didn't say that!

CHARLIE

You know what, Tom? I really don't

give a shit what you said.

RAY

"Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters

shall rise up out of the north and

be an overflowing flood and all the

inhabitants of the land shall howl."

Jeremiah 47:2.

KENNY

You're gonna be able to buy a helluva

lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First

thing I'm gonna do is get my brother

a lawyer. Best that money can buy.

RAY

What's he facing?

KENNY

Thirty in.

RAY

He cap a cop or something...?

KENNY

Security guard. "In the commission..."

All he's got is a piece of shit P.D.

Now I'm gonna be able to afford him

a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.

JIM

'Scuse me a second. Take a look at

thirty-one across.

KENNY

Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword

puzzles.

MR. MEHLOR

I'll take a look, Jim.

JIM

Kenny can read.

(to Kenny)

Just look at it. You know when you

write down a word and suddenly it

looks all wrong? Maybe it's right,

but it doesn't look right?

JIM

Thirty-one across.

KENNY

(mumbles as he reads)

Mention money again and...

JIM

Did I get it right?

KENNY

Yeah, Jim. You got it right.

TOM

Jerk.

CHARLIE

Jack-ass.

TOM

Give us a kiss. Come on.

CHARLIE

Get out of here.

TOM

(laughs, beat)

You really are a cranky old fart,

you know that?

CHARLIE

I'm sorry.

TOM

What was that about? I mean, I'm

just sitting here and all of a sudden

you go postal on me.

CHARLIE

I don't know, I... It's just this

weather. I... I want to get back.

TOM

You know, I really do appreciate

what you've done for me. This is a

good job.

CHARLIE

No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting

your life on the line for someone

else's money.

TOM

Jesus. Where's the road?

CHARLIE

It's there.

(beat)

Somewhere. I hope.

(beat)

Look, Tom, I don't care what it is

you end up doing.

TOM

Oh, God, here we go again.

CHARLIE

This is the last time, I swear.

CHARLIE

(looks at Tom)

I just think, whatever it is you do,

it's time you did some heavy lifting.

TOM

Stop!

CHARLIE

No, you gotta hear this. You're better

than --

TOM

Stop the truck! We're going down!

CHARLIE

Jesus!

TOM

Back up!

WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.

HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.

CHARLIE

Goddammit!

TOM

It's a little dip in the road or

something. You can see the reflectors

come up the other side.

CHARLIE

(curses to himself)

I knew this would happen.

(grabs radio mike)

TOM

I'll see if there's anyone coming.

Maybe we can get pulled out.

CHARLIE

Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling

dispatch.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

(over radio)

31, this is dispatch.

CHARLIE

(into radio)

Dispatch, we're stuck outside of

Huntingburg. Truck's dead.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Where are you?

CHARLIE

We're on 231, headed for the

Interstate. Right by a sign saying

"Welcome to Huntingburg."

TOM

The town's been evacuated. We won't

get any help from there.

CHARLIE

Dispatch can't get anyone out.

TOM

They are aware we're carrying a

shitload of money...?

CHARLIE

They called the National Guard.

They're gonna be here in about ninety

minutes.

TOM

Ninety minutes? Jesus.

CHARLIE

(nods; into radio)

Dispatch, we're gonna need help a

little sooner than --

TOM

Oh, shit.

SHERIFF

(into mike)

Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

SHERIFF

Henry, I'm not leaving until you

come out.

DOREEN

Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you

to stay away from the damn window.

SHERIFF

What are you still doing here?

HENRY

We're just --

DOREEN

We're setting traps.

SHERIFF

That's illegal, Doreen.

DOREEN

You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell,

are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff?

Didn't you lose an election? I sure

as hell know I didn't vote for you,

and neither did Henry.

HENRY

Doreen...

SHERIFF

You don't need to set traps.

DOREEN

That's what they said in '73. When

we got back, anything the bastards

didn't steal they broke, just for

the hell of it.

SHERIFF

That's not happening this time.

DOREEN

Damn right it's not.

SHERIFF

You can't stay, you know that.

HENRY

We're going to my sister's.

SHERIFF

Good.

DOREEN

Soon as we finish setting the traps.

SHERIFF

God'll understand if you have to

drown her in the basement, Henry.

CHARLIE

We gotta get out of here.

TOM

What about the money?

CHARLIE

The money's safe; we're not. Water

rose about a foot in the last twenty

minutes. The National Guard isn't

going to be here for another hour.

You do the math.

CHARLIE

Hello!

MAN'S VOICE

You okay? You stuck?

CHARLIE

Yes!

MAN'S VOICE

We'll see if we can get you out!

We'll be right over!

CHARLIE

Looks like we might just --

TOM

Why'd they do that?

CHARLIE

Probably so they can see better.

TOM

Or so we can't see at all.

JIM

This is my retirement fund, boys,

and if any one of you screws up, I

swear to God I'll kill you. Let's

go.

CHARLIE

Company dispatch and the National

Guard are the only ones who know

we're here.

TOM

Anyone with a scanner from Radio

Shack could've intercepted your call,

Charlie.

CHARLIE

(realizes)

Jesus.

TOM

(to Jim and men)

Could you turn down your lights?!

JIM

We're bringing a rope!

TOM

Turn down your lights!

JIM

We'll be right there!

CHARLIE

Take it easy, Tom.

JIM

STOP SHOOTING!

JIM

Stop.

CHARLIE

I'm sorry, Tom.

KENNY

He was going for his gun!

JIM

He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny.

Goddamnit!

(shakes head, calls

to Tom)

We just want the money! Get away and

we won't have to kill you!

JIM (O.S.)

Now!

JIM

You got thirty seconds to get the

hell away!

JIM

The clock's running! Go!

JIM

(eyes Charlie)

Ah, Jesus.

(to Kenny)

Your dad'd be real proud of you,

Kenny.

KENNY

He was going for his gun!

JIM

Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna

need your science project.

RAY

"I shall bring floodwaters upon the

earth to destroy all that lives under

the heavens and every creature that

has the breath of life in it shall

perish." Genesis 6:17.

KENNY

Were you a preacher or something?

MR. MEHLOR

Ray did five years in the hole at

Joliet. The only thing you get to

read in the hole is the Bible.

KENNY

(to Ray)

You got religion?

RAY

Obviously.

MR. MEHLOR

When you hit the switch you've got

thirty seconds.

RAY

You teach your students how to make

things like that?

MR. MEHLOR

You been to a high school recently,

Ray? My students taught me how to

make things like that. Ready?

JIM

Hold on.

JIM

Shut up. Everyone.

RAY

Now why'd he have to go and do a

thing like that?

JIM

To stay alive.

(off their looks)

He thinks we'll kill him -- unless

he knows where the money is and we

don't.

MR. MEHLOR

There is another possibility.

(off their looks)

He's thinking of keeping it for

himself.

JIM

There's always that. Either way, we

got ourselves a sharp one.

KENNY

What do we do?

JIM

Pretty soon the water'll be too deep

for him to run. But for us it'll be

just deep enough.

KENNY

(unclear)

Deep enough for what?

JIM

Here we go.

KENNY

(re: cruiser)

What about this monster?

JIM

(re: ski-boat)

This is all we need.

RAY

Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we

take anything we want?

JIM

The water isn't very deep yet. We

need something with a low draft. Mr.

Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.

KENNY

Oh, Jim...?

JIM

Cut your engines!

JIM

Let's get him out. But for Godsake,

whatever you do...

(with a hard look at

Kenny)

...don't kill him. Not until we find

out where he hid that money.

JIM

Mr. Mehlor?

KENNY

Enemy sub off the port bow!

KENNY

Full steam ahead!

TOM

Low tide, sailor.

RAY

Kenny?

RAY

See him?

TOM

Yee-hah!

KENNY

(laughing)

Nice driving, buttwipe!

RAY

I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny,

but if he's dead, how do we find the

money?

JIM

Oh, he's still alive.

JIM

Ray, I'm in need of a little

inspiration.

RAY

"With a raging flood he makes an end

of those who oppose him, and pursues

his enemies into darkness." From one

of the more obscure --

KENNY

Sorry to interrupt Bible study and

all, but has no one but me noticed

how completely screwed we are? We

should be back in the motel room,

counting out the money. Instead --

JIM

No one likes this particular turn of

events, Kenny, but we have a choice --

we can can either deal with it or we

can walk away. There's a lot of money

out there, so I choose to deal with

it. If you want to go, that's fine --

start swimming. You want to stay,

that's fine, too -- just stop your

damn whining.

KENNY

What the hell's his problem? All the

money in the world ain't worth a

goddamn nickel if you get caught.

It's not like there won't be other

jobs.

RAY

You may have more of these in you,

Kenny, but Jim doesn't.

SHERIFF (O.S.)

What are you doing here?

KAREN

I was setting up pumps.

WAYNE

I sure as hell don't get what you

see in that church.

KAREN

I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.

WAYNE

What's that supposed to mean?

SHERIFF

Karen, did you think the order was

for everyone but you to evacuate?

KAREN

I was gonna go as soon as I filled

the pumps, but the next thing I know,

I've got a looter on my hands. Now,

maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting

a little gratitude?

PHIL

I think it's great what you did.

WAYNE

That's it, Phil. That'll finally get

you into her pants.

PHIL

Shut up.

SHERIFF

What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot

of these looters carry guns.

TOM (O.S.)

I'm not a looter.

RAY

Jim, it could be anywhere. It might

not even be in the school.

JIM

Keep looking.

WAYNE

What were you doing at the church?

KAREN

I told you -- he was looting it.

TOM

I just said I'm not a looter!

(to Karen)

You're the one who nailed me?

(Karen nods)

You got a better arm than my ex-wife.

What the hell did you hit me with --

a statue? I saw a flash of some guy

coming at me.

KAREN

(mumbles, embarrassed)

It was a crucifix.

(to others)

It was the only thing there!

TOM

Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people

coming from around the world to see

the face of Jesus on my forehead.

SHERIFF

Look, son, what were you doing in

the church?

TOM

Looking for a place to hide out.

WAYNE

From who -- Swamp Thing?

TOM

The bastards who killed my partner.

TOM

We were driving an armored truck.

The truck got stuck out past the

high school. They must've picked up

our call to dispatch, 'cause they

knew where we were. Charlie and I

were just standing there and all

hell broke loose.

SHERIFF

How much money did you have?

TOM

A little over three million.

TOM

The bank was afraid of looters. They

had us cleaning out their branches

up and down the river.

WAYNE

They stole three million dollars?

SHERIFF

No, I don't think so.

SHERIFF

You took the money, didn't you.

TOM

I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to

a crypt for a guy named Portman.

WAYNE

What the hell'd you do that for?

TOM

I don't like to carry around that

much cash.

SHERIFF

Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he

hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed

him, too.

SHERIFF

You got any ID?

TOM

No, it was in my jacket and I --

WAYNE

Color me surprised.

SHERIFF

Get out two rifles and a shotgun.

WAYNE

You believe him?

SHERIFF

Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if

I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell

had an obligation to check it out,

don't you think?

TOM

I'll go with you. I can show you

where --

SHERIFF

No, I think you better stay put. But

that was --

WAYNE

Yeah, all we need is an armored car

guy helping us out.

WAYNE

Ow!

SHERIFF

Wayne, what's the worst that's ever

happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan

went after you with a knife? This

guy just got shot at!

(dismisses Wayne; to

Tom)

Smart move with the money.

SHERIFF

(to Phil)

Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery.

You escort Slugger...

(nods at Karen)

...out of town. Get her to some high

ground, then come on back.

KAREN

I have to fill the pumps --

SHERIFF

(pulling her out)

Not any more you don't.

SHERIFF

Wayne...

WAYNE

He could still be lying!

TOM

Sheriff -- they killed my partner

without any warning.

SHERIFF

And they're gonna regret that, I

guarantee you. They're gonna regret

coming anywhere near this town

tonight. And out he goes.

SHERIFF

Phil, take Karen's boat.

WAYNE

You can do it, Phil. The men of

Huntingburg are counting on you.

PHIL

Just bite me.

HANK

Holy shit!

HANK

Sheriff! Sheriff!

HANK

(on the radio)

Sheriff, come in!

KAREN

(pleading)

Did you see the stained glass windows,

Phil? Did you see what a good job

they did? I can't let anything happen

to the church, not after all I've

put into it.

PHIL

Karen, you know I'd do anything for

you, but the Sheriff told me to get

you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for

your own good.

PHIL

What're you doing?

KAREN

If you're not going to take me back

to the church, then I'll swim.

PHIL

No. Hey, hold on.

KAREN

What am I saying?

KAREN

This is my boat. You swim.

KAREN

They'll get him out.

SHERIFF

Wayne... You locked him in.

TOM

Great! I can drive out of here!

TOM

Thank you.

KAREN

I owed you -- for hitting you and

all. But we're even now, okay?

TOM

Even.

(beat, looks around)

What happened?

KAREN

I don't know.

KAREN

Maybe another levee broke upriver.

They've been --

TOM

Oh, God.

JIM

They're in the water! Kenny, cut

your engine!

JIM

Kenny, go that way. We'll go down

here.

KAREN

Tell them where the money is.

TOM

I can't.

KAREN

Well, I can.

TOM

If they know where the money is,

they will kill us.

KAREN

So what do we do?

TOM

I guess just drive around until we

run out of gas.

KAREN

(pissed)

Look, I've spent the last eight months

of my life restoring that church,

and I just left it to come save your

ass, so spare me, okay?

TOM

(beat)

When we get down here a little further

we'll find a place for you to hide.

(off her look)

I'm gonna get back to the truck and

wait for the National Guard.

(checks watch)

They should be there pretty soon.

TOM

Cold?

KAREN

No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked

in.

SHERIFF (O.S.)

Is he dead?

PHIL

No. Someone got him out.

SHERIFF

Who?

PHIL

(hesitates)

Maybe Karen.

WAYNE

Karen? How could she get him out?

You took her out of town.

PHIL

I -- It --

SHERIFF

Let's hear it, Phil.

PHIL

It happened real fast, okay?

KAREN

You ever been robbed before?

TOM

No. The scariest thing that ever

happened before was Charlie running

out of donuts.

(off her look)

I've only been doing this for a couple

months.

KAREN

(not what she wanted

to hear)

Oh.

KAREN

What'd you do before this?

TOM

I, uh... I sold construction

machinery.

(off her look)

I was making good money, it just...

I don't know. It just didn't seem

right for me anymore.

KAREN

How'd you end up in this?

TOM

My uncle did me a favor; got me in.

KAREN

Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after

tonight?

TOM

My uncle was Charlie -- my partner

in the truck.

KAREN

Oh, God. I'm sorry.

WAYNE

She know karate or something, Phil?

Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see

how else she could overpower the

likes of you.

PHIL

Shut up, Wayne.

SHERIFF

Shut up, both of you. Let's go find

Karen; see if she's got him.

TOM

God, I wonder whose car this is.

KAREN

Well, whoever it is, he listens to

Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the

soundtrack to "Footloose."

TOM

Really?

(looks at tapes)

Hold on...

(looks around car)

...I think this is my car from high

school.

TOM

Looks like we get out here.

(Karen hesitates)

Come on -- I told your father I'd

have you home by ten.

TOM

There!

TOM

Get your feet up!

TOM

Oh, shit!

KAREN

What?

TOM

(re: antenna/ladder)

It's metal!

TOM

We've gotta --!

KENNY

HEY! I GOT HIM!

TOM

We have to --!

KENNY

I GOT HIM!

KAREN

Hurry!

TOM

Jesus Christ!

WOMAN (O.S.)

You so much as breathe funny and

your head is going back out that

window without you.

MR. MEHLOR

Jim! Over there!

DOREEN

Real slow now. Like you were in a

big jar of molasses. That's it.

MAN (O.S.)

Doreen? You haven't killed anybody,

have you?

DOREEN

I've got everything under control,

Henry. You go back up.

HENRY

Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole

gang.

KENNY

Jesus, God, it hurts!

JIM

You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor

knows these things and he thinks

you're gonna be okay.

KENNY

It hurts!

JIM

Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you

think Kenny's gonna be okay?

MR. MEHLOR

Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.

KENNY

Jesus, I can't stop shivering.

KENNY

I know you didn't want me to come.

JIM

You kidding? We couldn't've done

anything without you.

KENNY

My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?

JIM

Your dad'd just want you to lay still

while we got you some help.

KENNY

Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.

(relief)

Oh, man.

KENNY

When you said I was gonna be okay, I

thought you were just shittin' me.

JIM

See? You gotta trust me.

DOREEN

(sarcastic)

Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now

these bastards are gonna want to

kill us, too! Why the hell did you

have to come to this house?

KAREN

We thought it was empty.

DOREEN

You know what? The house next door

is empty. So whaddya say we go back

downstairs and you two keep moving?

HENRY

We are not going to send these people

out to the wolves.

DOREEN

Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's

your plan, General Schwartzkopf?

HENRY

I -- I just don't think --

TOM

It's okay. I have to go anyway.

TOM

The National Guard'll be at the truck

in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna

go wait for them.

DOREEN

You can't swim that far in fifteen

minutes.

HENRY

He could take our boat.

DOREEN

Henry!

HENRY

(to Tom)

I'll go get it ready for you.

DOREEN

Henry, he is not taking our boat.

DOREEN

(grabs TV; to Tom)

Here. You want a TV too? How about

some china? Maybe our silver?

(sets TV down)

Henry! Henry, you leave the boat

where it is!

TOM

Karen?

(she looks at him)

I'm Tom.

KAREN

Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't

wanna have to save your life again.

DOREEN

You give away our only boat in the

middle of a flood. You are a genius,

Henry. A goddamn genius.

TOM

(whispers to Henry,

re: Doreen)

You wanna come with me?

DOREEN

Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting

for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in

here.

RAY

Why don't we just get him?

JIM

If our resourceful young friend hears

us coming, he'll electrocute us or

sink us or one of you'll shoot him.

Besides...

(glances at watch)

...I know where he's going. What I'd

like to know is where he came from.

WAYNE

They're not here.

JIM

(yelling)

Son, before you go underwater and do

something tricky, there's something

I'd like you to see!

JIM

Now, I know it's your job to protect

that money, and maybe you'd even be

foolish enough to give your life for

it. The question is, are you willing

to give their lives for it?

JIM

Drop the gun and get into the boat.

JIM

Excellent choice.

TOM

I'll take you to the money, but you

gotta let them go.

DOREEN

I hope you're proud of yourself,

Henry Sears.

HENRY

Shh.

JIM

I think it'd be best if --

DOREEN

I told you not to give him the goddamn

boat.

HENRY

Doreen, please.

JIM

I think it'd be best if we all stayed

together.

TOM

You say all you want is the money?

Prove it. Let them go.

JIM

I don't know if that's --

DOREEN

We could be safe in our home instead

of out here in a boat with these low-

life scumbags!

JIM

(after a look at

Doreen, nods to Mr.

Mehlor)

Let 'em go.

TOM

(whisper)

Karen?

HENRY

(shakes head, whispers)

In the attic. They never saw her.

DOREEN

(disappearing in dark)

Faster, Henry! The bastards might

change their minds! Stop lily- dipping

and move it!

DOREEN

What're you doing?

HENRY

I'm gonna row back there and see if

he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either

way.

DOREEN

Henry...?

HENRY

Do you want me to get us out of here?

DOREEN

Yes, of course, I --

HENRY

Then shut the fuck up.

TOM

I...

JIM

The only thing I want to hear from

you is where the money is.

JIM

I wonder where they think they're

going.

RAY

What the hell's going on?

MR. MEHLOR

This happened in a flood in Georgia.

The ground gets soggy, and the caskets

are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't

been planted too long just pops up.

RAY

You teach your students stuff like

that? No wonder they kicked you out.

MR. MEHLOR

I didn't teach my students anything

at all.

JIM

(to Tom)

Where is it?

TOM

It's hard to tell now with the water

so deep.

TOM

It's down there a little further.

KAREN

Tom went off in their rowboat.

WAYNE

(to Phil)

It's Tom now. Looks like you lost

out, pal.

SHERIFF

Where was he going?

KAREN

Back to the armored truck.

JIM

Here?

TOM

Uh... no. A little farther --

JIM

They're not coming, son.

TOM

What?

JIM

The National Guard. They're not

coming.

TOM

I don't --

JIM

I know you've been trying to stall

until they show up, but they're not

coming.

TOM

(pause as he realizes)

Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's

call, then you called them off.

JIM

No, son, I didn't call them off.

They never were coming. We didn't

"intercept" Charlie's call. He called

us direct.

HANK

I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I

can't leave! If the water goes over

the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-

bye, town! In fact, I could use a

little help up here myself.

SHERIFF

Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed

up in Jack Finch's barn and said he

was gonna burn it down?

HANK

Hey, I was the one who got the dumb

son-of-a-bitch to come out.

SHERIFF

Right. And before you went in, I

deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-

bitch! So when I say get down here,

it's not a request, it's an order.

So get down here! Now! I won't need

you for long. And bring your gun.

JIM

We were gonna hit you just before

you got on the Interstate, but then

you got stuck so we had to change

our plans and take you --

TOM

Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

JIM

I knew Charlie when we were both

working construction for the Johnstown

company. His middle name was McCarthy

because his parents loved Charlie

McCarthy on the radio. His wife's

name was Mary. She died of a heart-

attack last year. He has a daughter

and a son, both grown with children

of their own. I'm afraid I don't

know the names of the grandchildren.

JIM

What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I

know Uncle Charlie was trying to

steer his favorite nephew away from

a life of crime.

TOM

Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie

and you get to keep another share?

JIM

No, That was an accident. Ken shot

him.

(eyes Kenny sadly)

I never told him Charlie was on my

side. Ken liked to talk.

(shakes head)

He shouldn't've been here. But his

dad asked me to watch over him. I

guess I didn't do the best job.

RAY

Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt

and all, but could we just get the

money and get the hell out of here?

JIM

(nods; to Tom)

I'm gonna ask you one more time. And

before you think of bullshitting me

again, keep in mind I have had a

very frustrating night. And while I

know I'll never get the money if I

kill you, it's getting to the point

where I just don't care.

TOM

I'll tell you where it is. But it's

not going to do you any good.

TOM

The Guard may not be coming, but

someone else sure as hell is.

JIM

I'll take my chances.

TOM

There.

JIM

Well, go get it.

RAY

(eyeing Tom in water)

"At night we'd go down to the river

and into the river we'd dive."

(off Jim and Mehlor's

looks)

Springsteen, "The River." I'm all

out of bible quotes.

TOM

It's gone.

JIM

What?

TOM

(smug)

Looks like somebody beat you to it.

RAY

Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot

him, Jim.

KAREN

Stop! You'll hit Tom!

SHERIFF

Hold your fire!

JIM

(to Sheriff)

Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love

nothing more than to shoot me, but I

caution you -- in order to do that,

you're gonna have to shoot through

young Tom here.

SHERIFF

Okay.

TOM

Well, that was unexpected.

JIM

Is he the one you thought was coming

to your rescue?

HANK (O.S.)

Anyone mind telling me what the hell

is going on?

SHERIFF

Hey, Hank. That money I told you

about? From the armored car? We're

gonna keep it. Three million dollars.

Four ways.

(shoots at crypt)

Seven fifty apiece. You okay with

that?

SHERIFF

Hank? You okay with that?

HANK

Seven hundred and fifty thousand

dollars?

(beat, grins)

Damn straight I'm okay with that.

WAYNE

(grumbling, re: Hank)

Don't see what we needed him for.

SHERIFF

Then I guess you've never been hunting

with Hank.

(to Hank)

We got two behind that crypt. Get

'em.

PHIL

Maybe I'm not okay with it.

SHERIFF

Come on now, Phil.

PHIL

You're gonna kill people?

SHERIFF

They're looters, Phil! They come and

steal from an armored truck in our

town -- they're looters.

(fires two shots)

PHIL

What about Tom? What about Karen?

They're not looters.

SHERIFF

No, they're witnesses.

PHIL

How can you do this?

SHERIFF

Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne

was the stupid one. Read my lips.

(slowly)

Three million dollars. Look at it!

SHERIFF

A couple of those bags are gonna be

yours, Phil.

PHIL

But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!

SHERIFF

I'm the what?

PHIL

For twenty years you've been --

SHERIFF

For twenty years I've been eating

shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Well, tonight I'm changing the menu!

From now on everything I eat is gonna

be shit-free!

SHERIFF

Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do

you want me to draw pictures?

PHIL

I can't let you do it.

SHERIFF

Oh for --

(beat)

Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna

go. I'm gonna hear one of two things

out of you. Either I'm gonna hear

you say you're in with us, or...

(moves close to Phil's

gun)

...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out

of that gun and go into me.

SHERIFF

(one hand)

Seven hundred and fifty thousand

dollars or...

(other hand)

...you kill me. Your choice.

SHERIFF

There we go.

WAYNE (O.S.)

In the boat!

TOM

(beat, looks up at

Jim)

You really want that money?

TOM

'Cause the only way you're ever gonna

see it is if you help me get Karen.

TOM

We're too slow.

JIM

(thinks, then:)

Here.

TOM

They're not going to catch us now.

TOM

Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch

us now.

TOM

That hurt?

JIM

Yeah.

TOM

Good.

SHERIFF

(nods, to Hank)

Then go get some bottles.

PHIL

(to Hank)

Wait -- what about the dam?

SHERIFF

It'll be fine.

PHIL

You said if it goes it'll wipe out

the town.

SHERIFF

Fuck the town.

JIM

Does he have the girl?

TOM

(shakes head)

She's in the small boat.

TOM

Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.

JIM

Hepatitis, hell. You probably already

got cholera.

JIM

What're you doing?

TOM

There's a back room.

(touches wound)

Maybe they've got something I can

use on this.

JIM

You been in here before?

TOM

(bad memory)

Oh, yeah.

JIM

What happened?

TOM

I saw Jesus.

TOM

So, has this all gone pretty much

how you thought it would?

JIM

Everything would have gone fine if

you'd've just walked away from the

truck.

TOM

Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've

gone even better if you hadn't decided

to rob the damn truck in the first

place!

TOM

Did Charlie have cancer or something?

JIM

You mean why was he doing this?

(thinks, shrugs)

No cancer.

(beat)

Didn't you ever think about taking

the money?

TOM

No.

JIM

Come now. A man who used to make his

living fencing hot jackhammers never

thought about what he'd do with three

million dollars?

TOM

Sorry to disappoint you.

(beat)

What are you gonna do with it?

JIM

As little as possible.

TOM

Belize.

TOM

It's this small country in Central

America, on the Atlantic side.

JIM

I know where Belize is. What about

it?

TOM

They speak English and the dollar

goes a long way. Beautiful beaches;

friendly people. And they've got

liberal banking laws. Very liberal.

JIM

No, you didn't think about taking

that money at all.

TOM

(busted)

You can't ride in the truck and not

think about it.

JIM

I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty

much how it started with Charlie.

SHERIFF

What're you doing?

WAYNE

We got too many bodies with bullets

in 'em.

(nods at Karen)

I'm gonna put her in her house, make

it look like she fell down the stairs

and drowned.

PHIL

Don't you touch her!

WAYNE

Saving her life... Hmm... You know,

that might have actually gotten you

laid.

SHERIFF

Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her

here.

WAYNE

We got a few minutes before Hank

gets back.

SHERIFF

Just dump her here!

SHERIFF

Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get

them outta there! Wayne!

TOM

Shit. Where's he going?

HANK

Where's Wayne going?

SHERIFF

On a date. You all set?

HANK

Yeah, but --

SHERIFF

Then let's go.

HANK

Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?

SHERIFF

We can get started without him, the

dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides,

we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his

money on this, aren't you Phil?

JIM

What -- you're gonna swim after her?

JIM

You ain't gonna help her by getting

shot. He's gone and you don't know

where.

TOM

The Sheriff knows. I think maybe

I'll go ask him.

JIM

You'll be dead before you get over

the sandbags.

(beat)

Look, he'll be coming for us. You

can ask him then.

TOM

What if he doesn't come?

JIM

I wouldn't worry about that.

WAYNE

Wakey-wakey.

WAYNE

Dear Penthouse: I always thought

your letters were fake, until the

wildest thing happened to me. I'm a

policeman in a small town. In the

middle of the big flood last year, I

was patrolling the streets in a boat,

feeling kind of sorry for myself --

'cause it was my birthday and all --

when I saw the front door to a house

was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid

it might be looters. Imagine my

surprise when, instead of a looter,

I find a young woman handcuffed to

the railing of her stairs. Her name

was Karen, and ever since she came

back from college she'd made it clear

she was too good for any of us local

folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs!

I said, "What the heck is going on

here, ma'am?" And she said...

WAYNE

And she said...

KAREN

Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a

part in your sick little play.

WAYNE

You're perfect for the role. I suggest

you reconsider.

KAREN

Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna

do that anyway.

WAYNE

I might get clumsy. It might take a

while.

KAREN

I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's

all going to be the same when I'm

dead.

WAYNE

And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne.

I've got something for you." Well,

I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted

to give me and I knew she wanted to

give it bad, so I --

WAYNE

(looks up at light)

That won't do. Man's gotta see what

he's doing. 'Scuse me.

WAYNE

I got the candles. All's we need is

a cake.

WAYNE

Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?

(no answer from Karen;

back into Penthouse

letter)

And then she said, "My present's

ready and waiting. All's you gotta

do is unwrap it."

WAYNE

It was cold and rainy that birthday

night, and all I wanted was to get

someplace warm and dry. As it turned

out, what I really wanted was

something warm and wet. Wayne grins

and closes for a kiss and...

KAREN

Happy Birthday, Wayne.

SHERIFF

They're not coming out, Hank!

HANK

The fire's not catching. The rain's

too --

SHERIFF

We have to get them! We have to kill

them! Do you understand? If they're

not dead, we got jack shit!

TOM

My God they're beautiful.

KAREN

There have to be keys. There --

SHERIFF

Where are they?! Jesus!

SHERIFF

You take care of him!

HANK

(to Phil)

Kill him!

HANK

Kill him!

PHIL

No! We can't --

JIM

In the boat.

TOM

Where's Karen?

KAREN

God, I am really beginning to hate

fine craftsmanship.

TOM

Where is she?

SHERIFF

They went back to her house.

TOM

Where's her house?

SHERIFF

It's --

JIM

What in God's name is that?

SHERIFF

Hank?

HANK

(woozy but okay)

It's topped out.

SHERIFF

How much time we got?

HANK

How should I know?

SHERIFF

Guess!

HANK

It's an old dam! Not long.

SHERIFF

(to Tom)

Then I'd say you boys better drop

your guns.

TOM

What?

SHERIFF

That's the deal! You let me and Hank

go -- with a few of these bags --

and I'll tell you where to find Karen.

JIM

(to the Sheriff)

Get out of the boat.

TOM

Hold on.

JIM

Hold on?

SHERIFF

It's the only way you're gonna find

her!

TOM

It's only a couple of bags.

JIM

No.

TOM

But I thought --

JIM

Look, I don't know what you thought

but I told you, I'm here for the

money; that's all.

PHIL (O.S.)

She lives on Boyd Street.

PHIL

Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.

SHERIFF

So, you just gonna kill me?

JIM

Lord knows I should.

TOM

I'm guessing you can't get up.

KAREN

I'm handcuffed.

KAREN

The railing's bolted to the wall.

KAREN

I've got a saw.

TOM

Where?

KAREN

In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard

beside the --

TOM

Is that good or bad?

SHERIFF

You should've just killed me.

KAREN

You gotta go!

KAREN

The dam's gone! You gotta go!

TOM

(shakes head)

I owe you one.

PHIL

NOOOO!

HANK

We gotta go faster!

SHERIFF

Yeah, you're right.

HANK

Oh my God.

DOREEN

Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to

the light" crap. Come back to me.

You're all I've got.

DOREEN

Oh, Henry. Thank God.

HENRY

Next time, when I say "Let's

evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.

DOREEN

Whatever you say, honey.

KAREN

No! No!

TOM

You okay?

JIM

Fine.

TOM

Oh, God. We gotta get you to --

TOM

Thanks.

JIM

For what?

TOM

You just saved our lives.

JIM

I did? I just came for the money.

KAREN (O.S.)

Do you need any help?

JIM

(grabs Tom's arm)

No. Tell her to stay back.

TOM

(to Karen)

It's okay!

JIM

You're going to turn it in?

TOM

Sorry to disappoint you.

JIM

Well, hell, then I guess I better

take it after all. I figure the

river'll carry me down to the Gulf

of Mexico. If I catch the right

currents, maybe I'll end up in...

Belize?

(Tom nods)

You come look me up. I'll buy you a

drink.

TOM

I'll do that.

JIM

Go.

JIM

Please.

JIM

Son, don't think too badly of your

Uncle Charlie. He always said you

were capable of remarkable things.

(beat)

He was right.

JIM

(smiles)

The rain's stopped.

(breathes deep)

The air after a rain...

MATCH CUT TO:

TOM

They got a lot done today.

KAREN

It's coming along.

(re: bag)

What'd you get?

TOM

Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.

KAREN

Yum.

TOM

You want some? I wish you'd told me.

I woulda got more.

KAREN

Ha ha.

TOM

I talked to Mikey. He says the

flooring should be in by Friday.

KAREN

That's what he said last week.

TOM

I said if it wasn't here by Friday

at six that you were going to go

over and beat the crap out of him.

KAREN

And I will.

FADE OUT:

THE END
