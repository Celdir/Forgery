Some   of   them   want   to   use you

Some   of   them   want   to   get used by you

Some   of   them   want   to   abuse you

Some   of   them   want   to   be abused

- Eurythmics

Some years from this exact moment...

1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1

DARKNESS - NOW

The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the

COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.

They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS

FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding

into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's

dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track

and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and

hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-

eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.

ZERO IN on TWO:

KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes

burning with internalized emotion...

... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -

both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported

through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.

Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their

swagger seems to mask FEAR.

KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL

makes eye contact w/ him.

SANDRA

Sandra.

KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.

SANDRA (cont'd)

My name is Sandra.

GUARD

Shut the fuck up.

Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with

a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!

KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings

again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.

SANDRA

(to the GUARD, a snarl)

Putcher dick away...

GUARD

Get some.

CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled

over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,

head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,

every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...

He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights

through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle

herself.

The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a

glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing

it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the

others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -

growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting

out all thought... until...

2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2

POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL

towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...

NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound

of his boots bouncing off the concrete...

Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the

tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,

sky...

Our POV WHITES OUT as we...

3   EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS                                        3

... smash into the DAYLIGHT.

Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over

burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers

disappear into the grey mist.

4   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                            4

KABLE emerges from the smoke into...

... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out

of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an

OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella

2005).

In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -

accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce

somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,

then snap into place. GO TIME.

5   OTHER SPAWN POINTS                                                  5

Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and

INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.

6   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                             6

What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a

closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like

hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits

apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they

hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.

7   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER                                     7

KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES

COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade

away... until...

NOTHING.   DEAD QUIET.

SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN

we hear a GUNSHOT.

Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -

after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the

lightning, wait for the thunder.

In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from

behind an old car to a brick staircase.   Then another BLUE

runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.

BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...

BOOM.

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...

KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly

shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE

into the mist:

THOOM! THOOM!   The shells puncture air and connect

distantly...

The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he

breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS

READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic

fire.

8   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET                                8

A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally

IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut

and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM

holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.

From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE

combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner

of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat

transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to

your own reflection on a TV).

We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.

KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the

third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND

SPEAKERS, behind us:

A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be

outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly

belong to KABLE.

VOICE (O.S.)

(clean, disconnected)

Eat shit please.

THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts

back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.

Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.

A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a

bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem

almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his

left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting

the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT

TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some

clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the

ground, dead.

Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on

him. Uh oh...

BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the

knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing

straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles

over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.

The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and

bone TRIPOD.

Ken Castle, society took the world

Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a

new simulation - one that would

take gaming to new heights of

thrilling excess... and controversy

- SLAYERS.

SLAYERS would let us die thru

Gina, when was the last time you

murdered? I'm sure you know that

every last one of our Slayers is a

bona fide death row inmate -

(points for emphasis)

...each one offered a chance to

participate as an alternative to

their sentence. Stay alive for

thirty sessions and get set free...

that's not a bad God damned deal.

I'd remind your audience that

Slayers was put together with the

full cooperation and approval of

the United States federal

government... that the revenue it

produces is responsible for funding

our entire prison system - keeping

the bad guys behind bars... and

that the prop was voted for by a

cock solid 68% of the American

public.

let's talk about the so-called

generi-cons.

GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd)

Sent into the slayers environment

with a set of pre-programmed

actions, with no way to react and

no one controlling them - their

chances of survival are next to

nil.

KEN CASTLE

There's a lot of men and women in

prison that could never cut it as

slayers... shouldn't they have the

same opportunity to roll the dice

for a ticket out? Besides - they

only need to survive one session.

GINA PARKER SMITH

Mr. Castle - how the hell does it

work?

KEN CASTLE

Simple.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

It begins with a single nano-cell

planted in the motor cortex of the

brain -- this cell can replicate,

replacing the cells `round it with

perfect copies...

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

... these copied cells contain

remote access functionality.

Therefore, nano plus cortex equals

the nanex.

recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s,

long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK,

CLACK...

They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear

to notice KABLE.

HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank           WINNER.

HUMANZ BROTHER

You a fool.

HUMANZ DUDE

Stop playing that freaky shit off

the rail.

HUMANZ BROTHER

It's a game of deception.

HUMANZ DUDE

Whatever, that's cuz you got no

power...

HUMANZ DUDE measures a shot, rolling the paddle with one

finger - then LETS IT RIP - slamming the GAME WINNER in a

STRAIGHT LINE past HUMANZ BROTHER'S frozen paddle - SCORE: 7-

5.

HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)

(getting in his face)

Huh? What?

HUMANZ BROTHER

Bullshit.

KABLE

You guys suck.

They turn, suddenly aware of him. HUMANZ DUDE'S paddle hand

goes limp; the puck limps in and scores, meaninglessly.

HUMANZ DUDE

(impressed)

Kable. Holy shit.

HUMANZ BROTHER

His name's Tillman.

HUMANZ DUDE

Whatever.

(to KABLE)

You made it. You're really here.

KABLE looks them over - he's not sure what he expected, but

it wasn't this.

KABLE

You're the ones who broke me out?

TRACE

We only freed your mind.

HUMANZ BROTHER

Your ass followed.

HUMANZ DUDE

Hey, Kable...

DUDE seems to be the most affected by KABLE'S presence -

BROTHER is calm, in the moment; TRACE is focused, all

business... DUDE is pure FANBOY.

HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)

You're... great.

HUMANZ BROTHER gives HUMANZ DUDE a look and shakes his head.

HUMANZ BROTHER

(to Kable)

You got questions.

KABLE

A few.

He glances over at TRACE.

KABLE (cont'd)

She took my blood. Why?

HUMANZ DUDE

The nanex modifies the actual cell

structure of your brain...

HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)

we can crack it, but it's not one

size fits all; we needed your DNA

to generate custom code.

KABLE

Alright.    Why me?

HUMANZ DUDE

Because Castle's scared of you.

HUMANZ BROTHER

It ain't just a game, you know,

Tillman. Everyday there's more

people steppin forward, wanna be a

part of Castle's world. Throwing

away everything it means to be

human.

TRACE

Right now it's the desperate

ones... convicts, addicts... the

sick, the poor... the ones that

fell through the cracks... they

have no choice.

HUMANZ DUDE

But this is only the beginning.

HUMANZ BROTHER

Think about it: the federal prison

system is growing out of control,

set to bankrupt the whole damn

USA... Castle rides in on a white

horse, says he got a plan to bail

us out and everyone just fall in

line.

TRACE

So what's next? The health care

system is collapsing - Castle comes

to the rescue again...

HUMANZ BROTHER

This time he's pushin total control

of genetic disease... birth defects

a thing of the past... all we gotta

do is exchange our cells for the

ones he wanna give us.

TRACE

The promise of a longer life and a

fatter wallet - you think people

will refuse?

Hell no.

HUMANZ BROTHER

They'll be standing in line to hand

their babies over to him. Next

thing you know, we all slaves.

TRACE

We can't let that happen.

HUMANZ DUDE

Gotta bring the man down.

TRACE

You can help us, Tillman.

(with urgency)

You have to help us.

KABLE takes this in, and starts to WALK AWAY.

KABLE

I can't help you.

HUMANZ BROTHER

Tillman.

KABLE ignores him - he's OUT.        But HUMANZ BROTHER FREEZES him

in his tracks:

We know where she is.

118   INT. FBI INTERROGATION - TIME INDETERMINATE                         118

SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his

fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Trying

not to show how scared he is.

The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only

see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup.

The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to

SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can

manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being

interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.

When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational.

AGENT KEITH

Guess you remember that day.

SIMON nods, noncommitally.

AGENT KEITH (cont'd)

You'd just gotten Kable through his

tenth consecutive session alive...

no one ever thought an I-con could

last that long.

Another photo shows SIMON on a JUMBOTRON posing with his

fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control

hand signal for FIRE and KILL... in another, he's being

mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts with a

black marker.

AGENT KEITH (cont'd)

Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King

Player.

SIMON

Good times.

AGENT KEITH

Sure. On the outside.        Now look at

these.

A new series of graphic photos show bloody, mangled remains -

the aftermath of a slayers session.

AGENT KEITH (cont'd)

This is what it's like on the

inside.

(beat)

Wonder how long you'd last on the

other side of the screen.

This SITS IN THE ROOM for a BEAT - SIMON considers several

responses, chooses NONE OF THEM.

AGENT KEITH (cont'd)

Simon, you're being held today

suspected of aiding in the escape

of a convicted murderer from a

maximum security penitentiary. The

charge is... beyond serious. Your

hard drives have been seized -

forensics is decrypting the

contents as we speak. Your

internet activity over the last ten

years is being scrutinized and

catalogued in minute, vivid

detail...

SIMON FLINCHES at this one.

AGENT KEITH (cont'd)

In addition, your father's bank

accounts have been frozen pending

further investigation - naturally,

seeing it was his money that

essentially funded Mr. Tillman's

escape.

I'm going to need you to tell me

everything that happened leading up

to yesterday afternoon. Everyone

you talked to, everything you

heard, everything you did. I need

you to do that... right now.

SIMON

Yeah, um... I need something too.

AGENT KEITH

(ice cold)

Do you now? And what might that be?

SIMON swallows hard.

SIMON

Could you dudes do a sandwich like:

peanut butter, almond butter,

walnut butter... pecan butter,

pistachio butter... pretty much any

kind of, you know, nut butter. And

Welch's grape.

Dead silence. SIMON chews a HANGING CHAD off of a FINGERNAIL.

AGENT KEITH

Pistachio. They make that?

SIMON

It's awesome.

GORGE scrolls through options... hair, clothes, makeup...

from slutty to sci-fi to quirky to casual, and back to

slutty... as he SELECTS OPTIONS they appear on ANGIE,

ROTATING HER in three dimensions to model; she's a living,

breathing BARBIE DOLL.

ORANGE SHERBET HAIR, then a PLATINUM WHITE Judy JETSON

PONYTAIL... black CAT-SUIT, DAISY DUKE, Darryl Hannah's PUNK

REPLICANT from Blade Runner... he chooses a LOOK and LOCKS IT

GORGE lifts an OXYGEN MASK to his face and breathes deep...

he GOES LIMP in his chair - eyes rolled up in his head, head

ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels -

wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE.

OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE-

type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; the

SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't seem

to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the

back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking.

She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go,

without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH?

ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.

The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the

theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in

glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT

FARM... green, glowing FIREFLIES dart through the air...

people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively

prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow

GRUBS with red chili oil...

ANGIE takes a seat at the BAR.

BARTENDER

The usual?

She just WINKS, flirtatious.

The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE

it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into

it's pulp...

She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue...

swallows it down... as a GUY takes a seat to her left - his

hair is shiny, slick black licorice.

RICK RAPE

Hi Nika.

ANGIE

Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?

In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to match.

ANGIE (cont'd)

I thought you weren't allowed to

come here anymore.

RICK RAPE laughs, throwing his head back and slapping his

knee - EXAGGERATED.

RICK RAPE

That was just last month. I was a

bad boy.

ANGIE yawns.

ANGIE

Are you still a bad boy?

ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern,

minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind.

They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from

behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS

a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it

WHISPERS OPEN.

ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.

ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC

blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT

filter through patterned curtains.

She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE

follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and

begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees,

back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...

Urkk.

She TURNS.

KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL

- with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He

brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT

- KKRRUNCH.

ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR

with EMOTION.

KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then

falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in

his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.

GORGE is paralyzed.

GORGE/ANGIE

Please don't kill me.

ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes.     KABLE

just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.

GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)

I'll do anything.

KABLE

Don't say that.

GORGE holds out his hands; ANGIE'S fingers caress KABLE'S

chest and move toward his crotch...

Stop.

He pushes her hands away, gently.

HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.

HACKMAN

Hi, Kable.

BOOM.

KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through

a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR.

HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and

waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.

KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK,

SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY

ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating

pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE.

TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from

the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE

has obviously interrupted something.

HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S

hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still

smoking - shoulder strapped.

HACKMAN

Anybody in there?

The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING,

NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE.

HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH

BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with

TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious.

GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his

chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he

speaks, ANGIE echoes:

GORGE/ANGIE

Come on... do it...

HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one...

but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S

legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.

HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye

contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK.

ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY.

HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR

DOOR OPENS...

KABLE is waiting.

KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE

ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to

the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts

with BLOOD.

HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the

blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches;

displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The

BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall

behind him, four inches deep.

HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the

SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away,

HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN

FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out

a set of HACKMAN'S toes.

KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up

his own WEAPON to close the deal...

MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN.

KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and

CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes...

the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with

the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP

KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to

wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP

in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN

CITY...

A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of

KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring-

around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying

into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS.

They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS

moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No...

THOOM.   THOOM THOOM.

LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby

disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO.      DANCERS

KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice.

KABLE kneels beside      ANGIE, stroking her hair.

HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are all

there.

KABLE

Now what?

HUMANZ DUDE

(shrugs)

The crack works - you're the

proof... we put the DNA in the

soup, light it up, extract it -

then feed my girl's sequence into

the code and we're good to go.

GINA PARKER SMITH

(thinking out loud)

It's an anti-spyware program.

HUMANZ DUDE

Basically. We can't quarantine the

foreign cells per se but we can

disable their ability to transmit

and receive.

GINA'S not buying this I.T. GUY shit.

GINA PARKER SMITH

Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out

of me.

TRACE gives her a glance: dumb bitch.

TRACE

That would be like cutting out part

of your brain.

GINA has no answer.

KABLE

How long will she sleep?

TRACE

We're going to have to keep her

HUMANZ BROTHER (V.O.)

Ken Castle made his first billion

designing virtual reality

simulators for the US military.

Six years ago he brought them

something new - a breakthrough so

profound, he said, that history

would be divided up between

everything before and everything

that came after.

SEQUENCES and HI SCORE SCREENS flash across their faces.

HUMANZ BROTHER (cont'd)

They tested it on soldiers... the

first volunteer was Corporal Travis

Scotch - a friend of yours, I

believe.

They stop.

KABLE

Yeah. He was.

HUMANZ BROTHER

The second was you.

KABLE fights difficult memories.

KABLE

The idea was to replace your brain,

bit by bit, cell by cell,

gradual... the new tissue would

never break down, never

deteriorate.

(bitter)

A new era in human longevity is

what they told us. We were doing

the world a favor.

HUMANZ BROTHER

(nods)

Nine weeks later Scotch was dead

and you were serving life in

maximum. Castle's project was shut

down... but the shit wasn't a total

loss: the same technology

resurfaced within a year... in a

game. Castle called it society.

KABLE

Thank you for the history lesson.

HUMANZ BROTHER

Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened

in that project is something Castle

wanna be buried. We need that shit,

GORGE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. He SPAZZES OUT like a turtle on it's

shell, a moment of panic - he's been PASSED OUT in his chair

and doesn't immediately know where he is. He looks around the

DARK ROOM nervously; takes a hit of OXYGEN.

On the SCREEN, society is gone - there is only a nebulous

TEST PATTERN.

Behind him, a SOUND.

GORGE

Hooz there?

He runs his hand along the CHAIR'S TRACKBALL CONTROL, it

SPINS around and rolls forward a bit.

CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes in

A screen glitches - pixellated, fucked up, highly compressed,

like an internet feed through a busted satellite. We begin

to make out a coherent image:

It is a POV, walking, of an industrial corridor.            Cameras

mounted and doors with square glass windows.

We back away from the screen to reveal -

HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are

watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE

runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around

on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better.

We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a

chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING?

GINA PARKER SMITH

What are we looking at?

HUMANZ BROTHER

His memories... translated as raw

audiovisual data.

GINA PARKER SMITH

I read something about this. But

that tech is supposed to be a

decade away...

HUMANZ DUDE smirks, shakes his head.

HUMANZ DUDE

Current exponential rate of growth,

I can't imagine a piece of tech

that will take that long to come

He bangs on a key, beating up the interface.

Tiny SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS track his movements.            He comes to a

142   INT. MILITARY FACILITY, DEBRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    142

A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recognize

it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: a

MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM.

KABLE sits down in the other.

SCOTCH

Tillman. Never thought I'd be so

Scotch.

OK.

KABLE'S "sorry" seems to refer to something only KABLE knows.

SCOTCH

(hesitant, making light)

Well, it's not like you ever looked

that good...

A BEAT.   SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE.

KABLE'S eyes flicker away from SCOTCH'S. He calmly removes

his military issue .45 from it's holster and lets it rest on

the table between them. He stares at it intensely, emotion

starting to seep through the icy lines of his face.

SCOTCH (cont'd)

A low hum in the room starts to swell and throb, numbing,

THE MURDER has knocked the hell out of him, but he's DEALING

A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him: ANGIE.

He touches her face, looks deep into her EYES - they are wet

with emotion.

KABLE

It's you.

She just NODS.    They embrace... finally, for real.

ANGIE

I missed you... so much...

KABLE

(softly)

Delia.

ANGIE says nothing, just holds him tighter. KABLE pushes her             *

hair back - he searches her eyes, desperate with emotion.                *

It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up

CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.

Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract

statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a

soul in sight.

KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass.               Wind in the leaves,

cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.

He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central

MANSION.

THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across

the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...

KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run

RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.

KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another...

stands to reason he's been MARKED already.

He walks out INTO THE OPEN.

The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN.              KABLE walks

KABLE

He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling

to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the

glass...

KABLE (cont'd)

DELIA!

... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH

SURFACE.

KEN CASTLE (O.S.)

Not bad for video, eh?

The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be

everywhere at once, intimate.

KEN CASTLE (O.S.) (cont'd)

The latest and greatest... defy you

to tell it from real life. You

imagine porn on this thing?

KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's

playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED.

Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long

corridor -

t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss...

KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the

groove.

157   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS                        157

He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny

hardwood floor for DANCING.

A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE.

He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE

to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even

real? And then CASTLE starts to SING...

... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've

Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE:

I've got you under my skin

I've got you deep in the heart of me

So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me

I've got you under my skin...

He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN -

from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We

RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison,

the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are

wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.

KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead,

they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE

behind CASTLE...

I'd sacrifice anything come what might

For the sake of having you near

In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night

And repeats, and repeats in my ear...

KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the

room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK

SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands

in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a

DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick

with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a

ROCKETTE.

Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the

SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO

SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD

busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING

EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.

Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?

Use your mentality, wake up to reality...

But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -

before I give in

Cause I've got you, under my skin...

KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to

open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have

taken care of that.

KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS

break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out

they're flesh and blood after all.

CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his

SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand

combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces...

it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS,

right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men,

blood on his hands.

158   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                            158

Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile:

CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The

background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.

KEN CASTLE

I've got to thank you for leading

me to them, by the by - the human-

zuzz that is...

Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF

THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and

LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks

along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all

tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH

rising majestically in the dark heavens.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

Of course, soon enough they'd be

whistling my tune like everybody

else... but meantime it was that

little cracker program they dreamed

up that got my attention...

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

that was a genuine nuisance, no

doubt about it... One thing even

they didn't know, though: I'm wired

too.

SNAP back to CASTLE, MEDIUM       CLOSE.     His eyes are FUCKING

CRAZY.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

I replaced 98% of my own noodle

with nano-tissue years ago...

159   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      159

They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA

regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard,

bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank

of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on.

At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting

baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in

a FLEX BRACE.

The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.

KEN CASTLE

But mine's different.

(taps his FOREHEAD)

Built to send - to transmit .

Whereas every other K-soft cell out

there - including the ones in...

(taps KABLE'S forehead )

your head, Kable - is designed to

receive. I think it, you do it.

CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him...

HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

We're talking every Slayer,

everyone in Society City... I

believe your better half would fall

under that category... provided

they're within range of my

transmitters...

CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over,

picks up the ball and resumes shooting.

KABLE

(sarcastic)

Very nice, Castle. So you've got an

army of psychotics and deviants to

dance around for you.

(CONTINUED)

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007

159   CONTINUED:                                                       159

CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he

walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.

KEN CASTLE

You're thinking small, Kable. But

not as small as me.

He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and

CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY

FROM HIS FACE.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

See, nano cells are real small, a

thousand times smaller than even

these dust particulates...

(KABLE coughs)

Inhale it and they go to work:

replicating, spreading... like a

virus, multiplying in

exponentials... six months time I

could have 100 million people

converted - ditch diggers, porn

stars, presidents - and not one

would be the wiser.

Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently

TURNS TOWARD US.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

A hundred million folks that will

buy what I want them to buy, vote

how I want them to vote, do pretty

much damn well anything I figure

they ought to do.

HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at

a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE

KNIFE...

KEN CASTLE(cont'd)

For instance.

KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE

TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style.

KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it -

but leaving his face UNPROTECTED...

HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face,

connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this

time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and

WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with

a sickening POP.

159   CONTINUED: (2)                                                159

KABLE works around HACKMAN, gets him in a HEADLOCK and

SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it...

HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the

life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back;

he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S

dead fingers.

He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.

KABLE

You should've let him fight for

himself, Castle - he might've had a

shot.

KEN CASTLE

(pleasant)

I think you're missing the point,

my man.

KABLE

No, I get it - you're pulling the

strings on all of this...

(starts to move toward

CASTLE with BAD INTENT)

... which makes my next move pretty

easy to figure.

KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open

his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER...

His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.

KEN CASTLE

Neglected to mention: my smart boys

reversed that hack those fellas

worked for you - easy breezy, once

we had access to their drives...

This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he

feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETED BY

THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

You're mine, boy.

With a twitch of CASTLE'S eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down

and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG.

CUT TO:

160   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                              160

SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the

dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life:

It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE.          CASTLE is stripping off his

shirt.

KEN CASTLE

(on SCREEN)

Come on, lets boogie woogie rock

and roll.

SIMON

Ummm.

CUT BACK TO:

161   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      161

CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the

jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over.

He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he

backs away.

KEN CASTLE

Biggest, baddest Slayer in the

game... don't seem like much, does

he?

CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts

KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his

knuckles.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

Oww!

KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it

perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH,

MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE

strikes a pose to match.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

Lucky shot.

(grins)

OK, not really.

He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE

to the floor.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

I need an audience, boys.

A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up

slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see:

ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself                *

close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.                         *

(CONTINUED)

She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries            *

to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her           *

eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but           *

ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems             *

oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.                   *

CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

That's right, you crawl on your

belly like a toad...

(he looks to the GEEK

SQUAD, sheepish)

Is this bad? I'm really bad.

He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his

DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.                           *

He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to               *

ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel             *

that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of              *

what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking           *

to KABLE for a clue.                                                    *

KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and                 *

gently touch her face...

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

That's sweet.

CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

Alright boys, you ready? A true

test.

He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates.

KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT.

ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            *

her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              *

against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *

KABLE

(desperate)

No.

KEN CASTLE

Just like last time. Remember?

KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body

shaking...

(CONTINUED)

103.

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007

161   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      161

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

You're stronger now... a little

more fight in you... but I think

the end result will be about the

same...                                                       *

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

Shh.

The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He              *

looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he                  *

seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS                   *

EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS.               *

Suddenly:

KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one

quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the

floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a

hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into

his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

(freaked)

What the hell was that?

The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning.

Not even KABLE understands this.

PONYTAIL GEEK

There are 2 networks accessing the

same IP address.

GEEK LEADER

Someone on the outside is sending

him commands...

CUT TO:

162   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                    162

SIMON is on his feet, in full BADASS GAMER MODE.

His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand

gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand

clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND

FORWARD...

CUT BACK TO:

163   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                 163

... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is

the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S

hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...

KEN CASTLE

(panicking)

JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN

RETARDS!

GEEK

(irritated)

Working on it...

KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with

everything he has... his strength and will overpowering

CASTLE, but-

KEN CASTLE

(like he's explaining the

obvious to a child)

I think it.

KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the

knife away from CASTLE'S belly.

KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

You... fucking... do it...

CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses

his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained...

CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back -

every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin &

Yang, veins rising in his neck...

Then KABLE senses an opportunity:

KABLE

Look at this knife... imagine me

sticking it into your gut... think

about it... make it real.

CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of

course he can't help but picture it...

... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...

GEEK LEADER

Oops.

... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE

shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE

TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND.

The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw           *

her arms around her daughter.                                           *

YES!!!

He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose...

165   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - SIMULTANEOUS                                165

... and KABLE does the same.                                            *

KABLE

Damn it, kid...

CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE, glass-eyed,

draining life... they are FACE to FACE.

KABLE (cont'd)

... is the fuckin pose really

necessary?

CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.

SIMON

Sorry.

KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor...

then turns to face his family.

When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S

Georgia peach accent.

DELIA

Are you my Daddy Tillman?

He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet,

squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE

with his other arm and pulls her in.

The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment

contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug;

pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs,

get up and start to file out.

KABLE

Wait.

GEEK LEADER stops.

KABLE (cont'd)

Shut it off.

GEEK

Pardon?

KABLE

The nanex.     Set us free.

The GEEKS look at one another.

KABLE (cont'd)

It's nothing to you. A mouse-

click.

GEEK LEADER shrugs.

GEEK LEADER

True dat.

He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK: do it.

The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile.

GEEK LEADER (cont'd)

Well played, Kable.

KABLE doesn't answer; but his eyes say: how was any of this a

fucking game?

DELIA

Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt

Daddy Ken?

FADE TO BLACK.

166   INT. BATHROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE                                        166

It's TRACE, filming        herself.

TRACE

This is for you, you dumb bitch.           I

hope you do the right thing with

it.

The IMAGE switches to the CAPTURED FOOTAGE of KABLE in the

military facility... leading up to SCOTCH'S murder.

SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE

STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying

SOLDIERS to battle...

The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into

BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT.

KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the

passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window

glass.

KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with

DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back

seat.

KABLE

You good, sweetheart?

DELIA nods.

KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road.

ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on

his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back

asleep.

The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves

into the giant sun.

SMASH TO BLACK.
