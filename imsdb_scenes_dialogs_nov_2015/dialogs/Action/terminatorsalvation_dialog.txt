PRIEST

Yea, though I walk through the valley

of the shadow of death, I will fear

no evil: for thou art beside me; thy

rod and thy staff they comfort me...

SERENA

Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm

with Project Angel. You consented to

donate your body to science...

(CONTINUED)

2.

MARCUS

Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.

SERENA

You've been chosen for our research.

MARCUS

Chosen?    Lucky me.

SERENA

We just need a couple of signatures...

MARCUS

You don't need to be scared.

SERENA

I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration.

MARCUS

Cancer?

SERENA

(NODS)

You're not the only one with a

death sentence.

SERENA (cont'd)

What you're doing is important,

Marcus. Our work is still highly

experimental... but you may be

helping people in ways you can't

begin to imagine.

MARCUS

I'm a regular hero.

(CONTINUED)

3.

SERENA

Thank you.     And... I'm sorry.

MARCUS

No one lives forever.

PRIEST (V.O.)

Marcus, this is your last

opportunity to make a confession...

PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)

Is there nothing you would say to

Officer Martinez' family?

MARCUS (V.O.)

What can I say. I was seventeen, I

was angry, I was stupid.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)

Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm

sorry about everything. The whole

goddamn world...

CUT TO BLACK.

You will not believe the shit we

found down here--

guys were still down there...

MARCUS

Hey!   Yo, over here!

MARCUS (cont'd)

Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt

like I was the last man on...

MARCUS (cont'd)

Oh God...

Hey mister, where you goin' in such

a hurry?

(CONTINUED)

11.

BOY (cont'd)

Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got

any food?

BOY (cont'd)

You look like you been eating

pretty good.

MARCUS

You're human... you can see me, you

can touch me. This place is real.

MARCUS (cont'd)

I thought I was in hell.

BOY

(raises an eyebrow)

This sure ain't heaven.

MARCUS

Those things with masks, red eyes--

BOY

(CASUALLY)

Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff?

(CONTINUED)

12.

MARCUS

If I'm not in hell, where am I?!

BOY

(CHOKING)

Texas!

GIRL

Let him go!

MARCUS

First put down the shotgun.

BOY

Do what he says.

GIRL

He'll kill us both!

MARCUS

I don't wanna kill anyone.

BOY

Do it, Star. Put it down.

GIRL

There was only one bullet in that gun.

(CONTINUED)

13.

MARCUS

I don't like it when people point

guns at me.

GIRL

It wasn't loaded.

MARCUS

You took on a guy like me with one

bullet and an empty shotgun?

(studies them admiringly)

Pretty stupid.

GIRL

Can I have my gun back?

GIRL (cont'd)

Where'd you get those?

MARCUS

In the city.

(CONTINUED)

14.

BOY

(steps away from him)

The city? Oh man. That place is

red hot.

MARCUS

(a small smile)

Seemed kinda dead to me.

BOY

No-- radiation.

BOY (cont'd)

Get down, they've seen the light!

MARCUS

That wasn't a helicopter...

BOY

It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.   Where

the hell have you been?

GIRL

Rads musta fried his brains.   Let's

go, Kyle.

KYLE

What's your name?

MARCUS

(after a beat)

Marcus. Marcus Wright.

(CONTINUED)

15.

KYLE

Kyle Reese.

(indicates girl)

She doesn't remember her name--

(re: her cap)

--so I call her Star.

KYLE (cont'd)

Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better

find cover. We spotted some

buildings half a mile that way.

KYLE (cont'd)

You can come if you want.

STAR

(hissing at him)

Why? We don't need him.

KYLE

(a shrug, sotto)

I like him. He's funny.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

What year is it?

STAR

Seventeen.

KYLE

Nope.   Eighteen.

(CONTINUED)

16.

STAR

Are you sure?

KYLE

Yup.   Two thousand eighteen.

MARCUS

Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years.

So who did it to us? Terrorists?

The Russians, the Chinese--?

STAR

Huh?

MARCUS

The nukes. There was a war, right?

Who started it?

KYLE

Something fall on your head? The

machines did it, the computers--

they got smart.

STAR

Judgment Day... I was just a baby.

KYLE

What's the last thing you remember?

MARCUS

(a beat)

Dying.

KYLE

Eyeball.   Only one.

(CONTINUED)

17.

STAR

Now!

MARCUS

That flying grapefruit, what was it?

KYLE

Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes.

They patrol places like this,

looking for survivors.

STAR

Yes!

KYLE

Any red ones?

(CONTINUED)

18.

KYLE (cont'd)

Mm.    Ketchup.

STAR

Yuk!

MARCUS

Jalapeno sauce.

STAR

You can read.

KYLE

So can I.

(off Star's look)

Well, sort of... a little.

STAR

Want some?

MARCUS

No thanks.     Not hungry.

KYLE

Never heard anyone say that before.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

19.

MARCUS

I look the same.

KYLE

You ever watch television?

MARCUS

Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had

to look forward to in the joint.

STAR

(YAWNING)

What's a joint?

MARCUS

(BLINKS)

Prison. Spent half my life there.

KYLE

I remember TV a little.   Cartoons.

It was great.

MARCUS

She your sister?

KYLE

Dunno. Been together since we was

little. Bunch of us kids was at

the day-care center when the bombs

fell... she and me are the only

ones still around.

MARCUS

(disturbed; gestures around)

So this is it? Your life?

(CONTINUED)

20.

KYLE

We're gonna find the Resistance, fight

for John Connor against Skynet. You

oughta join us, you're pretty cool.

MARCUS

You don't know me.

KYLE

You're strong, you can read... you

didn't kill us. Good enough for me...

MARCUS

Skynet runs the machines...?   So

who's this John Connor?

KYLE

He's... I don't know. The best.

Everybody talks about him. He's

the one who's gonna save us.

MARCUS

Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.

KYLE

Who's Jesus?

MARCUS

You're asking the wrong guy.

KYLE

(closing his eyes)

So why were you in prison?

MARCUS

(a long beat)

I killed a cop.

KYLE

Were cops like terminators?

MARCUS

Well... Nah, some of `em were all right.

(SIGHS)

My little brother Max, pretty wild

kid, not much older than you-- he

stole a car, just joy-riding,

y'know, showing off.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

21.

MARCUS (cont'd)

Cop chased him right into our front

yard, pulled him outta the car...

and started whaling on him, kicking

the shit out of him. No reason for

it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran

out of the house, guy tried to pull

his gun on me-- guess I just went

off on him. Don't even remember it

really... they say I broke his neck.

(BEAT)

Max must be dead too, now... like

everybody else.

KYLE

You gonna be here when I wake up?

MARCUS

Sure.

KYLE

Good.   Stay away from the windows.

STAR

Just me.

(CONTINUED)

22.

STAR (cont'd)

Whatcha reading?

MARCUS

The bible. My grandma always tried

to get me into it, but-- it always

put me to sleep.

(BEAT)

Still does.

STAR

Would you read something to me?

MARCUS

"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat

the son of Hori. Of the tribe of

Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--"

STAR

There's a book inside with pictures.

MARCUS

"Guaranteed lowest prices... open

seven days..."

STAR

What's that?

MARCUS

It's a flower. A rose.

STAR

(full of wonder)

So... all those numbers... you

could call them and get, like,

flowers, or someone to come over

and fix stuff, or bring you food...

(CONTINUED)

23.

MARCUS

(nods, touched)

Guess people had it pretty good.

(FLIPS)

What else we got... movers,

mufflers, music--

STAR

Music?

MARCUS

You know, pianos, guitars...

STAR

I don't remember music.

MARCUS

Come on. You must...

(approximating the tune)

"I can't get no... satisfaction..."

(off her blank look)

"We are family... I got all my sisters

with me..." No, huh. How about...

"Twinkle twinkle little star..."

MARCUS & STAR

"How I wonder what you are... up

above the world so high, like a

diamond in the sky..."

MARCUS

You OK?

STAR

(shakes her head)

Somebody used to sing that to me.

STAR (cont'd)

Stay with us, Marcus. Please.

(CONTINUED)

24.

DISSOLVE TO:

KYLE

If we get it to move, will you

teach me to make it go?

MARCUS

It's called driving.   Sure.

STAR

Wow.   What were these like?

MARCUS

(SMILING)

Not too many around in my time.

DISSOLVE TO:

25.

STAR

Now!

MARCUS

Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!

KYLE

Aerostat's coming!

STAR

Music...

MARCUS

Sort of.

(CONTINUED)

26.

STAR

Oh no! It's gonna call a

Harvester, we're dead--

KYLE

Wow.   You're good.

DISSOLVE TO:

STAR

Faster!

MARCUS

No!    You're doing fine.

(CONTINUED)

27.

MARCUS (cont'd)

Ssh.

RADIO VOICE

--proper ratio of ammonium nitrate

to diesel fuel. A bomb of this

type can be contained in an

ordinary plastic garbage bag, and

will detonate on impact...

KYLE

(EXCITED)

That's him!

RADIO VOICE

This recording has described booby-

traps and explosive devices. It

will repeat every two hours on

different frequencies to avoid

Skynet jamming...

MARCUS

Stop the car.

MARCUS (cont'd)

Other pedal, other pedal!

(CONTINUED)

28.

RADIO VOICE

Do not give in to despair. As

bleak as things seem, I assure you,

humanity will triumph.

RADIO VOICE (cont'd)

The machines only win when we give

up hope... this is John Connor.

DISSOLVE TO:

KYLE

We oughta find a place to hole up

for the day...

MARCUS

Damn it.    Empty.

KYLE

You smell that?

STAR

Food!

29.

MARCUS

What is this?

KYLE

(mouth full)

Who cares?

MARCUS

Spit it out!

STAR

(CHEWING)

It's good!

(CONTINUED)

30.

COW

Not much meat on `em.

PIG

This one's fi-i-ine--

MARCUS

Oops.

PIG

We didn't kill `em! I swear to

God, they was dead already, we

wasn't gonna let `em rot--

BULL

Go `head, take as much as you want,

we're on the same side here--

BLAIR (O.S.)

Yo!   Up here!

(CONTINUED)

36.

BLAIR (cont'd)

Who are you--

MARCUS

Name's Marcus.

BLAIR

You can put me down now, Marcus.

BLAIR (cont'd)

I've got an ELT, but I can't call

for a rescue here. There's an

outpost a few miles upriver-- not

my favorite people in the world,

but it's safe. Let's move.

MARCUS

I'm heading that way.

BLAIR

(a short laugh)

The hot zone? No you're not.

MARCUS

I've got to get to my friends--

BLAIR

What friends?

(CONTINUED)

37.

MARCUS

Couple of kids. They were in that

flying dumpster--

BLAIR

The Skynet transport? It was

carrying people?

(off his nod)

Christ, we almost shot it down.

There've been rumors about a

concentration camp, but...

BLAIR (cont'd)

You can't get across-- river's

fulla hydrobots--

MARCUS

Hydrobots?

BLAIR

They can't see, but they have killer

sonar. They'll attack anything that

moves or makes a sound. Even if you

get past them, you'd be dead before

you covered a hundred yards. If the

terminators don't get you, the fallout

will-- heavy rads all the way to the

Gulf coast, nothing can live there.

MARCUS

You're with the Resistance.

BLAIR

Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what

used to be the Air National Guard.

(CONTINUED)

38.

BLAIR (cont'd)

Stupid bastards. Come on.

MARCUS

I don't know... this has gotta be

some kind of, like, dream or

hallucination. Like what happens

to people right before they die...

BLAIR

That snap you out of it?

BLAIR (cont'd)

Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do

us all a favor and wake up already.

CUT TO:

BLAIR

So let me get this straight, Marcus.

There you are on death row, they stick

a needle in your arm...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

39.

BLAIR (cont'd)

and the next thing you know, you're

here.

(off his nod)

Since this ain't the resurrection,

there's only one possibility.

MARCUS

Let's hear it.

BLAIR

Whatever they pumped into your veins just

knocked you out. This Angel Project you

signed up for-- there was a lotta

cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs

fell, they musta froze your ass.

MARCUS

What the hell for?

BLAIR

Drug tests, medical experiments, organ

harvesting, who knows? You said you

had no family, no friends-- why let a

body like yours go to waste?

MARCUS

I've never seen trees like these.

BLAIR

We're in a mutation zone. I saw a

two-headed squirrel here once--

MARCUS

Freaky.

BLAIR

(SHRUGS)

Tasted like chicken.

BLAIR (cont'd)

Levels are tolerable now, but just.

We can't spend the night here.

(CONTINUED)

40.

MARCUS

What was that?

BLAIR

I didn't hear anything--

BLAIR (cont'd)

Skindogs.

MARCUS

They're surrounding us.

BLAIR

They're smart. And they don't

scare easy.

(CONTINUED)

41.

BLAIR (cont'd)

You saved my ass. Thanks.

MARCUS

Dog eat dog world.

DISSOLVE TO:

BLAIR

Thanks.

BLAIR (cont'd)

It's not far, but we'll never get

across the mine field at night.

Might as well STAF till morning.

BLAIR (cont'd)

C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.

MARCUS

Staf?   What's that mean?

(CONTINUED)

42.

BLAIR

It's a resistance term.    Sit tight

and fuck.

BLAIR (cont'd)

You holding out for lipstick?

Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?

MARCUS

I'm not gay. In prison, I thought

about puss-- women all the time. But

now... it's not working. Who knows,

all those years on ice...

BLAIR

Maybe it's just gonna take some time.

Before you're completely thawed out.

BLAIR (cont'd)

What are these?

MARCUS

I dunno. They just... sorta

reminded me of her.

BLAIR

Who?

MARCUS

There's a woman, the last woman I

saw before... when I was under, the

dead time-- she kept coming to me.

I think she must've saved me.

BLAIR

I can't compete with that.

(CONTINUED)

43.

CUT TO:

KYLE

We've landed.

(CONTINUED)

44.

STAR

What's going to happen to us?

KYLE

I don't know...

CUT TO:

MARCUS

We're in somebody's garden.

BLAIR

Christ... there's supposed to be

barbed wire along the edge.

MARCUS

Over there.

(CONTINUED)

45.

BLAIR

Whatever you do, don't move.

(SHOUTS)

Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody

hear me?!

(to Marcus)

We're in the middle of the mine field.

CUT TO:

BARNES

Somebody feed those things!

MORRISON

Start up the generator, Barnes.

LISA

We got company!

(CONTINUED)

46.

BARNES

Blair? Good to see you.

(off her glare)

What's the password?

BLAIR

Eat shit and die, Barnes!

BARNES

Close enough. Who's your friend?

BLAIR

Could you get us outta here please?

BARNES

Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in

a mine field.

BLAIR

You didn't maintain the perimeter!

Where are your sentries?

BARNES

It's too early for that military crap.

BARNES (cont'd)

OK, if you keep walking straight

you're gonna get blown all to

hell... turn to your left and take,

oh... five steps.

BARNES (cont'd)

OK, face me now. Three steps.

(CONTINUED)

47.

BARNES (cont'd)

Almost home. Turn to your right

and take another five steps...

BLAIR

You goddamn idiot!

BARNES

He was takin' bigger steps!

MORRISON

Son of a bitch is heavy.

JANE

He stepped on a Claymore? This guy

oughta be in a hundred pieces...

(CONTINUED)

48.

BLAIR

What are you doing?

JANE

Does he have a prosthetic limb?

BLAIR

I don't think so.

JANE

This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God--

JANE (cont'd)

He's a terminator.

CUT TO BLACK.

SERENA

Why isn't he conscious?

Something's wrong, he should be

coming out of it by now...

CUT TO:

49.

MARCUS

Boo!

JANE

Thermoplastic skin, some larger

hydraulics, but mostly titanium

microgears... This looks like some sort

of aeration and hydration system,

function unclear at this point. Valves

and what looks like an access panel

below the ribcage...

(CONTINUED)

50.

JANE (cont'd)

Eyes are polymer optics, very lifelike.

Lead shielding all around the skull,

presumably to protect the CPU.

BLAIR

Whatever he is-- he's on our side--

MORRISON

How can he be?

BLAIR

He saved my life!

MORRISON

Winning your trust would aid his

infiltration.

LISA

Regional doesn't know what to do.

They're gonna patch us through to

Command Los Angeles.

NANCY

How could you bring this monster here?!

This is our home! Our children--

BLAIR

What do you want from me-- I didn't know!

(CONTINUED)

51.

KID

It's awake!

MARCUS

Get me the hell down from here!

BARNES

Shut up!   I told you to shut up!

BLAIR

Leave him alone!

(turning away from him)

Marcus, I'm so sorry...

BARNES

It keeps talkin' at me. God this

thing gives me the creeps.

MARCUS

Why are you doing this?    What is

this place?

MORRISON

We're trying to--

NANCY

(over him)

Don't say anything!     It's probably

uplinked to Skynet.

MORRISON

Then it's already too late.

(to Marcus)

This used to be an ICBM silo, we're

just trying to stay alive here.

Your turn-- where'd you come from?

(CONTINUED)

52.

MARCUS

Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or

it was.

BARNES

(AMAZED)

It sounds completely human... it

really could pass.

JANE

Didn't John Connor say they'd start

building things like this?

MORRISON

Not yet-- not for years.

(to Marcus)

So, you're programmed with false

memories, a human history--

MARCUS

What are you talking about?

MORRISON

You can skip the act, we know what

you are.

NANCY

Why are you even speaking to it?!

BARNES

She's right, let's just waste the

damn thing--

NANCY

It'll kill us all if we give it a

CHANCE--

MARCUS

I'm a man!

MARCUS (cont'd)

Even if I never been treated like

one.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

53.

MARCUS (cont'd)

Year after year after year on death

row, I just wanted it to end! I

cut my own wrists. But they nursed

me back to health, `cause that

wouldn't be fair, they needed to

kill me themselves. For Chrissake,

you all want me dead so bad-- just

do it.

(a scream)

Do it!

LISA

Regional got through to CLA-- they

want us to rig a video feed.

(gesturing at Marcus)

He wants to see him.

MORRISON

Who does?

LISA

John Connor.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

So this guy is what, like king of

the world, or what's left of it?

(CONTINUED)

54.

MORRISON

John Connor founded the Resistance.

When the war began, no one even

knew who the enemy was-- Connor

taught us how to fight back. He

saved humanity.

MARCUS

Yeah, well, humanity's never done

all that much for me. Why can't I

see him?

MORRISON

Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be

allowed to discover his location,

even his appearance is kept secret.

CONNOR'S VOICE

--hello-- standing by--

LISA

Sir, we can hear you, sir, working

on a visual, sir...

CONNOR

Not what I expected...

INTERCUT WITH:

(CONTINUED)

55.

CONNOR'S VOICE

It does seem lifelike-- is the face

able to mimic emotions--?

MARCUS

This shit is ridiculous. What the

hell do you want from me?

CONNOR

(STUNNED)

I-- I need to know what you are.

MARCUS

So do I! I don't know what I am, what

I'm doing here, I don't know shit--

maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it!

Just blow my head off or let me go.

CONNOR

This isn't right. I can't be

having a conversation with a

terminator, Skynet isn't that

sophisticated yet. Unless... were

you sent here from the future?

MARCUS

(very confused)

What?

CONNOR

Skynet's developing a time

displacement field, we've decrypted

recent data transmissions.

(SADLY)

I know for a fact that soon machines

will be travelling back decades. To

try and stop us from winning this war

before it begins...

MARCUS

You're out of your mind, aren't you?

(CONTINUED)

56.

CONNOR'S VOICE

Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand

by for further instructions.

KATE

He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no

human tissue over the endoskeleton.

CONNOR

Besides, the first T-800s won't be

manufactured until `26.

ADVISOR #1

Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.

ADVISOR #2

Let's hope. If there are more out there

like him, we're in serious trouble.

Christ, a terminator with attitude...

KATE

Where did they find him?

ADVISOR #1

East-central Texas, near an area of

heavy Skynet concentration. The

outpost where they're holding him is

reasonably secure, but it's not much

more than a commune.

CONNOR

I want him extracted.

ADVISOR #1

Done.   What then?

(CONTINUED)

57.

CONNOR

Get him to our best people for

disassembly, find out what makes him

tick. We need to get into that metal

skull, crack his CPU at all costs.

CONNOR (cont'd)

Kate, why did I become leader of

the Resistance?

KATE

Because people trust you... you

give them faith--

CONNOR

No. Because I knew I would be, I

was told. I know when and where the

major battles are going to take

place. I know I'm going to send my

own father back through time to save

my mother-- even though I haven't

met him yet. Christ, I even know

the year I'm going to die...

KATE

JOHN--

CONNOR

So how could I not know about this?!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

58.

MARCUS

Feels like I been here before...

what are you gonna do to me?

MORRISON

Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a

chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.

CUT TO:

KYLE

We're stopping.

(CONTINUED)

59.

STAR

I'm scared.

KYLE

(hugging her)

Whatever happens, we stick together.

(CONTINUED)

60.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

Hello? Anyone there?

(BEAT)

I'm thirsty.

BARNES

(SNICKERING)

Want some motor oil?

MARCUS

I need water.

BARNES

Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.

MARCUS

Please, I'm--

BARNES

Shut up, robot!

BLAIR

How's it going, Barnes? Thought

you might like a late-night snack.

(CONTINUED)

61.

BARNES

Where in hell'd you get these?

BLAIR

We got a stash back at the base.

BARNES

Kinda stale.

BLAIR

You need something to wash it down.

BARNES

I'm on duty, you know.

BARNES (cont'd)

Twinkies and moonshine. You trying

to seduce me again?

BLAIR

You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I

just didn't want to join the harem.

BARNES

What can I say? It's our duty to

repopulate the planet.

BLAIR

Noble of you to make the sacrifice.

BARNES

C'mere.

BLAIR

I prefer a little privacy.

(CONTINUED)

62.

BARNES

You're so twentieth century...

BARNES (cont'd)

Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...

BLAIR

Men.   You're all talk.

BLAIR (cont'd)

I used up the last of my Valium for

you... Hold out your arms.

MARCUS

Why are you doing this?

BLAIR

I don't believe you're a terminator.

MARCUS

So what am I...?

BLAIR

Whatever you are-- I owe you one.

Once you're free, I'll lie down

next to Barnes-- they'll assume you

escaped while we were passed out--

(CONTINUED)

63.

MARCUS

You think they'll buy that?

BLAIR

Worth a shot.

(looking at him)

Marcus, Command wants to take you

apart, cut open your head. One

thing I know, you're alive-- and

you've got a right to live.

BLAIR

They're already here for you--

BLAIR (cont'd)

Hide in the forest, then aim west

for open country--

MARCUS

I'm heading across the river.

BLAIR

No human being can survive there--

(CONTINUED)

64.

MARCUS

I'm not human, remember?

BLAIR

You're gonna try and save those kids.

MARCUS

It's the only thing I can think of

that makes any sense...

BLAIR

Marcus, for all you know, they're

dead already--

MARCUS

For all I know, they're the reason

I'm back from the dead.

BLAIR

Damn it, we're too late--

MARCUS

Where's that go?

BLAIR

Should lead out, but there's no way

past the fan--

65.

BLAIR

Here. My ELT-- emergency locator

transmitter. If you find the camp,

activate it like this. It could

really help the Resistance.

MARCUS

Thank you.

CUT TO:

CONNOR

I need to talk to the prisoner.

CONNOR

Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry

about the way you've been treated,

but we're forced to take every

precaution. I'm John Connor.

BLAIR

Sir.

CONNOR

At ease.   Please, sit.

(CONTINUED)

73.

CONNOR (cont'd)

I've gone over your record,

lieutenant. You're a good soldier,

flown a lot of missions...

(BEAT)

Why in God's name would you help a

terminator escape?

BLAIR

Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's

human.

CONNOR

We know he's crossed into Skynet

territory, why would he do that if

he isn't--

BLAIR

He's trying to find his friends.

CONNOR

What friends?

BLAIR

A couple of kids. They were taken

in a Skynet transport, probably to

some kind of prison camp-- he said

their names were Star and Kyle.

CONNOR

Kyle.

BLAIR

Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'

CONNOR

Reese.

BLAIR

That's it.     How did you...?

(CONTINUED)

74.

KATE

What is it, John?

CONNOR

I always knew I'd have to find him

someday. I just didn't know how.

KATE

What?   Find who?

CONNOR

My father.

CUT TO:

KYLE AND STAR

Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

STAR

Oh no, oh no...

KYLE

Shh, keep singing.

Stop it stop it STOP IT!

JEREMY

Are you all right?

MARCUS

What the hell is this?

JEREMY

You look like you've been hit by a truck--

MARCUS

Among other things. Look, I'm

trying to find some friends-- a

couple of kids. They were taken

here, I saw some buildings--

JEREMY

The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll

take you there.

JEREMY (cont'd)

This round was gonna blow my

handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.

MARCUS

Marcus.

(CONTINUED)

78.

JEREMY

I can't connect with you at all...

your interface must've been

damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll

have you as good as new.

MARCUS

I didn't think there was-- anything

like this left... anywhere.

JEREMY

Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some?

MARCUS

This isn't food.

JEREMY

Well, of course not. Seems you got

a little memory loss going on.

JEREMY (cont'd)

It's a foam resin. It can taste like

anything you want it to-- but of

course, we don't really need to eat.

(BEAT)

Our brains are powered by fuel cells,

remember?

(CONTINUED)

79.

JEREMY (cont'd)

We're in a transitional phase.

Most of us need the comfort of the

familiar a little while longer--

food, shelter, sex. Until we

forget the old life.

JEREMY (cont'd)

Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of

the hardest habits to break... but

before long, none of this will be

necessary. We won't even need these

bodies.

MARCUS

Terminators!

JEREMY

We don't call them that here.

MARCUS

What are you?

JEREMY

A hybrid.    The same as you.

(CONTINUED)

80.

MARCUS

A hybrid-- human and machine?

JEREMY

Of course. That's what this community

is for-- people like us.

MARCUS

Jesus... why?

JEREMY

You should be grateful to have been

chosen.

MARCUS

What about the ones who weren't?

JEREMY

You mean like Janet and the kids.

MARCUS

Your family. You lost them?

MARCUS (cont'd)

Why are you smiling?

JEREMY

`Cause I feel good. The interface

recognizes negative emotions-- rage,

grief, despair-- and stimulates

positive endorphins in response. Thank

God, life would be pretty unbearable

otherwise, don't you think?

(CONTINUED)

81.

MARCUS

Tell me everything.   How did you

people get here?

JEREMY

Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA.

I was an engineer on Project Angel--

MARCUS

Angel-- what is it?

JEREMY

Advanced Nexus of Genetic and

Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L.

You can stop choking me, it's not

like I need to breathe.

JEREMY (cont'd)

We replaced the body's hydrocarbons

with plastinated compounds while

maintaining cellular structure--

analog neural impulses were converted

to wireless digital signals,

controlling the micro-tech chassis--

MARCUS

English!

JEREMY

(sighs, slowly)

The goal was a superior support

system for the human brain-- to go

anywhere, do anything-- explore

deep space, the bottom of the sea.

I specialized in optics.

(CONTINUED)

82.

JEREMY (cont'd)

The facility is just ahead. I'll

let them know you're coming.

CUT TO:

ENGINEER

32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no,

insufficient neural capacity.

32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have

even been brought here...

ENGINEER (cont'd)

32581 looks good...

ENGINEER (cont'd)

32582... hm, borderline. May not

be emotionally compatible. Pass.

CUT TO:

SERENA

Marcus!

(CONTINUED)

84.

SERENA (cont'd)

Marcus... it is you. You're alive,

you found us. Welcome to paradise.

MARCUS

(DISGUSTED)

It's a graveyard.

SERENA

There was no choice-- the old

civilization had to be eliminated.

To make way for a new world... a

world without death or suffering.

SERENA (cont'd)

You were the first... I'm sorry.

SERENA (cont'd)

We should never have left you behind.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

85.

AIDE

Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you

said you wanted to know immediately--

CONNOR

What is it?

AIDE

We found our terminator.

AIR FORCE OFFICER

The signal's coming from near what used

to be Galveston, right on the coast.

NAVAL OFFICER

There can't be any prisoners there.

The whole area's a nuclear

wasteland-- only machines can

survive the radiation levels for

any length of time.

CONNOR

Mobilize a combined air and naval

assault, all available resources.

We're sending in a rescue team ASAP.

KATE

All to find one teenage boy...?

John, you really think this can work?

(CONTINUED)

86.

CONNOR

I'm standing here, I exist-- so it

must have worked. We will find him.

CONNOR (cont'd)

Call it an act of faith.

DISSOLVE TO:

SERENA

Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right.

MARCUS

Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being

your guinea pig, what are you doing

to me now?!

(CONTINUED)

87.

SERENA

Repairing you.

MARCUS

You all work for Skynet!

SERENA

Please. Skynet works for us. It's only

a program-- a tool, a means to an end.

MARCUS

The end of the world.

SERENA

Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.

SERENA (cont'd)

Listen to me. Skynet was designed to

detect threats, make projections and

implement solutions. As soon as it

came on line, it factored in war,

disease, environmental destruction--

and calculated a high probability of

total human extinction within two

hundred years. The human race was

doomed... unless we were transformed.

MARCUS

Into-- this? A brain in a box?

SERENA

Skynet had access to the entire

defense web-- including Project

Angel. It determined hybrids were

the only path to salvation.

MARCUS

Destroying the human race in order

to save it.

(CONTINUED)

88.

MARCUS (cont'd)

What are you doing?

SERENA

When the resistance attacked our

installation, we were forced to

self-destruct. We would have taken

you with us, but we thought you

were in a permanent coma...

SERENA (cont'd)

Your interface was never installed.

MARCUS

No, stop... I don't want it!

You're dead inside, all of you!

SERENA

We're immortal. No sane person

would choose to live in pain,

forever. Soon you'll understand.

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

89.

SERENA

How are you feeling, Marcus?

MARCUS

I'm not sure I know how to describe it.

SERENA

It's called happiness. You've been

angry all your life. You don't

know what it's like to feel... a

part of something.

SERENA

Pure ecstasy... we can share in it

together.

MARCUS

When I was a kid my grandmother

would go on about heaven... it

always sounded so boring.

SERENA

Were you bored just now?

(CONTINUED)

90.

SERENA (cont'd)

That sensation is always there for

you, whenever you desire. But most of

us here are scientists... our greatest

joy is using our minds to explore, to

discover... I'll show you.

SERENA

Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals...

working with Skynet, we're making

amazing breakthroughs, well beyond

anything possible before Judgment Day.

SERENA

We've already freed ourselves from

biological limits... soon we'll

transcend the laws of physics.

(CONTINUED)

91.

SERENA (cont'd)

Right now, we can only go back a

few days at most...

MARCUS

A time machine... Connor was right.

SERENA

(sudden interest)

The Resistance leader?   You know him?

MARCUS

...I've just heard him speak.

SERENA

He's a dangerous man. Delusional.

He thinks he's a savior, but all he's

really fighting for is... death.

MARCUS

In the world outside-- the

survivors think Skynet is the

enemy, out to destroy them. Why

don't you tell them about all this?

SERENA

Not everyone can become like us,

Marcus. We just don't have the

resources to sustain more than a

few thousand hybrids.

MARCUS

Then why... Some people I knew were

picked up, taken here...

92.

SERENA

A boy and a girl-- in the last day

or two?

MARCUS

Yes... what is this place?

SERENA

Part of the neural net-- human minds

linked directly with artificial

intelligence. The processing power

of the human brain is still beyond

anything Skynet can manufacture.

SERENA (cont'd)

Display recent arrivals for processing.

SERENA (cont'd)

Next page...

MARCUS

That's them.

(CONTINUED)

93.

SERENA

Good news. He'll soon be part of

the network-- you'll be able to

connect with him.

SERENA (cont'd)

I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus.

She didn't suffer.

MARCUS

Of course.     I... I understand.

MARCUS (cont'd)

What is it?

SERENA

I don't know-- I have to go.    Will

you be all right?

(off his smile and nod)

Of course you will.

(CONTINUED)

94.

MARCUS

I need to go back!

PHYSICIST

The wormholing fluctuates, right

now it's oscillating between three

and six hours--

MARCUS

What do I do?

PHYSICIST

Just breach the sphere. But you

could materialize anywhere in a

mile radius--

(CONTINUED)

95.

PHYSICIST (cont'd)

No, don't shoot in here--!

PHYSICIST (cont'd)

Idiots.

ENGINEER

32581 looks good... 32582... hm,

borderline. May not be emotionally

compatible. Pass.

MARCUS

Let them go.

ENGINEER

What?   Who are you?

MARCUS

I said, let them go!

(CONTINUED)

97.

ENGINEER

You can't hurt me.

MARCUS

Now you're pissing me off.

MARCUS (cont'd)

How'd that feel?

MARCUS (cont'd)

I pull this off and you'll be in a

world of pain!

(CONTINUED)

98.

MARCUS (cont'd)

Last chance. Let them out.

MARCUS (cont'd)

I'm gonna need your clothes.

KYLE

No!

STAR

What?

KYLE

Marcus!

STAR

I knew you'd come.

We've gotta get out of here.

MARCUS

Stay down!

It's OK, I'm not human!

You can't drive!

KYLE

Watch me!

DOCTOR

Does this hurt?

MARCUS

I don't feel a thing.    Help

somebody else.

KATE

Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.

CONNOR

The last boatload is right behind

me. Skynet's pouring in

reinforcements, we can't hold this

place. And the people in the

houses, they won't leave--

MARCUS

They're not people anymore...

MARCUS (cont'd)

No!

Marcus... I need to head back to my

BLAIR (cont'd)

What about you?

MARCUS

I have no idea. I should be dead...

STAR

But you're alive.

(CONTINUED)

110.

MARCUS

(a half-smile)

So to speak.

BLAIR

We've been ordered not to talk

about it-- the hybrids, everything

about that place is top secret...

MARCUS

Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus

machine.

STAR

(BEAT)

What did it feel like?   To be...

one of them?

MARCUS

(thoughtful beat)

Better than anything. Everything made

sense. For the first time in my life,

I felt... right. It was heaven.

BLAIR

How could you give that up?

MARCUS

I never really believed in heaven.

BLAIR

Here.   You need these more than I do.

KATE

He wants to see you.

CONNOR

Her name was Sarah... she was...

amazing...

KYLE

I don't remember my mother.

CONNOR

Keep it.

KATE

Kyle, could you give us a minute?

KATE (cont'd)

Marcus... you're going to need to

be rebuilt. Your face, your body,

your voice...

(off his shrug)

We have people who can do it.

KATE (cont'd)

But you won't be the same...

(CONTINUED)

112.

KATE (cont'd)

The scar will help hide the change.

MARCUS

You're asking me to become...

(gesturing at Connor)

Him?

CONNOR

You must.

KATE

(QUIETLY)

We can't keep him alive much longer.

(shakes her head, swallows)

Very few people know what John

actually looks like. Only the

technicians and our closest advisors

need ever know the truth.

MARCUS

Why me?

KATE

Who else? Only you know the enemy

from the inside. You liberated a

Skynet camp... you're a hero.

CONNOR

I never knew how I was supposed to

win this war. But I finally

understand: the idea of John Connor

is more important than the person.

(sinks back, spent)

I can die. He cannot.

Please.   We need you.

Yea, though I walk through the

MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)

MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)

I died, and was reborn. I wear

another man's face, lead another

man's life... yet only now do I

have a reason for living. I once

was lost, but now I'm found...
