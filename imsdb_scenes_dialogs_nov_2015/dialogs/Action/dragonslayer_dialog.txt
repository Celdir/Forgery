Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in

nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.

VOICE

Come on, candles, out!

VOICE

In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi:

Lux! Exstinguat!

GALEN

Vide, Magister. There's something

wrong.

GALEN

What's the matter? What's happened?

ULRICH

I've just seen something. Something

of consequence to you.

GALEN

To me?

ULRICH

(calm)

Yes. My own death.

ULRICH

Perhaps we had better hasten your

training.

CUT TO:

ULRICH

(stern and troubled)

This wood, these leaves, the birds,

the very dome of heaven, once they

all rang with one great chord: and

philosophers like me kept it all in

tune. Now, new voices are singing

new songs.

(sharply)

Have you mastered the threefold

transmutation?

GALEN

Of course.

ULRICH

(skeptical)

You have?

GALEN

Well, almost.

ULRICH

It's very difficult. Have you

committed to memory undying the Codex

de Profundis?

GALEN

(a shrug)

The first two chapters.

ULRICH

It's long. And what about the Ritual

of Banishment as prescribed by my

late master Balisarius?

GALEN

To tell the truth, I haven't dared

try it. What's the point, anyway?

ULRICH

The point? The point is you don't

know it, and you're no magician

without it. It was my hope to school

you, to mold your faculties and

wits... I still believe you have

some talent. Somewhere.

GALEN

I hate books. I hate drill. I want a

real task.

ULRICH

There's no time now. When I'm gone,

half the powers in the universe will

vanish with me. And what's the use

of a few lingering skills if they're

left in the hands of a child?

(pause)

Listen!

GALEN

I don't hear anything.

ULRICH

Here, wear this.

GALEN

Voices, singing on the road.

GALEN

I don't see anything.

ULRICH

(a shout)

We have visitors!

CUT TO:

ULRICH

Looks forbidding enough, don't you

think?

GALEN

Here are your sticks.

ULRICH

No -- they'll think me infirm. You

know, Balisarius wore this whenever

he changed lead into gold. He could

really do that, you know. I never

could. Too bad -- you'd stand to

inherit some real wealth.

GALEN

You're in a morbid frame of mind.

What's all this about dying? You

don't even look sick.

ULRICH

(tying on a sash)

You still wearing that amulet?

(Galen nods)

Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs

to me.

ULRICH

Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a

handful of that sulphurous ash over

there...

ULRICH

Nunc habeus lux!

ULRICH

Et calor!

ULRICH

Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.

Which one of you calls himself

Valerian?

VALERIAN

That would be me. We are here on

behalf...

ULRICH

I know why you're here. You're a

delegation from Urland, from beyond

Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.

VALERIAN

A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-

blackened.

(pause)

Scales.

ULRICH

All right. How did you come by these?

VALERIAN

(proudly)

I found them. At the mouth of the

lair.

ULRICH

(grim)

What else?

VALERIAN

A claw.

ULRICH

That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the

gods!

ULRICH

And you want me to do battle with

that?

VALERIAN

Who else can we turn to? We all know

what we're dealing with here. This

is a basilicok.

(he takes a step

forward)

A cockatrice.

(another step, bolder)

A dragon.

(he leans close to

Ulrich)

This is no stag, no bear, no natural

creature. This is one of your kind.

And only a necromancer such as

yourself can rid us of it.

ULRICH

Did you try the Meredydd sisters?

What about Rinbod? I've heard it

said he killed a dragon once.

VALERIAN

They're all dead. You're the only

one left.

ULRICH

It's a long way to Urland.

VALERIAN

Every quarter, upon the solstices

and the equinoxes there's a new

victim.

GREIL

My daughter, for one.

OTHER TRAVELERS

My sister... cousins...

ULRICH

All women?

VALERIAN

Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen

by lot.

GALEN

Master, don't you think --

ULRICH

Silence!

VALERIAN

Are you afraid of dragons?

ULRICH

No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a

long long time together. If it weren't

for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any

dragons.

(pause)

All right. I'll go.

CUT TO:

ULRICH

I know of this dragon. Vermithrax

Pejorative: she's four hundred years

old. As far as I can tell she's the

last of her kind. Very appropriate

that I'm the one to finish her off,

don't you think?

(he tries out the

crutches)

There. Flatten the highest mountain.

What say you, Galen?

(no answer)

Speak up.

(still no answer)

You, Hodge.

ULRICH

(to Galen)

While I'm gone see you keep your

nose in your books and your hands

out of my reagents. Leave my

instruments alone too.

GALEN

Look at yourself. How far will you

get like that? A league, two leagues?

ULRICH

I'm not worried about the road.

GALEN

(sarcastic)

Why don't you wave your hands around

and summon up a coach-and-four?

ULRICH

Don't mock me.

GALEN

You pilgrims: You're used to

lotteries. Why not draw straws to

see who'll be first to carry

ironshanks here.

HODGE

Hold your tongue. If the master's

got a mind to go, he'll go.

GALEN

Send me. You're always saying I need

seasoning. I need a test. Let me go.

ULRICH

You're not ready.

GALEN

I'm ready for anything.

ULRICH

(wan smile)

Don't be so hasty. Your time will

come.

VALERIAN

Tyrian!?

TYRIAN

(amiable)

Good morning, all.

VALERIAN

We're not afraid of you. Give us the

road.

TYRIAN

Why, the road is yours. All the way

to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't

it? But when you're in search of a

sorcerer, I suppose no distance is

too great.

ULRICH

(under his breath)

Say nothing.

HODGE

What do you want with us?

TYRIAN

Well, like my good friends here,

I've come for a bit of black magic.

No doubt you've heard of our troubles

at home. This is Cragganmore, is it

not?

HODGE

Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.

TYRIAN

And here we have the mystical presence

himself, no?

HODGE

You'd best keep your distance -- and

your manners.

TYRIAN

If he's ready to lay a dragon in its

grave, he's got nothing to fear from

me.

(turns to the Urlanders)

I've no more love for that creature

than you lot. Nor has the King. But,

before you stir things up, don't you

think it a good idea to see you've

got the right man for the job?

HODGE

Aha -- it's a test you're looking

for. We don't do tests.

TYRIAN

I'm sure you don't. They never do

tests -- and not many real deeds

either. Oh, conversation with your

grandmother's shade in a darkened

room, the odd love potion or two...

but comes a doubter, well then, it's

the wrong day, the planets are not

aligned, the entrails aren't

favorable, we don't do tests.

VALERIAN

We've got no doubts. We require no

test.

HODGE

And you're not going to get one.

ULRICH

(to Galen)

Go to the conjuring room. The iron

box. Fetch me the dagger within.

ULRICH

The dagger. Be quick.

ULRICH

You shall have your test.

ULRICH'S VOICE

(impatient)

Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.

GALEN

Not this one, was it?

ULRICH

The very one. Let it fall.

ULRICH

Vita regula, vita hieratica!

ULRICH

Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt

me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GALEN

Hodge -- what are you doing?

HODGE

Just making my farewell, thank you

very much.

CUT TO:

HODGE

Be careful with that! You don't know

what you're doing.

GALEN

Stand back!

GALEN

Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva

celet!

DISSOLVE:

HODGE

Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we

dwell. It doesn't matter who you

are, a king in his robes, a peasant

in his rags, when your time comes,

no magic can save you...

GALEN

I guess...

HODGE

...the kindest lord a man could ask

for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was

fussy about his bath. And you'd think

he could boil his own eggs with the

snap of a finger, but no, he had old

Hodge do it, of course.

(snurfling)

Up before five I was, mucking out

the cages, slopping the pigs, and

never once got so much as a thankyou

or a pat on the back...

(through tears)

I'm going to miss him.

GALEN

Me too...

HODGE

No you don't. All you care about is

the tricks and knavery. Well, you

don't pull any wool over these old

eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk

before you fill his shoes, you mark

my word.

GALEN

What's the matter, Hodge, pack too

heavy? Here.

HODGE

Careful with that!

GALEN

Too cold, is it?

HODGE

Stop it!

GALEN

Too warm?

HODGE

(spluttering)

Stop it, I say! Out of respect for

the master!

GALEN

I've got as much respect for the

master as anyone, old man. But --

then again, I'm master now.

CUT TO:

GREIL

I left my farm with seeds unplanted,

calves unborn, nothing but a wife to

chase down the strays, and for what?

A funeral, that's what.

GREIL

Because some people said, find a

magician. Not just a local fellow,

an import, a good forty leagues from

home. An all-powerful necromancer.

Ha -- some necromancer!

MALKIN

Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat.

GREIL

I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you

the Great Bear. His tail points east.

It's the equinox. Have you forgotten?

Or rather not think about it?

VALERIAN

(miserable)

He's right. I brought us here for

nothing. May the gods help whoever's

daughter it is tonight.

HODGE

Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be

with you.

GALEN

Easy now. We mean no harm. We've

been looking for you.

GREIL

(growl)

Well, you've found us.

GALEN

(brushing himself off)

More the other way around, I'd say.

VALERIAN

What do you want?

GALEN

A few words, that's all. You were

looking for a conjurer.

VALERIAN

He's dead.

GALEN

Right. Requiscat in pace.

(he takes a deep breath)

Ecce: magister novus!

GREIL

How say you?

GALEN

My lord Ulrich is no longer. All

that you asked of him, you may now

expect of me. The dangers he would

face, I will now conquer. The task

he would undertake I will now fulfill.

I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of

Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I

am the Sorcerer you seek.

GREIL

Well, that's a handsome thought, O

wizard of wizards. But if there's

one thing our friend Tyrian has shown

us, it's to beware the pig in the

poke. Who's got a dagger?

HODGE

No tests!!

GREIL

Call it proof, then.

VALERIAN

We've seen enough tests.

GREIL

Well I haven't. All I've seen is

death. Death in our families, death

on the road, and tonight, death at

home.

VALERIAN

What's come over you, anyway? Have

you lost your wits?

GREIL

I don't like it. Young snot-nose

comes in here for sport at our

expense. We're on a fool's errand,

but we don't have to listen to this.

I don't want to hear any more about

sorcery. I don't want to hear any

more about spells.

VALERIAN

You must be hungry.

GALEN

(nods)

What's the matter with him?

VALERIAN

It's not just him. It's all of us.

It's the equinox.

CUT TO:

HORSRIK

Close enough! Bring her out!

HORSRIK

Now be it known throughout the

kingdom, that this maiden, having

lawfully been chosen by a deed of

fortune and destiny, shall hereby

give up her life for the greater

good of Urland.

HORSRIK

By this act shall be satisfied the

powers that dwell underground and

the spirits that attend thereto. In

gratitude for this sacrifice His

Majesty has declared the family --

what's the name? --

RETAINER

Plowman! The family Plowman!

HORSRIK

(rushing it)

-- the family Plowman to be free of

obligations, taxations, levys and

imposts for a period not to exceed

five years...

HORSRIK

-- ordained and signed this day,

etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the

reigning king of this our realm...

his seal, his mark, duly read by

Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name.

FADE OUT:

MAN

There. I see them.

TYRIAN

Who's that old man?

MAN

Where? Which one?

TYRIAN

That one. That's the man from

Cragganmore. Now what's he doing

here?

MAN

Filling in for the chief, I reckon.

TYRIAN

(weary)

What a pity.

CUT TO:

GALEN

What have you got there?

HODGE

None of your business.

GALEN

A little gold, eh? What do you say I

change it into lead?

HODGE

Save your jokes for someone else.

Me, I don't care for braggarts.

HODGE

And I don't care for frauds.

GALEN

I'm no fraud.

HODGE

Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever

pleases you.

GALEN

Hodge, nobody forced you to come

along.

HODGE

Oh, I'm here of my own free will,

all right. We each do the master's

bidding in our own way.

GALEN

Well, if he told you I needed

wetnursing, why don't you just turn

yourself around and go back home.

HODGE

Home, is it? You've seen to that,

haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say...

GALEN

You're too far behind us. Come on

out.

VALERIAN

You go ahead, I'll catch up.

GALEN

Not a good idea to get separated.

Let's go.

VALERIAN

Right. I'll be along.

VALERIAN

That's all right. Don't come in.

VALERIAN

(edgy)

You better get back to the group,

they're probably worried.

VALERIAN

I prefer to swim alone, if you don't

mind.

GALEN

By the gods!

VALERIAN

Stay away.

VALERIAN

I suppose you'll tell everyone. Go

ahead, I don't care. It's a relief.

GALEN

I'm not going to say anything.

VALERIAN

I don't blame you. I was stupid.

Careless. A silly woman!

GALEN

(feeble bluff)

Take it easy. I knew the moment I

saw you. I've known the whole time.

VALERIAN

You never knew a thing. No one knew.

Not since I was born. Go on, run off

and tell them. It'll make a great

story.

GALEN

Don't worry. No one's going to find

out. Just tell me: why?

VALERIAN

Ask my father.

GALEN

The lottery! Daughters are chosen,

but sons are not!

VALERIAN

That's right. Unless you have plenty

of gold or property.

GALEN

What do you mean?

VALERIAN

If you're rich enough, your name

never goes in.

(bitter)

My father is poor. So are a lot of

fathers.

GALEN

(horrified)

No!

GALEN

No!

GALEN

Hodge!

HODGE

Galen? Can you hear me?

GALEN

I hear you.

HODGE

You know, somebody shot me, but I

can still talk. There's something

that has to be done.

GALEN

I know.

HODGE

Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes.

Here.

HODGE

Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel

it loose.

HODGE

(a croak)

...burning water... find the lake,

throw it in...

GALEN

(holding up the pouch)

What are you doing with this, Hodge?

HODGE

...burning water...

GALEN

Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're

not going to die.

GALEN

Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!

(he shakes the body)

Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!

CUT TO:

GREIL

Urland!

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

Come on. Don't dawdle here.

GALEN

The whole kingdom like this?

VALERIAN

No. We're near the lair. Keep moving.

GALEN

Where?

VALERIAN

Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in

no danger if we just pass through

quickly.

GALEN

I see it. Let's have a look.

VALERIAN

No!

VALERIAN

Greil! Malkin! Help!

GREIL

Look, you don't have to do this. We

know you're a fine young magician.

None better. There's no need to prove

it to us.

GALEN

Are there other entrances?

VALERIAN

No. One's enough.

GREIL

Come on. The road's this way. We'll

tell everybody how close you got.

GALEN

(coolly)

No smoke. How do you know it's in

there?

GREIL

Don't be a fool. Come away now and

live to tell about it.

VALERIAN

Go ahead! You're going to die! What

a fine trick that will be!

GALEN

Now, great mountain, hear my command:

Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum

draconis! Evanescat latibulum

draconis!

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

Father? Hello?

BROTHER JACOPUS

Now are you cleansed of your sins!

Now are you born again, purified in

spirit, into the fellowship of Jesus

Christ!

SIMON

Welcome back, my son.

VALERIAN

Father, what are you doing? Have you

all lost your minds?

SIMON

Some have.

SIMON

It's this monk. He can read and write,

and talk too, I'm afraid.

VALERIAN

And they listen?

SIMON

Shh! They think this a holy place, a

tabernacle.

VALERIAN

This is the granary. What kind of

welcome is this? I've got news of

the sorcerer and news of the dragon.

SIMON

You were brave to go, you and your

friends. But nobody cares. Listen --

he knows what they want to hear.

BROTHER JACOPUS

The man who walks with Christ is not

a man to fear a dragon: Yea, though

I walk through the valley of the

shadow of death I will fear no evil!

You say you are preyed upon by a

foul beast. Yes, but what is the

nature of this beast? It comes to

you on bat's wings and clawed feet,

does it not? It breathes fire, does

it not? And it lives under ground.

This is no dragon. This is Lucifer!

VOICE

Whoever it is, he's dead.

BROTHER JACOPUS

Nay, brother! It is not as easy as

that. Allegiance to Christ, to be

sure, but also prayer and confession.

These are the arms by which Satan

may be put down.

GALEN

You're talking about superstition,

friend. None of that has anything to

do with what I, Galen, have already

achieved.

SIMON

(to Valerian)

You brought this stranger?

VALERIAN

Ulrich's apprentice. He's a braggart,

but it doesn't matter.

GALEN

People of Urland! Send a messenger

to the king. Vermithrax is dead.

Crushed by the power of the moon and

the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom.

Dropped into the Abyss by mystical

practice.

BROTHER JACOPUS

Spoken like a pagan. Every word as

reprobate as it is false!

(holding up his cross)

Solum in hoc signo vinces!

GALEN

Nihil plus mysterium!

CUT TO:

BROTHER JACOPUS

Praise God! Blessed is he that is

humble before the Lord!

VALERIAN

Your god had nothing to do with it.

MALKIN

We saw it with our own eyes. He flew

to the mountain top. He was a bird.

He brought forth lightning. I saw

it.

CUT TO:

SIMON

Put that away. What if you were seen?

VALERIAN

I'm going to be seen. I want to be

seen. Tonight the world finds out

that you never had a son.

SIMON

No, you mustn't do that. It's too

soon. We've got to think about this,

we've got to make a plan.

VALERIAN

Father: the danger is over.

SIMON

I know. What am I going to say to my

friends who still mourn for their

lost girls.

VALERIAN

You'll say you did what you had to.

This is a time for celebration --

and forgiveness.

GALEN

Looks like you've been up to a little

sorcery yourself.

GALEN

Or is it witchcraft?

GALEN

What's the matter? A real woman never

stops talking.

VALERIAN

I think it was much easier being a

boy.

SIMON

The damnedest thing is, she was twice

the man of anyone else in the village.

Now she's twice the woman.

GREIL

(grim)

Would that I had been as clever as

her father.

SIMON

Come now, Greil. Don't begrudge a

life spared.

GREIL

I begrudge nothing. But I wonder at

what we have seen and how it was

done.

SIMON

You were there.

GREIL

I saw what I saw. But this jack-anapes

was barely ready to carry his master's

chamberpot. Isn't it strange that at

the very moment the beast is put

down we should have a holy man here

in the village?

SIMON

You don't believe that superstitious

Christian rot, do you?

GREIL

(defensive)

It is said God works his wonders in

mysterious ways.

TYRIAN

A celebration! Don't stop on my

account. You -- musicians, more music!

TYRIAN

A toast! To the deed of the day! You

see, good news travels fast. The

King himself has already heard it.

And like yourselves, tonight he's

overcome with joy.

MALKIN

What would you have of us then?

TYRIAN

Not a thing. It's this one.

(he gestures toward

Galen)

The King would meet our new benefactor

and offer his gratitude to the man

who succeeded where so many have

failed.

GALEN

(sobering up)

What sort of gratitude? A knife in

the belly? An arrow in the back?

TYRIAN

My young friend, I'd as soon dispatch

you as I did the others, and for the

same reason. But his Majesty would

like a cozy chat, and commands

otherwise.

VALERIAN

Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and

turn them into toads. It should be

easy; that's what they are.

TYRIAN

Well, well: still plenty of cheek

under those skirts, it seems.

GALEN

Don't worry. I'll be back.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GALEN

One of the best things about the

water here in Urland is that there's

so much of it -- look at that!

GALEN

Mmm. Good. But not cold enough.

Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from

his Majesty.

GALEN

I cover the goblet, so... remove,

so... and behold: winter in a mug!

GALEN

All right. How many of you have ever

seen a table fly?

KING

Enough! That's fine.

GALEN

Wait, it'll rise now.

KING

Don't bother. Not necessary.

KING

Tell me: the landslide -- it was

accomplished this same way?

GALEN

Yes.

KING

I see. And having rendered such unique

service to our kingdom, what would

you claim as a reward?

GALEN

Please -- no payment. I have always

found magical practice to be its own

reward. I seek only some yet greater

challenge.

KING

Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?

Of course not, you weren't even born.

He was my brother, a great King and

a valiant man-at-arms. When he

ascended to the throne, the dragon

was unbridled. No one knew where it

might strike next. So he brought

forth his broadsword and his spear,

assembled a company of his best

fighters and went out to do battle.

(pause)

He was never seen again. But his

attack provoked the most terrible

reprisals: whole villages incinerated,

entire crops burned. Death, famine,

horrible.

KING

(quietly)

How did you arrogate to yourself the

role of savior?

GALEN

I was invited.

KING

Not by me. Did you ever consider the

consequences of failure?

GALEN

What failure? What's the matter with

you people? You want the dragon back?

KING

Then the beast is dead?

GALEN

Yes, of course. Dead.

KING

We shall see.

CUT TO:

TYRIAN

Thank you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GALEN

(authoritative)

Cubiculum gravis aperat!

GALEN

Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis

aperat! Asser gravis aperat!

Divinitus!

VOICE

Salve, magistrum iuvenilum.

ELSPETH

I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me

appelo Elspeth, filia regis.

GALEN

How do you do.

ELSPETH

Please don't think ill of us. My

father is a wonderful man, a wise

man. The lottery was his idea.

GALEN

I see.

ELSPETH

You don't understand. From the moment

it began, the dragon was tame. The

kingdom prospered.

GALEN

And only a few had to be sacrificed.

ELSPETH

Yes, that's true. Isn't it better

that a few should die that many might

live?

GALEN

Depends on who does the dying.

ELSPETH

Oh, but we all take our chances. My

father is a just man. My name is

entered on the lists, along with

every other young --

GALEN

Virgin?

ELSPETH

Maiden.

GALEN

If you say so.

ELSPETH

What do you mean?

GALEN

(sighs)

Nothing.

ELSPETH

I've participated in every drawing

since I came of age.

GALEN

Maybe.

ELSPETH

It's true. You don't believe me. You

think I'm lying. Well I'm not.

GALEN

I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families

with money, that sort of thing.

ELSPETH

Don't listen to rumors. They're lies.

I have to go now.

GALEN

Wait -- how long do I have to stay

in here?

ELSPETH

Until we know. Not long. Goodbye.

Vale. Dormi bene.

KING

That's enough. Let's not be greedy

here.

KING

Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby

command thou base metal to change

thy essence and become gold.

ELSPETH

Father?

KING

Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one

bar. We'll try it one at a time.

ELSPETH

Father: did you know that some

families have paid bribes to stay

out of the lottery?

KING

Nonsense. By the power of this amulet,

justly wielded by my hand in

accordance with the laws of Urland,

now lead be thou gold.

KING

I'm burned! What devilish thing is

this?

ELSPETH

Have you ever kept my name off the

lottery list?

KING

That'll be all, Tyrian. You may

withdraw.

KING

Now, my dear, what's troubling you?

ELSPETH

Answer my question: am I not exposed

to the same risk as every other man's

daughter?

ELSPETH

Well?

KING

(finally)

Your father loves you very much.

ELSPETH

(a wail)

It's true! What have you done to

me!?

KING

Who fills your head with such ideas?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TYRIAN

You little meddler! It's alive!

TYRIAN

Close the main gate! Quick!

TYRIAN

There! Stop him!

TYRIAN

Get him! Stab the horse!

KING

Tyrian! Tyrian!

KING

So much for your magic! So much for

your sorcery!

CUT TO:

BROTHER JACOPUS

Listen to me, my brethren. The moment

of our fear is the moment of our

triumph. This is a sign from God.

Follow me, and our faith will send

this creature straight to hell.

GREIL

You call yourselves Christians?

BROTHER JACOPUS

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

want. Thou makest me to lie down in

green pastures. Thy rod and staff

they comfort me...

BROTHER JACOPUS

(firm)

...for Thine is the kingdom and the

power and the glory forever -- amen.

BROTHER JACOPUS

Unclean beast, get thee down! Be

thou consumed by the fires that made

you!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAN

Get away, you little bastard. We've

had enough help from you.

WOMAN

This is your doing!

BURLIES

Get him! He's back!

GALEN

Greil -- help!

GREIL

May the Lord forgive you for what

you have done.

GALEN

It's me. Are you hurt?

VALERIAN

Where have you been? Doesn't matter --

listen: Quick! Make it rain. That'll

put the fire out.

GALEN

I can't.

VALERIAN

Then get the animals back. They're

all running loose. There's people

been hurt. Stop their pain. You can

cure them. And we'll need food...

GALEN

I can't do it.

VALERIAN

(this stops her)

What? Why not?

GALEN

I just can't.

VALERIAN

But you're a sorcerer.

GALEN

I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I

might have had, it's gone.

VALERIAN

It can't be!

GALEN

I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A

fake. I'm sorry...

VALERIAN

You're sorry?! Listen to that! The

damn thing is loose, we're all on

fire and you're sorry!

VALERIAN

You didn't have the faintest idea

what you were doing, did you? You're

a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for

bringing you here.

VALERIAN

I don't want you in this house. Get

out.

FADE OUT:

TYRIAN

Where is he?

VALERIAN

Not here. I can't help you.

VALERIAN

You too?

MALKIN

(returning her look)

Damn right.

TYRIAN

As the proud new father of an eligible

daughter who was some-how overlooked

all these years, it may interest you

to know that the King has called for

a new lottery.

SIMON

But it's months til the solstice.

TYRIAN

In view of what's happened, we all

know what's required.

SIMON

I've never taken part in your cursed

lottery, and I'll have nothing to do

with it now.

TYRIAN

You were very clever. But she'll

take part, like all the rest. No

exceptions.

HENCHMAN

Nothing. If he was here, he's gone

now.

SIMON

All right. I know what you want. How

much?

TYRIAN

Are you offering me a bribe?

SIMON

Yes.

TYRIAN

Don't waste your time.

(pause)

You could never afford it.

GALEN

Smith -- have you ever forged a

weapon?

GALEN

These are your sharpest?

SIMON

Even Tyrian carries one of these.

GALEN

It's sharp -- but it's not sharp

enough.

VALERIAN

Not sharp enough for what?

GALEN

For what I'm going to do with it.

VALERIAN

Nothing's that sharp.

SIMON

The best I ever made.

VALERIAN

It's beautiful.

SIMON

Don't do that!

(he looks at Valerian)

Girl-child, when you were born I

knew I had to do something, so I set

about the task of fashioning an

extraordinary weapon: I had the skill

to make it --

(bleak pause)

-- but not the nerve to use it.

VALERIAN

I'm thankful for that.

(to Galen)

No man should choose a senseless

death.

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

If it's me you're worried about,

don't. So my name has been entered,

what of it? There are hundreds of

girls. My name just won't be drawn.

I know it won't.

GALEN

Valerian, this isn't just for your

sake.

VALERIAN

I don't care. It doesn't matter.

What you want to kill isn't flesh

and blood.

SIMON

Oh, it'll bleed, all right.

VALERIAN

How do you know? No one's so much as

even scratched it.

GALEN

I'll need the amulet.

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

(pointing)

Look at her. The Princess.

GALEN

I know. We've met.

HORSRIK

(reading)

People of Urland: whereas the peace

of the kingdom has been disrupted by

the mischief of an interloper; and

whereas this interloper being fled;

now therefore, his majesty the King

hereby proclaims the sum of thirty

ducats to be paid to anyone producing

the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud

enchanter, to our satisfaction.

CROWD

Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!

CROWD

Bare the arm! Bare the arm!

CROWD

Draw the name! Draw the name!

HORSRIK

Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold,

for I am chosen. I shall die that

many may live. I shall lay down my

life for family and fellows. I shall

go to my grave for the love of our

King and his wise policy. And my

name is --

CROWD

The name! The name!

KING

Read the name.

HORSRIK

(mastering himself)

The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas,

filia regis.

KING

That's not the name. It's been

misread.

VALERIAN

There's no mistake! The name's been

chosen -- let it stand!

KING

No, the good Horsrik has misspoke

himself.

(he looks at the tile)

In fairness to this individual, whose

name I can't make out, we'll destroy

this tile.

VALERIAN

No! What better name than your own

kin? At last we see justice done!

KING

Silence! We will have a new choosing.

I will draw the name myself.

CROWD

Let it stand! Let it stand!

ELSPETH

The name is as you heard it and as

Horsrik read it: Elspeth.

KING

The lottery is invalid. Another and

another. What treachery is this?

ELSPETH

Hear me, good people! It is true,

that my name appears on many of the

lots. This does not falsify the

drawing, it certifies it! I have

learned that my name has been kept

from jeopardy in all the drawings in

the past. So I have put my name among

the rest many times -- once for each

risk that, over the years, you took

and I did not.

KING

Don't go to all that trouble.

GALEN

I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at

least give me a weapon.

TYRIAN

(pushing by the King)

I think not!

KING

Stop! Don't harm him.

(to Galen)

And you -- don't run away... please...

KING

(shaky)

I've always had the greatest

admiration for the black arts. You

chaps with your mysterious spells...

I didn't think it would be necessary,

you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon.

And that, I thought, was the beauty

of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait

her out. I'd live to see the end of

her.

(firm)

That's still going to happen.

TYRIAN

Sire!

KING

He shall have it.

(pleading)

It's my daughter. Save her, I beg

you.

CUT TO:

GREIL

Holy of holies -- he did not die in

vain. Can you hear me, brothers?

MALKIN

(gently)

We hear you, Greil.

GREIL

Well and good, but I'm Greil no

longer. Call me Gregorius, after the

Bishop of Rome.

GREIL

I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus

on the cross he was, scourged by

evil. But he showed no fear. Such is

the power of the Holy Ghost.

GREIL

Of what avail is magic? The old gods

died with our daughters. From whence

comest my help? My help comest from

the Lord!

SIMON

Good and hot.

GALEN

Don't bother. That's not the kind of

fire we need.

GALEN

Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum --

ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SIMON

An edge like no other on this earth.

GALEN

Well done, Simon. Thank you.

SIMON

(grave)

I'll say goodbye to Valerian for

you. I'm sorry she's not here, but

you know how she is.

GALEN

I understand.

SIMON

Fare thee well.

VALERIAN

Galen.

VALERIAN

Here.

VALERIAN

It's a shield. I made it. Might keep

the fire off you. Might not. You

know, you're an idiot. You're going

to die tonight. You'll be ripped

limb from limb. This is the last

time I'll ever speak to you.

GALEN

Thank you.

VALERIAN

(rushing)

Another thing. That thing isn't alone

up there. There's little ones. Young,

I think. I don't know how many.

GALEN

Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed

too. Anything else?

VALERIAN

(tiny voice)

You're in love, aren't you?

GALEN

(slowly nodding)

Yes.

VALERIAN

That's all right. I understand. She's

very beautiful, very brave.

GALEN

Who is? What do you mean?

VALERIAN

Your Princess. But I don't care. It

doesn't change the way I feel.

(firm)

Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn,

sorcerer's apprentice; you're going

to be dead, the dragon will be worse

than ever, there will be more

lotteries, and I'm not a boy any

more.

GALEN

And you'll be eligible because --

VALERIAN

Because I'm still a virgin, and I

want you to do something about it.

GALEN

I am in love. But not with the

Princess.

CUT TO:

HORSRIK

Now be it known throughout the

kingdom, that the Princess, having

been chosen by a deed of fortune and

destiny --

HORSRIK

No fire, I beg you.

GALEN

Be gone!

HORSRIK

(over his shoulder)

I declare these proceedings duly

ordained...

TYRIAN

I knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm

not as sentimental as some. The

kingdom, every one of us, need this

sacrifice. If you intend to interfere,

you'll have to kill me.

GALEN

I've got plenty of reasons to kill

you that have nothing to do with

this sacrifice.

TYRIAN

Most impressive. Can you use it?

ELSPETH

Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right --

it's our only hope!

ELSPETH

Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee!

It's coming!

TYRIAN

In a trice! This is no swords-man.

GALEN

Run! Get out of here!

GALEN

No! Stop! What are you doing?

TYRIAN

You've failed, my friend, and I thank

the gods for it. Come out from behind

that post.

GALEN

Elspeth!

CUT TO:

GALEN

Still alive.

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

You know what we have to do.

(he looks at her with

dull eyes)

We have to leave Urland.

VALERIAN

Not because of what happened. I

brought you here -- it didn't work --

now I'm taking you away. Do you

understand?

(Galen does not react)

You said you loved me. Is it true?

If it is, it's the only good we've

done. Let's not lose that too.

(pause)

Galen?

SIMON

She's right. What kind of a life

could you have here? It's too late

for me, but you're young enough.

(he shows them the

sword)

You know what I think? Magic is dying

out, fading from the world. But that

makes me happy. That means the dragon

will be dying too.

VALERIAN

What's that?

GALEN

Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor

Hodge.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

How's your leg?

GALEN

Hurts. That thing was small, but its

teeth were sharp.

VALERIAN

At least you killed it. You got all

the young.

GALEN

But the big one's alive. Somewhere

down in that burning lake.

VALERIAN

Don't think about it. You had your

fight, and you're still here. That's

more than anyone else can say. Let's

think about what lies ahead.

VALERIAN

What are you doing?

GALEN

You old trickster! The burning water!

The lake of fire!

VALERIAN

Galen, what are you saying?

GALEN

He had it planned. He knew this was

going to happen.

VALERIAN

Who did? What happened?

GALEN

We've got to go back, I want to talk

to him!

VALERIAN

Where are you going?

CUT TO:

GREIL

The Church is mother to us all. Not

just one lonely orphan who has lost

his way, not just a few, but all of

us that believeth in Him. When enough

voices come together in prayer, He

shall hear, we shall live and the

beast shall die.

CUT TO:

VALERIAN

Galen, stop! Please, I beg you!

VALERIAN

Stop! I won't let you kill yourself.

GALEN

He couldn't walk -- he knew he

couldn't make the journey. So he had

us make the journey for him! Don't

you see?

VALERIAN

(pursuing)

No!

VALERIAN

All right, all right. You're going

in there, I'm going too.

GALEN

(brought up short)

What? Why? No you're not, this is my

job. Absolutely not.

VALERIAN

I'm not afraid. And you're not going

to stop me. After all -- I've been a

man longer than you have.

GALEN

Stay close.

VALERIAN

What's that?

GALEN

Never mind. Come on.

GALEN

All right. Wait here.

VALERIAN

Galen? Galen? Where are you?

GALEN

Ex favilla, vita nova!

CUT TO:

GREIL

Be calm. He watcheth over us! And

this is His sign! Let us pray! Our

Father who art in heaven...

CUT TO:

GALEN

Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can

see you! Over here!

ULRICH

(looks at him)

Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know.

ULRICH

Sic redit magus ex terra mortis.

GALEN

Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I

thank the powers that made me!

ULRICH

Glad to see you, too. You didn't

bring along anything to eat, by any

chance?

GALEN

Food?

ULRICH

No? Oh well, no time anyway.

ULRICH

Come along. There's much to be done.

GALEN

Wait, I have something to tell you.

ULRICH

It can wait.

GALEN

No it can't. Listen: I thought I was

a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought

I had power -- but I didn't. I thought

I was you -- but I'm not.

ULRICH

Well said. Now hurry.

ULRICH

Draco draconis...

VALERIAN

Galen!

ULRICH

Where's my amulet? Give it to me,

please.

ULRICH

Be quick!

ULRICH

Come close to me.

ULRICH

Don't be afraid. You have served me

with great courage. Now you must

show me you have even more.

GALEN

Anything!

ULRICH

You must destroy the amulet, and me

along with it.

GALEN

No!

ULRICH

You brought me from the flames, you

must send me back.

GALEN

I can't.

ULRICH

When the time comes, you'll

understand. Here.

ULRICH

I know what you're thinking. You

have learned much and done well.

Don't worry, you won't need it any

more.

CUT TO:

GREIL

Make haste, brother.

GREIL

Now be thou baptized in the name of

the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May

the Lord our God light our way.

CUT TO:

ULRICH

Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!

VALERIAN

Here. Do as he said. Smash it.

GALEN

Not if it means killing him.

VALERIAN

You heard what he said.

GALEN

No! You can't!

ULRICH

Galen!

DISSOLVE:

GREIL

Let us pray.

GREIL

We thank thee, Lord, for this divine

deliverance. Verily is thy presence

amongst us, fully manifest in this,

thy great work.

GREIL

Arise, children of the Lord and

forsake evermore the pagan mysteries.

Rejoice in the true power of the

Christian God!

DISSOLVE:

HORSRIK

(loud)

All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon

slayer!

HORSRIK

(nodding)

Hail and praise be!

DISSOLVE:

VALERIAN

You want to rest?

GALEN

No. I'm fine.

VALERIAN

You miss Ulricn.

GALEN

Yes.

VALERIAN

And the amulet.

GALEN

That too.

VALERIAN

Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad

you did what you did.

(he doesn't reply)

You may not be a sorcerer, Galen,

but I love you anyway. I don't regret

anything that happened. I just wish --

GALEN

Yes?

VALERIAN

(sighs)

-- that we had a horse.

VALERIAN

What is this?

GALEN

A horse.

VALERIAN

Did you...!?

GALEN

No. It must have been wandering loose.

Or wild.

VALERIAN

Wait a minute. I just wished for a

horse and here it is.

GALEN

You don't want to wish it gone, do

you?

FADE OUT:

THE END
