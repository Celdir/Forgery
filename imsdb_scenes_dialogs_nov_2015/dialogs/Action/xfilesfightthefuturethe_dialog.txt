CUT TO:

2ND BOY

Hey, Stevie. You okay?

STEVIE

I got...I got....I got....

(straining)

....the wind knocked out of me.

3RD BOY

Looks like a cave or something.

2ND BOY

What's down there, Stevie? Anything?

STEVIE

Human skull.

3RD BOY

Toss it up here, dude.

STEVIE

No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's

mine.

STEVIE

Anyways, there's bones all over the

place down here.

3RD BOY (O.S.)

Hey, Stevie....

2ND BOY

You okay?

3RD BOY

Hey, man. Let's get outta here.

FIRE CAPTAIN

This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've

got a rescue situation in progress...

TIME CUT TO:

BRONSCHWEIG

(over the chopper)

Keep those people back. Get them out

of here.

FIRE CAPTAIN

(to his men)

Move them all back.

(dogging Bronschweig)

I sent four men down after the boy.

They're not responding.

FIRE CAPTAIN

What about my men?

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

(brusquely)

We're doing all we can.

FBI AGENT

We've evacuated the building and been

through it bottom to top. No trace of

an explosive device or anything

resembling one.

S.A.C. MICHAUD

Have you taken the dogs through?

FBI AGENT

Yes, sir.

S.A.C. MICHAUD

Well, take them through again.

SCULLY

Mulder -- it's me --

MULDER (FILTER)

Where are you, Scully?

SCULLY

I'm on the roof.

MULDER (FILTER)

Did you find something?

SCULLY

(impatiently)

No. I haven't.

MULDER (FILTER)

What's wrong, Scully?

SCULLY

I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm

hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to

be honest, what I'm doing here.

MULDER (FILTER)

You're looking for a bomb.

SCULLY

I know that. But the threat was called

in for the Federal Building across the

street.

MULDER (FILTER)

I think they have that covered.

SCULLY

(impatience)

Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat

is called in, the logical purpose of

providing this information is to allow

us to find the bomb. The rational

object of terrorism is to promote

terror. If you'd study model

behavioral pattern in virtually every

case where a threat has turned up an

explosive device. If we don't act in

accordance with that data -- if you

ignore it as we have done -- the

chances are great that if here

actually is a bomb we might not find

it. Lives could be lost --

SCULLY

Mulder...?

MULDER

What happened to playing a hunch?

SCULLY

Jesus, Mulder...

MULDER

The element of surprise, Scully.

Random acts of unpredictability. If we

fail to anticipate the unforeseen or

expect the unexpected in a universe of

infinite possibilities, we find

ourselves at the mercy of anyone or

anything that cannot be programmed,

categorized or easily referenced...

MULDER

What are we doing up here? It's hotter

than hell.

SCULLY

I know you're bored in this

assignment, but unconventional

thinking is only going to get you into

trouble now.

MULDER

How's that?

SCULLY

You've got to quit looking for what

isn't there. They've closed the

X-Files. There's procedure to be

followed here. Protocol.

MULDER

What do you say we call in a bomb

threat for Houston. I think it's free

beer night at the Astrodome.

SCULLY

Now what?

MULDER

(suddenly nervous)

It's locked?

SCULLY

So much for anticipating the

unforeseen...

SCULLY

Had you.

MULDER

No you didn't.

SCULLY

Oh yeah. Had you big time.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

I saw your face, Mulder. There was a

moment of panic.

MULDER

Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,

Scully?

SCULLY

I just did. You're buying.

MULDER

Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?

A saline IV?

SCULLY

Something sweet.

CUT TO:

MULDER

Oh, come on.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

Scully...

MULDER (FILTER)

Scully, I found the bomb.

SCULLY

(thinks he's joking)

Where are you, Mulder?

MULDER (FILTER)

I'm in the vending room.

SCULLY

Is that you pounding?

MULDER

Scully, get somebody to open this

door.

SCULLY (FILTER)

Nice try, Mulder.

MULDER

Scully -- listen to me. It's in the

coke machine. You've got about

fourteen minutes to get this building

evacuated.

SCULLY

C'mon. Open the door.

SCULLY

Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.

MULDER (FILTER)

Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty

eight, thirteen fifty seven...

MULDER

...thirteen fifty six...

SCULLY (FILTER)

Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of

there.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

I need this building evacuated and

cleared out in ten minutes! I need you

to get on the phone and tell the fire

department to block off the city

center in one mile radius around the

building --

SECURITY GUARD

In ten minutes.....?!

SCULLY

DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE

AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!

SCULLY

(into phone)

This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I

need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's

got the wrong building --

CUT TO:

S.A.C. MICHAUD

Where is it?

SCULLY

Mulder found it in a vending machine.

He's locked in with it.

CUT TO:

MULDER

Scully?

SCULLY (FILTER)

Mulder. Move away from the door. We're

coming through it.

CUT TO:

S.A.C. MICHAUD

Go.

MULDER

Tell me this is just soda pop in those

canisters.

S.A.C. MICHAUD

No. It's what it looks like. A big

I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite.

(studying the bomb)

Okay, get everybody out of here and

clear the building.

MULDER

Somebody's got to stay with you --

S.A.C. MICHAUD

I gave you an order. Now get the hell

out of here and evacuate the area.

SCULLY

Can you defuse it?

S.A.C. MICHAUD

I think so.

MULDER

You've got about four minutes to find

out if you're wrong.

S.A.C. MICHAUD

Did you hear what I said?

SCULLY

Let's go, Mulder.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

What are you doing?

(off his non-response)

Mulder --

LAST AGENT OUT

All clear.

MULDER

Something's wrong.

WINDBREAKERED AGENT

What's he doing?

MULDER

Something's not right...

SCULLY

-- Mulder! Get in the car!

SCULLY

There's no time!

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

CUT BACK TO:

HARD CUT BACK

TO:

MULDER

(with darkest irony)

Next time you're buying.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge...

CUT TO:

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

...there is a heightened need at the

Attorney General's office to place

responsibility as early as possible.

CASSIDY

...for the catastrophic destruction of

public property and the loss of life

due to terrorist activities...

CASSIDY

Many details are still unclear; some

agents' reports have not been filed,

or have come in sketchy, without a

satisfactory accounting of the events

that led to the destruction in Dallas.

But we're under some pressure to give

an accurate picture of what happened

to the Attorney General, so she can

issue a public statement.

CASSIDY

We now know that five people died in

the explosion. Special Agent in Charge

Darius Michaud who was trying to

defuse the bomb that had been hidden

in a vending machine. Three firemen

from Dallas, and a young boy.

MULDER

Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy

-- they were in the building?

CASSIDY

Agent Mulder, since you weren't able

to be on time for this hearing, I'm

going to ask you to step outside so

that we can get Agent Scully's version

of the facts. So that she won't have

to be paid the same disrespect.

MULDER

We were told the building was clear.

CASSIDY

You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder.

Please step out.

MULDER

It does say there in your paperwork

that we were the ones who found the

bomb...

CASSIDY

Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call

you in shortly.

CUT TO:

SKINNER

Sit down, they're still talking to

Agent Scully.

MULDER

About what?

SKINNER

-- They're asking her for a narrative.

They want to know why she was in the

wrong building.

MULDER

She was with me.

SKINNER

You don't see what's going on here, do

you?

(off Mulder's look)

There's four hundred million dollars

in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives

have been lost. No suspects have been

named. So the story being shaped is

this could have been prevented. That

the FBI didn't do its job.

MULDER

And they want to blame us?

SKINNER

Agent Mulder -- we both know that if

you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the

initiative to search the adjacent

building, you could have multiplied

the fatalities by a hundred --

MULDER

(grasping the irony)

But it's not the lives we saved. It's

the lives we didn't.

SKINNER

(reciting the dictum)

-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the

FBI --

MULDER

-- if they want someone to blame,

they can blame me. Agent Scully

doesn't deserve this.

SKINNER

She's in there right now saying the

same thing about you.

MULDER

I breached protocol. I broke contact

with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary

tactical rule and left him alone with

the device.

SKINNER

Agent Scully says it was she who

ordered you out of the building. That

you wanted to go back.

SCULLY

(to Skinner)

They're asking for you, Sir.

MULDER

Whatever you told them in there, you

don't have to protect me.

SCULLY

All I told them was the truth.

MULDER

They're trying to divide us on this,

Scully. We can't let them.

SCULLY

They have divided us, Mulder. They're

splitting us up.

MULDER

(beat)

What? What are you talking about?

SCULLY

I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow

for remediation and reassignment...

MULDER

Why?

SCULLY

I think you must have an idea. They

cited a history of problems relating

back to 1993.

MULDER

They were the ones that put us

together.

SCULLY

Because they wanted me to invalidate

your work, your investigations into

the paranormal. But I think this goes

deeper than that.

MULDER

This isn't about you, Scully. They're

doing this to me.

SCULLY

They're not doing this, Mulder.

(off his look)

I left behind a career in medicine

because I thought I might make a

difference at the FBI. When they

recruited me they told me women made

up nine percent of the bureau. I felt

this was not an impediment, but an

opportunity to distinguish myself. But

it hasn't turned out that way. And

now, if I were to be transferred to

Omaha, or Wichita or some field office

where I'm sure I could rise, it just

doesn't hold the interest for me it

once did. Not after what I've seen and

done.

MULDER

You're... quitting?

SCULLY

There's really no reason left for me

to stay anymore.

(off his look)

Maybe you should ask yourself if your

heart's still in it, too.

SKINNER

Agent Mulder. You're up.

SCULLY

(regretfully)

I'm sorry. Good luck.

CUT TO:

BARMAID

I'd say this about exceeds your

minimum daily requirement.

BARMAID

Gotta train for this kind of heavy

lifting.

BARMAID

Poopy day?

MULDER

Yup.

BARMAID

A woman?

(Mulder shakes his head no)

Work.

BARMAID

What do you do?

MULDER

What do I do.

(off her curious look)

I'm a key figure in an ongoing

government charade. An annoyance to my

superiors. A joke among my peers.

"Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder.

Whose sister was abducted by aliens

when he was a kid. Who now chases

little green men with a badge and a

gun, shouting to the heavens and

anyone who'll listen that the fix is

in. That our government's hip to the

truth and a part of the conspiracy.

That the sky is falling and when it

hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of

all time.

BARMAID

I think that about does it, Spooky.

MULDER

Does what?

BARMAID

Why don't you go home to the old lady

--

MULDER

Sorry. Don't have one.

WATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE

That official FBI business?

MULDER

(startled)

What?

KURTZWEIL

Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the

same thing in Dallas.

MULDER

How's that?

KURTZWEIL

Standing around holding your yank

while bombs are exploding.

MULDER

Do I know you?

KURTZWEIL

No. I've been watching your career for

a good while. Back when you were just

a promising young agent -- before

that.

MULDER

You follow me out here for a reason?

KURTZWEIL

Yeah, I did.

KURTZWEIL

My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin

Kurtzweil.

MULDER

I know the name. Why?

KURTZWEIL

Old friend of your father's.

KURTZWEIL

Back at the Department of State. We

were what you might call fellow

travelers, but his disenchantment

outlasted mine.

(beat)

I never believed in the Project.

KURTZWEIL

Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't

know about the Project. Your father

died for it. Your sister was taken

because of it.

CUT TO:

MULDER

How'd you find me?

KURTZWEIL

Heard you come here now and again.

Figured you'd be needing a little

drinky tonight.

MULDER

You a reporter?

KURTZWEIL

I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned

that. OB-GYN.

MULDER

Who sent you?

KURTZWEIL

I came on my own. After reading about

the bombing in Dallas.

MULDER

Well, if you've got something to tell

me, you've got as long as it takes me

to hail a cab...

KURTZWEIL

They're going to pin Dallas on you,

Agent Mulder. But there was nothing

you could've done. Nothing anyone

could've done to prevent that bomb

from going off. Because the truth is

something you'd never have guessed;

never have predicted.

MULDER

And what's that?

KURTZWEIL

S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or

intended to defuse the bomb.

MULDER

(rhetorical disbelief)

He just let it explode.

KURTZWEIL

What's the question nobody's asking?

Why that building? Why not the Federal

Building?

MULDER

The Federal Building was too well

guarded.

KURTZWEIL

No. They put the bomb in the building

across the street because it DID have

federal offices. The Federal Emergency

Management Agency had a provisional

medical quarantine office there. Which

is where the bodies were found. But

that's the thing...

KURTZWEIL

...the thing you didn't know. That

you'd never think to check.

KURTZWEIL

Those people were already dead.

MULDER

Before the bomb went off?

KURTZWEIL

That's what I'm saying.

MULDER

Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran

of the bureau --

KURTZWEIL

Michaud was a patriot. The men he's

loyal to know their way around Dallas.

They blew that building to hide

something. Maybe something even they

couldn't predict.

MULDER

You're saying they destroyed an entire

building to hide the bodies of three

firemen...?

KURTZWEIL

And one little boy.

MULDER

I think you're full of shit.

KURTZWEIL

Do you?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MULDER

(strangely intense)

I wake you?

SCULLY

No.

MULDER

Why not? It's three AM.

SCULLY

Are you drunk, Mulder?

MULDER

I was until about an hour ago.

SCULLY

Is that before or after you got the

idea to come here?

MULDER

What are you implying, Scully?

SCULLY

(frowning)

I thought you may have gotten drunk

and decided to come here to talk me

out of quitting.

MULDER

Is that what you'd like me to do?

SCULLY

Go home, Mulder. It's late.

MULDER

Get dressed, Scully.

SCULLY

Mulder -- what are you doing?

MULDER

Just get dressed. I'll explain on the

way.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

You've got something to show me.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

(nervous excitement)

Yes.

CUT TO:

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

We brought the atmosphere back down to

freezing in order to control the

development, which is nothing like

we've ever seen.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Brought on by what?

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Heat, I think. The coincident invasion

of a host, the fireman, and an

environment that raised his basic body

temperature above ninety eight point

six.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

This man's still alive.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Technically and biologically, though

he'll never recover.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

How can this be?

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

The developing organism is using his

life energy, digesting bone and

tissue. We've just slowed the

process.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Do you want me to destroy this one,

too? Before it gestates?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

No. No...we need to try our vaccine on

it.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

And if it's unsuccessful?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Incinerate it. Like the others.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

This man's family will want to see the

body laid to rest.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Tell them he was trying to save the

young boy's life, and that he died

heroically like the other firemen.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Of what?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

They seemed to buy our story about the

Hanta virus. You'll make sure the

families are taken care of

financially, along with a sizeable

donation to the community.

(beat)

Maybe a small roadside memorial.

CUT TO:

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

ID and floor you're visiting.

MULDER

We're going to the morgue.

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

That area is currently off limits to

anyone other than authorized medical

personnel.

MULDER

On whose orders?

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

General McAddie's.

MULDER

General McAddie is who requested our

coming here. We were awakened at three

AM and told to get down here

immediately.

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

I don't know anything about that.

MULDER

Well, call General McAddie.

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

I don't have his number.

MULDER

They can patch you in through the

switchboard.

MULDER

Hey! We don't have time to dick around

here watching you demonstrate your

ignorance in the chain of command. The

order came direct from General

McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our

business while you confirm

authorization.

YOUNG NAVAL GUARD

(to their backs)

Why don't you go on ahead head and

I'll confirm authorization.

MULDER

Thank you.

MULDER

Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on

orders of a general?

CUT TO:

SCULLY

This is one of the firemen who died in

Dallas?

MULDER

According to this tag.

SCULLY

And you're looking for?

SCULLY

I can tell you that without even

looking at him.

(off Mulder's look)

Conclusive organ failure due to

proximal exposure to source and flying

debris.

SCULLY

This body has already been autopsied,

Mulder. You can tell from the way it's

been wrapped and dressed.

MULDER

Does this fit the description you just

read me, Scully?

SCULLY

Oh my God. This man's tissue...

MULDER

It's like jelly.

SCULLY

There's some kind of cellular

breakdown. It's completely edematous.

SCULLY

And there's been no autopsy performed.

There's no Y incision here; no

internal exam.

MULDER

You're telling me the cause of death

on the report is false. That this man

didn't die from an explosion, or from

flying debris.

SCULLY

I don't know what killed this man. I'm

not sure if anybody else could claim

to either.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

(pushing him)

You knew this man didn't die at the

bomb site before we got here.

MULDER

I'd been told as much.

SCULLY

You're saying the bombing was a

cover-up. Of what?

MULDER

I don't know. But I have a hunch what

you're going to find here isn't

anything that can be categorized or

easily referenced.

SCULLY

Mulder, this is going to take some

time, and somebody's going to figure

out soon enough we're not even

supposed to be here.

(beat)

I'm in serious violation of medical

ethics.

MULDER

We're being blamed for these deaths.

Scully, I want to know what this man

died of. Don't you?

CUT TO:

MULDER

(to the Cabbie)

I think this is it up here.

MULDER

Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?

DETECTIVE

(suspiciously)

You got some kind of business with

him?

MULDER

I'm looking for him.

DETECTIVE

Looking for him for what?

DETECTIVE

(to his partners)

Feds are looking for him, too.

(turns to Mulder)

Real nice business he's got, huh?

MULDER

What's that?

DETECTIVE

Selling naked pictures of little kids

over his computer.

DETECTIVE

You looking for him for some other

reason?

MULDER

Yeah, I had an appointment for a

pelvic examination.

DETECTIVE

You want a call if we turn up

Kurtzweil?

MULDER

No. Don't bother.

KURTZWEIL

See this bullshit...? Somebody knows

I'm talking to you.

MULDER

Not according to the men in blue.

KURTZWEIL

What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual

battery of a patient? I've had my

license taken away in three states.

MULDER

They want to discredit you -- for

what?

KURTZWEIL

For what? Because I'm a dangerous man.

Because I know too much about the

truth.

MULDER

You mean that apocalyptic trash you

write? I knew your name was familiar.

I just didn't know why.

KURTZWEIL

You know my work?

MULDER

(pointedly)

Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in

bigoted ideas about race or genocide.

I don't believe in the Elders of Zion,

the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg

Group or in a oneworld Jew run

government --

KURTZWEIL

I don't either, but it sure sells

books.

KURTZWEIL

I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I,

Agent Mulder?

MULDER

How?

KURTZWEIL

I picked up the historical document of

the venality and hypocrisy of the

American government. The daily

newspaper.

MULDER

You said the firemen and the boy were

found in the temporary offices of the

Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Why?

KURTZWEIL

According to the newspaper, FEMA had

been called out to manage an outbreak

of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar

with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?

MULDER

It was a deadly virus spread by field

mice in the Southwest U.S. several

years ago.

KURTZWEIL

And are you familiar with FEMA? What

the Federal Emergency Management

Agency's real power is? FEMA allows

the White House to suspend

constitutional government upon

declaration of a national emergency.

To create a non-elected government.

Think about that.

(beat)

What is an agency with such broad

sweeping power doing managing a small

viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

MULDER

Are you saying it wasn't such a small

outbreak?

KURTZWEIL

I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

MULDER

What was it?

KURTZWEIL

When we were young men in the

military, your father and I were

recruited for a project. They told us

it was biological warfare. A virus.

There were rumors about its origins.

MULDER

What killed those men?

KURTZWEIL

What killed them I won't even write

about. I tell you, they'd do more than

just harass me. They have the future

to protect.

MULDER

I'll know soon enough.

KURTZWEIL

(worked up)

What killed those men can't be

identified in simple medical terms. My

god, we can't even wrap our minds

around something as obvious as HIV.

We have no context for what killed

those men, or any appreciation of the

scale in which it will be unleashed in

the future. Of how it will be

transmitted; of the environmental

factors involved.

MULDER

A plague?

KURTZWEIL

The plague to end all plagues, Agent

Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet

war. The systematic release of an

indiscriminate organism for which the

men who will bring it on still have no

cure. They've been working on this for

fifty years. While the rest of the

world was fighting gooks and commies

these men have been secretly

negotiating a planned Armageddon.

MULDER

Negotiating with whom?

KURTZWEIL

I think you know. The timetable has

been set. It will happen on a holiday,

when people are away from their homes.

When our elected officials are at

their resorts or out of the country.

The President will declare a state of

emergency, at which time all federal

agencies, all government will come

under the power of the Federal

Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,

Agent Mulder. The secret government.

MULDER

And they tell me I'm paranoid.

KURTZWEIL

Something's gone wrong -- something

unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and

dig. Or you're only going to find out

like the rest of the country, Agent

Mulder. When it's too late.

MULDER

How can I reach you?

KURTZWEIL

You can't.

MULDER

No calling Hawaii.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MULDER'S VOICE (FILTER)

Scully...?

SCULLY

(low whisper)

Yeah.

MULDER

Why are you whispering?

SCULLY

I can't really talk right now.

MULDER

What did you find?

SCULLY

Evidence of a massive infection.

MULDER

What kind of infection?

SCULLY

I don't know.

MULDER

Scully -- listen to me. I'm going

home, then I'm booking a flight to

Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket,

too.

SCULLY

Mulder --

MULDER

I need you there with me. I need your

expertise on this. The bomb we found

was meant to destroy those bodies and

whatever they were infected by.

SCULLY

I've got a hearing tomorrow --

MULDER

-- I'll have you back for it, Scully.

Maybe with evidence that could blow

that meeting away.

SCULLY

Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way

past the point of common sense here

--

CUT TO:

MULDER

Scully...? Hello...?

CUT TO:

FIELD AGENT

You're looking for what amounts to a

needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the

explosion was so devastating there

hasn't been a whole lot we've been

able to put together just yet.

MULDER

I'm looking for anything out of the

ordinary. Maybe something from the

FEMA offices where the bodies were

found.

FIELD AGENT

We weren't expecting to find those

remains, of course. They went right

off to Washington.

MULDER

Was there anything in those offices

that didn't go to D.C.?

FIELD AGENT

Some bone fragments came up in the

sift this morning. We thought there'd

been another fatality, but we found

out FEMA had recovered them from an

archeological site out of town.

MULDER

Have you examined them?

FIELD AGENT

No. Just fossils, far as I know.

MULDER

I'd like this person to take a look,

if you don't mind.

FIELD AGENT

Let me just see if I can lay my hands

on what you're looking for.

MULDER

You said you weren't coming?

SCULLY

I wasn't planning on it. Particularly

after spending a half hour in cold

storage this morning. But I got a

better look at the blood and tissue

samples I took from the firemen.

MULDER

What did you find?

SCULLY

(voice lowering pointedly)

Something I couldn't show to anyone

else. Not without more information.

And not without causing the kind of

attention I'd just as soon avoid right

now.

(off Mulder's look)

The virus those men were infected with

contains a protein coat I've never

seen before. What it did to them it

did extremely fast. And unlike the

AIDS virus or any other aggressive

strain, it survives very nicely

outside the body.

MULDER

How was it contracted?

SCULLY

That I don't know. But if it's through

simple contact of blood to blood, and

if it doesn't respond to conventional

treatments, it could be a serious

health threat.

FIELD AGENT

Like I said, these are fossils, and

they weren't near the blast center, so

they aren't going to tell you much.

SCULLY

May I?

MULDER

You said you knew the location of the

archeological site where these were

found.

FIELD AGENT

Show you right on a map.

CUT TO:

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

I need to have those settings checked

and re-set. I need a steady minus two

Celsius through the transfer of the

body, after I administer the vaccine.

INTERCUT WITH:

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

It's gone!

TECHNICIAN

It's what?

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

It's left the body. I think it's

gestated --

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Wait -- I see it --

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

(nervous wonder)

Oh my god. Oh my god.

TECHNICIAN

You see it?

DR. BRONSCHWEIG

Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get

down here --

(sotto to himself)

Jesus Lord...so much for little green

men.

Hey!

VALET'S VOICE

Sir -- you have a call.

CUT TO:

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Yes.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

(FILTER)

We have a situation. The members are

assembling.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Is it an emergency?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in

London, to determine a course.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Who called this meeting?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane

in Tunis.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Has Strughold arrived?

VALET

They're in the library.

STRUGHOLD

We began to worry. Some of us have

traveled so far, and you are the last

to arrive.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke

his leg.

STRUGHOLD

While we've been made to wait, we've

watched surveillance tapes which have

raised more concerns.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

More concerns than that?

STRUGHOLD

We've been forced to reassess our role

in Colonization by new facts of

biology which have presented

themselves.

GROUP ELDER

(speaking up)

The virus has mutated.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

On its own?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Its effect on the host has changed.

The virus no longer just invades the

brain as a controlling organism. It's

developed a way to modify the host

body.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Into what?

STRUGHOLD

A new extraterrestrial biological

entity.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

My god...

STRUGHOLD

The geometry of mass infection

presents certain conceptual

re-evaluations for us. About our place

in their Colonization.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

This isn't Colonization, it's

spontaneous repopulation. All our

work... if it's true, then they've

been using us all along. We've been

laboring under a lie!

2ND ELDER

It could be an isolated case.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

How can we know?!

STRUGHOLD

We're going to tell them what we've

found. What we've learned. Turn over a

body infected with the gestating

organism.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

In hope of what? Learning that it's

true?! That we are nothing more than

digestives for the creation of a new

race of alien lifeforms?!

STRUGHOLD

Let me remind you who is the new race.

And who is the old.

(beat)

What could be gained by withholding

anything from them; By pretending to

ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall

their plans to step up the timetable.

To start Colonization early.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

And if it doesn't? By cooperating now

we're but beggars to our demise! Our

ignorance was in cooperating with the

Colonists at all.

STRUGHOLD

Cooperation is our only chance of

saving ourselves.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

They still need us to carry out their

preparations.

STRUGHOLD

We'll continue to use them as they do

us. If only to play for more time, to

continue work on our vaccine.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Our vaccine may have no effect!

STRUGHOLD

Well, without a cure for the virus,

we're nothing more than digestives

anyway.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

My lateness may have well been

absence. A course has already been

taken.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

There are complications.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Do they know?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Mulder was in Dallas when we were

trying to dispose of evidence. He's

gone back there again. Someone has

tipped him.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Who?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

Kurtzweil, we think.

STRUGHOLD

We've allowed this man his freedom.

His books have actually helped us to

facilitate plausible denial. Has he

outlived his usefulness to us?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

No one believes Kurtzweil or his

books. He's a toiler. A crank.

STRUGHOLD

And Mulder?

ELDER

Our new situation makes us vulnerable.

If he learns information as we do, he

could jeopardize the Project's

secrecy.

2ND ELDER

Control of information means control

of Mulder.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

I can control Mulder. I've always

controlled Mulder.

STRUGHOLD

This may take another approach.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

You can't kill Mulder. He's got too

much light on him.

STRUGHOLD

You need not kill a man to destroy

him.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

(personalizing the

inference)

No, you need only take away what is

most precious to him.

HARD CUT TO:

SCULLY

I don't know, Mulder...

SCULLY

He didn't mention a park.

MULDER

This is where he marked on the map,

Scully. Where he says those fossils

were unearthed.

SCULLY

I don't see any evidence of an

archeological or any other kind of

digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm

drain.

MULDER

You're sure the fossils you looked at

showed the same signs of deterioration

you saw in the fireman's body in the

morgue?

SCULLY

(nodding)

The bone was porous, as if the virus

of the causative microbe were

digesting it.

MULDER

And you've never seen anything like

that?

SCULLY

No.  It didn't show up on any of the

immunohistochemical tests --

MULDER

This looks like new grass to you?

SCULLY

It looks pretty green for this

climate.

MULDER

Ground's dry about an inch down.

Somebody just laid this down. Very

recently, I'd say.

SCULLY

(looking off)

All the equipment is brand new.

MULDER

No irrigation system. Somebody's

covering their tracks.

MULDER

Hey!

SCULLY

Do you live around here?

2ND BOY

Yeah.

MULDER

You see anybody digging here?

2ND BOY

Not supposed to talk about it.

SCULLY

You're not supposed to talk about it?

Who told you that?

3RD BOY

Nobody.

MULDER

Nobody. Same nobody who put this park

in? That new equipment...

(off the boys guilty looks)

They buy you these bikes?

SCULLY

I think you better tell us.

2ND BOY

We don't even know you.

SCULLY

Well, we're FBI agents.

2ND BOY

You're not FBI agents.

MULDER

How do you know?

2ND BOY

Cause FBI agents wear like suits and

goofy ties. And dresses like my mom

wears to church. Like on that one

show.

MULDER

Maybe you've been watching too much

TV.

3RD BOY

They all left twenty minutes ago.

4TH BOY

Going that way.

CUT TO:

MULDER

Unmarked tanker trucks... what are

archaeologists hauling out in tanker

trucks?

SCULLY

I don't know, Mulder.

MULDER

And where are they going with it?

SCULLY

That's the first question to answer,

if we're going to find them.

CUT BACK TO:

MULDER

What are my choices?

SCULLY

About a hundred miles of nothing in

each direction.

MULDER

Where would they be going?

SCULLY

We've got two choices. One of them is

wrong.

MULDER

You think they went left?

SCULLY

I don't know why I think they went

right.

MULDER

Five years together -- how many times

have I been wrong.

DISSOLVE TO:

MULDER

Hey, I was right about the bomb,

wasn't I?

SCULLY

This is great. This is fitting.

MULDER

What?

SCULLY

I've got to be in Washington D.C. in

eleven hours for a hearing -- the

outcome of which might possibly affect

one of the biggest decisions of my

life. And here I am standing out in

the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing

phantom tanker trucks.

MULDER

We're not chasing trucks, we're

chasing evidence --

SCULLY

-- of what exactly?!

MULDER

That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go

off, to hide something: bodies

infected with a virus you detected

yourself.

SCULLY

They haul gas in tanker trucks, they

haul oil in tanker trucks -- they

don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.

MULDER

Yeah, well they may this one.

SCULLY

What do you mean by haul?

(off his reaction)

What are you not telling me here?

MULDER

This virus -- it...

(afraid to say)

SCULLY

Mulder --

MULDER

It may be extraterrestrial.

SCULLY

I don't believe this. I don't fucking

believe this.

(reaching her limit of

impatience)

Y'know, I've been here... I've been

here one too many times with you,

Mulder.

MULDER

Been where?

SCULLY

Pounding down some dirt road in the

middle of the night. Chasing some

elusive truth on a dim hope, only to

find myself standing right where I am

right now: at another dead end --

DISSOLVE TO:

SCULLY

What do you think it is?

MULDER

I have no idea.

CUT TO:

SCULLY

This is weird, Mulder.

MULDER

Very weird.

SCULLY

Any thoughts on why anybody'd be

growing corn in the middle of the

desert?

MULDER

Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop

containers out there.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SCULLY

Cool in here. Temperature's being

regulated.

MULDER

For the purpose of what?

SCULLY

I think we're on top of something. I

think these are some kind of venting.

MULDER

You hear that?

SCULLY

I hear the humming. Like electricity.

High voltage maybe.

MULDER

Maybe. Maybe not.

SCULLY

What do you think those are for?

CUT TO:

MULDER

Scully....?

SCULLY

Yeah...?

MULDER

Run.

SCULLY

(yelling, on the run)

What are you doing?

MULDER

(yelling back)

Come on!

SCULLY

Mulder?!

MULDER

Scully?!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MULDER

Scully?!

SCULLY

(distant o.s.)

Mulder!

SCULLY

Where'd they go?

MULDER

I don't know.

DISSOLVE TO:

SKINNER

She's coming in.

INTERCUT WITH:

CASSIDY

Special Agent Scully --

SCULLY

I apologize for making you wait --

I've brought some new evidence with me

--

CASSIDY

Evidence of what?

SCULLY

These are fossilized bone fragments

I've been able to study, gathered from

the bomb site in Dallas...

CASSIDY

You've been back to Dallas?

SCULLY

Yes.

CASSIDY

Are you going to let us in on what

exactly you're trying to prove --

SCULLY

That the bombing in Dallas may have

been to destroy the bodies of those

firemen, so their deaths and the

reason for them wouldn't have to be

explained --

CASSIDY

(challenging)

-- those are very serious allegations,

Agent Scully --

SCULLY

Yes. I know.

CASSIDY

And you have conclusive evidence of

this? Something to tie this claim of

yours to the crime --

SCULLY

(grudgingly)

Nothing completely conclusive --

SCULLY

I hope to. We're working to develop

this evidence --

CASSIDY

Working with?

SCULLY

Agent Mulder.

CUT TO:

KURTZWEIL

You found something?

MULDER

Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of

experiment. Something they excavated

was brought there in tanker trucks.

KURTZWEIL

What?

MULDER

I'm not sure. A virus --

KURTZWEIL

-- You saw this experiment?

MULDER

What did it look like?

MULDER

There were bees. And corn crops.

MULDER

What are they?

KURTZWEIL

What do you think?

MULDER

A transportation system. Transgenic

crops. The pollen genetically altered

to carry a virus.

KURTZWEIL

That would be my guess.

MULDER

Your guess?

MULDER

What do you mean, your guess?

MULDER

You told me you had answers.

KURTZWEIL

Yeah, well I don't have them all.

MULDER

You've been using me --

KURTZWEIL

I've been using you?!

MULDER

You didn't know my father --

KURTZWEIL

I told you -- he and I were old

friends --

MULDER

You're a liar. You lied to me to

gather information for you. For your

goddamn books. Didn't you?

CUT TO:

MULDER

Kurtzweil!

KURTZWEIL

You'd be shit out of luck if not for

me. You saw what you saw because I led

you to it. I'm putting my ass on the

line for you.

MULDER

Your ass? I just got chased across

Texas by two black helicopters.

KURTZWEIL

And why do you think it is you're

standing here talking to me? These

people don't make mistakes, Agent

Mulder.

CUT TO:

MULDER

What? What's wrong?

SCULLY

Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer

effective immediately.

SCULLY

I already gave Skinner my letter of

resignation.

MULDER

You can't quit, Scully.

SCULLY

I can, Mulder. I debated whether or

not to even tell you in person,

because I knew --

MULDER

We're close to something here -- we're

on the verge --

SCULLY

You're on the verge, Mulder -- please

don't do this to me --

MULDER

After what you saw last night -- after

all you've seen -- you can't just walk

away --

SCULLY

I have. I did. It's done.

MULDER

Just like that --

SCULLY

I'm contacting the state board Monday

to file medical reinstatement papers

--

MULDER

I need you on this, Scully --

SCULLY

You don't Mulder -- you've never

needed me. I've only held you back.

(beat)

I've got to go.

MULDER

You're wrong --

SCULLY

Why was I assigned to you? To debunk

your work. To reign you in. To shut

you down.

MULDER

You saved me, Scully.

(off her look)

As different and frustrating as it's

been sometimes, your goddamn strict

rationalism and science have saved me

a thousand times; have kept me honest

and made me whole. I owe you so much,

Scully, and you owe me nothing.

(beat)

I don't want to do this without you. I

don't know if I can. If I quit now,

they win.

SCULLY

OUCH!!!

MULDER

What? What happened?

SCULLY

I think... something stung me.

MULDER

It must...

MULDER

Scully...

SCULLY

Something's wrong...

(fighting for clarity)

I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my

chest. My... motor functions are being

affected. I'm...

SCULLY

...my pulse feels thready and I've

got a funny taste in the back of my

throat.

MULDER

I think you're in anaphylactic shock

--

SCULLY

No -- it's --

MULDER

Scully --

SCULLY

I've got no allergy. Something...

this... Mulder... I think... I think

you should call an ambulance.

CUT TO:

MULDER

This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I

have an emergency -- I have an agent

down --

1ST PARAMEDIC

Can you hear me? Can you say your

name?

1ST PARAMEDIC

She's got constriction in the throat

and larynx -- are you breathing okay?

1ST PARAMEDIC

Passages are open. Let's get her in

the van --

1ST PARAMEDIC

Coming through people -- here we go.

Coming through --

CUT TO:

MULDER

She said she had a taste in the back

of her throat -- there was no

pre-existing allergy to bee-stings --

the bee that stung her may have been

carrying a virus --

2ND PARAMEDIC

A virus?

1ST PARAMEDIC

Get on the radio, tell them we have a

cytogenic reaction, we need an advise

and administer --

DISSOLVE TO:

BYERS

I think he's coming out --

LANGLY

He's coming to.

FROHIKE

Hey, Mulder...

FROHIKE

Mulder...?

MULDER

Oh god...

LANGLY

What's wrong?

MULDER

(to Byers, then Langly)

Tin Man. Scarecrow.

(to Frohike)

Toto.

MULDER

What am I doing here?

BYERS

You were shot in the head. The bullet

broke the flesh on your right brow and

glanced off your temporal plate.

MULDER

(woozy)

Penetration but not perforation.

LANGLY

Three centimetres to the left and we'd

be playing the harp.

BYERS

They gave you a craniotomy to relieve

the pressure from a subdural hematoma.

But you've been unconscious since they

brought you in.

MULDER

When was that?

FROHIKE

Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been

here with you around the clock.

LANGLY

We got the news and made a trip to

your apartment. Found a bug in your

phone line.

FROHIKE

And one in your hall.

MULDER

Scully had a violent reaction to a bee

sting --

BYERS

You called 911. Except the call was

intercepted.

MULDER

(sitting up)

They took her --

SKINNER

Agent Mulder --

MULDER

Where's Scully?!

SKINNER

She's missing. We've been unable to

locate her or the vehicle they took

her in.

MULDER

Whoever they are -- this goes right

back to Dallas -- it goes right back

to the bombing --

SKINNER

I know.

(off Mulder's reaction to

this)

Agent Scully reported your suspicions

to OPR. On the basis of her report, I

sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's

apartment. They picked up PSTN

residues on his personal effects

consistent with the construction of

the vending machine device in Dallas.

MULDER

(reeling)

How deep does this go?

SKINNER

I don't know.

MULDER

Are we being watched?

SKINNER

I'm not taking any chances.

MULDER

I need your clothes, Byers.

BYERS

Me?

SKINNER

What are you doing?

MULDER

I've got to find Scully.

FROHIKE

Do you know where she is?

MULDER

No. But I know someone who might have

an answer. Who better.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin

Kurtzweil?

KURTZWEIL

Jesus Christ.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

You're surprised. Certainly you've

been expecting some response to your

indiscretion.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent

Mulder, you have your good reason.

It's a weakness in men our age; the

urge to confess.

(stopping his walk)

I forgive you that.

KURTZWEIL

What are you doing here? What do you

want from me?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

You must try to understand, what I'm

here to do is only to protect my

children. You and I have but short

lives left. I can only hope the same

isn't true for them.

CUT TO:

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Mr. Mulder.

MULDER

What happened to Kurtzweil?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

He's come and gone.

MULDER

Where's Scully?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I have answers for you.

MULDER

Is she alive?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Yes.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I'm quite prepared to tell you

everything, though there isn't much

you haven't guessed.

MULDER

About the conspiracy?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I think of it as an agreement. A word

your father liked to use.

MULDER

I want to know where Scully is.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

The location of Agent Scully. And the

means to save her life.

(off Mulder's look)

Please...

CUT TO:

MULDER

What is it?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

A weak vaccine against the virus Agent

Scully has been infected with. It must

be administered with ninety six

hours.

MULDER

(beat)

You're lying.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

No. Though I have no way to prove

otherwise. The virus is

extraterrestrial. We know very little

about it, except that it is the

original inhabitant of this planet.

MULDER

(dubious, to say the least)

A virus?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What

is a virus but a colonizing force that

cannot be defeated? Living in a cave,

underground, until it mutates. And

attacks.

MULDER

This is what you've been conspiring to

conceal? A disease?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

No! For God sake you've got it all

backwards.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Aids, the ebola virus -- on the

evolutionary scale they are newborns.

This virus walked the planet long

before the dinosaurs.

MULDER

What do you mean, walked?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little

green men, first landed here millions

of years ago. Those that didn't leave

have been laying dormant underground

since the last Ice Age. In the form of

an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be

reconstituted when the alien race from

which it came returns to colonize the

planet. Using us as hosts. Against

this we have no defense. Nothing but a

weak vaccine.

(beat)

Do you see why it was kept secret? Why

even the best men -- men like your

father -- could not let the truth be

known?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Until Dallas, we believed the virus

was simply a controlling organism.

That mass infection would make us a

slave race.

MULDER

That's why you bombed the building.

The infected firemen, the boy --

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Imagine our surprise when they began

to gestate. My group has been working

cooperatively with the alien

colonists, facilitating their

programs. To give us access to the

virus. In false hope we might be able

to secretly find a cure. So that we

might save ourselves, as the last of

the species.

(beat)

Your father wisely refused to believe

this, choosing hope over selfishness.

Hope is the only future he had: his

children,

(beat, then self-revealing)

The only future any of us have.

MULDER

But... he sacrificed his own daughter.

My sister, Samantha.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

The only true survivors of the viral

holocaust will be those immune to it:

those vaccinated against it and

human/alien hybrids. Your father

arranged for your sister's abduction.

He allowed her to be taken to an alien

hybrid program, so that she would

survive. As a clone.

(beat)

He had different hopes for you. That

you would uncover the truth about the

Project. That you would stop it. That

you would fight the future.

MULDER

Why are you telling me this?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

I thought it only fair you should

know, given how hard you've worked.

MULDER

What happened to Kurtzweil?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

As your father knew, things need to be

sacrificed to the future.

MULDER

Where is he?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

MULDER

Let me out. Stop the car.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

(motioning)

Driver.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

The men I work with will stop at

nothing to clear the way for what they

believe is their stake in the

inevitable future. I was ordered to

kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to

protect my grandchildren's lives.

(beat)

I might just as easily kill you.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

(with quiet force)

You have precious little time. What

I've given you the alien colonists

have no idea exists. You hold in your

hand the power to end the project.

MULDER

How?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

The vaccine you hold is the only

defense against the virus. Its

introduction into an alien environment

may have the power to destroy the

delicate plans we've so assiduously

protected for the last fifty years.

(beat)

Or it may not.

MULDER

What alien environment?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her

science can save the future.

MULDER

What about you?

WELL-MANICURED MAN

My life is over.

(beat)

Go.

WELL-MANICURED MAN

Go now!

that a federal agent may have been

involved in the bombing... the other

events you've laid down here seem too

incredible on their own, and quite

frankly implausible in their

connection.

SCULLY

What is it you find incredible?

CASSIDY

Well...where would you like me to

start? Antarctica is a long way from

Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very

well submit a report to the Attorney

General that alleges the links you've

made here. Bees and corn crops do not

quite fall under the rubric of

domestic terrorism.

SCULLY

No, they don't.

CASSIDY

Most of what I find in here is lacking

a coherent picture of an organization

with an attributable motive. I realize

you're very lucky to be alive Agent

Scully. The ordeal you've endured has

clearly affected you -- though the

holes in your account leave this panel

with little choice but to delete these

references from our final report to

the Justice Department. Until which

time hard evidence becomes available

that would give us cause to pursue

such an investigation.

SCULLY

I don't believe the FBI currently has

an investigation unit qualified to

pursue the evidence in hand.

CASSIDY (O.S.)

Mr. Skinner....?

CASSIDY

Please ask Agent Scully to come back

to this hearing. We're not quite

finished.

Congratulations on your survival. Your

life is worthless now, I hope you know

that.

MULDER

And yours?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

(derisive)

You think you've stopped it. What I've

worked for fifty years to create. You

haven't stopped it. You can't stop

it.

(takes a drag)

You're just one man.

MULDER

You're wrong.
