LACHAISE

Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,

but you understand, a man in my

position..

BOND

Which is neutral, no doubt.

LACHAISE

It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the

money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be

pleased to see it again.

LACHAISE

In the current exchange rate, minus the

fees, of course, and certain

unforeseeable expenses. Here is the

receipt...

CIGAR GIRL

Would you like to check my figures?

BOND

Perhaps later.

BOND

My glasses.

LACHAISE

It's all there.

BOND

I didn't come for the money. The report

you sold him was stolen from an MI-6

agent, who was killed for it.

LACHAISE

I did not get the report from an MI-6

agent.

BOND

Who did you get it from?

LACHAISE

I am just a middle man. I am doing the

honourable thing and returning the money

to its rightful owner...

BOND

And we know how difficult that can be for

the Swiss.

LACHAISE

(controlled fury)

Your last chance. Take the money.

BOND

Your last chance. Give me the name.

LACHAISE

Stripped of all your weaponry, you still

threaten me?

BOND

Perhaps you failed to take into account

my...hidden assets.

BOND

The name?

LACHAISE

I can't tell you...

(Bond cocks the gun)

Alright, alright! But you must protect

me!

RENARD

What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?

CIGAR GIRL

James Bond.

RENARD

One of M's more accomplished tin

soldiers.

CIGAR GIRL

He could identify me.

RENARD

If it concerns you...kill him.

RENARD

Let's toast this James Bond.  We're in

his hands now...

CUT TO:

BOND

Have this checked, see what you can get

off it.

MONEYPENNY

James.  Brought me a souvenir from

Geneva?

BOND

Thought you might want one of these.

MONEYPENNY

(beat, deadpan)

I gave up a long time ago.

(nods to M's door)

She's in with Sir Robert.

M

Sir Robert King, James Bond.

SIR ROBERT

Thanks for getting my money back --never

expected to see it again.  You're the

kind of man I could use.  Though I won't

offend certain parties by asking you to

join King Industries.

BOND

Construction's not exactly my line.

M

Quite the opposite, in fact.

BOND

Old friend?

M

Since Oxford. I knew him when he had

nothing but a brilliant mind and enough

guts to conquer the world. He's a man of

great integrity.

BOND

Who buys classified reports for three

million pounds.

M

It's a report on weapons security in the

former Soviet Union, which, as you know,

is shaky at best.  He's had several

instances of sabotage at the pipeline,

and he's understandably concerned. He

called me the moment he realized its

sensitive nature.

BOND

Someone was watching over me in Geneva.

A guardian angel with a laser sight.

BOND

King.

M

(filtered)

Moneypenny, stop King leaving.

MONEYPENNY

(flicking switch)

Security --

Q

..the hydro boat can operate in three

inches of water...

SIR ROBERT

Thanks, but I'll count it myself.

(apologetic, smiles)

Lifetime habit.  I'm Scottish.

BOND

Stop!  King!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Q

It's not finished!

CUT TO:

M

Bond, we'll meet you inside.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

Beautiful, isn't it?

BOND

Yes.

WOMAN

Today, of all days, the sun decides to

shine.

BOND

Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the

Man Upstairs.

WOMAN

A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a

hostile takeover.

BOND

You knew him well?

WOMAN

He was my father.

BOND

I'm sorry.

WOMAN

He died before he could complete his

lifelong dream.

(beat)

I intend to finish it for him.

OLDER MAN

Elektra!

ELEKTRA

Excuse me.

CUT TO:

M

Elektra?  Running King Industries?

(she broods)

I've known that girl all her life. I'm

not sure she knows what she's walking

into.

BOND

She's not a girl anymore.

M

I've scheduled a medical for you.

BOND

It's barely a scratch. The Dome broke my

fall.

M

Well, at least it turned out to have some

purpose.

M

No-one goes into the field on this unless

they're 100%.  Dr. Greatrex is waiting.

DOCTOR GREATREX

Dislocated collar bone.  If any more

tendons snap...

(looks up)

It won't just be two weeks out of action.

BOND

I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.

BOND

It's just a scratch.

DOCTOR GREATREX

James.  It wouldn't really be...

BOND

Ethical?  Can't we just skirt the issue?

DOCTOR GREATREX

...if you showed sufficient...willpower.

Promised to slow down.  Cut out running,

jumping...shooting.  All kinds of...

BOND

Strenuous activity?

DOCTOR GREATREX

Then maybe I'd be... open to that.

BOND

(smiles)

Perhaps after this ... test?

DOCTOR GREATREX

...yes?...

BOND

I could come for a second opinion?

TANNER

...The money was dipped in urea, dried,

and packed tight. In one note the metal

strip had been replaced with a

combustible magnesium circuit -- in

effect a tiny detonator. King always wore

a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called

'the Eye of the Glens'; but someone

switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro-

circuit emitting an electronic signature.

TANNER

When he came within range of the money --

boom.  Ingenious.

M

We've been pawns in someone's game. They

tricked us into bringing the money to

King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.

TANNER

And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

M

Cheap, if it achieves your aim of de-

stabilizing the Western World.

M

007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?

BOND

Caviar capital of the world. Matchless

beluga. Firm, yet subtle.

(M looks askance)

Largest landlocked body of water on

Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it.

Stalin beat him to it.

M

And now it's up for grabs, a goldrush.

Far more oil than anyone thought.

ROBINSON

Latest estimates, six trillion dollars.

It'll make the Gulf look like a puddle,

see us right through the new century.

The problem is getting the oil out of

there.

M

There are four pipelines in the works.

Three to the Black Sea, shipping out

through the Bosphorus. All vulnerable to

unstable governments or Russian blockade.

BOND

So Sir Robert's goes through Turkey,

direct to the Med...?

ROBINSON

A huge project. The most expensive of the

pipelines, but the one supported by every

Western leader. None of the American oil

companies were willing to take it on.

But King has connections to the region.

He married into the Vavra family, rich

local industrialists. He used those

connections to hold it all together.

BOND

Kill the man, kill the pipeline.

M

Not necessarily.  Not with Elektra taking

over.

TANNER

Your call to the PM.

M

Our credibility has been hit hard.  We

have to hit back harder. Your

assignments.

M

(to Bond)

I'm waiting for the report on your

medical.

CUT TO:

NEWSCASTER

...somehow managed to shoot two of her

captors and escape...

VOICE

... the leader, the one who escaped.  Can

you describe him?

ELEKTRA

He shouted.  He shouted all the time --

'5,000,000 US DOLLARS.'  He stares at it.

CUT TO:

BOND

Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra

King.

M

Who told you to look at Elektra's files?

BOND

I took the initiative.

M

You haven't been given an assignment in

this case.

BOND

I was the one who brought that money

in...

M

I'm well aware of your stake in this,

007.

If you have a point, get to it.

BOND

The amount of money that killed Robert

King is the same amount as the ransom

demand for Elektra.

BOND

Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man

who killed her father.

M

It's a message.  He wants us to know he's

back.

BOND

Who?

M

Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...

BOND

(this is serious)

Renard.

CUT TO:

M

Sir Robert tried to deal with the

kidnapping with his own...resources, at

first. When Elektra's ear was delivered

to him in the post, he came to me.

(measured)

I advised against paying the ransom. I

knew it was Renard. I played it out as

long as possible to get a fix on him.

BOND

Sacrifice the girl to take out the

terrorist?

M

How many deaths is he responsible for?

How many innocent people? You may only

get one shot at a man like Renard. Same

circumstances, I'd do the same again.

M

We sent 009 down to kill him.  Before he

could, Elektra escaped.  A week later our

man caught up with the target. Put a

bullet in his head.

(beat)

That bullet is still there.

BOND

He survived?

M

The doctor who saved him couldn't get it

out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol

found the x-rays, there was mild

jubilation. Effectively, he's a dead man.

M

The bullet is moving through the medulla

oblongata, killing off his sense of

touch. He feels no pain. He can push

himself harder, longer than any normal

man.

BOND

'That which does not kill me makes me

stronger.'

M

Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.

BOND

He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow

up five million dollars unless he knows

there's more coming in. He's working for

someone. Someone who wants to stop the

pipeline.  And they hired the perfect

killer. One with a vendetta against

King...and you.

M

I see the good doctor gave you glowing

testimonials. 'Exceptional stamina'...

MONEYPENNY

He's always been good at oral exams.

M

Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider

who switched the pin. If your instincts

are right, Renard will be back. He hasn't

completed the job. The pipeline is still

going forward, and we have Elektra to

thank for that.

BOND

The worm on the hook again.

BOND

Scottish heavy metal, Q?

Q

Oh pipe down, 007.

(irritated, hands over a WATCH)

Your 29th. Try not to lose this one. It

has dual lasers and a miniature grappling

hook with fifty feet of high-tensile

micro-filament, able to support 800

pounds.

Q

New refinement.  Sort of X-ray vision.

For checking concealed weapons.

BOND

And other uses, no doubt.

Q

Abuses in your case. You destroyed my

hydro-boat in less than seven minutes, as

no doubt will be the case with this...

Q

007, my Deputy Assistant.  I'm grooming

him to follow me.

BOND

(to Man)

That would make you..."R"?

R

Ahh, the rampant 007 wit.  I, of course,

am laughing inside.  But I dare say

you've met your match in this machine.

(touring the car)

The absolute latest in intercepts,

surveillance and countermeasures.

Titanium plating and armor, a multi-

tasking heads-up display. Completely

indestructible.  All in all, rather

stocked.

Q

'Fully loaded' I think is the term.

R

Do take good care of her.

CUT TO:

DAVIDOV

(excellent English)

Bond. A government man. I'm afraid since

you English got the boss killed we've

been a little...jumpy.

BOND

(re:  gun)

I'd rather you didn't play with that.

DAVIDOV

Nice.

BOND

Quite stunning.

DAVIDOV

(pleasant)

Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits

die hard. I am Head of Security.

Davidov.

ELEKTRA

(to Foreman)

...they should have been in place two

days ago. That is the target my father

set.

FOREMAN

We've had some trouble with the villagers

at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot...

DAVIDOV

Miss King...James Bond here to see you.

ELEKTRA

Find me the research on the limestone

deposits, go ahead and place these

orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go

to Ruan myself...

DAVIDOV

Miss King, I wouldn't recommend...

ELEKTRA

I said, I will go.

ELEKTRA

Would you excuse us, Davidov?

ELEKTRA

I met you at my father's funeral.

BOND

Yes.

ELEKTRA

I haven't been able to recall a single

moment of that day...until now.

BOND

Funerals aren't exactly memorable.

ELEKTRA

God no. All those horrible loved ones and

relatives. I don't want to talk to those

people. I just want to...talk to my

father.

(beat)

I loved him.  I'm not sure he knew that.

BOND

Is that why you want to finish the

pipeline?

ELEKTRA

Partially, yes.

GABOR

The jeep is ready, Ma'am.  Will I be

driving with you?

ELEKTRA

No, Gabor. We have a guest.

BOND

Who is he?

ELEKTRA

My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere.

He's decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an

excellent omelette.

BOND

How long has he been with you?

ELEKTRA

Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?

BOND

Does this look familiar to you?

ELEKTRA

It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday

of his life.

ELEKTRA

Are you trying to break my heart? Or is

it just your way with women?

BOND

It's not the pin your father wore. It's

an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny

electrical detonator. We have reason to

believe the assassin had an inside

accomplice, someone who worked at this

company.

ELEKTRA

If you've come here to look after me, Mr.

Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I

have two bodyguards, I don't need a

third...

BOND

The killer doesn't want to see this

pipeline continue, doesn't want to see

you take over...

ELEKTRA

That's every man within a five mile

radius.  Including you.

(off his look)

That's why you're here, isn't it? You

think I can't do it. You think I'm going

to screw up. Or get myself killed.

BOND

I think running this pipeline would be a

difficult job for anyone. Especially

King's daughter.

ELEKTRA

You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am

the only person who can do it.

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

My mother's people discovered oil here

ninety years ago.  The Bolsheviks

slaughtered them for it.

(beat)

Some say oil is in my family's blood.  I

say our blood is in the oil. This is the

very heart of the planet.  Up here in the

hills was Eden, literally.  Look what the

Russians did to it.  Now we have a second

chance and this time we'll do it right.

When the other wells have all dried up,

she'll still be pumping her lifeblood to

the world.  And this

(proudly, of pipeline)

Will be one of the main arteries...

ELEKTRA

Send the pipe around.

FOREMAN

It will take weeks, cost millions.

Your father approved this route.

ELEKTRA

Then my father was wrong.

ELEKTRA

I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor

will drive you back.

BOND

Always wanted to see the upper lines.

ELEKTRA

You don't take no for an answer, do you?

BOND

No.

ELEKTRA

Alright then. Do you ski?

BOND

I've been known to.

PILOT

Can't land.  Wind's too strong!

ELEKTRA

Just hold her steady.

(to Bond)

You wanted to see it.

ELEKTRA

We're building from both ends.  This is

where they'll meet.  Fifteen hundred

miles from the Caspian to the

Mediterranean.

BOND

Head for that gully, I'll lure them into

the trees!

BOND

(smiling)

Should have stuck to snowboarding.

appears in front of him...guns blazing...

ELEKTRA

Are they gone? All of them?

BOND

Hold on to me.

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

Oh my God...we're buried alive...

BOND

We're alright.

ELEKTRA

I can't stay here.

BOND

You're not going to.

ELEKTRA

No!  It will cave in!

BOND

It's the only way out...

ELEKTRA

I can't breathe, I can't breathe...

BOND

Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!

(she does)

You're alright. Everything will be

alright.  Trust me.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

She's fine. Contusions. A slight strain

to her ankle, but otherwise, fine.

(to Bond)

She wants to see you.

ELEKTRA

Are you alright?

BOND

I can't stay.

ELEKTRA

I know.

ELEKTRA

I need to ask you something.  And I need

you to tell me the truth.

ELEKTRA

Who is it? Who is trying to kill me?

BOND

I don't know. But I will find him.

ELEKTRA

After the kidnapping...I was afraid to go

outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd,

to do anything at all, until I

realized...

(pause)

There's no point in living if you

can't...feel alive.

ELEKTRA

I can't huddle in the shadows. I can't

let fear run my life.  I won't.

ELEKTRA

The way I acted, in the snow...you must

think I'm a coward.

BOND

I think you're one of the bravest people

I've ever met.

ELEKTRA

What is it?

BOND

...you should rest.

ELEKTRA

James...

BOND

I have to go.

ELEKTRA

Then take me with you.

BOND

No. You'll be safe here.

ELEKTRA

I don't want to be safe!

BOND

I have to go to work.

ELEKTRA

Now who's the coward?

CUT TO:

BOND

Valentin Zukovsky.

ZUKOVSKY

BondJamesBond. What brings you here?

BOND

You, of course. I need some information.

ZUKOVSKY

Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place.

Used to be the royal family's, now it's

mine. I run my little business, I stay

out of trouble...

BOND

(looking about)

Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies,

consortiums from every country in the

world.  A nice little rat's nest.

ZUKOVSKY

(offering hors d'ouevres)

Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From

my own fishery.  They buy my caviar,

drink my champagne, lose to my House.

ZUKOVSKY

Let me introduce you to a former

colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri

Palov, you may know him as...the Boa.

BOA

The great 007. For years I have dreamed

of closing my hands around your neck.

BOND

Boa. Have you had any therapy since

Perestroika?

ZUKOVSKY

Why am I suddenly worried I'm not

carrying enough insurance?

ZUKOVSKY

See?  You're upsetting my customers.

What do you want?

BOND

How does a terrorist like Renard supply

his men with state-of-the-art Russian

Army weapons?

ZUKOVSKY

What?  This is not possible.

BOND

If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st

airborne division.

ZUKOVSKY

Where did you get this?

BOND

Off a high-powered Paraski that was

trying to kill me.

ZUKOVSKY

The Russian Army, they spend millions on

flying skis, but they cannot afford to

pay the soldiers. The men, they do what

they have to do to feed their families.

In this country, for the right price and

a pack of cigarettes, you can get

anything you want.

ZUKOVSKY

That too. Everyone does what they can to

survive.

BOND

How high up does this...arms dealing go?

ZUKOVSKY

Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is

Renard. Our government has nothing to

gain by killing you.

BOND

But you would have something to gain by

killing Robert King. And stopping his

pipeline.

ZUKOVSKY

Poor Bond. The cold war is over.  What

have you got left? Economic espionage.

Murder in the boardroom.  So dull.

BOND

Oh, you'd be surprised.

ZUKOVSKY

We've kept your father's chair free.

ELEKTRA

And his account?

ZUKOVSKY

You have a credit line of a million and a

half.

ELEKTRA

Vodka martini.

BOND

Two. Shaken not stirred.

BOND

What the hell are you doing here?

ELEKTRA

(smiling right back)

Someone wants to kill me, I'd rather die

looking him straight in the eye.

(lightly)

What are you doing here?  Looking for a

woman a little more your type? How about

that one?

BOND

If this little show is for my benefit,

I'll take you home right now.

ELEKTRA

You had your chance, James. Now I'm

looking for a bigger thrill.

CUT TO:

HOOKER

You want to be...on top, or not on top?

DAVIDOV

On top.

HOOKER

Tied up, or not tied up?

RENARD

Dead, or not dead?

CUT TO:

BOND

I understand it's normally good practice

to get the feel of the cards before going

off the deep end.

ELEKTRA

Really?

DEALER

Bust.

ELEKTRA

I like the deep end, James.

CUT TO:

RENARD

Is this how you spend the money I pay

you? And with the rest you hire fools who

shoot like blind men?

DAVIDOV

(croaks out)

Bond...

RENARD

Should be dead as well. Your failure

today is astonishing.  It is a disgrace.

RENARD

Do you know why the color is blue at the

wick?

RENARD

Because that is where the flame is the

hottest.

RENARD

The temperature is close to five hundred

degrees.

DAVIDOV

The plane...it's all been arranged...

RENARD

Then you are completely unnecessary...

DAVIDOV

I have the documents, the landing

authorizations, the security passes...

RENARD

Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner,

tonight.  We understand each other?

DAVIDOV

Yes...yes...

CUT TO:

BOND

Stand or split them.

ELEKTRA

Surely you believe in living dangerously.

BOND

Not at that price. Time to surrender.

DEALER

The House has no limit.

ELEKTRA

(to Dealer)

Hit me.

ELEKTRA

Time to surrender.

DAVIDOV

A little accident.

BOND

A night of burning passion?

CUT TO:

HENCHMAN (V.O.)

What about Bond?

HENCHMAN

Sir?  Sir?

RENARD

(seething)

I will take care of Mister Bond.

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

You knew when you first saw me.  You knew

it would be like this.

BOND

Shush.

ELEKTRA

Poor shoulder. Looks painful...

BOND

...needs constant attention...

BOND

Enough ice for one day.

BOND

You never take this off?

ELEKTRA

Why do men always want to undress the one

part of a woman's body she doesn't want

to reveal?

BOND

How did you survive?

ELEKTRA

I used my body on the guards.  It gave me

control. I got to a gun and I took my

chance.

(beat)

I've never told anyone that.

ELEKTRA

Do you ever stop, James?  Do you ever

think about...another kind of life?

BOND

I can't afford to.

ELEKTRA

Don't worry. I know who you are.

DAVIDOV (V.O.)

I'm running late...no, no, I'll make

it...how will they know I'm your

man?...romashka...romashka...alright.

Old habits die hard.

Here goes nothing.

You are late. The transport documents?

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH

They are waiting for you below.  It

should be ready. Check with the IDA

physicist.

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH

Not interested in men. Take my word for

it.

CHRISTMAS

You new?

BOND

(Russian accent)

Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?

CHRISTMAS

Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones.

No jokes, I've heard them all.

BOND

Don't know any doctor jokes.

CHRISTMAS

What happened to Len Tashka?

BOND

Couldn't make it. Splitting headache.

CHRISTMAS

The soldiers may give you a hard time.

Whatever. If we weren't around, they'd

have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by

the roadsides, rotting in the sun.

BOND

Will I need protection?

CHRISTMAS

There's no radiation danger down there.

CHRISTMAS

(subtitles)

Where is this stockpile going?

BOND

(subtitles)

To the nuclear facility at Penza 19.

SOLDIER

See the corporal, at the end of the

chamber.

BOND

Corporal?

RENARD

I see my friend Davidov ran into some

difficulty.

BOND

Indeed.

BOND

Don't come any closer.

MAN

You can't kill me. I'm already dead.

RENARD

Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still

steal the bomb, and the shot will bring

them directly to you.

BOND

Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?

RENARD

To die by a man who can't even grasp what

he's caught up in...

BOND

Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's

clever is getting someone else to pay for

it.

RENARD

Not many people in this world have that

kind of fortune.

BOND

Who is it?

RENARD

You think I fear death? I welcome it. I

get on my knees and pray for it. You, on

the other hand, you have something to

live for, no?

(closer now)

She's beautiful isn't she? You should

have seen her before. Flawless, and still

so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

BOND

You will never touch her. You will never

get near her.

RENARD

Have you forgotten who saved your life in

Geneva?

BOND

Consider me ungrateful.

RENARD

It's I who should thank you -- for taking

that money back to MI-6.  So distressing

for M.  An explosion inside her lair.

BOND

She'll get over it.

RENARD

You even brought the plane for us.  We

really couldn't have done it without you.

RENARD

A man tires of being executed.

RENARD

But then again...There is no point in

living if you can't...feel alive.

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH

(to Bond)

Drop your gun.

BOND

Keep away, Colonel.

CHRISTMAS

He is an impostor.

(clutching a printout)

There's no Davidov at Miratom.

BOND

Here's your imposter. He's paid off the

men on the plane outside.  They're not

taking the bomb to any Russian facility,

they're flying it wherever he tells them.

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH

(to Bond)

I said drop it.

RENARD

(to Christmas)

Well done -- he would have killed us all.

I suppose you

(to Akakievich)

were you the one who allowed him down?

RENARD

(to Akakievich)

Take him away, I don't want him around as

we move the bomb.

(whispered, to Bond)

You had me.  I knew you couldn't shoulder

the responsibility...

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH

No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until

I am satisfied.  All of you to the

surface, now...

RENARD

(urgent now)

Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.

RENARD

(nods, into radio)

Shut them.

CHRISTMAS

Melt-down doors.  If he gets them closed,

they won't be opened again for forty-

eight years.

RENARD

We have our fireworks.  Now you can have

yours.

CUT TO:

CHRISTMAS

They won't get far. Every warhead has a

locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a

high-pitched signal on Russian emergency

frequencies. We can track the bomb.

BOND

With this?

DISSOLVE:

M

Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

TANNER

Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq,

Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

M

Marvellous.

MONEYPENNY

Elektra King is calling from Baku.

MONEYPENNY

It's a video line.

M

Put her on the wide screen.

ELEKTRA

I'm sorry. I would never call you

except...Bond's disappeared. He...he left

my villa, some time in the middle of the

night and...

ELEKTRA

My head of security has been found near a

local airstrip, murdered...

M

I'll send someone out.

ELEKTRA

Could...could you come?

ELEKTRA

I just can't help thinking...I'm next.

M

Get me out there.

ELEKTRA

Gabor...?

ELEKTRA

James!

BOND

You look surprised.

ELEKTRA

What's wrong with you?  Are you crazy?

BOND

A little. Does it matter? After all,

what's the point of living if you can't

feel alive?  Isn't that right, Elektra?

Isn't that your motto?

ELEKTRA

What are you talking about?

BOND

Or did you steal it from your old friend

Renard?

ELEKTRA

...what?

BOND

We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about

us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew

exactly where to hurt me...

ELEKTRA

Are you saying...Renard is the man who's

trying to kill me?

BOND

You can drop the act, it's over.

ELEKTRA

I don't know what you're talking about!

BOND

I think you do.

BOND

At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome.

It's common in kidnappings.  A young

impressionable victim. Sheltered,

sexually inexperienced. A powerful

kidnapper skilled in torture, in

manipulation. Something snaps in the

victim's mind. The captive falls in love

with her captor.

ELEKTRA

How dare you!  How dare you! That

animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me!

You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt

you, is that it? You had a sling on your

arm at the funeral! I didn't have to

sleep with you to find that out.

BOND

He used your exact words.

ELEKTRA

You knew.  You knew all the time, that he

was out there, that he was coming for me,

and you lied. You used me, you used me as

bait. You made love to me -- what, to

pass the time as you waited for him to

strike?

ELEKTRA

He's struck again.

(beat)

Five men are dead at the pipeline.

BOND

I'm coming with you.

ELEKTRA

You do what you have to do, but I've

called in M.  She's en route from London

even now.

CUT TO:

M

(to Bond)

Glad to see you've turned up.

BOND

They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a

scientist here from the International

Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.  She

has ten crews combing the area.

TANNER

I'll see how they're coming with the

power...

M

You had your hand on the bomb and you let

Renard get away with it.

BOND

The report King bought. It's a manual.

Renard's men used it to remove this radio

tracking device from the warhead.

M

Then Robert was right about a Russian

connection.

BOND

They're getting their weapons from the

Russians, but where are they getting the

money to buy the weapons?  I can't help

thinking...the person close to King, the

one who switched that pin...

M

The inside man?

BOND

Is maybe...the inside woman.

M

A woman?

ELEKTRA

That's not right.

TANNER

What is it?

ELEKTRA

It's an observation and repair rig.

Travels along the pipe, checks for broken

seals.  But it's not supposed to be

there.

BOND

(thinks)

Stop it.

TECHNICIAN

I don't understand...

M

Where is the rig?

M

The parcel's in the post.

TANNER

It's heading for the oil terminal.

M

Where it can do the most damage.

ELEKTRA

My God.

(to one of her men)

Have the terminal evacuated.

BOND

(to Tech)

Speed?

TECHNICIAN

Full on.  Seventy miles an hour.

TECHNICIAN

One hundred and six miles from the

terminal.

BOND

(quick)

It'll reach the other end in seventy-

eight minutes.

(to Tech)

Any more of these rigs?

TECHNICIAN

There's one parked in the passageway

ahead of it.

CHRISTMAS

I'll need some help...

BOND

Come on.

BOND

Unless you'd like to see my ID first.

CUT TO:

TANNER

(sealing them in)

Good luck.

BOND

Be one along any minute.

BOND

When this is over we should bury the

hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?

CHRISTMAS

When this is over our bodies may be blown

to smithereens.

BOND

Alright then, brunch.

RADIO MAN

Tanner reports Bond is headed for the

rendezvous.

M

Excellent. Evacuate Miss King and the

others.

ELEKTRA

You can evacuate my workers, but I'm not

going anywhere.

BOND

Faster! Get our speed up!

CHRISTMAS

Tactical fission device.  Low yield.

CHRISTMAS

The plutonium is missing.  They've taken

the core!

BOND

Then it's no longer a bomb?

CHRISTMAS

(back to work, urgent)

It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if

the trigger charge goes off...

BOND

Let it blow.

CHRISTMAS

But we can stop it.

BOND

Let it blow.

BOND

Trust me.  Leave it.

GABOR

It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud.

The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard

section of pipeline...

M

And Bond?

GABOR

Nothing.

ELEKTRA

Do you think he's dead?

M

We just have to wait.

ELEKTRA

(to M)

I have a gift for you.  Something that

belonged to my father. He would have

wanted you to have it.

M

Perhaps this isn't the time...

ELEKTRA

Please.

ELEKTRA

He often spoke of how...compassionately

you advised him on the best course of

action during my kidnapping.

ELEKTRA

It's very valuable, you know. I just

couldn't let it explode with the rest of

him.

ELEKTRA

(to her men)

Take her to the chopper.

CHRISTMAS

What the hell were you doing?  You nearly

killed us!

BOND

I did kill us. She thinks we're dead.

And she thinks she got away with it.

CHRISTMAS

What the hell are you talking about?

BOND

It's part of some plan. She dresses it up

like a terrorist attack.  The explosion

covers up the theft of the plutonium.

CHRISTMAS

Who's she?

BOND

Elektra King.

CHRISTMAS

Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is

her pipeline.

BOND

Makes her look even more innocent.

CHRISTMAS

(skeptical)

What would she want with weapons grade

plutonium?

BOND

I was hoping you could tell me.

CHRISTMAS

You steal an old bomb, small by today's

standards, about the size of the one that

destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium

core out of it, intending to use it...

(beat)

To make a bigger, better bomb.

CHRISTMAS

I have to get after that core.  This is

my ass.

TANNER

Tanner to 007, do you read?

BOND

Loud and clear.  I have to speak to M.

TANNER

She's gone.

BOND

What?

TANNER

She's disappeared.  And two of our men

have been killed.

CHRISTMAS

What is it?

BOND

She just upped the stakes. All her chips

are on the table now.  And M's life is

part of the bet.

BOND

I know I promised you champagne, but

would you settle for caviar?

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

You're hurting me.

ELEKTRA

Brought me something?

RENARD

Go on.  It's safe.  Touch your destiny.

ELEKTRA

Warm.

RENARD

(pointed)

Is it?

ELEKTRA

I've brought something for you as well.

ELEKTRA

Just as I promised.

RENARD

My executioner.

M

Over-praise, I'm afraid.  But my people

will finish the job.

ELEKTRA

Your people? Your people will leave you

here to rot just like you left me. You

and my father. He didn't think my life

was worth the chump change he spent on a

day at the stock market.

M

Your father...

ELEKTRA

Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my

mother. The kingdom I will rightly take

back.

M

She's insane.  Is that what you did to

her?

RENARD

No. I'm afraid it is what you did.

RENARD

When I took her she was...promise itself.

So clever, so vibrant, so...full of life

force. And you left her there, at the

mercy of a man like me. You ruined her.

For what?  To get to me? She is worth

fifty of me.

M

For once, I agree with you.

M

So she used all that brilliance to get

revenge on her father, on me.

RENARD

No. I wanted you. I wanted you for

myself.

RENARD

Since you sent your man to kill me, I

have been watching time tick slowly away,

marching inevitably toward my own death.

Watch these hands, M. At noon tomorrow,

your time is up. And I guarantee you...I

will not miss.  You will die. Along with

everyone in this city and the future of

the West.

ZUKOVSKY

What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress

this innocent thing?

BOND

She's no innocent.  This is my nuclear

consultant.

ZUKOVSKY

Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic

relationship.

ZUKOVSKY

Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice

Russian scientist with hair growing out

of his ears?

BOND

What's your business with Elektra King?

ZUKOVSKY

I thought you were the one in her

business.

BOND

She dropped a million and half dollars to

the House -- your House. And you didn't

even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you

off.  What for?

ZUKOVSKY

As ever you are the spy who has to see a

plot wherever he looks.

ZUKOVSKY

That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!

BOND

You are out of your league.  She's

working with Renard.

CHRISTMAS

They've stolen a nuclear device.

BOND

Tell us what you know, Zukovsky.  Tell

us, before its too late.

BOND

Now...where were we?

ZUKOVSKY

A rope!

BOND

No.  The truth!

(beat)

She thought I was dead -- those blades

were meant for you.  What do you know

that she would kill you for?

ZUKOVSKY

I don't know what you're talking --

ZUKOVSKY

Help me, don't let me drown.

BOND

(to Zukovsky)

You're in this thing up to your neck.

ZUKOVSKY

Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle

machinery for her.  Russian stuff.

BOND

And the payoff on the tables?

ZUKOVSKY

A special job.  A...a...a submarine.

CHRISTMAS

What?

ZUKOVSKY

To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is

Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.

BOND

Where's the sub going?!

ZUKOVSKY

No!  Get me out!

BOND

This is too big for even you.  Where is

it?

ZUKOVSKY

This is a family matter! If my nephew is

in danger, we do it my way, or nothing!

Now get me out!

ZUKOVSKY

No! Bond!

CHRISTMAS

(alarmed)

Bond!

CHRISTMAS

Commander Bond, you are dangerous,

unpredictable, and a hothead.

CHRISTMAS

But then again, explosive devices are my

specialty.

ZUKOVSKY

So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just

you, me and my people.

BOND

Where?

ZUKOVSKY

Istanbul.

CUT TO:

RENARD

So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.

ELEKTRA

How would you know?

RENARD

Why are you like this?  Because Bond is

dead?  It's what you wanted.

ELEKTRA

(beat)

Of course...

RENARD

He was a...good lover?

ELEKTRA

What do you think?

RENARD

Nothing.

ELEKTRA

What about this?

RENARD

Nothing.

ELEKTRA

But surely...

ELEKTRA

...You can feel this?

ELEKTRA

(sensual)

Remember ... pleasure?

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE TO:

ZUKOVSKY

Any luck reaching Yevgeny?

OPERATOR

Negative, comrade.

CHRISTMAS

(to Zukovsky)

What is this place?

ZUKOVSKY

Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye

Factory was just a front; now it turns a

good profit.

BOND

Your old friend Dmitri.

ZUKOVSKY

Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on

your side.

ZUKOVSKY

In the good old days, the KGB had three

or four spots where our submarines could

surface without anyone knowing. But

Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.

CHRISTMAS

What class sub does your nephew run?

ZUKOVSKY

C-class.

BOND

Nuclear.

CHRISTMAS

Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear

reactor.

(the penny drops)

He's not loading any cargo. They want the

sub. The sub itself.

Put weapons grade plutonium inside the

sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic

meltdown.

BOND

Made to look just like an accident.

ZUKOVSKY

Mother of God.

BOND

The right kind of explosion in the right

spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut

off the Black Sea.

CHRISTMAS

But why? Eight million people would die,

the land irradiated for a hundred years.

A cloud of radiation the size of

Europe...

BOND

(chilled)

Because an explosion like that would kill

all the other pipelines. There would be

only one way to get the oil out of the

Caspian and pump it to the world...

CHRISTMAS

The King pipeline.

BOND

Elektra would control it all.

ZUKOVSKY

If what you say it true...it may be too

late for Yevgeny.

CUT TO:

RENARD

Captain...

YEVGENY

Sir. We are ready to load your cargo.

We only have a few hours before we'll be

missed.

RENARD

You came with a skeleton crew?

YEVGENY

That's all we can afford these days.

RENARD

Of course. We are grateful for your

efforts.

RENARD

We have brandy and other refreshments for

your men.

ZUKOVSKY

If we're not in time and something has

happened to him... you must let me kill

them.

BOND

Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky.  They

have M.

CUT TO:

RENARD

Take them up and throw them in the sea.

RENARD

We'll be underway in two hours.  Use that

time to re-familiarize yourselves with

your stations. Then ponder how rich

you'll be.  The re-breathers for the

escape are already on board.

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

Now you know how it feels.  To be locked

away, to wonder if they're coming for

you, if anyone will ever come for you.

M

Someone will come.

ELEKTRA

Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.

ELEKTRA

Somehow, I find that strangely

...disappointing.

M

Elektra. What time is it?

ELEKTRA

Time for you to die.

RENARD

The reactor is secured.

RENARD

This is the end.

ELEKTRA

No.  It is the beginning. The world will

never be the same.

RENARD

It will be yours, and yours alone. Have

fun with it.

CUT TO:

OPERATOR

Comrade, it's faint, but I'm getting

something. A signal. Transmitting at...37-

19 degrees north...

BOND

The locator card. It's M.

BOND

The rest?

CHRISTMAS

Forty, forty-three degrees East...

ZUKOVSKY

The Maiden's Tower.

BOND

How appropriate.

ZUKOVSKY

I'd heard there were some renovations

there...no one would look for a sub in

that place in a million years.

CHRISTMAS

Zukovsky...

BOND

If I don't get to the Boa before he gets

to Maiden's Tower, M is dead.

BOA

For years I was told I could never take

the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.

What good is your gun now, Bond?

GABOR

Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.

ELEKTRA

James Bond and his amazing resurrection.

If only you'd kept away, we might have

met again in a few years, become lovers

once more.

ELEKTRA

(to guards)

Take her to Renard.

ELEKTRA

Pretty thing.  You had her too?

ELEKTRA

I could have given you the world.

BOND

Not interested.

ELEKTRA

They were digging near here and they

found some very pretty vases.  They also

found this...

(meaning the garotte)

I think we ignore the old ways at our

peril, don't you?

BOND

(ignoring her)

Where's M?

ELEKTRA

Soon she'll be everywhere.

BOND

All this, because you fell for Renard?

ELEKTRA

Five more turns and your neck will break.

ELEKTRA

Since I was a child, I've always had a

power over men. When I realized my father

wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I

knew I had to form a new alliance.

BOND

(realizing)

You turned Renard.

ELEKTRA

(smiling)

Just like you...only you were even

easier.

ELEKTRA

I told him he had to hurt me, he had to

make it look real. When he refused I told

him I would do it myself.

BOND

So you killed your father.

ELEKTRA

He killed me! He killed me the day he

refused to pay my ransom.

BOND

Was this all about the oil?

ELEKTRA

It is my oil!  Mine and my family's!

ELEKTRA

It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

I'm going to redraw the map.

And when I am through the whole world

will know my name, my grandfather's name,

the glory of my people.

BOND

No-one will believe this melt-down was an

accident.

ELEKTRA

They will believe.  They will all

believe.

ELEKTRA

You understand? Nobody can resist me.

ELEKTRA

Know what happens when a man is

strangled?

BOND

Elektra, it's not too late.  Eight

million people needn't die.

ELEKTRA

You should have killed me when you had

the chance.  But you couldn't. Not me.  A

woman you've loved.

BOND

You meant ... nothing ... to me.

BOND

One... last... screw?

ELEKTRA

(kissing his ear)

Oh James.

ZUKOVSKY

I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big

and black, and the driver is a friend of

mine.

ZUKOVSKY

Bring it to me.

ELEKTRA

What a shame.  You just missed him.

ELEKTRA

Excuse me.

ELEKTRA

Everything's under control up here.  Are

you ready?

RENARD

(filtered)

Yes.  Au revoir...

ELEKTRA

Zukovsky really hated you.

(beat)

Time to say goodnight.

CUT TO:

ELEKTRA

James.  You can't kill me.  Not in cold

blood.

M

Bond --

M

Go after the submarine, forget the girl.

Bond!

BOND

Call him off.

BOND

I won't ask again.  Call him off!

ELEKTRA

(into walkie-talkie)

Renard.

ELEKTRA

(to Bond)

You wouldn't kill me.  You'd miss me.

ELEKTRA

(into walkie-talkie)

Dive!  Bond --

BOND

I never miss.

BOND

How do you want to die?

(re:  cigarette)

That?

(re:  gun)

Or this?

CHRISTMAS

(stunned)

James!...

RENARD

(filtered)

Flood tanks 4 and 5...

CHRISTMAS

Is there another way?

BOND

We go down to the torpedo bay.

RENARD

Open the tanks.

BOND

(disguising voice)

Tanks open.

RENARD

(to self)

Bond...

RENARD

(into mic)

Bond! You have decided to join me on this

historic voyage.  Welcome to my nuclear

family.

BOND

You're really going to commit suicide for

her?

RENARD

In case you've forgotten.  I'm dead

already.

BOND

Haven't you heard the news?  So is she.

RENARD

You will die for this.

CHRISTMAS

The cover is off the reactor.

BOND

He's sealed himself in.

CHRISTMAS

He's going to insert the plutonium.

CHRISTMAS

Do you know what you're doing?

BOND

Like riding a bike.

CHRISTMAS

What kind of bikes did you ride?

BOND

Just wanted to put him on edge...

RENARD

Open the torpedo tubes.

BOND

Climb!

BOND

Keep moving.

BOND

There's one chance.

BOND

Re-breathers.

BOND

Never liked those things anyway.

BOND

Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty

open the hatch.  It can only be opened

for a few seconds or we'll sink.

CHRISTMAS

But what if...

BOND

Count to twenty.  I'll be there.

CHRISTMAS

One, one thousand, two, one thousand...

CHRISTMAS

Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one

thousand...

CHRISTMAS

Twenty.

BOND

Christmas!

CHRISTMAS

We have to get the rod out of the

reactor!

CHRISTMAS

Melting down.  4000 degrees, the

Zirconium casings on the rods crack.

5000, the plutonium melts.  In ten

minutes, a hydrogen explosion.

CUT TO:

BOND

She's waiting for you.

BOND

We're sinking.

CHRISTMAS

Help me.  We have to seal it.

BOND

We've got to get out.

CHRISTMAS

We can't.

DISSOLVE:

M

Any word from him?

TANNER

Still no contact yet.

BOND

I love Christmas in Turkey.

CHRISTMAS

So isn't it time you unwrapped your

present?

TANNER

That's strange.

TANNER

He must be nearby.

M

Where?

Q

This picks up body heat.  Humans should

be orange.

(searching)

There.

M

(to Tanner)

I thought you said he was with Doctor

Jones?

M

It's getting redder.

M

Bond.

Q

Could be a premature form of the

Millennium Bug.

CHRISTMAS

You know James...  I think Christmas is

coming early this year.

FADE OUT
