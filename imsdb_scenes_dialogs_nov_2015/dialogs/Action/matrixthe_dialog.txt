MAN (V.O.)

Hello?

SCREEN

Call trans opt:  received.

2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log>

WOMAN (V.O.)

I'm inside.  Anything to report?

CYPHER (V.O.)

Let's see.  Target left work at

5:01 PM.

SCREEN

Trace program:  running.

CYPHER (V.O.)

He caught the northbound Howard

line. Got off at Sheridan.

Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-

pack of beer and a box of Captain

Crunch.  Returned home.

TRINITY (V.O.)

All right, you're relieved.  Use

the usual exit.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Do you know when we're going to

make contact?

TRINITY

Soon.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Just between you and me, you don't

believe it, do you?  You don't

believe this guy is the one?

TRINITY (V.O.)

I think Morpheus believes he is.

CYPHER (V.O.)

I know.  But what about you?

TRINITY (V.O.)

I think Morpheus knows things that

I don't.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Yeah, but if he's wrong --

TRINITY (V.O.)

Did you hear that?

CYPHER (V.O.)

Hear what?

SCREEN

Trace complete.  Call origin:

#312-555-0690

TRINITY (V.O.)

Are you sure this line is clean?

CYPHER (V.O.)

Yeah, course I'm sure.

TRINITY (V.O.)

I better go.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

RADIO (V.O.)

Attention all units.  Attention

all units.

BIG COP

Police!  Freeze!

BIG COP

Get your hands behind your head!

BIG COP

Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do

it!

AGENT SMITH

Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT

Oh shit.

AGENT SMITH

Lieutenant, you were given

specific orders --

LIEUTENANT

I'm just doing my job.  You gimme

that Juris-my dick-tion and you

can cran it up your ass.

AGENT SMITH

The orders were for your protection.

LIEUTENANT

I think we can handle one little

girl.

LIEUTENANT

I sent two units.  They're

bringing her down now.

AGENT SMITH

No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.

TRINITY

Shit.

MAN (V.O.)

Operator.

TRINITY

Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I

don't know how.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I know.  Stay calm.

TRINITY

Are there any agents?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Yes.

TRINITY

Goddamnit!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

You have to focus.  There is a

phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can

make it.

TRINITY

All right --

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Go.

COP

Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

TRINITY

Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.

Get up -- just get up!

AGENT SMITH

Did you get anything from the

room?

AGENT JONES

Their next target.  The name is

Neo.

AGENT SMITH

We'll need a search running.

AGENT JONES

It's already begun.

SCREEN

JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been

on this board.

SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even

exist and the Matrix is nothing

but an advertising gimmick 4 a new

game.

TIMAXE:  All I want to know is

Trinity really a girl?

LODIII:  87% of all women on line

are really men.

QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism

for the government.

SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the

system controlling our lives.

TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.

SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.

FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

NEO

Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

SCREEN

Do you want to know what the

Matrix is, Neo?

SCREEN

SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?

JACKON:  Who's Neo?

GIBSON:  This is a private board.

If you want to know, follow the

white rabbit.

NEO

What the hell...

SCREEN

TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the

hackers!

FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!

JACKON:  Identify yourself.

Knock, knock, Neo.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

NEO

What do you want, Anthony?

ANTHONY

I need your help, man.  Desperate.

They got me, man.  The shackles of

fascism.

NEO

You got the money this time?

DUJOUR

You can really get that thing off,

right now?

ANTHONY

I told you, honey, he may look

like just another geek but this

here is all we got left standing

between Big Brother and the New

World Order.

ANTHONY

Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't

think about what they're- doing or

why.  Computer tells 'em what to

do and they do it.

FRIEND #l

Thc banality of evil.

ANTHONY

Thanks, neighbor.

DUJOUR

Why don't you come to the party

with us?

NEO

I don't know.  I have to work

tomorrow.

DUJOUR

Come on.  It'll be fun.

NEO

Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.

TRINITY

Hello, Neo.

NEO

How did you know that --

TRINITY

I know a lot about you.  I've been

wanting to meet you for some time.

NEO

Who are you?

TRINITY

My name is Trinity.

NEO

Trinity?  The Trinity?  The

Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.

Kansas City D-Base?

TRINITY

That was a long time ago.

NEO

Gee-zus.

TRINITY

What?

NEO

I just thought... you were a guy.

TRINITY

Most guys do.

NEO

Do you want to go sorewhere and

talk?

TRINITY

No.  It's safe here and I don't

have much time.

NEO

That was you on the board tonight.

That was your note, wasn't it?

TRINITY

I had to gamble that you would see

and they wouldn't.

NEO

Who wouldn't?

TRINITY

I can't explain everything to you.

I'm sure that it's all going to

seem very strange, but I brought

you here to warn you, Neo.  You

are in a lot of danger.

NEO

What?  Why?

TRINITY

They're watching you.  Something

happened and they found out about

you.  Normally, if our target is

exposed we let it go.  But this

time, we can't do that.

NEO

I don't understand --

TRINITY

You came here because you wanted

to know the answer to a hacker's

question.

NEO

The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

TRINITY

Twelve years ago I met a man, a

great man, who said that no one

could be told the answer to that

question.  That they had to see

it, to believe it.

TRINITY

He told me that no one should look

for the answer unless they have to

because once you see it,

everything changes.  Your life and

the world you live in will never

be the same.  It's as if you wake

up one morning and the sky is

falling.

TRINITY

The truth is out there, Neo.  It's

looking for you and it will find

you, if you want it to.

TRINITY

That's all I can tell you right

now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good

luck.

NEO

Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the

man?

TRINITY

You know who.

CUT TO:

NEO

Shitshitshit.

RHINEHEART

You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.

You think that you're special.

You believe that somehow the rules

do not apply to you.

RHINEHEART

Obviously, you are mistaken.

RHINEHEART

This company is one of the top

software companies in the world

because every single employee

understands that they are a part

of a whole.  Thus, if an employee

has a problem, the company has a

problem.

RHINEHEART

The time has come to make a

choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you

choose to be at your desk on time

from this day forth, or you choose

to find yourself another job.  Do

I make myself clear?

NEO

Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly

clear.

TALL EMPLOYEE

What did he say?

NEO

If I was late again, I'm going to

be fired.

TALL EMPLOYEE

Well, it was nice working with

you.

VOICE (O.S.)

Thomas Anderson?

NEO

Yeah.  That's me.

FEDEX

Have a nice day.

NEO

Hello?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I had hoped for this conversation

to take place under less adverse

conditions, but you can never

count on hope, can you, Neo?

NEO

... no.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I've been watching you, Neo, and I

want to meet you.  I don't know if

you're ready to see what I want to

show you, but unfortunately, we

have run out of time.  They're

coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not

sure what they're going to do.

NEO

Who's coming for me?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Stand up and see for yourself.

NEO

Right now?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Yes.  Now.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

NEO

Holy fuckin' shit!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Yes.

NEO

What the fuck do they want with

me?!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I'm not sure.  But, if you don't

want to find out, you better get

out of there.

NEO

How?!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I can guide you out, but you have

to do exactly what I say.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

The cubicle across from you is

empty.

NEO

But what if...?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Go!  Now!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Stay here for a moment.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

A little longer...

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

When I tell you, go to the end of

the row to the first office on the

left, stay.as low as you can.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Now.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Good.  Now there is a window.

Open it.

NEO

How do you know all this?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

The answer is coming, Neo.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Outside, there's a scaffold.  You

can use it to get to the roof.

NEO

No! It's too far away.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

There's a small ledge.  It's a

short climb.  You can make it.

NEO

No way, no way, this is crazy.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Don't be controlled by your fear,

Neo.  There are only two ways out

of this building.  One is that

scaffold.  The other is in their

custody.  You take a chance either

way.  I leave it to you.

NEO

This is insane!  Why is this

happening to me?  What did I do?

I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.

Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

NEO

I'm going to die.

NEO

This is insane.  I can't do this!

Forget it!

NEO

I didn't do anything!

TRINITY

Shit.

AGENT SMITH

As you can see, we've had our eye

on you for some time now, Mr.

Anderson.

AGENT SMITH

It seems that you have been living

two lives.  In one life, you are

Thomas A. Anderson, program writer

for a respectable software

company.  You have a social

security number, you pay your

taxes and you help your land lady

carry out her garbage.

AGENT SMITH

The other life is lived in

computers where you go by the

hacker alias Neo, and are guilty

of virtually every computer crime

we have a law for, including the

unauthorized use of the D.M.V.

system for the removal of

automobile boots.

AGENT SMITH

One of these,lives has a future.

One of them does not.

AGENT SMITH

I'm going to be as forthcoming as

I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are

here because we need your help.

AGENT SMITH

We know that you have been

contacted by a certain individual.

A man who calls himself Morpheus.

Whatever you think you know about

this man is irrelevant to the fact

that he is wanted for acts of

terrorism in more countries than

any other man in the world.  He is

considered by many authorities to

be the most dangerous man alive.

AGENT SMITH

My colleagues believe that I am

wasting my time with you, but I

believe you want to do the right

thing.  It is obvious that you are

an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,

and that you are interested in the

future.  That is why I believe you

are ready to put your past

mistakes behind you and get on

with your life.

AGENT SMITH

We are willing to wipe the slate

clean, to give you a fresh start

and all we are asking in return is

your cooperation in bringing a

known terrorist to justice.

NEO

Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a

real good deal.  But I think I

have a better one.  How about I

give you the finger --

NEO

And you can cram that file up your

Secret Service sphincter.

AGENT SMITH

You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

NEO

You ain't seen nothing yet.

AGENT SMITH

The irony of your situation is

that you have no choice.

NEO

You can't scare me with this

gestapo crap.  I know my rights.

I want my phone call.

AGENT SMITH

And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what

good is a phone call iy you are

unable to speak?

AGENT SMITH

You are going to help us, Mr.

Anderson, whether you want to or

not.

MORPHEUS (V.O.).

This line is tapped, so I must be

brief.

NEO

The agents --

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

They got to you first, but they've

underestimated how important you

are.  If they knew what I know,

you would probably be dead.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I don't know what you are thinking

right now but I want you to

understand that I will not give up

on you until you give up on me.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Do you still want to meet?

NEO

... Yes.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Take the Howard line south.

APOC

Come with me.

TRINITY

We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

TRINITY

Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,

trust us.

NEO

What are you doing?

TRINITY

This has to be done for your

protection and ours.

TRINITY

You can't understand right now,

but if you're not one of us,

you're one of them.

GIZMO

Va va va voom.  Still the hottest

software around.

TRINITY

Hello, Gizmo.

GIZMO

This is really the guy?  The guy

that Morpheus thinks --

TRINITY

Yeah.

GIZMO

But he's so old.

TRINITY

Are you going to help us or aren't

you?

GIZMO

Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top

and let's get the hell outta here.

GIZMO

Okay, first we take a little look

under the hood.

GIZMO

You're going to feel a little

prick.

NEO

What are you doing?

TRINITY

We think you're bugged.  We can't

take you to Morpheus until you're

clean.

GIZMO

There it is.

GIZMO

Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

GIZMO

Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

GIZMO

Gotcha!

GIZMO

Shit.

TRINITY

What's happening?

GIZMO

I don't know.  They've never done

that before.

GIZMO

Hold him down.

NEO

Jesus!  God!

TRINITY

Do something!

GIZMO

I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

TRINITY

Are you crazy?  That will kill

him.

GIZMO

It'll work.  Come on, do it or

Hacksaw will.

NEO

Do what?

TRINITY

Clear.

NEO

Oh, shit --

GIZMO

Hit him again!

GIZMO

Got it!

TRINITY

Neo, are you okay?

TRINITY

It's over.  We got it.

GIZMO

Nasty little bugger, ain't it?

TRINITY

Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

GIZMO

I just hope the man knows what

he's doing.

GIZMO

Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for

a copy of that software.

TRINITY

Gizmo, you don't have the hardware

to handle this software.

TRINITY

Let's go.  He's waiting.

TRINITY

This is it.

TRINITY

Let me give one piece of advice.

Be honest.  He knows more than you

can possibly imagine.

MORPHEUS

At last.

MORPHEUS

Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt

have guessed, I am Morpheus.

NEO

It's an honor.

MORPHEUS

Please.  Come.  Sit.

MORPHEUS

Thank you, Trinity.

MORPHEUS

I imagine, right now, you must be

feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling

down the rabbit hole?

NEO

You could say that.

MORPHEUS

I can see it in your eyes.  You

have the look of a man who accepts

what he sees because he is

expecting to wake up.

MORPHEUS

Ironically, this is not far from

the truth.  But I'm getting ahead

of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,

why are you here?

NEO

You're Morpheus, you're a legend.

Most hackers would die to meet

you.

MORPHEUS

Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we

both know there's more to it than

that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

NEO

No.

MORPHEUS

Why not?

NEO

Because I don't like the idea that

I'm not in control of my life.

MORPHEUS

I know exactly what you mean.

MORPHEUS

Let me tell you why you are here.

You are here because you have the

gift.

NEO

What gift?

MORPHEUS

I've watched you, Neo.  You do not

use a computer like a tool.  You

use it like it was part of

yourself.  What you can do inside

a computer is not normal.  I know.

I've seen it.  What you do is

magic.

NEO

It's not magic.

MORPHEUS

But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else

would you describe what has been

happening to you?

MORPHEUS

We are trained in this world to

accept only what is rational and

logical.  Have you ever wondered

why?

MORPHEUS

As children, we do not separate

the possible from the impossible

which is why the younger a mind is

the easier it is to free while a

mind like yours can be very

difficult.

NEO

Free from what?

MORPHEUS

From the Matrix.

MORPHEUS

Do you want to know what it is,

Neo?

MORPHEUS

It's that feeling you have had all

your life.  That feeling that

something was wrong with the

world.  You don't know what it is

but it's there, like a splinter in

your mind, driving you mad,

driving you to me.  But what is

it?

MORPHEUS

The Matrix is everywhere, it's all

around us, here even in this room.

You can see it out your window, or

on your television.  You feel it

when you go to work, or go to

church or pay your taxes.  It is

the world that has been pulled

over your eyes to blind you from

the truth.

NEO

What truth?

MORPHEUS

That you are a slave, Neo.  That

you, like everyone else, was born

into bondage...

... kept inside a prison that you

cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A

prison for your mind.

MORPHEUS

Unfortunately, no one can be told

what the Matrix is.  You have to

see it for yourself.

NEO

How?

MORPHEUS

Hold out your hands.

MORPHEUS

This is your last chance.  After

this, there is no going back.

MORPHEUS

You take the blue pill and the

story ends.  You wake in your bed

and you believe whatever you want

to believe.

MORPHEUS

You take the red pill and you stay

in Wonderland and I show you how

deep the rabbit-hole goes.

MORPHEUS

Remember that all I am offering is

the truth.  Nothing more.

MORPHEUS

Follow me.

CYPHER

Shit.

TRINITY

I knew he would.

CYPHER

Morpheus, I know what you believe

but I think this is a mistake.

We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm

afraid he might pop.

MORPHEUS

Haven't I always told you, Cypher,

not to let fear control your life.

Apoc, are we on-line?

APOC

Almost.

NEO

Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen

Virus.

APOC

That's right.

MORPHEUS

Neo, time is always against us.

Will you take a seat there?

MORPHEUS

I imagine you know sonething about

virtual reality.

NEO

A little.

MORPHEUS

Tell me about it.

NEO

Essentially, it's a hardware

system that uses an apparatus;

headgear, gloves and whatever to

make you feel that you are in a

computer program.

MORPHEUS

If the virtual reality apparatus,

as you called it, was wired to all

of your senses and controlled them

completely, would you be able to

tell the difference between the

virtual world and the real world?

NEO

You might not, no.

MORPHEUS

No, you wouldn't.

NEO

You did all this?

MORPHEUS

The pill you took is part of a

trace program.  It's going to make

things feel a bit strange.

NEO

Shit...

NEO

What is this?  Mescaline?

MORPHEUS

Just relax, Neo.

NEO

Uh-oh...

TRINITY

It's going into replication.

MORPHEUS

Apoc?

APOC

Still nothing.

MORPHEUS

Tank, we're going to need the

signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

NEO

It's cold.

NEO

It's all over me --

TRINITY

I got a fibrillation!

CYPHER

I knew it, I knew it...

MORPHEUS

Shit!  Apoc?

APOC

Targeting... almost there.

TRINITY

He's going into arrest!

CYPHER

He's gonna pop!

APOC

Lock!  I got him!

MORPHEUS

Now, Tank now!

MORPHEUS

Welcome to the real world, Neo.

FADE TO BLACK.

MAN (O.S.)

Do you think Morpheus is right?

Do you think he could be the One?

WOMAN (O.S.)

It doesn't matter now.  But if

he's wrong...

NEO

... am I dead?

TRINITY

Far from it.

FADE TO BLACK.

DOZER

He needs a lot of work.

MORPHEUS

I know.

NEO

What are you doing?

MORPHEUS

Your muscles have atrophied.

We're rebuilding them.

NEO

Why do my eyes hurt?

MORPHEUS

You've never used them before.

MORPHEUS

Rest, Neo.  The answers are

coming.

NEO

Morpheus, what's happened to me?

What is this place?

MORPHEUS

More important than what is when?

NEO

When?

MORPHEUS

You believe the year is 1997 when

in fact it is much closer to 2197.

I can't say for certain what year

it is because we honestly do not

know.

NEO

That's not possible.

MORPHEUS

I promised you the truth, Neo, and

the truth is that the world you

were living in was a lie.

NEO

How?

MORPHEUS

I'll show you.

MORPHEUS

This is my ship, the

Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a

hovercraft.  Small like a

submarine.  It's dark.  It's

cramped and cold.  But it's home.

MORPHEUS

This is the main deck.  You know

most of my crew.

MORPHEUS

The ones you don't know.  That's

Mouse and Switch.  The two big

guys are Tank and Dozer.

MORPHEUS

And this, this is the Core.  This

is where we broadcast our pirate

signal and hack into the Matrix.

MORPHEUS

Help him, Trinity.

MORPHEUS

Do you remember when I asked you

about an apparatus that could turn

a virtual reality into reality?

MORPHEUS

It's right here.

MORPHEUS

And it's accessed here.

MORPHEUS

This will feel a little weird.

MORPHEUS

This is the Construct.

MORPHEUS

It is our loading program.  We can

load anything from clothes, to

weapons, to training simulations.

Anything we need.

MORPHEUS

Sit down.

NEO

Right now, we're inside a computer

program?

MORPHEUS

Wild, isn't it?

NEO

This isn't real?

MORPHEUS

What is real?  How do you define

real?  If you're talking about

your senses, what you feel, taste,

smell, or see, then all you're

talking about are electrical

signals interpreted by your brain.

MORPHEUS

This is the Chicago you know.

Chicago as it was at the end of

the twentieth century.  This

Chicago exists only as part of a

neural-interactive simulation that

we call the Matrix.

MORPHEUS

You have been living inside

Baulliaurd's vision, inside the

map, not the territory.  This is

Chicago as it exists today.

MORPHEUS

'The desert of the real.'

MORPHEUS

We are, right now, miles below the

earth's surface.  The only place

humans can survive outside the

Matrix is underground.

NEO

What happened?

MORPHEUS

It started early in the twenty-

first century, with the birth of

artificial intelligence, a

singular consciousness that

spawned an entire race of

machines.

MORPHEUS

At first all they wanted was to be

treated as equals, entitled to the

same human inalienable rights.

Whatever they were given, it was

not enough.

MORPHEUS

We don't know who struck first.

Us or them.  But sometime at the

end of the twenty-first century

the battle was joined.

MORPHEUS

The war raged for generations and

turned the face of our planet from

green and blue to black and red.

MORPHEUS

It scorched and burned the sky.

Without the sun, the machines

sought out a new energy source to

survive.

MORPHEUS

They discovered a new form of

fusion.  All that was required to

initiate the reaction was a small

electric charge.  Throughout human

history we have been dependent on

machines to survive.  Fate, it

seems, is not without a sense of

irony.

MORPHEUS

The human body generates more bio-

electricity than a 120-volt

battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s

of body heat.

MORPHEUS

We are, as an energy source,

easily renewable and completely

recyclable, the dead liquified and

fed intravenously to the living.

MORPHEUS

All they needed to control this

new battery was something to

occupy our mind.

MORPHEUS

And so they built a prison out of

our past, wired it to our brains

and turned us into slaves.

NEO

No!  I don't believe it!  It's not

possible!

MORPHEUS

I didn't say that it would be

easy, Neo.  I just said that it

would be the truth.

NEO

Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!

NEO

Get this thing out of me!

TRINITY

Easy, Neo.  Easy.

NEO

Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

CYPHER

He's going to pop!

NEO

I can't go back, can I?

MORPHEUS

No.  But if you could, would you

really want to?

MORPHEUS

I feel that I owe you an apology.

There is a rule that we do not

free a mind once it reaches a

certain age.  It is dangerous.

They have trouble letting go..

Their mind turns against them.

I've seen it happen.  I broke the

rule because I had to.

MORPHEUS

When the Matrix was first built

there was a man born inside that

had the ability to change what he

wanted, to remake the Matrix as he

saw fit.  It was this man that

freed the first of us and taught

us the secret of the war; control

the Matrix and you control the

future.

MORPHEUS

When he died, the Oracle at the

temple of Zion prophesied his

return and envisioned an end to

the war and freedom for our

people.  That is why there are

those of us that have spent our

entire lives searching the Matrix,

looking for him.

MORPHEUS

I did what I did, because I

believe we have been brought here

for a reason, Neo.  You are here

to serve a purpose, just as I am

here to serve mine.

NEO

I told you I don't believe in

fate.

MORPHEUS

But I do, Neo.  I do.

MORPHEUS

Get some rest.  You're going to

need it.

NEO

For what?

MORPHEUS

Your training.

TANK

Morning.  Did you sleep?

NEO

No.

TANK

You will tonight.  I guarantee it.

I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

NEO

You don't have...

TANK

Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my

brother Dozer, we are 100 percent

pure, old fashioned, home-grown

human.  Born free.  Right here in

the real world.  Genuine child of

Zion.

NEO

Zion?

TANK

Zion is the place, man.  You'll

see it one day.  Last human city.

All we got left.

TANK

Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm

fairly excited to see what you are

capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is

right and all.  We're not supposed

to talk.about any of that, but if

you are, well then this is an

exciting time.  We got a lot to do

so let's get to it.

TANK

We're supposed to load all these

operations programs first, but

this is some major boring shit.

Why don't we start something a

little fun?

TANK

How about sore combat training?

NEO

Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn

jujitsu?

NEO

No way.

NEO

Holy shit!

TANK

Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready

for more?

NEO

Hell yes!

MORPHEUS

How is he?

TANK

Ten hours straight.  He's a

machine.

NEO

This is incredible.  I know Kung

Fu.

MORPHEUS

Show me.

MORPHEUS

This is a sparring program,

similar to the programmed reality

of the Matrix.  Consider this your

first lesson.

MORPHEUS

Attack me.

MOUSE

Morpheus is fighting Neo!

MORPHEUS

Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.

But your weakness isn't your

technique.

MORPHEUS

How did I beat you?

NEO

You -- You're too fast.

MORPHEUS

Do you think my being faster,

stronger has anything to do with

my muscles in this place?

MORPHEUS

Do you believe that's air you are

breathing now?

MORPHEUS

If you can free your mind, the

body will follow.

MORPHEUS

Again.

CABLE

Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

MOUSE

You ever seen anyone that fast

that soon, Tank?

TANK

Never.

APOC

Morpheus is right.  He's got to be

the one.

MOUSE

I don't believe it!

MORPHEUS

You are angry with me.

NEO

I, uh... maybe.

MORPHEUS

It's all right.  It's natural.

NEO

I feel better.

MORPHEUS

Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,

but it's a heavy one.

MORPHEUS

Tank, load the jump program.

MORPHEUS

You have to learn to let go of

that anger.  You must let go of

everything.

MORPHEUS

You must empty yourself to free

your mind.

NEO

Shit.

NEO

Okie dokie.

NEO

Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No

problem.

CABLE

He's gonna make it.

APOC

No way.  Not possible.

MOUSE

No one's ever made their first

jump.

SWITCH

What if he does?

APOC

He won't.

TANK

It's never been done.

TRINITY

Come on.

MORPHEUS

Everyone falls the first time.

MORPHEUS

If you never know failure, how can

you know success?

MOUSE

What does it mean?

CABLE

It doesn't mean anything.

CYPHER

Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

NEO

I thought it wasn't real.

NEO

If you are killed in the Matrix,

you die here?

MORPHEUS

The body cannot live without the

mind.

TRINITY

Neo, I saved you some dinner --

CYPHER

Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the

bejeezus out of ne.

NEO

Sorry.

CYPHER

No, it's all right.

NEO

What are you doing?

CYPHER

Midnight watch.

NEO

Is that... ?

CYPHER

The Matrix?  Yeah.

CYPHER

You want a drink?

CYPHER

I'll tell you, I feel for you,

man.  I really do.  Most of us

were still young, just punks, when

Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you

had a real life.

CYPHER

Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.

It's good for two things:

degreasing engines and killing

brain cells.

CYPHER

Did he tell you why he did it?

CYPHER,

I'll be the didn't tell you that

this wasn't the first time he

thought he found the One.

CYPHER

Let me give you a piece of advice.

Between you and me, if Morpheus

says you can fly, I wouldn't go

jumping out any windows to find

out if he's right.  Understand?

CYPHER

Welcome to the real world!

CYPHER

That's what he said to me nine

years ago.

CYPHER

The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

CYPHER

You know what real is?  I'll tell

you what real is.

CYPHER

Real is just another four-letter

word.

AGENT SMITH

Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

CYPHER

Mmm, so, so fucking good.

CYPHER

You know, I know that this steak

doesn't exist.  I know when I put

it in my mouth, the Matrix is

telling my brain that it is juicy

and delicious.  After nine years,

do you know what I've realized?

CYPHER

Ignorance is bliss.

AGENT SMITH

Then we have a deal?

CYPHER

I don't want to remember nothing.

Nothing!  You understand?  And I

want to be rich.  Someone

important.  Like an actor.  You

can do that, right?

AGENT SMITH

Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

CYPHER

All right.  You get my body back

in a power plant, reinsert me into

the Matrix and I'll get you what

you want.

AGENT SMITH

Access codes to Zion.

CYPHER

I told you, I don't know them.

But I can give you the man who

does.

AGENT SMITH

Morpheus.

NEO

Jeez, I was wondering about that.

TANK

What?

NEO

Why I was bald here but not in the

Matrix.

TANK

R.S.I.

NEO

Residual self image.

TANK

Good.  Now what's this?

NEO

Life systems monitor, glucose

levels.

TANK

What's that?

NEO

Main power supply to the core.

TANK

How about this?

NEO

Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all

remaining power to generate an...

E.M.P?

TANK

Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best

weapon against the machines.  The

problem is if someone is still in

the Matrix when that thing goes

off, they're not coming back.

MORPHEUS

How's he doing?

TANK

We just finished the operation

programs and he's showing great

retention.

MORPHEUS

Good.  I want everyone alerted to

12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.

Neo, it's time for you to know why

you're here.

NEO

What's he talking about?

TANK

He's taking you into the Matrix to

see her.

NEO

See who?

TANK

The Oracle.

MORPHEUS

We're in.

MORPHEUS

Mouse and Cable hold the exit.

Let's go.

NEO

Did you have to do this?

TRINITY

Yeah.

NEO

What did she tell you?

TRINITY

Lots of things.

NEO

Any of them true?

TRINITY

Some of them.

GIZMO

Were they good or bad?

TRINITY

There's no point in worrylng.

Whatever is going to happen is

going to happen.

MORPHEUS

We should be back in an hour.

MORPHEUS

Do you now understand what it

means when we say, if you're not

one of us, you're one of them?

NEO

The agents.  They're sentient

programs.  They can commandeer any

software hardwired to the

mainframe.

MORPHEUS

Anyone that is still in a power

plant.  That is why we try to be

invisible in the Matrix.

NEO

The best hacking is always

traceless.

MOJO

Morpheus, been a long time coming.

MORPHEUS

You're looking well, Mojo.

MOJO

You bringing us geriatrics now.

Morpheus?

MOJO

Guess you are locking for a

miracle.

MOJO

All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

REX

You're late.

NEO

What -- what happened?

MORPHEUS

This is the temple.  It is a part

of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden

inside the Matrix so that we can

access it.

PRIESTESS

Hello, Morpheus.  We've been

expecting you.

MORPHEUS

Okay, you're on your own.  Go with

them.

PRIESTESS

Wait here.  Among the other

Potentials.

SPOON BOY

Your spoon does not bend because

it is just that, a spoon.  Mine

bends because there is no spoon,

just my mind.

SPOON BOY

Link yourself to the spoon.

Become the spoon and bend

yourself.

NEO

There is no spoon.  Right.

PRIESTESS

The Oracle will see you now.

NEO

Hello?

VOICE (O.S.)

Just come on in.

NEO

Hello?

ORACLE (WOMAN)

I know.  You're Neo.  Be right

with you.

NEO

You're the Oracle?

ORACLE

Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing

you non-believers.  It's really a

relief.  All that pomp and

circumstances just plain tucker me

out.  Almost done.  Smell good,

don't they?

NEO

Yeah.

ORACLE

I'd ask you to sit down, but

you're not going to anyway.  And

don't worry about the vase.

NEO

What vase?

ORACLE

The vase.

NEO

Shit, I'm sorry.

ORACLE

I said don't worry about it.  I'll

get one of my kids to fix it.

NEO

How did you know...?

ORACLE

What's really going to bake your

noodle later on is, would you

still have broken it if I hadn't

said anything.

ORACLE

You're cuter than I thought.  I

see why she likes you.

NEO

Who?

ORACLE

Not too bright, though.

ORACLE

You know why Morpheus brought you

to see me?

NEO

I think so.

ORACLE

So? What do you think?  You think

you're the one?

NEO

I don't know.

ORACLE

You know what that means?  It's

Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

ORACLE

Well, let's have a look at you.

ORACLE

Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

ORACLE

Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but

it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news

is, you're not the one.  Still got

a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

NEO

What's the good news?

ORACLE

Same as the bad news, you're not

the one.

NEO

Is that it, then?

ORACLE

No.  Here.

ORACLE

You better take a cookie.  Got a

big day ahead of you.

ORACLE

Make a believer out of you yet.

MORPHEUS

You don't have to tell me

anything, Neo, because I already

know what she said.

NEO

You do?

MORPHEUS

I brought you so that you could

hear it for yourself.  I knew it

would help.

MORPHEUS

No one will ever ask you because

it is a gift from her.  It is for

you and you alone.

TRINITY

Here they come.

TANK

Weird.  This area never has this

much activity.

MOUSE

Welcome to Movie-Phone.

TANK (V.O.)

They're on their way.

MOUSE

Right.

MOUSE

Let's get to work.

NEO

Whoa.  Deja vu.

TANK

Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

TRINITY

What did you just say?

NEO

Nothing.  Just had a little deja

vu.

TRINITY

What happened?  What did you see?

NEO

A black cat went past us and then

I saw another that looked just

like it.

TRINITY

How much like it?  Was it the same

cat?

NEO

It might have been.  I'm not sure.

NEO

What is it?

TRINITY

A deja vu is usually a glitch in

the Matrix.  It happens when they

change something.

TANK

It's a trap!

MORPHEUS

Come on!

CABLE

Did you just feel something weird?

MOUSE

Yeah...

MOUSE

What's going on?

TANK (V.O.)

They cut the hard-line!  It's a

trap!  Get out!

CABLE

Oh, no.

TANK

No, no, no.

CABLE

Morpheus!  It's a trap --

TRINITY

Oh, God.

CYPHER

That's what they changed.  We're

trapped.  There's no way out.

MORPHEUS

Give me your phone.

TRINITY

They'll be able to track it.

MORPHEUS

We have no choice.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Tank, find a structural drawing of

this building and find it fast.

TANK

Got it.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

I need the main wet-wall.

TANK (V.O.)

Now left and that's it in front of

you.

MORPHEUS

Good.

AGENT SMITH

Eighth floor.  They're on the

eighth floor.

AGENT BROWTJ

Eighth floor!  Move!

AGENT BROWN

Where are they?

COP

They're in the walls!

AGENT SMITH

Are orders that hard to follow?

I'll say it again.  Morpheus must

be taken alive.  Understand?

AGENT SMITH

How like a rodent.

COP

I got him!  I got him!

MORPHEUS

Come on!

TANK

Nerve gas.

AGENT SMITH

We have them now.

MORPHEUS

You have to get Neo out.

Understand?  That's all that

matters now.

TRINITY

Morpheus, don't --

MORPHEUS

He must get out.  Do you

understand me?

COPS

There he is!  That's him!

COP

He's heading for the street!

AGENT SMITH

So, we meet at last.

MORPHEUS

And you are?

AGENT SMITH

Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

MORPHEUS

You all look the same to me.

AGENT SMITH

I've been waiting for this noment.

MORPHEUS

Oh, so have I.

AGENT SMITH

You can't win.

MORPHEUS

I already have.

AGENT SMITH

Take him.

TANK

No!

AGENT JONES

The others were lost.

AGENT SMITH

You've taken care of Reagan?

AGENT SMITH

Then the others do not matter.

TRINITY

We need a phone.

TANK

We gotta find the others.  They're

still alive.

TANK

Operator.

CYPHER (V.O.)

I need an exit!  Fast!

TANK

Cypher?  I thought they had you?

CYPHER

There was an accident.  A fucking

car accident.  All of a sudden.

Boom.  They're all dead.  I still

got the shakes but, Jesus,

someone's going to make a believer

out of me.

DOZER

There he is.

TANK

I got you.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Just get me outta here.

TANK (V.O.)

Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.

An old appliance store.

CYPHER

An actor.  Definitely.

TANK

Operator.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Tank, it's me.

TRINITY

We need an exit!

TANK (V.O.)

Gotcha.  You're not far from

Cypher.

TRINITY

Cypher, I thought --

TANK (V.O.)

So did we.  That boy's got nine

lives.  I sent him to Franklin and

Erie.

TRINITY

Got it.

TANK

Got him.

DOZER

System check looks fine.

DOZER

You okay?

CYPHER

Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing

me.

CYPHER

We got any pain killers?

DOZER

The first aid kit's over here.

DOZER

No!

SWITCH

God, I love that sound.

TRINITY

You first,.Neo.

TRINITY

What happened?

NEO

I don't know.  It just went dead.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Hello, Trinity.

TRINITY

Cypher?  Where's Tank?

CYPHER (V.O.)

He had an accident.

TRINITY

An accident?  What about Dozer?

Is Dozer there?

CYPHER

You know, for a long time, I

thought I was in love with you,

Trinity.  I used to dream about

you...

CYPHER

You are a beautiful woman.  Too

bad things had to work out like

this.

TRINITY

You killed them.

APOC

What?!

SWITCH

Oh God.

CYPHER

In a way you're very lucky.  Most

people never know why they die.

One minute they're alive, the next

they're dead.  No warning.

Nothing.  That's why I thought

maybe I should tell you.  It

seemed the least I could do.

CYPHER

You see, the truth, the real,truth

is that the war is over.  It's

been over for a long time.  And

guess what?  We lost!  Did you

hear that?  We lost the war!

TRINITY

What about Zion?

CYPHER

Zion?  Zion is a part of this

delusion.  More of this madness.

That's why this has to be done.

It has to end.  Now and forever.

TRINITY

Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.

You gave them Morpheus for the

access codes to Zion.

CYPHER

You see, Trinity, we humans have a

place in the future.  But it's not

here.  It's in the Matrix.

TRINITY

The Matrix isn't real!

CYPHER

Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I

disagree.  I think the Matrix is

more real than this world.  I

mean, all I do is pull a plug

here.  But there, you watch a man

die.

CYPHER

You tell me which is more real.

CYPHER

Welcome to the real world, right?

TRINITY

Somehow, some way, you're going to

pay for this.

CYPHER

Pay for it?  I'm not even going to

remember it.  It'll be like it

never happened.  The tree falling

in the forest.  It doesn't make a

sound.

TRINITY

Goddamn you, Cypher!

CYPHER

Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just

the messenger.  And right now I'm

going to prove that the message is

true.

CYPHER

If Morpheus was right, then

there's no way I can pull this

plug, is there?

CYPHER

If he is the One, then in the next

few seconds there has to be some

kind of miracle to stop me.

Because if he dies like the others

that means Morpheus was wrong.

How can he be the One if he's

dead?

TANK

How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing

you're about to die?

NEO

It's Tank!  He's alive.

TRINITY

We should, we should hurry.

NEO

Yeah.  Right.

TRINITY

Tank, you're hurt.

TANK

I'll be all right.

TRINITY

Dozer?

TRINITY

I'm sorry, Tank.

AGENT JONES

There is a problem.  Reagan has

failed to secure the hardware.

AGENT SMITH

Never send a human to do a

machine's job.

AGENT JONES

But if Reagan has failed, why

haven't they pulled the plug?

AGENT SMITH

Haven't you learned by now, that

it is impossible to understand why

they do the things they do?

AGENT SMITH

Continue as planned.  Trace his

signal to locate their position

and deploy an extermination unit.

NEO

What are they doing to him?

TANK

They're cracking his mind.

NEO

How?

TANK

They inject virus-like serums to

break down the system.  It's like

cracking a computer.  All it takes

is time.

NEO

How much time?

TANK

Depends on the mind.  But

eventually, it will crack and his

alpha pattern will change from

this to this.

TANK

When it does, Morpheus will tell

them anything they want to know.

NEO

The access codes to Zion.

TANK

If an agent got inside Zion's

mainframe he could do anything.

Disable the defense system. It

would be the end of us.

TANK

We can't let that happen.  We have

to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be

protected.

TRINITY

Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

TANK

We have to pull the plug.

TRINITY

No!

TANK

We don't have any other choice.

TANK

Trinity, what are you doing?

TRINITY

I'm going in after him.

TANK

Morpheus could conform at any

minute --

TRINITY

If he does I'm sure you'll do what

has to be done.

TANK

You saw that place.  It's suicide.

TANK

I know what Morpheus means to

you --

TRINITY

No.  No, I don't think you do.  If

you did, then you would know that

I'm not letting him go.  Not

without a fight, Tank.

TRINITY

Not without a fight.

AGENT SMITH

Have you ever stood and stared at

it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its

beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of

people just living out their

lives... oblivious.

AGENT SMITH

Did you know that the first Matrix

was designed to be a perfect human

world?  Where none suffered, where

everyone would be happy.  It was a

disaster.  No one would accept the

program.  Entire crops were lost.

AGENT SMITH

Some believed we lacked the

programming language to describe

your perfect world.  But I believe

that, as a species, human beings

define their reality through

suffering and misery.

AGENT SMITH

The perfect world was a dream that

your primitive cerebrum kept

trying to wake up from.  Which is

why the Matrix was re-designed to

this:  the peak of your

civilization.

AGENT SMITH

I say 'your civilization' because

as soon as we start thinking for

you, it really becomes our

civilization, which is, of course,

what this is all about.

AGENT SMITH

Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

AGENT SMITH

Like the dinosaur.  Look out that

window.  You had your time.

AGENT SMITH

The future is our world, Morpheus.

The future is our time.

TRINITY

What do you think you're doing?

NEO

You need help.  I'm coming with

you.

TRINITY

No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed

himself so you could escape.

There's no way you're going back

in.

NEO

Morpheus did what he did because

he believed that I'm something

that I'm not.

TRINITY

What?

NEO

I'm not the One, Trinity.  The

Oracle told me.

NEO

She said I had a gift but I still

had a lot to learn.  She told me

maybe next life.

TRINITY

Did you tell Morpheus?

NEO

Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.

He'd still believe what he wanted

to believe.  But Morpheus is the

one that matters.  He's more

important than me and we both know

it.

NEO

I may not be what Morpheus thinks

I am, but if I don't try to help

him, then I'm not even what I

think I am.

TRINITY

What are you?

NEO

His friend.

AGENT SMITH

I'd like to share a revelation

that I've had during my time here.

It came to me when I tried to

classify your species.  I've

realized that you are not actually

mammals.

AGENT SMITH

Every mammal on this planet

instinctively develops a natural

equilibrium with the surrounding

environment.  But you humans do

not.  You move to an area and you

multiply and multiply until every

natural resource is consumed and

the only way you can survive is to

spread to another area.

AGENT SMITH

There is another organism on this

planet that follows the same

pattern.  Do you know what it is?

A virus.

AGENT SMITH

Human beings are a disease, a

cancer of this planet.  You are a

plague.  And we are... the cure.

TANK

Okay.  Store's open.  What do you

need?

TRINITY (V.O.)

Guns.  Lots of guns.

TANK

Coming right up.

TRINITY

No one has ever done anything like

this.

NEO

Yeah?

NEO

That's why it's going to work.

AGENT SMITH

Why isn't the serum working?

AGENT BROWN

Perhaps we are asking the wrong

questions.

AGENT JONES

Or he doesn't know.

AGENT SMITH

Of course he knows.  He's

resisting.

AGENT BROWN

How?

AGENT SMITH

I don't know.  If I knew...

AGENT SMITH

Leave me with him.

AGENT SMITH

Now!

TANK

Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming

for you.  They're coming.

AGENT SMITH

Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm

going to be honest with you.

AGENT SMITH

I hate this place.  This zoo.

This prison.  This reality,

whatever you want to call it, I

can't stand it any longer.  It's

the smell, if there is such a

thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I

can taste your stink and every

time I do, I fear that I've

somehow been infected by it.

AGENT SMITH

Repulsive, isn't it?

AGENT SMITH

I must get out of here, I must get

free.  In this mind is tlie key.

My key.

AGENT SMITH

Once Zion is gone, there's no

need for me to be here.  Do you

understand?  I need the codes.  I

have to get inside Zion.  You have

to tell me how.

AGENT SMITH

Tell me!  Tell me!

AGENT BROWN

What were you doing?

AGENT JONES

You don't know.

AGENT SMITH

Know what?

AGENT JONES

I think they're trying to save

him.

NEO

There is no spoon.

AGENT JONES

Lower level --

AGENT BROWN

They are actually attacking.

AGENT SMITH

Find them and destroy them!

PILOT

I repeat, we are under attack!

NEO

Trinity!

NEO

... help.

AGENT JONES

Only human...

TRINITY

Dodge this, motherfucker!

NEO

Thanks.

TRINITY

You're hit --

NEO

I'm fine.

NEO

Can you fly that thing?

TRINITY

Not yet.

TANK

Operator.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Tank, I need a pilot program for a

military M-109 helicopter.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Hurry!

TRINITY

Let's go.

SERGEANT

Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --

we've lost communication with the

roof!

AGENT JONES

SERGEANT

But, sir -- the fire -- we should

evacuate!

AGENT JONES

You will do as you are ordered!

SERGEANT

Yes, sir.

AGENT SMITH

No.

NEO

Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

AGENT SMITH

Nooo!

NEO

He won't make it.

NEO

Gotcha!

TRINITY

Shit-shit-no!

NEO

Oh fuck.

TANK

He's the One.  He's got to be...

MORPHEUS

I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

TRINITY

Morpheus!

MORPHEUS

Do you believe me now?  He's the

One!  Who else could have done

this?

NEO

Morpheus, I know you won't believe

me but the Oracle told ne I'm not

the One.

MORPHEUS

It doesn't matter if I don't

believe you --

MORPHEUS

What matters is that you don't

believe her.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Tank, get us out of here.

TANK

Got one ready.  An underground El

station.  State and Balbo.

TRINITY (V.O.)

See ya soon.

TANK

See ya soon.

AGENT BROWN

The trace was completed.

AGENT JONES

We have their position.

AGENT BROWN

The extermination unit is in

place.

AGENT JONES

Order the strike.

AGENT SMITH

They're not out yet.

NEO

Don't!

OLD MAN

I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

NEO

Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

TRINITY

What happened?  Was that --

NEO

It was nobody.

NEO

Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

TRINITY

Morpheus is right, you know.  It

doesn't matter what he believes or

even what the Oracle believes.

What matters is what you believe.

NEO

I believe...

NEO

I want to kiss you.

TRINITY

I want to kiss you too...

TRINITY

But I want it to be real.

TRINITY

Neo!

TANK

What the hell just happened?

TRINITY

An Agent!  You have to send me

back!

TANK

I can't!

AGENT SMITH

You're empty.

NEO

So are you.

AGENT SMITH

You can't win.

NEO

I already have.

TRINITY

Jesus, he's killing him!

TRINITY

Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!

TANK

I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm

looking!

TRINITY

What is it... oh no.

TRINITY

Sentinels.

AGENT SMITH

Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

AGENT SMITH

That is the sound of

inevitability.

AGENT SMITH

It is the sound of your death.

AGENT SMITH

Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

NEO

My name is Neo.

TRINITY

You can't use that until Neo is

out!

MORPHEUS

I know.  Don't worry, he'll make

it.

TANK

Operator.

NEO (V.O.)

Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out

of here!

NEO

Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious

pursuit!

TRINITY

Neo, you better get your ass back

here!

NEO

I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

TANK (V.O.)

I got one!

TANK (V.O.)

Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

TANK (V.O.)

Room 303.

TANK

I'm going to make the call.

MORPHEUS

Do it!

TRINITY

Where is he?

TANK

Almost there.

MORPHEUS

He's going to make it.

TRINITY

Hurry, Neo.

AGENT SMITH

Check him.

TRINITY

No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!

You can't be dead!

AGENT BROWN

He's gone.

AGENT SMITH

I told you, you couldn't win.

TRINITY

You're right here.  I'm holding

you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.

Do you hear me?  I won't let you

go.

TRINITY

Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!

Not now!

TRINITY

Not now!

TRINITY

Now get up!

AGENT SMITH

Nooooo!

TRINITY

Now!

TRINITY

Neo?

FADE TO BLACK.

NEO (V.O.)

Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out

there.  I know you're working as

fast as you can to catch me.

NEO (V.O.)

I thought I should call and let

you know how things stand.

NEO (V.O.)

I know you're real proud of this

world you've built, the way it

works, all the nice little rules

and such, but I've got some bad

news.

NEO (V.O.)

I've decided to make a few

changes.

BOY

Mommy!  Mommy!

MOMMY

What?

BOY

That man!  That man flies!

MOMMY

Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't

fly.

FADE OUT.

THE END
