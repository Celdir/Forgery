DR. EVIL

(face always unseen)

Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.

As you know, my plot to high-jack

nuclear weapons and hold the world

hostage has failed.  Again.  This

organization will not tolerate

failure.

DR. EVIL

Mustafa...

DR. EVIL

Frau Farbissina...

DR. EVIL

I spared your lives because I need

you to help me rid the world of the

only man who can stop me now.  We

must go to London.  I've set a trap

for Austin Powers!

AUSTIN

(taking photos)

Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout

for me baby.  Smashing!

AUSTIN

Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

(beat)

No.  No.

AUSTIN

Get these off to Fab Magazine right

away.

SUPERMODEL 1

Austin, you've really outdone yourself

this time.

AUSTIN

Thanks, baby.

SUPERMODEL 2

(suggestively)

We could have another photo session

back at my flat.

AUSTIN

(coyly)

Oh, behave!

SUPERMODEL 3

Austin, I love you!

AUSTIN

So many women, so little time.

MOD GIRL 1

It's Austin Powers!

AUSTIN

Judo chop!  Judo chop!

AUSTIN

You might want to protest a bit louder

next time, luv.

AUSTIN

Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

MRS. KENSINGTON

Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING

RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a

distinctive PHONE RING.

MRS. KENSINGTON

That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief

of British Intelligence.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(on picture phone)

Hello, Austin.  This is Basil

Exposition, Chief of British

Intelligence.

AUSTIN

We know all that, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

I just wanted to be extremely clear

so that everyone knows what's going

on at any given time.  We've just

received word that Dr. Evil, the

ultimate square, is planning to take

over the world.

AUSTIN

Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in

jail for good.

BASIL EXPOSITION

I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week,

Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel

Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's

planning a trap for you tonight at

the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat

Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus

here in swinging London.

AUSTIN

Just where you'd never think to look

for him.  We'll be there.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Good luck, Austin.

AUSTIN

Thank you.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Oh, and Austin&emdash;

AUSTIN

Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION

(pause)

Be careful.

AUSTIN

Thank you.

(to Mrs. Kensington)

Let's go, baby!

MICK JAGGER

Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick

Jagger.

AUSTIN

Hey, Mick!

MICK JAGGER

Are you more satisfied now sexually,

Austin?

AUSTIN

Well, you can't always get what you

want.

MICK JAGGER

(thinking)

"You can't always get what you want!"

That's a great title for a song!

I'm

AUSTIN

Good on ya, man.

MICK JAGGER

Groovy!

ANDY WARHOL

Austin Powers?  Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

AUSTIN

Hey, how are you?

ANDY WARHOL

Hungry.

AUSTIN

Here, have this can of Campbell's

Tomato Soup.

ANDY WARHOL

I'm going to paint this can of soup

and become famous and not give you

any credit for it.

AUSTIN

If you can become famous, everyone

will have their fifteen minutes of

fame, man.

ANDY WARHOL

"Fifteen minutes of fame?"  I'm going

to use that quote and not give you

any credit for that, either.

AUSTIN

Smashing!

QUEEN

Austin Powers, Britain owes you a

debt of gratitude.

QUEEN

I understand you were wounded.  Where

were you hit?

AUSTIN

In the but-tocks.

QUEEN

That must be a sight.  I'd kind of

like to see that.

QUEEN

(laughing)

Nice buttocks.

MRS. KENSINGTON

We've got to find Dr. Evil!

AUSTIN

Wait, I've got an idea.

EVERYONE

Ohhh!

MRS. KENSINGTON

Austin, why in God's name did you

strike that woman?

AUSTIN

That ain't no woman!  It's a man,

man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's

assassins.

AUSTIN

Where's Doctor Evil?

AUSTIN

I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

DR. EVIL

(unseen, through mist)

Not this time.  Come, Mr.

Bigglesworth!

(calling out)

See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

MRS. KENSINGTON

My God!  He's freezing himself.

DR. EVIL (V.O.)

(shivering)

I'll be back, Mr. Powers, when free

love is dead, and greed and avarice

once again rule the world.

RADAR OPERATOR

(on phone)

Commander Gilmour?

RADAR OPERATOR

(on phone)

Commander, this is Slater in SoWest

Com Three.  We have a potential bogey

with erratic vectoring and an

unorthodox entry angle.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

(on phone)

Is it one of ours?

RADAR OPERATOR

No.  Log Com Bird Twelve says its

metalurg recon analysis is a standard

alloy, not stealthy, not carbon-

composite.

(pause)

It does have an odd shape, sir.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

What are you saying, son?

RADAR OPERATOR

It appears to be in the shape of

Bob's Big Boy, sir.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Oh my God, he's back.

RADAR OPERATOR

In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never

left, sir.  He's always offered the

same high quality meals at competitive

prices.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Shut up.

RADAR OPERATOR

Should we scramble TacHQ for an

intercept?

COMMANDER GILMOUR

What's its current position?

RADAR SCREEN

It was over Nevada, but...oh my God!

It's gone!

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Listen son, I want you to forget

what you saw here tonight.

RADAR OPERATOR

Commander, I have to log it&emdash;

COMMANDER GILMOUR

That's a direct order.  You didn't

see a thing!

COMMANDER GILMOUR

(into phone)

Philips.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Call the President

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Prepare the jet...

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Get my overnight bag.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Philips, do me a favor and feed my

fish.

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Not too much!

COMMANDER GILMOUR

I'm going to London, England.

BASIL EXPOSITION

As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had

himself frozen in 1967.  Soon after,

Austin Powers volunteered to have

himself frozen, in the event Dr.

Evil should ever return.  We believe

Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot

to take over the world.  And that,

gentlemen, is why we're here.

COMMAND GILMOUR

Outstanding re-cap, Exposition.

BORSCHEVSKY

Who is this Austin Powers?  Is he a

British operative?

BASIL EXPOSITION

No, he worked freelance, an

internationally renowned swinging

photographer by day and the ultimate

gentlemen spy by night.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Attention, Stage One, laser cutting

beginning.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Laser cutting complete.  Stage Two,

warm liquid goo phase beginning.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Warm liquid goo phases complete.

Stage Three, reanimation beginning.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Reanimation complete.  Stage Four,

cleansing beginning.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Cleansing complete.  Stage Five,

evacuation beginning.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER (PA)

Evacuation com...

FEMALE ANNOUNCER

Evacuation...

(waiting)

Complete!  The cryogenic state of

Austin Powers is now completed.

AUSTIN

(weakly)

Where am I?

BASIL EXPOSITION

You're in the Ministry of Defense.

It's 1997.  You've been cryogenically

frozen for thirty years.

AUSTIN

(shouting)

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

BASIL EXPOSITION

The shouting is a temporary side-

effect of the unfreezing process.

AUSTIN

Yes, I'm having trouble

controlling&emdash;

(shouting)

THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!

BASIL EXPOSITION

You might also experience a slight

fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at

moments of extreme relaxation.

Austin, this is Commander Gilmour,

Strategic Command, and General

Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.

AUSTIN

Russian Intelligence?  Are you mad?

BASIL EXPOSITION

A lot's happened since you were

frozen, Austin.  The cold war's over.

AUSTIN

Thank God.  Those capitalist dogs

will finally pay for their crimes

against the people,

BASIL EXPOSITION

We won, Austin.

AUSTIN

Groovy.  Smashing!  Good on ya!

(to Gilmour)

Nice tie.  Yea capitalism!

COMMANDER GILMOUR

Mr. Powers, the President's very

concerned.  We've got a madman on

the loose in Nevada.

BASIL EXPOSITION

It's Dr. Evil.

AUSTIN

When do I begin?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Immediately.  You'll be working with

Ms. Kensington.

AUSTIN

You mean Mrs. Kensington?

BASIL EXPOSITION

No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long-

since retired.  Ms. Kensington is

her daughter.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Vanessa's one of our top agents.

AUSTIN

(out loud, to himself)

My God, Vanessa's got a smashing

body.  I bet she shags like a minx.

How do I tell them that because of

the unfreezing process, I have no

inner monologue?

(pause)

I hope I didn't say that out loud

just now.

VANESSA

Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate

you to the Nineties.  You know, a

lot's changed since 1967.

AUSTIN

Well, as long as people are still

having promiscuous sex with many

anonymous partners without protection,

while at the same time experimenting

with mind-expanding

VANESSA

My mother's told me all about you.

AUSTIN

If it's a lie, goddamn her.  It it's

the truth, goddamn me.

(pause)

God, I hope that's witty.  How's

your mum?

VANESSA

My mother's doing quite well, thank

you very much.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Yes, well...Agent Kensington will

get you set up.  She's very dedicated.

Perhaps, a little too dedicated.

(aside to Austin)

She's got a bit of a bug up her ass.

Good luck, Austin, the world's

depending on you.

AUSTIN

Thank you, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Oh, and Austin&emdash;

AUSTIN

Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Be careful.

AUSTIN

Thanks.

VANESSA

Let's gather your personal effects,

shall we?

CLERK

(reading)

Danger Powers, personal effects.

AUSTIN

Actually, my name's Austin Powers.

CLERK

It says here, name Danger Powers.

AUSTIN

Danger's my middle name.

CLERK

OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue

crushed-velvet suit.  One frilly

lace cravat.  One gold medallion

with peace symbol.  One pair of

Italian shoes.  One pair of tie-dyed

socks, purple.  One vinyl recording

album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas.

One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.

AUSTIN

(embarrassed)

That's not mine.

CLERK

(reading)

One credit card receipt for Swedish-

made penis enlarger pump, signed

Austin Powers.

AUSTIN

I'm telling you, baby, that's not

mine.

CLERK

(reading)

One warranty card for Swedish-made

penis enlarger pump, filled out by

Austin Powers.

AUSTIN

I don't even know what this is.

This sort of thing ain't my bag,

baby.

CLERK

(reading)

One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger

Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is

My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.

AUSTIN

OK, OK man, don't get heavy, I'll

sign.  Just to get things moving,

baby.

VANESSA

Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward

to working with you, but do me a

favor and stop calling me baby.  You

can address me as Agent Kensington.

We have to leave immediately.  We've

preserved your private jet just as

you left it.  It's waiting at Heathrow

Airport.

AUSTIN

(excited)

My jumbo jet?  Smashing baby.

AUSTIN

Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How

does a hot chick like you end up

working at the Ministry of Defense?

VANESSA

I went to Oxford and excelled in

several subjects, but I ended up

specializing in foreign languages.

I wanted to travel -- see the world.

In my last year I was accepted into

the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies

sector.  I thought I was off on an

exciting career, but my job was to

read everything printed in every

country.  It's very boring.  My whole

day is spent reading wedding

announcements in Farsi.  If I do

well with this case, I finally get

promoted to field operative...

AUSTIN

That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen,

why don't we go into the back and

shag?

VANESSA

I beg your pardon?

AUSTIN

I've been frozen for thirty years,

man, I want to see if my bits and

pieces are still working.

VANESSA

Excuse me?

AUSTIN

My wedding tackle.

VANESSA

I'm sorry?

AUSTIN

My meat and two veg.

VANESSA

Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you

must be a little confused, but we

have a very serious situation at

hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd

concentrate on our mission and give

your libido a rest.

AUSTIN

Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

VANESSA

A Chigro?

AUSTIN

You know, a Chigro&emdash; part

Chinese, part Negro&emdash; Chigro.

VANESSA

(offended)

We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.

It's considered offensive.

AUSTIN

That's right.  You're supposed to

say 'colored' now, right?

(spotting the flight

attendants)

Here's the stewardesses!  Bring on

the sexy stews!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?

We're called 'flight attendants'

now, thank you very much.

AUSTIN

Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a

whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There

are a few things we need to discuss.

First of all, we're not wearing these.

AUSTIN

Seems pretty straightforward, don't

you think...listen darling, I think

you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get

your telephone number?

FLGHT ATTENDANT

(mock sexy)

Sure, it's easy to remember.

(writing on his hand)

It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare

the craft for take-off now.

AUSTIN

Smashing!  When we land I'll give

you a tinkle on the telling bone.

AUSTIN

Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's

two things I know about life: one,

Americans will never take to soccer.

Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses

love to shag!

VANESSA

Sure.

AUSTIN

Do I make you horny?

VANESSA

What?

AUSTIN

Do I make you horny?  Randy, you

know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

VANESSA

I hope this is part of the unfreezing

process.

AUSTIN

Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash;

that's what I do, I swing.

VANESSA

I understand that, Mr. Powers, but

let me be perfectly clear with you,

perhaps to the point of being

insulting.  I will never have sex

with you, ever.  If you were the

last man on Earth and I was the last

woman on Earth, and the future of

the human race depended on our having

sex simply for procreation, I still

would not have sex with you.

AUSTIN

What's you point, Vanessa?

COMPUTER VOICE

You've got mail!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Hello Austin.  Hello Vanessa.  This

is Basil Exposition, from British

Intelligence.

AUSTIN

Thank you, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Oh, and Austin&emdash;

AUSTIN

Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Be careful.

PILOT

(over loudspeaker)

Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning

our final descent into Las Vegas

International Airport.  Flight

attendants will be coming by to

collect your drinks, and I'll ask

you at this time to please return to

the main cabin and put your

DR. EVIL

(face again unseen)

Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a

long time, but I'm back.  It's all

gone perfectly to plan except for

one small flaw.  Because of a

technical error, my right arm was

not frozen.  I was therefore by

definition only partially frozen.

MUSTAFA

But my design was perfect!  Your

autonomic functions were shut down,

and even though your arm wasn't

frozen, the aging was retarded,

therefore your right arm is only

slightly older than the left.

DR. EVIL

Can't you see I'm only half a man?

Look at me, I'm a freak!

MUSTAFA

But Dr. Evil, all you need to do

is&emdash;

(holding up tennis

ball)

--work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze

it for twenty minutes a day.  A few

months of that and it'll be just as

strong as the other arm...

DR. EVIL

And look what you've done to Mr.

Bigglesworth!

MUSTAFA

We could not anticipate feline

complications due to the reanimation

process&emdash;

DR. EVIL

(face unseen)

Silence!

MUSTAFA

(blood-curdling scream)

Ahhhhhhhhh!

DR. EVIL

(face unseen)

Let this be a reminder to you all

that this organization will not

tolerate failure.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

DR. EVIL

We've got a lot of work to do.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)

(muffled)

Someone help me!  I'm still alive,

only I'm very badly burned.

DR. EVIL

(slightly distracted)

Some of you I know, some of you I'm

meeting for the first time.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)

(muffled)

Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone

call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a

lot of pain.

DR. EVIL

(very frustrated)

You've all been gathered here to

form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)

(muffled)

If somebody can open the retrieval

hatch down here, I could get out.

See, I designed this device myself

and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you

found me.  Listen, I'm very badly

burned, so if you could just&emdash;

SFX:  Muffled Gunshot

MUSTAFA (O.S.)

(muffled)

Ow!  You shot me!

DR. EVIL

Right.  Okay.  Moving on.

MUSTAFA (O.S.)

(muffled)

You shot me right in the arm!  Why

did&emdash; SFX:  Muffled Gunshot.

Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing.

DR. EVIL

Let me go around the table and

introduce everyone.  Frau

Farbissina...

DR. EVIL

...founder of the militant wing of

the Salvation Army.  Random Task...

DR. EVIL

...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman

extraordinaire.  Show them what you

do.

DR. EVIL

Thank you, Random Task.  Patty

O'Brien...

DR. EVIL

...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark?

DR. EVIL

A superstitious man, he leaves a

tiny keepsake on every victim he

kills.  Scotland Yard would love to

get their hands on that piece of

evidence.

PATTY O'BRIEN

(heavy Irish accent)

Yes, they're always after me lucky

charms!

PATTY O'BRIEN

What?  What?  Why does everyone always

laugh when I say that?  They are

after me lucky charms.

PATTY O'BRIEN

(angry)

What?

FRAU FARBISSINA

(through suppressed

laughter)

It's a television commercial with

this little cartoon Leprechaun who

is a benevolent imp who is very

concerned that these children will

steal his lucky charms which are

foodstuffs fashioned into various

shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers,

what have you...

(pause)

It's a long story.

DR. EVIL

Finally, I come to my number two

man.  His name:  Number Two.

DR. EVIL

For thirty years, Number Two has run

Virtucon, the legitimate face of my

evil empire.

NUMBER TWO

Over the last thirty years, Virtucon

has grown by leaps and bounds.  About

fifteen years ago, we changed from

volatile chemicals to the

communication industry.  We own cable

companies in thirty-eight states.

NUMBER TWO

In addition to our cable holdings,

we own a steel mill in Cleveland.

NUMBER TWO

Shipping in Texas.

NUMBER TWO

Oil refineries in Seattle.

NUMBER TWO

And a factory in Chicago that makes

miniature models of factories.

NUMBER TWO

We also own the Franklin mint, which

makes decorative hand-painted theme

plates for collectors.

(holds up plate)

Some plates, like the Gone With The

Wind series, have gone up in value

as much as two-hundred and forty

percent, but, as with any investment,

there is some risk involved.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called

blackmail.  The Royal Family of

Britain are the wealthiest landowners

in the world.  Either the Royal Family

pays us an exorbitant amount of money,

or we make it look like Prince

Charles, the heir to the throne, has

had an affair outside of marriage

and, therefore, they would have to

divorce.

NUMBER TWO

Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did

have an affair.  He admitted it, and

they are now divorced, actually.

DR. EVIL

People have to tell me these things.

I've been frozen for thirty years,

throw me a bone here.

(pausing)

OK, no problem.  Here's my second

plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a

weather changing machine that was in

essence a sophisticated heat beam

which we called a "laser."  Using

this laser, we punch a hole in the

protective layer around

NUMBER TWO

Umm, that also has already happened.

DR. EVIL

Right.

(pause)

Oh, hell, let's just do what we always

do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons

and hold the world hostage.

(pause)

Gentlemen, it's come to my attention

that a breakaway Russian Republic

called Kreplachistan will be

transferring a nuclear warhead to

the United Nations in a few days.

Here's the plan.  We get the warhead,

and we hold the world ransom...

(dramatic pause)

...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO

Don't you think we should ask for

more than a million dollars?  A

million dollars isn't that much money

these days.

DR. EVIL

All right then...

(dramatic pause)

...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO

Virtucon alone makes over nine billion

dollars a year.

DR. EVIL

(pleasantly surprised)

Oh, really?

(slightly irritated)

One-hundred billion dollars.

(pause)

OK, make it happen.  Anything else?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Remember when we froze your semen,

you said that if it looked like you

weren't coming back to try and make

you a son so that a part of you would

live forever?

DR. EVIL

Yes.

FRAU FARBISSINA

Well, after a few years, we got sort

of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you

to meet your son.

DR. EVIL

My son?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Yes.

(calling out)

Scott!

SCOTT EVIL

Hi.

DR. EVIL

Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr.

Evil.

(emotional)

I have a son!  I have a son!

Everyone, I have a son!

(gesturing to globe)

Someday, Scott, this will all be

yours.

SCOTT EVIL

I haven't seen you my whole life and

now you show up and want a

relationship?  I hate you!

AUSTIN

You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing!

VANESSA

Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a

secure cellular phone, an on-board

computer, and a Global Geosynchronous

Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally,

this.

AUSTIN

Let me guess.  The floss is garotte

wire, the toothpaste contains plastic

explosives, and the toothbrush is

the detonation device.

VANESSA

No, actually.  I don't know how to

put this really.  Well, there have

been fabulous advances in the field

of dentistry.

AUSTIN

Why?  What's wrong with my teeth?

AUSITN

Which side of the bed do you want?

VANESSA

You're going to sleep on the sofa.

I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers,

that the only reason we're sharing a

room is to support our cover story

that we're a married couple on

vacation.

AUSTIN

So, shall we shag now, or shall we

shag later?  How do you like to do

it?  Do you like to wash up first?

Top and tails?  A whore's bath?

Personally, before I'm on the job, I

like to give my undercarriage a bit

of a how's-your-father.

AUSTIN

(off her angry reaction)

I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to

get a rise out of you.

VANESSA

Let's unpack.

AUSTIN

Gor blimey, nerd alert.

AUSTIN

Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's

playing a prank on me!  Honestly,

this isn't mine.

VANESSA

(suffering)

I'm sure.

AUSTIN

I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-

ling.

MOVIE PHONE VOICE

(through handset)

Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM!

AUSTIN

I got her answering machine.

AUSTIN

I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot

my x-ray glasses.

VANESSA

Here, use mine.

AUSTIN

I'm going to use a cover name.  It's

important that it be a generic name

so that we don't draw attention to

ourselves.

AUSTIN

Do you mind if I join you?

NUMBER TWO

Not at all.

DEALER

Seventeen.

NUMBER TWO

Hit me.

DEALER

You have seventeen, sir.  The book

says not to, sir.

NUMBER TWO

I like to live dangerously.

DEALER

Four.  Twenty-one.

DEALER

(to Austin)

Eighteen.

(to Number Two)

Sixteen.

NUMBER TWO

I'll stay.

DEALER

(to Austin)

Sir?

DEALER

(to Austin)

Sir?

VANESSA

(quietly)

What's wrong?

AUSTIN

(quietly, to Vanessa)

I can't see a bloody thing.

VANESSA

Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're

prescription X-ray glasses.  I have

very bad astigmatism.

DEALER

Sir, the table is waiting.

AUSTIN

(panicking)

Uh, hit me.

DEALER

On an eighteen, sir?

AUSTIN

Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

NUMBER TWO

You're very brave.

AUSTIN

Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow

myself to introduce...myself.  My

name is Ritchie Cunningham.

AUSTIN

(indicating Vanessa)

This is my wife, Enid.

NUMBER TWO

My name is Number Two.

VANESSA

(rescuing him)

Number Two?  That's an unusual name.

NUMBER TWO

My parents were hippies.

(indicating Italian

woman)

This is my Italian confidential

secretary.

ITALIAN WOMAN

(Italian accent)

My name is Alotta

(quickly)

Alotta Fagina.

AUSTIN

I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.

It sounds like you're saying your

name is a lot of...never mind.

Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.

It's been a gas.

NUMBER TWO

Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham?

AUSTIN

Peace, baby.

VANESSA

Why did you leave so soon?

AUSTIN

That cat Number Two has an X-ray

eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him,

man.  Listen, we should go back to

the room, but first I have to go to

the naughty chair and see a man about

a dog.

TEXAN

Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy

food, you rent it.

AUSTIN

Too right, youth.

AUSTIN

(grunting)

Uh, uh!

TEXAN

Hey pardner, just relax, don't force

it!  Use some creative visualization.

PATTY O'BRIEN

(groaning)

Ughhhhh...

AUSTIN

Who does Number Two work for?

TEXAN

That's right!  Show that turd who's

boss!

AUSTIN

Who does Number Two work for?

PATTY O'BRIEN

(quietly, straining)

Go to hell.

TEXAN

Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

VANESSA

(into phone)

Hello Mum?

MRS. KENSINGTON

(on phone)

Oh, hello Vanessa.  How was the

flight?

VANESSA (V.O.)

Great.

MRS. KENSINGTON

How's Austin?

VANESSA (V.O.)

He's asleep.

MRS. KENSINGTON

You didn't...

VANESSA

Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the

couch.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

I'm proud of you.

VANESSA

Why?

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

Because you managed to resist Austin

Power's charms.

VANESSA

Well, God knows he tried, but I've

been rather firm with him, Mummy.

You didn't tell me he was so obsessed

with sex.  It's bizarre.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

You can't judge him by modern

standards.  He's very much a product

of his times.  In my day he could

have any woman he wanted.

VANESSA

What about his teeth?

MRS. KENSINGTON

You have to understand, in Britain

in the Sixties you could be a sex

symbol and still have bad teeth.  It

didn't matter.

VANESSA

I just don't see it.

MRS. KENSINGTON

Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in

his charms, it's impossible to get

out.

VANESSA

Did you ever...

MRS. KENSINGTON

Of course not.  I was married to

your father.

VANESSA

Did you ever want to?

MRS. KENSINGTON

Austin is very charming, very

debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has

a knowledge of fine wines,

sophisticated, a world-renowned

photographer.  Women want hin, men

want to be him.  He's a lover of

love&emdash; every bit an

International Man of Mystery.

VANESSA

You didn't answer my question, Mum.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

I know.  Let me just say this: Austin

was the most loyal and caring friend

I ever had.

AUSTIN (V.O.)

Good morning, luv, who are you on

the phone with?

VANESSA

(to her mother)

Do you want to talk to him?

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

No, it's been too long.  Best to

leave things alone.

VANESSA

(to Austin)

I'm on with a friend!

(to her mother)

Look, I'd better go.  I love you.

MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)

I love you, Vanessa.

AUSTIN

Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you

have on clean underwear.

VANESSA

Why?

AUSTIN

We've got a doctor's

appointment&emdash; an evil doctor's

appointment.

VANESSA

A limousine has just pulled up.

AUSTIN

Let me see.

AUSTIN

Hello, hello.  That's Dr. Evil's

cat.

VANESSA

How do you know?

AUSTIN

I never forget a pussy...cat.

VANESSA

Let's go get him!

AUSTIN

He's too well-protected right now.

VANESSA

We can't just sit here, Austin.

AUSTIN

Let me tell you a story.  There's

these two bulls on top of a hill

checking out some foxy cows in the

meadow below.  The young bull says,

'hey, why don't we run down the hill

and shag us a cow?', and the wise

old bull replies, 'no, why don't we

walk down the hill and shag all the

cows?'

VANESSA

I don't get it.

AUSTIN

Well, you know...cows, and shagging.

VANESSA

Unfortunately, while you told that

stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

AUSTIN

No worries, luv.  We'll just give

Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

AUSTIN

My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly

beautiful.  Stay right where you

are.

VANESSA

I hate having my picture taken.

AUSTIN

You're crazy.  The camera loves you,

Vanessa.

AUSTIN

Go, Vanessa, go!

AUSTIN

Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout

for me Vanessa.  Smashing!  Crazy.

Give me some shoulder.

(pause)

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

AUSTIN

Show me love.  Yes!

(beat)

Smashing!

AUSTIN

Great!  Great!  Smashing!

(beat)

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

(beat)

No!  No!

(BEAT)

Going in very close now.

AUSTIN

Give me eyes.

(closer)

Give me cornea.

(closer)

Give me aqueous humour.

(closer)

Coming in closer.  Give me retina,

Vanessa.

(closer)

Even closer.  Give me optic nerve.

(beat)

Love it!

(beat)

And...done.

AUSTIN

I'm spent.  What say you we go out

on the town?

AUSTIN

Fancy a nibble?

VANESSA

I couldn't have another bite.

VANESSA (O.S.)

Watch out, you're on my hair!

AUSTIN (O.S.)

Sorry.  Move your hand to the left.

There you go.  Gorgeous.

VANESSA (O.S.)

Go!  Just go!

AUSTIN (O.S.)

Left hand, blue.

AUSTIN

Wait a tick, I forgot something in

the lobby.

(moving behind the

couch)

I know what.  I'll take the stairs.

AUSTIN

Maybe I'll take the escalator.

AUSTIN

Why take the escalator when I could

take a canoe?

VANESSA

I haven't had fun like that since

college.

AUSTIN

I'm sorry.

VANESSA

Why?

AUSTIN

I'm sorry that bug up your ass had

to die.

VANESSA

Always wanting to have fun, that's

you in a nutshell.

AUSTIN

No, this is me in a nutshell.

AUSTIN

Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind

of nut has such a big nutshell?  How

did I get into this bloody great big

nutshell?

AUSTIN

You're smashed, Vanessa.

VANESSA

I am not.

AUSTIN

Oh, yes you are.

VANESSA

I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm

always the designated driver.

AUSTIN

I can't.  You're drunk.

VANESSA

It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just

beginning to see what my Mum was

talking about.

(pause)

What was my mother like back in the

Sixties?  I'm dying to know.

AUSTIN

(sentimental)

She was very groovy.  She was so in

love with your Dad.  If there was

one

BASIL EXPOSITION

(on the picture phone)

Hello, Austin, this is Basil

Exposition from British Intelligence.

Thank you for confirming the link

between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find

out what part Virtucon plays in

something called Project Vulcan.

I'll need you and Vanessa to get on

that immediately.

AUSTIN

Right away, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Where is Vanessa, by the way?

AUSTIN

She's working on another lead right

now.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Then you'll have to go it alone.

Good luck.

AUSTIN

Thank you, Basil.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Oh, and Austin&emdash;

AUSTIN

(knowing)

Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Let me remind you that because of

the unfreezing process you might

experience flatulence at moments of

extreme relaxation.

AUSTIN

Oh, yes.  Thank you.

BASIL EXPOSITION

There's one more thing, Austin.

AUSTIN

Yes?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Be careful.

AUSTIN

Thank you.

AUSTIN

Paging Dr. Freud.

AUSTIN

(photographing)

Give it to me baby.  Super.

AUSTIN

Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes!

Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

AUSTIN

And I'm spent.

AUSTIN

You seem surprised to see me.

ALOTTA

I thought you'd quit while you were

ahead.

AUSTIN

What, and watch all my earnings go...

(smug)

Down the toilet?

ALOTTA

What do you want, Mr...Cunningham,

was it?

AUSTIN

Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I

call you Alotta...

(pause)

Please?

ALOTTA

You may.

AUSTIN

Your boss, Number Two, I understand

that cat's involved in big underground

drills.

ALOTTA

Virtucon's main interest is in cable

television, but they do have a

subterranean construction division,

yes.  How did you know?

AUSTIN

(smug)

I didn't, baby, you just told me.

ALOTTA

It's for the mining industry, Mr.

Cunningham.  We can talk about

business later.  But first, let me

slip into something more comfortable.

AUSTIN

Behave!

ALOTTA

Come in.

AUSTIN

I'd rather talk about Number Two.

ALOTTA

Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?

Come in, and I'll show you everything

you need to know.

ALOTTA

May I wash you?

AUSTIN

Groovy.

ALOTTA

In Japan, men come first and women

come second.

AUSTIN

Or sometimes not at all.

ALOTTA

Care for some saki?

AUSTIN

Sak-i it to me!

ALOTTA

How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

AUSTIN

Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation.

AUSTIN

(reciting poem)

'Pardon me for being rude, It was

not me, it was my food.

ALOTTA

That's very clever.  Do you know any

other poems?

AUSTIN

(reciting in a lofty

tone)

'Milk, milk, lemonade.

ALOTTA

(genuinely moved)

Thank you, that's beautiful.  To

your health.

AUSTIN

To my health.

ALOTTA

Kiss me.

ALOTTA

Do you mind if I ask you a personal

question?

AUSTIN

Is it about my teeth?

ALOTTA

Yes.

AUSTIN

Damn.  What exactly do you do at

Virtucon?

ALOTTA

I'll tell you all in due time, after

we make love.  But first, tell me

another poem.

AUSTIN

I think it was Wordsworth who penned

this little gem:  'Press the button,

pull the chain, out comes a chocolate

choo-choo train.'

ALOTTA

Oh, you're very clever.  Let's make

love, you silly, hairy little man.

DR. EVIL

Austin Powers is getting too close.

He must be neutralized.  Any

suggestions?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Ya wohl&emdash; I mean, yes wohl,

Herr Doctor.  I have created the

ultimate weapon to defeat Austin

Powers.  Bring on the Fembots!

DR. EVIL

Breathtaking, Frau.  These automated

strumpets are the perfect bait for

the degenerate Powers.

FRAU FARBISSINA

These are the latest word in android

replicant technology.  Lethal,

efficient, brutal.  And no man can

resist their charms.  Send in the

soldiers!

DR. EVIL

Quite impressive.

FRAU FARBISSINA

Thank you, Herr Doctor.

DR. EVIL

I like to see girls of that caliber.

By caliber, I mean both the barrel

size of their guns and the high

quality of their character...Forget

it.

NUMBER TWO

That would be the video feed from

Kreplachistan.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, Phase One is complete.

The warhead is ours.  Let Phase Two

begin!  Patch us through to the United

Nations security secret meeting room.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

DR. EVIL

In a little while, you'll find out

that the Kreplachistani warhead has

gone missing.  Well, it's in safe

hands.  If you want it back, you'll

have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

DR. EVIL

(frustrated)

Sorry.  ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!

UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY

Gentlemen, silence!

(to Dr. Evil)

DR. EVIL

(angry)

Doctor Evil!  I didn't spend six

years in evil medical school to be

called 'mister'.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY

Excuse me.  Dr. Evil, it is the policy

of the United Nations not to negotiate

with terrorists.

DR. EVIL

Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen,

you have five days to come up with

one

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY

You can't destroy the world with a

single warhead.

DR. EVIL

Really?  So long.

DR. EVIL

(to evil associates)

Gentlemen, in exactly five days from

now, we will be one-hundred billion

dollars richer.

(laughing)

Ha-ha-ha-ha.

(slightly louder)

Ha-ha-ha-ha.

EVIL ASSOCIATES

(laughing with him)

Ha-ha-ha-ha.

(PAUSE)

Ohhhh, ahhhhhh...

(pause, quieter)

Ohhh, hmmmm.

(pause, very quiet)

hmn.

DR. EVIL

Okay...Well...I think I'm going to

watch some TV.

EVIL ASSOCIATES

Okay.  Sure.

AUSTIN

Hello, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up

to speed.  Dr. Evil has high-jacked

a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan

and is holding the world ransom for

one-hundred billion dollars.  If the

world doesn't pay up in four days,

he's threatening to destroy the world.

AUSTIN

Thank you, Exposition.  Only two

things, scare me, and one is nuclear

war.

BASIL EXPOSITION

What's the other?

AUSTIN

Excuse me?

BASIL EXPOSITION

What's the other thing you're scared

of?

AUSTIN

Carnies.

BASIL EXPOSITION

What?

AUSTIN

Circus folk.

(shudders)

Nomads, you know.  They smell like

cabbage.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(suffering him)

Indeed...If we could get back to the

business at hand.  It's one thing to

have a warhead, it's quite another

thing to have the missiles to launch

it.

AUSTIN

Maybe these photographs are the last

piece of that puzzle.

(hands him the photos)

I've uncovered the details on Project

Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean

warhead delivery system.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Good God, and underground missile.

We've long feared such a development.

VANESSA

When did you find that out, Austin?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin did some reconnaissance work

at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last

night.

VANESSA

Oh.

BASIL EXPOSITON

Our next move is to infiltrate

Virtucon.  Any ideas?

VANESSA

Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their

facilities every hour.  I suggest we

pose as tourists and do site-level

reconnaissance.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Top drawer, Kensington.  Oh, Austin,

I want you to meet somebody.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, this is my mother, Mrs.

Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge

Wells

BASIL EXPOSITION

My God, Austin, what have you done?

AUSTIN

That's not your mother, that's a

man!

MRS. EXPOSITION

Owww...my hair!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Get away from my mother!

VANESSA

Austin, have you gone mad?

MRS. EXPOSITION

(through pain)

Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?

BASIL EXPOSIION

Don't worry, mother.  Lie down.

Austin, you have a lot of explaining

to do.

AUSTIN

I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was

a man.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Damn it, man!  You're talking about

my mother!

AUSTIN

You must admit, she is rather mannish.

No offense, but if that's a woman,

it looks like she's been beaten with

an ugly stick.

VANESSA

Really, Austin!

AUSTIN

Look at her hands, baby!  Those are

carpenter's hands.

BASIL EXPOSITION

All right, Austin, I think you should

go.

AUSTIN

I think if everyone were honest,

they'd confess that the lady looks

exactly like a man in drag.

BASIL EXPOSITION

I'm leaving!

(pause)

Oh, and Austin?

AUSTIN

Yes, Basil?

BASIL EXPOSITION

Be careful.

AUSTIN

Thanks.

VANESSA

Austin, may I have a word with you?

AUSTIN

Of course, luv.

VANESSA

Listen, I know I'm just being

neurotic, but I can't shake this

suspicious

AUSTIN

Don't be sorry.  You're right to be

suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged

her rotten.

VANESSA

(stunned)

I can't believe you made love to her

just like that.  Did you use

protection?

AUSTIN

Of course, I had my nine-millimeter

automatic.

VANESSA

No, did you use a condom?

AUSTIN

Only sailors use condoms, man.

VANESSA

Not in the Nineties.

AUSTIN

Well they should, filthy beggars,

they go from port to port.  Alotta

meant nothing to me.

VANESSA

(pause)

Well, it means something to me.  If

you want us to have a relationship,

you've got to be a one-woman man.

AUSTIN

It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're

everything to me.

VANESSA

You just don't get it, do you, Austin?

Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties,

you're going to be very lonely.

AUSTIN

Hello, luv.

VANESSA

Thirty years of political and social

upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin

wall, a female Prime Minister of

England, the abolishment of Apartheid,

a fascinating tapestry of human strum

und drang.

AUSTIN

Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was

gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't

see that one coming.

VANESSA

Basil was very concerned to know

where you were last night.

AUSTIN

Out and about, doing odds and sods.

VANESSA

I'll tell him.  By the way, I've

decided we should keep our

relationship strictly professional.

SON 1

(crying)

I love you, Dad.

DAD 1

I love you, Son.

THERAPIST

That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave.

Thank you.  OK, group, we have two

new member.  Say hello to Scott and

his father, Mr....Ehville?

DR. EVIL

Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

GROUP

Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.

SCOTT EVIL

(into it)

Hello, everybody.

THERAPIST

So, Scott, why don't we start with

you.  Why are you here?

SCOTT EVIL

Well, it's kind of weird.

THERAPIST

We don't judge here.

SCOTT EVIL

OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad

for the first time three days ago.

He was partially frozen for thirty

years.  I never knew him growing up.

He comes back and now he wants me to

take over the family business.

THERAPIST

And how do you feel about that?

SCOTT EVIL

I don't wanna take over the family

business.

DR. EVIL

But Scott, who's going to take over

the world when I die?

SCOTT EVIL

Not me.

THERAPIST

What do you want to do, Scott?

SCOTT EVIL

I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe

I'd be a vet or something, cause I

like animals and stuff.

DR. EVIL

An evil vet?

SCOTT EVIL

No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting

zoo or something.

DR. EVIL

An evil petting zoo?

SCOTT EVIL

(shouting)

You always do that!

(calm)

Anyways, this is really hard, because,

you know, my Dad is really evil.

THERAPIST

We don't label people here, Scott.

SCOTT EVIL

No, he's really evil.

THERAPIST

Scott.

DR. EVIL

No, the boy's right.  I really am

evil.

THERAPIST

Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're

here, that's what's important.  A

journey of a thousand miles begins

with one step.

SCOTT EVIL

I just think, like, he hates me.  I

really think he wants to kill me.

THERAPIST

OK, Scott, no one really wants to

"kill" anyone here.  They say it,

but they don't mean it.

DR. EVIL

Actually, the boy's quite astute.  I

am trying to kill him.  My Evil

Associates have cautioned against

it, so here he is, unfortunately,

alive.

THERAPIST

We've heard from Scott, now let's

hear from you.

DR. EVIL

The details of my life are quite

inconsequential.

THERAPIST

That's not true, Doctor.  Please,

tell us about your childhood.

GROUP

Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.

DR. EVIL

Very well, where should I begin?  My

father was a relentlessly self-

improving boulangerie owner from

Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy

and a penchant for buggery.  My mother

was a fifteen-year-old French

prostitute named Chloe with webbed

feet.  My father would womanize, he

would drink, he would make outrageous

claims, like he invented the question

mark.  Sometimes he would accuse

chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of

general malaise that only the genius

possess and the insane lament.  My

childhood was typical.

AUSTIN

Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a

rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you

have a piece of gum?

VANESSA

(in her own world)

Do you think she's prettier than I?

AUSTIN

Who?

VANESSA

You know who.

AUSTIN

No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me,

Vanessa.  You're being very trippy.

VANESSA

I'm looking at you, and the whole

time I can't help thinking you had

your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

AUSTTIN

Well put.  Listen love, we can't

keep having this fight.  I'm an

International Man of Mystery.

Sometimes in the course of my work

to save the world I have to shag

some crumpet.  It's all part of the

job.

TOUR GUIDE

Welcome to Virtucon, the company of

the future.

(pointing to large

display window)

Virtucon is a leading manufacturer

of many items you'll find right in

your own home.  We make steel,

volatile chemicals, petroleum-based

products, and we also own the Franklin

mint, which makes decorative hand-

painted theme plates for collectors.

(holds up plate)

Some plates, like the Gone With The

Wind series, have gone up in value

as much as two-hundred and forty

percent, but, as with any investment,

there is some risk involved.

TOUR GUIDE

Coming up on the left, we have the

Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide

range of Virtucon licensed products.

On the right, you'll notice a door

that leads to a restricted area.

Only authorized personnel are allowed

beyond that point.

AUSTIN

I'll take him, you take her.

VANESSA

Austin, we don't look anything like

our photo badges.

AUSTIN

Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a

mind control technique during my

travels to India.  I learned it from

my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a

chaste man who mysteriously died of

a disease that had all the hallmarks

of syphilis.

GUARD

Hi, folks.  You're entering a

restricted zone.  Can I see your

security badges?

AUSTIN

Sure.

AUSTIN

(hypnotist-like)

Everything seems to be in order.

GUARD

(looking at the badges)

Hey, wait a minute&emdash;

GUARD

(trance-like, in

Austin's English

accent)

Everything seems to be in order.

VANESSA

That's amazing.  Let's go!

AUSTIN

Hold on one second.

AUSTIN

Here, have a piece of gum.

GUARD

(in trace)

Here, have a piece of gum.

AUSTIN

Don't mind if I do.

GUARD

(slipping out of trance)

Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last

piece of gum.

AUSTIN

No, no, I want you to have it, even

if it's my last piece.

GUARD

(trance-like)

No, no, I want you to have it, even

if it's my last piece.

AUSTIN

(mind-controlling)

I'm going to go across the street

and get you some sherbert.

VANESSA

(irritated)

Austin, we have to go!

GUARD (O.S.)

(faintly)

I'm going to go across the street

and get you some sherbert.

SCIENTIST

This is the strongest, sharpest drill

bit ever produced by man.  It weighs

fifteen metric tones and can bore

through a mile-thick bedrock of solid

granite in seven seconds.

ANNOUNCER

(on PA)

Attention, there are intruders in

the complex.

SCIENTIST

Get them!

AUSTIN

Judo chop!  Judo chop!

AUSTIN

Our only way out of here is to drive

out!

P.A. (O.S.)

There they are!

AUSTIN

Hang on!  I'm going to floor it!

GUARD

Noooooooooooooo!

AUSTIN

Where did you learn to shoot?

VANESSA

Where did you learn to drive?

GUARD

Noooooooooooooo!

VANESSA

Austin, watch out!

AUSTIN

(looking around)

Where?  Where?

GUARD

Noooooooooooooo!

VANESSA

Thank God, Austin, we made it.

AUSTIN

Yes, act naturally and we'll split

this scene the way we came in,

Vanessa.

MIDDLE AGED LADY

Hello?

(pause)

Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.

(pause)

Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.

(pause)

Yes, that's right, he's a henchman

in Dr. Evil's Private Army.

(pause)

What?  Killed?

(pause)

How?

(pause)

Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my

God.  Thank you for calling.

FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD

Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home?

He said he was going to teach me to

play ball.

MRS. HARWIN

Sit down, Billy, I have some bad

news.  As you know, your brother

Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's

Private Army.

BILLY

Was?  What is it, Mom?

MRS. HARWIN

Your brother was run over by a

steamroller.

BILLY

A steamroller?

(bursting into tears)

No, not Steve!  Since Dad died,

Steve's been like a father to me.

MRS. HARWIN

I'm sorry son.  People never think

how things affect the family of the

henchman.

(hugging him)

I love you, Billy.

(to herself, out loud)

I wonder if we'll be able to receive

Steve's henchman's comp.

DR. EVIL

Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

DR. EVIL

Welcome to my underground lair, Mr.

Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter,

how lovely.  I believe your name is

Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except

for obvious reasons.

VANESSA

I don't understand.

DR. EVIL

My hand, dammit!  Look at it!

AUSTIN

What's wrong with your hand?

DR. EVIL

Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a

little late for that.  I'm a freak!

AUSTIN

I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking

your head space.

DR. EVIL

Oh forget it.  As a fellow player on

the international stage, Mr. Powers,

I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the

curtain fall on the third and final

act.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.

AUSTIN

(under his breath to

Vanessa)

Does that make you horny?

VANESSA

(under her breath)

Not now, Austin.

DR. EVIL

The world's most powerful subterranean

drill.

DR. EVIL

(voice over)

So powerful it can penetrate the

Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton

nuclear warhead into the planet's

hot liquid core.  Upon detonation,

every volcano on the planet will

erupt.

AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE

Why should we pay him the money?

He's only got one warhead and he's

going to detonate it deep underground.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(the light shifts

towards dramatic as

he speaks)

My God, man, don't you understand?

It won't just be active volcanoes,

inactive ones will erupt as well.

Seven-eighths of the Earth's land

mass will be deluged with hot magma.

Tectonic plates will shift, causing

massive earthquakes.  Imagine no

United Kingdom.  Think of it, no

cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted

crumpets smothered with Devonshire

clotted cream, the diving mystery of

Stonehenge.  Imagine severing forever

the continuity of Britannic majesty,

the demise of this sceptered isle,

this jewel, this England...

BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE

Any word from Powers?

BASIL EXPOSITION

(back to normal)

I'm afraid we've lost contact with

him.

BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE

I see.

UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY

Dr. Evil, it seems we have no choice

but to pay your ransom.

DR. EVIL

Gentlemen, your deadline is in three

hours.  You have your instructions.

DR. EVIL

Come join us for dinner, won't you

Mr. Powers?

DR. EVIL

I think you'll enjoy the food.  I

have the best chef in the world.

His name is Ezekial.  He's made of

seventy-five percent plastic.

DR. EVIL

Scott my boy, come here.  How was

your day?

SCOTT EVIL

Well, me and a buddy went to the

video arcade in town and, like, they

don't speak English right, and so my

buddy gets into a fight, and he goes

'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't

speak French or whatever', and the

other guy goes something in Paris

talk, and I go 'um, just back off'

and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make

me'.

DR. EVIL

(trying to hide

contempt)

Fascinating.  What are your plans

for this evening?

SCOTT EVIL

Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good

tittie movie on Skinemax.

DR. EVIL

And that's how you want to live your

life, is it?

SCOTT EVIL

Yeah.  What?

DR. EVIL

Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's

nemesis, Austin Powers.

SCOTT EVIL

Why are you feeding him?  Why don't

you just kill him?

DR. EVIL

In due time.

SCOTT EVIL

But what if he escapes?  Why don't

you just shoot him?  What are you

waiting for?

DR. EVIL

I have a better idea.  I'm going to

put him in an easily-escapable

situation involving an overly-

elaborate and exotic death.

SCOTT EVIL

Why don't you just shoot him now?

Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just

shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done.

DR. EVIL

One more peep out of you and you're

grounded.  Let's begin.

DR. EVIL

Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of

mine are joining us for dinner.

AUSTIN

Dr. Evil, do you really expect them

to pay?

DR. EVIL

No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to

die.  Even after they pay me the

money, I'm still going to melt all

the cities of the world with hot

magma.

(to guard)

All right, guard, begin the

unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping

Mechanism.

DR. EVIL

Release the sharks!

(to the room)

All the sharks have had laser beams

attached to their heads.  I figure

every creature deserves a warm meal.

FRAU FARBISSINA

(clearing her throat

nervously)

Dr. Evil?

DR. EVIL

Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting

my moment of triumph.

FRAU FARBISSINA

It's about the sharks.  Since you

were frozen, they've been placed on

the Endangered Species List.  We

tried to get some, but it will take

months to clear up the red tape.

DR. EVIL

(disappointed)

Right.

(to Austin)

Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you

in a tank of piranhas with laser

beams attached to their heads.

DR. EVIL

What is it now?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Well, we experimented with lasers,

but you would be surprised at how

heavy they are.  They actually

outweighed the piranha themselves,

and the fish, well, they sank to the

bottom and died.

DR. EVIL

I have one simple request&emdash;

sharks with friggin' laser beams

attached to their heads, and it can't

be done?  Remind me again why I pay

you people?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Sea bass.

DR. EVIL

Right.

FRAU FARBISSINA

They're mutated sea bass.

DR. EVIL

Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

FRAU FARBISSINA

Please allow me to demonstrate.

DR. EVIL

Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-

tempered sea bass it is.

(to the room)

Come, let's return to dinner.  Close

the tank.

SCOTT EVIL

Aren't you going to watch them?

They'll get away!

DR. EVIL

No, we'll leave them alone and not

actually witness them dying, and

we'll just assume it all went to

plan.

SCOTT EVIL

I have a gun in my room.  Give me

five seconds, I'll come back and

blow their brains out.

DR. EVIL

No Scott.  You just don't get it, do

you?

VANESSA

What's your plan?

AUSTIN

First, I plan to soil myself.  Then,

I plan to regroup and think about

the next move.  Any thoughts?

VANESSA

Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep

this on me just in case.

AUSTIN

All right, I get it.  I have bad

teeth.  You have to understand, in

Britain in the Sixties you could be

a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.

It didn't matter.

VANESSA

No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to

get to the ledge.

AUSTIN

Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

AUSTIN

Judo chop!

GUARD

(screaming, rubbing

his eyes)

My eyes!  My eyes!

AUSTIN

Hold on, Vanessa!

VANESSA

(shouting)

Austin, watch out!

AUSTIN

Not a good time to lose one's head.

VANESSA

Indeed.

AUSTIN

That's not the way to get ahead in

life.

VANESSA

Yes.

AUSTIN

It's a shame he wasn't more

headstrong.

VANESSA

Shut up.

AUSTIN

Fair enough.

GUY 1

I can't believe John Smith is getting

married tomorrow.

GUY 2

Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not

like him to be late for anything,

especially his own stag party.

GUY 3

Well, you know he's a henchman for

Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.

Can I just say something that may

sound a little sappy?  I think it's

a testament to our friend John that

so many of his buddies showed up in

his honor.  There's a lot of love in

this room.

WAITRESS

Hi, I have a phone call here for the

John Smith party.

GUY 1

Hello?

(pause)

Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.

(pause)

That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's

private army.

(pause)

What?  He's dead?

(pause)

Decapitated by mutated flying sea

bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

GUY 2

(to Guy 1)

Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that

John?  Is he coming late?

GUY 1

Guys, John's not coming.

GUY 2

Why?

GUY 1

He was decapitated by mutated flying

sea bass.

GUYS

(upset)

Oh no, oh my God, etc.

GUY 1

All right, to Smittie!

GUYS

To Smittie!

VANESSA

What do we do now?

AUSTIN

We've got a freaked out square and

world annihilation is his bag.  You

go get help.  I'm gonna stay here

and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.

VANESSA

I'm not going anywhere.  We're a

team.

AUSTIN

Too right, youth.  That's why I need

you to lead the troops.

VANESSA

I'll hurry back.

AUSTIN

Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I

just want you to know that I feel

bad about shagging that Italian girl.

I had a sip of sake and all of the

sudden, I don't know what happened.

The whole time I was shagging

her&emdash; I mean really shagging

her, I mean it was crazy, I was like

a huge mechanical piston, in and

out, IN and OUT!&emdash;

VANESSA

(cutting him off)

Austin, what's your point?

AUSTIN

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is

that if you want me to be a one-woman

man, well, that's just groovy,

because...I love you.

VANESSA

Oh, behave!

DR. EVIL

Come, everyone, let us repair to the

main chamber.  Project Vulcan is

about to begin.  Scott, are you

coming?

SCOTT EVIL

I don't want to.

DR. EVIL

Don't you want to see what Daddy

does for a living?

SCOTT EVIL

(under his breath)

Blow me.

DR. EVIL

What did you say?

SCOTT EVIL

Show me.

AUSTIN

Hello, hello.

FEMBOT

Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a

little fun?

AUSTIN

(looking at his watch)

No, actually, I have to save the

world.

AUSTIN

Is it cold in here?

DR. EVIL

Arm the probe!

AUSTIN

(delirious)

I've got to get Dr. Evil!

(eyes closed, fingers

in his ears)

Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold

day!  Margaret Thatcher naked on a

cold day!  Margaret Thatcher naked

on a cold day!

DR. EVIL

Probe in place.

DR. EVIL

Five minutes to go.  Let the

penetration countdown begin.

EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN

(on PA, very slowly,

with very thick accent)

Five minutes and COUN-ting.

FEMBOT

You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

Eventually you'll give in.

AUSTIN

Au contraire, I think you can't resist

me.

AUSITN

Oh, I fell over.

AUSTIN

It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.

(to the commandos)

At ease, boys.

VANESSA

(glancing down)

Likewise.

AUSTIN

I can explain.  They attacked me.

Gas came out of her...well, and then

they...and I...

VANESSA

I believe you, Austin.  Let's go.

AUSTIN

Hold on a tick, let me put on my

togs.

DR. EVIL

Activate the blast shutters!

DR. EVIL

Launch the subterranean probe!

EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN

We have penetration.  Subterranean

detonation&emdash; two minutes and

COUN-ting.

SFX:  CLICKA-CLICKA

Austin and Vanessa run along the

catwalk towards the control room.

They're directly in the path of TEN

CHARGING PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS.

AUSTIN

Follow me!  We're going to have to

jump over the rail!

VANESSA

Are you crazy?

AUSTIN

Don't worry!

AUSTIN

Blast!  Out of ammo.

VANESSA

Austin, I'm coming with you.

AUSTIN

I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa.

I have a follow-up visit with the

Evil Doctor.

VANESSA

I'll secure the perimeter.

DR. EVIL (O.S.)

Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the

Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed

to prevent you from progressing beyond

this point.  You might as well

surrender.  Resistance is futile.

Your odds of survival are 23,763,273

to

AUSTIN

Well, Destructacon 5000, you have

quite a head on your shoulders, I

dare to coin.

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

Yes, I am programmed to answer any

question.

AUSTIN

Really?  Let me ask you this.  What

is love?

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

That does not compute.

AUSTIN

Why not?  It's a question.

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

Love is...love is...love is...

DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

Remjack!  Remjack!

(singing)

Daisy, Daisy...

(faster)

Remjackremjackremjack!

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

(on PA)

Subterranean detonation&emdash; one

minute and COUN-ting.

AUSTIN

(to Eastern European

Man)

Where's the abort button?

EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN

(on PA)

Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting.

(to Austin)

It's right over there.

AUSTIN

Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to

have a lump there, you idiot!  Who

throws a shoe?  You fight like a

woman.

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

(on PA)

Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

AUSTIN

Care for a drink?

AUSTIN

Shocking.

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

Three...two...one...

AUSTIN

(slow motion distortion)

Nooooooo!

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

(on PA)

Abort.

AUSTIN

I've got you, Dr. Evil!

DR. EVIL

Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so

different, you and I.  It's true,

you're British, and I'm Belgian.

You have a full head of hair, mine

is slightly receding.  You're thin,

I'm about forty pounds overweight.

OK, we are different, I'm not making

a very good point.  However, isn't

it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very

things you stand for&emdash; swinging,

free love, parties, distrust of

authority- are all now, in the

Nineties, considered to

AUSTIN

No, man, what we swingers were

rebelling against were uptight squares

like you, whose bag was money and

world domination.  We were innocent,

man.  If we'd known the consequences

of our sexual liberation, we would

have done things differently, but

the spirit would have remained the

same.  It's freedom, man.

DR. EVIL

Your freedom has cause more pain and

suffering in the world than any plan

I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom

failed.

AUSTIN

That's why right now is a very groovy

time, man.  We still have freedom,

but we also have responsibility.

DR. EVIL

Really, there's nothing more pathetic

than an aging hipster.

ALOTTA

Not so fast.

DR. EVIL

Well, it seems the tables have turned,

Mr. Powers.

SCOTT EVIL

Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

AUSTIN

It seems the tables have turned again,

Dr. Evil.

DR. EVIL

Not really.  Kill the little bastard.

See what I care.

AUSTIN

Man, you are one chilly square!

SCOTT EVIL

Dad, we just made a breakthrough in

group!

DR. EVIL

I had the group liquidated, you little

shit.  They were insolent.

SCOTT EVIL

I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I

was never artificially created in a

lab.

DR. EVIL

Scott, don't say that...

VANESSA

This is for sleeping with my man,

you whore!

ALOTTA

I didn't sleep with him.

VANESSA

I don't believe you.

ALOTTA

(choking)

It's the teeth.

VANESSA

OK, I believe you.  But you still

must be chopped.

VANESSA

Judo chop!

EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)

(on PA)

Five minutes to self-destruct and

COUN-ting.

AUSTIN

Let's split!

VANESSA

I have something to tell you.

AUSTIN

Lay it on me.

VANESSA

I love you, Austin.

AUSTIN

That's fab, because I love you, too,

Vanessa.

VANESSA

Kiss me.

AUSTIN

Behave!

AUSTIN

Just when things were getting

interesting.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr.

Evil from destroying the world with

his subterranean nuclear probe, and

somehow you and Agent Kensington

managed to escape unscathed from his

evil lair.

AUSTIN

I'd say that about sums it up,

Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Not quite, actually.  Vanessa, I

have something for you.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Because of your exemplary service to

Her Majesty, you are now officially

an active Field Agent with all the

privileges and responsibilities

thereof.

VANESSA

Thank you, Exposition.  I'm honored.

AUSTIN

Congratulations, Field Agent

Kensington!

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, I have something for you as

well.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Here's the number of my dentist,

he's first rate.  Ring him up, he'll

look after you.

AUSTIN

Thanks, Basil.  Maybe the Nineties

aren't so bad after all.

VANESSA

Oh, Austin.

BASIL EXPOSITION

Austin, now, about your next

mission&emdash; Still kissing Vanessa,

Austin motions with his thumbs to

the pilot of the helicopter to lift

Basil up.  He rises away in mid-

sentence.

BASIL EXPOSITION

(rising up)

But, wait, I&emdash; you got me again.

Oh, and Austin&emdash;

AUSTIN

(calling out)

Yes Basil?

BASIL EXPOSITION

(rising)

Be careful!

DR. EVIL (V.O.)

I'll get you yet, Austin Powers!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Now you can get all the Austin Powers

movies in one Laser Disk box set!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Relive all your favorite Austin Powers

movies, including...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Middle Name:  Danger.

AUSTIN

So, Dr. Evil, do you expect the world

to pay the ransom?

DR. EVIL

No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to

die.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

No Austin Powers collection would be

complete without some of the later

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Four Eyes Only.

ROGER MOORE

Oh, behave!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

We've also included some of the more

obscure hits, like...

INDIAN AUSITN

Well, my good fellow, are you

expecting me to pay the ransom to

you, you despot?

INDIAN DR. EVIL

(Indian accent)

No kind sir, I expect you to go up

in the evolutionary chain.  But first,

I expect you to sing.

INDIAN AUSTIN

'IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE, LET'S

BAKE A CAKE.'

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

All the Austin Powers adventures in

Behave!
