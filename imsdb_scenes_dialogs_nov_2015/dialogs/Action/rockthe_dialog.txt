THE ROCK

BY

Jonathan Hensleigh

BENNIE

You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow,

holidays nothin, keeps him Away.

HUMMEL

Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's

depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to

do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have

approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything

and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it

feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking.

ARMY M. P.

General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel

expecting you, sir?

HUMMEL

Held better be.  This is a security inspection.

ARMY M. P.

Yes, sir!

COLONEL CALLAHAN

General Hummel!  This is a surprise!

HUMMEL

That's the idea, Colonel.

SGT.  CRISP

This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and

infiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my

prisoners, sir.

SGT.  CRISP

Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.

HUMMEL

(to Callahan)

Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there

doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here

you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a

tight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.

ISHERWOOD

(V.O.)

Son of a bitch...

GOODSPEED

(V.O.)

You owe me five dollars, Marvin.

ISHERWOOD

(yawns)

I was told this was exciting work.

GOODSPEED

Patience, Marvin.  It has its moments.

DR. LONNER

C'mere, Billy.

(points inside gas chamber)

A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian

refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas.

ISHERWOOD

Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it.

GOODSPEED

Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians

don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out

your hand.

ISHERWOOD

I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it-

GOODSPEED

Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.

DR. LING

(into mike)

We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed.

GOODSPEED

(into helmet mike)

July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william

Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a

wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.

GOODSPEED

Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts

out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.

ISHERWOOD

This is thrilling.

GOODSPEED

Careful, goddamn it Marvin!

ISHERWOOD

What's hap...  what's happening....?

DR. LING

Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're

okay.

GOODSPEED

I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news

is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.

DR. LING

What's the really bad news.

GOODSPEED

Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas

to kill everybody in the building.

ISHERWOOD

The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit...

GOODSPEED

Chill, Marvin.

(yells outside)

WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?

DR. LONNER

Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name

are they gonna give us a new building ...

DR. LING

Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.

DR. LING

You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it.

(Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device)

Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.

GOODSPEED

Get that away from me.

(to himself)

I hate needles.

DR. LING

INJECT YOURSELF!

GOODSPEED

LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?

DR. LONNER

It's coming, it's coming ...

DR.  LING

(sweating it out)

Ten seconds, Bill.

ISHERWOOD

Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY

IT'S REAL.

DR. LING

Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...

DR. LING

Three, two...  the gas is clear!

DR. LING

Next time use the atropine!

GOODSPEED

I don't like needles.

CARLA

Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing

about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed)

Wanna keep you locked up at home ...

CARLA

(New Jersey accent)

Hey there.

GOODSPEED

Hey honey.

CARLA

Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it?

GOODSPEED

Not now.

CARLA

Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.

GOODSPEED

Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.

CARLA

Better?

GOODSPEED

Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.

CARLA

What happened baby.  Tell me.

GOODSPEED

Had a close one.

CARLA

You want to talk about it?

GOODSPEED

Not really.

CARLA

You know how I feel about what you do.

GOODSPEED

Could we change the subject?

CARLA

That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.

GOODSPEED

Hey!  Now there's some good news.

CARLA

You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?

GOODSPEED

Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed

for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.

(smiles)

I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout

Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?

GOODSPEED

Stick with Carla.

CARLA

Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?

(GOODSPEED frowns)

Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.

GOODSPEED

We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down,

inside and out ...

CARLA

Billy, this probably isn't the best time ...

Bill, I'm uhhh.

CARLA

I'm pregnant.

GOODSPEED

You're what ... ?

PARK RANGER JOE

Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the

most feared, prison ever built.  Here the inmates were allowed one hour

of daily exercise.

FEMALE TOURIST

Is it really true no one escaped?

PARK RANGER JOE

True, madam.  From 1936 until the prison's closing in

1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made

it to shore - alive at least.

PARK RANGER JOE

Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman

of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.

PARK RANGER JOE

Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service

cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of

course.

ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER

You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys.  Is

there a problem?

SGT.  CRISP

Big problem.

PARK RANGER JOE

Don't want to be locked up, fellahs?

HUMMEL

Not today.  You go ahead.

PARK RANGER JOE

I don't think so hah hah.

HUMMEL

I think so.

TOURISTS

Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going

on... ?

CAPTAIN FRYE

General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.

HUMMEL

Deploy as planned, Captain.

(unison)

Aye, aye, sir.

CUT TO:

HUMMEL

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen.  You are my prisoners.  I have no intention

of harming you.  You will be fed regularly.  That is all you need to

know for now.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Can it wait till morning, Agent Wood, I'm going

to hear Bruce Springsteen ...

AGENT WOOD

(re: Womack's tux)

In that?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Christ, the concert's for the Prince of Wales or

somebody ...

AGENT WOOD

I really think you should take this call personally.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

First:	I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on

Alcatraz Island.  Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the

media or there will not be eighty.  Second: fifteen guided rockets armed

with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San

Francisco.  I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Wait.  Who is this?

HUMMEL

Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Mary Jane, get the Pentagon! (to Agent Wood) Call

the San Francisco office.  It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.

HUMMEL

At ease, Gentlemen.  It is traditional for me to meet with my

officers before an operation.  The heart performs one thing, the legs

another, the brain another - all better function together or the body

becomes ill, is prone to disease. (beat) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I

have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my

adjutant in the Gulf.  Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a

beatnik.

(the crew-cutted HENDRIX smiles Captain Frye, Captain Darrow.)

You and your men are new to me.

CAPTAIN FRYE

Would the General like a recitation of our service records?

HUMMEL

I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are

excellent.  I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here.  You

both stand to profit from this.

CAPTAIN FRYE

Profit is not my motive, sir.  I am here to redress a

wrong.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.

HUMMEL

This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain

Darrow: They are called courts of law.  In the military, they are called

Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They

are called schools.  Am I confusing you?

CAPTAIN DARROW

Well, sir, frankly ...

EL I see that I am '

(beat)

HUMMEL

The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason.

Plain and simple.  An insurrection against a government to which we have

sworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that.

HUMMEL

The question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion?

Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to

myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.  Have all of you?

HUMMELS' OFFICERS

Yes, sir.

HUMMEL

Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not

return.  All of you can live with that?

OTHER OFFICERS

(unison)

Yes, sir.

HUMMEL

Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in

the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.

CAPTAIN HENDRIX

But General, you'll be prosecuted.

HUMMEL

Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will

make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take

your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi.

GENERAL KRAMER

Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of

a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't

discovered until the shift change this morning.

GENERAL KRAMER

Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm.

Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal

of...  Jesus.

(looks up)

The man is a hero.

GENERAL KRAMER

A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C.

single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname

"gunfighter."

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam?

Anybody read it?

RAYDEN SINCLAIR

No.  Give me the skinny.

GENERAL KRAMER

The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have

either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting

American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view.

NAVAL ATTACHE

General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the

table.

GENERAL KRAMER

Frank, this is Albert Kramer.

HUMMEL

Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids?

GENERAL KRAMER

They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I.

Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom,

and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank.

Can you help us out?

HUMMEL

I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three

Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.

Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into

China.

HUMMEL

Who is that.  Identify yourself.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.

HUMMEL

How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.

RAYDEN SINCLAIR

I'm thirty-three.

HUMMEL

Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday

I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed

that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,

ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.

NAVAL ATTACHE

The President calling from Moscow.

GENERAL KRAMER

Continue Frank.

HUMMEL

Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and

El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures

on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside

Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,

gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals

conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given

a coddamn military burial.

(beat)

This situation will not stand: you

will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading

Company" account to an account I designate.  From these funds,

reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83

marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's

expenses.  Am I clear?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is

that?

HUMMEL

Identify yourself.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

F.B.I. Director Womack, General.

HUMMEL

You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the

Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

GENERAL KRAMER

Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.

WOMACK

(stunned)

Is this true?

HUMMEL

If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney

General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

General, I've just spoken to the President and he is

clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care

if ...

HUMMEL

Someone please gag that man.

(beat)

Alert the media, I launch the gas.  Refuse payment, I launch the gas.

It is just after midnight.  You have 36 hours - all of today and half

of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money.  Don't even consider

the standard counter measure, General.

GENERAL KRAMER

What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket

armed with V.X., General Peterson?

GENERAL PETERSON

In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...

RAYDEN SINCLAIR

Well that's not so bad ...

I GENERAL PETERSON

Thousand.  Seventy thousand.  Dead. one teaspoon will

kill all living organisms in a three story office building.  Get the

point?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?

GENERAL PETERSON

Napalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.

It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is

that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm.

Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.

GENERAL KRAMER

'Course he does.

(explaining to others)

"Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still

in its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X.

(dawning on him)

That explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not

operational.  What would it take, General?

GENERAL PETERSON

To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36

hours?  An act of God.

(off Kramer's look)

All right, we can try.  But

view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.

GENERAL KRAMER

Then on to our primary initiative. (hits intercom button)

Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your

best chemical biological man?

AGENT WOOD

(rises)

I'll find out.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.

CARLA

Don't stop...  do no stop.

GOODSPEED

Shit, shit, shit what time is it.

(fumbles for phone)

Hello.

(pause)

I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.

GOODSPEED

I've got to go to San Francisco.

CARLA

No. I'm sorry, but NO.  I need you here with me.  We need to talk

about this...

GOODSPEED

I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I

cannot deal with this right now ... (softly) Bill, I am very Catholic.

And very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.

GOODSPEED

I love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this,

that's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.

CARLA

Really?

(smiles)

Really?

GOODSPEED

It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel,

order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...

CARLA

... We'll finish what we started.  Baby, are you sexy in those

boots ...

COMMANDER ANDERSON

A precision night drop is out due to the full moon.

Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might

launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the

prison.

(beat)

The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison,

undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind -

take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better

intelligence.

GENERAL KRAMER

You've studied the architectural plans.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War

fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze

of shit, excuse my language.

(beat)

What I need is personal, firsthand

intelligence on the island's tunnels.

GENERAL KRAMER

The former warden?

AGENT WOOD

Died in 1979.  The guards we contacted are useless.  There

was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he

died in 1983.

GENERAL PETERSON

Didn't three guys escape?  I thought I saw a movie about it.

AGENT WOOD

It's a Hollywood myth.  No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

There is someone who can help us.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

The C.I.A. Director and I have something to

discuss in private.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

You're not actually suggesting ...

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

The man spent every night for six months making a

dry-run of his escape.  He knows every inch of that island.  We have to,

Jim.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I am very uncomfortable about this.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(O.S.)

I knew, I knew someday, this would come

back to bite us.

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly.

When was the last time you saw him?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

when he escaped from San Quentin.

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

Can we risk letting.him out?

C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY

The question is: can we not?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed.

What's your education?

GOODSPEED

B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry

and toxicology.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Excellent.  What do you know about V.X. gas?

GOODSPEED

This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

No Goodspeed.  It's not a training exercise.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

The following is a state secret.  Disclose it to

any party and you will be subject to prosecution.  His name is John

Mason.  A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962,

escaped in 1963.

AGENT SANCHEZ

Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez.  Do not

argue and do not question.  He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin,

from which he escaped in February, 1976.  He's been held at Wolfburg

since.  He has no identity.  He does not exist.  Understood?

(turns to Sanchez)

I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the

route he took through the island's tunnels.

AGENT SANCHEZ

You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Don't even entertain it.  This man laughs at

strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.

GOODSPEED

Why's he going to help us now?

U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS

(hands Womack PARDON)

Mason's papers are in order, sir.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.

AGENT SANCHEZ

Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I

don't need that to get what you want.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Sanchez - try subtlety.

AGENT SANCHEZ

It's my middle name.

(to Goodspeed)

Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(grumbles)

I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...

GOODSPEED

(to himself)

Jesus look at this guy.

SANCHEZ

I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.

MASON

In charge of what?  Fucking me over for another three decades?

SANCHEZ

(congenial)

Hey.  Easy.  I just want to talk.

MASON

You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez?  Fucking Bloody Idiots.

I don't want to talk to you.

SANCHEZ

Just some questions about Alcatraz.  It's a tourist attraction

now.  You remember Alcatraz, Mason.

MASON

Do I remember Alcatraz.

SANCHEZ

Not the island itself.  The tunnels underneath it.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Real subtle, SANCHEZ...

SANCHEZ

There's no harm in cooperating with us.

MASON

Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?

SANCHEZ

Maybe there's a gift in it for you.

MASON

(to the mirror)

Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.

GOODSPEED

"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

MASON

Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?

SANCHEZ

I don't have time for this shit...

(pause; stares at mason)

Yes. I can read.

MASON

The story of Alchimadus.  Know it?

SANCHEZ

No.

GOODSPEED

(to himself)

Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his

king.

MASON

Thomas a Beckett.  Heard of him?

SANCHEZ

Maybe.  Not really.

GOODSPEED

(to himself)

Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and

executed by Henry the Second ...

MASON

Solzhenitsyn.  I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him.

GOODSPEED

(to himself)

Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.

SANCHEZ

Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here.

(beat)

You can trust the F.B.I.

MASON

That's a good one, Sanchez.  What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who

can't tell a lie?  A mute.

U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS

(V.O.)

Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word

with you?

SANCHEZ

Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Impressive, Sanchez.

GOODSPEED

You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?

SANCHEZ

He'll eat him alive.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

He's already had you for the first course.

(hands GOODSPEED the pardon)

Go.

GOODSPEED

Take his cuffs off.

MASON

Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?

GOODSPEED

No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed.

(rallys)

Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release

contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man,

provided you cooperate.

MASON

What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

(lying)

I'm a field agent.

MASON

Tell me what you really do.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....

GOODSPEED

I'm a chemical biological weapons expert.

MASON

You said I'd be a free man.  Define free

GOODSPEED

Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.

MASON

I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context.

GOODSPEED

I don't understand....

MASON

During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?

GOODSPEED

Well yes I suppose ...

MASON

You suppose?

GOODSPEED

Yes.  You'll be outside.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.

MASON

What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?

GOODSPEED

A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.

MASON

(looks at mirror)

Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in

the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new

suit of clothes.

GOODSPEED

I think we can arrange that.

SANCHEZ

Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?

U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS

I'll have this forwarded to the President,

Director.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

No. You'll give it to me.

(pause)

Give it to me, Reynolds.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(to Sanchez)

Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him.  And SANCHEZ -

I'll handle the next stage.

GOODSPEED

Sir, that's a legal document.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

GOODSPEED

They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going

on, sir?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

You're out of your depth, Goodspeed.  You are on

a need to know basis and you do not need to know.

MASON

one more thing: a shave and a haircut.

(sees Womack)

Hello Womack.

CPT.  GILER

What it's all about, sir: Willy Peter burns steel, burns

titanium; it'll sure burn up your poison and everything else in the

atmosphere.

GENERAL PETERSON

I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles

within...

(consults wristwatch)

.... twenty-six hours.

LT. FISK

Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with

all due respect: winning the Lottery, climbing Mt. Everest barefoot,

getting a parking space at Yankee Stadium, marrying Sharon Stone ...

CPT.  GILER

Can't do it, General.

GENERAL PETERSON

You can.  And you will.

CPT.  GILER

Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball, and broads, fellahs -

we're goin, ,round the clock!

CARLA

(V.O.)

(recorded voice message)

Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in!

State your business!  Make it interesting!

GOODSPEED

(into phone)

Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come

to San Francisco.

GOODSPEED

(V.O.)

(on the machine)

I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.

CARLA

Like hell I'm not...

MASON

(sotto)

Who's Carla?  And why don't you want her to come to San

Francisco?

GOODSPEED

You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.

MASON

You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I personally picked this suite.

(points at elevator)

Only one exit.

MARSHAL CORD

Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes.

MASON

You going to stand there and watch?

MARSHAL CORD

That's right.

MASON

well if it excites-you ...

MARSHAL CORD

Put the goddamn clothes on.

BARBER

I can't do a decent job with these.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

That's all you get.

BARBER

I'm an artist, not a barber.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(holds up scissors)

without these he can't stab you in the throat.

MASON

Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine?

BARBER

How would you like it sir?

MASON

whatever's in style.

BARBER

oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the

shabbiness away?

MASON

Good.  Thank-you.

MASON

Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.-

(to Agent Star)

See to the good man will you?

MASON

What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.

MASON

In your head.

GOODSPEED

Jesus...  JESUS CHRIST....

MASON

- Drop the gun or I'll drop your boss.

F.B.I. AGENT

Holy shit, we got a jumper.

F.B.I. AGENT 2

Looks like....  Womack... !

MASON

Whoops .... I'm feeling tired .... Whoops .... MASON

lets Womack drop a foot. Womack SCREAMS! GOODSPEED

drops his gun and grabs the clothesline.  MASON

bolts from the balcony into the suitels library.

GOODSPEED

All units, this is Caretaker.  WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX.

Mason's in the elevator!  Let me know where he stops!

GOODSPEED

GOODSPEED

That's him!

RADIO NEWSMAN

This just in: More than twenty highway patrolmen are

involved in a highspeed chase on Van Ness Boulevard, north of Trocadero

...

MASON

Modern conveniences.  Cheers. (punches numbers) San Francisco.

Jade Angelou.  That's A..n..g..e..l ....

JADE ANGELOU

(O.S.)

Hello?

MASON

Is this Jade Angelou?

JADE ANGELOU

(O.S.)

Yes.  Who is this?

MASON

John Mason.

(lengthy pause)

Don't be shocked.  I don't have much

time.  Please listen carefully  ....

GOODSPEED

Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?

HE'S ON THE PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.

Gotta go.

A beat, then --

GOODSPEED

Shit shit SHIT SHIT ...

GOODSPEED

It's not mine.

MOTORCYCLE KID

Way cool.

(smiles)

GOODSPEED

Neither is this.

ISHERWOOD

Chem weapons.  Isherwood.

GOODSPEED

(V.O.)

Marvin, ring up Wolfburg Federal Pen.  The inmate is

Mason, John.

ISHERWOOD

Wolfburg, got it. Masconi, Magrane, Masters.  No MASON

in Wolfburg, Bill, is this arelative of yours... ?

GOODSPEED

NOT NOW Isherwood.  Go to February 1976.  Who was

transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin that year?

ISHERWOOD

Two guys.  Joseph Wainwright, and a.... they don't have a

name, just "inmate 9999?"

GOODSPEED

Hit nine nine nine nine.

ISHERWOOD

This is weird.  They got medical records, place of birth -

Glasgow? but no name.  Wait a minute, there's a next of kin.  Jade

Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.  Bill did you, like, fuck

something up?  Bill?  Bill?

MASON

Jade.

MASON

Hello.  Yes.  It's me.

JADE

I uhm...  I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much

...

MASON

Let's uhm...  let's walk a ways.

JADE

So  how long have you been out?

MASON

A while.

JADE

A while.  And you didn't call?  You are free now, right?

MASON

I'm here with you, aren't I?

JADE

Why now?  I mean why today.

MASON

I was driving through San Francisco.  I decided it was time.

JADE

Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from

San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result.

You can imagine I'm pretty confused.

MASON

I tried to explain in my letters.

JADE

Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow.

MASON

I see.

(grumbles)

Bloody prison censors.

JADE

How about explaining now?

MASON

Maybe this isn't the best time...

(off her look)

Jade.  Here sitdown.

MASON

All will be explained.  You must trust me on this. Someday very soon,

after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you.  What I

need to know is: do you want me in your life?

JADE

How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years,

just start like that.

MASON

We are the same blood.

JADE

But I don't know you.

MASON

where to begin.

(sighs)

My name is John Paul Mason.  I'm Scottish.

I attended Dartmouth Naval College.  My favorite color is green.  I

like books.  I like a good joke.  At one time I shot a pretty fair round

of golf.  I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life.

(Jade looks away)

Maybe it's better I go.

JADE

No. You're doing okay.

JADE

You lied to me.

GOODSPEED

(flashes his I.D.)

F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a....

(looks at Mason)

.... dangerous situation.

JADE

He is?

GOODSPEED

Yes madam.  We've got to go, John.

MASON

Jade - remember what I said.

GOODSPEED

(sharply)

No cuffs until we get to the cars,

MASON

You surprise me, Goodspeed.  Now I'm going to surprise myself:

thank-you, you could have handled that differently.

GOODSPEED

(tight)

You almost got me killed.  Twice.

MASON

Hows your jaw?

GOODSPEED

It hurts.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and

cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars.  You try to escape

again and Agent Chaney here will break your legs.

MASON

Pleased to meet you.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Okay, one more time: down this second fork

fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber.  Turn left at the water pump,

then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...

MASON

No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber.  Fifty-seven to the

showers.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

(pointedly)

That's not what you said three minutes

ago.

MASON

(innocently)

It's not?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

(dagger stare at Mason)

Excuse me.

(rises)

Womack.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's

tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty

questions."

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with

me and I don't have the time.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(pause; he thinks)

What if he went with you?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission -

he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as

soon as we turn our backs on him?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I'll handle that.  Chaney.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

You're not cooperating, John.  Maybe this will

help.  I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz.

(no response)

Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have

seized it.  They've aimed fifteen poison gas rockets at the city.

Enough poison gas to kill every man, woman and child in San Francisco.

(smiles)

Yes, John, including your daughter.

MASON

You son-of-fucking-Satan.

F.B.I. DIRECTOA WOMACK

Mr. MASON has a strong incentive to help us,

Commander Anderson.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Get him some gear.  He's going to the Rock.

Goodspeed!

COMMANDER ANDERSON

The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize

the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.

GOODSPEED

Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas.

Here.  The prison morgue.

(points)

It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas

begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

GOODSPEED

No sir, but I've studied them ....

COMMANDER  ANDERSON

(sarcastic)

That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the

Bureau, so you've had weapons training.

GOODSPEED

A little, sir.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

So you've never been in a combat situation.

GOODSPEED

No sir.

(beat)

Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Won't be necessary.

GOODSPEED

Sir, these are very complicated devices...

COMMANDER ANDERSON

I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going

with us.

GOODSPEED

Sir?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

(to S.E.A.L. Reigert)

Get him some gear.

MASON

Wait just a minute.  This little twat's going to deal with the

poison?  He's gonna get us all fuckin' killed!

S.E.A.L. DANDO

Nice to meet you too.

SANCHEZ

You look like shit.

GOODSPEED

Thank you.

SANCHEZ

You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill,

you're too fucking smart for field work." Every year I put in for a

transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking

Maytag repairman in the commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and

it's a whole fuckin, city at stake?  Oh Jesus...

SANCHEZ

Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe

the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....

SANCHEZ

Spit it out.

GOODSPEED

My girlfriend's pregnant.

SANCHEZ

(pause)

What's the really bad news.

SANCHEZ

(V.0.)

Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT ...

SANCHEZ

Agent Cord, get over to the Pan Pacific Hotel and bring

Goodspeed's girlfriend to this facility please!!

CAPTAIN DARROW

(mumbling)

Seventeen hours left.  What the fuck is he

doing?  How much time does it take to transfer money from one account

...

CAPTAIN FRYE

Just a matter of time, buddy.  The Pentagonlll cave and

we'll be headin, south of the border a million dollars richer.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

Hummel.

SECURITY ADVISOR LOUIS LINDSTROM

Hello Frank, Lou Lindstrom.  I'm in the

oval office with General Kramer.

GENERAL KRAMER

We're having some problems with the account transfer,

Frank.

HUMMEL

Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.

GENERAL KRAMER

We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about

this.

HUMMEL

Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

The only thing the President will give you is a fair

trial after you're caught, General.

HUMMEL

That you, Sinclair?  What exactly do you do at the White House?

Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine?

Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ....

HUMMEL

You want respect, you child, you coffee server?  Let's talk about

Dave Ridgeway.

GENERAL KRAMER

Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?

HUMMEL

A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist

death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle.  His mother and young wife were

told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect

he got.

LOUIS LINDSTROM

This is going nowhere Frank ....

HUMMEL

Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to

man into San Franciscols business district.  You have twelve hours to

deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.

LOUIS LINDSTROM

What's the word from Mojave?

GENERAL KRAMER

General Petersen can give us no definite assurance on the

Willy Peter capability.

LOUIS LINDSTROM

Greenlight the S.E.A.L. incursion.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON

here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your

hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Shep, what's the status on the special operational

gear for Mason.

S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD

(hands over items)

one aluminum fork and one quart of

motor oil in a squeeze tube.

GOODSPEED

Motor oil?

MASON

For cottonmouth.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

GOODSPEED here's our specialist.  We will cover him

while he neutralizes the' chemical threat.  If he does his job we'll

launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes.  Make no

mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force

led by one hot-shit field commander.  We are in the fight of our lives,

I bullshit you not.  Any questions?  Let's move out.

MASON

After you, 'lace."

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Activate mini-cams.

NAVAL MEDIC

Atropine.  Any contact with the gas, use it.

GOODSPEED

Uhn uhn.  I hate needles.

SANCHEZ

Mini-cams operational.

CARLA

Would you please tell me what is going on?

AGENT CORD

Can't do that, malam.  Sorry.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

You know what you're doing?

MASON

Yes.  Little fancier than I'm used to.

He adjusts his depth and oxygen gauges.  Goodspeed, having a hard time,

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Prepare to deplore!

GOODSPEED

Wait a minute.

(Dando stops buckling)

What if this thing crashes ...

MASON

Smile Goodspeed.  Live a little.  Life is short...  especially

yours.

CAPTAIN FRYE

(V.O.)

Something on radar, sir.  Two Hueys in standard

formation, due east and approaching.

BAXTER

Decoy?

HUMMEL

Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the

island on the double.  Think we have visitors.

ROYCE

You heard the man, let's move it.

ROYCE

Looks all clear, sir.

BAXTER

Nothing.

HUMMEL

Tell 'em to stay out there.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us

to a room with no exit.

S.E.A.L. BOYER

Skipper, blow it or burn it?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

No time for the torch.  Explosives'll bring the

fucking world down on us. (turns to Mason) An idea, please, we're tight

on time.

MASON

Wait for me to unlock the door.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm

having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.

MASON

(points)

Under there.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

You are shitting me.  You catch one of those steam

bursts and you're a corpse.

MASON

True.

(unshoulders his equipment)

I memorized their timing.

S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD

Uhh sir, you said never leave his side ...

COMMANDER ANDERSON

You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd.

This man is going to die.

MASON

(grumbles to himself)

That's been said to me before ....

S.E.A.L. REIGERT

Who the fuck is this guy?  Houdini?

MASON

Welcome to the Rock.

S.E.A.L. DANDO

She's at least three inches thick sir.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Shit.  Burn it.

MASON

(muttering)

Guys are worthless.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Who is this guy... ?

COMMANDER ANDERSON

The shower room?

(MASON nods yes)

After you.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Motion sensor.

ROYCE

Sir.  Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower.  We got

visitors.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

(to Lt.  Shepherd in the drainage pipe)

Stand fast. We'll secure the area.

SANCHEZ

What's that...what the hell is that?

GOODSPEED

(whispers:)

What's going on?

S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD

(whispers)

Don't know.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

Drop your weapons.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives

of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them

on the deck at their feet-

SANCHEZ

Oh Christ this isn't happening.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree

with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against

all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic. (shouts now) General, we've

spilled the same blood in the same mud.  You know goddamn well that I

cannot give that order...

HUMMEL

Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.  I'm

not going to ask again.

HUMMEL

Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.

COMMANDER ANDERSON

You men following the General: You are United States

Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we

remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that

doesn't give you the right to mutiny.

HUMMEL

That's a nice speech, Commander.  I heard plenty like it in the

Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.  They all added up to zero.  Pretty words

aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander.  Now abort this mission.

Goddamn it, abort.

S.E.A.L. BOYER

It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ...

S.E.A.L. REIGERT

Get a grip on yourself ....

GOODSPEED

Don' t do it.

S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD

Let go of me.

HUMMEL

HOLD YOUR FIRE HOLD YOUR FIRE ....

SANCHEZ

It's over.

F.B.I. TECHNICIAN

We've still got movement.  Numbers eleven and twelve.

That's GOODSPEED and.... Mason.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

If mason's still alive, it's not over.

GOODSPEED

We're never gettin off this island.

GOODSPEED

(over tac radio)

.... god Jesus we're gonna die

SANCHEZ

You told me I am on a "need to know" basis.  Well goddamn it, I

need to know.  Who the fuck is John Mason.  Start talking, Director, or

I swear I will go to the press.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

1962.  J. Edgar Hoover is head of the F.B.I.,

some say the country.  It's no secret the esteemed Mr. Hoover kept

microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans. de Gaulle, British

members of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.  The man had dirt on

everyone in the world,

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

The British sent over their best operative, John

Mason, to steal it.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Our agents caught MASON

at the Canadian border but with no microfilm.  It's never been found.

So Hoover held him without trial.  The British claimed they didn't know him.

SANCHEZ

What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

He died in 1972.  She wasn't born yet Today it's

a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this.

SANCHEZ

My god, you're not saying ...

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

John MASON

has been incarcerated without trial on

American soil since 1962. He knows our most intimate secrets of

the last half century.  The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about

the J.F.K. assassination.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

(O.S.)

John MASON was an S.A.S. trained killer,

one of MI-6's best operatives ever - John MASON

was one of the most dangerous men on earth.

GOODSPEED

Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...

MASON

For christ's sake. MASON trudges down the tu=el.  Goodspeed

follows him.

GOODSPEED

Wait.  Where're you going?

MASON

Off this island.  You mind?

GOODSPEED

Yes I mind.  I mind very much.

SANCHEZ

(O.S.)

(over tac radio)

Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.

MASON

You've got a phone call.

GOODSPEED

It's me sir.

SANCHEZ

(O.S.)

What is happening?  Where's Mason?

GOODSPEED

He says he's leaving the island sir.

SANCHEZ

Don't let him do that.

GOODSPEED

He's got a gun, sir.

SANCHEZ

What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!

HUMMEL

I never wanted this.  Jesus christ.

BAXTER

We knew it might happen, Frank.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Maybe now they'll pay up.

CAPTAIN HENDRIX

Maybe now they won't.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Then maybe we'll execute a few hostages.

S.E.A.L. DANDO

You'll go to hell for this General.

CAPTAIN DARROW

(to Pvt.  Royce)

Put a bullet in him.

CAPTAIN FRYE

You heard him.  End it.

HUMMEL

CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM.

CAPTAIN DARROW

(lowers sidearm)

Yes sir.

ROYCE

He's dead anyway sir.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

(over monitor)

You have a made a terrible mistake and more

of our brothers have died in vain.  Let's not repeat this.

SGT.  CRISP

General!  This man's weapons and tac radio are missing!

HUMMEL

Rodent problem, people.  Let's flush the pipes.

GOODSPEED

would you stop.  Just stop.

(MASON  stops)

I don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million

people across that bay who might die...

(MASON continues)

Fuck this. Stop.  Freeze.

CAPTAIN HENDRIX

(whispers in tac mike)

Rodents located.

GOODSPEED

F.B.I. 	Stop right there.  I really mean it.

MASON

(stops)

If you really mean it, take the safety off.

SANCHEZ

(V.O.)

(over tac radio)

Goodspeed.  Goodspeed, come in.  Have you resolved this?

GOODSPEED

Now he has all the guns, sir. .

(clicks off the tac radio)

You've got to help me.  What do you want me to do, beg?

MASON

Save your breath and your dignity, if you have any.  I am leaving.

I am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here.

MASON

Hold your breath.

MASON

Come on.  And keep your mouth shut.

GOODSPEED

Now what?

MASON

Came out right through there. (squeezes through the hole; mutters)

'Course I've gained a few since ...

MASON

Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue.

(off Goodspeed's blank stare)

You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

I don't get it.  You're going to help me?

MASON

No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you

think?

GOODSPEED

You don't have to get all bent out of shape.

MASON

What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through

to freedom five minutes ago.

GOODSPEED

All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?

MASON

Cottonmouth snakes.  They breath through their skin.  Oil clogs

it.  They hate the stuff.

MASON

sprays the motor oil across the pool.  The snakes scatter.  The

pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK.  MASON

wades in.  Goodspeed follows.

GOODSPEED

Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're

the convict, and you have all the guns.

GOODSPEED

The morgue?

MASON

Never hesitate.

GOODSPEED

You didn't learn that in prison.

MASON

No, and I used to be a lot quicker.

GOODSPEED

I've got some questions for you but they can wait.

GOODSPEED

Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.

GOODSPEED

I need a hand here.

(MASON looks anxiously at the poison pearls.)

Mason.  Now.

MASON

What...  exactly does this do to you?

GOODSPEED

Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge

at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system.

(hands over another poison pearl strand)

Then loss of muscular function.

Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled

on the floor, then your skin turns black...

MASON

Sounds like my first marriage.

GOODSPEED

(into tac radio)

Pier 39 come in.

SANCHEZ

(V.O.)

(tac radio)

Goodspeed?  Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.

GOODSPEED

We're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance

system chips.

(to Mason)

Without em the rocketslll fly about 500

feet and splash down like a wounded duck.

HUMMEL

(O.S.)

Gamble, Starling.  Come in.

HUMMEL

(O.S.)

Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.

HUMMEL

The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit quickly.

MASON

C'mon c'mon....  faster ....

MASON

I thought you were cool under pressure.

GOODSPEED

Shut up; you're making me nervous.

MASON

They'll be on us in twenty seconds.

GOODSPEED

Wait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds.

There's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.

HUMMEL

Hendrix!  Take Royce and Scarpetti!

BAXTER

Gamble and Starling are dead.

CAPTAIN HENDRIX

FOLLOW ON FOOT!

MASON

BRAKE! ! !

GOODSPEED

Mason!

GOODSPEED

Wait.

GOODSPEED

Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me?

Punk.

(beat)

What're you waiting for?  Limp dick.

ROYCE

I am going to fuck you up something fierce.  You rolled the wrong

number, shithead.  You crapped out.

GOODSPEED

I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.

MASON

Limp dick?

GOODSPEED

MASON

I think I've got arthritis.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

The President arrives in three hours.  His directive is

to string Hummel along until the airstrike is operational.

LOUIS LINDSTROM

What's the word from Mojave, General?

GENERAL KRAMER

(grim)

They're going as fast as they can.

LT. FISK

We're fucked, cap'n.

CPT.  GILER

Are we fucked with a pencil or are we fucked with a baseball

bat.

LT. FISK

We're fucked with a telephone pole. (turns to the missiles) we

can arm em with Willy Peter, no problem, but negatory pn smart bomb

capability.

CPT.  GILER

What are you saying?

LT. FISK

The pilots are gonna have to drop em manually.  We're talkin,

retro, baby.  We're talkin' World War II.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

(loudspeaker)

Attention Navy Seals, attention.

GOODSPEED

He thinks we're Seals.

HUMMEL

(V. 0. )

(loudspeaker)

Congratulations.  You've taken some things

of mine.  I can't convince you to return them so I'll put on someone who can.

MALE VOICE

(V.O.)

(loudspeaker)

Hell...  hello.

HUMMEL

Tell them your name and age.

LARRY HENDERSON

My n...name is L... larry Henderson.  I'm forty-eight.

HUMMEL

Good Mr. Henderson, continue ...

LARRY HENDERSON

I don't know who you are, but p please, there's a gun

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

(loudspeaker)

Convinced?  Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have

two minutes.

GOODSPEED

I'll go.

MASON

Wrong.

GOODSPEED

What, vou?

MASON

I'm not the chemical weapons expert.

GOODSPEED

Good point.  Okay here, take 'em.

GOODSPEED

What are you doing?

MASON

Now they only have three rockets left.

GOODSPEED

What about Mr. Henderson?

MASON

Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.

GOODSPEED

Wait.

MASON

(stops; turns)

Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men

guarding them.

GOODSPEED

I... I don't know if I can do this.

MASON

There's only one way to find out.  I'll try to give you time.  And

Goodspeed....

(tosses GOODSPEED his ATROPINE SYRINGE)

Don't be an idiot. Put that on.

GOODSPEED

Well thank-you, thank-you very much.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Gotta be kidding me.  They send an old man.

HUMMEL

I thought I'd been in the service a long time.  Name and rank,

sailor.

MASON

John Paul Mason.

(stares at Hummel)

Royal Navy.  Commander.

HUMMEL

You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.

MASON

I feel strangely at home.

HUMMEL

How's that?

MASON

You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

HUMMEL

Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility,

Commander Mason?

MASON

Quite unique.

HUMMEL

How's that?

MASON

I was a guest here.

GOODSPEED

(V.O.)

Freeze.

(Cox freezes)

Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.

HUMMEL

Well you're some kind of joker, Mason.  Maybe you're a lunatic.

Are you of sound mind, Mason?

MASON

I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people.  You

are.

HUMMEL

Give me the guidance chips.

MASON

I threw them in the bay.

HUMMEL

That was stupid of you.

MASON

(re: hostage Henderson)

Would you have shot him7

HUMMEL

You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand

necessity.

MASON

Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins."

John Locke.

HUMMEL

"Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible.

Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.

MASON

Article 7, American Constitution?  "Treason against the United

States shall consist of... 11

HUMMEL

The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander.

Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and

stupidity.

(beat)

I see little difference in my motivation.

HUMMEL

Do you, Commander Mason?

HUMMEL

Frye, Crisp, go!

MCCOY

Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your

belly open and pull it out.

Goes to the bars:

GOODSPEED

Mason.

(no response)

Mason?

MASON

(V.O.)

It's about time.

GOODSPEED

Where are you?

MASON

Above you.

(under his breath)

Literally and figuratively.

MASON

GOODSPEED

This is tiny.

MASON

You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of

your anatomy ....

GOODSPEED

The cell, Mason.

MASON

Five feet by seven.  Try living in one for a year.  What happened?

GOODSPEED

I only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.

MASON

(sarcastic)

Surprise, surprise.

GOODSPEED

I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.

MASON

An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.

GOODSPEED

What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.

MASON

Let's say our countries had a little dispute.  They both knowingly

shafted me.

GOODSPEED

How?

MASON

Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed?  I don't mean a vacuum

cleaner ...

GENERAL PETERSON

Captain Giler?

CPT.  GILER

We jerry-rigged a release lever.  You'll find it on the left

side of the cockpit.  It's got two positions: safety and release.  Throw

it on release, the bomb drops in five seconds.  Change your mind, throw

it back on safety.  Any questions?

GOODSPEED

Jesus.

(thinks)

Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau

where the microfilm was?  Make a trade?

MASON

Some trade.  They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the

head.

GOODSPEED

I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your

escape.

MASON

What?

GOODSPEED

You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the

power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe -

that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?

GOODSPEED

(cont'd)

I only ask because, in our current situation, it

might be useful information ...

MASON

Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this:	it was easier than

getting in.

GOODSPEED

Hey!  Hey what's happening?

(no response)

Mason.  Mason?

MASON

You're on your own, kid.  Your gear's over there.

GOODSPEED

Shit....

HUMMEL

Time.

BAXTER

(consults his watch)

Fifteen minutes Frank.

HUMMEL

I heard you Captain.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Prepare for launch General?  General?

HUMMEL

Not yet.

CAPTAIN FRYE

General Hummel, noon is approaching.

HUMMEL

I'm aware of the time, Captain.

LOUIS LINDSTROM

When was the last communication from our men on

Alcatraz?

GENERAL KRAMER

Seven hours ago.

GENERAL KRAMER

Get me the President.

GOODSPEED

Mason.  John.

(MASON stops)

What happened - the injustice done

to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this.  A million people

across that Bay will die.

MASON

Only one of them I care about.

GOODSPEED

You were once a different man.

MASON

You don't know what kind of man I was.

GOODSPEED

You were a civil servant.  Sworn to do your duty.  Just like

me.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Eleven fifty-seven, General.  Three minutes to go.

HUMMEL

They're going to call.

CAPTAIN FRYE

They are not going to call General.

HUMMEL

I... I don't understand this.

CAPTAIN DARROW

I understand it.  They're calling our bluff.  We have two

operational rockets left.  We have to stick one of those rockets in

their ear, General.

HUMMEL

Atom?

BAXTER

I'...I don't know Frank.

HUMMEL

Seventy thousand peqple...  I didn't... i didn't ever...

CAPTAIN FRYE

You didn't ever what?

(no response)

You didn't ever what, General?

(gets in Hummel's face)

General, forty-eight hours ago I was in

a cushy job at Pendleton.  As of this moment I am subject to prosecution

for treason and murder.  Do you know what that means.  It means the

electric chair.  For all of us.

BAXTER

He's right Frank.  Authorize the launch or it's over.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Authorize the launch, General.

GOODSPEED

You'll never make it.

MASON

I once swam the English Channel, but you're entitled to

your,opinion.

GOODSPEED

Fine.  I'll fuckin, do it myself.

HUMMEL

(V.O.)

(over walkie-talkie)

Launch coordinates 675 dash 439.

CAPTAIN FRYE

Aye aye General: coordinates 675 dash Awaiting launch

command.

CAPTAIN FRYE

(V.O.)

(over walkie-talkie)

(beat)

General, your command.

HUMMEL

(closes his eyes)

Fire.

MASON

(hushed)

My god. MASON looks up. GOODSPEED stands above on the

embankment.

GOODSPEED

That change things?

F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN

They fired a rocket.  It's headed east.

SANCHEZ

East.  But that's... Oakland. (dawns on him) My god.  The

football game.

GOODSPEED

Partners?

MASON

Partners.

watches the video monitor nervously. His jaws

F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN

Sir, it's heading.,.into the bay?

CIWTER FISHERMAN

What the hell.... ?

CAPTAIN FRYE

I don't believe it.  He pulled the plug.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

They need a decision Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

These past few hours have been the longest, darkest of my

life.  This is when you wish the buck did not stop here.

(beat)

A balance between two tragedies. On one hand the fate of a million civilians.

On the other, Frank Hummel.  That we have ignored or abandoned or marginalized

a great soldier like Frank Hummel and that American boys have paid the

price of that neglect in blood, is equally real, and equally tragic.

HAYDEN SINCLAIR

The glass is half full not half empty, sir.  No civilian

casualties so far.

PRESIDENT

I don't believe in half full or half empty, Sinclair.  There

are chemical weapons and there are civilians.  And there are men on

Alcatraz wholve proved they're willing to use the one on the other.

(beat) We are at war with terror.  Fighting a war means casualties.

This is the worst call I've ever had to make. (takes the phone) Air

strike approved.

GOODSPEED and MASON

CAPTAIN FRYE

You're gutless.  I knew it.

CAPTAIN DARROW

The problem is now thev know it.

HUMMEL

Careful son.  I'd maintain discipline if I were you.

CAPTAIN DARROW

I'm relieving you of your command General.  Captain Frye?

CAPTAIN FRYE

I'm in.

CAPTAIN DARROW

Major?

HUMMEL

Tom?

BAXTER

It's over Frank.

(to Darrow)

I'm in.

HUMMEL

Tom, I warn you.

BAXTER

Stand down, General.

HUMMEL

I'm giving you a direct order.

BAXTER

(draws his .45)

I'm not accepting it.

HUMMEL

My god what have I done ...

GOODSPEED

It's not too late, General.  Tell me where the last chem round

is.

HUMMEL

(gasps for air)

Lower lighthouse ...

MASON

Do your job, Billy. - I'll try to hold ,em off.

GOODSPEED

Don't ...

CAPTAIN DARROW

Give that to me.

GOODSPEED

You shoot me, I'll drop this and we're both dead.  One of

these pearlslll kill everything within 200 feet.  You know how this shit

works?

CAPTAIN DARROW

You know how this shit works?

GOODSPEED

You know the Elton John son, "Rocket Man"?

CAPTAIN DARROW

I hate it.

GOODSPEED

Well it happens to be my favorite fuckin, song!

F.B.I. RADAR TECHNICIAN

Second rocket's away, sir. (confused look) It

went in the Bay sir.

CAPTAIN FRYE

Give me the guidance chip.

CAPTAIN FRYE

You're comin, with me.

SANCHEZ

May god have mercy gn their souls.

CARLA

(face buried in his hands)

You can't do this, you can't let this

happen.

F.B.I. TECHNICIAN

Ten seconds to the drop zone.  And now counting eight,

seven, six ...

F.B.I. TECHNICIAN

Green smoke!  It's...   GOODSPEED!!

SANCHEZ

Abort.  Abort immediately.

F-16 FLIGHT CONTROLLER

ABORT, RED THUNDER, ABORT!

REAR F-16 PILOT

LEAD F-16 PILOT

Then peel off...

GOODSPEED

My god he's alive.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

GOODSPEED

(V.O.)

Every one of em sir.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

What about Mason?

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Goodspeed.  Is Mason-alive?

GOODSPEED

(deep breath)

Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.

SANCHEZ

Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.

GOODSPEED

Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that

pardon contract you signed?

MASON

Womack ripped it up, right?

GOODSPEED

You knew?  All this time?

MASON

I'm not a fool, Billy.

GOODSPEED

All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go

back.

MASON

Goodspeed.  You know the etymology of your name?

GOODSPEED

God's speed.

MASON

Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.

MASON

And if you turn around I'll tell you a secret.

MASON

(O.S.)

St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.

Right leg.  Hollow.

GOODSPEED

What's that? (beat) Mason?

SANCHEZ

You surprised me, kid.  Never thought you could do it.

GOODSPEED

Neither did I sir.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

Where's Mason?

GOODSPEED

Vaporized, sir.  Blown out to sea.

GOODSPEED

He saved my life, sir. Is SANCHEZ  going to accept this? .

SANCHEZ

Yes

(smiles; acknowledges)

Poor son-of-a-bitch.

F.B.I. AGENT

Sir, the White House calling.  It's the President.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I'll take it.

F.B.I. AGENT

Uhm, sir, actually it's for Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED

Bill Goodspeed, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(V.O.)

I am in your debt, Goodspeed, the country is in your

debt.  You're a hero, son.

GOODSPEED

Thank you, Mr. President.  The man you should be thanking is

John Mason.

PRESIDENT

(V.O.)

So I've been informed. Would you put the F.B.I.

Director on please?

GOODSPEED

Director Womack.

F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

I can explain all of this, sir ...

PRESIDENT

(V.O.)

I don't want your explanation, Womack. I want your

resignation.

CARLA

Would you please tell me what this is all about... ?

GOODSPEED

You want to know who really killed President Kennedy, honey...?
