15 Minutes

EMIL (V.O.)

Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I

say.  Don't open your mouth.

OLEG (V.O.)

Okay.

EMIL

Don't fool around.

OLEG

Okay.

EMIL

Did you hear what I said?

OLEG

I want to document my trip to America.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Next.

(Emil steps up)

Could I see your documents, please?

EMIL

Yes sir.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

What is your intended purpose of your

visit to the United States?

EMIL

Two weeks holiday.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

How much money are you carrying with

you?

EMIL

I have five-hundred dollars.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the

FIS area!

IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)

(to Emil)

Is he with you?  Are you travelling

together?

EMIL

Yes.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Please join us.

(to Oleg)

Come on forward.

EMIL

Is there a problem?

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

No, you're travelling together.  I want

to talk to you together.  Hi, how are

you?  Can I take a look at your

documents?

(takes Oleg's passport)

Are you related?

OLEG

Yes...he's my friend.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Okay.  You're a Czech national and

you're a Russian national.  How do you

know one another?

EMIL

We are both from Prague.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

(to Oleg)

How long are you planning to stay?

EMIL

Two weeks.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

EMIL

He doesn't speak English.

OLEG

I speak English.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

(to Oleg)

Then answer my questions.  Where were

you planning to stay during the two

weeks that you're here?

OLEG

New York.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Yes, we're in New York now.  But where

are you planning to stay in New York?

OLEG

A cheap hotel.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

What are you coming here to do?

OLEG

I'm here for movies.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Movies...to be in the movies or to see

movies?

OLEG

Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I

see movie at school called "It's a

Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra.

Ever since I want to come to America.

Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A

land where anyone can be anything. As

long as they are white.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Excuse me?

EMIL

He made joke, bad joke.  First time on

airplane...

IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Well, they've got valid visas, but they

don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm

not...uh, I think there's a possibility

they may be coming to live and reside.

SUPERVISOR

Look how long the line is.  We gotta

move 'em out.  I'll take them down to

secondary.

EDDIE

So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -

we got Emergency Service with the heavy

weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I

say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I

go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the

sudden I turn around and a kid with a

shotgun let one go.  Right where I was

standin'.  That coulda been it.  I

coulda had my head blown off and for

what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,

takes the safety off and it's over.  If

I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for

a bad habit - I would've had my head

blown off.

HAWKINS

Jesus Christ.

PAULIE

Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

HAWKINS

Another martini.

LEON

Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

EDDIE

Vodka tonic.

LEON

(rethinks it)

Maybe you could just put in a shot of

Martell?

LEON (CONT'D)

(of Eddie's story)

It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid

kid.

EDDIE

What's the kid gonna say - sorry?

Meanwhile I'm not here anymore.

Like last week - we were at the morgue

and this guy was all chopped up - spleen

here - liver there - his heart in a pan.

Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his

dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who

knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3

or some shit and shot him and now you

can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a

human being and I'm thinkin' that's me.

Sooner or later.  That's me.

HAWKINS

Sooner or later that's everybody.

EDDIE

Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like

that.  I mean, what do I got left?

Coupla articles.  A medal or two.

Plaque here and there and in a coupla

years no one remembers me anymore.

HAWKINS

I think you're getting a little moody

there, Eddie.

EDDIE

I'm not moody.

HAWKINS

Isn't he a little moody?

LEON

Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in

love.

HAWKINS

In love?  With who?

EDDIE

How old are your kids?

HAWKINS

My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15.

Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're

thinking about having a kid!  How old

are you?  Never mind.

Let me just tell you this: Every stupid

cliche you hear about kids - they change

your life, they make you a better

person, they make you whole...

(beat)

It's all true!  Before I had kids when

friends talked about their kids, I

wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I

right, Leon?

LEON

Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have

all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody

so much as looks sideways at my four

girls -- I'd kill 'em.

(takes out his wallet)

You haven't seen my youngest have you?

LEON (CONT'D)

Yeah?

HAWKINS

Paulie, you've got kids, right?

PAULIE

My kids don't talk to me anymore but

they were great when they were young.

LEON

(into the phone)

Sure it's him?  Great!

(collapses the phone)

Unique's home.

EDDIE

Paulie, I need the cure.

PAULIE

Step into my office.

HAWKINS

So you got your kids listening to Opera?

You still singing in the church on the

weekends?

SECONDARY OFFICER

Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I

understand that.

(to Emil)

And what kind of work do you do?

EMIL

I am butcher.

SECONDARY OFFICER

You're a butcher?  What do you use pig

intestines for?

EMIL

You stuff sausage in it.

SECONDARY OFFICER

And what do you do with the bones?

EMIL

Dog food.

SECONDARY OFFICER

Are you married?

EMIL

No.  Are you proposing?

EDDIE

Will you marry me?  Wanna get married?

What are you doin' Saturday?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I'm gonna propose.

LEON

When?

EDDIE

Tomorrow.  At lunch.

LEON

You ready?

EDDIE

The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

OLEG

(in Russian)

Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the

movies!

EMIL

(in Czech)

Don't speak Russian!

OLEG

(in Russian)

Why?  Why do I always have to speak to

you in Czech?

EMIL

(in Czech)

Because I don't like your ugly language.

I heard enough of it in school!  Now

speak Czech or English.  And don't fool

around anymore.  You almost got us

thrown out!

OLEG

Look.  New videocameras.  Color

viewfinder.  Image stabilization.

Solarization.  Night vision.

EMIL

We have no money.  Come on.

CABBIE

Where you wanna go, buddy?

EMIL

Here.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Go!

HAWKINS

So what's unique?

EDDIE

Not what.  Who.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was

taking too long to put her make-up on.

they were late for a party.  Stabbed her

with a beer bottle.

HAWKINS

That's unique.

EDDIE

Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

LOOKOUT

Top floor.  Back room.

EDDIE

Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the

news and I look good.  But the problem

with becoming a star is downtown.  They

shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees

are killing me.  Stay behind me.

HAWKINS

You're worried for my safety.  I'm

touched.

HAWKINS (CONT'D)

Ready?

EDDIE

Keep them out of my way.

HAWKINS

Okay.  You ready?

EDDIE

Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

HAWKINS

(into his cell phone)

COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,

LET'S MOVE IT!

EDDIE

What's your rush?  Going to a party?

UNIQUE

Why you chasin' me, man?

EDDIE

I don't know.  You always come outta

your house that way?

UNIQUE

It's not my house, man.  I don't live

here.

EDDIE

Well, sounds like burglary to me.

UNIQUE

I know you man.

HAWKINS

(to Eddie)

Any chance we can do that again?

EDDIE

Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first

time.

EMIL

Turn that off!  Get the bags.

OLEG

Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a

dog.

EMIL

For five years I paid for your

stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the

rest of my life if I say so.

(challenging)

Unless you refuse, Oleg.

EMIL (CONT'D)

There.  5RW.

OLEG

What?

EMIL

Smell like chemicals...for smoking

drugs.

MILOS

Emil???!

EMIL

Surprise!  Surprise!

EMIL

Your sister said she didn't know where

you were so you shouldn't write to her

with return address if you're hiding.

MILOS

Did you hurt her?

EMIL

You know me...I never hurt anybody.

Where's the money?

OLEG

Hello, Tamina.

MILOS

Take your eyes off her, Oleg!

(to Emil)

Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were

caught.

(of Oleg)

It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank

clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going

to wait!!!

EMIL

Milos.  Get my money!

MILOS

(nervously)

We spent it!

EMIL

Ha. Ha.

MILOS

Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber.

You think I'd be working if I had

money?!

MILOS (CONT'D)

Emil.  Put down the knife.

MILOS (CONT'D)

Emil.  I'll help you.

MILOS (CONT'D)

I can get you a job.

EMIL

A job?

MILOS

Yes, the money is good.

EMIL

As a plumber?!

MILOS

It's easy to learn.

EMIL

A job??  As a plumber???  You think I

come to America to work!

MILOS

We started over, you can too.

EMIL

(furious)

You spent all the money while I was in

prison?  Now you tell me to get a job

fixing toilets?!?

EMIL (CONT'D)

She saw!

EMIL (CONT'D)

Daphne Hanlova.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Six month visa.  Still here two years

later.  They'll deport her if she goes

to Police.

OLEG

What are you looking for?

EMIL

I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

MUGGER

Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare

twenty?

JORDY

Look, I don't have time for you, get out

of my way!!

MUGGER

Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'

money?

JORDY

Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you

happy?

MUGGER

Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry

guns.

JORDY

Oh yeah?  Guess again.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Nice - how many people you ripped off

tonight?!  Get up!

JORDY (CONT'D)

You couldn't listen to me, could you?

JORDY (CONT'D)

I'll send a cop back for you.

MUGGER

Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like

this.  Some freak'll come by and stab

me!

MUGGER (CONT'D)

Wait!  Come back!!

LOUIE

Lieutenant - take up your line and

relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top

floor.

JORDY

Hey, Louie, were you first due?

LOUIE

Yeah, I radioed you guys right away

'cause you got two roasts on the top

floor but you don't hafta investigate

cause homicide is up there.

JORDY

Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't

make it a crime scene yet.

LOUIE

Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

KORFIN (O.S.)

Yo, Jordy!

KORFIN (CONT'D)

Where you been, man?  We got a

celebrity!

JORDY

I heard.  Who the hell let them up

there?

KORFIN

I don't know, you think Eddie will give

me his autograph?

JORDY

You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody

suspicious?

KORFIN

Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

JORDY

Oh yeah, why?

KORFIN

'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by

now!

LEON

So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine

position - that they were doin' each

other but were so whacked out of their

heads they set the pipe on the mattress,

lit it up, and they got fried.  What do

you think, Eddie?

EDDIE

I don't know.  We got the experts here.

Show them what you found - I hope you

don't mind, we came over to see if we

could help.

KORFIN

Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -

Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with

you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

JORDY

Could you put out the cigar?  Part of

the job is picking up scents.

EDDIE

Oh, sure.

LEON

Well, I found - check it out - crack

pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

LEON (CONT'D)

Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

KORFIN

Sorry, bro.

JORDY

Hey, that's great you guys got it all

wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go

through the routine?  It gives us

somethin' to do.

EDDIE

No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

LEON

No.  Go ahead.

JORDY

Thanks.  Appreciate it.

KORFIN

Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got

good patterns - about thirty minutes

old.

JORDY

Mouth's clean, too.

KORFIN

Clean?

JORDY

Don't blow your nose!

JORDY (CONT'D)

The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -

burn 'em out.  Let it run.

KORFIN

But you knew that, right?

JORDY

So the way you see it, two crack heads

burned themselves up?

LEON

That's what it looks like to me.

JORDY

And while they're burning up, they're

still goin' down on each other?  You got

to hand it to them.

LEON

(realizes he's wrong - blows it

off)

Yeah, well, some people got their

priorities straight.

LEON (CONT'D)

What was that?

JORDY

Evidence.  Of a homicide.

JORDY (CONT'D)

You know what that is, right?

EDDIE

No, what is it?

JORDY

Why don't you explain it, Bobby.

(to a fireman joking a wall)

Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole

in the floor?

CAMELLO

No problem.

(to Eddie and Leon)

Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna

back up a little more.  Don't wanna get

your pants wet.

KORFIN

They have not soot in their mouths,

which means they weren't breathin'

before the fire and that usually means

they were deceased - and this piece of

cloth that my partner found means they

were wrapped up in something, probably

doused with a flammable liquid and

positioned like this on the bed.  To the

untrained eye, it looks like an

accident.

LEON

What's he looking for?

EDDIE

A timer.

KORFIN

Here you go.  A big double homicide.

KORFIN

You see Eddie's face when I gave him the

timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

JORDY

He knew all along.

KORFIN

What??

JORDY

That's why he was so quiet.  He was

testing us.

NICOLETTE

Detective, does it look like a murder?

EDDIE

We don't know that yet.  It's much too

early.  There's a lot to be done.

NICOLETTE

How many victims are up there?

EDDIE

There are two bodies found at this

point.

NICOLETTE

Can we go up to the crime scene?

EDDIE

You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

NICOLETTE

Is it drug related?

EDDIE

We don't know.  When I have more I'll

let you know.

NICOLETTE

Detective...what's that you're holding

in your hand?  Evidence?

KORFIN

What?

JORDY

There was a woman - I think she wanted

to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh

shit!  Oh no!

MUGGER

You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped

me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me

all over, it was disgusting.

JORDY

I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

JORDY (CONT'D)

You okay?

MUGGER

A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you

for this!  You violated my civil rights!

JORDY

Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob

me!  I could arrest you right now!

You're lucky you're walking away from

this.  Now get outta here.

ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)

So you slept with your son's wife!

What's that all about?

FATHER (ON T.V.)

I take full responsibility for sleepin'

with my daughter in law.  I had low self

esteem, I thought I had to compete with

him.

EMIL

(mutters)

Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

FATHER (ON T.V.)

Losin' my job and everything, caused my

behavioral disorder.

(turns to his son)

Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

EMIL

(Czech)

Turn that fucking thing off!

OLEG

(Czech)

I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos

die.  It's just like a move but realer.

(Czech)

Don't break it!  Don't break it!

EMIL

Speak English!

OLEG

(English)

You said speak Czech!

EMIL

How you erase this?

OLEG

I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

EMIL

Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill

him.

(noticing)

What's this?

EMIL (CONT'D)

Worldly escorts?

SEXY VOICE

Hi?

EMIL

Hello?

SEXY VOICE

Are you looking for companionship?

OLEG

Whore?

EMIL

I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European

girl?  A Czech girl?

SEXY VOICE

Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech

girl.

EMIL

I take her.  Send her!

JORDY

Now that you know him, maybe you can get

extra work in the next movie they make

about him.

KORFIN

Yeah?

JORDY

Maybe you can be his stand-in.

CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)

What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie

Flemming the evidence?!

DUFFY

(pointing to the TV)

Who did cause and origin?

JORDY

Who do you think, Chief?!

DUFFY

Then why didn't you talk to the

reporter?

JORDY

'Cause we got more important things to

do, like finding out who did it.

DUFFY

Don't you guys understand?  It's all

about image.  The better we look the

more money I get to pay you guys

overtime.

KORFIN

Yeah, right.

DUFFY

What was that, Korfin?

KORFIN

I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As

soon as we get somethin' we'll let you

alert the media.

DUFFY

You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve

this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

GARCIA

Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just

gave a full confession.

MAX

It's my fire!  Screw homicide.  I'll

tell you guys everything!

JORDY

What's that on your forehead, Max?

That's a nice attention getter.

MAX

Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist

like you!  Now, are you guys gonna

arrest me, or not?

JORDY

How did you start the fire this time?

MAX

I used an accelerant.

JORDY

Yeah?  What kind?

MAX

(to Jordy)

Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about

your wife leavin' you.

KORFIN

Max.

MAX

(continuing)

...Yeah, and with your old man dying

last year you - what's it?  Just you and

the dog now?

KORFIN

Max!

MAX

Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy

your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a

big shot downtown.

JORDY

That's it!  You're outta here.

MAX

That's it.  I'm suing.

KORFIN

Get in line.

JORDY

What's so funny.  How does he know so

much about me?  Who tells him my life

story?

GARCIA

He hangs around downstairs.  The guys

talk to him.  He's a joke...

JORDY

He's no joke!  One day he's gonna

graduate from trash can fires and do

something big.

GARCIA

Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the

station.

ROBERT HAWKINS

Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and

this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you

an exclusive interview with Stephen

Geller - who horrified the nation two

years ago when he went berserk and

murdered three clerks in a Manhattan

shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's

claim, spoken softly and articulately,

is that he is the victim.  According to

Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful

day were not his fault but were the

fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to

believe...watch.

EMIL (O.S.)

Louder.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Louder.

STEPHEN GELLER

This had nothing to do with shoes that

didn't fit or my relationship with my

father who, as you know, made a fortune

selling penny loafers in the fifties.

These people died because of the

criminal actions of my doctor.

ROBERT HAWKINS

Your doctor?

STEPHEN GELLER

Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that

I stay on my medication.

ROBERT HAWKINS

...so you feel absolutely no

responsibility for killing these people?

STEPHEN GELLER

It was my finger that pulled the

trigger, but I'm not morally

responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what

I was capable of.  How could I know.

I'm not a doctor.

ROBERT HAWKINS

You seem very savvy for a man who's been

found mentally incompetent to stand

trial.

STEPHEN GELLER

Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a

year away from getting my masters in

Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life

has been permanently disrupted.

ROBERT HAWKINS

Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you

selling paintings now for quite a lot of

money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you

call it, jump started your career as an

artist?

STEPHEN GELLER

Look, I'm in here.  You call this a

career move?

ROBERT HAWKINS

And isn't there a movie in the works

about you?

STEPHEN GELLER

We're in negotiations, that's correct.

ROBERT HAWKINS

But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent

criminals from profiting from their

crimes?

STEPHEN GELLER

That doesn't apply to me because I'm not

a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I

wasn't convicted.

EMIL

I love America.  No one is responsible

for what they do.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Get in the bathroom!

OLEG (O.S.)

Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

EMIL

Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and

shut up!

HONEY

Hi, I'm Honey.

EMIL

Where's Czech girl?

HONEY

Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be.

I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm

a Czech girl.

HONEY (CONT'D)

Now I like to get business out of the

way before we get down to pleasure.  Why

don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

EMIL

I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you

know her?

HONEY

It's an outcall service run out of an

apartment.  I don't meet the other

girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

EMIL

Where is escort service?

HONEY

That's confidential.  Could you put the

money on the dresser?

EMIL

I like to talk to the person who runs

the service.  Can you give me address?

HONEY

Look.  Do we have a problem here?

There's no reason to have a problem.

I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You

wanna Czech girl?

After I'm done with you, you won't miss

her.  Now why don't you pay me?

EMIL

(stopping her)

Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just

give me the address and then you go.

HONEY

(suddenly hard as nails)

Look, man, I don't give a shit if you

want sex or not, but you're payin' for

my time.

EMIL

Give me the address!!

HONEY

Alright, alright - don't hurt me!

Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

JORDY (O.S.)

Her lips are fuller than that.  You can

see 'em a mile away.

COMPOSITE ARTIST

What about her cheek bones?

JORDY

Her cheek bones are prominent and her

eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when

I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she

was looking to get away.  But she was

absolutely beautiful.

JORDY (CONT'D)

I gotta good look at her.

KORFIN

-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long

have they been livin' in your building?

(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)

Alright, I'll be in touch when we know

somethin'.

(to Jordy)

Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were

quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord

don't know who your girl is.

JORDY

How long they been livin' here?

KORFIN

You hear that question, Garcia?

GARCIA

Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -

they've been here illegally.

KORFIN

Well, they're definitely permanent

residents now.

GARCIA

I got the owner of the plumbing company

Milos worked for.

KORFIN

Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go

see him in the morning.

JORDY

You go home.  I'm takin' your car and

goin' back to the crime scene.

KORFIN

Aren't you tired?

JORDY

If I go home I won't be able to fall

asleep anyway.

KORFIN

(of the picture)

She keepin' you up?  Like to meet her,

huh?  She'd make you forget your ex

wife.  Cure your insomnia.

EDDIE

Okay to smoke?

JORDY

It's your crime scene now.  You can do

what you want.

EDDIE

Watch the news?

JORDY

Nah, I musta missed it.

EDDIE

Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys

the credit.

JORDY

Well, just so you know, I don't care

about that stuff.

EDDIE

Nah, why should you?

JORDY

I don't even watch TV.

EDDIE

Good.  Good.  Commendable.

JORDY

Did you get a report from the M.E.?

EDDIE

Sure.  But I would like to ask you

something.  You got a problem with me?

JORDY

If you found me steppin' on your crime

scene - it might piss you off, too.

(then)

What about the report?

EDDIE

You were right, they were both dead

before the fire.  The male was stabbed

so hard the killer broke off the tip of

the knife in his spine.  That's usually

an indicator of something personal.

JORDY

The Super said he'd seen her before but

she didn't live here.

EDDIE

Pretty.

JORDY

(acts as if he didn't notice)

Hmmmm.

EDDIE

Maybe you don't care about that either.

(beat)

Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

JORDY

Who says she's a suspect?

EDDIE

What would you call her?

JORDY

Look, I'm not even sure she has anything

to do with this.  I saw her outside

after the fire - thought it was a lead.

Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was

visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

EDDIE

Obviously they weren't having sex.  As

you pointed out.  So why go through all

the trouble of putting 'em like that?

JORDY

Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone

trying to send a message.  Burial rites

are taken very seriously in Eastern

Europe.  It could be to humiliate them.

Just burning them up, no proper funeral,

it's like condemning them to hell.

EDDIE

Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania?

Hungary?

JORDY

Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been

fighting the Germans and the Russians

for a thousand years.  These are very

intense people and they take things

personally.

EDDIE

Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife?

Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.

(to Jordy)

We've got another murder - in a hotel on

Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said

the room was rented by a Russian...

JORDY

I'll come with you.

EDDIE

There wasn't a fire.  There'll be

nothing for you to do.

JORDY

I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll

learn something.

EDDIE

This isn't homicide school.

JORDY

My parents are from Poland.  I can help

with the Eastern European angle.

EDDIE

You're Polish?

JORDY

My folks are.

EDDIE

Stay here.

OLEG

This is second day in America.  First

day was very exciting.  Full of thrills

and chills.  Over there, is co-star of

my new movie, Emil!

EMIL

(to vendor)

Who is he?

VENDOR

New York's finest.  This is his case.

VENDOR (CONT'D)

This all you want?

EMIL

Do you know how much killer gets for

movie rights?

VENDOR

(People)

In here, says he wants a million.

EMIL

Million?!  The killer gets one million

dollars for a television interview?

VENDOR

Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous

serial killer - half a million for his

interview.  And how much you think

Monica got for writing book about the

President coming on to her?  It pays to

be a killer or a whore in this country.

Look, you want magazine or not?

EMIL

Yes.  Both.

OLEG

And these.

EMIL

(to Oleg)

Get a taxi.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Let me help.

BLIND WOMAN

Thank you, son.

EDDIE

Where is she?

LEON

Takin' a bath.

EDDIE

Any I.D.?

LEON

Still unknown but we're running prints.

Kid over there caught the case.

LEON (CONT'D)

Sorry...PD only.

EDDIE

It's okay.

TOMMY

Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you.

Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got.

A girl in there, figure her to be a

prostitute, looks like she was fighting

for her life.  She's got defense wounds

on her hands.  Right this way - in the

bathroom.

EDDIE

After you.

TOMMY

Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

JORDY

Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian.

Who said he sounded Russian?

TOMMY

The clerk?

EDDIE

Check the switchboard, see what phone

calls were made from this room.

TOMMY

I'll do it.

MURPHY

Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub

is dry except for the blood.

EDDIE

Any of you guys take a piss lately?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Do the seat for me.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Only one guys checked in?

LEON

Yeah.

EDDIE

C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide

school?  Here - make yourself useful.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Our killer...our killer's standing here

slashing at her.  She's fightin' him.

The blood is splattering this way.  It's

on this wall...

(pointing to the right of

Jordy)

And there's some specks over here.

(to the left of Jordy)

There's nothing here because someone was

standing right here.  Someone big.  And

he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood.

He wouldn't walk out of here like that.

(turning to Murphy)

Murphy, what kind of knife you think

we're talking about here?

MURPHY

If you look here where he missed and hit

the wall you see that the marks aren't

deep but they're kinda wide... not your

everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

EDDIE

What if the tip was broken off?

MURPHY

Could be.  Then we should find it here

somewhere.

EDDIE

I think we've already found it.

TOMMY

There was only one call from this room

last night.  I dialed it.  It's an

escort service.

LEON

Did you identify yourself?

TOMMY

Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.

EDDIE

Call communications and get an address

on that number.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Good work.

JORDY

You goin' to the escort service?

EDDIE

You got any better ideas?

JORDY

Mind if I ride along with you?

EDDIE

This has nothing to do with your fire.

JORDY

But what if it does?  You might need my

help.

MAN

Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for

my son?

EDDIE

I'll let you know what happens.

JORDY

This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in

your way - we can talk the case over.

EDDIE

Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin.

If you win you can come with me.  If you

don't win, you don't come.

JORDY

I'll call it... tails.

EDDIE

Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Heads.  See, you lost twice.

(beat)

Okay.  Get in.

WHIP PAN TO:

EDDIE

Oh here.  A souvenir.

JORDY

Two heads.

EDDIE

Better than one.

ROSE (O.S.)

Who's there?

EDDIE

Police.  We'd like to ask you a few

questions.

ROSE (O.S.)

I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna

contact my attorney...

EDDIE

(commands)

Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective

Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

ROSE

You!  I've seen you on TV!

ROSE (CONT'D)

C'mon in.  C'mon in!

ROSE

Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don't have

a camera.  Hold on a second.

ROSE (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

EDDIE

We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of

your girls was killed last night at the

King Edward Hotel.

ROSE

Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

JORDY

Do you remember the man who called?

ROSE

Yeah.  He wanted a girl from

Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey

'cause once they get there, you know, it

doesn't really matter - Honey was

killed...?  Poor girl...

EDDIE

Do you have any Czech girls working for

you?

ROSE

No.

EDDIE

Did you tell him you did?

ROSE

(Afrikaner)

Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

EDDIE

What are you saying?

ROSE

Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me

about her, too.

JORDY

This her?

ROSE

Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,

gave her my card.  She said she'd think

about it but I never heard from her.

BUTCH GIRL

(Afrikaner)

Beautiful eyes.

EDDIE

Who came by looking for her?

ROSE

He said he was her cousin.  I told him

where she works.  They were just here.

EDDIE

Describe him.

ROSE

Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second

guy with him was...shorter, with a

wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn

his videocamera off me.

EDDIE

He had a videocamera?  Where is she?

Quickly!

ROSE

She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon

on 63rd and Madison.

EDDIE

Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison.

Hair salon.  Ludwig's.

JORDY

(overlapping)

I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's.

63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be

there already.

EDDIE

You thirsty?

JORDY

I'm on duty.

EDDIE

(drinking)

So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and

you cover the back.

JORDY

Of course.

EDDIE

Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I

was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a

door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and

yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy!

What'd you dream about?

JORDY

I wanted to run up to a building on

fire, kick in the door, rush into the

smoke and save a kid.

EDDIE

Then I guess we're doin' this the right

way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a

burning building I'll gladly let you go

first.

OLEG (O.S.)

Daphne Handlova?

RECEPTIONIST

Daphne?  In the back.  Probably

shampooing a customer's hair.

LUDWIG

Why are you messing with your hair color

again?  You're going to kill your hair.

You won't look good with black hair.

DAPHNE

I want to do it, alright?

LUDWIG

Well, then do it after work.  A

customer's waiting.

EMIL

I...I have a temper.

EMIL (CONT'D)

When I lose it, I lose control.  I

didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole

from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to

prison, they beat me.  I still didn't

tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos

like a brother...

EMIL (CONT'D)

(in English)

I'm not a killer.

LUDWIG

Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

DAPHNE

In a minute, Ludwig.

EMIL

Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a

whore.  But washing hair?  This is no

job for a woman as beautiful as you.

They should be washing your hair.

EMIL (CONT'D)

I don't want to kill you.  But if you

talk, I will.

(whispers)

I thought you'd want these.

JORDY

...Daphne?

JORDY (CONT'D)

I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me

from the other night?  You are Daphne,

right?

EDDIE

You don't have to be afraid.  We're here

to protect you.  Come with me.  We want

to talk to you.  You speak English

alright?

EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS

EDDIE

Did he give you these?  Was he just

here?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

The other side of the street.  The guy

with the videocamera.

(back to Jordy)

Don't look - put her in the car.

(to Leon)

Stay this side.

LEON

(back to Tommy)

Stay with her.

EMIL

(Czech)

Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go!

EDDIE

Split up!

OLEG

Emil, look!

OLEG (CONT'D)

Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

EDDIE

Are you hit?

LEON

No.  I'm okay.

JORDY

(to Korfin)

Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

KORFIN

It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

JORDY

Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

LEON

He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming

the whole time!

EDDIE

I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't

worry, we'll get those fuckers.

DISSOLVE TO:

NICOLETTE

Detective - can you tell us what

happened here?

EDDIE

I can't talk right now.  We have some

things to take care of.

NICOLETTE

I understand, but I noticed that the

Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this

somehow related to the fire department?

EDDIE

I really can't give out any information

right now at this point.

NICOLETTE

Okay.  But I do understand that your

partner, Leon Jackson's been injured.

Is that correct?

EDDIE

He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll

be fine.

NICOLETTE

Do you have the suspect in custody?

EDDIE

Um...now is not a good time, okay.

Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine.

I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective

Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

NICOLETTE

(to cameraman)

Alright, cut, cut, cut.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

(to Eddie)

Eddie, are you okay?

EDDIE

Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

NICOLETTE

Alright.

EDDIE

Alright?

NICOLETTE

Alright.

EDDIE

Alright.

NICOLETTE

Okay.

DAPHNE

I told your partner, I can't help.  I

didn't see anything.

EDDIE

C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know

these people?

DAPHNE

Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower

was broken, she let me use theirs.

EDDIE

Go on.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Whether you tell us or not, we'll find

out.  Better if it comes from you.

DAPHNE

If I tell you, will you arrest me?

EDDIE

Arrest you for what?  Why would we

arrest you?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

JORDY

She just saw two of her friends killed!

They probably threatened her.

EDDIE

Is that all there is?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Are you here illegally?  Don't worry

about that.  We'll talk to Immigration.

They won't deport you.

DAPHNE

No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

JORDY

Why not?

EDDIE

Something back home?

DAPHNE

...my little sister and I shared a flat -

I came home one night and a man was

raping her.  His gun was on the chair...

He came at me and I shot him.

JORDY

(optimistic)

Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

DAPHNE

Yes, but he was a cop.

EDDIE

A cop?

DAPHNE

(beat)

I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like

the South here.  The Police is right, a

civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

EDDIE

Look, we can help you but right now we

have to deal with what's happening here.

Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

DAPHNE

You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

JORDY

(to Eddie)

Can I talk to you?

EDDIE

She's fucked.  Even if that story is

true.

JORDY

Raw deal.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I

get, they're all yours.  Just let me

have a first crack at her.

EDDIE

You wanna talk to her alone?

JORDY

Yeah.

EDDIE

What would your girlfriend think of

that?

JORDY

I don't have a girlfriend.

EDDIE

My point exactly.

JORDY

I'm serious here.

EDDIE

So am I.

JORDY

C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're

a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

EDDIE

You're her Savior?  Is she the kid

you're gonna save from the burning

building?

JORDY

You know what I'm saying here.

EDDIE

Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a

head start.  You take her to the station

house.  Don't let her out of your sight.

She's the only warm body we got left.

JORDY

Hey.  I'm a professional.

EDDIE

Women like that have a way of turning

professionals into amateurs.

OLEG

Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's

more moody... like a scene from THE

THIRD MAN.

EMIL

Shut up.

OLEG

Does it hurt?

EMIL

This is nothing.

OLEG

Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

EMIL

Don't want to film this?

DAPHNE

Now I become custody of police

department?

JORDY

If you cooperate with the DA - maybe

they'll help you with your situation.

DAPHNE

I will if they don't send me back.

JORDY

They won't until this is over.

DAPHNE

Are you married?

JORDY

Divorced.

DAPHNE

Do you live alone?

(beat)

I've been in these clothes since...the

killings.  Could we stop at your place?

I could take a shower...before I go into

custody?

JORDY

I can't take you to my place.

DAPHNE

Somewhere else?

EDDIE

I want to talk to you about something

serious.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I want to live the rest of my life with

you...I don't know you've been married

before and I've never been married, but

I do love you, and...

PAULIE

She's here.

NICOLETTE

Hey, honey.

EDDIE

Hey.

NICOLETTE

What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at

me?  I just wanted a statement.

EDDIE

I can't...I can't answer you just

because you want me to answer you!

NICOLETTE

You didn't have to embarrass me in front

of my colleagues.  You could give me

something.

EDDIE

Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you,

sweetheart?  Oh...

NICOLETTE

Stop it.

EDDIE

Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to

the cameras and say, do you mind if we

just work something out?

NICOLETTE

Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't

patronize me.

EDDIE

I'm not.

NICOLETTE

Yes you are.  I'm not just some

reporter.  I don't just stick a

microphone in your face.  You could give

me something.

EDDIE

Yeah, well you took the camera and put

it right down on the evidence.  That

was...

NICOLETTE

That was good.  You were holding the

evidence.

EDDIE

You were merciless.  You didn't give a

shit if you got me or not.

NICOLETTE

Well, who was it that taught me how to

do that?  Huh?

EDDIE

You're ruthless.

NICOLETTE

You're not so bad yourself.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

C'mere.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Look at this.  You have blood on your

shirt.  Whose is it?

EDDIE

Could be Leon's.

NICOLETTE

Jesus.  And last week you came over with

blood on your shoes.  What am I going to

do with you?

EDDIE

You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes

might look nice with another pair of

shoes next to them in the closet.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You know, Nicky, I've been married twice

before.  My first wife was a

professional woman, didn't have time for

children.  My second wife...I never

wanted to go home to her.

NICOLETTE

What are you doing?  What are you

saying?

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Eddie?

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Don't worry about the damn phone.  I

won't answer it.

EDDIE

Answer the phone.

NICOLETTE

No.  Tell me what you want to say.

EDDIE

Answer it.

NICOLETTE

Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for

a second.  They only call me when it's

an emergency.  Just hold that thought.

(into the phone)

Can you call back?

PHONE VOICE (O.S.)

We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get

in a cab.

NICOLETTE

What're you talking about?

PHONE VOICE (O.S.)

Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We

can't find her.  You gotta anchor the

5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

NICOLETTE

What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They

want me to anchor tonight!

EDDIE

That's good.

NICOLETTE

Yeah.

EDDIE

Well, that's great.

NICOLETTE

Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go

now, we're in the middle of something

here.

EDDIE

No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

NICOLETTE

No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to

know what you're talking about.  You

know, the shoe thing and the marriages

and...

EDDIE

I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it

tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll

talk.  We'll talk.

NICOLETTE

Promise?

EDDIE

I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be

great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just

imagine that, uh... Just look into the

lens and imagine you're talking to me.

NICOLETTE

Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're

not patronizing me.

EDDIE

Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

NICOLETTE

I love you.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Okay, til tonight.

EDDIE

Tonight.

NICOLETTE

You promise?

EDDIE

Yeah.  I promise.

NICOLETTE

Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by

my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes

and maybe just test them out next to

yours...How's that... Would that be a

good thing.

EDDIE

Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

NICOLETTE

Okay.

EDDIE

See you later.  Good luck.

NICOLETTE

Thank you.

EDDIE

Don't be late.

JORDY

The men are out of quarters - practicing

putting out fires.

DAPHNE

So...the station is empty?

JORDY

Yeah.  This way.

JORDY

You considered becoming a prostitute?

DAPHNE

Yes, I considered it.

JORDY

Did you ever turn tricks before?

DAPHNE

No.

JORDY

What about back home?

DAPHNE

No.

DAPHNE (CONT'D)

I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no

one.  I couldn't get a job because you

have to have a green card to get work.

They approached me - I could've made a

lot of money.  I considered it, but...

it's not who I am.  They pay me below

the table at Ludwig's.

JORDY

So you were never a prostitute?

DAPHNE

What are you asking me?

JORDY

I'm just trying to find out who you are.

DAPHNE

Can you let me go?

JORDY

Showers are this way.

DAPHNE

You could shower with me.

JORDY

I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Shit!

JORDY (CONT'D)

Are you alright?

DAPHNE

I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

JORDY

I know.

DAPHNE

You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was

desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a

cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to

me when I got to prison?

JORDY

They're not gonna send you right back.

DAPHNE

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad.

Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this

time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look

anyone in the eyes.

Always afraid that someone would find

out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

JORDY

You can trust me.

INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY

OLEG

What is it?

EMIL

The video of Milos and Tamina - I told

you to erase it.

OLEG

I did.

EMIL

And the whore's murder?  You didn't

erase that either, did you?  Don't lie,

I won't be angry.

OLEG

Why not?

EMIL

Put the camera down, Oleg.

OLEG

What is that?

EMIL

What does it look like?  It's an address

book!

OLEG

Let me get a shot of it.

EMIL

Sit down!

OLEG

This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

OLEG (CONT'D)

Why won't you be angry at me for keeping

my movie?

DUFFY

Hey.  Warsaw.

JORDY

Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

DUFFY

I came to see how the investigation was

going.

(looks at Daphne)

I called and you're not here.  I wait up

at the station and you don't even show

up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my

call.  Where the hell have you been?!

JORDY

Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training.

We stopped there... so she could get

cleaned up.

DUFFY

What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

JORDY

I let her take a shower.

DUFFY

A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

JORDY

No!  Nothing happened.

DUFFY

Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a

homicide witness to take a shower after

your partner was shot?  Are you out of

your fucking mind??  Are you having that

much trouble gettin' dates?!

EDDIE (O.S.)

I told him to take her there.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Tommy, get her outta here.

TOMMY

This way, ma'am.

EDDIE

There was too much press hangin' around

there.  I didn't want her face on the

news.  So I told him to take her to a

quiet area until things settled down.

DUFFY

Oh.

EDDIE

It was my decision, not his.

DUFFY

Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall

and every now and then I'd like to be

included in decisions.

EDDIE

Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do

the press conference.  How about that?

The case is all yours.

DUFFY

Oh yeah...?  Alright.

EDDIE

(to Jordy)

I'm ready to be briefed.

(to Duffy)

Excuse us.

DUFFY

(to Eddie)

Yeah, sure.

(to Jordy)

Beep me when you're ready for the press

conference.

JORDY

Will do, Chief.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Eddie, I...

EDDIE

Wait.

EDDIE

Guys...give me a few minutes?

JORDY

Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't

touch her.

EDDIE

Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna

believe you didn't...including me.

JORDY

I took her there for a shower and that's

it.

EDDIE

Just a shower?

JORDY

Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing

happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably

think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

EDDIE

No, I don't think you were a fool, I

just think you were stupid about it.  I

mean, to say the least, you outta know

better.  You don't know her well enough.

She's got the potential to fucking hang

you even if she suggests that you made a

pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can

deny it all you want, but it will not

make one fucking bit of difference.

You're dead.

JORDY

I told you, you know, I thought I was

doing the right thing, you know, I think

she's innocent.

EDDIE

Well, it's not up to you to decide

whether she's innocent or not.  Don't

you understand, that's why you're a

professional.

JORDY

But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a

limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda

heard her there.  Tellin' her whole

story...I believed her.

EDDIE

How you go out on a limb for somebody is

by giving her a number of an Immigration

lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an

Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help

her.

But you can't get involved in her like

that.  You're gonna jeopardize your

career, your life and you're gonna

jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you

another piece of advice.  Maybe you

don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a

little secret - the whole fuckin' world

watches television.  And when you get

out there, they know your face.  And the

little fame, the little fuckin' itty

bitty fame that I get in this city makes

it a lot easier for my job.  And I get

more done because of it.

JORDY

Why'd you help me back there with the

Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like

that?

EDDIE

You know, I don't know.  I like you.

You remind me of a puppy I used to have.

He pissed on the rug all the time, but I

still kept him.

EDDIE

It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did

they check the hospitals?  Airports?

Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We

should be all over everywhere - with

dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys

are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I'll call you later.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Coming!

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Nicky!?!?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Nicky?!

EMIL

So...who's Nicky?

EDDIE

What do you want?

EMIL

Your opinion.

(leaning forward)

You see, they going to make a movie

about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

EDDIE

(sarcastic)

What's your accomplishment.

EMIL

I kill someone famous.

EDDIE

Then do it, asshole.

EMIL

Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who

plays you will want to die like hero.

EMIL (CONT'D)

So tabloids don't have to do re

enactments.  They going to have real

movie this time.

EDDIE

If you kill me and film it you're

putting a noose around your neck.

EMIL

Turn it off.

EMIL (CONT'D)

No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy

men would film their murders?

(gestures to Eddie)

So we kill someone famous and if we are

caught, we are sent to mental hospital.

But what good is money there?  Because

once in hospital I say I not crazy.

Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see

psychiatrists.  They must certify we are

sane and because of your - what is law

called?

(Eddie says nothing)

Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double

Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same

crime twice.  We come out free, rich and

famous!

OLEG

Good idea!

EDDIE

You really think you'll be able to fool

a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'

stupid are you?

EMIL

Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry

baby talk shows all day long.  Not only

will Americans believe me, they'll cry

for me.

(laughs)

So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you

like to say goodbye to your Nicolette?

Maybe you can propose to her now?

EMIL (CONT'D)

Okay.  He has nothing to say.

(signaling Oleg)

Start the camera!

OLEG

Cut!

OLEG (CONT'D)

This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I

am the director!  You are the talent.

You wait for me to say 'action!'

OLEG (CONT'D)

And...action!

EMIL

Bad last moment - I cut that out.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Die.  Die.

NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)

..Detective Flemming was one of the most

decorated NYPD detectives in the history

of New York.  He made several thousand

arrests during his career, including the

famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by

the community in which he served.  His

partner eulogized him...

LEON (ON T.V.)

...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend

and my partner...he taught me the

meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man

in every sense of the word.  I'll miss

him...

(choking on tears)

Sleep well, brother.

HAWKINS

Awful...what an awful day.  He was New

York City.

TOMMY

I never got to tell him how much I

admired him.

HAWKINS

I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

NICOLETTE

You know...you know he was gonna propose

to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd

written out to me.  And a ring

box...these fuckers that killed him -

have my ring.  They have my diamond

engagement ring...

HAWKINS

I know.

NICOLETTE

What do you mean you know?  He told you

he was gonna propose to me?

HAWKINS

Well, he...

NICOLETTE

(overriding)

I want to hear everything he said.

HAWKINS

I'm trying to tell you.

NICOLETTE

Alright.  Go ahead.

HAWKINS

That morning.  He was talking to me and

Leon about marriage.

NICOLETTE

Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here.

He started making overtures - talking

about little shoes next to his in his

closet but I got a call to anchor - and

I walked out on him.  I walked out on

him when he was trying to ask me to

marry him!!

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

I'd never had a great relationship

before.  I'd never made great choices

with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to

know.  He was older, my parents told me

I was nuts to get involved with him.

But he was so great to me.  Always

encouraging, telling me I could do

anything...

(beat)

He was the one.  You know, I'd give up

everything - everything - for just a

little more time.  I would've spent

fifteen minutes with him if that's all I

knew I had.

MAGGIE

Robert...?

HAWKINS

What are you doing here?

MAGGIE

(holding a cellular)

You've got a call.

HAWKINS

I can't talk to anybody right now, can't

you see I'm busy!  I can't talk

business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.

(to Paulie)

Get her a whiskey.

MAGGIE

Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

HAWKINS

Hello?  Who is this?

(listens)

How do I know this is you?

HAWKINS (CONT'D)

Where?

EMIL

Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the

Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my

next film.

HAWKINS

(low)

Look asshole.  I've been threatened by

better than you.

EMIL

No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened

you.

HAWKINS

I'll meet you on one condition - I get

exclusivity and you surrender to me.

EMIL

We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock

gives you time to go to bank.  Three

hundred thousand dollars.

HAWKINS

What?  It doesn't work that way.

EMIL

(incensed)

If you don't want my film - I'll call

another show.  And they will show it.

HAWKINS

Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

EMIL

Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk

about surrendering.

KORFIN

How was it?

JORDY

(numb)

Not good.

DUFFY

(nods to Daphne)

Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

KORFIN

Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

DUFFY

(to Korfin)

Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let

her pick up her clothes and take her

straight to Hoover Street.  You got

that?

KORFIN

Yeah.

JORDY

Chief - mind if I take her?

DUFFY

Okay.  But not water sports.

MAN

Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

JORDY

Yeah.

MAN

(shoving papers in Jordy's

hand)

Consider yourself served.

KORFIN

Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the

department and the city of New York for

10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?

JORDY

The mugger.

EXT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

DAPHNE

Are you alright?

JORDY

I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

DAPHNE

I'm sorry.

DAPHNE (CONT'D)

(in Czech to the man)

Hello.  How are you?

JORDY

What's this?

JORDY (CONT'D)

Is he your boyfriend?

DAPHNE

Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

JORDY

If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

DAPHNE

If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest

you find another girlfriend that isn't

going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

JORDY

A good Immigration lawyer could stall

the process.  Eddie recommended one.

DAPHNE

No matter what happens...I'm glad I met

you.

JORDY

I'm glad I met you.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Let's get your stuff.

JORDY

You better get packed.

DAPHNE

Right.

JORDY

Do you have coffee?

DAPHNE

In the kitchen.

JORDY

I'll make some for us.

DAPHNE

I'll get my clothes.

DAPHNE (CONT'D)

Jordy!!!

JORDY

No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

DAPHNE

That's not mine!

JORDY

Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!

JORDY (CONT'D)

This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,

make it quick, we're trapped!  8th

Avenue and 44th Street.

DAPHNE

Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

DAPHNE (CONT'D)

They were here!

JORDY

Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get

down!

JORDY (CONT'D)

Oh Jesus!

JORDY (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

DAPHNE

Pouring it out!

DAPHNE (CONT'D)

Oh shit!

OLEG

This is great film!  You can see fire

right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire

Marshal is here.  Everything is so

messy.  Everything is so crazy right

here!  Look at this fire!  We made it!

90% of people who die in fire die from

eating smoke.  So most likely they all

die from eating smoke.

OLEG (CONT'D)

And this is the man who started the

fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

JORDY

Get back!  Get out of the bathroom!

Run!

7-YEAR OLD KID

The hallway is on fire!

JORDY

It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to

help you.  Get back!  Now!

GARCIA

Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

KORFIN

Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the

hand!

JORDY

Where's Daphne?  Daphne?

VOICE

Isn't she a beauty?  She's my fire, look

at that loom-up on her!

MAX

I did this!  I did this!  Take my

picture!  I'm Max!  Max Gornick!

JORDY

Get outta here!

KORFIN

What the hell happened?

JORDY

They were inside.  They booby trapped

her apartment!

DUFFY

What the hell are you talking about???

They're gonna do what?

TOMMY

Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

MAGGIE

He's not on the premises!

LEON

I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it

here this minute.

MAGGIE

Any request for the video must be

directed to "Top Story's" attorney -

Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you

his number.

LEON

Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,

I'll get a warrant for your arrest and

shove it so far up your ass it'll come

outta your mouth!

MAGGIE

I want your shield number!

HAWKINS (O.S.)

Viewer discretion advised!

MAGGIE

(pointing at the TV)

You want the tape?  There it is!

HAWKINS

What we are about to broadcast is very

graphic footage...

EMIL

America!  Who says you can't be success

in America?  I arrived with nothing,

knowing nobody - now look - I am a

success story!

OLEG

You are success story?  I am success

story!  Why do you say I and not we?

EMIL

Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a

hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't

you?  I gave you half of what they gave

me.  Look - here we are!

HAWKINS (ON T.V.)

Good evening.  Welcome to "Top Story".

Tonight, I present to you material of a

graphic and violent nature never before

seen on television.  And I do so with a

heavy heart.  You will be first-hand

witness to the slaying of celebrated New

York City Homicide Detective, Eddie

Flemming.  It would be only normal to

ask, why?  Why are we showing something

so journalist, I must show it.  A

democracy survives through the freedom

of its media, and if we cannot see what

is happening then we don't deserve our

democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie

Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I

watched this footage and vowed to fight

this violence with every molecule of my

being from this day onward.  Hopefully,

this will have a similar effect on you.

One final word, this material is

absolutely not appropriate for children.

OLEG

In movie they make of us, who do you

think would act me?

EMIL

The one who got caught in the bathroom.

(beat)

George Michael.

OLEG

I'm serious.

EMIL

Shut up.  Look!

OLEG (O.S.)

This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I

am the director!  You are the talent.

You wait for me to say 'action.'

(beat)

And 'action!'

EMIL

Bad last moment - I cut it out.

EMIL (CONT'D)

I told you to cut that out before we

handed in the tape!

OLEG

Be quiet.  Watch.

EMIL

Die.  Die.

EMIL

Why did you leave that stuff in about

you being the director?

OLEG

Because I am the director.  Don't you

realize, if it wasn't for my film, for

my talent, my idea to do this - no way

would we be sitting here right now.

EMIL

Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Aren't you just the cameraman?

OLEG

I'm serious...this - this is a great

American film.  Full of violence and

sex.  And I want my credit.

EMIL

Credit?

OLEG

Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -

I put titles on it and my credit is

going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

EMIL

Yes.  But there's only one problem - you

want credit but the problem is - I don't

share credit.

EMIL (CONT'D)

You got that?

OLEG

No, I don't get that!

EMIL

You think you are a director?  You are a

fucking little, small Russian piece of

shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate

you.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Oh, hello.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Are you my attorney?

(extends his hand to Cutler)

I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

CUTLER

I'm not your lawyer until I see the

money.

EMIL

Here.  I have your money.

EMIL (CONT'D)

Oh no!  No!  Shit!

CUTLER

(follows Emil - reaching out to

him)

Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit

down.  What do you need?  What are you

looking for?

EMIL

He has the camera!  He took the movie!

JORDY

Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands

up!  Drop it!

EMIL

I give up!

CUTLER

This man is unarmed, officer.  He's

surrendered.

CUTLER (CONT'D)

What are you hitting him for?

JORDY

Turn that camera off!

EMIL

No.  Keep filming...

CUTLER

(to Emil)

Don't say anything.

EMIL

Where are we going?

CUTLER

I'm coming with you.

EMIL

Yes.  Yes, come with me!

CUTLER

(to Jordy)

I'm invoking rights - this man is

represented by counsel.  I'm coming with

him.

JORDY

Turn that camera off!

LEON

I'll take him.

JORDY

No way!  He's mine!

LEON

(holding on to Emil, squeezing

his arm hard)

We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

JORDY

He's my collar!

LEON

Well, he killed my partner!

JORDY

He's yours but I take him in!  I'll

drive him to the precinct, you can have

him but I'm walkin' him in.

LEON

Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll

follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

LEON (CONT'D)

You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are

goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile

when they put you down!

CUTLER

Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his

taunting!

(to Leon)

He's represented by counsel.  You want

to speak to someone - you speak to me!

TOMMY

Out of the way, counselor.

CUTLER

Don't you put your hands on me,

Detective.

LEON

And you, you'll pay for what you did!

HAWKINS

(low)

This footage will work in your favor.

When the jury sees this - no matter what

Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

LEON

You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of

yourself.

HAWKINS

If I didn't put it on somebody else

would!  I was his friend!

LEON

Don't give me that fucking shit.

MURPHY

Don't get into it on TV.

LEON

(yells to other cop cars)

Alright, let's get going!

TOMMY

What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose

everybody!

TOMMY (CONT'D)

Where are you goin'??  This ain't the

way to the station!

TOMMY

Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can't do

this.  This isn't the way to do things.

JORDY

Were you a fireman?  That how you knew

how to rig the apartment?

EMIL

My father was.  He gave me many lessons

about fire.  Now it's my friend.

JORDY

Tommy, take a walk.

TOMMY

What are you gonna do?

JORDY

Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna

get caught!  That's why he videotaped

Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna

get off.

TOMMY

Don't stoop to his level!

JORDY

Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

TOMMY

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

JORDY

(erupting)

GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR

AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL

KILL YOU, TOO!!!

JORDY (CONT'D)

Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

JORDY (CONT'D)

You wanna be a real American?  Go for

your gun.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Pull the gun!  You want to be famous?

Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and

make more money.

EMIL

You can't kill me.  You're not a cop.

Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you

never shot anybody in your life.

JORDY

You'll be my first.

EMIL

C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,

look, you're sweating.  You don't have

the balls.

JORDY

Get down on your knees.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Where's your partner?

EMIL

The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210.

Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

LEON

Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him

dead but you can't do it this way.

INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

JORDY

Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this

Who's there?

WAITER

(nervous)

R-room service.

HOOKER

Come in.

OLEG

Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless.

No cuts.

(excited)

And look.  Look at that transition.

That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?!

Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

Shit!

REPORTER (ON T.V.)

...and the wild chase through Times

Square ended with the suspect, Oleg

Razgul, escaping.  The fire department

has identified the fire marshal involved

in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)

In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's

attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for

handling sensational cases - claims his

client is unfit to stand trial.

PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)

In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was

not the alleged mastermind behind the

murders.

According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was

being directed by his partner, who

threatened to kill him if he didn't

follow Mr. Razgul's orders.  Cutler told

reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in

fact stab his client.

CUTLER

My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim.

What's happened is not his fault.  Emil

was under the influence of his partner.

At the trial, you'll see that my client

will be vindicated...

CUTLER

I brought you some letters.  It's really

fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to

buy you clothes, another sent a check.

Another wants a check.

EMIL

You bring the cigarettes?

CUTLER

Oh, sure.

CUTLER (CONT'D)

How're they treating you, alright

(Emil is nonresponsive)

I want to get the cuffs off... but

there's a little bit of a problem.

Things out there are very negative right

now for us.  We gotta change that

around.  Perception is very, very

important.  Perception is reality.  I

know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's

important that I get that message out.

Cause that's our only defense in this

case.

CUTLER (CONT'D)

I want you to focus on three things:

fear...

CUTLER (CONT'D)

...delusions and paranoia.

EMIL

I was all of these.

CUTLER

Well, you didn't appreciate the severity

of it until recently.  No question about

that.

EMIL

What about Oleg?

CUTLER

Disappeared.  They're looking

everywhere.  Maybe he went back to

Czechoslovakia.

EMIL

No, he is here.  Shit...

CUTLER

Don't worry about him.  Think about

yourself.

EMIL

What about my movie rights?  Book

rights?

CUTLER

Look, I haven't really focused on that

kind of thing.

EMIL

What's your cut?  How much?

CUTLER

I would say...half.  Half is fair.

EMIL

(laughs)

No.  No way.

CUTLER

But it's...

EMIL

Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call

another lawyer.  This is the biggest

case of your life.  Don't try to

negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or

no.

CUTLER

This is not about money, Emil.  I need

your trust in me.

EMIL

What else do you need?

CUTLER

I need to know about your background.  I

need to know about your upbringing.  Why

you're here.

EMIL

(indicating cigarette)

Give me another one, please.

CUTLER

Tell me about yourself.  What you did as

a young boy... what your parents were

like.

EMIL

My father always degraded me.  Killed my

self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

CUTLER

Your mother was blind?

EMIL

Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me.

She went to fucking black market doctor

to induce me.

CUTLER

Back in the Czech Republic?

EMIL

Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad

drugs which made her go blind.  And my

father blamed me for her blindness...

CUTLER

Your father blamed you for your mother's

blindness?

EMIL

Yeah, he hated me from day when I was

born.  Put it out.  Can you put the

cigarette out?

EMIL (CONT'D)

That's what he did to me.  He put

cigarettes out on me.

CUTLER

Your father put cigarettes out on you?

EMIL

Out on my back when I was a small boy.

CUTLER

Can I see your back?

CUTLER (CONT'D)

Oh, Jesus.

EMIL

I'm abused.  Don't you think?

CUTLER

I don't think it's abuse, I think it's

torture.

DUFFY

The public doesn't have any idea what we

do and now you're going to define our

image!  This is going to be our Rodney

King!

JORDY

What was I supposed to do?  The guy

tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop

back - I just forgot.

DUFFY

Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a

tree?!

JORDY

Chief - I know I screwed up - but this

guy was no innocent civilian.

DUFFY

Well this is gonna end your career and

probably mine.

JORDY

End my career?

DUFFY

How are you going to fight this?  Maybe

if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd

been on the front page, as a hero, this

thing would be easier to fight.  You'd

have the good to weight against the bad!

It's unfortunate that I have to make

decisions based upon your press coverage

but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme

your shield.

JORDY

But Chief?  Over this??

DUFFY

There's nothing to talk about.  Get a

good lawyer.  You're suspended until

your trial.

DUFFY (CONT'D)

(pats Jordy's shoulder)

I know you got backup at home.  Drop it

off.

STERN

(to Jordy)

Look, what don't you understand?  We've

got a good relationship with the Czech's

and the State Department doesn't want to

cause an incident.

JORDY

But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

STERN

They've got her testimony on videotape.

And even if they do take her to court

immediately after she'll be extradited.

The Czechs want her back.  She shot a

cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil

Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech

Republic?  How would you feel if the

Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!

STERN (CONT'D)

And just between us...I was married to a

redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are

like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from

both.

STERN (CONT'D)

You want to see her - go ahead.

JORDY

We're gonna fight the extradition.

DAPHNE

Forget about me.  You have enough

problems of your own.

JORDY

...Do you really want me to forget about

you?

DAPHNE

I don't want to drag you down with me.

JORDY

Daphne, I...

DAPHNE

Shhhh.

NICOLETTE

...and today with his partner who he

blamed for the crimes still at large,

Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His

lawyer will argue that he is mentally

unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News

has also learned that later this month,

Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing

in court.  He will be arraigned on

charges of violating the civil rights

of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

MIKE

Zwangendaba.

NICOLETTE

Goddamn assholes everywhere.

Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it.

I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again.

5-4-3-2-1...

NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)

Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct

descendent of the African King from whom

he takes his name...

JORDY

Hello?

(listens)

No comment.

JORDY (CONT'D)

Hello?

(listens)

No!

HAWKINS (ON T.V.)

He robbed you?

ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)

That's right, I encountered him right

here.  I was just askin' for change an'

he whips out his big gun an' pushes me

up against that tree, whereupon he takes

my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'

me there all exposed...

REPORTER

...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak

won't have to worry about how he is

going to pay for his defense.  He has

received movie offers and been in

conversations with numerous publishers

concerning the rights to his life story.

TAXI DRIVER

I can't believe this guy got off.

Unbelievable.

JORDY

Whatever's leftover, keep.

HAWKINS

He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he

comes through the crowd.  Do you hear

me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

CUTLER

...my client was suffering from a major

illness of schizophrenic nature wherein

during times of intense stress, as a

result of paranoid and psychotic

delusions - there was impairment of his

ability to appreciate wrongfullness...

This is a victory for the mentally ill!

CUTLER (CONT'D)

...before Emil boards the police boat

and heads for Rykers Island where he

will be checked into the psyche ward, I

want to say one last word to you all...

As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg

Razgul into committing these murders,

yet Oleg is still out in the street, a

free man, filming gruesome murders... My

client and I hope he is brought to

justice in the near future.

HAWKINS

Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

JORDY

You think this is funny??  What the hell

are you laughing at?

CUTLER

(to a nearby escort)

Officer, keep this man back, he's

assaulted my client on previous

occasions.

JORDY

This is it?  This bastard kills the best

cop this city ever had and we do

nothing?

CUTLER

You may not like it marshal, but that's

the law.

JORDY

And what about the other victims??  What

about their families?  He'll end up in

some country club nuthouse while his

lawyer sells his rights to the movies

and we just stand here and do nothing?

We let this scumbag walk?

EMIL

Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm

insane.

HAWKINS

I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where

is it?  Where is the tape?

OLEG

It's all in here.  All in here.

HAWKINS

Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some

interesting evidence, something you

should look at!

HAWKINS (CONT'D)

I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL

UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,

proving Emil Slovak was not insane!

Hard to believe...watch!

OLEG (ON VIDEO)

He knew exactly what he was doing - all

of this was planned!  It's all here in

my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look.

Look!

EMIL (ON VIDEO)

...so we kill someone famous and if we

are caught, we are sent to mental

hospital...

CUTLER

(points to Oleg)

Officers, there's your killer, do your

duty, arrest him!

EMIL

Traitor!!

OLEG

No.  You are the traitor.  You are

murderer.  I am director.  Action!

CAPTAIN

Drop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!

EMIL

I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back

away from me!

JORDY

Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

CAPTAIN

No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do

not fire!  No officer will fire his

weapon unless I say so!

(to Emil)

Let the woman go!

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That

is an order!  No officers will fire!

EMIL

Tell him to put his gun down!

JORDY

Let her go!  Let her go!!

EMIL

If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking

kill her.

JORDY

Let her go.

NICOLETTE

Shoot!  Shoot him!!

EMIL

Shut up!

CAPTAIN

No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer

will follow.  No officer will shoot!

NICOLETTE

Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

EMIL

Shut up!

EMIL (CONT'D)

I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he

lowers his gun.

NICOLETTE

Don't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot

him!

JORDY

Let her go.  Let her go.

CAPTAIN

Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower

your weapon!

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

I told you not to shoot!  No officers

should shoot.

JORDY

I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.

HAWKINS

He's still alive.

OLEG

A film...by Oleg Razgul.

OLEG (CONT'D)

How was that?

NICOLETTE

Wait a minute.  Where are you going?

Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of

public opinion.  Take the credit, you

need it.

JORDY

No thanks.

NICOLETTE

Cut.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to

me.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you

saw it.

NICOLETTE (CONT'D)

New York City has a new hero, Fire

Marshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire

Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this

afternoon will help with his other legal

problems.  WB11 has also learned that

the fire Marshal has retained an

immigration lawyer to help Daphne

Handlova with her case.  We wish her

well.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at

Battery Park, WB11 New York.  Good

night.

FADES TO BLACK.
