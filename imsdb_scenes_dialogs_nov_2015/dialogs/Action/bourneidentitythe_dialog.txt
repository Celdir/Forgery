PARIS DRAFT 9/20/00

SAILOR #1

-- Jesus, look at him --

SAILOR #2

-- what? -- you never saw a dead man

before? --

SAILOR #3

-- look, look he was shot --

(nudging the body --)

SAILOR #1

-- don't, don't do that --

SAILOR #2

-- he's dead, you think he cares? --

SAILOR #1

-- so have some respect -- it's a --

(stopping as --)

GIANCARLO

-- it's here -- hang on -- it's here

somewhere -- give me a minute -- get

some blankets -- get some blankets

on him --

(finding the kit --)

-- here we go -- here it is --

THE CAPTAIN

Giancarlo.

(Giancarlo turns back --)

We pick him up? Okay, we have to

pick him up. But that's as far as it

goes.

GIANCARLO

He needs a doctor.

CAPTAIN

Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't

care. We've wasted two hours on this

shit already. You do what you can,

but we're not going back.

(pure steel now)

You understand me?

GIANCARLO

Yes, sir.

CAPTAIN

(to the rest of them)

Let's get back to work!

GIANCARLO

You're awake. Can you hear me?

(we're blinking --)

You've been shot. I'm trying to help

you.

(we're trying to find

our voice --)

You were in the water. You've been

shot. It's okay now.

THE MAN

Where am I?

GIANCARLO

(switching to English)

You're American. I thought so. From

your teeth -- the dental work --

THE MAN

Where am I?

GIANCARLO

You're on a boat. A fishing boat.

Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.

(he smiles)

It's the cold that saved you. The

water. The wounds are clean. I'm not

a doctor, but the wounds, it looks

okay. It's clean.

THE MAN

How did I get here?

GIANCARLO

You we're lost at sea. They pulled

you out.

(we say nothing)

Who are you?

(still nothing)

You were shot -- two bullets -- in

the back. You understand me?

(we try to nod)

Who are you?

THE MAN

I don't know.

THE MAN

What if it doesn't come back?

GIANCARLO

(still working that

tube)

I told you. You need to rest.

THE MAN

I can read. I can read that sign on

the door. I can count. I can talk...

(focusing now --)

What are you doing?

THE MAN

What is that?

GIANCARLO

It came from your hip. Under the

skin.

(turning back --)

You have a bank in Zurich.

(waiting)

You remember Zurich?

THE MAN

No.

GIANCARLO

Look, I'm just on this boat, okay?

I'm an engineer. Whatever this is,

it's not for me to be involved, okay?

THE MAN

I don't remember Zurich.

GIANCARLO

(offering the bottle --)

You drink rum?

THE MAN

I don't know.

THE MAN

(in perfect French)

I don't know who I am. Do you know

who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

THE MAN

(in perfect Dutch)

Tell me who I am. If you know who I

am, please stop fucking around and

tell me.

GIANCARLO

(offering the money)

It's not much, but it should get you

to Switzerland.

THE MAN

I won't forget this.

TICKET AGENT

Una sola via?

THE MAN

Si. One way. Una sola via.

WOMBOSI

(he speaks english)

...no, no, no -- the time is not

right, my enemies are too strong.

I'm telling you to wait for this,

you understand? I'm telling you this,

and I'm making a warning to all those

peoples out there that think that my

powers have become so weak that they

can play with me as they wish. You

will see -- I will tell you when the

evidence is clear. Then you will

have a story. My old friends will

hear about themselves.

(stopping, freezing

on that image, and --)

MARSHALL

That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in

Paris the day before yesterday. I'm

sure most of you have a passing

knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of

you on the African desks have worked

with him over the years. Some of you

very closely...

MARSHALL

...He was an irritation before he

took power. He was a problem when he

was in power. And he's been a disaster

for us in exile.

(the tape --)

Wombosi likes to send us messages

through the European media. This is

an interview we pulled down from a

local German television station in

Dresden. We've been getting these

little broadsides every couple of

months. He knows this -- he knows

that -- he's writing a book about

the Agency's history in Africa --

he's going to name names. It's

basically a shakedown...

MARSHALL

This interview -- and I'll make the

tape available for anyone who wants

it -- he goes on to claim that he

has just survived an assassination

attempt. He says it's us. He says

he's got proof.

(beat)

The overwhelming negative

ramifications of this should be

obvious.

(hard and dry)

The Director wants to know if there

is any possible shred of truth in

this accusation.

ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)

(authority German)

Can't you read the signs?

ZURICH COP #2

On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

ZURICH COP #1

The park is closed. There's no

sleeping in the park.

ZURICH COP #2

Let's see some identification.

ZURICH COP #1

Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

THE MAN

I've lost them. I've...

(German now)

My papers. They are lost.

ZURICH COP #1

(not sympathetic)

Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

ZURICH COP #2

(pulling his nightstick)

-- come on -- hands up -- up --

THE MAN

-- look, I'm just trying to sleep

okay? --

(German again)

-- I just need to sleep --

ZURICH COP #2

(gasping, pleading)

-- no -- please God no -- please

don't -- please no -- my Go

CONKLIN

(looking up)

What?

ZORN

Abbott wants to talk.

CONKLIN

Tell him we're busy.

ZORN

I tried.

ABBOTT

Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It

looks like rain and I don't have a

thing to wear.

CONKLIN

I don't know what we're talking about.

ABBOTT

We're talking about Marseille. We're

talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And

I'm asking you if this abortion in

Marseille has anything to do with

Treadstone.

(silence)

Was this Treadstone?

CONKLIN

You're asking me a direct question?

ABBOTT

Yes.

CONKLIN

I thought you were never going to do

that.

ABBOTT

They're putting together an agency

oversight committee. They're going

to look through everyone's budgets.

Treadstone is a rather sizable line

item in my ledger.

(beat)

What am I going to do about that?

CONKLIN

You'd want to make that go away.

You'd want to remind them that

Treadstone is a training organization.

That it's all theoretical. You'd

want to sign off on that.

ABBOTT

And what if I couldn't do that?

CONKLIN

Then I'd have to explain Treadstone.

And you'd have to explain how you

let me get this far.

(silence)

Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B,

does it?

(Abbott staring)

We'll clean up the field. You clean

up your budgets.

RECEPTIONIST

Can I help you?

THE MAN

I'm here about a numbered account.

RECEPTIONIST

(instant English)

If you'll just enter your account

number here I'll direct you to the

appropriate officer.

BANK GUARD #1

They've been waiting your hand, sir...

APFEL

Good morning, sir. I assume you're

here about your box.

THE MAN

...yes...

(what now?)

The box.

BOURNE

My name is Jason Bourne.

(sounds good)

Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason

Bourne, nice to meet you.

BOURNE

Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I

live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

BOURNE

I'm trying to think how long it's

been since I was here.

DEPOSIT GUARD

I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.

MARIE (O.S.)

-- no, this is not my current address.

It was my current address two days

ago when I started standing in line

outside --

MARIE

-- and so now I lost my apartment, I

have no address, and I have no visa,

and you keep telling me how much

help you cannot give me!

CLERK

Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna

have to ask you to keep your voice

down.

MARIE

All the papers -- all the papers

they asked for -- I brought all the

papers --

CLERK

Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you

entered into a fraudulent marriage

in an effort to circumvent the

immigration laws of the United States --

MARIE

You only know that because I told

you!

(she's incredulous)

Ask the case officer -- find his

name -- it's on the papers -- I told

him all this myself! --

(tearing through the

papers now --)

CLERK

-- it's not the source of the

information that's important here --

MARIE

-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid

him four thousand dollars -- my last

four thousand dollars to marry me,

okay? -- I told this to the case

officer last week...

(she's found it --)

...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.

Thomas I didn't know this guy was

already married -- I admitted this!

CLERK

-- Miss Kreutz, please --

MARIE

-- I'm the one that got ripped off! --

not you -- not the United States

government -- me -- I'm the one being

ripped off!

CLERK

So now you're asking for a student

visa?

CONKLIN

-- and they're sure it's him? --

ZORN

-- he accessed the account --

CONKLIN

-- but it was him --

ZORN

-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --

MAN ON LINE (O.S.)

(from behind him)

You're up.

WOMAN CLERK

(cold shit)

You're a U.S. Citizen?

BOURNE

Yes.

(pause)

I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

WOMAN CLERK

Well, either you are, or you aren't.

BOURNE

Right.

WOMAN CLERK

You have your passport?

BOURNE

I have a passport. I've got...

(the bag there, but...)

Actually, it's a little complicated.

WOMAN CLERK

Do you have your passport, sir?

BOURNE

Look, maybe I should just...

WOMAN CLERK

Sir, you waited on line.

BOURNE

Yeah, I know...

SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)

-- stop! -- stop right there! --

SECURITY CHIEF

(from across the lobby)

-- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag --

stop right there! -- hands up! --

GUN MARINE

-- you heard him -- let's move it! --

down -- let's go! --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- no -- no -- hold your fire! --

SOMEONE SCREAMING

-- he's got a gun! -- he's got a

gun! --

THE SECURITY CHIEF

(frantic on his radio

now --)

-- red! -- red! -- red! -- code red! --

South side entrance! -- male -- five-

ten, brown hair -- black jacket --

red bag --

BUREAUCRAT #1

Excuse me?  Can I help you?

(but backing up as he

says it, because --)

DEPUTY DCM

-- what're you talking about? --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- we're evacuating the building --

DEPUTY DCM

-- we're in the middle of a trade

meeting! --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- call the code! -- I want everyone

out! --

DEPUTY DCM

-- you gotta give me more to go on --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- he's running from the cops, he's

got a bag filled with God knows what,

he's in the building and I don't

know where! --

VOICE (O.S.)

-- no! -- the other way! -- take the

backstairs! -- the backstairs! --

he's on the other side -- there's a

bomb! --

LEAD MARINE

-- HALT! -- STOP WHERE YOU ARE! --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- blow it -- shoot it open! --

SECURITY CHIEF

-- check the closets! -- get those

back doors covered -- there's a

kitchen back there -- go! -- go! --

go!

SECURITY

-- we're gonna go room by room until

we find him -- so let's get teamed

up --

MARIE

(German)

Motherfucking sonsofbitches!

(a new problem --)

MARIE

(looking up --)

What are you looking at?

BOURNE

I need a ride.

MARIE

What?

BOURNE

I need a ride out of here.

MARIE

Oh, Jesus...

(backing away and --)

BOURNE

Please. I don't want to scare you.

MARIE

It's a little late for that.

BOURNE

I've got a situation here and --

MARIE

Get the fuck away from my car.

BOURNE

I'll give you ten thousand dollars

to drive me to Paris.

MARIE

Great. You know what? I'll give you

ten gazillion dollars to get the

fuck away from me before I start

screaming my head off.

BOURNE

You don't want the police any more

than I do.

MARIE

Jesus...

BOURNE

Get me out of here. Please.

CONKLIN

go -- keep going -- go...wait --

stop -- you went past it --

CONKLIN

(staring at the monitor)

It's him. My God, it's really him...

COM TECH #2

-- we got a cross-ref ready to go

here, sir, we're running hotel,

airline, train, and medical variables,

anything else you'd like?

CONKLIN

No...

(still staring at

Bourne)

Go ahead. Run it.

(coming to --)

Let's get a map, let's get a grid

map on Zurich.

ZORN

(holding the phone)

Sir...

CONKLIN

What?

ZORN

Zurich police are looking for an

American with a red bag. Apparently

he put two cops in the hospital last

night.

CONKLIN

What the fuck is he doing?

ZORN

Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying

to send us a message.

CONKLIN

It doesn't matter now. We've just

got to be the first ones there.

(decision time)

Get everybody up. I want them all

activated.

ZORN

All of them?

CONKLIN

You heard me.

COM TECH #2

(from the console --)

Sir, the cross-ref is coming up

cold...

MARIE

So what's in Paris?

BOURNE

I want to go home.

MARIE

For twenty thousand dollars.

BOURNE

I said ten thousand.

MARIE

You have blood on your pants.

BOURNE

Okay.

(beat)

Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.

MARIE

No. No, that was too easy --

(pacing away --)

BOURNE

Wait up --

(after her now --)

-- just wait up --

MARIE

-- get the fuck out of here -- all

this money, this crazy offer, I mean

give me a fucking break with this,

this is --

(stopping because--)

BOURNE

Look, I want a ride to Paris.

(wide open now)

That's all I want. I swear.

MARIE

You swear?

(cold here)

That's great. I feel so much better

now.

BOURNE

I don't want anything but a ride.

All I want to do is go home.

MARIE

You could buy a car for twenty grand.

You could buy this car.

BOURNE

I don't want to go alone. I want you

to drive me to Paris. Like we're a

couple. Like we're a couple and we're

travelling together. That's all we're

doing.

MARIE

And I don't get hurt. I get twenty

thousand dollars and I don't get

hurt.

BOURNE

I won't hurt you.

MARIE

What if I say no?

BOURNE

Then I'll find another ride.

MARIE

Just so you know, if you're gonna

burn me on the money, you might as

well kill me.

(Bourne looks over)

I was supposed to have this car back

three days ago. It's not my car.

BOURNE

I know that.

MARIE

Shit --

(trying to settle)

Can I tell you how much you're

freaking me out? Okay? Because you

are -- you're completely freaking me

out.

BOURNE

I'm sorry. Really. What do you want

me to do?

MARIE

I don't know. Smile. Sneeze.

Something. You've got a bag full of

money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it,

I don't know...

(the radio)

What kind of music do you like?

BOURNE

I don't know.

MARIE

What does that mean?

BOURNE

Listen to what you want.

MARIE

(out of nowhere)

Who pays twenty thousand dollars for

a ride to Paris?

BOURNE

I don't know. I don't know who I am.

MARIE

Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

BOURNE

No. No, I mean, I really don't know

who I am. I can't remember anything

earlier than two weeks ago.

(it's not flying)

I'm serious.

MARIE

What? Like amnesia?

BOURNE

Look, go ahead... put the radio on...

MARIE

Amnesia?

(total incredulity)

You're saying you don't remember

anything that happened before two

weeks ago?

BOURNE

That's what I'm saying.

MARIE

(German)

Give me a fucking break.

MORGUE BOSS

(French)

Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...

WOMBOSI

Get the fuck out of my way --

(pushing Deauvage

aside --)

WOMBOSI

(turning to Deauvage --)

It's not him.

WOMBOSI

(quiet hard fury)

So who's crazy now?

MARIE

And you have no idea -- not a clue --

what came before that?

BOURNE

No.

MARIE

When you think of it, before the

ship -- before you wake up on the

ship, what do you see?

BOURNE

Nothing. It's just not there.

MARIE

Well, this is great.

(she sits back)

I'm sick of myself and you have no

idea who you are.

BOURNE

I kept trying things, I thought if I

could find all the things I could

do, I could --

MARIE

-- you could put it together --

BOURNE

-- which was okay for a while, I was

okay with it...

(hesitating now)

But then -- there's all these other

things -- all these other things I

know how to do -- and this -- this

stuff from the bank and...

(suddenly flat out --)

I think something bad happened.

MARIE

What are you talking about?

BOURNE

I don't know.

MARIE

Sounds like you were in an accident

or something.

BOURNE

I was shot twice in the back.

MARIE

Okay, so you're a victim.

BOURNE

There was a gun. Who has a safe

deposit box with a gun and all this

money and all these passports?

MARIE

Lots of people have guns. You're

American. Americans love guns.

BOURNE

I fought my way out of an embassy.

I climbed down a fifty-foot wall --

I went out the window and I was doing

it -- I just did it. I knew how to

do it.

MARIE

People do amazing things when they're

scared.

BOURNE

Why do I? -- I come in here --

instinctively -- first thing I do --

I'm looking for the exit -- I'm

catching the sightlines -- I know I

can't sit with my back to the door --

MARIE

You're paranoid. You were shot. It's

natural.

BOURNE

I can tell you the license plate

numbers of all three cars out front.

I can tell you that the waitress is

left-handed and the guy at the counter

weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds

and knows how to handle himself. I

know that the best, first place to

look for a gun is the cab of that

grey truck outside. I know that at

this altitude I can run flat out for

half a mile before I lose my edge. I

knew that you were my first, best

option out of Zurich? How do I know

all that? How can I know all that

and not know who I am? How is that

possible?

MARIE

God, you're not kidding, are you?

CONKLIN

And that's the best angle of the

courtyard?

RESEARCH TECH #1

That's the only angle.

CONKLIN

What do they have on the streets?

The area. They must have something.

RESEARCH TECH #1

Hang on...

(typing away --)

CONKLIN

What?

ZORN

Abbott. He knows about the embassy.

He's coming down for a show and tell.

CONKLIN

That'll solve all our problems.

RESEARCH TECH #1

(he's hit paydirt)

Sir...

CONKLIN

(turning back --)

What's that?

RESEARCH TECH #1

It's an angle of the street -- some

sort of alleyway -- you can just...

CONKLIN

Enhance it.

CONKLIN (O.S.)

Who the hell is that?

MARIE

I needed a break.

BOURNE

Where are we?

MARIE

We're about an hour away.

BOURNE

I can't believe I slept.

MARIE

You were tired. Here...

(bread and soda --)

For twenty-thousand I like to throw

in breakfast.

(he takes it)

So what do you dream about?

BOURNE

I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm

asleep and I can't wake up.

(he takes a hit from

her smoke and coughs --)

I don't think I smoke.

MARIE

You ever think maybe you have a

family?

BOURNE

I thought about it. I don't know.

MARIE

I guess it's like Christmas every

day for you, huh?

ABBOTT

Who is she?

ZORN

Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty-

six. Born outside Munich. Father was

a welder. He died in '91. We don't

have the mother. There might be a

step-sister, we're trying to track

that down.

(apologetic)

It's tough. She's a wanderer. She

pops up on the grid here and there

but... I mean, the last time she

paid an electric bill in Europe was

'94. No taxes. No steady employer.

She's got three arrests. Two

shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one

in Germany. And she actually did

three months in an Italian detention

center for credit card fraud.

ABBOTT

No political affiliations?

CONKLIN

She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's

a great one.

ABBOTT

I'm assuming we're exploring that

possibility.

CONKLIN

We're exploring every possibility.

(tighter by the moment)

We are in pursuit. How much more do

you want me to tell you?

ABBOTT

Pursuit would indicate that you know

exactly where he is.

CONKLIN

No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly

where he is.

ABBOTT

Yes, well, I think we need some fresh

eyes on this problem. I'm bringing

in some people from upstairs.

CONKLIN

We've been down here for two weeks

banging our heads against the wall.

We've been sleeping down here. We

just got our first lead fourteen

hours ago, and now? -- now that we

finally have something to work with --

you want to bring planning personnel

down here?

(real steam)

I'd rethink that.

ABBOTT

I want a second opinion.

CONKLIN

This is an operations desk.

ABBOTT

I'm not asking.

BOURNE

Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...

MARIE

(looking over)

That's it? Is that it?

BOURNE

Four-fifty. That's the address...

MARIE

Looks familiar?

BOURNE

No.

(staring back as they

pass --)

No. Go around. Keep going...

MARIE

Where?

BOURNE

Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

MARIE

So this is it, right?

BOURNE

I guess.

MARIE

I should go.

BOURNE

I don't remember any of this.

MARIE

Jason...

BOURNE

Sorry. The money, right?

MARIE

Okay, so...

BOURNE

Thanks for the ride.

MARIE

Anytime.

BOURNE

Look, I don't know what's up there.

MARIE

You got me pretty fucking curious.

BOURNE

Look, you could come up. Or you could

wait if you want. I could go check

it out. You could wait.

MARIE

Nah...

(hide the pain)

With you, I mean, you'd probably

just forget about me, right?

BOURNE

How could I forget about you?

(he smiles)

You're the only person I know.

MARIE

I guess you're not home.

CONCIERGE (O.S.)

(from the shadows

inside --)

Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

CONCIERGE

(opening the door --)

Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was

wondering -- I haven't seen you --

BOURNE

Here I am.

BOURNE

(he tries a smile)

I seem to have lost my key.

CONCIERGE

I've been ringing your bell. It's

good you were away. We had some

trouble with the hot water. It's

been repaired.

BOURNE

Great. We could use a shower.

(they look like shit --)

It was a long drive.

MARIE

It's big.

MARIE

This is like a real apartment.

(she likes it)

This is really yours?

BOURNE

I guess so.

BOURNE

This is my frying pan.

(and then --)

This is my spoon.

(trying harder)

I'm Jason Bourne and this is my

kitchen.

MARIE

This is your office?

(from the doorway)

God, you live like a monk...

BOURNE

All this stuff -- it's all about

boats.

(looking up)

I think I'm in the shipping business.

MARIE

See. It's starting to come back,

yeah?

(he sort of nods)

You mind if I take a bath?

BOURNE

Go ahead.

PHONE MACHINE

"You have no messages."

OPERATOR/PHONE

Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...

BOURNE

...yes -- oui -- uh...

OPERATOR/PHONE

Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.

How can I direct your call?

BOURNE

Paris?

OPERATOR/PHONE

Yes, sir...

(switching to English,

thinking that's his

problem --)

How can I help you?

BOURNE

Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason

Bourne.

OPERATOR/PHONE

One moment, please...

(a long pause, and

then --)

I'm afraid, I have no one by that

name registered, sir.

BOURNE

D'accord... Merci.

(about to hang up--)

Un moment -- un moment --

OPERATOR/PHONE

-- sir? --

BOURNE

-- hang on -- I need you to check

another name for me -- hang on -- un

moment, s'il vous plait --

BOURNE

(reading it)

Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael

Kane?

OPERATOR/PHONE

One moment, sir.

MANAGER/PHONE

(a new voice suddenly)

Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...

BOURNE

Yes, I'm here...

MANAGER/PHONE

You call about Monsieur Kane? John

Michael Kane?

BOURNE

Yes. Is he there?

MANAGER/PHONE

You are a friend of his?

BOURNE

Yes.

MANAGER/PHONE

I have some very bad news for you,

sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to

tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has

passed away almost two weeks ago...

MANAGER/PHONE

There was an accident. On the

motorway. Apparently, he was killed

instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry

to be the one to tell you this...

BOURNE

...I understand...

MANAGER/PHONE

...we actually, we were unaware for

several days that this had happened.

When they came for his things, it

was made known for us, you see?

BOURNE

Who? Who came?

MANAGER/PHONE

His brother. You know his brother?

BOURNE

Right. Yes. Of course.

MANAGER/PHONE

It's very bad this. Terrible sad.

Such a young man.

BOURNE

Do you -- his brother -- do you have

a phone number?

MANAGER/PHONE

I think not...

(quick French to

someone in the office

there --)

No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden.

He was here very briefly.

MARIE

(calling out to him --)

She wasn't kidding about the water.

It's freezing.

BOURNE

Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...

(moving out of the

office --)

Maybe it takes a while to get all

the way upstairs.

BOURNE

Yeah, it's cold in here, too...

(calling to her as he

goes --)

Let's give it another minute.

MARIE

(suddenly --)

-- omigod! --

(she's behind him --)

-- what're you? -- no -- no --

BOURNE

-- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not

like that --

MARIE

-- please -- Jason -- omigod --

BOURNE

-- quiet -- quiet --

MARIE

...what are you doing?...

MARIE

omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? --

what're you doing? --

(incoherent fear and

confusion, German

and English and--)

-- what is he? -- what've you? --

omigod -- what is this? --

MARIE

-- what're you doing? -- Jason,

please, tell me what's happening!

BOURNE

Open it --

(tossing Castel's

backpack behind him --)

-- do it -- what's he got in there?

BOURNE

Who are you?

(kicking him down--)

-- who are you?

BOURNE

-- who are you? -- tell me who you

are -- who sent you? --

(bearing down)

-- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT

TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --

BOURNE

WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

MARIE

(suddenly from behind)

...omigod, no...

BOURNE

What? -- what? --

(attention split --)

-- what is it?

MARIE

...this is my picture... he's got my

picture --

(holding it up, in

horror --)

-- this is me -- this is Zurich --

this... this... this is yesterday --

BOURNE

-- just --

MARIE

-- where does this come from? --

(to Castel)

How do you have my picture?

BOURNE

Marie, just --

(waving her back --)

-- just stay there! -- just --

MARIE

-- he's got my picture! -- this is

yesterday! -- this is me! --

(out of control now --)

-- where did you get my picture? --

BOURNE

-- let me do this, okay? --

MARIE

-- do what? -- what are you doing? --

he's got my picture --

(just apoplectic --)

-- he's -- my God -- look at him --

he's bleeding to death -- my picture --

look! -- he was trying to kill us! --

omigod --

THE CONCIERGE

(muffled but urgent)

Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's

going on? Is everything all right in

there?

(-- and she keeps

banging and --)

THE CONCIERGE

(still outside the

door--)

--I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne --

you give me no choice -- I'm calling

them right away! --

BOURNE

-- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? --

where are your shoes? -- Marie --

MARIE

He's dead isn't he?

BOURNE

Marie -- look at me -- there's no

time for this --

MARIE

He went out the window -- why? --

why would someone do that?

BOURNE

-- we can't stay here -- I can't

stay here -- it's not safe here --

MARIE

He came to kill us.

BOURNE

-- we can go -- I can get us out of

here -- but we have to go now --

MARIE

You knew he was coming.

BOURNE

No.

MARIE

I trusted you.

BOURNE

You're wrong. I didn't know.

MARIE

I don't trust anybody and I trusted

you!

BOURNE

I didn't know this would happen.

MARIE

He had my picture! He knew I was

here! He came here to kill us!

BOURNE

And where is he now?

(that gets her quiet)

You believe what you want, but I'm

telling you the truth -- I never

would have brought you here if I

thought it was dangerous.

MARIE

(totally overwhelmed)

Oh, Jesus...

BOURNE

You stay -- if you want, you stay --

it's okay -- it's better -- maybe

it's better -- I don't know --

(starting to back

away --)

But I can't stay here. I can't.

MARIE

But the police --

BOURNE

-- there's no time --

MARIE

-- we'll explain it --

BOURNE

-- how? --

MARIE

-- there's two of us -- we'll tell

them -- we'll just --

BOURNE

-- forget it --

MARIE

-- we'll tell them what happened --

BOURNE

I don't know what happened!

(huge here)

I don't know who he is! I don't know

what he wants! I don't even know who

I am! The only thing I know is that

if I stay here, I'm never gonna find

out!

BOURNE

Come with me.

(she turns back, he's

waiting --)

I can get us out of here. I know it.

Then we can think. Then we can work

it out. We'll explain it then.  Once

we're safe.

(rock solid)

I can protect you.

WOMBOSI

-- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this

far -- out a body in the grave --

another body! -- no! -- this isn't

over -- these people are not finished --

nothing will make them finish until

they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi --

until I'm the one in the box! --

WOMBOSI

-- what are you doing? --

(bearing down on

Bodyguard #2 --)

-- sleeping? --

(to Deauvage --)

-- he's sleeping! -- this man is

sleeping at his post! --

(kicking the chair

out from under him --)

-- I've had men killed for this! --

(but he's still moving --)

-- you think these people? -- these

people who come for me -- you think

they sleep? -- they never sleep! --

they spend all the day -- all the

night -- all time thinking about how

to put Wombosi in that box! --

(he's just gonna keep

going, and we're

into--)

WOMBOSI

-- there is no box for Wombosi! --

they don't have a box that can hold

me! -- I know these people -- I know

they never sleep! -- I know they

never stop! -- they never stop until

the knife is at their throat! --

(suddenly distracted --)

-- what is the window? -- this window

is open! -- who leaves this open! --

(before Deauvage can

possibly respond --)

-- this is a war, you fool! -- you

think these people are like you? --

you think this is stupid people? --

careless people? -- these people see

an open window, they reach in with a

big hand and grab your heart until

you die! --

(still rolling as--)

WOMBOSI

-- and it won't just be me! -- they

don't just want Wombosi now! -- they

want my babies -- they want my

children! -- and I say no! --

(grabbing Deauvage --)

-- you leave that window open again,

you better pray they kill me --

(something's caught

his ear in the

distance and now

he's trying to get

there --)

-- everything changes here now! --

everyone is a soldier here now! --

this is a fortress now! Are we clear

with this?

DEAUVAGE

Yes, sir. All clear.

WOMBOSI

This man is out there. Kane is out

there. And they pretend he's dead.

That means he's coming back.

BOURNE/TAPE

"Okay. Merci."

(pause)

"Un moment -- un moment --"

OPERATOR/TAPE

"-- sir? --"

BOURNE/TAPE

"-- hang on -- I need you to check

another name for me -- hang on -- un

moment, s'il vous plait --"

BOURNE/TAPE

"Kane. John Michael Kane."

OPERATOR/TAPE

"One moment, sir."

MRS. DOYLE

He's not lying. He's very highly

stressed, but he's not lying. He's

confused. He's aggressively searching

for a way out of the chaos. This

conversation, the video from the

consulate -- the body language, vocal

pattern -- it's my sense he's really

lost here.

(beat)

I think he snapped.

CONKLIN

Is that a medical term?

MRS. DOYLE

You want clinical terminology? It's

called, "conversation hysteria."

(to Abbott now --)

I don't know exactly how you train

these people. I'm not sure I want to

know. I'll take a guess there's some

extremely rigorous behavior

modification going on here.

ABBOTT

Let's assume that's true.

MRS. DOYLE

You can only wind people so tight.

Even machines break down.

CONKLIN

This unit has an unblemished record

of success.

MRS. DOYLE

Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.

CONKLIN

That was two hours -- two hours to

get a second opinion -- and nothing

changes. He's loose. He's out of

control. It's very clear what needs

to happen.

(point blank)

I have work to do.

ABBOTT

What if he is working for someone

else? What if he turned?

CONKLIN

Turn? To who? Where does he turn?

What does he have to offer? He's got

nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece

of equipment for crissake. Where's

he gonna turn?

BOURNE

No.

(he won't do it)

You know who you are. You know what

that's worth? That's everything.

(pause)

I can't live like this. I can't do

anything until I know who I am.

Believe me, you don't want what I

have.

...................................................

...................................................

MARIE

You stayed there five times in the

past six months. But I didn't have

time -- I could only get the bill

from the last stay -- you were there

for two days. Some room service --

there's half a dozen phone calls

here so that's someth--

BOURNE

(cutting her off)

Who paid the bill?

MARIE

It's a company... MPG Capital.

MARIE

This can't be it.

TELEPHONE VOICE (OVER)

(British, female)

Destin Navigational, can I help you?

BOURNE'S VOICE (OVER)

Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach

Richard? Is he there.

TELEPHONE VOICE

I'm afraid there's no Richard here.

(continuing into --)

BOURNE

Well, where are you? Where am I

calling?

TELEPHONE VOICE

This is an answering service, sir.

The company's located in Southampton,

but --

BOURNE

-- this is a tire dealership, right?

TELEPHONE VOICE

No sir, this is a navigational chart

registry. I'm afraid you have the

wrong number.

NEW VOICE (OVER)

(French, male, hassled)

Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I

help you?

BOURNE

Hey, so this is the Marina, right?

NEW VOICE

Yes, sir. Can I help you?

BOURNE

(he's got the number)

This is the one in Marseille, right?

NEW VOICE

(Last time I looked.)

OPERATOR RECORDING (OVER)

The number you have dialed has been

disconnected. If you think you've

reached this message in error--

RECORDED VOICE (OVER)

"You've reached the office of Simon

Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime

Division. Paris office hours are

from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this

is an emergency, please call our

twenty-four hour help line at..."

CONKLIN

-- let's check that Interpol window

again --

RESEARCH TECH #1

-- I'm on it --

CONKLIN

-- I want that red car -- the girl --

we gotta get lucky here --

RESEARCH TECH #2

Sir.

(Conklin turns --)

I've got a code here from NSA --

they're not gonna give us Keyhole

satellite clearance unless we have

sign-off from upstairs.

ABBOTT

No.

(sitting there tensely)

We can't risk it.

CONKLIN

Our last sighting was forty-eight

hours ago. Even if they stayed in

the car, the grid is huge.

(please)

This is it. He's trained --

conditioned -- they're built to

disappear. You give him another day

to run and we may never find him.

ABBOTT

This doesn't go upstairs.

RAWLINS

Mr. Kane...

(hastily tidying up)

Come right in... please... have a

seat.

BOURNE

Thanks.

RAWLINS

Well...

(really thrown)

I must admit, when my assistant told

me you were here I was, really -- I

was quite -- I was surprised.

BOURNE

Really.

RAWLINS

We thought you were gone for good.

BOURNE

Did you?

RAWLINS

Well, I mean it's a tough business,

isn't it? Cutthroat.

RAWLINS

(finally)

Look, our bid -- it was competitive --

but definitely at the high end of

competitive -- when we didn't hear

back from you, we did some re-analysis

of the numbers, and honestly, we'd

really like a chance to do a bit

better.

(pitching now)

I'm assuming you're still in the

market. It's the same vessel?

BOURNE

Yes.

RAWLINS

We just picked up a job quite like

the one we were bidding for you.

Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-

five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think

we learned a few things that might

allow us to make our proposal for

your job, as I said, a bit more

competitive.

BOURNE

Okay.

RAWLINS

Was it the break-in?

BOURNE

Excuse me?

RAWLINS

We also thought we hadn't heard from

you -- we've had a bit of a publicity

nightmare, people have been talking.

(the meat)

Our offices were broken into --

vandalism mostly -- shortly after we

last spoke.

BOURNE

I hadn't heard.

RAWLINS

Let me get you a new copy of the

proposal.

BOURNE

That'd be great.

MARIE

I found it.

(standing there)

It took six calls.

(she's creeped out)

I found Kane. I found the body.

BOURNE

Let's go --

(already standing --)

We got to get away from this phone.

ATTENDANT #1

(picking up the cash)

What was the name again?

BOURNE

Kane. John Michael Kane.

ATTENDANT #2

It's number 121.

BOURNE

I want to see the body.

ATTENDANT #1

Our boss could come back. We're not

supposed to.

MARIE

What?

MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)

(from behind them --)

What the hell's going on here?

ATTENDANT #1

This guy, he came to see the American,

but the body, it's missing.

MORGUE BOSS

They came last night.  His brother.

ATTENDANT #2

It's not in the book.

MORGUE BOSS

Who are these people?

(now English to Bourne)

Who are you? What's going on here?

BOURNE

Where did this body go?

MORGUE BOSS

I said, someone came last night --

(big attitude now)

Look, this isn't a carnival -- people

call and they make an appointment

and they follow the rules -- everyone

signs in and out -- this is a serious

place -- serious work -- it's not

just to come in whenever you like --

BOURNE

(like a shot)

Shit, we didn't sign in.

MORGUE BOSS

So get the hell out of here.

BOURNE

Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In

fact, I insist on it. Where's the

book? I gotta sign in --

(off and running now --)

BOURNE

Is this it? --

(the book)

-- this is it, right? --

MORGUE BOSS

-- slow down -- you can't just take

the book like that --

BOURNE

-- don't sweat it, I have a pen --

no problem -- just let me find the

page --

(then quick to Marie)

-- honey, why don't you wait for me

outside, okay? --

MORGUE BOSS

-- we have rules here, this is a

very serious place -- I'm the one

who decides who gets in here, okay? --

BOURNE

-- what do I? -- I put the name of

the person I came to see? --

MORGUE BOSS

-- this is serious business down

here and we cannot have people coming

and going --

BOURNE

-- here we go -- I found it --

MORGUE BOSS

-- what are you? -- what are you

doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped

the book! -- you stupid fucki--

(no chance to finish

this, because --)

MARIE

What are you doing? --

(he's scaring her)

-- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...

MARIE

-- I don't know what you're doing

and you're scaring me -- what are

you looking for? -- what just happened

in there? --

BOURNE

Nykwana Wombosi.

(he stops, holding up

the brochure --)

MARIE

What is that?

BOURNE

It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty

million dollar yacht. He's the proud

owner of an Alliance Security package.

(handing her the

brochure --)

He also paid a visit to the morgue

to see John Michael Kane.

(the ripped-out page --)

MARIE

What does that mean?

(but he's walking

again --)

Jason, what does that mean?

(she's trying to catch

up, but he's walking

really fast --)

Jason, please... who is he?

BOURNE

I don't know.

(he's not turning

back again --)

MARIE

So what are we doing?

BOURNE

Go back to the hotel.

ZORN

They found him. They found Bourne.

ABBOTT

Where?

ZORN

You better come in.

DEAUVAGE

Jesus fuck, what is this?

ABBOTT

Omigod.

CONKLIN

-- how long? --

COMM TECH #1

-- minutes -- he's close --

ABBOTT

-- he went inside! --

CONKLIN

(to Abbott)

-- if we can get a clean shot --

ABBOTT

-- inside the house? --

CONKLIN

-- that's what they're trained for --

just a surgical strike.

ABBOTT

Forget it.

CONKLIN

What do you want to do?

ABBOTT

We don't know what we're into!

CONKLIN

We're in the shitter, man! Pick your

poison. Maybe he's in there to finish

the job. Maybe he's working for

Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV

together. Every possibility sucks --

we've got to move!

BOURNE

Is he here?

CONKLIN

You don't have the stones for this.

You people come down here and wink

and whisper and we send these guys

out and get it done. And you're clear.

And the guys upstairs get what they

want. And the whole bunch of you are

so stuffed on deniability it's coming

out of your ears.

(gauntlet)

Well, you know what? You're here

now. What do you want to do?

WOMBOSI

Come in.

(an imperial gesture)

Please...

WOMBOSI

Did you bring investment advice for

me tonight? It was tax shelters,

wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.

BOURNE

MPG Capital.

WOMBOSI

I think investment advice from a

dead man, it's a bad idea.

(beat)

How does it feel to be dead?

BOURNE

It's a lot more stressful than I

thought.

WOMBOSI

-- no -- no, let them in! -- let

them in.

(to the kids)

Come in -- on y va -- come in...

(to Bourne)

I think everyone wants to see the

dead man.

WOMBOSI

What do you do?

(on his feet now --)

You get an appointment with me? You

make sure it's on the boat? You come

visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit

investment package. You drink my

water -- eat my bread -- play with

my children -- and what? -- two nights

later you come back and you put this

death --

(slamming something

down onto the throne --)

-- you put this in my engine room!

WOMBOSI

So this is a different kind of

meeting.

(steam building)

Maybe now we talk some truth, okay?

One dead man to another.

WOMBOSI

You see this?

(calling to Deauvage --)

I told you my shot was better!

DEAUVAGE

He went in the water -- how did he

live?

WOMBOSI

No, no no...

(and he means this --)

This is a strong killer. This is a

crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...

(circling)

To make a killer that looks like

you? This young? This face?

(he means this)

It's bloody fucking amazing.

BOURNE

Who do you think sent me?

WOMBOSI

I know who sent you. I don't know

why.

(this could get

physical at any moment

now --)

I learned many, many things from the

CIA. Many things. I learned the way

they think.

(beat)

Was the bomb on my boat supposed to

go off or not?

WOMBOSI

You didn't set the bomb. Why?

WOMBOSI

Was this a game or a fuck up?

BOURNE

I don't know.

WOMBOSI

Get the kids out!

WOMBOSI

And the door.

CONKLIN

COM TECH #1

CONKLIN

-- the paging unit must be damaged --

COM TECH #2

sir, it's not the unit --

ABBOTT

What are you doing?

CONKLIN

I'm going to Paris.

ABBOTT

No you're not. You're not going

anywhere. I'm shutting this down.

CONKLIN

You're not doing shit. You're so

scared you can't even think.

ABBOTT

You just blew up a house in Paris!

This program is over. Call it off.

CONKLIN

I can't call it off. He's not

responding. Get out of my way.

MARIE

It doesn't matter who you were before.

It's who you want to be. That's all

that matters.

(is he listening?)

We have this money. We have what we

have. I had nothing before and now,

I don't know, maybe I have more,

maybe it's nothing, but...

(he looks over)

I say we leave here. We leave this

place. We go until we can't go

anymore.

BOURNE

You could do that?

MARIE

Yes. That's who I want to be.

My husband's out looking for him.

BOURNE

He run away often?

CLERK

That old beast? Miss his breakfast?

Not a chance.

(returning to cleaning)

It's always something, right?

BOURNE

Get in the basement.

CLERK

What?

BOURNE

(to Marie)

Get everyone down in the basement.

You're in danger. All of you. I have

BOURNE

Who else is coming?

BOURNE

I won't ask again.

PROFESSOR

I work alone. Like you...

(confused beat)

...we always work alone.

BOURNE

What do you mean?

PROFESSOR

Who are you? Rome? Paris?

(Bourne is just staring --)

Treadstone... both of us... I was

warned but...

BOURNE

Treadstone?

PROFESSOR

...which one are you?...

BOURNE

Paris. I live in Paris...

PROFESSOR

...headaches... you have that... I

get such bad headaches...

BOURNE

Yes.

PROFESSOR

...it's a problem...

BOURNE

Treadstone.

PROFESSOR

...or in a car... when it's dark...

something with the headlights...

(circuits exploding)

...pills, right? Treadstone had those

pills...

BOURNE

What is Treadstone?

PROFESSOR

...what did you do?... you must've

really fucked up...

BOURNE

I think so.

PROFESSOR

...someone said caffeine -- for a

headache... doesn't seem...

BOURNE

What do they want me to do?

PROFESSOR

...they won't let you go...

BOURNE

Why?

PROFESSOR

Look at this...

(all the blood --)

...least you have a woman....

MARIE

Jason...

MARIE

We've got to go.

BOURNE

Take this.

BOURNE

Take it.

MARIE

And that's it?

BOURNE

If you're lucky.

(it's hanging there)

Take it.

(beat)

There's enough in there to make a

life. Any life. Just get out now.

Get low. Stay low.

(beat)

Take it.

MARIE

What was I thinking, right?

BOURNE

I can't protect you anymore.

MARIE

What about you?

BOURNE

I'm gonna find the end of this.

(beat)

I can't protect you.

BOURNE

What did you do to me?

CONKLIN

What did I do? What've you done? Do

you have any idea? Any conception?

What you've destroyed? Do you have

any idea how much time and work --

how many people have their lives

wrapped up in this?

BOURNE

Are you Treadstone?

CONKLIN

Am I Treadstone? Me?

(peering at him closely

now --)

What the hell're you talking about?

BOURNE

What did you do to me?

CONKLIN

What did I do? I spent thirty million

dollars on you. I spent three years

finding you -- four years training

you --

(incredulous)

What did I do?

(staring now)

What in the name of God have you

been doing, Jason?

BOURNE

I don't know.

CONKLIN

They're right about you, aren't they?

You're fried.

(on it now)

You really don't know what's going

on, do you?

BOURNE

I know you've been trying to kill

me.

CONKLIN

Of course. We had to try. We didn't

know what was wrong.

(warming to this --)

We didn't know you were in trouble.

BOURNE

So now you know.

CONKLIN

So it's time to go home.

BOURNE

That's all I get?

CONKLIN

We'll make you better. We can put

the pieces back. We can do that.

BOURNE

I don't think so.

CONKLIN

We have to go home, Jason.

BOURNE

Jason Bourne is dead.

CONKLIN

There never was a Jason Bourne.

(that gets him)

You have to come with me. It's the

only way. We can give it back to

you...

BOURNE

Keep it.

(and he's walking --)

(trying to follow --)

They can't let you go...

BOURNE

That'll be their second worst mistake.

DISSOLVE TO:

ABBOTT (O.S.)

The Treadstone project has actually

already been terminated. It was

designed primarily as a sort of

advanced game program...

ABBOTT

...We'd hoped it might build into a

good training platform, but quite

honestly, for a strictly theoretical

exercise, we thought it was far too

expensive. The cost-benefit ratio

was just too high. It's been all but

decommissioned at this point.

MARSHALL

All right, what's next?

ABBOTT

Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar

is a joint, DOD, communications

program that we really feel has good

traction to it.

MARIE

Can I help you?

BOURNE

This your store?

MARIE

Yes.

BOURNE

Think I could rent a scooter?

MARIE

You have ID?

BOURNE

Not really.

MARIE

It's not a problem.

FADE OUT:

THE END
