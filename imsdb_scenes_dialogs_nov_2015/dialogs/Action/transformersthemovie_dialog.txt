FADE IN:

PUSH DOWN TO:

ARBLUS

Transform and flee, Kranix! You must

warn all you meet of the horror of

Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature

is surrounded by the strange energy cloud

and it looks like his body has

simultaneously caught fire and been

doused with acid.

KRANIX

Arblus!   No!

NARRATOR

It is the year 2005. The treacherous

Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'

home planet of Cybertron. But from

secret staging grounds on two of

Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots

prepare to retake their homeland.

IRONHIDE

Every time I look into this thing, my

circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this

waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna

start bustin' Deceptichops?

OPTIMUS PRIME

We still don't have enough Energon cubes

to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.

IRONHIDE

Then let me make another run to Autobot

City on Earth. I'll bring you back more

cubes than you'll know what to do with.

3.

PRIME

Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.

IRONHIDE

YAHOO!

(looking into monitor)

Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.

OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)

Jazz,    report security status.

JAZZ

No sign of Decepticons in this sector,

Prime.

PRIME

What about Moon Base 2?

JAZZ

Jazz to Moon Base 2.

ANOTHER MOON

This is the second moon. It is much

closer to Cybertron than the first one.

This is where Bumblebee and Spike are

stationed.

JAZZ (V.O.)

Jazz to Moon Base 2.

(CONTINUED)

4.

BUMBLEBEE

Bumblebee and Spike here.

JAZZ (V.O.)

We're about to send up the bird. Any

Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?

BUMBLEBEE

All clear, Jazz.

(pause)

SPIKE

Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I

miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming

home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's

tail   across the galaxy.

CUT TO:

IRONHIDE

Will do, Spike.

PRIME

Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.

CLIFFJUMPER

Five...Four...Three...Two...

CLIFFJUMPER

One....

CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Liftoff.

PRIME

Now, all we need is a little Energon and

a lot of luck.

DISSOLVE TO:

PROWL (V.O.)

Slow down, Ironhide. We want to get to

Autobot city in one piece.

CUT TO:

IRONHIDE

If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can

sure as shootin' dodge a couple of

asteroids.

PROWL

You were saying?

IRONHIDE (IRKED)

That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast

of light and they turn to see...

6.

MEGATRON

Die Autobots!

BRAWN

is cut in half by Megatron's blast.

ON PROWL

as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.

THE INSECTICONS

...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to

make way for... ...an ARMY of other

Decepticons including Laserbeak who

enter, firing.

MEGATRON

This was almost too easy, Starscream.

STARSCREAM

Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than

attacking the real threat: the Autobots

moon base.

MEGATRON

You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we

simply to wipe out that minuscule base,

they could build another one.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

7.

MEGATRON (CONT'D)

But when we slip by their security

systems in their own ship and destroy

Autobot city, the Autobots will be

vanquished forever!

IRONHIDE

Fat chance, Megatron!

MEGATRON

Such heroic nonsense!

DISSOLVE TO:

DANIEL (V.O.)

The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint

zeta.

ON DANIEL

Daniel, a classic twelve year old

American boy watches the portable viewer

which is like an over-sized Boy Scout

compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an

old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth -

surrounded by weeping willows, assorted

trees and shrubs, and that his fishing

pole is stuck in the dirt, the line

floating lazily out on the water.

DANIEL

Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As

Daniel runs to small skateboard-like

device, hits a button, and watches, it

transforms into a hoverboard and rides

it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy

hillside we change angle to feature...

HOT ROD

an "adolescent" Autobot. He is in robot

mode, sitting with his fishing rod held

between two fingers, looking bored with

it all.

HOT ROD (CONT'D)

Talk about dull......!

(CONTINUED)

8.

DANIEL

(calling excitedly)

Hurry or we'll miss it!

HOT ROD

lopes up hill after Daniel.

HOT ROD (CONT'D)

If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in

style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel,

scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS

to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST

OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.

DANIEL

Hey!   Let me out.

HOT ROD

Why settle for a peek when you can see

everything from Lookout Mountain?

(CONTINUED)

9.

DANIEL

But we're not supposed to go beyond City

limits!

HOT ROD

Chromo-Chicken!

KUP

disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the

mountain.

KUP (CONT'D)

(to sound like swearing)

Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk.

CUT TO:

HOT ROD

This is it! Now take a squint through

those babies.

DANIEL

Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the

shuttle!

HOT ROD

What!?

10.

HOT ROD (O.S.)

Decepticons!

HOT ROD

This is for Ironhide.    As so's this!

STARSCREAM

He ducks away from the door.

STARSCREAM (CONT'D)

I'm hit!

THE CONSTRUCTICONS

Firing out of the hole.

MEGATRON

He's furious.

MEGATRON (CONT'D)

You imbecile, our cover is blown!

STARSCREAM

It was your stupid strategy!

CUT TO:

KUP

What's that darn fool doing? Hound looks

up and points.

(CONTINUED)

11.

HOUND

Decepticons!

MEGATRON

(shouting to forces)

Attack!

(he looks down and fires)

HOT ROD

Hang on!

HOT ROD

(SHOUTING)

WHoooooooaaah

BLITZWING

(amused)

Come on down, Autobrat!

HOT ROD

Yiiiiiiiiii!

(CONTINUED)

12.

ON BLITZWING

about to fire, when...

SHRAPNEL

who is flying nearby.

BLITZWING

transforms to robot mode and turns as...

Kup comes flying, feet first, into

Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain

ledge.

HOT ROD

Not bad for an old timer!

KUP

(gruffly)

Old timer?! That's something you'll

never be if you don't get back to the

city. You know what we used to do with

cocky, insubordinate upstarts?

HOT ROD

(interrupting)

Save it.

STARSCREAM

transforming into jet mode, fires on them

with laser bursts which...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

13.

PERCEPTOR

transforms to humanoid and runs

toward...... ... Three new Autobots,

ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about

Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular

and bantering "Indiana Jones" type

Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and

soldierly City Commander.

PERCEPTOR

Ultra Magnus.....a cursory evaluation of

Decepticon capability indicates a

distinct tactical deficit!

ULTRA MAGNUS

In other words, Perceptor...

SPRINGER

(translating)

We're outnumbered!

ULTRA MAGNUS

Springer, Arcee, transform Autobot City!

STARSCREAM (V.O.)

Pathetic fools!

STARSCREAM

TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode,

firing all around them as they...

(CONTINUED)

14.

STARSCREAM

There's no escape...Uuuuh! Just then, the

floor of the courtyard STARTS

TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the

floor snaps shut like the halves of a

gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping

Starscream's foot.

STARSCREAM

Agggggggh!     My foot!

CUT TO:

ON MEGATRON

as he FLIES OVER SCENE, BLASTING this way

and that, shouting

MEGATRON

Breach their defenses!

ON INSECTICONS

who are trailing Megatron, attack the

fast CLOSING CITY, trying to GNAW AND

DEVOUR their way through the PORTS and

BRIDGES leading inside.

KICKBACK

(Chewing on jamb of doorway

near bridge)

Delicious, eh Shrapnel?

(CONTINUED)

15.

SHRAPNEL

(CHEWING on draw-bridge to

City)

A little heavy on the electrons.

Electrons.

ZOOM UP TO:

KUP (V.O.)

The Insecticons are in our way.

HOT ROD (V.O.)

Wrong!   They're our way in!   Yaaaaaaay-

hah!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and... ...

rides up and over Kickback's back, using

it like a stunt driver's ramp to...

ON SHRAPNEL

As Shrapnel looks up and reacts... ...Kup

hurtles up and over Kickback's back just

as Kickback is starting to rise to see

what knocked him face down onto the

bridge in the first place. ... Kup goes

SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between

Kickback's back and the doorway into the

city- -clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the

way and landing on the city doorstep,

driving in as...

THE DOORWAY

transforms, shutting down with metal

shields with a "clank" sound as Kickback

and Shrapnel both leap at is to... ...

bite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK

THEIR TEETH on steel door, falling face

down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY

CUT TO:

16.

ULTRA MAGNUS

(sternly)

You can explain your security violation

later, Hot Rod! Now, man your battle

station.

HOT ROD

I don't have to explain my so called

violation to you or anyone...

KUP

(tugs him along roughly)

He said "later!"

CUT TO:

BLASTER

Lookout and shout! Yow! Explosions rock

the Crows Nest. Blaster swivels around

and tilts to see...

BLASTER

activates turret type LASER CANNON

BLASTER

Gonna lay some slugs on those overweight

bugs!

(FIRES Laser Cannon)

(CONTINUED)

17.

CANNON SWIVELS

LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW IT

OFF SCREEN to...

THE INSECTICONS

as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up and

out of sight and causes Shrapnel and

Kickback to get sucked into the vacuum.

BLASTER

Perceptor joins him.

BLASTER

(joyful at his direct hit)

I'm talkin' hits here, Autobuddies! Hits

with a capital "aitch" like in Hard,

Heavy and...

(sees Perceptor)

Hey, Perceptor, what's shakin' other than

this fortress?

PERCEPTOR

Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to

contact Optimus Prime for reinforcements.

BLASTER

Alright! Cover your receptors,

Perceptor! Blaster transforms to ghetto

blaster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE

waves...

THE WAVES

rise and expand into space

BLASTER

Optimus Prime... Do you read me? The

Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City.

We're really takin' a pounding. Don't

know how much longer we can hold out.

CUT TO:

MEGATRON

Soundwave!     Jam that transmission.

ON SOUNDWAVE

SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts

heaving CASSETTES upwards toward

Blaster's Crows Nest position.

SOUNDWAVE

Rumble! Frenzy! Ravage! Ratbat! Eject!

Operation: interference.

ON CASSETTES

nest.

ON RUMBLE

as he starts PILE DRIVER MOTION on Crows

Nest windows

RUMBLE

First we crack the shell.    Then we crack

the nuts inside.

BLASTER

We got Cassette Critters knockin' on the

window!

ON RUMBLE

as he CRACKS THROUGH GLASS and he and

others swarm in and attack Perceptor who

tries to beat them away

PERCEPTOR

Run, Blaster! Save yourself!

BLASTER

No way. Two can play!

ON BLASTER

as he spews out CASSETTES which TRANSFORM

into CUBBIE, a lion, STRIPES, a tiger,

STINGER, a scorpion and BOLTS, a small,

tough robot.

BLASTER

Sic 'em!

19.

ON RUMBLE

as Cubbie takes him down by the foot,

turning him over and over

ON STRIPES

as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and

darts, trying to escape as we move to

PERCEPTOR

You think you got through to Prime?

BLASTER

Let's hope so! Cause if I didn't we're

gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens!

CUT TO:

MEGATRON

Constructicons merge for the kill!

SPRINGER

Great! Megatron's making his big push and

we can't even push...

(struggling to turn Catapult

around to re-aim it)

...back!

(CONTINUED)

20.

KUP

Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at

hand!

(to Hot Rod)

Together now!

DANIEL

also leans against it, his small legs

churning.

THE CATAPULT

starts moving easily now.

ARCEE

(pushing, manages to speak to

Hot Rod. She likes him but

doesn't want to go too far)

I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the

city walls.

HOT ROD

(likes her, too, but tries to

be cool and collected)

Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second,

Arcee!

ARCEE

(enjoying letting him have it)

Then you probably didn't understand the

situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup

steps back from repositioned Catapult

KUP

That did it!

(CONTINUED)

21.

DANIEL

Kup, Hot Rod! Look!

(he points)

KUP (V.O.)

Devastator!

ON DEVASTATOR

as he rises up and starts FIRING,

HAMMERING, TEARING AWAY at metal shields

which create armored walls of the

transformed City.

SPRINGER

I got better things to do today than die.

(he FIRES Catapult)

DEVASTATOR

and explode harmlessly as Devastator

continues to grunt and tear off armored

layers of the city. He grabs Hot Rod and

Kup and starts to crush them.

ARCEE

Hot Rod!

CUT TO:

22.

OPTIMUS PRIME

Dinobots.    Destroy Devastator!

GRIMLOCK

Uhhhh! Me Grimlock love challenge!

Dinobots, transform!

DINOBOTS

Grimlock at the front... ...fly out of

the shuttle in wedge formation, blasting

in unison.

FOLLOW DINOBOTS

In as they transform again and, in dino

mode, swoop over to Devastator...

DEVASTATOR

Roars towards the Dinobots.

THEIR BATTLE

Megatron must be stopped.

PRIME (V.O.)

No matter the cost.

MEGATRON

MEGATRON

Their defenses are broken.    Let the

slaughter begin.

MEGATRON

Prime!?

PRIME

smashing through a wall of lesser

Decepticons.

PRIME

One shall stand, one shall fall.

MEGATRON

Why throw away your life so recklessly?

24.

OPTIMUS PRIME

That's a question you should ask

yourself.

MEGATRON

hurls himself at Optimus Prime... ....

both tumble into the walls of the City...

...denting the walls and causing the

electronic panels inside to short

circuit, surrounding them with a fiery

nimbus of crackling electrical energy.

HOT ROD

We've got to save Prime! Punching...

KUP

That's his fight, lad!   Stay away.

Shooting..

MEGATRON

grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel

and hurls it at

PRIME

The steel "spear" pierces his side and

sticks in him as... ... he charges

Megatron, ...dodging shots from

Megatron's gun to... ...deliver a huge

UPPERCUT which... ...lifts Megatron into

the air so high that... ...

overhanging concrete balcony, mashing him

down...

MEGATRON

lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger

from his boot, turning and slashing at...

PRIME

as he comes for him, tearing... ...a gash

across Prime's midsection, which spews

smoke and sparks and...

MEGATRON

(gloating)

Farewell, Prime!

OPTIMUS PRIME

as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and

catches the laser dagger on it, tossing

it aside as he lunges at-

MEGATRON

who claws his fingers and digs them into

Prime's eyes

MEGATRON

I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs

Megatron's clawed hand in one of his

hands, twists it in see-sawing test of

strength which... Optimus wins in a judo

toss which sends Megatron - - skidding

face first through steel rubble, in a

shower of sparks until he crashes into

the side of the city.

HOT ROD

That's showing him, Optimus!

KUP

knocks two Decepticons on their tails and

turns.

KUP

Finish him off, Prime!   Do it now!

ON MEGATRON

as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of

him

MEGATRON

No more, Optimus Prime!    Grant me mercy,

I beg of you!

OPTIMUS PRIME

You who are without mercy now plead for

it. I thought you were made of sterner

stuff, Megatron!

PRIME

Out of the way, Hot Rod.

ON MEGATRON

firing blaster again and again

MEGATRON

Fall!   Fall!

MEGATRON

I would have waited an eternity for this.

Crawl, slave! On your knees!

OPTIMUS PRIME

(gasping painfully)

Never!

HOT ROD

Optimus!    Forgive me!

STARSCREAM

(sarcastic, filled with false

sympathy)

How do you feel, Mighty Megatron?

(he kicks Megatron)

MEGATRON

(weakly clutching at

Starscream's hand, gasping)

Enshrine me!

STARSCREAM

(drops Megatron's hand coldly,

calls to other Decepticons)

Take this scrap to Cybertron!

Astrotrain, transform and get us out of

here!

28.

ARCEE

The Decepticons are retreating.

KUP

Prime did it. He turned the tide! He

shoots (O.S.) into...

THE AUTOBOTS

fire after them, closing ranks on the

shuttle, and pouring shots into the

melee.

STARSCREAM

Astrotrain, take off.

DISSOLVE TO:

OPTIMUS PRIME

platform, a profusion of electricity

discharging tubes and "plasma" bottle

devices hooked up to his arms and into

his gaping middle wound.

29.

SCANNERS

emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic

patterns but sounds and wave patterns are

steadily growing weaker and weaker.

PERCEPTOR

is bent over Prime, in microscope mode,

examining him... He then transforms and

straightens up, his voice strained and

cracking with emotion.

PERCEPTOR

I fear the wounds are...

(he can't finish what he's

going to say)

INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, ARCEE, DANIEL

AND OTHER AUTOBOTS as they react.

OPTIMUS PRIME

(using remaining strength to

makes himself heard)

Autobots...do not grieve... Soon, I shall

be one with the matrix.

HOT ROD

(a flash of hope)

Prime!

(looks off at Prime)

OPTIMUS PRIME

(reaches up with right hand

with great effort)

Ultra Magnus! It is to you, old friend,

I shall pass the matrix as it was passed

to me ....

MAGNUS

Prime, I'm just a soldier.   I'm not

worthy.

(CONTINUED)

30.

OPTIMUS PRIME

(gasping)

Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot shall

rise from our ranks and use the powers of

the Matrix to light our darkest hour.

OPTIMUS PRIME

(voice failing, pressing on

with it)

Until that day...

DISSOLVE TO:

31.

CUT TO:

ASTROTRAIN

Jettison some weight, or I'll never make

it to Cybertron.

STARSCREAM

Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has

requested that we lighten our burden!

BONECRUSHER

In that case, I say it's survival of the

fittest.

STARSCREAM

So I hear a second on that?

HEALTHY DECEPTICONS

Aye!

STARSCREAM

And against?

STARSCREAM

The ayes' have it!

32.

(AD LIB)

Beat it!     Spare me!

STARSCREAM

(sarcastic)

Oh, how it grieves me to do this.

MEGATRON

Wait, I still function!

STARSCREAM

Wanna bet?

STARSCREAM

Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say -

departed. I nominate myself as the new

leader.

SCRAPPER

The Constructicons form Devastator, the

most powerful robot. We should rule.

Constructicons, unite!

RUMBLE/FRENZY

No way!

BLITZWING

I am a triple changer. I am worth any

Stop squabbling or we're gonna crash.

DISSOLVE TO:

UNICRON

Welcome, Megatron.

MEGATRON

(looking around)

Who said that?

UNICRON

I am Unicron.

MEGATRON

Show yourself!

UNICRON

I have summoned you here for a purpose.

MEGATRON

Nobody summons Megatron!

UNICRON

Then it pleases me to be the first.

MEGATRON

State your business.

UNICRON

Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the

one thing - the only thing that can stand

in my way.

MEGATRON

You have nothing to fear. I have already

crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.

UNICRON

You exaggerate.

MEGATRON

The point is, he is dead!   And the Matrix

died with him.

UNICRON

No. It has been passed to their new

leader. Get it for me.

MEGATRON

Why should I? What's in it for me?

(CONTINUED)

35.

UNICRON

Your bargaining posture is highly

dubious, but very well, I will provide

you with a new body, and new troops to

command.

MEGATRON

And...

UNICRON

And nothing.

MEGATRON

I belong to nobody.

UNICRON

Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your

way to oblivion. The Mist appears and

starts to dissolve Megatron.

MEGATRON

(pleading)

No, no. I accept your terms.   I accept!

UNICRON

Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray

images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on

and off as a new and larger being starts

to form, changing from dented Megatron to

a huge, new creation: Galvatron.

GALVATRON

Long live Galvatron!

And these shall be your minions...

Bring me the Autobot matrix! DURING

UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW

GALVATRON

I will rip open Autobot after Autobot

until it is yours, Unicron.

OTHER DECEPTICONS

in neat ranks but their grim expressions

show their displeasure.

STARSCREAM

(preening)

Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and

others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up

and off. Starscream looks where others

are looking and reacts.

STARSCREAM

Who disrupts my coronation?

GALVATRON

Coronation? This is bad comedy!

STARSCREAM

Megatron, is that you?

GALVATRON

Here's a clue!

GALVATRON

He transforms back to robot mode and

confronts other Decepticons boastfully.

GALVATRON

Will anyone else attempt to fill his

shoes?

38.

GALVATRON

Galvatron.

UNICRON

Bit by bit, we see new    sections of the

planet being generated.    Then, the

sinister mist we saw at    the beginning of

UNICRON

A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the

DANIEL

Dad!

ULTRA MAGNUS

Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.

This new menace is more dangerous than

all the Decepticons put together.

Somehow we must destroy it before it

devours Cybertron.

DANIEL

But what about my dad? He's on the moon

between that monster and Cybertron.

ULTRA MAGNUS

Daniel, I'll do everything I can for

Spike.

HOT ROD

And what are we going to do when we get

there? If that thing crunches moons,

it'll make short work of us.

ULTRA MAGNUS

Maybe the Matrix can stop it.

HOT ROD

You're right! It can.

KUP

What do you know about it lad?

HOT ROD

It's just a feeling.

KUP

Look!

43.

ULTRA MAGNUS

To the shuttles!!!

GALVATRON

There is no escape. I, Galvatron will

crush you just as the magnificent

Megatron crushed Prime!

ULTRA MAGNUS

And you'll die trying just like Megatron!

Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits

Galvatron.

pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets

hit by laser

(CONTINUED)

44.

ARCEE

No, you'd better stay close to me. Blurr

is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle

with the rest of the Dinobots as

Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND.

Grimlock is like a "spooked horse"

refusing to be shut in the barn.

BLURR

(pleading with him, shoving

him, talking very, very

rapidly)

Nice Dino, good, Dino, sweet Dino! Won't

you step into the nice spaceship for

Blurr? Please, pretty please.

GRIMLOCK

(sticking head out past

struggling Blurr)

Me, Grimlock, not "nice Dino!" Me bash

brains!

GRIMLOCK

He gives FIRE BREATHING BLAST AT JETS as

they go by STRAFING THE

ULTRA MAGNUS

as Kup, Hot Rod and Arcee MOVE INTO SCENE

BEHIND HIM

ULTRA MAGNUS

Kup, Hot Rod. Get the Dinobots out of

here!

45.

ON SCOURGE

as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and

shouts orders, FIRING AT Blurr who BLURRS

PAST and then at Arcee who also SHIPS BY

SCOURGE

No survivors!

KUP

This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9,

when the Petro-Rabbits were...(annoyed)

Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!

(starts throwing switches)

GRIMLOCK

Me, Grimlock, love Kup's war stories!

KUP

You're living one now!

(to Hot Rod)

Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake!

Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand

over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW

AND PULSE with the action.

ANOTHER ANGLE

as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and

SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW, sending tongues

of fire running across the glass behind

Hot Rod's head

HOT ROD

You got 'em!

BACK TO KUP AND GRIMLOCK

GRIMLOCK

(to Kup)

Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again.

(CONTINUED)

46.

KUP

(muttering, using joystick)

I'll give you Petro-Rabbits. Contact!

The Shuttle lurches and shakes

HOT ROD (V.O.)

Yaaaaaaaaho! We're airborne!

GRIMLOCK (V.O.)

Groooooowwwwwrrrr!

CYCLONUS

Vaporize them!

CUT TO:

SPRINGER

(to Daniel)

Looks like we're shipmates, squirt!

DANIEL

All right!

SPRINGER

But if you get space sick, you're gonna

walk home.

ULTRA MAGNUS

Hurry!

(CONTINUED)

47.

SPRINGER

Jump.

ON ARCEE

still going up the ramp while the

shuttle slowly leaves the ground.

DANIEL

That was close!

SPRINGER

Believe it or not, this is the fun part.

ULTRA MAGNUS

No time to preheat....Can this ship take

it?

PERCEPTOR

With an accelerated ignition procedure

the ceramic housings might create a

magnetic flux.

ULTRA MAGNUS

(baffled)

What?

SPRINGER

(ENTERING SHOT, reaches in and

pushes joystick forward)

He says "go for it!"

48.

HOT ROD

gives the thumbs up gesture.

ANOTHER ANGLE

INCLUDING Ultra Magnus' shuttle through

side port as Springer gives thumbs up

signal in return and Daniel waves

ON SPRINGER

as he turns and reacts, looking straight

up and ahead

SPRINGER

It ought to be smooth sailin' from here

on in.

ASTROTRAIN

Fuse them!

KUP

(using intercom)

Ultra Magnus...what next?

ULTRA MAGNUS

Remember what we did off Beta Four!

(CONTINUED)

49.

KUP

I remember it well.

GALVATRON'S SHIPS

which swerve to avoid them as....

GALVATRON'S SHIP

emerges from the chaos.

CYCLONUS

The explosions jammed my sensors.

(pause)

I have lost track of the Autobots!

50.

GALVATRON

Damn it!! They did the same thing to me

off Beta four!

DISSOLVE TO:

SHUTTLE

Possible song - optimistic adventure with

the suggestion that all dreams might not

happen.

ULTRA MAGNUS (V.O.)

Congratulations Autobots, we've lost 'em

at least for a while. So rest up. We'll

refuel on the Junk Planet and work out

our battle plan there.

KUP

Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off

Beta 4 had to use windshield wipers on

your optic sensors....

GRIMLOCK

(impatiently)

Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers! Want

to hear good part of story!

SWOOP

(beating wings rapidly,

excitedly)

Good part, Kup! Tell Swoop good part!

SLUDGE

SLAG

(excitedly)

(beating tail on Unh unh unh....

floor) Good part...tell

(CONTINUED)

51.

KUP

Okay, Okay. The dust was really thick

and then this gigantic Ick Yak...

HOT ROD

Don't you think we have better things to

do now than tell stories Kup?

KUP

Like what?

HOT ROD

Like maybe figure out how we're gonna

stay alive.

DINOBOTS

(ALL SHUSH HIM)

As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant "sees"

its opening and gives Hot Rod a swift

kick in the rear, sending him flying

(o.s.)

HOT ROD

(continuing)

Time out, for Cybertron's sake!

BACK TO SCENE

(CONTINUED)

52.

AUTO COMBATANT

(mechanically, quickly)

Time out, time out, time out! Suddenly,

the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS

and flames shoot out of large hole in

wall

ULTRA MAGNUS

Kup! Raise your force fields at once!

They're armed with.....

ULTRA MAGNUS (V.O.)

Moleculon Missiles!

HOT ROD

They're closing on us!

KUP

Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon!

HOT ROD

Yeah, how'd you beat them?

KUP

I'm trying to remember...there were an

awful lot of casualties that day...

(CONTINUED)

53.

KUP (O.S.)

Oh yeah, we inversed polarities.

HOT ROD (O.S.)

That'll tear the ship apart!

KUP (O.S.)

You got a better idea?!! With that, the

ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid

air! The missiles zoom past it.

HOT ROD

Okay, so you were right.

KUP

Don't run your programs until they're

debugged.

HOT ROD

They're coming back.

KUP

Let's just hope we've screwed up their

trajectories.

HOT ROD

Whew!!!

(CONTINUED)

54.

KUP

Yep, I thought we'd had it that time for

sure.

HOT ROD

Dive!

ANOTHER ANGLE

crushing the area between Hot Rod and

Kup.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SPRINGER

Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!

ULTRA MAGNUS

I can't deal with that now.

(CONTINUED)

55.

SPRINGER

Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're

gonna dog us until they see us dead!

Ultra Magnus nods solemnly

ULTRA MAGNUS

(cryptic)

Then that's exactly what they're gonna

see.

CUT TO:

ON GALVATRON

as he works controls which eject more

Moleculon Missiles.

CYCLONUS

The Autobots have been terminated!

GALVATRON

Excellent. And soon we shall say the

same of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly,

Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he

writhes in pain.

GALVATRON (CONT)

Aaaah!   Take me to Unicron...Aaaah!

(CONTINUED)

56.

ARCEE

Did we have to detonate three- quarters

of the ship?!

SPRINGER

Seeing how they would have detonated four

quarters, I think it was a good choice.

SUDDEN SHUDDER AND THE SHIP DROPS

SHARPLY, all holding on to each other and

to any protruding handhold

ULTRA MAGNUS

Perceptor....can you still locate the

Junk Planet?

PERCEPTOR

Gamma waves in this sector of space

create marginal navigation probabilities,

however.....

(looks at Ultra Magnus)

ULTRA MAGNUS

Holds his head in his hands as Springer

grimaces

PERCEPTOR

Ahem.....yes I think I can.

CUT TO:

HOT ROD

still cartwheeling down toward the planet

below, trying to change the angle of his

fall

57.

HOT ROD

(bubbling, filtered voice)

Kup....Grimlock?   Slag!....Anybody? WE

FOLLOW him through undersea world as he

rounds a "corner" of the Reef Wall and

reacts

HOT ROD

Kup!

THE SQUID

angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.

HOT ROD

Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of

tentacles, but the squid keeps coming...

THE SQUID

releases a laser print ink stream which

boils out in the water in a series of

dots and "x" shapes and retreats.

HOT ROD

Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.

(CONTINUED)

58.

HOT ROD

lowers his head and blows blast of air

through head-piece. The air blast clears

the water, revealing Kup's head and torso

half buried in the "sand"

HOT ROD

Kup!   Say something!

KUP

(bubbling as he speaks)

Fix me!

HOT ROD

Sure, Kup....right away! Hot Rod rapidly

PULLS KUP'S SCATTERED BODY PARTS

TOGETHER.

CUT TO:

HOT ROD

Well...what do you think? Kup feels his

elbow joint, twists his neck side to side

and gets creaks and squeaks and moves

legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying

himself out.

KUP

(a beat, then grimaces)

There's a piece missing.

HOT ROD

No way....

(sifts through pile of SCRAP

METAL PARTS lying at Kup's

feet)

See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind

of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this

doohickey looks like a funky energon

funnel... and this...

(CONTINUED)

59.

KUP

(moving up and back, bending

arms and hands, CREAKING,

CLUNKING, SQUEAKING)

Well, I still think I'm short a part!

(sees Hot Rod hang his head)

But all things considered, you did an

amazing job, lad! Amazing!

HOT ROD

(brightening)

Really?

KUP

(rotates arm rapidly)

Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on

my rotator! Now, let's find the Dinos

and get off this twisted planet!

ON KUP

as he transforms it's evident that a

fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted

improperly so it wobbles and he rides

unevenly with much chugging and oil

spewing

KUP (V.O.)

(in vehicular mode)

Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin'

dim-wittery... I told you a part was

missin'.

DISSOLVE TO:

KUP

Don't act hostile. I'll use the

universal greeting.

(CONTINUED)

60.

HOT ROD

Universal Greeting.

KUP

Watch.   I'll have them eating out of my

hand.

HOT ROD

Or our faces.

KUP

Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...

HOT ROD

(mocking, mimicking)

Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...

The Sharkticons look interested.

KUP

See, the Universal Greeting works every

time.

(pause)

Now, without making any sudden moves,

give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches

into his belt, presses a button and pulls

out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat

suspicious of the whole process does the

came.

HOT ROD

This is getting expensive.

KUP

Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They

each hand out three Energon goodies to

the remaining six Sharkticons... The

Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they

back off, eyeing the two Autobots with

menace.

(CONTINUED)

61.

HOT ROD

I thought they were supposed to

reciprocate.

KUP

(not sure of himself)

Customs vary from place to place.

Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to

their vicious mode and lunge at them.

THE QUINTESSONS

slender, spindly framed robotic creatures

with oversized five sided heads, each

side bearing a different mechanistic face

with a different expression on each -

smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and

the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As

Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death

in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh,

dissonant, metallic and terrifying music

plays, underscoring the brutal evil they

face,

KUP (V.O.)

Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on

Golgonath Seven....

HOT ROD

Every place reminds you of some place

else.....

KUP (V.O.)

Experience, lad. You should learn to

appreciate it.

HOT ROD

A lot of good it's done us so far!

62.

HOT ROD

I can't transform!

KUP

They're restraining bolts, lad.

HOT ROD

(looking around)

We got to get a new travel agent....

What is this place?

KRANIX

The world of the savage Sharkticons and

their cruel masters the Quintessons.

They hunt down those who try to escape

the wrath of Unicron, and put them on

trial.

KUP

But what if they're innocent?

KRANIX

Guilty or innocent, the sentence is

always the same - death!

HOT ROD

Unicron?!    Who's Unicron?

(CONTINUED)

63.

KRANIX

A planet six times the size of this one

that absorbs everything in its path.

KUP

So that's the monster's name.

HOT ROD

I wonder if there's any connection

between it and Galvatron.

QUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)

That one!

QUINTESSON GUARD

Soon, you too shall receive your

sentence.

LEAD QUINTESSON

Jury, have you reached a verdict?

JUROR #1

We have your honor.

LEAD QUINTESSON

(to jury of Quintessons)

Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.

KRANIX

Spare me this mockery of justice.

LEAD QUINTESSON

I repeat, guilty...or innocent.

JURORS

Guilty!!

(CONTINUED)

64.

KUP

Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

DISSOLVE TO:

DANIEL

Where are we, Springer?

SPRINGER

The place where everything ends up after

you throw it out.

ULTRA MAGNUS

Brace for impact!

65.

SPRINGER

(pulling himself free of hull

wall)

Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a

raise... Daniel creeps out from under

Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and

dust off his shoulders

DANIEL

Wow! That was better'n the Roller

Coaster at Future World!

PERCEPTOR

(working scanner, computer

device, thoughtfully)

The composition of this planet seems to

be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous

and non-ferrous articulations.

ULTRA MAGNUS

(baffled)

How's that?

SPRINGER

(opening hull door with a

RIPPING OF METAL)

He says the planet's made of junk.

SPRINGER

Yep, this dump is a dump......

ULTRA MAGNUS

as he straps on TOOL BELT

ULTRA MAGNUS

We might be able to salvage this thing.

(checks LASER DRILL, turns it

on, off)

Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by

Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt

and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans

as Daniel moves out to join them

(CONTINUED)

66.

DANIEL

Can I help, too?

SPRINGER

It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside

and play with crayons or something.

ARCEE

as she steps forward with a smile, a

strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand

ARCEE

I think Daniel can make himself useful

with....this! It used to be Spike's.

(holds Grid-like metal frame

"suit")

DANIEL

Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about

it but I never saw it.

ARCEE

Here, try it on.

ON DANIEL

as he gets inside the "suit" which fits

over his body like a grid-work metal

"cage."

SPRINGER

Just think about what you want to do

before you do it!

DANIEL

brows knitted, thinking.

SPRINGER

Don't fight it Dan-O.

(CONTINUED)

67.

DANIEL

(continuing)

It's kind of tricky....

ARCEE

For the first time out, you were great!

SPRINGER

Show time's over! We've got work to do!

(he starts out)

DANIEL (V.O.)

(whistles)

This must be the junk capital of the

universe!

WRECK-GAR

(in guttural, rusty, metallic

rumble)

Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, "hello

stranger!" that good coffee flavor

OTHER JUNKIONS

Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows

large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor

sharp fins and rusty little rocket

missiles mounted around the howitzer like

barrel

WRECK-GAR

Operators are standing by! They laugh in

guttural, clanking sounds and look out at

Springer and the others who keep working

as we

QUINTESSON

Greetings, noble strangers.

GRIMLOCK

Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock

search for friends.

QUINTESSON

And who might they be?

GRIMLOCK

Autobots.    Hot Rod and Kup.

QUINTESSON

(feigning recognition)

Oh yes. A young one and an old one.

GRIMLOCK

Yes.   You know friends.   Where are they?

QUINTESSON

They went down that path. He points to...

A PATH

It probably isn't lined with primroses,

but it should be.

GRIMLOCK

GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock.    I

reward you, sometime.

69.

GALVATRON

Why do you torture me?!

UNICRON

You have failed.

GALVATRON

No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.

UNICRON

Then where is the matrix?

GALVATRON

Destroyed, with him.

UNICRON

The matrix can not be destroyed.

(pause)

And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of

Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And

bring the matrix to me.

GRIMLOCK

Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium

salami! Slag gets up...

SLAG

Beryllium balony!

GRIMLOCK

Argh!

GRIMLOCK

Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap

model.

SLAG

Like your head! (laughs at own joke)

Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him

to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY

CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.

71.

SQUEAKY VOICE (WHEELIE)

Friends find. Look behind.

GRIMLOCK

cackle)

Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie

KUP

Remember when you put me together today?

HOT ROD

Sure, that's all I got to think about.

KUP

I know what part you forgot.

QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.)

Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of

this court.

HOT ROD

I have nothing but contempt for this

court.

That doohickey you lost was part of my

without it, I'm double jointed as

Houdini.

HOT ROD

Wish you'd figured that out a little

sooner.

KUP

Better late than never!

HOT ROD

They've got more Sharkticons than we have

photon charges!

KUP

Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he

roars into a bunch of them, slamming a

massive stack into the wall.

HOT ROD

Didn't even bend a fender.

(CONTINUED)

74.

KUP

Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of

those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things.

HOT ROD

We can't hold out forever, but we can

give them one whopper of a repair bill.

DINOBOTS (O.S.)

GRIMLOCK

Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller

Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his

teeth, realizes that he's a second

stringer, and scampers away.

GRIMLOCK

Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag

barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick

shishkebob out of them, while...

THE SHARKTICONS

suddenly back off and begin transforming

HOT ROD

I never thought I'd be so happy to see

those big bozos.

GRIMLOCK

Me Grimlock no bozo.   Me king!

QUINTESSON JUDGE

Sharkticons! Execute them.

GRIMLOCK

Me Grimlock say execute them.

THE SHARKTICONS

for a brief instant, don't seem to know

what to do. Then, they charge the

Quintessons.

THE CHASE

The Quintessons start to flee, but it's

clear that the Sharkticons, who climb

over the stacked bodies of other

Sharkticons, are going to catch them.

KUP

I think the problems on this planet will

be solved very shortly.

HOT ROD

But what about our problems.    We need a

It can't be....it's.....Hot Rod!     He's

alive!

DANIEL

as he looks up at passing Cruiser and

waves

DANIEL

And Kup and the Dinobots!    We're saved!

87.

PERCEPTOR

I wouldn't count on that!

(indicating Junkions)

KUP

Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero

have I seen such a sight....

GRIMLOCK

Maybe they make me king, too!

KUP

Don't hold your breath, your majesty.

WRECK-GAR

as he watches Cruiser descend and start

gliding in for a landing

WRECK-GAR

Steady as she goes, mob! Snoopy visitors

get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film

at five!

(gives thumbs up sign, RIDES

OFF)

JUNKIONS

Everything must go by midnight! With a

SINGING ROAR of musical, tribal

excitement, the Junkions sweep Springer

and our friends along with them,

following course of landing Cruiser to

ON DOORWAY

as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and

hand full of energon sticks followed by a

very wary Kup, and the Dinobots with

Wheelie riding Sludge's neck.

HOT ROD

(aside to Kup, still holding

smile)

Guns aren't exactly friendly.

KUP

(through his teeth to Hot Rod)

Neither are they in case you haven't

noticed.

HOT ROD

(sotto)

What was the Universal greeting again?

WRECK-GAR

growls and slips a SNIPPER, BLOW TORCH

CUTTING TOOL out of a holster and starts

toward Hot Rod with it

HOT ROD

HOT ROD

(big smile)

Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

WRECK-GAR

Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

HOT ROD

(nodding, smiling)

Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

89.

HOT ROD (CONT'D)

(presses energon sticks

forward)

As Hot Rod says this...

EVERYBODY

Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah

weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong! Bah

weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong....

WRECK-GAR

hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces

and tries to enjoy it, and then hugs

Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing and

dancing as SINGING goes.

ON GRIMLOCK

as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his leg

GRIMLOCK

Yuck! Me Grimlock, not a kisser!   Me,

Grimlock, a king!

WHEELIE

claps his hands and gleefully makes

noises as he hops about, dancing with

Junkions until we CUT TO

WRECK-GAR

as he stands on top of platform and RINGS

JUNK BELLS AND SIRENS getting silence and

smiling as he waves hands all around

WRECK-GAR

Have a nice day and please, close cover

before striking, friends! Amigos, buddies

and side kicks, Breep drit, aw rootie! So

say the Junkions!

(holds hands over his head)

HOT ROD

Where did you learn to talk like that?

90.

THE WATCHMAN

On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial.

WRECK-GAR

We talk T.V. You talk some T.V.?

KUP

looks around nervously.

KUP

I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the

news. Don't touch that dial. Void where

prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly while

the Dinobots react with uncertainty

WRECK-GAR

By George kimosabes your smashed up,

blotto friend, soon like brand new with

ninety day warranty all iciban parts and

labor is!

WRECK-GAR

Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do!

SPRINGER AND OTHERS

(Ad lib jubilation)

Ultra Magnus!

ULTRA MAGNUS

You're all alive...

(CONTINUED)

91.

HOT ROD

The matrix!

ULTRA MAGNUS

It's gone...

KUP

And with it, all hope.

HOT ROD

No...

(inspired)

The matrix will not fail us.

ARCEE

Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus. We don't

have it anymore. Galvatron does.

HOT ROD

Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and

no matter what they odds, destroy

Unicron.

ON WRECK-GAR

His eyes light up.

WRECK-GAR

Yeah! Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand

poobah.... Flush cosmic troubles down the

drain.

JUNKIONS

(almost chanting)

Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand

poobah... Flush cosmic troubles down the

drain.

SPRINGER

Listen,   I don't want to rain on anybody's

parade,   but how are we going to move the

army to   Unicron. We don't have enough

room on   that ship.

(CONTINUED)

92.

WRECK-GAR

No fuss, no muss.

(to others)

Hurry, hurry. Sale must end! Rush right

on down to bridge and test drive latest

with no obligation.

ULTRA MAGNUS

You have ships here?

WRECK-GAR

New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek

sexy import with turbo handling.

SPRINGER

What's he talking about?

SPRINGER

This is what I call traveling in style.

DISSOLVE TO:

GALVATRON (V.O.)

Listen to me, or suffer the consequences.

UNICRON

Aren't we getting pompous?

GALVATRON

I now possess that which you most fear.

Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks

the surface of the planet, knocking

Galvatron to his knees.

GALVATRON

You will do my bidding, or... Unicron

roars with laughter.

(CONTINUED)

93.

GALVATRON

...taste my wrath.

UNICRON

You underestimate me Galvatron.

UNICRON

For a time, I considered sparing your

measly little planet, but now you shall

witness its dismemberment!

94.

GALVATRON

No!!!

SHOCKWAVE

Decepticons...we're under

attack...Scramble - Then his voice is cut

off as...

95.

GALVATRON

GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you fools!

CUT TO:

HOT ROD

I don't believe it.

DANIEL

Wow!

HOT ROD (V.O.)

Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup?

KUP

(entranced)

Nope, never seen anything like it.

(CONTINUED)

96.

HOT ROD

I knew there had to be a first time....

(using intercom)

Battle stations!

UNICRON'S CHEST

Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his

neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up

at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's

chest...

97.

WRECK-GAR (V.O.)

Patented enamel resists fire, rain and

corrosion. Five year warranty,

satisfaction guaranteed.

OTHER JUNKIONS

Or your money back!

CLOSER

... tears it in half.

WRECK-GAR (V.O.)

Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable. And

for a limited time we include...

WRECK-GAR (CONT'D)

Free bonus surprise!

JUNKIONS

Free bonus surprise!

PERCEPTOR (V.O.)

Most unscientific, but... effective.

98.

THE CRUISER

Is suddenly struck by a ray from

Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked

off.

UNICRON (V.O.)

Graaaaaaaaaaa!

DANIEL

Where's Hot Rod?

SPRINGER

Sees something in the distance.

(CONTINUED)

99.

SPRINGER

I don't know, but I hope they didn't get

him.

KUP

Debugoids!

ARCEE

Quick!   This way.

CUT TO:

HOT ROD

The Autobot Matrix!

GALVATRON

It will do you no good, Autobot.   It

cannot be opened.

(CONTINUED)

100.

HOT ROD

Not by a Decepticon.

GALVATRON

It is strange that we should find

ourselves as allies...

ON GALVATRON

Suddenly, his body is violently twisted,

and his arms are almost broken off.

GALVATRON

Uhhhh...

UNICRON

Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from

limb to limb.

GALVATRON

Of course, my master!

ON GALVATRON

He peers into the gloom.

ON GALVATRON

Weapon drawn.

GALVATRON

Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's

courage. There is no response.

CUT TO:

ASSORTED SHOTS

Unicron now stands atop Cybertron,

fighting the various ships that swarm

around him like bees. ... Rays streak

from his one good eye. ...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

101.

ASSORTED SHOTS (CONT'D)

His hands smash fighters... ... Fire

shoots from his mouth.

THE DINOBOTS

Now reaching Unicron's butt, start

kicking.

GRIMLOCK

Me Grimlock kick Butt.

GRIMLOCK

Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.

CUT TO:

DANIEL

He looks o.s. towards the others.

DANIEL

Help...

ARCEE

Daniel!

102.

DANIEL

I'm okay.    They don't even see me.

KUP

They must not programmed to catch flesh

creatures.

SPRINGER

Us, on the other hand...

ARCEE

Daniel... Try to find help! Arcee

fires...

CUT TO:

103.

UNICRON'S STOMACH

This is the central processing area for

Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long

conveyer belt drops junk into a clear,

bubbling vat, where it is separated into

raw material and energy. The energy,

which comes out in raw form, goes into a

machine and is crunched into energon

cubes, while the solid material, is

separated into it's component metals and

plastics, formed into ingots and sent

elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.

DANIEL

watches this with awe until he sees...

ON DANIEL

He dashes to the shores of the glowing

lake...

DANIEL

Cliffjumper! Jazz!

DANIEL

Bumblebee!     Dad!

SPIKE

Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel

looks around.

(CONTINUED)

104.

A CONTROL

..     which controls the whole thing.

ON DANIEL

He runs up a catwalk towards it....

DANIEL

What do I do? It doesn't have any

buttons or anything.

SPIKE

Shoot it, Son.

DANIEL

But I don't have a gun.

SPIKE

Use your exo-suit.

CLIFFJUMPER

Hurry!

DANIEL

Starts frying the command console!

(CONTINUED)

105.

DANIEL

I can't stop it!

DANIEL

turns around and sees this.

DANIEL

Dad!

SPIKE

Son.

SPIKE

You did it!

CUT TO:

GALVATRON

Come out, Autobot. We all must die

sometime.

GALVATRON

stumbles backward.

(CONTINUED)

106.

GALVATRON

No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot

Rod transforms back to car and tries to

race away... ... Galvatron jumps after

him and catches him... ... Hot Rod,

nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to

humanoid mode.

GALVATRON

First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now

you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily

or I might have a sense of satisfaction

now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls

at Galvatron's hands...

WRECK-GAR

Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk.

HOT ROD

Gasps.

GALVATRON

Die!

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead,

spring to life for a moment and grasp the

Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's

chest.

107.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A miraculous transformation takes place.

... Hot Rod begins to grow at an

alarming rate. ... Age shows on his

face. ... He is stronger and wiser.

OPTIMUS PRIME

Arise, Rodimus Prime.

HOT ROD

Optimus!

GALVATRON

Nooooooo!

HOT ROD

This is the end of the road, Galvatron.

With that, he picks up the Decepticon and

throws him through...

CUT TO:

108.

CUT TO:

SPRINGER

I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he

looks up and sees one of the creatures

explode above

SPRINGER

That's what I call the nick of time.

(CONTINUED)

109.

JAZZ

Let's burn rubber!

KUP

I knew you had potential, lad!

RODIMUS PRIME

Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus

Prime transforms into truck mode as the

other Autobots also transform. Daniel

and Spike jump into him. Then, in a

continuous line, he shoots off, the other

Autobots racing behind him.

SMASH CUT:

110.

DISSOLVE TO:

RODIMUS PRIME

Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian

wars as we move forward to a new age of

peace and happiness....

ALL

Until all are one!
