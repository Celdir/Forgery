EARLY DRAFT

August 11, 1999

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is

restricted to first cl...

JAMES EARL JONES

Is this what you're looking for?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there

anything I can get you?

JAMES EARL JONES

Scotch, blended. Straight.

PASQUAL

(tentatively)

They say birds can't fly this high.

JAMES EARL JONES

They say only angels can.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Shall I pour your scotch?

JAMES EARL JONES

No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.

JAMES EARL JONES

Ah, c-5. The most dangerous

explosive material ever invented.

Hard to believe that this little

contraption could blow up ten city

blocks.

PASQUAL

Be careful with it, huh?

(CONTINUED)

JAMES EARL JONES

Another movie from an old TV show?

PASQUAL

Well, what're you gonna do?

JAMES EARL JONES

Walk out.

PASQUAL

That's very funny.

JAMES EARL JONES

No.   It isn't.

JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)

EVERYONE!   FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!

JAMES EARL JONES

(over the rushing wind)

PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE

COMPANY.

PASQUAL

WHAT?

(CONTINUED)

PASQUAL

You crazy bastard!

JAMES EARL JONES

I think you mean crazy bitch.

DYLAN

(still with James Earl Jones' voice)

Don't need this anymore.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

(now in her real voice)

But I sure could use this.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Damn I hate to fly.

(CONTINUED)

BOSLEY

Well, Angels, the experimental

explosives are back in the hands of

the government, and the free world

can breathe just a lit-tle bit

easier tonight, thanks to you three.

NATALIE

And thanks to you, too, Bos.

ALEX

We couldn't have redirected the

flight path without your help.

BOSLEY

Nothing a little teamwork can't do.

At least, that's what Charlie's

always telling us, right ladies?

DYLAN

Charlie will be joining us, won't he?

BOSLEY

He sends his regrets. But he

wanted you to know that dinner is

on him, so feel free to celebrate.

ALEX

If it's on Charlie, we will.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Once upon a time...

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

... there were three very

different little girls.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Who grew up into three very

different women.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

With three things in common...

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

They're brilliant. They're

beautiful. And they work for me.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

My name is Charlie.

"CHARLIE'S ANGELS"

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

Hi.

(recognizing voice)

Hi.   Okay. I'll be right in.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Not him.   Not him, not him, not him.

THE VOICE

'Morning starfish.

DYLAN

Oh God no.

CHAD

Hungry?

CHAD

C'mon Dylan. You + Me. It's

magic.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

It's a mistake. A horrible,

horrible mistake.

CHAD

Then how come we keep getting back

together? It's fate.

CHAD

(yelling after)

Is it because I live on a boat?

WHIP TO:

ALEX (O.S.)

If you don't defuse this bomb,

Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new

underwater attraction.

JASON

Get off my back, Sanchez.   I know

what I'm doing.

ALEX

Which wire?   The red one or the blue one?

JASON

Marix has a thing for red. Red

cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.

ALEX

So the red one.

JASON

That's why I'm gonna say blue.

ALEX

You saved the world again, Logan.

(CONTINUED)

JASON

That's my job.

JASON (CONT'D)

I don't think Sanchez would kiss

me. He's a forty-year-old man.

ALEX

Let's have it rewritten.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Hello?

JASON

So when you coming back?

ALEX

Not sure.   Whenever I can.      I'll

call you.

JASON

Oh, great, that's helpful.

(watching her prepare to go)

I don't get it, what kind of

executive assistant is on 24 hour call?

ALEX

A very good one.

JASON

You ask me, your boss is an asshole.

(beat)

When do I get to meet this Charlie

guy, anyway?

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Charlie's not very social.

JASON

Yeah, well I think you should

quit.

ALEX

Charlie needs me.

JASON

I need you.

P.A.

Mr. Gibbons?   We're ready for you

on the set.

JASON

I gotta go save the world.

ALEX

My hero.

BOB

(freaked)

What!   Natalie, what?

NATALIE

I thought you were dead.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

I thought the police might be here.

Or your neighbors. Or your parents,

here to identify your remains.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I saw your car was here, so I knew

you weren't carjacked and brutally

beaten, left to die on the highway.

BOB

I'm not...

NATALIE

(answering phone)

Hello. Absolutely. I'll be right in.

BOB

I'm not dead.

NATALIE

But you can understand why I

thought so. You missed our date

last night. You didn't call or

anything. I was just sitting

there by myself.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality

and attendance, those rank very high

in my list of dating priorities.

BOB

I can explain.

BLONDE

Bobby?

BOB

(to Natalie)

I can explain.

(CONTINUED)

ISAAC HAYES

Bobby?

BOB

Damn.

CUT TO:

NATALIE

Just once, I want to date a normal

man, without a wife, or a drug

addiction, or bondage issues.

DYLAN

Here here.

ALEX

What?    I've got a great relationship.

DYLAN

Your boyfriend thinks you're a

secretary.

ALEX

That way, he doesn't ask about my work.

NATALIE

I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made

enough for three.

BOSLEY

No, that's...That's okay.

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Good morning, Angels.

ANGELS

(sing-songy)

Good morning, Charlie.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

I'm sorry to call you back from

vacation, but we've got a case

that just can't wait.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Meet Eric Knox.

NATALIE

He's cute.

BOSLEY

He is.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

He's 28-years old, and in three days

he'll be a billionaire, when his

company, Knox Technologies, goes public.

DYLAN

It's good to be him.

ALEX

So what's the catch?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Last night, Knox was kidnapped

from his own office.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Any ransom?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

No one's heard a thing from the

kidnappers.

A WOMAN'S VOICE

They don't want money. They just

want to sink our company.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice

president of finance for Knox

Technologies. She's hired us to

find Knox.

VIVIAN WU

(entering)

The initial public offering is in

three days. If we don't get Mr.

Knox back, or if word gets out

that he's missing, the company

stands to lose a billion dollars.

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

We need your help.

ALEX

Charlie, where do we start?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Alex, I want you and Bosley to

stake out Roger Corwin.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

For the past year, he's been

trying to buy Knox's company and

their new browser software. Knox

refused to sell. His company, Red

Start Systems, has the most to

gain from Knox's disappearance.

ALEX

Kidnap the founder and you sink

the company.

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes

on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is

still alive, Corwin might lead us

to him.

DYLAN

We're on it.

NATALIE

Any chance you can join us,

Charlie?

CUT TO:

CHARLIE (O.S.)

I'd love to, angels, but I've got

my hands full this morning.

WIPE TO:

ALEX

This is a transmitter. I'll be

able to hear everything you say.

BOSLEY

Where do I hide it?

(leaning close)

I'll be nude.

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Try to get Corwin to talk about

the industry, Knox, anything.

BOSLEY

Understood.

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

I'm going undercover.

ALEX

I know.   You'll do great.

BOSLEY

Hot in here, isn't it?

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

Just came here to unwind a little.

Business these days is go go go. My

company just held an initial pubic offering.

(CONTINUED)

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

(re-composed)

So, what business are you in?

CORWIN

Computers.   Software.

BOSLEY

Computers, hunh? What do you know

about this new browser from Knox

Technologies?

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

Word on the street is, once they

raise capital, they'll rule the

industry.

CORWIN

I don't see that happening.

BOSLEY

Really?   Why not?

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

Nice talking with you.

MASSEUSE

(German accent)

Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.

ALEX

You're carrying a lot of tension

along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae.

Let me see if I can vork it out.

ALEX (CONT'D)

The human body is an amazing instrument.

Just by activating ze right energy

points, you can improve ze circulation,

alleviate pain, or...

ALEX (CONT'D)

(losing the accent)

... knock a man unconscious.

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

You must have dozed off.

CUT TO:

NATALIE

Can you not drive my car so fast,

Dyl? I'm trying to type.

DYLAN

(to Alex, under her breath)

I drive too fast. Look who's talking.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Three double doubles, animal style.

Fries. Three chocolate shakes.

NATALIE

Here's Corwin's itinerary.

TUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL

THURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY

DYLAN

Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight.

I only wish we had a clue to go on.

NATALIE

Hold that thought.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment.

DYLAN

Sorry.

NATALIE

Check this out. New program I just

got from a friend in the Bureau. We

take that footage from the kidnapping...

NATALIE (CONT'D)

... isolate the part of the suspect's

face that's revealed, then retriangulate

his bone structure...

NATALIE (CONT'D)

... and voila!     We've got a composite.

DYLAN

Sweet. Now we've got someone to

look for.

ALEX

Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot

with that open head wound.

WIPE TO:

DYLAN

The average investor sees technology

stocks as discrete entities, "This one is

up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's

only through derivative analysis that one

sees the real power of that sector.

BROKER GUY

Which analysis method do you prefer?

DYLAN

Well, there are so many options.

I mean, who can say what the one

best choice is?

NATALIE

Keppler-Wilson.

DYLAN

For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a

strong choice.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Thanks.

NATALIE

Anytime.

(CONTINUED)

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Anytime what?

NATALIE

(covering)

Anytime, day or night, I am... excited

... to be handing out champagne.

DYLAN

He's cute.

NATALIE

I'm working.

DYLAN

Sixty-five percent of relationships

begin in the workplace.

NATALIE

He's a bartender. I need dependable.

I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.

NATALIE

Miss!   Miss!   I'd love some champagne.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

(to Natalie)

Why don't you get some more?

(CONTINUED)

PETE

Sorry.

NATALIE

What are you reading?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

That's the new Michio Kazura.

That's not even out in America.

PETE

You know Michio Kazura?

NATALIE

Hello?    Warriors of the Broken Earth?   Classic.

PETE

I know. I just moved back from

Tokyo. It was the biggest thing

since Haikiri Nomura.

NATALIE

Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen!

PETE

Nagada quing-gong ni.     Ni zeru.

DYLAN

Ask him out.   Ask him out.

NATALIE

I'm Natalie.

PETE

Pete.    Good to meet you.

NATALIE

Listen, there's an animation festival

at the Egyptian this week. I was

wondering if you might want to...

PETE

Tomorrow night? Eight o'clock?

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

I'll meet you there.

DYLAN

Pardon me.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Natalie.   Nine o'clock. Thin man.

NATALIE

I'm on it.

NATALIE

(offering)

Vegetarian spring roll?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

(to earpiece)

Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder.

DYLAN

You call it.

NATALIE

You take point. I'll circle behind.

DYLAN

Copy.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

Excuse me?

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Excuse me, do you know which way

the ladies' room is?

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Why do they always run?

DYLAN

He's going down.

NATALIE

That way.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

There are times I wish we carried

guns.

DYLAN

Where's the challenge in that?

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Hey!    Hands off, assh....

NATALIE

Okay, to summarize? Damn.

BOSLEY

Well.   That was easy.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

No, it wasn't.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I've seen this before, he's

scrambling his calls through a

secondary location.

BOSLEY

In English?

NATALIE

We need to tap this phone line

at the source, THEN we'll know

where his calls were coming from.

DYLAN

(checking out the numbers)

503?   That's not local, where is it?

NATALIE

Bos, can we check a directory?

ALEX

Don't bother. I know where it is.

I used to spend every winter there.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Hey look!   Mechanical bull.

DYLAN

Eyes on the prize, Nat.   We gotta

tap the phones.

ALEX

That looks like our target.

ALEX (CONT'D)

I'm gonna need a distraction.

DYLAN

I think that can be arranged.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Three shots of tequila, please.

(Bosley whispers in her ear)

And one Tom Collins.

REDNECK

Hey baby, why don't you ditch that

stiff and come sit on ma lap?

DYLAN

Ooh, that is an enticing offer.

But I got a better idea. How

about a shot contest? My treat?

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Bartender?

Bring ten shots of tequila over to my

table. And keep em coming.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Mind if I try?

DYLAN

Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's

have a chair throwing contest.

REDNECK

Hunh?

DYLAN

Chair throwing? Never heard of

it? You just pick up your chair

and throw it as far as you can.

THUG ONE

We expecting somebody?

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

Guten Tag!

NATALIE

(correcting Dylan)

Guten Morgen!

DYLAN

(correcting Natalie)

Guten Nacht!

DYLAN AND NATALIE

(to each other)

Guten Freund!

THUG TWO

(low)

They got the wrong address.

THUG ONE

Shut up.

ALEX

Where's Knox?

KNOX

Who are you?

ALEX

The calvary.     Giddy up.

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Sorry.    Wrong room.

(to Knox)

Back!    Run!

BOSLEY

Alex, what's your status?

ALEX

Good news:   I found Knox.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Bad news:    I found company.

DYLAN

This way.

ALEX

They're coming after us.

DYLAN

(to Knox, confident)

We were expecting that.

NATALIE

Okay, new problem.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Thoughts, suggestions, points to

consider?

BOSLEY

I don't suppose giving up would

be a...

DYLAN

Right!

NATALIE

There is no right.

DYLAN

There!

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

Where are we?

ALEX

It's a bobsled run.

NATALIE

If it goes down the mountain,

that's all I need.

ALEX

(looking out the back)

Hard left! HARD LEFT!

KNOX

(to Dylan)

Is this part of the plan?

DYLAN

Yes. Except for the bobsled run,

and the backwards part, it's

going exactly according to plan.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

I think we're in the clear.

DYLAN

Or maybe not.

NATALIE

Oh God, no.

DYLAN

What is it?

NATALIE

I have a date with Pete.   Right now.

DYLAN

Ouch.

ALEX

HARD RIGHT!

DYLAN

Call him, he'll totally understand.

NATALIE

"Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a

billionaire."

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Hard left!

NATALIE

I'll sound like a flake.   I can't

stand flakes.

DYLAN

He will so give you the second chance.

NATALIE

You think?

DYLAN

Hello, I saw the way he looked at you.

ALEX

We're at the bottom!

DYLAN

(genuinely impressed)

Well done.

KNOX

Thanks.

CUT TO:

BOSLEY

I think that went very well. Charlie

should send me on more missions.

ALEX

We couldn't have done it without

you, Bos.

DYLAN

Cocktail?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Good work, Angels. Not only did you

save Knox, you saved his company as well.

DYLAN

I think that earns us a vacation.

NATALIE

Say, Fiji?

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

(to Natalie)

Any special guy you were thinking

of inviting?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only

half-done.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Meet your new client, Eric Knox.

KNOX

First off, thank you. You rescued

me, for which I am eternally grateful.

KNOX (CONT'D)

But there's still a problem. Whoever

kidnapped me wasn't just trying to

screw up our IPO. They also stole

the proprietary software for our new

web browser. I'm sure it was Roger

Corwin, but I need proof.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

That's where you come in, Angels.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

We need to break into Red Star's computer

systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is

indeed being converted for Red Star's use.

NATALIE

Sounds like a plan.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red

Star's headquarters are as tightly

guarded as a military facility.

We're going to need reconnaissance

on their mainframe computer system,

and the best way to get that is

through Mr. Corwin himself.

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

We need to pin a camera on him to get

footage of the inside of the building.

Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa,

we know that Corwin will be at the San

Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to

him Angels, but don't tip your hand.

ALEX

Consider it done.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr.

Knox's security. I'd hate to have him

kidnapped again.

DYLAN

Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer

if you could join us, Charlie.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a

bit over my head at the moment.

WIPE TO:

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

We're good.

DYLAN

I've got surveillance on all the windows.

Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.

DYLAN

Also, stay away from the windows.

KNOX

They're bullet-proof.   The last

owner was paranoid.

DYLAN

(a smile)

Lucky for us.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

This is a panic button.

(tosses it to him)

Press it and one of us can be here

in ten minutes.

KNOX

Which one of you?

DYLAN

Whoever's closest.

KNOX

I have a better idea.

DYLAN

What?

(CONTINUED)

KNOX

Stay for dinner.

(preempting objections)

I'm a pretty good cook.

DYLAN

I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry.     If you...

KNOX

(quickly)

I'm scared.

KNOX (CONT'D)

Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I

am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't

fun. I know, you probably have other

plans, but it would be very reassuring.

KNOX (CONT'D)

Come on, don't make me beg. I'm

embarrassed already.

DYLAN

Don't be.

DYLAN

That's you, hunh? Cute kid.    Cute

family.

KNOX

Thanks.

(taking the photo)

It's the only picture I have of me with

my parents. They died a week later.

DYLAN

Oh.   Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea...

(CONTINUED)

KNOX

Please, don't apologize. I was too

young to understand.

(looking at the photo)

I never knew how they died. When I

was a kid, when I got shuffled from

one foster home to another, I always

thought they just disappeared.

DYLAN

But...?

KNOX

I only found out later, my father was

in the military. He and my mother were

killed while he was on assignment,

somewhere in Eastern Europe.

(mostly to himself)

The files were classified, but I

read enough to know that he was a

good man. Apparently, he was

betrayed by one of his own team.

DYLAN

Wow.   That's a lot for a kid to live with.

KNOX

Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my

family. It still does. I don't take

anything for granted.

DYLAN

Boy did I have you pegged wrong.

KNOX

(intrigued)

How do you mean?

DYLAN

Well, to be honest, I thought you

were a rich kid who inherited

everything. But that's pretty typical.

I've got instincts for the job, but

when it comes to men? Well...

KNOX

I'm glad you don't see me as just a client.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

Oh.   Well, you ARE, so...

KNOX

Is there someone you need to be going

home to?

DYLAN

No.

(beat)

But I...

DYLAN (CONT'D)

I shouldn't.

KNOX

Shouldn't you?

DYLAN

(firmly)

No.   I shouldn't.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Thank you for dinner, Mr. Knox.    And

lock the door behind me.

CUT TO:

CORWIN

What the...?

(CONTINUED)

PIT BOSS

(yelling over the

engine noise)

NICE RACING!

(beat)

CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE NEVER RACED

THIS TRACK BEFORE!

NATALIE

(Texas accent)

BACK WHERE AH'M FROM, WE RACE IN SWAMPS

AND BACK ROADS! THIS ALL'S A PIECE A CAKE!

NATALIE (CONT'D)

I nicked him. Should give you

enough time to do the deed.

DYLAN

I'm on it.

CORWIN

LET'S GO!    WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!

THIN MAN

You okay, Boss?

(CONTINUED)

CORWIN

No thanks to you! You're supposed

to be my head of security! Who is

that bitch?!

THIN MAN

Don't know.   I'll keep an eye out.

CORWIN

Yeah.   You do that.

BOSLEY (O.S.)

Coast is clear, Dylan.

CUT TO:

BOSLEY

Let's make the switch.

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

TV ANCHOR VOICE

If you're just joining us, we're

approaching hour five of a pursuit

that has lead us all across the

Southland, at speeds up to 80

miles an hour.

FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE

Chuck, time and again we hear the

question, "Why don't the police just

ram the other car, or shoot out the

tires?" The LAPD has a policy of

hanging back and following unless...

TV ANCHOR VOICE

What was that?

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

KNOX

There!

KNOX (CONT'D)

That's the room with the

mainframe. Everything at Red Star

goes through that system.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

So if we want to find proof that

Red Star stole Knox's technology,

that's the computer to tap.

KNOX

Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls

and encryption. You can't jack in from

outside. You'll have to physically be

in that room to get at the data.

ALEX

Even if we do get inside, there won't

be time to search for it. There's got

to be a hundred terabytes of

information there. It could take days.

NATALIE

So you install a transmitter.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Patch in directly to the relay,

broadcast on a high frequency.

That way, you can have access to

the mainframe from the comfort of

your own home. And they have no

idea that you can peek inside.

(CONTINUED)

VIVIAN WU

That's all fine in theory. But you

still have to get inside that room

to install it. What about security?

ALEX

Red Star has a lot of Government

contracts, so security is tight. Key-

card badges throughout. Redundant

security at all red-line areas with

biometric scanners and weekly keycodes.

Pervasive video surveillance, lasers,

air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard-

wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent

exactly this kind of tapping.

VIVIAN WU

It sounds impossible.

DYLAN

It sounds like fun.

NATALIE (V.O.)

Only the two directors can disengage the

fail-safe. We have to get their keys.

(CONTINUED)

ALEX (V.O.)

Then we have to get back into Red

Star. Problem is, their biometric

sensors are too good.

DYLAN (V.O.)

We need someone's help.

WHIP TO:

A VOICE

Tommy? You gonna let me through

or what?

TOMMY THE GUARD

(confused)

Oh.     Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin.

CUT TO:

ALEX

It's done. Red Star's mainframe

is open for business.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

(to a passing waiter)

Champagne, please. Your best.

KNOX

Now I know why I hired you.   You're

the best.

VIVIAN WU

(to Knox, re: laptop)

I'll have Systems get to work on

this right away.

BOSLEY

Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to

work on this right away. Any evidence

we find will be turned over to you AND

the proper authorities.

VIVIAN WU

I don't think you understand how

important that data is, Mr...

BOSLEY

Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll

take very good care of it when I find it.

VIVIAN WU

(reaching for the laptop)

But...

KNOX

Vivian, please. Do as the man says.

DYLAN

Where you off to, Bos?

BOSLEY

Vacation.

NATALIE

Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to

chase bikinis at some tropical resort?

(CONTINUED)

BOSLEY

Exactly!   Fire Island, here I come!

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

Goodbye, Angels. Mr. Knox.

(coldly)

Ms. Wu.

KNOX

More champagne?

NATALIE

Have to go.   Plans tonight.

ALEX

Me too.

KNOX

(to Dylan)

And you?

DYLAN

Um... well...

NATALIE

Hey Dylan, can we talk to you

for a second?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

There's something going on between

you and Knox. Isn't there?

DYLAN

So what, so I like him.   Is that

so wrong?

NATALIE

Uh, yeah Dylan, it IS.    He's a client.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

WAS a client.    We finished the job.

ALEX

She's got a point.

NATALIE

What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex,

I can't believe you're siding with her.

ALEX

I'm not siding with anyone, but

technically, he is no longer...

NATALIE

You know Charlie would NEVER

approve of this.

ALEX

Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care. I

think you're just being overly cautious.

DYLAN

Uh, guys?   GUYS!

DYLAN (CONT'D)

I'm a big girl. I make my own

decisions. I'm going out with him.

CUT TO:

VIVIAN WU (O.S.)

Sweet dreams.

THE THIN MAN

So, now we have the transmitter, what

do we do with fat boy? Dirt nap time?

VIVIAN WU

NO! Not until I've got the

information I need. We'll take

him to the compound, hold him there.

(beat)

In the meantime, we've got to tie

up some loose ends.

THIN MAN

Whenever you say something like

that, it means more work for me.

VIVIAN WU

(ignoring him)

The Angels will figure out they

were duped. We can't afford them

jeopardizing our plans.

THE THIN MAN

Here it comes...

VIVIAN WU

(coldly)

We have to Kill Charlie's Angels.

THE THIN MAN

Guess I'll cancel my weekend plans.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

JASON

Alex, I can't tell you how happy I

am you came.

ALEX

Me too.

JASON

No, I mean, it's weird. It's

weirding me out how happy I am when

you're around. Am I sick or something?

ALEX

(smiling)

Got me.

JASON

The only bummer is, I start to

jones when you're not around.

What the hell am I gonna do this

weekend, if you're not with me?

ALEX

We'll get you some sedatives.

You'll be fine.

JASON

Hey.   Wait a second.   Come with me!

ALEX

Come with you?

JASON

Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got

two tickets to the Final Four.

ALEX

Jason, I don't...

JASON

Wait, before you say no, let me just

say something, okay? I'm sick of how

little we see each other. I'm sick of

stealing a day here, or a week there.

ALEX

It's my job, Jason. I can't

explain it, but I have to be on

call, all the time, and...

JASON

What if I changed all that?

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

JASON (CONT'D)

What if I told you to quit your

job, and come live with me. What

I'm saying, Alex, is that I want

you to...

ALEX

Gunfire!   Get down!

ALEX (CONT'D)

My God, you're hit. You're...

JASON

Fine.  I'm fine.

(he laughs)

They're squibs, it's fake.   See?

JASON (CONT'D)

Fake guns, too. They're just

setting up for the next scene.

ALEX

Sorry about that, I...

JASON

(smiling)

God, I loved that. The way you

yelled and everything? Baby, you

been watching too many movies.

(he kisses her on the nose)

Alright, I gotta go reset these.

DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to

finish this conversation.

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Nice, Alex.   Real nice.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Hey, is someone firing more squibs

or...

JASON

Alex?     ALEX?

CUT TO:

NATALIE

Thanks for the second chance. I

swear, I'm really not a flake.

PETE

How can I deny any woman who's

seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and

Power"?

NATALIE

I bet there's a dozen women here

who fit that description.

PETE

Honestly -- there's a looks

component as well.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Really.

PETE

You're the most beautiful woman

I've ever seen this close up.

NATALIE

Ladies room.    I'll be back in two minutes.

PETE

I'll be here.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Who do you work for?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

Speak now or never again.

THE MAN

(motioning with eyes)

Jacket pocket.

NATALIE

National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA?

THE MAN

I've been following you. I didn't

know which side you were on.

(beat)

This is bigger than you think.

NATALIE

I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I

can't explain.

(hands card)

This is my cell phone number. Please

call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry.

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

DYLAN

Where's that music coming from?

KNOX

You'll see.    Just a little farther.

DYLAN

Oh...

(taking in the view)

Oh wow.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

That's amazing.

KNOX

Can I ask you a personal question?

DYLAN

Maybe.

KNOX

How much do you know about Charlie?

KNOX (CONT'D)

I just find it strange that you

work for a man you've never met.

DYLAN

Well, I don't know what he looks like,

but I feel like I know him. We all do.

(CONTINUED)

KNOX

And none of you have any clue who

he actually is?

DYLAN

Nope.

KNOX

And you're never curious to find out?

DYLAN

Of course, but believe me, it's

impossible. I've tried.

(beat)

Let's not talk about Charlie,

okay? Or work.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

In fact, let's not talk at all.

WIPE TO:

DYLAN

Eric, it's Vivian.

KNOX

Hmmm.    I wonder what she's here

for?

DYLAN

Want me to tell her to come back, or...

KNOX

No, no.  I'd better deal.

(he kisses her)

You go back to bed.

DYLAN

Hello?

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not

who she says she is. She's a former

assassin and an all around bitch.

DYLAN

Oh no.   OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE!

NATALIE

What?!

DYLAN

I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!

NATALIE

I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I

get there.

DYLAN

I can't do that. Call Alex and meet

me here.

NATALIE

Dylan...

VIVIAN WU

I see you take your bodyguarding

services seriously. Still, I worry

that no one is watching the door.

DYLAN

(covering)

Oh, I'm watching it.     In fact, I just

called for back up.

VIVIAN WU

All the same, I'm concerned about

Mr. Knox's safety.

(CONTINUED)

KNOX

(explaining)

Vivian just came over to run through

some numbers for the IPO.

VIVIAN WU

Please, take a seat. I'm almost

finished.

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Really. How disappointing.

DYLAN

I'm not much for games.

VIVIAN WU

Pity.

(CONTINUED)

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

(to Knox)

Bad news: The other angels are still

alive. Good news: Everything else

proceeding apace.

KNOX

Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment

would come sooner or later. I was

just hoping for later.

DYLAN

All this time, we thought Red Star

was behind this, but it was you.

(realizing)

You faked your kidnapping.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Why?

KNOX

To gain your trust. And get your

help.

(beat)

I want you to know, my personal

attraction to you was a sincere

and unrelated complication.

DYLAN

Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot

better about you being a lying pole

smoker.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

I can't believe I trusted you.

KNOX

Why not? You trust Charlie and you've

never even met him.

(CONTINUED)

KNOX (CONT'D)

And believe me, there's a lot about

him that you don't know. Anyway,

I'm not going to be an idiot and

stand here talking when we could do

something useful, like KILL YOU.

Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you...

KNOX (CONT'D)

Wow.

(to Vivian)

I've never seen YOU do something

like that.

VIVIAN WU

Oh, shut up.

CUT TO:

VIVIAN WU

She can't have survived.   It's too far.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

(beat)

Still, I should probably check...

KNOX

We've got more important things to do.

WIPE TO:

DYLAN

I can't believe Knox tried to kill me.

I mean, I've been lied to, I've been

cheated on, but no guy has ever

tried to SHOOT me before.

(coldly)

I'm gonna get him for that.

ALEX

He played us from the very start.

It was all just so he could get us

to tap into Red Star. He couldn't

figure out a way to do it himself.

NATALIE

Who knew that we are actually

tapping into the main servers for

The National Security Agency?

DYLAN

And now, thanks to us, he's had hours

to download whatever top secret

information he wants, for God knows

what reason.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Wait a minute. We installed the

transmitter, yes, but we never gave

him the receiver.

ALEX

What?

NATALIE

That laptop was the only way to access

the transmitter. And we gave the

laptop to...

ANGELS

Bosley!

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

ALEX

Come on, Bosley, answer.

(she hangs up, then,

to the Angels)

I've tried all his numbers and paged

him five times. No answer.

NATALIE

I don't even want to think about

what I'm thinking right now.

DYLAN

Don't!  He's alive, he's gotta be.   If...

(she pauses)

What IS that?

BOSLEY (O.S.)

Angels!   Angels, can you hear me!

BOSLEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I don't know if you can hear me. I don't

know if this thing is even working.

BOSLEY

I know you can't answer, but... I

really hope you can hear this.

DYLAN

Can we trace him?

NATALIE

Not off a boosted signal. We'd

have to be within 20 miles.

ALEX

Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are.

BOSLEY

I don't know where I am, really. I'm

in a round room. The walls are white.

Well. Not white-white. More of a

cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes,

I'm going to say vanilla.

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

I can see the ocean.

ALEX

Bingo.

BOSLEY

I don't know which ocean. I was

blindfolded the whole time. We were

flying. It must've been three or

four hours. Maybe more.

(CONTINUED)

DYLAN

(frustrated)

He could be anywhere in North America.

BOSLEY

Wherever it is, they have really

good pudding.

DYLAN

(incredulous)

What, pudding?

NATALIE

Hear that? That's a blue spotted

egret. They only live in one place.

ALEX

Florida.

CUT TO:

KNOX

Well?

THIN MAN

Our access was cut off at the source.

KNOX

GODDAMNIT!

THIN MAN

But not before we retrieved the

information you wanted.

(CONTINUED)

THIN MAN (CONT'D)

The National Security Agency's secret file

on the man known as Charles Townsend.

KNOX

Finally.

(beat)

How about Bosley? Did we get the

information we wanted?

THIN MAN

Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.

KNOX

Hmmm. Miami Arena.    Preparations

have been made?

THIN MAN

Yes.    We move out tonight.

KNOX

Excellent.

(beat)

Where IS Bosley?

THIN MAN

In the tower. We were waiting till

you gave the word.

KNOX

Well?    No time like the present.

HENCHMAN

Sir?    You should take a look at this.

(CONTINUED)

HENCHMAN (CONT'D)

See here? Look at the timer on

the camera.

THIN MAN

It's not moving.

(beat)

Oh, this is the oldest one in the

book. Punch up camera three.

THIN MAN (CONT'D)

Now pan left.

THIN MAN (CONT'D)

The old re-loop the video camera trick.

And look, she's not even carrying a gun.

(beat)

What is this, amateur hour?

CUT TO:

THIN MAN (O.S.)

Um, excuse me?     I think you're

trespassing.

THIN MAN (CONT'D)

No offense, but as "storming the

castle" plans go, this one sucked.

DYLAN

Oh yeah? And I suppose you could

do better?

(CONTINUED)

THIN MAN

Yeah, I sure as hell could.

DYLAN

Oh, right.

THIN MAN

How about an underwater entry? Or

hang gliding over the main tower?

There's a million good ways in, if

you just do your homework.

ALEX

You heard the man.

NATALIE

Nice work, Dyl.

THIN MAN

Present for you, sir.

KNOX

Dylan, how nice. Welcome to my

Florida home. Not as tasteful as

the one in LA, but much more private.

DYLAN

So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant

plan? You gonna sell a list of our

foreign spies to the highest bidder?

Blackmail the President?

KNOX

The first plan is too complicated,

and the second is virtually

impossible.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

KNOX (CONT'D)

Besides, I already have all the

money I need and my motivation is

much simpler...

(leaning in close to her)

... revenge.

DYLAN

Revenge?   Against who?

KNOX

You know what? I'm not in a gabby mood

right now. I've got a score to settle.

DYLAN

Seems like you're going a bit overboard.

KNOX

No, just leaving myself plenty of

margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.

DYLAN

I don't know why you bother.   I've

already won.

THIN MAN

Is that so?

DYLAN

Every moment I sit here is a

moment I'm using to figure out how

to take you down. In fact, this

statement -- this one I'm making

right here-- is just me stalling

for time while I decide which of

your goons I'm going to flatten

first.

(whispering)

It's gonna be the guy behind me.

(CONTINUED)

THE THIN MAN

Really?

DYLAN

By the time your guys are firing,

I'll be at about 180 on my reverse

inverted 360, which will land me

on Fat Boy there, as promised.

(nods to the second guard)

He'll take the chair seat in the

chin.

(re: two others; very slowly)

Now... I'm warning both of you:

I'm going to get you to shoot each

other. I know. Cliche as that

sounds.

(then to the last two)

Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make

something up. We'll have fun.

THE THIN MAN

And what will you do to me?

DYLAN

You won't even be here. I mean, I

don't want to tell you how to do

your job, but you should've killed

me by now. Because I already know

that your people are onto my

people, which means any moment now

you're going to be called out to

go and deal --

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Ah!   See?

HENCHMAN AT THE DOOR

We have intruders.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

Bosley's close.

ALEX

You find him.    I'll get Dylan.

NATALIE

(yelling)

BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me?

BOSLEY

Natalie!   Is that you?

NATALIE

How do I get up to you?

BOSLEY

There's a staircase. Look for a

switch.

NATALIE

Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you?

PETE

I'm good. I just -- you said you

wanted me to call.

NATALIE

I did. I do.    I mean, thank you

for calling.

PETE

I'm not an insecure person or anything,

and I've really enjoyed the very brief

time we have spent together.

PETE (CONT'D)

I'm just wondering if it's

something I said or did that's

making this whole thing so weird

between us.

NATALIE

(into phone)

Can you hold on a sec?

NATALIE (CONT'D)

(un-muting)

One more sec.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

(un-muting)

Sorry about that.

(CONTINUED)

PETE

Listen, is this a bad time?

NATALIE

No.   Not at all.

PETE

You just sound distracted.

NATALIE

You know, work this week has been

really busy. It's been hard to focus.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

See, the thing is, I'm not a full-

time waitress. I should have been

more up-front about that, it's just...

PETE

Natalie, what was that?

NATALIE

(yelling to phone)

Everything's fine!

VIVIAN WU

Hate to disagree.

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

Is this the famous Charlie?

(CONTINUED)

PETE

(confused)

No, it's Pete.

NATALIE

You bitch!   I like that guy.

NATALIE (CONT'D)

(to Vivian)

Do you have any idea how difficult it

is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?

VIVIAN WU

To be honest?

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)

I don't care.

NATALIE

I can handle villainy. I can even

handle super-villainy.

(Vivian swings and

misses again)

But what you did is just wrong.

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE (CONT'D)

(suddenly chipper)

Hi, Bos!

DYLAN

Here we go.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Okay, that part worked.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Now, guys, I warned you. This is

where you shoot each other.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Okay, here's where we improvise.

(CONTINUED)

BOSLEY

Oh my God, let me help you.

CUT TO:

KNOX

Let's GO!

DYLAN (O.S.)

Damn!

NATALIE

Don't worry, we'll get him.

DYLAN

You don't understand. He's got a

pound of C-5 in that briefcase.

ALEX

The question is, where's he headed?

BOSLEY (O.S.)

Miami.

(CONTINUED)

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

The man Knox is trying to kill has two

general admission tickets to the Duke-

Maryland game at Miami Arena. He's going

to blow up the arena and kill his target.

DYLAN

Not that I don't believe you, but how

exactly do you know all this?

BOSLEY

Because Angels, I was the one who

purchased those tickets.

NATALIE

But Bosley, you HATE sports, why

would you...

(suddenly getting it)

You didn't buy them for yourself.

ALEX

You bought them for...

ANGELS

CHARLIE!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DYLAN

What do you think he looks like?

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

Sixty, tall, well-built.

NATALIE

I always saw him as younger.

DYLAN

Definitely.   With black hair.

NATALIE

No, silver hair. And tan.

ALEX

He's not George Hamilton.

NATALIE

He's outside a lot.

DYLAN

We'll know him when we see him,

that's for sure.

ALEX

IF we see him.

NATALIE

How hard can it be to spot Charlie?

CUT TO:

DYLAN

Aw, shit.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

We have to split up!

(CONTINUED)

ALEX

I'll take the luxury boxes.

DYLAN

I'll take the mezzanine.

NATALIE

I got the floor.

JASON

Yes, yes!

ALEX

(yelling)

Charlie!? Charles Townsend!

JASON

Alex?

ALEX

Jason?

(beat)

Shit.

JASON

ALEX!    Hey...

CUT TO:

DYLAN

(looking everywhere)

Charlie! Charlie!

NATALIE

Charlie?

LIKELY CANDIDATE

Who?

ALEX

Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles

Townsend?

THIN MAN (O.S.)

Don't move.

(CONTINUED)

THIN MAN (CONT'D)

You move, you say anything, I

perforate you. Got it?

JASON (O.S.)

Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on?

ALEX

Jason, hi, I...

ALEX (CONT'D)

Can I talk to you later?

JASON

No you can talk to me NOW. I want

to know what the hell is going on.

First, you disappear with no

explanation, not even a goodbye.

ALEX

I'm sorry, I...

JASON

Now, I see you here, but you're

with some other guy.

THIN MAN

Hey, movie star, do yourself a

favor and get lost.

JASON

Lemme guess.   You must be Charlie?

ALEX

Jason, please...

(CONTINUED)

JASON

No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm

sick of this asshole telling you

what you can and can't do.

THIN MAN

That was stupid.

ALEX

Jason, get down!

JASON

What the hell is going on?

ALEX

Right now, just by leaning forward, I

could crush your windpipe. You'd die

a slow and painful death. You don't

want that, do you?

(CONTINUED)

ALEX (CONT'D)

Where is the bomb, when's it going off?

ALEX

Hi, Jason.   Gimme one second?

ALEX (CONT'D)

Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the

basement, and it's timed to go off

when the game clock hits zero!

NATALIE (O.S.)

Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock!

DYLAN (O.S.)

I'll look for the bomb!

ALEX

I lied to you Jason.    I'm not a

secretary.

JASON

Yeah, I can see that.

ALEX

(referring to the

Thin Man)

And that wasn't Charlie.

JASON

Right.

ALEX

I'm actually here to stop a madman

from killing everyone in this

building. Would it be okay if we

talked later?

(CONTINUED)

JASON

Go save the world, honey.

(beat)

I'll be waiting for you.

REFEREE

Time out!

DYLAN

(to herself)

Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is

figure out which wire to cut.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

Oh, shit.

ALEX

You're kidding me.

COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER

The time out is over, but one

cheerleader doesn't seem to notice.

Officials can't start the clock again

while she's on the court.

CUT TO:

DYLAN

Chartreuse and magenta.   This has

gotta be it.

KNOX (O.S.)

I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

KNOX (CONT'D)

See, if you snip ANY of those wires,

the bomb WILL blow up.

DYLAN

It's gonna blow anyway, once the

clock gets to zero.

KNOX

Who told you that, my idiotic

henchman? Do you think I tell him

ANYTHING that's confidential?

KNOX (CONT'D)

THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So

if you'll kindly step away, I'll

refrain from killing both of us.

(CONTINUED)

KNOX (CONT'D)

In different circumstances, Dylan, I

think you and I could have worked out.

We have a lot in common.

DYLAN

Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you

ARE one.

KNOX

Good one.

(beat, as he backs up)

Well, I must be going. If you like

your body parts attached to your

torso, I suggest you do the same.

ALEX

Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.

NATALIE

Give us the detonator.

KNOX

NO!

KNOX (CONT'D)

I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!

CHARLIE (O.S.)

Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want,

not all these innocent people.

KNOX

Charlie?

ANGELS

Charlie?

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE

Your father was a double agent, Eric.

Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed

by his own people before we could

throw him in jail.

(beat)

He was my friend.

KNOX

It's still your fault, you arrogant

prick! You still killed my father!

CHARLIE

Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should

YOU kill all these people? If you

hate me so much, just shoot ME.

Just shoot me, Eric.

KNOX

Okay.  You're right.

(quickly)

I'll just kill you.

DYLAN

Charlie, no.   NO!

DYLAN (CONT'D)

He's trying to say something.

(CONTINUED)

VOICE

Ucch, that tasted terrible!

NATALIE

Bosley!   Are you okay?

BOSLEY

Think so.

BOSLEY (CONT'D)

Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.

DYLAN

Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's

here... then where's Charlie?

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Great work, angels. You'll be happy

to know you received another

presidential commendation.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Enjoy your vacation, angels.

THE ANGELS

Thank you Charlie.

(CONTINUED)

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been

putting in some long hours on this case,

so I thought you might enjoy a chance to

catch up with some old friends.

DYLAN

Any chance you'll be joining us,

Charlie?

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(to cell phone)

I'd love to, Angels. But I have some

precious treasures to watch over.

DYLAN

To Charlie.

THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY

To Charlie.
