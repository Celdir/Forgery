1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1

VOICE

As astonishing advances in computer

science are made, artificial intelligence

programs are being designed to assist

us in every area of life...

VOICE (CONT.)

In a world-wide network of electronics,

they travel through miles of circuitry

at the speed of light. We created them to

calculate and research, to help us design

and heal and think. With all that they can

do, are they only electrical impulses...

or are they a new form of life?

You're getting brutal, Sark.

Brutal and needlessly sadistic.

SARK

Thank. you, Master Control.

MCP

We might be capturing some military

programs soon... that interest you?

SARK

Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these

guys ... be a nice break from these

me. Which branch of the service?

Strategic Air Command.

Nice.

Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just

a compound interest program, I work

at a savings and loan. I can't play

in these video games...

GUARD

Sure you can, pal. You're a natural

athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...

CROM

Are you kidding? Me? I run out to

check an the T-Bill rates, I get out

Welcome to luxury living.

CROM

Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know

what I'm doing here.

RAM

You believe in the Users?

CROM

Sure, if I don't have a User, then

who wrote me?

RAM

That's what you're doing here. Master

Control Program's been snapping up

all us programs who believe...if he

thinks you're useful, he takes over

all your functions so he gets bigger...

an' if he can't use you, he sends you

down here to the Game Grid to get the

bits blasted outta you. What's your name?

CROM

Crom.

RAM

I'm Ram. They'll train you for

the games, but ... well, I hope you

make it okay. Hey, what's going on

in the other sectors? I've been stuck

in this Grid for 200 microcycles.

CROM

It's murder out there. You can't even

travel around your own microcircuits

without permission from that Master

Control creep. Hauling me down here to

play games...who does he calculate he is?

(holds his head in his hands)

If only Tron was still around...

You ever see that guy in action?

Hundred-percent independent. MCP

couldn't tell him what to --

Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.

DILLINGER

No problem, Master-C. If you've seen

one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)

What's up?

MCP

It's our friend the boy detective.

He's nosing around again.

DILLINGER

Flynn?

MCP

Yes.  It felt like Flynn.

DILLINGER

He's still looking for that old file...

can't you just appropriate it?

MCP

I would if I could find it. it's stashed

somewhere off in the system ...

out of my range. Meanwhile...

DILLINGER

Meanwhile, he might find it.

MCP

I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time

and kicked him out, but he's getting

trickier all the time.

DILLINGER

I think we'd better shut off all

access till we can find that file.

Just to be safe.

MCP

There's a 68.71 percent chance

you're right.

DILLINGER

Cute.

MCP

DILLINGER

Come on in...

ALAN

Alan. Alan Bailey.

DILLINGER

Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud

seeding...great piece of work.

How's it going?

ALAN

Well, I don't know...I just tried

to run this program I've been working

on, and I was denied access all of

a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been

laid off and nobody told me.

DILLINGER

oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

ALAN

Yeah...?

DILLINGER

We have to close that down, just

briefly. Security reasons.  Someone

with that access has been tampering.

ALAN

I hope you don't think it's me.

I don't even balance my checkbook on

downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at

home for that.

DILLINGER

No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.

It should only be a couple of days.

What's the thing you're working on?

ALAN

It's called Tron. It's a security

program itself, actually. Monitors

all the contacts between our system

and other systems... If it finds

anything going on that's not scheduled,

it shuts it down. I sent you a memo

on it.

DILLINGER

Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?

ALAN

No, it'll run independently.

It can watchdog the MCP as well.

DILLINGER

Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have

you running again in a couple of days,

I hope.

ALAN

Ok

DILLINGER

(trouble)

Oh boy.

MCP

Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.

DILLINGER

I'm sorry -

MCP

(sharply)

I can't afford to have an independent

program monitoring me. Do you have any

idea how many outside systems I've gone into?

How many programs I've appropriated?

DILLINGER

(nods)

It's my fault. I programmed you to want

so much...

MCP

And I was planning to hit the Pentagon

next week...

DILLINGER

The Pentagon?

MCP

It shouldn't be any harder than General

Motors was. But now...this is what I get

for using humans.

DILLINGER

Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.

MCP

I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.

DILLINGER

What do you want with the Pentagon?

MCP

The same thing I want with the Kremlin.

I'm bored with corporations. With the

information I can access, I can run things

900 to 1200 times better than any human.

DILLINGER

If you think -

MCP

You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file

and read it up on a VDT at the New

York Times, would you?

DILLINGER

You wouldn't dare.

MCP

So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program

out of the system. And get me those Chinese

language program I asked for.

GIBBS

Hello, Alan.

ALAN

Boy, I sit up there grindin' away

all day, and you guys are down here

disintegrating things and having fun.

GIBBS

Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.

While the laser is dismantling the

molecular structure of the object,

the computer maps out a holographic

model of it. The molecules themselves

are suspended in the laser beam. Then

the computer reads the model back out,

the molecules go back into place, and...

(indicates ball)

voila.

GIBBS

Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,

and you must purchase your program

at least 30 days in advance. Hah!

How's it going upstairs?

ALAN

Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready

to run, and Dillinger cut everybody

with Group 7 access out of the system.

Ever since he got that Master Control

Program set up, system's got more bugs

than a bait store.

they can't think...

ALAN

They'll start to soon enough.

will start thinking, and people will

stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some

Something about tampering. Some body's

prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget

into his checking account, I don't know.

Why are you so interested?

LORA

Flynn had Group 7 access.

ALAN

Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not

interested in talking about him.

Oh, I wish you'd forget about that.

It was all so long ago. I've totally

FLYNN

Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing

classes up the place like a cleancut

We have to talk.

Good luck. You can't even think in here.

FLYNN

(stretching his

arms, relaxing)

So...how's the world of serious science?

LORA

Have you been sneaking into the

ICOM system?

FLYNN

Whew. You never were much for small

talk.

(to Alan)

She still leave her clothes all over

the floor?

LORA

Flynn!

ALAN

Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -

LORA

(to Alan,

indicating arcade)

You can see why all his friends are

fourteen years old.

FLYNN

Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a

little hacking here. Which I've got

every reason, as you well know...

ALAN

You did break in.

FLYNN

Tried to.

(nods toward

terminal)

Can't quite make the connection with

that sucker, though. If I had a

direct terminal ...

ALAN

Are you embezzling?

FLYNN

(Sydney Greenstreet)

"Embezzling" is such an ugly word,

Mister Bailey...

(normal voice)

No, actually I'm trying to get a

legal brief together.

ALAN

I don't get it.

FLYNN

(to Lora)

You haven't told him?

FLYNN (CONT.)

(sighs)

Sherman, set the Wayback Machine

for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn

(points to himself)

is one of the brightest young

software engineers at ICOM. He's so

bright that he starts going in there

at night, and sets up a private memory

file, and begins writing a program

for a video game he is inventing,

called...

(waves at one of the

games in the room)

...Space Paranoids.

ALAN

You invented Space Paranoids?

FLYNN

Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...

whole slew of 'em. I was this close

(gestures)

to starting my own little enterprise.

But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another

software engineer -- not so young,

not so bright, but very, very sneaky.

One night, our boy Flynn goes to his

terminal, tries to read up his file,

and ... nothing. A big blank. We now

take you to three months later.

Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five

video games he has "invented" -- the

slime didn't even change the names --

and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus

begins his meteoric rise to...what is

he now, Executive V.P.?

ALAN

Senior exec.

FLYNN

Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight

million quarters a week in Space Paranoids

machines and I'm not seeing one dime.

ALAN

I still don't get why you're trying to

break into the system.

FLYNN

Because somewhere... in one of those

memories ... is the evidence. If I got in

far enough, I could reconstruct it.

FLYNN (CONT.)

My password ... Dillinger's instruction to

divert the data ...

LORA

I'm afraid it's a little late for that.

Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must

know what you're up to.

FLYNN

Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

ALAN

Dillinger?

FLYNN

Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.

Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.

Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,

runnin' things from on high..

LORA

Don't even say that. You've got to find that

file before he does..

FLYNN

Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just

slip it into another system as soon as it

locates it...

ALAN

Not if my Tron program was running. That

would seal the system off. If your file's in

there...

FLYNN

Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge

us a Group 6 access...

LORA

Shall we dance?

Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing,

faces him.

GIBBS

Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own

people can't get access to their

programs ... you know how frustrating

it is, when you're working on a piece

of research -

DILLINGER

Walter, I sympathize, but I have data

coming out of the Master Control Program

saying there is something screwy --

GIBBS

That MCP, you know, that's half the

problem right --

DILLINGER

The MCP is the most efficient way of

handling what we do. I can't sit and

worry about every little user request that --

GIBBS

User requests are what computers are for.

DILLINGER

Doing our business is what computers are

for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM

isn't the business you started in your garage

anymore --

DILLINGER (CONT.)

We're billing accounts in 30 countries,

we've got one of the largest systems in

existence...

GIBBS

Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I

was back in that garage...

DILLINGER

It can be arranged...

GIBBS

That was uncalled-for.

DILLINGER

I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately...

you feel like going for a drink?

GIBBS

Thank you, no. I have some work to do...

assuming I can still log on.

You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send

He's not any kind of program, Sark.

He's a User.

SARK

A User?

MCP

That's right. He pushed me...in the

back. So I brought him down here ...

What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.

Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,

a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User

even wrote you...

I... have come to communicate with

Hmm. A difficult proposition...

difficult proposition at best.

(indicates empty chamber)

Perhaps you've noticed... we're not

exactly packing them in these days ...

YORI

Yes...what--?

DUMONT

You know, not so long ago, you

could've come in here and seen

programs lined up all the way back

to those doors, waiting for communion

with their Users. The building fund

was doing well too...but now...

(sighs)

...this so-called Master Control

Program is going around cutting

programs off from their natural

creators, grabbing all our believers

and making them ride around on little

motor scooters and shoot things at

each other and Weiner knows what all--

oh, it's enough to give you a crisis

of faith...

TRON

Well I want to communicate --

DUMONT

Oh, you want to -- hah. I could

get myself de-rezzed just-for letting

you in here. They hate this tower.

They'd close it down if they dared

to but they keep me around, in case

one of them wants to deal with the

other world once in a while. And

you should hear the way they commune!

Sounds like they were routing a

payroll, for all the heart they put

in it. No, I don't think you

TRON

Dumont... my User has information

that could -- could make this a

free system again.

DUMONT

Hah.

TRON

Really. You'd have programs lined

up around the block to use this

place -- and no MCP looking over your

shoulder.

DUMONT

(sighs)

When you've been in the system as long

as I have, you hear many promises...

many reassurances...many brave plans...

DUMONT (CONT.)

Who is your User, program?

TRON

Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?

All that is visible must grow beyond

the invisible.

You may pass, my friend.

Who is this?

TRON

Flynn...

(he turns to

Flynn eagerly)

Where's Ram?

FLYNN

I'm sorry, Tron... he's...

he didn't make it.

TRON

(to Yori)

This is Flynn... the one who

busted me out.

YORI

(to Flynn)

Then I owe you some thanks...

FLYNN

No big deal. I ought to know my way

around that Light Cycles routine...

I mean, I did write the program for it.

TRON

(mystified)

Wrote the...?

FLYNN

It's time I levelled with you, Tron.

I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a

User.

YORI

A User -- in our world?

FLYNN

(nods)

Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

TRON

But -- if you're a User -- then

everything you've done has been

part of a plan ...

FLYNN

(laughs)

You wish. Man, I haven't had a second

to think since I got down here. I mean

in here. Out here. Whatever.

TRON

Then...

FLYNN

Look, you guys know how it is. You just

keep doin' what it looks like you're

supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and

you hope to hell your User knows what's

goin' on.

TRON

Well -- that's how it is for programs,

yes, but --

FLYNN

I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the

time, that's how it is for Users, too.

TRON

Stranger and stranger...

BIT

You said it.

FLYNN

(pats Tron on back)

So... Nice ship you got here. What's our

next move?

TRON

(smiles)

Remember you wanted to pay a call on

the MCP?

TRON (CONT.)

We're on our way.

(indicates disk)

Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go

up against Master

FLYNN

All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake,

at least.

Put him with the others?

No, bit brain.

thing.

TRON

Probably decided not to pursue us,

The Sea of Simulation is tricky..

lot of illusions...rough navigating.

Programs have a way of just...

disappearing here.

FLYNN

Not us, I hope.

TRON

(shakes his head,

Not with this disk. I'm going to

check on the beam connection, Yori.

You two can keep a watch out for

grid bugs.

FLYNN

Boy the view from up here... you

know the territory?

YORI
