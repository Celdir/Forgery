FLASHBACK:

6	INT	NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ

RASCZAK (O.S.)

The end of another school year, and for

me no doubt another failure...

Rico, pay attention !

JOHNNY

Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

RASCZAK

Here in History and Moral Philosophy

we've explored the decline of

Democracy when social scientists brought

the world to the brink of chaos, and how the

veterans took control and imposed a stability

that has lasted for generations since...

You know these facts but have I taught you

anything of value ? You.

Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?

.

LANNY

It's a reward... what the Federation gives you

for doing Federal Service.

RASCZAK

No. Something given has no value !

Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ?

I guess they ought to revoke my

teaching credential...

RASCZAK

When you vote, you're exercising political

authority. You're using force. And force, my

friends, is violence, the supreme authority

from which all other authority derives.

CARL

Gee, we always thought you were the

supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.

RASCZAK

In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's

exerted by ten or ten billion, political

authority is violence by degree. The

people we call citizens have earned

the right to wield it.

DIZZY

My mother always says that violence

never solves anything.

RASCZAK

Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of

Hiroshima would have to say about that.

You.

CARMEN

They probably wouldn't say anything.

Hiroshima was destroyed.

RASCZAK

Correct. Naked force has settled more

issues in history than any other factor.

The contrary opinion 'violence never

solves anything' is wishful thinking

at its worst.

RASCZAK

People who forget that always pay...

They pay with their lives and their

freedom.

RASCZAK

You. Tell me the moral difference,

if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

JOHNNY

The difference lies in the field of civic

virtue. A citizen accepts personal

responsibility for the safety of the body politic,

of which he is a member, defending it,

if need be, with his life.

The civilian does not.

RASCZAK

The exact words of the text. But do

you understand it ?

Do you believe it ?

JOHNNY

Uh, I don't know.

RASCZAK

Of course you don't. I doubt if any

of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'

if it bit you in the ass.

RASCZAK

Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

7	EXT	NEW UNI HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

CARMEN

C'mon, let's see if they've posted the

math final test yet.

STUDENT

Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?

JOHNNY

How should I know ?

STUDENT

You're captain of the team !

8	EXT	QUAD - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

CARMEN

First thing Fleet Academy looks at

is your math scores.

Wish me luck !

JOHNNY

Good for you.

CARMEN

Your turn...

CARMEN

Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco.

His sister's at Fleet !

CARL

You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

JOHNNY

What's the hurry ?

CARL

Others are waiting.

JOHNNY

Did you read her mind ?

CARL

Don't have to... Some mating semaphore

is pretty hard to miss.

JOHNNY

Yeah, but I want Carmen.

CARL

You got it bad.

CARL

Don't forget about this afternoon.

(to Carmen)

He's always late when he walks you home

to fish for a kiss.

CARMEN

She's flying starships !

JOHNNY

Who ?

CARMEN

Marco's sister. Can you imagine

maneuvering half a million tons through

crwoded space lanes...

You gotta have nerves of steel !

Reflexes are critical

JOHNNY

I have good reflexes.

CARMEN

C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.

9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER

BIOLOGY TEACHER

For our final today, please identify the mouthparts,

the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the

nerve cord and count the ganglia.

You may begin.

CARMEN

Eeuch !

JOHNNY

Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

BIOLOGY TEACHER

Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are

Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't

true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many

ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself

in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and

mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of

society.

JOHNNY

Better put your goggles on.

BIOLOGY TEACHER

Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have

identified over two billion species so far.

Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.

CARMEN

But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented

art, mathematics and interstellar travel.

BIOLOGY TEACHER

True, we know of no insect society that has

produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a

Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your

head, take the example of the Arachnids, a

highly organized, highly evolved insect society.

BIOLOGY TEACHER

They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers

have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the

Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years

of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the

biological means to hurl their spore into space.

JOHNNY

Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric

caecal...

CARMEN

Excuse me...!

10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

JOHNNY

35% on the math final !  No one could be

that dumb with numbers.

CARMEN

Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch

over a bug. How embarassing.

JOHNNY

Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere

if you don't know math.

CARMEN

Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are

dumb with numbers.

JOHNNY

Then how come you won't hold hands with me

at school ?

CARMEN

I don't want everyone to see.

JOHNNY

Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?

CARMEN

How come that's all you talk about anymore ?

JOHNNY

It's all I think about anymore.

11	EXT	PUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN

CARMEN

You can't walk me home.

JOHNNY

Why not ?

CARMEN

I thought you were going to help Carl.

JOHNNY

Carl can wait.

CARMEN

Johnny, my Dad's home today.

JOHNNY

What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm

a teenager. You can't be a citizen when

you're only a teenager !

CARMEN

It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich

they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff

means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

JOHNNY

Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come

we're such good friends ?

CARMEN

Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?

12	INT	CARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY

CARL

Don't think about it... go on instinct.

JOHNNY

Ace of spades.

CARL

Statistically speaking you should've accidentally

guessed right by know.

JOHNNY

In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves

I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

CARL

Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why

some people are sensitive and some aren't.

Federal studies like this might provide a clue.

JOHNNY

I wouldn't want to know what everyone was

thinking. Four of spades.

CARL

Cyrano, you big yellow turd !

JOHNNY

He just wants attention. You don't play with

him like you used to.

CARL

Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

JOHNNY

How do you make him do that ?

CARL

I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling

up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

MOM (O.S.)

Get out ! Get out ! CARL...!

JOHNNY

Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that

to me.

CARL

Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet.

C'mon let's go.

JOHNNY

Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for

Starside R&D ?

CARL

Passport to the Universe.

Who wouldn't want that ?

JOHNNY

I've been thinking about applying for

Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

CARL

Your father will never let you.

JOHNNY

I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd

make a pretty good pilot. I've good great

reflexes. You need that for maneuvering,

you know.

CARL

Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through

stellar navigation.

So what do you think your chances are ?

JOHNNY

Eight point... no, uh, seven...

CARL

If you can't do those numbers, you haven't

got a chance.

JOHNNY

All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen,

and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

CARL

Love... how excruciatingly pathetic.

Now try and pay attention.

JOHNNY

Queen of hearts.

CARL

Well, what do you know about that !

13	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - STANDS - DAY - CARMEN

CARMEN

Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?

ZANDER

I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

CARMEN

You're going to the Academy ?

That's where I want to go. I'd love

to talk to you abou that.

ZANDER

I'm all ears.

CARMEN

Don't you have to finish the game ?

22	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY-THE GIANTS

26	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - JOHNNY

MOTHER

Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time

I checked you were only five years old. You had

such a bright little face...

JOHNNY

Aw, don't get mushy.

FATHER

This came for you today. I presume on your

request.

JOHNNY

A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

MOTHER

You aren't thinking of applying...?

FATHER

Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather

take ten lashes in Public Square than see you

ruin your life.

JOHNNY

It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to

get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a

couple of years.

MOTHER

Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in

the Federal Service. If something happened

to you I don't know what I would do...

FATHER

Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher.

What's his name ? You know the one I

mean.

JOHNNY

Mr. Rasczak.

FATHER

Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be

a law against using a school as a

recruiting station !

JOHNNY

No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

He sorta discourages you really.

FATHER

Good, because you're going to Harvard,

and that's the end of it.

JOHNNY

I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

FATHER

Oh, is that how it is ?

MOTHER

Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise

for you that will settle this.

Can you guess what it is ?

JOHNNY

Uh, no.

FATHER

A trip to the Outer Rings.

Whad'ya think of that ?

JOHNNY

Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've

always wanted to go there.

MOTHER

Good good, then it's all settled.

FATHER

A year at Harvard and you'll  see this

"Federal Service" is just menial training

for inferior people so they can call

themselves "citizens" and take airs for

the rest of their lives.

JOHNNY

Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal

and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest

kid at school !

FATHER

Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

JOHNNY

I don't know what they teach at Harvard,

but I think I'm pretty good enough the

way I am !

MOTHER

Johnny, please. Calm yourself.

JOHNNY

Well, that's what you're saying ! You're

saying that I'm not good enough the way

I am now !

MOTHER

Why did you go and do that ? He was all

ready to go Zegema Beach !

FATHER

Teenagers !

27	INT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE

BAND LEADER

Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so

let's turn down the lights and make it a

slow one.

DIZZY

Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?

JOHNNY

Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

DIZZY

Too bad for her if she's not around.

DIZZY

You know, it's sad... Most of us probably

won't see each other again after tonight.

JOHNNY

You still gonna play for Brazil ?

DIZZY

Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

JOHNNY

Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

DIZZY

How come we never got together ?

JOHNNY

Can't we just be friends, Diz ?

DIZZY

Sure.

JOHNNY

Uh, look, Diz...

DIZZY

Guess you gotta go.

JOHNNY

You're the best.

28	INT	GYMNASIUM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT - CARMEN AND JOHNNY

JOHNNY

Isn't it great to be in love ?

CARMEN

How do I know if this is love ?

JOHNNY

It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

CARL

Outa the way you two !

CARMEN

Romance is just a vestigial biological

response to procreation...

JOHNNY

Aw, you're in love with me...

You just dont know it yet.

JOHNNY

Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

CARMEN

I'll meet you outside.

JOHNNY

Mister Rasczak ?

RASCZAK

What is it, Rico ?

JOHNNY

I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History

and Moral Philosophy was the best class

I had this year.

RASCZAK

(smiling)

Well, it's not really my job to please.

Hope you learned something.

JOHNNY

I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I

have what it take to be a citizen.

RASCZAK

Good for you. Go find out.

JOHNNY

Well, my parents are against it, and I

know it's my choice, but I was

wondering...

What would you do if you were me ?

RASCZAK

Figuring things out for yourself is the

only freedom anyone really has.

Use that freedom.

Make your own choice, Rico.

29	EXT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY

CARMEN

Johnny, this is Zander.

Always.

CARMEN

He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.

Isn't that great ?

Yeah, sure, I guess.

CARMEN

No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a

chance.

JOHNNY

What are you talking about ? We both know

you're gonna be a pilot.

CARMEN

Zander is going for pilot, too.

JOHNNY

You two have so much in common.

CARMEN

Johnny Rico, you're jealous !

JOHNNY

I can't help it.

CARMEN

He's nothing like you.

JOHNNY

I don't even know if you're my girl.

CARMEN

Are you the boy for me ?

JOHNNY

I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign

up for Federal Service.

CARMEN

Oh, Johnny...

31	EXT	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

CARMEN

Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...

JOHNNY

Who cares ?

CARMEN

You're right. Let's never stop...

POLICEMAN

Hey, you, there's a place for that !

32	INT	FEDERAL HOUSING - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

JOHNNY

I love you, Carmen.

CARMEN

Shhh...

CARMEN'S DAD

Carmen, it's late. Get inside.

CARMEN

Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.

CARMEN'S DAD

I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?

JOHNNY

Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from

now on, Mr. Ibanez.

CARMEN'S DAD

Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you

and your rich family. The Federation'll give her

everything she needs.

CARMEN (O.S.)

Dad, leave him alone...

35	INT	PROCESSING HALL - DAY - JOHNNY, CARMEN AND CARL

form 1240/A. Thank you for exercising you

constitutonal rights.

No, sir.

PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)

Which do you think is more important,

courage or confidence ?

JOHNNY (V.O.)

Courage, I guess.

PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)

Please complete this sentence.

I want to be citizen because...

JOHNNY (V.O.)

I want to be a citizen because...

well, because of my girl, sir.

39	INT	DEBRIEF - DAY - JOHNNY

MAJOR

I'm happy to tell you that you've been

accepted for Federal Service.

JOHNNY

Wow, that's great.

MAJOR

Looks like you're quite an athlete.

Boy, look at those reaction stats.

MAJOR

My job is to dertermine what you're

best suited for.

JOHNNY

I want to be a pilot, sir.

MAJOR

Sorry, son, no way. Your school records

say you don't have the math skills.

MAJOR

That rules out the scientific and engineering

applications, and I'm afraid we reserve

non-military options for candidates who are

frankly less able-bodied than you are, son...

MAJOR

It looks like the only thing you're good

for is cannon fodder.

I'm putting you down for the

Mobile Infantery.

40	INT	AUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN

JOHNNY ET AL

...of my own free will, without promise, coercion,

this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service

years and as much longer as may be required

by the needs of the Service...

CARMEN

I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

JOHNNY

Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

JOHNNY

He was in the group with me.

I guess he didn't...

CARMEN

Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

RECRUITING SERGEANT

They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted,

but at the end of the day I go home.

How'd you kids do ?

CARMEN

I'm gonna go for pilot.

RECRUITING SERGEANT

Good for you. We need every pilot we can get.

CARMEN

Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

JOHNNY

Did you get Starside R&D ?

CARL

No.

42	EXT	FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

JOHNNY

I don't believe it !

CARL

I got Games & Theory.

CARMEN

Games & Theory ? That's Military

Intelligence... Oh, Carl !

JOHNNY

Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !

RECRUITING SERGEANT

Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute

you. What about you, son ?

JOHNNY

Infantery, sir.

RECRUITING SERGEANT

Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me

the man I am today.

CARMEN

Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always

be friends no matter what.

JOHNNY

I'll go for that.

CARL

Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away

from each other, and chances are we'll never see

each other again, but sure...

You're not going back. You're going

JOHNNY

I'm not going on vacation ! I want to

I made it.

Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE...

FATHER (O.S.)

MOTHER

Johnny, why won't you change your mind ?

Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

JOHNNY

Well, yeah, sure...

MOTHER

I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life

handsome in a uniform.

JOHNNY

Don't talk about my girl that way.

took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready

to go.

JOHNNY

Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.

CARMEN

Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.

JOHNNY

Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything

I need for the next two years, right ?

CARMEN

You talk to Carl ?

JOHNNY

He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

CARMEN

It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it.

Going someplace new where you don't

know anyone.

I'm gonna miss you.

Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had

to show you. It's great to be out here on

my own. I'm just not some little girl from

Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a

starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the

universe...

And that's also the problem because I

don't really want to get married,

Johnny. I don't want to have kids.

gonna leave a lot of room for you and

me.

around.

With the Marauder's visual capabilities,

all you have to do is look at something

to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME

CARE on my firing line.

closest simulation of actual combat

we can provide. If you do not hit

your target, it will shoot you...

ZIM

The Marauder power suit will prevent

serious injury, but if you are hit, you

will be non-operational and your team

score will suffer accordingly. Rico,

has each member of your squad completed

a weapons safety check ?

Alright... next we got a little last minute

briefing from Military Intelli-gence I

think you're gonna like...

OFFICIAL VOICE

Everyday Federal scientists are looking for

new ways to kill bugs and you can help...

CARL

To defeat the enemy, we must know the

enemy. Take for instance your basic

Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored,

completely lethal. You can blow a limb off...

CARL

... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive.

But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem

and put it down for good.

CARL

Now while you are out killing bugs,

we want you to be our eyes and ears.

The bugs use some kind of plasma burst

to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth.

We need to know how they do this. If you

encounter any plasma, report it immediately

to your superior. Good luck and good hunting !

P.A. (O.S.)

This is the Captain speaking.

All personnel prepare for drop.We

are at D minus three and counting.

everyone fights. Rule two, no one

quits. If you don't do your job,

I'll kill you myself.

We'll take this high ground. Lookouts

bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood,

we'll be the first to know.

ACE

Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know

where they can deploy the skimmers.

JOHNNY

Down there on the flats, eh ?

Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our

primary objective is to assist

our friends from the Fleet...

JOHNNY

Alright, cut it out. We will deploy

from skimmers in teams of six.

If the bugs open up a battery,

we put it out of business.

Any questions ?

JOHNNY

Would'ya mind moving your boat ?

FLEET OFFICER

Better talk to the boss.

JOHNNY

You're standing on my H.Q.,

Lieutenant !

ZANDER

This is a Fleet-driven operation, son,

and the Fleet thinks my boat will be

safer on the high ground.

You can have everything else, eh ?

JOHNNY

You heard the Sky Marshall...

ZANDER

Rodger Young, prepare to receice

outgoing fire...!

That would mean a comlete disregard

for the mission objective. They hang

you for that, Rico.
