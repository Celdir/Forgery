THE LAST BOY SCOUT

SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.)

(on TV)

Eliminating the draft? Worst

thing ever happened to pro

football. Already you got Eric

Dickerson, no team's good enough

for him... You got Dion Sanders,

this guy, Bosworth, bunch of

peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him

play for 25 bucks a game. And he

woulda played for free, you get

me? He loved the game. Nowadays?

Forget about it.

MAN ON BED

Hello...?

MALE (V.O.)

Hello, Billy.    Do you know who

this is?

MALE (V.O.)

Kid from Ohio is looking real

good, Billie...

MAN ON BED

I'm... I'm gonna... try real

hard...

MALE (V.O.)

No, Billy. What you're gonna do

... is rush for 150 yards against

Chicago.

MAN ON BED

That's... too much. I can't...

(CONTINUED)

2.

MALE (V.O.)

You can. And you  will. This is a

business, Billy.  You don't make

one fifty, you're history, the kid

steps in. No more  job... and no

more pills, Billy.

MAN ON BED

Please... Just give me time...

MALE (V.O.)

One hundred and fifty yards.

Goodbye.

CUT TO:

SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO   NOVEMBER 14

ANNOUNCER

Good afternoon and welcome to

Soldier Field, Chicago, site of

today's confrontation between the

L.A. Stallions and the Chicago

Bears. This is Vern Lindquist

with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my

friends, it is that cold.

CUT TO:

3.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

... Big Ray Walton puts a

devastating hit on Bricmont, so

Chicago turns over the ball with a

minute and forty seconds left.

COLOR MAN (V.O.)

And so L.A. has a chance to ice

the game, no pun intended... And

you gotta be thinking, give the

ball to Billy Cole. He has had an

outstanding day, racking up 138

yards against a tough defense.

Goddamn.   Dude's trashed.

KID #3

Take his bottle.

HALLENBECK

Hey, motherfucker.

KID #3

I'm not scared.

HALLENBECK

MALE (V.O.)

Hey, Joe, Mike Miller over at

Swerdlow. You got a minute?

HALLENBECK

Mmmmm.

MALE (V.O.)

Mmmmm? What's mmmmm? Jeez, you

sound fucking terrific. What'd

you do last night?

HALLENBECK

Sat in the car. Looked at the sky.

Got hammered.

MALE (V.O.)

How bad?

HALLENBECK

I killed a squirrel and don't even

remember.

MALE (V.O.)

That's bad, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Tell me about it. Look, I crawled

out of a perfectly good bottle to

answer the phone, what the fuck do

you want?

MALE (V.O.)

Still takin' charity?

HALLENBECK

No pride here. What'cha got?

MALE (V.O.)

Stripper in West Hollywood. Lives

alone. Very hot. A three on my

finger scale. Means I'd cut off

three of my fingers if God would

let me sleep with her.

HALLENBECK

Make her a one on your nose scale.

Improve your looks.

MALE (V.O.)

Eat me. Deal is this: She's got

a psycho, threatens her over the

phone. I'm gonna rape you, cut

you, the usual crap.

MALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

She thinks he's following her.

I'm up to here, you got plans?

HALLENBECK

I was gonna smoke some cigarettes.

MALE (V.O.)

Can you postpone?

HALLENBECK

These are really good cigarettes.

MALE (V.O.)

She goes onstage at seven.    It's

two hundred bucks, Joe.

HALLENBECK

(sighs)

Gimmee the address.

MALE (V.O.)

Terrific.    And, Joe, big favor,

okay? Try    to... fix yourself up,

if you can   manage it. Look the

part. Not    like the last time,

okay?

HALLENBECK

Gimmee the address.

Smile, you fuck.

JIMMY

'Morning, boys.

HENRY

Hey, Jimmy.   You want some of

this?

JIMMY

No, man. Why do you think they

call it dope?

(beat)

Henry, did I do anything last night

that I should know about?

HENRY

You puked a couple times. Pointed

at some lady's tits. Chased a dog

for a half an hour. Fucked a

congressman's daughter, shit on

someone's car.

JIMMY

No, man, I meant something bad,

that I should know about.

(CONTINUED)

13.

HENRY

Mmmm.  Nope.

(frowns)

My ass hurts, I think I had gay

sex last night. I don't remember.

When are you gonna come look at

my gun collection?

JIMMY

Soon, Henry.

PLAYER

Are you Jimmy Dix? Played for the

Stallions?

JIMMY

'86 and '87, that was me.

PLAYER

Hell, I think the league gave you

a raw deal.

JIMMY

Thanks.   What the hell, shit

floats.   I'll be back.

PLAYER

I hope so.

JIMMY

I'll be back.

JIMMY

Ho.    Ray.

RAY (MAN)

What the fuck you want, Jimmy?

JIMMY

What's with the girl?

RAY

Bitch won't blow me.

JIMMY

(pause, then)

Too early in the morning, Ray.

Let her go.

RAY

Fuck you. She's not coming up

till she starts blowing.

JIMMY

Ray.   Let her go.

RAY

Fuck   you, loser. What are you doing

at a   league party, asshole? You and

ol'   Dex Manley should get together,

swap   stories about gettin' booted.

JIMMY

Ray, she's gonna drown.

RAY

Not if she blows me.

JIMMY

Last chance, Ray.

RAY

Go spit.

JIMMY

Fine.

JIMMY

Get out of here. Go.

JIMMY

Best arm in the National League,

you son of a bitch. Remember that.

NEIGHBOR

'Morning, Joe, how's it going?

HALLENBECK

My ears are burning, Andy. Even

as we speak, someone, somewhere is

calling me an asshole.

NEIGHBOR

You're funny.

HALLENBECK

I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.

16.

SARAH

I thought you were in Las Vegas.

HALLENBECK

I was.

SARAH

Where did you sleep?

HALLENBECK

Office.

HALLENBECK

Hey, Furry Tom.

SARAH

How much did you lose?

HALLENBECK

I wasn't there to gamble.    I was

doing a skip trace.

SARAH

How much did you lose?

HALLENBECK

Fifty bucks.

HALLENBECK

What's this?

SARAH

Darian's class drew holiday

pictures. That was hers. Her

teacher wants to see us, Joe.

17.

HALLENBECK

Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent,

don't you think?

SARAH

It's hideous.

HALLENBECK

You okay, Sarah...?

SARAH

I'm tense. I couldn't get to

sleep last night.

HALLENBECK

Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid

will be fine. Boys still tease

her about the headgear?

SARAH

Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's

the latest. Little bastards.

HALLENBECK

(under his breath)

She'll be fucking them by the

time she's fourteen.

SARAH

Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Well, Christ, you let her wear

enough makeup. The kid looks like

a goddamn raccoon. She comes in

late at night, I think, 'Christ,

a burglar.' I almost shot her

twice.

SARAH

You're not funny. All the girls

at that school wear makeup.

(CONTINUED)

18.

HALLENBECK

Yeah, but they don't apply it with

a paint sprayer. And for your

information, our neighbors think

I'm very funny.

SARAH

Go live with them.

HALLENBECK

Don't tempt me.

HALLENBECK

Damn raccoon.

HALLENBECK

Who's the guy in the closet?

SARAH

Excuse me?

HALLENBECK

(frowns)

Oh, that's right, you sometimes

forget that I'm a detective.

(lights a cigarette)

See, first I noticed how tense you

were, but I let that pass. Then

I noticed there was steam in the

shower like someone was just in

there, but meanwhile your hair is

completely dry, you follow? So.

Why the steamy shower?

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

19.

HALLENBECK (CONT'D)

Because someone else was in there,

right, and since he's not under

the bed you must have stuck him in

the closet when you heard my key in

the door a day early. Tah-dah.

Please, no applause.

SARAH

Well, nothing changes.    You're

still a lunatic.

HALLENBECK

Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't

enjoy being observant, but someone's

gotta do it.

(beat)

What's his name?

SARAH

Please leave.    I have to get dressed.

HALLENBECK

It's okay, I've seen you naked. So,

apparently, has someone else. What's

his name?

SARAH

You want me to open the closet, Joe?

Huh? You want me to indulge your

fucking paranoia, I'll throw the

door open, is that what you want me

to do...?

HALLENBECK

Is this a trick question?

SARAH

I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then

we'll both know you're a psycho,

is that what you want? Huh??

HALLENBECK

No.   We won't open the door.

SARAH

Thank you.

(CONTINUED)

20.

HALLENBECK

(sighs)

Nope. Door stays shut. Instead,

what I'm gonna do is...

(he scoops up the

.38)

... I'm gonna count to three, and

then I'm gonna put a bullet in

there, and you can stop me anytime

by speaking the truth. One.

SARAH

If you shoot up my house, Joe, I

will make you eat that gun.

HALLENBECK

Two. The truth is a beautiful

thing.

SARAH

Call your shrink, Joe. I still

have the number. Call him and tell

him you're losing it, I cannot

fucking deal with you like this -- !

HALLENBECK

Three.   Last chance.

SARAH

Joe, dammit -- !

SARAH

Jesus, no -- !

HALLENBECK

Hello, Mike.   Keeping her warm

for me?

MILLER

Easy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb.

HALLENBECK

How as she, Mike? On your finger

scale, how was my wife...?

MILLER

It just happened, Joe.     It just

happened.

HALLENBECK

You call me from here this morning?

MILLER

She said you were in Vegas. I was

gonna leave a message on the machine.

HALLENBECK

When you found out I was back.       Why

didn't you split?

MILLER

She said relax, he never stops home

once he's in the office.

HALLENBECK

Normally I wouldn't.

MILLER

(stares at him)

You knew?

HALLENBECK

I suspected. So how about it, Mike?

On a scale of one to ten. How was

she?

MILLER

Joe, come on, how long we been

friends, huh?

HALLENBECK

How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly

until you put your dick in my

wife.

(CONTINUED)

22.

MILLER

You gotta understand --

HALLENBECK

I know, I know, it just happened.

It was an accident. Sure. You

tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and

accidentally fucked my wife. Gee,

Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my

week. Sure, Mike. Happen to

anybody.

(beat)

I don't gotta understand anything.

SARAH

Put the gun down.

HALLENBECK

Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun.

(sighs)

You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.

HALLENBECK

Where was Darian?

SARAH

She stayed at Cindy's last night.

HALLENBECK

Let's take a walk, Buddy.

(CONTINUED)

23.

HALLENBECK

Where you want it, Mike?     Head

or gut?

MILLER

Listen, Joe, I --

(stops, sighs)

Gut.

HALLENBECK

If I see you again, I'll kill

you.

HALLENBECK

So.   West Hollywood at seven, right?

MILLER

Huh...?

HALLENBECK

The job.     Seven o'clock, right?

MILLER

You still... want the job...?

HALLENBECK

It's two hundred bucks.

MILLER

Yeah.   I guess it is.

MILLER

I'm sorry, Joe.

UNIFORM COP

Why did Mr. Miller visit your home

this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck?

(CONTINUED)

HALLENBECK

He came by to talk business. He

had a case he was to busy to continue

with, a routine surveillance. He

farmed it out to me.

UNIFORM COP

I see.    Is that all you talked

about?

HALLENBECK

Yeah.    That's all.

My son. He writes his own

JIMMY

Alex the astronaut.

HARP

Alex the astronaut.

JIMMY

I've had it, Harp.

HARP

Had what?

JIMMY

It, man. I've had it.

(takes a swig)

I don't remember what I did  last

night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act

like a complete dickhead.   I don't

have friends. I drink too   much.

I fuck anything that's warm  and

breathing.

HARP

Stay on that side of the bar.

JIMMY

(sighs)

I cheated on my girl friend again.

HARP

You cheated on her?   You must be

crazy.

JIMMY

Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so.

27.

HALLENBECK

The police won't help you, huh?

CORY

Sure. After I'm dead they'll

perform the autopsy.

HALLENBECK

Guess you don't want to wait that

long.

CORY

Guess not.

HALLENBECK

(scowls)

They only play this kind of music?

CORY

What did you expect?

HALLENBECK

Pat Boone?   The Four Freshmen?

CORY

What are you, my father?

HALLENBECK

Yes, I'm your father. Get your

clothes on.

(beat)

I hate this funk shit. It's gonna

be an extra hundred bucks.

CORY

You're hilarious.      Sit next to

the speaker, you'll     get used to

it. After a while      you'll be

screaming play that     funky music

white boy.

The screaming part I believe.

CORY

(seductive)

Hello, handsome. How'd you like

to buy me a bottle of champagne?

JIMMY

How much for a bottle?

CORY

Forty dollars.

JIMMY

No thanks. Nothing personal, my

seventh grade teacher was killed

by a drunk driver.

CORY

Tall guy?   Sandy hair?

JIMMY

That's the one.

CORY

I had to swerve three times to

get him.

JIMMY

Ha-ha.

CORY

So no bottle, then?

JIMMY

For forty bucks I'd rather drink

my own piss.

CORY

That's extra.

JIMMY

Hi, Cory.   Rough night?

29.

CORY

Arrgh.   I've had it to here.

JIMMY

(grins)

I'll bet you have.

JIMMY

Who's the stiff?

CORY

He's nobody.

(beat)

I have to get ready to dance.

JIMMY

Come back soon. I want to buy

you a drink.

EMCEE

You know, crowd, these ladies are

fine, but let me tell you the three

reasons men prefer sheep: they're

always in the mood, they never

bitch, and after you fuck 'em you

can eat 'em.

EMCEE

(plowing ahead)

And now, here's a lady that's

always in the mood, put your hands

together for the lovely and

talented Ms. Cory...!

(CONTINUED)

30.

JIMMY

Hi.   You're nobody.

HALLENBECK

Shhh.   Don't tell anyone.

JIMMY

That's what Cory said.    She said

you were nobody.

HALLENBECK

Easy, Junior,   I'm not raining on

your parade.    She's too young for

me. I'm just    keeping an eye on

her for a few   days.

JIMMY

I see. What are you, some kind

of bodyguard?

HALLENBECK

Something like that. You got a

cigarette?

JIMMY

No.   Is Cory in trouble?

HALLENBECK

I hope not.   You tell me.

JIMMY

She didn't mention anything to me.

HALLENBECK

Mmmm.   That bothers you, doesn't it?

(CONTINUED)

31.

JIMMY

Maybe.

HALLENBECK

Don't sweat it. Women have secrets.

Water is wet, the sky is blue, and

women have secrets.

(beat)

I'll buy you a beer. Sit down.

JIMMY

She hired you, huh?      What, you in

the phonebook?

HALLENBECK

Yeah.    Actually, she hired my buddy

Mike.    I'm filling in.

JIMMY

Where's Mike?

HALLENBECK

He died.

JIMMY

Sorry to hear it.

HALLENBECK

Don't be. He was a lousy

surveillance man.

JIMMY

Look, friend, I don't know who you

are or what's going on. But Cory

is my girl friend and if she's in

trouble, I want to hear about it.

HALLENBECK

That's client confidential.

JIMMY

Tell me anyway.

HALLENBECK

Nope.

JIMMY

I say two words to Cory and you

don't get paid, asshole.

(CONTINUED)

32.

HALLENBECK

Do it.

JIMMY

You sure? I'm looking at your suit,

you could use the dough.

HALLENBECK

You don't like my suit, guess what?

I don't like your money.

JIMMY

Good, 'cause you're not getting any.

HALLENBECK

Story of my life.

JIMMY

What is?

HALLENBECK

Not getting any.

JIMMY

You couldn't protect a cup of

warm piss.

HALLENBECK

Hit me.

JIMMY

Excuse me?

HALLENBECK

Hit me. Bust me in the chops,

chickenshit.

(beat)

You're not afraid, are you, Jimmy...?

JIMMY

(freezes)

You know who I am?

HALLENBECK

About fucking time.

Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private

detective.

JIMMY

I don't know, Joe... You look like

a dumb wop to me.

HALLENBECK

At least I didn't shit my talent

away on coke, motherfucker.

JIMMY

Can I hit you now?

HALLENBECK

Absolutely.

HALLENBECK

Please, have a seat.

JIMMY

(gasping)

You think you're some kind of hot

shit tough guy, huh?

HALLENBECK

It's not a question of tough. I'm

bigger than you, and I was trained.

So I can take you. That's just the

way it is. You can throw a better

pass.

How about that beer?

(CONTINUED)

34.

JIMMY

Piss off.

HALLENBECK

(signals the waitress)

You were a great quarterback, Jimmy.

I watched you play at Washington

State. Red shirt freshman in '82.

Followed you with the Stallions.

Good scrambling ability, seventy

percent completions from the

pocket... You had the best gun

in the N.F.L.

JIMMY

Yeah.   Thanks. I guess.

Wrong place at the wrong time,

HALLENBECK

That's what you think. Last night

I fucked your wife.

CRAG-FACE

Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know

it was my wife?

HALLENBECK

She said her husband was a

greaseball with bad breath.

CRAG-FACE

You're pretty cool for a guy gonna

take a bullet.

HALLENBECK

After fucking your wife, I'll take

two.

CRAG-FACE

You're a funny guy. It's a shame

to take you off. Here, kneel down.

HALLENBECK

Are you kidding? We barely know

each other.

CRAG-FACE

This is wild. I never shot no

funny guy before.

HALLENBECK

You need a special funny bullet.

CRAG-FACE

Come on, cut it out. Head or chest?

HALLENBECK

That's what your wife said.

CRAG-FACE

Would you quit with the wife?

Enough is enough.

HALLENBECK

Ask me how fat she is.

CRAG-FACE

How fat is she?

HALLENBECK

She's so fat I had to roll her in

flour and look for the wet spot.

You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap

her thigh and ride the wave in.

(the hitman loses it)

Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except

when you poke her in the stomach,

she farts. I got a buddy he's an

archaeologist, organized an

expedition to her chin. They got

lost in her nasal hair. But

seriously, her eyes are like the

streets of Paris: crossed.

They're so crossed when she cries

the tears run down her back.

She's got back-tearia.

BESSALO

Oh, yeah. There's more.

A long time ago, that son of a bitch

guess.

HALLENBECK

Always kept an eye out for work?

JIMMY

No hooking, if that's what you mean.

HALLENBECK

It isn't. Tell me what she did at

the club, besides dance.

JIMMY

The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy

to buy you a bottle of champagne.

Sit in a private booth, let the

poor fuck spill his troubles. Used

to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.

HALLENBECK

She get many high rollers?

JIMMY

Sure.   Even rich guys get lonely.

HALLENBECK

Fine.

(beat)

So suppose one night, her 'guest'

gets a little too drunk, and brags

to her... reveals something about

himself. Something that could hurt

if it came out. What would she do?

JIMMY

I don't get it.

HALLENBECK

Would she blackmail him?

JIMMY

Jesus, I've had about enough of you --

(CONTINUED)

46.

HALLENBECK

Would she consider the possibility of

blackmail?

JIMMY

(sighs)

She'd consider it. If she could

get away with it. But she'd need

hard evidence. Otherwise, it's

'I never said that,' his word

against hers.

HALLENBECK

Right.   So what does she do?

JIMMY

I don't know.    Follow the guy?   Have

him followed?

HALLENBECK

Bingo. Kid, this is making sense.

She hires somebody to follow the

mark and obtain blackmail evidence.

JIMMY

Who does she hire?

HALLENBECK

Ah.  She hires my buddy Mike.

(beat)

Right? Right. It makes sense.

Except --

JIMMY

Except you told me that Mike was a

shitty surveillance man.

HALLENBECK

Exactly. He got spotted. They

made him, and they killed him.

Then they took out Cory.

JIMMY

Christ, what did the two of them

stumble onto?

HALLENBECK

Whatever it was, it was way over

their heads. They knew they were

in trouble.

JIMMY

How you figure?

(CONTINUED)

47.

HALLENBECK

Because Mike was scared. He bailed

out and threw the case in my lap.

JIMMY

He handed it to you... without

telling you how dangerous it was?

HALLENBECK

He was fucking my wife, Jimmy.

(beat)

I die. He gets my wife.

McCASKEY

Okay, you guys are cleared to go.

Pick up belongings at the property

desk.

JIMMY

Shit. This shirt cost me eighty

bucks.

HALLENBECK

(holsters his gun)

Glad to see, at a time like this,

at least you got your priorities

straight.

JIMMY

Do me a favor and shut up. You

think I don't care that Cory's

dead?

(rubs tired eyes)

Christ, I feel like I been rode

hard and put away wet.

(CONTINUED)

48.

HALLENBECK

Get some sleep.

JIMMY

Wow. What stunning advice.      I was

gonna go hiking.

HALLENBECK

Fuck you.

JIMMY

You know something, Joe, for a

private eye, you sure don't go in

for snappy comebacks.

HALLENBECK

How's this? Fuck you and the

horse that looks like you.

JIMMY

Get some sleep.

PATROLMAN

You look real familiar.     Do I know

you?

JIMMY

You might.    Some people recognize

me.

PATROLMAN

Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to

sell hash in Crenshaw District.

JIMMY

No, man. I played football.

Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions.

PATROLMAN

What position?

JIMMY

Forget it.

PATROLMAN

Fuckin' football. Free agents

ruined the damn game.

(CONTINUED)

49.

HALLENBECK

We gotta cross the parking lot.

You wanna borrow my sunglasses?

JIMMY

Fuck you.

HALLENBECK

Hey, snappy comeback. You a

detective?

JIMMY

That son of a bitch!

HALLENBECK

What the fuck are you trying to

do, Tarzan?

JIMMY

He hit the chick.

HALLENBECK

You don't start a fight in a

police station, dickhead. Are you

really this stupid or did you take

lessons?

JIMMY

Guy shouldn't treat a woman like

that, is all I'm saying. He just

shouldn't, okay?

HALLENBECK

Why? Because they're weak and

need protecting?

(CONTINUED)

50.

JIMMY

(pause, then)

Yeah.

CUT TO:

JIMMY

Mind if I catch a ride with you?

HALLENBECK

Yes.

JIMMY

My car's fucked up, remember?

HALLENBECK

Take the bus.

JIMMY

Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved

my life. Let me buy you a beer.

HALLENBECK

I'm not thirsty. Good night.

JIMMY

That's it.     Good night?

HALLENBECK

Go home.     Get some sleep.

JIMMY

What are you gonna do?

HALLENBECK

I'm gonna get a message to the

people who killed your friend.

JIMMY

What's the message?

(CONTINUED)

51.

HALLENBECK

That we're out of it. That

whatever they're doing, they don't

have to worry about us.

JIMMY

You're kidding.

JIMMY

You're backing off, you're not

gonna do anything? I watch T.V.,

what the fuck kind of private eye

doesn't do anything?

HALLENBECK

The kind with a wife and kid.

Look, it's over. My job is done.

JIMMY

Fuck you your job is done.    We

witnessed a murder, Joe!

HALLENBECK

Yes, it was very exciting.

Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo.

(beat)

You wanna play hero, go ahead.

When you die, I'll take your

closet full of eighty-dollar

shirts.

JIMMY

Look, until this is over, I'm

sticking with you.

HALLENBECK

The hell you are.

JIMMY

I'm part of this. We do something,

we do it together.

HALLENBECK

Have a ncie night.

JIMMY

Don't drive away, Joe.

(CONTINUED)

52.

JIMMY

Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Tell them what, Jimmy?

JIMMY

That Mike Miller was fucking your

wife.

(beat)

Only reason you're not in the

cooler, tough guy, is the cops got

no motive for Miller's death.

When they find out Mikey was

dickin' your old lady, seems to

me you become suspect numero uno.

I'm scared, and I'm coming with

you, got it?

HALLENBECK

You little creep, I'm gonna beat

the shit out of you.

JIMMY

Go for it. Then the cops'll

really love my story.

(smiles)

You don't start a fight in a

police station, dickhead.

HALLENBECK

You and me is not a fight.     You

and me is a massacre.

JIMMY

Gosh, you're tough.

HALLENBECK

Get in the fucking car.

JIMMY

You got any hobbies?

(CONTINUED)

53.

HALLENBECK

Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair

ventriloquist.

JIMMY

Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps

and Bs are the hardest.

HALLENBECK

Yeah, well, actually --

JIMMY

(interrupts)

Hey, you got any tapes in here?

(leans forward)

Man, what is this shit? Dick

Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick

Haymes? Jeez, you must be older

than I thought.

JIMMY

What's the matter? Stomach

problems?

HALLENBECK

Ear problems.

JIMMY

What kind of ear problems?

HALLENBECK

The kind that won't shut up.

JIMMY

Baynard, huh? What's the matter,

you got some kind of beef with the

guy?

HALLENBECK

You might say that.

JIMMY

You wanna share with the class?

HALLENBECK

(sighs)

Bastard got me fired from my old

job.

(CONTINUED)

54.

JIMMY

Yeah? What were you, cop or

something?

HALLENBECK

Secret Service.

JIMMY

You're high. Get outta here.

(grins)

Really...? You protected the man?

Holy shit, you musta got laid every

night.

HALLENBECK

That's me. Every night.

(beat)

Where did Cory live?

JIMMY

She had an apartment on the West

Side. Why?

HALLENBECK

I want to check it out.

JIMMY

I thought you were off the case.

HALLENBECK

(scowls)

Look, dipshit, I told you that to

keep you out of my hair.

(pause)

My client's dead and I haven't

earned my fee.

JIMMY

Whoa, back up. You mean, we're

gonna nail these fuckers after

all...?

(grins)

Damn. I knew there was a hero

lurking beneath that gruff

exterior.

HALLENBECK

Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck

up.

55.

HALLENBECK

Bet these places run a fortune.

JIMMY

Tell me about it. I'm paying the

fucking rent.

HALLENBECK

How charming. Sounds like a great

girl. What else did you spring

for? Clothes? Car payments?

JIMMY

Wasn't like that. Cory could've

had lots of rich guys. Me, she

loved.

HALLENBECK

Oh. Love.   Well, forget about it,

then.

JIMMY

Let me guess.    You don't believe

in love.

HALLENBECK

(lights a cigarette)

I believe in cancer. I believe in

love.

JIMMY

What, they're both diseases?

HALLENBECK

Something like that.

JIMMY

Man, I don't want to meet the

bitch that fucked you up.

HALLENBECK

I'm sure she'd love meeting you.

Probably blow you on the front

porch.

JIMMY

Little bitter, Joe?

HALLENBECK

Eat shit.

56.

HALLENBECK

The cops are gonna want to check

this place out, so don't disturb

anything.

JIMMY

Yes, massah.

JIMMY

I think someone disturbed some

stuff, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Well, shit. Looks like somebody

beat us to it.

JIMMY

Beat us to what?

HALLENBECK

Whatever evidence Cory was

holding.

JIMMY

Assuming there was any.     Stay here

a minute.

HALLENBECK

Where you going?

JIMMY

Bathroom. You wanna come with me?

Doctor said I shouldn't lift

anything heavy.

HALLENBECK

I'll pass.

57.

HALLENBECK

Looks like you made it, baby.

JIMMY

Find anything?

HALLENBECK

Yeah, there's some really nice

rubble.

(CONTINUED)

58.

JIMMY

I may have something.

HALLENBECK

What?

JIMMY

Later.   Let's get out of here.

HALLENBECK

Where the hell are you going?

JIMMY

As long as we're here, I might as

well take Cory's car.

HALLENBECK

You got the keys?

JIMMY

Yeah.    I'll follow you.

HALLENBECK

Cory has two cars?

JIMMY

Yeah. This one's just sitting

here until she can sell it.

HALLENBECK

Jimmy, no!!

JIMMY

Ouch -- !     What's your problem?

(CONTINUED)

59.

HALLENBECK

They used a car bomb on Mike, it

figures they'd try it on her, too.

(stands)

Except they wired the wrong car.

JIMMY

Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez.

HALLENBECK

Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We

caught it in time.

JIMMY

What are you doing?

HALLENBECK

Gotta disconnect the fucker.

JIMMY

Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we

call the bomb squad or something?

HALLENBECK

(smiles)

Relax, Junior, I used to do this

for a living.

HALLENBECK

You wanna do it?

JIMMY

No, man, I --

(CONTINUED)

60.

HALLENBECK

Come on, chickenshit. Just snip

the wire.

HALLENBECK

Oh, shit not that one!

JIMMY

You're a fucking asshole!

HALLENBECK

And then some, Junior. And then

some.

TIME CUT TO:

HALLENBECK

We'll hand this over to the cops.

They can analyze it.

JIMMY

Great.   So what now?

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

You tell me, kid.

JIMMY

Give up?     Flee? Go really far

away?

HALLENBECK

I got a better idea. Let's check

in with my family.

HALLENBECK

I'm tired.    You drive.

(CONTINUED)

61.

JIMMY

Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids?

HALLENBECK

Yeah.   Little girl.

JIMMY

Does she like you?

HALLENBECK

Not much, no. And she likes

Prince, so go figure.

JIMMY

I like Prince.

HALLENBECK

Great, you can marry my daughter.

Or better yet, fuck my wife. I

hear all it takes is a credit card

and two valid I.D.'s.

(beat)

Open the trunk.

JIMMY

(indicating bomb)

You're just gonna stick that in

your trunk?

HALLENBECK

(nods)

You're right. Let's leave it

here for the neighborhood kids

to play with.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hold it right there, gentlemen.

JIMMY

Is it the cops?

HALLENBECK

No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops.

(CONTINUED)

62.

TALL MAN

Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late

for a stroll, don't you think?

HALLENBECK

Yeah, you two better be getting

home.

JIMMY

The streetlights are on.

TALL MAN

That's amusing. How delightful

to find such amusing men so late

at night.

(beat)

I don't believe I've had the

pleasure.

HALLENBECK

No, I don't believe you have.

(to Jimmy)

He'd like to have the pleasure.

JIMMY

Tell him it's not for sale.

HALLENBECK

He says it's --

SHORT MAN

What's your name, fuckface?

HALLENBECK

(shakes his head)

I'm asshole. He's fuckface.

TALL MAN

Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield

here of his situation.

(CONTINUED)

63.

TALL MAN

Perhaps we can dispense with the

fun and games now, yes?

HALLENBECK

(gasping)

Easy... Jim... All they want is

the evidence...

TALL MAN

The evidence. Very smart. See,

Jake, he knows when a situation is

untenable.

(smiles)

You like that word?

HALLENBECK

Great word.

TALL MAN

It occurs to me that you may have

the evidence in question.

HALLENBECK

(spits out blood)

Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing

with geniuses.

JIMMY

Leave him alone, you fuck!

HALLENBECK

Back off, Jimmy.

TALL MAN

Leave him alone...?

(shrugs)

Whatever you say. Jake?

(CONTINUED)

64.

TALL MAN

(sighs)

Ah, my young friend... I neglected

to tell you that Jake attacks his

job with a certain... exuberance.

JIMMY

Christ... I'm being beat up by the

inventor of Scrabble.

TALL MAN

He's still in a good mood, Jake.

Kick him again.

HALLENBECK

Wait!

HALLENBECK

You want the fucking evidence that

the stripper had. I've got it.

So we can play games, or I can

hand it over.

JIMMY

And then you'll let us go, right?

TALL MAN

Sure.  We'll let you go.

(to Hallenbeck)

Where is it?

HALLENBECK

Hand me the car keys, Jimmy.

TALL MAN

Walk over and hand him the keys.

Slow and easy.

HALLENBECK

The evidence is in the trunk.

TALL MAN

Open it.     Slow.

(CONTINUED)

65.

HALLENBECK

I don't think so.

HALLENBECK

Oops.    I guess nobody gets it.

TALL MAN

You dumb bastard, you're going to

pay for that. Jake, open the

trunk.

(CONTINUED)

66.

JIMMY

Jesus fucking Christ!

(CONTINUED)

67.

HALLENBECK

You alive?

JIMMY

Don't know yet.

JIMMY

The dynamite?

HALLENBECK

Either that, or we're looking at

a major factory recall.

JIMMY

Dead guys... don't make bad jokes,

right?

HALLENBECK

Right.

JIMMY

So we're alive.

HALLENBECK

Yeah.    Hooray.

HALLENBECK

Go.   Get out of here.

JIMMY

What?

HALLENBECK

Get the fuck out of here, I'll

take the heat on this one. Rent

a car. Then go home and wait for

my call. Do it.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

68.

BESSALO

Goddammit, this is a police matter,

you son of a bitch! I'm sick and

fucking tired of sweeping up your

dead bodies, Joe, and the next time

I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a

bullet in it. You got that? You

are off the case, buddy. Is that

clear?

CUT TO:

JIMMY

If you thought there was dynamite

in the trunk, wait'll you see this.

JIMMY

The guy on the left is Connie

Marcon, the owner of the L.A.

Stallions.

HALLENBECK

Forget about him. Look at the

guy on the right.

JIMMY

Sort of familiar. Who is he?

HALLENBECK

Senator Calvin Baynard.

JIMMY

Let's go back to the cops.   I'm

scared.

HALLENBECK

Take it easy, kid. It's not so

bad.

(CONTINUED)

69.

JIMMY

Not so bad. Excuse me, did you

just say the words not so bad?

You don't understand, Joe, see,

if a guy vomits on the sidewalk,

you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not

so bad, there's some ham in there.'

It's fucking vomit, okay? This is

bad.

HALLENBECK

When I was thirty, I was on the

President's personal security

force. Once night I was on the

way home from a late session. I'm

on the highway just outside of

Georgetown when I see something

up ahead.

(CONTINUED)

70.

HALLENBECK (V.O.)

It was a high-speed collision.

Both cars were totaled. The woman

and the boy were dead. The driver

of the other car wasn't.

DRUNK

Fuckin' bitch... She got in front

of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car.

Stupid bitch wrecked my car...

DRUNK

Do you know who I am...? I'm

Louis Baynard, my father is

Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my

father, he'll take care of it.

DRUNK

You'll tell 'em what happened,

right...? Bitch swerved in front

of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin'

Mercedes. Right...?

HALLENBECK (V.O.)

I could smell bourbon on him, big

time. He was  standing there, not

a scratch on him. I went a little

nuts. I hit  him.

HALLENBECK

The blow was non-lethal. But when

he fell, his head hit the pavement

funny. Put him in a coma.

(CONTINUED)

71.

SNAP BACK TO:

HALLENBECK

Even when he came out of it, he

was never right in the head. His

dad fixed everything with the cops.

The accident report disappeared. A

week later the police found half a

kilo of crack cocaine planted in

my house. Acting on an anonymous

tip.

JIMMY

The senator fucked your job.

HALLENBECK

And my pension. And my marriage.

Only reason I'm still licensed to

carry a gun, the man himself made

a few calls. Since then I'm just

playing it out. Day by day.

JIMMY

Cory tumbled to some sort of deal

between Marcon and the senator,

and they had her killed.

(beat)

We gotta show this photo to the

cops.

HALLENBECK

Not yet. I need more evidence.

(beat)

I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to

bring him down. I could use your

help.

JIMMY

Why should I help you?

HALLENBECK

Because if Baynard takes a fall, so

does Marcon. The man who kicked you

out of professional football.

72.

GIRL

I want the sheets changed, Milo.

MILO (MAN)

Of course you do, but we're running

behind, dearest.

GIRL

I don't give a shit. I'm an

actress, not a piece of meat, and

I want clean sheets!

MILO

Fine. It's done. Right after

this next shot.

MILO

Okay, let's do it.

(beat)

Roll camera.

CAMERAMAN

Rolling.

MILO

And... action!

GIRL

Milo... What the fuck is this,

some kind of joke?

(CONTINUED)

73.

MILO

Not at all, dearest. It's what's

known as a snuff film.

GIRL

Oh God Milo please oh God oh no

please Miloooo!!

MILO

Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece

of meat.

MILO

Yes, Mr. Marcon? How can I help

you?

MARCON (V.O.)

Is this line secure?

MILO

One hundred percent, sir. I

wouldn't have used your name

otherwise.

MARCON (V.O.)

Sid and Jake are dead, Milo.

Killed in an explosion. Looks

like we got a new player in the

game.

MILO

Who is he working for?

MARCON (V.O.)

From available information, he

appears to be a free agent. Guy

by the name of Joe Hallenbeck.

(CONTINUED)

74.

MARCON (V.O.)

Get me everything you can on this

fucker, Milo. I want it on my

computer screen in fifteen minutes.

MILO

Yes, sir.   And then?

MARCON (V.O.)

And then you'll be handling it

personally.

JIMMY

So I get to meet your family, huh?

What's your daughter like?

HALLENBECK

She's like thirteen. And if you

even look at her funny, I'll shove

an umbrella up your ass and open

it.

HALLENBECK

First things first. I'm starving.

(notices Darian)

Hey, kiddo. Why aren't you in

bed?

DARIAN

I'm watching television.

HALLENBECK

I can see that.

DARIAN

I hate you.   Leave me alone.

(CONTINUED)

75.

HALLENBECK

She's pissed off because I wouldn't

let her go out on a date with her

friend Billy.

DARIAN

I missed the biggest party of the

year.

JIMMY

Why couldn't she go?

HALLENBECK

(incredulous)

Because she's thirteen, that's why.

(to Darian)

I bought you some ice cream.

DARIAN

I'm not talking to you.

HALLENBECK

Gee, that's a shame. You always

have such pleasant things to say.

'I hate you, Dad.' I'm gonna miss

that, darn it...

(beat)

It's chocolate chip, your favorite.

DARIAN

I don't care.    You're an asshole.

HALLENBECK

That's for saying asshole. God, I

hate wasting food. Wanna abuse me

some more? Go ahead, shock me.

You know, I hardly ever hear the

word asshole.

DARIAN

Bullshit, I bet you get it all the

time.

HALLENBECK

All right, knock it off.

(CONTINUED)

76.

DARIAN

What're you gonna do, ground me

some more?

HALLENBECK

Hey, you want it, you got it, lady.

DARIAN

Thank you, asshole.

HALLENBECK

You're grounded for a week.

DARIAN

Yes, sir, asshole.

HALLENBECK

That's two. You wanna play this

game? I love this game.

DARIAN

Just leave me alone.

(to Jimmy)

He thinks he's fuckin' Ward

Cleaver.

HALLENBECK

All right, that's it. You wanna

be a gutter mouth? You wanna

sound like your mother, well

that's terrific. Christ, all day

long I don't take enough abuse,

I gotta listen to shit from you!

JIMMY

Hey, Joe, take it easy...

HALLENBECK

Don't you tell me how to talk to

my kid.

DARIAN

All I wanted was to go to a party,

but Pop here thinks I'm out to

get laid.

HALLENBECK

Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty

words. Come on, shock me. Go

ahead.

DARIAN

Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up.

(CONTINUED)

77.

HALLENBECK

All right, I've had it. Go to

your room. Or I will whip your

behind.

DARIAN

You'd probably like it.

HALLENBECK

Goddammit, you are my daughter

and you will respect me, got that?

You got it? You don't ever call

me a fuck-up.

DARIAN

Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you

that all the time.

HALLENBECK

Your mother called me a fuck-up...?

When?

DARIAN

On the phone to Uncle Jay.

HALLENBECK

Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a

fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now

there's a real stand-up guy.

Shit, the bastard cheats on his

tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't

done time! Why don't you ask your

mother why Mister Wonderful isn't

in jail for tax evasion?

DARIAN

(smiles)

Because he doesn't fuck up.

JIMMY

You know, for fifty bucks you could

get a guy to pull out her

fingernails with a pair of pliers.

(CONTINUED)

78.

HALLENBECK

No. Anything that much fun, I'd

want to do myself.

JIMMY

I think we could both use a drink.

JIMMY

That's you?

HALLENBECK

Yeah.    That's me.

JIMMY

You look like the dad on 'The

Brady Bunch.'

HALLENBECK

Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout.

JIMMY

So.    You gonna get a divorce?

HALLENBECK

Don't know.

JIMMY

You don't like women much, do you,

Joe?

HALLENBECK

(mouth full)

Mike Miller wasn't the first time.

Sarah has cheated on me before.

Twice. I never told her I knew.

At first, my opinion of women

took a real dip, yeah.

JIMMY

And now?

HALLENBECK

Now I'm content if I like the guy

she's fucking. This last one was

my best friend.

(CONTINUED)

79.

JIMMY

Horseshit, he was a scumbag private

eye.

HALLENBECK

What am I, Jimmy?

JIMMY

He tried to get you killed.

HALLENBECK

Friends can't be perfect.

(sighs)

I wish the sky wasn't blue. I

wish water wasn't wet. I wish I

didn't still love my wife.

JIMMY

You know what I did last night?

HALLENBECK

What?

JIMMY

I went to a party and shit on a car.

HALLENBECK

Damn.   You, too?

JIMMY

I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.'

All I ever wanted... was to be

somebody's hero, you know it...?

Now I mostly sit around. Watch

T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking

slug, throw salt on me I'd curl

up. Life sucks.

HALLENBECK

You're wrong.

JIMMY

Life doesn't suck?

HALLENBECK

No, life sucks. But you're not a

loser. Cory loved you.

JIMMY

Yeah, and the last thing I did was

cheat on her.

(beat)

Why do people cheat, Joe?

(CONTINUED)

80.

HALLENBECK

Because it's easier than paying

the tax, Junior.

JIMMY

Ooooooh.     Very deep.

HALLENBECK

So deep I don't know what the fuck

it means.

JIMMY

It means another drink is required.

JIMMY

Alex the accountant.

HALLENBECK

Is Alex your accountant?

JIMMY

No.  But he could have been.

(beat)

Alex was my son.

JIMMY

I was married at 19. Sweet young

thing, looking to get out from

under daddy's thumb. I didn't

know she was a junkie. All during

her pregnancy. Shooting up. There

were complications. She died.

Alex lived for seventeen minutes

in the incubator. Fell asleep.

Died before he woke up.

(takes a drink)

He was born... He had time for

one dream... and then he died.

I wonder what his dream was

about.

HALLENBECK

I'm sorry.

JIMMY

I think about him a lot.     I mean,

who was this... guy?

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

81.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

This little guy who only got

seventeen minutes, who was he,

Joe...? What was he like?

(beat)

What would he have been?

HALLENBECK

He would have been a great

ball player. Like his dad.

JIMMY

(shakes his head)

No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't

you see?

HALLENBECK

Why did he have to die?

JIMMY

(softly)

Because he came out of me.

JIMMY

I'm gonna borrow your shower.

HALLENBECK

Not in my house, you dumb

motherfucker.

(CONTINUED)

82.

JIMMY

Joe, man, you don't get it --

HALLENBECK

Shut up.

HALLENBECK

This is what you went looking for

in Cory's apartment, isn't it?

You found this when you found that

envelope.

JIMMY

Joe, please!

JIMMY

You stupid bastard, do you know

what you've done? That was a

thousand bucks' worth of shit!

HALLENBECK

You got it, son. I'm just mixing

it in with all the other shit.

(beat)

Get the fuck out of my house. Now.

JIMMY

You don't understand.

HALLENBECK

I said, get out. I'll break your

fucking neck, kiddo.

JIMMY

Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead.

(beat)

I'm trying to survive, man. I use

that stuff to get by, so fuck you.

HALLENBECK

I don't use it. I get by.

(CONTINUED)

83.

JIMMY

Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right,

you stand there and judge me, and,

meanwhile, you never had your old

lady die on you, did you, pal??

And your fucking kid?? And I said

to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives?

I go to church, I give to the

United Way, what is this dead wife

and kid shit...?' And he didn't

say nothin', Joe.

JIMMY

And then I lose my job, my fucking

life, okay, and why...? You know

why? Because I gambled. Whoa,

hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy

gambled, well shit, of course I

gambled, everybody does, and the

fucking league knows it!

JIMMY

Why, Joe? Why is there an injury

report in pro football, huh...?

Nobody else has a fucking injury

report, but the N.F.L. does, so

the fucking gamblers will know the

spread! Marcon... the commissioner

... those fucking hypocrites...

killed the last thing I could do,

Joe...! I can't do anything...

anymore.

JIMMY

I couldn't save my wife... She

died screaming and I couldn't do a

Goddamn thing... And my baby came

out... and he was so fuckin'

small, Joe... He was too fuckin'

small...

(CONTINUED)

84.

HALLENBECK

When you're through feeling sorry

for yourself, the front door's

that way.

JIMMY

(wipes his eyes)

You're a total bastard.

HALLENBECK

You brought cocaine in my house.

End of story.

DARIAN

You're Jimmy Dix, aren't you?

JIMMY

Huh?

DARIAN

I'm sorry I acted like a bitch.

Would you sign my card?

HALLENBECK

I told you to go to your room.

DARIAN

But, Dad -- !

HALLENBECK

Go to bed.   This guy's not signing

anything.

DARIAN

Aw, come off it.

HALLENBECK

Forget it, Darian.

(beat)

The guy's a loser. Big time.

(CONTINUED)

85.

JIMMY

I never shaved points, Joe.     I

never did.

JIMMY

If you want my help, I'm at the

Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura.

HALLENBECK

Smile, you fuck.

DARIAN

Billy...

86.

HALLENBECK

Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- !

MILO

Good morning, Joseph.

CUT TO:

87.

PABLO

Good morning, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Who are you, and how the fuck do

you know my name?

CHET

(frowns)

This is the guy? You sure it's

the guy?

PABLO

This is him.

CHET

The kid with the million-dollar

arm?

PABLO

Yeah.

CHET

Shit. He don't look like much.     I

wouldn't pay no million dollars

for this bozo.

PABLO

Neither will anyone else, anymore.

JIMMY

I'm growing whiskers here, guys.

You got something to say, fucking

say it.

CHET

Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have

caught it from his buddy

Hallenbeck.

(CONTINUED)

88.

JIMMY

Who?

PABLO

Don't play dumb, shithead. You

were with him last night at the

club.

CHET

Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a

lesson, Jimmy. Something about

keeping your big coked-up nose

out of his fucking business.

PABLO

Get ready, kid. This one's an E

ticket.

JIMMY

Please, guys, don't do this...

Jesus Christ, I was just her

boyfriend, I swear to God, please!

(CONTINUED)

89.

JIMMY

Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm,

oh Jesus Christ!!!

McCASKEY

I got bad news and bad news.

BESSALO

Gimmee the bad news first.

McCASKEY

Bad news is, they just pulled

Jimmy Dix out of a construction

site on Ventura. He's busted up.

BESSALO

Okay, now gimme the bad news.

McCASKEY

I just got a call from Hallenbeck's

neighbor.

McCASKEY

Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike

Miller came to the house early

that morning to talk about a case,

right?

BESSALO

Right.

(CONTINUED)

90.

McCASKEY

Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's

neighbor claims that Miller's car

was parked there all night, in the

same spot?

BESSALO

He lied.   Why did he lie...?

BESSALO

Shit.   Miller was fucking his

wife.

McCASKEY

What?

BESSALO

That's why the car was there,

Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's

wife, Hallenbeck just got back

from out of town, remember?

(beat)

Christ, Joe wasted the bastard

himself!

BESSALO

I want an A.P.B. out on Joe

Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and

if he resists arrest, shoot the

bastard.

BESSALO

I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike

Miller and waltzed right out of my

office, I let him go, Goddammit!

McCASKEY

Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in.

He's not that good.

BESSALO

You wanna bet?

CUT TO:

91.

CHET

I think he's awake.

PABLO

Make sure.

HALLENBECK

I'm awake.

CHET

You nearly broke my wrist, man.

HALLENBECK

Life's a bitch.

(CONTINUED)

92.

PABLO

Milo warned us to watch out for

this guy.

CHET

Fuck that. Look at him. He's

nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit.

HALLENBECK

Anybody got a cigarette...?

CHET

Sure, buddy.     I got a cigarette.

CHET

(guffaws)

Hey, baby, I thought you were

tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so

bad.

HALLENBECK

I seem to have dropped my

cigarette. May I have another?

CHET

(unnerved)

Sure.   Sure thing, buddy.

(CONTINUED)

93.

HALLENBECK

I need a light.

(beat)

And if you touch me again... I'll

kill you.

CHET

Baby!   Two for two!

PABLO

Jesus Christ.

(draws his gun)

You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!!

PABLO

You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you

killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!!

(CONTINUED)

94.

MILO

Is there a problem?

PABLO

(still dazed)

He killed Chet, Milo. The mother-

fucker just killed him!

MILO

Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph,

Joseph, you don't disappoint me.

MILO

You seem to have killed one of

my men.

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

I needed a light.

MILO

You took an awful risk. Pablo

here could have shot you dead.

HALLENBECK

If you wanted me dead, you'd have

already killed me.

MILO

Yes, that's true.

(sits down)

I suppose introductions are in

order.

HALLENBECK

(waves his hand)

Fuck it. You're the bad guy,

right?

(CONTINUED)

95.

MILO

Yes.   I'm the bad guy.

HALLENBECK

And you've got the gun, and I'm

supposed to tremble in fear,

something like that?

MILO

Something like that.

HALLENBECK

Fine. I'll start trembling in a

minute. Mind if I have a drink

first?

MILO

(smiles)

I don't see why not. Pablo,

please take Chet's corpse into

the other room, and then fix Mr.

Hallenbeck a drink.

VOICE (O.S.)

Make that two.

HALLENBECK

Hey, look who's here. Connie

Marcon himself.

MARCON

Careful, son. Only my friends

call me Connie.

HALLENBECK

You got friends? When did this

happen?

MARCON

(chuckles)

I'll give you one thing. You're

pretty calm for a man in your

position.

(CONTINUED)

96.

HALLENBECK

You're pretty calm for a man whose

team is three and six on the year.

MARCON

They're having some problems.

HALLENBECK

They stink.

MARCON

I'm glad you're here, Joe. We

got a few things to discuss.

MARCON

For starters, I'm sure you're

aware that professional football

is changing, and not for better.

(lights a cigar)

Used to be, you went to the local

stadium come Sunday, you saw

heroes. Guys who fought for

their hometown. Anymore, no one

gives a shit. Ever since Sonny

Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe

Namath back in '66, the sons of

bitches just got greedier.

Playing only for themselves.

Giving nothing back to the game.

MARCON

This year, the final blow: the

N.F.L. votes to decertify the

Players Organization. Eliminates

the draft, reduces all athletes

to free agents. Reduces football,

once and for all, to commerce. To

greed, you follow?

HALLENBECK

When do I say the Pledge of

Allegiance?

(CONTINUED)

97.

MARCON

Do you know how many ratings points

Monday Night Football lost this

year? Per week? An average of

two point eight.

HALLENBECK

Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling

me this whole thing is about TV

ratings?

MARCON

People have stopped watching, Joe!

Everybody's turning the channel,

they're still looking for heroes,

you follow? Guys like you. Milo

here tells me you took a bullet

for the President, jumped in front

of a sniper rifle.

MILO

We took the liberty of researching

your background.

MARCON

How about it, Joe? Is it truth or

hype?

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

I got the rifle in my closet as a

souvenir.

MARCON

There you go, that's what I'm

saying. The public wants real

heroes. Not a bunch of football

prima donnas, jumping from team

to team with their fancy lawyers.

(beat)

In fact, Joe, and this is my

point, there's only one reason

left nowadays to watch pro-

football. Can you guess?

HALLENBECK

Gambling.

(CONTINUED)

98.

MARCON

Exactly. Gambling.

(puffs his cigar)

Just one problem: football

gambling is illegal in all but

two of the fifty states. And

that, Joe boy, is where I come in.

HALLENBECK

(sudden realization)

Shit, that's what this is about!

You're bribing United States

senators. Paying them to pass

legislation --

MARCON

-- Legalizing football gambling

in all fifty states. Exactly.

HALLENBECK

Attendance goes up again.   TV

ratings go up again.

MARCON

You got it, son. The networks are

happy. I'm happy. Everybody's

happy.

HALLENBECK

Before we get too fucking happy,

let's get a couple things straight:

first, I'm not your fucking son,

and second... why am I still alive?

MARCON

It's like this, Joe: everything

was going great until a couple

weeks ago, and then I hit a snag:

Senator Calvin Baynard.

HALLENBECK

(takes a sip of bourbon)

I don't get it. What's the snag?

MARCON

I offered him the bribe and he

wouldn't take it.

(CONTINUED)

99.

HALLEBECK

Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's

so crooked he shits slinkies.

MARCON

Allow me to clarify: I offered

him the bribe, and he turned it

down because he wanted more money.

HALLENBECK

(sighs with relief)

Thank God. For a minute there I

felt hell freezing over. Did he

ask for more than a million?

MARCON

Does the Pope shit in the woods?

He wants two million or he'll

blow the lid off my whole plan.

I don't feel like paying no two

mil, so basically that good ole'

boy's gotta die.

HALLENBECK

Taking off a U.S. senator, that's

pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole

like you.

MARCON

Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard,

Joe.

HALLENBECK

Who is?

HALLENBECK

Oh, shit.

HALLENBECK

I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone

and his uncle Max knows I hate

Baynard.

MARCON

(nods)

Anything goes wrong, all the heat

lands on you, Joe boy. My hands

are clean.

(CONTINUED)

100.

HALLENBECK

Any particular reason I should go

along with this prize-winning

scheme?

MARCON

(smiles)

Just one.

MARCON

Sit down, Joe.

SARAH

Do what he says, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Are you alright, Sarah?

SARAH

Yes.

MILO

That's a temporary condition,

Joseph. As you may be aware,

there are distributors in Mexico

who positively crave snuff films.

And unless you do every fucking

thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your

wife will make her motion picture

debut.

101.

JIMMY

Look, I'll say it again for the

cheap seats: I don't know

anything and I can't help you.

Okay? Can I go now?

BESSALO

Let me get this straight: you're

walking along, minding your own

business, when two guys you never

met jump you and throw you in a

ditch for no particular reason.

Is that it?

JIMMY

That's it.

BESSALO

You're full of shit, kid.

(beat)

Tell me where Hallenbeck is.

JIMMY

How the fuck should I know?    Try

his house.

BESSALO

We did.   Where is he?

JIMMY

For Chrissake, I just met the guy.

(beat)

Look, Sergeant. I don't give a

shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just

busted my throwing arm and I'm

in a real pissy mood, so you got

two choices: either charge me

with something or let me the fuck

outta here.

CUT TO:

102.

JIMMY

Hey.    Wake up.

MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US

CALL THE POLICE AND WE'LL KILL THEM BOTH.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

103.

PABLO

Get up.

HALLENBECK

Go fuck yourself.

HALLENBECK

I meant that... in a good way...

PABLO

Time for a little payback, Joe.

Call it a service to dear departed

Chet.

PABLO

How's that feel, fuckhead?

HALLENBECK

(weakly)

I'm asshole... she's fuckhead.

MILO

Easy, Pablo.   I want him conscious.

SARAH

Goddamn you, stop it!!     Oh, Jesus,

leave him alone!

(CONTINUED)

104.

HALLENBECK

Don't... look at me...

SARAH

Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here,

it's okay.

(strokes his hair)

I love you, Joe.

HALLENBECK

I get the shit beat out of me...

puke all over myself... and now

you love me?

SARAH

I never stopped loving you, Joe.

HALLENBECK

Christ, you slept with three guys.

SARAH

You knew about the others?

HALLENBECK

I knew.

SARAH

You never said anything.

HALLENBECK

Figured... you needed them.

SARAH

Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you

say something?

HALLENBECK

Like what?   'Fuck you, Sarah'?

SARAH

Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything

to show that you... that you had

some pride left.

(CONTINUED)

105.

HALLENBECK

Sorry... I'm fresh out.

SARAH

I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of

this.

HALLENBECK

Must be my trick ear. Sounded

like you said, 'Get me out of

this.'

SARAH

You can take these guys, Joe.

HALLENBECK

I've got cracked ribs and a

concussion.

SARAH

Save me, Joe.    Be a hero.

HALLENBECK

I don't believe in heroes.

SARAH

That's no excuse.

HALLENBECK

Fuck you, Sarah...

PABLO

All right, lovebirds, break it up.

PABLO

Nice tits.

(CONTINUED)

106.

PABLO

Stay down, fucker. Don't you

move.

MILO

Careful, Pablo. We don't want to

get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in

front of hubby.

MILO

Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time

to go, and remember: you follow

orders, or the missus pays the

price.

HALLENBECK

You're gonna kill us both anyway.

MILO

Perhaps. But there are ways to

die, and then there are... ways to

die. Capisce? You determine your

wife's fate.

SARAH

Joe...!

(CONTINUED)

107.

HALLENBECK

I'll be back.

(beat)

That's a promise.

MILO

You're wasting my time, Joseph.

Let's go.

HALLENBECK

If you touch me again... I'll kill

you.

JIMMY

I need to borrow a gun, Henry.

MARCON

Marcon.

108.

MILO

It's Milo, sir. We're now underway

and should be lying off Catalina

within two hours.

MARCON

Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's

party starts at six. I'll put in

a token appearance around six-thirty.

MILO

Very good, sir.

MARCON

Any problems with Hallenbeck?

MILO

No, we're getting along famously.

MARCON

Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo.

I want him deep-sixed.

MILO

I assure you, neither he nor the

senator will see another sunrise.

MARCON

Christ, Milo, how come you always

have to talk like a fruit?

MILO

If it annoys you, I    could always

adopt a Texas drawl,    though I'm

afraid I don't know    any stories

about fucking pigs.     Sir.

MARCON

Cows, Milo.   Never pigs.

MILO

I'll remember that, sir.

MARCON

Goddamn fruitcake.

(CONTINUED)

109.

MARCON

So far, so good.

STRANGE MAN

We've worked too hard, Con.

There's no margin for error.

MARCON

Take it easy, buddy.   We're

covered.

STRANGE MAN

You're using the first team, yes?

MARCON

Absolutely.

(sighs)

Actually, I have no choice.

STRANGE MAN

How's that?

MARCON

Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the

second and third teams.

DARIAN

What do you need a boat for?

JIMMY

I'm gonna crash a party out on

Catalina. Marcon will be there.

DARIAN

Maybe... we should call the

police.

(CONTINUED)

110.

JIMMY

No, honey. Not now. There's some

big shots involved in this mess,

and it's my word against theirs.

If I blab to the cops, your mom

and dad will disappear and they'll

never find the bodies.

(beat)

I'm sorry, Darian.

DARIAN

(about to cry)

So... what do we do...?

JIMMY

What I do... is confront Conrad

Marcon and threaten to go to the

cops, unless he gives them back.

DARIAN

Is that gonna work?

JIMMY

Beats me, but I think it's what

your dad would do.

DARIAN

I'm scared.

JIMMY

Me, too, honey.

JIMMY

So... why'd you come to me,

anyhow?

DARIAN

I don't know. I thought you'd...

know what happened, know what to

do...

(beat)

I mean, you were one of my dad's

big heroes.

JIMMY

What?

(CONTINUED)

111.

DARIAN

When I was little, he used to talk

about you all the time. Best

football player in the game.

Great this. Wonderful that. You

shoulda seen him when you got

busted.

JIMMY

I'll get them back, kiddo.   I'll

get them back.

CUT TO:

112.

CUT TO:

MILO

Your wife's very pretty.

HALLENBECK

Fuck you, cocksucker.

MILO

My, my.   Little testy this evening.

MILO

That's not very polite, you know,

calling someone a cocksucker. A

lot of hard Ks. Very abusive

sounding.

MILO

What would you do, Joseph, if

someone called you that? Would

you cut out one of his eyes...?

HALLENBECK

Nope.

MILO

What would you do?

(CONTINUED)

113.

HALLENBECK

I'd go off and suck some cock

and leave him the fuck alone.

MILO

It occurs to me, Joseph, that I

would very much like to hear you

scream.

HALLENBECK

Come again?

MILO

You're so cool, aren't you? So...

if you'll pardon the expression...

hard-boiled. I'd like, just once,

to hear you scream in pain.

HALLENBECK

Play some rap music.

MILO

Fascinating.

HALLENBECK

When do I kill Baynard?

MILO

(laughs)

Come now, Joseph, did you really

think that I'd hand you a loaded

gun?

(beat)

You're not really going to kill

anyone.

HALLENBECK

I'm not?

MILO

No.

MILO

You're going to be framed for the

senator's murder... when they find

your corpse at the scene of the

crime.

114.

JIMMY

Okay, hot shit, let's do it.

DARIAN (O.S.)

Nice tux.

JIMMY

Goddammit, I told you to go home!

DARIAN

Fuck you, I stowed away.    They're

my parents, okay?

JIMMY

Fine, whatever. Just stay here.

With the boat.

(CONTINUED)

115.

JIMMY

Anything funny happens, get the

fuck out of here.

DARIAN

You look terrible.

JIMMY

I feel terrible.

DARIAN

Are you really a drug addict?

JIMMY

I was.   I kicked the habit.

DARIAN

When?

JIMMY

This morning.    Stay here.

DARIAN

Don't let them break your other

arm.

JIMMY

Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin'

inspiration.

MILO

At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard

will leave the party, hopefully

unobserved. He and his entourage

will board a fast boat, and

rendezvous with us at sea.

HALLENBECK

Jesus. He thinks he's geting his

two-million-dollar payoff.

(CONTINUED)

116.

MILO

Baynard will not leave his boat.

One of his men will board us, and

inspect the contents of the

suitcase. This suitcast.

MILO

Then we pull a simple switch.

When the man returns to his boat,

he's carrying this suitcase.

HALLENBECK

Plastics?

MILO

(nods)

Detonation upon opening. Enough

to kill the passengers, not enough

to sink the craft.

(smiles)

And when we place your charred

corpse amidst the wreckage, the

police will draw the inevitable

conclusion: a down-on-his-luck

P.I. makes a suicide strike

against the man who cost a

career.

HALLENBECK

That sounds lovely, but how is my

body gonna get charred?

MILO

Maybe I'll get to hear you scream,

after all...

CREW MEMBER

You better get up here, we got

a problem.

117.

FISHERMAN

Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine

casing, I'm dead in the water!

Can I get a tow?

MILO

I'm sorry, sir. This boat is

Island Security, we're under

strict orders to stay within this

sector.

FISHERMAN

Aw, shit!     Look, it'll take ten

minutes!

MILO

I'm sorry, we can't help you.

FISHERMAN

Goddammit, now I gotta call the

Coast Guard!

CREW MEMBER

Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast

Guard down on top of us.

MILO

Excuse me.     Sir?

MILO

Fuck you, sir.

(CONTINUED)

118.

MILO

Problem solved. Get over there

and put the bodies below where

they can't be seen.

SENATOR

Christ, I can't believe I agreed

to this dog and pony show. Let's

get it over with.

JIMMY

Gimmee the keys, kiddo.

DARIAN

Where are you going?

(CONTINUED)

119.

JIMMY

The Senator's here, and he's

leaving by the back door. I'm

gonna follow him.

JIMMY

Get off the boat.

DARIAN

Fuck you, man. No way.

JIMMY

Darian, Goddammit --

DARIAN (O.S.)

I'm not coming out!

JIMMY

Okay.     Shit.   Okay.   Easy.   Shit.

Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go.

(points to

Hallenbeck)

Gag him and stash him.

JIMMY

Goddammit, I lost him.     I can't

see a fucking thing.

See if this boat has sonar.

JIMMY

Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.

Okay.   We're cool.

Hey! Any of you stupid fucks

bother to frisk this goombah?

No, sir, we didn't think --

Exactly, you didn't think!

Goddammit, that's two million

bucks there, now frisk the

Hey, baby, I'm clean, take it

easy --

MILO

Fuck easy. Against the wall,

spread 'em!

(CONTINUED)

122.

AIDE

Okay?   Satisfied?

MILO

We're cool, baby.

MILO

Hard to starboard, get us out of

here. Back off a hundred yards

and wait for the blast.

(CONTINUED)

123.

JIMMY

All we're doing is burning gas.

Sorry, kid, I'm turning back.

DARIAN

Do you hear that -- ?

JIMMY

Holy fucking shit!

PILOT

Code yellow, code yellow, we got

a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie,

over.

MILO

Air One, Air One, where the fuck

is he?

PILOT (V.O.)

Nine o'clock, repeat, on your

nine, and closing fast!

124.

JIMMY

Oh, wow.    We're fucked.

MAN

Shit!   Something's going on.

BAYNARD

What is it?

MAN

Another boat.    It's a fucking

setup!

BAYNARD

Get us out of here, now!

MILO

Who the fuck is he?

125.

CREWMAN

Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the

Goddamn quarterback!

CREWMAN (O.S.)

There's a little girl with him!

MILO

Air One, Air One, follow the

Senator, roger? I'll take the

sport boat, you take Baynard, over.

AIR ONE (V.O.)

That's a roger. Over and out.

MILO

(turns to his men)

Okay, let's go. Full throttle.

(CONTINUED)

126.

(CONTINUED)

127.

CREWMAN

Fire in the hole!

DARIAN

Daddy!!

JIMMY

Shit.    I don't believe it.

DARIAN

Do something!     Hurry!

(CONTINUED)

128.

JIMMY

Keep the wheel like this!   Don't

let it move!

JIMMY

Third and long, baby, lets' go...

DARIAN

Dad...!

(CONTINUED)

129.

HALLENBECK

What the hell's she doing here??

DARIAN

I stowed away...

HALLENBECK

Get below, Darian. And stay

there.

JIMMY

Got any ideas?

HALLENBECK

Yeah. Go really fast and hope

they don't catch us.

(beat)

Oh, shit.

JIMMY

What?

HALLENBECK

Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.

(CONTINUED)

130.

HALLENBECK

We're dead.

JIMMY

What the fuck? They're peeling

off. Why?

HALLENBECK

'Cause they got sonar, that's why!

Hard to port!

JIMMY

Port?

HALLENBECK

Left, Goddammit.

JIMMY

Shit fuck piss!

(CONTINUED)

131.

JIMMY

We're on half power, we lost an

engine!

JIMMY

We're sitting ducks. They got

sonar. They can find us.

HALLENBECK

Kill the running lights and radio

the Coast Guard.

JIMMY

Fuck me.

HALLENBECK

Get down!

132.

CUT TO:

HALLENBECK

What's that?

JIMMY

That's Baynard's boat!

HALLENBECK

(nods)

It can get us to shore faster than

this one, don't you think?

HALLENBECK

Hand me the pole.

JIMMY

What is it?

HALLENBECK

Birthday present.

(CONTINUED)

133.

JIMMY

Holy fucking shit!!

HALLENBECK

Wait here.

HALLENBECK

Sorry, Cal.    Life in the big city.

CUT TO:

134.

HALLENBECK

Listen carefully. I'm gonna go

get your mom back, okay? You're

gonna go in the Denny's restaurant

and stay there. Talk to the

waitress but don't mention me.

Mom and I will come pick you up

later, got it?

DARIAN

(crying)

They're gonna kill you...!

HALLENBECK

Are you kidding? I do this for a

living.

(hands her a twenty)

Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back.

(beat)

I love you.

CUT TO:

JIMMY

Your prints are all over that

boat. What happens when they find

the bodies inside?

HALLENBECK

Quit being a fuckin' killjoy.

HALLENBECK

Come on.   We've got some things to

pick up.

(CONTINUED)

135.

HALLENBECK

Shit.   Someone's staking me out.

JIMMY

(clears his throat)

Oh, I forgot to tell you. The

police want you for killing Mike

Miller.

CUT TO:

ENSIGN

I think I got someone!   Four

o'clock!

CUT TO:

136.

HALLENBECK

Let's get him inside and tie him

up.

JIMMY

Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You

don't punch cops!

HALLENBECK

I forgot.    Hurry up.

HALLENBECK

Wear that.

HALLENBECK

You know how to use a gun?

JIMMY

The trigger's the little black

thing.

HALLENBECK

Here.

(CONTINUED)

137.

HALLENBECK

Use these. They're shredders.

Equipped with an explosive charge.

When you fire the gun, they spray

on impact. Take out anything

within ten yards.

JIMMY

What are you gonna use?

HALLENBECK

A little souvenir...

HALLENBECK

Go bring the car around.

PABLO

Face it, pal.    You're fucked by

God.

CUT TO:

138.

PABLO

Are you a literate man, Joe?

HALLENBECK

I got a subscription to Jugs

magazine.

PABLO

That's good. See, Joe, what

you're gonna do, you're gonna

write a little story.

GOON

We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk.

PABLO

Get him out of here. Take him to

Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as

soon as my business here is

finished.

PABLO

Yeah, you're gonna write a little

story, Joe. About how guilt-

stricken you are over Senator

Baynard's death, which is all

over the air waves, by the way.

Yeah... you're so guilty about

paying those hitmen to kill him,

that you're gonna kill yourself.

HALLENBECK

Hey, who's writing this story?

You're doing all the good parts.

PABLO

Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to

include how guilty you are over

that cop you murdered.

HALLENBECK

What cop?

(CONTINUED)

139.

PABLO

That one.

HALLENBECK

You son of a bitch...!

HALLENBECK

We don't like Pablo very much, do

we, Furry Tom...?

HALLENBECK

(as Furry Tom)

No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo

is a motherless fuck who takes it

up the ass.

PABLO

Shit, is he doing that?

HALLENBECK

Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm

gonna do to him.

HALLENBECK

(as Furry Tom)

You're gong to make Pablo eat all

his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.

(CONTINUED)

140.

PABLO

That's amazing, man!

HALLENBECK

(as Furry Tom)

Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're

laughin' at me. That's not very

nice.

HALLENBECK

Are you mad, Furry Tom?

HALLENBECK

(as Furry Tom)

I don't get mad. I get even.

(CONTINUED)

141.

MARCON

You know I don't enjoy doin' this,

Jim.

MARCON

I remember how much you hated the

pain... You got hooked on Demerol,

didn't you...? I'll make a deal

with you. Tell me who you talked

to, and I'll give you all the

painkillers you can swallow.

JIMMY

Nobody knows. Just... just me...

and Hallenbeck...

MARCON

Now, see, I'd love to believe you.

But we are talking about the

future of my football team.

(CONTINUED)

142.

MARCON

And ain't nothin' more important

than my ball club, 'cept maybe my

collection of autographed

footballs. Got one of yours, you

know.

(softly)

Who'd you talk to, Jimmy?

JIMMY

Nobody...

HARDGUY

Mr. Marcon?

(CONTINUED)

143.

MARCON

He's nothing, he can't hurt us.

Take him somewhere and kill him.

HARDGUY

Yes, sir.

HALLENBECK

Don't.

HALLENBECK

The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin'

kill you. Where's my wife?

MARCON

I... I don't remember, I...

HALLENBECK

My wife.

HALLENBECK

The address.    Now!

MARCON

It's... Milo's film studio...

HALLENBECK

Write it down, dumbfuck.

(CONTINUED)

144.

HALLENBECK

Jimmy, you okay...?

JIMMY

Hurts like hell.

HALLENBECK

Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us

out of here, nice and easy, got

it?

(beat)

Can you walk, Jimmy?

JIMMY

Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind

you...!

STRANGE MAN

Drop it.

HALLENBECK

You drop it, asshole, or I kill

Marcon.

STRANGE MAN

Sorry, but that won't work. I

don't care if he lives or dies,

now drop the gun.

STRANGE MAN

Walk over there by your friend,

Joe.

145.

HALLENBECK

Well, Goddamn. How's the head,

Lou?

BAYNARD (STRANGE MAN)

Aside from permanent facial

neuralgia, just lovely.

HALLENBECK

Next time, Lou, just say no.

JIMMY

Shit. This is the drunk guy you

slugged, look what you did to his

face!

MARCON

You son of a bitch, you were gonna

let him kill me!

BAYNARD

Nothing more or less than you'd do

for me, Conrad.

(turns)

I never thought I'd see you again,

Joe.

HALLENBECK

Speaking of which, what the fuck

are you doing here?

BAYNARD

Call it a financial partnership.

For a price, I agreed to connect

Mr. Marcon to the necessary

people in Washington.

HALLENBECK

In other words, you dropped your

father's name a bunch of times.

(CONTINUED)

146.

BAYNARD

(ignores him)

But imagine my delight this morning,

Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me

of a golden opportunity: a chance

to kill my father and frame you for

the crime... What can I say,

inherit a fortune and humiliate you

in the bargain, who could resist?

HALLENBECK

Do I also have you to thank for

dragging me into this mess?

BAYNARD

(sighs)

It was I, unfortunately, who

bought a forty-dollar bottle of

champagne... spoke a little too

freely to that hooker.

JIMMY

She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.

HALLENBECK

He should know, Jimmy. With a

face like that, he's gotta be

paying for it.

BAYNARD

You can die fast or slow, so watch

your mouth.

JIMMY

We'd rather watch yours.   It's

goofy-lookin'.

MARCON

Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em

both!

JIMMY

Any bright ideas, Joe?

HALLENBECK

Gimmee a minute.

JIMMY

Excuse me, could you give him a

minute? He's trying to think of

a way out of this.

(CONTINUED)

147.

HALLENBECK

You know of course, Connie, that

you're a dead man.

MARCON

Wait.

MARCON

Let's humor this asshole.     What

are you talking about?

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

Nothing much, just that I made a

phone call from the boat on the

way in.

MARCON

You called the cops? Fuck it,

they can't prove a thing.

HALLENBECK

Oh, but I didn't call the cops.      I

called the mob.

HALLENBECK

See, Connie, every year, the mob

rakes in two and a half billion

from football bookmaking. If you

succeed in making gambling legal,

all that money goes to the

government.

(beat)

I wouldn't be surprised if they

put out a contract on you. Of

course, I might be able to call it

off.

(CONTINUED)

148.

MARCON

He's bluffing. He's not connected

to the mob, what a load of

horseshit. Nice try, asshole.

(waves his hand)

Kill them.

HALLENBECK

(plowing ahead)

Then there's the matter of two

million dollars. Or didn't you

know that watertight suitcases

float...?

HALLENBECK

I've got your money, Connie.

Stashed in the back of a rented

Subaru. We'll take you to it.

MARCON

(laughing)

Jesus, I don't believe it.    This

guy's a riot.

JIMMY

(sotto)

I don't think it's working, Joe.

Try another one.

HALLENBECK

Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna

try one, kid, go for it.

JIMMY

Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna

stand here and die. Mr. Marcon,

he's lying. We do have the money,

but it's not in a car, it's in a

storage locker. I have the key on

me. I'l hand it over if you let

me go.

MARCON

Where is the key, Jimmy?

(CONTINUED)

149.

JIMMY

It's stashed in my shorts.

MARCON

(nods)

All right. Slow and easy.

JIMMY

Sure.   Slow and easy.

JIMMY

Promise you'll let me go.

MARCON

Hell with that, son. Hand it over

or I'll have you kneecapped.

JIMMY

Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad.

See, it's one of those new plastic

keys. The kind that melt...?

JIMMY

I guess nobody gets the money.

MARCON

Pull it out of there!

(CONTINUED)

150.

HALLENBECK

Plastic keys...? The kind that

melt?

JIMMY

Hey.   Short notice, best I could

do.

HALLENBECK

You did fine, junior.

JIMMY

Learned it from a pro.     Come on.

JIMMY

Son of a bitch!

HALLENBECK

Forget about him. Let's get my

wife.

(CONTINUED)

151.

HALLENBECK

Get in.

HALLENBECK

On my way, honey, on my way...

MARCON

Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't

bluffing...

CUT TO:

152.

JIMMY

I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we

do it?

HALLENBECK

We get in, we get out. Shoot

anyone who's not my wife. Check

that: Don't shoot me.

CUT TO:

153.

HALLENBECK

Cut.

(CONTINUED)

154.

HALLENBECK

I'm here... it's all right...

I'm here...

CUT TO:

HALLENBECK

Drive one of their cars.    They

won't be needing them.

JIMMY

Where do you want me to go?

HALLENBECK

The two million bucks is still in

the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland

above Marcon's house. Go pick it

up and bring it to the office.

We're gonna go get Darian.

JIMMY

Yes, massah.

HALLENBECK

I'll take you and Darian to the

office. You can sleep there.

SARAH

Why can't we go home?

HALLENBECK

There's four corpses in the bedroom.

SARAH

Oh.

155.

HALLENBECK

Jimmy should be here any minute.

Then we gotta talk to the cops.

SARAH

Will the police catch Marcon?

HALLENBECK

Maybe. He's probably in some

secret crash pad, packing to leave

town.

SARAH

I remember when we got married...

My friends would talk about their

husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my

husband is a big-time publisher,'

or, 'My husband is a brilliant

lawyer...' I used to say, 'My

husband can stand over a shotgun

victim and eat a ham sandwich

without puking.'

HALLENBECK

Don't knock it. It's a skill.

SARAH

I want to try, Joe.   Do you still

want to try?

HALLENBECK

Ahh, shit. Looks like the local

constable has come to chat.

SARAH

Shall we invite him in?

HALLENBECK

No.   Stay here. I'll deal with

it.

(CONTINUED)

156.

HALLENBECK

That's not L.A.P.D....

HALLENBECK

Son of a bitch!

DARIAN

Mommy, what's happening?

157.

MILO

You fucked up my face, Joseph!

MILO

Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've

got all night, you fucked up my

face.

(CONTINUED)

158.

JIMMY

I don't fucking believe it.

MILO

You ruined my flesh!

(CONTINUED)

159.

SARAH

You just fucking die.

HALLENBECK

She's something, isn't she?

160.

JIMMY

The car's over on the other side.

C'mere, I want to show you

something.

JIMMY

Somebody broke in and swiped the

suitcase from the back seat. Had

to be Marcon, right?

JIMMY

Son of a bitch got the wrong one!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

161.

FUCK YOU

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

162.

BESSALO

You got a lot of questions to

answer.

HALLENBECK

I know.

BESSALO

You'll probably lose your license.

HALLENBECK

I know.

BESSALO

Do you care?

HALLENBECK

My wife loves me.

JIMMY

So.

HALLENBECK

Yeah.     So.

JIMMY

(clears his throat)

You gonna keep it?

HALLENBECK

Some of it.

(CONTINUED)

163.

JIMMY

How much?

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

My fee.

JIMMY

Shit, Joe... I got all the money

I need.

HALLENBECK

I'm thinkin' I could use a partner.

(beat)

Think you could handle that for

awhile?

JIMMY

I maybe could handle that.        For

awhile.

JIMMY

Alex the detective.

SO HURRY UP ALREADY

164.

HALLENBECK

See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks.

But you still can't be hangin'

around Satan Claus, you know why...?

JIMMY

Why?

HALLENBECK

'Cause someday, compadre... Satan

Claus and Santa Claus are gonna

have a big fight, and you know

what...?

(beat)

Santa's gonna kick some royal ass.

HALLENBECK

Hey.   Smile, you fuck.

FADE OUT.

THE END
