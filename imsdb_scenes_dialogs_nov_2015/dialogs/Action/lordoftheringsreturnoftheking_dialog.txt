SMEAGOL V/0 (cont'd)

And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so

alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,

the sound of trees, the softness of the

wind . . . We even forgot our own name.

(in a choking cough)

Gollum! Gollum!

GOLLUM

It's mine! My own. It came to me.

SMEAGOL

The days are growing darker.

GOLLUM

Come on, must go, no time ...

SAM

Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

GOLLUM

. . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM

Here.

FRODO

What about you?

Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led

us on, and now we find you feasting and

smoking.

We are sitting on a field of victory,

We're under orders from Treebeard, who's

taken over management of Isengard.

TREEBEARD

Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad

you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,

stone I can master, but there's a wizard to

be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

GANDALF

And there Saruman must remain, under your

guard, Treebeard.

GIMLI

Let's just have his head and be done with

it.                            .

GANDALF

(quietly)

No. He has no power any more.

tonight is for you.

MERRY & PIPPIN

(singing)

Oh, you can search - up and down

As many lands as can be found

But you'll never find a beer so brown

As the one we drink in our home town

You can keep your fancy ales

You can drink them by the flagon

But the only brew, for the brave and true,

Comes from the Green Dragon!

What is it saying,.my Precious, my love? Is .

Smeagol losing his nerve??

SMEAGOL                 :

No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty

Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them -

dead!

We must get the Precious. We must get it

GOLLUM

Patience, patience, my love. First we must

lead them to her.

SMEAGOL

We lead them to the windy stairs.

GOLLUM

(prompting)

Yes, the stairs ... and then?

SMEAGOL

Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until

we come to . . .

(naughty excitement)

... the Tunnel!

GOLLUM

(quiet)

And when they go in, there's no coming out.

She's always hungry, she always needs to

feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy

Orcses.

SMEAGOL

And they doesn't taste very nice, does

they, Precious?               .

GOLLUM

(sinister)

No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She

hungers for sweeter meats . . .

GOLLUM (cont'd)

"Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the

bones and the empty clothes, then we will

find it . . .

SMEAGOL

And take it for Me!

The Precious will be ours once the

Hobbitses are dead!

You treacherous little toad!

GOLLUM

No, Sam! Leave him alone!

I heard it from his own mouth        he means

to murder us!

SMEAGOL

Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!

He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol

Call me a liar! You're a liar!

I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I

won' t wait around for him to kill us !

FRODO

(fierce whisper)

I'm not sending him away.

You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not

without a guide. I need you on my side.

The city was burning ...

GANDALF

Minas Tirith???

(to PIPPIN)

Is that what you saw?

PIPPIN

(terrified)

I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his

voice in my head.

GANDALF

And what did you tell him? Speak!

PIPPIN

He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he

hurt me . . .

GANDALF

What did you tell him about Frodo and the

Ring?

GANDALF

There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,

but an honest fool he remains. He told

Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

(CONTINUED)

Final Revision - October, 2003 19.

GANDALF (cont'd)

We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin

saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our

enemy's plan.

GANDALF (cont'd)

Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas

Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed

our enemy one thing.

GANDALF (cont'd)

The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are

not as weak as he supposed. There is

courage still - strength enough left to

challenge him.

GANDALF (cont'd)

What do we owe Gondor?

ARAGORN

I will go.

No!

ARAGORN

They must be warned.

GANDALF

You must come to Minas Tirith by another

Follow the river, look to the black ships.

Why did you look - why do you always have

to look?

PIPPIN                                 .

I don't know . . . I can't help it.

MERRY

You never can.

PIPPIN

I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.

MERRY

Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks

you have the Ring . . . he's going to be

looking for you, Pip. They have to get you

out of here!

And you. You're coming with me . . .

GANDALF (cont'd)

Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He

GA ND ALF (c on t'd )

(quietly)

Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is

Boromir's father. To give him news of his

beloved son's death would be most unwise

... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the

Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.

(hesitates)

In fact, it's better if you don't speak at

all, Pippin Took.

GANDALF

Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and

Steward of Gondor.

I come with tidings in this dark hour - and

Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is

Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and

Pippin!

PIPPIN

I offer you my service, such as it is, in

payment of this debt.

GANDALF

(to PIPPIN)

Get up!

(a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)

My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for

Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming

... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As

Steward, you are charged with the defence

of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

(CONTINUED)

Final Revision - October, 2003 32.

GANDALF (cont'd)

You still have friends - you are not alone

in this fight. Send word to Theoden of

Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR

(softly)

You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for

all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do

you think the eyes of the White Tower are

blind? I have seen more than you know. With

your left hand you would use me as a shield

against Mordor and with your right you

would seek to supplant me.

DENETHOR (cont'd)

(contemptuous)

I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,

yes. Word has reached my ears of this

Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you

now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the

North - last of a ragged house, long bereft

of Lordship.

GANDALF

(stung)

Authority is not given to you to deny the

return of the King - Steward!

DENETHOR

(explosive)

The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

GANDALF

Come.

Final Revision - October, 2003 33.

PIPPIN

So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial

position . . . I mean, they don't actually

expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

GANDALF

You're in the service of the Steward now -

you're going to have to do as you're told,

Peregrin Took . . .

(under his breath)

Guard of the Citadel!

PIPPIN

It's so quiet.

GANDALF

It's the deep breath before the plunge.

PIPPIN

I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
