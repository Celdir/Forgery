****************

LEON

Okay if I talk?

LEON

I kinda get nervous when I

take tests.

HOLDEN

Don't move.

LEON

Sorry.

LEON

Already had I.Q. test this year --

but I don't think I never had a...

HOLDEN

(cutting in)

Reaction time is a factor in this,

so please pay attention.  Answer

quickly as you can.

HOLDEN

You're in a desert, walking along

in the sand when all of a sudden

you look down and see a...

LEON

What one?

HOLDEN

What?

LEON

What desert?

HOLDEN

Doesn't make any difference what

desert -- it's completely

hypothetical.

LEON

But how come I'd be there?

HOLDEN

Maybe you're fed up, maybe you

want to be by yourself -- who

knows.  So you look down and

see a tortoise.  It's crawling

towards you...

LEON

A tortoise.  What's that?

HOLDEN

Know what a turtle is?

LEON

Of course.

HOLDEN

Same thing.

LEON

I never seen a turtle.

LEON

But I understand what you mean.

HOLDEN

You reach down and flip the

tortoise over on its back, Leon.

LEON

You make these questions, Mr.

Holden, or they write 'em down

for you?

HOLDEN

The tortoise lays on its back,

its belly baking in the hot sun,

beating its legs trying to turn

itself over.  But it can't.  Not

without your help.  But you're

not helping.

LEON

Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

HOLDEN

I mean you're not helping!

Why is that, Leon?

DECKARD (V.O.)

It was 97 degrees in the city and

no hope of improvement.  Not bad

if you're a lizard.  But two hours

earlier I was drinking Acquavit

with an Eskimo lady in North East

Alaska.  That's a tough change to

make.  It was so good, I didn't

want to leave, so I left a day

early.

DECKARD

Contact.  This is Blade Runner One

calling Com-fast 27.

VOICE

Blade Runner One, stand by please.

VOICE

Deckard.

DECKARD

Yah, Gaff.

GAFF (VOICE)

Where the hell you been?

DECKARD

You know where I been.  I been on

vacation.

GAFF

Next time you go on vacation,

do me a favor, let us know where

it is.

DECKARD

What's up?

GAFF

Holden got hit.

DECKARD

Bad?

GAFF

Severed spine.  You'd better get

in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

DECKARD

I'll see you in a minute.

DECKARD (V.O.)

I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,

The Tyrell Corporation's new pride

and joy.  Holden was administering

the Voight-Kampff test when one

nailed him.

DECKARD (V.O.)

The Nexus-6 must be fast because

Holden was as quick as they come.

The report said there were six of

them.  Three males and three female.

Led by a combat model called Roy

Batty.

DECKARD (V.O.)

They escaped from the colonies

two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-

three people and jumped a shuttle.

An aerial patrol found the ship

in the desert.  No crew.

DECKARD (V.O.)

Bryant's got a liver problem.  A

couple years back he handed me a

bottle and said have a drink for

another man.  I been drinking

for him ever since.

DECKARD

Six, huh?

BRYANT

Five.  Three nights ago one of

them managed to break into the

Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two

guards and got as far as the

Genetic Sector before he got

fried going through an electro-

field.

DECKARD

What was he after?

BRYANT

There wasn't much left of him,

so we can't be sure.  But bio-

chemical data and morphology records

of the Nexus-6 were reported

missing.  Going on the possibility

they might try to infiltrate we

send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff

tests on the new employees.  Guess

he found himself one.

DECKARD

You got a machine on it yet?

BRYANT

We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that

picked up Holden's alarm.  Its

guess is that all five are in

the city.

DECKARD

Where do we start?

BRYANT

The Tyrell Corporation has a

demo model.  Check it out on the

Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance

the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability

to detect.  If that's the case,

everybody's up shit creek.

DECKARD

What was the cover on the one that

got Holden?

BRYANT

Industrial refuse.

DECKARD

Garbage man?

DECKARD

Did personnel have an address on

him?

DECKARD

I'll go take a look.

DECKARD

Thanks.

DECKARD (V.O.)

The big incentive to emigrate was

still free labor.  If the public

found out that their door-prizes

might kill them, they might not be

so hot to go up there.  This was

one of the worst one's we had and

Bryant was worried.  He wanted to

tell me to be discrete or something.

But I didn't give him a chance.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Choose from a variety of seventy

nine different personality types.

Each and every one a loyal trouble-

free companion given to you upon

your arrival absolutely free...

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

To use as personal body servant

to tireless field hand -- the

custom tailored humanoid robot,

designed especially for your

needs.

BATTY

Did you get your precious 'things'?

LEON

Somebody was already there.

BATTY

Police.

LEON

Just a man.

BATTY

Police man.

BATTY

Why don't you have a seat.

BATTY

Enjoy the view.

CHEW

Well, you're right.  This little

honey has a couple of defective cones.

CHEW

You're a regular perfectionist,

Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN

It's gotta be right for my

customer.

CHEW

Your customer, eh?

CHEW

You got a pocket-charger, boy?

CHEW

Is that good enough for your

customer?

CHEW

How much is he paying you?

CHEW

Well, when do you get paid?

SEBASTIAN

Soon as I finish the job.

CHEW

When might that be?

SEBASTIAN

Day after tomorrow.

CHEW

Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

CHEW

The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.

A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.

Pay the little guy last.  You should

charge twice as much.  It'll make

him feel better.

SEBASTIAN

Thanks, Mr. Chew.

SEBASTIAN

Hey!  You forgot your...

SEBASTIAN

How come you were in my truck?

PRIS

I was tired and didn't have any

place to go.

SEBASTIAN

You can get back in if you want...

SEBASTIAN

Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

SEBASTIAN

What's your name?

PRIS

Pris.

SEBASTIAN

Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

PRIS

Hi.

SEBASTIAN

Oh!  Where do you want to go?

SEBASTIAN

You want to go home?

PRIS

I don't have one.

SEBASTIAN

Oh.

SEBASTIAN

Where are your folks?

PRIS

They left.

SEBASTIAN

What about friends?

PRIS

I have some, but I have to find

out where they are staying.

SEBASTIAN

Well, where should I take you?

PRIS

We scared each other pretty good

didn't we?

SEBASTIAN

We sure did.

PRIS

I'm hungry, J.F.

SEBASTIAN

I've got stuff.  If you wanna go

to my place?

PRIS

I was hoping you'd say that.

DECKARD (V.O.)

Machines can be helpful sometimes,

but they can also be a pain in the

ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger

and you might wind up at a steel-

mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once

in a while -- it's their personalities

that usually get me.  Somebody once

said that man makes machines in his own

image.  If that's true, whoever made

Esper should have been shot.

ESPER

This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go

ahead please.

DECKARD

You equipped for random questions?

ESPER

Why, yes, of course.

DECKARD

You start.

ESPER

The five in question are third

generation Nexus Sixes, constructed

of skin-flesh culture, selected

enogenic transfer conversion

capable of self-perpetuating

thought, para-physical abilities

and developed for emigration

program.  Are you with me?

DECKARD

How do I stop one?

ESPER

Unlike a five, they can sustain

massive traumas to several parts

of the body without debilitating

another.  Sever a leg and it will

perform quicker on the remaining leg

than the fastest man can run,

DECKARD

Okay, but...

ESPER

I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable

zone is the base of the skull,

the occipital bone.  A direct hit

is a positive retirement.

VOICE

You are in violation of traffic

ordinance M-139 statutory freeway

limit restricted by one-hundred

and eighty kilometers.

SEBASTIAN

Oh!

PRIS

Whatcha doin'?

SEBASTIAN

You scared me.

SEBASTIAN

I'm working.

SEBASTIAN

You look... better.

PRIS

Just better.

SEBASTIAN

Beautiful.

PRIS

Thanks.

PRIS

And you live in this building all

by yourself?

SEBASTIAN

Yeah, I live here pretty much

alone right now...

SEBASTIAN

No housing shortage around here...

plenty of room for everybody.

PRIS

How old are you?

SEBASTIAN

Twenty.

PRIS

What's your problem?

SEBASTIAN

Methuselah Syndrome.

PRIS

What's that?

SEBASTIAN

My glands.  They grow old too fast.

PRIS

Is that why you're still here?

SEBASTIAN

Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

PRIS

I like you just the way you are.

SEBASTIAN

Ah, you get hold of your friends?

PRIS

As a matter of fact I did.  They've

got some work to do tonight, but

they're gonna come tomorrow.

SEBASTIAN

Good.

SEBASTIAN

I can sleep on the couch.

MOUSE

Don't let the bed bugs bite!

ESPER

Nexus designated Leon:  incept

date April 10th, 2015 -- to be

used in military experiments to

determine how hyper metabolism

functions in deep space.

Nexus designated Batty incept

data April 10th, 2015, combat

model, level of self-sufficiency,

optimum.

ESPER

Here's something you might find

interesting.  They have been built

to emulate the human in every way

except in its emotional spectrum.

However, after a period of time

it is only logical that such a

'mechanism' would create its own

emotional responses, hate, love,

fear, anger, envy.

DECKARD

I know all that.

ESPER

What about a summary then.

DECKARD

I think we're through for the night.

ESPER

Mr. Deckard.

DECKARD

Yes?

ESPER

Do you have something against

science?

DECKARD

Not if it works.

ESPER

And what in your estimation works?

DECKARD

The umbrella.

DECKARD (V.O.)

Every government that could was

racing to populate their colonial

territory.  But emigrants needed

incentive.  Over-population and

the greenhouse factor didn't seem

to be enough; but owning a human

look-a-like had lots of appeal.

It was big industry, the competition

was stiff and Tyrell was top of the

line.

DECKARD (V.O.)

His claim to fame was making a

product more human than human and

sometimes the 'more' turned out to

be a problem.  This wasn't just an

escaped andy who broke his owner's

arm -- there were twenty-eight

people dead and the pressure was

on.

DECKARD (V.O.)

But so far they'd always managed

to keep it quiet.  Not to say

that once in a while there wasn't

bad publicity.  Some fanatic

bitching about equal rights for

andies or an occasional trade union

proclaiming it was aun-American for

automatons to take jobs away from

humans on the colony.

DECKARD (V.O.)

But what's more American than good

old supply and demand?  The

Government needed them, industry

made them and the church backed

them.  The big religious boys

said that Androids, no matter how

human, were objects; only God

could make people. I'm not religious,

but I was inclined to agree.

Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

RACHAEL

Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is

Rachael.

RACHAEL

It seems your department doesn't

believe out new unit is to the

public benefit.

DECKARD

A humanoid robot is like any other

machine, it can be a benefit or a

hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's

not our problem.

RACHAEL

But because your department can't

do an adequate job in detecting

the miniscule number at large,

it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.

Deckard?

RACHAEL

You like our owl?

DECKARD

It's artificial?

RACHAEL

Of course not.

RACHAEL

You're in a very unique position,

Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the

future of this entire organization

according to how you work your

little test.

RACHAEL

Are you apprehensive?

DECKARD

Why should I be?

RACHAEL

For the responsibility of your

power.  Being a police bureaucrat,

you've got more than your share.

DECKARD

You got it wrong, girl.  I work

with the bureau not for them.

DECKARD

My job isn't to detect

malfunctioning andies, it's to

eliminate them.  The more the

better.

RACHAEL

Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

TYRELL

How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please

sit down.  Would you care for a cup

of coffee?

DECKARD

Thanks.

TYRELL

Black?

DECKARD

Please.

TYRELL

Somehow, I didn't expect that the

man who did the dirty work would

be the man to do the technical

work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

TYRELL

Is this to be an empathy test?

DECKARD

Yes.

TYRELL

Capillary dilation of the so-called

blush response?  Plus fluctuation

of the pupil, plus involuntary

dilation of the iris?

TYRELL

May I ask a personal question?

DECKARD

Go ahead.

TYRELL

Have you ever retired a human by

mistake?

DECKARD

No.

TYRELL

But in your profession that is a

risk.

DECKARD

Nothing is infallible, but so far

the Voight-Kampff scale bas been

foolproof.

TYRELL

Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a

machine can be a hazard.  The

Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,

isn't it?

DECKARD

One that relies on human

interpretation.  Where's the

subject?

TYRELL

Sitting next to you.

DECKARD'S VOICE

Ready.

RACHAEL

Go ahead.

DECKARD

You're given a calfskin wallet

for your birthday.

RACHAEL

I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd

report the person who gave it to

me to the police.

DECKARD

You have a little boy.  He shows

you his butterfly collection, plus

the killing jar.

RACHAEL

I'd take him to the doctor.

DECKARD

You're watching T.V. and suddenly

you notice a wasp crawling on your

wrist.

RACHAEL

I'd kill it.

DECKARD

In a magazine you come across a

full-page photo of a nude girl.

RACHAEL

Is this testing whether I'm an

android or a lesbian?

DECKARD

You show the picture to your husband.

He likes it and hangs it on the wall.

The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

RACHEL

I wouldn't let him.

DECKARD

Why not?

RACHAEL

I should be enough for him.

DECKARD

You become pregnant by a man who

runs off with your best friend,

and you decide to get an abortion.

RACHAEL

I'd never get an abortion.

DECKARD

Why not?

RACHAEL

That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

DECKARD

In your opinion.

RACHAEL

It would be my child.

DECKARD

Sounds like you speaks from

experience.

DECKARD

Last question.  You're watching

an old movie.  It shows a banquet in

progress, the guests are enjoying

raw oysters.

RACHAEL

Ugh.

DECKARD

The entree consists of boiled

dog stuffed with rice.

DECKARD

The raw oysters are less acceptable

to you than a dish of boiled dog.

DECKARD

Lights please.

TYRELL

Well?

DECKARD

If she is, the machine works.

TYRELL

The machine works.  She is.

TYRELL

How many questions did it take?

DECKARD

Thirteen.

DECKARD

She didn't know?

TYRELL

Memory implant.  She was programmed.

But I think she has transcended

her conditioning.  I think she was

beginning to suspect.

TYRELL

How many questions does it usually

take, Mr. Deckard?

DECKARD

Five, maybe six.

TYRELL

You're going to have to be on your

toes, my friend.

TYRELL

It's a complex problem and we

wouldn't want anything to happen

to you.

TYRELL

For the good of all, I recommend

you take Rachael with you.

Considering her uniqueness, I'm

sure she could prove quite helpful.

DECKARD

No thanks.

TYRELL

And how is it one man will be able

to cover so much ground?

DECKARD

Discreetly.

TYRELL

All pertinent information is

being fed into your departmental

computer, an Esper 231 -- I

believe -- and a photo over-lay

packet is being produced.

TYRELL

Mr. Deckard, I think it would be

wise to reconsider my offer.

DECKARD

I work alone.

VOICE

Let's keep our eyes on the road,

Deckard.

DECKARD'S VOICE

Sorry.

VOICE

Come on, stay with the machine.

VOICE

We're going to have to start the

sequence again if you don't stay

with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

DECKARD'S VOICE

How do you know I'm not?

VOICE

You're not responding to the

stimulus.  I can see right here,

I'm not getting a reading.

DECKARD'S VOICE

I'm tired of this.

VOICE

Almost through.

DECKARD

So how did I do?

WHEELER

Nerves of steel.

DECKARD

No rust?

WHEELER

I didn't say that.  Your motivity

rate checked out a little slower

than last time.

DECKARD

Meaning?

WHEELER

Meaning you don't run as fast as

you used to.

WHEELER

During the road test...

DECKARD

Yeah?

WHEELER

Your mind kept wandering.  That

bothered me.

DECKARD

Huh huh.

WHEELER

Considering the nature of your

work, that could be unhealthy.

DECKARD

True.

WHEELER

You got a birthday coming up.

WHEELER

But you haven't put in for

emigration.

DECKARD

Nope.

WHEELER

You're going to be over the limit.

DECKARD

Listen, I could make you a long

list of complaints about this

fucken city but I still rather be

here than up there.

WHEELER

What if you change your mind?

DECKARD

They'll change the limit before

I change my mind.

WHEELER

You sure?

DECKARD

Never been more sure of anything

in my life.

DECKARD

Why didn't you go?

WHEELER

Too old.

DECKARD

But if you could?

WHEELER

My job is here.

DECKARD

Me too.

BATTY

What's going on down there?

PRIS

He's not ready yet.

BATTY

When?

PRIS

Tomorrow, he says.

RACHAEL

Was that your dinner?

RACHAEL

I'm sorry.  I called and found out

you were on your way home.  These

were already delivered to your

department but I thought you

should have copies as soon as

possible.

RACHAEL

It's the Nexus information you

wanted.

DECKARD

Thanks.

DECKARD

Is there anything else?

RACHAEL

I know you think it complicates

your work, but I'm here to help.

DECKARD

I've already got more help than

I need.

RACHAEL

I think you need more help than

you've got.

RACHAEL

There's two reasons a man rejects

help.  Either because he's so good

at what he does he doesn't think

he needs it, or he's so insecure

he can't admit it.

DECKARD

Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either

way, but the answer is still no.

RACHAEL

Two of us might be more effective

than one.

DECKARD

I work alone.

RACHAEL

No you don't.

RACHAEL

You use your equipment, don't you?

DECKARD

So?

RACHAEL

So, I'm a piece of equipment.

Use me.

DECKARD

That's okay, I'll get it...

RACHAEL

Do I make you nervous?

DECKARD

Yeah.

RACHAEL

I'm sorry.

RACHAEL

It's strange to suddenly realize

that what you thought was your

life is actually someone else's

fabrication.

DECKARD

I can imagine.

RACHAEL

Can you?  I couldn't.

RACHAEL

A part of me is glad.  I think I

feel more.  I don't like who I was

before.

DECKARD

So why do you think they were

after their records.

RACHAEL

They probably want to find out

when they were made.

DECKARD

Right.

RACHAEL

I guess the date of your birth is

important if you know you're not

made to last.

RACHAEL

That's my number.  If you need me.

RACHAEL

You better get better locks --

if you want to keep me out.

RACHAEL

Good night.

DECKARD

Night.

DECKARD (V.O.)

The possibilities were infinite.

They could change their appearances

but not their future.

Like she said, it was short.

Longevity is what they were after.

The garbage man even wanted a past.

Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but

I knew she was right.  The market

worked on turn-over.  Built-in

obsolescence was the name of the

game.  That meant her too.  It

was something I didn't want to

think about.

DECKARD

Yeah.

BRYANT

Bryant here.  Regarding the

rundown you requested on job

applicants, Esper's concluded that

the only irregular category that

Tyrell's got is the entertainment

section.  You better get on it.

DECKARD

I was just about to have my dinner.

BRYANT

If you hurry you'll get back

before it gets cold.  I got a

spinner on your roof in five

minutes.  Good luck.

EPSER

Nexus designated Rachael is a

prototype.  Created for in-house

use by special mandate form the

Scientific Development Regulatory

Committee.  Will live conventional

term -- no para-physical abilities.

DECKARD

What is a conventional term?

ESPER

Four years.  Which would make her

termination date...

DECKARD

Never mind.  Do they have that

knowledge?

ESPER

Longevity is classified.  No.

DECKARD

Okay, gimme a run-down on the

three females.

ESPER

Nexus designated Mary:  incept

November 1 2017, domestic

conditioning non competitive,

trained for day care position.

DECKARD

Next.

ESPER

Nexus designated Pris:  incept

data December 13 2017, competitive,

programmed to provide pleasure

for long term spacers.

DECKARD

Number three.

ESPER

Nexus designated Zhora:  incept

June 13th 2017, athletic

conditioning, highly competitive,

special abilities in the

entertainment field.

DECKARD

Fuck.

DECKARD

Taffey Lewis?

TAFFEY

Yes?

DECKARD

Can I come in?

TAFFEY

Excuse my niece there... She's

studying for an exam.

DECKARD

I'd like  you to take a look at

these pictures.

TAFFEY

Of course.

TAFFEY

You see I lost my contacts a

couple of days ago around here

somewhere and my sight is a

little... What am I supposed

to be looking for?

DECKARD

Do you recognize any of

them?

TAFFEY

This one looks familiar, but

I don't know.  Naw.  There's

one came in today looks a

little like this one but...

DECKARD

What did she want?

TAFFEY

Who?

DECKARD

The girl that doesn't look

like that girl.

TAFFEY

Nothing.  She wanted to know

about suck night.

DECKARD

What night?

TAFFEY

I didn't know if I wanted to

handle her -- I already got

a snake act.  But my partner

goes down there to the Opera

House on suck night to book

the good ones.

DECKARD

What's suck night?

TAFFEY

That's what we call in the

trade, audition free-for-

alls and most of it sucks.

Bit I don't think that's

her.

DECKARD

You talking about the Opera

House on the Main?

DECKARD

Book the good ones for where?

TAFFEY

Lots of places.  The tours,

the clubs, the Silicone shows,

private parties.

DECKARD

What shows?

TAFFEY

Silicone Valley.  Lots of

these science guys never

leave that place.  We book

two shows a month in there.

Those big time techs and bio-

guys might be real high zoners

up here, but when it comes

to the arts, they like it loud

and lewd.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Let's hear it for the Hermano

Brothers.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Next we're gonna see a little

charmer who keeps her dancing

partner in a basket!  She

comes to us all the way from

exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

DECKARD

Excuse me, Miss Salome.

DECKARD

I'd like to have a word with you

if I could.

SALOME

Yeah?

DECKARD

I'm with the American Federation

of Variety Artists...

DECKARD

Don't worry, I'm not here to make

you join -- that's not my department.

DECKARD

I'm an investigator for the

Confidential Committee on Moral

Abuses.

DECKARD

There's been reports of management

sexually abusing the artists in

this place.

SALOME

I don't know nothing about it.

DECKARD

You haven't felt yourself to be

exploited by the management in any

way?

SALOME

How do you mean 'exploited'?

DECKARD

Like to get this position.  Did

you or were you asked to do anything

lewd or unsavory or otherwise

repulsive to your person?

SALOME

Are you for real?

DECKARD

Oh, yeah.

You'd be surprised what goes on

around here.  I'd like to check

the dressing room if I could.

SALOME

What the fuck for?

DECKARD

For holes.

SALOME

I don't believe this.

DECKARD

It that mother real?

SALOME

Of course he's not real.  You think

I'd be working here if I could

afford a real snake?

DECKARD

It's a good job.

SALOME

You mean the snake.

SALOME

The best.

DECKARD

Does it eat?

SALOME

Come on.

SALOME

Jeezus!

DECKARD

Sorry.

SALOME

Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck

mine, huh?

DECKARD

They have their ways of doing

their dirty work without the

victim knowing what's going on.

DECKARD

You'd be surprised what a guy'll

go through to get a glimpse of a

beautiful body.

SALOME

I bet I would.

DECKARD

Little dirty holes the bastards

drill in the wall so they can

watch a lady undress.

SALOME

And what if somebody did try to

'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

DECKARD

Me.

SALOME

And who do I go to about you?

DECKARD

Hmmmmm?

ZHORA

You ever get the feeling things

aren't the way they seem?

DECKARD

Stop or you're dead!

COP

Drop it!

SERGEANT

On your belly!

DECKARD

Listen, Sergeant...

COP

Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

SERGEANT

Clear this fuckin' crowd.

BRYANT

Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't

change procedure.  A little known

fact can become a well-known fact

and part of our job, Deckard, is

to make sure that doesn't happen.

Now how can be do that if you blow

one away in front of a fuckin'

audience.

BRYANT

Well?

DECKARD

She was gonna get away.

BRYANT

Then let her get away.  I thought

you were a pro -- you're supposed

to be a fuckin' tracker!

BRYANT

I'd say you got a little carried

away.

DECKARD

I didn't like her.

BRYANT

You didn't like her!?

BRYANT

You start liking or disliking

andies it's time to hang it up.

BRYANT

Look, go home.  Get some rest.

Take an aspirin.

DECKARD

Yeah.

BARTENDER

I can't protect your drinks,

mister; while you was in the

potty, this hummer snatched it.

DECKARD

No problem.  Gimme another.

RUSSIAN

Forgive me.  I thought was free

drink.  I will pay.

DECKARD

Forget it.

LEON

I think I have no money.

DECKARD

It's okay.  Forget it.

LEON

But I would like to buy you drink.

DECKARD

I'll but you one.  What'll you

have?

LEON

Vodka!

DECKARD

Shot of vodka, please.

LEON

Thank you very much.

DECKARD

My pleasure.

LEON

Prosit.

DECKARD

Prosit.

LEON

You want to see my friends?

DECKARD

Sorry, don't have the time.

LEON

No problem.

DECKARD

Those cockroaches?

LEON

Ya.

DECKARD

How long you had these guys?

LEON

Two months.  But this one is not

guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

LEON

Usually Blackie waits until Igor

is eating; then, when his back is

turned, he tries to take advantage

of Anna.

LEON

Prosit.

DECKARD

Prosit.

LEON

You never saw a cockroach make

love?

LEON

We will try.

LEON

It must be that he is not hungry

or maybe she is not hot.

LEON

You like to kiss her goodbye.

DECKARD

No thanks.

BARTENDER

Make sure you take your girlfriends

with you when you leave.

LEON

I like you.

DECKARD

I like you too.

LEON

One more, eh?

DECKARD

I gotta piss.

DECKARD

I think I'll piss outside.

LEON

How come you know where Zhora was

so quick?

DECKARD

I showed pictures.  Somebody

recognized her.  I went to see.

LEON

How old am I?

DECKARD

I don't know.

LEON

My birthday is April 10, 2015.

How long do I live?

DECKARD

Four years.

LEON

More than you.

LEON

Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

LEON

But that's how it is to be a

slave.  The future is sealed off,

he grovels, he waits.

LEON

Sex, reproduction, security, the

simple things.  But no way to

satisfy them.  To be homesick

with no place to go.  Potential

with no way to use it.  Lots of

little oversights in the Nexus 6.

LEON

I tell you, nothing is worse

than having an itch you can never

scratch.

DECKARD

Like I said, I don't need your

help.

RACHAEL

You look terrible, you know that?

DECKARD (V.O.)

I knew a cop once who was involved

in a high-speed chase.  They shot

out one of his tires and he went

over a cliff at hundred and fifty

miles an hour.  They found him in

the morning with a broken skull,

six fractured ribs and second-

degree burns.  On the way to the

hospital he made a play for the

nurse.

DECKARD

Hey!  I thought you were supposed

to be taking care of me.

RACHAEL'S VOICE

What do you need?

DECKARD

Don't just stand there looking at

me.  It's not polite.

RACHAEL

What do you want me to do?

DECKARD

Sit.

DECKARD

Gimme your arm.

DECKARD

You ever take a bath with a man

before?

RACHAEL

There's a lot I haven't done with

a man before.

RACHAEL

You're getting me wet.

RACHAEL'S VOICE

Sorry, I am not in at the moment,

but if you'll leave your name and

number I'll return your call as

soon as I can.

DECKARD

Fuck you, then.

SEBASTIAN

Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

SEBASTIAN

Now, now, Waddles.

SEBASTIAN

Hello, Wrigley.

SEBASTIAN

Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very

good care of you people.

BATTY

Whoops.

PRIS

This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

BATTY

Hello, glad to meet you.

PRIS

And my Aunt Mary.

PRIS

And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,

everybody.

BATTY

Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.

If you hadn't come along...

MARY

We were worried to death.  It's

awfully kind of you.

BATTY

We're not used to the big city.

Where we come from it's not so

easy to get lost.

MARY

You certainly have a nice place

here.

BATTY

Well stocked.

PRIS

Sebastian doesn't like to go out

too much.

SEBASTIAN

I keep a lot of provisions right

here.

BATTY

I like a man who stays put.  An

admirable thing to be able to

sustain yourself in these times.

You live here all by yourself, do

you?

SEBASTIAN

Well, no, not really.  There's

Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,

he lives on the first floor.

MARY

We haven't found it easy, Mr.

Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN

How about breakfast, I was just

going to make some.

BATTY

If it wouldn't be too much of a

bother... a little bite to eat

would be...

SEBASTIAN

Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

BATTY

Well, actually

MARY

We're famished.

SEBASTIAN

Okay, then.  You make yourselves

comfortable and I'll bring the

food right out.

BATTY

Charming.

PRIS

Well?

PRIS

I want to know what's going on.

BATTY

There's only three of us left.

PRIS

Then we're stupid and we'll die.

BATTY

Not if everybody is doing their

job here at home.  How are things

at home?

PIG

Home again, jiggidy jig.

PRIS

I don't trust him.  I don't think

he knows what he's doing.

BATTY

He knows what he's doing.

MARY

If he won't cooperate?

BATTY

Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants

to be appreciated.  We'll

appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

DECKARD

How are you doing, old man?

HOLDEN

I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm

not really great, but I feel just

great.  How you like my new suit?

DECKARD

Well, you don't have to worry

about getting it wrinkled.

HOLDEN

Don't make me laugh.  It makes me

pee.

DECKARD

Sorry.

HOLDEN

Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.

So how are you doing?

DECKARD

I'm doing okay.

HOLDEN

From what I hear you're doing

great.  Bryant tells me you're

going like a god damn one-man

army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

DECKARD

Yeah.

(pause)

But that's what I wanted to talk

to you about.

HOLDEN

Money?

DECKARD

No.  I got a problem.

HOLDEN

Let's hear it.

DECKARD

I think I'm starting to empathize

with these Nexus-sixes.

DECKARD

What's that?

HOLDEN

I'm taking a piss.

HOLDEN

Let me ask you something, Deck.

You been having intimate relations

with one of these units?

HOLDEN

That's what I thought... one of

the liabilities of the trade --

you has sex with your prey, old

buddy.  That's bound to create

problems, unless you're a black

widow.

DECKARD

What about -- not sex -- but love?

HOLDEN

Love is just another name for sex.

Love is sexy and sex is lovely --

I don't care what you call it, an

android can't have it.

DECKARD

These aren't just...

HOLDEN

I know what they are, Deck --

Look, maybe they can pretend to

feel, but far as the raw, hot

emotions of the old heart -- no

way.

HOLDEN

Believe me, take it from an old

pro, no matter how good we get,

we're never gonna make an

artificial anything that can

feel.  It's a contradiction.

You might as well go fuck your

washing machine.

HOLDEN

Just go out there and keep up

the good work.

HOLDEN

Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting

sleepy.  It's been good talking

to you.

DECKARD

Thanks.

RACHAEL

I told you I'd come back.

DECKARD

You did?

RACHAEL

You didn't hear me.  You were

sleeping.

RACHAEL

Are you glad I'm here?

RACHAEL

Who is this?

DECKARD

Me and my dad.

RACHAEL

Where is he?

DECKARD

Dead.

RACHAEL

Oh.

RACHAEL

How come you're not on the job?

DECKARD

I am.  Part of my job is to sit

on a couch and try and figure

things out.

RACHAEL

How are you doing?

DECKARD

Not too good.

RACHAEL

What do people do in the afternoon?

DECKARD

If they are smart, they take

naps.

RACHAEL

Do you dream?

DECKARD

Yeah.  Sometimes.

RACHAEL

I wish I could.

DECKARD

Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

RACHAEL

I mean asleep.

RACHAEL

Did you cry when your father

died?

DECKARD

Yeah.

RACHAEL

That's another thing I can't

do.

RACHAEL

Nobody is freer than when he

dreams.  I read that.

DECKARD

It wasn't very good last night,

was it?

RACHAEL

I don't know, I have nothing

to compare it to.  I guess I

thought there was something

more to it.

DECKARD

What?

RACHAEL

I don't know... I think I missed

something.

DECKARD

Like?

RACHAEL

I'm not sure.  Is there a

secret?

DECKARD

I don't know.  If there is I'd

like to find it.

BATTY

Why are you staring at us?

SEBASTIAN

You're just all so... so different.

BATTY

What, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN

You're androids.

PRIS

What makes you think so?

SEBASTIAN

You're all so perfect.

SEBASTIAN

What generation are you?

BATTY

Nexus - 6.

BATTY

We can trust Sebastian, ladies.

He's been working with mechanisms

all his life.  He's a wizard and

a very perceptive man.

SEBASTIAN

Could you...

SEBASTIAN

Show me something?

BATTY

Like what?

SEBASTIAN

Like...

BATTY

We're not computers, Sebastian,

we're physical.

PRIS

I think, therefore I am.

BATTY

Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

BATTY

We have a lot in common.

SEBASTIAN

You mean that you can't come here

and I can't go there?

BATTY

Not only that, but we have smiliar

problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.

But we don't want to die quite yet.

SEBASTIAN

Of course not.

BATTY

You could help us.

SEBASTIAN

I don't know much about biomechanics,

Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out

of my league.

BATTY

If we don't find help soon, Pris

hasn't got long to live.

BATTY

What about your friend, the man

who owns this building?

SEBASTIAN

Dr. Tyrell?

SEBASTIAN

He's not really my friend.  I just

do a job for him now and then.

BATTY

Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN

He could?

BATTY

His company made us.

SEBASTIAN

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

BATTY

Be better if I could talk to him

in person.  But he's not an easy

man to get to.

SEBASTIAN

No.

BATTY

When do you deliver your project?

SEBASTIAN

This afternoon.

BATTY

Will you help us?

SEBASTIAN

Yes.

BATTY

I'm sure glad you found us,

Sebastian.  What do you think,

Mary?

MARY

I don't think there is another

human being in this whole world

who would have helped us.

BATTY

Pris?

BATTY

You're our best and only friend.

SEBASTIAN

Thank you.

RACHAEL

When was the last time you cleaned

this place?

DECKARD

Hmmm?

RACHAEL

Have you ever cleaned your

apartment?

DECKARD

Don't be fooled by appearances.

RACHAEL

It appears to be dirty -- why don't

you get somebody?

DECKARD

Because they would ruin the

arrangement.

RACHAEL

They could clean around the

arrangement.

DECKARD

I don't like people snooping around

my stuff.

DECKARD'S VOICE

There's a vacuum in the front room

closet is you wanna give it a try.

DECKARD

Oh no, don't do that.

RACHAEL

But if I don't plug it in how can

I...

DECKARD

Never mind the plug, just go

through the motions.

RACHAEL

But then how can you...

DECKARD

I don't like the noise.  Just

practice.  Practice makes perfect.

DECKARD

I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me

how you would do it.

DECKARD

How about under the couch there.

Come on.

RACHAEL

This feels stupid.

DECKARD

Good for a smart girl to feel

stupid.  Part of your education.

RACHAEL

You're sick, Deckard.

DECKARD

I never felt better.

STYLES

Okay, I'll take that now.

SEBASTIAN

Wait!

SEBASTIAN

Can't fly without the pilot.

IAN

Oh!

IAN

Papa!  Did you make this?

TYRELL

No.  We can make man, but not a

griffon.

TYRELL

Have to give the cottage industry

a chance too.

TYRELL

A friend of yours, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN

Yes, this is someone who wants to

talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

BATTY

The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

TYRELL

Oh?

BATTY

To act without understanding could

lead to the very thing the act

seeks to avoid.

BATTY

A little talk it all I need.

TYRELL

Would you like to talk in private

then.

BATTY

Yeah.  It might be better if we

talk in private, Sebastian.  Why

don't you go home.

TYRELL

Here's your check, my boy.  Thank

you.

SEBASTIAN

Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see

you later.

SEBASTIAN

Was everything okay?

TYRELL

Just beautiful.

TYRELL

I'm surprised you didn't come to

me sooner.

BATTY

It's not an easy thing to meet

your maker.

TYRELL

And what can he do for you?

BATTY

Can the maker repair what he makes?

TYRELL

Would you like to be modified?

BATTY

Had in mind something a little more

radical.

TYRELL

What's the problem?

BATTY

Death.

TYRELL

I'm afraid that's a little out of

my...

BATTY

I want more life, fucker.

TYRELL

Come here.

TYRELL

Sit down.

TYRELL

The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.

To make an alteration in the

evolvement of an organic life

system, at least by men, makers

or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence

can't be revised once it's

established.

BATTY

Why?

TYRELL

Because by the second day of

incubation any cells that have

undergone reversion mutation give

rise to revertant colonies -- like

rats leaving a sinking ship.  The

ship sinks.

BATTY

What about E.M.S. recombination?

TYRELL

We've already tried it -- ethyl

methane sulfonate is an alkylating

agent and a potent mutagen -- it

creates a virus so lethal the

subject was destroyed before we

left the table.

BATTY

Then a repressor protein that blocks

the operating cells.

TYRELL

Wouldn't obstruct replication, but

it does give rise to an error in

replication, so that the newly

formed DNA strand carries a

mutation and you're got a virus

again... but all this is academic

-- you are made as good as we could

make you.

BATTY

But not to last.

TYRELL

Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are

made to last -- as least they were.

But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.

A high strung racing car -- built

to win, not to last.

TYRELL

Also you're too valuable to

experiment with.

BATTY

I am?

TYRELL

The bast of all possible androids.

We're proud of our prodigal son --

glad you're returned.  You're quite

a prize.

BATTY

I've done some questionable things.

TYRELL

Also extraordinary things.

BATTY

Nothing the God of biomechanics

wouldn't let you in heaven for.

BATTY

Could you tell me where the

bathroom is?

MRS. TYRELL

May I help you?

DECKARD (V.O.)

She'd never seen the great outdoors.

Never even seen books on the

subject.  She went through

everything I had, and we talked.

And there were subjects we didn't

discuss and they were words we

didn't say, I couldn't say, like

death, like future, like real.  But

it was hard because she was curious

and full of questions.  She was

more alive than anyone I'd ever

known.

RACHAEL

You and I are good friends, huh?

RACHAEL

It's so easy.

RACHAEL

Have you ever known anybody a long

time?

DECKARD

You mean a woman?

RACHAEL

Uh-huh.

DECKARD

What's a long time?

RACHAEL

Ten years.

DECKARD

Nope.  Nobody could stand me that

long.

DECKARD

Yeah.

BRYANT

This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

DECKARD

Yeah.

BRYANT

She's not with you?

DECKARD

Who.

BRYANT

Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth

floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia

South.

DECKARD

Got it.

BRYANT

Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his

family and half his staff were just

massacred.  The cat is about to get

out of the bag.  Pressure is

definitely on.  The Nexus program

is terminated.  When you finish

there, locate Nexus designated Rachael

and retire.

BRYANT

If you don't, we will.  It has to

be total, Deckard.  That's an order

from as high as it comes.  Got it?

DECKARD

Yeah.  I got it.

BRYANT

Go.

RACHAEL

Why do you call it retire, why

don't you call it murder?

DECKARD

Because it's not.

RACHAEL

Don't you think anything that can

suffer deserves to be considered?

DECKARD

Andies only simulate suffering --

if they're programmed for it.

RACHAEL

Do you think I simulated what

happened between us?

DECKARD

No, I don't.

DECKARD

Don't leave here.  Don't open the

door, don't answer the phone.

RACHAEL

What difference will it make?

DECKARD

Just wait here.

RACHAEL

You know what I think?

DECKARD

What?

RACHAEL

That some of the folks around here

are more programmed then me.

RACHAEL

You know what else I think?

DECAKRD

What?

RACHAEL

This was the best day of my life.

MARY

Let's go while there is still

time.

BATTY

Where?

MARY

Anywhere.

BATTY

What's the point?

MARY

Not to be trapped.

BATTY

You underestimate the trap, Mary.

BATTY

Where are you going, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN

Just thought I'd...

BATTY

No, you stay here with us.  Out

last night together.

BATTY

Think of yourself as a light, Mary.

Shine before you're turned off.

SEBASTIAN

Someone is coming here.

BATTY

One man.

(he smiles)

He must be good.

MARY

Then go get him.

BATTY

That wouldn't be very sporting.

PRIS

I want to do it.

BATTY

Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a

little for everybody.  A

masterpiece.

BATTY

Turn out the lights, Pris.

PRIS

Naughty, naughty.

DECKARD

Hello, Roy.

BATTY

You wanna play?

BATTY

Not very sporting to fire on an

unarmed opponent.  I thought you

were supposed to be good.  Aren't

you the man?!

BATTY

This is how we do it up there, lad!

Come on!

BATTY

Not hurt, are you?  You better get

it up or I'm going to have to kill

you.  Unless you're alive you can't

play.  And if you don't play, you

don't get to be alive.

BATTY

That's the spirit.

BATTY'S VOICE

Come on, Deckard, show me what you

got!  I'm right here on the other

side of the door.  But you gotta

shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

BATTY

Straight doesn't seem to be good

enough.

BATTY

You don't have a chance, do you?

BATTY

Looks like I'm gonna have to scale

it down for you.  Give you a

handicap.  I won't run through any

more walls.  Okay?  I promise to

use the doors.  Okay?

BATTY

Come on, let's use that brain!

BATTY

Think!  We need a little

resilience around here!

BATTY

Where are those balls of yours?!

Let's see a little bravery!

BATTY

That was irrational of me -- not

to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't

happen again.

BATTY

I'll be down the hall when you're

ready.

BATTY

Where you going?

BATTY

No cheating.  A promise is a

promise.  I'll honor the

handicapped, but we gotta play on

the top floor.  You go get your

laser gun now.  And I'll give you

a few seconds before I come.

BATTY'S VOICE

One!

BATTY'S VOICE

Two!

BATTY'S VOICE

No fair jumping through holes.  You

might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

BATTY

Five!

BATTY

Six!

BATTY'S VOICE

Seven!

BATTY

Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in

here, I don't think.  Eight!

BATTY

Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like

it.  Nine!

BATTY

Ten!

BATTY

One point for you.

BATTY

Ho ho!  Try it again!

BATTY

What's wrong?  Don't you like me?

I'm what we've made!

BATTY

What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover

of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

BATTY

It's time to die.

BATTY

Ah!

BATTY

That's for you.

BATTY

Stick it in your ear and push.

If that doesn't work, try the

eye.

BATTY

Believe me, it'll be better

for you than what I'm about

to do.

BATTY

Well?

BATTY

Crap.

DECKARD (V.O.)

She wanted to go to a place I knew.

Out of the city.  Like one of those

pictures she saw.  Where there were

trees but no buildings.

DECKARD (V.O.)

We had a good time.  She told me a

funny story and I taught her a

song.  A song about monkeys and

elephants.  And it made us laugh so

hard we couldn't sing.

DECKARD (V.O.)

I told myself over and over again,

if I hadn't done it, they would

have.

I didn't go back to the city, not

that city, I didn't want the job.

She said the great advantage of

being alive was to have a choice.

And she chose.  And a part of me

was almost glad.  Not because she

was gone but because this way they

could never touch her.

As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,

but he wasn't dead.  For a long

time I wanted to kill him.  But

what was the point?  There were too

many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.

Maybe real and unreal could never

be separated.  The secret never

found.  But I got as close with

her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd

stay with me a long time.  I guess

we made each other real.

THE END
