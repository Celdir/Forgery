FIRST BLOOD II: THE MISSION

James Cameron

December 22, 1983

D-MINUS 117 HRS

FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL

LEWIS

Shit.  Maintenance never gets down

here.

SINGLETERRY

So what am I supposed to do?  Can't

transfer him to Leavenworth.  He's

civilian.  So I put him in an

isolation cell that hasn't been used

since the Spanish Inquisition.

TRAUTMAN

Maybe you should have tried cutting

him some slack.

TRAUTMAN

(continuing)

What's that?

SINGLETERRY

Tranquilizer syrette gun.  Borrowed

it from the Animal Control

Department.

TRAUTMAN

Gimme a break.

(nods toward door)

Open it.

LEWIS

(muttering)

Thinks he's the fucking Prince of

Darkness.

TRAUTMAN

At ease, Rambo.

TRAUTMAN

(continuing to MPs)

Wait outside.

TRAUTMAN

Hello, John.

RAMBO

Colonel.

TRAUTMAN

Mind if I sit down?

TRAUTMAN

(continuing)

I hear you're not enjoying it here.

RAMBO

I could take it or leave it.

TRAUTMAN

Seems like I'm always pulling you

out of some goddamn toilet or other,

doesn't it?

RAMBO

Am I out of here?

TRAUTMAN

That depends on you.

(pause)

Christ, look at you.  I give you

this easy duty until I can get you

an assignment... all you have to do

is eat ice cream and watch soap

operas... and you have to make it

Rambo's last stand.

RAMBO

There were treating me like a

headcase.

TRAUTMAN

Hard to believe.  You shoot up one

little town in Oregon with a fifty

caliber machine gun... one little

dogpatch town... and everybody

figures your wrapper's broken.  No

sense of humor.

(pause)

What did you expect?  An engraved

plague from the chamber of commerce?

RAMBO

In 'Nam I flew gunships.  Million

dollar equipment.  Back here nobody

trusts me to park cars.  I keep

thinking it's going to be okay...

but I've been out six years and it's

not okay.  Sometimes I feel like I'm

coming right out of my skin.

TRAUTMAN

This your stuff?

RAMBO

That's it.  My life.

TRAUTMAN

Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever

trained.

RAMBO

(coldly)

Those men are all dead.

TRAUTMAN

(glancing up)

You're not.

TRAUTMAN

(continuing)

Congressional Medal of Honor.

RAMBO

(bitterly)

Yeah.  Big time.

TRAUTMAN

Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars,

four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's

Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of

Gallantry and... uh, a handful of

Purple Hearts.

RAMBO

Five.  I never wanted that stuff.

TRAUTMAN

What did you want?

RAMBO

(haltingly)

I just wanted... I don't know...

after all that... I just wanted one

person, one person, to come up to me

and say "you did good, John." And

mean it.  That's all.

(pause)

After all that.

TRAUTMAN

You just picked that wrong war to be

a hero in.

TRAUTMAN

(continuing)

Let's take a walk.

CUT TO:

TRAUTMAN

Jason Kirkhill... John Rambo.

KIRKHILL

Good to meet you, Rambo.  How are

you?

RAMBO

(coldly)

You a spook?

KIRKHILL

That's right.  CIA Special

Operations Division.

RAMBO

I don't work with spooks.  Not after

that op in Cambodia.

KIRKHILL

I'm authorized to get you out of

here.  I thought that's what you

wanted.

RAMBO

(considering)

What's the job?

KIRKHILL

Classic special forces op... hit

fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two

days.

RAMBO

Why me?

KIRKHILL

(shrugs non-

committally)

We like you.

(pause)

At least the computer at Langley

likes you.  Pulled your file because

of various factors.  Service record.

Area familiarity.

RAMBO

Where?

KIRKHILL

Not yet.

RAMBO

I'm not jumping blind.

KIRKHILL

It's yes or no.  In or out... now.

If it's "out," we will not have had

this conversation.  If you come in,

you will not be working for us.  No

knowledge.  No comment.  Do you

understand?

TRAUTMAN

(to Kirkhill)

Tell him.  I'll take responsibility.

KIRKHILL

North Vietnam.  What they call the

Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.

TRAUTMAN

We left some people behind there,

John... POWs.

RAMBO

This just occurred to somebody, now?

KIRKHILL

We don't leave our men, Rambo.

RAMBO

You got it.  I'm in.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

D-MINUS 84 HRS

FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA

SERGEANT (O.S.)

Three-fo-your-lef, lef-right-lef...

Other lef shithead!  Square those

pieces away... square 'em away

girls!  I said...

AIRBORNE SPECIAL FORCES GROUP

OPERATIONS CENTER

KIRKHILL

This is your mission packet...

AIDE

(quietly overlapping)

Sign here, please.  And here.

KIRKHILL

Memorize it here.  It doesn't leave

this room.

KIRKHILL

(continuing)

The twenty-four hundred American

servicemen missing in action in

Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are

officially listed "Presumed

Killed." Certainly most of them

are.

KIRKHILL

(continuing)

But reports keep filtering in.

Sightings by refugees.  Nothing

verified.  Finally, we feel we've

got enough to proceed on.

KIRKHILL

(continuing)

Memo E-7 on top will cover the

details.  An abandoned Vietnamese

Army base in the North-central

highlands may have a compound used

as an internment camp.  As you can

see the intelligence is soft.  These

LANDSAT photos show huts...

barracks.  It could be anything.

RAMBO

(flat)

What's the plan?

KIRKHILL

This operation is in two phases.

Recon and rescue.  You are phase

one.  Your two-man team will probe

the site, confirm the presence of

American POWs, if any, make

photographic and tactical

observations, then proceed to the

extraction point without engaging

the enemy.

RAMBO

We don't try to pull out any of our

guys if we find them?

KIRKHILL

Negative.  Absolutely not.  The

phase two assault team will get them

out.

RAMBO

(not pleased)

We just take pictures?

KIRKHILL

Don't look so disappointed.  It

should be hairy enough... even for

you.

CUT TO:

KIRKHILL (V.O.)

Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30.

Commercial carrier.  Low profile.

Rendezvous with Colonel Trautman at

the Indra.  Room 618.  You'll meet

your number two man, Lieutenant

Brewer.  He doesn't get a packet...

you brief him verbally.

D-MINUS 51 HRS

BANGKOK, THAILAND

MAN

Sorry old buddy, I saw it first.

MAN

(affable)

I kinda got an important date.

MAN

No problem.  We'll share it.  Get

your tail in there, sweet thing.

MAN

(to driver)

Indra Hotel.  And don't take the

scenic route, Smiley... I know my

way around this burg.  Comprende?

RAMBO

(Thai/subtitled)

Same place for me.

MAN

Ah, you fair flower of the Orient.

MAN

(continuing to Rambo)

She thinks everything I say is

funny.  Don't you, Angel-pie?  Man,

Thai women are the best.  Got the

kinda legs I like... feet at one end

and pussy at the other.

MAN

(continuing)

You don't say a helluva lot, do you,

pal?  You speak English?

RAMBO

(coldly)

Sometimes.

THAI GIRL

You got money?  I stay you whole

week.

MAN

Sweet thing, there's nothin' I'd

like more than to wugga-wugga with

you for a week, but tonight's all we

got.

MAN

(continuing)

See, I'm on this secret mission, and

tomorrow mornin' I head out to...

RAMBO

That's enough, Brewer.

BREWER

(realizing)

You're Rambo?

(pause)

Ke-rist!

RAMBO

(Thai/subtitled)

Get out.  Now!

BREWER

(brightening)

Jeez, I never would have guessed.

You undercover, Lieutenant?  Great

disguise.

CUT TO:

BREWER

(to Trautman)

He says he's team leader on this

show.

TRAUTMAN

That's correct.

BREWER

(controlling his

fury)

Begging the Colonel's pardon but I

understood I was up to lead my next

mission.

TRAUTMAN

Not this one.  You're on

communications and camera.  Same

image-intensified gear you used in

El Salvador last year.

RAMBO

This clown almost blew mission

security on the street.  I'm not

jumping with him.

BREWER

(spinning)

Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

TRAUTMAN

(sharply)

Listen up.  You two are married as

of now.  Get used to it.

RAMBO

(to Trautman)

I say we tape him to a chair.

CUT TO:

D-MINUS 36 HRS

BAN BUNG KHLA, THAILAND

KIRKHILL

I didn't know you were a stick man,

Rambo.

RAMBO

I was crossed-trained in gunships.

TRAUTMAN

(to Kirkhill)

How long have you been setting up?

KIRKHILL

About 22 hours on site.

TRAUTMAN

Nice work.

KIRKHILL

This is a covert operation,

numbnuts.

KIRKHILL

(to Trautman

entourage)

Check out the command hut.

BREWER

Mission control!

RAMBO

All this is for us?

KIRKHILL

That's right.

BREWER

(to Rambo)

They call us the field-unit meat-

puppets.

CUT TO:

BREWER

Ever do this from a jet?

RAMBO

No.

VOICE (O.S.)

It's easy...

MAN

(grinning)

Just have to jump fast.

RAMBO

You the pilot?

MAN

(extending hand)

Yeah.  Doyle.

(he gestures to the

two in the door)

Lifer and Fuhrman.

RAMBO

You boys Air Force?

DOYLE

Marines.  'Ex' though.  We're

private contractors now.

LIFER

You ever do a tour 'in-country'?

RAMBO

Two.  'Eye-corps' mostly.

DOYLE

(to Brewer)

How about you?

BREWER

(defensive)

Vietnam was a little before my time.

So was Korea, know what I mean?

DOYLE (O.S.)

Thailand.  The Mekong.  Laos.  'Nam.

DOYLE

A straight dash across the Laotian

panhandle, through the Annamese

Mountains... some good dicey bits

there... and on to the drop zone.

Eighteen minutes each way in

communist airspace.

RAMBO

We go low to stay off radar?

DOYLE

In the rhubarb, babe.

FUHRMAN

(grinning)

Mowin' the lawn.

LIFER

Dig it.

TRAUTMAN

How long before you're fully on

line?

KIRKHILL

Couple hours.  Let me buy you a

coffee.

TRAUTMAN

You think they'll find any?

KIRKHILL

(feeding in change)

POWs?  I don't know.  But either

way it'll get that subcommittee off

our necks.  Cream?

TRAUTMAN

Black.  No sugar.

KIRKHILL

The League of Families leans on

Congress.  Then they lean on us.

Like we don't have enough to worry

about in a dozen dirtwater

countries.  Damnit!

DOYLE

A couple klicks from insertion we go

vertical to ten thousand and you

punch out.  Navigate in free fall

like a regular HALO jump.  You'll

have a good moon.

LIFER

(to himself)

I got your moon right here...

BREWER

No problem.  Duck soup.

DOYLE

Hey, man... we got fuel on the deck.

I don't like flying without a plane.

RAMBO

No smoking on this mission.  It's

not healthy.

BREWER

Son of a bitch!

DOYLE

(appreciatively)

Nice trick.  Works nine times out of

ten.

RAMBO

Again.

BREWER

Insertion.  Call in to base camp by

TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango

November for rendezvous with our

ground contact.  Indigenous agent.

Co Phuong Bao.

(in same tone)

We've been over this three times.

RAMBO

You stopped.

BREWER

Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us

twelve klicks upriver to target at

Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!

RAMBO

(flatly)

Start over.

BREWER

(mechanically)

... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We

probe the site...

RAMBO

(to himself

overlapping)

Ninety.

BREWER

... then proceed downriver to

extraction at point Echo Delta.

Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we

all live happily ever after and

that's the last time, Rambo!  I

swear to Christ.

RAMBO

One hundred.

BREWER

Gettin' old, huh?

RAMBO

Yeah.

(pause)

Second set.  Let's go.

D-MINUS 11 HRS

BREWER

Transponder-satellite relay.

TRANSAT.

BREWER

(continuing)

The signal's coded into infrared

pulses, picked up by the spy

satellite, bounced to the ground

station in Okinawa and relayed to

the hut...

BREWER

(continuing)

No radio source.  Nothing for the

bad guys to triangulate on.

RAMBO

Show me how it operates.

BREWER

That's what I'm here for.

RAMBO

Show me in case you get zapped as

soon as we land.

BREWER

(frustrated)

We're leaving tonight, not in a

week.

BREWER

Alright.  Alright.

RAMBO (O.S.)

You jumping with all that?

BREWER

Yeah.  Why not?

RAMBO

You break your leg, I'll have to

shoot you.

DOYLE

I think he means it.

BREWER

Crazy fucker.

DOYLE

Well, son.  You got that right.

Anybody ever tell you about that

guy?

BREWER

What about him?

CUT TO:

D-MINUS 28 MINUTES

DOYLE (V.O.)

(filtered)

Ready to roll, Lieutenant.

RAMBO

Let's do it.

TRAUTMAN

Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail

your hide to the shed.

RAMBO

You got it, sir.

DOYLE

Zen Rollercoaster, requesting

clearance.

VOICE

(filtered)

You are cleared, Zen Rollercoaster.

FUHRMAN

Switching communications to burst

mode.

TECHNICIAN

AWACS Two-Five has acquired.  They

are holding timeline.

DOYLE

(into mike)

Here comes the sexy part.

BREWER

Whoo-ya!  I love it!

DOYLE (V.O.)

(filtered)

We just entered Viet airspace,

gentlemen.  Eight klicks to

insertion.

RAMBO

(to Brewer via

headset)

Stay tight on me, Brewer.  I don't

want to have to go looking for you.

BREWER

Check.

TECHNICIAN

AWACS Niner-One via Subic Bay

reports them approaching insertion.

Five-by-Five.

D-MINUS TWO MINUTES

DOYLE (V.O.)

(filtered)

Stand by to climb.

FARMER

(Viet/subtitled)

Son of a bitch!

DOYLE

Approaching ten thousand.  Eleven

seconds to insertion.  Ten, nine...

Slowing to two-thirty...

DOYLE

(continuing)

... three seconds.  Two.  One.  Have

a nice day.

LIFER

Go!

RAMBO

(shouting into mike)

You read me, Brewer?

BREWER (V.O.)

(faint)

Read you.

RAMBO

Home on my strobe.

RAMBO

(to himself)

Man, what are you doing back here?

RAMBO

You okay?

BREWER (V.O.)

Keep it down, man.  I got problems.

CUT TO:

RAMBO

(a freezing whisper)

That's one.

CUT TO:

SLM DNK FIELD TM TO SLM DNK

CONTROL/REPORT INSERTION COMPLETED/

PROCEEDING TO RENDEZVOUS/END MESSAGE

CUT TO:

TECH

It's coming in.

KIRKHILL

They're in!  On the money.

RAMBO

What do you call that?

BREWER

(crisply)

Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79

grenade launcher, with Sionics sound

suppressor, Tracor starlight scope

and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.

RAMBO

Batteries not included.

BREWER

(wounded)

This is state-of-the-art firepower.

RAMBO

What's this?

BREWER

AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic

mike with built-in audio processor.

Can pull a whisper out of a loud

cocktail party at 50 meters.

RAMBO

Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.

(pause)

Let's saddle up.

BREWER

Where's your stuff?

BREWER

(incredulous)

That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a

knife?

RAMBO

There's a compass in the handle.

BREWER

And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every

twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of

those.

RAMBO

Exactly.

BREWER

Uh... this thing's pretty heavy.

You got room for it?

BREWER

Just a thought.

BREWER

You wanna know why I stood up for

this show?

RAMBO

(moving off)

No.

BREWER

I was in the brig.  They gave me a

deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf

cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it

or anything... it was the symbolic

value.  Seemed like a good idea at

the time.

RAMBO

That's a real good reason to wind up

in 'Nam.

BREWER

I've seen worse places.

RAMBO

There are no worse places.

BREWER

(hushed)

This place is a trip.

RAMBO

Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth

century.

BREWER

Damn!  Leeches.

RAMBO

Get used to 'em.

BREWER

(hissing)

You fucking crazy?  I need it to

burn these things off.

RAMBO

No cigarettes.

BREWER

I had it cupped.

BREWER

Look, Rambo.  I've had enough of

your bad-ass Indian-scout bullshit.

You're years out of date... I'm

makin' a career out of teaching you

the hardware.  As far as I'm

concerned you're just along to back

me up.  And I heard about you...

about how twitchy you really are.

Kill any civilians lately?

RAMBO

Listen real careful, freshmeat.  I

don't know why they sent you.  Maybe

they didn't want to waste a good

man.  But you screw up once more and

I'll kill you myself.

BREWER

Man, are you strict.

VOICE (O.S.)

You are first tourist here in long

time.

WOMAN

You come here see Buddha... ask for

truth?  Or just lost?

BREWER

(whispering)

Should I waste her?

RAMBO

(Viet/subtitled)

I'm not lost.  Just looking for

someone.

WOMAN

(Viet/subtitled)

Someone called maybe 'Night Orchid'?

RAMBO

(Viet/subtitled)

That's right.

WOMAN

(Viet/subtitled)

I'm Co Phuong Bao.

RAMBO

(to Brewer)

She's our contact.

BREWER

(grudgingly

impressed)

I didn't know you spoke Vietnamese.

RAMBO

I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.

(to Brewer)

Her name is Co.

CO

It means "virgin."  My mother was

comedian.

BREWER

Howdy, Co.

BREWER

Uh, you speak pretty good English.

Where'd you learn?

CO

University of Saigon.  Have Masters

Degree in economics.  Not use too

much now... Communists in charge.

You got time... want to eat?

RAMBO

Sure.  Whattaya got?

CO

(opening it)

Nuac mam.

RAMBO

You really got a Masters Degree?

CO

Sure.  I only sound like forty-year-

old in your language.

BREWER

What's this stuff on the rice?

RAMBO

Fermented fish sauce.

CUT TO:

RAMBO

How do we get upriver?

CO

I have arranged transportation.  We

meet soon.  But I think you to be

disappointed.

RAMBO

Why's that?

CO

I go up to this camp two months ago.

Nobody there.  Empty for years.

RAMBO

Why would they send us to a deserted

camp?

BREWER

Who cares?  Let's just do it and get

out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid

in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

RAMBO

We'll check it out.

BREWER

How come we didn't just drop near

the camp... save this hassle?

RAMBO

Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?

BREWER

Yeah...

CO

(switching to Viet

subtitled)

Where did you find this clown?

RAMBO

(Viet/subtitled)

I thought he was with you.

CO

(Viet/subtitled)

Crazy motherfucker.

BREWER

What's she saying?

RAMBO

She likes you.  Says you're dinky-

dau.

BREWER

What's that?

RAMBO

Powerful warrior.

BREWER

Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey,

Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one-

eyed snake?

BREWER

(under his breath)

These guys look like they'd sell

their mothers.

RAMBO

Sometimes they do.  They're river

pirates.  Opium runners.

BREWER

(hissing)

Pirates?  No kidding?

CAPTAIN TRONG KINH

Wa-ky number one.  You come number

one sampan.

RAMBO

(Viet/subtitled)

Thank you, Captain, for your

hospitality.  You speak English very

well.

BREWER

Looks like my room in college.

CO

We sleep here today.  Safe here

while go up river.

RAMBO

What about patrol boats?

CUT TO:

KIRKHILL

(to phone)

No, sir... we're already committed.

They're in the jungle right now.  I

say we play the hand through... if

they find something we just bury the

report later.  It's still airtight.

(pause)

Yes, sir.

KIRKHILL

(to aide)

Goddamn it!  Now the goddamn

satellite shows the camp occupied...

some trucks or something.

AIDE

(grimly)

Oh, boy.  It's getting dicey.

KIRKHILL

What's up?

TRAUTMAN

Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a

fifth wheel in your setup here... I

thought I'd go out with the

extraction team tonight.  Unless you

have an objection.

KIRKHILL

(not liking it)

It's not necessary.

TRAUTMAN

I know.

KIRKHILL

That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full

Colonels are supposed to be above

that sort of thing.

TRAUTMAN

I know...

KIRKHILL

(shrugs expansively)

Have fun.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

RAMBO

Have some armpit sauce.

RAMBO

(to Co)

How did you get started working for

the spooks?

CO

Spooks?

RAMBO

Intelligence work.

CO

Oh.  They talk to me at university

before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

BREWER

Everybody's makin' deals.

CO

My brother captain in ARVN... need

papers to go United States, or North

Vietnamese will execute.  They make

deal... I stay here and do work...

my brother and my son can go United

States.

RAMBO

Your son?

CO

Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him

for eight years.

RAMBO

Where's his father?

CO

Dead.  Killed in war.

RAMBO

Where's Nguyen now?  What city?

CO

(noting his concern)

Huntington Beach, California.

RAMBO

It's nice there.  He's probably

digging every minute.  Got a

surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.

CO

(distractedly)

Nguyen is good boy.

BREWER

Some hardened guerrilla fighter they

gave us.

CO

River patrol!

RAMBO

How you doing, Brewer?

BREWER

(shaken)

I need a vacation.

RAMBO

Check the tower with your scope.

BREWER

Nobody home.  Wait a minute!

Cigarette.

BREWER

What's he here for?

BREWER

(intently)

Snoring.  Five, six guys.

Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody

talking in his sleep.  A toilet

flushing.

RAMBO

Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

BREWER

Breathing.  Moaning.

(suddenly)

Shit!

RAMBO

(nodding grimly)

Bad dreams.  Prisoner's barracks.

Shoot some.

CO

Cyclo-girl whore from village.

Business slow there.

RAMBO

She's making him a pretty good deal.

RAMBO

What's that?  By the far tower.

BREWER

It's a guy in a cage.

RAMBO

American?

BREWER

Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real

scrunched up in that thing.

RAMBO

Let me see.

RAMBO

Roundeye.

BREWER

Alright.  Home run.

RAMBO

(angrily)

Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't

sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.

BREWER

Bastards.  Let's get some shots.

RAMBO

That guy's not going to make it.

BREWER (O.S.)

Nothing we can do, man.

RAMBO

I'm getting him out.

BREWER

What?  Are you crazy?  We're

supposed to take pictures and split.

You're gonna blow the whole program.

RAMBO

You never been in one of those

things.

BREWER

I suppose you have...

BREWER

It's orders!  You remember... when

they tell you to do something and

then you do it.  John Wayne is dead,

man.

RAMBO

(rising)

You take pictures and split.  I'm

going in.

BREWER

Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Aw... ke-rist.

BREWER

How we gonna do it?

CUT TO:

PRISONER

(barely audible)

Who're you?

RAMBO

American.  Come to get you out.

PRISONER

Man, you are one scary-looking

motherfucker!

RAMBO

Can you walk?

PRISONER

I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna

be... stiff.

RAMBO

What's your name?

PRISONER

De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio.

Lieutenant... Air Force.

RAMBO

(shakes his hand)

Good to meet you, Dave.  I'm Rambo.

Okay, I'm going to carry you.  Don't

cough or make any noise.

DE FRAVIO

Sure thing, Rambo.  You gettin' the

other guys, too?

RAMBO

Not this time.  We'll be back.

RAMBO

(to Brewer)

That's two.

DE FRAVIO

(weakly)

You guys are real... aren't you?

BREWER

Huh?

DE FRAVIO

Sorry, I mean... I talk to people

all the time... I know a lot of them

aren't there.  But this is real,

isn't it?  You're taking me home

now?

BREWER

That's right, buddy.

DE FRAVIO

Thank God... thank you...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RAMBO

We'd better go for the emergency LZ

at point Zulu Sierra.  Tell them

we've got some heat but don't

mention De Fravio.

CUT TO:

TECH

You're go for extraction.  Mr.

Kirkhill says wind 'er up.  Here's

the hardcopy.

Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500.

It says "May have heat.  Don't be

late.  All our love."

DOYLE

(scowling at his

watch)

Let's get that tent down!

CUT TO:

DE FRAVIO

I gotta tell you, it's just luck you

guys came when you did.  They move

us around a lot... We only been at

that camp a week.  Got a smoke?

BREWER

(pointedly)

No.

DE FRAVIO

What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you

call this?

RAMBO

Why were you in the box?

DE FRAVIO

Well, I caught this cobra, see...

BREWER

You mean the snake?

DE FRAVIO

Yeah.  It's not hard once you get

the hang of it.  In the wrist.

Anyway, I did what I always do when

I get one...

BREWER

What's that?

DE FRAVIO

(straight-faced)

Put it in the guard's barracks.

(pause)

Man they got pissed.  They beat the

crap out of me, but... it's kind of

a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run

around.

RAMBO

(chuckling)

You got a bad attitude.

DE FRAVIO

I know it.

DE FRAVIO

Thanks lady.  You're pretty cute...

doing anything this weekend?

CO

(smiling)

Eat slowly.  Don't make yourself

sick.

BREWER

Twenty-five minutes.  We'd better

roll.

KINH

Wa-ky number ten.  Do-ma.

DE FRAVIO

Yeah, fuck your mama-san, too.  In

the...

BREWER

(enraged beyond

belief)

You slope bitch!

DE FRAVIO

(slowly)

Wow!

BREWER

What just happened?

RAMBO

(Viet/subtitled)

Are you okay?

CO

(answering in

English)

Yes.  But I lose many merits in next

life.  Very bad.

RAMBO

Why'd they want us?

CO

They heard about escaped prisoner on

radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

BREWER

They sold us out?  Now I'm pissed.

CO

They were fools.  To think there

would be reward.  And to ask my

help.

RAMBO

Thanks.

CO

Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh

say meet them here.  Whole garrison

from Con Cuong is out.

RAMBO

(nodding grimly)

Let's go.

need it.

RAMBO

You better take off.

BREWER

Ain't you coming with us, sweet

thing?

CO

My orders stay here.

RAMBO

See you in California.

CO

FUHRMAN

Roger, Slam Dunk One... what is your

position?

RAMBO

(yelling)

Zen Hammer... the heat's on.  We're

taking fire.  Watch for my smoke.

Red and green.  Northwest corner of

a big paddy.

(to Brewer)

Let's move.

BREWER

Go for it, man.  Good therapy.

BREWER

(on radio)

You guys comin' or what?

FUHRMAN

Roger... we have you on visual.  We

are coming in.  How many are you?

BREWER (V.O.)

(filtered)

Three.  We got an American POW with

us.

TRAUTMAN

Relay to command.  They have one of

ours.

TELECOM TECH

Mr.  Kirkhill... I have an AWACS

relay.  Zen Hammer reports the

ground team has an American POW with

them.

KIRKHILL

What did you say?

TELECOM TECH

(grinning)

They've got one of ours.

KIRKHILL

(loudly)

This station is now on Condition

Bravo.  Harrison.  Meyers.  Goodell.

Out... now!

KIRKHILL

(continuing to tech)

Go to your COMINT priority

frequency.  Give me the mike... Zen

Hammer, this is Coach One.  This is

an Alpha-Kilo-Victor command

priority.

FUHRMAN (V.O.)

(filtered)

Roger, Coach One... go ahead.

KIRKHILL

I want you to abort the operation

immediately.

FUHRMAN

Say again, Coach One?

FUHRMAN

(to Trautman)

He wants us to abort before pick-up.

TRAUTMAN

Confirm it.

FUHRMAN

It is confirmed.

(to mike)

Coach One... we have them in

sight...

(pause)

Yes, sir.

DOYLE

Turnin' around.

FUHRMAN

(to Doyle)

I thought you liked those guys.

DOYLE

I do.  But they ain't payin' the

rent, Jack.

TRAUTMAN

Stay on your heading, Captain.

DOYLE

Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.

TRAUTMAN

That's an order.

DOYLE

(implacable)

Sorry, Sir.

LIFER

(smirking)

We ain't Uncle Sam's misguided

children no more, Colonel.  We're

independent contractors.

FUHRMAN

That's right, Sir.  We don't like

this, but we are working for Mr.

Kirkhill.

TRAUTMAN

You pathetic scum.

DOYLE

(looking down)

Well, if there weren't POWs before,

there are now.

BREWER

Where's he going?

(to radio)

Hey, Zen Hammer, where are you

going?

(pause)

Do you read, Zen Hammer?  Over.  Son

of a bitch!  They're ditching us!

BREWER

(through gritted

teeth)

The fuckers left us, man... they

left us.

DE FRAVIO

Oh... God.

CUT TO:

KIRKHILL

Have a drink.

TRAUTMAN

Why?

KIRKHILL

(shrugs)

You got five hours?  I'll tell you

about Secretaries of State, and

funding committees and diplomatic

relations...

TRAUTMAN

Take your time.

KIRKHILL

Look, Colonel... we're all adults

here.  This is a war.  A very quiet,

very intense war.  People get

sacrificed.

TRAUTMAN

Not my people.

TRAUTMAN

(continuing)

But you're right... some people do

get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you

pulled the plug.

KIRKHILL

You think I'm some whacko?  I like

to hurt people?  I'm doing a job

here.  If I knew what's right or

wrong I'd be a goddamned priest,

right?  So I follow directives... I

do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If

your boy had done what he was told,

there wouldn't be a problem.

TRAUTMAN

Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be

walking funny.

KIRKHILL

Look, it was a screw-up, alright?

They weren't supposed to find

anything.  We thought that camp was

empty.

TRAUTMAN

This mission was a scam from the

word go?

KIRKHILL

Word came down... they wanted an

answer.  And they knew the answer

they wanted: no POWs.  But it had

to look good.  Best effort.  The

whole dog-and-pony show.

TRAUTMAN

(realizing)

Rambo and Brewer were selected as

write-offs.

KIRKHILL

It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo

was a decorated Vietnam vet, a

former POW himself... if he came out

and said "No POWs" the sub-committee

would buy it.  He gets himself

caught he's a private citizen, a

whacko, acting on his own.  If he

gets proof, it gets lost somewhere

between here and D.C.  Airtight.

But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero.

Thinks he's starring in his own war

movie or something.  He put me in a

corner.  No choice.

TRAUTMAN

"Terminate with extreme prejudice."

KIRKHILL

That's a crock.  We don't say that.

Do you have any idea the shitstorm

if he'd gotten back with that guy?

If it went public?  The White House

would have to act through channels.

We're talking ransom.  Four billion

bucks in war reparations to Vietnam

to get the others back.  That's

billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For

a few guys that've had their brains

in a blender for ten years?  A pain

in the ass to everybody?  No way.

There's no way.

TRAUTMAN

So there never was a Phase Two

rescue team?

KIRKHILL

Of course not.  You can't get

approval to rescue a kitten from a

tree after Tehran.

TRAUTMAN

I understand.

KIRKHILL

Here.  Drink.

TRAUTMAN

(reasonably)

I understand your position.

(pause)

I understand how a maggot like you

can just slide out of a jam on a

trail of slime.  And call it --

expedience.

(viciously)

Expedience!

KIRKHILL

You're out of your depth, Trautman.

Way out.  I'm acting correctly here.

Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle

ace.

(pause)

It's over.  Walk away.

TRAUTMAN

It's not over.  You made one

mistake.

KIRKHILL

What that?

TRAUTMAN

Rambo.

PODOVSK

(in Russian)

Put him in the chair.

PODOVSK

(Viet to Vinh)

Thank you, Captain Vinh.  Leave one

guard, please.

PODOVSK

These people are so... vulgar in

their approach.  I am Lieutenant

Commander Podovsk.  I do not know

who you are.  Will you tell me?

PODOVSK

(continuing)

No?  Not even your name?

(silence)

This is a poor beginning for an

intimate relationship.  By tomorrow

or the next day you will tell me

things you would not tell a lover.

PODOVSK

(continuing)

I see you are no stranger to pain.

Then of course you must know how

senseless it is to resist in the

long run.  Is it possible you have

been among my Vietnamese comrades

before?

PODOVSK

(continuing)

Yes.  I think that must be it.

Where were you held?  Hanoi?  Son

Tay?  I apologize.  I'm getting

ahead.  Sometimes I get too eager.

My comrade and I, in our capacity as

advisors, have been sent from our

center at Cam Ranh Bay to discover

from you certain things... for

example: whether you are working

directly for the American

government... Who your contacts

were... and on and on.  Quite a

list.  Will you tell me these things

now?

PODOVSK

(continuing)

Of course you won't.  But, as a

moral man, I felt compelled to ask.

PODOVSK

This is Lieutenant Palyushin.  To

him you are a piece of meat.

(in Russian to

Palyushin)

Proceed.

PODOVSK

I was sent here because of my

command of your language.  It will

be frustrating if we cannot have a

nice chat.  Very frustrating.

(Russian to

Palyushin)

Ready?

PODOVSK

(Russian)

Test please.

PODOVSK

Oh, yes.  Here is something you

might be interested in.

PODOVSK

A transcript of the conversation

between your helicopter pilot and

his commander, intercepted and

unscrambled by our overworked

cryptography staff.

(reading)

Mmm.  "Zen Hammer... Slam Dunk."

Colorful names.  Here we are: "Ah,

Coach One... we have them in sight."

And the reply: "Abort immediately.

Return to base camp."

PODOVSK

It seems they intentionally

abandoned you on direct orders.

There are the people you protect

with your silence?  With your pain?

PODOVSK

(almost kindly)

But you must scream.  You must.

There is no shame.

BREWER

Bastards!

PODOVSK

Hey, Brewer.  You okay?

I could use a beer.

DE FRAVIO

Your buddy made it out last night.

The place went apeshit.

BREWER

Really?  How come he didn't take me?

DE FRAVIO

Maybe because you're shot in the

leg.

BREWER

Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they

keep you in this disease hole?

JENSEN

Who knows?  I was in there for a

month once.  De Fravio did three

months.

BREWER

How do you keep from coming unglued?

JENSEN

Concentrate on a problem.  Like, I

built my dream house in my head,

brick by brick.  Board by board.  If

something really takes a day, I

thought about it for a whole day.

Like that.

DE FRAVIO

I built a shopping mall.

Watch it.  Don't fuck with me, man!

I'm dinky dau!

PODOVSK

I think you know where he is going.

Is there a rendezvous point?  Some

guerrilla contract?  A transmitter

perhaps.

BREWER

(earnestly)

No way.  If I say anything... that's

three.

PODOVSK

(rising)

I cannot be responsible for the

safety of the prisoners if he is not

captured.  This government now

considers the existence of POWs an

embarrassment.  An unmarked grave in

the jungle may be their solution.  I

am only an advisor.

Advise my dick, you Siberian

scumbag.
