FADE IN:

YOUNG ADULT

Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...

KWAN

At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks

trained in iron palm until our hands bled...

(beat)

... then we trained some more.

YOUNG ADULT

(getting back into horse stance)

I guess not...

KWAN

Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!

STUDENT

Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce

Lee...

KWAN

Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in

flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is

effective. Show me.

KWAN (CONT'D)

(shaking his head)

A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never

mind.

KWAN (CONT'D)

Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen

uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.

I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!

MOTHER

I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.

KWAN

Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors

depend on heart and soul  that's how they saved the

T'ang emporer.

KWAN (CONT'D)

Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.

(to class)

STUDENT 2

What do you want us to do?

KWAN

When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the

cliff. Understand?

STUDENT 2

No.

KWAN

No matter.

DREW

MASTER KWAN!

DREW (CONT'D)

Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!

KWAN

(blustering)

I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?

DREW

Practicing. I saw it in this movie...

KWAN

Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...

Should study tapes of opponent.

DREW

I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had

tapes to study... they did it this way... right?

KWAN

Not quite  our drills at the temple had meaning. If we

had tapes, we would have watched them.

KWAN (CONT'D)

"The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win

100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.

All    these years of one on one training  you're the best

I've    ever taught.

DREW

The best?

KWAN

Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior

the rest will take care of itself.

(picks up tape)

Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!

BOB

(shouting)

Are you screwing around with this stuff again?

DREW

Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?

BOB

It's your attitude that bothers me, son.

DREW

I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.

BOB

(cutting him off)

Don't say a word, yellow man.

BOB (CONT'D)

You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were

taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and

make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!

DREW

(sarcastic)

When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going

to let you be part of my entourage...

BOB

You mean when you're in jail...

DREW

Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything

from you.

KWAN

Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.

BOB

How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you

never really wanted... ?

KWAN

I wish I had the chance...

TREVOR

They said you were good... ha!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Can't you get me any quality sparring partners?

PFEELGUT

It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy

your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat

him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear

you    forever.

PFEELGUT (CONT'D)

Exactly!

PFEELGUT (CONT'D)

GET HIM! NOW!!

TREVOR

Ah, Master Kim.

(to physiologist)

I'll look at these stats later.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Are all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think?

KIM

(thick accent)

You velly good fighter...

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't

know...

KIM

A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is

therefore vulnerable.

TREVOR

(after a beat)

Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap.

(beat)

You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum.

CHAUNCY

Very good, sir.

TREVOR

Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to

the left, Sam.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure...

COMPETITOR

Hey, Trevor! What's the 2nd uniform for?

TREVOR

The finals.

COMPETITOR

(after he's gone)

Cocky bastard...

ANNOUNCER

Fighting for the Grand Championship: Trevor Gottitall and

Drew Carson. 3 rounds, max point. Gentlemen, bow to the

ref, to each other...

KWAN

You only lose if you give up.

DISSOLVE TO:

TREVOR

I was never worried. He's no match for me. I just hope

the 2nd place trophy is a belt!

DISSOLVE TO:

KWAN

Next time we get that guy...

DREW

(shaking his head)

No next time, Master. Maybe...

(big sigh)

... you should find a new student. I just can't do it

I'm not getting any better!

KWAN (CONT'D)

Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...

KWAN (CONT'D)

I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the

time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was

coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers

stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.

It was all we had left to eat  no more money. These were

hard times in China, people were selling their children

for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop

soldiers with guns, though? Yes?

KWAN (CONT'D)

Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of

the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.

Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and

the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,

and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,

and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing

with the dust of the street.

KWAN (CONT'D)

The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,

touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I

watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was

larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed

then and there to become like him, fight for right like

the Shaolin.

KWAN (CONT'D)

I never did, though. My family left China and ended up

here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in

China.

DREW

You mean... all the stories...?

KWAN

(nodding)

Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I

realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself

that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other

people.

DREW

Why are you telling me this?

KWAN

I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was

never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have

all the potential in the world, but I can't take you

where you want to go.

KWAN (CONT'D)

There, that should control the swelling.

DREW

So you're not a Shaolin?

KWAN

No.

DREW

Never were?

KWAN

No.

KWAN (CONT'D)

What?

DREW

If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.

KWAN

What are you talking about?

DREW

I'm going to the Shaolin Temple  they can train me so I

will never lose like that again.

KWAN

He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold

cloth.

DREW

(eyes intent)

Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right

training     where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's

holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you

couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.

KWAN

I must pay for your ticket...

DREW

No! I'll make it there myself.

KWAN

I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be

those stories. You can live my dream for me  at least

let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble

he's caused.

DREW

Master...

DREW

Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?

DREW

Hello, ladies! Can you tell me how to get to the Shaolin

Temple?

DREW (CONT'D)

The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't

anyone speak English here?

ASHEMA

I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak

Chinese than to expect us to speak English?

DREW

(flustered)

You're right. I apologize  I've just been trying to get

to the temple for a long time now.

ASHEMA

Why do you want to find the temple?

DREW

(not without pride)

I am going to join the temple as a monk.

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

I'm going that way  I can take you.

DREW

You have a car?

ASHEMA

The next best thing.

(beat)

This is a Chinese car.

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

Hop on.

DISSOLVE TO:

ASHEMA

We are here.

DREW

Whoa!

ASHEMA

I have to help my grandfather with our stand. If you get

a chance, come by later.

DREW

(distracted)

I'll try, but monks aren't allowed to be around girls.

ASHEMA

Good luck.

DREW

Shaolin monks don't need luck...

(beat)

Hey, thanks a lot for the ride. I hope I see you again.

DREW

Excuse me, Master.

DREW (CONT'D)

Hello? Busy, huh?

DREW (CONT'D)

Master, may I ask you a question?

DREW (CONT'D)

What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple?

Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?

Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?

DREW

That was great! Great!

MONK 1

No tourists! Temple closed!

DREW

So you can see me?!?

MONK 1

(very agitated)

No tourists! No tourists!

DREW (CONT'D)

I'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk!

ADMISSIONS MONK

That's not possible.

DREW

What do you mean, sir?

ADMISSIONS MONK

The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is

no foreigners.

DREW

I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned

away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.

ADMISSIONS MONK

What people want and what they can have are often not the

same.

DREW

Not in this case.

MONK

Oh, yes, especially in this case.

DREW

I'm not leaving.

MONK

You give me no choice.

(to other monks)

Remove him.

DREW

I just want to be a monk!

CUT TO:

DREW

Hey! What about my...

ASHEMA

Drew?

DREW

Hi.

DREW (CONT'D)

Make it a double. Rough day.

ASHEMA

What happened?

DREW

They kicked me out...

DISSOLVE TO:

ASHEMA

You've had enough.

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New

York.

DREW

I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk.

I'd be even more of a disgrace...

ASHEMA

Not now, Bau Bau.

DREW

Bau Bau?

ASHEMA

My nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about

the temple.

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

He is telling a story about a monk who was refused

admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be

allowed to be a monk.

DREW

What did he do?

ASHEMA

He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until

they let him in.

DREW

How long?

ASHEMA

A long time  through the worst weather. He just sat

there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.

DREW

Did they let him in?

ASHEMA

No.

(beat)

Of course they did  what kind of story do you think my

Bau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple

until they could no longer say no. He went on to become

one of the most famous monks in the history of the

temple.

DREW

Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise

man. And that he tells a good story.

ASHEMA

What are you going to do? Are you going home?

DREW

I'm camping out.

DREW (CONT'D)

In front of the temple.

ADMISSIONS MONK

Go home! You cannot stay here!

ADMISSIONS MONK (CONT'D)

Do you hear me? Go away!

DRILL SERGEANT

Will you give up? I think so.

ASHEMA

Give this up, Drew! Please?

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

My Bau Bau says, keep it up! He is proud of you...

DISSOLVE TO:

SAN DE

My head is shiny enough already, don't you think?

DREW

You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just

goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun

of you...

SAN DE

What are you trying to do?

DREW

I want to become a monk  they won't let me in... Hey,

you're just a grunt, a janitor sweeping up and all, don't

sweat it. It's not your problem...

SAN DE

Why are you sitting here?

DREW

I got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldn't

leave. I thought...

SAN DE

Has it been hard?

DREW

It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually,

but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The

sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I

mean?

SAN DE

(nodding)

Much of the training at the temple is in that direction

self sacrifice. Tell me more.

DREW

At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,

things changed. Maybe it's like hitting the wall in

running  it was like I became part of the courtyard, and

I felt powerful. Even the spider became my friend...

DREW (CONT'D)

It was an incredible experience  I said I'd do it, and I

did it.

SAN DE

I wish you all the best.

DREW

Same to you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ASHEMA

They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting

monks at Shaolin.

ASHEMA (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Drew. It was a good effort.

MONK

Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?

DISCIPLE 1

Yes, without pause.

MONK

Do you renounce the earthly world?

DREW

Sure do, master. You bet.

MONK

Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it

means death?

DREW

I do.

DRILL SERGEANT

(whispering)

Answer "Yes, without pause."

DREW

(rubbing his side)

Yes, without pause.

MONK

Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple?

DISCIPLE 2

Bodhidharma.

MONK

Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your

spiritual leaders?

DREW

Yes, without pause.

MONK

Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal

gain?

DREW

Yes, without pause.

DREW (CONT'D)

I mean, no, of course not.

SAN DE

Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin

Temple?

DRILL SERGEANT

Yes, without pause, Master San De.

DREW

(under his breath)

I'll be damned!

GAO

Shut up!

DREW

(holding his side)

Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...

SAN DE

Are they ready to begin their training?

DRILL SERGEANT

They are.

SAN DE

Then, let us welcome them into our ranks!

DREW

You got a problem, man?

GAO

You, American...

SAN DE

Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will

introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.

DREW

Great, just great.

DREW

What are you doing, man?

MONK

You must surrender this.

DREW

No way, man! Get your own...

D.S.

It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the backpack into

the sleeping quarters.

(to Drew)

Do not cling to material things  it is not good for your

soul.

DREW (CONT'D)

What's with that guy?

LI

Watch out for Gao. He's trouble.

DREW

Really? I hadn't noticed... Why'd they let him in,

anyway?

LI

Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?

DREW

No, that was me...

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think...

D.S.

This will symbolize your final break from the outside

world.

DREW (CONT'D)

Can't I just wear a patch?

DREW

What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody...

DREW (CONT'D)

If I look half as stupid as you guys do, I'm really in

trouble...

GAO

I want another bed.

D.S.

Why?

GAO (CONT'D)

I won't sleep next to the American.

D.S.

We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We

are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk.

GAO (CONT'D)

Well, this monk smells!

LI

I will switch with Disciple Gao.

D.S.

Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training

tomorrow.

DREW

Jerk!

DREW (CONT'D)

Thanks for what you did.

LI

Where are you from?

DREW

New York City. You?

LI

Beijing. What is New York like?

DREW

Amazing. I'll tell you about...

GAO

Shut UP!

DREW

Blow me!

DREW (CONT'D)

Good night, Li.

LI

Wan an.

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

You got to be kidding.

D.S.

You don't like it, don't eat it.

DREW (CONT'D)

I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it... Geez!

DREW (CONT'D)

Well, at least we start training today, right, guys?

DREW

Wonder what they'll start us with first?

LI

Iron Palm?

SHU

Wooden Man, I think.

WU

No, it'll be basics, first day. Horse stance, kicks and

punches...

WU

Basics, I told you.

D.S.

Each one of you take a shovel.

DREW

We're using the shovels as weapons?

D.S.

(smiling)

Weapons...

(beat)

... in the war on infection.

D.S. (CONT'D)

You will be digging today, digging our new latrines.

DREW

Latrines? Why?

D.S.

A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask

questions. He just obeys.

DREW (CONT'D)

I came halfway around the world to dig latrines? I could

have just joined the army...

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW (CONT'D)

"Ain't no cure for the Shaolin Temple Blues... "

OR

"Working on a Chain Gang"

OR (CONT'D)

"I fought the law and the law won"

OR (CONT'D)

"16 tons"

D.S.

Any problems?

DREW

(shocked)

What'd you do that for?

D.S.

Do a job well or don't do it.

D.S.

Sorry, all gone. Get some more.

DREW (CONT'D)

I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah...

DREW

Don't tell me, I know. Get more water...

GAO

Back up and let me pass.

DREW

No chance, Gao. You back up.

D.S.

(heartlessly)

Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you

will be fine.

LI

What happened?

D.S.

He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must

leave the temple.

LI (CONT'D)

The "Wooden Man Chamber"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin

monk...

WU

Did you see his face?

SHU

Poor guy.

GAO

He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if

half of us go out the same way.

MEDITATION MONK

Breath in through your nose, out through your mouth.

Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching

your thoughts flow by. Clear your mind... Think of

nothing.

DREW

Come out, goddamn it! Show yourself!

DREW

So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway?

LI

Human waste.

DREW

Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's

disgusting!

DREW (CONT'D)

Hi, Gao. How you doing?

GAO

(a little worried)

Let me pass.

DREW (CONT'D)

There's something on the bottom of your basket.

DREW (CONT'D)

Oops! I think I found the problem.

(beat)

A hole.

DREW (CONT'D)

(to Li)

Well, somebody sure smells!

DREW

This is ridiculous.

D.S.

Back to work.

DREW (CONT'D)

I've got an idea on how to get even with our beloved

Drill Sergeant...

D.S.

You are all responsible for anything that happens within

your group. What happened yesterday falls on everyone's

shoulders. So, all of you will do double work...

MEDITATION MONK

Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years without sleeping. Think

you can manage 9 minutes?

DREW

We came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free

men...

MU

But we swore to obey them...

DREW

An uninformed choice is no choice at all!

MU

Huh?

DREW

We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even

know we're dissatisfied, things will never change.

GAO

They haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen

to you?

DREW

Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?

WU

I'm with you!

DREW

I'm for going to the Headmaster right now!

DREW (CONT'D)

You're either with us, Gao, or you're against us.

DREW

Master San De!

SAN DE

Who else?

DREW

We have something to say...

SAN DE

This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my

way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all.

DREW

I request permission to go first.

SAN DE

I think I'd better...

DREW

No, really, I want to...

SAN DE

Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical

labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility

and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be

given chores every    day  remember the first time you saw

me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

You've all performed    admirably, and have learned an

important lesson  to    obey your shr fu without question.

Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial

training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow

morning.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

And, what did you have to say to me?

DREW

I... I mean we, just wanted to... thank you for the

opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the

Shaolin Temple.

(beat)

Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?

DREW

Gentlemen, this calls for a party!

GAO

You're trying to get us all kicked out!

DREW

I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!

D.S.

Go to sleep. Lights out.

GAO

It's not over, American.

D.S.

You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,

alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is

free time.

MONK

In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a

series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the

times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu

from these exercises.

MONK (CONT'D)

The spirit of Bodhidharma remains. Training is like

meditation. Be aware of everything, but aware of nothing

in particular. Think not thinking.

DREW

What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?

MONK

Non thinking.

MONK (CONT'D)

Your training begins today, in this most sacred of

training halls. The floor bears witness to the efforts of

fighting monks from centuries past.

MONK (CONT'D)

At the Shaolin temple, we forge our bodies in the fire of

our wills. We adhere to a vow of non-violence, unless

someone else is in danger... Follow my movements...

DREW

I can't do this!

D.S.

Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't.

MONK

Block the way I showed you.

DREW

(showing him a block)

This is the way I was taught.

MONK (CONT'D)

Do it this way. You won't get hit.

GAO

(menacingly)

My turn.

MONK

Emotions cloud the spirit  eliminate them.

DREW

This isn't martial arts  it's gymnastics!

MONK

This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.

D.S.

I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the

day. I'll need a partner...

D.S.

Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from

shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling.

DREW

(looking at ground)

Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.

D.S.

Do they always use mats in America?

D.S. (CONT'D)

If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao

would assist me...

DREW

Let's do it.

D.S.

Attack me straight on...

D.S.

Any questions? Good, that's all for today.

DREW (CONT'D)

I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.

D.S.

I said that's enough.

DREW (CONT'D)

If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I

understand.

D.S.

Attack!

DREW (CONT'D)

I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!

LI

Are you trying to kill yourself?

DREW

He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's

all.

LI

If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor...

DREW

I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious.

I'm all right.

D.S.

Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try

to hold your stance. Li, you're first.

D.S.

Next...

DREW

Thought I'd join you guys.

D.S.

In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest

lightly, and your partner tries to block.

D.S.

Something wrong?

D.S.

Switch!

MONK

The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just

try to tap his chest.

DREW

I know, but...

MONK

Then do it that way...

DREW

This sure beats sweeping...

D.S.

Sweep the main chamber, Drew.

DREW (CONT'D)

Yes, master.

DREW

(imitating an announcer)

Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the

Shaolin temple... Drew Carson!

DREW

The crowd is going wild.

SAN DE

He was an amazing monk...

DREW

Yeah, what's up with him?

SAN DE

Come with me...

SAN DE

Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while

meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction

we all have to fight against.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for

betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the

ground.

(beat)

From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even

the leaves look like eyelids.

DREW

Impossible.

SAN DE

Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your

will is strong.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

I understand you've been questioning some of the

teachings of the temple...

DREW

It's just not the way I was taught...

DREW (CONT'D)

Master! Stop! No more will go in!

SAN DE

Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have

learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first

empty your cup?

SAN DE (CONT'D)

The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free

you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmful

thoughts.

(beat)

Drink your tea.

DREW

It's not fighting  I feel like I'm dancing or

something... This soft stuff is unnatural  Fighting

should be hard, tough...

D.S.

If my hand was always like this, what would you call it?

DREW

(after a beat)

Deformed.

D.S.

And if it was always like this?

DREW (CONT'D)

Again, deformed.

D.S.

Remember, let no one know you are disciples at the

Shaolin Temple, but do not forget that you are. Dzai

Jyan.

LI

Drew! We're not supposed to...

DREW

Chill out, guys! It's our day off!

DREW

Check it out, guys!

WU

Girls!

DREW

Good work, Wu. What tipped you off?

LI

(alarmed)

We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is

the most serious rule of the temple.

DREW

It's a stupid rule, Li. But...

DREW (CONT'D)

ASHEMA!

DREW (CONT'D)

ASHEMA! Here!

DREW (CONT'D)

What!?!

LI

You can get kicked out of the temple for this...

DREW

Who's going to tell, Li? You?

DREW

(pointing at girls)

Not the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look

great!

ASHEMA

(hiding a laugh)

You look... funny.

DREW (CONT'D)

Thanks.

ASHEMA

How do you like the temple?

DREW

Shhh... nobody's supposed to know.

LI

We really shouldn't be doing this...

DREW

I'm trying to show you guys a good time.

(to Ashema)

I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you.

ASHEMA

My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you

and your friends come?

DREW

We'll be there.

LI

Are you nuts? We can't go to a party, with GIRLS!

DREW

Why not? We're working hard, we deserve some R & R.

LI

'R & R'?

DREW

We've earned this. Back home in New York, you don't say

no to a party... Where's your sense of adventure?

WU

What do you do at a 'party' with girls?

DREW

You dance, and talk. And have a good time.

LI

That clinches it, we can't dance.

WU

And we don't know how to talk to girls...

DREW

(trying to sound like an expert)

That's easy. You just talk to them like you would to the

guys  you just don't tell them as much, and... not in

the same way...

GAO

Like you know?

DREW

Look, dancing's easy. I'll show you. We'll start with

slow dancing.

DREW (CONT'D)

Dirty dancing!

DREW (CONT'D)

You guys grab a pillow for a partner, while I find some

slow music.

DREW (CONT'D)

Just move in time to the music, nothing elaborate. Think

of it as a soft form...

DREW (CONT'D)

Loosen up, Li. She's not going to bite!

LI

How do you know?

DREW

This is going to be great...

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

I thought this was light contact!

GAO

Fight, you coward!

DREW

You got it.

D.S.

Stop!

D.S.

(to others)

Back to work.

SAN DE

So soon?

(beat)

Tell me what happened.

DREW

It was my fault. I started it.

DREW (CONT'D)

Disciple Gao was better than me.

DREW (CONT'D)

I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.

SAN DE

Is this true, Disciple Gao?

GAO

Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...

SAN DE

I didn't think you were...

(beat)

The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We

challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other.

Never do we fight to see who is best  we train to be

able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet

express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch

or kick in anger.

(beat)

Shake hands and let your emotions go.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple.

It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle

of understanding.

DREW

The best fighter?

SAN DE

Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of

being a Shaolin monk.

GAO

Yours?

SAN DE

Return to your training.

DREW

Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...

GAO

In your dreams...

DREW

Now, we're ready!

DREW (CONT'D)

Gao, you coming or what?

GAO

I'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble!

GAO

(whisper)

Drunken Kung Fu...

DREW

Are we men or are we sheep?

GROUP

SHEEP!

DREW

Great party...

DREW (CONT'D)

Play this when I signal, OK?

DREW (CONT'D)

Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of

China...

DREW (CONT'D)

This is Gao. And this wild man is Li...

DREW (CONT'D)

Hit it!

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

(eyes still closed)

Not now, Li...

DREW (CONT'D)

What can I do for you?

TOUGH

Leave.

DREW

No, thanks.

DREW (CONT'D)

Can't we talk this over?

DREW

Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?

GAO

I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole

day!

LI

We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we

get away with it?

DREW

I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already

gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.

WU

I've lost my appetite.

DREW

Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our

stories in case they seperate us...

LI

Seperate us?

DREW

Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?

D.S.

Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber...

D.S.

Just Drew.

HEADMISTRESS

He's the one!

SAN DE

Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?

SAN DE (CONT'D)

The police have also come. A morals violation is what

brought them...

POLICE LIEUTENANT

We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!

POLICE CAPTAIN

He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He

must leave.

SAN DE

This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we

will have to take under advisement  but we will handle

matters of this temple.

POLICE CAPTAIN

This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized

to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight,

where he will be held until he leaves the country.

D.S.

Master, may I?

(San De nods)

We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our

ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure.

Can we do that?

D.S.

You are wise. You know what is right and what is not

right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong.

Who will teach him if we do not?

HEADMISTRESS

He does not belong here!

DREW

(whisper)

Chill out, honey!

D.S.

Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from

that which he so desperately needs?

SAN DE

Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought

this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight

knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.

POLICE CAPTAIN

I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.

SAN DE

You will not have to.

DREW

Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you

both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen

again.

SAN DE

Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the

morning.

DREW

But I thought... the police...

D.S.

You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal,

but you cannot stay.

DREW (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Master.

SAN DE

As am I.

GAO

Why only you?

LI

The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for

what happens.

WU

It's not fair.

DREW

It doesn't have to be fair...

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

I hate long goodbyes anyway...

GAO

You're either with us or against us, remember?

DREW

(smiling)

I'm with you!

SAN DE

Quite a show of solidarity, yes?

SAN DE (CONT'D)

Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?

DREW

(caught off guard)

To train, Master.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for

your inability to learn and progress?

SAN DE (CONT'D)

You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I

thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight

with the ways of the temple, the battle is within

yourself.

DREW

Within myself?

SAN DE

You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we

force you out of the temple, you can always blame the

temple for your failure  it never has to be your fault.

(beat)

Life without committment is no life at all.

DREW

What if I can't handle it? What if I fail?

SAN DE

Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of

itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every

last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear

failure.

DREW

(after a beat)

Then, it's up to me.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

Yes. Your fellow disciples stood up for you. It's your

turn.

DREW

I don't want to let them down.

SAN DE

Don't let yourself down.

GAO

Are you staying?

DREW

Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of

trouble!

LI

Drew! Are you allright?

DREW

Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I

got to the temple, some nut has been attacking me with a

stick  at night, in the toilet... anywhere! It's driving

me crazy...

DREW (CONT'D)

What? Honest, it's happening! I...

GAO

Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential

is singled out for special training. We were wondering

who it was... now, we know.

DREW

Special training? You mean...?

DREW

Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I

will... miss you and remember you... always.

ASHEMA

Are they making you do this?

DREW

No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...

D.S.

Using your muscles, bend my arm.

GAO

What if I hurt him?

D.S.

You will not.

D.S.

Grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance.

D.S. (CONT'D)

Master Shu's spirit is indeed strong.

D.S.

Try to hit me here with your feet.

DREW

With pleasure.

DREW

Allright! I did it!

DREW

(bowing)

Boy, his spirit is strong...

SAN DE

Go long.

GAO

I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream!

After all the trouble you got into...

LI

Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that

kind of thing...

DREW

I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still

carrying her?

DREW

Lucky shot, slant eye!

GAO

You stink, American!

DREW

That's it! You're dead meat!

DREW (CONT'D)

Saved by the bell...

GAO

I had you...

D.S.

San De wants to see you, in his chambers.

DREW

I wonder what you did now...

SAN DE

You are to deliver this scroll to the Arhat living on the

Jade Mountain. This is your quest. The scroll that is in

this box is more precious than life. Guard it well.

DREW

I will, Master.

SAN DE

If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most

advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you

wish, and he must answer it.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

This map will lead you to the Jade Mountain. Let nothing

deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll. You leave

first thing tomorrow morning.

(beat)

You must return within three day... or don't bother to

return at all.

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

OK, boys, just let me get my glass and...

DREW (CONT'D)

(to himself)

This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more

painful, than it looks!

DREW (CONT'D)

Oh, I don't think so...

DREW

No, don't do that!

WOMAN

Why not?

DREW

I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain...

WOMAN

No one will know...

DREW

I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please.

DREW (CONT'D)

Nice throw...

DREW (CONT'D)

Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream

come true, I can't!

DREW (CONT'D)

Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with

you.

TOURIST 1

Not another temple!

TOURIST 2

Do they have a gift shop?

TOURIST 3

Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'?

GUIDE

You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.

TOURIST 1

A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!

DREW

Oh Mi Two Fwo

GUIDE (O.S.)

Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a

different world.

DREW

I'll say...

DREW

Just like at the temple...

DREW

Is this rope strong enough for both of us?

DREW (CONT'D)

OK, OK, I'm going!

DREW (CONT'D)

Hold on...

SAN DE (O.S.)

The scroll that is in this box is more precious than

life. Guard it well.

DREW

What the heck...

DREW

What am I going to tell the arhat?

DREW

Maybe he won't miss one little scroll...

DREW

Master! I apologize, I did not see you.

DREW (CONT'D)

I failed, Master. A person was in danger...

DREW (CONT'D)

Of course, you're right. No excuses...

DREW (CONT'D)

You have it? How?

DREW (CONT'D)

So, I didn't fail, huh?

(beat)

I can ask my question, then?

DREW (CONT'D)

What is the meaning of life?

ARHAT

What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.

DREW

(smiling ruefully)

I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning

of life.

ARHAT

For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest

to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.

DREW

No. American.

ARHAT

I notice the littlest details.

DREW

How many succeeded?

ARHAT

A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious

than human life.

DREW

But, I didn't obey.

ARHAT

(smiling slightly)

At the beginning of your training, you were to obey

without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must

learn to question everything, and obey yourself.

DISSOLVE TO:

DREW

I have to leave. What is the easiest way to get back to

the temple.

ARHAT

The bus.

ARHAT (CONT'D)

Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the

temple.

DREW

Thank you, Master.

ARHAT

They should give you a bus schedule with that map...

DREW

We've got to rebuild this?

D.S.

No.

(beat)

Tear it down.

SAN DE

Only one trial remains before you become full fledged

fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

I warn you all, any monk who fails must leave the temple

forever, and will NEVER be called Shaolin.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

Disciple Drew Carson, as you will return to America, and

never intended to live as a monk in the temple, you need

not enter the chamber.

DREW

Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?

DREW (CONT'D)

Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore, I request

that I be the first one through.

SAN DE

(very proud)

Your request is granted.

DREW (CONT'D)

What did you do that for?

D.S.

My last chance  when you come out the other side, we

will be equals.

DREW

(whispering)

I can't do it.

D.S.

There is no can't, only won't.

DREW (CONT'D)

I am a Shaolin monk.

DREW (CONT'D)

Not this time.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAN DE

You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as

fighting monks...

CUT TO:

SAN DE

Congratulations.

DREW

I wouldn't have made it through without you.

(beat)

You once asked why I came here, why did you let me in?

SAN DE

Do you remember the story you heard about the monk who

would not leave?

DREW

Yes.

SAN DE

That monk was me.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

I would like to ask a favor.

DREW

Anything.

SAN DE

Before you leave for American, can you help at an

international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple

has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over

the world  I'd like you to be there.

DREW

No problem.

(he smiles)

Without pause.

SAN DE

Now, a friend would like to see you.

(beat)

... alone.

DREW

Are we late?

SAN DE

The fight has not yet started.

DREW

Did you think he would get into the finals?

SAN DE

Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western

countries, which is why I wanted you here.

DREW

I'll help any way I can.

TREVOR

Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way

around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the

city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being

a monk!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

(to San De)

He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew.

(he looks at Ashema)

If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after

this fight, 'Kay?

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Wish me luck, huh?

TREVOR (CONT'D)

I'M NOT DONE!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

I want HIM!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I

want to learn at the hands of a master!

TREVOR (CONT'D)

I want the American Shaolin!

DREW

I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You

humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never

happen again.

TREVOR

So, let's see what you've learned.

DREW

(shaking his head)

I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating

you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be

defeated, not you.

TREVOR (CONT'D)

Bull! You're just chicken!

DREW

The arts should never be about who is best  they are too

important for that.

TREVOR

COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!

SAN DE

Do you turn away from him out of fear?

TREVOR

I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!

Look at him  he is too scared to face me!

DREW

No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for

my ego.

SAN DE

You have learned much.

TREVOR

The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!

SAN DE

You did the right thing.

TREVOR

How about you, baldy? Or you?

GAO

Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the

fighting monks.

SAN DE

(looking at drew)

What should be done?

GAO (CONT'D)

Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of

the temple.

SAN DE

There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some

people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.

SAN DE (CONT'D)

It's your call.

DREW

For the temple...

TREVOR

Remember last time, punk?

DREW

Nothing exists but the moment, and...

(beat)

... I'm going to enjoy it.

TREVOR

Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!

FADE OUT
