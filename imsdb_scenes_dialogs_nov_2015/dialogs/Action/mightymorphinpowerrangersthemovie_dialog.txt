FADE IN:

BLACK SCREEN

Words SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE.

VOICE

In a time of great strife, a

legendary interdimensional being

known as Zordon, came to the city

of Angel Grove to establish a

vanguard in the never ending

struggle against evil.  with the

aid of his trusted assistant,

Alpha 5, the noble master sought

out six extraordinary teenagers

and gave them the power to

transform into an unstoppable

fighting force.  In time of great

need, the young heroes could now

call upon colossal assault

vehicles known as "Zords".  while

the identity of the six remained

a guarded secret, their

courageous exploits soon became

the stuff of Legend, earning them

the title...  The Mighty Morphin

Power Rangers.

ROCKY

CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2

Whadda you figure it is?!

CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1

Hey, ya got me.

CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  # 1

... I'll be damned.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1

AHHHHHHHHH!

REPORTER

We're here at the World Center

Construction Site, where a

mysterious object was just

uncovered in a freak accident in

which one workman suffered minor

injuries...

12

REPORTER

... Angel Grove Police have

cordoned off the area until it

can be determined whether or not

the unidentified object poses any

threat.  The injured workman was

quoted as saying...

TOMMY

It's one smooth move and then

you've gotta explode off the top.

TOMMY

Nice and easy.

ERNIE

Hey, no Karate on the patio!

FRED

Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan

Doe.

ERNIE

Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place

else.

ERNIE

So, what're the plans for the

weekend?

KIMBERLY

Aisha and.I are checking out a

new dance spot.

AISHA

I heard that!

BILLY

I'll be at the Observatory

Sunday.

ERNIE

That's right - Ryan's Comet.

ROCKY

We should throw a little comet

shindig.

ADAM

Any excuse for a party.

AISHA

The Eagle has landed.

BULK

The earth was hurtling toward us

at seven hundred miles per hour,

and we knew at that moment that

we were facing death straight in

the eye.

SKULL

We could smell it's breath.

ROCKY

There's a spot over there.

TOMMY (into  communicator)

What's up, Alpha?

ALPHA 5 (V.O.)

Rangers, we need you at the

Command  Center,  L.R.N. !

KIMBERLY

'Like Right Now.'

TOMMY

We're on our way.

TOMMY

What's happening?

ALPHA 5

Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our

thermionic-sensors have been hit

by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!

ZORDON

Rangers, you must act swiftly.

The planet is in GRAVE danger!

KIMBERLY

Danger from what?

ZORDON

Six thousand years ago a

morphological being known as Ivan

Ooze, ruled the world with a

reign of unparalleled terror.

Finally, a rebel factor known as

the "Order of the Meledon" lured

him into a hyperlock chamber and

buried him deep underground.

ALPHA 5

In a place that came to be known

as Angel Grove.

ZORDON

The chamber has been accidently

UNCOVERED!  You must return it to

the depths. or  anyone should

open it and Ivan is released!

ALPHA 5

To assist you I have retro-fitted

your helmets with new Opti-Scan

devices.

ZORDON

Use extreme caution, Rangers.

You are dealing with an evil here

that is beyond ALL comprehension.

RITA

Another Saturday night and I'm

traipsing around the galaxy with

the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother

warned me this would happen!

Rita, she said, after 89

marriages you might wanna think

about throwing in the towel.  Why

didn't I listen to her?!

ZEDD

That's a good question.

FIRST SECURITY GUARD

Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna

take a look at this.

ZEDD

No need to wake him.  In fact,

why don't you take a little nap

yourself.

MORDANT

Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!

ZEDD

After two thousand years of

searching...  I have finally

found you.

MORDANT

Yo, earth to Bigfoot!

GOLDAR

Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!

ZEDD

SILENCE!

RITA (to  Goldar)

Where did you FIND this rabid

little rodent, anyway?!

GOLDAR

Mordant's my second cousin three

times removed on my mother's

side.  He`s just visiting for the

summer.

RITA

Well put a muzzle on him!

RITA

What... you spent two thousand

years looking for this tub of

SNOT!

ZEDD

Don't you ever have anything nice

to say?!

RITA

Well, if I did I certainly

wouldn't say it to you!

MORDANT

Boss.

ZEDD

For your information this is not

just your average, run-of-the-

mill tub of snot !

RITA

You're trying to tell me there`re

different levels of snot?!

MORDANT

Boss.

ZEDD

WHAT!

IVAN

Ahhhhhhhh.

IVAN

Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE

is back!!

RITA

He's so cute.

ZEDD

I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of

all that is good and decent.  It

is a supreme honor to finally

meet you.

IVAN

How can I ever repay you?

ZEDD

Do you recall the name...  Zordon

of Eltare?

MORDANT

Seems to ring a bell.

ZEDD

I want you to destroy Zordon, so

that my evil may once again reign

SUPREME.

IVAN (hissing)

I will not only destroy him, I

will OBLITERATE his entire being.

It will be like Zordon

of Eltare never EXISTED!

RITA

Finally, a real man.

GOLDAR

Here's his address.

IVAN (reading)

"... left off Interstate 12?!"

(puzzled)

What's an "interstate"?

MORDANT

It's like a freeway.  How long

have  you  been  locked  up? !

ZEDD

We shall leave you to weave your

wicked ways.

RITA

Now we go out on the town.  First

dinner, then dancing, then --

IVAN

What is that odious stench?

IVAN

Smell's like...   TEENAGERS!

BILLY

Remind me to have a word with

Alpha about his teleporting

calculations.

AISHA

Anybody see anything?

TOMMY

... Let's take a look over there.

ROCKY (alarmed)

It looks like it's been opened!

SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}

Hey!

SECURITY GUARD

You had me scared there.

AISHA

Makes two of us.

KIMBERLY

You haven't by any chance seen

a ... morphological being lurking

around?

SECURITY GUARD

The only thing I've seen is you

teenagers.

(beat)

And you know... if there's one

thing in the world I reeeeally

hate....

IVAN

It's TEENAGERS

KIMBERLY

GroSS!

IVAN

You're too kind.  Allow me to

introduce myself.  I am the

infamous, world-reviled,

universally despised, IVAN OOZE!

ROCKY

Well, pack your bags cause we're

sending you back where you came

from!

IVAN

Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.

Not much has changed in six

thousand years.

KIMBERLY

we're not just teenagers, raisin-

head.

TOMMY

We're the Mighty Morphin Power

Rangers!

IVAN

Ooooh, where's my autoqraph

book?.

IVAN

Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is

still using a bunch of rug-rats

to do his dirty work.  And

speaking of rats...

IVAN

From this moment forth, the world

as you know it SHALL CEASE TO

EXIST!

IVAN

WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!

ROCKY

He's  gone.

ADAM

Let's take these beasts!!

ZORDON

Alpha, my sensors tell me the

Rangers were too late!  Ivan is

on his way here!

ALPHA 5

Hey, NOBODY enters the Command

Center without a power coin!

ALPHA 5

Well...  ALMOST nobody.

IVAN

Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I

guess if you invest your money

well over SIXTY centuries you can

buy something pretty nice.

ALPHA 5

HI ,  YAH !

ALPHA  5

Welcome to Wiener World.  May I

take your order, please?

ZORDON

You haven't changed, Ooze.

You're still picking on creatures

smaller than yourself.

IVAN

Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten

minutes out of the egg and I'm

already listening to one of your

lectures.

(he explodes furiously)

You robbed me of my PRIME!  I was

the Supreme Ruler of the most

foul Empire in the Universe.  I

was the King of Calamity.  The

Duke of Destruction.  The big man

on campus!

(beat)

And then you came along.  You

locked me into your stuffy little

hyperlock-chamber and tossed me

into the depths like yesterdays

TRASH!

ZORDON

It worked for six thousand years.

IVAN

Don't remind me!

IVAN

Do you have any idea what it's

like to be cooped up in a rotten

egg for six thousand years?  It's

BORING!  Not to mention I've had

a Charlie horse since the

Renaissance!  But now the tables

are turned.  Now...

IVAN

... it's time to pay the PIPER!

IVAN

Oh, the things that I have

missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!

IVAN

The SPANISH INQUISITION!

(another bolt)

The  70's!

IVAN

And now, finally, I have the

strength to DESTROY your pathetic

powers FOREVER!!

ZORDON

YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!

IVAN

I've got a NEWS flash for you

LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!

ALPHA 5

You put your left probe in, you

put your left probe out, you put

your left probe in and you shake

it all about.  You do the hokey-

pokey and you turn yourself

around...

KIMBERLY

RAT breath!!

KIMBERLY

Somebody needs a shave.

TOMMY

IT'S MORPHIN TIME!

KIMBERLY

PTERODACTYL!

BILLY

TRICERATOPS!

ROCKY

TYRANNOSAURUS!

ADAM

MASTODON!

AISHA

SABER TOOTH TIGER!

TOMMY

WHITE TIGER!

RANGERS

MORPHENOMENAL!

TOMMY

Let's teach these vermin a few

manners.

AISHA

Activating Power Beam!

KIMBERLY

Everybody stay alert.

ADAM

Hold it...

ADAM (pointing)

I heard something over there.

BILLY

Activating Audio Enhancer!

BILLY

They're on the other side of that

wall.

TOMMY

Anybody see them?

ROCKY

Activating Power Scope!

ROCKY

THEY'RE ABOVE US!!

AISHA

Hey, handsome!

AISHA

My mistake.

TOMMY

SABA SABER?

SABA (yawning)

What a DREAM I was having!

TOMMY

We've got company.

SABA

Rats!  I hate rats!

ADAM

Bad move, Willard!

ADAM

STEGA-STINGER!

ADAM

Coming through!

ADAM

Target Neutralized?

KIMBERLY

Raptor-Ribbon!

KIMBERLY

Now you see `em.

KIMBERLY

Now you don't.

BILLY

Not the brightest of beasts.

SABA

Na na na na na!

SABA

Fried mice, anyone?

KIMBERLY

What's going on?!

BILLY

Alpha, come in!

TOMMY

We'd better get back.

AISHA (worried)

Something's wrong!

TOMMY

Come on, guys...

TOMMY (barely audible)

... what happened here?...

ADAM

Guys!

BILLY

Alpha, are you okay?!

ALPHA 5

I'll GET you my pretty, and your

little DOG toa!!

BILLY

He must've blown an anitromic

demodulator!

KIMBERLY (stunned)

Oh, no...

AISHA

... What's happening to him?'

BILLY

Outside of his time warp he's

aging at a vastly acellerated

rate!

KIMBERLY

We have to help him!

ZORDON

...  Rangers... thank goodness

you're safe.

TOMMY

We have to get you back inside

your time warp.

ZORDON

I'm afraid that's impossible...

The power has been destroyed.

It's gone... The Zords, the

weapons...  all of it.

(beat)

The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers

are no more.

KIMBERLY

Zordon... you can't leave us.

Ever since you came into our

lives... you've been like another

father `to  us  all.-

ZORDON

... You must be strong... Ivan

almost overthrew the planet

once...  and now I'm afraid he

has the strength to see his

scheme through.

BILLY

what're we going to do?

ALPHA 5

I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!

I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

ALPHA 5

Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!

ALPHA 5

Thanks, Billy.

ADAM

There has to be something we can

do.

TOMMY

Come on, guys, think!

AISHA

Alpha.  Is there any way we can

defeat this  monster?  Any way at

all?

ALPHA 5

... Perhaps there is a way... I

have heard tales of another

power.

ADAM

What?!

ALPHA 5

... They say that somewhere

beyond the Hyperion Constellation

there exists a mythological power

that is beyond all comprehension.

TOMMY

How can we get to it?

ALPHA 5

As the legend goes, the power is

impossible to obtain.

ROCKY

We have to try, Alpha.  It's our

only hope.

ALPHA 5

It's far too dangerous.  Zordon

would never allow it.

AISHA

If we don't try, Zordon won't

survive!

ADAM

If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped,

nobody will survive.

ALPHA 5

Ay, yi, yi, yi.

(beat)

The legend speaks of a Master

Warrior who lives on the planet

Phaedos... This is the only

person who knows the secrets of

the power.

AISHA

How can we reach Phaedos?

ALPHA 5

Zordon's going to have my

orbicular spheroids when he hears

out about this!

ALPHA 5

This is an emergency reserve of

morphonic emissions.  It should

be enough to get -you there.

ALPHA 5

There is one problem.  I only

have enough reserve to send you

Phaedos...  I can't bring you

back.

ADAM

So how do we get back?

ALPHA 5

... You'll have to pray that the

legends are true.

ALPHA 5

You're sure you want to do this?!

The Rangers share purposeful looks.

TOMMY

It's our only hope.

ALPHA

Safe journey, Rangers!

ALPHA  5

BE CAREFUL!!

ALPHA 5

Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!!

RITA (outraged)

How could he let them slip

through his hands?!  He's no

better than the rest of the hired

help around here!

GOLDAR

According to the TX Tracker,

they're headed for Phaedos.

ZEDD

I'm gonna fire that slimeball so

fast his not gonna know what hit

him!

IVAN

Hi, honey, I'm home !

RITA

You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN!

The Rangers are going after the

Great Power

(to  Zedd)

I thought you said this guy was

the Master of Disaster?

(to  Ivan)

He's nothing but a slime-

infested, jelly-bellied blob of --

RITA

Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!

ZEDD

How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up

Rita but me!

IVAN

Sorry, slick, there's been a

slight'change of plans.

(arms out in trademark stance)

The "booger man" is taking over.

ZEDD

Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd

and lives!

MORDANT

Zedd's gonna kick this snotball

into next week!

IVAN

Ooooh, that tickles!

IVAN

My turn.

RITA

This is all your fault!  If you'd

taken me out tonight like you

were suposed to, none of this

would've happened.

IVAN

Now you have a choice, either

serve me, or join those

insufferable cheesedongs.

GOLDAR

We never liked the cheesedongs in

the first place.

MORDANT

Couldn''t stand them -- low-class

all the way.  And did you catch

a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's

like having a conversation with

a couple of ONIONS!  Not to

mention...

GOLDAR (apologetic)

He's just visiting for the

summer.

(beat)

Now what about,the Rangers, oh

hideous one?

IVAN

Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!

MORDANT

Gasunteidt.

IVAN

SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!

IVAN

Tengu Warriors, you will fly to

Phaedos, find the Power

Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART!

IVAN

Mordant, go with them and report

back to me!

MORDANT

You know boss, I'd really like to

help out but I've got this

gastronomic condition which rules

out all space trave--

MORDANT

IIIIIII!!!

ZEDD

Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We

finally do somebody a good turn

and just look what happens!

RITA

From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO

exceptions!

RITA (optional line)

It just goes to show, ya never go

into business with a booger.

MORDANT

Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!

TOMMY

Everybody okay?

KIMBERLY

Where' s  BILLY? !

ALPHA 5

Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary

transistors have malfunctioned!

ALPHA  5

Why you low-frequency, battery

operated --

BILLY

WHOAAAAAAHHHH!!!

AISHA

BILLY!!

KIMBERLY

You okay?

BILLY

I think so.

BILLY

This puddle thing is really

getting on my nerves.

AISHA

Welcome to beautiful downtown

Phaedos.

ROCKY

... Incredible...

TOMMY

Let's see if we can find this

Master warrior.

IVAN

Taking over the world is one

thing.  It's finding good help to

run it for you that's the killer.

GOLDAR

You want me to place a few calls?

IVAN

No need.   I'm going to use the

young minds of Angel Grove.

GOLDAR

No offense, boss, but they might

find you a little disgusting.

IVAN

Yes, well, I suppose you'd know

a little something about that.

(beat)

Not to worry.  I'll ever so

gently lure them in and mold them

into an army of devils!  And what

better way to entice them ...

than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

GOLDAR

But boss, what about their

parents?

IVAN

Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm

going to SCOURGE their puny

minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S.

And then I'll put them to work

rebuilding my empire.

SKULL

I understand you're looking for

a few new assistants.

BULK

Well put your mind to rest `cause

now you've got the best.

IVAN

What is this?!  I advertised for

brilliant and good looking

assistants!

SKULL

Hi, I'm brilliant.

BULK (hand extended)

And I'm good looking.

IVAN

And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.

SKULL

Bulk... why don't we give Mr.

Peep here a chance to think it

over?

BULK

A stellar idea, Skull.

IVAN

Not so fast, greaseballs.

IVAN

You'll have to do.

TOMMY

Hey.

TOMMY

You okay?

KIMBERLY

I was just thinking about

Zordon...  everything we've been

through together.

AISHA

You know, meeting Zordon...

teaming up with you guys, it's

the best thing that's ever

happened to me.

ROCKY

It's the best thing that's ever

happened to all of us.

ADAM

... He's gonna make it, guys.

TOMMY

We'll get this warrior...  save

Zordon...  and send that

SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the

SEWER he crawled out of.

ROCKY

TAKE COVER!

KIMBERLY

THEY'RE T00 STRONG??

ADAM

WE NEED OUR POWERS!!

MORDANT

WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM!

MORDANT

#0!@!#!

TOMMY

HANG ON, KIMBERLY.

MORDANT

What's the matter with you

woodpeckers!  Take this guy out!

MORDANT

The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The

Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!

MORDANT

Hey, aren't you bird-brains

forgetting something?!

MORDANT

Watch the meathooks!!

KIMBERLY

Wow!  That was amazing for such

a little dude!

FIGURE

You're trespassing.

(beat)

Now state your business.

TOMMY

We're looking for the Master

Warrior.  Do you know where we

can find him?

FIGURE

The Master Warrior doesn't

entertain visitors  -

KIMBERLY

But we have to find him.  Our

leader Zordon is dying.

FIGURE

Zordon?

DULCEA

How did this happen?!

KIMBERLY

The lady asked you a question.

TOMMY

Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah...

KIMBERLY

He was attacked by this horrific

being -- Ivan Ooze.

DULCEA

Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all

in mortal danger!

DULCEA

Let' s go.

AISHA

Kind of bossy, isn't she?

IVAN

Boys and girls, girls and boys,

gather round and feast your eyes.

This ain't sludge and this ain't

guck... this is the one and only

Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's

ooey, gooey and even kind of

chewy.  But best of all it's

FREE!

BULK

Here you go!  No pushing!

SKULL

There's enough for everybody!

FRED

So where'd this guy come from?

SKULL

Uh... that's classified, top

secret, confidential, undercover

information.

BULK

If we told you -- we'd have to

kill you.

SKULL

INCOMING!

WIZARD

Come on, come all -- it's an COZE

FREE FOR ALL!

AISHA

Is this... food!

DULCEA

They're called squirbs.

KIMBERLY

Mine seems to be a little

undercooked.

DULCEA

Add a few dried weevils and

you'll never know the difference.

BILLY

... Not bad.

TOMMY

Listen, we appreciate your

hospitality, but we really don't

have much time.

DULCEA

What do you know of the Great

Power?

KIMBERLY

Only that we need it to defeat

Ivan Ooze.

DULCEA

It is said that to those who

possess the Power... all things

are possible.

BILLY

Where did it originate?

DULCEA

In another time, another

dimension.  It was brought here

long ago by the "Nathadians", a

people who are now all but

extinct.

They built an impenetrable stone

Monolith to store the power and

keep it from their enemies.

(ominous)

For thousands of years, beings

from all over the Universe have

tried to obtain it... ALL have

perished.

AISHA

So how can we get to it?

DULCEA

The only way to obtain the power

is to achieve the highest state

of being...

TOMMY

And how do we do that?

DULCEA

By learning the ancient art of

Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of

what you on earth have come to

know as the Ninja.

(beat)

It is the perfect union of mind,

body and spirit.

ROCKY

Look, Zordon doesn't have much

longer to live.  And for all we

know, Angel Grove could already

be under attack.  We don't have

TIME for this.

DULCEA

You don't understand.  If you do

not have the Ninjetti, the power

will destroy  you.

(beat)

To reach the Monolith we must

traverse the Neola jungle.  We

will train today, and set out on

foot tomorrow.

SNOGGLE

HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH

GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!

DULCEA

Snoggle, you watch your language!

SNOGGLE

Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?

AISHA

Excuse me?

SNOGGLE

Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?

DULCEA

He wants to know if you'd like a

cube of sugar in your tea.

AISHA

Ah... sure.

AISHA

Ah... thanks.

BILLY

... Not bad.

DULCEA

In the language of the

Nathadians, "Nin" stands for

"man", "jetti" stands for

"animal".  Ninjetti  - man and

animal, together as one.

(beat)

Now, put your hands inside the

flame.

AISHA

Yeah, right.

DULCEA

It will not harm you.

AISHA

Just kidding.

AISHA

Wow.  Sand.

DULCEA

Now tell me... what do you see?

AISHA (bedazzled)

I see... a bear

DULCEA

Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart

and bold.

AISHA

Stylin'!

ROCKY

I see... an Ape.

DULCEA

Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.

BILLY

I see... a fox

DULCEA

Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf,

cunning and swift.

KIMBERLY

I think its some kind of bird.

DULCEA

Kimberly, you are the Crane,

agile and sublime.

ADAM

That's gotta be a frog.

DULCEA

Adam, you are the Frog, quick as

lightning.

TOMMY

It's... an eagle?

DULCEA

Look closer.

TOMMY

... A falcon?

DULCEA

Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged

Lord of the Sky.

KIMBERLY

How do you know so much about the

Ninjetti?

DULCEA

I... am the sole living

descendant of the "Nathadians".

(beat)

Now prepare yourselves for the

most intense physical and mental

training known to man and animal.

FRED

Dad... ??!

FRED

DAD?!

KID #1

You seen my parents?

FRED

I can't find my dad either.

KID #2

What's going on?!

WILD KID

Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!

FRED

That guy was the student body

President

DULCEA

The crane maintains it's agility

through the perfect harmony of

mind, body and spirit.

KIMBERLY

Awesome!

KIMBERLY

Let's see you do it .

SNOGGLE (indignant)

Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.

DULCEA

Snoggle, we don't have time for

you to show off

DULCEA

The ape is strong, but more

importantly it is flexible and

free.

ROCKY

Who is this lady?

ROCKY

Here goes!

DULCEA

The wolf relies on it's enhanced

senses to guide it...  He can

hear what we cannot hear, he can

smell what we cannot smell.

DULCEA

The frog remains still and silent

while it assesses its target...

then strikes out in the blink of

an eye.

ADAM

Show off.

DULCEA

The bear is sturdy as a towering

tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

AISHA

Girl, you've got to be kidding

me.

DULCEA

The falcon never struggles with

the air, but rather becomes one

with it.

DULCEA (calling out)

JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!

TOMMY

You can do this.  You can do

this.  You can do this...

ZORDON

... Alpha, I am deeply concerned

about the Rangers...

ALPHA 5

I told them it was too dangerous,

but they wouldn't listen.

ZORDON

... We must try to communicate

with them.

ALPHA 5

Perhaps if I could locate a

vertical-deflector then I could

assemble a holographic-comlink.

ALPHA

Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .

DULCEA

Each of you must reach deep

within and draw upon your natural

instincts...  Only then will you

know the way of the Ninjetti.

(beat)

Rest for a few hours.  We will

continue at daybreak.

KIMBERLY

So where are we supposed to

sleep?

SNOGGLE

Buhph nghujr.

KIMBERLY

That guy's cruisin' for a

bruisin'.

BILLY

I can hardly walk...

AISHA

I've never been this sore in my

life.

BILLY

Do you guys really think we can

pull this off?

ADAM

Maybe if we had more time.

TOMMY

... I wonder... We've been

relying on our Morphin Powers for

so long... maybe we've forgotten

how to rely on ourselves.

TOMMY

We should get some rest.

IVAN

Ladies and gentlemen, Simon

says...  STOP!

IVAN

Simon says... stand on one foot!

IVAN

Simon says...

GOLDAR

Quack like a'duck!

GOLDAR

It just slipped out.

IVAN

SHUT UP!!

GOLDAR

You didn't say "Simon says".

IVAN (irritated)

Simon says SHUT UP!!!

Now, as soon as I give the word

I want all of you to start

digging.

(beat)

Do I make myself perfectly --

IVAN

This is the Iast time I use

parents for anything!

IVAN

Let's pick it up here!  I've got

a schedule to keep.  In twenty

four hours the ooze is gonna hit

the fan!

GOLDAR

Hey, boss!

MORDANT

What kind of landing was that?!

These clowns are a menace to the

sky

IVAN

How did you fare?

MORDANT

Oh, it couldn't've gone better.

The Power Rangers didn't know

what hit them .

MORDANT

That's right.  And then we threw

one of them off a mountain and

another one into a raqing river!

IVAN

So they've been destroyed?

MORDANT

"Basically".

IVAN

What do you mean "basically"?

MORDANT

Well... we were about to finish

them off... when this huge

monster came out of nowhere!

MORDANT

Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.

But you should've seen the size

of his STICKS

IVAN

Did these sticks make a whistling

sound?

MORDANT

How'd you know?

IVAN

Dulcea!

(beat)

That miserable, manipulating

loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

IVAN

How could you let them get away?!

If Dulcea leads them to the Great

Power, everything will be ruined!

They must be OBLITERATED!

MORDANT

What're you talking about?!  It

wasn't my fault!  You're the

featherbrains that let them get

away!

IVAN

I call upon the Powers of

Darkness to enrich the evil of my

creatures by tenfold!

IVAN

And now the coup de grace, to

lead my tribe to victorious

battle!

MORDANT

Where does he come up with this

stuff?

IVAN

Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors

to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON

THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME

DULCEA!

SNOGGLE

BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!!

TOMMY

How the heck?!...

ROCKY

What's going on?!

KIMBERLY

I don't believe it!

DULCEA

You have been visited by the

animal spirits... they have given

you their blessing.

Finally. a little appreciation

where it's deserved.

CROWD

NOT US!

IVAN

AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN

RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE

UNIVERSE?!

CROWD

FRED

Can I have a word with you guys?

(he pulls them aside)

What's really going on here?!

Where are everybody's parents?

SKULL

Like we said before, that's

classified, top secret...

FRED

Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a

load of garbage all over them.

BULK

Well, why didn't you say so?!

SKULL

They're at the World Center

Construction Site.

FRED

Uh.   OOZE RULES!

BULK AND SKULL

OOZE  RULES !

TOMMY

Dulcea... how do you and Zordon

know each other?

DULCEA

We belonged to an interstellar

Peace Keeping Force known as the

"Order of the Meledan".

(beat)

Zordon was widely regarded as the

finest Commander in the Galaxy.

He was a true Legend... If it

wasn't for him, the Universe

would be a very different place

from what it is today.

ROCKY

So...  what happened?

DULCEA

Over time our enemies were

defeated...  I returned to

Phaedos, Zordon moved on to

continue the struggle elsewhere.

(beat)

Until you kids showed up, I

hadn't heard from him for

centuries.

DULCEA

He was always an inspiration...

DULCEA

This is why I'm taking you to the

Nathadian Monolith.  That is why

I'm teaching you the Ninjetti.

(beat)

If Zordon dies... then a piece of

all of us dies... and the force

of good within the Universe will

be dealt an irreparable blow.

MORDANT

As soon as we've taken over the

world I'm gonna change my name to

Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR

Mordant?!

GOLDAR

How about Major Moron?

IVAN

How about the two of you shut Up

and pay attention!!

MORDANT

What is THAT!

IVAN

Feast your eyes upon the

exoskeleton of the barbaric

HORNITOR!

(to parents)

KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL

SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.

(beat)

ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON

MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL

ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND

THEN... THE WORLD

FRED

Dad...?!

FRED

We have to get out of here!

MR. KELMAN

Dig... dig... dig...

FRED

Dad?!... It's me, Fred!

MR. KELMAN

Dig... dig... dig...

MORDANT (O.S.)

Gotchya!

MORDANT

Just shut your gap!

GOLDAR

Did I say anything?

ALPHA 5

By bouncing ultra-high

frequencies off one of the

network satellites, I can send a

long-range pulsar signal to

ZORDON

(with difficulty)

... I just pray we're not too

late.

ALPHA 5

Let's give it a whirl.

REPORTER

Angel Grove Police have been

fielding hundreds of calls from

concerned citizens as the number

of missing gersons continues to

IVAN

Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.

ALPHA 5

Well, come on down to Ooze City

and LET'S GET STICKY!

DULCEA

The Monolith is there in the

distance.

DULCEA

This is as far as I can take you.

KIMBERLY

You're leaving us?!

DULCEA

I have taught you all that I

know.   Now you must achieve the

Ninjetti on your own.

DULCEA

It is said that once you've

reached the power... you have

only ten triacs to release it.

BILLY

What's a Triac?

DULCEA

About twenty seconds in your

time.

TOMMY

And how do we release the power?

DULCEA

The legend goes that you release

the power with the power.

ADAM

What does that mean!

DULCEA

That is a question that even I

cannot answer.

(beat)

Remember, ten triacs.  After that

something bad will happen.

KIMBERLY

Like...how bad?

DULCEA

They say the power will throw off

a super-heated, radioactive

fireball, instantly reducing you

to ash and bits of charred bone.

AISHA

That's pretty bad.

TOMMY

Thank you, Dulcea.  For

everything.

DULCEA

May your animals watch over you.

Finally, after centuries of

waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon

GOLDAR

You forgot to say 'Simon says."

KIMBERLY

Man, these are the last guys I

wanted to see.

AISHA

BILLY

That's the only way to the

Monolith...

ROCKY

The frog silently assesses its

target, then strikes out...

lucky.

BILLY

There should be a way to open it.

BILLY

ROCKY

Release the power with the power.

AISHA

Not that kind of power.

BILLY

we're missing.

ROCKY

It can't end like this...

KIMBERLY
