THE LOSERS

Written by

Peter Berg & James Vanderbilt

February 2007

FADE IN ON:

MAN (O.S.)

No... please... There's no way...

MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Nothing... can defeat...

MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Gojira.

MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me

love you long time!

SECOND MAN (O.S.)

C'mon Jensen, you in or not?

JENSEN

And get cheated again?

POOCH

The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch

may lie, the Pooch may steal--

2.

JENSEN

--the Pooch may refer to himself

in the third person--

POOCH

--but the Pooch will not cheat.

JENSEN

The Pooch can rest easy, I was

referring to Cougar.

ROQUE (O.S.)

It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in

the hell is the man gonna cheat

you at Liar's Poker?

ROQUE

Cards.

JENSEN

Got a feeling about this one, Roque.

ROQUE

Your mama had that feeling too.

3.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

Raise you.

POOCH

(INTRIGUED)

That the one with the hollow points?

ROQUE

Yup.

POOCH

Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.

JENSEN

This even me up?

ROQUE

Exactly how many knives do you

have, anyway?

POOCH

Cougar - your bet.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, losers!

CLAY

It's time...

SMASH TO:

4.

CLAY

Authenticate and backtrace.

POOCH

(GRUMBLING)

Send us out to the middle of nowhere

to "wait for instructions"...

JENSEN

(FINISHES CHECKING)

We're good, this baby came out of

the Kandahar Spook Station,

controller's codename is Max.

ROQUE

(DISTASTE)

This is an Agency gig?

CLAY

We don't get to pick what needs to

be done.

(reading from tablet)

Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is

running a terrorist assembly line

out around the Khyber Pass--

JENSEN

I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.

CLAY

We find it, we paint it for a laser

targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.

ROQUE

For that we had to put on a

blindfold and turn around three

times?

POOCH

You'd rather take on fifty mujas

with AK's?

CUT TO:

5.

ROQUE

I got eyes on Fadhil.

CLAY

Paint it.

POOCH

Call me Michelangelo.

JENSEN

Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed

eyes on, target is designated.

RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

(FILTERED)

Roger, target acquired, exfil

chopper is enroute. ETA to

fireworks is eight minutes.

JENSEN

Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.

(to the others)

So who wants to get a game? We

got eight minutes-

COUGAR

Boss?

6.

CLAY

Call it in.

JENSEN

(INTO RADIO)

Dropkick, children are at target

site, repeat, we have eyes on

children at target site - advise.

RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

Hold the line...

RADIO VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Acknowledged, maintain position.

ROQUE

Maintain position? Colonel-

JENSEN

(INTO RADIO)

Dropkick, we strongly recommend

cancellation of payload delivery-

RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

Abort order can only come from

MISSION CONTROLLER-

CLAY

Mission Controller is Agency,

Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max,

so get him on the horn and-

RADIO VOICE (O.S.)

Already have, Pinball, your orders

stand. Prep for exfil.

CLAY

Cougar?

7.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting

equipment has suffered system

failure, am calling an abort.

MAX (O.S.)

Well, that was stupid.

CLAY

Who is this? This is a secure

MILITARY NETWORK--

MAX (O.S.)

Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin...

Clay.

CLAY

Max? There are children on site-

MAX (O.S.)

And you think I didn't know that?

Not the sharpest of knives in the

drawer, are you? We locked

coordinates the moment you painted;

delivery will occur on schedule.

Max out.

CLAY

Shit! Jensen, call the General at

the Firebase, get him to abort-

JENSEN

Can't, they're jamming us-

ROQUE

Then contact the plane directly-

JENSEN

(trying all channels)

Negative, we're screwed!

(LOOKING UP)

There's nothing we can do...

8.

CLAY

There's something we can do.

ROQUE

Five against a fortress, and we've

got maybe six minutes before an

airstrike sets the world on fire.

CLAY

So?

ROQUE

So, I'll drive.

CUT TO:

POOCH

I guess we're going with the fifty

mujas with AK's option after all!

CLAY

Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for

the kids, the rest of us will be

out in five-

ROQUE

(CHECKING WATCH)

-airstrike's in four and change-

CLAY

-out in four. On me!

9.

LITTLE BOY

CLAY

(to Roque and Cougar)

Get 'em out.

PERVERT

10.

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

...shooooot meeee...

CLAY

You're American?

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

...Max sent you...

CLAY

(SURPRISED)

How do you know that name?

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

...was IA Field Ops hunting rogue

agents... Max caught me...

CLAY

Max is rogue?

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

You're off-mission aren't you?

SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)

What's the mission?

CLAY

Fadhil.

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

Max doesn't care about Fadhil...

He's cleaning up the mess. You're

his mop. I'm the mission....

SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)

Kill me...

CLAY

I can get you out-

11.

SOMETHING HORRIFIC

Already dead... Kill ME-

SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)

Thaaaank...

COUGAR

Mercy.

COUGAR (CONT'D)

Run.

POOCH

Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?

ROQUE

What kind of blast radius we looking

at?

ROQUE (CONT'D)

DRIVE. MUCH. FASTER.

12.

JENSEN

I think we're in the clear-

POOCH

Uh, Coug?

JENSEN

Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?

My favorite part was when we were

completely on fire. What was yours?

POOCH

Exfil incoming. How are we gonna

explain the kids, Colonel?

POOCH (CONT'D)

Colonel?

(Clay looks up)

The kids. What do we tell 'em?

13.

CLAY

Lieutenant, you're to evac these

civvies to the Firebase immediately-

BLACKHAWK PILOT

Negative, our orders are to

transport a five-man team only.

CLAY

You really want to leave twenty

three kids in the desert to die?

BLACKHAWK PILOT

Not enough room for them and you...

CLAY

Then it's them.

JENSEN

OMAR

POOCH

Cute little buggers. Hope they

can make it to our court-martial.

14.

ROQUE

Relax, Pooch, we're not going to

be court-martialed - if anything,

we're going to die of thirst

wandering the desert, right Colonel?

CLAY

(IGNORES THIS)

Jensen, see if you can cut into

that Blackhawk's chatter--I want

to know if he rats us out.

POOCH

So, how we getting back? Hitchhike?

Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...

ROQUE

(NOTICING)

Guess they hustled up some air

support after all - that's a

Pakistani MiG up there...

JENSEN

Guys... This is bad...

MIG PILOT (O.S.)

Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked,

twelve o'clock low...

MAX (O.S.)

Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit.

MIG PILOT (O.S.)

(CALMLY)

Fox One.

15.

POOCH

Auto-rotate, go with it, you can

still put her down if you-

MAX (O.S.)

And again.

CLAY

NO!

MIG PILOT (O.S.)

...Fox Two.

SLAM TO:

FENNEL

What are you talking about "MAX?"

CLAY

He set up the Operation-

FENNEL

There was no operation! You were

never radioed orders!

CLAY

I talked to him!

16.

FENNEL

You kill a friendly Afghan warlord,

probably lose us the support of

half the tribes in the region, and

your alibi is "MAX?"

(PAUSE)

Wait - are you saying you're Max?

CLAY

What?

FENNEL

Colonel, Max is an Agency code for

a rogue agent or operation-

CLAY

What are you talking-

LARGE MAN (O.S.)

There is no specific Max.

WADE

"Max" is catch-all for exactly

what you've been accused of.

Terminology's been around since

the 50's.

CLAY

We didn't kill those kids, Wade.

WADE

I believe you.

FENNEL

Stay here. We'll be back.

POOCH

Wade left his suitcase.

17.

ROQUE

Ah, shit...

CLAY

(nodding to the case)

Jensen?

JENSEN

I'm not good with bombs, man-

CLAY

I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get

those bars off!

JENSEN

Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

CLAY

Time?

JENSEN

It's a remote detonator--enough

for them to get clear, maybe ten

MORE SECONDS-

CLAY

CAN YOU-

JENSEN

I told you, I'm not good with bombs!

How are those bars coming?

POOCH

Hurry...

18.

ROQUE

Shut up.

POOCH

Hurry...

ROQUE

Shut up...

THE LOSERS

FADE UP:

19.

ROQUE

(FLAT)

You lost again.

CLAY

We lost again.

ROQUE

You placed the bet.

CLAY

You gave me the money.

20.

ROQUE

Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't

it?

ROQUE (CONT'D)

That makes, what, three in a row?

CLAY

Four.

ROQUE

You know where you're messing up?

You're putting all our money on

the dogs with the best odds.

CLAY

Yeah, I've just gone crazy with

that approach.

ROQUE

Never play a longshot, you're never

gonna win.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. -

could this get any more sleazy?

CLAY

Maybe if we were drinking.

ROQUE

You're not drinking?

21.

CLAY

We'll stay two more days, try to

get some of the cash back.

ROQUE

Then what?

CLAY

Miami. Jai-Alai.

ROQUE

I can't take much more of this.

CLAY

We're on the run. It occasionally

INVOLVES RUNNING-

ROQUE

I'm serious. Grinding out lunch

money on five dollar sports bets,

wincing everytime some overly Aqua-

netted cow stares at my face for

more than two seconds-

(DELICATELY)

I'm at the point where I'm thinking

we ought to try to reach out to

the Company...

CLAY

All we did was say the word "Max"

and they blew up a building. CIA

even gets a whiff of where we're

at, they'll call in an airstrike.

(shakes his head)

Until we figure out how we can

take Max down and get clear, we

lay low.

ROQUE

Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel

anymore.

CLAY

Anytime you want to move along you

go right ahead-

22.

ROQUE

Like the others? Least I still

talk to them. You pushed them

away. "Max this, Max that" - we

never even saw the guy, Clay-

CLAY

We heard his voice. Guy with a

voice is a guy with a throat. And

if he's got a throat...

ROQUE

(IN DISBELIEF)

We're hiding out in the parking

lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You

actually think we're in any position

to take on some shadowy CIA super-

spook?

CLAY

ROQUE-

ROQUE

No, it's a stellar plan - we can

use this as our base of ops!

(gestures to the

PLAYGROUND)

Pooch can run the motor pool out

of the ball pit and Jensen can set

up communications by the slide!

CLAY

Go.

ROQUE

I was there too. I remember. But

he won. We lost.

(PAUSE)

Maybe it's time for a new game.

23.

PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY

Yabba Dabba Doo...

AISHA

Men.

AISHA (CONT'D)

How's the steak?

CLAY

Meaty.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Want a bite?

AISHA

I don't eat red meat.

CLAY

Why not?

AISHA

Slows me down.

CLAY

Okay.

24.

AISHA

You got nice arms.

CLAY

(turning to her)

I know you?

AISHA

Relax, slugger... I like arms.

That's all.

CLAY

Do I not look relaxed?

AISHA

No.

(PAUSE)

Think we can change that?

SMASH CUT TO:

AISHA

(DEADPAN)

Wow, it's everything a girl could

dream of. Got a bathroom?

CLAY

No, I specifically requested the

only hotel room in the world that

doesn't have a bathroom.

AISHA

You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a

"no" here?

AISHA

So what brings you to Florida?

25.

CLAY

Convention.

AISHA (O.S.)

Convention for what?

CLAY

...Air conditioners.

AISHA

They have whole conventions devoted

to air conditioners?

CLAY

You'd be surprised.

AISHA

Bet I would. Where were we?

CLAY

You were about to tell me how much

you enjoy spending time at the dog

track...

AISHA

Saw me there did you?

CLAY

Uh-huh...

AISHA

Didn't see me at the McDonald's

though...

26.

AISHA (CONT'D)

I have a proposition for you...

AISHA (CONT'D)

Just hear me out. I don't want to

hurt you.

CLAY

You're not going to.

AISHA

Yes, I am.

AISHA (CONT'D)

Room's on fire.

CLAY

Noticed. What do you want?

AISHA

Your life. Back.

CLAY

You want to clarify that?

AISHA

Max. I can help you.

27.

CLAY

I'm listening.

CLAY

How'd you find me?

AISHA

It's not too tough if you know

where to look. You guys aren't

exactly subtle.

CLAY

How'd you know I was alive?

AISHA

Counted the number of teeth found

in the safehouse debris in Karachi.

Not nearly enough for five men.

CLAY

Who else knows?

AISHA

That you're alive? Just me.

CLAY

So what's to stop me from putting

a bullet in your head?

AISHA

You want Max and I can tell you

how to get him.

CLAY

Max is up to something big, isn't

he? Agency wouldn't have sent you

otherwise.

28.

AISHA

Nice try, but I'm working alone

here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't

need your help. Ready for the

important part?

AISHA (CONT'D)

There is a plane.

CLAY

Okay.

AISHA

This plane contains a truck.

CLAY

Okay.

AISHA

This truck contains a cargo.

CLAY

Right.

AISHA

This cargo is very important.

CLAY

Is this a riddle?

AISHA

(FORCED SMILE)

This cargo belongs to Max. You

steal the cargo, Max comes looking

for it, you grab Max.

CLAY

What a brilliant plan, and oh, so

simple too. What's the cargo?

CLAY (CONT'D)

Right. So you want me to steal

some super secret cargo known only

to you and the bad guy, and I'm

supposed to do this because you

know the name Max and look good in

a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.

29.

AISHA

Hey!

(he turns back)

You really think I look good in

these jeans?

CLAY

Bye...

AISHA

Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to

fund his off the books ops. And

it comes straight from the poppy

fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.

(knowing full well)

Oh... does that name mean something

to you?

AISHA (CONT'D)

He used you to kill Fadhil and

take over his operation, that's

right. What did you think you

were doing there in the first place?

Fighting for truth and justice?

CLAY

How do I know I can trust you?

AISHA

Check my background. I'm an ex-

Company hitter. First job was a

junior field officer in Shanghai.

You can Google it under Shanghai

Hilton Decapitation.

CLAY

I mostly Google porn. Then?

AISHA

Two Chinese and an Italian arms

dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.

CLAY

Show-off. Then?

30.

AISHA

Then I stopped auditioning for

you. This is a check for ten grand-

CLAY

We're not mercenaries.

AISHA

Operational capital, that's all.

(holding out the check)

You've been waiting three years

for a shot at this guy. You're

not gonna get another. You want

Max, this is it.

AISHA (CONT'D)

Intel on the shipment. You check

it out, you check me out, you decide -

are you in or not?

CUT TO:

NOW THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO

31.

SHORT SCIENTIST

You know we cannot do this... We

cannot do what you ask...

MAX

Tell me - is this a moral issue or

a financial issue?

FAT SCIENTIST

A moral issue.

MAX

(ACTUALLY CURIOUS)

Really? You object morally to

this deal?

FAT SCIENTIST

Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave...

MAX

Okay, here's what I'm hearing.

I'm hearing "No." I'm hearing

"Leave," and I'm hearing "I'm

sorry." Is that what I'm hearing?

FAT SCIENTIST

Please... you must leave...

MAX

Right. Okay, so that is what I'm

hearing. Now, I want you to listen.

Listen carefully because I want

you to hear this. Wade?

32.

MAX (CONT'D)

What the hell was that?

WADE

You gave me the nod.

MAX

A "hit him in the face" nod, not a

"throw him out the window" nod.

WADE

I thought that's what you wanted.

MAX

At most--at most that was a "break

his fingers" nod.

(slams his fist)

I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was

scientific genius. Granted his

weight signaled that he had certain

impulse control issues, but that's

no reason to throw his fat ass out

a fifty story window.

WADE

Sorry...

MAX

(as if to a child)

I think I speak for everyone here

when I say that your actions were

excessive and, yes, more than just

a little wasteful...

MAX (CONT'D)

...then again, it seemed to have

had the desired effect - toss Short

Round out next.

33.

SHORT SCIENTIST

Wait!

SHORT SCIENTIST (CONT'D)

We have a different moral

perspective than our late colleague.

MAX

The hell you say.

(PAUSE)

I need one to test and one to use.

SHORT SCIENTEST

One to test?

MAX

Of course one to test - you think

I trust you?

SHORT SCIENTIST

We will need much money.

MAX

You will have much money.

MAX

Call our people at Goliath, tell

them we'll have a special package

arriving on the 17th.

ROQUE (O.S.)

So this is what your girl came up

with, huh?

34.

CLAY

Better than a ball pit...

ROQUE

You sure you're thinking clear on

this?

(off Clay's look)

I know you. When you slip, it's

always cause of a woman.

CLAY

Name one time that-

ROQUE

(INSTANTLY)

Carla.

CLAY

Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's

husband was the problem-

ROQUE

Carla's husband wasn't the one who

SHOT YOU-

CLAY

Okay. Yes. She shot me.

(PAUSE)

But only in the leg.

ROQUE

What about Emma?

CLAY

Emma doesn't count, we never slept

together.

ROQUE

Because she put a bomb in your

car.

CLAY

I admit, that took some of the

romance out of the relationship.

35.

ROQUE

And now this chick, first time you

meet her, burns down our hotel.

Also, she kills people for a living.

These are not good signs...

CLAY

I'm clear, Roque.

ROQUE

You better be. Or we're done.

POOCH

Damn. We missed you too.

POOCH (CONT'D)

So what's this I hear about Clay

gettin' us killed over a girl?

AISHA (O.S.)

Been a long time since anyone called

me a girl.

POOCH

Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for

stealth and shit, but next time

could you just knock?

ROQUE

How long you been back there?

AISHA

Long enough.

(TO CLAY)

She put a bomb in your car?

36.

CLAY

She was volatile. Aisha, meet

Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.

AISHA

Really? You can't hang out with

anyone just named "Phil"?

JENSEN

Hail, hail, the gang's all here!

Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent

Bob. Hottie.

(TO AISHA)

I'm gonna need a moment alone with

the boys if you don't mind, but

I'd like to reserve the right to

awkwardly hit on you later?

AISHA

I'd expect no less.

(TO CLAY)

Have fun...

CLAY

What do you have on her?

JENSEN

Besides a pants-busting crush?

(OPENING LAPTOP)

Her intel checks out. The cargo

will be arriving here in two days.

ROQUE

(DEADPAN)

Wow, I completely trust her now.

CLAY

What else?

JENSEN

Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a

local, Dad was white devil... oh,

and CIA's got a kill order out on

her.

(MORE)

37.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD--

pretty much everyone with the

exception of PETA wants this chick

amscrayed.

POOCH

Why?

JENSEN

Last CIA email flagged with her

name says she was digging for

information about a special

project...

(looks up at them)

"Codename: MAX".

POOCH

They want to wet her cause she's

lookin' into Max. That sounds

familiar...

ROQUE

(DUBIOUS)

Could those files-

JENSEN

(finishing his question)

-have been planted for us to find?

(shaking his head)

CIA timestamp, digital watermark...

Someone would've had to go to a

lot of trouble, and I mean a lot,

to fool me.

CLAY

I say we go with her. Pooch?

POOCH

I'm in.

CLAY

Jensen?

38.

JENSEN

Hell yeah. Cougs?

ROQUE

For now.

JENSEN

Hot damn! Back with the Colonel,

doing another bid for God and

COUNTRY-

ROQUE

Country turned her back on us, and

God can screw. This one's for us.

CLAY

And anyone who calls me "Colonel"

better be ready to take a beating

or an order. We ain't soldiers

anymore.

POOCH

(HAPPY NONETHELESS)

So what's the plan, my civilian

brothers?

CLAY

Sleep. We start tomorrow.

JENSEN

Start where?

CLAY

We're going bird hunting.

CUT TO:

MAX (V.O.)

It used to be so simple. A post

9/11 world...

39.

MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

As a country we spoke with one

voice, moved with one purpose. We

had a wicked boner for doing the

right thing, and now look at us!

MAX

90 percent of the globe is tooling

up to whack us and we're too busy

losing our nerve to notice. It's

Us versus Them and right now my

money would be on them...

MAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who

once said the tree of freedom must

be watered with etcetera, etcetera?

We need to wake people up, Wade.

We need to hit them in the face,

angry up the blood, give them their

balls back.

MAX (CONT'D)

We need to give them a ten megaton

reality check.

(ala John Lee Hooker)

Boom Boom Boom Boom...

40.

MAX (CONT'D)

I think it's safe to say it works!

MAX (CONT'D)

Jeez, talk about hard to impress...

WADE

The Company's with you on this?

MAX

Kinda... Sorta...

MAX (CONT'D)

You know the drill, they don't

like to know how the sausages get

made. What do you care?

WADE

I don't. Just want to make sure

everyone gets paid.

MAX

The money's coming from our

Afghanistan operation. And what

the Company doesn't know won't

hurt them.

WADE

Unless they're within the blast

radius.

41.

MAX

We're gonna saving our country,

Wade. The United States of America

will benefit greatly from what

we're doing.

WADE

I was born in Quebec.

MAX

Jesus, fine - we're saving North

America, does that make you happy?

Just get it done.

RADIO TRANSMISSION (V.O.)

Base One, this is Cavalier 415.

Sector eight perimeter clear,

proceeding to sector nine...

JENSEN

(into radio; drawls)

Roger that Cav 415, we have a report

of a civilian vehicle breakdown on

U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four.

Please assist as required.

DRIVER

Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple

A service...

42.

SOLDIER 1

Need a hand, buddy?

POOCH

Appreciate it.

SOLDIER 1

AAOW! Something just bit me!

SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)

(staring at the dart)

Is this...?

CLAY

Go.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Make the call.

43.

JENSEN

Base One, this is Cavalier 415!

We have been in a collision with a

civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead

an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed

up his neck! He can't move! Oh

god, it's horrible! We need medevac

immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE

ONE, HE'S GOT KIDS!

BASE ONE (O.S.)

Roger, Cavalier 415! We're

scrambling a chopper, hang in there!

JENSEN

Robert De Niro who?

POOCH

Sleeping like babies.

ROQUE

What about their ride?

CLAY

Flip it.

POOCH

What do you think's up with that

"don't call me Colonel" stuff?

JENSEN

Classic loss of identity. Clay

defined himself by his place in

the military structure.

(MORE)

44.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

It was his way of measuring the

good he did in the world. Without

it, he's just another loser like

the rest of us.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

You know there's a website where

you can download MP3's of donkeys

farting? How cool is that?

BASE ONE (O.S.)

Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta.

Be advised, we are airborne and in-

bound to your position!

CLAY

All right, everyone get into

character...

CUT TO:

JENSEN

Lot of work to bum a ride.

ROQUE

Shut up, Jensen.

JENSEN

You shut up, Roque. You're dead,

I'm the spinal injury - Spinal

injury can talk, dead can't.

ROQUE

Stop talking or I'll break your

neck for real.

JENSEN

Seriously, you have to get more

into your role! Dead guy! No

talking! Dead guy!

45.

CLAY

Here we go...

PILOT

(INTO RADIO)

Base One, this is Medevac Delta.

We have visual on Cavalier 415.

EMT

Alright buddy, we're gonna get you

patched up in no time...

JENSEN

Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been

gut shot...

EMT

Sure, in Iraq. What a mess...

JENSEN

Means you know what's coming to

you if try to play hero. Now,

lose the radio mic, Bones.

PILOT ONE

What are they jawing about out

there? We're burning fuel--

POOCH

You heard of car-jacked? You've

just been chopper-jacked, my man.

46.

PILOT ONE

You're robbing the US Army?

POOCH

When he says it out loud, it does

sound kinda ridiculous...

CLAY

Where's my wild goose?

JENSEN

We're all set here. Ready to take

a giant step for... well, for

guys who steal stuff, I guess.

CLAY

Hit it.

JENSEN

Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.

BASE ONE (O.S.)

Medevac Delta, this is Base One.

What's your situation, over?

POOCH

Time to move.

47.

DRUGGED SOLDIER

...Well, shit.

POOCH

...no, what you want is a gas

turbine generator running a force-

fed rectifier unit, hook it up to

the fuel tank...

JENSEN

So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush,

huh? That must've been rough.

AISHA

(watching the chopper)

Uh-huh...

JENSEN

Got any hobbies?

AISHA

When I was a girl, I collected

human ears. I had over three dozen

pairs when a feral dog came into

our camp one night and took them.

The dog was good eating, though.

JENSEN

I'm gonna go somewhere else now.

AISHA

Are small arms gonna be a problem?

POOCH

It's taken care of - we lined the

hull with half inch steel plate.

48.

ROQUE

Which brings us to our next

question...

ROQUE (CONT'D)

What's your angle in this?

CLAY

Roque...

AISHA

I'm giving you a chance to get

even. That's all you need to know.

ROQUE

I'm gonna shoot her, Clay.

CLAY

No, you're not.

ROQUE

Yes, I am.

CLAY

No.

ROQUE

Right now.

CLAY

See?

ROQUE

She's coming with us. And if

anything feels like a set-up, I

put a bullet in her skull.

(TO AISHA)

Sound fair?

49.

AISHA

Oh, completely. Now, if you'll

excuse me, it's time for prayers.

ROQUE

You're Muslim?

AISHA

You know, you are a sharp one--and

don't let any of these other boys

tell you different.

ROQUE

I don't like this.

CLAY

I picked up on that.

POOCH

I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks

we're dead. We show up alive and

kickin', start waving our dicks

around in public, they're gonna

make it their business to bury us.

They'll call us terrorists, all

KINDSA SHIT-

CLAY

What do you think we are now?

(to all of them)

Best case scenario, this gets us

face to face with Max-

ROQUE

What if it doesn't? What if we

never get face to face with him.

Are you gonna be able to live with

that? Ever?

POOCH

Hell, let's just say it out loud...

(PAUSE)

We do this, we're declaring war on

the Central Intelligence Agency.

50.

COUGAR

They started it.

SMASH TO:

FENNEL

As of this moment, the truck is

designated an extraterritorial

zone of immunity. Under no

circumstances whatsoever are you

or your men to allow the package

to leave the truck before it's

secure in the compound - to do so

would be considered an act of

treason and punishable as such.

LIDDY

Understood and acknowledged, sir.

WADE

Ten men ride with the package and

another ten ride chase.

WADE (CONT'D)

Let's go.

51.

CLAY

Are we wired?

JENSEN

Like Belushi.

(INTO RADIO)

Target is westbound. Heading for

the bridge...

COUGAR

CLAY (O.S.)

Take em'.

52.

SWAT DRIVER

Shit, I'm losing it!

WADE

Form a defensive perimeter around

the truck!

FENNEL

They're out of their minds, there's

no way off this bridge...

WADE

Masks on! Secure the package!

SWAT GUY

Where are they? I can't see them-

53.

FENNEL

Code RED! We are under attack!

Need Chopper Support right now!

CONTROL (V.O.)

Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!

DOORS --

WADE

Cavalry's here!

WADE (CONT'D)

Move! Point cover! Go, go!

54.

CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)

This is Chopper Support--we are

inbound your position, ETA five

minutes! Hang in there!

FENNEL

What the hell? It's welded shut!

SWAT GUY

(REALIZING)

The windows too! We're sealed in!

FADE TO:

55.

FENNEL

We're down, okay! You go the second

the ramp lowers! Hit them hard,

three round bursts, center mass!

AISHA

Open the valve.

FENNEL

These guys are about to get the

surprise of their lives...

FENNEL (CONT'D)

What the hell they trying to do,

drown us?

SOLDIER 1

Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!

56.

FENNEL

Eat the ground, or they blow your

head off!

CLAY

I don't think so.

FENNEL

First and only warning, Clay!

CLAY

Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think

about it.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Things'll kill you.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Good boys. Now, let's see what

kind of cargo you got in there.

FENNEL

Clay, no bullshit - you open that

box and we all die.

CLAY

I'm already dead, remember?

CUT TO:

57.

JENSEN

Goliath the oil company?

AISHA

It must be how he moves the drugs...

ROQUE

Great. The super evil bad guy is

in bed with the world's largest

oil company. That's just fabulous.

POOCH

You want me to go ask Fennel the

combination?

JENSEN

Nah, I can bypass no problem.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Voila! Ten million dollars of

horse, comin' up!

POOCH

Is that...?

CLAY

Yeah.

58.

POOCH

Is that...?

CLAY

Yeah. Jensen, you're up.

JENSEN

Huh?

CLAY

The bomb.

JENSEN

(HOLLOW)

But I'm not good with bombs...

CLAY

Get better.

JENSEN

Okay. Okay.

(OPENING LAPTOP)

Nukes. That's a nuke. Who makes

nukes? Department of Defense.

DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the

DOD MAINFRAME-

ROQUE

SHOULD WE-

JENSEN

(TYPING FAST)

It would really be good if you

didn't talk right now- get that

casing off for me.

POOCH

What if that sets it off?

CLAY

Then we die thirty seconds early -

do it.

59.

POOCH

I got wires - red, blue, green,

white, yellow-

JENSEN

(STILL TYPING)

Okay, just hold position!

POOCH

There's also pink-

JENSEN

Hold position!

AISHA

Are you trying to make this more

dramatic?

JENSEN

Almost... Almost... Shit!

AISHA

What?

JENSEN

Computer crashed!

POOCH

Are you kidding me?

JENSEN

Yes, cause this is the time for

HUMOR-

CLAY

JENSEN-

60.

JENSEN

I told you, I'm not good at bombs!

CLAY

Do you have time to reboot?

POOCH

Okay, someone pick a color!

AISHA

(STRANGELY CALM)

Pull out all the wires.

ROQUE

What?

AISHA

You ever hear of a clock radio

that exploded cause you unplugged

it--pull out all the wires.

JENSEN

Opening it without the code must

have triggered the timer...

POOCH

You think?

ROQUE

Did you know?

AISHA

I just saved our lives-

ROQUE

(FEVER PITCH)

Did you know?

61.

AISHA

Of course not!

ROQUE

(CONFUSED)

Where the hell are you-

CLAY

Fennel.

FENNEL

Max thinks the country's lost it's

way, gone soft in the War on Terror!

This is his solution!

CLAY

Elaborate.

FENNEL

He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target,

pin it on the ragheads and boom -

freedom is on the march again!

The same people who want us to

pull back will be screaming to

turn the place into a parking lot!

POOCH

What was the target?

FENNEL

I CAN'T-

SCREAMS

FENNEL (CONT'D)

The Mall of America! Christ!

62.

FENNEL (CONT'D)

I'm serious! It's his sense of

humor! He told us we could choose

between there and Epcot Center...

JENSEN

(AMAZED)

Holy shit, it's like we were framed

by Dr. No...

AISHA

What about Goliath?

JENSEN

Yeah, what would an oil company

want with the Middle East?

FENNEL

(STILL FREAKED)

The ships that service their

offshore oil rigs are exempt from

US Customs! It's how Max gets the

drugs in and out of the country-

ROQUE

This is conspiracy theory bullshit-

FENNEL

It's not! There's proof!

CLAY

Where?

FENNEL

Max's heroin operation - Goliath

keeps accounts of the shipments!

JENSEN

Come on, dude, they'd be morons to

keep records of shit like this-

FENNEL

It's on a stand-alone hard drive!

It's their insurance policy against

Max - they know he's crazy, this

way they have something on him!

63.

CLAY

So this hard drive - it contains

evidence of what Max has been doing?

FENNEL

Yes!

CLAY

Can you get us this drive?

FENNEL

I don't know where it is! They

don't let me have access! But-

FENNEL (CONT'D)

No, wait! Please don't kill-

CLAY

I say we hit Goliath headquarters.

ROQUE

And do what - go after this non-

existent hard drive?

CLAY

We find out if it exists. If it

does, we steal it and trade it for

immunity.

ROQUE

That's your plan?

CLAY

You got a better one?

(MORE)

64.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Max gives us back our lives or we

upload the data to the net, show

the American people what's being

done in their names.

ROQUE

Why risk our lives again when we

already have something to trade?

CLAY

You want to give it back to him?

ROQUE

I want to at least discuss it before

signing up for another suicide

mission on the say-so of some flunky-

CLAY

It's not happening.

ROQUE

So you want to take down Goliath

now? Then who? McDonald's?

American Airlines? Microsoft?

CLAY

You don't want Max to pay?

ROQUE

I want my life back! This is

supposed to be us getting clear -

not saving the world!

POOCH

ROQUE-

ROQUE

We're not the goddamn good guys

anymore! I love you guys, but I

had a life before this shit, and I

sure as hell am not going to risk

getting it back because you came

down with a case of the Dudley

Damn Do-Rights!

65.

CLAY

Don't raise your voice at me-

ROQUE

I will raise whatever the hell I

want - you got a death wish because

you got beat by a voice on a radio-

ROQUE (CONT'D)

I'm gonna cut your head off...

POOCH

I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?

JENSEN

Goliath. Cougs?

CLAY

Aisha?

ROQUE

She doesn't get a vote-

AISHA

(staring at Roque)

Goliath.

POOCH

(SOFTLY)

Put it away...

66.

CLAY

You want your life back, you're

gonna have to steal it. We hit

them in two days.

JENSEN

Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad

fight?

POOCH

So what do we do about the nuke?

(PAUSE)

Did I just actually say that?

AISHA

I have an idea...

PATROLMAN (O.S.)

Holy- Sarge, come quick!

MATCH WITH:

67.

WADE

That's gonna be a quick trial...

MAX

Wonderful guy, salt of the earth,

he'll be missed--who took my bomb,

Wade?

WADE

You're not gonna like it...

MAX

Because I've been such a fan of

how things have gone up till now?

MAX (CONT'D)

Who the hell are these people?

WADE

Colonel Clay and his unit. You

had them killed three years ago?

MAX

I also had several African nations

overthrown three years ago, I'm a

BUSY GUY-

WADE

The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?

MAX

Shit.

WADE

Yeah.

MAX

Okay, they need to get dead. Get

me a six man fire team ready in

twelve hours.

68.

WADE

So what's the plan?

MAX

What's the plan? The plan is -

get me a six man fire team ready

in twelve hours.

WADE

Okay.

MAX

Are we now clear on the plan or do

you want to try a third go-around?

WADE

WE'RE CLEAR-

MAX

Because what I'm going to need you

to do is get me a six man fire

team ready in twelve hours. You

get that, right?

WADE

I get it.

MAX

And Wade?

MAX (CONT'D)

We're gonna need a new bomb.

SHORT SCIENTIST

We appreciate you meeting us in a

single story facility.

WADE

No problem.

(MORE)

69.

WADE (CONT'D)

I look at that entire incident as

your standard "getting to know"

each other business orientation.

SHORT SCIENTIST

I agree. Now that we know each

other, know, please, that if you

come near me with any more of that

Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit,

you will be fed to my dogs.

WADE

Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move

past the verbal aggression and get

into some business?

SHORT SCIENTIST

You want another device. One

billion dollars is now the price.

One billion dollars cash.

WADE

That's going to be difficult.

SHORT SCIENTIST

Life the way you people want to

live it is very difficult, Mr.

Wade. You want less difficult

move to my country, study Hinduism.

Meditate. Cultivate serenity.

Much less difficult. You want to

buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid

that is a more difficult way of

life.

WADE

He wants one billion in cash.

MAX

Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are

you related to them?

WADE

Actually, one of them, yes.

MAX

By blood?

WADE

(he's had it)

A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill

him, what are we doing?

MAX

It's not what we're doing, it's

what Clay is going to do for us...

WADE

And that is?

MAX

(GRINNING)

Get us our billion dollars...

CUT TO:

CLAY

I was just going over the plan.

CLAY (CONT'D)

You want to go over the plan?

CLAY (CONT'D)

Let's go over the plan...

CUT TO:

72.

AISHA

So, what really happened to you in

Afghanistan?

CLAY

(SOFTLY)

That's not for you.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Why do you want Max dead?

AISHA

He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?

CLAY

No.

AISHA

When you tell me about Afghanistan?

I'll tell you about Max.

CLAY

Fine. It's hot. There's lots of

sand. Your turn.

AISHA

Why were you alone when I found

you?

CLAY

The guys got sick of it.

AISHA

Sick of what?

73.

CLAY

Of hearing about Max. Of hearing

me say we had to do something when

there wasn't anything to do. They

wanted to be around their families.

Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a

wife and daughters.

AISHA

And he hasn't told them he is alive?

CLAY

Would you? The people you loved

the most, would you put them in

that kind of danger?

AISHA

So Roque has no one.

CLAY

He's got me.

AISHA

And you have...

CLAY

Enough hate to get us both through

the day. He stuck with me when no

one else would. And I ain't the

easiest guy to stick with.

AISHA

If you two really fought, he would

kill you, I think.

CLAY

You think.

AISHA

I'm almost sure of it.

CLAY

Why?

74.

AISHA

Because you care what happens to

the others. You wouldn't put them

at risk to save yourself.

CLAY

And you think that's a weakness.

AISHA

I know it is. Law of the jungle.

CLAY

We're not in the jungle.

AISHA

Oh, yes we are...

ROQUE

Well, that's just great.

POOCH

We're not going anywhere until you

two squash this shit.

CLAY

Pooch, we're on a schedule here-

CLAY (CONT'D)

Sorry I hit you.

POOCH

Good. Roque?

POOCH (CONT'D)

Roque?

75.

FINALLY:

ROQUE

Sorry I threatened to cut your

head off.

POOCH

Verrrry good. Now don't you two

feel better?

CLAY AND ROQUE

(IN UNISON)

No.

POOCH

I don't give a shit, I do.

(starts the van)

Now, let's go watch Jensen single-

handedly knock over the largest

oil company on the planet...

JENSEN

(SINGING)

I got jungle fever, you've got

jungle fever, we've got jungle

fever, we're in love...

JENSEN

(STILL SINGING)

...she's gone black-boy crazy,

I've gone white-girl hazy, ain't

no thinking maybe, we're in love...

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Yo! Package for Henderson!

76.

RECEPTIONIST

Excuse me one moment-

(TO JENSEN)

I'll take that, thank you.

JENSEN

No can do, chica, gotta put it in

his hands. He's gotta sign.

RECEPTIONIST

(back on phone)

I'm sorry--could you say that again?

JENSEN

Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!

RECEPTIONIST

Forty fifth floor.

JENSEN

(SINGING)

I got jungle fever, you've got

jungle fever, we've got jungle

fever, we're in love...

JENSEN

(ON PHONE)

Mr. Henderson, please.

77.

SECRETARY

Who's calling, please?

JENSEN

Richard Hertz from Internal

Security.

SECRETARY

One moment, please...

JENSEN

Ladies... hi.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Liking the angle of the dangle?

HENDERSON

This is Henderson.

JENSEN

Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson,

Richard Hertz from Internal

Security. If you'd be kind enough

to make your way down to the lobby?

HENDERSON

Uh... Can I ask what this is about?

JENSEN

It's a matter of a somewhat

sensitive nature involving an

(MORE)

78.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

individual exposing himself to

women in the elevators--best

discussed in person. If you'd

just head on down...

JENSEN

Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support.

Is Henderson around? I'm supposed

to install a firewall on his system-

SECRETARY

Oh, you just missed him by like

two seconds. Can you come back in

like an hour or so?

JENSEN

Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs

breathing down my neck. They want

security upgraded for the senior

managers all of a sudden.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Five minutes and I'll be out of

your hair!

SECRETARY

Security?

79.

JENSEN

According to this, the drive exists,

Clay.

CLAY

You're sure?

JENSEN

Abso-tootly.

CLAY

Is it in the building?

JENSEN

No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta

be a remote location, stand-alone.

I'm checking their security logs--

wherever they've detailed the most

guys is probably where it'll be...

SECURITY GUARD 1 (O.S.)

"Skippy"?

SECURITY GUARD 1 (CONT'D)

Show me some ID. Real easy.

JENSEN

Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Get me out of here, Clay...

80.

CLAY (O.S.)

(THROUGH RADIO)

There's a fire exit thirty yards

north of your position.

BIG SECURITY 1 (O.S.)

Freeze like a statue, pretty boy!

JENSEN

I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal

weapon...

JENSEN (CONT'D)

It was this secret government

project. They did stuff to me.

Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned

me into a dangerous Telekinetic.

(wiggles index fingers)

As the old saying goes - you don't

start none... there won't be none.

BIG SECURITY 1

Telekinetic your way out of this...

JENSEN

Bang.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Boom.

BIG SECURITY 2

You broke my ribs...

81.

THIRD GUARD

Please- d-don't shoot...

JENSEN

Face down, or I'll make your hearts

stop beating with my mind.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Thanks, Coug...

COUGAR

De Nada.

CUT TO:

MAX

By your boys?

WADE

They're not "my boys". I don't

like this. I say we grab Clay and

kill the rest.

MAX

(STILL LISTENING)

If you can find them-

82.

WADE

I can.

MAX

(into phone; JAPANESE)

(hangs up; to Wade)

Why, Mr. Wade... methinks you

have a secret.

(CONSIDERING)

Okay. Put a fire team together.

WADE

You're sure? You're not going to

call me in two hours and have me

kill them?

(off Max's look)

I'm on it...

CUT TO:

JENSEN

Everything on Goliath - security,

personnel history, the works.

CLAY

Where's the drive being kept?

JENSEN

Port of New York, baby. Total

stand alone facility, and they're

spending 30K a day on onsite

security - you don't drop that

kinda green to just guard oil.

83.

ROQUE

What are we up against?

JENSEN

Let me check, I--oh, shit...

CLAY

What's "oh, shit"?

JENSEN

They've hired Par-Sec.

CLAY

(HONESTLY)

Oh, shit...

AISHA

Who's Par-Sec?

JENSEN

Paradigm Security Services. Ex-

Special Forces.

POOCH

Basically guys like Cougar but

without the warm and cuddly side.

CLAY

Goliath must have brought them in

after we hit their truck...

JENSEN

Our drive is being guarded by

military trained, trigger repressed,

blood thirsty, stone cold killers...

Am I the only one who's thinking

maybe we just chill out and go to

Six Flags?

84.

CLAY

Comb that drive for every last

scrap of info. We're on a plane

for New York tomorrow...

CLAY

Oh, hi.

ROQUE

Thought you guys'd be back at the

hotel.

POOCH

Couldn't sleep.

ROQUE

Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from

the machine - you want one?

POOCH

No thanks.

JENSEN

You won't believe how detailed

these files are. Every Goliath

executive they've ever insured,

their policies, their payouts-

ROQUE

Life insurance?

JENSEN

Yeah.

ROQUE

What's the biggest payout?

85.

JENSEN

(STILL TYPING)

Gotta be wrongful death...

ROQUE

Pretty much what we're gonna be

risking.

(TO POOCH)

What are you doing up?

POOCH

Jensen hacked a satellite for me

earlier.

ROQUE

The hell you need a satellite for?

POOCH

When we first went over in 2001,

Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted

to do the yellow ribbon thing,

right? Only problem was there was

no yellow ribbon to be found - all

the stores had been cleaned out.

ROQUE

Military neighborhood...

POOCH

No doubt. And Tina's four at the

time, and what she can't understand

is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow.

So Jolene sings her the song, right?

To show her where the idea comes

from. And when she's all done,

Tina, four years old, looks my

wife dead in her eye and says

"that's the dumbest song I ever

heard."

(LAUGHING)

So my wife and my four year old

ended up tying a frilly purple

ribbon round the old oak tree in

our yard to bring Daddy home...

86.

ROQUE

(SMILING)

Thought that counts, right?

POOCH

Yeah...

THEN:

POOCH (CONT'D)

Jolene dated a guy last summer.

Didn't turn into anything and I

sure as hell can't blame her, but

that man was in my house, Roque.

I know you're not a hundred percent

on this op, but if it can get me

back to them...

ROQUE

I hear you, man.

JENSEN

(READING)

Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath

exec ever - 14 million and it was

wrongful death - Vice President of

Operations in Afghanistan, three

years ago, paid to his daughter...

JENSEN (CONT'D)

We're going to need to drive fast...

CLAY

You really want to know about

Afghanistan?

87.

JENSEN

You think she's gonna kill him?

POOCH AND ROQUE

(various versions of)

Uh-uh. No way.

JENSEN

Yeah, I think so too...

AISHA

And this man you found in the

basement - he was your true target?

CLAY

Max's true target. Yeah.

AISHA

And you spoke with him?

CLAY

He knew we were off mission. He

knew Max wanted him dead...

AISHA

Did he beg?

CLAY

Excuse me?

AISHA

The man in the basement. Did he

beg for his life?

CLAY

He begged to die--why are you asking

me this?

JENSEN

Freeze!

88.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

She's his daughter, Clay! The guy

in the basement's daughter and

she's got a gun and it's pointed...

(realizing; not happy)

...at my dick! Her gun is pointed

at my dick!

AISHA

(CALM)

Would you rather I pointed it at

your head?

JENSEN

I know it makes no sense, but

actually yes.

Aisha watches them. CLOSE ON THEIR EYES. Nobody moves.

CLAY

Wait.

89.

ROQUE

Shit, she's got back-up!

COUGAR

Run.

ROQUE

Go, go, go!

POOCH

Think that got her?

CLAY

She ain't that lucky. Jensen,

status!

JENSEN

My dick remains unshot!

ROQUE

Here they come...

90.

CLAY

Somebody shoot something!

JENSEN

I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug,

do you have a plan?

(to the others)

He's got a plan!

POOCH

(trying to steer)

Stop yelling at the sniper!

WADE

They got away.

MAX

So?

(MORE)

91.

MAX (CONT'D)

(off Wade's look)

We know exactly where they're going,

Wade. Port of New York, for their

big final awesome stand against

the forces of evil where they die.

SHORT SCIENTIST

Do you have the money?

MAX

Jesus, always with the money! So

impersonal! How are you? How

have you been?

SHORT SCIENTIST

I recently attended the funeral of

my best friend who you had thrown

out a window. How have you been?

MAX

Can't complain. I'm thinking of

getting satellite radio in my car...

SHORT SCIENTIST

I think you're a freak. Too much

Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy

football.

MAX

Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.

SHORT SCIENTIST

We have your ordinance. You have

twenty four hours to get the money.

MAX

Time to go make a withdrawal...

92.

SHORT SCIENTIST

New change of plan. You stay.

MAX

I've got to go get your money.

SHORT SCIENTIST

He'll get your money. You stay

right here.

MAX

God, are you short.

SHORT SCIENTIST

Twenty three hours, fifty nine

minutes...

MAX

Get it done.

MAX (CONT'D)

How much do you weigh? Seriously.

SHORT SCIENTIST

I do not think you are funny.

MAX

Where the hell is my bomb?

SHORT SCIENTIST

You do not get it till I get the

money.

MAX

For a guy who's all about

transcending materialism, you talk

about money so much!

93.

SHORT SCIENTIST

If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will

cut your mouth out of your face.

MAX

Fine...

POOCH

She burned us, Clay.

CLAY

(PACING)

I know...

POOCH

The whole op is compromised-

CLAY

I know.

JENSEN

Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood

flowing out of his body...

(SMALLER VOICE)

Precious, precious blood...

CLAY

(RE: JENSEN)

Cougar?

JENSEN

What's that for?

POOCH

So we split up again. Right?

POOCH (CONT'D)

Right?

94.

ROQUE

Pooch...

POOCH

(IGNORING HIM)

Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows,

Max knows! It's over!

CLAY

(SLOWLY)

Okay. We split up. Some of us

should go international. I'll do

that if nobody else wants to-

ROQUE

So we just run again?

CLAY

There's nothing else we can do...

ROQUE

There's something we can do.

CLAY

Excuse me?

ROQUE

Three years is enough. If there's

a drive at that port that we can

use to get clear-

CLAY

What part of "he knows we're coming

for it" do you not get? They're

gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec

is gonna waiting for us...

95.

ROQUE

So figure out a way around them;

you're good at that shit, Clay!

ROQUE (CONT'D)

We run now, we're gonna be running

forever. This is our one chance

to get our lives back...

(TO CLAY)

To steal them back. And I'm

prepared to do anything to any one

to make that happen.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

Never play a longshot, you're never

gonna win.

CLAY

Pooch, what's the minimum time to

scout the patrols, get an accurate

head count on-site at the Port?

POOCH

48 hours, but Aisha knows that-

CLAY

So we hit them in twelve.

POOCH

Twelve hours from now? You mean--

you want us to go in blind?

ROQUE

Last thing they'll expect...

POOCH

Yeah, cause it's dumb.

CLAY

Jensen's already got the layout,

and Cougar can spot on site. Right?

96.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Jensen?

JENSEN

Yeah, cause gettin' shot is

awesome, I'm totally up for doing

it again...

CLAY

Pooch?

POOCH

Last time we went in blind on an

op, we lost everything...

CLAY

So?

POOCH

So let's go get it back.

CUT TO:

CLAY

You ready?

CLAY (CONT'D)

Roque?

97.

ROQUE

I'm ready.

CLAY

(INTO RADIO)

We're in. Status.

POOCH

The Pooch is good.

CLAY (O.S.)

Cougar, squelch if you're in

position.

COUGAR

Squelch.

CLAY

Jensen, we're coming. You ready?

98.

JENSEN

And the crowd goes wild...

JENSEN

What's the password?

ROQUE (O.S.)

Open the door before we kill you.

JENSEN

Drive should be in the Computer

Room, two skylights over.

CLAY

Roque and I will set the charges

here but we won't detonate until

you have the drive.

ROQUE

You can't settle for stealing the

drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's

shit too.

CLAY

What can I say, I hold a grudge.

(TO JENSEN)

Get gone.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Be ready to move the second Cougar

hits the fire alarm...

99.

BACK TO

POOCH (O.S.)

Guys, we got a problem...

POOCH

Wade's here.

CLAY

Are you kidding me?

POOCH (O.S.)

No. I say we roll.

JENSEN

I'm above the computer room, maybe

thirty seconds from the drive...

POOCH (O.S.)

Wade's headed your way - last chance

to get the duck out of Fodge...

100.

CLAY

Something's not right. Something...

ROQUE (O.S.)

Clay.

CLAY

What?

ROQUE

I think you should see this.

CLAY

You think... Aisha?

ROQUE

No. Not Aisha.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

You know, for a revenge driven

conspiracy nut, you're pretty

fucking gullible...

101.

POOCH

Jensen, you get it? Jensen?

WADE

Hello, Clay. Been awhile.

(NODDING)

Roque.

CLAY

When...?

ROQUE

After the truck. I got tired of

waiting for you to save us, so I

up and saved myself. Reached out

like I said and cut a deal - I set

this up, I go free.

CLAY

Traitor...

102.

ROQUE

You gave me no choice. It was

always gonna end like this, Clay.

Us captured or dead. It was always

a dead end. You made sure of it.

CLAY

(SPITTING BLOOD)

Bullshit...

ROQUE

Not bullshit. You were gonna keep

planning missions and ways to hit

Max until it got us all killed.

CLAY

No...

ROQUE

Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference

with this situation is at least I

get to walk away.

CLAY

We all could have walked... used

the drive...

ROQUE

Don't you get it yet? There is no

drive. There never was...

ROQUE (CONT'D)

Fennel made it up to save himself.

When I told Wade, he planted the

info at Goliath to lead you here.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

You really thought there was a

happy ending coming? Pooch was

gonna get his family back, we were

gonna get to be soldiers again?

(leans down; softly)

We lost the moment we went off

mission. This is just the logical

conclusion of that playing out.

You didn't want to hear it.

(MORE)

103.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

You just wanted your revenge.

Your face-to-face with the big bad

wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's

the way of the world...

ROQUE (CONT'D)

Guys like us don't beat guys like

him.

CLAY

Kill me now... Maybe you live

through this.

WADE

Oh, we're not gonna kill you.

Someone's gotta get away with the

cash. Your crew? I'm definitely

wasting them. But you?

WADE (CONT'D)

You're about to steal a billion

dollars from the Central

Intelligence Agency.

WADE (CONT'D)

It's for our replacement nuke.

When a billion goes missing, people

tend to ask who took it.

(CHUCKLING)

Max really does love to frame you...

WADE (CONT'D)

Take him away. Drop him in Newark.

(TO ROQUE)

I'll see you at Turner Airfield.

104.

ROQUE

Wait.

ROQUE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry it had to end this way.

CLAY

You're going to die very badly.

CLAY

(answering the question)

Roque.

LEAD GUARD

On your knees.

POOCH

Get on with it...

105.

LEAD GUARD

That's a nice hat.

LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)

Don't really care of there's a

hole in it. One wash, good as...

(NOTICING)

What are you smiling at?

AISHA

JENSEN

Shouldn't have gone after the hat...

106.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

Can you stand?

POOCH

I've been shot in both legs, what

kind of dumbass question is that?

JENSEN

Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're

not the only one who's been shot

recently, you know!

AISHA

Did you kill my father?

JENSEN

Clay?

CLAY

Kind of in the middle of something

here, Jensen-

AISHA

Did you kill him?

JENSEN

There was no drive, Clay-

107.

CLAY

(eyes on Aisha)

I KNOW-

JENSEN

There was no drive and Roque's

gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and

Pooch could bleed out-

AISHA

Did you kill him?

COUGAR (O.S.)

I did.

COUGAR (CONT'D)

He asked us. It was mercy. But

you're his family, so I understand.

COUGAR (CONT'D)

But only me.

AISHA

Wear it. Remember him.

108.

JENSEN

Okay, excellent, very tribal--We

need to go.

CLAY

Can you stand?

POOCH

This is stupid question day, isn't

it? It's stupid question day and

someone forgot to tell me...

CLAY

Let's go.

FINALLY:

CLAY

They won. We lost. Way it goes.

POOCH

Way it always goes.

109.

POOCH (CONT'D)

Guess we should just head home.

Oh, wait, that's right. We don't

have homes.

COUGAR

Where to, Colonel?

WADE

Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should

we be worried?

ROQUE

Clay doesn't take risks. It's why

I'm here and he's not.

WADE

You're sure?

WADE (CONT'D)

Can I ask you something? Why'd

you stick with those losers for so

long?

ROQUE

They were good guys.

WADE

No such thing. I'll go call Max.

110.

CLAY

Hi, Wade!

ROQUE

Declan, start the plane...

POOCH

Next time, remind me - car crash

first, then get shot...

JENSEN

Sounds less painful that way...

CLAY

Cougar and I are going after that

plane. The rest of you, get Wade.

JENSEN

Me and legless Pooch are on it!

(RE: AISHA)

Where the hell is she going?

POOCH

You call me legless Pooch again,

you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

JENSEN

What, it's a cool name! It makes

you sound like a pirate!

(off his look)

Fine, let's go kill Wade...

111.

ROQUE

PILOT

We don't have enough runway to

take off - we're going to have to

turn around and come back to get

up to speed!

ROQUE

Fine, just get us in the air!

ROQUE (CONT'D)

I'm out!

CLAY

I'm out.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Get me closer...

JENSEN

Yoo-hoo! Wade!

(a'la the Warriors)

Come out and plaaaayyy-

JENSEN (CONT'D)

(INTO RADIO)

Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...

112.

JENSEN (CONT'D)

I think I just found our way out

of here...

ROQUE

Gotta admit, I always wondered how

this would play out.

CLAY

Aisha thinks you kill me.

ROQUE

It's a distinct possibility...

ROQUE (CONT'D)

You don't have a knife?

CLAY

Don't need one.

ROQUE

Bit of as longshot for you...

CLAY

(SMILING)

No. It's not.

113.

ROQUE

Now I really am gonna cut your

head off...

CLAY

SHIT-

THE CORVETTE

114.

THE PLANE

THE CORVETTE

CLAY (CONT'D)

Rifle...

THE CORVETTE

115.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Outstanding.

JENSEN

Not to rain on everyone's we killed

all the bad guys parade, but we

should probably get gone - legless

Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up

for us in the Hangar.

(off Pooch's look)

It's a cool name-

CLAY

Hello?

MAX

We good?

CLAY

Not by a longshot. You're not

having a real great day, Max.

MAX

Who is this?

CLAY

Just a voice on the phone.

MAX

Where's Wade?

CLAY

Working on the engines.

116.

MAX

Clay.

CLAY

It's Colonel.

MAX

Colonel, yes. Well done.

CLAY

Thank you.

MAX

I understand you've always wanted

to meet face to face. I'm sure

that could be arranged...

CLAY

I don't think the guys you're about

to stiff for a billion dollars are

going to allow that to happen.

(looks to the others)

We win. You lose. Goodbye.

CLAY (CONT'D)

Lear jet?

POOCH

(GRINNING)

Ready when you are.

AISHA

I wanted to find and punish those

responsible for my father's death.

Max, his men, everyone.

CLAY

That why you slept with me?

117.

AISHA

That and the cardio.

CLAY

You coming?

AISHA

I'm coming.

CLAY

Good cause there's no way I could

walk it...

SHORT SCIENTEST

Time is up, Stretch.

MAX

Stretch. That's a good one.

SHORT SCIENTEST

Because you are so much taller

than I.

MAX

Yeah, no, I get it...

MAX (CONT'D)

You gentlemen consider yourselves

to be soldiers or businessmen?

CUT TO:

118.

BLACK SCREEN

FADE OUT
