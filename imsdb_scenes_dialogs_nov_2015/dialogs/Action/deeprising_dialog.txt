HANOVER

You remember the first time we met

Finnegan? I think you were just

starting out...smuggling gold off

Sumatra for those two

Chinese...what did we use to call

them?

FINNEGAN

Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we

strolling down memory lane for any

particular reason?

HANOVER

No, it just struck me as odd...I

don't see you for all these years

and you've still got the same tape

stuck in the box.

FINNEGAN

You know what they say...the

classics are eternal.

HANOVER

So where are we?

FINNEGAN

Right here...middle of nowhere...

HANOVER

And where is our point of arrival?

FINNEGAN

Right here...middle of

nowhere...and the answer to your

question is yes.

HANOVER

Which question is that?

FINNEGAN

The one you came up to ask...are we

on schedule?

HANOVER

(to Mason)

Take note Mr. Mason...this is why

you hire a professional...No

whining. No excuses.

MASON

(attitude)

I've heard a lot of stories about

you mate...

FINNEGAN

All of them flattering I'm sure.

MASON

They were...but they musta been

talking about another Finnegan...

because the one I heard about was

as rough as they came...the one I'm

looking at is, well, about as

current as the music.

HANOVER

Don't mind him Finnegan...you

remember 25...balls of steel...

splashing around in a sea of

testosterone.

FINNEGAN

I don't mind him...but I do think

it's time for him to get back down

below with the rest of the

playgroup.

MASON

And who's gonna make me?

FINNEGAN

The Finnegan you heard about.

HANOVER

That's why we're sill around

Finnegan...you and me... Nothing

gets the feathers up. Business is

business. Eh?

FINNEGAN

And the classics are eternal.

OLD WOMAN

He said an orchid and a beautiful

woman belonged together... It was

our first date.

OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)

He said that it was the orchid I

wore that made him fall in love

with me...

TRILLIAN

He sounds like a real gentleman.

OLD WOMAN

The best of the best he was... This

cruise was supposed to be our 60th

anniversary gift to each other. He

died last Spring...

TRILLIAN

I'm so sorry...

OLD WOMAN

I was going to wear one...special

for him...like a memory...

OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)

But without him here I don't know

why I should.

TRILLIAN

Because an orchid and a beautiful

woman belong together.

CANTON (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen...

CANTON (CONT'D)

All my life I had the dream of

building the greatest pleasure ship

ever to sail the seven seas...

tonight, seeing all of you

here...so elegant...so

beautiful...so rich...

CANTON (CONT'D)

I realize my dream has come

true...I thank you all from the

bottom of my heart for making it

so...

CANTON (CONT'D)

To the Fuji Maru! Good times

forever!

CROWD

Forever!! Here! Here!

TRILLIAN

(French)

Is it true what they say about a

captain and his boat.

CAPTAIN

Is what true madame?

TRILLIAN

(French)

Madamoiselle...that the bigger the

boat...the bigger the man...

CAPTAIN

It is a theory I would be glad to

put to the test.

TRILLIAN

(French)

In school, the Sisters said testing

was my specialty.

Captain...

PASSENGER (CONT'D)

CANTON

You wanted to see me Captain?

CAPTAIN

We have a storm rising behind us...

we may have to close the canopy, I

hope it doesn't ruin your party.

CANTON

(self-satisfied)

Ruin my party? Captain, this ship

was built to withstand a typhoon. I

can't imagine there's anything on

the sea today that could possibly

ruin my party.

You know what my goal is? Before I

die I want to make love to a woman

from every country on earth.

VIVO

You mean countries that are

acknowledged by the UN...or like

made up countries too?

MULLIGAN

What the hell does that mean?

VIVO

Like Mamooli's country...

MAMOOLI

What you talkin'? Samoa's a county!

VIVO

It's a dot on a map...

MULLIGAN

Map...no map...I don't give a shit

the list.

HANOVER

Mr. Billy you're in the batter's

box.

BILLY

we're professionals. Hold him...Mr.

Chin...

HANOVER (CONT'D)

Anyone else?

MASON

I'll take a go and the I vote we

throw the little weasel

overboard...

MULLIGAN

I vote we slit his throat THEN

throw him overboard...

FINNEGAN

...this is not a democracy. You

don't get a vote.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

I'll say it again for the hearing

impaired...

HANOVER

This isn't right Finnegan. I've got

a contract.

FINNEGAN

(RECITING)

20 hours on the clock. Out and

back. Double for overtime.

HANOVER

And no questions asked.

FINNEGAN

Who asked any?

HANOVER

He did...with a crowbar...you know

the rules on a broken contract.

FINNEGAN

I know it...but you want to get

where you want to get, and back? I

need a chief engineer, and unless

you got a replacement, I'd highly

recommend overlooking the

indiscretion.

PANTUCCI

Thanks...

FINNEGAN

You put me in that position again

I'll throw you overboard myself.

Speedboat in the middle of the

How soon can we get up and running?

We can't...we got one engine dead,

and the other limping badly.

We were talking about my

You're going to have to get a new

Not an option.

HANOVER (CONT'D)

Mum and me we used to sit by our

front door and watch them...she

used to say "one day you're going

to make your fortune in life on one

of them..."

FINNEGAN

Great woman your mother. Real

foresight.

HANOVER

And she could do a hell of a barbie

to boot! Belt up. You'll find all

the parts you need up there.

FINNEGAN

I assume somebody up there has made

sure no distress signal can be

sent.

I'd say that's a pretty good

assumption.

So how do you get from the Bronx to

You quit high school, lie about

your age, join the navy, and next

It's not them...it's it...

TRILLIAN

What?

FINNEGAN

You know what kind of force it took

to rip open the bow of this ship? A

million little things like this...

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

...can't exert that kind of

pressure... And the way it tracked

us? A million little things don't

carry portable phones to coordinate

positions... What's chasing us...

TRILLIAN

(quietly)

Finnegan...

FINNEGAN

Yeah...

TRILLIAN

...the minute you start your

engines ...it's going to kill us,

isn't it?

FINNEGAN

Not unless we kill it first.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

Anything moves, you shoot.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

There's not much horsepower left in

the engines, but there's enough

noise...once this baby's set...I'll

rev it up...that slimy bastard will

come for it like candy...

TRILLIAN

If you blow up your boat, how are

we going to get to the island?

FINNEGAN

Jet ski...there's one left up

there.

FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

...let's see, it was red wire cross

compressor blue wire...or blue

cross red?

PANTUCCI

Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!

FINNEGAN

Just the man I wanted to see. On

this puppy here, you remember if

it's red to blue or blue to red...

PANTUCCI

Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see

you? Joey, what happened to your

leg?

FINNEGAN

Joey, you want to get sucked out by

a giant fucking mutated squid?

PANTUCCI

(fast)

Red cross over to blue double blue

...is that what it is? A squid?

FINNEGAN

Squid...squid like...squid type...

it's got tentacles, a feed sac...

probably one central nervous

processor somewhere...what the hell

do I know is going on deep down in

the ocean...there's all sorts of

shit we've never seen...eighty foot

clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just

guessing...can you get me more

juice out of Hercules...fast?

PANTUCCI

For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's

not fast.

TRILLIAN

How about noise? Can you get noise?

We don't need speed, just noise,

right?

FINNEGAN

Right...

PANTUCCI

Can somebody tell me what the

object of the exercise is here?

FINNEGAN

Seafood salad.

(to Trillian)

You ever operate a jet ski?

TRILLIAN

(nervous)

You want ME to go up there?

FINNEGAN

Not unless you can wire a missile

or fix an engine.

TRILLIAN

And what if I run into one of those

things?

FINNEGAN

Don't forget the safety.

TRILLIAN

Don't take too long...I'm not

planning on being on the menu

tonight.

PANTUCCI

(razzing)

I've never seen you so congenial

with a member of the opposite

sex... The two of you got a nice

patter going...got a nice

rapport...

FINNEGAN

And you got 10 minutes before this

thing livens up a boring evening.

luck has just about run shit out...

FINNEGAN

A little to the left...

PANTUCCI

I think we gotta stop floating from

one fucked up situation to the

next...

FINNEGAN

Line it up now, nice and easy...

PANTUCCI

I'm telling you, man, we got to

give the future some serious

thought.

FINNEGAN

PANTUCCI (CONT'D)

Man, don't go up there...

FINNEGAN

One whistle... Start the engine...

PANTUCCI

She's gone...

FINNEGAN

Second whistle you make it to the

jealous, you know that, Joey?
