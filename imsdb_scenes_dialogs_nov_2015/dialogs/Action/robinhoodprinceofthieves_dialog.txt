FIRST DRAFT

PRINCE OF THIEVES

INTERROGATOR

He says you stole his bread.

PETER

It is a lie. I caught him

stealing ours.

INTERROGATOR

Cut off the infidel's hand.

(CONTINUED)

2.

ROBIN

No!... I took the bread.

PETER

That's not true.

ROBIN

They're not interested in truth.

You are too weak, Peter. You

would not live through it.

INTERROGATOR

Sacrifice for the weaker? How

noble... As you wish... Cut off

this one's hand as well!... But

first...

INTERROGATOR

Show them the courage of Allah.

ROBIN

And this is English courage.

PETER

That's for five years of hell.

(CONTINUED)

3.

VOICE (O.S.)

Behind you!

ROBIN

You speak English?

SARACEN

The king's own. Set me free.

PETER

No, Robin.

SARACEN

For pity's sake. Mine is a

sentence of death.

PETER

Don't trust him.

ROBIN

What I would give for an English

sword. This is a pruning hook.

ROBIN

Hmm!   Not bad.

SARACEN

Free me and I will show you a way

out.

(CONTINUED)

4.

ROBIN

Why should we trust you?

SARACEN

If you don't, you are dead men.

ROBIN

He makes a point.

ROBIN

A good point.

PETER

Robin!

ROBIN

Whatever blood is in his veins, he

does not deserve to die here.

SARACEN

This way!

SARACEN

You are fast, my friend.

ROBIN

Five years I've waited for the

smell of free air. That makes a

man fast.

SARACEN

You will need to be yet faster.

(CONTINUED)

5.

SARACEN

Poison air.   Hold your breath.

PETER

(coughing)

Thanks. I misjudged you.

SARACEN

Save your breath.

SARACEN

Allah be praised.

ROBIN

Amen, brother.

ROBIN

God willing, we may now be safe.

(CONTINUED)

6.

ROBIN

Come, Peter.    We must hurry.

PETER

It is mortal.    Leave me.

ROBIN

Hold on to my shoulder.

PETER

My mother... my little sister.

Tell them I love them. Tell them

I died a free Englishman.

SARACEN

His wound is by the heart.    We

cannot save him.

PETER

Take this to my sister. Swear you

will protect her for me... Swear

it, Robin!

ROBIN

(reluctantly)

I swear it.

PETER

For England.

SARACEN

Come now! Do not fail your friend.

Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

7.

ROBIN

Farewell, friend. God speed you

on your way.

SARACEN

Our way is together. With the

speed of Allah.

ROBIN

I go to England.

SARACEN

Then I go to England.

ROBIN

England?   Why?

SARACEN

You saved my life. I must stay

with you until I save yours.

ROBIN

Go your own way. I relieve you of

your obligation.

SARACEN

Only Allah can do that.

ROBIN

And if I don't want you?

SARACEN

You have no choice... unless you

think you can kill me.

SARACEN

My name is Aslan.

ROBIN

Robin of Locksley. You know a

short route to England, Aslan?

CUT TO:

8.

VOICE (O.S.)

Enough of that din, Remus.    I

can't think.

KENNETH

My Lord!   Help me.

DUNCAN

You must wait... I am sorry you

were disturbed, Master.

KENNETH

(high anxiety)

My Lord, please!

LOCKSLEY

It is alright, Duncan.

(to Kenneth)

You are Kenneth of Cowfall?

(CONTINUED)

9.

KENNETH

They've taken my Gwen.    My

daughter.

LOCKSLEY

Who has taken her?

KENNETH

Men on horses. In masks.

(touches his wound)

We tried to stop them. My son is

dead.

DUNCAN

You cannot go alone, Master.      Let

me ride for help.

LOCKSLEY

That may be too late. Kenneth,

lead the way.

DUNCAN

Master, stay!    There is an evil

moon tonight.

LOCKSLEY

Good will overcome, Duncan.      Trust

in that.

CUT TO:

KENNETH

They came this way, my Lord.

LOCKSLEY

Onward then.    What is this place?

(CONTINUED)

10.

KENNETH

Nearby the Gregor Caves.

LOCKSLEY

Steady, man. They are to dissuade

the faint of heart. Think of

Gwen.

KENNETH

Druids.

LOCKSLEY

I trusted we were rid of such evil

a century ago.

KENNETH

(petrified)

Is it the devil?

LOCKSLEY

If it is, I have some Christian

steel that will test his hide.

(CONTINUED)

11.

LOCKSLEY

Gwen?

DEMON

Come, my virgin flower.

DEMON

Kill him!   Kill him!

LOCKSLEY

Gwen!   Up, girl, up!

LOCKSLEY

In the name of God!

(CONTINUED)

12.

LOCKSLEY

Nottingham!

NOTTINGHAM

You are an unwelcome surprise,

Locksley.

LOCKSLEY

The King shall hear of this,

Nottingham.

NOTTINGHAM

I think not.

LOCKSELY

God help us.

NOTTINGHAM

One day all England will worship

with us.

LOCKSLEY

Never.

DEMON

I am Mortianna. You will die with

my name on your lips.

13.

ROBIN

Home.    Thank you, Lord.

ROBIN

My friend, you have escorted me

home. I beg you to free yourself

of your vow. Return with the

boat. I know how heavy your

heart must be, this far from your

family and native land...

ASLAN (SARACEN)

Because I love them so dearly,

I cannot dishonor them.

ROBIN

I thought you'd say that.

ASLAN

No man controls my destiny.

Especially not one who attacks

downwind and stinks of garlic.

ASLAN

If our positions were reversed,

I would have done the same.

Only I would have succeeded.

ROBIN

Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will

celebrate your honor when we dine

with my father.

14.

GISBORNE

You owe the sheriff three bushels

of flax.

FANNY

You starve us. First the drought,

now you take what food we have

left.

GISBORNE

For starving people, you look

fat enough.

SOLDIER

(emerging from

the hut)

He's not here, sir. None but the

woman and children.

GISBORNE

(to Fanny)

Where is your mate? The man

they call Little.

FANNY

He died last winter.

GISBORNE

Is that so? We hear he     is very

much alive. Hiding out     in the

forest. He probably ran     away

to escape your scolding    tongue.

FANNY

Norman swine!

(CONTINUED)

15.

FANNY

No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only

make it worse.

GISBORNE

Seize him!

GISBORNE

This is Lord Nottingham's deer.

Is this how you repay the Sheriff

for his protection?

WULF (BOY)

Like a wolf protects sheep.

FANNY

I killed it.   We needed the meat.

GISBORNE

Poachers hang. Either he dies or

you die.

WULF

My mother lies to protect me.

FANNY

No, Wulf!

GISBORNE

You have deprived us of a hunt,

boy.

GISBORNE

The hounds know the scent well.

GISBORNE

Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us

some pleasure before you die.

(CONTINUED)

16.

GISBORNE

Unleash them!

ROBIN

Why must you walk in back of me?

ASLAN

In your land am I not the infidel?

The unbeliever, the instrument of

evil?

ROBIN

Our races have fought for a

hundred years to prove that point.

ASLAN

Then I trust it is safer to appear

as your slave than as your equal.

ROBIN

For an 'infidel' you have uncommon

clarity of thinking. Yet you

refuse to tell me about your home

and family.

ASLAN

Those are my burdens.

ROBIN

You speak my language. You have

the diplomacy and honor code of

a nobleman. I ask again, why

were you to be executed?

ROBIN

So, I must continue with my

guesswork. You are highborn?

Probably... You fell from favor...

Clearly... Why? You broke the

law? You were a rival for power?

... A woman?

(CONTINUED)

17.

ROBIN

By the Lord, that's it!

ROBIN

They say there are Arab women of

such beauty that they can possess

a man's mind, that he would be

willing to die for them. Is

that not so?

ASLAN

It is close to sunset.

ROBIN

Your people must marry women

chosen for them by others, right?

ROBIN

Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?

... Another man's wife?... That's

it!

ASLAN

Endless clouds. Is there no sun

in your cursed country?

ROBIN

You dog! You painted old dog!

What is her name?

ASLAN

Which way is East?

ROBIN

Her name?

ASLAN

East?

ROBIN

Her name?

ASLAN

East?!!!

(CONTINUED)

18.

ASLAN

Damn you!... Jasmina.

ROBIN

Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?

ASLAN

Which way is East?

ROBIN

That way.

ASLAN

Are you sure?

ROBIN

I would know blindfolded. I'm

five miles from home... Was she

worth it?

ASLAN

Worth dying for.

GISBORNE

You're not playing by    the rules,

boy. Deer don't climb     trees...

Perhaps he thinks he's    a game

bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?

Cut it down!

ROBIN

Hold!... I am curious as to what

manner of creature is so fearsome

that it takes six men to attack

it.

(CONTINUED)

19.

GISBORNE

Stand back, stranger. This is no

affair of yours.

ROBIN

Have we treed the devil himself?

Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.

A truly dangerous animal.

GISBORNE

I advise you to move on, pilgrim.

This is the Sheriff's land.

ROBIN

Wrong. This is my land, and my

tree. Therefore, whatever is in

it also belongs to me.

GISBORNE

I grow dangerously tired of your

wit... Chop it down!

ROBIN

The man who strikes that tree

dies.

GISBORNE

Chop down the hooded fool.

ROBIN

(backing up)

Perhaps we could discuss this.

GISBORNE

Kill him!

ROBIN

Aslan!   It's time to redeem that

vow.

GISBORNE

Set the dogs on him!

(CONTINUED)

20.

ROBIN

Aslan, get off your damn knees!

I have four of them cornered.

ROBIN

I hope there's enough of me to

satisfy you all.

ROBIN

Aslan!!

GISBORNE

Well, hooded stranger, allow me

to know your name before I run you

through.

GISBORNE

Robin of Locksley!

ROBIN

On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray.

GISBORNE

Please, Locksley! No!

(CONTINUED)

21.

ROBIN

Now get off my land. And tell your

cousin the Sheriff what happens to

his scum when they pick on my

people.

ROBIN

(to Aslan,

furious)

You worthless savage! You travel

ten thousand miles to save my life,

then leave me to be butchered.

ASLAN

I will fulfill my vow when I

choose.

ROBIN

Which does not include prayer

times, meal times, or any time

I'm outnumbered six to one!!

ASLAN

You whine like a mule.   You are

still alive.

ROBIN

Barely.

ASLAN

A flesh wound. Why did you let

their leader go?

ROBIN

After six years of the stench of

death, I have no stomach for

needless blood on my hands.

ROBIN

Have no fear, boy.

ASLAN

(laughing)

The conquering hero returns.

(CONTINUED)

22.

ROBIN

Ha!   It was you he was scared of.

ROBIN

Come, my strange friend. Beyond

that hill lies the prettiest

little castle in all Christendom.

Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.

ASLAN

With feather pillows?

ROBIN

With feather pillows. Warm and

soft like Jasmina's embrace.

ROBIN

Father!    Hello!

ROBIN

Noooooo!

ROBIN

I should have been here.

(CONTINUED)

23.

ROBIN

(shaking him)

Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you

cut him down?

DUNCAN

Master Robin, is it you? A

miracle. I thought God had

abandoned us.

ROBIN

You left my father to hang like

a common thief, carrion for the

crows.

ASLAN

Easy... Look at him.

ROBIN

What has happened?

DUNCAN

They say they captured him

worshipping with the Druids. He

signed a confession before the

Bishop of Hereford.

ROBIN

Did they have witnesses?

DUNCAN

Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.

The Bishop decreed all the Locksley

lands forfeit.

ROBIN

Did you believe the charges?

DUNCAN

Not even when they took my eyes.

ROBIN

Who did this to you, Duncan?

DUNCAN

Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff

looking on.

24.

SENTRY

Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to

be disturbed.

GISBORNE

Away, fool.

NOTTINGHAM

Who bade you cover up?

NOTTINGHAM

Cousin, I trust you justify your

intrusion with news of profound

value.

GISBORNE

I met a hooded man today. He bade

me warn you not to harm his

people.

NOTTINGHAM

His name?

GISBORNE

Robin of Locksley.

(CONTINUED)

25.

NOTTINGHAM

Ha! The prodigal son returns. He

is a whelp. This girl could best

him.

GISBORNE

This whelp bested five of my men

in the blink of an eye.

NOTTINGHAM

Your men were probably drunk.   Yet

you survived, cousin?

GISBORNE

(stunned)

You brought her here?

NOTTINGHAM

Quiet!

NOTTINGHAM

What do you see?

MORTIANNA

Change the seat of power.

NOTTINGHAM

London?

MORTIANNA

Change it.

NOTTINGHAM

Move the capitol to Nottingham?

Excellent. How?

(CONTINUED)

26.

MORTIANNA

Ally with royal blood.

NOTTINGHAM

Put someone on the throne and rule

through him? Who?

MORTIANNA

That is not revealed.

NOTTINGHAM

Ally with royal blood. What else

do you see?

MORTIANNA

Armies.

NOTTINGHAM

Whose?

MORTIANNA

Yours. Men and weaponry in great

numgers.

NOTTINGHAM

And victory?

MORTIANNA

Much blood will be spilled.

NOTTINGHAM

Whose?

MORTIANNA

Who have you seen?!

(CONTINUED)

27.

GISBORNE

(freaked)

No one. I have seen no one.

MORTIANNA

You lie!     A man... A painted man.

NOTTINGHAM

What is wrong?

MORTIANNA

I have seen my death.

MORTIANNA

The painted man. He haunts my

dreams.

GISBORNE

Locksley has a companion. A dark-

skinned foreigner. He had the

marked skin of Islam.

MORTIANNA

Kill them!     Kill them!

NOTTINGHAM

Cousin. Prove to Locksley that

your survival was his last mistake.

MORTIANNA

(frantic)

And the painted man! Kill him.

NOTTINGHAM

Kill them both.

NOTTINGHAM

You have done well, Mortianna.

Exceedingly well. No one shall

harm you, I swear it.

(CONTINUED)

28.

NOTTINGHAM

Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses

will seem soft, like an angel's.

(to Mortianna)

Take her. You have earned her.

GISBORNE

It is madness bringing the hag

here.

NOTTINGHAM

Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For

in madness, there is great power.

ROBIN

Our last words in this world were

spoken in anger. He called the

Crusades a foolish quest, said it

was vanity to force other men to

our religion. He was right.

(looks to Aslan,

then back to the

grave)

Please forgive me, Father.

DUNCAN

He loved you till the end, young

master. He never gave up hope of

your return.

ROBIN

I failed him. I should have been

here at his side.

DUNCAN

You must leave, head north to

safety. Gisborne will surely seek

revenge.

ROBIN

Leave me.

(CONTINUED)

29.

DUNCAN

I know what you're thinking. But

one man can achieve nothing

against so many. You would need

an army.

ROBIN

Leave me.

ASLAN

Come, friend.

CUT TO:

DUNCAN

He still stands vigil?

ASLAN

Like a rock.

DUNCAN

A curse on the Saracens! Were it

not for their ungodly ways, he

would never have left. This would

never have happened.

ASLAN

It surprises me that one who

curses others so readily has lived

so long.

DUNCAN

I do not recognize the style of

your voice, friend. Are you

Irish? A Cornishman?

ASLAN

Er... no.

DUNCAN

What manner of name is Aslan then?

ASLAN

A fine Saracen name.

(CONTINUED)

30.

DUNCAN

Lord, no!

ASLAN

Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I

take no offense.

(glances at Robin)

By the prophet! What is the man

doing?

ASLAN

Wait!

ROBIN

I swear by my own blood. I will

not rest until I have restored my

father's name.

(a whisper)

... Or until I am dead.

ROBIN

We make a fine army, do we not,

Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and

a fool.

ASLAN

A fine, wet army. I have never

witnessed a storm of such duration.

When does summer come to this

land?

ROBIN

This is summer.

ASLAN

Then Allah truly is great.

ROBIN

Why, pray?

(CONTINUED)

31.

ASLAN

No food, no shelter,   and weather

that would curse the   end of the

earth. We  will all   quickly be

dead, and I shall be   rid of my

vow.

ROBIN

You despair too soon, Aslan. We

shall find food and shelter here

among friends.

ASLAN

What is this place?

ROBIN

Peter's home. It is nearly seven

years since we left here together.

OLD WOMAN

No beggars!

ROBIN

Open up!

ROBIN

Tell the mistress of the house

that Robin of Locksley is at her

door.

OLD WOMAN

Her ladyship is not at home.

ROBIN

Aagh!

(CONTINUED)

32.

ROBIN

Is the child Marian at home?

OLD WOMAN

Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.

Remove that hand.

ASLAN

The hospitality here is as warm as

the weather.

OLD WOMAN

Leave your weapons.

OLD WOMAN

Just you.

OLD WOMAN

Wait here.

GIRL

Who are you?

ROBIN

I am Robin of Locksley.

GIRL

You lie.     Robin is dead.

ROBIN

I may meet my maker soon from lack

of sustenance. But for now I am

real enough.

(CONTINUED)

33.

GIRL

Step into the light.    Turn around.

ROBIN

By heaven, am I to dance next?

Who are you?

GIRL

I am the maid Marian.

ROBIN

Then show yourself, child.     For we

knew each other well.

GIRL

With the king away, these are

lawless times. There are outlaws

villainous enough to kidnap and

ransom a relative of his.

ROBIN

You know I am not one of them.

Besides, I am sworn to protect

you.

GIRL

(laughs)

Protect me? Robin of Locksley was

nothing but a spoiled bully.

ROBIN

Allow that years of war and prison

may change a man. Step forward,

Marian, so I may see how you have

changed.

ROBIN

Er... the years have been kind.

GIRL

Thank you. Now remove yourself

from this household.

GIRL

(turning away)

As you can see, we are already

well protected.

ROBIN

Wait, Marian!    ...ouch!

(CONTINUED)

34.

ROBIN

You are truly courageous against

an unarmed man.

YOUNG WOMAN

As she was saying, we have

no need of your protection.

ROBIN

Marian.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

35.

MARIAN

I trust Lord Locksley has

recovered from his indisposition.

MARIAN

Why would he wish me to be

protected by the boy who burned

my hair when I was a child?

ROBIN

We were together five terrible

years in a Saracen prison.

MARIAN

How do I know you didn't abandon

him there to save your own skin.

ROBIN

Marian, I'm sorry.

MARIAN

I will forward your condolences

to my mother.

ROBIN

On my return, I found my father

dead. The Sheriff denounced him

as a Druid and took our lands.

MARIAN

The people fear the Druids so much

they'd believe anything.

Nottingham would have me burned at

the stake as a witch if he thought

he could possess my property.

(CONTINUED)

36.

ROBIN

Why do you not join your mother

in London? You would be safer

there.

MARIAN

I will not retreat.     Besides, I

have no interest in    life at court.

Gossip-mongering and    currying

favor. Here I am my     own person.

ROBIN

The you must allow me to be your

guardian.

MARIAN

I do not need a guardian.

MARIAN

My brother is dead. You cannot

take his place.

ROBIN

Marian, I don't want to replace

him.

MARIAN

What do you want?

MARIAN

This is wrong.

ASLAN

Robin! The old man hears horses.

Approaching fast.

ASLAN

Twenty or more. In battle armor.

MARIAN

Soldiers coming here?     Is this

your protection?

(CONTINUED)

37.

ROBIN

I killed some of the Sheriff's

men. I fear I have placed you in

danger.

MARIAN

I can take care of myself. There

are horses in the stable. Go!

ROBIN

I'm not leaving.

MARIAN

Stop them!   They're stealing my

horses!

ROBIN

Damn the girl! Aslan, can you

ride?

ROBIN

He can ride.

GISBORNE

You have been sheltering outlaws,

Lady Marian.

MARIAN

They're thieves, you imbecile.

Bring back my horses, or the

Sheriff will know of your

cowardice.

(CONTINUED)

38.

GISBORNE

You're lucky he didn't steal your

virtue too.

(to his men)

A crown to the man who brings me

Locksley's head.

SOLDIER

A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.

MARIAN

Kiss this!

MARIAN

Try me again, if you want to

leave a hand behind.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Damn you, animal!

ASLAN

Treat it like a woman.

ASLAN

Have you never had a woman?

Gently, man. Soothe it!

(CONTINUED)

39.

ROBIN

Of course I've had a woman!

Come on, pretty one.

ASLAN

Softly.   With your knees.

ROBIN

I know!   I know!

ROBIN

Easy, easy.

ROBIN

I love you!

GISBORNE

(yelling)

Robin of the Hood! Son of the

devil worshipper.

ROBIN

What is your pleasure, Gisborne?

GISBORNE

It was I who strung your father's

corpse to the castle gate. My

pleasure will be in doing the same

to you.

ROBIN

You survived one meeting.    Our next

will be your last.

GISBORNE

Your father died a coward, cursing

your name and squealing like a

stuck pig.

ROBIN

That's a lie!

(CONTINUED)

40.

ASLAN

(shouts)

Come, Robin! He is trying to

anger you into a trap.

ROBIN

We have lost them. I'll lame this

mare if I ask her to go any farther.

ASLAN

Here they come. Look.

(CONTINUED)

41.

ROBIN

Is this Arab magic?

ASLAN

No.    Arab science.

ASLAN

How did your uneducated

kind ever take Jerusalem?

ROBIN

God knows!

ROBIN

We can lose them in the forest.

DUNCAN

Sherwood is haunted, Master.

ROBIN

Either we take our chances

with the ghosts, or become

ghosts ourselves.

ROBIN

They're not following.

GISBORNE

Come on, damn you! There are

only three of them.

SOLDIER

It's not the men we fear, sir.

DUNCAN

Banshees. They say they fly in

your mouth and suck you dry of

blood before you can scream.

(CONTINUED)

42.

ROBIN

Be quiet!    Listen.

ASLAN

Allah protect us from the evil

spirits.

ROBIN

Behind you!

ROBIN

No, there!    And there!

ASLAN

Cease your mad laughing.     I can

feel them.

ROBIN

Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A

child's toy put to good use. You

scare easily, my painted Saladin.

WILL SCARLET

(singing)

Ring around the rosie!

ROBIN

Aslan!

(CONTINUED)

43.

WILL SCARLET

Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall

down. Beg for mercy, rich man.

ROBIN

I beg of no man. Which of you

scum has guts enough to face

me man to man?

VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah, bollocks, mate.

JOHN LITTLE

What are ya, m'old cock?

ROBIN

Er... Robin...

ROBIN

...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are

you?

JOHN LITTLE

John Little.   Bestman o' the

woods.

ROBIN

Bestman?   You lead this rabble?

WILL SCARLET

We waste time. Tax him.

ROBIN

Tax?   For what?

WILL SCARLET

For passage through Sherwood.

ROBIN

I will pay no tax. Besides, I

have nothing but my cloak and

my sword.

(CONTINUED)

44.

WILL SCARLET

A man who travels with two servants

and claims he's without money, is

either a fool or a liar.

WILL SCARLET

And this one is a liar.

(he bites the metal)

Ahah! Gold!

ROBIN

That is sacred to me.

JOHN LITTLE

Sacred to us too, mush. This

here'll feed us for a bloomin'

month.

ROBIN

You will have to fight me for it.

JOHN LITTLE

I'd love to, mate.

WULF

Wait, father!    I know him.

ROBIN

This man is your father? Tell him

how I saved your hide from the

Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves

some gratitude, I believe.

JOHN LITTLE

Naw ya don't, laddie.

WILL SCARLET

You must be Robin of Locksley.

The blackguard who abandoned us to

Nottingham's plundering.

(CONTINUED)

45.

WULF

Be careful, Father. He fights

like a demon. He walloped six o'

Sheriff's men?

JOHN LITTLE

Is that so?

ROBIN

Aslan!

WILL SCARLET

Oh dear! The little rich boy is

lost for words. Thanks for the

taxes, Locksley.

JOHN LITTLE

And for the laughs.

ROBIN

Son of an Arab whore! Once again

your assistance was invaluable.

ASLAN

You seemed more in danger of losing

your pride than your life.

DUNCAN

I recognized some of the voices.

Many were from your father's farms.

ASLAN

Your avenging army, my friend.

ROBIN

That rabble?

ASLAN

All they need is a leader.

(CONTINUED)

46.

ROBIN

They have a leader.   A very large

one.

ASLAN

Defeat him and they will follow

you.

ROBIN

Allah has taken your brains.

DUNCAN

I hear the voice of a spoiled

child, Master Robin. I suggest

you cease your brave talk of

revenge and flee to the north.

ROBIN

You, too? You expect me to

fight that behemoth?

DUNCAN

Your father would expect you to

act like a man.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

This is my bridge. No one crosses

without paying tax.

JOHN LITTLE

Just bugger off, mate, huh?

ROBIN

If you wish to cross, it will

cost you a gold medallion.

JOHN LITTLE

Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff

for one day?

WILL SCARLET

If he's in a hurry to end his

mortal misery, help him.

(CONTINUED)

47.

ROBIN

You don't have the courage to

face me again, John Little? Or

should I call you 'Little John'?

JOHN LITTLE

Alright, m'old cock. You wanna

nuther good wallopin'?

JOHN LITTLE

Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?

WILL SCARLET

Don't fool with him. Get him!

JOHN LITTLE

Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.

(CONTINUED)

48.

JOHN LITTLE

Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave

'un.

JOHN LITTLE

Help!   Cain't bloody swim.

ROBIN

Do you yield?

ROBIN

Do you yield?

JOHN LITTLE

Yes!

ROBIN

Good.   Now put your feet down.

JOHN LITTLE

I'll be buggered.

ROBIN

Pay me the tax.

JOHN LITTLE

Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid

rock.

LITTLE JOHN

Mead.   Made it m'self.

(CONTINUED)

49.

ROBIN

(drinks)

A fine brew, Little John.

LITTLE JOHN

Real honey.

ASLAN

With regrets, I decline.

LITTLE JOHN

An Englishman's mead not bleedin'

good enough for ya?

ASLAN

On the contrary. I thank you,

but my faith prevents me from

partaking in such enjoyments.

LITTLE JOHN

Your bloody loss, mate.

LITTLE JOHN

What is it, boy? Speak up!

WULF

I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley.

I owes ya m'life.

ROBIN

You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am

glad I chanced by in time to help.

LITTLE JOHN

C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put

hair on your bloomin' chest.

ROBIN

Tell me about your men, John.

(CONTINUED)

50.

LITTLE JOHN

This stumpy one 'ere's David o'

Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull.

ROBIN

How do you come by the name, Bull?

BULL

'Cuz o' my size, Sire.

ROBIN

Because you are short?

BULL

Nay.   'Cuz I be so long.

ROBIN

No, Bull.    Save it for the ladies.

ROBIN

Your name, friend?

LITTLE JOHN

That be Hal Brownwell, but the

lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.

ROBIN

Hold! Hal, you have the face and

hands of a farmer. I wager you

are a strong and honest man, and

I'd be glad to have you at my side

in a fight. The next man who makes

light of you will have to answer

to me.

ROBIN

How is it there are so many of

you in hiding?

(CONTINUED)

51.

LITTLE JOHN

We're outlaws. Got prices on our

'eads, every man jack. Blasted

Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.

ROBIN

How do you fare?

LITTLE JOHN

We get by, I reckon.

ROBIN

While the Sheriff steals your

land and your families starve?

LITTLE JOHN

What in bloody blazes'd ya have

us do?

ROBIN

Your ghosts will only keep his

men at bay so long, my friend.

Soon the Sheriff will hunt you

down and hang you. You must

fight back.

LITTLE JOHN

We show as much as a toe outside

the forest, they'll slaughter us

like bleedin' sheep.

ROBIN

We must organize. Win by guile.

LITTLE JOHN

'We'? Ya lookin' to join us,

matie?

ROBIN

No.   To lead you.

WILL SCARLET

Ha! I would never be led by the

son of a Druid.

ROBIN

There are many here who knew my

father to be a kind and generous

man. I doubt that in their hearts

they believe him capable of such a

horror.

(CONTINUED)

52.

ROBIN

What is your name, friend?

WILL SCARLET

Count me not a friend, Locksley.

LITTLE JOHN

Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will.

The man's our guest.

LITTLE JOHN

That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im

no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.

ROBIN

He is right to distrust me. I am

a rich man's son. I have done no

honest labor. But today I am as

poor as any of you. Nottingham

has stolen all that I own. And

when I killed Gisborne's men, I,

too, became an outlaw.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all,

mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish

agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army?

Ya must be bloody jokin'.

ROBIN

We can win.   And I believe we will.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood,

but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give

ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz

tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky!

Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack

that blasted noble head in two.

(CONTINUED)

53.

ASLAN

(gloomily)

I have led you wrong. This is no

army. These men live like dogs.

ROBIN

English dogs.    They can learn.

ASLAN

Learn what?   To build kennels?

ROBIN

Too much mead, old friend.    What

day is it?

DUNCAN

Sunday, I believe.

ROBIN

Good. Do they still give alms

to the poor at the mass?

DUNCAN

They do. These days the need for

mercy is greater than ever.

ROBIN

Then I must ask you a favor.

GUARD

Hey, you!

(CONTINUED)

54.

GUARD

Do I know you?

GUARD

My God, you stink!

ROBIN

Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm

always falling down.

GUARD

Yeech!   Get away from me.

BISHOP

We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on

all your people, but most

especially on our noble Lord

Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom

to guide and protect our glorious

city.

BISHOP

Grant him also the strength to

bring to justice the lawless men

who threaten its safety. Help

him to stamp out the curse of the

dread Druids who would seize from

us our children, even as wolves

steal the lambs from their mothers.

(CONTINUED)

55.

VARIOUS

1.   Alms!

2.   Have mercy, milady.

3.   Pity, fine sir.

4.   For my baby.

5.   Etc.

ROBIN

Alms for a blind man. For one

who cannot see your beauty.

MARIAN

(recognizing him)

This is dangerous.

ROBIN

So you care for my safety?

MARIAN

No, for mine. I do not wish

to be seen with an outlaw.

ROBIN

Under the Sheriff's law, that's

a badge of pride.

MARIAN

He's put a price on your head.

ROBIN

How much?

MARIAN

A hundred gold pieces.

ROBIN

Is that all? I have not annoyed

him enough. Soon he will offer

ten thousand.

MARIAN

For ten thousand I would turn you

in myself.

(glances back at

the Sheriff)

Nottingham is mounting an army.

ROBIN

How do you know?

(CONTINUED)

56.

MARIAN

He has rounded up every blacksmith

in the county. He has them holed

up in the castle making swords and

armor.

ROBIN

What is he planning?

MARIAN

I don't know, but there's no limit

to the man's ambitions.

(as Sheriff heads

towards them)

Go!

ROBIN

If you need me, I will be with

the woodsmen. Send for me as

'Robin Hood.'

MARIAN

Robin!   Do something for me.

ROBIN

What?

MARIAN

Take a bath.

ROBIN

Care to join me?

NOTTINGHAM

You shine like the sun, my lady.

NOTTINGHAM

You have been meeting with young

Robin of Locksley.

(as she tries to

hide her shock)

My cousin tells me the knave

deprived you of some horses.

MARIAN

(recovering)

Yes. A most disagreeable

experience.

(CONTINUED)

57.

NOTTINGHAM

I deeply regret it, and I promise

you he will be brought to justice.

For subjecting you to such

treatment, I will hang him from

the walls with his own entrails.

MARIAN

I would like to see that, my lord.

NOTTINGHAM

My dear, a woman of your refinement

is not safe living alone. If you

would consent to bring your

household within the city walls,

I could give your needs my most

personal attention.

MARIAN

I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from

the heart, but for now I prefer to

stay in my family's ancestral home.

My cousin, King Richard, will be

deeply moved to hear of your

concern for my welfare.

NOTTINGHAM

Alas, the King has many enemies

both abroad and at home. I fear

for his safe return.

MARIAN

Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will

return. When he does, he will

wish to reward his faithful subjects.

BEGGAR

(Robin)

Alms, my lord.

(CONTINUED)

58.

ROBIN

A hundred crowns, Sheriff?   You

insult me.

ROBIN

Remember young Robin of Locksley,

Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your

nemesis. Your avenging angel.

NOTTINGHAM

If you kill me, you will hang.

ROBIN

If I kill you, I will hang happy.

NOTTINGHAM

What do you want?

ROBIN

I want to give you a chance. A

chance you do not deserve. A

chance to right your wrongs.

NOTTINGHAM

I'm listening.

ROBIN

From this day forward you will

cease to tax my people. You will

renounce the charges against my

father, and you will return his

lands to me.

NOTTINGHAM

Why should I?

ROBIN

Because for every harm you do,

I swear by God I shall visit on

you threefold in return.

NOTTINGHAM

Empty words.

ROBIN

I am here with a blade at your

throat. As long as I live, you

will always know that I could be

here again.

(CONTINUED)

59.

ROBIN

Your answer?

NOTTINGHAM

Never, fool.

ROBIN

Then it will begin..

MARIAN

(innocently)

Please excuse my clumsiness.

ROBIN

A personal loan from the Sheriff.

ASLAN

(furious)

You should not have left without

me, Englishman.

ROBIN

How so? You have not raised a

finger to protect me.

ASLAN

Before I had a choice.

ROBIN

It was my choice to do this alone.

(CONTINUED)

60.

ASLAN

A foolish risk. If you had been

killed, I would be cursed for

eternity for failing to fulfil

my pledge.

ROBIN

Aslan, if I didn't know better,

I would swear you were worried

about me.

NOTTINGHAM

Starve them out. Slaughter their

livestock. I want to see Locksley's

own people fighting each other to

bring him to us.

GISBORNE

I swear he will not live to see

the next full moon.

FARMER

Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the

sow. She's with young 'uns. The

next litter'll feed us through

the winter.

SOLDIER

You've heard of Robin Hood?

FARMER

Yes, sir.

SOLDIER

Then pray he is brought to us

before winter.

(CONTINUED)

61.

WILL SCARLET

You brought this misery on us,

Locksley. We can barely feed

ourselves.

LITTLE JOHN

Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody

pot to piss in.

ROBIN

Then we shall take from him and

his rich friends.

WILL SCARLET

Brave talk, Locksley. I say we

take the rich boy in.

ROBIN

Will, do you think the Sheriff will

give everything back after I am

gone?

WILL SCARLET

He will give us the reward, and

our pardons.

ROBIN

Alright, Will. You can take me

in on one condition. You must

fight me. You may use the Sheriff's

horse and arm yourself as you

please. I will fight on foot.

Unarmed.

WILL SCARLET

Unarmed?

ROBIN

If you lose, you will accept me

as your leader. If you win, you

may take me in. Dead or alive.

WILL SCARLET

Dead, Locksley.

CUT TO:

62.

ASLAN

This man has true purpose.    He

means to kill you.

DUNCAN

And you have given him the means.

WULF

Will is ruthless, Robin.    Guard

your back.

ROBIN

I am grateful for your concern,

friends, but I have to prove to

them it is possible to overcome

unequal odds.

(shouts)

I am ready, Will.

(CONTINUED)

63.

ROBIN

Come on, you little piss pot.

Do your worst!

ROBIN

The horse is smarter than you are,

Will.

ROBIN

Here, Will!   You aim like a girl,

Will!

ROBIN

Thank the Lord you are not endowed

like Bull.

LITTLE JOHN

Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,

eh?

LITTLE JOHN

Ya got us by the short and curlies,

Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya

got to bleedin' say.

(CONTINUED)

64.

ROBIN

Nottingham has taken from us

everything we own. Now we are

going to start taking from him.

LITTLE JOHN

'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna

do that?

ROBIN

We are going to tax him.

DISSOLVE TO:

ASLAN

Here they come.

ROBIN

How many?

ASLAN

Two wagons.   Twenty escort.

ROBIN

Twenty?   They usually have five.

ROBIN

This is no ordinary convoy.

BULL

'ow many?

(CONTINUED)

65.

ROBIN

Er, about ten.

(then, to Aslan)

Why scare them? They can't count

anyway.

ASLAN

And they call me the barbarian.

ROBIN

Let's go.

(CONTINUED)

66.

ROBIN

Surrender your weapons. I give

you my word you shall go free.

ROBIN

Ah, I feared as much.

CUT TO:

LITTLE JOHN

(awestruck)

I'll be buggered.

ROBIN

This treasure had a purpose.     We

must find out what.

ROBIN

Get off him.   He's a man of the

cloth.

(CONTINUED)

67.

FRIAR

The Lord's blessing on you, kind

sir. These sinners were attempting

to steal these libations destined

for the monks of St. Catherine's.

ROBIN

It appears to me, Reverend Friar,

that many of the libations have

found their way into your own

esteemed person.

FRIAR

A thousand pardons, sir, but duty

beckons. I must hasten on.

ROBIN

(grabbing the bridle)

A moment, my reverend friend. You

travel with poor company when you

travel with Nottingham's soldiers.

BULL

Aye, tax him.

ROBIN

My men are thirsty and have much

to celebrate.

FRIAR

Lord bless me, sir, are these your

men? I had mistook them for

common thieves. Kindly step

aside.

ROBIN

Surely the Lord has the charity to

spare a few barrels to good

Christian men.

FRIAR

Well, sir, if you wish them to

share in the good Lord's brew...

(CONTINUED)

68.

FRIAR

... you must best me for it.

FRIAR

Giddyup, nag!

ROBIN

You leave when I say.

FRIAR

Protect me, Lord.

FRIAR

Yield!

FRIAR

Confess that Friar Tuck is a

better, holier, and braver man

than thou art, knave.

ROBIN

Never!   Whoomf!

FRIAR

Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar

Tuck.

ROBIN

Yield yourself!

(CONTINUED)

69.

ROBIN

Yield to Robin Hood.

FRIAR

(feeling his head)

Thank you, Lord, for teaching me

humility.

ROBIN

Well, Friar Tuck. We have need

of an honest man of God, to

minister to these men and their

families. What do you say?

FRIAR

I'd rather roast in hell.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Giddyup, Friar.

ROBIN

What do you say now, Tuck?    Here

are the meek of the earth.

FRIAR

The Lord moves in mysterious

ways. I accept.

(CONTINUED)

70.

ROBIN

You will not regret it.

FRIAR

Aye, but you may.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.

FARMER

Thankee, Robin.

LITTLE JOHN

Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa

'em, Rob.

BULL

They'd be spittin' it out good

if they'd knowed anythin'.

LITTLE JOHN

Reckon the Cap'n knows summat, Rob,

but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is.

ASLAN

Perhaps it is time for some

heathen persuasion.

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN

Spare your breath. I know nothing.

ROBIN

(reasonable)

I believe you. But this Arab here,

he's got it into his barbarian

brain that you know a whole lot

more than nothing.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

71.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

And when he gets like this,

he's very hard to reason with.

ROBIN

I strongly advise you to talk.

He hasn't eaten in weeks.

CAPTAIN

(rising terror)

What does he want?

ROBIN

You.

CAPTAIN

For Godsakes, get him off me!

ROBIN

(very deliberately)

No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.

... How about this other one?...

Fatter, yes... more meat.

LITTLE JOHN

(urgent)

No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'

men.

ROBIN

I cannot stop him, John. Besides,

if they will not tell what they

know, then they must pay the price.

LITTLE JOHN

Kill 'em aye, but not like this.

'Tain't Christian.

(CONTINUED)

72.

CAPTAIN

What does he say?

ROBIN

Well, roughly, he says that he

doesn't care for the way your

friend tastes, and he wants you.

CAPTAIN

No, God, no! I'll talk. Just

keep him away. Keep him away!

LITTLE JOHN

Sure changed the color of 'is

britches, didn't 'e?

ROBIN

Thanks to our cannibal friend.

LITTLE JOHN

Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.

BULL

Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold

north o' the border?

ROBIN

To hire mercenaries. The Celts

are savage tribesmen, trained

to kill from birth.

(CONTINUED)

73.

LITTLE JOHN

Aye, the Romans built a bleedin'

great wall to keep 'em out.

BULL

What does 'e want wi 'em?

ROBIN

Since he also has every Smith

in the country working in his

castle, we can assume he is

planning a little war.

LITTLE JOHN

Agin' who?

ASLAN

England.

GISBORNE

We were ambushed. In Sherwood

Forest.

NOTTINGHAM

Spanish steel, cousin. So much

stronger than our native blades.

Any losses?

GISBORNE

All the men are gone.

NOTTINGHAM

Yet again you are the sole

survivor, cousin? Interesting.

And the gold?

GISBORNE

Well, it er... disappeared.

(CONTINUED)

74.

NOTTINGHAM

Robin Hood?

GISBORNE

They were woodsmen, dressed in

green.

NOTTINGHAM

Robin Hood.

NOTTINGHAM

Cousin, we must be strong. We

cannot allow this outlaw to make

fools of us.

NOTTINGHAM

And I cannot allow a lieutenant

to fail me.

(turning to the

horrified smithy)

It is indeed fine steel.

FRIAR

God bless you, sir.

VILLAGER

An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar.

They says as 'ow none o' the

Sheriff's cronies dare go within

miles o' Sherwood for fear o'

havin' their pockets pinched.

FRIAR

Ah, the good Lord giveth and the

good Lord taketh away.

OLD WOMAN

Unless Robin Hood takes it first!

(CONTINUED)

75.

FRIAR

Good morrow, brothers.

MARIAN

(to Robin)

How dare you!

ROBIN

Good morning, Lady Marian.

MARIAN

You send men to drag me from my

home in the middle of the night,

like some slave girl? Is this

the way the famous Robin Hood

treats a lady?

ROBIN

Ah well... er, let me finish this

bath you wished me to take. Then

I'll explain.

MARIAN

I demand an explanation right now!

ROBIN

If you will be patient, I could

spare your propriety by...

MARIAN

I will decide when my propriety

is compromised.

ROBIN

As you wish.

(CONTINUED)

76.

MARIAN

How dare you expose yourself to

me?!

BULL

The big 'un did the same to me.

LITTLE JOHN

(to Wulf)

Right m'lad. Let's see how close

you can git to that bugger.

LITTLE JOHN

Take a gander at this 'un, mates.

Never seen nuthin' like it in

my bloomin' life.

MARIAN

This better be damned important.

ROBIN

Nottingham robs the poor. We

rob Nottingham and give back to

the poor.

(CONTINUED)

77.

MARIAN

Do you think he's going to let

you get away with all this? The

man is without mercy. He will

annihilate you.

ROBIN

Somebody has to take a stand.

MARIAN

You're taking a stand with the

lives of these people. These

young ones.

MARIAN

What do you want from me?

ROBIN

Nottingham was sending this gold

to buy reinforcements from the

Celtic tribesmen. We need to

warn King Richard.

MARIAN

Nottingham would not dare

challenge the King.

ROBIN

The King is not in England to

be challenged, is he? While he

is away, he may lose his country.

(Marian masks her

concern)

You are Richard's cousin. You

can get word to him. He would

believe you.

MARIAN

Now you want me to participate

in your folly?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

78.

ROBIN

(to Marian)

I am sending Duncan with you.

Give him some warm food and a

real bed. I grow tired of his

bellyaching.

DUNCAN

Hah! I have endured more hardship

in my lifetime than any man here.

ROBIN

Don't tell him I told you, but

he may be useful to you. There

is no one to whom I would rather

entrust your safety.

MARIAN

Duncan, you are most welcome.

ROBIN

(calls after her)

Will you send word to the King?

MARIAN

I'll think about it.

MARIAN

It is a personal matter, my Lord,

but one of vital importance.

BISHOP

I understand, my dear lady.

This is my most trusted emissary.

(CONTINUED)

79.

MARIAN

You will travel to France

immediately. You must give this

directly into the hands of the

King, and him alone.

MARIAN

My lady-in-waiting will accompany

you.

BISHOP

My dear, I could not vouch for

her safety. The journey is fraught

with danger.

MARIAN

I appreciate your concern, my

Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished

rider. I must insist that she

goes along.

BISHOP

(a beat)

As you wish.

ROBIN

We have to be ready to move camp

at any time. The only way we can

be attacked is from the Nottingham

Road. We hide lookouts in the

trees, here and here. If they

see soldiers, they shoot warning

arrows. Whistles by day, fire

by night.

WULF

Father!   Come quick.   Mother's

dying.

80.

FRIAR

The child comes early.

LITTLE JOHN

Hush, m'lass.    Ya'll be fine.

FANNY

'S not like t'others, John.    Oh

God, it pains me so.

LITTLE JOHN

(angrily, to Tuck)

Ya're sittin' thar like a fat

sow. Help her, man, help her!

FRIAR

I am doing all I can.

ASLAN

By Allah, leeches!

FRIAR

Get away from her!

ASLAN

Blood is like air. If she loses

blood, she and the child will die.

FRIAR

He lies. He is the devil's seed,

sent to lead us astray.

ASLAN

Fool, both the Bible and the Koran

instruct us to preserve life.

(CONTINUED)

81.

ASLAN

(soothing)

Your baby has not turned. It

cannot be born without help.

FRIAR

What do you know, you damned

savage?

ASLAN

(to John)

If you will allow me, I can help

her. It will not be without

danger.

FRIAR

Do not listen to him!   He will

kill her.

ASLAN

If you do not listen to me, she

will certainly die. And the

child, too.

ROBIN

The good Friar has done all he

can. I suggest you let the Arab

try.

(as John is

undecided)

If I am wrong, and they die, then

you may take my life.

LITTLE JOHN

So be it.

FRIAR

Then it will be on your head.

I have warned you.

ASLAN

Bring me a needle, thread, water,

a skinning knife, and burning

ashes.

(CONTINUED)

82.

ROBIN

What are you going to do?

ASLAN

The child must be taken out by

the knife.

ROBIN

The knife?

ASLAN

I have seen it many times with

horses.

ROBIN

Horses? By the Lord, what are

her chances?

ASLAN

After wasting so much blood...

not good.

ROBIN

Now you tell me!

ASLAN

(to Fanny)

Are you ready?... Bite down on

this... Robin, hold her steady.

FRIAR

I tell you, the barbarian is

killing her.

ROBIN

Is she gone?

(CONTINUED)

83.

ROBIN

What did you say?

ASLAN

It is a boy.

ASLAN

Your son, my lady... Robin, hold

her skin together while I sew her

up.

lesson.

I would be honored.

We shall open a barrel together

ASLAN

Alas, I am not permitted...

Our God made this brew, brother.

I merely combined the ingredients.

Do you dare to insult his works?

SARAH

What is wrong?

My horse seems to be favoring

We meet again.

SOLDIER

Drop your blade.

You are still overmatched, soldier.

SOLDIER

You owe me favors, wench. Bare

your breasts... or I will do it

DUNCAN

I am sorry, my lady.    There were

too many.

MARIAN

Is there something you need,

gentlemen? I remember no masked

ball on my calendar.

REDHEAD BARON

Forget about Locksley. He is no

NOTTINGHAM

How can we control all England if

we cannot control our own county?

The people are turning him into

a hero.

GREYBEARD BARON

It is impossible to attack him

in the forest. We have tried

everything. He is cunning.

NOTTINGHAM

Then we   will be more cunning. I

must be   rid of him. We may not

be able   to intercept his next

warning   to the King.

CELTIC CHIEFTAIN

I want the heads of the men who

stole my gold.

NOTTINGHAM

Welcome, sir. We were discussing

how to rid ourselves of those very

men. The outlaws who band with

Robin Hood.

REDHEAD BARON

My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.

It is a mistake to ally ourselves

with foreigners.

GREYBEARD BARON

What can these Celts do that we

cannot?

(CONTINUED)

87.

NOTTINGHAM

This rat Hood has hidden out in

the forest.  He resists all our

assaults with traps and devices,

while he robs us blind. We must

bring him out and destroy him.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRIAR

Come, you son of Saladin. A toast

to all of Jehovah's children. The

saved and the damned.

ASLAN

This must be a truly evil potion,

to make the soul feel this good.

ASLAN

Come, holy man. A toast to all

of Allah's children. The true

believers and the fat infidels.

(CONTINUED)

88.

FRIAR

How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem

when they can't even hold their

brew?

DISSOLVE TO:

ROBIN

The dancing demon! Good morning.

ASLAN

(wincing)

If it was Jehovah who created this

brew, he is truly wise. He built

the punishment into the crime.

ROBIN

They need help.

BULL

A bloke wearin' a mask o' the

Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.

ROBIN

Are you sure it was a Druid mask?

(as Bull nods)

Damn them to hell! They must have

Marian. Do you know where they

meet?

(CONTINUED)

89.

BULL

The Gregor Caves, I 'eard tell.

ASLAN

We will go there.

ROBIN

No! You stay here, dammit!    I

will go alone.

ASLAN

You forget yourself.   I am not

your servant.

ROBIN

Then be my friend. There are

women and children here in greater

need of your courage.

ASLAN

(considers)

Take my eyes, then.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

(under his breath)

Marian!

(CONTINUED)

90.

VOICE (O.S.)

Robin!... Robin!

MARIAN

Death is not to be feared,

Robin. Embrace it.

MARIAN

Drink this.

MARIAN

Drink.

MARIAN

Look at me. Listen to me. You

belong to me. Your soul is mine.

You will obey my every word. Do

you understand?

ROBIN

Why, Marian?

(CONTINUED)

91.

MARIAN

Because you love me. Say it.

You love me.

(as Robin struggles)

Say it!

ROBIN

(sinking)

I love you.

MARIAN

Kiss me.

ROBIN

(slurred)

Where is Marian?

MORTIANNA

She is with friends.

(cackles)

Your resistence is strong, but

useless. Sign this.

(as quill is forced

into his hand)

You are a Druid like your father.

You consort with the devil. Your

confession will be witnessed by

the Bishop of Hereford.

MORTIANNA

(horror)

The painted man!

(CONTINUED)

92.

ASLAN

Behind you!

ROBIN

(groggy)

Marian?

BULL

Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian

burial. Promise me, boy.

WULF

I promise.

ASLAN

They have poisoned you. There

are herbs that can alter a man's

brain. I know of only one cure.

(CONTINUED)

93.

ASLAN

It worked for me this very

morning.

(as Robin heaves)

You will thank me for this later.

ROBIN

You have fulfilled your vow.   Now

you can leave.

ASLAN

Your gratitude warms my heart.

ROBIN

You ignored my request.

ASLAN

It is fortunate that I did.

ROBIN

Because of you, another good man

is dead.

ASLAN

He urged me to bring him. He was

a brave man and I grieve for him.

Praise be to Allah that I do not

grieve for you also. Or for my

broken vow.

ROBIN

To hell with your damn vow.

ASLAN

I am glad you are feeling

better.

ROBIN

The forest!   Ride!

94.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke

ain't gonna kill ya.

WILL SCARLET

(running up)

It's burning for miles, John.

It's hotter than hades, and them

damn screens ain't worth nothing.

LITTLE JOHN

'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must

make a stand.

LITTLE JOHN

Damn y'all! Ya're no more use

than a load o' wet farts.

WILL SCARLET

Where's that damn Locksley?   I'll

Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody

HAL

Cccc... elts!

WILL SCARLET

Celts?   Where?

HAL

(pointing behind

him)

Gggg... God help us.

NOTTINGHAM

I want prisoners.

CHIEFTAIN

We came to fight.

NOTTINGHAM

Nevertheless, I need prisoners.

WILL SCARLET

What are we gonna do, John?

(CONTINUED)

96.

LITTLE JOHN

Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight

'em, that's what. Whadya say,

lads?

LITTLE JOHN

Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin'

wi' the wenches.

FRIAR

This holy man believes in doing

God's work with his hands.

LITTLE JOHN

Let's give 'em a bloody good

wallopin' an' all, lads.

ROBIN

Wulf, stay here. I need your

horse.

ROBIN

What are you doing?    Out of my

way!

ASLAN

I saved your life. I will not

let you give it away for no

purpose.

ROBIN

Out of my way, damn you!

ASLAN

Does the witch still have

possession of your senses? If

we meet up with the survivors we

may yet give them some help. And

do some damage to the enemy.

(CONTINUED)

97.

FRIAR

Surely you would not harm a man

of the cloth?

FRIAR

You would?   Then to hellfire with

you.

LITTLE JOHN

'Bout bleedin' time, mush.

FRIAR

Thank you, Lord.

(an afterthought)

And thank you, Allah.

(CONTINUED)

98.

LITTLE JOHN

Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,

ya li'l bugger.

LITTLE JOHN

Don't 'ee start bleedin'

blubberin', or ya'll make me

bloody vomit.

ASLAN

It was a fiendish mind that

planned this campaign.

(CONTINUED)

99.

ROBIN

You were an honor to your

countrymen today, Aslan. You

fought better than twenty

English knights.

ASLAN

This war is the God of Abraham

against the forces of evil.

ROBIN

Well, the war is over.

ROBIN

There is too much blood on my

hands.

NOTTINGHAM

(wry smile)

Would you prefer pain or death?

FIRST WOODSMAN

Death.

NOTTINGHAM

Torture him.

NOTTINGHAM

And you?   Pain or death?

SECOND WOODSMAN (PRISONER)

(pure terror)

... Er... pain.

NOTTINGHAM

Torture him... you see, it makes

no difference.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

100.

NOTTINGHAM (CONT'D)

You will all be tortured. You will

all tell me all you know about

Robin Hood, and then you will all

be hanged. Then we will catch your

beloved Robin Hood and do the same

to him.

WILL SCARLET

I will kill him for you.

WULF

Will, no!

NOTTINGHAM

Why would I need you?

WILL SCARLET

All your attempts to kill him

have failed. Your army failed.

Your Celtic mercenaries failed.

NOTTINGHAM

And you can succeed?

WILL SCARLET

I am one of his men. He would

never suspect me.

WULF

He knows you always hated him,

traitor.

WILL SCARLET

He is a trusting fool. He will

believe me. If he doesn't, he

will kill me and you have lost

nothing.

NOTTINGHAM

If you fail, I will personally

cut out your lying tongue.

WILL SCARLET

And if I succeed?

(CONTINUED)

101.

NOTTINGHAM

His friends will..

(to a guard)

... torture him!

NOTTINGHAM

It will look better.

ROBIN

My pride brought us to this.

ASLAN

No, friend. It was you who gave

these men pride.

ROBIN

I gave them nothing but false

hope. Tomorrow we will disperse.

These people can move south and

start over. You must go home and

win your Jasmina.

ASLAN

And you?

ROBIN

I am no longer your responsibility.

ASLAN

That is for me to decide.

ROBIN

(raging)

Damn you, Arab. I want you out of

my life. Can't you understand

that? Go home. Go back to your

own kind.

(CONTINUED)

102.

ROBIN

Damn you, too, Father.   You reared

a coward and a fool.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MARIAN

Kiss me, Robin.

LOCKSLEY

Why have you betrayed me?   Why?

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

103.

ROBIN

Will!    I thought you were taken.

WILL SCARLET

I was.

ROBIN

How did you escape?

WILL SCARLET

I promised to kill you.

ROBIN

And will you?

LITTLE JOHN

I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will

Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a

bloody favor an' all.

FANNY

Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im

if Wulf be still alive.

WILL SCARLET

Y... e...

LITTLE JOHN

Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put

the bleedin' weasel outa 'is

misery.

ROBIN

John, wait.    Let us hear what he

has to say.

LITTLE JOHN

No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff,

'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin'

pockets.

(CONTINUED)

104.

ROBIN

A traitor sneaks in and out under

cover of darkness. Will walked in

and announced himself.

LITTLE JOHN

(dismissive)

Aye.    'E always did 'ave balls o'

brass.

HAL

Let's sss... string 'im up.

ROBIN

Let him speak.

LITTLE JOHN

Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a

bloody blade on 'im somewheres.

LITTLE JOHN

Bugger me.

WILL SCARLET

I bring a message from Nottingham.

Our men are to be hung in the

square on Saturday. At high noon.

FANNY

What about my boy?

WILL SCARLET

The boy, too.    Ten men in all.

WILL SCARLET

Their   deaths are a warning.

Anyone   who associates with the

outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same

fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even

anyone   who so much as utters his

name.

(CONTINUED)

105.

FRIAR

Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin

Hood!

(chuckles)

May as well be hung for a sheep as

a lamb.

WILL SCARLET

The hangings are to be part of the

celebration for the Sheriff's

marriage.

LITTLE JOHN

Marriage, eh? What lucky wench

gits to play with the Sheriff's

codpiece?

WILL SCARLET

Lady Marian.

FRIAR

He takes a bride of royal blood?

LITTLE JOHN

Aye, and then with King Richard

gone, he takes the bloody throne.

ROBIN

You were to use this news to get

close to me, and then kill me?

Right, Will?

WILL SCARLET

(sly grin)

Not straightway, of course.

ROBIN

What is your intention, Will?

WILL SCARLET

That depends on you, Locksley.

ROBIN

How so?

WILL SCARLET

I've never trusted you, that's no

secret. What I wanna know is, are

you gonna finish what you started?

(CONTINUED)

106.

WILL SCARLET

Will ya stay and keep us fightin'

till every man jack of us is dead?

Or will you run like the spoiled

little rich boy I always took you

for?

ROBIN

You present quite a choice.    What

would you have me do, Will?

WILL SCARLET

If you run, I will kill you.

ROBIN

And if I stay, will you all stay

with me?

ASLAN

To the end, friend.

FRIAR

If my heathen brother stays, I

stay.

HAL

Mmmm... meee... tttt...

LITTLE JOHN

'E's in. We're all bloody in.

Daft buggers.

ROBIN

There's your answer, Will.    We

finish it.

107.

WULF

If it be your biddin' that this be

my last night o' life, Lord, gimme

the pluck to die proud. An' look

'ee kindly on my folks an' the

young 'uns.

DISSOLVE TO:

FRIAR

Lord, grant us the courage to

endure, and if you're as smart as

I believe you are, grant us

victory... and the victuals to

celebrate it with.

FRIAR

Will you pray with me, son of

Allah?

ASLAN

I have prayed for you, often, my

brother. But, let us put prayer

aside and help our gods in a more

practical manner. I must reveal

to you the mysteries of the black

powder.

(CONTINUED)

108.

ROBIN

Will it work?

ROBIN

(impressed)

You are truly a wizard.

ASLAN

There is no such thing. But if

there was...

(chuckles)

... I would surely be one.

ROBIN

We have no armored knights, no

glorious banners. But I am

honored to be going to battle in

this company. Today we fight not

just for the lives of our friends,

but to save all England.

ROBIN

We may be only six men, but...

FANNY

Seven!

LITTLE JOHN

What in blazes ya doin', woman?

Where's the little 'uns?

FANNY

Them's safe, wi' my mother.

(pushes past Little

John)

Robin, I been to town an' seen the

scaffold and the guard towers.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?

(CONTINUED)

109.

FANNY

You go an' birth eight babies and

then you can come an' tell me

'bout hurtin', ya big ox. I ain't

gonna sit aroun' an' let one o'

'em die, neither.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya should be bloody well mindin'

the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob.

ROBIN

Fanny, show me the exact location

of the scaffold.

NOTTINGHAM

How is my bride?

NOTTINGHAM

Ah... You are overwhelmed with

happiness.

(CONTINUED)

110.

MARIAN

(calm, uncowed)

I will never marry you.

MORTIANNA

Hold her!

MARIAN

Get away from me, you disgusting

hag. I will not... augh!

NOTTINGHAM

(to Mortianna)

When we are married, thirty of the

northern barons will pledge me

their support as king. As you

predicted.

NOTTINGHAM

What do you see in the portents?

MORTIANNA

The union. The blood of the lion

and the house of Nottingham. New

faith. New power. New souls.

MORTIANNA

If there is no union, there will

be darkness, despair, death.

Ours!

NOTTINGHAM

Di not give me riddles, woman. We

are to be married within hours.

How can we be in danger?

(CONTINUED)

111.

MORTIANNA

The blood does not lie.

NOTTINGHAM

(shouting)

Tell me how it will result.

MORTIANNA

I have told you what I know.

NOTTINGHAM

Confound you, crone. Without my

protection, the people would hunt

you down, rip out your black heart

and burn it.

MORTIANNA

Without me, you are nothing. You

are straw, a fleabite, a speck.

(as Nottingham

laughs)

Laugh, fool. I birthed you from

this body. I stole a babe in this

very castle, and killed it so that

you might rise in its place. You

are my son.

(Nottingham is

too shocked to

react)

Together we are strong. Now is

not the time to doubt. Now is the

time to believe, to be bold. The

bold will prevail.

GUARD

What you got there, Father?

FRIAR

The Lord's finest brew for the

good Nottingham's fighting men.

It has a mighty kick.

(CONTINUED)

112.

GUARD

(smiling)

I'll warrant. Pass.

WILL SCARLET

Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have

word for you! Of Robin Hood!

NOTTINGHAM

Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?

WILL SCARLET

I found his lair, but alas he still

lives.

NOTTINGHAM

Stretch his neck with the others.

WILL SCARLET

...He... He... is here!

NOTTINGHAM

Locksley, here? Where ?

WILL SCARLET

Call off your dogs.

NOTTINGHAM

Release him!... Now, where is he?

(CONTINUED)

113.

WILL SCARLET

I want your word, in front of

these witnesses. If I tell you,

I will go free.

NOTTINGHAM

(scoffs)

We will find him.

WILL SCARLET

He is concealed. He is going to

free the prisoners and stop the

wedding.

NOTTINGHAM

Put Hood in my hands, you go free.

WILL SCARLET

With the reward. Ten thousand

crowns.

NOTTINGHAM

Damn your worthless hide!    Just

tell me where he is.

WILL SCARLET

The reward!

NOTTINGHAM

(to Will)

You'll get your reward. Where

is he?

CUT TO:

FRIAR

Out of the way. Make way for

the Lord's business.

(CONTINUED)

114.

NOTTINGHAM

Step down, friar.

FRIAR

As you wish, sire. Is there

something amiss?

NOTTINGHAM

This man claims you have outlaws

concealed in these barrels. Among

them the cursed Robin Hood.

FRIAR

This man will rot in hell as a

knave and a liar. These are

libations for the celebration

of your lordship's nuptials.

(CONTINUED)

115.

NOTTINGHAM

Break one open!

FRIAR

(nervous)

Why waste fine vintage, my lord?

WILL SCARLET

Try another. There are many

barrels, only a few outlaws.

SENTRY

What is your business, woman?

FANNY

Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.

Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly

view up 'ere, ain't it?

WOUNDED SOLDIER

Give room for a fightin' man and

his ma. Step aside, or I'll make

'Bout time, ya gurt lug.

FANNY

It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!

HAL

Take that, ya mug.

Impostor!   You dishonor the clan.

Fight fair...

LITTLE JOHN

...Or don't fight at all.

GREYBEARD BARON

Up there!   No mercy, shoot them!

(CONTINUED)

119.

WILL SCARLET

Pain or death, you butcher?

NOTTINGHAM

Here's another message to Robin

Hood, written in your blood.

WILL SCARLET

It's over, fool. You can kill my

body, but you cannot kill our

spirit.

REDHEAD BARON

It's Hood!   Get him!

CHIEFTAIN

I am iron.   I am rock. I am your

death.

ASLAN

You talk too much!

ASLAN

Englishmen! I am not one of you,

yet I fight for you. Against a

tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin

Hood.

120.

NOTTINGHAM

Lower the portcullis! Now!

NOTTINGHAM

Too slow, fool!

ROBIN

Friends!   We must raise the gate.

LITTLE JOHN

Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.

Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.

LITTLE JOHN

Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind

if I borrow this?

121.

NOTTINGHAM

Seal the entrance. Guard it with

your lives. ... Bring the bishop

to my chapel.

NOTTINGHAM

Come!   It is time for the union.

BISHOP

They are rebelling. We must

escape.

NOTTINGHAM

Marry us. When I am declared king,

that rabble will not dare go against

us.

BISHOP

Is is madness to delay.

MORTIANNA

Face them, or face me.

ROBIN

Light all the barrels, Tuck.

For brotherhood!... For

justice!

ROBIN

Where is she? Where is Lady

Marian?

ROBIN

Ah!   There is my answer.

FRIAR

(pious)

My son, there is a holy war being

waged outside. Release all these

wretches and God shall surely find

you a place in heaven.

JAILER

I'd rather go to hell!

BISHOP

...your bodies to be bound in

immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian

Dubois, take...

ROBIN

Marian, run!   It's me, Robin.

Run!

(CONTINUED)

124.

ROBIN

I warned you, I would find you no

matter what.

NOTTINGHAM

No companions? No army? You rush

to your death for the sake of a

woman. Lust has turned you into a

fool... Recognize this, Locksley?

NOTTINGHAM

Appropriate I should use it to

kill you with, don't you think?

FRIAR

The Lord helps those who help

themselves.

FRIAR

Give my regards to the devil.

LITTLE JOHN

Ya gutless bloody sissies.

LITTLE JOHN

Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the

ya.

HAL

No!   Fight on. Fight!

FRIAR

Sinners, beware! God's avengers

Go' bless ya, Tuck.

FRIAR

Repent, heathen!

FANNY

Listen! Outside, your countrymen

FANNY (CONT'D)

Is there one man or woman here

who does not hate him? Who has

not suffered at his hand?

Turn that on the Sheriff and his

bullies.

NOTTINGHAM

You should have stayed away,

Locksley. Fools like you never

ASLAN

Ali akbar!

FRIAR

Amen!

MORTIANNA

Agh... the painted one!

127.

FRIAR

So! You sold your soul to the

devil?

BISHOP

No, I swear it, in God's name.

FRIAR

Blasphemer! You accuse innocent

men of Druid worship while you

practice the black arts yourself.

ROBIN

(glimpsing her)

Watch out!

BISHOP

(innocently)

I am sure you would not strike a

man of the cloth.

FRIAR

Think again!

MARIAN

Robin?   Oh God, is that you?

MARIAN

How dare you?!

ROBIN

I think she's feeling better.

LITTLE JOHN

We done it, mate. We clobbered

the buggers.

FANNY

Are you 'urt?

ROBIN

It will mend.

ROBIN

Aslan, my friend.

ASLAN

I'm going home the easy way,

Robin.

FRIAR

(shaking Aslan)

You die on me, you son of satan,

and I swear I'll bury you as a

Christian in St. Catherine's

Cathedral with a thousand monks

chanting prayers for your

miserable soul. You hear me?

ASLAN

(weakly)

I have no strength, Brother Tuck.

FRIAR

(kicking him)

A fine friend you are! By the

grace of Allah and Jehovah we

have won the day, and you want to

give up the ghost. I'll pickle

your remains in mead, lay you

in your grave with a pig for a

companion, and mark it with a

cross as big as this castle.

ASLAN

Please!   It hurts when I laugh.

FRIAR

See. There's life in the heathen

dog yet.

ROBIN

Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You

deserve each other.

By the power vested in me by

God's holy church, I now

pronounce you husband and wife.

FRIAR

You may kiss the bride.

FRIAR

Hurry. We waste good celebration

time.

KING RICHARD

May I kiss the bride?

ROBIN

Who would dare refuse his king's

request?

KING RICHARD

(kissing Marian's

cheek)

You look radiant, cousin.

ROBIN

We are deeply honored by Your

Majesty's presence.

KING RICHARD

It is I who am honored, Lord

Locksley. Thanks to you I still

My friend, a word of advice...

Ride her better than your horse.

FADE OUT.
