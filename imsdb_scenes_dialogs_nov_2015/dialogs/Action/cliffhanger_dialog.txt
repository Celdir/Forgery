CLIFFHANGER

Written by

Michael France

FRANK (O.S.)

Nothing yet.

FRANK

Wait a minute -- there's Hal.

(beat)

And his date.

MAGGIE

How do they look?

FRANK (O.S.)

He's signalling "okay."

MAGGIE (O.S.)

Where's Gabe?

FRANK (O.S.)

Right where he's supposed to be.

HAL

Excuse me -- I know you're my

salvation, and all -- do you think you

could rescue us before your smoke

break?

GABE

Maybe you could tell me why I am

rescuing you.

HAL

Basically -- I've fallen down, and I

can't get up...

GABE

(into radio)

Rescue One -- have located helpless

climber, please prepare idiot line

for transport, over --

HAL

Rescue One -- please remind me to tell

you about the time I hauled your hero

here down Mt. Huntington on my back,

over --

MAGGIE (O.S.)

(through radio)

Hal, if I hear that story one more

time, I'm making you limp down the

entire three thousand feet, over --

GABE

(to Susan)

This guy showing you a good time?

GABE

Now, remember -- keep your arms and

legs within the vehicle at all

times --

HAL

(laughing)

Fuck you --

GABE

Ready?

(sees she's afraid)

Did he tell you about the time he

almost made it up Everest?

SUSAN

He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask

--

GABE

Well, if he's bored you with that

bullshit, then this has to be the best

part of a bad date. Right?

GABE

Ready?

SUSAN

(scared but tough)

Okay --

SUSAN

I can't --

GABE

Yes you can.

(reassuring)

You can do it. Don't look down.  The

whole way across, don't look down.

Look at me. Just keep looking at me --

and you'll be okay.

GABE

Sure?

SUSAN

Yeah.

(beat)

I have always depended on the kindness

of Rangers.

GABE

(loud, in control)

Hold on. I'm coming out to get you.

GABE

Keep looking at me. Hold on --

SMASH CUT TO:

STEWARDESS

Take this.

(Gabe does)

Afraid of flying?

GABE

Falling.

RENTAL AGENT

Midsize?

GABE

Any size, any color, any model.

RENTAL AGENT

How long will you be needing it?

GABE

(flat)

Just under six hours.

MAGGIE (O.S.)

You aren't wasting any time, are you?

MAGGIE

I knew you'd be coming by. Today.

MAGGIE

If you're in that much of a hurry, why

don't you ride with me?

GABE

This is new...

MAGGIE

It's a thermal scope -- picks up body

heat of lost hikers --

GABE

Still find the dead ones the old

fashioned way, I guess.

MAGGIE

You could have said goodbye.

GABE

(shakes head)

If I did, I'd have to listen to you

tell me one more time that it wasn't

my fault.

MAGGIE

(angry)

Today -- especially today -- you get

to hear it again. The harness clip

broke.  Cold stress -- one in a

million equipment failure. You and

Hal could have checked it from then

till now and it still would have

happened.

(beat)

You did everything right --

GABE

-- If I did everything right, Susan

Collins would still be alive.

GABE

Do you really believe all that?  That

it wasn't our fault?

MAGGIE

(turns to Gabe)

Yes. Yes, I do.

GABE

I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie.

That you meant what you said, just now

-- or that it were really true then.

HAL

Maggie, where the hell have you been?

I've got two climbers out --

HAL

Brett and Evan are up there again to

jump off the spur. Their wives called

twice. I want you in the air and I

want them found before the storm

system moves in.

(Maggie hesitates)

Now.

GABE

Christ. You're in charge of Rescue

now?

HAL

There was a vacancy. Maybe you heard

about it. The last guy lost his nerve

and lit out of town.

GABE

Well, you're a better man than I am,

Hal. Nothing rattles you.

FRANK

(steering Gabe away)

Gabe! Long time, son -- why don't you

come meet some of the new guys --

GABE

Good idea. Say, Hal?

(beat)

Why don't you come with me so we can

show these rookies how to death-rig a

woman properly?

HAL

Take the Bronco to where you're going.

I've already been. Then go back to

wherever it is you like to hide. And

stay there.

CUT TO:

TRAVERS

Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment

is ready.

DAVID

(phone already out)

Right away, Mr. Travers.

WRIGHT

(into phone)

Good -- good. I'll be right down.

SECRETARY (O.S.)

You can't go in there --

MATHESON (O.S.)

Watch me.

MATHESON

Walter Wright?

(flashes badge)

Matheson. FBI. We need to talk.

PILOT

We'll be fueled and ready in ten

minutes, Mr. Travers.

TRAVERS

(an order)

Be ready in five.

MATHESON (O.S.)

Go ahead and take ten. We'll need the

time.

MATHESON

(flashes badge)

Matheson. FBI.

TRAVERS

(looking down at it)

Your parents must be proud.

(to Wright)

What the fuck is this about?

WRIGHT

Small problem with the shipment,

Travers.

(to Matheson)

Tell him what you just told me.

MATHESON

We got word that somebody's been

observing your currency shipments --

this load, the $5,000s -- over the

last three deliveries.

TRAVERS

(laughs)

There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can

do but observe.

(beat)

This is the most protected shipment

we've got -- and the most useless for

a thief. Those bills aren't in

circulation. You think five thousand

dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the

fuck would try?

MATHESON

This guy might.

TRAVERS

Who is he?

MATHERS

(patient)

His name's Eric Qualen. One of the

East German spies who got shut out by

the reunification. The CIA issued an

inter-agency warning about him right

after the wall came down. He's got

nowhere to go and nothing to lose.

He's also got the international

connections to get rid of bills like

these -- and he's probably desperate

enough to try for them. Fifty million

bucks buys a lot of sanctuary.

TRAVERS

Could you get to the part where I'm

supposed to care?

MATHESON

(shows him more photos)

We had two agents monitoring him.

These two -- Gleason and Quinones.

Their last report said he was going to

try to take this shipment.

TRAVERS

(turning away)

Thanks for the tip. But I've got work

to do.

MATHESON

(stopping him)

Did I say "last" report? I think I

did. I mean last fucking report.

These guys have vanished.

TRAVERS

You have my sympathy, but --

(exasperated)

There's a reason we do things this

way, all right? Armored cars can be

hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But

nobody can get to us in flight. The

only time this is on the ground is at

the mint, or on the Presidio runway in

San Francisco. Either way, someone

would have to shoot his way past a

couple of thousand guards.

TRAVERS

If you're worried about an inside job,

forget it. I checked the plane from

top to bottom an hour ago. And these

three are my best against. Even if one

of them did go skydiving, they

wouldn't get far. Each case has an

electronic tracer with a range of one

hundred miles.

TRAVERS

(facing down Matheson)

I haven't lost a bill in eight years.

And I'm not scrubbing this shipment

because you scare easily.

MATHESON

(an easy smile)

Who said anything about stopping the

shipment?

(beat)

I've been tracking Qualen for almost a

year. If he pulls something, I want to

be in on the party.

WRIGHT

This is cleared from the top, Travers.

Matheson will accompany you on the

flight to San Francisco.

(beat)

Show him every professional courtesy.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Rescue One to base, over.

HAL (O.S.)

Rescue One -- have you sighted them?

Over --

MAGGIE

Negative, Hal -- storm's already

moving in -- I can't see them, and

winds are too strong to stay up

here -- over --

HAL (O.S.)

Rescue One -- abort. They'll be all

right. Brett and Evan are dumb enough

not to log in, but they're smart

enough to have storm gear. Head back

to base.

(not unkindly)

Maybe you can catch Gabe before he

leaves. Over.

MAGGIE

I don't think he's planning a long

visit, Hal.

(back to business)

Rescue One heading back to base, over

and out.

EVAN

(freezing)

Way to check the weather, Brett.

BRETT

(shivering yet macho)

Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be

worth d-doing.

CUT TO:

AGENT

Just enjoy the view, huh?

(Matheson says nothing)

Relax. I mean, what could happen in

the air?

TRAVERS

(to other agents)

Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit!

PILOT

He's coming in too slow.

TRAVERS

(cool)

No -- we're going too fast, and we're

too high up. Push flaps forward twenty

degrees and drop to five thousand

feet.

MATHESON

(to agent)

You got any rifles?

AGENT

Forward compartment -- left side --

TRAVERS

What the hell are you doing --

MATHESON

Checked the plane from top to bottom,

huh? You fucker --

(clicks hammer back)

Put your hands behind your head! It's

over!

TRAVERS

Calm down -- give the gun to me --

MATHESON

(to other agents)

There's a couple of dead bodies in the

front compartment -- they're FBI

agents --

TRAVERS

He's losing it --

MATHESON

Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's

doing! He's hijacking the fucking

shipment!

(back to Travers)

Don't make me shoot you!

TRAVERS

Don't make me laugh.

TRAVERS

(to mouthpiece)

Move into position.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRAVERS

(into radio)

More -- more -- keep it coming --

TRAVERS

(into radio)

Locked on. Move into lateral position.

KRISTEL

Moving into lateral position.

PILOT

We're right on the edge of the

storm -- let's move it.

PILOT

This isn't going to work -- Wright

will suspect something.

TRAVERS

So what. He'll sift though a plane

that went down in a storm --

(gestures to bodies)

-- find enough pulverized bone for six

men heroically killed in the line of

duty --

(finds three suitcases)

-- and just enough of the right kind

of ash.

TRAVERS

We get twenty-one gun funerals and

they write off fifty million. It's

perfect, as long as you hold the plane

steady -- so concentrate.

QUALEN

(into radio)

Travers -- hurry it up.

TRAVERS

(into radio)

On my way.

TRAVERS

That charge is going to blow both

engines -- the plane'll go down like a

rock, so clip yourself on to the end

of the cable with the money as soon as

I get over.

(an afterthought)

And make sure you bring the right

cases.

TRAVERS

(into the headset)

Dip the plane. I'm coming over.

QUALEN

(shouting over the wind)

Why didn't you send the money over?

TRAVERS

(shouting too)

Somehow, I didn't think you'd have

waited for me if I'd sent it first.

TRAVERS

(shouting to cockpit)

Get underneath the jet! The cases will

slide over!

TRAVERS

(shouting)

Lower! Get underneath it!

KRISTEL

It's dragging us down! Disconnect the

cable!

KRISTEL

So much for phase one.

(to Travers)

Now what?

TRAVERS

Now -- we call the police.

HAL

Look -- I know there's a storm, but

that wasn't thunder.

FRANK

(unconcerned)

Hal, when you've been in this line as

long as I have --

KRISTEL (O.S.)

(panicky)

Mayday -- mayday -- downed DC-3 --

mayday --

HAL

Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in,

HAL

Acknowledged, mayday. What's your

position?

KRISTEL (O.S.)

("panicked")

Don't know -- position unknown --

landed on top of some mountain -- only

visual bearing is a facing

cylinder-type formation -- over --

HAL

Got to be Comb Bluff.

(keys mike)

Acknowledged, mayday. Winds are too

strong for us to get a copter up there

-- can you and your passengers make it

through the storm? Over --

Dead silence. The transmission cuts off/

HAL

Mayday -- come in, mayday --

INT. COCKPIT

Kristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen

standing behind her. Qualen lightly applauds.

QUALEN

Not bad. The insulin was a nice touch.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming

finally to a cabin settled in a clearing.

GABE

pulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park. He

doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's

going in or not. Finally -- he cuts the ignition.

INT. CABIN - DAY

A knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe

opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside.

GABE

Maggie?

No answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face

tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe

moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe

and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer

wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all

younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.  Gabe

smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at

the back of the cabin shakes him out of it.

EXT. CABIN - DAY - THE BACK DOOR

has come open and swings in the wind. Gabe steps outside and

pulls it shut. Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a

small but sturdy shed a few yards away. Gabe heads over to it.

INT. SHED - DAY

Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that

offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and

whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.

A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE

-- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the

country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us

it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us

it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.

MAGGIE

Hey there --

The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the

door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just

looks awkward.

GABE

Hi.

(beat)

Could you introduce us?

MAGGIE

Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27.

A27 -- Gabe.

GABE

Not the tag -- what do you call

him?

MAGGIE

Her. I call her Lucky.

GABE

(bends down, eyes wound)

Poachers?

(Maggie nods)

Bastards...

MAGGIE

They got the mother -- and left this

one behind. Too small to make a decent

trophy, I guess.

GABE

About four months, right?

(Maggie nods)

Christ -- it must have been just about

his -- I mean her -- first flight --

MAGGIE

Time to change the dressing.

Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves.

GABE

You can't do that alone --

MAGGIE

I've had to learn. She trust me --

Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.

GABE

I'm making her nervous --

(beat)

You hold her, I'll do the dressing.

Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and

alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's

beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the

cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done

many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and

Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage

the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and

yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the

wound.

GABE

Got some fight in her -- that's good.

(beat)

What happened to Dave?

MAGGIE

The usual. Flew off -- never calls,

never writes --

Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch

and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back

in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't

move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe

tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him

hand away.

MAGGIE

I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind

of wish you hadn't come. I was almost

used to you being gone.

(beat, quiet)

Why are you here?

GABE

(pauses)

I thought I came back to see if I'd

learned to live with it. Well, big

surprise. Coming back just tore me

open all over again, like it all

happened yesterday instead of a year

ago. Nothing's changed. Including the

way I feel about you.

(beat)

I didn't realize it till I saw you at

the airport. But I came back for you,

Maggie.

MAGGIE

Does that mean you're going to stay?

GABE

No. Not here.

(beat)

I want you come with me. Start over,

somewhere else.

MAGGIE

(incredulous)

You come back after being gone a year,

and you expect me to --

(beat)

You don't live here any more, Gabe.

Your choice, remember? But this is

my home. I'm not leaving. You can

stay with me, or you can go alone.

It's still your choice.

HAL (O.S.)

Now there's an easy call.

Standing in the shed's doorway is Hal. Stone faced. Grim.

OUTSIDE SHED

Furious, Gabe heads out after Hal.

GABE

What the hell do you want?

HAL

(beat)

I need your help. A plane's gone down

on Comb Bluff. This storm would blow

a copter all over the place -- but we

can climb up to it.

GABE

"We"?

(beat)

Talk to somebody who's still on the

payroll. You've got a half dozen new

guys --

HAL

-- who couldn't climb that wall now if

there were stairs cut into it. But

you've soloed it.

GABE

During the summer. On a bet.

HAL

This is a little more important than a

bet. Just a few injured people with

no first aid or shelter, camping in a

zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice

sculptures by tomorrow morning.

GABE

(shakes his head)

Maybe you missed the headlines -- but

I don't do rescues any more. They're

bad for my conscience.

(beat)

Fuck this one up on your own.

HAL

Play it again, Gabe, about how we

killed her. I was there too, remember?

GABE

(hot)

Not like I was, pal -- her fingers

brushed mine on the way down --

HAL

(right back)

-- and I was the one who had to deal

with her family when you fucking tore

out of town.

(takes a breath)

We lost her. Whatever anybody says

about cold stress and the clip, you

and I have to live with that. But

right now, there are some more people

who need our help, and they shouldn't

die too just because you've got a

problem keeping the past in the past.

GABE

I don't want the responsibility.

HAL

Walk away and you are responsible.

They'll die. I can't do this alone.

(Gabe slows but doesn't

stop)

You know what else, Gabe? You can go

anywhere you want, but if you don't do

this, now, you're going to be stuck on

that goddamn ledge for the rest of

your life.

HAL

(indicating gun)

That thing's dead weight. Completely

useless for an ice climb.

GABE

Just backup.

GABE

(not a challenge)

I'll lead. I left a few bolts last

time I climbed this -- I think I can

find some of them.

HAL

Save the rope for when it gets tough.

(beat, realizing)

That bet was for you to free climb

the wall.

GABE

(further up)

Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still

alive tomorrow morning, I'll give you

the twenty bucks back, okay?

DISSOLVE TO:

GABE

(shouting down)

Anchored!

GABE

(shouting down)

Rockslide!

GABE

(shaken, voice gone)

Anchored --

(shouts this time)

Anchored!

HAL

(breathless too)

You're sure this time --

HAL

(looking up at gun)

Don't say it --

GABE

(wheezing too)

It's kind of hard to resist --

GABE                         HAL

It's not dead                It's not dead

weight -- you                weight -- I am.

are.

DISSOLVE TO:

TRAVERS

(into mouthpiece)

Have they arrived?

(two beeps in response)

Good. Return to the plane and cover

your tracks.

QUALEN

(to others)

Get ready.

GABE

Come on -- the hard part's over.

HAL

(grim)

That's it.

GABE

I thought the fuselage was broken.

That looks pretty cozy.

HAL

(puzzled too)

The pilot was hysterical.

GABE

Something's wrong here --

HAL

Does this look like a prank to you?

Come on --

HAL

Relax -- we're here to help --

HAL

Don't try to talk --

TRAVERS

(hoarse whisper)

Where?

HAL

-- Where? What are you --

TRAVERS

You said "we". Where are the rest?

TRAVERS

What's for dinner?

(Kynette tosses packet)

Ugh. "Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque

Sauce."

(tosses it back)

Try and make this edible.

TRAVERS

Hal Tucker.

(to Gabe)

Where's yours?

QUALEN

He doesn't have one. Just a wallet.

TRAVERS

Gabe Walker...

(notes photo of Maggie)

Very attractive.

GABE

My ex.

TRAVERS

Too bad. Let me tell you what's on for

today. We'd like you to help settle a

wager. You see, we lost some

luggage --

TRAVERS

(showing them the blips)

See these? Now I've bet the gentlemen

behind you that you know enough about

this mountain range to lead us to each

of these, quickly, and that you'd be

happy to do so. They bet me you

couldn't and wouldn't.

(guns are clicked)

Now tell me -- who wins?

TRAVERS

Good dog. Now let's get this

expedition started.

TRAVERS

Okay. Connect the dots.

GABE

This way.

DISSOLVE TO:

GABE

(sotto)

We don't have to do this. We know

these mountains -- they don't. If we

can get ahead --

HAL

Can you climb faster than they can

shoot?

GABE

We've got to try something. Think

we'll get a finder's fee after they

get all their "luggage"?

HAL

Sure. All the bullets we can eat.

GABE

That's not what really worries me.

HAL

There's something else to worry

about?

GABE

Yeah. Once they've got what they're

after -- they're gonna need a copter

to get out of here.

HAL

(realizing)

Maggie.

TRAVERS

Hold it.

(beat)

It's up there.

TRAVERS

Fetch.

GABE

I'll need the ice axe.

TRAVERS

(laughs)

You've got to be kidding.

GABE

(sighs)

Okay. How about some tape?

GABE

Crampons too.

QUALEN

I don't trust him.

TRAVERS

(indicating wall)

Where could he go?

QUALEN

I'd rather he didn't show us.

(beat)

We don't need two guides.

TRAVERS

(shrugs)

You win. Kill him when he gets down.

GABE

Jesus.

TRAVERS

(impatient, shouting)

Lower it down -- now!

GABE (O.S.)

(shouting down)

I've got a better idea. Why don't you

come up and get it?

TRAVERS

(shouts to Heldon)

Get him!

QUALEN

(shouting)

Bring the money down, or we kill your

friend!

TRAVERS

We can't.

(frowning)

And he knows it.

GABE

Come on --

HAL

You son of a bitch --

QUALEN

No. We need him to get the rest of the

money.

(he isn't backing down)

If he dies we lose everything

TRAVERS

(to Hal)

Get us out of here.

EVAN

What the hell --

EVAN

Brett -- you're not going to believe

this -- but a couple of guys are

holding a gun on Hal and forcing him

up the bluff --

BRETT (O.S.)

I believe it.

EVAN

What the fuck is going on here?

BRETT

Let's catch up and find out.

HAL (O.S.)

-- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over --

MAGGIE

(keying mike)

Rescue Unit -- what's going on,

Hall? -- over --

TRAVERS

No tricks, no procedural codes, no

personal messages -- just tell them

everything's under control and you're

taking care of the wounded.

HAL

(keys it)

We've reached the wreckage -- top of

Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're

responding to treatment. Everything

A-OK. Over.

MAGGIE (O.S.)

Everything isn't okay, Hal -- I'm

coming up after you -- over --

HAL

Negative, Maggie. Winds are too

high, and the passengers' injuries are

all superficial. We're going to ride

out the storm here -- over --

TRAVERS

Have her come up.

HAL

Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her

all over the peaks --

(Travers starts to argue)

-- Not that I expect you to give a

shit, but it's our only copter.

You'll be stuck.

MAGGIE (O.S.)

I can handle the winds --

HAL

(breaking in)

Forget about it, Maggie, that's an

order -- acknowledge --

MAGGIE

Acknowledged. Let me talk to Gabe --

over --

HAL (O.S.)

(hesitates)

You can't. He's taking care of

passengers. Just like I should be.

Over and out.

TRAVERS

(snatching radio away)

Good. You might live longer than your

friend. Now --

(takes out monitor)

-- what?

HAL

The next one's on top of the peak.

This'll be long, but easy -- more like

a hike than a climb.

TRAVERS

(suspicious)

It looks like a winding route.

HAL

There's a more direct route. The East

Face. But it's the wall on the other

side, and it's smooth as glass. Maybe

a dozen guys in the world could do it

in good weather. Only a psycho would

try it in a snowstorm.

CUT TO:

CUT TO;

WRIGHT

(furious)

Okay -- I know it's not in San

Francisco. I know it's not here. I

know it's not in any fucking airport

from here to Montana. Where it's

not - we got that covered. Now, do

you have any ideas on where it is?

DAVIS

(walking to a map)

There's no radio contact, sir. At all.

We're not receiving the tracer signal

from the cockpit's flight recorder.

Radar lost it after it went low here.

DAVIS

We have to assume it went down in the

storm.

WRIGHT

Air search?

DAVIS

(shakes head)

That storm hasn't quit yet. Weather

service says we've got it until

tomorrow morning at least. Even if we

could get a plane up now, it'd be

impossible to see anything on the

ground. And --

WRIGHT

-- The roads are shut down, right?

DAVIS

Most of this area doesn't even have

roads.

WRIGHT

(rubs his eyes)

Keep two copters on full standby. And

let me know the second that storm

starts to wind down.

CUT TO:

GABE

(teeth chattering)

A steambath.

(spikes himself up)

A steambath -- and a bottle of

whiskey.

(new foothold)

A steambath with a bottle of

Glenlivet. And a fire.

(new handhold)

A steambath -- with a bottle of

Glenlivet -- and a steak.

(new foothold)

A steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking

over a steambath on fire.

GABE

(sighing)

Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have

it back tomorrow.

HAL

Come on -- tourists take this trail.

TRAVERS

Is this it?

HAL

Yeah. This is it.

TRAVERS

Good. Get out of the way.

TRAVERS

(smiling)

This way.

TRAVERS

(calling behind)

It's over here!

TRAVERS

(incredulous)

He's still alive.

(furious)

He's still alive!

(to Qualen and the

others)

He can't be far away -- spread out!

TRAVERS

(to Hal, brandishing gun)

Put your hands on your head.

QUALEN

(to Kynette)

Follow him!

KYNETTE

(gestures with light)

After you.

HAL

Well -- look at the bright side.

(beat)

At least you've only got to make the

split five ways now.

GABE

Please still be there -- oh,

please --

CUT TO:

GABE

(mouth full)

Mmm. Just like -- chicken.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVIS

We've got a fix on the plane, sir --

we're getting a reading on the flight

recorder tracer --

WRIGHT

Any visual? Any radio contact?

DAVIS

Not yet --

WRIGHT

(heading to the door)

Get the copters ready. We take off in

three minutes.

DAVIS

The winds are still too strong --

WRIGHT

Sorry to hear it. We're still going.

The plane might be intact.

DAVIS

Sir --

WRIGHT

Shut up. That fifty million isn't

coming out of my pension.

TRAVERS

Still interested in staying alive?

HAL

(pointing to map)

It's up here. Somewhere on the Tower.

There's a way to cross over to the top

in about half a day.

TRAVERS

Show me.

BRETT (O.S.)

They're heading toward the opposite

edge. An easy way down.

BRETT

I'll cut around this side, and wind up

in front. You come up behind them --

quietly. And we've got 'em.

EVAN

Brett -- they've got five guns --

BRETT

And you can collect them all after I

get the drop on 'em. Let's get moving.

BRETT

End of the line!

BRETT

(nervous now)

You heard me! Drop the guns!

TRAVERS

"End of the line"? That's classic.

(beat)

You've got style. So, I'm going to

give you a three-count to figure out

how to turn the safety off.

BRETT

Nice try. I've got one of these at

home. Now drop 'em.

BRETT

Hey -- where's the other guy --

HAL

(shouting)

Brett, behind you!

TRAVERS

(turning to face Hal)

Time to --

EVAN

What are we going to do --

HAL

You came up here to jump the spur --

(pulls Evan's chute out

of his pack)

This'd be a great time to do it.

EVAN

(panicked)

But --

HAL

(quick)

Listen -- they don't know you're up

here -- I'll draw their fire, you've

got to make the jump and get help.

EVAN

I don't -- I -- uh --

HAL

(exasperated, grabs

chute)

Unless you want to do it the other way

around?

KRISTEL

Stop!

GABE

Come on -- wait till you're out of

range -- don't pull it yet --

QUALEN

Was that Walker?

TRAVERS

No such luck.

(to Hal, smiling)

Cheer up. Everyone should die in a

spot this beautiful.

GABE

(quietly)

Don't worry. You will.

FRANK

Maggie -- what are you doing --

MAGGIE

I'm going to go nuts if I sit here one

more hour.

FRANK

Still a little breezy out, Mag --

MAGGIE

(over engine's whine)

You coming?

TRAVERS

Forget about it. He's smart, but he's

not invisible.

WRIGHT

What can you confirm?

STUART

Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can

confirm.

(condescending)

We've been here just about one hour.

These events take months to analyze.

So if you'll excuse me --

WRIGHT

No, I don't think I will. The reason

the FAA pays you is to exercise your

vast, amazing knowledge of these

"events". So I expect you to come up

with some stunning insights, something

a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't

already observed.

(gesturing to wreckage)

One: it didn't blow up in mid-air,

because the debris isn't widely

dispersed. But was there a bomb on

board that could have disabled it? I

wonder.

(pointing back)

Two: There wasn't an attempted

landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris

to the east of the wreckage, where the

plane was coming from. Did it come

straight down? That's got me

scratching my head too.

(gesturing back to

wreckage)

And three: the flight recorder's

tracer led us here in the first place.

So where is the goddamn thing? That

one's got me all aflush with

curiosity.

STUART

(a little cowed)

You'll be the first to know.

WRIGHT

Oh, I believe you.

TRAVERS

I thought you said there was an easy

way across.

HAL

There is. You might not like it much.

HAL

Of course -- we'll have to do it hand

over hand. Seems I forgot my harness.

Sorry.

TRAVERS

Don't be. Lead on.

GABE

I didn't need to see that. I really

didn't.

FRANK

Got 'em -- they're under the trees --

MAGGIE

Hal! Gabe!

MAGGIE

It's Evan.

(she stands, looks up)

Parachute failed.

FRANK

(not unkindly)

Damn fool. Why would anybody try that

in the middle of a storm.

MAGGIE

Why would anybody try at all.

(sighs)

Get the bag.

GABE

Should've taken that left turn at

Albequerque.

GABE

It's just like any other side move --

you can't see where the fuck you're

going, that's all --

GABE

(garbled)

Much better.

MAGGIE

(motioning down)

Bring it down here.

FRANK

Maggie --

MAGGIE

Just do it, Frank.

FRANK

Maggie, this is dumb --

MAGGIE

No it isn't. I'm going to find

Brett -- I don't want to have to talk

to his widow too. Fly Evan's body

back to base -- I'll call you when

I've found Brett. Or Hal. Or Gabe.

Or anybody.

KYNETTE

(motioning up)

I'm going back.

TRAVERS

Look -- this part is nothing,

believe me --

KYNETTE

Walker should be coming up by now.

GABE

(winded)

So much for the easy part.

KYNETTE

He's on the way up. I could hear that

jacket before I could see it.

TRAVERS (O.S.)

(over radio)

Then get the money, kill him and get

back here. Now.

KYNETTE

(into radio)

I'll wait till he comes to me.

KYNETTE

(into radio)

Bulletin. The climber isn't Walker --

it's a woman.

KYNETTE

Rotten weather for a climb, huh?

(aims barrel)

I have two questions I'd like to

trouble you with. Ready?

KYNETTE

This first one's easy. Do you know a

man named Gabe Walker?

MAGGIE

Yes.

(breathless, scared)

Where is he?

KYNETTE

You don't know either? I am sorry.

That was question number two.

(lowers barrel)

Thanks for your time.

GABE

Come on --

MAGGIE

Where? --

GABE

Here.

GABE

Today, goddamit!

GABE

This way.

(off Maggie's look)

I like the outside of the mountain

better too, but --

GABE

Stop.

MAGGIE

We can't --

GABE

I need to stop.

GABE

(looks at Maggie)

I'm glad to see you -- but Christ, I

wish you hadn't come.

TRAVERS

Don't tell me --

QUALEN

(disengaging)

He's still alive.

QUALEN

For another two minutes.

MAGGIE

It hurts just looking at you.

GABE

(still panting)

Try it from this side. Do you still

have your radio?

MAGGIE

It's not going to work in here.

GABE

Let's give it a try.

(she hands it to him)

I'm in bad need of a ride.

(keys it)

Come in, Rescue Unit --

GABE (O.S.)

(over radio)

-- Come in, Rescue One --

QUALEN

Patience.

GABE (O.S.)

(over radio, broken up)

-- Come in, Frank --

GABE

Is there anybody else on the radio?

GABE

I take a year off and the department

goes to hell.

(keys it)

-- Come in, Rescue Unit --

GABE (O.S.)

(via radio)

Come in, Frank -- over --

QUALEN

Try to get thirty million in

entertainment out of this, because he

is definitely in for thirty million

worth of pain.

HAL

You sick fuck --

QUALEN

Don't worry. They may still be alive.

That was the small one.

FRANK

Jesus -- that's some flare.

GABE

Are you all right?

MAGGIE

(terrified, coughing)

Why are they doing this?

MAGGIE

(looks up)

We might be able to get up that way --

there's an opening --

GABE

No -- there could be another bomb up

there -- even if there isn't, we could

get another cave-in. The only sure way

out is through the side.

DAVIS

I've got something here.

STUART

Let's have it.

DAVIS

There's an unconfirmed report of a

distress call made from a plane that

crashed.

STUART

That's really, really interesting, but

--

(gestures around)

-- kind of old news, don't you think?

DAVIS

This call was supposedly made from a

plane that crash landed. After it

landed.

STUART

(waves it off)

Sounds like they got it wrong. Next

time you interrupt my work make sure

it's something I can use.

GABE

(smiling)

Come on -- we're almost out.

KYNETTE

Miss me?

QUALEN

(looks to Hal)

You might say a few words for your

friends -- this is the one that will

bury them.

TRAVERS

What happened?

QUALEN

I'm not sure -- I set the timer --

HAL

(keying radio)

Gabe, it's a dud --

GABE

Move!

QUALEN

When I was seventeen, I was a sentry

on the East Berlin boundary.

There was a problem, then -- too many

defectors were managing to sneak

through the wilderness to the west. A

man would take them through, every

night of every week -- a man like your

friend.

(beat)

He had quite a sense of humor. Every

time he got someone through, he'd

radio us at midnight to let us know

how many. "Five tonight." "Eight

more have been freed tonight." No one

could find the route. It made me look

bad.

(beat)

I looked day and night and finally I

found it. A tunnel. I didn't tell me

superiors. I put a charge there, with

a timer to trigger a radio receiver on

the detonator. At midnight. Our friend

made his radio report, and I heard him

say "seven" before the explosion.

(beat)

They pulled eight bodies out of the

tunnel, and I was promoted to

intelligence the next day.

TRAVERS

Thanks. We couldn't have killed him

without you.

GABE

Knock this in the side. Make it firm.

GABE (O.S.)

Bad news. There's another bomb up

there. We've got to move quick.

GABE (O.S.)

Good news. There's a cave down there.

FRANK

Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is

Rescue One --

TRAVERS

There's our ride out of here. Everyone

out of sight -- except you, Kristel.

(hands her radio)

Make the distress call. You're so good

at it.

MAGGIE

(frantic)

What are we going to do?

GABE

(defeated)

Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you

got into this.

MAGGIE

What are you doing?

WRIGHT

He didn't think a distress call from a

crashed plane was "important"?

(Davis nods)

Get me a fucking radio! Now!

FRANK

(over radio)

Come in, Maggie, over --

KRISTEL (O.S.)

(over radio -- "weak")

Alpha Charlie Niner -- please --

help --

FRANK

(over radio)

I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your

position -- over --

FRANK

(over radio)

Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right

on top of you.

MAGGIE

(shouting, waving)

Frank! Down here! Frank!

GABE

Forget about it. He can't hear you.

(hands Maggie some rope)

Tie these together. Tight.

MAGGIE

(realizing)

-- Are you out of your mind --

GABE

This is rope from the Gordon exhibit.

The way guys climbed then, they'd tie

on three at a time -- this rope'll

take around nine hundred pounds.

MAGGIE

Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old

--

GABE

(misses the point)

Yeah, they made it pretty good then.

Each of these strands ought to hold

about 300 pounds before snapping.

MAGGIE

(dazed)

Ought to. About.

(beat)

Will it hold?

GABE

Depends on how big a breakfast you

had. You want to go first?

GABE

(shouting)

Swing towards it -- and drop!

FRANK

What the fuck --

KRISTEL

What -- who are --

FRANK

Don't worry. I'm here to help.

KRISTEL

(recovered)

Glad to hear it.

FRANK

Jailhouse load. First chamber's

empty --

(aims gun)

-- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but

things have been a little strange this

morning.

TRAVER

Stop!

(explaining)

You'll damage the helicopter.

TRAVERS

(to Kristel)

Answer that.

STUART (O.S.)

(over radio)

Calling Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come

in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over --

KRISTEL

(keying radio)

Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over --

STUART

This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation

Administration -- please identify --

over --

KRISTEL

Copy, FAA. This is Margaret Deighan,

Rocky Mountain Rescue. Over --

STUART (O.S.)

We have an unconfirmed report of an

air crash in your area, and a distress

call on this frequency -- can you

confirm -- over --

KRISTEL

(keying mike)

Copy, FAA. Distress call came at

approximately eleven hundred hours

yesterday. I investigated -- the call

turned out to be a false alarm. Over.

STUART

Please repeat, Rocky Mountain

Rescue -- distress call was a false

alarm? -- over --

KRISTEL (O.S.)

(over radio)

Repeat, distress call was a definite

false alarm -- we've had several here.

Somebody's sick idea of a joke. Do you

require further assistance -- over --

STUART

Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain

Rescue -- over and out --

STUART

I don't want to say I told you so. But

I did. Can I go back to work now?

TRAVERS

I almost believed you myself.

HAL

(quiet)

Goodbye, Frank.

TRAVERS

Time for number three. Unless you want

to have a longer conversation with him

elsewhere.

HAL

(low)

Fuck off.

HAL

I think I'll wait here. You just

murdered three of my friends. Sooner

or later, whoever's chasing you is

going to show up and return the favor,

and I'd love to watch.

TRAVERS

Suit yourself. You see, we just had a

little interface with several branches

of the federal government -- one of

whose members I know has zero

imagination -- and I can tell you, the

cavalry just isn't going to make it by

this week.

(beat)

No, you're taking us where we want to

go. Because you want to return that

favor and you want to do more than

watch. You want to kill me -- more

than anything, even more than you want

to keep on breathing, and with a

little more time you pray you'll get

that chance.

(tightens trigger)

Am I right?

GABE

Are you okay?

MAGGIE

My ears are ringing -- but I'm all

right. Gabe, what's going on?

GABE

(shows money in his pack)

This. That plane crash -- it's a half

dozen guys who were smart enough to

steal fifty million bucks, but dumb

enough to drop it all over the range.

They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and

right now they're heading for the rest

of it.

MAGGIE

Where?

GABE

It's close to the lake -- Hal's

probably leading them on the slowest

possible route down to it.

(stiffly gets up)

I can get there first -- all I have to

do is make it along the north wall to

the Bitker ladder --

MAGGIE

"All?" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you

expect to do then?

GABE

(aching)

Something -- subtle.

MAGGIE

I'm going with you.

GABE

No way. You're climbing back down --

try to get to the station or find some

help.

MAGGIE

I'm just as good a climber as you

are -- and right now, I'm definitely

in better shape.

GABE

(hard)

And you're definitely not going --

GABE

Okay. Come on --

GABE

-- but the second you slow me down,

I'm leaving --

(slips on sore leg,

Maggie catches him)

-- I'm leaving you behind. Understood?

MAGGIE

(helping Gabe out)

Anything you say, Gabe.

WRIGHT (O.S.)

One of the currency cases.

DAVIS

We've tested the ash inside -- it's

the right paper.

WRIGHT

What about the men?

DAVIS

It's -- hard to tell. But forensics

says yes. All of them were in the

plane.

WRIGHT

(sags with the news)

Everything's accounted for, then --

time to head back and start making

excuses.

(beat)

Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I

just don't give a shit. It's one more

run of the press. But we lost five

good men and they aren't so easily

replaced.

(beat)

Especially a guy like Travers.

TRAVERS

Qualen. How far along are you?

QUALEN (O.S.)

(over radio)

Not as far as we'd be with the

helicopter.

TRAVERS (O.S.)

(over radio)

We have less than half a tank of fuel,

Eric -- if we burn it up treasure

hunting we'll never get off this rock.

Now -- how far away are you?

QUALEN

(keys radio)

It looks like two miles, but --

QUALEN

-- it'll take some time.

TRAVERS (O.S.)

(over radio)

Time we have -- Walker's dead,

Wright's an idiot. And our guide --

QUALEN

(keys radio)

What about him?

TRAVERS (O.S.)

(over radio)

As soon as he becomes a convenience

instead of a necessity -- kill him.

QUALEN

(keys radio)

Agreed.

CUT TO:

MAGGIE

Gabe?

(beat)

I'll go first.

GABE

(shakes his head)

If I don't go first, I might not go at

all.

GABE

(winded, shouting across)

Think you can beat my time?

GABE

(to himself)

Shit -- she is in better shape.

GABE

(enjoying it now)

Quit sandbagging it -- I haven't got

all day --

GABE

That -- tears it.

(gasping)

You're not coming any further.

MAGGIE

(just as breathless)

Gabe -- you're going to get yourself

killed --

GABE

(breath almost back)

Maybe. But I'm not getting you

killed.

(she starts a reply)

Look, Maggie. I don't know what'll

happen when I catch up with Hal -- but

I've got to know one thing for sure --

that you're making it off this

mountain. Alive.

MAGGIE

Okay.

GABE

Get on the trail and stay out of

sight.

(beat)

I'll see you on the ground.

WRIGHT

I give up. What was it?

SEARCH PILOT

ID says this used to be your pilot.

(beat)

And we found him seven miles east of

the wreck.

WRIGHT

A hijack.

(beat)

The plane was hijacked. Son of a

bitch --

STUART

Oh, give me a break. Your pilot lost

it when the flight started going

south, and he bailed --

SEARCH PILOT

Excuse me -- but there's no parachute

there. Check it yourself.

FORENSICS AGENT

Sir -- we found the flight recorder --

it was driven twenty feet deep into a

crater. It was demolished, but we

salvaged the recording --

STUART

(grabbing it away)

I've heard a thousand of these, Wright

-- whoever was at the stick is going

to begin by screeching the Lord's

Prayer and wind up screaming "Oh,

shit" at ground zero --

MATHESON (O.S.)

(shouting, rushed)

-- the money's been stolen -- Travers

and the pilot were in on it -- the

pilot's dead, but Travers took the

cash and made a mid-air transfer to a

jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't

respond --

(screaming)

shiiiiii--

WRIGHT

Guess we're both right, Stuart. Thanks

for your expertise.

(turns to pilot)

Well?

(jerking a thumb back)

You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day

for him to pull his head out of his

ass -- let's get it in the air!

GABE

Hasn't gotten any lower in the last

year.

(coiling for jump)

Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would

another four feet have killed you?

QUALEN

Almost there.

HAL

Oh, no -- you didn't lose another

one, did you?

DELMER

What about him?

QUALEN

(over his shoulder)

Kill him! Now!

DELMER

Tell me -- where would you like the

first half dozen shots to go?

HAL

(hands up)

As long as you're taking requests --

how about -- the base of your spine?

QUALEN

(tagging headset radio)

Travers. Get down here. Now.

TRAVERS

Have you found the money?

QUALEN (O.S.)

No. Walker has.

KRISTEL

You would have lived longer, if you

weren't such a smartass.

KRISTEL

You telegraphed this kind of stunt

with that joke snowman. Too bad for

you we're not all gullible.

GABE

Good thing for Qualen you are.

KRISTEL

(pauses, wary)

What do you mean?

GABE

When he comes back, he's going to

shoot you and the other guy, grab the

money, and take off with Travers.

KRISTEL

(squeezing trigger again)

No sale. Say "night-night" --

GABE

(talking fast)

He already blew up one of your pals in

that crevice. And I've been in that

copter. It goes a hell of a lot

farther with two people than with

four.

(beat)

Am I wrong? Give him a buzz.

KRISTEL

You've got my attention.

GABE

You've also got all the money. And I

can show you how to get off the

mountain with it. Right now.

TRAVERS

(keying headset radio)

He's hiding twenty yards in -- be

careful.

TRAVERS

(keying headset radio)

He's right behind you!

TRAVERS

(into radio)

Something's moving fast down the

hill -- is it Tucker?

TRAVERS (O.S.)

(over radio)

Answer me! Is it Tucker?

HAL (O.S.)

(over radio)

Thanks loads.

(beat)

I couldn't have killed him without

you.

KRISTEL

How much further?

GABE

(stops)

It's right over there.

GABE

It's a storage locker for the rangers.

Everything you need to get off the

mountain is in there -- skiis, food --

I'll show you --

KRISTEL

Don't move.

KRISTEL

Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too,

right?

(moves backward)

Keep walking. Not too close.

GABE

We'd make better time walking straight

ahead. Qualen's not going to be

hopping down the bunny trail too much

longer.

KRISTEL

(walking backward)

Right. So I'd better have one less

problem when he arrives.

GABE

(knowing this means him)

Don't fuck up. You still need me to

show you a route off the mountain.

KRISTEL

You've worn that one out, Walker --

(snaps back bolt)

-- I'll find my own way down.

MAGGIE

Frank! Down here!

TRAVERS

Hop in. I know someone who'd like to

see you again before he dies.

QUALEN (O.S.)

You've come a long way to die.

QUALEN

If you were smart, you'd have left

your friend behind. I would have.

There's no shame in staying alive.

QUALEN

(aims down)

But you're not smart. And now you're

going to die from an overdose of

heroism.

QUALEN

(wiping the gash)

Stalemate, isn't it?

GABE

(winded)

Not any more.

QUALEN

Far more intimidating when it's

loaded.

HAL

(eyeing Gabe's ruined

shirt)

Nice outfit.

(hands him his parka)

I know you never liked the orange, but

--

GABE

Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear

hats, either. That's why I quit.

(pulls on parka)

You all right?

HAL

I feel better than you look. I can

live with that.

GABE

Hardly seems worth zipping, huh?

(serious now)

Frank?

HAL

It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the

helicopter.

TRAVERS

(into radio)

Qualen -- Kristel -- come in --

GABE

May I?

(dons it, keys it)

They can't talk right now, Travers.

Kristel's busy making snow angels --

and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen

is still falling.

(radio silence)

Any messages?

MAGGIE (O.S.)

(over radio)

Gabe?

GABE

(keying it)

Maggie --

TRAVERS

(into radio)

You wanted to make a trade earlier,

Walker -- still interested?

GABE (O.S.)

(pause)

I've got the money. Fly to the lake.

And if you touch her --

HAL

Now what?

GABE

I have no fucking idea.

(holds Qualen's gun)

Empty.

HAL

(smiling)

Not for long.

GABE

(sagging against rail)

Why can't anything be easy?

GABE

Stay over there --

HAL

Look -- let me --

GABE

-- what, throw snowballs at him?

Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie

out of here.

HAL

(relenting)

Count on it.

(beat)

And Gabe? Thanks for tagging along.

GABE

(smiles)

Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I

enjoyed rescue work.

WRIGHT (O.S.)

(from radio)

Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue --

urgent -- come in --

GABE

(over radio)

Remember that bet you made? About

whether I could find the money for you

or not?

(holds pack over drop)

You won.

TRAVERS

(into radio)

I'll kill her --

GABE

(over radio)

You do, and the spring thaw's going to

be worth thirty million bucks.

(pause)

No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of

time.

TRAVERS

(into radio)

All right. Drop the gun first.

GABE

(into radio)

When she's safe on the ground.

TRAVERS

(to Maggie)

Get out.

GABE

(shouting)

Run!

(she doesn't)

Run!

GABE

(into radio)

Now come and get it. My arm's getting

tired.

GABE

(shouting)

Don't you want to count it?

GABE

Don't spend it all in one place, you

son of a bitch.

HAL

He's going to run Gabe down --

GABE

Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to

die.

WRIGHT

I'm no expert -- but what do you make

of that "event"?

GABE

(mumbling)

Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying

right here. I've spent the night on

walls before -- some of the best

nights of my life have been spent

lashed to walls --

HAL

Remember -- keep your arms and legs in

the vehicle at all times --

GABE

(too tired to shout)

Fuck you --

HAL

(winded, coiling the

rope)

Jesus Christ -- you think you could

have put a little less effort into

that climb? I mean, what have you done

for me -- lately?

MAGGIE

Does this mean you're staying?

FADE OUT.
