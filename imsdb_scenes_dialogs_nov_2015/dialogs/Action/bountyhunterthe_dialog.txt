First Draft

CASS

I'm working, Stewart.

STEWART

Come on, take a break. (enticing)

I've got Kahlua...

CASS

Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.

JIMMY (O.S.)

It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.

CASS

Depends on what you got.

JIMMY (O.S.)

I've got a confirmed place and

time.

CASS

I love you! So, when? Where?

2.

JIMMY (O.S.)

You think I'm gonna say this shit

over the phone? I could get killed.

Just meet me at the usual place.

Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost

an extra hundred.

STEWART

Where ya going?

CASS

Hooters. I go there for the hot

wings.

STEWART

Please. Nobody goes there for the

hot wings. You got a tip.

CASS

You got a hundred bucks on you?

STEWART

Now are you gonna let me in on it?

CASS

Sorry. No can do. I have to protect

my source.

STEWART

You know what? We need to talk

about our relationship.

CASS

We don't have a relationship. We

made out 3 years ago in the copy

room. I was drunk. I was broken-

hearted. I would have made out with

the xerox machine.

STEWART

Yes, but you made out with me.

CASS

I have to go.

3.

STEWART

I want in on that story!

CASS

Hey, Jimmy, I...

CASS

Jimmy?

4.

CASS

Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm

warning you...

VOICE

Milo!

5.

CRYSTAL

What did I say about the fires?

MILO

You said "please set fires in my

bar". Wait, no, that's not right.

"Please don't set fires in my bar".

(off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to

get in the holiday spirit...

CRYSTAL

Shouldn't you be working?

MILO

That's the beauty of my job,

Crystal. Tracking down idiots is

something you can do pretty much

anywhere. See, there's one...

MILO

And there's another one...

MILO

And there's...

MILO

I don't believe it. That idiot. (to

Crystal) Save my seat.

6.

DWIGHT

There you are, you dipshit.

MILO

Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you

fucking ding-dong.

DWIGHT

We have to stop meeting this way.

7.

MILO

Not now, Dwight.

DWIGHT

You owe my boss money.

MILO

(LAUGHING)

Hey, I owe everybody money.

MILO

(BEAMING)

I am so happy you did that.

BOY

That man is killing Rudolph!

GELMAN

Release the reindeer!

GELMAN

Hands behind your head, asshole!

8.

MILO

Take it easy, skippy, I'm just

doing my job.

GELMAN

Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't

you get a real job?

MILO

So I can be like you patrol boys

and sit around all day with my

thumb up my ass?

GELMAN

What did you just say?

BOBBY

Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.

GELMAN

Sarg, you know this asshole?

BOBBY

Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used

to be one of us.

BOBBY

Look, Milo, I know this is a tough

time of year for you...

MILO

This isn't a tough time of year for

me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't

love Christmas?

BOBBY

...and I try to be sensitive to

your situation...

9.

MILO

What situation? Being a man who

works his own hours and has his

freedom and lives the high life?

BOBBY

...because I realize you're

unhappy.

MILO

Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?

Look at me: I'm the happiest man

alive.

BOBBY

That sign is pretty hard to see.

MILO

AAAHHH!

RUDOLPH

Take me to jail. Please?

BOBBY

Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't

Santa have any children? Cause he

only comes once a year and when he

does, it's down a chimney.

BOBBY

So. Have you talked to her lately?

MILO

Talked to who?

10.

BOBBY

Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do

you think?

MILO

I haven't talked to her in three

years, why would I talk to her now?

BOBBY

Well, for one thing, so you can

stop taking out your rage on

innocent bystanders.

RUDOLPH

(piping up from the back)

Talk to her, man. For real.

BOBBY

Do what you want. But this kind of

shit will eat a hole in your

intestines, you don't deal with it.

BOBBY

Hey, why don't you come by the

precinct tomorrow for our Xmas

bash?

MILO

I'm not invited. I'm not a cop

anymore, remember?

BOBBY

Fuck that, I'm inviting you.

MILO

I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.

BOBBY

That's what I'm worried about.

(sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?

11.

RUDOLPH

You should go to that party, man.

Seriously. You need it.

MILO

Do I look like I need advice from a

grown man in antlers?

VOICE

Milo. Hey. Princess...

SID

You're drooling on my sofa.

SID

You do have an apartment, don't

you? With a bed of some kind?

SID

Heard you shut down 5th Street

yesterday. Gave every kid in the

county the gift of nightmares.

MILO

Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.

Anyway, what do you care? I brought

your guy in, right?

12.

SID

You gonna give me a hand, or just

stand there killing your liver?

MILO

Is that a trick question?

SID

So I told her, fine, I'd handle

Xmas this year. I mean, what's to

handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,

cook a ham, hang some lights. An

idiot could do it.

MILO

Well, we'll soon find out.

SID

You have plans for the holiday?

MILO

The usual.

SID

Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and

put your fist through a wall?

MILO

Jealous?

SID

Then forget it.

MILO

Forget what?

SID

I've got an open bond, but your

thing sounds like more fun. I'll

give it to Doug instead.

13.

MILO

Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the

fuck. I want the job, I'm in the

hole.

SID

You're always in the hole.

MILO

What's your point?

SID

(SIGHING)

The truth is, I'm not sure you're

the right person for this job. It

could be a total disaster. On the

other hand, when one friend sees

another friend stagnating in his

own filth, he has to do something,

right?

MILO

Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna

shower.

SID

Ok. But remember: you asked for it.

MILO

No.

SID

Yes.

MILO

No.

SID

Yes.

MILO

No.

SID

Are we done yet?

14.

MILO

Is this a joke? Because if it is,

I'm gonna have to kill you.

SID

It's not a joke.

MILO

She got arrested? And then she

jumped bail?

SID

Apparently the whole thing started

with some reckless driving, and

ended with her assaulting a police

officer.

SID

(EXPLAINING)

She bit him.

MILO

Yeah. That sounds like her.

But here's my question: why the

hell did you post her bail?

SID

Hey, I know she dumped you...

MILO

Whoa. She did not "dump me".

SID

(QUICKLY)

Ok, whatever, I...

MILO

No, not "whatever". I dumped her.

SID

The point is, I'm aware you guys

have issues, but I'm running a

business here. A person needs bail,

I don't have time to check with you

first.

MILO

Well, had you checked with me

first, you wouldn't be out of a

bond right now.

15.

SID

I'm not out of a bond if you go

pick her up. It's five grand to

bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.

MILO

(SLOWLY)

You're telling me it's five grand

to go pick up my ex-wife and bring

her to jail. (beat) On Xmas.

SID

You're a good listener.

SID

I take it you're interested.

MILO

I love you! You're the best friend

a guy could ever have!

SID

Ok, take it easy...

TERESA

Sid, you got a DUI on line one.

(off their looks) What's going on?

TERESA

Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?

MILO

Right. Sorry.

MILO

You know what this is, don't you?

Karma! Payback! You know how they

say "What goes around comes

around"? Turns out it's true!

(MORE)

16.

MILO (cont'd)

(checking the paper) That middle

initial stands for Rhonda, by the

way. She tells people it stands for

"Rachel", but that's a lie.

SID

I can't believe you guys broke up

over a stupid article.

MILO

We didn't break up over a stupid

article. We broke up because she is

a cheating, manipulative liar.

SID

Are you sure you can handle this?

MILO

Why wouldn't I be able to handle

this?

SID

Let's face it: you're not exactly

rational around her. I mean, if I

was a cop working a case and some

reporter came snooping around, I'd

say "no comment". Not "no comment,

but care for a cocktail"? And then

a month later, running off to some

love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"

and tying the knot? Who does that?

MILO

That's not even close to what

happened. For one thing, it was

called "Cupid's Cabin". And for

another, that was before I knew how

conniving she was. Now I know. So

all I have to do is track her down,

cuff her up, and bring her in.

(checking his watch) And I've got,

what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as

pie.

17.

LORRAINE

(into phone)

You tell him I know where he lives.

I know where his bimbo wife takes

her yoga classes, I know where his

idiot son shoplifts after school,

so he can pay me my money or...

LORRAINE

What the hell happened to you?

DWIGHT

Milo Boyd. Fucker head-butted me.

LORRAINE

(not interested)

Yeah? Did you get the money?

18.

MILO

Luck be a lady...

MILO

Toooo....NIIIIIGHT!

MILO

(to his weapons)

I told you this day would come.

CASS

Jimmy?

19.

MILO

You better run, you crazy bitch.

SID

Yeah. He took the job. But if this

thing goes bad, I'm blaming you.

MILO

Nice dog. Very compact.

MILO

Candygram.

20.

MILO

Whoops.

21.

MILO

`Allo, love.

CASS

HIIIII-YAAAA!!!

CASS

Whoops.

STEWART

(poor liar)

...so, I heard a noise in here and

became concerned...

MILO

Wrong. Try again.

STEWART

Ok, the truth is she asked me to

pick up her dry-cleaning...

22.

STEWART

(CRACKING)

Ok, Ok, look, she's working a big

story that was supposed to be mine,

and I want it back.

MILO

You sleeping with her, Stu?

STEWART

(turning red)

You mean, like, at this moment?

MILO

Yeah, that's what I mean. Are you

sleeping with her at this very

moment?

STEWART

We have a history, yes.

MILO

A "history", huh? (snorting) Good

luck with that.

CASS

Here, kitty kitty...

CASS

Aahh!

LANDLADY

You're not Jimmy.

CASS

(recovering quickly)

Oh. No. I'm looking for him.

LANDLADY

Under the sofa?

23.

CASS

Maybe you can help. I'm his

girlfriend.

LANDLADY

(SKEPTICAL)

You're LaKeesha?

CASS

Yes. That's my name. LaKeesha.

LANDLADY

Maybe I should call the cops.

CASS

Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble.

LANDLADY

What kind of trouble? Money

trouble? Drug trouble? (lower) Sex-

change trouble?

CASS

Something like that. All I know is,

he's missing.

LANDLADY

I've had a lousy week, too. My

cousin Linda fell off a cruise

ship.

CASS

Oh. I'm sorry.

LANDLADY

Hey. A grown woman outta know how

to swim.

CASS

I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a

quick look around?

LANDLADY

Jimmy's behind on his rent. I bet

his girlfriend would want to take

care of that.

24.

CASS

I bet she would.

MILO

The thing is, Stu, she'll make you

think she's interested in you, when

really all she's interested in is

the case you're working on, because

she wants to launch her big hot-

shot career.

STEWART

Wait a second: you're Milo. She

talks about you all the time.

MILO

(immediately interested)

Really?

STEWART

Oh yeah, dude. She hates you.

MILO

Oh, she hates me?

STEWART

Yeah. She says you're the most

selfish, immature, stubborn...

MILO

(INTERRUPTING)

I'm selfish? I'm immature? You know

what? Forget it. I'm not even gonna

dignify this with...whatever.

STEWART

Hey, man, I'm on your team.

MILO

No you're not, Geraldo. I don't

allow reporters on my team.

25.

MILO

And for the record: I'm the one who

hates her. Just so that's clear.

MILO

(to himself)

That figures. Run home to mommy.

MILO

Well, nice meeting ya, Stu.

STEWART

Wait, where are you going?

MILO

I'm going to pick up your

girlfriend. But don't worry, if she

ever gets out of jail, I'm sure

you'll be very happy together.

LANDLADY

Time's up. Find anything?

CASS

Nope. Not a thing.

LANDLADY

Oh, well. Don't worry, hon. He

probably just went away for the

holidays.

26.

JIMMY

(PANICKING)

Ok, ok, I told one person about the

Xmas Eve job, but she doesn't even

have all the details, I swear!

MAHLER

Gimme a name.

MILO

...and this loser she's dating

looks like he buys his clothes from

Kmart.

SID

Why do you care?

MILO

I don't. I just think it's funny.

SID

Hilarious. Listen to me: you guys

made a terrible couple.

MILO

I know that. You don't have to tell

me that.

27.

SID

Relationships aren't about

competition, they're about

compromise.

MILO

You mean like when your wife wants

to do one thing, and you want to do

another, and you compromise by

doing what she wants?

SID

Exactly. Now just get her here.

Cause I can't afford to lose this

bond.

MILO

No worries. In fact, I already know

where she is and I'm gonna go pick

her up right now.

VOICE

Milo Boyd. Ex-cop, current bounty

hunter...

RAY

...lives in Jersey City, drives a

68 Caddy. Been in the hole on and

off with us the past 3 years. We

checked his place, his hangouts, no

luck.

28.

LORRAINE

This is no good. We let this guy

slide, suddenly everybody thinks,

hey, it's the holidays! All debts

are cancelled! Get the word out, I

want this guy brought here so he

can pay what he owes us, Dwight can

break something of his, and we can

all enjoy our Xmas.

STEWART

That's my space, you asshole!

MILO

Happy to see you, too.

LOIS

How dare you...after what you did

to my baby...

MILO

Ok. What say we do this inside?

29.

MILO

What happened to the pirate show?

LOIS

I got sick of it. Now I'm a female

impersonator.

MILO

But...you are female.

LOIS

That's why I'm so good at it. Help

me with this.

MILO

Where is she, Lois? I need to talk

to her.

LOIS

Oh, Milo, where did it all go

wrong? Do you have any idea what it

means to waste a woman's child-

bearing years? It's criminal. Every

month her eggs are jumping out of

her ovaries like sailors abandoning

a sinking ship. I mean, I know you

were mad about that article...

MILO

I wasn't mad about that article. In

fact: what article?

LOIS

Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be

a strong independent woman on the

outside, but on the inside she's

just a girl who wants to be

protected and loved by her man.

What happened between the two of

you devastated her.

MILO

Devastated her right to the top.

LOIS

(BEAMING)

She has done well, hasn't she?

(MORE)

30.

LOIS (cont'd)

I must admit, it makes me proud to

think that my little girl, whose

only friend growing up was an

imaginary orphan with a tin leg

named Leslie, now gets invited to

tour the White House...

MILO

She got to tour the White House?

MILO

Tell me where she is, Lois.

LOIS

Oh, who knows. She was running

around like a chicken with its head

cut off, said she was on the

biggest story of her career. Said

she was going somewhere to think.

STEWART

Dammit.

31.

CASS

(into phone)

No one with that name? What about a

casino? Nothing? Thanks.

CASS

Jimmy?

STEWART

No, who's Jimmy?

CASS

Look, Stewart, I'm busy.

STEWART

Ok. (casually) Where are you, by

the way? I mean, exactly.

CASS

I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm

on the beach building a sand castle

and drinking from a coconut...

MILO

Hello, Cass.

CASS

Hello, Milo.

MILO

Fancy meeting you here.

CASS

Yeah. Fancy that.

32.

MILO

How are you?

CASS

Fine. You?

MILO

Swell. Nice day.

CASS

Bright.

MILO

Brisk.

CASS

Crisp.

MILO

Invigorating.

CASS

(can't hold out anymore)

What are you doing here?

MILO

"Building a sand castle, drinking

from a coconut". Man, once a liar,

always a liar.

CASS

You know what? I don't have time

for this, I'm working.

MILO

Working? Hey, me too.

CASS

Congratulations. Move your leg.

MILO

What I do is, I track down

criminals. People who jumped bail.

Idiots who decided to go on the run

after biting police officers. I

find them, and I take them to jail.

33.

CASS

Now, hold on just a second, Milo...

MILO

Tell you what: I'll give you more

than a second. I'll give you 10.

For old times sake.

MILO

10...9...8...

MILO

Strike one.

MILO

Strike two.

MILO

Strike three. Get in.

CASS

I'm not going to jail, Milo.

34.

MILO

I beg to differ.

CASS

Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot

me.

MILO

Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a

cab driver.

CASS

Chicken shits.

CASS

Ok, look: let's talk about this.

MILO

Ok.

CASS

(UNCOMFORTABLE)

Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we

should...

CASS

Hey, wait a minute!

CASS (O.S.)

Bastard.

35.

CASS (O.S.)

Great. Perfect timing.

CASS

Cassidy Daley.

JIMMY

It's me. Jimmy.

CASS

(exhaling with relief)

Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were

dead.

JIMMY

Don't be silly. (hurrying on)

Listen: you didn't happen to go to

my place and find that envelope I

left, did you?

CASS

I did, but I don't really get it,

what's "Sparrow"?

JIMMY

It doesn't matter. Did you tell

anyone else about this story?

CASS

Are you kidding? You think I want

to share a story like this?

JIMMY

Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there

is no story. I made the whole thing

up. So you should just drop it...

CASS

Uh-uh, no way are you backing out

on me now, Jimmy. This story is way

too good...

36.

JIMMY

(QUICKLY)

Where are you?

CASS

I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-

husband's car. Long story. More

importantly, where are you?

JIMMY

I'm...

CASS

Jimmy? Hello?

MILO (O.S.)

Deck the halls with boughs of

holly, fa la la la laaaa...

TERESA

Sid's Bail Bonds.

MILO

Guess who's in my trunk?

TERESA

Is that some sort of perverted

innuendo? Who is this?

MILO

Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's

me. Put Sid on.

37.

TERESA

Sid's busy shopping. (snorts) He

thinks he can handle Xmas.

MILO

Ok, just tell him I got her and

I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a

bonus for bringing her in so quick.

TERESA

Yeah? I want a bonus for getting

through the holidays without

stabbing anyone with a fork.

MILO

Don't be such a pessimist. You

still have time.

MILO

Gotta go. I got another call.

MILO

Tina's Thai massage! Where every

ending is a happy one!

CASS

You're disgusting. Let me out of

the trunk.

MILO

Hmm. Nope. By the way, your

boyfriend Stewart's been following

me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch

him at the track.

CASS

Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And

wait: who said he's my boyfriend?

MILO

Aw, don't be embarrassed. These

things happen. You were drunk when

you guys hooked up, right?

38.

CASS

You know what, Milo? I shouldn't

have run from you like that. I

was...I don't know. You caught me

off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind

of in some trouble and I could

really use your help.

MILO

Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't

help you if you were the very last

baby sea turtle in the world,

dragging its tiny weak body across

the burning hot sand while sea

gulls circled overhead. I'd just

pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,

and let nature take its course.

MILO

Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no

more. You can cry til the cows come

home, for all I care.

MILO

Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,

Cass? (no response) Cassidy?

39.

MILO

It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...

CASS

You know something, Milo? You're

one of the most gullible...

MILO

AAAAHHH...

CASS

Ow ow ow...

MILO

Son of a...

CASS

AAGH...

MILO

OW...

40.

CASS

NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!

CASS

Dirty fighter.

MILO

Me? I'm the dirty fighter?

CASS

Should we...I don't know...hug, or

something?

MILO

Sure. What the hell.

CASS

Hey. I had to try, right?

MILO

Get in the car.

CASS

Your windshield's cracked.

MILO

Thanks, Captain Obvious.

41.

CASS

And you look like shit, Milo. What

have you been doing, sleeping on

the floor?

MILO

I enjoy sleeping on the floor.

Matter of fact, I love sleeping on

the floor. I love everything about

my life. Great job, good friends,

hot girlfriend...

CASS

You have a girlfriend?

MILO

(he does not)

Yes I do.

CASS

Really? What's her name?

MILO

(the first name that pops

into his head:)

Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to

cook pasta for me and perform strip-

teases.

CASS

Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?

MILO

Oh, she has all her chromosomes,

believe you me.

CASS

Well, my life is great, too.

MILO

I can tell. You and Stewart make a

great couple, by the way. You and

me made a terrible couple. But you

two? Like peas in a pod.

42.

CASS

You know what I like about Stewart?

MILO

I can't imagine.

CASS

He's not you.

MILO

Not even on his best day.

CASS

Or his worst.

MILO

I'll bet he has a lot of those.

CASS

Still betting, huh?

MILO

You can't win if you don't play.

CASS

Or, in your case, even if you do.

MILO

I win all the time.

CASS

Really? I hadn't noticed.

MILO

You know what? Seeing as how I'm

about to come into five grand...

MILO

I think I'll do a little betting

right now.

CASS

Don't you have to take me back?

MILO

Please. I have two days. A monkey

could get you back in two days.

43.

CASS

Aren't you afraid I'll get away?

MILO

Nope.

STEWART

Damn, I'm good!

CLERK

Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!

CLERK

What a nice surprise! Let's hope

your luck is better today.

MILO

(QUICKLY)

Sure, if there's such a thing as

better than great, which is how my

luck has been lately. Great.

44.

CLERK

(AWKWARD)

Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.

LORRAINE

The idiot just showed up at

Bally's.

DWIGHT

(QUICKLY)

I'm on it.

LORRAINE

Uh-uh. Not you. (calling out) RAY.

LORRAINE

Go get this asshole.

MILO

Prepare to observe the master.

CASS

Ok, how about this:

CASS

If I give you all the cash in my

wallet, will you let me go?

MILO

Hmm. Lemme see...

45.

MILO

Nope. Guess not.

MILO

(to the dealer)

Hit me.

CASS

I'd really like to.

DEALER

Dealer wins.

CASS

Nice going, master.

WAITRESS

And for the couple over here?

MILO

(QUICKLY)

We're not a couple.

CASS

(just as quick)

Why would you think we were a

couple?

MILO

We used to be together. Back when I

was young and foolish.

CASS

And I was confused.

MILO

And I was slumming.

CASS

And I was drunk.

46.

WAITRESS

(BORED)

Great story. I have to get back to

work now.

MILO

Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.

MILO

(under his breath)

Son of a bitch.

CASS

Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom

is in the hospital.

MILO

Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?

CASS

She might be really sick. That's

why I had to jump bail.

MILO

(overly sincere)

Taking care of her, huh? Putting

aside your career for a loved one?

Golly, that's so you.

CASS

You've already been to see her.

MILO

Impressive. No wonder you got all

those awards. So lemme guess: the

real reason you jumped bail is

cause you're on a story.

CASS

Stewart. Stewart told you.

47.

MILO

(CAUGHT)

I would have figured it out on my

own, trust me.

CASS

I wouldn't trust you if you were

the last man alive.

MILO

You think about that much? Me being

the last man alive? Am I naked in

this fantasy?

CASS

Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.

A very important story. It just so

happens that I'm possibly about to

uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.

CASS

What?

MILO

Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"

thing kind of old? Maybe you should

do a story about something people

are interested in. Like internet

porn. Or lesbians.

CASS

I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be

big. And here's what I'm willing to

do (magnanimous): I'm willing to

credit you in the article.

MILO

Oh, sure, like you credited me in

the 13th Street Article?

CASS

Why on earth would I have credited

you? I worked my ass off for that

story.

MILO

That's one way of putting it.

48.

CASS

What's that supposed to mean?

MILO

Forget it. I don't want to be in

your article. In fact, I would

rather eat a bowl of broken glass

than have my name in any way

associated with one of your lousy

articles...

CASS

Fine. Forget I mentioned it.

MILO

I already have.

CASS

I mean, you're not a cop anymore,

right? What do you care if people

were murdered?

MILO

Please. Nobody was murdered.

CASS

Just my source.

MILO

(SUSPICIOUS)

Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of

the head?

CASS

Well...

MILO

Dumped in a reservoir?

CASS

(FLUSTERED)

I don't know.

MILO

Car accident?

CASS

Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered

yet. But I wouldn't be surprised

if...

49.

CASS

Maybe this whole thing sounds like

no big deal to you...

MILO

You know what it sounds like? It

sounds like you're going to jail.

CASS

Milo, listen, you have to believe

me, come on, you know me...

MILO

(getting red)

Exactly! I do know you. Which means

I know you are a deceptive, cold-

hearted bitch who is going to jail

where she belongs.

WAITRESS

Champagne. So. What are we

celebrating?

CASS

(GRIMLY)

I have to use the bathroom.

WAITRESS

Alrightee, then. Cheers.

CASS

Can I have some privacy, please?

50.

MILO

I'm gonna have to frisk you.

CASS

Get it over with, then.

MILO

You gain a little weight?

CASS

(snapping back)

You lose a little hair?

CASS

Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in

my breasts.

MILO

Make it quick.

STEWART

Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)

Can I help you?

RAY

Night-night.

51.

MILO

You almost done in there?

CASS

"Put open end in direct contact

with skin. Press button..."

MILO (O.S.)

Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm

coming in...

CASS

Sorry...

VOICE

Need a lift?

52.

CASS

He says we made a terrible couple.

Which is true. I know that. I'm the

one who thought that first. I'm the

one who came up with that. The fact

is, I don't want to be with someone

who can't admit he was wrong.

DRIVER

So you're available.

CASS

Available for what?

DRIVER

I have a waterbed in my trailer.

CASS

I hope you don't think you're

telling me something that interests

me.

DRIVER

You know what I want for Xmas?

MILO

You better run.

53.

CASS

Hey, it's locked!

MILO

(GRINNING)

I know.

CASS

Open the door, you son of a bitch!

CASS

Uh-oh...

LORRAINE

Ray's got something to show you.

RAY

Merry Xmas.

54.

LORRAINE

Pick something and break it.

STEWART

Whoa, wait just a minute...

LORRAINE

Feel better?

DWIGHT

You know, I do feel better. (beat)

Who is this guy, anyway?

LORRAINE

Milo Boyd.

DWIGHT

That's not Milo Boyd.

RAY

He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac.

LORRAINE

Both of you go this time, and make

sure you get the right guy. I don't

have time for this shit.

STEWART

What about me?

55.

CASS

Clever. (noting all the weapons)

Wow. You were gonna use all that

stuff on me?

MILO

A guy can dream, can't he?

CASS

Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear

the air, Ok? So maybe it was a

mistake, thinking we could be

involved while working on the same

case...

MILO

Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't

think you're telling me something I

don't know, cause you're not.

CASS

(deep breath)

Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside

our differences for two seconds?

Because back at the casino, I think

I saw someone following me.

MILO

Sure that wasn't me?

CASS

I don't think so. This guy was

lacking your trademark smell of

booze and KFC.

MILO

Ha ha.

CASS

Anywho. If these dirty cops have my

source hostage somewhere...

CASS

What's so funny?

56.

MILO

You think dirty cops are trying to

kill you? Look, I know you think

you're hot shit and everything, but

I'm pretty sure the only one around

here who might want to kill you is

me.

CASS

Oh no.

MILO

What?

CASS

Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw

back at the casino.

MILO

Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to

me.

CASS

(freaking out)

Speed up!

MILO

Would you just calm down for a

second and...

CASS

NO!!

MILO

Jesus christ...

MILO

LISTEN, YOU MANIAC...

CASS

MILO...

57.

MILO

...LET GO...

CASS

MILO...

MILO

...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU...

CASS

MILO!!!

MILO

SHIT!!!

58.

CASS

I told you they were trying to kill

me!

MILO

Yeah, well, no one's killing you

until I get you to jail.

CASS

You're still taking me to jail? But

it's the cops who are after me.

MILO

First of all: that guy was not a

cop. Second of all, we just left

him unconscious in a ditch. You'll

be fine.

CASS

But...this is important! This is my

job!

MILO

And this...(pointing between them)

is my job.

CASS

Milo, you don't understand what's

going on!

MILO

I'll lay it out for you: some loser

with a minor sheet calls you up and

says, hey, I've got a big story for

you, you interested? It'll only

cost you a couple hundred bucks,

and I'll tip you onto some criminal

activity, it's your chance to

expose some bad guys and write the

story of your life. Then the moron

gets himself caught, he's probably

in cold storage somewhere, and now

you think the bad guys are after

you. (beat) See? I get it. I just

don't care.

59.

CASS

(CASUALLY)

If only I knew exactly when and

where this deal was going down.

Course, if I can't figure out that

part, then you definitely can't

figure out that part, because we

both know I'm much smarter than

you.

MILO

Please. My brain can dance circles

around your brain.

CASS

I don't even know what that means.

MILO

Case closed.

CASS

(SHRUGGING)

Fine. Guess we'll never know.

MILO

"Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."

What's "Sparrow"?

CASS

I knew you couldn't figure it out.

MILO

(QUICKLY)

It's a business.

CASS

No.

MILO

Casino.

CASS

Nope.

MILO

Stripper?

60.

CASS

I don't think so. What kind of

strip bars have you been going to,

anyway?

CASS

Oh, well, forget it, I knew you

couldn't do it.

MILO

Please. I could crack that story

and still get you to jail on time.

CASS

Oh yeah?

CASS

Wanna bet?

MILO

You're on.

MILO

I have to make a call.

CASS

Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?

MILO

Why? You going somewhere?

CASS

Um...no.

MILO

Then you don't need to be uncuffed.

61.

CASS

(to herself)

Asshole.

MILO

So there's just gonna be a little

delay...

SID

I don't get it. Why are you helping

her?

MILO

But that's the beauty of it, Sid,

I'm not helping her, she only

thinks I'm helping her.

SID

Yeah? If you're not helping her,

what are you doing?

CASS

(to herself)

What is he up to?

62.

MILO

I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm

gonna crack this case first, and

I'm gonna take all the credit. Who

knows, maybe I'll even get my job

back....

SID

You are so full of shit. You don't

want your job back. You just want

to prove you're smarter than she

is.

MILO

(instantly heated)

I am smarter than she is. I would

have cracked that 13th Street case

way before she did if she hadn't...

SID

...cheated, right, I know, you've

told me a million times. Did it

ever occur to you that a normal

couple wouldn't compete the way you

guys do in the first place?

MILO

This from the man currently trying

to prove to his wife he can handle

Xmas.

SID

(instantly heated)

I can handle Xmas!

MILO

Just..trust me, Ok?

SID

Do I have a choice?

MILO

Nope.

63.

MILO (O.S.)

So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...

MILO

...so what exactly are these dirty

cops supposed to be doing?

CASS

Stealing evidence from property

rooms. Then destroying it, for the

right price.

CASS

What?

MILO

Nothing. It's just...it's a good

idea. If it weren't, you know.

Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan

is to catch them red-handed before

they can destroy the evidence, then

write an expose for the paper and

win yourself another big award.

CASS

Something like that.

MILO

Only, you don't know what Sparrow

is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.

Or the place where the evidence is

stashed. Or a code word of some

kind. But the guy who knows has

gone missing, and you think the

dirty cops got a hold of him.

64.

CASS

(NODDING)

When Jimmy called earlier, someone

else was there. And they

disconnected the call.

MILO

So we find your source, we find the

dirty cops. Gimme your phone.

CASS

What?

BOBBY (O.S.)

Milo! Merry Xmas!

BOBBY

Here's one: why did the snowman

pull down his pants? Cause he heard

the snowblower was coming!

MILO

Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor.

BOBBY

Anything.

MILO

I need an address to go with a

phone number. But I need it ASAP.

Kinda got a guy on my tail...

TOW TRUCK DRIVER

The garage is closed for the night.

Guess you'll have to wait til

tomorrow.

65.

MAHLER

Guess not.

CASS

Pretty proud of yourself, ey?

MILO

Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But

I used to be a cop. Let's face it:

I'm naturally gonna be one step

ahead of you.

CASS

(under her breath)

You weren't last time.

MILO

What did you say?

CASS

I said you're doing a great job.

66.

CASS

Ok, here's what I think we should

do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows

me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure

he'll give me a sign...

MILO

Excellent plan. Oh, except you're

staying in the car.

CASS

(shouting after him)

But...it's my story!

CASS

Asshole.

MILO

(steadying the guy)

You Ok? My bad.

DRUNK GUY

Watch where you're going. (under

his breath) Prick.

MILO

(calling after him)

Merry Xmas to you, too!

67.

MILO

Room service.

MILO

What the...?

MILO

(loud whisper)

What the hell are you doing?

CASS

(SAME)

It's my story, I don't break

stories by staying in the car!

MILO

Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)

you're paying for that.

CASS

Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.

68.

MILO

Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.

MILO

(LOUD)

Godammit. Son of a bitch.

MILO

(to Cass)

This is like the third card they've

given me...

CASS

(playing along)

Take it easy, honey...

MILO

Don't tell me to take it easy, now

we have to go all the way

downstairs again...

MAID

What's the name?

MILO

Davenport. Room 2505.

MILO

You're an angel.

69.

CASS

(WHISPERING)

Wait a second: where's my gun?

MILO

(SAME)

I don't know. Where is your gun?

CASS

I don't have one.

MILO

Then you've answered your own

question.

CASS

Come on, give me something. You've

got, like, a million weapons in the

jacket.

MILO

Hey. These are not toys. You can't

just give them to someone and have

them know how to use them.

CASS

I seem to remember doing just fine

with your taser gun.

70.

CASS

Oh, god, is that blood?

MILO

Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.

CASS

I'm just trying to...

MILO

This could be a crime scene. There

are clues all over this room that

only a trained eye can find. And as

I seem to recall, you were the one

who was unable to figure this out

by herself.

CASS

(under her breath)

He is unbelievable.

MILO

Who are you talking to, your

imaginary friend Leslie?

CASS

(BLUSHING)

Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary

friends, despite what my mother

believes.

MILO

Whatever. You wait by the door. And

I'll handle this.

CASS

(PISSED)

Fine.

CASS

So you're saying you don't want my

help.

MILO

I'm saying I don't need your help.

71.

CASS

(SHRUGGING)

Ok.

MILO

What was that?

CASS

(INNOCENTLY)

What was what?

MILO

Did you find something?

CASS

How could I find anything? I'm not

the detective.

MILO

Lemme see your purse...

VOICE

FREEZE!

GUARD

Hotel security! Stay where you are!

MILO

Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably

gonna want this.

GUARD

(PANICKED)

DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!

MILO

Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload

it.

72.

MILO

You're gonna have to jump.

CASS

I can't.

BOBBY (O.S.)

Ok, so some guy you're looking for

has disappeared. You want me to put

out an all-points on him?

MILO

(into phone)

The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks

dirty cops might be involved.

73.

BOBBY

Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with

Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when

you're around her your brain turns

to mush.

MILO

Yeah, well, that doesn't change the

fact that someone took a couple

shots at us.

BOBBY

You get a plate number?

MILO

Happened too quick. But it was a

dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,

New Jersey plates, and the car was

wrecked, I know that.

BOBBY

Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I

can find. Just hold tight, Ok?

MILO

Ok. But we're kinda on a clock

here.

BOBBY

Milo, don't fuck around with this.

If there are dirty cops in the

house, we all have a problem. So do

me a favor: get off the strip, find

somewhere to lie low and wait for

my call.

74.

DWIGHT

Yeah, that's him.

RAY

Who's the chick?

DWIGHT

Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they

can't be far.

CASS (O.S.)

Ok. Kill me now.

MILO

I'm sorry, it's the only place I

know off the strip.

CASS

I'm not going in. What if they

remember us?

MILO

They won't remember us. Why would

they remember us? Just...try to act

normal.

75.

DAWN

Can I help you? (realizing) Wait,

it can't be...

DAWN

(to the back room)

Edmund, come quick!

EDMUND

Be still my beating heart.

MILO

(LOW)

Looks like they remember us.

CASS

(SAME)

Ya think?

EDMUND

What a lovely surprise. It's been,

what, 3 years?

MILO

Has it?

CASS

I don't really remember...

DAWN

(REALIZING)

And you came back! To celebrate

your anniversary!

CASS

Oh, no. No, no...

76.

EDMUND

What an honor for us!

CASS

Actually, we're not...

DAWN

You know what? In light of this

special special occasion: it's on

the house!

MILO

Honey? Can I talk to you?

MILO

(LOW)

You have any money?

CASS

(SAME)

No, as you recall, I gave you all

my money at the blackjack table...

(realizing) You blew all the money!

MILO

Hey! I would have won it back if

someone hadn't tasered me in the

bathroom!

CASS

So. Use a credit card.

MILO

Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.

CASS

Mine's max'd too. (off his look)

What, I like to shop.

MILO/CASS

It's our third anniversary!

DAWN/EDMUND

Congratulations!

77.

MILO/CASS

Thanks!

EDMUND

To begin: a little aphrodisiac!

MILO

(GRIMLY)

Wow.

CASS

(SAME)

Great.

EDMUND

So tell me: how have you managed to

keep the romance alive all this

time?

MILO

Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.

The secret to our success is that

the little woman here knows her

place. She cleans for me, cooks for

me, and every night when I come

home she gets down on her knees and

massages my feet.

CASS

Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage

his feet to help him feel like a

man. It's important, especially

when your husband has such a teeny

tiny...

78.

DAWN

How is everything? Is it like that

magical night 3 years ago?

CASS

Uh-huh.

MILO

Yup. You betcha.

DAWN

This calls for a toast!

DAWN

(to the room)

May I have your attention please?

Edmund and I would like to share

with you the most romantic moment

we have ever seen. It was three

years ago today, in this very

restaurant, when this lovely young

man here, right in the middle of

the meal, threw down his napkin,

got down on one knee, and said

marry me, right now, right this

second, I want to go to sleep

tonight knowing you're my wife!

EDMUND

(jumping in)

And she said yes, with tears in her

eyes and a tremble in her hand,

let's get married, and they ran out

to the all night chapel and came

back an hour later, man and wife!

MILO

Can I get a whiskey?

CASS

Make that two.

79.

MILO

After we broke up, I was so mad at

you, I told everyone I know you

have herpes.

CASS

I told everyone you flunked out of

3rd grade.

MILO

I told everyone you have a

moustache.

CASS

I told everyone you like to wear my

panties.

MILO

Hey!

CASS

Wow. This would be really awkward

if we still had feelings for each

other. Which we don't...

MILO

That's right. Luckily, we're

different people now. We don't feel

the way we used to.

CASS

Right. We've moved on.

MILO

We have no feelings about each

other whatsoever.

MILO

Just two people who used to know

each other.

CASS

Two casual acquaintances.

80.

MILO

Feels good, doesn't it?

CASS

Feels fantastic.

MILO

A platonic relationship. Working

together.

CASS

Helping each other.

MILO

Trusting each other.

CASS

Well. Mind if I shower?

MILO

Ladies first.

CASS

(LOW)

Hey. It's me.

MOM (O.S.)

Sheryl?

81.

CASS

No, not Sheryl. Cass. (beat) Your

daughter.

MOM

Jesus Christ, where the hell are

ya, Niagara Falls?

CASS

No. You're not gonna believe this,

but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with

Milo.

MOM

(GASPING)

Oh my god...

CASS

Mom...

MOM

I always knew you two would...

CASS

Mom. We're not back together.

MOM

Why the hell not?

82.

MOM

I mean, I just don't get it, you're

in this romantic place, you have a

perfect opportunity to win him

back...

CASS

Why should I have to win him back?

He should have to win me back! And

who says I want him back, anyway?

MOM

I have never understood this

competitive streak of yours...

CASS

(losing her patience)

Look, the reason I called: I

remember you worked at this one

place where they had these bright

green matches with, like, this

silhouette of a horse on them?

MOM

(immediately defensive)

That was a long time ago! And all I

did was serve drinks...

CASS

I just need to know the name of the

place.

MOM

Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I

did a little dancing, but how often

do you make 200 an hour in tips?

CASS

I gotta go.

MOM

I want grandkids!

83.

MILO

(to himself)

Sneaky bitch.

CASS

(to herself)

Sneaky bastard.

MILO

Good shower?

CASS

The best.

MILO

Great.

CASS

You know what's great? Trusting

each other.

MILO

I agree.

MILO

Time for bed!

84.

MILO

Excuse me.

MILO

What are you doing?

CASS

Um...

MILO

Are you trying to seduce me?

CASS

(SWALLOWING)

Yes. Yes I am.

MILO

(INNOCENTLY)

I didn't know you were still so

attracted to me. I mean, I remember

how you used to like to greet me at

the door in nothing but a...

85.

CASS

(INTERRUPTING)

Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted

to you.

MILO

Really? Wow. That's great news. You

know what would be really sexy

right now?

CASS

If we both just went to sleep?

MILO

No. If you talked dirty to me.

CASS

Ok. (in a sexy voice) Sewage. Mold.

Rotting carcass...

MILO

No, I mean, tell me about your

attraction to me.

CASS

Um...I can't stop thinking about

you.

MILO

Really? What part of me?

CASS

Just...all of you.

MILO

Be specific.

MILO

(HELPFULLY)

My great hair? My chest?

Or...something lower like...

86.

MILO

My gun?

MILO

I knew I couldn't trust you!

CASS

I knew I couldn't trust you!

MILO

When were you gonna tell me about

the matches you found back there in

the hotel room?

CASS

When were you gonna tell me you

have no intention of helping me

with my story?

MILO

(SHRUGGING)

You're right. I'm not helping you.

This is my story now. This time I

get to come out on top! Karma,

babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma....

CASS

Oh my god, would you get over it

already! So I cracked the case

before you did, it was 3 years ago,

it happened, stop being such a baby

and move on!

MILO

Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm

moving on? By cracking this case

before you, then taking you in so

you can spend this Xmas in jail,

all alone.

87.

JIMMY

So this is your place, huh? Nice.

Cozy. Probably more fun to sit

where you can actually see the

dancers, but...

JIMMY

Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that,

I swear I'll be as quiet as a

mouse.

MAHLER

I know you will.

MILO

I'm just curious.

TERESA

No, I do not keep my ex's photo in

my wallet.

88.

SID

What's the problem now?

MILO

No problem...

TERESA

She keeps their wedding photo in

her wallet. He wants to know what

that means.

SID

It means she's madly in love with

you.

MILO

Really?

SID

No, you idiot, it means she hasn't

cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.

I'm pretty sure I'm still carrying

around a condom from 1987. (to one

of the kids) Son of a bitch,

Jeremy, don't eat things you find

on the floor.

TERESA

I think it means she loves him.

MILO

Really? Cause it did make me

wonder...

SID

Why do you care? Listen to me: you

hate this girl, remember? You drank

yourself out of a job over this

girl.

MILO

I quit my job.

SID

You were fired.

MILO

I quit by getting myself fired.

TERESA

Are you sleeping with her?

89.

SID

Teresa, get off the line. I knew I

should have sent Doug. Milo, do me

a favor. Don't call me again until

you get her to jail.

MILO

(to himself)

Shit.

MILO

What was that about?

CASS

Nothing. I had her add mayo to your

burger. I remember you like that.

MILO

Oh. (surprised) Thanks.

MILO

Ok, look: I know you're probably

upset that you're not gonna get the

story. But a person can't win every

time, right?

CASS

Depends on the person.

MILO

Whadya mean?

CASS

Well, if the person you're

referring to is you, I agree: you

can't win every time.

CASS

(INNOCENTLY)

What's wrong?

90.

MILO

(choking a little)

This burger...

CASS

One day stuff like that is gonna

kill ya. (pause) Who knows? Maybe

even today.

MILO

My tug...is thwelling...(gasping)

I tink dere might be sesame...

CASS

Yeah, I had her add that with the

mayo. Is that bad? Oh wait, you're

violently allergic to sesame.

Whoops. My bad.

CASS

You know what that is? "Karma". Oh,

and, I'll get the story. Watch me.

CASS

(into her phone)

911? Yeah, there's a guy here about

to go into anaphylactic shock.

Better hurry.

CASS

Yeah, "Charley's". (listening) On

the boardwalk? Great. Thanks.

91.

EMT

Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.

MILO

I don't believe it. She tried to

kill me.

EMT

No one tried to kill you, buddy.

You just need to be more careful

about what you eat.

MILO

Thanks. Great tip.

MILO

Know where this place is?

EMT

Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.

And just FYI: when they say "don't

touch" the dancers, they mean with

with any part of your body, not

just your hands.

MILO

(calling after them,

SARCASTIC)

Thanks for the ride, by the way.

92.

CASS

(SOFTLY)

Jimmy?

JIMMY

Untie me, quick, that psychopath is

gonna be back here any second...

93.

CASS

So what the hell is "Sparrow"?

DWIGHT (O.S.)

I have a better question...

DWIGHT

Where the fuck is Milo?

JIMMY

You know what? I think I'll get a

real job. Work at Kinko's. Or

Burger King. That doesn't sound so

bad anymore...

RAY

(INTERRUPTING)

Hey. Who the fuck are you?

JIMMY

Nobody.

RAY

Right. So what the fuck are you

doing in this car?

DWIGHT

(spelling it out)

Run, you jackass.

94.

MILO

(ANSWERING)

What do you want, you crazy bitch?

CASS

What kind of asshole runs up a

gambling debt with a bunch of

Neanderthals...

RAY

That's not what I told you to say.

RAY

As you can see: we have your

girlfriend.

CASS

(LOUDLY)

And I'm not his girlfriend.

MILO

Oh, she's my girlfriend alright.

But fair is fair: you guys can keep

her.

RAY

I think he hung up.

CASS

He what?

DWIGHT

(grabbing the phone)

Gimme that.

95.

MILO

Hello, Lucky's Libations!

DWIGHT

Look, Milo, I don't think you

understand: we're gonna hurt her.

MILO

Oh, I understand, alright, and I

don't blame ya. I want to hurt her

all the time.

CASS

Milo, listen, they're not kidding,

Ok?

MILO

Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.

CASS

For what?

MILO

For what? For poisoning me with

sesame and almost killing me!

96.

CASS

Ok. Maybe that was not the best...

MILO

Say you were wrong.

CASS

I could have found a more mature...

MILO

Say you were wrong.

CASS

I was possibly out of line...

MILO

Say you were wrong.

CASS

(blurting out)

Ok, ok, I was wrong!

MILO

Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason

you were able to crack that case

three years ago was because you

looked through my files.

CASS

What?

MILO

I think I'll hang up now...

CASS

(QUICKLY)

Ok, Ok. I looked through your

files. Are you happy?

MILO

Thrilled. Now tell them I'll be

there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile,

stop shifting in your seat like

that and just tell them you have to

use the bathroom.

MILO

Don't look around. Just do it.

97.

CASS

You boys mind if I use the ladies

room?

MILO

You know what my mistake was? I

never should have let you out of

the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.

The doctor said I may have been

technically dead for a few seconds,

but I'm fine now.

CASS

So that's what you really think?

That I stole information from you?

MILO

It's not what I think, it's what I

know. How else did you beat me?

CASS

(as though to a 5 yr old)

Did it ever occur to you that I

just might be good at my job?

CASS

That's what I thought. You know

what, Milo? You're an even bigger

asshole than I previously

suspected, and you deserve

everything that's happened to you.

(beat) And everything that's about

to happen to you.

MILO

You wouldn't...

CASS

(SCREAMING)

MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!

98.

DWIGHT

Wow. You always carry this much

gear?

MILO

Only during the holidays.

MAHLER

Remember me?

DWIGHT

What the fuck?

DANCER

Lapdance?

DANCER

Maybe I should come back later...

99.

CASS

Get off the car, Milo.

CASS

Get off the car, you psychopath.

MILO

Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know

why? Cause you made me that way.

And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking

you with me.

100.

CASS

AAHHH!!

MILO

AAHHH!!

MILO

LET GO...

CASS

NO, YOU LET GO...

101.

BYSTANDER

It was an old Cadillac, this crazy

girl driving, and the guy was like,

on the roof...

MILO

Yeah?

BOBBY

What the fuck are you doing? I

thought I told you to lie low.

MILO

I was lying low...

BOBBY

Yeah? Then how is it that a

statewide all-points was just put

out on the two of you?

MILO

(SIGHING)

It's a long story.

BOBBY

Ok, look, you guys better come to

me, I'll protect you til we figure

this out. Can you get to Pier 19?

102.

MILO

Yeah.

BOBBY

Get in.

CASS

So, these guys have a bunch of

stolen evidence stashed somewhere

in Atlantic City...

MILO

And we think they're ditching it

tonight.

BOBBY

(CASUALLY)

You know, if I was them, I'd store

the evidence on a boat, drive the

boat about 30 miles out, and blow

the whole thing up.

BOBBY

Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.

103.

MILO

Aw. That's what all the dirty cops

say.

BOBBY

You've always been such a stubborn

asshole, Milo. You just don't

listen. All you had to do was stay

where I told you and none of this

would have happen. Now the two of

you are gonna have to go down with

the boat.

BOBBY

Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.

(checking them out) You know what?

You guys make a great couple.

MILO

What's so funny?

CASS

My mom was worried I wouldn't have

plans for Xmas Eve.

104.

MILO

Hey, are you crying?

CASS

(SOBBING)

No. I'm not...

MILO

Ok, just don't...

CASS

I'm not crying.

MILO

I know you're not.

CASS

I just...(miserable) I can't

believe I going to die by being

blown up and sinking to the bottom

of the ocean with someone who

thinks I'm a total liar.

MILO

We're not gonna die.

CASS

Oh yeah? What's the plan?

MILO

(THINKING)

Well...

MILO

Ok. Here's what we do. We're going

to synchronize our efforts in order

to cross the room and manipulate

the bomb out of the room and into

the water in order to diffuse the

explosive impact.

CASS

You mean we're going to throw the

bomb out the window?

105.

MILO

Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to

get blown up.

CASS

(QUICKLY)

I'm with you. Go, team, go.

MILO

That's the spirit. Ok, first we're

going sideways: to the left...

MILO

Ok. My left this time...

MILO

Now we're gonna work our way over

to the bomb.

MILO

And I don't think you're a total

liar, but in my own defense, I was

one of the top detectives in my

division, I had been working that

case for months, and then you just

waltzed in and solved it.

CASS

I didn't just "waltz in". You know

I had been working it for months,

too. Isn't it possible that we're

both good at our jobs, and I just

happened to come out ahead?

MILO

(FUMBLING)

Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,

I was confused, I had never been in

love before!

CASS

Well, neither had I!

106.

CASS

Ow...

MILO

Shit..

CASS

Dammit...

CASS

Milo?

MILO

(MUFFLED)

I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the

right, and wait for the next wave.

MILO

My right.

MILO

So. You were in love with me?

CASS

Of course I was in love with you,

why do you think I married you?

CASS

Oh. My. God. You think I married

you so I could get info on the

case? Who am I, Mata Hari?

CASS

She's a spy, Milo.

107.

MILO

(QUICKLY)

I know that. Everybody knows that.

Mata Hari the spy.

MILO

Well. It might be a little late for

this. But...nice job on the

article.

CASS

You know, if I had something sharp

right now, I would stab you.

MILO

No, really, I mean, it was well-

written and...

CASS

Can you just get us out of here,

please?

CASS

Umph...

MILO

Ughh...

CASS

Son of a...

MILO

Ow...

CASS

Can you see the bomb?

MILO

Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now

we get up.

108.

CASS

Did you throw it?

MILO

Not exactly.

CASS

Well, what are you waiting for?

MILO

I'm waiting for a pig to fly in

here and grab it.

CASS

(starting to panic again)

Milo...

MILO

Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to

jump.

CASS

What?

MILO

You know: "jump, jump, jump around,

jump."

CASS

Are you serious?

MILO

No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.

Just for my own personal

enjoyment...

CASS

Ok, Ok.

MILO

Ok: 1, 2, 3...

109.

CASS

Think the water defused it?

MILO

Lemme ask you this? Has anything

gone our way yet?

CASS

Nice job.

MILO

Hey. You, too.

CASS

Thanks.

MILO

Now lets find something to cut

these ropes off...

CASS

Think we can catch that cop?

MILO

Trust me: we can definitely catch

that cop.

110.

MILO

Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...

MILO

What's the difference between a

snowman and a snowwoman? (holding

something up) The spark plug.

MILO

Merry Xmas. I got you this.

CASS

You shouldn't have.

MILO

Hey. I've still got three hours to

get you to jail. Looks like I'm

gonna win that bet after all.

111.

MILO

(to himself)

You have got to be kidding me.

CASS

(muffled, face in the

SAND)

I'm not going without a fight.

MILO

Yeah. I'm getting that.

MILO

9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging

Cass) Go on, say it.

CASS

(to the clerk)

I'd like to turn myself in. (can't

resist) Though I didn't do anything

wrong...

MILO

Stop talking.

CASS

...and I was unjustly arrested...

MILO

(to Cass)

See ya.

112.

CASS

(a little disoriented)

Oh. Ok.

GELMAN

Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty

hunter.

MILO

Ah, what the hell.

CASS

Oh my god, what happened?

MILO

Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas

alone. Besides, I didn't really

have any plans other than drinking

some cheap whiskey and putting my

fist through a wall.

CASS

I'm touched that you would give

that up for me.

MILO

Hey. It's the kind of guy I am.

SID (O.S.)

Well, you were right.

113.

LOIS

Of course I was right. I knew

they'd get back together if they

were just stuck together long

enough. And thank god. Better she

drives him crazy than me.

SID

I hear ya.

CASS

(LOW)

I love you.

MILO

I love you more.

CASS

Well, I doubt you love me more.

MILO

I'm just saying I love you a lot.

CASS

Right. I know. I love you a lot,

too. Let's just say you love me and

leave it at that.

MILO

Fine. I love you.

CASS

Fine. (beat) Cause I love you more.

MILO

Oh yeah? (glancing at her) Wanna

bet?
