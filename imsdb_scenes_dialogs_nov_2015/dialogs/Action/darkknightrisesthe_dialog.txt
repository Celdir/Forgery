THE DARK KNIGHT RISES

Written by

Jonathan Nolan & Christopher Nolan

Story by

Christopher Nolan & David S. Goyer

GORDON (V.O)

Harvey Dent was needed. He was

everything Gotham has been crying

out for. He was...a hero. Not the

hero we deserved - the hero we

needed. Nothing less than a knight,

shining...

GORDON

But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his

friend. And it will be a very long

time before someone inspires us the

way he did.

I believed in Harvey Dent.

CUT TO:

2.

CIA MAN

Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

DRIVER

He wasn't alone.

CIA MAN

You don't get to bring friends.

DR. PAVEL

(SHAKEN)

They are not my friends.

DRIVER

Don't worry, no charge for them.

CIA MAN

Why would I want them?

DRIVER

They were trying to grab your

prize. (Smiles.) They work for the

mercenary. The masked man.

CIA MAN

(EXCITED)

Bane?

CIA MAN

Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

CIA MAN

What are you doing in the middle of

my operation?

3.

The flight plan I just filed with

the Agency lists me, my men, and

Dr. Pavel here. But only one of

you.

CIA MAN

FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON

MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)

SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.

PAVEL?!

CIA MAN

HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

TRY NEXT?!

CIA MAN

TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

WEAR THE MASK?!

CIA MAN

LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)

Or he's wondering why someone would

shoot a man before throwing him out

of an aeroplane.

CIA MAN

Wiseguy, huh? At least you can

talk. Who are you?

THIRD PRISONER

We are nothing. We are the dirt

beneath your feet. And no one cared

who I was until I put on the

mask...

4.

BANE

Who we are does not matter. What

matters is our plan.

CIA MAN

(FASCINATED)

If I pull this off, will you die?

BANE

It would be extremely painful.

CIA MAN

You're a big guy -

BANE

For you.

CIA MAN

(UNNERVED)

Was being caught part of your plan?

BANE

Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our

offer in favor of yours. We had to

know what he told you about us.

DR. PAVEL

Nothing! I said nothing!

CIA MAN

Why not just ask him?

BANE

He would not have told us.

CIA MAN

You have methods.

BANE

Him, I need healthy. You present no

such problem.

5.

SERGEANT

Sir?

CIA MAN

Well congratulations, you got

yourselves caught. What's the next

step of your master plan?

BANE

Crashing this plane...

BANE

(RISING)

With no survivors.

6.

7.

BANE

Friend. They expect one of us in

the wreckage.

HOODED MAN 2

Have we started the fire?

BANE

(NODS)

The fire rises.

BANE

Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for

fear...

BANE

That comes later.

CUT TO:

MAYOR (V.O.)

Harvey Dent Day may not be our

oldest public holiday...

MAYOR (V.O.)

But we're here tonight because it's

one of the most important...

8.

MAYOR (V.O.)

Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand

against organized crime and, yes,

ultimately, his sacrifice, have

made Gotham a safer place than it

was at the time of his death, eight

years ago...

MAYOR

This city has seen a historic

turnaround. No city is without

crime. But this city is without

organized crime because the Dent

Act gave law enforcement teeth in

its fight against the mob. Now

people are talking about repealing

the Dent Act. And to them I

say...not on my watch.

I want to thank the Wayne

Foundation for hosting this event.

I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here

tonight, but I'm sure he's with us

in spirit...

MAYOR (O.S)

Now I'm going to give way to an

important voice...

CONGRESSMAN

Commissioner.

GORDON

Congressman.

CONGRESSMAN

Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of

these things?

9.

FOLEY

No one has. Not in years.

MAYOR (O.S)

He can tell you about the bad old

days, when the criminals and

corrupt ran this town with such a

tight grasp that people put their

faith in a murderous thug in a mask

and a cape. A thug who showed his

true nature when he betrayed the

trust of this great man - (Turns to

picture of Dent.) And murdered him

in cold blood.

CONGRESSMAN

Sweetheart, not so fast with the

chow.

MAID

(turns, tight smile)

Shrimp balls?

MAYOR (O.S)

Jim Gordon can tell you the truth

about Harvey Dent...

CONGRESSMAN

Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?

We're gonna be here all night.

GORDON

Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't

so simple, Congressman.

MAYOR (O.S)

But I'll let him tell you himself -

Commissioner Gordon?

GORDON

The truth...?

10.

I have written a speech telling the

truth about Harvey Dent...

Maybe the time isn't right...

CONGRESSMAN

Thank Christ for that...

GORDON

Maybe right now all you need to

know is that there are a thousand

inmates in Blackgate Prison as a

direct result of the Dent Act.

These are violent criminals,

essential cogs in the organized

crime machine that terrorized

Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,

all I should say about Harvey

Dent's death is this...it has not

been for nothing.

GORDON

The second shift reports in?

FOLEY

On your desk. But you should put in

some more time with the Mayor -

GORDON

That's your department.

CONGRESSMAN

Anyone shown him the crime stats?

FOLEY

He goes by his gut, and it

continues to bother him, whatever

the numbers.

CONGRESSMAN

Must be popular with the wife.

11.

FOLEY

Not really. She took the kids and

moved to Cleveland.

CONGRESSMAN

He'll have plenty of time for

visits. Mayor's dumping him in the

spring.

FOLEY

Really? He's a hero.

CONGRESSMAN

War hero. This is peacetime. Stay

smart, the job's yours.

MAID 2

They say he never leaves the East

Wing.

MAID 3

I heard he had an accident - that

he's disfigured.

ALFRED

Mr. Till, why are your people using

the main stairs?

ALFRED

Where's Mrs. Bolton?

MAID

She's up at the bar, sir. Can I

help?

ALFRED

The East drawing room. Unlock the

door, place the tray on the table,

lock the door again. Nothing more.

12.

ALFRED

I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've

tried. He won't see you.

MIRANDA

It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.

ALFRED

Mr. Wayne is as determined to

ignore important things as trivial

ones.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Don't take it personally, Miranda.

DAGGETT

Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in

there with eight-inch nails, peeing

into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good

of you to let me on the grounds.

ALFRED

The Dent Act is about all Gotham.

Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,

always a pleasure.

13.

DAGGETT

Why waste your time talking to the

man who threw away your investment

on some save-the-world vanity

project? He can't help you get your

money back. But I can.

MIRANDA

I could try explaining that a

save-the-world project, vain or

not, is worth investing in,

whatever the return. I could try,

Mr. Daggett, but you understand

only money and the power you think

it buys, so why waste my time,

indeed?

MAID

I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

MAID

Although you don't have the long

nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial

scars...

WAYNE

Is that what they say about me?

14.

MAID

It's just that...nobody sees you...

WAYNE

That's a beautiful necklace.

Reminds me of the one that belonged

to my mother. It can't be the same

one - her pearls are in this safe -

- which the manufacturer clearly

explained is uncrackable.

MAID

Oops. No one told me it was

uncrackable.

WAYNE

I'm afraid I can't let you take

those.

MAID

Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any

more than I would beat up a

cripple.

Of course, sometimes exceptions

have to be made.

Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.

15.

MAID

Can I have a ride?

CONGRESSMAN

You read my mind.

ALFRED

Miss Tate was asking to see you

again.

WAYNE

She's very persistent.

ALFRED

And quite lovely, in case you were

wondering.

WAYNE

I wasn't.

ALFRED

What are you doing?

WAYNE

Examining print dust. We've been

robbed.

ALFRED

And this is your idea of raising

the alarm?

WAYNE

(SHRUGS)

She took the pearls. Tracking

device and all.

ALFRED

She?

WAYNE

One of the maids, perhaps you

should stop letting them in this

side of the house.

16.

ALFRED

Perhaps you should learn to make

your own bed, then. Why are you

dusting for prints?

WAYNE

I'm not. She was.

YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)

Sir?

BLAKE

I didn't want to bother you up

here, but they're looking for you.

GORDON

What's the problem, son?

BLAKE

Congressman Gilly's wife's been

calling. He hasn't made it home

from the Wayne Foundation event.

GORDON

That's a job for the police?

BLAKE

Sir, I've been a cop for a year and

I've only logged half a dozen

arrests. When you and Dent cleaned

the streets you cleaned 'em good.

Pretty soon we'll be chasing

overdue library books.

BLAKE

But here you are. Like we're still

at war...

GORDON

Old habits.

17.

BLAKE

Or instinct.

GORDON

What's your name, son?

BLAKE

Blake, sir.

GORDON

You have something you want to ask

me, Officer Blake?

BLAKE

It's that night. This night, eight

years ago. The night Dent died.

GORDON

What about it?

BLAKE

The last confirmed sighting of the

Batman. He murders those people,

takes out two SWAT teams, breaks

Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

GORDON

I'm not hearing a question, son.

BLAKE

Don't you want to know who we was?

GORDON

I know exactly who he was. (Turns

to Blake.) He was Batman.

GORDON (O.S.)

Let's go see about the

Congressman's wife...

18.

ALFRED

Master Wayne?

ALFRED

You haven't been down here in a

long time...

WAYNE

Just trying to find out more about

our jewel thief. I ran her prints

from the photos she handled -

- but she was wearing someone

else's fingerprints. She's good.

ALFRED

She may be. But we have the trace

on the necklace.

WAYNE

We do, so I cross-referenced the

address she went back to with

police data on high-end

B-and-E's...

Selina Kyle. The databases are full

of close calls, tips from fences...

19.

WAYNE

She's good, but the ground is

shrinking beneath her feet.

ALFRED

We should send the police before

she fences the pearls.

WAYNE

She won't. She likes them too much.

And they weren't what she was

after.

ALFRED

What was she after?

WAYNE

My fingerprints. There was printer

toner mixed with graphite on the

safe. Gives you a good pull, and

it's untraceable.

ALFRED

Fascinating. Maybe you should

exchange notes over coffee.

WAYNE

Now you're trying to set me up with

a jewel thief?

ALFRED

At this point, sir, I would set you

up with a chimpanzee if I thought

it would bring you back into the

world.

WAYNE

There's nothing out there for me.

ALFRED

And that's the problem. You hung up

the cape and cowl, but never moved

on. You won't get out there and

find a life. Find someone -

WAYNE

(BITTER)

I did find someone, Alfred.

20.

ALFRED

I know. And then you lost them.

That's part of living, sir. But

you're not living - you're waiting.

Hoping for things to go bad again.

Remember when you left Gotham?

Before all this. Before Batman.

Seven years you were gone. Seven

years I waited. Hoping that you

wouldn't come back.

Every year I took my holiday. I'd

go to Florence. There's a cafe by

the Arno... Any fine evening I

would sit there and order a Fernet

Branca...

I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine

that one day I'd look across the

tables, and see you. Sitting there

with your wife. Perhaps some kids.

You wouldn't say anything to me, or

me to you, but we'd both

know...that you'd made it. That you

were happy.

I never wanted you to come back to

Gotham. I knew there was nothing

there for you but pain and tragedy,

and I wanted more for you than

that. I still do.

DWP MAN

They wash up a couple times a

month. More when in gets colder -

homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

We had to pull him to clear the

basin, but other than that we

didn't touch him...

21.

ROSS

What?

BLAKE

Name's Jimmy. He's at St.

Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys

home where I...I coach some ball.

FATHER REILLY

Jimmy hadn't been here for months.

BLAKE

Why?

FATHER REILLY

You know why, Blake - he aged out.

We don't have the resources to keep

boys on after sixteen -

BLAKE

The Wayne Foundation gives money

for that -

FATHER REILLY

Not for two years now.

BLAKE

He has a brother here, right?

FATHER REILLY

Mark. I'll tell him.

BLAKE

I'd like to, if that's okay.

22.

BLAKE

I'm sorry.

BLAKE

What was he doing in the tunnels?

MARK

Lot of guys been going down the

tunnels when they age out. Say you

can live down there. Say there's

work down there.

BLAKE

What kind of work are you gonna

find in the sewers?

MARK

More than you can find up here, I

guess.

STRYVER

You brought a date?

SELINA

I like having someone around to

open doors for me.

SELINA

Right hand. No partials.

23.

STRYVER

Very nice.

SELINA

Not so fast, handsome. You got

something for me?

STRYVER

Oh, yes.

SELINA

I don't know what you're going to

do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but

I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

SELINA

You don't count so good, huh?

STRYVER

I count fine.

STRYVER

In fact, I'm counting to ten right

now...

SELINA

Okay, okay -

SELINA

My friend is waiting outside. Just

hit 'send'...

24.

JEN

Place is a little dead.

SELINA

(takes envelope, tense)

It'll liven up in a minute, trust

me.

JEN

Everything okay?

SELINA

Great. Catch you later.

SELINA

It would've been a lot easier to

just give me what we agreed.

STRYVER

We can't have loose ends. And even

in that dress, no one's going to

miss you.

SELINA

No. But my friend over there...?

SELINA

Every cop in the city's missing

him.

STRYVER

Cute. But they're not gonna be

looking in a place like this.

SELINA

I don't know... You did just use

his cell phone.

25.

SWAT

It's alright, Miss. Just stay down

-

SELINA

Keep some pressure on that,

sweetheart.

CONGRESSMAN

(WEAK)

Call me?

SELINA

There's a man in there - he's

bleeding!

BLAKE

It's okay, Miss. It's okay.

26.

BLAKE

(INTO RADIO)

I've got the Congressman - bullet

to the leg, but he's okay.

GORDON

Manhole!

GORDON

You three, down with me. You two,

head down to cover the next exit -

SWAT

Where -?

GORDON

Get the DWP down here, now!

27.

COP

Where's the DWP guy?

BLAKE

They went down there?

FOLEY

(shaking his head)

And Gordon took SWAT in after them.

BLAKE

Come on, we gotta get down there -

COP

That was a gas explosion, kid -

BLAKE

Gas? This is a sewer!

FOLEY

No one goes in there till we know

what's down there.

28.

BLAKE

We know what's down there, sir. The

Police Commissioner!

FOLEY

Somebody get the hothead out of

here. And get me a DWP guy!

THUG 1

This one's alive. (Looks closer.)

Jesus. It's the Police

Commissioner.

THUG 2

What do we do?

THUG 1

Take him to Bane.

BANE

Why are you here?

THUG 1

Answer him!

29.

BANE

I'm asking you.

THUG 1

It's the Police Commissioner.

BANE

And you brought him down here?

THUG 2

We didn't know what to do. We -

BANE

You panicked. And your weakness

costs three lives.

THUG 1

No, he's alone -

BANE

Search him. Then I will kill you.

THUG 2

He's dead.

BANE

Then show me his body.

THUG 2

That water runs to any one of the

outflows - we'd never find him.

BANE

Give me your GPS.

30.

BANE

Follow him.

THUG 2

Follow him?

BANE

Track him. Make sure both bodies

will not be found. Then brick up

the south tunnel.

BLAKE

I need to see Bruce Wayne.

ALFRED

I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take

unscheduled calls. Even from police

officers.

BLAKE

And if I go get a warrant, in the

investigation of Harvey Dent's

murder? Would that still count as

unscheduled?

WAYNE

What can I do for you, officer?

BLAKE

Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

31.

WAYNE

I'm sorry to hear that -

BLAKE

He chased a gunman down into the

sewers. When I pulled him out he

was babbling about an underground

army. A masked man called 'Bane'.

WAYNE

Shouldn't you be telling this to

your superior officers?

BLAKE

I did. One of them asked if he saw

any giant alligators down there. He

needs you. He needs the Batman.

WAYNE

If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm

the Batman he must be in a bad way

-

BLAKE

He doesn't know or care who you

are. (Off look.) But we've met

before. When I was a kid. At the

orphanage. See, my mom died when I

was small. Car accident, I don't

really remember it. But a couple of

years later my dad was shot over a

gambling debt. I remember that just

fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot

of people who know what it feels

like, do they? To be angry. In your

bones. People understand, foster

parents understand. For a while.

Then they expect the angry kid to

do what he knows he can never do.

To move on. To forget.

BLAKE

So they stopped understanding and

sent the angry kid to a boys' home

- St. Swithin's. Used to be funded

by the Wayne Foundation. See, I

figured it out too late. You have

to hide the anger. Practice smiling

in the mirror. Like putting on a

mask. You showed up one day in a

cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

(MORE)

32.

BLAKE (CONT'D)

We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,

billionaire orphan. We made up

stories about you. Legends. The

other boys' stories were just that.

But when I saw you I knew who you

really were... (Beat.) I'd seen

that look on your face. Same one I

taught myself.

BLAKE

I don't know why you took the fall

for Dent's murder, but I'm still a

believer in the Batman. Even if

you're not.

WAYNE

Why did you say your boys' home

used to be funded by the Wayne

Foundation?

BLAKE

Because the money stopped. Might be

time to get some fresh air and

start paying attention to the

details. Some of those details

might need your help.

WAYNE

You checked that name? 'Bane' -

ALFRED

Ran it through some databases. He's

a mercenary. No other known name.

Never been seen or photographed

without a mask. He and his men were

behind a coup in West Africa that

secured mining operations for our

friend John Daggett.

WAYNE

Now Daggett's brought them here?

ALFRED

It would seem so. I'll keep

digging.

33.

WAYNE

Why did the Wayne Foundation stop

funding boys' homes in the city?

ALFRED

The Foundation is funded from the

profits of Wayne Enterprises...

(Off look.) There have to be some.

WAYNE

Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.

ALFRED

I'll get him on the phone -

WAYNE

No. Do we still have any cars

around the place?

ALFRED

(LIGHTS UP)

One or two.

WAYNE

And I need an appointment at the

hospital. About my leg.

ALFRED

Which hospital, sir?

WAYNE

Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

MIRANDA (V.O.)

Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr.

Wayne was trying to do...

34.

MIRANDA

I'm only asking for explanations

because I think I can help.

FOX

I'll pass along your request. Next

time I see him.

MIRANDA

He doesn't talk to you either?

FOX

Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has

his...eccentricities.

MIRANDA

(RISING)

Mr. Fox, are you aware that John

Daggett is trying to acquire shares

in Wayne Enterprises?

FOX

I was not. But it wouldn't do him

any good - Mr. Wayne still retains

a clear majority.

FOX

Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.

FOX

What brings you out of cryo-sleep

Mr. Wayne?

WAYNE

I see you haven't lost your sense

of humor...even if you have lost

most of my money.

FOX

Actually, you did that yourself.

See, if you funnel the entire R and

D budget for five years into a

fusion project that you then

mothball, your company is unlikely

to thrive.

35.

WAYNE

Even with -

FOX

A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.

Wayne Enterprises is running out of

time. And Daggett is moving in.

WAYNE

What're my options?

FOX

If you're not willing to turn your

machine on -

WAYNE

I can't, Lucius.

FOX

Then sit tight. Your majority keeps

Daggett at arm's length while we

figure out a future for the energy

program with Miranda Tate - she's

supported your project all the way.

She's smart, and quite lovely.

WAYNE

You too, Lucius?

FOX

We all just want what's best for

you, Bruce. Show her the machine.

WAYNE

I'll think it over.

FOX

Anything else?

WAYNE

No, why?

FOX

These conversations always used to

end with some...unusual requests.

WAYNE

I retired.

FOX

Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

36.

WAYNE

I figured you'd have shut this

place down.

FOX

It was always shut down,

officially.

WAYNE

But all this new stuff?

FOX

After your father died, Wayne

Enterprises set up fourteen

different defense subsidiaries.

I've spent years shuttering them

and consolidating all the

prototypes under one roof. My roof.

WAYNE

Why?

FOX

Stop them falling into the wrong

hands. Besides, I thought someone

might get some use out of them...

FOX

Sure I can't tempt you to

something? Pneumatic crampons?

Infrared lenses? Least let me get

you something for that leg.

WAYNE

It's fine the use it gets these

days.

FOX

Well, then I have just the thing

for an eccentric billionaire who

doesn't like to walk...

37.

WAYNE

Now you're just showing off.

FOX

Defense Department project for

tight-geometry urban pacification.

Rotors configured for maneuvering

between buildings without

recirculation.

WAYNE

What's it called?

FOX

It has a long and uninteresting

Wayne Enterprises designation. So I

took to calling it the Bat. And

yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in

black.

FOX

Works great except for the

autopilot.

WAYNE

What's wrong with that?

FOX

Software-based instability. Take a

better mind than mine to fix it.

WAYNE

Better mind?

FOX

I was trying to be modest. A less

busy mind. Yours, perhaps.

WAYNE

I told you. I retired, Lucius.

DOCTOR

I've seen worse cartilage in knees

-

38.

WAYNE

That's good -

DOCTOR

No, that's because there is no

cartilage in your knee. And not

much of any use in your elbows and

shoulders. Between that and the

scar tissue on your kidneys,

residual concussive damage to your

brain tissue and general

scarred-over quality of your

body... (Takes a deep breath.) I

cannot recommend that you go

heli-skiing. About the only part of

your body that looks healthy is

your liver, so if you're bored I

recommend you take up drinking, Mr.

Wayne.

GORDON

We were in this together. Then you

were gone...

WAYNE

The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

We won.

GORDON

Built on a lie. Our lie. Now

there's evil rising from where we

tried to bury it. Nobody will

listen... The Batman has to come

back.

39.

WAYNE

What if he doesn't exist anymore?

GORDON

He must. He must.

JEN (O.S.)

I told you - money first -

YUPPIE (O.S.)

Goddammit, you took my wallet!

SELINA

Get out.

YUPPIE

She took my wallet!

SELINA

Now.

SELINA

I told you not to try it with the

assholes, Jen.

JEN

They're all assholes.

40.

SELINA

Okay, the assholes who hit.

JEN

I don't know what he's so upset

about, he only had sixty bucks in

here.

SELINA

Probably the watch.

YOUNG WOMAN

Watch?

PAPARAZZI

Another stiff too old to climb out

of his sports car.

PAPARAZZI 2

No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,

where you been hiding?

WAYNE

I'm not sure if my assistant put me

on the guest list -

GREETER

Right through here, Mr. Wayne...

41.

MIRANDA (O.S)

Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

WAYNE

Miss Tate, isn't it?

MIRANDA

Even before you became a recluse,

you never came to these things...

WAYNE

True. Proceeds go to the big fat

spread, not the cause. It's not

about charity, it's about feeding

the ego of whichever society hag

laid it on.

MIRANDA

Actually, this is my party, Mr.

Wayne.

WAYNE

Oh.

MIRANDA

And the proceeds will go where they

should, because I paid for the big

fat spread myself.

WAYNE

That's very generous of you.

MIRANDA

You have to invest to restore

balance to the world. Take our

clean-energy project...

WAYNE

Sometimes the investment doesn't

pay off. Sorry.

42.

MIRANDA

You have a practiced apathy, Mr.

Wayne. But a man who doesn't care

about the world doesn't spend half

his fortune on a plan to save it...

(Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when

it fails that he goes into

hiding...

MIRANDA

Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

WAYNE

Mind if I cut in?

WAYNE

You don't seem very happy to see

me.

SELINA

You were supposed to be a shut-in.

WAYNE

Felt like some fresh air.

SELINA

Why didn't you call the police?

WAYNE

I have a powerful friend who deals

with this kind of thing. (Admires

her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a

cat burglar.

SELINA

Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

WAYNE

Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

Who's your date?

SELINA

His wife's in Ibiza. She left her

diamonds behind, though. Worried

they'd get stolen.

43.

WAYNE

SELINA

(flash of anger)

WAYNE

SELINA

WAYNE

SELINA

WAYNE

SELINA

WAYNE

SELINA

44.

WAYNE

Or our achievements.

SELINA

The mistakes stick better. Trust

me.

WAYNE

You think that justifies stealing?

SELINA

I take what I need to from those

who have more than enough. I don't

stand on the shoulders of people

with less.

WAYNE

Robin Hood?

SELINA

I'd do more to help someone than

most of the people in this room.

Than you.

WAYNE

Maybe you're assuming too much.

SELINA

Or maybe you're being unrealistic

about what's really in your pants

other than your wallet.

WAYNE

Ouch.

SELINA

You think all this can last?

SELINA

There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

You and your friends better batten

down the hatches, because when it

hits you're all gonna wonder how

you ever thought you could live so

large and leave so little to the

rest of us.

WAYNE

Sounds like you're looking forward

to it.

45.

SELINA

I'm adaptable.

WAYNE

These pearls do look better on you

then they did in my safe...

But I still can't let you keep

them.

RICH TWIT

(ANNOYED)

You scared her off.

WAYNE

Not likely.

WAYNE

I must have lost my ticket -

VALET

Your wife said you were taking a

cab home, sir.

WAYNE

My wife?

ALFRED

Just you, sir?

(MORE)

46.

ALFRED (CONT'D)

Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a

little time to get back into the

swing of things.

FOX (O.S.)

This is Fox.

WAYNE

Remember those 'unusual requests' I

used to make?

FOX (O.S.)

I knew it!

ALFRED

You've got the wrong leg, sir.

WAYNE

You start with the good limb so it

learns your optimum muscle

patterns.

Now we tighten it up.

ALFRED

It is terribly painful?

WAYNE

(GRITTED TEETH)

You're welcome to try it, Alfred.

ALFRED

Happy watching, thank you, sir.

47.

WAYNE

Not bad -

Not bad at all.

ALFRED

Master Wayne, if you're considering

going back out there you need to

hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

WAYNE

I'm all ears.

ALFRED

There is a prison. In a more

ancient part of the world. A pit.

Where men are thrown to suffer and

die. But sometimes, a man rises

from the darkness. Sometimes...the

pit sends something back.

WAYNE

Bane.

ALFRED

Born and raised in a hell on earth.

WAYNE

Born in a prison?

ALFRED

No one knows why. Or how he

escaped. But they know who trained

him one he did...R 's al Gh l. Your

A U

mentor.

ALFRED

He plucked Bane from a dark corner

of the earth and trained him in the

blackest disciplines of combat,

deception and endurance. Just like

you.

WAYNE

Bane was a member of the League of

Shadows.

48.

ALFRED

Until he was excommunicated. And a

man considered too extreme for R 's

A

al Gh l is not to be trifled with.

U

WAYNE

I didn't realize I was known for

trifling with criminals.

ALFRED

That was then. And you can strap up

your leg and put the mask back on.

But it won't make you what you

were.

WAYNE

Which was?

ALFRED

Someone whose anger at death made

him value all life. Even his own.

WAYNE

If this man is all the things you

say he is, then this city needs me.

ALFRED

Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.

Your resources, your

knowledge...not your body. Not your

life. That time has passed.

WAYNE

I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,

Alfred. And I failed.

ALFRED

You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As

Batman, you can't afford to.

WAYNE

That's what you're afraid of - that

if I go back out there I'll fail.

ALFRED

No. I'm afraid that you want to.

49.

TRADER 2

You can't short the stock because

Bruce Wayne goes to a party -

TRADER 1

Wayne coming back is change. Change

is either good or bad.

TRADER 2

On what basis?

TRADER 1

I flipped a coin.

TRADER 3

No. Rye. I told 'em rye.

Alright, I'll take it.

FEMALE SECURITY GUARD

Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at

a camera.) We need faces for

cameras.

50.

TRADER 1

This is a stock exchange, there's

no money you can steal -

BANE

Why else would you people be here?

BANE

Enter your password. Or I send

these men to your home.

BLAKE

Move it, now! We've got a

situation.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER

Where can I move it?!

BLAKE

That way!

51.

BLAKE

Get in your vehicle and stay there!

SECURITY CHIEF

You've gotta get in there!

FOLEY

This is a hostage situation -

SECURITY CHIEF

It's a robbery! They've got direct

access to the online trading desk.

FOLEY

I'm not risking my men for your

MONEY -

SECURITY CHIEF

It's not our money, it's

everyone's!

ALLEN

Really? Mine's in my mattress.

SECURITY CHIEF

If you don't shut these guys down,

the stuffing in that mattress might

be worth a whole lot less, pal.

FOLEY

Cut the fiber line - shut down the

cell tower. That'll slow them down.

SHOESHINE MAN

They cut the fiber. Cell's working.

BANE

For now. How much longer does the

program need?

SHOESHINE MAN

Eight minutes.

52.

BANE

Time to go mobile.

ALLEN

Get the barriers up - no more in

and out on this street!

SNIPER

I've got something -

ROOKIE COP

Shoot the tires!

VETERAN COP

No shot!

FOLEY

Back off, back off! They've got

hostages!

53.

ROOKIE COP

What's going on with the lights?

VETERAN COP

It can't be...

ROOKIE COP

The hell was that?!

VETERAN COP

Oh boy. You're in for a show

tonight, son.

FOLEY

Let's roll, they've spotted the

Batman!

54.

FOLEY

(INTO RADIO)

Call everyone in - every car

patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too!

Pull 'em in, close every street!

Now!

FOLEY

I'm gonna do what Gordon never

could.

BLAKE

What's that?

FOLEY

I'm gonna take down the Batman.

BLAKE

Sir, what about the armed robbers?

55.

SPOTTER

(INTO RADIO)

One bike's pulled off, no hostage -

SPOTTER

(OVER RADIO)

Should we pursue?

FOLEY

Negative! Stay on the Batman!

BLAKE

But he's getting away!

FOLEY

(ANNOYED)

Who do you want to catch? Some

robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who

killed Harvey Dent?

TV ANNOUNCER

People aren't saying much -

frankly, they're too busy - but all

signs suggest that what we're

(MORE)

56.

TV ANNOUNCER (cont'd)

seeing is, in fact, the return of

the Batman...

CATWOMAN

Well, what do you know?

BATMAN

WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?!

APPLICATION COMPLETE

57.

POLICE VOICE

(OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!

DAGGETT

After eight years he has to pick

tonight...

STRYVER

He's drawing the cops off Bane...

FOLEY

How did you let him go?!

COP

(OVER RADIO)

He's got a lot of firepower -

FOLEY

And you don't?! We're not letting

one nut with a bad attitude and

some fancy gadgets run this town

down, you hear me?!

COP

(OVER RADIO)

He's heading back downtown...

FOLEY

(EXCITED)

Then he's as dumb as he dresses -

close it down, gentlemen!

58.

FOLEY

Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen...

VETERAN COP

You might have the wrong animal

there, sir -

BLAKE

Are you sure that was him?

ANNOUNCER

(ON TV)

Police are keeping quiet about the

prospect of a return by the Batman,

but eyewitness accounts seem the

clearly suggests the type of...

59.

STRYVER

Bane says the Batman interfered,

but the task was accomplished.

DAGGETT

What about the men they arrested?

STRYVER

He says, and I quote, they would

die before talking.

DAGGETT

(GRINS)

Where does he find these guys?

Open the champagne...

DAGGETT

And can we get some girls in here?

CATWOMAN (O.S.)

Careful what you wish for.

CATWOMAN

Cat got your tongue?

DAGGETT

You dumb bitch.

CATWOMAN

Nobody ever accused me of being

dumb.

60.

DAGGETT

Dumb to show up here tonight.

CATWOMAN

I want what you owe me -

DAGGETT

'I want' never gets...

STRYVER

Nice outfit...those heels make it

tough to walk?

CATWOMAN

I don't know, do they?

CATWOMAN

So where is it?

DAGGETT

Where's what?

CATWOMAN

The program. The 'Clean Slate'.

DAGGETT

Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a

master thief with a record. I don't

have it.

61.

CATWOMAN

Where is it?

DAGGETT

The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name

and date of birth and within a

couple hours that person ceases to

exist in any database? Little too

good to be true.

CATWOMAN

You're lying. Rykin Data took it to

prototype stage -

DAGGETT

That's why I bought them. But they

had nothing. It was a gangland

myth.

CATWOMAN

Stay back!

CATWOMAN

I'm not bluffing!

VOICE (O.S.)

They know...

BATMAN

They just don't care.

62.

CATWOMAN

You've got to be kidding.

BATMAN

No guns. No killing.

CATWOMAN

Where's the fun in that?

BATMAN

Come on!

CATWOMAN

My mother warned me about getting

into cars with strange men -

BATMAN

This isn't a car.

CATWOMAN

See you around -

BATMAN

You're welcome.

CATWOMAN

I had it under control.

63.

BATMAN

Those weren't street thugs - they

were trained killers. I saved your

life. In return I need to know what

you did with Bruce Wayne's

fingerprints.

CATWOMAN

Wayne wasn't kidding about a

'powerful friend'. I sold his

prints to Daggett. For something

that doesn't even exist.

BATMAN

I doubt many people get the better

of you.

CATWOMAN

Hey, when a girl's desperate...

BATMAN

What were they going to do with

them?

CATWOMAN

I don't know. But Daggett seemed

pretty interested in that mess at

the stock market.

BATMAN

Miss Kyle -?

So that's what that feels like.

ALFRED

Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell

the neighbors you got yourself a

new leaf-blower?

64.

WAYNE

We bought all the neighbors.

ALFRED

From the look of the television

coverage, you seem to have your

taste for wanton destruction back.

WAYNE

(pulls out USB drive)

I retrieved this.

ALFRED

Shouldn't the police be gathering

the evidence?

WAYNE

They don't have the tools to

analyze it.

ALFRED

They would if you gave them to them

-

WAYNE

One man's tool is another man's

weapon.

ALFRED

In your mind, perhaps. But there

aren't many things you couldn't

turn into a weapon.

WAYNE

Alfred. Enough. The police weren't

getting it done -

ALFRED

Perhaps they would've if you

haven't made a sideshow of

yourself.

WAYNE

Perhaps you're upset you were

wrong.

ALFRED

Wrong?

65.

WAYNE

You thought I didn't have it in me.

ALFRED

You don't. You lead a bloated

police force on a merry chase with

some fancy new toys from Fox. What

about when you come up against him.

What then?

WAYNE

I'll fight harder, I always have.

ALFRED

When you had something to fight

for. What are you fighting for now?

Not your life.

ALFRED

Take a good look. At his speed, his

ferocity, His training. I see the

power of belief. Of the fanatic. I

see the League of Shadows

resurgent.

WAYNE

You said he was excommunicated.

ALFRED

By R 's al Gh l. Who leads them

A U

now?

WAYNE

R 's al Gh l was the League of

A U

Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's

just a mercenary, and we have to

find out what he's up to.

WAYNE

Trades of some kind. Coded...

66.

ALFRED

Is that -?

WAYNE

Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.

Get this to Fox - he can crack the

code and tell us what trades they

were executing.

ALFRED

I'll get this to Fox. But no more.

ALFRED

I've sewn you up and set your

bones...but I won't bury you. I've

buried enough members of the Wayne

family.

WAYNE

You'd abandon me?

ALFRED

You see only one end to your story.

Leaving is all I have to make you

understand: you aren't Batman

anymore - you have to find another

way. You used to talk about

finishing. About life beyond that

awful cave -

WAYNE

Rachel died knowing we'd decided to

be together. That was my life

beyond this cave and I can't just

move on. She didn't. She couldn't.

ALFRED

What if he had? What if she wasn't

intending to make a life with you?

67.

WAYNE

She was, I can't change that -

ALFRED

What if, before she died, she'd

written a letter? Explaining that

she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?

ALFRED

And what if, to spare you

pain...I'd burned that letter?

WAYNE

Why would you say such a thing?

ALFRED

Because I have to make you

understand.

WAYNE

You're lying.

ALFRED

Because you are as precious to me

as you were to your own mother and

father and I swore to them that I

would protect you and I haven't.

WAYNE

You're lying!

ALFRED

I've never lied to you. Except when

I burned Rachel's letter.

WAYNE

How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

ALFRED

I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.

Maybe it's time we all stopped

trying to outsmart the truth and

just let it have its day. I'm

sorry.

68.

WAYNE

Sorry?! You expect to destroy my

world, then shake hands?!

ALFRED

No. I know what this means -

WAYNE

What does it mean, Alfred?!

ALFRED

It means your hatred. It means

losing the person I've cared for

ever since I heard his first cries

echo through this house. But it

might also mean saving your life.

And that is more important.

WAYNE

Goodbye, Alfred.

ALFRED

(QUIET)

Goodbye, Bruce.

WAYNE

Alfred?

69.

FOX

Answering your own door?

WAYNE

Yes. Could you decode the trades on

that drive?

FOX

I didn't need to. Page three.

FOX

It seems you made a series of large

put options on the futures

exchange. Verified by thumb print.

The options expired at midnight

last night.

FOX

Long term we may be able to prove

fraud, but for now...you're

completely broke. And Wayne

Enterprises is about to fall into

the hands of John Daggett.

WAYNE

The weapons - we can't let Daggett

get his hands on Applied Sciences -

FOX

Applied Sciences is shut up tight,

and off the books. The energy

project is a different story.

WAYNE

Miranda Tate. We need to convince

the board to get behind her. Let's

show her the reactor -

FOX

We're meeting her there in

thirty-five minutes. You better get

dressed.

70.

MIRANDA

You brought me out here to show me

a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?

FOX

Bear with me, Miss Tate.

FOX

Keep your hands and feet inside the

car at all times.

MIRANDA

This is it, isn't it?

FOX

The reactor is beneath the river so

that it could be instantly flooded

in an event of a security breach.

MIRANDA

Is Bruce Wayne really that

paranoid?

FOX

I'm gonna plead the fifth on that

one.

WAYNE

I thought you might like to see

what your investment built.

71.

MIRANDA

No radiation, no fossil fuels.

Free, clean energy for an entire

city.

WAYNE

If it worked. It doesn't.

WAYNE

Ignition, yes. But no chain

reaction.

MIRANDA

You've built a lot of security

around a damp squib.

About three years ago a Russian

scientist published a paper on

weaponized fusion reactions. One

week later your reactor started

developing problems... (Looks at

Wayne.) I think this machine works.

WAYNE

Miranda, if it were operational,

the danger to Gotham would be too

great.

MIRANDA

Would it make you feel better to

know that the Russian scientist

died in a plane crash six months

ago?

WAYNE

Someone else will work out what Dr.

Pavel did. Someone else will figure

out how to turn this power source

into a nuclear weapon. I need you

to take control of Wayne

Enterprises and this reactor.

MIRANDA

And to do what with it?

WAYNE

Nothing. Until we can find a way to

guarantee its safety.

72.

MIRANDA

And if we can't?

WAYNE

Decommission it. Flood it.

MIRANDA

Destroy the world's best chance for

a sustainable future?

WAYNE

If the world's not ready. Yes.

MIRANDA

Bruce, if you want to save the

world you have to start trusting

it.

WAYNE

I'm trusting you.

MIRANDA

Doesn't count. You have no choice.

WAYNE

I could've flooded this chamber any

time in the last three years. I'm

choosing to trust you, Miranda, and

that's not the easiest thing for

me. Please.

FOX

We have a board meeting to get to.

DAGGETT

I'd like to point out that we have

a non-board member here. Highly

irregular, even if it is his family

name above the door...

FREDERICKS

Bruce Wayne's family built this

COMPANY -

73.

BOARD MEMBER 2

And he himself has run it -

DAGGETT

Into the ground, sir. Anybody

disagree? Check the value of your

shares this morning. Gambling on

crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.

Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a

lot of money. He needs to leave.

FOX

I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.

Wayne.

WAYNE

I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.

DAGGETT

Let's get down to business.

FOX

Right away.

REPORTER

Wayne, how's it feel to be one of

the people?!

COMPANY VALET

I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork

-

BLAKE (O.S.)

Looks like you need a lift.

74.

DAGGETT

How the hell did Miranda Tate get

the inside track on the Wayne

board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?

Was she sleeping with Wayne?

STRYVER

Not that we know of -

DAGGETT

Clearly you don't 'know of'

anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!

STRYVER

We told him it was urgent -

DAGGETT

Then where is the masked -

BANE (O.S.)

Speak of the devil...

BANE

...and he shall appear.

DAGGETT

What the hell's going on?

BANE

The plan is proceeding as expected.

DAGGETT

You see me running Wayne

Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)

Your stock exchange hit didn't

work, friend. And now you've got my

construction crews working all

hours around the city? How's that

supposed to help my company absorb

Wayne's?

BANE

(TO STRYVER)

Leave us.

75.

DAGGETT

You stay right there! I'm in

charge!

BANE

Do you feel in charge?

DAGGETT

I've paid you a small fortune -

BANE

And that gives you power over me?

DAGGETT

What is this?

BANE

Your money and infrastructure have

been important. Till now.

DAGGETT

What are you?

BANE

Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the

borrowed time you've all been

living on...

DAGGETT

You are true evil...

BANE

I am necessary evil.

SCENE OMITTED

76.

BLAKE

When you began...why the mask?

WAYNE

To protect the people closest to

me.

BLAKE

You're a loner with no family.

WAYNE

There are always people you care

about. You just don't realize how

much until they're gone. (Collects

himself.) The idea was to be a

symbol. Batman could be anybody,

that was the point.

BLAKE

It was damn good to see him back.

WAYNE

Not everybody agrees.

BLAKE

They'll figure it out in the end.

WAYNE

Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

BLAKE

Yeah, I've got five hundred pages

of tunnel records and a flashlight.

I could use some help.

WAYNE

(THINKS)

You know what? Drop me in Old

Town...

WAYNE

Don't wait. I'll get a cab.

77.

BLAKE

You got money?

WAYNE

(smiles, sheepish)

Actually, no.

JEN (O.S.)

I told you, money first.

WAYNE (O.S.)

I don't think so.

SELINA

He's not a mark.

SELINA

And he doesn't have a cent to his

name, anyway.

SELINA

Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But

it's more that you've got right

now.

WAYNE

Actually, they're letting me keep

the house.

SELINA

(SHAKES HEAD)

The rich don't even go broke same

as the rest of us, huh?

78.

WAYNE

(spots her bag)

Vacation?

SELINA

Let's just say that I've incurred

the wrath of some people less

susceptible to my charms than you.

WAYNE

My powerful friend hopes to change

your mind about leaving.

SELINA

And how would he do that?

WAYNE

By giving you what you want.

SELINA

It doesn't exist.

WAYNE

He says it does. He wants to meet.

Tonight.

SELINA

Why?

WAYNE

He needs to find Bane. He thinks

you'd know how.

SELINA

Tell him I'll think about it.

SELINA

Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all

your money.

WAYNE

No, you're not.

79.

FOLEY

Can we help you, officer?

BLAKE

John Daggett's body was found in a

dumpster an hour ago. I thought you

might like to know.

GORDON

Why?

BLAKE

Because Daggett's name is all over

the permits I pulled to map the

tunnels under Gotham.

BLAKE

MTA maintenance, sewer

construction...

GORDON

(TO FOLEY)

Where did you get to with the

tunnel searches?

FOLEY

(TO BLAKE)

Remind me to tell the detail to

keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)

We've had teams down there, but

it's a huge network -

GORDON

Get more men, work a grid. I want

him found.

FOLEY

Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're

on it.

GORDON

This is good work. Lose the uniform

- you're working for me now. We

could use some hotter heads around

here.

80.

BLAKE

This could just be a coincidence.

GORDON

You're a detective now, son, you're

not allowed to believe in

coincidence anymore.

MIRANDA (O.S)

Nobody's answering.

WAYNE

No. I'm on my own now.

MIRANDA

Do you have keys?

WAYNE

Never needed them...

MIRANDA

Let's find a window.

MIRANDA

Fox worked the board like you've

never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out

and he's not happy.

81.

WAYNE

Hope you don't like me for your

money.

MIRANDA

Suffering builds character.

MIRANDA

I'll take care of your parents'

legacy, Bruce.

MIRANDA

Who's this?

MIRANDA

Where's Alfred?

WAYNE

He left. Taking everything.

MIRANDA

What's that?

WAYNE

(SHEEPISH)

I think my power's been shut off.

WAYNE

You're pretty good at that.

MIRANDA

When I was a child we had almost

nothing. But on the nights we had a

fire, we felt very rich indeed.

82.

WAYNE

I assumed your family was wealthy.

MIRANDA

Not always. Not when I was young.

MIRANDA

An old mistake.

WAYNE

I've made a few myself.

MIRANDA

More than a few... (Smiles.) We

could leave. Tonight. Take my

plane. Go anywhere we wanted.

WAYNE

Someday perhaps. Not tonight.

CATWOMAN

Don't be shy.

83.

CATWOMAN

Wayne says you can get me the

'Clean Slate'.

BATMAN

That depends.

CATWOMAN

On what?

BATMAN

On what you want it for. I acquired

it to keep it out of the wrong

hands.

CATWOMAN

Still don't trust me, huh? How can

we change that?

BATMAN

Start by taking me to Bane.

CATWOMAN

(SHRUGS)

You asked.

CATWOMAN

From here, Bane's men patrol the

tunnels...and they are not your

average brawlers.

BATMAN

Neither am I.

CATWOMAN

He's behind you.

84.

MERCENARY

(SPINS)

Who?

BATMAN (O.S.)

Me.

CATWOMAN

Just a little further.

CATWOMAN

I had to find a way to stop them

trying to kill me.

BATMAN

You've made a serious mistake.

BANE (O.S.)

Not as serious as yours, I fear.

BATMAN

Bane.

BANE

Let's not stand on ceremony here,

Mr. Wayne.

BANE

Peace has cost you strength.

Victory has defeated you.

85.

BANE

Theatricality and deception are

powerful agents...to the

uninitiated.

BANE

But we are initiated, aren't we,

Bruce? The League of Shadows. And

you betrayed us...

BATMAN

Us? You were excommunicated. From a

gang of psychopaths.

BANE

Now I am the League of Shadows,

here to fulfill R 's al Gh l's

A U

destiny...

BANE

You fight like a younger man.

Nothing held back. No reserves.

Admirable. But mistaken.

BANE

You think darkness is your ally.

But you merely adopted the dark. I

was born in it. Formed by it...

BANE

I didn't see the light until I was

already a man. And by then it was

nothing to me but blinding...

86.

BANE

The shadows betray you, because

they belong to me...

BANE

I will show you where I've made my

home while preparing to bring

justice. Then...I will break you.

BATMAN

No...

BANE

Your precious armory. Gratefully

accepted. We will need it.

BANE

I wondered which would break first

- your spirit...

...or your body.

87.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

BLAKE

(INTO RADIO)

Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him

I've got a line on the

Congressman's kidnapping.

UNIFORM

Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your

ticket and identification, please.

SELINA

Would you mind?

88.

BLAKE

I showed your picture to the

Congressman and guess what?

SELINA

Don't tell me, still in love?

BLAKE

Head over heels. Pressing charges,

though.

You've made some mistakes, Ms.

Kyle.

SELINA

Girl's gonna eat.

BLAKE

You have an appetite. Why run? You

can't hide from us with this

record.

SELINA

Maybe it's not you I'm running

from.

BLAKE

Who then? Bane? What do you know

about him?

SELINA

(QUIET)

That you should be as afraid of him

as I am.

89.

BLAKE

We can offer you protection...

BLAKE

When I spotted you, I was looking

for a friend...Bruce Wayne.

BLAKE

Did they kill him?

SELINA

I'm not sure.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

Why didn't you just kill me?

BANE

You don't fear death. You welcome

it. Your punishment is to be more

severe.

WAYNE

(SCATHING)

You're a torturer...

BANE

Yes. But not of your body. Of your

soul.

90.

WAYNE

Where am I?

BANE

Home.

Where I learned the truth about

despair. As will you. (Rises.)

There is a reason that this prison

is the worst hell on earth...

Hope. Every man who has rotted here

over the centuries has looked up to

the light and imagined climbing to

freedom. So simple. So easy. And,

like shipwrecked men turning to sea

water from uncontrollable thirst,

many have died trying. I learned

that there can be no true despair

without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So

as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed

its people hope to poison their

souls. I will let them believe they

can survive so that you can watch

them clamber over each other to

stay in the sun...

You will watch as I torture an

entire city to cause you pain you

thought you could never feel again.

Then, when you have truly

understood the depths of your

failure, we will fulfill R 's al

A

Gh l's destiny. We will destroy

U

Gotham. And when it is done...when

Gotham is ashes...then you have my

permission to die.

91.

GUARD

We're locking her up in here?

WARDEN

The Dent Act allows non-segregation

based on extraordinary need. First

time she broke out of women's

correctional she was sixteen.

HUGE INMATE

Little closer, baby...

SELINA

Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

WARDEN

She'll be just fine.

FOX

I don't see the need for a board

meeting on the energy project -

MIRANDA

Bruce got a lot of things right.

Keeping the board in the dark

wasn't one of them...

BANE

This meeting is called to order.

92.

BANE

Chair and President. I also need

one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,

would you care to nominate?

FREDERICKS

No. I volunteer.

FOX

Where are you taking us?

BANE

Where you buried your resources.

The bowels of Gotham.

GORDON

So you think our friend is gone

again?

BLAKE

(GRAVE)

This time...he might not be coming

back.

FOLEY

Okay, Commissioner, you were right.

GORDON

What's happened?

FOLEY

Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne

Enterprises board. He let most of

them go, but took three down into

the sewers.

GORDON

No more patrols, no more hide and

seek. Send every available cop

down there to smoke him out.

93.

FOLEY

The Mayor won't want panic -

BLAKE

So it's a training exercise.

FOLEY

I'm sorry for not taking you

SERIOUSLY -

GORDON

Don't apologize for believing the

world's in better shape then it

is...just fight to make it true.

GORDON

Not you. You're telling me the

Batman's gone. So you chase up the

Daggett leads, any way you can.

PRISONER

He asks if you would pay us to let

you die. I told him you have

nothing.

WAYNE

Do it for the pleasure.

PRISONER

They pay me more than that to keep

you alive.

94.

PRISONER

He will try the climb.

WAYNE

Has anyone made it?

PRISONER

Of course not.

WAYNE

What does he say?

PRISONER

He says there is one who did. A

child...

PRISONER

A child who had been born in this

hell...

WAYNE

Bane.

PRISONER

An old legend. Nothing more.

WAYNE

Don't.

PRISONER

Whatever they want you to

see...it's happening soon.

95.

BANE

Turn it on.

BANE

I only need one other board member.

There are eight more waiting

upstairs.

FOX

I won't do it.

MIRANDA

Alright, stop.

96.

MIRANDA

Lucius, you'll kill this man and

yourself, and barely slow them

down.

BANE

Do your work.

Take them to the surface. People of

their status deserve to see the

next era of western civilization.

REPORTER

We're seeing literally thousands of

police heading into the sewers -

MAYOR

A training exercise, that's all. If

you'll excuse me, I've got tickets

to watch our boys thrash Rapid

City.

BLAKE

I've been to half Daggett's cement

plants, logged locations they've

poured for underground

construction...

97.

GORDON (O.S.)

Anything strange about the

pourings?

BLAKE

Honestly, Commissioner, I don't

know anything about civil

engineering.

GORDON

But you know about patterns. Keep

looking.

DR. PAVEL

It's done. This is now a

four-megaton nuclear bomb.

BANE

(to his men)

Pull the core out of the reactor.

DR. PAVEL

(HORRIFIED)

You can't. This is the only power

source capable of sustaning it - if

you move it, the core will decay in

a matter of months.

BANE

Five, by my calculations.

DR. PAVEL

And then it will go off.

BANE

For the sake of your family, Dr.

Pavel, I hope so.

98.

WORKER

Boss is about to leave.

BLAKE

Hey.

BLAKE

That was you outside the stock

exchange, right?

DRIVER

When?

BLAKE

When? When half the city's cops

were trying to pull onto Castle

Street and your truck shut them

out.

DRIVER

Oh yeah. You're that cop -

BLAKE

Detective, now.

BLAKE

And as a detective...I'm not

allowed to believe in coincidences

ANYMORE -

BLAKE

What were you doing?! What?!

99.

BLAKE

Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth

Street plant with two dead

witnesses and a lot of questions.

Call me -

Commissioner, they've got

Polyisobutylene here... (Looks

around.) And motor oil. They

weren't making cement, they were

making explosives -

BLAKE

Oh, God.

BLAKE

Patch me into Foley!

DISPATCH

(OVER RADIO)

Foley's overseeing the operation -

BLAKE

They're heading into a trap!

FOLEY

Foley.

BLAKE

It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

Bane's been pouring concrete laced

with explosives -

100.

FOLEY

Where?

BLAKE

There's a ring around the tunnels -

they're gonna blow it and trap the

cops underground!

FOLEY

Pull out! Pull 'em out!

BANE

Let the games begin.

101.

BANE

Gotham, take control of your

city...

BLAKE

Foley?

FOLEY

(OVER RADIO)

Jesus, Blake! Every cop in the

city's down in those tunnels!

BLAKE

(REALIZES)

Not every cop...

102.

GORDON (O.S.)

Clear the corners, rookie.

GORDON

Get my coat, son.

103.

BANE

This is the instrument of your

liberation...

ANALYST

Satellite shows a radiation

spike...

ANALYST 2

Whatever it is...it's nuclear.

BANE

Identify yourself to the world.

DR. PAVEL

Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear

physicist.

CIA ANALYST

Pavel was confirmed dead - plane

crash on an Agency pull-out of

Uzbekistan... But it certainly

looks like him -

104.

BANE

Tell the world what this is.

DR. PAVEL

A fully primed neutron bomb. With a

blast radius of six miles.

BANE

And who can disarm this device?

DR. PAVEL

Only me.

BANE

Thank you, Doctor.

BANE

The bomb is armed, the bomb is

mobile, the identity of the

triggerman is a mystery. One of you

holds the detonator - we come not

as conquerors, but as liberators to

return control of this city to the

people. At the first sign of

interference from the outside world

or of people attempting to flee,

this anonymous Gothamite, this

unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

For now, martial law is in effect.

Return to your homes, hold your

families close, and wait. Tomorrow

you claim what is rightfully yours.

105.

GENERAL

Pull back the fighters, start

high-level reconnaissance flights.

And get the President on the line.

LEAD MERCENARY

Tanks and planes cannot stop us

detonating our device. Send an

emissary to discuss terms of access

for supplies and communication.

CAPTAIN

How many of you are there, son?

(Nothing.) You don't have enough

men to stop twelve million people

leaving that island.

LEAD MERCENARY

We don't. But you do.

CAPTAIN

Why in the hell would we help you

keep your hostages?

LEAD MERCENARY

If people start crossing this

bridge Gotham gets blown to hell.

PRESIDENT

(OVER RADIO)

The people of our greatest city are

resilient. They have proven this

before, they will prove this

again...

106.

PRESIDENT

(OVER TV)

We do not negotiate with

terrorists, but we do recognize

realities...

PRESIDENT

(OVER RADIO)

As the situation develops, one

thing must be understood above all

others... People of Gotham, we have

not abandoned you.

BLAKE

What does that mean?

GORDON

It means we're on our own. I have

to get in front of a camera -

BLAKE

Sir, they'll kill you the second

you show your face -

GORDON

The Mayor's dead. I'm the symbol of

law and order. Bane says he's

giving Gotham back to the people -

they need to know that I could

lead.

BLAKE

Bane's not gonna let that happen -

GORDON

Then he'll show his true colors.

BLAKE

And you'll be dead.

107.

BANE

Behind you stands a symbol of

oppression. Blackgate Prison...

BANE (O.S.)

Where a thousand men have

languished for years. Under the

Dent Act. Under the name of this

MAN -

BANE

Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and

over you, as a shining example of

justice and good...

BLAKE

We're gonna keep moving you, till

we can get you in front of a camera

-

108.

BANE

But they supplied you a false idol.

A straw man. To placate. To stop

you tearing down this corrupt

city...

BANE (O.S.)

...and rebuilding it the way it

should have been rebuilt

generations ago...

BANE

Let me tell you the truth about

Harvey Dent. In the words of

Gotham's Police Commissioner, James

Gordon...

BANE

'The truth about Harvey Dent is

simple in only one regard - it has

been hidden for too long. After his

devastating injuries, Harvey's mind

has recovered no better than his

mutilated face. He was a broken,

dangerous man, not the crusader for

justice that I, James Gordon, have

portrayed him to be for the last

eight years. Harvey's rage was

indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He

held my family at gunpoint, then

fell to his death in the struggle

over my son's life. The Batman did

not murder Harvey Dent - he saved

(MORE)

109.

BANE (CONT'D)

my boy. Then took the blame for

Harvey's appalling crimes, so that

I could, to my shame, build a lie

around this fallen idol.'

BANE (V.O.)

'I praised the madman who tried to

murder my own child.'

BANE

'The things we did in Harvey's name

brought desperately needed security

to our streets... But I can no

longer live with my lie. It is time

to trust the people of Gotham with

the truth, and it is time for me to

resign.'

Do you accept this man's

resignation?

BANE

Do you accept the resignation of

all the liars?! All the corrupt?!

110.

BLAKE

These men, locked up in Blackgate

for eight years, denied parole

under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.

GORDON

A lie to keep a city from burning

to the ground. Gotham needed a

hero, someone to believe in -

BLAKE

Not as much as it does now. But you

betrayed everything you stood for.

GORDON

(looks at Blake)

There's a point. Far out there.

When the structures fail you. When

the rules aren't weapons anymore,

they're shackles, letting the bad

get ahead. Maybe one day you'll

have such a moment of crisis. And

in that moment, I hope you have a

friend like I did. To plunge their

hands into the filth so you can

keep yours clean.

BLAKE

Your hands look pretty filthy to

me, Commissioner.

BANE

We take Gotham from the corrupt.

The rich. The oppressors of

generations who've kept you down

with the myth of opportunity. And

we give it to you, the people.

Gotham is yours - none shall

interfere. Do as you please...

(MORE)

111.

BANE (CONT'D)

But start by storming Blackgate and

freeing the oppressed... Step

forward, those who would serve...

BANE (V.O.)

For an army will be raised...

BANE (V.O.)

The powerful will be ripped from

their decadent nests...

BANE (V.O.)

...and cast into the cold world the

rest of us have known and

endured...

BANE (V.O.)

Courts will be convened...

112.

BANE (V.O.)

The spoils will be enjoyed...

BANE (V.O.)

Blood will be shed...

BANE (V.O.)

But the police will live, until

they are ready to serve true

justice...

BANE (V.O.)

This great city will endure...

BANE (V.O.)

Gotham will survive.

PRISONER

He says you must first straighten

your back.

113.

WAYNE

How would he know?

PRISONER

He was the prison doctor. A

morphine addict who incurred the

displeasure of powerful people.

Including your masked friend.

WAYNE

How?

PRISONER

Many years ago, during a time of

plague, Bane was attacked by other

prisoners. The doctor's fumbling

attempts to repair the damage left

him in perpetual agony. The mask

holds his pain at bay.

WAYNE

Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was

he born here?

PRISONER

The legend is that there was a

mercenary working for the local

warlord who fell in love with his

daughter. They married in secret.

PRISONER

When the warlord found out, he

condemned the mercenary to this

pit. But then exiled him instead.

PRISONER

The mercenary understood that the

warlord's daughter had secured his

release, but he couldn't know the

true price of his freedom. She had

taken his place in the pit.

114.

PRISONER

And she was with the child. The

mercenary's child.

PRISONER

One day the doctor forgot the lock

the cell...

PRISONER

Innocence cannot flower

underground. It was to be stamped

out. But the child had a friend. A

protector...

PRISONER

...who showed the others that this

innocence was their redemption. The

mother was not so lucky.

PRISONER

This is Bane's prison now. Bane

would not want this story told.

You have a protruding

vertebra...I'm going to force it

back...

WAYNE

How -?

PRISONER

You stay like this. Until you

stand.

115.

R 'S AL GH L (O.S.)

A U

Did you not think I'd return,

Bruce?

A U

R 'S AL GH L

A U

I told you I was immortal.

WAYNE

I watched you die.

R 'S AL GH L

A U

There are many forms of

immortality.

A

R 'S AL GH L

A U

Once I had a wife. My great love.

She was taken from me...

A

WAYNE

You were the mercenary. Bane is

your child. Your heir.

A

R 'S AL GH L

A U

An heir to ensure the League of

Shadows fulfills its duty to

restore balance to civilization.

WAYNE

No...

R 'S AL GH L

A U

You yourself fought the decadence

of Gotham for years. With all your

strength and resources, all your

moral authority. And the only

victory you could achieve was a

lie. Finally you understand...

Gotham is beyond saving...

116.

WAYNE

NO!

R 'S AL GH L

A U

And must be allowed to die.

BLAKE

For the bus in case there's a

chance to evacuate. Keep it in here

- people are siphoning parked cars.

FATHER REILLY

Really?

BLAKE

(GRINS)

How do you think I got it?

FATHER REILLY

Right. Any news? Is the

COMMISSIONER -

BLAKE

Less you know, Father. How're the

boys?

117.

FATHER REILLY

Power's been on more, so they get

some TV.

Blake, you be careful out there.

They're hunting down cops like

dogs.

JEN

Who's that?

SELINA

This was someone's home.

JEN

Now it's everyone's home.

JEN

'Storm's coming', remember? This is

what you wanted.

SELINA

No. It's what I thought I wanted.

PRISONER

Why build yourself?

WAYNE

I'm not meant to die in here.

118.

PRISONER

Here? There? What's the difference?

PRISONER

I told you it could not be done.

WAYNE

You told me a child did it...

PRISONER

No ordinary child...

A child born in hell.

A child forged by suffering,

hardened by pain...

Not a man from privilege.

119.

FOLEY

You have ID?

SPECIAL FORCES 1

Of course not.

FOLEY

How can we trust you?

GORDON (O.S.)

We don't have any choice.

SPECIAL FORCES 1

Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones,

Special Forces.

GORDON

Captain, glad to have you here.

120.

CAPTAIN JONES

How many of you are there?

GORDON

Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.

But the men trapped underground

number almost three thousand.

CAPTAIN JONES

What kind of shape they're in?

GORDON

They've been getting water, food.

CAPTAIN JONES

Could we break them out?

BLAKE

Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries

guarding the outflow south of

Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,

you've got a hole big enough for

ten at a time. I'm in contact with

my partner - they're waiting for

the day.

SPECIAL FORCES 2

Men who haven't seen daylight for

three months?

BLAKE

Men with automatic weapons who

haven't seen daylight in three

months.

CAPTAIN JONES

What about the bomb? The satellites

can't see any radiation hot

spots...

GORDON (V.O.)

They keep it on a truck - it must

have a lead-lined roof. They move

it constantly.

CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)

But you know the truck?

121.

GORDON (V.O.)

They've got three of them. The

routes don't vary much.

CAPTAIN JONES

What about the triggerman?

GORDON

No leads. It's a bluff - Bane

wouldn't give control of that bomb

to someone else.

CAPTAIN JONES

We can't take that chance. Until we

have the triggerman, we just track

the device, smuggle men over -

BLAKE

While Gotham lives under a warlord,

like in some failed state?

CAPTAIN JONES

Dial it back, officer. This

situation is unprecedented. We

can't do anything to risk millions

of lives.

BLAKE

(TO GORDON)

Aren't you gonna tell him?!

GORDON

Captain, things are more

complicated than you think. There's

somebody you need to meet. Blake?

122.

BLAKE

I was up here looking for a vantage

point. Found the people who run the

corporation who owns it living

here.

CAPTAIN JONES

Which corporation?

FOX (O.S.)

Wayne Enterprises.

BLAKE

Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd

like you to brief the Captain.

FOX

Miss Tate is fully aware of the

situation.

MIRANDA

And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I

have to take responsibility for it.

CAPTAIN JONES

Why?

MIRANDA

Because, Captain, we built it.

CAPTAIN JONES

You built the bomb?

FOX

It was built as a fusion reactor.

The first of its kind. Bane turned

the core into a bomb, then

disconnected it from the reactor.

123.

BLAKE

And here's the important part.

FOX

As the device's fuel cells decay,

it's becoming increasingly

unstable...until the point of

detonation.

BLAKE

The bomb's a time bomb.

FOX

And it will go off. In twenty-three

days.

BLAKE

Bane's revolution is a sham. He's

watching Gotham rearrange its

deckchairs while the whole ship's

going down. Your appeasement plan

might not be as practical as you

thought.

CAPTAIN JONES

Could you disarm it?

FOX

I don't know, But I could reconnect

it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

CAPTAIN JONES

We'd have to let the Pentagon know.

SPECIAL FORCES 2

They'll be monitoring our

FREQUENCIES -

CAPTAIN JONES

We have no choice. Let's move away

from this location, then call it

in.

124.

BLAKE

Fox, somebody sold us out!

FOX

Take Miranda -

MERCERNARY

DOWN ON THE FLOOR!

CAPTAIN JONES

I'll die before I talk...

BANE

I'm on your schedule, Captain.

MERCERNARY

There were people living upstairs.

BANE

Give them over for judgement.

(Indicates bodies.) Hang them where

the world will see.

125.

PRISONER

He says the leap to freedom is not

about strength.

WAYNE

My body makes the jump.

BLIND PRISONER

(CRACKED ENGLISH)

Survival is the spirit. The soul.

WAYNE

My soul's as ready to escape as my

body.

BLIND PRISONER

Fear is why you fail.

WAYNE

I'm not afraid. I'm angry.

SKINNY PRISONER

Shouldn't you get him down?

126.

PRISONER

He'll keep.

THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)

And why do we fall?

BLIND PRISONER

(CRACKED ENGLISH)

You do not fear death. You think

this makes you strong. This makes

you weak.

WAYNE

Why?

BLIND PRISONER

How can you move faster then

possible? Fight longer than

possible? If not from the most

powerful impulse of the spirit. The

fear of death. The will to survive.

WAYNE

I do fear death. I fear dying in

here while my city burns with no

one there to save it.

BLIND PRISONER

Then make the climb.

WAYNE

How?

BLIND PRISONER

As the child did. Without the rope.

(Dry laugh.) Then fear will find

you again.

127.

PRISONER

Supplies for your journey?

STRYVER

I want to see Bane! There's been a

mistake! Take me to Bane!

128.

STRYVER

There's been a mistake! Where's

Bane?!

VOICE (O.S.)

There's been no mistake, Mr.

Stryver.

CRANE

You are Philip Stryver, executive

vice-president of Daggett

Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)

The same Philip Stryver who for

years lived like a prince off the

blood and sweat of people less

powerful?

STRYVER

Call Bane! I'm one of you!

CRANE

Bane has no authority here. This is

merely a sentencing hearing. The

choice is yours, death or exile.

STRYVER

Exile.

CRANE

(SMASHES GAVEL)

Sold...to the man in the cold

sweat!

129.

BLACKGATE INMATE

Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -

you're dead in minutes.

STRYVER

Has anyone made it?

GORDON

Where the hell are they? It's not

like we have a lot of time, here.

COP

How long?

GORDON

The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've

got about eighteen hours to do

something.

COP

To do what?

GORDON

We mark that truck. Get a GPS on

it, then we can start thinking

about how to take it down.

GORDON

(LOW)

That's it?

GORDON

Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!

130.

BLAKE

You shouldn't be out on the streets

-

FOLEY'S WIFE

Jim. He's not here -

GORDON

You're sending your wife to the

door when the city's under

occupation?!

FOLEY

Wait in the kitchen, honey.

GORDON

What did you do, bury your uniform

in the backyard?

FOLEY

Jim, you saw what they did to those

Special Forces.

GORDON

You forgotten all the years we went

out on patrol with every gangbanger

wanting to plant one as soon as our

backs were turned?

FOLEY

This is different and you know it.

These guys run the city - the

government's done a deal with them

-

GORDON

Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a

vice. That's not a deal -

FOLEY

You move against Bane, the

triggerman's gonna hit the button -

131.

GORDON

You think he's given control of

that bomb to one of 'the people'?!

You think this is part of some

revolution? There's one man with

his finger on the button - Bane.

FOLEY

We have to keep our heads down

until they can fix this. If you

still had family here maybe you'd -

GORDON

This only gets fixed from inside

the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,

I'm not asking you to walk down

Grand in your dress blues. But

we've got to do something before

this maniac blows us all to hell.

FOLEY

I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

GORDON

Keep your head down? What's that

gonna do tomorrow, when that thing

blows?

FOLEY

You don't know that's going to

happen.

MIRANDA (O.S)

I hear you're looking for men,

Commissioner.

MIRANDA

How about me, instead?

GORDON

Miss Tate, I can't ask you -

MIRANDA

My company built it.

GORDON

Bruce Wayne built it.

132.

MIRANDA

And he wanted to destroy it. It was

me who didn't listen. Please.

GORDON

Let's go.

GANGBANGER

You steal from us, you little

bastard?

SELINA

You boys know you can't come into

my neighborhood without asking

politely.

SELINA

Never steal anything from someone

you can't outrun, kid.

KID

Now you're gonna take it.

SELINA

Just tax.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Pretty generous, for a thief.

133.

SELINA

You came back. I thought they'd

killed you.

WAYNE

Not yet.

SELINA

If you're expecting an apology -

WAYNE

It wouldn't suit you. I need your

help.

SELINA

And why would I help you?

WAYNE

For this. The 'Clean Slate'.

SELINA

You're gonna trust me with that?

After what I did to you?

WAYNE

I admit I felt a little let down.

But I still think there's more to

you. In fact, I think for you -

(indicates USB) this isn't a tool,

it's an escape route. You want to

disappear. Start fresh.

SELINA

Start fresh? I can't even get off

this island.

WAYNE

I can give you a way off. Once

you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I

need you to find out where they're

holding him. Then take me in.

SELINA

Why do you need Fox?

WAYNE

To save this city.

134.

SELINA

Who says it needs saving? Maybe I

like it this way.

WAYNE

Maybe you do. But tomorrow that

bomb's going off.

SELINA

Get your powerful friend on the

case.

WAYNE

I'm trying. But I need Fox.

GORDON

Stay further up the block. (Points

at Men.) They're gonna cross the

street and try and slow the truck

down. As it approaches, hit this

button. If the needle hits two

hundred - give me the signal and I

mark the truck. Okay?

BLAKE

(OVER RADIO)

Heads up.

GORDON

Got it.

MERCENARY

Commissioner Gordon, you're under

arrest.

135.

GORDON

On whose authority?

MERCERNARY

The people of Gotham.

BASEMENT THUG 1

Find this one a spot, he's got a

big day tomorrow.

BASEMENT THUG 2

We all do. It's not every day you

bag Bruce Wayne...

MIRANDA

Bruce?

FOX

You picked a hell of a time to go

on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

WAYNE

How long until the core ignites?

FOX

That bomb goes off in twelve hours.

WAYNE

Unless we can connect it to the

reactor.

FOX

If you can get it there. I'll find

a way to plug it back in.

(Indicates Miranda.) Can you get

Miranda out?

136.

WAYNE

Not tonight. I'm sorry.

MIRANDA

Do what's necessary.

WAYNE

(TO FOX)

Tonight I need you.

FOX

What for?

WAYNE

To get me back in the game.

CATWOMAN

Sorry to spoil things, boys, but

Bane wants these guys himself...

WAYNE

I won't forget about you.

MIRANDA

I know.

FOX

I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

CATWOMAN

He should be so lucky.

137.

WAYNE

Any move I make against Bane or the

bomb - the triggerman sets it off.

FOX

They can't be using radio or cell -

too much interference. Infrared

doesn't have the range. It could

only be micro-burst long wave...

WAYNE

Could you block it?

FOX

Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance

mount from the Bat. You remember

where you parked?

CRANE

The charges are espionage and

attempted sabotage... Do you have

anything to say in your defense?

GORDON

No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort

of due process is this?

CRANE

More than you give Harvey's

prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt

is determined, this is merely a

sentencing hearing. What's it to

be, death or exile?

GORDON

Crane, if you think we are going

willingly out onto that ice, you've

got another think coming.

CRANE

Death, then?

138.

GORDON

Looks that way.

CRANE

Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By

exile.

BANE

Bring her to me.

LUCIUS

I think it's time to talk about my

year-end bonus...

FOX

She fly pretty well?

WAYNE

Even without the autopilot...

FOX

Autopilot? That's what you're there

for.

BATMAN (O.S.)

Light it up.

139.

FOLEY'S KIDS

Dad! Check it out!

FOLEY'S WIFE

Honey, take a look!

MERCENARY

Sir?

MERCENARY

You think it's really him?

BANE

Impossible...

140.

BATMAN

This blocks the remote detonator

signal to the bomb. Get it onto the

truck by sunrise. They might hit

the button when it starts.

GORDON

When what starts?

BATMAN

War.

BLAKE

You missed a spot.

BATMAN

If you're working alone, wear a

mask.

BLAKE

No one cares who I am.

BATMAN

The mask is not for you. It's to

protect the people you care about.

BLAKE

Huh. And you always seem to know

where those people are. How is

that?

BATMAN

I lost someone once. Since then I

break into their homes when they're

sleeping and implant a tracking

device on the back of their neck.

141.

BATMAN

On three - one, two, three -

BLAKE

No offense, but you got anything

bigger in that belt?

BATMAN

That's to warn the men on the other

side.

BLAKE

But how do we -?

BLAKE

Okay.

BLAKE

What now?

BATMAN

All-out assault on Bane...but you

need to get the people you care

about across the bridge.

BLAKE

Why?

BATMAN

In case we fail. Lead an exodus

across the bridge. Save as many

lives as you can.

BLAKE

Don't you need me here?

BATMAN

You've given me an army. Now go.

142.

BLAKE

Thank you.

BATMAN

Don't thank me yet.

BLAKE

I might not get a chance later.

CATWOMAN

Oh, you shouldn't have...

BATMAN

The mid-town tunnel's blocked by

debris, but the cannons give you

enough firepower to make a path for

people.

BATMAN

To start it, you -

CATWOMAN

I got it.

BATMAN

We've got forty-five minutes to

save this city -

CATWOMAN

No, I've got forty-five minutes to

get clear of the blast radius,

because you don't stand a chance

against these guys.

143.

BATMAN

With your help I might.

CATWOMAN

I'll open that tunnel, then I'm

gone.

BATMAN

There's more to you than that.

CATWOMAN

Sorry to keep letting you down.

Come with me. Save yourself. You

don't owe these people anymore -

you've given them everything...

BATMAN

Not everything. Not yet.

VOICE

(OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED

UPON.

144.

FOLEY

There's only one police in this

city.

BANE

Open fire.

GORDON

Come on, come on...

BANE

You came back. To die with your

city.

BATMAN

No. I came back to stop you.

145.

GORDON

That's impossible... Come on! Cut

over to Fifth!

BLAKE

Knock on doors, spread the word -

the bomb's going to blow! Get out

by the South Street tunnel, or over

the bridge! Do two blocks, then get

back to the bus!

146.

BANE

Stay back. He is mine -

BATMAN

Give me the trigger! You'd never

give it to an ordinary citizen -

BANE

I broke you. How have you come

back?

BATMAN

You thought you were the only one

who could learn the strength to

escape?

BANE

I never escaped - R 's al Gh l

A U

rescued me. That is why I must

fulfill his plan. That is why I

must avenge his murder.

BATMAN

(CONFUSED)

The child of R 's al Gh l made the

A U

CLIMB -

MIRANDA (O.S)

But he is not the child of R 's al

A

Gh l...

U

147.

MIRANDA

I am.

And though I am not 'ordinary', I

am a citizen...

MIRANDA/TALIA

My mother named me Talia before she

was killed. The way I would've been

killed if not for my

protector...Bane.

BANE

Goodbye.

TALIA

I climbed out of the pit...

I found my father and brought him

back to exact terrible vengeance -

but by that time...the prisoners

and the doctor had done their work

to my friend...my protector...

148.

A U

A U

TALIA

The League took us in. Trained

us...

TALIA (V.O.)

But my father could not accept

Bane.

A U

TALIA

He saw only a monster who could

never be tamed. Whose very

existence was a reminder of the

hell he'd left his wife to die in.

He excommunicated Bane from the

League of Shadows. His only crime

was that he loved me. I could not

truly forgive my father...

Until you murdered him.

BATMAN

He was trying to kill millions of

innocent people -

TALIA

'Innocent' is a strong word to

throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor

my father by finishing his work.

Vengeance against the man who

killed him is simply a reward for

my patience...

You see, it's the slow knife...the

knife that takes its time, the

(MORE)

149.

TALIA (CONT'D)

knife that waits years without

forgetting, then slips quietly

between bones...that's the knife -

- that cuts deepest.

BATMAN

Your knife may have been too

slow...

MERCENARY

The truck's under attack -

TALIA

Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a

way to block my signal. No matter -

(Looks at watch.) He's bought

Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at

Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We

must secure the bomb until it

detonates.

TALIA

Not yet... I want him to feel the

heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of

twelve million souls you failed.

Goodbye, my friend.

150.

BANE

You'll have to imagine the fire -

We both know I need to kill you

now.

CATWOMAN

The whole no-guns thing? I don't

feel as strongly about it as you

do.

UNIFORM

Stay there! What are you doing?!

BLAKE

(PULLS BADGE)

Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys

to safety -

UNIFORM

Safety?! You're gonna get us all

killed. Anyone crosses this bridge

they blow the city -

151.

BLAKE

It's gonna blow anyway. We need

this bridge open right now.

UNIFORM

No one leaves the island. Orders -

BLAKE

Whose orders? Bane's?

UNIFORM

Police Department's.

BLAKE

Haven't you heard the shooting? The

Batman's battling it out with Bane

-

UNIFORM

The Batman's dead. Look, Officer -

BLAKE

It's Detective -

UNIFORM

Well, Detective, you take one more

step, we have to shoot you. Two

more steps, we have to blow the

bridge.

BLAKE

(to the boys)

Wait for me back at the bus.

BATMAN

I need you on the ground, me in the

air, we have to force that convoy

east, to the entrance to the

REACTOR -

152.

BLAKE

Your orders are out of date! The

situation's changed! Listen, I'm a

cop like you. And I'm walking out

there. Please don't shoot me.

UNIFORM

Son-of-a-bitch! (To his partner.)

Blow it! Before he reaches the line

-

UNIFORM

Get down! We're blowing the bridge!

153.

BLAKE

You idiots! You sons of bitches!

You're killing us!!

PRAYING -

BLAKE

Father! Get the boys on the bus -

FATHER REILLY

But there's nowhere to go, son.

154.

TUMBLER DRIVER

(OVER RADIO)

They're trying to force us onto

GRAND -

TALIA

Pushing us to the entrance of the

reactor. They're going to try and

reconnect the core.

TUMBLER DRIVER

(OVER RADIO)

Can they?

155.

GORDON

Give me a hand!

Let's get a cable on it and drag it

out! Come on, we're almost there -

TALIA

Fox showed me how to operate the

reactor core. Including the

emergency flood -

TALIA

There is no way to stop this bomb.

Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at

Batman.) My father's work is done.

GORDON

What're you doing?

BATMAN

Two minutes. I can fly it out over

the bay...

CATWOMAN

Rig it out to fly over the water,

then bail -

156.

BATMAN

No autopilot.

CATWOMAN

You could've gone anywhere. Been

anything. But you came back here.

BATMAN

So did you.

CATWOMAN

I guess we're both suckers.

GORDON

So this is the part where you

vanish, only this time you don't

come back?

BLAKE

Come on! On the bus!

FATHER REILLY

What're you doing?

BLAKE

Protection from the blast -

FATHER REILLY

It's an atom bomb -!

BLAKE

You think they need to hear that in

their last seconds? You think I'm

going to let them die without hope?

157.

GORDON

I never cared who you were -

BATMAN

And you were right.

GORDON

But shouldn't the people know the

hero who saved them?

BATMAN

A hero can be anyone. That was

always the point.

Anyone. A man doing something as

simple and reassuring as putting a

coat around a little boy's

shoulders to let him know that the

world hadn't ended...

-

GORDON

Bruce Wayne?

BLAKE

Heads down! Heads down, now!

158.

FATHER REILLY

Blake, they need to make their

peace.

BLAKE

They're children! They have no

peace to make -

Get down! This is it!

LITTLE BOY

No. That's Batman!

GORDON (V.O.)

'I see a beautiful city and a

brilliant people rising from this

abyss...'

GORDON (V.O.)

'I see the lives for which I lay

down my life, peaceful, useful,

prosperous and happy...'

159.

GORDON

'I see that I hold a sanctuary in

their hearts, and in the hearts of

their descendants, generations

hence. It is a far, far better

thing that I do, than I have ever

done...'

'It is a far, far better rest that

I go to than I have ever known.'

ALFRED

I'm so sorry. I failed you. You

trusted me, and I failed you.

GORDON

Can I change your mind about

quitting the force?

BLAKE

No. What you said about structures.

About shackles. I can't take it.

The injustice. (Gestures at

gardens.) I mean...no one's ever

going to know who saved an entire

city.

GORDON

They know. (Off look.) It was

Batman.

160.

VOICE (V.O.)

Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to

reflect his more modest estate...

LAWYER

Nonetheless, there are considerable

assets to dispose of... The

contents of the house are to be

SOLD -

LAWYER (V.O.)

- to settle the estate's accounts.

The remainder is left in its

entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...

LAWYER

The house and grounds are left to

the city of Gotham, on condition

that they never be demolished,

altered, or otherwise interfered

WITH -

161.

LAWYER (V.O.)

And that they shall be used for one

purpose, and one purpose only...

The housing and care of the city's

at-risk and orphaned children.

LAWYER

My clerk will help anyone with the

smaller correspondences and

instructions...

BLAKE

Blake, John.

CLERK

(CHECKS LIST)

Nothing here.

BLAKE

Try my legal name.

CLERK

Yup, here it is.

CLERK

You should use your full name. I

like that name... Robin.

162.

LAWYER

Any word on the missing item?

CLERK

No, not yet.

LAWYER

Well, they'd better leave no stone

unturned... We can't just put a

string of pearls on the manifest as

'lost'.

TECH 1

Why worry about the stabilization

software? This whole autopilot

system's obsolete -

FOX

Please, I just need to know what I

could've done to fix it.

TECH 2

But Mr. Fox, it's already been

fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software

patch...six months ago.

FOX

(CONFUSED)

Check the user ident on the

patch...

TECH 2

Huh. Bruce Wayne.

163.

WAITER

Lei e solo?

ALFRED

Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.

164.
