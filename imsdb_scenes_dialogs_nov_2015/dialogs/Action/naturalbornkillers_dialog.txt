WRITTEN BY

QUENTIN TARANTINO

MICKEY

What kind of pies do you have?

MABEL

Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

MICKEY

Which do you recommend?

MABEL

The key lime is great, but it's

an acquired taste.

MICKEY

I haven't had a key lime pie in ten

years.

MABEL

When ya had it, did ya like it?

MICKEY

No, but that don't mean much. I was a

completely different person ten years

ago. Let's give key lime a day in

court. And a large glass of milk.

MABEL

(to someone O.S.)

Should I make that two pieces?

MALLORY

Nada, Rosey.

MABEL

(annoyed)

My name's not Rosey.

(points at name tag)

It's Mabel.

MALLORY

Whatever.

MABEL

Hey, what the hell do you think you're

doin'?

MABEL

(to Mickey)

She ought not be doing that. That's

for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

MICKEY

I can't take her anywhere.

EARL

Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.

Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er

out.

SONNY

Good God almighty. What the hell is

that?

OTIS

That's a bitch outta hell, son.

SONNY

Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

SONNY

Miller, Mabel.

MABEL

Comin' up.

SONNY

(to Mickey)

That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't

it?

MICKEY

Her name's Mallory.

OTIS

Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.

I'm just getting warmed up.

SONNY

Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

MICKEY

Just because my woman's mopping up the

floor with your buddy is no reason for

you to join in.

MICKEY

Honey.

MICKEY

(to Mallory)

Pick one.

MALLORY

Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a

nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let

him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My

mom told me to pick the best one and

you are it.

MABEL

NO!

MALLORY

When you tell people what went on here,

tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did

this. Understand?

CAPTAIN SQUERI

Send Scagnetti in here.

SCAGNETTI

You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)

Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room

C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the

prison board, is waiting to meet you.

You're gonna deliver two prisoners from

the county jail to Nystrom Insane

Asylum in Bakersfield.

SCAGNETTI

This is bullshit. I'm a detective.

You want an errand boy, call Jerry

Lewis.

CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)

Jack!

SCAGNETTI

Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

MCCLUSKY

Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,

Scagnetti. You put an end to a

nightmare. The ladies of this city can

get to sleep again, and they have you

to thank.

SCAGNETTI

Thank you, sir.

MCCLUSKY

Dewight McClusky of the California

Prison Board. Take a seat please.

MCCLUSKY

(referring to book)

This is damn good reading. I'm

surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.

This would make a better movie than

that 'Serpico' shit.

MCCLUSKY

I think you'll find that good reading

as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.

You familiar with them?

SCAGNETTI

Who isn't?

MCCLUSKY

You been followin' the news coverage?

SCAGNETTI

They've been separated since their

incarceration in a couple of

penitentiaries---

MCCLUSKY

Susanville, Soledade.

SCAGNETTI

They've killed a shitload of inmates

and guards---

MCCLUSKY

Five inmates, eight guards and one

psychiatrist all in one year's time...

Very good. You do keep up with the

headlines.

MCCLUSKY

Look, our situation in a nutshell is,

no prison wants 'em, no prison will

take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,

where the warden's as hard as a bar of

iron. No one wants those fuckin'

assholes behind their walls, dealin'

with 'em day in, day out.

SCAGNETTI

I can appreciate that.

MCCLUSKY

So can we. So the solution to our

little problem is we had them deemed

crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to

Nystrom Asylum for the criminally

insane.

SCAGNETTI

Lobotomy Bay?

MCCLUSKY

You've heard of it?

SCAGNETTI

So, how do I fit into this scheme?

MCCLUSKY

The public loves you Jack...You don't

mind if I call you Jack, do you?

SCAGNETTI

By all means.

MCCLUSKY

You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six

years on the force, a best-seller out on

paperback...

MCCLUSKY

A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent

lawman with a deadly axe to grind with

maniacs.

MCCLUSKY

You're a breathing icon of justice and

that's why you were chosen to deliver

Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison

board we, knows that once you get them

on the road if anything should happen,

an escape attempt, an accident, fire,

anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti

would be there to look out for his

public's best interests.

SCAGNETTI

I see.

MCCLUSKY

You write the script Jack, call it,

'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination

of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...

Have we found our man?

CUT TO:

MCCLUSKY

Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through

with a visitor!

MCCLUSKY

Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my

years with the penal institution, and

I'll tell ya that's no small number,

Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a

doubt the most twisted, depraved group

of fucks it's ever been my displeasure

to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two

rat shits are a walkin' reminder of

just how fucked up our system really

is.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

Who's the song bird?

MCCLUSKY

Mickey's better half herself. Mallory

Knox. This little lady drowned her

father in a fish tank.

MCCLUSKY

While the two together burned her

mother alive in her bed.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

Why?

MCCLUSKY

Because they wouldn't give them their

blessing for marriage.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

Ain't love grand.

MCCLUSKY

Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)

When pressed about the reason for the

murders...patient became hostile...

MALLORY

I don't owe you an explanation! I don't

owe you shit! I'm not here for your

entertainment. If I don't tell you

what you wanna hear, what are you gonna

do? Throw me in jail? I'm already

there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna

give me some more time? I've already

got life. What else you got to

threaten me with? Death? I'd like to

see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one

motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

MCCLUSKY

Here she is...you know her, you

love her, you can't live without

her...Mallory Knox.

MALLORY

(singing)

99 years is a long, long time. Look at

me, I will never be free, I'm a long time

woman...

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)

Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to

meet you.

MALLORY

(singing)

Been workin' on the road now.

Been workin' by the sea.

Been workin' in the cane fields.

and I wanna be free...

SCAGNETTI

Jesus Christ!

MCCLUSKY

Don't worry about it. She does that

all the time.

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)

Follow me.

WURLITZER

You duckin' me Dewight?

MCCLUSKY

Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

WURLITZER

(to Scagnetti)

This son of a bitch is chairman of the

prison board, but it's like pullin'

teeth to get him down to a prison.

MCCLUSKY

The only reason I'm here now is to set

him straight, and I'm on the next

flight out.

(to Scagnetti)

Jack, this is the superintendent of the

jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man

who's got the power of the pen here.

WURLITZER

Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your

book. I'm impressed. Good work on

Curtis Fox.

SCAGNETTI

Thanks.

MCCLUSKY

From now on, you'll be dealin' with

Phil. He can answer all the questions

you got about the arrangements. I'm

gonna be bidding you good luck and

adieu in about twenty minutes. My

flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in

a hour.

WURLITZER

And I want you to know, we'll all cry a

river when you're gone.

SCAGNETTI

What's the travelling arrangements?

WURLITZER

Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be

together. So, we'll put you on one of

our prison busses and you'll take

Mallory first, then you'll come back

for Mickey.

SCAGNETTI

And where do you keep Mickey?

WURLITZER

We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,

darkest cell in the whole place. But

it just so happens that right now he's

got a special visitor.

SCAGNETTI

Who?

WURLITZER

Wayne Gayle.

SCAGNETTI

(surprised)

Wayne Gayle!

WAYNE

(into recorder)

Testing one...two...three...

testing...one...three...over,

over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

WAYNE

(to himself)

Showtime.

WAYNE

Hello Mickey. We've never been

introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I

don't know if you've ever heard of me

or remember me. I was one of the

reporters outside the courthouse during

your trial---

MICKEY

Everybody knows who you are. You're

famous.

WAYNE

I could say the same thing about you.

(smiles)

I want to thank you very much for

seeing me...

WAYNE

I have a television show. It's very

popular. Every week we do a profile on

a different serial killer. You don't

mind if I call you a serial killer, do

you?

WAYNE

The episode we did on Mickey and

Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

MICKEY

Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

WAYNE

Yes.

MICKEY

Whose ratings were higher?

WAYNE

Yours.

MICKEY

How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on

him?

WAYNE

Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

MICKEY

Good...yuppie piece of shit.

WAYNE

What I'd like to do---

MICKEY

How 'bout Manson?

WAYNE

Manson beat you.

MICKEY

Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the

king.

WAYNE

We've been waiting to do a follow up

episode on you for a long time. And

that time has definitely come.

(pause)

I feel it's apparent to anyone who's

hip to what's going on that the prison

board has thrown the constitution

straight out the fuckin' window.

You and Mallory may be killers, but

you're not insane. You belong in a

prison, not in an asylum. The prison

board is blatantly railroading you into

a hospital for the sole purpose of

turning you into vegetables. Now some

people are saying, 'So what?' I am not

one of those people. If we avert our

eyes while they do this to you, we give

them permission to do it again whenever

they see fit. Today they wipe clean

your mind because they feel your

actions are dangerous, tomorrow they

wipe clean my mind because they feel

what I say is dangerous. Where does

it all stop?

WAYNE

My problem Mickey, is that you don't

exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone

on this. I need your help. I want

what the prison board is doing to be

the focus of our follow up episode.

Now I have interviews with chairman of

the prison board Dewight McClusky about

this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,

Mickey, he looks bad. The two

psychologists they used for their

psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk

to us, which always looks bad. I have

an interview with both the judge of

your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the

psychologist and author, Emil

Reinghold, both of which discount the

notion that you're insane. You put

that all together, and what the state

is doing becomes obvious. But the

network isn't satisfied. They feel the

show needs another element. It needs

you. In order to put the show on the

air, I need to get an interview with

you. You haven't talked to the press

since your trial. Now, a few days

before you get transferred to an

asylum, you grant an interview on

television with Wayne Gayle. We're

talkin' a media event here. Every son

of a bitch out the with a TV set's

gonna tune in to see that.

We'll make their motives so blatant,

we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole

thing. At least for a little while,

the publicity would keep them from just

giving you and Mallory lobotomies.

Well, whatta ya say?

MICKEY

Have you talked to Mallory about this?

WAYNE

She won't even see me, Mickey. Now

you're not supposed to know anything

about what's going on with her, but I'm

gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you

two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't

spoken one word.

MICKEY

She doesn't talk?

WAYNE

Not to anybody. She sings.

MICKEY

She sings? What does she sing?

WAYNE

Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The

Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty

Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be

With You'. That's what I hear anyway.

Her behaviour was the main thing the

doctors' report used against you. So

even if she would see me, which she

won't, I couldn't put her on camera

anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are

you insane?' And she starts singing

'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',

that blows our whole case.

DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)

Time, motherfucker!

WAYNE

Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an

answer.

WAYNE

(yells after him)

Just think about it. But don't think

too long.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.

At night I get the chills. I pretend

you're lying next to me, holding me

from behind with your leg draped over

mine and your arms wrapped tightly

around me. I lie in my cell...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...and imagine kissing you. Not

making love, just kissing for hours and

hours on end. I remember everything

about our time. I remember every joke

you ever told.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I remember every secret you ever

shared. Shared or revealed? I think

shared is proper. I remember every

single time you laughed.

MICKEY

I remember every meal we ever ate. I

remember your cooking. I especially

remember your casseroles. I remember

watching David Letterman.

MICKEY

I remember driving fast...faster,

man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe

de Ville.

CUT TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet

up on the dash, singing along with the

radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A

Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of

Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary

Goes', 'Groove Me'...

DISSOLVE TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

And your dancing, my God, your dancing.

I lie on my bed and go over every day,

every minute of our happiness. Every

day take a day of our time and go

through it hour by hour. I don't jump

ahead either. I take it as it comes,

and I live that day again. That way

when I get to our first kiss...

DISSOLVE TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

The killing of your parents, our

wedding...They're not just memories.

I feel that joy again...

DISSOLVE TO:

WAYNE

(reading out loud)

'After taking a few days to reflect on

your offer, I've come to the conclusion

that you are one hundred percent

correct. A national TV interview would

be very advantageous to both Mallory

and I. The only obstacle is they're

shipping me out to the funny farm in

four days. However, that is your

problem and not mine. I feel confident

you'll manage. Here's to us making

television history. Sincerely, Mickey

Knox.'

WAYNE

Am I a God or what?

WAYNE

Drink up! This is a celebration. This

is the day we received word we were

gonna make television history. We're

gonna have the first sit down, in depth

interview with the most charismatic

serial killer ever, one day before he's

being shipped to a mental hospital for

the rest of his life. This is one of

those golden moments that happens maybe

only four times in a lucky journalist's

career. This is Wallace with Noriega,

this is Elton John confessing his

bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this

is the tearful reporting of the

Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut

setting the record straight on

Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,

this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting

Deep Throat in an underground parking

lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The

Ten Days That Shook The World', this is

the hippies' bloody palms at Kent

State, the Maysles brothers at

Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost

interviews...

ROGER

This is Raymond Burr witnessing the

destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

SCOTT

What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

WAYNE

We got tonight and tomorrow to get our

shit together. The day after that

they're shippin' Mallory. That's when

we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause

the next day he goes.

SCOTT

Would the network really not run it

without the interview?

WAYNE

Are you kidding? The last thing they

expected was Mickey Knox to get up

close and personal. They wanted a

follow up episode and would've taken

anything I had given them. I'm not

gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna

make him think his grey matter depends

on it. When I told Woody and the brass

about this coup, they practically shit

a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.

They want to expand the show to a hour,

and they want it on immediately.

ROGER

How immediate is immediately?

WAYNE

Next week's episode.

ROGER

We don't got enough footage for a hour

follow up.

SCOTT

(pointing at Roger)

What he said.

WAYNE

Rape and pillage the first episode,

just change the order a bit. Those

sons of bitches out there ain't gonna

know the difference. All that shit is

just filler for the interview anyway.

We film a new intro. Show some old

footage from the first episode so the

get a brief history of Mickey and

Mallory. We introduce a new angle...

what the prison board is up to. We

see some of that new shit, then the

rest of the show is the interview. Now

what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,

Julie make a note: I need Woody to get

me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'

broadcast to promote next weeks show.

We'll do a feed right from the jail

while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

WAYNE

You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,

keep it simple.

SCOTT

Betacam with remote and two-way comm

link. Got it.

(opens eyes)

How about the interview...What camera

do you want to use?

WAYNE

I see...high contrast sixteen

millimetre black and white, and I mean

black and white, where the black's

black and the white's white. This is

for posterity, so fuck video. Film!

Film! Film!

WAYNE

So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and

planning the interview.

(points at Roger & Scott)

You two go down to the editing bay,

take the old footage and the new

footage, put it together, and see what

we got. Get it into shape so when we

finish the interview, we can just stick

it in.

SCOTT

When do you want the assembly?

WAYNE

Tomorrow.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WAYNE

At that point I'll ask him if he

believes in God. If he says yes, I'll

ask him what he thinks God would make

of his actions. And is he worried

about burning in hell? If he says no,

I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you

believe in?' And hopefully he'll say

something like a live round of ammo,

the expression on the face of a man he

just split up the middle, Mallory's

eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.

He's bound to say something

provocative.

WAYNE

Okay, boys, let's have it.

SCOTT

Well, basically, what we did was put

part of the old show on first...

ROGER

But we changed the order around so it

wasn't super obvious...

SCOTT

Then we added the new shit to the

tail...

ROGER

So we film the interview, and we can

just slap it on at the end.

WAYNE

Okay, let's see it.

ROGER (O.S.)

Now we got to film a new intro for the

follow up episode. But we put the

intro for the first episode at the

beginning temporarily so you can see it

with some scope.

WAYNE (V.O.)

I hear ya. Play.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'.

I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is

Highway 58.

WAYNE

To some the fastest distance between

point A and point B. To others a

beautiful stretch to the American

landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory

Knox, it was a candy land of murder and

mayhem.

WAYNE (V.O.)

After living a very routine, drab,

nothing out-of-the-ordinary-ever-

happens kind of life, the sweethearts

shocked the entire nation with a

cross-country crime and murder spree

that lasted only three weeks, but

left---

WAYNE (V.O.)

---forty-eight known bodies in its

wake. Including---

WAYNE (V.O.)

---Mallory's very own parents.

WAYNE (V.O.)

They started their crime wave in Los

Angeles.

WAYNE

And they were finally apprehended here

at this Circle K in St. Paul,

Minnesota.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

They started off robbing 7/11 type

stores and gas stations and later

graduated to banks and the big time.

WAYNE

Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed

robbery was a little different than

most. It was an assault, actually.

BISHOP

Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory

kill everybody when they're through,

except for one clerk. There were a

couple of people in the store then, and

I was working with Stevo. And I like

Stevo, you know? But I was thinking,

what could I do to make them pick me to

be the clerk that gets to live?

MICKEY

Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!

Faster! Faster! Faster than that!

WAYNE (V.O.)

They'd storm in with shotguns, and kill

every customer in the place right off

the bat.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

Sick, isn't it?

(mournful pause)

After killing numerous people, the

would always leave one clerk alive.

One clerk...to give them the money,

and tell the tale of---

WAYNE (V.O.)

Mickey and Mallory.

WAYNE (V.O.)

Patrolman Gerald Nash was just one of

the twelve peace officers that Mickey

and Mallory murdered during their reign

of terror.

WAYNE (V.O.)

Gerald and his partner Dale Wrigley

were parked at...

WAYNE (V.O.)

...this donut shop, Alfie's Donuts.

When---

DALE

This '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville pulled

up about three spaces away. Gerald

came walking out with our coffee

and---

(begins to tear up)

my bear claw. When the driver of the

car asked him something, Gerald started

giving him what looked like street

directions. When he finished, the

driver waved him 'thanks,' brought up a

shotgun and---

WAYNE

Apparently bored with banditry and

murder, the two outlaws proved what

renaissance psychopaths they really

are. To break up the monotony in

between bank jobs, or what have you,

they started butchering whole

households at random.

WAYNE

Unfortunately, the story didn't end

with their capture. It just became

more surreal. Their subsequent trial

turned into a sick circus...

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

...As spectators, reporters, law

students, tourists, gawkers, the

interested, the curious, the devoted,

and the demented were drawn to the Los

Angeles county courthouse like moths to

a flame.

WAYNE

The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder

trial was so event filled it made the

crime spree that took place before pale

by comparison. The first point was the

decision of Mickey's to act as his own

council. Now this in itself is not

unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy

acted as his own council as well. What

was unexpected was how well Mickey's

performance would be.

WAYNE (V.O.)

We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was

the presiding judge during the Knox

trial.

JUDGE STEINSMA

Mickey was surprisingly effective.

When I was told I was to be the judge

of this trial and then I was told

Mickey Knox would be handling his own

defence, I got a headache that lasted

five days. But at first I breathed a

sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very

prepared, and proved to be an excellent

amateur lawyer.

WAYNE (V.O.)

However, this opinion isn't shared by

the state's prosecutor on this case,

Wanda Bisbing.

WAYNE

Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed

up very prepared and proved to be an

excellent amateur attorney.

BISBING

Oh, that's rich. Well, considering

that Mickey Knox turn his court into

a mockery and personally made him look

like a fool, I'd say that's very

benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far

as Mickey being an excellent amateur

lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but

when I went to law school, we were

taught the object was to win the case,

which I did.

WAYNE

The nation caught fire to Mickey and

Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory

mania, if you will, as the merits to

Mickey's talent as a defence attorney

became apparent.

Law students from all ends of the

country converged on Los Angeles as

legal history took a new course. But

that was only the lemon next to the

pie. And that pie is you, the American

people. That pie is the way the

strangely charismatic, and make no

mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey

and Mallory have captured the public's

interest, fear, and in some cases,

admiration.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

What do you think of Mickey and

Mallory?

CHUCK

Hot.

JEFF

Hot.

STEVE

Totally hot.

CHUCK

Mickey and Mallory's the best thing to

happen to mass murder since Manson.

STEVE

Forty-eight people known. They're way

cooler than Manson.

WAYNE

What do you think of Mickey and

Mallory?

MORGAN

Well, he's just...I dunno...

charismatic.

PAGE

They're so romantic.

INTENSE COP

I'm here to watch the judge give those

two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest

sentence the law allows. I want to see

their faces when the state says 'they

are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,

douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's

ever shit (BLEEP) out.

(referring to crowd

behind him)

And these assholes (BLEEP) are making

heroes outta sickos. You wanna know

who a hero is? You wanna know? I'll

tell ya who a Goddamn hero is. Mike

Griffin. Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin

is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)

should be revering. You know why Mike

Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya

why. Because he was killed in the line

of duty. Do you want to know how he

died?

WAYNE

Yes.

INTENSE COP

I'll tell you. Mike Jerome Griffin was

killed in the line of duty by those two

anti-heroes.

WAYNE

Tell me, Mr. Vossler, how many days of

the trial have you attended?

RUSSELL

Ahhh yesss, I've been fortunate enough

to attend two days. Law history in the

making. I've been a participant.

WAYNE

And you being a Harvard law student,

what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's

performance?

RUSSELL

Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the

courtroom trial rivals, dare I say

conquers that of master Melvin Belli.

He's like a magnificent loose cannon,

firing point blank in the prosecutor's

face. It is my anticipation---

WAYNE

You're talking about a man and a woman

who killed innocent people.

STEVE

Don't get us wrong...

CHUCK

We respect human life an' all.

JEFF

It's a tragedy.

STEVE

But...if I was a serial killer,

which I'm not, but if I was, I'd be

like Mickey.

MARVIN

They're like that crazy mother in the

first Dirty Harry movie. Member that

crazy ass mother? They're like him.

Mickey and Mallory be doin' some

cold-blooded shit. When I hear about

some of the shit they be doin' on TV, I

say 'Damn, that's fucked (BLEEP) up.'

PAGE

(laughing and blushing)

We sit in the courtroom all day and try

to catch Mickey's eye.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

What do you think of Mickey and

Mallory?

SIMON

I admire them.

NORMAN

I do, too.

WAYNE

(confused)

But how can you say that?

SIMON

They're mesmerising.

NORMAN

Hypnotizing.

SIMON

Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

WAYNE

Yes.

NORMAN

Then you've seen the scene where Arnold

Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou

Ferigno.

WAYNE

Yes.

SIMON

Through the power of the simple word---

NORMAN

And a snake-eye glare.

SIMON

---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was

able to totally psyche out any

confidence Ferigno had.

NORMAN

He squashed him mentally before

physically defeating him.

SIMON

He had the edge. The mind's edge.

NORMAN

Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

SIMON

Only on a much grander scale.

NORMAN

They've hypnotized the nation.

SIMON

Schwartzenegger was the king of the

edge before they came along.

WAYNE

You say this and yet...you two are

both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

SIMON

Yes.

NORMAN

Yes.

WAYNE

How can you say that you 'admire' them?

NORMAN

It's like this, Wayne. Two people are

standing in a dark room waiting for the

other to attack. These two people

can't see each other, yet they know

they're there. Now, they can either

stand in the dark room forever waiting

until they die of boredom, or one of

them can make the first move.

WAYNE

Why can't they just shake hands and be

friends?

NORMAN

They can't because neither knows if the

other is a deranged senseless killer

like the Knoxs. So, you may as well

make the first move.

WAYNE

And they made the first move?

NORMAN

Unfortunately, yes.

SIMON

But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

WAYNE

Why?

SIMON

They passed the 'edge' along to us.

WAYNE

How so?

SIMON

By taking away our legs. Now we have

to fight harder to get ahead than

anyone else you'll find in this gym.

Probably the whole city. They gave us

the fighting spirit. Before this

happened I was content. Now I'm pissed

off. Now I'm half a man and I've got

to work like the devil to get whole

again.

WAYNE

But you'll never be whole again.

SIMON

Never is a very long time, Wayne. A

word only the weak use. I'm not a sore

loser. Even if I don't have a leg to

stand on, I'm going to get up and fight

this world until I'm on top again.

NORMAN

That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

SIMON

That's the way of the world.

NORMAN

They're shocking the world into

remembering the primal law.

SIMON

Survival of the fittest.

WAYNE

One last question. Usually Mickey and

Mallory kill all of their victims. Why

did they let you two survive?

NORMAN

They had us tied down during one of

their house raids, you've seen the

headlines, and they were taking a

chainsaw to our legs before they were

gonna kill us.

SIMON

Just for fun, I guess.

NORMAN

And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,

'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

SIMON

Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,

'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

NORMAN

Apparently, they've seen all our films.

SIMON

They were especially influenced by

'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

NORMAN

So, Mallory calls 911 and they took

off.

SIMON

They actually apologized.

WAYNE

The couple proved so popular that a

motion picture glamorizing their

exploits was made...

WAYNE (V.O.)

The Movie 'Thrill Killers' proved to be

a tremendous box office success, making

stars out of the before then unknown---

WAYNE (V.O.)

---actors Jessie Alexander Warwick and

Buffy St.McQueen.

Let me telly ya about society and its

steppin' on people like me and her!

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

We talked with Neil Pope, writer and

director of 'Thrill Killers' for his

take on the Mickey and Mallory

phenomena.

NEIL POPE

It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory

Knox are a cultural phenomena that

could only exist in our sexually

repressed society. A flower that could

only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food

culture. A what I tried to do with

'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of

the problem all the way down the vine

to the original bad seed. Yet amidst

the violence and murder and carnage,

you've got the structure of a Wagnerian

love story.

MOVIE MALLORY

Mickey, honey, listen to me.

MOVIE MALLORY

I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

MOVIE MICKEY

I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,

but--

MOVIE MALLORY

I can't run with you, Mickey! I really

want to. If I could, I would, but I

can't. I gotta stay here. But you can

still get out of here.

MOVIE MICKEY

No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

MOVIE MALLORY

If they stay, they'll catch you, and

they don't have to catch you---

MOVIE MICKEY

No fuckin' way!

MOVIE MALLORY

Mickey, you're wasting time!

MOVIE MICKEY

I don't give a damn if a million United

States marines, all whistling the halls

of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'

down this alley any second. There

ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm

leaving you. And that's that!

MOVIE MALLORY

Mickey, my love, if you leave me,

they'll catch me and take me to the

hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em

kill you. Then it'd be like I killed

you. I could bear anything, but I

couldn't bear that. So please, please,

for me, my handsome

husband, run for your life.

MOVIE MICKEY

I can't do it. You're my wife, you're

my partner. A fella doesn't run when

his partner can't run with him.

ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

MOVIE MALLORY

Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me

a gun so I can go out shooting.

MOVIE MICKEY

Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little

tougher for 'em.

MOVIE MICKEY

(to himself)

Time to get naked and boogie.

MOVIE MALLORY

Mickey!

MOVIE MICKEY

Yeah baby.

MOVIE MALLORY

You made every day like kindergarten.

MOVIE MICKEY

Mallory!

CUT TO:

WAYNE (O.S.)

Why did you kill Mallory? Both of

them are still alive.

NEIL POPE

It was dramatic license, no doubt. But

I felt an operatic love story needed an

operatic ending. The two of them kill

for each other. They offer the death

of their victims to each other like

other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.

So what more natural, what more

organic, what more poetic than Mallory

offering her death to Mickey? It's

where it's been leading since day one.

We worked it in the movie by using a

what if they escaped situation. I

think it works beautifully. You'd be

surprised. People come up to me at the

end of the movie in tears.

JESSIE

One thing about Mickey for sure, he's

definitely a man who has his moments.

It was wild playin' him. It was one of

those get-it-out-of-your-system

performances.

BUFFY

I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I

didn't play her as a butcher. I played

her as a woman in love, who also

happens to murder people. I didn't

want her to be at arm's length from the

audience or myself. If you play her as

this wild maniac, the audience never

has to deal with her. If you see a

decapitation in a movie, you just say

'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'

Because you can't relate to a

decapitation. It doesn't mean anything

to anybody because it's not personal.

Decapitations don't fall into most

people's realm of life experiences.

But if you show somebody in a movie

getting a paper cut, the whole audience

squirms. Because everybody can relate

to a paper cut.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

BUFFY

I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.

But I read some letters she wrote to

Mickey before the murder spree. They

helped me out a lot.

WAYNE (O.S)

You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?

JESSIE

Yeah, I visited him when he was up in

Susanville. He's a little cerebral for

my taste, but all in all, we got along.

WAYNE (V.O.)

To get a psychiatric view on the

strange attraction Mickey and Mallory

seems to have, we talked with Doctor

Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and

author.

WAYNE

Can you shed some light, Doctor

Reinghold, on why the public has taken

a pair of sociopaths so close to their

bosom?

DR. REINGHOLD

Well, for one, the media has done a

tremendous job of turning the husband

and wife mass murderers into

celebrities. But it's the country's

youth who have turned the couple into

the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,

the very thing that makes them most

lethal is the exact same thing that

captures the public's hearts and

minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic

devotion to each other. In a world

where people can't seem to make the

simplest relationships work and the

slightest emotional commitment is

considered devastating, Mick and

Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a

Shakespearean magnitude. To the

country's youth, 75 percent of which

are coming from broken homes, that's

appealing. They have an 'us against

the world' posture which always appeals

to youth. And they've taken that

posture seventeen steps beyond.

It's not 'us against the world,' it's

'we're gonna kill the world.' They're

exciting. I read their file and I find

myself turning the page like it was a

paperback. Why do disillusioned youths

get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do

disillusioned housewives read romance

novels? Why are you filming this

special? Because you know as well as I

do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles

Manson speaks,' everybody's going to

tune in to hear what he says. Mickey

and Mallory have shocked a country numb

with violence. They've created a world

where only two exist and anybody who

inadvertently enters that world is

murdered.

WAYNE (V.O.)

This attitude from the young towards

their ultimate anti-heroes is nation

wide. And spreading.

LONDON BOY

You take all the great figures from the

States...Elvis, Jack Keroac,

Bukowski, James Dean, Jim Morrison,

Angela Davis, Jack Nicholson, Jim

Thompson, Martin Scorcese...add a

bloody pale of nitro and you got Mickey

and Mallory. They're like rebels

without a cause, except they have a

cause. Only nobody knows what it is.

LONDON GIRL

(screaming)

Their cause is each utter!

TRANSLATOR (V.O.)

Keep the faith, Mickey and Mallory,

keep the faith.

TRANSLATOR (V.O.)

Mickey and Mallory have a love that's

L.A.M.F.

FRENCH BOY

(in English)

They are super cool!

WAYNE

And as to almost give this whole

misplaced admiration scenario a cherry

on the top, the rock band Redd Kross

entered the charts last week at number

13 with their song 'Natural Born

Killers, The Saga of Mickey and

Mallory.'

WAYNE

The third wicked twist to this story is

Grace Mulberry.

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

Of the six teens murdered that night,

seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was

the lucky one left to tell the tale.

And this haunted young lady summoned up

the courage to take the stand, tell

what she saw that horrible night, and

then allow herself to be cross-examined

by the man who killed her brother and

girlfriends.

FEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER

Miss Mulberry! How does it feel to be

the only survivor of Mickey and

Mallory's reign of terror?

FAT MALE REPORTER

Miss Mulberry! Has the experience

marked you?

TRANSIENT

Did ya watch your brother get stabbed

up?

WAYNE

How do you feel about Mickey cross-

examining you?

VOICE (O.S.)

Mickey and Mallory!

WAYNE

Mickey, how do you feel about cross-

examining Grace Mulberry?

MICKEY

I'm keen with anticipation.

FEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER

What do you think of this turn out,

Mallory?

MALLORY

I ain't never had so much fun.

CUTE REPORTER

Do you have any regrets?

MALLORY

Not a one.

MICKEY

Yeah, I always regretted we never got

around to looking up my old history

teacher, Miss Bainbridge. Now there's

a big bad bitch not good for herself or

nobody.

BLACK REPORTER

What's your favorite pastime?

MICKEY

You mean aside from what I'm being

tried for?

MICKEY

Oh, I'd say watching TV.

REPORTERS

What's your favorite show?

MICKEY

'Have Gun Will Travel.'

CUTE REPORTER

Do you have anything to say to your

fans?

MICKEY

(looking in CAMERA)

You ain't seen nothin' yet.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

(to CAMERA)

No, apparently we had not seen

everything. Grace Mulberry gave her

tearful testimony. Then it became

Mickey Knox's turn for cross-

examination.

CUT TO:

BISBING (V.O.)

Grace was terrified of Mickey. You

have to understand most of their

victims were normal people with normal

lives that nothing out of the ordinary

ever happens to.

BISBING (V.O.)

Then out of the blue, they're dealing

with the devil incarnate. It was

extremely difficult for us to find

survivors who would take the stand and

testify when they knew Mickey would be

cross-examining them.

BISBING (V.O.)

Grace was every bit as terrified, every

bit as haunted. But she felt her

brother Tim and her five girlfriends

were counting on her.

CUT TO:

BISBING (O.S.)

No further questions, your honor.

JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)

Would you care to cross examine the

witness, Mr. Knox?

MICKEY (O.S)

As a matter of fact, your honor, I

would.

MICKEY

That's one helluva story, Miss

Mulberry.

GRACE

Yes it is.

MICKEY

Grace...I hope you don't mind if I

call you Grace...

MICKEY

Grace. I'd like to talk to you about

your late brother Tim, if you feel up

to it.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Grace...I hope you don't mind if I

call you Grace...

MALLORY

Naw, she don't mind.

MICKEY

Grace. I'd like to talk to you about

your murdered brother Tim, if you feel

up to it.

CUT TO:

MICKEY (O.S.)

Did you get along?

MICKEY

Miss Mulberry?

GRACE

More or less.

MICKEY

More or less...

MICKEY

What do you mean by that?

GRACE

Well, he's my older brother. When we

were growing up, there were times we

could of very well done without each

other. But when it counted, we were

close.

MICKEY

I'd like to talk about Tim's martial

arts abilities. How long had he been

studying?

GRACE

He started when he was in the seventh

grade, so that would make it nine

years.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MICKEY

When you study the martial arts, they

give out belts that come in different

colors to signify what level you're at

in your training. Am I correct on that

point?

GRACE

Yes you are.

MICKEY

What was the color of Tim's belt?

GRACE

The style of fighting that Tim studied

didn't believe in belts.

MICKEY

Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,

could you tell us what form of martial

arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

GRACE

Tim studied several styles, but his

favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

MICKEY

Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research

on that form of fighting, and I found

out that Jeet Kune Do was a style

developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know

that?

GRACE

Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.

Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting

style.

MICKEY

Now, while I freely admit total

ignorance on the subject, I have heard

of Bruce Lee. And I was under the

impression that Bruce Lee was one of

the, if not

the

greatest fighter in the

history of martial arts.

GRACE

That's what Tim said.

MICKEY

So, I think it would be safe to say

that anybody who studied the fighting

style that Bruce Lee, arguably the

greatest martial artist of all times,

developed for nine years, that would be

a fella who could defend himself.

Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

GRACE

Yes, I would.

MICKEY

Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands

registered as lethal weapons?

GRACE

Yes, they were.

MICKEY

That means his hands are considered a

weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I

correct on that point?

GRACE

Yes, you are.

MICKEY

Yet, in your testimony just now, you

described that Tim...

MICKEY (O.S.)

...kicked me four times in the head.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MICKEY

And his trained martial artists kicks

had little to no effect.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Then, after shrugging off four blows to

the head like I was Superman, I lifted

Tim-nine-years-of-Jeet-Kune-Do-Mulberry

off the ground and threw him across the

room.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Then I took...

MICKEY

...this knife and proceeded to tear him

limb from limb. And this man, whose

hands are lethal weapons---

BISBING

Objection, defence is intimidating the

witness with the murder weapon.

JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)

Sustained. Mr. Knox, put the knife

down.

MICKEY (cont'd)

--had little to no defence.

GRACE

(yelling)

I don't know how you did it, but you

did it!

JUDGE STEINSMA

Mr. Knox! The knife!

MICKEY

How do you think a human being could

possibly be capable of doing something

like that?

GRACE

(yelling)

I don't know!

MICKEY

Now...I don't believe that Grace. I

think you have a definite opinion on

how I was able to do those things you

described. Now, I'm going to ask you

again. And I want you to remember you

are under oath.

MICKEY (O.S.)

In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was

I able to murder you brother Tim

Mulberry in the manner you described.

GRACE

(softly)

You're not human.

GRACE

I thought about it a lot. And the only

thing I could figure is that you're not

human.

GRACE

You're a vampire, or the devil, or a

monster, or cyborg, or something like

that. But you're not human.

MICKEY

(softly)

Thank you. Grace, there is one other

thing...

GRACE

(softly into her lap)

What...

MICKEY

You're right.

MALLORY

Show off.

MICKEY

No further questions your honor.

DEPUTY #1

Light's out Prick.

CUT TO BLACK:

WAYNE (V.O.)

After the deadly brewhaha in the

courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt

Steinsma, passed down a sentence that

was to make legal history.

WAYNE (V.O.)

We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at

his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

WAYNE

Was there any vengeance on your part

with your unique sentence?

JUDGE STEINSMA

Yes, unquestionably. After they did

what they did in my court, and judge

worth his robe will tell you the same

thing. It couldn't help but affect my

decision. That's why they have judges.

We're supposed to be fair to a fault,

but when it's showtime, we have to make

a decision. That's why we don't just

input all the facts into a computer for

the appropriate punishment. I couldn't

give them the death penalty. See,

California hops back and forth on that

issue. Mickey and Mallory went to

court when it was out of favor, which

is actually good because it leaves more

room for imagination. Anybody can give

somebody the chair. When you have

someone who deserves to die and you

can't kill them, you have to be

creative. And if the bastards had let

it stand, it would of been the perfect

sentence. It hit 'em right where they

lived. Far more punishing than the

death sentence.

WAYNE

Would you please describe for our

viewers what your sentence was?

JUDGE STEINSMA

Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,

Mickey and Mallory are very unique.

I've seen a lot of killers in my day

and they're a very cold lot. They have

no more feelings about taking a

person's life than squashing a tiny

bug. It's all the same to them. Well,

Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em

to watch their expression change'

attitude personified. Except with each

other. And, since they lived only for

each other, I wanted to attack that, at

its very root. So, in a nutshell, my

sentence was double life for each

without any possibility for parole.

That would be fairly standard in their

case. The twist I added was that the

husband and wife would have no contact

or correspondence with each other for

the rest of their lives. And they

would never receive any word or

information about the other.

So, basically once the cell door slams

shut, Mickey and Mallory will

completely disappear from each other's

life. They'll never know when the

other dies. But alas, the best laid

plans of mice and men...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

The sentence was never to reach that

point. Because after only a year,

Mickey and Mallory created so much

mayhem that it was decided...

WAYNE (V.O.)

...that they were mentally ill and

needed to be transferred to a state

mental hospital.

CUT TO:

WAYNE (V.O.)

We talked with Dewight McClusky,

chairman of the California State Prison

Board, about this curious turn of

events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

WAYNE

Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved

to an asylum? And who made the

decision?

MCCLUSKY

The prison board made the decision. A

board of which I belong. We're the

who. The why is simple. Mickey and

Mallory are mentally ill and need to be

under a doctor's care, where hopefully

they'll receive the help they need.

WAYNE

Mickey and Mallory were deemed

competent in a mental examination

before their trial. I'm confused.

What's changed?

MCCLUSKY

Well, since that time, they've killed

one person during their trail. And

since their incarceration, they've

killed one psychologist along with

several guards and inmates.

WAYNE

When they were found competent before,

they had already killed fifty people.

Other than the fact they're a

disciplinary problem, which frankly

shouldn't surprise anyone, I still

don't see where this situation is any

different then it was before. So, I

ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's

changed?

MCCLUSKY

What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our

minds. We felt they were competent a

year ago. A year has passed, sir, a

year where they were under close

observation, day in and day out, and

their behaviour has led us to believe we

were wrong.

WAYNE

Who is we?

MCCLUSKY

The prison board and the doctors who

examined them.

WAYNE

Were any of the doctors who made the

first evaluation on the Knoxs mental

state asked to re-examine them?

MCCLUSKY

Using the same doctors is not common

practice.

WAYNE

I take it by your answer it was a whole

new team?

MCCLUSKY

Now that you bring it up, yes. They

were different men. I hadn't really

thought that much about it. Since many

psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,

sought out for this kind of situation.

What do you think normally happens?

The Knoxs are assigned a family

psychologist that takes care of them

throughout the rest of their lives?

The state doesn't work like that.

WAYNE (V.O.)

The two psychiatric opinions the board

sought were those of Albert

Rodriguez...

WAYNE (V.O.)

...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the

good doctors, for whatever reason,

refused to be interviewed.

DR. REINGHOLD

It's a funny situation actually. If

anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give

a damn, what the prison board is doing

would be considered an outrage. The

prison board is basically saying, 'We

can't handle these guys.' They've

moved 'em around twice since their

sentence started.

They were a handful everywhere they

went. Now the prisons they're at now

want them outta there. But no other

prison's gonna be stupid enough to take

'em. So the prison board is left

scratching their heads wondering what

they're gonna do. Well, what they

decided to do was to set up a kangaroo

medical court that found them crazy.

Then they get them transferred to

Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay

as it's referred to in the psychiatric

circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and

electro shock diet, and Mickey and

Mallory cease to be a problem to

anybody except the orderlies who clean

out the bedpans, which if you want to

see them get theirs, that's all well

and good. But there's something being

said here. Forget the immorality for a

second. Forget the corruption and the

skulduggery involved. What the board

is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and

Mallory ran amuck in polite society.

They were put in an alternative society

and they ran amuck there, too. All the

powers that be, can't deal with these

two kids. And whatever can't be

assimilated has to be terminated.

WAYNE

So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory

are not insane?

DR. REINGHOLD

Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace

to living creatures, yes. But to

suggest that they're insane gives the

impression that they don't know right

from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know

the difference between right and wrong.

They just don't give a damn.

WAYNE

Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-

tastic! I think that interview stuff's

too long, we can lose some of that.

Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,

keep the Hun brothers, keep the black

guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the

cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest.

And cut the interview with the prison

board fellow before that. Cut it after

I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was

a whole new team.' Don't even let him

answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me

talking about the two chicken shit

psychiatrists and straight in Dr.

Reinghold laughing.

SCOTT

Okay.

WAYNE

Children, we have a show.

(to Scott & Roger)

You two get some long well overdue

sleep. 'Cause tomorrow, bright and

early, county jail and then journey's

end...Mickey Knox.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

There's this Italian guy, a French guy,

and a Polish guy. And they're all

talkin' about how they fuck their

wives---

MICKEY

...You know, I'm gonna just rip off

your dress and squeeze your titties.

Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out

her .357, sticks it in the Big Bad

Wolf's face and says, 'No you're not.

You're gonna eat me...just like the

story says.'

MICKEY

(with a lisp)

...Fairy boat! I knew things were

good in here, but I didn't know we had

our own Navy.

MICKEY

...So this guy wants to take little

Johnny's sister to the drive-in. But

the mother says, 'Only if you take

little Johnny along---'

MICKEY

...And the Polish guy says, 'That's

nothing. When I get through with my

Hanna, I get up, wipe my dick on the

curtain, and she hits the roof!'

MICKEY

No...please...thank you...you're

too kind...no...please...

WAYNE

(with mouthful of donut)

How's it working, Scotty?

SCOTT (O.S.)

Perfecto!

ROGER

Where the fuck's the chocolate cream

filled? Did anyone get my chocolate

cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

ROGER

I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.

You saw me do it, didn't you?

WAYNE

You were there. Did you see him put it

in a box?

ROGER

At the time, I was too busy explaining

to Scott the finer points of film.

SCOTT (O.S.)

Yeah, right. You know what he said?

He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple

Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

WAYNE

(to Roger)

You can't be serious?

ROGER

(preoccupied)

I'm as serious about that as I am about

going back to the donut store, and

dipping that stupid Mexican's head into

the batter for forgetting my chocolate

cream filled. Gimme that other box.

WAYNE

Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

ROGER

That dumbass probably put my chocolate

cream filled in there by mistake.

WAYNE

Roger, no.

ROGER

What's the big deal? Take out my

chocolate cream filled, put one of

these roasted coconut---

WAYNE

Roger, do you understand what the word

'no' means? It's important we

establish a rapport. Something as

simple as a dozen donuts can mean the

world to somebody who hasn't had a

donut in a year.

ROGER

So you're giving a man who butchers

whole families, little babies included,

my chocolate cream filled?

WAYNE

Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County

Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

ROGER

Wayne---

WAYNE

Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.

Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and

gather your gear.

WAYNE

(aside to Scott)

Here's the welcome wagon.

WURLITZER

Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.

We talked on the phone. It's a

pleasure to meet you.

WAYNE

Same here. Let me introduce my crew.

Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie

...this is...I'm sorry. What's

your title again?

WURLITZER

I'm the superintendent here at L.A.

County Jail. Me and my deputies are

who you'll be working with while you're

here.

WAYNE

That sounds great. Look, I don't want

any of this to intimidate you. This is

not going to be a big deal. This is

going to be very easy.

(to his crew)

I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You

guys get your equipment ready, power up

the van and confirm a transmission code

for the remote. Julie come with me.

WAYNE

The main thing I need is a big room,

shut off from the population, so we can

get some privacy...with a few

electrical outlets.

WURLITZER

(to two Deputies)

This is just for an interview, I was

on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.

It was a much bigger deal than this.

They had a crew of maybe seventy-five

people.

WAYNE

We're gonna be talking over here. But

I want enough freedom so if I wanna get

up and move around, we can.

WAYNE

Take him and walk him over this way.

(pretending Scott's

Mickey)

So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,

what the hell was that all about?

(pauses--to Scott)

Then maybe take him to the window.

WAYNE

(pretending Scott's

Mickey)

So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail

today, what's the first thing you'd do?

(pause--to Scott)

Little shit like that. I don't wanna

have to feel I gotta stay in the

chairs. We're after a cinema verite,

anything can happen, truth twenty-four

times a second kindda feel.

WURLITZER

And when it's lunch time, they don't

just go to McDonalds. They got cooks

there servin' great food. Swedish

meatballs...

WURLITZER

How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

WAYNE

Everything's coming along just fine.

Phil, I wanted to know if I could have

a small word with you.

WURLITZER

By all means.

WAYNE

You met the kids I have working for me?

Great bunch, aren't they?

WURLITZER

Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

WAYNE

Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,

magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I

could sooner do without my arm than

Unruly Julie.

WURLITZER

Is that her real name?

WAYNE

Just a little nickname. Yep, they're

my kids and they're all I need. After

working together these past coupla

years, we're like well-oiled machinery.

No, more like a Formula race car. No,

scratch that one, too. What we're

really like is a Swiss watch. Small,

intricate, compact...it shouldn't

work as well as it does, but it does.

Because of the craftsmanship, the

expertise, and the artist's loving

hand.

WURLITZER

I see.

WAYNE

Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever

been on a set before---

WURLITZER

(proudly)

Ya know, I was.

WAYNE

(acting surprised)

Really?

WURLITZER

I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set

about eight years ago.

WAYNE

(still acting surprised)

Well...small world. Well, then, you

know firsthand how Hollywood does

things. Lights all over the place,

generators, a hundred and fifty crew

members---

WURLITZER

Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there

was probably ninety-five people there,

maybe more.

WAYNE

See what I mean? It's a funny

business, isn't it?

WURLITZER

It sure is.

WAYNE

They got a asshole over here.

(pointing to his left)

A asshole sitting down reading a

magazine over there.

(points to his right)

A asshole perched up there.

(points straight up)

Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we

were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang

stuff we'd need all those assholes,

too. What we're about is intimacy.

We're about two people having a

conversation. Say I was interviewing

you. All I want you to worry about is

what I ask you. I want a trust to

develop. If you're thinking about all

this...

(indicates the hustle and

bustle of a set)

...you're not going to relax, a trust

won't develop, we'll be talking a each

other instead of to each other, there

will be no chance for intimacy.

WAYNE

That's why my crew is only three...an

invisible three.

(switching gears)

Which brings me to what I wanted to

talk to you about. I have to get

Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to

share what he's never shared before...

Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till

today have been closed. Well, how can

we expect him to do that when we got

Los Angeles County Sheriffs up

the walls.

WURLITZER

(snorts)

Well, just what the hell do you expect

me to do?

WAYNE

Lose 'em.

WURLITZER

Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest

idea how dangerous Knox is?

WAYNE

Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very

familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

WURLITZER

Since he and his wife have been in

custody, they've killed---

WAYNE

Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure

I know 'em better than you do.

WURLITZER

Well, let me let you in on one more fact you

obviously don't know. If I were to

take my men away, Mickey Knox would

snap your neck like a twig.

WAYNE

One...I can take care of myself. I

grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and

I've handled some pretty rough

customers in my day. Mickey Knox

doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a

journalist, and I'm prepared to take

that risk. Three...it ain't gonna

happen. Believe me when I tell you, it

is in Mickey Knox's own best interest

to play this game according to Hoyle.

(pause)

Wait a minute. We've gotten into a

advisory relationship here, which is

not what I want.

(pause)

But seriously, Phil, look at this.

WAYNE

(counting)

We got one...two...three...four

...five...six...seven...eight.

I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too

much. Let's lose some of these guys.

WURLITZER

Wayne, if it was anybody else---

WAYNE

Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam

up on me with all these sheriffs all

over the place. They hate him. He

hates them. What kinda intimacy am I

gonna create with all this hate in the

air. Even you and I feel it.

WURLITZER

What are we talking about?

WAYNE

Two guys?

WURLITZER

Okay. I'll take two guys off.

WAYNE

No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two

guys.

WURLITZER

I can't do that. Five guys.

WAYNE

Three.

WURLITZER

I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but

that's it.

DEPUTY #1

On your feet! Turn your face to the

wall.

MICKEY

Now what you're supposed to say is:

'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

CUT TO:

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

Rise and shine, Mallory!

SCAGNETTI

Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

CUT TO:

SCAGNETTI

It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long

and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

SCAGNETTI

See, I've been there twice. And I'm

not lookin' forward to goin' back. But

I'm in and out. You, on the other

hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the

rest of your life there. Now that's

what I call cruel and inhuman

punishment.

SCAGNETTI

Course you're not gonna give a shit.

'Cause when the good doctor's get

through givin' you the zap...

(he puts his finger next

to his temple, pantomimes

being electrocuted)

...You won't know where the hell you

are. They'll just put you on a window

sill, and water you every other day.

WAYNE

(to his crew)

And when he gets here, its no dick'n

around time. Make him up, clip a mike

on him, then leave him alone. I don't

want you talking to him. I don't want

you getting in his face. I want you

hiding behind your gear. You are

invisible.

WAYNE

(to his crew)

Okay, break.

WURLITZER

Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

MICKEY

(to Wayne)

Okay now, before we get started here,

there's a few things we have to get

clear about.

WAYNE

All right, Mickey.

MICKEY

Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

BINGHAM

Turn around and face the wall!

SCAGNETTI

Wait outside for a second, fellas.

BINGHAM

We're not supposed---

SCAGNETTI

Don't worry about it.

SCAGNETTI

Want a smoke?

SCAGNETTI

C'mon, I already lit one for you. I

know you smoke.

SCAGNETTI

I was reading the file on you. You

know what it said during your

trial, whenever they put you on the

stand, no matter what they asked, your

answer was always the same...'I love

Mickey.' It also says that when they

gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'

was the only thing you said that

registered as the truth.

SCAGNETTI

Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky

Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your

Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is

that the attraction? Or does he just

got a big dick?

SCAGNETTI

That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a

big donkey dick.

SCAGNETTI

Can you remember the last time you

fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is

close your eyes and remember...

remember the last time ol' Mickey gave

you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'

about it? Good. Remember it. Don't

ever forget it cause it ain't never

gonna happen again. Cause when they

get through with all that electroshock

shit they got lined up for you two,

Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

SCAGNETTI

Look. You're gonna sit here for a

couple hours while I finish up the

arrangements. The reason they picked

me to be your chaperone is they know I

won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.

SCAGNETTI

So, during our journey, if any wild

hairs spring up on your ass, you'd

better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with

me, bitch, even a little bit, you're

gonna get accidentally shot!

Comprehende?

SCAGNETTI

She broke my fucking nose! That bitch

broke my nose!

SCAGNETTI

(blood down his face)

She broke my nose.

WASHINGTON

I'll fix it.

SCAGNETTI

Hold her, boys.

SCAGNETTI

I want this filled before we leave.

MICKEY

(to Unruly Julie)

How come you never talk?

ROGER

She was born without a tongue.

MICKEY

(repulsed)

Oh my God!

(to Unruly Julie)

Sorry.

WAYNE

So we got a deal. Four deputies---

WURLITZER

And me.

WAYNE

Why don't we make it three deputies and

you?

WURLITZER

Why don't I have Mickey thrown back

into his cell and we can forget the

whole thing?

WAYNE

Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and

you, I can live with that. We're about

ready to go here, so let's get rid of

these other assholes.

WURLITZER

Don't call my men assholes.

WAYNE

I didn't mean they were assholes. I

mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta

here.

WAYNE

Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of

these assholes. Now I want to create

the illusion that this is just Mickey

and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.

So make sure you don't film these

assholes. I don't want to see 'em on

film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'

slated our spot as human interest which

means we'll go live at just after

five-thirty.

WURLITZER

This asshole's tryin' to tell me what

I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!

This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's

dealin' with here, but we do. And if

shit happens, he ain't gonna be

responsible, we are. So keep your

shotguns out, your fingers on the

triggers, and be ready to fire at a

moment's notice.

ROGER

Say something.

MICKEY

(mouthful of donut)

What?

ROGER

Anything.

MICKEY

(talking in rhyme)

I stand amid the roar

Of a surf tormented shore,

As I hold within my hand

Grains of the golden sand--

How few! yet how they creep

Through my fingers to the deep,

While I weep--while I weep!

O God! can I not save

One from the pitiless wave?

Is all that we see or seem

But a dream within a dream?

MICKEY

(mouthful of donut)

How was that?

ROGER

Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment

here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n

roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the

donut place put a chocolate cream

filled I asked for in your box.

MICKEY

There's a chocolate cream filled in

there?

ROGER

Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

MICKEY

Tough titty, it's mine now.

ROGER

Look, I'll trade you.

WAYNE

Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!

What did I tell you. Stop bothering

Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

ROGER

(to himself)

Fine. Roger, what the hell are you

doing? You're bothering the serial

killer.

WAYNE

Sorry about that.

MICKEY

Don't worry about it.

WAYNE

We're about ready to go here. Are you

ready?

MICKEY

Let's do it.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Okay people! Let's start to settle

down here.

CUT TO:

WAYNE (O.S.)

Are you comfortable?

WAYNE (O.S.)

Roger?

ROGER (O.S.)

Rockin'!

WAYNE (O.S.)

Scotty?

SCOTT (O.S.)

Rollin'...and speed!

WAYNE (O.S.)

Slate it.

WAYNE

So, Mickey, tell us what you do for

fun.

MICKEY

Aside from the obvious?

WAYNE

(not amused)

Yes. Aside from the obvious.

Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

MICKEY

Okay, let me see now. What do I do for

fun?

(to people O.S.)

Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are

drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.

(to camera)

Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just

sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies

smokin' up a storm, and it's really

doin' it to me.

MICKEY

Much obliged. What do I do for fun?

Do you want to know what I do for fun

or what I did for fun?

WAYNE

What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun

for starters.

MICKEY

What I did for fun for starters.

(thinking)

Well, something I used to do...always

was a lot of fun...

(pause)

No, scratch that. Let me think of

something else. In fact, why don't we

come back to that question. Ask me

something else.

WAYNE

Do you miss Mallory?

MICKEY

Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my

wife. I haven't seen her in a long

time. What a stupid question.

WAYNE

Then was it worth it?

MICKEY

Was what worth it?

WAYNE

Was massacring all those people worth

being separated from your wife for the

rest of your life?

MICKEY

Do you think up these questions or the

girl with no tongue?

WAYNE

No, Mickey, I can't let you get away

with that shit. Answer the question.

Was it worth it? You haven't seen,

heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.

Was it worth it?

MICKEY

Was an instant of purity worth a

lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

WAYNE

Excuse me, did you say an instant of

purity? What was the instant of

purity? The bodies you left behind on

your bloody trail?

MICKEY

That's only part of it. I mean, it's a

big, big, big part. But it's only the

chorus, it's not the whole song.

WAYNE

(passionately)

Please explain to me, Mickey, where's

the purity that you couldn't live

without in five year old Danny

Millhouse's blown off head? Where's

the purity in forty-eight people who

are no longer on this planet because

they met you and Mallory? What's so

fucking pure about that?

MICKEY

Where the purity comes into play---

SCOTT (V.O.)

Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

WAYNE (V.O.)

Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that

thought. Reload, quick!

MALLORY

(singing)

Love is a hurtin' thang,

and it leaves a fiery sting.

SCOTT (V.O.)

Okay. Okay, we're up again.

WAYNE (V.O.)

Roll it. Save the slate.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

You just said an instant of purity was

preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't

understand. What's so pure about

forty-eight dead bodies?

MICKEY

You'll never understand. Me and you,

Wayne, we're not even the same species.

I used to be you...then I evolved.

From where you're standing, you're a

man. From where I'm standing, you're a

ape. I'm here...I'm right here...

and you...you're somewhere else, man.

You say why? I say why not?

WAYNE

Tell me about the purity.

MICKEY

(laughing)

It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and

a smoke only get you so far. You're

gonna have to do your job.

WAYNE

(laughs)

Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll

move on and come back later.

MICKEY

I'm sure we will.

WAYNE

Describe Mallory.

MICKEY

Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,

she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two

feet, two hands, ten fingers...

WAYNE

Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You

know what I mean. Describe Mallory.

(points at his head)

What's up here?

(points at his heart)

What's in here?

MICKEY

That's indescribable.

WAYNE

Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do

you feel about the fact that you're

never gonna see Mallory again?

MICKEY

(smiles)

Says who?

WAYNE

Says the United States of America.

MICKEY

(laughs)

When have they ever been right?

MICKEY

Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

MICKEY

...one night I was asleep, and a noise

wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,

somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a

gun, so I go into the living room with

a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned

out to be nothing. God made the noise.

Who knows?

SCAGNETTI

(whispers)

How's it goin'?

WURLITZER

(whispers)

Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

WURLITZER

What the hell happened to you?

SCAGNETTI

You should see the other bitch. What

time you got?

WURLITZER

Two-thirty. Shhh...

MICKEY

But I came to the direction I need a

gun. Do, the next day I started off

early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a

gun shop and pick up a little home

protection. I walked into the place

and had never seen so many guns in all

my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the

this really nice sales guy comes up to

me. His name was Warren. I'll never

forget his name. He was really nice.

Anyway, Warren showed me all these

different models of guns. Magnums,

automatics, pistols, Walters. And I

ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a

Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon

as I held that baby in my hands, I knew

what I was gonna do. It felt so good.

It felt like it was a part of me. They

had a mirror in the store. I looked at

myself holding it, and looked so

fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.

Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.

Turned my car around, drove to

Mallory's house, we took care of

Mallory's parents, packed up the car,

and we were off.

DISSOLVE TO:

MICKEY

Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The

cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,

they all missed the point of the story.

I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding

the shotgun, it all became clear. I

realized for the first time my one true

calling in life. I'm a natural born

killer.

WAYNE

Okay, let's cut it.

WAYNE

(to Scott)

Did ya get that?

SCOTT

It's gonna be beautiful.

WAYNE

Super cool.

(to Mickey)

This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

MICKEY

I could go for a Coke.

WAYNE

(yelling)

Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

WURLITZER

I'm not running out and getting that

piece of shit a Coke.

WAYNE

Fine.

(to Unruly Julie)

Julie, why don't you make a food run?

(to the room)

What's around here?

DEPUTY SHERIFF

There's an In and Out Burgers about a

block away on Olive. It's walking

distance.

WAYNE

Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.

I'll have a double double with cheese,

french fries, and a large Coke.

WURLITZER

Are you all set?

SCAGNETTI

Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready

to roll.

WURLITZER

I assigned you Bingham and Washington

to go along.

SCAGNETTI

Yeah, we met. They're good men.

WURLITZER

They're real Goddamn good. They'll be

there for when ya need 'em. Where

are they?

SCAGNETTI

Waitin' in the lounge.

WURLITZER

How 'bout Mallory?

SCAGNETTI

Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

SCAGNETTI

Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

WURLITZER

Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

DEPUTY SHERIFF

Capt'n!

WURLITZER

Yeah?

DEPUTY SHERIFF

They need you. Emergency!

WURLITZER

(into phone)

Talk to me.

(pause)

Where?

(pause)

For the love of Pete...okay...okay

...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on

my way.

WURLITZER (O.S.)

I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a

riot going on in the laundry room.

DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)

Is it serious?

WURLITZER (O.S.)

It sure as hell is. They got guns,

hostages, and explosives.

WURLITZER (O.S.)

Jack, could you stay up here for a

while?

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)

Yeah, sure.

WURLITZER (O.S.)

I'm taking one of these men. Yates,

come with me.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Could we go with you and film it?

WURLITZER (O.S.)

Stay up here and finish your interview,

I've got to see what the hell's going

on down there before I can take

responsibility for you to film there.

MICKEY

I'll have a four by four. That's four

patty burgers. Now they don't have

that on the menu, but if you order a

four by four, they'll know what you're

talking about. A large Coke and two

orders of fries.

FADE TO BLACK:

MICKEY

You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

WAYNE (O.S.)

Sure.

MICKEY

Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty

funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now

in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.

And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks

her mother if she can go out on a date.

MICKEY

The mother asks, 'Where's he taking

you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in

movie.' The mother tells her she can

only go if she takes Little Johnny with

her. She says okay. They go to the

drive-in, they come back. The mother

gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,

what happened? Where did ya go?'

MICKEY

Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What

did they do?'

MICKEY

'They kissed. What else?'

MICKEY

'He felt her up? What else?'

MICKEY

(dumbfounded)

'They took off their clothes? What

else?'

MICKEY

'They did it? What were you doing?'

MICKEY

Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

SCAGNETTI

Slide the shotgun over here, put your

hands behind your head, put your

forehead on the floor.

MICKEY

Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow

you in half and you know it.

SCAGNETTI

I've never wounded anything in my life.

I got you locked right between the eyes.

MICKEY

If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'

you in half on three. So, if you got

me locked, take the shot. One...

MICKEY (O.S.)

Two...

MICKEY

Three!

SCAGNETTI

Hold it! Don't shoot!

MICKEY

Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

MICKEY

Toss it.

MICKEY

Now put your hands behind your head.

MICKEY

Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

SCAGNETTI

What?

MICKEY

You guys stay on your bellies.

ROGER

Yes, sir.

MICKEY

I am the most dangerous man in the

world.

MICKEY

(points at Scagnetti)

You're the law.

(points at himself)

I'm the law breaker.

MICKEY

Donut, get your camera. See if it's

broke.

WAYNE

Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

MICKEY

Scott's dead. And unless you wanna

play follow the leader, shut up and do

as you're told.

MICKEY

How is it?

ROGER

Not good.

MICKEY

Do you have a back up.

ROGER

It's video.

MICKEY

Even better. Wayne call your station,

tell 'em we're going live a little

early today. Make it happen!

CUT TO BLACK:

WURLITZER

I want two men stationed in that tier,

and I want men with rifles all along

the walkway.

PITNEY (O.S.)

Capt'n!

PITNEY (O.S.)

Here's the layout of the laundry room.

WURLITZER

Where do the air ducts lead?

PITNEY (O.S.)

Here.

SMITHY (O.S.)

Problem is they'll hear somebody

approaching that way.

PITNEY (O.S.)

We turned off the power when they took

over the room.

WURLITZER

We turn it back on. The machines go

back on supplying us with the cover

noise we need. Smithy, do it.

SMITHY (O.S.)

Right away, Capt'n.

WURLITZER

Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

JONESY (O.S.)

Yes.

WURLITZER

You sure?

JONESY (O.S.)

I think--

WURLITZER

Never say you think when you know, or

you know when you think.

WURLITZER

(into walkie talkie)

Bergman, you in place?

BERGMAN (O.S.)

(from walkie talkie)

Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

WURLITZER

(into walkie talkie)

Pass this to your team...the second

they get a lock on a blue, they're to

take the shot. Do you understand?

BERGMAN (O.S.)

(from walkie talkie)

That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

WURLITZER

What do you think, Pitney? How much

Explosives do you think that they

really have in there?

PITNEY (O.S.)

It's hard to say Capt'n.

WURLITZER

Take a wild stab!

PITNEY (O.S.)

I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

WURLITZER

The entire wing?

PITNEY (O.S.)

That's my opinion.

WURLITZER

Jesus...

CUT TO:

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

We interrupt this program to bring you a

Special Report.

CHAVEZ

Good afternoon, I'm Tony Chavez and

this is a KKTV Special Report. At this

moment we are receiving preliminary

reports of a hostage--

(fingering earphone)

I...I'm sorry. I'm being told that

we're now taking you live to L.A.

County Jail where Wayne Gayle is

standing by.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from

the Los Angeles County Jail, where you

can tell from the bloody carnage behind

me that the final chapter in the book

called Mickey and Mallory has not yet

been written.

MICKEY

Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie

just underwent a title change. It's

now called 'The Escape of Mickey and

Mallory.' Starring me, you, Mallory,

and special guest accomplice, Jack-

fucked-up-fingers-Scagnetti.

(into CAMERA)

Okay, Donut, move in for a close up. I

want this for prosperity.

MICKEY (O.S.)

Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin'

Mallory? I know she's still here, and

I know you know where. So, start

talking or my first work as a director

will be your death scene.

SCAGNETTI

(slightly out of it)

She's in the holding cell, on this

floor.

MICKEY (O.S.)

You're taking us to that holding cell

now.

(into CAMERA)

All right, Cut!

CUT TO:

CHAVEZ

Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have

just tuned in, it appears that a

hostage situation involving Mickey Knox

is developing presently at the Los

Angeles County Jail. We have seen that

he is armed and apparently there has

been some loss of life. We will try to

re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle

and bring you more on this late

breaking story. Please stay tuned.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

This has been a KKTV Special Report.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.

Stand behind me, put your back against

mine and extend your arms behind you.

MICKEY

Now if I feel your back move away from

mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.

Got it?

SCAGNETTI

Yeah.

MICKEY

Okay, Wayne, step forward.

MICKEY

Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus

against the barrel.

MICKEY

Grab his arms.

MICKEY

Either one of you two move, it's gonna

be shotgun city. You understand?

WAYNE & SCAGNETTI

Yes.

MICKEY

You ready, Donut?

ROGER

Ready.

MICKEY

Wagons, hooaaa!

MALLORY

(singing)

Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha

dodaleedo, dodaleedo.

Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha

dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing

there isn't much to it.

All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I

like the rest,

but the best part I like is

Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo,

dodaleedo, do

quack, quack.

MICKEY

(to Mallory)

Honey, I'm home.

MALLORY

(in between kisses)

It's taken you so long to come to me.

CUT TO:

BAILEY (O.S.)

Here's the list of the rioters.

WURLITZER

Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the

list of the hostages?

BAILEY (O.S.)

I'm working on it Capt'n.

WURLITZER

Keep on it, son.

WURLITZER

(reading the names)

Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,

Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,

Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

NAPALATONI (O.S.)

Capt'n.

WURLITZER

What is it Napalatoni?

NAPALATONI (O.S.)

Mickey Knox is loose.

WURLITZER

What do you mean he's loose?

NAPALATONI (O.S.)

He's armed, he's killed three deputies

and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the

moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox

in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,

another TV guy, that cop fella, and two

other deputies as hostages. And

Capt'n, they have one of them news

cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't

stop playin' it. What do you want us

to do?

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Okay, we're going out that door, and

we're gonna march down the hall and

right out of the building.

(to Wayne)

Donut said something about a news van.

WAYNE

Yeah, we have a van.

MICKEY

Where's it parked?

WAYNE

Out front.

MICKEY

Let me have the keys.

WAYNE

Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

MICKEY

No.

WAYNE

This is crazy. You can't escape like

this.

MICKEY

Probably not, but we're gonna give it

the old college try.

WAYNE

We'll all be killed.

MALLORY

Exciting, isn't it?

MICKEY

Now, when we get out there, you do what

we say or it's curtains. If we say

move, you move. If we say left, you

move left. If we say right, you move

right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.

Got it?

MALLORY

Are we in a big hurry?

MICKEY

You got something you want to do?

MALLORY

Yeah.

MICKEY

By all means, knock yourself out.

MALLORY

Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

MALLORY

You! Stand up!

MALLORY

You probably thought it was pretty

funny, didn't ya?

MALLORY

Can you remember the last time you

fucked with me? Close your eyes and

remember...Are ya thinking about it?

Good.

DUNCAN (O.S.)

Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

MICKEY

We're sending out a hostage. Don't

touch him!

MALLORY

Mickey!

MICKEY

Don't stop!

ROGER (O.S.)

Man, oh, man...this is better than

Vietnam!

DUNCAN

Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

MICKEY (O.S.)

Get the camera! Get the fucking

camera!

MICKEY

(to Mallory)

This way.

MICKEY

(to Duncan)

Where does this lead?

MICKEY

Where!?!

DUNCAN

Th-- the ground floor.

MALLORY

Is that the front door?

MICKEY

Let's go.

MALLORY

Back off or I'll blast him! Back off

or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll

blast him!

WAYNE

Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!

Please, please, please...

WURLITZER

Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

MALLORY

Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna

hear it!

WURLITZER

You have to know---

MALLORY

I said shut up...

MALLORY

...and I mean shut up!

CUT TO:

MICKEY

Think...think...think...

WURLITZER (O.S.)

Give up! There's no other way out!

MALLORY

Look, lover boy, we're not getting

outta here. So I say the hell with

going back to our cells. Let's do a

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Run down these stairs shootin', go out

in a hail of bullets, but take as many

of those motherfuckers with us as

possible.

MICKEY

We'll do that when all else fails.

MALLORY

Hasn't it?

MICKEY

We still got a few tricks up our

sleeves.

MICKEY

You married?

DUNCAN

Oh, I don't wanna die...

MICKEY

Are you married? Do you have kids?

MICKEY

Good. People, we're goin' all the way

to the front door. Now, the only way

we're gonna get there is if they don't

want to kill you two more than they

want to kill us.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Right now I find that highly unlikely.

So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

MICKEY

Now, say I tell those guys down there

if they shoot or make a move, I'm

killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or

make a move anyway. Now say by some

freak accident, you didn't die, you

live though it. What would you do?

WAYNE

What would I do? Me and my network

would sue the entire Los Angeles County

Sheriffs Department for flagrantly

disregarding my safety. I'd go

straight to my buddy, the mayor, and

make sure everyone of those son of a

bitches down there ends up on the

unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue

every man down there personally. I

would make it my life's ambition to

bring the LA County Jail to its knees.

I would do expose after expose on the

brutality, and the conditions, and the

inhumanity that exists here.

MICKEY

That's what I thought. You tell them

that. When we go down those stairs, I

want you to scream what you just told

me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the

star of American Maniacs watched every

week by'-- how many people?

WAYNE

On average forty million.

MICKEY

'Every week by forty million people. I

am a respected journalist.' Have you

won any awards?

WAYNE

Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The

Edward R. Murrow award...

MICKEY

'Respected journalist'-- On your

knees...

MICKEY

(continues)

...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the

Edward R. Murrow award among others.'

Tell 'em the name of your personal

lawyer, his firm, his address, and

phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor

and the unemployment lines. You

getting the idea?

WAYNE

Yes.

MICKEY

Say it. Scream it. All the way out

the front door and into your van. And

if you stop screaming, I swear to God

I'll blow your head off.

WAYNE

Got it.

MICKEY

You! What's your name?

MALLORY

Duncan...Homolka?

CUT TO:

MICKEY (O.S.)

Start.

WAYNE

(yelling)

My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star

of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty

million people every week! I am a

respected journalist, winners of the

Golden Globe, the Edward R.

Murrows Award among others! If anybody

puts me in danger, my network will sue

The Los Angeles County Sheriffs

Department. My estate will sue every

officer personally who fires. The

network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis

and Sinclair...

MALLORY

(yelling)

Make a path!

WURLITZER

How far do you think your gonna get?

MICKEY

Right out the front door.

WURLITZER

That'll never happen.

MICKEY

It is happening.

MALLORY

Don't stop!

WURLITZER

(to Mickey)

I will personally hunt you down, blow

the head off your fucking-whore-wife,

and plant your sick ass in the ground

all by myself.

MICKEY

(calmly)

Another day perhaps, but not today.

CUT TO:

WAYNE

This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and

my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.

This may be out of sync 'cause we are

shooting with a wild camera and a

standard recorder we found in the van.

Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked

out the front door, into my news van

and made our getaway. When we were

followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox

killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka

and tossed his body out of the back.

Mickey told authorities over my police

band that I would surely be next if

they didn't give up the pursuit. They

took Mickey at his word and called off

the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't

employed, I don't know. My only

thought is it all happened too fast for

arrangements to be made. We've just

pulled off to the side of the road to

do this interview. Tensions run high--

MICKEY (O.S.)

We ain't got all fuckin' day!

WAYNE

Without any further ado, Mickey and

Mallory...

WAYNE

Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's

plan? Did you think it would work?

MALLORY

It wasn't 'till we got on the ground

floor that I totally realized they

weren't gonna shoot unless we shot

first. When we got out of the

stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my

God. This might work.' But

Mickey knew it would work all along.

There wasn't any doubt in his mind.

It's not like there was and he just

didn't show it. He knew it would work.

WAYNE (O.S.)

What did you think then?

MALLORY

I wondered how long it would be before

we'd get to be alone together. And I

wondered if I could wait that long.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Did you have anything to do with the

riot in the laundry room?

MALLORY

Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'

word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can

I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

WAYNE (O.S.)

Try to keep it to a minimum.

MALLORY

We had nothing to do with that riot.

That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

MICKEY

Divine intervention.

MALLORY

What he said. We didn't know jack shit

about and riot. It just happened. It

was kismet. We didn't even know those

people. How are we supposed to

organize a riot when we've been in

fuckin' isolation for the past year?

Just bleep out the fucks and jack

shits.

(laughs)

I mean, it's not like we care. If they

wanna say we masterminded the whole

thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep

us up at night. But you said you

wanted the truth, and the truth is we

were just lucky.

MICKEY

C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

WAYNE (O.S.)

So, what now?

MALLORY

Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take

it easy. Just enjoy each other's

company, stop and smell the roses,

notice the color purple, stuff like

that.

WAYNE (O.S.)

How do you intend to disappear? you're

probably the most famous couple in

America.

MALLORY

Well, back in slave times they had a

thing called the underground railroad.

And we got a whole fan club out there

just waiting to be conductors.

(to the camera)

So, you kids out there, keep the faith.

Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'

to your town real soon.

MICKEY

Okay, that's enough. End of interview.

We gotta move.

WAYNE (O.S.)

Okay, just let me swing around and film

myself asking the questions. And then

I'll do my little wrap up.

MICKEY

Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,

all right. But it won't be you starin'

in the camera, looking dumb, and acting

stupid. Instead, you're gonna be

starin' down the barrels of our

shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the

triggers.

WAYNE

That's a joke right?

WAYNE

Just wait one fucking minute.

MICKEY

I said I'd give you a interview. Now

unless I'm mistaken, we just did a

interview.

(to Mallory)

We did an interview, didn't we?

MALLORY

Looked like an interview to me.

MICKEY

I said we'd give you an interview. I

never said we wouldn't kill you.

WAYNE

Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt

during this...this whole escape that

a kind of bond--

WAYNE

(continues)

...developed between the three of

us. We're kindda in this together,

don't ya think?

MICKEY

No. Not really.

WAYNE

Don't touch those triggers! Please. I

think I've already proven that a live

Wayne Gayle is much more better that a

dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your

passport out of jail, not Duncan

Homolka. But me! I'll be your

passport outta---

MICKEY

Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate

you. If anybody in the fuckin' world

deserves to die, it's you.

WAYNE

Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and

Mallory always leave somebody alive to

tell the tale.

MICKEY

We are.

(points to camera)

Your camera.

MICKEY

(John Wayne voice)

Let's make a little music, Colorada.

WAYNE

NO!!!
