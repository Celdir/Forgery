nd so the ROUTINE BUILDS ... ANN and HARRY singing and dancing

Crash cut:

ANNY

That's a funny one! Isn't that

funnier?

HARRY

It's hysterical, Manny. As long as

we're laughing we won't be crying over

the box office. Talk about depressing.

ANN

Twenty girls in feather boas prancing

around like circus ponies! That's

depressing!

MAUDE

(fondly)

I love a good chorus line!

TAPS

What's this?

ANN

It's a play.

3.

MANNY

Who wrote it, Annie?

TAPS

Some guy - Driscoll.

reading the jacket of book)

From the Federal Theatre.

AUDE

Don't knock it, honey - at least they

get an audience.

ANN

It'll pick up .... Ain't that right,

Manny?

ANN (cont'd)

(trailing off)

It always does.

MANNY

The trick is to start the build right

at the back of your throat...

(sneezing comically)

Works well out through the nose too.

ANN

Have you eaten today?

MANNY

(sheepish)

Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about

me.

ANN

Hey - you're all I've got.

ANN (cont'd)

Come on - take me to dinner.

MANNY

You think the kitchen'll still be open

on Third?

4.

ANN

Soup and biscuits - perfect.

Cut to:

ANN

(calling out to Harry)

Hey! Harry, what's going on?

ANN(cont'd)

Hey, open up! We work here.

LADDER MAN

Not anymore.

MAUDE

(calling at some WORKMEN)

It's all right for you! We haven't had

a pay check in two weeks - how we

going to eat?

ANN

They're not going to get away with

this.

LOSE ON: MAUDE looks bleakly at ANN ...

AUDE

They just did.

MANNY (O.S.)

Ann ... Annie! It's no use.

ANNY (cont'd)

The show it's over - it's done.

'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm

going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ...

5.

MANNY (cont'd)

I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were

small people have been letting you

down. But you gotta think of yourself

now. You should try out for that part.

MANNY (cont'd)

It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I

know what you're thinking - every time

you reach out for something you care

about ... fate comes along and

snatches it away.

MANNY (cont'd)

But not this time, Annie ... not this

time.

LOSE ON: ANN as she digests MANNY'S words ... the LOUD rumble

ANN

(faux nonchalance)

Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!

WESTON

Oh, Jeez ...

WESTON (cont'd)

Look, Miss ... I told you already;

call my office - leave your resume

with my secretary.

ANN

Why would I want to do that when we

can talk about it in person?

WESTON

Because that's what a smart girl would

do.

ANN

But I already sent you my resume - you

returned it unopened.

6.

WESTON

What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very

particular about who he works with.

ANN

Please, just an audition - that's all

I'm asking.

WESTON

esus - you don't give up, do you?

ANN

Mr. Weston, I know this role

backwards.

ESTON

ell, that's too bad - because we just

gave the part to someone else. Sorry,

kid - the play is cast.

WESTON (cont'd)

Look - I know times are tough. You

want my advice? Use what you got.

You're not bad looking - a girl like

you doesn't have to starve.

WESTON (cont'd)

There's a new place, just opened.

(handing to her)

Listen, princess - this gig ain't the

Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny

K. Tell him I sent you.

ESTON (cont'd)

(evasive)

Just play the date, take the money and

forget you was ever there.

LOSE ON: CARL DENHAM sitting in the smoky SCREENING ROOM. He

ZELMAN

How much more is there?

ASSISTANT

Another five reels.

ZELMAN

Lights up.

THUGGISH INVESTOR

This is it? This is what we get for

our forty grand, Denham? Another one

of your Safari pictures?

LEAZY INVESTOR

You promised us romantic scenes with

Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.

DENHAM

Come on, fellas - you know the deal -

we agreed to push Maureen's start date

so she could get her teeth fixed.

THUGGISH INVESTOR

It's not the principle of the thing -

it's the money.

ELMAN

Carl - you've been in production for

over two months -

DENHAM

Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna

steam up the screen - once we get them

on the ship.

Z

ELMAN

What ship?

DENHAM

The one we've hired to get to the

location.

8.

ZELMAN

What location? Carl - you're supposed

to be shooting on the back-lot.

DENHAM

Yes, I understand that - but fellas,

we're not making that film anymore -

and I'll tell you why.

DENHAM (cont'd)

The story has changed, the script has

been rewritten.

DENHAM (cont'd)

Life intervened! I've come into

possession of a map.

growing excitement)

The soul surviving record of an

unchartered island, a place that was

thought to exist only in myth ...

until now!

ZELMAN

Whoa! Carl - slow down!

SLEAZY INVESTOR

Is he askin' for more money?

THUGISH INVESTOR

He's asking us to fund a wild goose-

chase.

DENHAM

I'm talking about a primitive world

... never before seen by man! The

ruins of an entire civilisation - the

most spectacular thing you've ever

seen!

(dramatiC pause)

That's where I'll shoot my picture!

SLEAZY INVESTOR

Will there be boobies?

DENHAM

Excuse me, boobies?

9.

SLEAZY INVESTOR

Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ...

In my experience people only go to

these films to observe the ...

undraped form of the native girls.

DENHAM

What are you - an idiot? You think

they asked De Mille to waste his time

on nudie shots? No - they respected

the film maker, they showed some

class! Not that you'd know what that

means - you cheap low-life!

ZELMAN

Would you step outside for a moment,

Carl?

DENHAM

Gimme that - quick!

PRESTON

You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!

DENHAM

Preston, you have a lot to learn about

the motion picture business.

ZELMAN

Don't write him off fellas. He's hot-

headed sure, but Carl Denham's made

some interesting pictures, he's had a

lot of ... near success.

10.

THUGGISH INVESTOR

(interrupts)

He's a preening self promoter ...

THUGGISH INVESTOR (O.S.)

(through the door)

... an ambitious no-talent! The guy

has "loser" written all over him.

ELMAN (O.S.)

Look, I understand your

disappointment.

HUGISH INVESTOR (O.S.)

He's washed up - It's all over town!

SLEAZY INVESTOR (O.S.)

He can't direct. He doesn't have the

smarts.

THUGGISH INVESTOR

This jumped up little turd's gonna

bankrupt us.

ZELMAN

The animal footage has value?

SLEAZY INVESTOR

Sure ... Universal are desperate for

stock footage.

THUGGISH INVESTOR

Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We

gotta retrieve something from this

debacle.

ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.

ZELMAN

Get him back in.

YOUNG ASSISTANT

Mr. Denham?

11.

DENHAM

I want the cast and crew on the ship

within the hour.

RESTON

o Carl, you can't do this!

DENHAM

Tell `em the studio's pressured us

into an early departure.

PRESTON

It's not ethical!

DENHAM

hat are they gonna do - sue me? They

can get in line! I'm not going to let

them kill my film.

RESTON

ou realize none of the camera

equipment is on board. We have no

permits ... no visas ...

DENHAM

hat's why I have you, Preston.

RESTON

We have no insurance, no foreign

currency - in fact, we have no

currency of any kind -

DENHAM

Get in there!

PRESTON

ho's gonna pay for the ship?

SLEAZY INVESTOR

Get out of there!

12.

DENHAM

tep on it!

SLEAZY INVESTOR

(furious)

You're finished, Denham!

DENHAM

on't worry Preston - I've had a lot

of practice at this: I'm real good at

crapping the crappers.

CUT TO:

DENHAM

And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest

...

PRESTON (O.S.)

Red label, 80% proof - packed in a

crate marked "lemonade".

DENHAM

You got it ... and tell Maureen - she

doesn't have six hours to put on her

face. If she wants to be in this

picture, she's gotta be on that boat!

PRESTON

She doesn't want to be in this

picture.

P

RESTON (cont'd)

Maureen pulled out.

DENHAM

She pulled out?!

RESTON

Yesterday. I told you.

13.

DENHAM

(suspicious thought)

You said we were shooting in

Singapore, right? That's what you told

her?

PRESTON

But we're not shooting in Singapore.

DENHAM

exasperation)

Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do

is look her in the eye and lie.

DENHAM (cont'd)

I gotta get to a phone ... talk to

Harlow's people.

PRESTON

he`s unavailable.

DENHAM (O.S.)

Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

PRESTON

Mae West?! No! She has to be a size

four!

PRESTON

ou gotta get a girl who'll fit

Maureen's costumes.

DENHAM

(sudden inspiration)

Fay's a size four!

PRESTON

es she is, but she is doing a picture

with RKO.

DENHAM

ooper huh?

(darkly)

I might have known.

14.

PRESTON

We gotta delay the shoot - shut

production down ... We can't sail

tonight!

DENHAM

Not an option.

RESTON

Carl!

DENHAM

I said I'd find a girl.

DENHAM (cont'd)

For Godsake, Preston - think like a

winner. Call Jack ... I need that

Goddamn screenplay!

DENHAM (cont'd)

Defeat is always momentary.

LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.

VENDOR

(angry)

You gonna pay for this?

DENHAM (O.S.)

Excuse me ...

DENHAM (cont'd)

Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

DENHAM

Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville

once... that is a tough audience. If

you don't kill them fast, they kill

you.

ANN

Mr. Denham - I want you to know that

I'm not in the habit of accepting

charity from strangers, or for that

matter ... taking things that don't

belong to me.

D

DENHAM

t was obviously a terrible

misunderstanding.

ANN

It's just that, I haven't been paid in

a while ...

16.

DENHAM

mock sincerity)

That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call

you Ann?

DENHAM (cont'd)

... You wouldn't happen to be a size

four by any chance?

DENHAM (cont'd)

No! Oh God, no! You've got me all

wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not

that type of person at all!

ANN

What type of person are you?

DENHAM

I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a

movie producer.

(sincere)

Believe me, I am on the level, no

funny business. Please, sit down -

Please ... Please.

DENHAM (cont'd)

(pitching the film)

Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome

explorer bound for the Far East.

ANN

You're filming in the Far East?

DENHAM

Singapore. On board ship he meets a

mysterious girl. She's beautiful ...

she's fragile ... haunted ...

DENHAM (cont'd)

She can't escape the feeling that

forces beyond her control are

compelling her down a road from which

she cannot draw back. It's as if her

whole life has been a prelude to this

moment - this fateful meeting that

changes everything. And sure enough,

against her better judgement -

17.

ANN

She falls in love.

DENHAM

Yes!

ANN

But she doesn't trust it. She's not

even sure if she believes in love.

DENHAM

Oh really?

ANN

If she loves someone - it's doomed.

DENHAM

Why is that?

ANN

Good things never last, Mr. Denham.

DENHAM

So you're interested?

DENHAM (cont'd)

That's settled then. I don't want to

rush you - but we are under some time

pressure here.

ANN

Well I really -

DENHAM

Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect -

look at you! You're the saddest girl I

ever met ... you're gonna make `em

weep, Ann - you're gonna break their

hearts!

ANN

See, that's where you're wrong, Mr.

Denham, I make people laugh, that's

what I do.

ANN (cont'd)

Good luck with your picture.

DENHAM

(growing desperation)

Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!

18.

I'm offering NHAM(cont'd)

DE you money, adventure,

fame ... the thrill of a lifetime and

a long sea voyage. You wanna read a

script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a

draft as we speak.

ANN

Jack Driscoll?

DENHAM

ure. Why - wait! You know him?

ANN

Well, no - not personally. I've seen

his plays.

DENHAM

What a writer, huh? And let me tell

you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want

just anyone starring in this picture.

He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out

there is a woman born to play this

role ..."

(quiet realization)

And as soon as I saw you, I knew -

ANN

(uneasy)

Knew what?

DENHAM

It was always going to be you.

ANN

(awestruck)

Is this the moving picture ship?

DENHAM

Not exactly ... it's actually this one

over here.

19.

DENHAM (cont'd)

Don't let appearances deceive you.

It's much more spacious on board.

HAYES

Haul away ...

DENHAM

Is this all of the equipment? This is

all of it? We're taking the Bell and

Howell? Good. You got all the lenses -

you got the two and the six?

PRESTON (O.S.)

Carl!

DENHAM

Yes -

They're on their way. I've just had

word.

DENHAM

Who?

PRESTON

(whisper)

Men in uniform. The studio called the

cops!

DENHAM

Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the

mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever

the hell it is you do - we gotta

leave.

ENGLEHORN

I cannot do that ... we're waiting on

the manifest.

DENHAM

What? Who? English - please!

20.

ENGLEHORN

(dryly)

Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

DENHAM

(low voice)

I'll give you another thousand to

leave right now.

ENGLEHORN

You haven't given me the first

thousand yet.

DENHAM

Can we talk about this later. Can't

you see we're in the company of a VIP

guest?

ENGLEHORN

Ma'am...

ANN

Ann Darrow.

ENGLEHORN

So you are ready for this voyage, Miss

Darrow?

ANN

Sure...

ENGLEHORN

Nervous?

ANN

Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?

ENGLEHORN

It isn't every woman who would take

such a risk.

PRESTON

(hurriedly)

Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her

cabin?

DENHAM

Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.

21.

PRESTON

Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my

name is Preston, Carl's assistant.

DENHAM

Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will

you take a cheque?

ENGLEHORN

Do I have a choice?

EXT. VENTURE/NY DOCKS - NIGHT

PRESTON

Please, follow me. If there's anything

that you need ... `excuse me fellas,

if there's anything that you need

please don't hesitate to ... ask ...

DENHAM

Jesus, Jack - you scared me!

DENHAM (cont'd)

Listen, if anyone comes to the door,

don't open it. You haven't seen me ...

say I got depressed and committed

suicide. Say I stuck my head down a

toilet!

DENHAM

What's this?

JACK

It's the script.

DENHAM

This is a script? Jack ... this is

fifteen pages.

ACK

I know - but they're good! You've got

fifteen good pages there, Carl!

DENHAM

I'm supposed to be making a feature

length picture.

JACK

You told me I had more time. I'm

sorry. Look I gotta go.

DENHAM

Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I

have a beginning but I need a middle

shoot.

JACK

You got my notes - I gotta go. See

you.

Let's start from the beginning.

I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just

Never mind, pay me when you get back!

Alright ... okay ...

NGLE ON: BRUCE BAXTER walking along the CORRIDOR, with PRESTON

PRESTON

Your cabin's just down here,

Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we

are to have you back with us, Sir.

BRUCE

Be a sport and lend us a hand.

JACK

Oh, Christ!

BRUCE

(dryly)

Appreciate the help, fella.

PRESTON

Let me get the door for you - welcome

to your state room sir.

25.

RESTON

know, that's not a nice smell is it?

I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or

two. Did I ever mention how much I

love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen

every one of your pictures ... even

the silent ones.

RUCE

I haven't made any silent ones.

ENGLEHORN

Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.

HAYES

Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

JACK

Oh Christ!

JACK (cont'd)

Goddammit!

DENHAM

I keep telling you, Jack, there's no

money in theatre.

CUT TO:

SLEAZY INVESTOR

No, no, no!

DENHAM

You're much better off sticking with

film.

JACK

I don't do it for the money, Carl. I

happen to love the theatre.

DENHAM

o, you don't.

DENHAM (cont'd)

If you really loved it, you would have

jumped.

27.

PRESTON

(apologetic)

I hope you find it to your liking...

it's quite comfortable. Your towels

and linens are underneath the bed.

That is the wash basin. I know, that's

not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure

it'll disperse in a day or two.

RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE.

PRESTON (cont'd)

The closet ... your costumes - I hope

you'll find everything is in order. If

there is anything that you need,

please do not hesitate to ask...fresh

water, perhaps? I can bring it to you

personally.

DENHAM

Knock knock! We can't have our leading

lady deprived of the necessities of

life.

to PRESTON)

Do me a favour - run a bottle down to

Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.

PRESTON

They're still trying to find a place

for him to sleep.

DENHAM

(to PRESTON)

You told him my typewriter is

available for hire?

RESTON

Yes - he didn't take it well.

ANN

(confused)

Mr. Driscoll ...?

ANN (cont'd)

He's on board?

DENHAM

Jack has his heart set on coming. Call

me a softie - I couldn't say no.

28.

CHOY

This room very comfortable, plenty dim

light ... fresh straw.

JACK

What'd you keep down here?

CHOY

Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.

ENGLEHORN (cont'd)

My apologies for not being able to

offer you a cabin. Have you found an

enclosure to your taste?

JACK

(dryly)

Spoilt for choice.

ENGLEHORN

What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or

a chimpanzee?

29.

JACK

Maybe, I'll take this one.

E

ENGLEHORN

I told you to lock it up.

CHOY

Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -

told you?

JIMMY

Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

HAYES

How about you return Mr. Driscoll's

pen first?

HAYES (cont'd)

He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep

him out of Jyour way.

ACK

No, it's okay.

HAYES

It's just he likes it down here, it's

where I found him ... four years ago

... stowed away in one of them cages.

His arm was broken in two places, he

was wilder than half the animals in

here. Still won't tell me where he

came from - all I know, it wasn't any

place good.

HAYES

You gotta straighten up. You don't

want to be on this ship for the rest

of your life.

JIMMY

I do.

31.

HAYES

No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get

yourself educated. Give yourself some

options. Take this serious.

JIMMY

I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been

readin'.

HAYES

Where did you get this?

JIMMY

(prevaricating)

I borrowed it ...

JIMMY (cont'd)

JIMMY (cont'd)

"Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See -

ANN

It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll -

I'm actually quite familiar with your

work.

(trying again)

Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's

so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm

quite familiar with your work. I'm a

huge fan!

(one more time)

I've read everything you've ever

written.

32.

IKE

I'm gonna have the ships' engines all

over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera

noise, wind and Christ knows what

else!

DENHAM

I don't care, Mike! You're the sound

recordist - make it work.

DENHAM (cont'd)

Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you

to the crew! This is Herb - our

cameraman ...

HERB

Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may

I say what a lovely dress.

ANN

Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it

on!

PRESTON

(confused to DENHAM)

Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?

ANN

(hurriedly)

What does a girl have to do round here

to get some breakfast!

DENHAM

Lumpy! You heard the lady!

LUMPY

Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge

aux walnuts?

DENHAM

ANN, I don't believe you've met -

ANN

That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who

this is ...

ANN (cont'd)

Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour -

to be part of this.

MIKE

(bewildered)

Gee, thanks!

ANN

Actually - I am quite familiar with

your work.

MIKE

Really?

ANN

Yes, and what I most admire - is the

way you have captured the voice of the

common people.

MIKE

Well - that's my job.

ANN

I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr

Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying -

you don't look at all like your

photograph ...

NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns

MIKE

Excuse me?

DENHAM

Wait a minute! Ann -

ANN

(to DENHAM)

Well, he's so much younger - in

person.

(turning back to MIKE)

And much better looking.

34.

DENHAM

ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -

ANN

I was afraid you might be one of those

self obsessed literary types. You know

- the tweedy twerp with his nose in a

book and his head up his -

JACK

It's nice to meet you too, Miss

Darrow..

RUCE bumps into JIMMY who hurries away looking shifty.

DENHAM (V.O.)

She's standing at the railing ... she

doesn't know it yet, but they're

sailing towards disaster. You got

that?

JACK (V.O.)

She turns ... The First Mate is

staggering towards her - there's a

knife sticking out of his back!

DENHAM

ait a second, we're killing off the

First Mate?

35.

JACK

That's assuming she knows who the

First Mate is.

DENHAM

Come on, Jack! It was an honest

mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it

JACK

I was joking, Carl.

DENHAM

The point is: she's horrified. She has

to look away. And that's when she sees

it.

JACK

See's what? What?

DENHAM

(dramatic)

The island.

JACK

(taken aback)

We're filming on an island now? When

did this happen?

DENHAM

Jack, keep your voice down! I don't

want the crew getting spooked.

JACK

Why would they get spooked? What's it

called?

DENHAM

All right ... It has a local name, but

I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't

sound good.

DENHAM (cont'd)

(quietly)

They call it ...

What's wrong with this place?

There's nothing officially wrong with

I think this is awfully exciting! I've

never been on a ship before.

BRUCE

I've never been on one with a woman

before.

ANN

I guess you don't think much of women

on ships, do you?

BRUCE

No, they're a nuisance.

37.

ANN (O.S.)

Well, I'll try not to be.

BRUCE (O.S.)

Just being around is trouble.

ANN (O.S.)

Well! Is that a nice thing to say!

BRUCE (O.S.)

It's a dangerous thing, having girls

on ships. They're messy and they're

unreliable!

Cut! Great!

JACK

It was pure effluence.

BRUCE

JACK

Try to resist that impulse.

BRUCE

It's just a little humor, Bud - what

are you, a Bolshevik or something?

JACK

Actors. They travel the world but all

they ever see is a mirror!

JACK

Good legs.

JACK (cont'd)

Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea

legs. Not that you don't have good

legs, I was just ...

JACK (cont'd)

... making conversation. Jesus!

Miss Darrow!

JACK (cont'd)

About the scene - today, with you and

Bruce -

ANN

I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But

Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when

a man likes a woman - then he must

ignore her. And if things turn really

hostile ... no?

JACK

Interesting theory.

ANN

I know ... I should have -

JACK

It wasn't what I had intended ... but

I'm sorry - I was ...

Gentlemen please, we're not looking

JIMMY

No. You're looking for something else

DENHAM

Yes .... we are. We're gonna find

Skull Island! We're gonna find it,

film it and show it to the world. For

twenty five cents you get to see the

last blank space on the map!

LUMPY

I wouldn't be so sure of that.

PRESTON

What do you mean?

LUMPY

Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we

were working our passage on a

Norwegian barque.

HAYES

We picked up a castaway - found him in

the water - he'd been drifting for

days.

LUMPY

His ship had run aground on an island,

way West of Sumatra. An island hidden

in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built

so long ago - no one knew who had made

it ... A wall a hundred foot high ...

as strong today as it was, ages ago.

PRESTON

Why did they build the wall?

42.

LUMPY

The castaway - he spoke of a creature,

neither beast nor man, but something

monstrous, living behind that wall...

DENHAM

A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's

how all these stories start.

PRESTON

(to LUMPY)

What else did he say?

LUMPY

Nothing. We found him the next morning

... he'd stuck a knife through his

heart.

NGLE ON: PRESTON looking ASHEN ... DENHAM breaks the GRIM MOOD.

orry fellas, you'll have to do better

than that. Monsters belong in B

Why would you do that?

Why would I write a play for you?

Yes.

You want to trap the Ape? I don't

It felt like the right thing to do at

the time.

Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but

And that's when he told you how he

felt?

JAYNE

No - he never said it.

THELMA

He never said it?!

HELMA

Men! They'll give you the world ...

But they let the one thing that truly

matters slip through their fingers.

All for the sake of three little

words!

EDGAR

The three hardest words in the English

language!

109.

DENHAM

hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank

you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here

to tell you a very strange story ... a

story of our adventure in which

seventeen of our party suffered

horrible deaths! Their lives lost in

pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous

aberration of nature! But even the

meanest brute can be tamed. Yes,

Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see,

the Beast was no match for the charms

of a girl - a girl from New York ...

who melted his heart. Bringing to mind

that old Arabian proverb ...

DENHAM V/O cont'd)

"And lo the Beast looked upon the face

of Beauty and Beauty stayed his hand

... and from that day forward he was

as one dead ..."

STAGE MANAGER

You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes.

the mighty "Kong"!

DENHAM (cont'd)

The man who risked all to win the

freedom of a helpless female! A big

hand for ... Mr. Bruce Baxter!

UGE AUDIENCE ACCLAIM! DENHAM shakes BRUCE by the hand, slapping

DENHAM (cont'd)

Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you

will an uncharted island ... a

forgotten fragment from another time

... And clinging to life in this

savage place, imagine a people

untutored in the ways of the civilised

world. A people who have dwelt all

their lives in the shadow of Fear! In

the shadow of ... "Kong"!

EHIND him in the DARKNESS of the AUDITORIUM a FIGURE rises

PRESTON

(quietly)

He was right ...

112.

PRESTON (cont'd)

... about there still being some

mystery left in this world ...

PRESTON (cont'd)

(softly)

And we can all have a piece of it ...

for the price of an admission ticket.

JACK

(quietly)

That's the thing you come to learn

about Carl ... his unfailing ability

to destroy the things he loves.

Gentlemen - for we now come to the

BRUCE

Well to be honest with you, I had some

anxious moments ...
