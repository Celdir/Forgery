Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg

Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he

ATLEY JACKSON

You gonna steal her or kneel down to

her and pray -- ?

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...

Just take her, slick. - -

DONNY

Problem, Officer?

POLICEMAN

Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

DONNY

For running a stop sign?

POLICEMAN

For Grand Theft Auto -

HAWKINGS

Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of

Raines...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Well, then it's all for naught,

ain't it, Hawkings?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I know you --

MEMPHIS

You know my back -

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

You want to come along quiet?

MEMPHIS

How's Atley -- ?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Leg's all banged-up. He made a

stupid play ... He'll limp around

the yard up at Folsom. But

Astricky will be there to take

care of him. With their priors,

they're looking at a serious bounce --

MEMPHIS

Let them go --

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

How's that?

MEMPHIS

Let them go. And I'll leave ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

You'll leave -- ?

MEMPHIS

You don't have anything on me. A

misdee auto-theft. I got no record.

I'll be out in three days, and back at

it. Or you let them go, and I give

you my word. I'm gone. And without the

ringleader ... Your tee-times have

just grown exponentially...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I don't golf...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)

I do this. And I see you again. I'll

come after you with everything I got.

you won't be able to steal a glance

at a blind man without me by your side ...

MEMPHIS

You have my word...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Get out of here, then. Now.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Leave the car, Randall ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Arright, let lim go. Cite him for

rolling the stop ... And cite old

Atley for driving to endanger ...

HAWKINGS

What are you talking about, Rollie? We're

springing 'em? Just like that?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,

Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

CUT TO:

MEMPHIS

You know what you got here?

TOM

Not really -

MEMPHIS

There's excessive resistance in the cranking

circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?

TOM

Not really --

MEMPHIS

You have any other answers besides

"not really"?

TOM

Not --

MEMPHIS

Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...

Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary

lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...

See what you got ... You understand -- ?

BUDGY

Just can't find good help these days --

MEMPHIS

(re: cigarette)

Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --

BUDGY

They won't have a chance. The bourbon and

bacon'll get me first...

BUDGY (cont'd)

That one -

MEMPHIS

1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...

Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;

they modified the chassis, but didn't

improve its performance...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof

positive of a single all-powerful Deity.

The first bargain-priced muscle car

ever. They even tuned the horn to

resemble the "beep beep" sound of the

cartoon Road Runner ...

BUDGY

Damn, you're good

BUDGY (cont'd)

You got to bingo last night?

MEMPHIS

That I did, Budgy. That I did --

TOM (O.S.)

Uh ... Randall -- ?

MEMPHIS

Excuse me --

CUT TO:

FREB

The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia.

Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus

would be at the corner of Hawthorne

and Granvia --

KIP

He didn't mess up. There it is ...

FREB

That -- ?

MIRROR MAN

You're shittin', right? Kip?

FREB

How are we supposed to--

KIP

Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

MIRROR MAN

What tool -- ?

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Oh, no --

MIRROR MAN

Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a

stolen car

KIP

Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

CUT TO:

ATLEY JACKSON

Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

TUMBLER

What's your problem, bro ?

ATLEY JACKSON

Where are they -- ?

TUMBLER

They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back

in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in

them veins ... What happened -- ?

TUMBLER (cont'd)

Relax and enjoy --

MIRROR MAN

Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,

stolen car ...

KIP

Stolen fast car...

KIP (cont'd)

It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see

if these British boys are full of shit

or not --

MIRROR MAN

No way, man --

ATLEY JACKSON

Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

TUMBLER

Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

ATLEY JACKSON

She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

MIRROR MAN

I can vouch for that.

TUMBLER

Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

KIP

No problem -

THUGGISH MAN

Let's get outta here -- !

ATLEY JACKSON

Now you gone and done it, Raines

And they flee ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

They're gone...

MEMPHIS

What's going on -- ?

ATLEY JACKSON

Well, well, well ...

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

(ANDY GRIFFITH theme)

Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.

(laughs)

Are you kidding me, man -- ?

MEMPHIS

Hello, Atley ...

ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)

L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

MEMPHIS

How's the leg?

ATLEY JACKSON

Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit

you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt

Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's

Opie at?

MEMPHIS

What are you doing here?

ATLEY JACKSON

Is there someplace we can talk?

MEMPHIS

What about?

ATLEY JACKSON

About your brother. And the deeeep

shit he's in --

WAITRESS

There you go --

MEMPHIS

Thanks, Donna --

ATLEY JACKSON

It's been a long time, Memphis --

MEMPHIS

Six years ...

ATLEY JACKSON

Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?

Six years ago we were fartin' through

Armani and pissin' Cristal.

Now look at us ...

MEMPHIS

Tell me about Kip -

ATLEY JACKSON

He took a job. And he fumbled it.

Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

MEMPHIS

What kind of job... ?

ATLEY JACKSON

A boost. A big boost ...

MEMPHIS

A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

ATLEY JACKSON

You're shittin', right?

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

Kip's become quite the little

crewrunner since you left. He's been

working a low-rent ring for

two years now. You don't talk to

your Ma?

MEMPHIS

It seems she neglected to mention it

ATLEY JACKSON

Maybe she don't know. Although I don't

see how that could be. Maybe she didn't

want to upset you -

MEMPHIS

Don't feel the need to explore my family

dynamics, Atley...

ATLEY JACKSON

The point is: Kip's been living the

life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.

Makes our old behavior seem like

altar boy time. But he fungold this

one so bad, folks around L.B.

are already speakin' about him in

the past tense.

MEMPHIS

Who was the job for?

ATLEY JACKSON

Who do you think?

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"

Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

I just thought you should know,

man. I kind of had a feeling you

didn't. But I should tell you:

I'm working for him now - The

Carpenter - so if you see him, you

won't mention me coming to get

you... Like I said: I just thought

... I owed you ... And that it was

the right thing to do ...

KID

Can I get some more coffee -- ?

HELEN RAINES

Sure, hon ...

MEMPHIS (O.S.)

Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna

melt in this joint -- ?

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Hello, Ma --

HELEN RAINES (cont'd)

Oh, Randall ...

COOK

What's the word, Memphis -- ?

MEMPHIS

How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

HELEN RAINES

Come, come, come ...

HELEN RAINES (cont'd)

Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,

extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate

milk... Lots of syrup...

(to Memphis)

Right?

MEMPHIS

Right ...

HELEN RAINES

You look good...

MEMPHIS

You, too, Ma...

HELEN RAINES

What are you doing back?

MEMPHIS

How's Kip?

HELEN RAINES

Have you seen him?

MEMPHIS

No.

HELEN RAINES

oh.

MEMPHIS

Atley Jackson came to see me ...

HELEN RAINES

Atley Jackson. How is that one?

How's the leg... ?

MEMPHIS

Why didn't you tell me?

HELEN RAINES

I couldn't. I didn't want you to

worry. I thought held sort himself

out. I hardly see him. He comes and

goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

MEMPHIS

He's in some trouble ...

HELEN RAINES

I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a

different boy. He's lost that... That

sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't

know what to do ...

MEMPHIS

You getting my checks ... ?

HELEN RAINES

Of course ...

RUBY

Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...

Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess

who just come in to visit his Ma --

HELEN RAINES (cont'd)

You haven't spoken to him in a

while, I guess...

MEMPHIS

He doesn't return my calls. or my

letters ...

HELEN RAINES

Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.

I don't know what you remember of him.

But you should brace yourself

TUMBLER

... so ... It's my new move ... It's called

"The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on

my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls

asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.

And then I jerk off.

GIRL

That's disgusting -

FREB

What's the point, man -- ?

TUMBLER

Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger

... It rocks ... It's the power move of the

New Millennium...

TOBY

Hey, Kip, what's up?

KIP

What do you say, Toby?,

TOBY

I'm cool -

TUMBLER

What do you want, shithead?

TOBY

Why you gotta front me like that? I'm

talking to Kip --

TUMBLER

Why don't you leave him alone?

TOBY

I known Kip longing than you, man ...

TUMBLER

Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

FREB

Any word, Kip -- ?

KIP

No ... And they won't take my calls ...

FREB

What does that mean -- ?

KIP

It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

KIP (cont'd)

Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.

We just gotta step it up ...

FREB

But we only got till Friday. That's

four days. And we lost the 13. So's

we gotta start over ...

KIP

That, too ...

(off of Freb's look of fright)

Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

KIP

It can be done, man. We just gotta

step it up... It's a challenge ...

MIRROR MAN

The challenge is not to get our nuts

cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

TUMBLER

Can I help you, pal -- ?

MEMPHIS

Hey, Kip ...

KIP

Hello, Memphis --

TUMBLER

"Memphis?" You're Memphis?

MEMPHIS

That's right...

TUMBLER

Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

FREB

Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,

man --

KIP

It's good to see ya, man. You changed

your look -

MEMPHIS

You, too

FREB

What are you doing back, Memphis?

MEMPHIS

Little visit. Check on the family.

KIP

It's nice to see ya, man -

TOBY

Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby

Walker. I live next door ...

MEMPHIS

Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

TOBY

Yeah, I'm cool ...

KIP

Who's got next game -- ?

MIRROR MAN

I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:

Memphis come back to save our bacon!

TUMBLER

Shut-up, Mirror Man --

FREB

Izzat true? You come back to save our

bacon?

MIRROR MAN

Of course it's true. He come to save

his brother's dangling ass --

KIP

That can't be it. Cos we don't need

saving

FREB

We don't -- ?

MEMPHIS

He give you an advance -- ?

MIRROR MAN

Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

MEMPHIS

You just give 'im back the money.

All's well...

KIP

"Give lim back the money." "Give 'im

back the money..." Be nice. If only

we didn't drink the money. And smoke

the money. And buy Nikes with the

money. And Sony Play Stations with the

money. And dirty girls with the

money...

KIP

But don't worry, man. Things are all

sweetness and light here...

TUMBLER

Things are all leafy and suburban ...

MIRROR MAN

The hell they are --

KIP

Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the

gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...

And it was nice to see you -- -

MEMPHIS

You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy

yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,

well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a

poundcake. But I remember the days when you

used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...

So you can't stop me from saving your

"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like

doing...

TUMBLER

Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

DOG-FACE

Yeah -- ?

MEMPHIS

Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

CALITRI

Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...

(looks at his clothes;)

frowns)

'though I do I recall you as a man

with style. You remember your old

friend, Atley -- ?

MEMPHIS

How ya doing?

ATLEY JACKSON

Good to see you, Memphis --

CALITRI

So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

MEMPHIS

It's about my brother ... Kip...

CALITRI

Yes ... Kip ...

CALITRI

Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

CALITRI

You bring this to me in this

condition? Blood and guts all

over it? You make me complicit?

On my property? Who taught you

how to think? And worst of all:

weren't there supposed to be two

Hondas?

THIEF

Please ...

CALITRI

Stupid sonuvabitch...

ATLEY JACKSON

Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after

himself ...

MEMPHIS

Jesus ...

ATLEY JACKSON

The business has changed...

CALITRI

Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

MEMPHIS

I don't want him hurt...

CALITRI

I'm proud of this work. The bird

feeder. The wagon wheel planter.

The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable

server...

CALITRI (cont'd)

Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood

is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.

To see a piece of furniture take shape.

It's like watching a child grow ...

MEMPHIS

I'm sure you're working your way to

the point.  I'll wait right here ...

CALITRI

My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require

the best. I insist on the best. I only

engage the best.  Your brother. His

friends. They came to me. They wanted my

paper. He was your brother. You were the

best. Now. They've brought so much

goddamn heat down, I may not be able to

fill this order. Which would be very bad

for me. Which in turn, is very bad for

them...

MEMPHIS

I could kill you. That occurred to me.

When I first heard about this. That I

would kill you ...

CALITRI

Grow up. You don't kill people like me.

People like me die in their sleep at

87 ... Do you know why? Because if

you did kill me, and everyone knew it

was you - for the next ten years they'd

be finding pieces of those you love

scattered all over California ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

No, no. You don't kill me, because

you can't. You don't take your brother

and run, because we'd find him. You

don't go to the-police, because we have

friends there, too. You do nothing:

except deal with me.

MEMPHIS

I can come up with the front money.

Pay you back...

CALITRI

Were it only that easy. I have

obligations. The order needs to be

filled...

CALITRI (cont'd)

On that list, you'll find fifty cars.

Fifty. Five-zero. They range in

age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird

to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in

expense from the 1993 Volkswagen

Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini

Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

CALITRI (cont'd)

There is a container ship in Long

Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be

loaded with 4-car-per shipping

containers, false-walled and

customsprofiled as motor oil

designated. The ship leaves in four

days for South America and the

men who've tendered me this contract ...

MEMPHIS

They gave you only four days?

CALITRI

They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it

with your brother and his crew, who not

only lost what pitiful few they managed

to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our

endeavor, making this even more difficult

to achieve ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200

thousand dollars ...

MEMPHIS

I'm not interested --

CALITRI

I knew you'd say that.

MEMPHIS

I'm just here about my brother.

CALITRI

I knew you'd say that, too --

MEMPHIS

Sound it out for me.

CALITRI

Your brother has four days. Fifty

cars. Five-zero. For that he gets

200 large ...

MEMPHIS

And if he doesn't make it -- ?

CALITRI

I made this, too. My first one.

Brass extension handles, not plated.

The coverings are silk, not rayon.

Expensive hardwood. And lined with

spray green Lorraine crepe ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In

case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,

if that ship sets off without my

fifty ... Kip will take up permanent

residence in this box ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

Come here for a second, boys --

DIGGER

Evenin', Mr. C. --

CALITRI

Digger, Butz: let me introduce

you to Randall Raines. Used to

head up the dandiest ring in

Southern Cal. Left us

for parts unknown. Randall, this

is Digger. And that's Butz -

DIGGER

Hi, Randall --

CALITRI

Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.

They're good boys ...

MEMPHIS

I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

CALITRI

"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or

the summer to end. But we

don't get to choose these things...

CALITRI (cont'd)

"Nothing that's forced can ever be

right." Old woodworking expression.

I really don't care how the 50

get onto my ship ... I just care

that they do. You decide.

REPORTER

... the car-jacking, which left Ramona

Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of

three, dead, occurred last night at ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I know you.

MEMPHIS

You know my back.

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

When'd you get to town, Raines?

MEMPHIS

The other day....

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

What for?

MEMPHIS

No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I

heard we got Shaquille ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

Where you been, anyway?

MEMPHIS

Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my

collection of refrigerator magnets ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

You seem a little hinked-up ...

MEMPHIS

Not at all ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I remember us having made some

kind of deal, Randall. I don't

remember this deal having some kind

of time-limit. I look at you -

here - in my town - and I'm

confused...

MEMPHIS

A little family emergency --

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I hope it's not your dear sweet

mother...

MEMPHIS

No...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Or your baby brother. What was his

name?

MEMPHIS

Kip.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.

Named for the English writer

of stories about India ...

He bites into his pear ...

Memphis says nothing, waits ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)

I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is

making noise. We recovered a big take -

last week...

MEMPHIS

And this has what to do with me?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I don't know. But you shouldn't

be here. Take care of your business.

I'll give you 24 hours. And

then I don't want to see your face.

Ever again. Make a fool of me

once, that's my bad. Make a fool of

me twice. That's really my

bad, and I'll kick your ass from

here to India ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Good. Cos you know how it plays.

Six years ago, I let you go free. But

the next time ... The next time sends

you away for'a long, long while ...

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

By the time you get out, asshole, there

won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'

around in space ships ...

TOBY

You goin' home?

KIP

Yeah... You want a ride...

TOBY

Sure -

KIP

How'd you get here? Your Moms give you

ride -- ?

TOBY

Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

KIP

You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

TOBY

I dunno. It was right here. Someone

musta' boosted it back...

KIP

Damn crooks is everywhere --

TOBY (cont'd)

Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with

them clothes? He a farmer now or

something?

KIP

Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing

is old...

KIP (cont'd)

What do you want -- ?

KIP

Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

GOON

Shaddup, Raines

KIP

He's got nothing to do with this --

GOON

Get him in the car

CALITRI

Hello, Kip --

KIP

Lemme out of this --

CALITRI

Were it only that easy --

KIP

We can still do it --

CALITRI

No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you

remind me of. Because just being attracted

to something, doesn't mean you belong...

KIP

Listen, Calitri --

CALITRI

Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me

"asshole." Cos that's how you've

treated me --

KIP

I get out of this I'm gonna fuck

you up --

KIP (cont'd)

Calitri -- !

MEMPHIS

Kip -- ?

KIP

Yeah ...

MEMPHIS

You all right -- ?

KIP

I think so. There's things I can't

feel right now. Like my feet. But ...

You think you can get me outta this,

Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

MEMPHIS

Just hold-on there --

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

So you want to run that part by me

again about things being "all

sweetness and light..."

KIP

This has nothing to do with any

of that --

MEMPHIS

Oh. You maybe have more than one

enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

KIP

All my enemies own car crushers.

It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

MEMPHIS

Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost

there...

MEMPHIS

You okay -- ?

KIP

Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,

man -- ?

MEMPHIS

Sure --

KIP

you like Kobe's game? I do. You

think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.

He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's

got that going for him --

MEMPHIS

You sure you're okay -- ?

KIP

Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

KIP

Cool. So you're living up North?

MEMPHIS

Yeah -

KIP

I heard you were pumping gas -

MEMPHIS

Something like that -

KIP

You're kind of cultivating a new look.

MEMPHIS

Yeah --

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Maybe you need a stitch --

KIP

Nah. It's a scratch.

MEMPHIS

Okay --

KIP

Hey, you want something to eat ?

MEMPHIS

What do you got ... ?

KIP

Not much. I got olives. You like

olives?

Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes

the Calabrese. It's more mellow

MEMPHIS

There's certainly a time and a place

for a mellow olive -

KIP

Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

MEMPHIS

So what are you gonna do?

KIP

About what?

MEMPHIS

"About what?"

KIP

About Calitri? No worries, man.

I'll call him. He's a reasonable

dude ...

MEMPHIS

I can see that -

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

You have everything ... under

control?

KIP

Yeah. He just wants to know I'm

still on it. He needs reassurance.

All these big swinging dicks do.

No worries. I won't let him get

into our Kool-Aid...

KIP (cont'd)

What -- ?

MEMPHIS

What happened to you?

KIP

What?

MEMPHIS

You just got crushed in a car. You're

bleeding all over your self. And you

sit there - eating olives and talking

basketball, as if, at this very

moment, people weren't plotting

your demise ...

KIP

C'mon, man... My "demise..."

(chuckles)

Overreaction

MEMPHIS

"Over--"  You know - I can maybe

understand, since I been gone, you

taking up this dumb-ass life of

crime, and for that I can partly

blame myself. But what is baffling

to me, is how, since I been gone,

you've become a complete and total

moron--

KIP

Hey, now -

MEMPHIS

He's gonna kill you -- !

KIP

I can handle it --

MEMPHIS

You can handle it?

KIP

I can handle it --

MEMPHIS

You can handle it?

KIP

I can handle it --

MEMPHIS

You?

KIP

Me.

MEMPHIS

You?

KIP

Me...

KIP (cont'd)

Why? You think you can help me?

KIP (cont'd)

What can you do? You haven't done

anything in six years but pump gas

and go overall shopping. And

the cars, they've changed ...

There's new shit. Computer chip

keys and sophisticated alarms and

I don't think, an old guy, could much

bypass 'em...

MEMPHIS

You don't think so, huh?

KIP

Not really ... But you know... Maybe

I'm wrong ...

ATLEY JACKSON

Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

FISHERMAN

Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

ATLEY JACKSON

You can't get it any fresher than this,

Memphis ... From the sea to my

skillet ... Nothing in between...

MEMPHIS

What's with the fish thing -- ?

ATLEY JACKSON

We can learn something from our Asian

friends. They smoke a thousand

cigarettes a day; they're completely

stressed and overworked; they drink

like, well ...

MEMPHIS

Fish.

ATLEY JACKSON

And they still have the lowest rate of

cancer of anywhere in the world. You

know why? All they eat is seafood.

MEMPHIS

Also, never underestimate the restorative

powers of "Karaoke."

ATLEY JACKSON

I do a poaching number. Six-ounce

fillets in a saucepan of brine. In

8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn

wedding. Plain but flavorful. And

it's a good way to show off my

Hollandaise sauce ...

MEMPHIS

You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

ATLEY JACKSON

I do ...

(laughs)

Christ, what happened to us ?

MEMPHIS

Speak for yourself, boss I don't

have a Hollandaise sauce

ATLEY JACKSON

No, but you dress like an asshole ...

MEMPHIS

I think about that night a lot...

ATLEY JACKSON

Me, too. Every time I walk...

MEMPHIS

How they were just there ... Waiting on

us ... The fix was definitely in ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Yeah, you know: I just. I just

never really thanked-you. I meant

to. I just want you to

know...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Tell him it's on ...

ATLEY JACKSON

Yeah -- ?

MEMPHIS

Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and

them Tell him it's on

ATLEY JACKSON

Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

OTTO

Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life

returning to bid a final farewell?

(holds him at arm's length)

And have my angels completely lost

their fashion sense -- ?

MEMPHIS

Hello, Otto ...

OTTO

You remember Junie?

MEMPHIS

Of course. Hi, Junie --

JUNIE

Hello, Memphis -

MEMPHIS

What happened here -- ?

OTTO

Whatever do you mean?

MEMPHIS

The chop-shop... Where are the stripped

cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The

part bins?

OTTO

What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of

killing them. I woke up one morning and thought

I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of

resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.

There are so few things in this life, we can

prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't

have to...

OTTO (cont'd)

It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black

acrylic lacquer before laying out the

flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar

flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...

(turns to Memphis)

Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look

splendid ...

MEMPHIS

You, too, Otto

OTTO

I heard rumors you were back. About

Kip ...

MEMPHIS

He's gotten involved --

OTTO (O.S.)

I can't concentrate. Play something, my

sweetness; my reason to rise ...

OTTO (cont'd)

The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le

Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear

how they got the engine up?

Hear those exhaust notes? That's a

very wide rev range... Here, it

peaks at 5500 RPM...

OTTO (cont'd)

Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much

sorrow on these streets ...

MEMPHIS

You think it can be done?

OTTO

Are you considering a comeback tour?

MEMPHIS

Tell me...

OTTO

It can be done. Take two days to shop;

one to prep. I'll offer up my bible

for a small fee. You also have to

hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo

Castlebeck's linkage so much so

that he's setting up surveillance

teams on every city block. And

then get yourself a crew...

MEMPHIS

The hard part ...

OTTO

"A people is a detour of nature to

get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then

to get around them..." Nietzsche said

that.

MEMPHIS

Is he still working here ?

OTTO

The old crew. Go find them. I can't

help you with that. Since I've cleaned

up the act a bit, they no longer come

around... A pity how legitimacy makes

you unpopular -

MEMPHIS

I Just don't know how happy they'll be

to see me

OTTO

I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.

worst car ever built. Value job.

Everything broke and I-fixed it.

A coma car - built to German specs.

Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.

On a quiet night, you could hear it

rusting in the garage. But when that

car was gone, I missed it. If it came

driving back in here right now,

there'd be tears and laughter ...

MEMPHIS

And the moral of that story is -- ?

OTTO

Go to them. They'll be happy to see

you ... Ahhh...

OTTO (cont'd)

... 8.8:1 compression...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

Put it in PARK. Remember how

to do that? It's the big "Pff.

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

"Objects May Appear Closer

Than They Seem." Can you say

that for me?

JENNY

I'm sorry.

DONNY ASTRICKY

You ain't sorry. You're a horrible

driver... You can't strap into

your seat belt, without almost

getting creamed by a bus ...

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.

You can't drive. You can't.

Time to acknowledge it and move on. I

can't swim. I know I can't. So you

know what I do? I stay the fuck outta

the pool ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

MEMPHIS

How you doing, man?

DONNY ASTRICKY

All I get are the Orientals. They can

build 'em, but they can't drive

'em So? What are you doing here?

What's with the outfit -- ?

MEMPHIS

You know where the others are?

DONNY ASTRICKY

Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are

doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro

and Frankie Fish are moving

weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was

killed in Denver... Atley

Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'

errands for Calitri; The Sphinx

is still around, I guess ... Then

of course, there's ...

MEMPHIS

Forget that ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this

about anyways -- ?

DONNY ASTRICKY

Most of 'em are late-model...

MEMPHIS

That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

We'll have to start beating the

bushes, find out where they live...

OTTO

Some crew you got ...

MEMPHIS

If we put out the word. That we're

crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...

What do you think that'll yield?

DONNY ASTRICKY

A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-

up men. This ain't like the old days,

Memphis. The profession has lost its..

OTTO

Dignity...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Yeah...

MEMPHIS

Well, the three of us don't'exactly

inspire confidence...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

MEMPHIS

I know. Weird, huh -- ?

WORKER

Otto, there's someone here to --

DONNY ASTRICKY

Lookit Kip. All grown up...

KIP

Hey, Donny --

MEMPHIS

What are you doing here?

KIP

Otto called -

OTTO

You need him...

MEMPHIS

No we don't -

OTTO

I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.

But how are two washed-up thieves

and an old man supposed to boost

50 cars in three days...

MEMPHIS

His criminal career has officially come

to a close ...

OTTO

The conundrum still applies, of course. The

purpose of the endeavor is to rescue

baby brother from imminent

death and/or a life of crime. However.

This cannot be successfully

carried out without baby brother's

considerable resources, shabby

though they may be.

MEMPHIS

We do this. Then. You're finished.

Then. You're clean

KIP

I like how you wallop back in here -

after four years - and can still get all

Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

MEMPHIS

You hear me?

KIP

I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll

move to the country. Open a fruit

stand...

DONNY ASTRICKY

You guys have any skills at all?

KIP

Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is

our electronics expert. He's got

some gadgets you old farts maybe

never -heard of; Tumbler can drive

anything with wheels, and some

things without; Toby's a hacker,

can do things with a computer, that

are pretty amazing ...

MEMPHIS

How old are you now, Toby?

TOBY

Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven

months ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

(re: Freb)

What about him?

KIP

Freb can order pizzas like nobody's

business

FREB

People gotta eat ...

MEMPHIS

Okay, then... Otto?

OTTO

In order to succeed, you're going

to have to go old-school. one night

boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.

And...

TUMBLER

One night? Are you nuts?

MEMPHIS

You got maybe a better plan?

KIP

You spread it out ... you move around...

So's they can't touch you... so's they

don't know... Shadow games and shit

...

MEMPHIS

"Shadow games?"

KIP

Shadow games ...

MEMPHIS

You spread it out, by the 2nd night,

the heat are onto you. Know

something's up. With a one-night boost,

by the time all the cars are reported

stolen, your ship's set sail.

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Go on, Otto -

OTTO

We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to

shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still

going to need to expand the crew...

DONNY ASTRICKY

There's no one left ...

OTTO

We've got several Italian cars on the list.

Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So

we're gonna need a specialist ...

MIRROR MAN

(to Otto)

You know of one -- ?

MEMPHIS

Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

DRUNK

One more, girl -

SWAY

I think you've had enough, Billy...

DRUNK

Enough? I haven't even started, girl.

Gimme another --

SWAY

If you leave now, Billy, you can get

a head-start on waking up in a pool

of your own vomit...

DRUNK

Listen, you little cooze--

SWAY

Come back when you've learned how to

drink, Billy --

MEMPHIS

See you're still stealing the sailors from

the sea --

SWAY

What are you doing here?

SWAY

(re: his clothes)

What's with the look?

MEMPHIS

The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting

old...

SWAY

You look like you lost your sheep ...

MEMPHIS

You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

SWAY

Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in

here ...

MEMPHIS

Buy you a drink?

SWAY

Nope. I got a coffee. And a

boyfriend.

SWAY (cont'd)

Mitch.

MEMPHIS

"Mitch?"

SWAY

Mitch.

MEMPHIS

So I was replaced by Mitch?

SWAY

No. You were replaced by Alex.

Who was replaced by Kevin. Who

was replaced by Vince. Who was

replaced by Mitch...

MEMPHIS

Wow. And to think all I

accomplished these past six

years was the "LORD OF THE

RINGS" trilogy...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

You look great --

SWAY

Yeah, well, you always were a sucker

for flawed existences ...

SWAY (cont'd)

You should leave --

MEMPHIS

On account of Mitch?

SWAY

On account of me.

MEMPHIS

I've taken the spear for a lot of

people, Sway. Including you. Can't

we improvise a little here ... ?

SWAY

No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...

You left me, remember?

MEMPHIS

I left town. I didn't leave you.

SWAY

A distinction worth noting ...

MEMPHIS

And here I am...

SWAY

Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on

account of any longing-for-my-touch

on your part -

MEMPHIS

Kip's in trouble

SWAY

What kind of trouble -- ?

MEMPHIS

Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.

Only the two weeks have turned into four

days. And not a single lady has been

snared.

SWAY

And you got some Italians -- ?

MEMPHIS

Six or seven...

SWAY

I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't

for a while. I've carved out something

for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

MEMPHIS

I understand -

MITCH

Another round, Sara -

SWAY

Sure, Mitch -

MITCH

How you doing, pal?

MITCH (cont'd)

She's hot, right?

MEMPHIS

I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

MITCH

You should her face when she's having

sex --

MEMPHIS

Really?

MITCH

Really...

MEMPHIS

What's it look like?

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted

face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?

Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

SWAY

What the hell are you doing -- ?

MEMPHIS

If you change your mind. We're at

Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.

For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's

life on the felt. So long now ...

MITCH

Who was that guy, Sara?

SWAY

Good question ...

TUMBLER

Freb's here. Open the gate.

DONNY ASTRICKY

(to Otto)

We sent him out on a solo boost. See

what he could do ...

FREB

How do I look in this one?

MIRROR MAN

Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

DONNY ASTRICKY

How'd it go?

FREB

Keys were in it ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Well, that defies the point, don't it?

MIRROR MAN

You should ask him how he got the name

"Freb."

FREB

Shaddup, man ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Get the damn thing in there and get it

cleaned up -

KIP

This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Holy shit ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Lemme see that -

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

Heroin.

KIP

No shit?

DONNY ASTRICKY

There's gotta be a million bucks worth

here -

TUMBLER

We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

MEMPHIS

Where'd you pick her up?

FREB

In front of one of them poker parlors in

Chinatown ...

MEMPHIS

Well, take it back --

KIP

Take it back? What do you mean take

it back? Are you crazy, man?

MEMPHIS

Take it back, Freb --

MIRROR MAN

Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Now, see what you--

OTTO

Who is it -- ?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)

Castlebeck.

DONNY ASTRICKY

Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

OTTO

one minute -- !

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I know you.

MEMPHIS

You know my back.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

What are you still doing here,

Randall?

MEMPHIS

Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

What's this -- ?

OTTO

Cadillac.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

What's wrong with it -- ?

OTTO

Needs brightening ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

OTTO

No faith in our new-found goodness,

Detective ...?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Sure. But sometimes we got to

create some numbers. The task force

is run by statistics, you know ...

RADIO (O.S.)

329 HRO. There's no want on the license at

this time...

MEMPHIS

You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...

But they probably stripped its guts and

crated 'em up, right ... ?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Something like that -

MEMPHIS

Let her rip ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Okay, then. I'll catch you later,

Randall ...

OTTO

Double-meaning intended, right?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Right ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

It's funny. There's probably been

five more cars stolen in the time

I've been here ...

MEMPHIS

I don't think so, Detective ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Take her back to where you found her,

Freb --

MEMPHIS

Hey -

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Kip -

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

What do you got there?

HELEN RAINES

The photo album. I get nostalgic around

this time of year ...

MEMPHIS

What time of year?

HELEN RAINES

Tuesdays ...

MEMPHIS

You ever wonder what things'd be like

if he hadn't died?

HELEN RAINES

Every day. I wonder about that every day...

MEMPHIS

Kip and I'd probably be working at the

dealership...

(to Kip)

Imagine us selling cars?

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Imagine that -- ?

HELEN RAINES

(salesman voice)

And just in case you lose your keys, good

sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,

free of charge ...

MEMPHIS

Mother -- !

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

I remember, every day, he'd come home

in a different car.

That was the greatest thing ... And

we'd climb all over it ... Examine

every inch of every different

car ...

HELEN RAINES

I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you

two are out there heads under hoods ...

MEMPHIS

You remember that, Kip?

KIP

I was six ...

MEMPHIS

After he died ... I think that's

what I missed most of all ... That

there was no different cars every night ...

When I started hanging around Otto's ...

And he started showing me the things ...

It was a way to kill two birds ...

Put food on the table for you and Kip ...

And ... Ride in different cars every

night ... Just like when Dad was here.

KIP

Ancient history's two things.

"Ancient." And "history!"

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

HELEN RAINES

I know...

MEMPHIS

We do it. He'll get clear Once and

for all

DONNY ASTRICKY

Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.

No skill. No finesse. Can only take

the car if the key is in it. That's

not thieving. That's parking ...

Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

TOBY

They're just cars, man ...

MEMPHIS

This Eleanor's been living at the

International Towers for 3 years now.

TOBY

Who's "Eleanor?"

MEMPHIS

The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

TOBY

Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

MEMPHIS

All the vehicles get code names.

Female names. You say "Eleanor lives

at such and such... " and no one

listening on the waves is the wiser ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

MEMPHIS

And there she is --

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Hello, Eleanor --

TOBY

It looks just like a regular Mustang --

KIP

Don't go there, Toby --

MEMPHIS

She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the

Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine

and got it legally rated for the street

at 450 horsepower ... But its actual

output is closer to 600 ...

TOBY

So she flies -

MEMPHIS

She soars -

DONNY ASTRICKY

Grade-A unicorn ...

TOBY

What's a "unicorn?"

DONNY ASTRICKY

Fabled creature. You know - the horse

with the horn? Impossible to capture?

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

We all got one. The single car

that, no matter how many times

you try to boost, something happens...

Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner

comes back. It's voodoo...

TOBY

You guys and the car thing, man --

MEMPHIS

See you in a few days, Eleanor --

MIRROR MAN

And you just stick it in the lock.

Hit this little button ... And ...

OTTO

We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...

(to Mirror Man)

Can I try -- ?

MIRROR MAN

Knock yourself out --

TOBY

I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,

right? Then I monitored their

incoming outside data requests,

right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,

right? Then I tracked them back,

right? Then I took the one I could

jack-up the easiest, right? Then I

called back see, they think I'm an

insurance company - that's where it

looks like I'm coming from -- and

they're sharing stats with this

insurance company, right? So now

they're sharing it with me, right?

They think I'm looking for stats for

an actuarial conference on auto-theft.

So they let me in, right? Give me all

these numbers. But then I don't leave,

right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I

just go anywhere I want.

MEMPHIS

So what's in there -- ?

TOBY

I can tell you who's gonna be on duty

tonight. I can tell you how much gas

they're using monthly. I can tell you

how they used to spend that annoying

half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

KIP

Good work, Toby --

FREB

It just ain't happening --

DONNY ASTRICKY

You'll get the hang of it, kid. You

just need to remember one thing -

FREB

What's that?

DONNY ASTRICKY

On boost night? Always take along a

good mix tape ...

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

You bring a woman back to your

crib for some lovemaking, the

song you put on, depends on the

woman, the type of lovemaking you

intend to do, right?

FREB

I guess ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

You got a school teacher or Nancy from

accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone

or James Brown. You put on

Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got

some wild one you just picked

up at the track, you wouldn't put on

Cat Stevens or James Taylor.

You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.

Or, if you really wanted to

get after it: Miles.

FREB

okay ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

It's the same way with cars. Different

cars. Different tunes. You can't steal

a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You

gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny

Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that

shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman

Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could

lead to disaster. Got it... ?

FREB

(absolutely hasn't got it)

Got it ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Good.

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out

and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.

I was just telling the lads about mix

tapes --

SWAY

(to Freb)

Janis Joplin. Billie Holliday. Ella

Fitzgerald...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Gender bias ...

OTTO

I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

SWAY

Good to see ya, Otto --

KIP

How ya doing, Sway -- ?

SWAY

Kip...

DONNY ASTRICKY

What do you think about all this?

SWAY

Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's

Errand", right -- ?

DONNY ASTRICKY

That's my girl --

MEMPHIS

That's Mirror Man ... And that's

Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...

Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They

call her "Sway."

SWAY

Hey -

SWAY (cont'd)

No questions. I'm here. I need the

dough.

MEMPHIS

Of course ...

SWAY

Good. Just so we understand...

SWAY (cont'd)

Oh, shit. You didn't --

DONNY ASTRICKY

Well, well, well. The original crash

test dummy...

FREB

Who's that -- ?

OTTO

That's The Sphinx.

FREB

The Sphinx?

OTTO

He never says a word. And he's got

a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.

He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like

time ...

(to The Sphinx)

Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

MEMPHIS

Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.

D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us

two days to prep ... We're going to find

the ladies on our list, find out where

they live, when they're home; that

they're properly insured ... Let's get

into the vans --

MIRROR MAN

Where we going -- ?

MEMPHIS

We're going shopping -- !

MEMPHIS

How's it going -- ?

DONNY ASTRICKY

It's arright ...

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know

who drove one of those ... ?

OTTO

Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in

McO...

DONNY ASTRICKY

That's being obscurest ... Who else?

Better known. Memphis?

MEMPHIS

Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

MIRROR MAN

For real?

DONNY ASTRICKY

For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...

KIP

Peugot convertible ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

What color?

KIP

Gray.

FREB

How you know that?

KIP

Remember who my brother is?

OTTO

DUKES OF HAZARD?

MIRROR MAN

Fuck that cracker shit --

TUMBLER

I know that one. General Lee, I

believe, was a ... Dodge Charger ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

You ever notice how it had a different

interior every week? That bugged me.

MIRROR MAN

Three words: Get A Life.

DONNY ASTRICKY

I'd like the names and addresses of

the owners of these 20 cars please...

WOMAN

It'll take me about 15 minutes.

DONNY ASTRICKY

I can wait.

FREB

Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?

KIP

Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a

gimme ...

OTTO

Yes, but what was on the license

plate?

MIRROR MAN

The license plate?

TUMBLER

I know. "ROBIN 1."

OTTO

Very good. But what was the

significance of "ROBIN 1"?

FREB

Was that his first name?

OTTO

His first name was Thomas. Thomas

Magnum...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Thomas Sullivan Magnum, to be exact.

TUMBLER

Robin 1 ...

MIRROR MAN

I know! Robin was the name of that

faggy guy who hung with him...

KIP

No. That was Higgins ....

DONNY ASTRICKY

Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

MIRROR MAN

(to Donny)

You're like a serial killer, ainchoo?

WOMAN

It's two dollars per car. That'll be

40 dollars please...

OTTO

Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on

Magnum's license plate? Memphis?

MEMPHIS

Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the

estate they lived on ...

OTTO

Ten points for our fearless leader ...

Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of

the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?

SWAY

I don't know that

KIP

Stumped -- !

FREB

Thank-God, Sway, you ain't all freaky-

deaky, too

SWAY

How about: a Corvette in

MAGICIAN; a Ford pick-up truck in

INCREDIZLE HULK, and...

OTTO

Here's where it gets tricky ...

SWAY

... he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF

EDDIE'S FATHER.

DONNY ASTRICKY

Walked like a bastard... Skippin'

stones and shit..

OTTO

That's a good one, Donny...

DONNY ASTRICKY

I think so too --

MIRROR MAN

Ya'll really need to get the fuck out

of the house more...

MEMPHIS

Hello -- ?

SWAY

Hey.

MEMPHIS

What's wrong with her -- ?

SWAY

The right side of the engine is

running richer than the left. And the

scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...

SWAY (cont'd)

You know Annie's trouble

MEMPHIS

Annie -- ?

SWAY

You haven't been studying --

SWAY (cont'd)

137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443

Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ...

MEMPHIS

Right. Great car. One of a kind. I

was looking forward to that boost

myself

SWAY

She was the only "Annie" you could find?

MEMPHIS

They only made a handful. We're lucky

there's even one living in the area...

SWAY

Yeah, well ... She lives with District

Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

SWAY (O.S.)

... and he keeps "Annie' in his

living room... Like a work of art ...

SWAY (O.S.)

She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.

Which is exactly how far away the

custom shop was in 1979 when he

bought her... He drove her home,

never drove her again ...

SWAY (O.S.)

The man's a freak...

SWAY

She's trouble --

MEMPHIS

I put the boys on it. They're clever

that way...

SWAY

I go with you --

MEMPHIS

That what you want?

SWAY

That's what I want ...

MEMPHIS

Okay.

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

I missed you, you know -

SWAY

You mentioned that in your letters

MEMPHIS

I always thought you'd follow me up.

SWAY

We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

MEMPHIS

Very good...

SWAY

Cos there were those dark days, when

I figured - my God, how easy it was

for him to just give it up; to make the

deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...

And give me up in the process.

MEMPHIS

No way ...

SWAY

No ... ?

MEMPHIS

No ...

SWAY

Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,

Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and

you're the jim that did the leaving. So

save the sanctimonious shit for someone

who believes. The only reason I ride with

you, is cause I don't want to spend the

whole night with any of them other creeps!

MEMPHIS

Oh. Okay. Right.

MEMPHIS

I'm on the move -

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Your girl works in there ...

MEMPHIS

Not my girl anymore

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Yet your still here ... I gave

you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

MEMPHIS

What do you want from me?

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Honestly? I want to - once every

few months - get into my car. Pack

a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.

On visiting day. Bring you some

magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.

And see you all bright and shiny in

your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

MEMPHIS

This one ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

What's that thing -- ?

KIP

Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little

something the R & D department came up with ...

MEMPHIS

How long were you gonna let me try and

stop it...?

KIP

After a while, it became a little pathetic ...

Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

MEMPHIS

Thank-you ...

KIP

De nada ...

MEMPHIS

Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

KIP

The family that steals together, deals

together...

MEMPHIS

Dad'd be proud --

KIP

Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

MEMPHIS

What era was that -- ?

KIP

The era when crime didn't pay --

MEMPHIS

As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

KIP

Price of doing business...

MEMPHIS

What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,

five days a week, that whole mystery

achievement -- ?

KIP

It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,

Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we

make mad bank, my boys are down, the

girlies come around and the boosts are

a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get

jacked-up every now and then - but ain't

that a small price to pay for never,

never-ever, having to say "paper or

plastic?"

MEMPHIS

We've got to shake them tomorrow

night. I'm making that your problem.

That's called delegation of duties.

You like it -- ?

MIRROR MAN

Sure, man --

MEMPHIS

Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each

team has been assigned their ladies.

The teams are: me and Sway. Donny

and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror

Man, you and The Sphinx ...

MIRROR MAN

Aw, c'mon, man ...

TOBY

What about me?

MEMPHIS

You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto

abreast of our progress ...

TOBY

How come ... ?

MEMPHIS

Because you should be home with

Nintendo, listening to The Spice

Girls, little man ...

TOBY

Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

KIP

There's no talkin' to him --

OTTO

(cup raised)

To a safe and successful session of bumping

fenders and trading paint.

BEACH BOYS

"Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put

me down But I got the fastest set of wheels

in town, etc."

CALITRI

This is how you're spending my time?

Having a sock hop?

MEMPHIS

Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the

community ...

CALITRI

Look at this. A multi-generational gathering

of scumbags ...

OTTO

So saith the God of Scumbags --

CALITRI

Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no

cars have yet to be delivered. And there's

only one more night ...

OTTO

Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I

wonder, if delivery isn't made?

CALITRI

With all the free time I've had not

counting cars as they're loaded onto

my ship, I've managed to sand the

cedar inside your box, Kip. This

will protect you from the anaerobic

bacteria, that normally thrives in

an airless; environment. Thus

prolonging decay ...

MEMPHIS

Get out of here, Ray --

CALITRI

One more night --

MEMPHIS

Get out --

CALITRI

I hope you know what you're doing. God help

you if you don't ...

DRYCOFF

Oh, this is a good time --

HAWKINGS

How much can one man smoke?

DRYCOFF

It's a crime, ain't it? Cos

Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over

this guy, I gotta get lung cancer ...

DONNY

What are you doing?

TUMBLER

Watch and learn, old-timer --

DONNY

The hell are you doing?

MIRROR MAN

Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

TUMBLER

The Hemi Has Landed --

DONNY

Big deal. Now what?

MIRROR MAN

What we call: fun and shit.

TUMBLER

We can go now --

VOICE (O.S.)

Yes, this is a message for Mr. Seymour

Croft, of 1443 Locklin ... This is the

Department of Water and Power and we're

going to be doing some work in your

area tonight ... If you'd please call

us at 555-1877, so we could discuss

the...

TOBY

Department of Water and Power. Could you hold

please ...

TOBY (cont'd)

Where should we put him?

KIP

He's a Judge. He'll only bite for

something pimpy -

TOBY

D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I

help you?

JUDGE CROFT

I got a message. I live at 1443

Locklin.

TOBY

Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?

JUDGE CROFT

NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.

KIP

Oooh, she's chafed --

TOBY

okay, sir. Let me just get the-order.

Yes. We'll be doing some work out your

way. We've got a power leak. And it's

unsafe. We're moving residences to

the... Marriott Long Beach ...

Just for the night ...

JUDGE CROFT

Oh, for God's sake

TOBY

I know, sir ...

TOBY (cont'd)

For the inconvenience we're also

offering a free breakfast brunch --

JUDGE CROFT

Breakfast brunch -- ?

TOBY

Yes, sir -

JUDGE CROFT

Okay, then ... I just go to the

Marriott and I'm set ...

TOBY

You've been pre-booked...

TOBY (cont'd)

Goodbye to you, too, assface ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

I miss Orville Redenbacher already --

MEMPHIS

Okay, okay. The important thing to

remember, is to Think Slow. Take

your time. It may not seem like it,

but the night is long. Long enough.

Just think slow and think smart...

DRYCOFF

Let's see what these bastards are up to --

DRYCOFF (cont'd)

What the fu--

DRYCOFF (cont'd)

Those little pricks -- !

MEMPHIS

How we doing, O -- ?

OTTO

Ready to start erasing. Good luck,

kiddies --

MEMPHIS

Okay. All our ladies should be home

now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly.

Think Slow. Any questions?

TOBY

You sure I can't go with ya?

MEMPHIS

Only use the phones when absolutely

necessary... Otto's default HQ ...

Let's go get 'em...

MEMPHIS

Ready -- ?

SWAY

Oh, yeah.

MIRROR MAN

You should consider always wearing that,

boy...

SWAY

No whistles, but a Club You bring a

hack -- ?

MEMPHIS

No. Open her ...

SWAY

What the hell's that -- ?

MEMPHIS

A little trick I picked up at the Car

Thief Retirement Home ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Let's cruise --

FREB

Diane 1.

DONNY ASTRICKY

Very good. Think you can get in without

waking her up -- ?

FREB

Yeah.

DONNY ASTRICKY

That's an after-market alarm. Can't

just cut her wires ...

MIRROR MAN

This is some state-of-the-art shit,

kid. The drill breaks the sockets,

which force back the spindle and release

the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be

working... And The Sphinx is getting

impatient ...

MEMPHIS

Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush,

floral-print dresses?

SWAY

Deodorant.

MEMPHIS

Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

SWAY

So, you seeing anybody?

MEMPHIS

No. I had a girl. She was great. The

problem is: great girls come along once

every ten years. So I gotta wait

another three years before I can even

bother to look...

SWAY

She was so great, why'd you leave her?

MEMPHIS

Her parole officer strongly recommended

it ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

What's the matter?

FREB

It's all microchips and shit ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

Yeah?

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)

I don't care what kind of car

it is. How fancy; how expensive;

how new. You pop the collar -

it's 1966 all over again ... !

FREB

Cool ...

KIP

So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and

dropped 'em ... It was cake ... 8 cars,

ba-da-bing ...

MEMPHIS

Having fun, Kip?

KIP

Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...

(realizes his gaffe)

I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary,

it sucks ...

MIRROR MAN

Just give me another --

MIRROR MAN

Oh, I get it: old school.

MEMPHIS

How's it going?

MIRROR MAN

It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are

swapping trade secrets ...

SWAY

It's just... so... beautiful ...

MEMPHIS

C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can

you prep 'em -- ?

SWAY

I think so... They're just... So ...

MEMPHIS

I know. But let's prep 'em. We could

stay here all night... That wouldn't

be good --

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Let's go, people --

DONNY ASTRICKY

So? Tell me: how come they call you

"Freb" anyways -- ?

FREB

C'mon, man ...

DONNY ASTRICKY

We're partners here --

FREB

My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?

One drunk night, I decided to give

myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I

used a mirror to guide me ...

FREB (cont'd)

The mirror messed me up with the "b" and

the "d"... Everything's reversed, you

know? Now, I'm "Freb."

DONNY ASTRICKY

Glad to know you, "Freberick." Let's

roll -

MEMPHIS

You okay -- ?

KIP

I'm cool.

KIP (cont'd)

We gonna make it?

MEMPHIS

Too early to tell. Nervous?

KIP

Nah.

MEMPHIS

That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.

Everyone's nervous. But not you...

KIP

I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

MEMPHIS

That's a good attitude, Kip. For

everything but stealing cars ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Showtime --

MEMPHIS

Hello, Tracy...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Shit.

MIRROR MAN

Gina -- !

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Check it --

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Oooh. "Snake." Tough guy. "Snake."

Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-!

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

No whistles ... That's weird...

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

This shit's on point. Check it: 200.

MIRROR MAN (cont'd)

Halfway there, we switch. I drive.

MIRROR MAN (O.S.)

Say goodbye to your ride, Snake...

MEMPHIS

What's this guy up to -- ?

SWAY

It's 1:30 on a Tuesday. Is that any

time to pick a girl up for a date?

SWAY (cont'd)

What, are they gonna mack -- ?

SWAY (cont'd)

Maybe she's got a roommate...

JUNIE

... that's right. They'll be in the

lobby of the Riviera Building. 2206

Beacon Street. Palos Verdes ...

MIRROR MAN

That's what I'm talkin' about -- !

MEMPHIS

... okay, check with you soon ...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Otto says 22 ladies have reported for

work...

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

Man, they're going at it

SWAY

They're in love ...

MEMPHIS

What about you?

SWAY

You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was

thinking. If she were alive. And she

asked me. If she came down, right now.

Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?

What's your life?" Innocently.

Nonjudgemental. I think it would break

her heart if I said I was a thief. I

steal cars, Gramma. And even though,

hey, I learned it all from her son.

My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics.

Which you refined. (You remember Randall,

Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,

he refined the basics ... ). I don't

think that's what she hoped for me...

SWAY (cont'd)

But ... That said... Car thieves are my

weakness ... It's all so terribly Loretta

Lynn or something, I know... But ... I

don't wanna be a thief anymore ... I don't

wanna love a thief anymore ... I want to

wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe

have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn

movies.. And think about my Gramma without

also thinking "shame on me. Shame on

me. Shame on me... "

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

It's an epidemic, Rollie ... I'm

getting reports every five minutes ...

SWAY

Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you

bellying up to my heart again, man, f

you can't help falling off the stool.

But he puts his mouth to her ears ...

MEMPHIS

Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.

MEMPHIS (cont'd)

I approach you. It's quiet. I look

this way. That. No one around ...

SWAY

Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

MEMPHIS

I take out my slim-jim...

SWAY

Oh, God...

MEMPHIS

Slip it in ...

SWAY

You're going high-cheese, dude --

MEMPHIS

Unlock your button ...

SWAY

"Unlock my button" ... ?

MEMPHIS

The alarms go off ...

SWAY

Woo-woo-wooooo!

MEMPHIS

I pop your hood; find your siren wires

SWAY

They're factory alarms ... Easy to get

around... For a man with... Skills...

MEMPHIS

I do ... I cut "em...

SWAY

Cut 'em...

MEMPHIS

Now... I'm in ...

SWAY

Of course you are. You're a

professional...

MEMPHIS

I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...

SWAY

I bet you say that to all the girls...

MEMPHIS

With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned

over ...

SWAY

Wrong preposition...

MEMPHIS

Hear you roar ...

SWAY

What about The Club ... ?

MEMPHIS

Let me worry about The Club ...

SWAY

No worries ...

MEMPHIS

I've got you floored... We're off ...

Take the curb... Man, can you corner...

Know not to get on it ... Momentum

shift ... Don't get on those brakes

too hard ... Get her up on her

tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up...

Up.

SWAY

You're still quite the boost, Randall

Raines ...

(he shrugs)

Except now I've been chopped, and my

parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven

to church in South America by some

Bolivian consulate's wife ...

MEMPHIS

And Tracy's on the move ...

SWAY

Wham, bam, thank-you, Ma'am, point-

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

Gotcha now, dickhead --

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

You gotta be fucking kidding me --

CALITRI

Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

MEMPHIS

This is number 50. We did it. It's

over Where's the money ?

CALITRI

Right there -

CALITRI (cont'd)

200 K. Just like we said ...

MEMPHIS

You should never have gotten my brother and

his friends involved ...

CALITRI

But I had to. It was the only way to

get to you --

MEMPHIS

Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away

from him...

CALITRI

I don't know about that, Randall.

He did such a good job on this paper.

And another one just came in ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two

weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to

Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

MEMPHIS

You don't want to even sniff at that --

CALITRI

Well, that certainly won't do.

MEMPHIS

What do you mean -- ?

CALITRI

Look at it. I can't very well make

delivery of that thing ...

MEMPHIS

You got no choice. It's over.

CALITRI

Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM

Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.

That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...

That was the deal ...

CALITRI (cont'd)

What are you doing -- ?

MEMPHIS

Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not

gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

ATLEY JACKSON

Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

MEMPHIS

My version of "take this job and shove

it..."

ATLEY JACKSON

Are you crazy? You throw down with The

Carpenter? You got a grudge against

your life?

ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)

Now you done it. And with you

gone - who'll save Kip the next

time ... ?

MEMPHIS

This is all about there not being

a next time, Atley --

ATLEY JACKSON

Hello, boys -- !

DIGGER

Hey! What happened? Did they make it

ATLEY JACKSON

They did not. A tragedy.

DIGGER

Mr. C. around?

ATLEY JACKSON

He's napping. He said to take it away...

DIGGER

That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

MEMPHIS

Absolutely.

ATLEY JACKSON

Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

MEMPHIS

Point-five ...

ATLEY JACKSON

Get outta here, Memphis --

MEMPHIS

Thank you...

ATLEY JACKSON

Hoo-boy.

MEMPHIS

What are you doing here?

KIP

I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.

Knew there was no way he was gonna

accept her ...

MEMPHIS

Where'd you find this one?

KIP

Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",

Memphis. Cos you never know when

you're gonna need one --

MEMPHIS

You boost her -- ?

KIP

Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

MEMPHIS

Move over ...

MEMPHIS

You okay -- ?

KIP

I dunno ... I keep thinking about

him.

KIP (cont'd)

What are you doing? You can outrun

him...

MEMPHIS

It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I know you.

MEMPHIS

You know my back.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

It's finished, Randall. Get out of

the car... You, too, kid...

RADIO (O.S.)

We have suspect vehicle matching description

at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:

the suspect vehicle has just been

apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,

190 Street and Campanza ...

KIP

I reported it ...

MEMPHIS

Not bad

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

Dispatch, what's the license on

the suspect vehicle... ?

RADIO (O.S.)

License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:

California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

10-4.

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)

Looks like we live to fight another

round. You're free to go ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)

Your brother's a clever man and a

talented thief, Kipling. But as role

models go, you should observe the man,

not the thief ...

KIP

Yes, sir ...

MEMPHIS

Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a

beautiful day, the birds are singing,

and there's a container ship on

Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I want you gone, Randall. Settle your

affairs. Make it right with those you

love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I

want you out of here. Out of here for

good this time ...

MEMPHIS

Consider me gone, Detective --

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

I'll catch you later, Randall --

MEMPHIS

Double-meaning intended --

DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK

You betcha --

MEMPHIS

Split it up. Any word on Donny?

OTTO

He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

MEMPHIS

What happened to Sway?

OTTO

She left...

MIRROR MAN

Poor Toby, man...

THE SPHINX

If his premature demise has, in some way,

enlightened the rest of you as to the

grim finish below the glossy veneer of

criminal life, and inspired you to change

your ways, then his death carries with it

an inherent nobility. And a supreme

glory. We should all be so fortunate.

You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

FREB

You spoke

TUMBLER

Say something else, man

MEMPHIS

You remember where you got this

Eleanor -- ?

KIP

Sure, man --

MEMPHIS

She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.

Give 'em sixty ...

KIP

You want me to buy her?

MEMPHIS

Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.

I've never actually paid for a car. I want

to see what it feels like

OTTO

Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is

now...

MEMPHIS

I'll see you soon --

KIP

Where you off to -- ?

MEMPHIS

Thought I'd go for a ride -

KIP

Hey, Memphis -- ?

KIP (cont'd)

I'll see you, right?

MEMPHIS

You'll see me ...

SWAY

What are you doing... ?

MEMPHIS

Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

SWAY

I can't. I got a back load of repairs

and one of the mechanics called in

sick and I haven't slept and--

(stops short; sees the new Eleanor

outside)

Where to -- ?

MEMPHIS

I dunno. I know a place.

SWAY

This time it's for real?

MEMPHIS

Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

BUTZ

Do you believe this?

DIGGER

What should we do?

BUTZ

We gotta do what we gotta do --

DIGGER

Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why

can't he finish the freakin' job?

BUTZ

Forget about it. Occupational hazard,

Digger. C'mon...

MEMPHIS

What -- ?

SWAY

Nothing. Just that if I was less

secure, I might think you were more

into Eleanor than you are me...

MEMPHIS

She does have one thing you don't.

SWAY

What's that?

MEMPHIS

Bench seats.

MEMPHIS (O.S.)

You like bingo -- ?
