MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD

Written by

John Collee & Peter Weir

1. THE OCEAN - DUSK

From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,

abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided

valleys of water.

Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the

ocean and an adjacent coastline.

In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a

small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering

darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.

2. THE SHIP - DUSK

[   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a

man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her

great guns projecting from every gun-port.

As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is

visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.

3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:

HMS Surprise

Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.

Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806

Mission: Intercept and destroy French

Privateer, Acheron

5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the

table, studying charts.

His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of

indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.

JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops

below the great casement windows.

KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and

retires.

JACK

(Absently) Thankee Killick

4. THE CHARTS:

a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.

Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,

bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then

another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.

On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and

detailed information in fine copperplate script:

6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks

(exact position unknown). Hidden reef.

6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his

pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running

from brow to chin.

He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.

BLAKENEY

In

CALAMY

Out.

BLAKENEY

In. It was here. The line is in.

CALAMY

It was there. It was out. Out

BLAKENEY

In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.

HOLLAR

Lights out!

CREWMEN

Watch there! Watch

WATCH CAPTAINS

- Lifebuoy all's well!

- Starboard gangway all's well!

- Starboard bow all's well!

JACK

How I do hate a lee shore

PULLINGS

You think we'll have long to wait?

JACK

(shrugs)

Intelligence reports had her leaving

Boston on the 12th, that should put us at

least a week ahead.

PULLINGS

She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.

JACK

In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In

for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall

have to tell the Doctor.

JACK (CONT'D)

(calls back)

Don't put her on the reef, Tom.

PULLINGS

I'll try not to, Sir.

JACK

What do you have there, Stephen?

STEPHEN

The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you

remark its prodigious strength.

JACK

I do and I am not in the least surprised,

for it reminds me of nothing so much as a

ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.

Here the mast, and here the backstays

running aft.

STEPHEN

(adds another weight)

Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing

a paper for the Royal Society.

JACK

I was thinking when our business here is

finished, we will have to put in to

Recife for provisions. You may care to

take a tour round the forests of Brazil,

botanizing and collecting specimens. An

anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

STEPHEN

I should like it of all things, Jack.

Thankyou.

JACK

Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee,

and light along my topcoat.

QUARTERMASTER

Six bells and all's well.

LEAD-MAN

90 fathoms, white shelly sand.

CALAMY

Four knots, Sir.

BONDEN

Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you

feels like putting your ead down.

VINCENT

Starboard gangway ahoy.

HOLLOM

What is it, Vincent?

VINCENT

I heard something. A bell.

HOLLOM

Native fisherman perhaps.

(shouts) Mr. Calamy!

HOLLOM (CONT'D)

The lead, if you please.

CALAMY (O.S.)

Sixty fathoms, white sand!

HOLLOM

Well. It can't have been a reef marker.

HOLLOM (CONT'D)

False alarm Mr CALAMY

CALAMY

Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to

quarters!

JACK

Where away?

CALAMY

Not two miles distant, Sir.

JACK

Mr. Hollom?

HOLLOM

I saw nothing, nor heard anything either.

Shall I ask them men to stand down?

JACK

Lie down! Everybody lie down!

JACK

Run out the guns! Marines to the tops,

and get that wounded man below!

HOLLOM

...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's

right. Run out your guns.

DAVIES

Shot. There's no shot!

JACK

Note the time Mr. Watt.

PULLINGS

She's out of our range, Sir!

JACK

Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me

alongside her at pistol-shot.

JACK (CONT'D)

Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she

bears.

PULLINGS

Fire on the uproll.

PULLINGS (CONT'D)

Fire!

OLD SPONGE

(In Greek)

Witchcraft!

DOUDLE

Never seen the like of it

PULLINGS

Damn and blast you! See to your guns!

Fire high! Fire for the masts and

rigging!

STEPHEN

More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!

DAVIES

Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!

DAVIES

Orlop! We're holed!

CALAMY

Davies! Get those bodies overboard!

(to HOLLOM)

Mr. Hollom sir!

CALAMY (CONT'D)

Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take

Mr. Hollom below.

JEMMY DUCKS

Aye, sir!

BLAKENEY

More shot! More cartridge!

JACK (bellows)

Steady... Wait for it!

JACK

...wait WAIT! And FIRE!

BONDEN

By all that's holy what is that ship made

of?

JACK

Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!

MOWETT

You must go below, Sir, you must let me

help you below!

PULLINGS V.O

Sir....

PULLINGS

It's the rudder.

BONDEN

(shouts up)

It's shot away below the waterline!

STEPHEN

Why are we not firing?

FASTER DOUDLE

No steerage.

NEHEMIAH SLADE

We're fish in a barrel

ALLEN

He's coming about, Sir.

MOWETT

Should I strike the colours?

ALLEN

I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

JACK

Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.

PULLINGS

Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what

sail you can!

JACK

Stern-chasers to fire when she's in

range!

MOWETT

Fire!

WARLEY

Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the

clew line from the reef points, Cully,

double up and run her back again!

PULLINGS

She's gaining on us.

JACK

Start the water, carronades over the

side.

JACK

Pull! Pull for your lives.

JACK

Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr.

ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to

head due east.

BONDEN

(urgent whisper)

Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!

PULLINGS

He's beating inshore.

JACK

Keep rowing

ALLEN

I believe we've lost her, Sir.

JACK

Pass the word to ship oars

LAMB

Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but

the pumps are keeping it from gaining.

JACK

Very good, Mr. Lamb.

JACK

(sotto)

What's the butchers bill?

STEPHEN

Six dead, thirteen wounded.

Your head ...

JACK

(Brushes him away)

Later.

JACK (CONT'D)

Who's this - Joe Plaice?

STEPHEN

(sotto)

A severe depressed fracture of the

skull. I am not sure he will see out the

night.

JACK

Mr. Blakeney?

BLAKENEY

Just a broken arm, Sir.

STEPHEN

I will do everything possible. I know you

were close to his father.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

One moment Jack let me look at that brow

of yours.

JACK

Its a scratch.

STEPHEN

I will tell you if its a scratch or not.

Sit down.

JACK

How did he find us Stephen?

Seven weeks sailing and he happened in

darkness on our exact position. Its

uncanny. He really is a phantom

STEPHEN

Unless she was alerted to our presence,

and looking for us.

JACK

Tosh. How could that be?

STEPHEN

The French have their spies, in Britain

as elsewhere.

JACK (astonished)

You're saying there are traitors in the

Admiralty?

STEPHEN

I am saying do not imagine it was a lone

privateer who did this to us. He is

working for Napoleon himself, with access

to all that tyrant commands, overtly and

covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too

heavily upon you.

ALLEN

...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me

she's no more a frigate than a painted

Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a

two-decker more'n a frigate.

MOWETT

One does wonder what manner of hull she

has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off

her.

PULLINGS

She had the weather-gauge and long

eighteens which could hit us beyond our

effective range. That's the sum of it

ALLEN

And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the

muzzle flashes.

PULLINGS

It was an unfair match, no dishonor in

defeat no dishonor at all.

ALLEN

(sighs)

Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen

the foresail is too far gone so we'll

bend our spare.

PULLINGS

Sir.

PULLINGS (CONT'D)

Mr. Allen is confident, with basic

repairs, we can get home as we are...

allowing for a stop in Jamaica.

ALLEN

At Port Royal we can haul her into dry-

dock, and hopefully get her home

without...

JACK

We're not going home.

JACK (CONT'D)

What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why

were we sent? To punish a blackguard

privateer who has decimated our Atlantic

whaling fleet and now threatens to do the

same in the pacific. Are we to leave

those ships to his mercy and slink back

into Portsmouth - another defeat to add

to the list. Is that what we draw our

wages for? I say we pursue her and pay

her back with interest

ALLEN

With respect, Captain, she could be half-

way to Cape Horn by the time we're

repaired and underway.

JACK

(sternly)

Then there's not a moment to lose.

KILLICK (a whisper)

We're for the Horn.

MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB

-   The Horn you say?

-   Never! In this condition?

-   Eh? What news mates

-   Heading for where?!

higgins

We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you

ask my opinion

slade

I'm game. If the captain says we can take

her we can take her.

DAVIES

Can we catch her is the question.

And if we do what's different? She'll

just hold us off with them long eighteens

til she sends us all to the bottom. All

for what?

DOUDLE

I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a

privateer, loaded with all the gems of

Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the

prize-money.

HOLLAR

Hoi there! You men jump to it!

HOLLAR

Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One

long pull. Belay!

HOLLAR (O.S.)

Two six heave! Two six heave!

JACK

Have her placed along the gunwale for

now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to

that side also.

FASTER DOUDLE

All clear below!

JACK

Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron

will be making a hundred and fifty miles

a day in this.

PULLINGS

Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping

to board the odd merchantman

LAMB

Down. Down. Stop.

LAMB (CONT'D)

Up again.

OLD SPONGE

(In Greek)

The smaller bit. No. That bit there.

BLAKENEY

No. No. Not through my nose!

CALAMY

Its alright. William. You were dreaming.

BLAKENEY

Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew

you up in your hammock with the last

stitch through your nose... to make sure

you're not just sleeping

CALAMY

You know old Joe, always telling [ ]

stories.

BLAKENEY

Is it true though? [    ] About the last

stitch?

CALAMY

Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine

first.

BLAKENEY (drifting)

Not through my nose. You'll tell them.

CALAMY

(nods)

Nor any other part of you.

CALAMY

Is it mending, sir?

STEPHEN

No, I'm afraid it will not do.

BLAKENEY

No. Mamma. Mamma.

STEPHEN

It is the laudanum speaking. You will be

a regular Nelson.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

There. I have never seen a braver

patient.

BLAKENEY

Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my

arm off.

CALAMY

You would have died else.

CALAMY (CONT'D)

Come. You can still sup your grog with

your left. And I shall take your turn at

marbles.

SLADE (shouts)

Is them his brains, Doctor?

STEPHEN

No, that is just blood. These are his

brains.

SLADE

Physician he is, not one of your common

surgeons.

FASTER DOUDLE

Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and

the strong fives, wouldn't look at you

for under ten guineas on land.

DAVIES

[   ] Knows his birds and beasts too

boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell

you what it's thinking.

JACK

Let us be off, Mr. Allen!

ALLEN

Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr

Hollom!

HOLLOM

Bear a hand there you fellows!

MOWETT

Up and down Sir, thick and dry for

weighing.

HOLLAR (O.S.)

Trice up. Lay out.

Sheet home!

Hoist away!

HOLLAR

Cheerly there in the foretop, our

William!

T'garnsl sheets!

Hands to the braces!

JACK

Speed, Mr. Boyle

BOYLE

Ten and a half knots, Sir.

KILLICK

Here we go again: scrape, scrape,

screech, screech and never a tune you

could dance to, not if you were drunk as

Davey's sow.

STEPHEN

Is that one I know, or are we breaking

new ground?

JACK

I am trying to remember that air they

played all those years ago at the

Governors house in Port Mahon. You

remember When we first met.

Corelli if I'm not mistaken.

STEPHEN

If that is your "A" you are very much so.

This is A.

JACK

Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom

STEPHEN

All I remember is you being unable to sit

in your seat the entire performance.

JACK

Aye and you practising apon that poor

bishop with your "puddings athwart the

starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant

nonsense.

STEPHEN

(laughs)

No. That was off Toulon, during the

blockade. At our first meeting they

played this:

JACK

No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom-

POM I have now

STEPHEN

(enjoying the game)

Or was it something like this....

JACK

And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging

we want!

MOWETT

Three minutes ten, Sir.

JACK

Not good enough! We must fire three

broadsides to her two. Again!

JACK (CONT'D)

Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a

gun?

BLAKENEY

As you will. Sir.

JACK

'Spitfire', hop to it.

MOWETT (O.S.)

Two minutes five, Sir.

PULLINGS

Again!

JACK

Out Tompions... Run out your guns...

Prime.

JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)

As she bears, from forward aft. Point

your guns... Fire!!

MOWETT (O.S.)

Two minutes dead.

MOWETT

One minute forty-nine, Sir!

JACK

Killick? Killick there.

JACK (CONT'D)

What do you have for us tonight?

KILLICK

Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.

JACK

Aah! My favorite.

GUN-CREWS

Boneparte Boneparte

That red-faced son of an old French fart

Hey ho, stamp and go

Stamp and go, stamp and go

Hey ho, stamp and go

PULLINGS

With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has

composed a short poem in honour of our

mission.

JACK

Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.

MOWETT

Our brotherhood, some old, some new.

In blood baptized, in strength renewed.

In purpose unified and true.

All thoughts of home forsaken.

Where duty leads us, there we go.

Nor rest nor comfort shall we know.

Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded

sunk or taken

ALL

(raising their glasses)

Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear

him! 'Sunk or taken'...

JACK

Aye and when we do take her we shall give

her to Tom Pullings as his first command.

If he don't die before then. Bumpers up

Tom

ALLEN

(A toast)

'To wives and sweethearts'.

ALL

'To wives and sweethearts'.

PULLINGS

And may they never meet.

BLAKENEY (to JACK)

I believe you knew Nelson, Sir?

JACK

Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of

serving under him at the Nile.

(aside)

Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you,

sir.

(as the bottle moves on)

In fact I dined with him twice, and he

spoke to me on both occasions.

JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)

The first time he said to me - 'May I

trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have

always tried to say it as close as I

could [   ] The second time someone had

offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night

and he said no, he was quite warm - his

zeal for his king and country kept him

warm.

JACK (CONT'D)

It sounds absurd, I know, and were it

another man you would cry out, "Oh, what

pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere

enthusiasm, but with him you felt your

heart glow.

MOWETT

(raising his glass)

To Lord Nelson.

ALL

Lord Nelson!

JACK

You see those two weevils, Doctor?

STEPHEN

I do.

JACK

Which would you choose?

STEPHEN

There is not a scrap of difference. They

are the same species of curculio.

JACK

But suppose you had to choose?

STEPHEN

Then I would choose the right-hand

weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in

both length and breadth.

JACK

There I have you. You are completely

dished. Don't you know in the Navy you

must always choose 'the lesser of two

weevils'?

ALLEN

'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick

a pocket. Dye not smoke it doctor?

STEPHEN

(poker faced)

Sure there would be some poor thin barren

minds that would catch at such a paltry

clench.

PLAICE

"...And the righteous shall inherit the

earth."

BONDEN

You hear that. He said something. Joe

spoke! Say something else Joe

JOE

Handy with that gasket

BONDEN

(shouts up to the quarterdeck)

He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke

MIDSHIPMEN

Our captain was very good to us.

He dipped his prick in phosphorus.

It shed a light all through the night.

And steered us through the Bosphorus.

TOP-MEN

Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish

ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies

of Spain...

HOLLOM

For we've received orders to sail for Old

England.

Perhaps we shall never more see you again

STEPHEN

What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom

does possess.

ORRAGE

Come all you thoughtless young men,

A warning take by me,

And never leave your happy homes

to sail the raging sea.

ALLEN

This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled

with Captain Cook and carried a pair of

Arnott's chronometers.

KILLICK

Couple of the men to see you, Sir.

JACK

(without looking up)

Show them in.

JACK (CONT'D)

What's this?

NAGEL

It were Warley's idea, Sir.

WARLEY

I thought she were familiar like, then I

remembered where I'd seen her - in

Boston, during the Peace.

JACK

[   ] In Boston?

WARLEY (nods)

Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them

working on her, something right strange

about her scantlings. Then I seen them

balls bounce off her an' I got to

thinking.

NAGEL

If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.

WARLEY

Mister Nagel here done it just like I

seen her - a third layer 'tween the

outer and inner ribbing - diagonal

bracing, see?

JACK

Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12

pounders couldn't penetrate except at

close range.

JACK (CONT'D)

Killick. Killick, there.

JACK (CONT'D)

An extra ration of rum for these men,

from my private store.

KILLICK

(shaking his head)

Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.

JACK

Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for

Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst

we're alive!

JACK (CONT'D)

He's vulnerable here.

JACK (CONT'D)

Cross her stern, rake her with a

broadside through her length. But how to

get close enough? Past those long

eighteens. That's the devil of it.

STEPHEN

He says they were chased for three days

till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun

French privateer headed due south.

JACK

Capital. Thank him and let us be off.

JACK (CONT'D)

What did he say there?

STEPHEN

A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing

arrive." New things being generally by

their nature bad.

BLAKENEY

Do you have a manual of exercises sir.

STEPHEN

Exercises?

BLAKENEY

Physical exercises, to make the left arm

as powerful as the right once was.

STEPHEN

I think that will happen with usage, at

least to a certain extent.

BLAKENEY

But not completely. I will never be whole

again, will I?

STEPHEN

No but you will adapt to your new

situation

The natural world shows us any number of

examples of how that is possible.

BLAKENEY

You know my father was a great fighting

captain. It was always his expectation I

would follow in his footsteps. I worry

that with this arm I will now be good for

nothing but book learning and philosophy.

STEPHEN

Ah. Like me you mean.

BLAKENEY

(becoming tearful)

I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot

or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress

myself. What chance to I have now of even

making first lieutenant.

STEPHEN

You have every chance. You hear me every

chance. Only the other day I heard the

captain singing your praises. Your

courage, your fortitude in battle, your

skill at logarithms and double elevations

whatever they may be. And when you are

rated lieutenant you shall have someone

to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and

help you with your jacket. Here take my

handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed

to dinner.

WARLEY

Sail on the larboard bow!

JACK

Where away?

PULLINGS

Hull down, two points off the larboard

beam.

WARLEY (O.S.)

She's a frigate all right, but no way of

knowing if she be the phantom.

JACK

Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then

wet the sails and have the idlers placed

along the rail.

BLAKENEY

Is it him, Sir?

JACK

Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy

she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin

to join us, he loves a good chase.

MOWETT

Lifelines fore and aft!

JACK

Speed, Mr. Calamy?

CALAMY

Twelve knots, Sir!

JEMMY DUCKS

We're cracking on, eh?

FASTER DOUDLE

We'll be cracking off presently if he

doesn't watch it.

SLADE

No, he knows this ship. He knows what she

can take.

PULLINGS

We can just see her topsails. She's made

her turn westwards.

LAMB

I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not

round Cape Horn.

JACK

I'll not lose her now. Set a course

westwards.

JACK

Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps

and light hawsers to the mastheads.

JACK (CONT'D)

Better get below, Mr. Pullings!

PULLINGS

What, Sir?

JACK (GRINNING)

Better get some food in you. Before it

turns nasty.

HIGGINS

You reckon Captain will keep chasing him

'round the Horn with every stitch of

canvas flying?

DAVIES

I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of

hell if he has to.

PLAICE

And that's where we're all going if he

doesn't take in sail.

JACK

Strike the topgallants.

JACK (CONT'D)

Cape Horn, Doctor!

HOLLAR (to WARLEY)

Help them with that mizzen topgallant!

You go too, Mr. Hollom!

BONDEN

Man overboard!

JACK

Swim for the wreckage, man!

JACK (CONT'D)

Reduce sail!

BONDEN

She's broaching!

PULLINGS

It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut

it loose, Sir!

JACK

Axes!

JACK (CONT'D)

Set to then. Set to!!

HOLLAR (yells below)

All hands to the pumps!

KILLICK

He's been at it again.

BLACK BILL

Who's that then?

KILLICK

The Jonah.

BLACK BILL

What Jonah?

STEPHEN

The deaths in actual battle are the

easiest.

(beat)

For my own part - those who die under the

knife or from some consequent infection:

I have to remind myself that it is the

enemy who killed them, and not me.

(beat)

Warley was a casualty of war, as surely

as if a French ball had taken him.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

(offering the wine)

At the same time....

Jack

At the same time, what?

STEPHEN

You know that I wear two hats on every

voyage. I am the captains particular

friend and supporter, but also I am the

ships doctor in which later capacity I am

party to....

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

You don't want me to continue.

JACK

(stiffly)

On the contrary. I insist on it.

STEPHEN

There is talk below decks of turning

back. Or rather that we should have

turned back some weeks ago. Of course the

men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere,

and usually in the confident expectation

of victory. But that of course is the

problem.

JACK

What is the problem?

STEPHEN

That you are not accustomed to defeat

Jack. That you have taken it too

personally. That chasing this larger,

faster ship, with its long guns, is

beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth

before destruction'?

JACK

It's not pride nor anything like it, it's

a question of duty.

STEPHEN

'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end

of discussion.

JACK

You can be as 'satiric' as you like,

Stephen, but I have my orders. She is

attacking our whalers. For why? Without

whales we have no boot polish, nor any

soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil

our sabres and muskets. Destroying our

whalers could win the war for Napoleon.

Which is why we must catch this Acheron.

As a man of learning surely you can see

that.

STEPHEN

At whatever the cost?

JACK

Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I

will calculate that myself, Stephen

without reference to your friends in the

ward room.

HOLLOM

Cast off.

HOLLOM (CONT'D)

Belay. Sorry. Sorry.

JACK

We'll have to go further south, get

around this bloody west wind.

PULLINGS

How far south?

JACK

As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The

sixtieth parallel if need be.

DISSOLVE TO -

MOWETT

Then we upon the globes last verge shall

go to view the ocean leaning on the sky

from thence our rolling neighbours we

shall know

and on the hidden world securely pry!

HOLLAR

Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble

up, tumble up - sleepers awake!

JACK

Praise be. At last.

STEPHEN

Pray what is there to celebrate?

JACK

We have made our turn northward, Doctor.

We are headed back toward the sun...

JACK (CONT'D)

...in anticipation of which. I asked

Killick to prepare something special.

(shouts off)

Killick. Killick there.

KILLICK

Which I was just coming.

JACK

Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.

STEPHEN

The Galapagos Islands.

PULLINGS

'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's

Narborough, Chatham and Hood...

JACK

That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr

Allen. So that's where the Acheron will

be headed.

JACK (CONT'D)

Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a

slice of Albermale. For you Doctor,

Redondo Rock.

JACK (CONT'D)

And, with a fair wind behind us the

Acheron for me.

JACK

Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on

these forechains... black strake needs

another coat.

KILLICK

That engagement off Recife: his whole gun

crew killed and him not a mark on him.

Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley

falls. And whose watch was it when we

lost our wind?

TROLLOPE

One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders.

STEPHEN

A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for

scientific purposes only.

STEPHEN (O.S.)

My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo.

[   ]

STEPHEN

Show me where these Doldrums lie?

JACK

Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of

you? The doldrums is a condition, not a

region. But you tend to strike 'em

here...

(pointing)

...between the trades, and the

sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is

having it as bad as we are.

STEPHEN

Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos,

and not some other point in all this

vastness?

JACK

Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted

to go there. It is said to be a natural

paradise

STEPHEN

In truth I'd be delighted with the merest

guano stained rock provided it didn't

sway beneath my feet

JACK

Well, we'll take on food and water once

we're there, and as compensation for not

having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that

during that time, several days at least,

you can wander at will, catching bugs and

beetles to your heart's delight. You will

be the first naturalist to set foot on

the islands. That is my solemn promise

STEPHEN

I accept, provided the men have not

mutinied and thrown us all overboard

before we get there.

JACK

Mutiny? No. They are already counting

their share of the prize money.

STEPHEN

Another week of this and they shall

gladly give it up for a glass of clean

water.

JACK

Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your

bellyacheing. We shall have rain

presently, and if not we shall damned

well tow ourselves out of this.

HOLLOM

Stroke. Stroke...

DAVIES (whispers)

I heard he were on the Fair Marion as

foundered off Tresco. And he were on the

Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar.

BONDEN

M-a-s-t... mast

BONDEN (CONT'D)

S-u-n... sun

STEPHEN

Is that man completely mad?

(shouts down)

Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!

HOWARD

Were you never a man for sporting,

Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in

these waters with two men loading!

CALAMY

Blakeney...

WILLIAMSON

Rye...

CALAMY

Swift...

WILLIAMSON

Boyle...

CALAMY

(the final choice)

All right, come on Addison.

CALAMY (CONT'D)

Heads.

WILLIAMSON

It's tails. We attack.

BLAKENEY

Ow ow ow!

WILLIAMSON

Yield.

CALAMY

Let go of him.

WILLIAMSON

Yield!!

CALAMY

It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in

it, just powder.

CALAMY (CONT'D)

Are you all right?

BLAKENEY

No.

CALAMY

What's wrong? I saved you.

BLAKENEY

I didn't need to be saved.

JACK

Master at arms! Take that man below and

clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings,

defaulters at six bells.

JACK

The man pushed past you without making

his obedience. And yet you said nothing.

HOLLOM

No, Sir, I intended to but the right

words just didn't...

JACK

'The right words'? He failed to salute

you. It's deliberate insubordination.

HOLLOM

They don't like me, Sir.

JACK

They what? Speak up, man!

HOLLOM

I've tried to get to know the men a bit,

Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken

a set against me. Always whispering when

I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set

that to rights, be tougher on them from

now on.

JACK

You can't make 'friends' with the

foremast jacks, they'll despise you in

the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant.

It's leadership they want, strength,

respect.

HOLLOM

I'm very sorry, Sir.

JACK

You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?

HOLLOM

(smiling weakly)

Twenty-five next Friday.

JACK

You've failed to pass for lieutenant

twice. You can't spend the rest of your

life as a midshipman.

HOLLOM

I'll try harder, Sir.

JACK

Well, it's an unfortunate business,

Hollom. Damned unfortunate.

JACK

'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not

capital, committed by any person or

persons in the fleet... shall be punished

according to the laws, and customs, of

the sea.'

(then, to NAGEL)

Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man

and yet you failed to salute an officer.

You knew what you were doing. Have you

anything to say in your defence?

NAGEL

No, Sir.

JACK

Have his officers anything to say for

him?

JACK (CONT'D)

Seize him up.

HOLLAR

Seized up, Sir.

JACK

One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON -

JACK

Red hell...

JACK (O.S.)

...and bloody death!

STEPHEN

I was merely remarking that you have

always prided yourself on not being a

flogging captain and this...

JACK

I am not a "flogging captain". I have not

once rigged the grating on this voyage,

not once in twelve thousand miles.

Besides, I wager you will find a deal

more brutality on land.

STEPHEN

I'm not a party to it on land.

JACK

Well you are party to it on my ship.

Men must be governed. Often not wisely I

grant you, but there are hierarchies even

in nature, as you've often said yourself.

STEPHEN

Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every

tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.

JACK

(trying to call a halt)

Yes. Fine words I'm sure

STEPHEN

(continues regardless)

...We are not animals and I for one am

opposed to authority, that egg of misery

and oppression..

JACK

Very fine words Stephen, but In these

current circumstances, hard-work and firm

discipline is what keeps our little

wooden world together.

STEPHEN

And grog I suppose.

JACK

Of course. What of it? Of course they

have their grog!

STEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D)

You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted

Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even

the midshipmen...

JACK

The men will have their grog Stephen. It

is part of the immemorial tradition of

the service

STEPHEN

Well a shameful tradition it is too. To

have them pressed from their homes, kept

in a permanent state of dull inebriation.

JACK

Stephen...

STEPHEN

...confined for months in a wooden

prison, Never more than a few hours sleep

and flogged when drunken idleness drives

them to....

JACK (forcefully)

...Stephen! I warn you that friend or no

I will not have you talk of the service

like that.

STEPHEN

I am stating plain facts

JACK

(finally explodes)

Well I will not hear them! From you or

anyone. You understand! Things are as

they are for good or bad whether or not

they have a place in your damned papist

philosophy. If you are here to make music

then sit down and play. If not be gone,

for you have come

to the wrong shop for anarchy!

NAGEL's MATE

Careful, sir.

BLAKENEY

Are you all right, Hollom?

CALAMY

He's not sick. He's useless. He's just

dodging work.

BLAKENEY (angrily)

Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know

about anything?

PLAICE

Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr.

Howard just shot a sea-monster!

HOWARD

Doctor! The very man.

HOWARD (CONT'D)

[   ] I wished you'd seen it for

yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen

anything like it.

HOWARD (CONT'D)

It was prodigious like a human, though

bigger, might have been a sea-elephant,

it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to

hit the calf, I missed my mark.

STEPHEN

Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men

can't eat it or I can't dissect it,

please do not shoot every creature you

see.

KILLICK

What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.

JACK

What is that abominable noise, for God's

sake?

PULLINGS

I have no idea, Sir.

MOWETT

You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?

JACK

(untypically cutting)

The enemy cannot come on us without a

wind, Mr. Mowett.

JACK (CONT'D)

What do you make of it, Doctor?

STEPHEN

I'm sure I've never heard the like.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Perhaps it's the mother of the creature

Mr. Howard shot.

JACK

[    ] Creature?

STEPHEN

[ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly.

Though I have never known one with a cry

like this.

JACK

Bosun. Fire off some flares.

JACK

Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking

of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.

MOWETT

Perhaps some poor shipwreck?

MOWETT (CONT'D)

Ahoy! Is anyone there?

JACK

Padeen. What are you doing on the

quarterdeck?

JACK (CONT'D)

Below! All of you men below!

(to MOWETT)

Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep

with their lamps on.

BLACK BILL

Duppies make that noise.

KILLICK (indicating BILL)

See. They know all about this in Africa.

DOUDLE

What's a duppie?

BLACK BILL

That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit

can't get out. Him duppie now.

SLADE

Captain don't even know what that noise

be.

DOUDLE

Doctor neither, and he knows everything.

KILLICK

Joe here's got the most experience in

these matters, and new brains to boot,

let's hear it from Joe.

PLAICE

It's the Jonah causing it. That howling

thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship.

He's calling it up, don't you see? Every

time he's on watch the ship appears. You

wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear

any time tonight, and take us all

straight to the hot-place.

JACK

You don't think...?

BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)

It's Mr. Hollom, sir, you better come

quick.

STEPHEN

Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself.

Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen

JACK

Well?

STEPHEN

There's nothing physically wrong with

him. He thinks he's been cursed by the

0men.

JACK

Then he probably has been. Sailors will

abide a great deal, but never a Jonah.

It's like a white crow - the others peck

it to death.

STEPHEN

A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.

JACK

I desired to save you the trouble of

looking for a cure. No doubt it will all

be sorted by the morning.

BLAKENEY

Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are

you better now?

HOLLOM

Much better, thank you.

BLAKENEY

I think the creature is going away.

HOLLOM

I am sure of it.

HOLLOM (CONT'D)

You've always been very kind to me.

Goodbye, Blakeney.

BLAKENEY

Man overboard!

JACK

The fact is, [   ] not all of us become

the men we once hoped we might be. But we

are all God's creatures. If some of us

thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill

of him, or failed him in respect of

fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness,

Lord, and we ask for his.

JACK (CONT'D)

Amen.

CREW (mumble ashamedly)

Amen.

BONDEN

Strike eight bells.

QUARTERMASTER (to the marine sentry)

Turn the glass and strike the bell.

DISSOLVE TO -

LOOKOUT (O.S.)

Land-ho!

BLAKENEY

Give you joy, sir! We have raised the

Galapagos!

HIGGINS (looking)

Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks

and lizards.

DOUDLE

Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't

natural.

STEPHEN

How extraordinary.

BLAKENEY

What, sir?

STEPHEN

Those birds!

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

A species of cormorant. But apparently

flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe

that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY

The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

STEPHEN

They are a type of iguana I should think,

and therefore vegetarian.

BLAKENEY

Will you catch one?

STEPHEN

Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some

eggs.

BLAKENEY

I mean the great lizards.

STEPHEN

Oh!

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

I should think a pair of them. Then you

can present one of their offspring to the

king.

BONDEN

Ha! There's one going for a swim.

STEPHEN

No. Iguanas are land animals.

BONDEN

Not these ones.

STEPHEN (O.S.)

By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new

species in as many minutes.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

What is all that confounded bellowing?

JACK

All hands about ship!

NEHEMIAH SLADE

By your leave sir, by your leave.

HOLLAR (distant)

Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets -

mainsail haul!

HOGG

God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.

HOGG

We was coming back for fresh lines, hid

in that inlet, yonder. Black-three

master. Bit beamy and raised in the

stern.

HOGG (CONT'D)

Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil

they stole. Then the bastards...

ALLEN

(cuffs him)

No swearing on the quarterdeck.

JACK

(waves ALLEN away)

Go on.

HOGG

...Then they burnt our bloody ship and

headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.

[      ]

JACK

And her course?

HOGG

Maybe a point south of west. Following

the rest of the whaling fleet.

JACK (rising)

Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on

the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course

west sou'west.

PULLINGS

Should we not take on fresh supplies,

Sir? Those tortoises...

JACK (overlapping, impatient)

There's not a moment to lose, Mr.

Pullings.

STEPHEN

Have you forgotten your promise?

JACK

(not looking up)

Subject to the requirements of the

service, Stephen. I could not in all

conscience delay for the sake of an

iguano or a... giant peccary -

interesting no doubt, but of no immediate

application.

STEPHEN (overlap)

How can you dismiss, out of hand, the

bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that

will help to progress...

JACK (overlap)

I can see nothing on shore that will

progress our mission.

STEPHEN (overlap)

But how can we possibly know what lies

[ ] on these islands, perhaps some

knowledge that may save life, that...

JACK (overlap)

I will tell you how to save lives

Stephen. Inform me how to guide this

ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40

gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir.

STEPHEN

Well perhaps there's an opportunity to

serve both our objectives. As I

understand it you mean to go round the

end of this long island, then start your

voyage. I could walk across it, be on the

other side long before...

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

I would walk briskly, pausing only for

important measurements and almost

certainly making valuable discoveries...

JACK (interrupts)

If wind and tide had been against us I

should have said yes. They are not and I

am obliged to say no.

(with finality)

No.

STEPHEN

I see. So after all this time in your

service I must simply be content to form

part of this belligerent expedition,

hurry past inestimable wonders, bent

solely on destruction...

JACK

...you forget yourself, sir.

STEPHEN

No Jack, You have forgotten your self.

You once believed in the rights of each

individual man no matter how useless or

lowly. But it seems to me now that the

long exercise of power has brought you to

the point where even a solemn promise...

JACK

The promise was conditional.

STEPHEN

...a promise to a friend of ten years

standing who has stood by you and

supported you....

JACK (overlapping)

I command a King's ship, not a private

yacht...

STEPHEN

...across half the worlds oceans often at

risk to his own life

JACK

...and we have no time for your damned

hobbies, sir!

BLAKENEY

Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on

the deck.

BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

STEPHEN

I'm sure of it.

BLAKENEY

Were you to have walked all day on the

island, you might never have come across

it.

STEPHEN

That is more than likely, sure.

BLAKENEY

You can have it.

STEPHEN

Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.

KILLICK

No music? That's a shame

KILLICK (CONT'D)

I'll just leave the one plate then, if

himself won't be joining.

JACK

Yes, Killick. Just the one.

DOUDLE (shouting)

On deck there. Object fine on the

starboard bow.

ALLEN

Martha's vineyard.

HOGG

No, this here's from Boston. I was

married there once.

ALLEN

Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.

HOGG

What they call a Bedford Hog in New

England.

MOWETT (to JACK)

The Acheron touched at Boston.

HOGG

And it's not been in the water more than

a week.

ALLEN

One can't say with any accuracy but...

HOGG

Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on

it, and the dowels is sound.

JACK

Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.

DISSOLVE TO -

PLAICE

Have you seen the bird, doctor?

STEPHEN

I have not - no bird these many days.

What kind of a bird?

PLAICE

A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps

a prodigious great mew. He has been

following the ship since... there he is,

crossing our wake!

HOWARD

My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird

dropped low. I didn't see you there!

JACK

Calamy! Get Higgins!

(then turning to BONDEN)

Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.

STEPHEN

It's all right, I am quite capable of

walking.

STEPHEN

You will just make it worse... by

prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got

at... except by opening me up.

HIGGINS (a whisper)

The bullet took a piece of shirt in with

it. Unless it is removed it will

suppurate and fester.

JACK

Are you equal to the task?

HIGGINS

I'll need to read up on the Doctor's

books, like. Study some pictures he has,

get my bearings. Be better on land, but

I'll manage somehow.

JACK

You men get about your business.

JEMMY DUCKS

...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down,

running west. It may be a couple of days

before we can catch her.

PULLINGS

It might be the Acheron. If we put on

more sail we'd come up with her before

nightfall.

PULLINGS (CONT'D)

(to his back)

Do you wish me to set the topgallants?

(no reply)

Sir?

DISSOLVE TO -

HOLLAR (O.S.)

...Clap on now! Every rope an end...

Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You

grass-combing lubber!

MOWETT

(shouts outside)

Davies! Slade!

MOWETT (CONT'D)

Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move

you onto a stretcher?

STEPHEN

Tell me this wasn't on my account?

JACK

(dead pan)

No. It was because of Higgins.

(beat)

Can't have him poking around in your

belly without a solid platform to work

on.

JACK

All set, Higgins?

STEPHEN

Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.

STEPHEN

(To Jack)

[ ] You are sure you have a head and a

stomach for this kind of thing?

JACK (smiles)

My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and

wounds since I was a little boy.

STEPHEN

Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when

I give the word.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

You will have to raise the rib, Higgins.

Take a good grip with the square

retractor. Up. Harder, harder.

(to himself)

Snip the cartilage.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure.

Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier.

Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

There she is.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Is that all of it?

HIGGINS

Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.

STEPHEN

Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the

retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain,

while I swab.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON -

STEPHEN

My goodness, what is this?

BLAKENEY

Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing

some collecting for you. The beetles each

come with a specimen of plant they were

found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There

he goes.

BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks.

Captain says we can keep them in the

chicken coop.

BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

And I made a few notes if you want to see

them.

STEPHEN

'Pon my word you have the makings of a

true naturalist.

BLAKENEY

Well sir, perhaps I could combine them,

and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist,

like yourself?

[   ]

STEPHEN

Shall we take a tour of your aviary?

BLAKENEY

Should you really be up?

STEPHEN

Yes. Padeen!

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

(To Blakeney)

How long does the Captain intend that we

stay here, do you know?

JACK

Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great

hurry.

STEPHEN

But surely, we must make haste for the

Marquesas?

JACK

It may not have been the Acheron that we

sighted. Nor can we be sure of her

destination.

(looks away)

No, I think we shall go home now, before

peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

STEPHEN

But how will it sit with the Admiralty?

To have spent six months in a fruitless

pursuit and then come home empty-handed?

JACK

"Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What

about these plants and animals which

Blakeney has been collecting? The British

museum will need an entire new wing for

'em.

STEPHEN

I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a

debt I can never repay.

JACK

Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something

prickly and hard to eradicate.

STEPHEN

A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise:

Testudo Aubreii!

BLAKENEY

Doctor, would you think it very

unscientific of me to ride on the back of

one of those tortoises.

STEPHEN

No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an

experiment of absolutely vital

importance. But afterwards, I do desire

to find that flightless cormorant,

assuming that is what it is, and that I

still have strength enough to catch it.

BLAKENEY

Sir, you must hurry!

STEPHEN

A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any

ship's captain.

BLAKENEY

You must carry him, Padeen!

BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

Leave them! We must get back to the ship.

JACK

I forgot to ask you - did you see your

bird?

STEPHEN

I did not. My greatest discovery was your

phantom.

JACK

Indeed it was, I'm sorry...

STEPHEN

(waving the magnifying glass)

Not a bit of it. William and I made a

unique discovery.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY (beaming)

It's a rare phasmid, Sir.

JACK

A phasmid?

BLAKENEY

It's an insect disguised as a stick.

BLAKENEY (CONT'D)

In order to confuse a predator.

JACK

Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint

we have. I want six men with brushes

slung over the side.

(moving on)

Doudle!

DOUDLE

Yessir.

JACK

Get your sail makers working on this.

Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet

every seven feet.

DOUDLE

Aye, Sir.

JACK

(to HOGG)

Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire

in it.

(shouts)

Mr. Calamy!

CALAMY

Aye, Sir.

JACK

Once we're underway, replace some of the

sails with the oldest, most patched set

we have.

CALAMY

They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll

need some men to move all the clutter.

JACK

Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The

more mess the better.

CALAMY

Haul away!

HOGG

There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.

JACK

You've got good eyes, Hogg.

JACK (CONT'D)

Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west.

(to PULLINGS)

We'll drop below the horizon and come up

on the other side of him, let him think

he's seen us first.

STEPHEN

I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's

clothing

JACK

A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave

me the idea.

STEPHEN

I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.

JACK

No? Well this one is.

CREW MEN AD LIB

Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is

there a skirt comes with it?

BLAKENEY [ ]

It's all right. Permission to boast.

You're to lead the boarders from the

forecastle. Congratulations.

CALAMY

Thank you.

BLAKENEY

You'll make lieutenant out of this.

BOYLE

He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant

Peter Calamy.

BLAKENEY

[       ]

Then I'll see you at the forecastle,

'Lieutenant'.

CALAMY

That's not your station.

BLAKENEY

But naturally I'll board with you?

CALAMY

I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.

RYE

She's seen us!

MOWETT

She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give

the order?

JACK

No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but

panicky and disorganized, like a whaler

might do.

JACK (CONT'D)

No offence, Mr. Hogg.

JACK

(to Mowett)

Run up Portuguese colours.

(then down to the gun-deck)

Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.

BLAKENEY

May I speak with you, Sir.

JACK

No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers

here.

BLAKENEY

Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding

party, I wanted to say -

JACK

(interrupts)

I know what you want to say and my answer

is no. I promised your mother I would

return you in one piece and I have

already failed her on that score. You

will command a gun and then retire to

defend the quarterdeck here with Dr.

Maturin.

BLAKENEY

But sir -

JACK (cutting in)

Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney.

JACK (CONT'D)

Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow

gunner, Mr. Pullings.

JACK (CONT'D)

Start the water and throw some barrels

overboard.

JACK

(plus the men ad lib)

We're a long way from home. (Right you

are, Captain!) A long way from anywhere,

(Too true!) But if Britain rules the

waves she rules these waves too. (Right

she does!) And the blow we shall deal for

his Majesty here will be felt just as

keenly (I'll say it will) aye - and

cheered just as loudly ('specially by the

wimmin!) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or

Cape St. Vincent.

JACK (CONT'D)

I don't say it will be easy. She's twice

the men we have and they'll sell their

lives dearly. But every man here is worth

three of Boney's privateers, and I know

there's not a faint heart among you.

CALAMY

Three cheers for the Captain.

MEN (deafening)

Huzzah huzzah huzzah!

KILLICK

I took the liberty, Doctor.

STEPHEN

[    ] Thank you, Killick.

JACK

Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in

order.

MOWETT

A poem, Sir?

[   ]

(after a moment's reflection)

'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art,

To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,

MOWETT (CONT'D)

Then might I, with unrivalled strains,

deplore,

Th'impervious horrors of a leeward

shore.'

MOWETT (CONT'D)

'Transfixed with terror at th'approaching

doom...'

JACK

What!

MOWETT

(apologetic)

...they were only people of the merchant

service, of-course, Sir.

JACK

We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the

Portuguese colours and run up the Jack...

Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports,

and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away

aloft.

JACK

Helm's a lee!

JACK

Run us down her larboard side then cut

across her wake!

(shouts down to the gun deck)

Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're

broadside on!

JACK

Fire as she bears! Every gun to

concentrate on her mainmast!

PULLINGS

On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as

you sight her!

JACK

Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!

JACK

Fire at will!

JACK

Lay me alongside!

JACK

Boarders away!

CALAMY

Look to our quarter-deck!

Calamy

This way! Follow me!

JACK

Where is your captain? Ou est votre

capitaine?

JACK

Le Capitaine? Where is he?

DOCTOR

Il mavait prie de vous donner ceci.

CALAMY

He's dead, sir.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON -

CALAMY

I'll do it.

HOLLAR (O.S.)

Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble

up! Tumble up!

HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Sleepers awake!

JACK

John Henry ALLEN...

Joseph NAGEL...

William Horner...

Stephen Winston Boyle...

and Lieutenant William Blakeney

We therefore commit their bodies to the

deep, looking for the resurrection of the

body, when the sea shall give up her

dead...

Amen.

ALL

Amen.

JACK

Signal... 'Parole prisoners

Valparaiso'...

WILLIAMSON

You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?

JACK

No. Captain Pullings.

RYE

....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God-

speed, Captain Pullings.'

STEPHEN

Shall we begin?

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.

JACK (smiles)

Thinking about their captain. A great

seaman, whatever you may say of him. The

doctor said he was killed by our first

broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,

face to face.

STEPHEN

Maybe you did.

JACK

What?

STEPHEN

While I was tending the prisoners they

told me their doctor died of fever, two

weeks ago. There was no doctor on that

ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you

will find one there now.

STEPHEN (CONT'D)

Shall we?

KILLICK

That's the last of the cheese and like as

not they'll leave it seizing to their

plates with their tweedly tweedly

tweedly.

JACK (O.S.)

Killick? KILLICK THERE!

KILLICK (projecting)

Which it will be ready when it's ready!

JACK

You're still missing your cormorant...

flightless eh...well then. It will still

be there when we come back
