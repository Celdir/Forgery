1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1

Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,

illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning

against an alley wall.

He is waiting.

Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.

They size each other up as best they can.

FIRST MAN

MacLeod.

The second nods.

The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended

thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash

of metal severs the agressor's head.

2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2

A 15th century Scottish home.

A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,

stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag

a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot

of grey soup.

From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up

in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.

MOTHER

My, but are you the

picture.

CONOR

(surveying himself)

It's a bit tight.

His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.

FATHER

Ah, Conor, how you look

a man.

MOTHER

Have you time for some-

thing to eat?

CONOR

No, Mother.  They'll be

here shortly.

Conor's father looks him over with pride.

FATHER

Your grandfather wore

that in his service to

the King, and I to fight

for the Duke.

MOTHER

Must he go?

FATHER

Aye.  It is his duty.  All

of ours.

MOTHER

But Ian, he's still but a boy.

FATHER

He's a MacLeod.

CONOR

I'll be fine Mother.

3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3

Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to

the cottage door.

Conor's father steps out to meet them.

4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4

A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-

ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the

heather-carpeted slope to him.

CLANSMAN

They march.

KNIGHT

Is the boy among them?

CLANSMAN

Aye.

5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5

The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.

With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.

6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6

The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.

Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The

low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There

is an erie, smothering silence.

VASSAL #1

Is a bad day for this.

VASSAL #2

The Duke has been compro-

mised.  He will have his due.

VASSAL #1

By day's end he will have

our heads.

VASSAL #2

We ride against the Suther-

lands.  That is all that

matters.

VASSAL #1

This makes no sense to me.

CONOR

And a friend are marching through the moist heather.

FRIEND

The fog is bad.  We cannot

even see the sides of our

own ranks.

Conor's nervousness is showing.

FRIEND

Is this your first?

CONOR

Aye.

SHOUTING is heard on the plain.

FRIEND

It's begun.

7  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7

The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.

He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.

8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8

The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan

and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-

citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.

The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with

his opponent.

THE KNIGHT

Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those

that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.

He is looking.

CONOR

Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.

Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.

He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.

Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.

The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned

to panic, Conor turns and flees.

The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his

horse into persuit.

Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight

brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing

open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into

the heather.

As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in

time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.

THE KNIGHT

Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the

boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.

KNIGHT

There can be but one.

A CLANSMAN

Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him

nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.

The battle is shifting to where they are.

Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself

forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-

ants.

A VASSAL

Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted

Knight.

VASSAL #1

Leave him!

The clansmen obey.

With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the

Knight disappears into the fog.

The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a

moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.

The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.

9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9

A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.

The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his

sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.

AN OFFICER

Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER

switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley

in a harsh glare.

MAN IN ALLEY

For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad

in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.

The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively

for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the

alley.

OFFICER #1

Kevin!  Get is a backup.

TAUPIN

I was merely walking by

when-

OFFICER #1

Don't move.

The officer has his pistol out and leveled.

His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.

OFFICER #2

They're on their way.

His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.

OFFICER #2

Christ.

VASSAL #1

Has the boy died?

CLANSMAN

He is having the last rites

now.  It should be over by

morning.

VASSAL #1

Never seen anybody cut as

bad live so long.  He should

have died on the field.

CLANSMAN

Tonight or tomorrow, it's

all the same.

EXAMINER

(studying body)

Real clean.  No sawing

action at all.  Whatever

it was did it in one

swipe.

(looks up at Moran)

Like the other one.

MORAN

What about that?

EXAMINER

Hasn't any blood on it.

MORAN

(looking around)

About the only thing

that doesn't.

EXAMINER

I'll give it a closer

look when I get back.

OFFICER #3

Come on Brenna, you know

better than that.

BRENNA

I'm invited.

BRENNA

(greeting)

Mr. Levine...

EXAMINER

Hope this isn't past your

bedtime.

BRENNA

Doesn't have a head,

does he?

EXAMINER

This one came unassembled.

MORAN

(no warmth)

Just show her what she came

for, Tom.

EXAMINER

(stands, taps Brenna's arm)

Come on, this is more

your line of work.

EXAMINER

How's your uncle?  I hardly

ever see him anymore.

BRENNA

Fine.

EXAMINER

There you go.

EXAMINER

Didn't look like it came from

"Toys-Are-Us", that's why I

called you.

BRENNA

(looks up in Moran's direction)

Didn't think it was my

buddy over there.

EXAMINER

Figured you knew more about

swords than I did.

BRENNA

Claymore.

EXAMINER

Huh?

BRENNA

Scottish claymore.  Take

a French epee, add twenty

pounds of ballast so it

means business, and you've

got a claymore.

EXAMINER

You're the expert.

BRENNA

(runs hand along hilt, slightly

confused)

It's in good condition.

13  INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM                                  13

MORAN

This your present address?

TAUPIN

Yes.

MORAN

Mr.-

(looks at license)

Taupin, what were you

doing in that alley?

TAUPIN

I was walking by when I

heard a shout.  Your men

came right after.

MORAN

Did you know the victim?

TAUPIN

No.

MORAN

His name was Iman Fasil

if that jogs your memory.

TAUPIN

It doesn't.

MORAN

He was carrying a Syrian

passport and had been in

the country less than a week.

MORAN

Two days ago a Bulgarian

national was murdered the

same way.  He'd also been

in the country less than a

week.

(beat)

What is your citizenship?

TAUPIN

American.

MORAN

Do you make a habit of

hanging out in that neigh-

borhood at night?

TAUPIN

What are you getting at?

MORAN

Let's just say that in my

years with this department

I've seen more than one well

dressed business man look for

a hand job on 14th Street.

MORAN

What were _you_ looking for?

TAUPIN

That's none of your business.

MORAN

You're wrong.

MORAN

Do you know what this is?

TAUPIN

I presume it's a sword.

MORAN

A claymore to be exact.  You

wouldn't know anything about

it would you?

TAUPIN

Your murder weapon?

MORAN

It was covered with Mr.

Fasil's fingerprints, but

none of his blood.

TAUPIN

A mystery.

MORAN

For the moment.

MORAN

All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in

touch.

Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

TRAVELLER

I only just heard of Conor.  I came

up from Catroch as soon as I could.

MOTHER

You're a kind man to be sure.

TRAVELLER

I thought it only proper to pay

me last respects to the family.

MOTHER

Steven, Conor didn't die.

TRAVELLER

But I had heard his wounds were

mortal.

MOTHER

They were Steven, they were.  It's

been a miracle it has.  He lasted

right through and healed.  No one

in the village has ever seen anything

like it.  Ever.

CONOR

You're pretty today.

CONOR

I'm your future husband, remember?

MARA

I have no future husband.

CONOR

I don't understand.  Not a week

ago your father gave us his blessing.

MARA

My future husband died in battle

against the Sutherlands.

CONOR

What are you saying?  I'm standing

here as real as you.

MARA

You cannot be real, Conor.  You had

the last rites.  No man has been cut

half as bad and lived.

CONOR

But I did live.

MARA

Live?  In less than a week you're

prancing about the country like a

squirrel.

CONOR

So why the crazy talk?  It's a

miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has

smiled on me.  On us.

MARA

Some think not.

CONOR

Who?

MARA

There's rumor in the village.

Some call it magic.

CONOR

That's mad.  Surely you don't

take their word?

MARA

I don't know, Conor.  It's not

natural.  Maybe something has

touched you.

CONOR

You're sounding like that mad

woman, Widow Baggins.

MARA

Me father has taken back my

hand.

CONOR

Ah, Lassie...

MARA

Please not be touching me, Conor.

CONOR

I'll not take that kind of talk

from you.  From those others

below, maybe.  But not from you.

MARA

Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.

CONOR

You're not talking sense, Mara!

CONOR

I'm sorry.

CONOR

If you send me away now, Mara,

I'll not come looking for you.

MARA

(crying)

Do what you must.

TAUPIN

Yes.

BRENNA

Very traditional.

TAUPIN

Miss Cartwright, what is it I can

BRENNA

I'd like to ask you about the

claymore.

TAUPIN

It's not mine.

BRENNA

It's quite rare you know, some-

thing so common in its time so

well looked after all these years.

TAUPIN

Miss Cartwright, unless you have

come here to sell the sword,

there's very little I can help

you with.  Now if you will excuse

me, I have a great deal of work

to do.

BRENNA

Byzantine?

TAUPIN

Basil the II.

BRENNA

Charming guy, Basil.  Once after

beating an army of Serbians he

blinded all but-

donkeys back home.  Now if you will

please-

SUPERVISOR

Why?

BRENNA

He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I

think he's got something to

do with it.

RESEARCHER #1

Oh, has your penetrating research

on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos

suddenly made you an expert on the

criminal mentality?

BRENNA

Screw off, Larry.

RESEARCHER #2

The cops bought it.  They let him

go.

BRENNA

What could they hold him for?  I

think they're just waiting for

something concrete before they

haul him in for real.  We should

look into it.  He had to have

gotten that sword from somewhere.

SUPERVISOR

Hang on a sec, you did your little

favor for the boys downtown, I'm

sure your uncle and the rest are

perfectly capable of taking it

from here.

BRENNA

I've seen nobleman swords that

weren't as well preserved.  It's

just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why

would he be carrying it around

in an alley?

RESEARCHER #1

Here we go.  Everytime there's a

murder in town we have to put up

with junior D.A.

RESEARCHER #2

Must be genetic.

BRENNA

Someone should check him out.

Maybe a collection somewhere

got knocked over.  He has one,

he might have two.

SUPERVISOR

You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see

the crap piled up on it?

BRENNA

Give it a rest Ned, huh?

RESEARCHER #2

Might be interesting to see what

his family connections are.  That's

a hell of a piece to be just chuck-

ing around in an alley.

SUPERVISOR

I swear to God Brenna, between you

Here we are, Richard Taupin.

KIDELL

Would you like more tea?

BRENNA

No thank you, I'm fine.

KIDELL

He was unsual.

BRENNA

Why?

KIDELL

Well, this is a small town, and

it was even smaller then.  Most

all the babies I delivered were

from local families.  Richard's

parents were just passing through

when his mother's time came.  I

did it right here at the house.

BRENNA

Then you didn't know Richard

later on.

KIDELL

No.

BRENNA

I've been trying to find somebody

who knew him and any connections

his family might have had with

museums or historical societies.

KIDELL

Don't know about any of that.

Suppose nobody does.

BRENNA

I don't follow you.

KIDELL

Poor little tyke didn't have a

chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He

died a few days after he was born.

BRENNA

The boy _died_?

KIDELL

Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The

young lady just couldn't make it

through labor.  Never even saw her

son.

KIDELL

My brother worked for the town

paper at the time.  He took this

picture of the funeral.

BRENNA

Have you spoken to anyone else

about this?

KIDELL

There was this one fella.  Asked

a lot of questions.  I was out

of town but I heard he spent near

a full day in the records office.

BRENNA

Would you remember his name?

KIDELL

Now there's a new topic.

UNCLE JOE

Don't they have enough for you to

UNCLE JOE

Forgers do it all the time.  They

take the birth certificate of some-

one who died young and use it to

get legit I.D.  Usually they carry

checks then dump it.

Thanks.

BRENNA

I can't figure out why he's doing it.

He's been Richard Taupin at least

since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You

should see the stuff he has in that shop.

DENNIS

Maybe he's hiding from something.

BRENNA

Some guy named Smith was asking

about him in Church Hill.  I passed

his name around with your buddies

downtown but they drew a blank.  So

he isn't a cop.  District anyway.

DENNIS

Probably just some exec ducking

an ex-wife.

BRENNA

Dr. Kidell had a picture in his

file of the funeral.  The father

looked just like Richard.  Even had

a mark on his cheek.

DENNIS

How old is Richard?

BRENNA

P.D. says 41, but he barely looks

30.

DENNIS

Find the father.  That should clear

things up.

DENNIS

Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran

picked up the other night?

BRENNA

Yeah.

DENNIS

He'd want to know about all this.

BRENNA

Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his

own clues.  There's a journal article

in this somewhere.

DENNIS

(shakes head)

Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't

get the taste out of her mouth.

DENNIS

Well, the cream of society awaits.

Grave robbers?

Probably.

TAUPIN

People like that rarely leave

BRENNA

Does Carl Smith?

TAUPIN

I don't know what you're talking

about.

BRENNA

I think you do.  Better yet, I don't

think anything was stolen because

nothing was there in the first place.

And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is,

now knows that.

TAUPIN

You have an active imagination.

BRENNA

I've been to Church Hill.

TAUPIN

Miss Cartwright, you are

involving yourself in

matters that do not concern

you.  I strongly suggest you

return to Washington and stay

out of small town cemetaries.

BRENNA

I could find him.

I have friends.

Please go to no trouble.

Your back, it would seem

CONOR

Five years past me clan

I was nearly killed.

ROMIREZ

But you lived.

CONOR

I did at that.

ROMIREZ

And but for a mark you are

well as any man, no?

CONOR

Aye.

ROMIREZ

I should imagine that your

recovery must have alarmed

your fellow villagers, perhaps

giving them reason to invent

an explanation.  And a solution.

CONOR

I was driven out.

ROMIREZ

And now you live in a small

village miles away from all

you knew.

CONOR

How can you know this?

ROMIREZ

(tone lightens)

First food, no?  A good meal

makes conversation so much

easier.

ROMIREZ

Hmm, que rico.  What is it you

call this?

CONOR

Pheasant.

ROMIREZ

You Scots have a way with

game.  It still has life in it.

Spirit.  Back home the food

CONOR

Why are you here?

ROMIREZ

I was sent by his majesty of

Spain to Inverness as a con-

sultant on matters of metal.

CONOR

You're a long way from Inverness.

ROMIREZ

In my travels I heard the story of

the MacLeod boy struck down and

brought from the hand of

death by powers not of this Earth.

CONOR

You know me home.  Me name.

ROMIREZ

It was time for our paths to cross.

ROMIREZ

You see this?

ROMIREZ

When I was a boy a cart driven

by a drunken fool crushed me.  All

thought I would die or be maimed

for life.  But I healed quickly.

And like you I paid the price

for being different.

CONOR

You are the same?

ROMIREZ

Do you ever feel a flow, as if some-

thing were pushing against you?

CONOR

Yes.  Always.

ROMIREZ

Does it change with me in the room?

CONOR

It is less.

ROMIREZ

You feel you know me.

CONOR

I don't know why.

ROMIREZ

We are brothers.

You and I Conor, we are different

ROMIREZ

All living things pay dues,

Conor.  They must be respected

for that.

ROMIREZ

As they age they contribute to a

sum that is the kindling from which

all future life comes.  To feel it,

to know it, is to be in touch with

the will of every living thing.

CONOR

I do not think I like the sound

of that.

ROMIREZ

It does not feel nearly as frightening

such feelings can be very frightening.

For it gives you great strength.  The

strength of _knowledge_.  The ability

to stand between the giving of what

be.

CONOR

I feel hardly nothing.

You have not been fully trained.

But you will learn.  And you will be

CONOR

But why be so concerned about me?

ROMIREZ

This power is divided amongst you,

me, and others like cuts in a pie.

But the cuts are not equal.  Some,

like you and he, have more.  Much

more.

CONOR

And you?

ROMIREZ

I am a small player.  But if by

helping you I can keep that monster

from being the last, then perhaps

my life has meant something.

CONOR

I am not ready for this.

ROMIREZ

You must be.  You have responsibilities.

You must learn the rules.  You can never

attract attention to yourself, never

show the side that will draw others to

you.  You will always know when you are

in the presence of another.  Beware.

But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will

be your battle against time.  In the

coming years you will see kingdoms rise

then rot like wheat.  People will

become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The

only constant you will know will be

the others and the tradition their

greed and quest represent.  But life

without morality, without the ability

to truly taste the sweetness of wine

and love, is no life at all.  That is

how the others exist.  Nothing more

than walking corpses living only to

slaughter each other in an insane quest

to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed

to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

CONOR

Of course.

ROMIREZ

You are young, inexperienced.  You

do not know what time can do.  How

it can sap all pity, all love.

Too bad no one else did.

BRENNA

It's bullshit.  Everything.

My job, the people I get

involved with, I'm up to here

with it.

LIBRARIAN

You always were hard to

impress.

BRENNA

Who is it?

LIBRARIAN

Not who.  What.  Worstick's

BRENNA

What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough

excitement in your own desk?  What the

hell were you looking for in mine?

MORAN

A murder.

BRENNA

You better have a warrant.  That's

my notebook, you've got no right

to be sticking your fingers into it.

MORAN

I've got a morgue filling up with

bodies.  That's my right.

BRENNA

What do you want from me?

MORAN

Well, the man of the hour that we

all would like to talk to about now

has apparently skipped town.

(looks at notebook)

And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's

ambulence chaser is an expert on

missing persons.

BRENNA

I'm calling an attorney.

MORAN

You and I should talk first.

BRENNA

We've got nothing to say.

MORAN

What are you going to tell them?  That

you're protecting a man who's

killed four people?

BRENNA

Four?

MORAN

All fashionably without heads.

BRENNA

Spare me the details.

MORAN

But there's more.  Wednesday someone

played javelin with the cemetary

curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some

locals spotted two cars with D.C.

plates and surprise surprise, they

turn out to be registered to our

own Brenna Cartwright and the ever

popular Richard Taupin.

BRENNA

What are you getting at, Moran?

MORAN

You've been a busy little beaver.

Especially with that records mess

up in Church Hill.

(looks at notebook)

Your notes are very complete.

Naturally my feelings were crushed

when you didn't rush right over

and tell us what you knew.

(looks up)

In fact, we're considering book-

ing the ambulence chaser as an

accessory to murder.

BRENNA

It'll never stick.

MORAN

But we might just give it the

'ole college try.  What with the

court back ups, it could be days

before you got an arraignment.

But then, I'm sure the flunk-out

neice of the D.A. knows all about

that.

BRENNA

You're an asshole, Moran.

MORAN

I want Taupin.

BRENNA

What makes you so sure he's

the one?

MORAN

Just for laughs we raided wonder

boy's house.  There was a gallon

of one of the corpse's blood in

his carpet.  I think it was about

then I withdrew his name for

humanitarian of the year.

BRENNA

What's all of this got to do

with me?

MORAN

What were you doing in Felton?

BRENNA

Research.  If your pal was there

I never saw him.

MORAN

I have witnesses that can put

the two of you together.

BRENNA

(knows he's bluffing)

Never take up poker, Detective.

MORAN

Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck

can be sliced as fast as anyone

else's.

BRENNA

Why don't you wait until it comes

out in paperback?

DENNIS

I warned you.

BRENNA

Go to hell.

Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we

Equals?

Wait.  I think we understand each

MULET

We have no understanding.

Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch

steps in 1800s period dress.  Other young COUPLES relax nearby

enjoying the warm summer's twilight.  Katherine's MOTHER shuffles

between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like.

KATHERINE

Do it again.

She is thoroughly charmed by Conor.

CONOR

All right.

Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers.  By turning his

hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the

outline of a lion..

CONOR

A lion.

Katherine is delighted.

Conor starts to remove the yarn.  Katherine touches his arm.

KATHERINE

Oh please.  Another one.

CONOR

KATHERINE

Something pretty.

Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a

CONOR

I said you best leave.

YOUNG MAN

You'd like that, wouldn't you?

Ask him about his friends.  The

ones he meets in the town square.

Ask him about the blade he keeps

Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.

CONOR

Leave.  While you still can.

The youth pushes away from the grasp.

YOUNG MAN

You don't frighten me.

CONOR

I should.

The young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked.

Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks

the young man gasping onto the ground.

Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm.

KATHERINE

No!  Leave him.  Please don't hurt him.

Please.

COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers

away.

YOUNG MAN

He's not what you think.

He turns and runs down the road.

YOUNG MAN

He's not what you think!

Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.

An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and

strung paper into a small town party.

TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a

decidedly un-period ROCK BAND.

The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking

crops or Pennsylvania politics.

BRENNA

Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters

with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape.

His clothes fit perfectly.

Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.

MR. NORTH

Mr. Taupin!  Glad you could make it.

Best get some punch before it's

gone.  Near the whole valley showed

up.

They go to the table.

Taupin pours a glass of punch.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.

WOMAN

If I didn't know better I'd say

William Taupin.

TAUPIN

His son.  Richard.

MR. NORTH

Mr. Taupin is up from Washington

to look over his father's estate.

WOMAN

Your father died some years ago.

This is your first visit?

The tone is snide.

TAUPIN

Of sorts.

WOMAN

I suppose a Taupin had to show

up eventually.

(walks away)

TAUPIN

Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on.

BRENNA

What was all that about?

MR. NORTH

Sorry Mr. Taupin.  That's not meant

for you.  Just some didn't take

much to your father.

BRENNA

Why?

TAUPIN

My father was never one for social

whirls.

MR. TAUPIN

Kept to himself for sure.  Then with

all that business in '31.

BRENNA

What business?

MR. NORTH

Family down the road from the

Taupin place was murdered.  All

cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two

strangers were also found with

the bodies.  No one ever accused

William, but with his reputation

as a loner and the rumors about

him and some of the wives in town,

folks just never forgot.  Most

were relieved when they heard he'd

died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin.

TAUPIN

Nothing to be sorry about.

MR. NORTH

Just your pappy scared some.

The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's

uniform takes the microphone.

PORTLY

All right, the kids have had their

fun.  Now it's time for a little

more traditional dancing.

The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS.  With

a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles

and hammer dulcimer.

The costumed guests take to the floor.

BRENNA

I don't know any of these.  I'll

make a fool of myself.

TAUPIN

Follow me.

Taupin starts into it with perfect grace.  A faltering Brenna

tries to keep up.

BRENNA

William Taupin seems to have left

his mark.

TAUPIN

Yes.

BRENNA

And you are William

Taupin, aren't you?

TAUPIN

Yes.

They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud.

BRENNA

You're using your son's

name.

TAUPIN

No.  Just the child of

some lonely girl I gave

a ride to.  When they

died I put them in a

grave with my name on it.

Twenty years later I

became the son.

Brenna is staring at him.

TAUPIN

More punch?

He leads her to a table.

BRENNA

Then you must be at least

70 years old.

TAUPIN

At least.

BRENNA

That's impossible.

Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across

the room.

103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103

A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at

a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist.

It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying

only a long, narrow case.

104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104

Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.

BRENNA

It's frightening sometimes the

way you talk about other people's

lives.

TAUPIN

A factor of age.

BRENNA

I hope I never get that old.

TAUPIN

You won't.

Brenna pulls away.

BRENNA

I must be insane.  Leaving work,

ditching cops.  All to follow a

murderer.  A very old murderer,

but a murderer just the same.

TAUPIN

Why are you here?

BRENNA

I've been telling myself it's the

award winning journal article I'm

going to write.  But it's not.

(looks at him squarely)

It's you.

TAUPIN

I see.

BRENNA

I'm not even sure why.

TAUPIN

Hardly a reason to run off with

a murderer.

BRENNA

My life has been chock full of

people with complications and weak-

nesses.  I can't stand it.  But

you're different.  It's in your

hands.  A clarity.

TAUPIN

You are a very perceptive young

woman.

BRENNA

Just a little crazy.

A thoughtful pause.

TAUPIN

Miss Cartwright, it's time I

showed you something.

105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105

Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall.

Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press

from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.

TAUPIN

(gestures to interior)

Miss Cartwright?

Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and

switches on the light.

106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106

Brenna's expression changes to awe.

The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.

Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian

fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras

crowd the shelving and floor space.

The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had

taken the time to keep a scrapbook.

BRENNA

My God.

The sight is overwhelming.

TAUPIN

I had this room built some

time ago.

Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along

its intricate weaving.

BRENNA

Who are you?

TAUPIN

That would be difficult to explain.

BRENNA

I'd like you to try.

Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its

shoulders.

TAUPIN

I was born Conor MacLeod in the

village of Ardvrek on the High-

land plain of Strathnaver in the

clan of MacLeod under the King

of Scotland.  On the eleventh of

December, 1408.

He replaces the icon.

TAUPIN

I have served in the armies of

twelve nations, married nine

women, fathered thirty-eight

children and buried them all.

Taupin walks along the cases.

TAUPIN

I carried that rifle in World

War I.  This book is a 16th Century

policy report for the King of

Austria.  The diploma is my con-

ference of degree in Latin from

Trinity College.  Class of 1672.

(beat)

It goes on.

BRENNA

That's why Smith called you

MacLeod.

TAUPIN

Yes.

BRENNA

He knows about you.

TAUPIN

He is older than I.

BRENNA

What could possibly be worth all

this murder and distruction.

TAUPIN

Sometimes I think it's just for

something to do.  A conquest to

be the last.  Something to hold

onto while everything else around

you withers and blows away.  Some-

thing to replace the love that can

never work.

BRENNA

That's insane.

TAUPIN

Perhaps.  There is something more.

An inheritance.

BRENNA

Of bodies.

TAUPIN

I didn't kill the watchman.

BRENNA

You killed those other two.

TAUPIN

Not the same.

BRENNA

What about that family in '31?

TAUPIN

Sometimes innocents become involved.

BRENNA

You and your buddy make a real

team, don't you?  Exchanging

eloquent threats in iambic pen-

tameter while hacking up all

the innocents in between.

TAUPIN

There are differences.

BRENNA

You kill with your left hand?

TAUPIN

I haven't killed _you_.

BRENNA

Is that a threat?

Taupin moves very close.

TAUPIN

No.

Brenna's face softens.  She turns away.

BRENNA

Don't.

TAUPIN

Come here, Brenna.

BRENNA

Damn you.

He kisses her.

DISSOLVE TO:

107  EXT. TURN OF THE CENTURY CEMETARY - DAY                       107

RELATIVES in period dress watch as a family member is lowered

into the ground.

A very OLD WOMAN stands stoically, supported on both sides by

her middle aged SONS.

MINISTER

May God commend into his kingdom

the soul of our dear departed

Jason, son of Katherine-

The old woman.

MINISTER

And brother to Howard and James-

The two middle aged sons.

CONOR

Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.

THE OLD WOMAN

As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees

Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief.

Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor.

Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony.

CONOR

Watches the woman approach but decides against moving.

She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

OLD WOMAN

You.

CONOR

Katherine.

OLD WOMAN

What are you doing here?

CONOR

I owe him this.

OLD WOMAN

He never knew you.

The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old

woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons

old enough to be his father.

SON #1

Is something wrong, Mother?

OLD WOMAN

Howard.  James.  This is your

father...

DISSOLVE TO:

108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108

Taupin and Brenna lie together.

Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the

countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds.

Taupin strokes her softly.

TAUPIN

"Brenna".  In Celtic is means

"woman with raven hair".  Only

chieftan's daughters were allowed

it.

Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars.

BRENNA

What is it like?  Being you?

TAUPIN

Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that

would kill you and fear of those that

would love you.  It can never last, and

in the end you always end up destroying

both.

BRENNA

But you're known so much.

History I'll only read about.

TAUPIN

It's all the same.  Half lives that

never go away.

BRENNA

What is it you want?

TAUPIN

All of it finished.

109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109

Taupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload

of documents.

TAUPIN

Gettysburg's an hour's drive

at most.  You should be back

by nightfall.

BRENNA

Will I see you again?

TAUPIN

Be careful.  Don't stay any

longer than you have to.

Pause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly

into the car.

TAUPIN

Good luck.

110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110

Detective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars.

MORAN

Are you sure?

INSPECTOR

Won't know till the

records department comes

back with it this after-

noon.  Looks good though.

They found the receipt

in his townhouse.  It was

pretty smeared but had

Taupin's father listed

as a signatory.

MORAN

Round up who you can

and put them on standby.

INSPECTOR

Think we should call the

local P.D. out there

first?

MORAN

No.  I want this to be

all ours.

111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111

Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.

CLERK

O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's

all I need.

The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her.

CLERK

Just take this down

the hall to the regis-

trar.  Hurry up though,

it's near closing time.

Most everyone's gone

home already.

A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.

112  INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE                                       112

Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS

sit in an office mostly cleared of employees.

Brenna hands the slip to a clerk.

CLERK #2

I'll be right back.

She disappears into the rear area.

BRENNA

(to other clerk)

Do you have a drinking

fountain?

CLERK #3

Around the corner.

Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her

reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling

with her hair.

THE CLERK

Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the

counter top and looks around the office.

The second clerk is also gone.

Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk.

She steps over to it.

It is a large blood stain.

Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors.

They're closed.

Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them.

She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight

walking to her with his stained sword.

With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and

runs down an opposite corridor.

THE KNIGHT

Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM

of his palm.

BRENNA

Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing

the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for

a way out.

The Knight is nearly upon her.

In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing

its heavy door.

THE CLOSET

Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING

is at a PANIC.

THE KNIGHT

Tries the door handle.

Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into

the wood.

BRENNA

(crying)

Oh God...

He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround-

ing walls.

BRENNA

Go away!  Oh God, go

away!

CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far

wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.

THE KNIGHT

Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.

Brenna SCREAMS.

The door collapses.

113  EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING                                        113

A group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light

of day.

114  INT. CAR                                                      114

At the wheel is Moran's assistant, the inspector.

114  INT. HOME - NIGHT                                             114

Taupin stands at his fireplace, the only light in the room,

poking at it with a tong.

His gaze goes to a mantle clock.

It is 10:30 PM.

The phone RINGS.

He looks to it.

It RINGS again.

He picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear.

KNIGHT'S VOICE

We have some unfinished

business.

TAUPIN

Are you here?

KNIGHT'S VOICE

I want you to come to

me.

TAUPIN

And if I refuse?

KNIGHT'S VOICE

Give me an address where

I can forward Miss Cart-

wright's head.

This affects him.

KNIGHT'S VOICE

Yes laddie, I have her.

TAUPIN

Should I care?

KNIGHT

You have three hours.

115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115

The unmarked cars shoot by.

116  INT. HOME                                                     116

Taupin hangs up the phone.

He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight.

117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117

POLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING

shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols.

Two officers take positions on either side of the door.  A

third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open.

118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118

The officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The

room is empty.

119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119

An officer BURSTS in.  It's empty.

120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120

The Inspector is on the phone.

INSPECTOR

He's not here.

121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121

Spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding

blackness.

Taupin's face moves into frame.

122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122

Sword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps.

123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123

A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his

quotations.

A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands

at the statue's base.

KNIGHT

Welcome.

Taupin stands at the entrance.

KNIGHT

Kahn sends his best.

In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of

death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly

to the Knight and Brenna.

TAUPIN

Let her go.

KNIGHT

You disappoint me.

(looks at Brenna)

I thought you'd finally gotten over

that sort of thing.

TAUPIN

Leave her out of this.

KNIGHT

As you wish.

KNIGHT

You can do better than that.

124 EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                124

BOY

It's from over near the memorial.

BOY

Shit.

KNIGHT

(to Taupin)

Get up.

TAUPIN

What's the point?

KNIGHT

This isn't done.  Get up.

TAUPIN

What's the point!  You have me,

finish it!

KNIGHT

I have waited forever for this.

You will not cheapen it, little

boy.

TAUPIN

(irony)

Tradition.

KNIGHT

It's all we have.

TAUPIN

Go to hell.

KNIGHT

Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like

to play.

TAUPIN

Leave her alone.

KNIGHT

Get up.

131 EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          131

BRENNA

You bastard!

KNIGHT

Be silent.

BRENNA

Leave him alone.

KNIGHT

You will be silent!!

KNIGHT

I do hope you're enjoying this

as much as me.

KNIGHT

Get out.

KNIGHT

This is nothing that concerns you.

KNIGHT

You will leave!

TAUPIN

(hoarse)

Don't.

TAUPIN

Stop.  You don't understand.

TAUPIN

In mamus tuas Domine commendo

spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum

in nomine Domine.

TAUPIN

Requiescant in pace.

BRENNA

My God.

BRENNA

Conor.

KNIGHT

And now you know.

BRENNA

What's wrong?

TAUPIN

I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't

stand it!

TAUPIN

The scream of your blood.  The

shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it!

BRENNA

What is it?

TAUPIN

I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the

_last one_!

TAUPIN

Get out.

BRENNA

No!

TAUPIN

I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed

everything I've ever touched!  Oh

God...

BRENNA

Conor...

TAUPIN

_Get out_!

136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     136

BRENNA

(after a moment)

What are we supposed to say?

TAUPIN

The emptyness.  The years and years

of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only

by the quest for ultimate nothingness.

Who would have guessed?

BRENNA

The inheritance.

TAUPIN

Not power.  Not control.

TAUPIN

Life.  It is the gift and the under-

standing of life.

BRENNA

You have lived forever.

TAUPIN

Life is only life when it is bounded

by death.  The inheritance is death.

The gift is the finality of life.

To be part of the fabric.  The inside.

(turns to Brenna)

I love you Brenna.

TAUPIN

It will be horrible.  The future.  I

may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows.

I can promise you nothing.  Nothing

but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment

of love, is that not worth a lifetime?

BRENNA

(crying)

Yes.

TAUPIN

It's taken me so long.  So very

long.
