VOICE

Cataleya!

MOTHER

Cat! Is your homework finished

yet?

CAT

Working on it Mama.

MOTHER

You draw beautifully my love, but

if you want to be something in

life you have to study.

CAT

I am studying Mama. I want to be

a super hero.

MOTHER

Better to be a doctor. A lawyer.

CAT

Are we going to see Uncle Emilio?

2.

MOTHER

I don't know. Just waiting to

hear from your father.

CLOSE ON

DON LUIS

I can't believe this.

FABIO

Why not?

DON LUIS

Because I love you Fabio. Like a

brother.

FABIO

And I love you Don Luis. Like a

brother.

DON LUIS

Can you believe this guy Marco?

We started when we were little...how

old were we Fabio?

FABIO

Ten.

DON LUIS

Ten year old bastards stealing

apples from the carts in the market.

After all we've been through.

And now we're on top, he wants to

leave...

FABIO

Luis, I'm going to be honest with

you. You remember I had that

operation?

3.

DON LUIS

That was last year.

FABIO

Since then, I'm not a hundred

percent. And you can't do this

thing if you're not a hundred

percent. I'm tired.

DON LUIS

So you'll take a rest.

FABIO

You know how many times we should

have been dead?

DON LUIS

I don't even want to count.

FABIO

Neither do I. But you gotta think.

How lucky we are to still be alive.

DON LUIS

Yeah. That's right. We're alive.

And what about the future of this

thing we built?

FABIO

It's yours. It's not my thing any

more.

DON LUIS

I'm not going to talk you out of

it, am I cabron?

FABIO

I'll always be there for you Luis.

Just pick up the phone, I'm there.

DON LUIS

I'm gonna hold you to that. You

bastard.

(EMOTIONAL)

I'm going to miss you.

FABIO

And I'm going to miss you.

DON LUIS

OK. Enough of this sentimental

bullshit. Next we'll be crying

like two old women. Come on! One

last drink, huh?

DON LUIS

To the future.

4.

FABIO

Bueno.

DON LUIS

So. Business is all clear?

FABIO

All clear.

FABIO

It's all here.

DON LUIS

No other copies?

FABIO

You even have to ask?

DON LUIS

Hey.

FABIO

Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't

get in too much trouble.

MARCO

Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.

DON LUIS

Kill this motherfucker.

FABIO

This fucker! The motherfucker!

5.

DRIVER

Not OK Boss?

FABIO

This bastard thinks I'm an idiot.

Playing it all mellow and shit.

If he would have yelled and screamed

and threatened to kill my whole

family, it would have been OK. We

have an hour to get out of here.

At most.

MOTHER

Fabio?

FABIO

We've got ten minutes.

MOTHER

(PANICKED)

Cataleya, go pack!

CAT

I'm packed Mama.

FABIO

Listen to me my darling. Just in

case of anything. This...

FABIO

This is your passport. Do you

understand?

6.

FABIO

You find yourself alone? You go

to the address on this card. Show

it to the man at the front gate.

CAT

I don't understand papa.

FABIO

You don't have to understand. You

just have to listen, and remember.

MAN

(polite. smiling)

Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.

BODYGUARD

He's not home.

MAN

You mind if we wait?

BODYGUARD

Your time.

FABIO

And this will keep you safe.

FABIO

The Cataleya orchid. It comes

from one place on Earth. Our place.

My mother, your grandmother, used

to grow them. Every morning I

would wake up to the sight of them.

The smell of them. That's why I

named you after them. It reminds

us of who we are.

7.

MOTHER

I'm ready.

MAN

They said he's not home yet.

MAN

OK. OK.

MAN

Change of plans.

FABIO

Back!

FABIO

Too late. Get ready!

FABIO

I love you very much.

CAT

I love you too Papa.

8.

FABIO

Alicia!

MARCO

You in the kitchen. You, the

bedroom. You, the back.

9.

MARCO

Hey! What are you doing?

GUNMAN

Don Luis said kill everyone.

MARCO

He also said no names.

GUNMAN

She won't remember.

MARCO

HEY!

MARCO

She's a kid.

GUNMAN

So what?

MARCO

What do you mean so what? You

take a kid, teach them, they have

value.

GUNMAN

I couldn't even get ten bucks for

her in the street.

MARCO

Are you stupid or what? Here.

MARCO

Here's twenty asshole. Go do your

job.

10.

MARCO

(SOFTLY)

Remember me Cataleya?

MARCO

I was at your confirmation. My

name is Marco, and I was a very

good friend of your father. I see

he gave you his medal.

MARCO

The Cataleya orchid. His symbol.

Your name. That's good. This way

you will always remember him.

(BEAT)

I know this is a terrible thing

for you to have seen.

MARCO

Some things are too complicated

for a kid to understand. This is

one of them. But I am going to

try explain it and make it very

simple for you. So you understand.

Now, you know who Don Luis is?

MARCO

Of course you do. He was your

father's best friend since they're

kids. He's like an Uncle to you.

You know he has always been good

to your family, don't you?

MARCO

This house, the food you eat, the

clothes you wear. Even your school

fees. All this comes from Don

Luis. You know that?

11.

MARCO

But when someone is good to you

and you are not good to them back,

then bad things happen. Things

like...

MARCO

This.

MARCO

I know you are a smart girl. You

do well in school. So I know this

is not too complicated for you to

understand. Am I right?

MARCO

Good. Now, your father had

something that belonged to Don

Luis. A little thing. No bigger

than...

MARCO

This. Maybe it was in this.

MARCO

Do you know what I am talking about?

MARCO

Excellent. Do you know where it

is?

MARCO

Well, if you give it to me, Don

Luis will be very grateful. And

very generous. He will make sure

that you are clothed, fed, and

sent to the very best school. You

will have everything you want.

(MORE)

12.

MARCO (CONT'D)

But if you don't give it to him,

he will be very unhappy. And you

see what happens when he is not

happy, yes?

MARCO

So why don't you just give that

little thing which belongs to him.

Will you do that?

MARCO

You are a smart girl.

MARCO

And in this life, smart girls get

everything they want. What do you

want Cat?

MARCO

Just tell me sweetheart...what do

you want?

CAT

(in his ear)

To kill Don Luis!

MARCO

AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!

MARCO

Get her!

We are making our final approach

to Miami International airport.

Please fasten your seat belts.

Come with me.

BUREAUCRAT

She's the one?

MAN

She is indeed.

BUREAUCRAT

You must have done something pretty

important to get the royal treatment

little lady.

BUREAUCRAT

Welcome to America.

MAN

You like music?

VOICE

It's been our mission statement

since we first opened our doors in

nineteen twenty three...

HEADMISSTRESS

To provide a safe, healthy nurturing

environment where young women can

get the education they will need

to meet the challenges of that

amazing adventure called life.

How does that sound to you, my

dear?

MAN

It's been a long day for her.

Here's the check for the year's

tuition.

23.

MAN

And the five hundred dollars

allowance for the first six months.

HEADMISSTRESS

Which we keep right here...

HEADMISSTRESS

And give you twenty a week for

incidentals.

HEADMISSTRESS

What do we say darling?

CAT

Where do I sleep?

MONITOR

Girls, this is your new classmate.

Please welcome her and show her

the ropes.

(TO CAT)

Wake up is at seven. Sweet dreams.

SHERRI

I'm Sherri. And you are?

CAT

Very tired.

24.

SHERRI

Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you

want to lay down and rest your

little head?

CAT

I do.

SHERRI

There's your bed...

CAT

But it's gonna cost you.

(BEAT)

Twenty dollars.

SHERRI

A week. Peace has it's price,

y'know what I'm saying?

SHERRI

Are we clear on that?

CAT

Twenty dollars a week.

MAN

Hey kid. You know what time it

is?

28.

MAN

It's late, and this is not the

kind of place a kid should be

hanging out. What are you doing

here?

MAN

Who are you?

CAT

Cataleya.

MAN

Wait here.

MAN

Emilio.

MAN

There's a girl looking for you.

EMILIO

I'm not interested in a girl right

now.

29.

MAN

It's not that sort of thing. She's

eight.

MAN

Says her name's Cataleya.

MAN

Come with me.

MAN

Hey!

30.

EMILIO

Cataleya?

CAT

Uncle Emilio?

EMILIO

Madonna! I thought you were dead!

EMILIO

I thought you were all...

EMILIO

You're safe now.

EMILIO

You're safe.

31.

EMILIO

Gracias mama.

EMILIO

Good morning.

MAMA

Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit.

I'll make you some eggs.

MAMA

You have your mother's beautiful

eyes. Don't be scared. This is

your home.

EMILIO

When was the last time you slept?

CAT

I don't know. A long time ago.

EMILIO

Well good. A growing body needs

sleep. When I was your age I would

sleep half the day. I don't know

if it helped with the growing, but

I was well rested for whatever

came after.

CAT

Whose room is that?

EMILIO

My son. Your cousin.

CAT

Where is he?

32.

EMILIO

He's dead.

CAT

Killed?

EMILIO

Yes.

CAT

By who?

EMILIO

No one who is still alive.

EMILIO

You are very talented. Is this

what you want to be? An artist?

CAT

I used to want to be like Lara. A

super agent.

EMILIO

Not anymore?

EMILIO

And now?

CAT

(matter of fact)

I want to be a killer.

CAT

Can you help?

EMILIO

Sure.

33.

EMILIO

The good news is your father bought

you your life with what he gave

you. The bad news is Don Luis was

playing both sides, and has

disappeared. You tore down

everything he spent years building

up with that little chip. It is

something he will not forget.

There is a law in this thing of

ours. If someone does you, the

revenge goes all the way down the

line. Women, children,

Grandmothers, dogs, cats. No

exceptions.

CAT

Are you trying to scare me?

EMILIO

I am trying to educate you.

PRINCIPAL

Normally we don't accept students

in the middle of the academic year,

but under the circumstances, losing

her parents in that tragic car

accident...

PRINCIPAL

Here.

PRINCIPAL

These are the school supplies you'll

need.

EMILIO

She's still in a bit of shock.

PRINCIPAL

Of course. See you Monday Cataleya.

Such a pretty name.

34.

EMILIO

We'll get all this stuff, then go

over to this little place I know

down on Maxwell street for some of

these hot dogs the Polish people

make here.

EMILIO

You like hot dogs?

EMILIO

Hey!

EMILIO

Hey!

EMILIO

Where you going?

CAT

I've already been to school. I

told you what I want to be. You

don't want to help me, fine. I'll

do it myself.

EMILIO

Chica. Any idiot can be a killer.

Look!

EMILIO

You want me to teach you to be a

killer? No problema. I'll teach

you. But you'll be dead in five

years.

(MORE)

35.

EMILIO (CONT'D)

If you want to be a killer, and

survive, you have to be a smart

one. You have to know things

besides how to pull a trigger.

You have to know how the world

works. How people think. You got

to learn to be psychological.

That I cannot teach you, unless

you learn the basics at school.

Got it?

EMILIO

Now what's it going to be?

CAT

But I still want to be a killer.

EMILIO

(SIGHING)

Cabron!

12 YEARS LATER

COP 1

So then I suggest, y'know, we buy

some things to spice it up a bit.

COP 2

Define things.

36.

COP 1

A garter belt, some of those

stockings that come up the

thigh...it's fourteen years. Know

what I mean?

COP 2

Yeah. No matter how much you like

steak, sometime a lamb chop is not

a bad thing.

COP 1

Exactly.

SUPERMODEL

Oops...

That's all you have to say? Oops?

Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll

give you something to laugh about!

SERGEANT

No license, no registration. No

ID except a library card. Well

Ms...

SERGEANT

Valarie Phillips in addition to

all that...you're being charged

here with DUI, destruction of police

property, driving the wrong way on

a two way street...

CAT

Is that it?

SERGEANT

Unless you can think of anything

else you should be charged with.

CAT

(TIPSY)

Wearing no panties?

38.

SERGEANT

That's not a crime.

CAT

Thank goodness.

SERGEANT

Take her in the back, lock her up,

put a cup of coffee in with her.

Let her sleep it off, we'll book

her tomorrow.

MARSHAL

US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro

Rizzo here on an overnight.

SERGEANT

Who?

MARSHAL

Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way

to testify up in San Francisco

tomorrow? They didn't notify you?

SERGEANT

Hold on a second.

39.

SERGEANT

Here we go. Says here you're not

expected until tomorrow.

MARSHAL

Never expect the expected Sergeant.

(to his men)

Secure this place.

MARSHAL

One man here. Two more outside the

front door. Everyone else on the

perimeter, in teams of two.

MARSHAL

It's a caffeine kinda night fellas.

Eyes open.

MARSHAL

Holy shit! Call Ross.

MARSHAL

Agent Ross?

ROSS

Where is he?

MARSHAL

At the hospital.

ROSS

Let's go.

CAT

I shouldn't drink.

49.

SERGEANT

No you shouldn't.

CAT

I'm so so sorry.

SERGEANT

Tell it to the judge at your hearing

in ten days.

CAT

What's going on out there?

SERGEANT

Nothing. Fill out the forms and

you can go.

CAT

Really?

SERGEANT

Really. We need to get things

organized. But don't worry, the

judge will send you back, for sure.

CAT

I probably deserve it.

ROSS

Same handwriting. Same flower.

It's him. Let's see the location.

SERGEANT

You're lucky no one was hurt.

CAT

I would have never forgiven myself.

50.

REPORTERS

Is it Rizzo? Was it an

assassination? Are there any clues?

Is it true a Marshal did it?

ROSS

No comment.

ROSS

You didn't lock it down?

MARSHAL

It was after the fact. I didn't

think...

ROSS

Do it. Now. No one in or out.

MARSHAL

OK! That's it. No one in or out!

Lock down!

ROSS

I want to see paper on everyone in

and out of the station in the last

twenty four hours.

51.

ROSS

And I want the tapes from the

security cameras.

EMILIO

Are we good?

CAT

We're good.

EMILIO

When are you back?

CAT

Day after.

EMILIO

I have something.

CAT

The morning after OK?

EMILIO

Can't wait to see you Cara.

52.

CAT

Say hello to Mama.

EMILIO

Mama says hello back.

ROSS V.O.

See?

ROSS

He tilted the camera just enough

so the angle would catch the guard,

not who was holding him.

ROSS

Twenty two murders in four years

all with the same M.O. The word,

the flower. He's sending a message,

for sure. And I'm beginning to

think it's not to us.

AGENT 1

But we're the only ones with the

information.

ROSS

And we're not getting anywhere

with it, are we?

ROSS

If the message is not for us, let's

make sure the one it's intended

for gets it. I want you to put it

out to the press. Splash it across

every newspaper, every magazine.

National. I want eyeballs on it

coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's

see if anything comes back.

53.

MARCO

Mr. Richard...

MARCO

Been a long time.

RICHARD

Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?

MARCO

Only hurts when it's humid.

RICHARD

Should've let us relocate you to

Arizona instead of New Orleans.

MARCO

The Boss likes it humid.

RICHARD

There it is then.

MARCO

He's waiting for you.

RICHARD

Hello Luis.

54.

DON LUIS

Hello Mr. Richard.

RICHARD

I brought you the morning paper.

DON LUIS

I've seen it.

RICHARD

And...?

DON LUIS

Coincidence.

RICHARD

Coincidence? Twenty two times? A

flower that only grows in one place

on earth? That used to be the

calling card of...what was his

name? Your former partner? The

one who did your wet work?

DON LUIS

Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But

I don't understand? Why come here

with this?

RICHARD

Because when we find the end of a

string we like to know where it

begins.

DON LUIS

String? Now we are talking about

string? I'm not a tailor.

RICHARD

Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase

here, OK? When the Agency extracted

your ass from Colombia fifteen

years ago, and set you up here, we

let you resume your business when

what we should have done was lock

you up for life. In exchange, you

were supposed to keep the

information flowing.

DON LUIS

And I have.

55.

RICHARD

Not much, and not for a very long

time.

DON LUIS

And this is what you traveled all

the way down here to tell me?

RICHARD

No. What I traveled all the way

down here to tell you, is there's

a limit to our patience. The CIA

is not an amusement park. There

are no free rides. Everyone pays

their way. And you, my friend,

have not.

DON LUIS

OK OK. What would you want?

DON LUIS

I had nothing to do with this. I

swear.

RICHARD

Then find out who does.

RICHARD

And Don Luis, don't play the

innocent with us. It won't sit

well with my bosses if we find out

you had anything to do with this.

Have a good day.

DON LUIS

She's talking to us.

MARCO

It could be anyone.

DON LUIS

Idiot! I told you. Everyone dead.

Down to the dog.

(MORE)

56.

DON LUIS (CONT'D)

You screwed up the first time.

Now go fix it. Find her.

(BEAT)

Before she finds us.

IN CUTS

ROSS V.O.

Since each and every one of the

victims was a professional bad

apple...

57.

ROSS V.O.

We've narrowed motive down to

payback or preemptive.

ROSS

Rizzo here...

ROSS

The most recent, was done to keep

him from talking. Alexa

Milshinova...

ROSS

...made a career of getting intimate

with big stakes gamblers out of

Vegas and then taking them off and

sending them to meet their maker.

D'Angelo James...

ROSS

...tried to take over the heroin

trade in Houston from...

ROSS

The Gemini cartel. Their crimes

are self explanatory, if you can

read. Now I know some of you are

thinking whoever is doing this

makes less work for mother. And

since there's no collateral damage,

why are we wasting valuable manpower

and resources on the case? And

since until now, there has never

been a clue to go on, why go on?

But with this last killing...

58.

ROSS

We have one. As we go to the video

tape.

ROSS

We can't see the assassin, but we

can see...

ROSS

The time. 2 AM. Which means our

perp was in the station at...I

don't have to spell it out for

you.

ROSS

These are the names, phone numbers

and addresses of everyone with a

pulse who entered that police

station before two AM. Cops,

criminals, clerks, janitors.

Everyone. One of them is our

target. I want each of you to

locate the ten people in the folder

you've been given. I want a

complete dossier on every one of

them for the last ten years of

their lives. Run down every lead.

Check out every story. Our killer

is out there. And we're going to

find him. Before he kills again.

Don't move.

Do I have to?

Now.

Turn around.

Hello Danny.

DANNY

Hello Jennifer.

DANNY

You should have called.

CAT

Why?

DANNY

I could have been out.

CAT

I have a key.

DANNY

I could have been late.

CAT

I've got nowhere to go.

DANNY

It's just...

60.

CAT

Just what?

DANNY

You show up whenever you want to...

CAT

And then we have the most incredible

sex.

(BEAT)

Ever.

DANNY

I know. I'm just saying...

DANNY

Wouldn't you like to go to dinner

sometime?

CAT

Uh-uh. This taste good enough.

DANNY

Or a movie?

CAT

No. They put me to sleep.

DANNY

So let's pop in a DVD and you can

spend the night here?

CAT

Would you like the key back?

DANNY

No. I just want to get...I don't

know...

CAT

Closer?

DANNY

Yes. Closer.

61.

Is this close enough?

(SMILES)

...Yes.

FADE TO

Jen...?

EMILIO

Safe?

CAT

On my end. You?

EMILIO

Safe.

CAT

What do we have?

62.

EMILIO

You remember the guy who was in

the news for running that Ponzi

scheme about a year ago?

EMILIO

He disappeared fifty billion

dollars. The money was never

recovered. Skipped out and bought

himself citizenship on some shit

hole of a Caribbean island that

calls itself a country with no

extradition laws. Lot of very

pissed off people lost everything.

EMILIO

There's something else.

EMILIO

How long has this been going on?

CAT

(BLUFFING)

Not long.

EMILIO

The paper says twenty two. All

like this. Tell me why.

CAT

No reason.

EMILIO

Since you're a kid, you don't do

anything for no reason. Don't

play dumb, it insults me.

CAT

I've got to get ready.

EMILIO

It's not just you in this. It's

me, Mama.

63.

CAT

Tio. You're removed. You book

the work, you collect the fees...

EMILIO

I watch your ass. Each and every

job, I vet, I double vet. For

every one I book you, I turn down

five, ten. I promised to keep you

safe. I KEEP YOU SAFE. Cataleya.

It's a full time job, no matter

what you think. Those

pictures...they freaked me out.

OK? I didn't realize...

CAT

I come to you at nine. I say I

want to be a killer. What kind of

kid makes a career choice like

that unless they have something on

their mind.

(BEAT)

I live for the day that the blood

of the son of bitch who did my

parents drips in the gutter. Stop

playing the innocent with me. You

know this. Forever.

EMILIO

Sure. Of course. But the way

you're playing it. They even have

a name for you. The Tag killer.

I would have stopped it a long

time ago. Had I known about this.

CAT

Why?

EMILIO

Because I love you.

CAT

If you do, you would never have

let me get involved in the first

place.

CAT

I love you too.

64.

ROSS

OK. Let's try...organization...

ROSS

(FRUSTRATED)

Fuck...

CAT

Hi guys.

CAT

Hey! Hey!

CAT

OK. OK. Now sit.

65.

CAT

Now let's see what good boys you

can be.

CAT

Top cut sirloin.

CAT

Nice, huh?

CAT

Red, juicy, delicious.

CAT

Stay.

CAT

Good boys.

(BEAT)

Eat.

PEPE

Hola Cataleya.

66.

CAT

Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave

me away.

PEPE

Anyone else? The barking would

only have stopped when their

screaming began. You spoil them.

CAT

I train them.

PEPE

If that's what you want to call

it.

PEPE

Did you get the beans I like?

CAT

Of course.

PEPE

And the salsa Verde?

CAT

And the salsa Verde.

PEPE

Not the one in the short bottle.

CAT

The long one.

PEPE

I hate that other one, the chili

they use sucks. Did you see your

uncle?

CAT

Of course.

PEPE

We're going to church for Easter.

CAT

As always.

PEPE

And you?

67.

CAT

Not this year.

PEPE

As always. You should, you know.

CAT

I should do a lot of things.

PEPE

You could start with that one. It

would make us very happy.

CAT

Maybe next year.

PEPE

Cataleya. No one knows what happens

tomorrow, next year is a long time

away. How was your trip?

CAT

Rewarding.

PEPE

Passport?

CAT

Your ears are better than my eyes.

PEPE

You work too much. I keep telling

that to Emilio. The girl should

have a life while she is still

young enough to enjoy it. You

should take a vacation. Go some

place warm. With a nice beach.

CAT

Good idea.

68.

WILLIAM

GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!

WILLIAM

(SMILING)

Hey! I pay to see more, not less.

WILLIAM

That's better.

GIRL

Willie you are such a perv.

WILLIAM

I know. Anyone hungry?

GIRL

Always!

WILLIAM

Lunch is served.

SERVANT

For you sir.

69.

WILLIAM

Where did this come from?

SERVANT

It was in the post box this morning.

ANGLE ON

GIRL

Here fishy fishy!

GIRL

(POUTY)

Willie! They're ignoring me!

WILLIAM

Put a drop of blood in there and

they'll be your biggest admirers.

All the way down to your stripped

clean bones. And speaking of

stripped...

70.

WILLIAM

Bedtime!

WILLIAM

(to head of security)

Bring extra security in for the

night.

HEAD SECURITY

Yes sir.

WILLIAM

And make sure we're shut down tight.

HEAD SECURITY

Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.

WILLIAM

I intend to.

HEAD SECURITY

There are already guys in the garden

and guys out back. I want you

three upstairs, two on the roof.

You three downstairs. Follow me.

71.

WILLIAM

Hello?

72.

WILLIAM

Anybody?

CAT

Stop right there.

WILLIAM

Who are you?

CAT

Doesn't matter who I am.

WILLIAM

What do you want?

CAT

I want you exactly where you are.

WILLIAM

ARRRGGGHHHH!

WILLIAM

Whatever they paid you, I'll double

it!

CAT

You know the thing about sharks.

You can swim with them all day and

they will just ignore you, but put

one drop of blood in the water and

they become your biggest admirers.

WILLIAM

Please. I'll give you anything

you want. Don't kill me!

CAT

I'm not going to kill you.

(BEAT)

They are.

73.

WILLIAM

Please! Please!

WILLIAM

Please! Help! Help!

RICHARD

I can't believe this.

RICHARD

Yes?

VOICE

Mr. Steven Richard?

RICHARD

Who is this?

CLOSE ON

ROSS

FBI special agent Jack Ross. I'm

lead agent on a case. A serial

killer we call the tag killer.

INTERCUT

RICHARD

I've seen the publicity.

ROSS

Marks his victims with a flower.

From Colombia. A Cataleya orchid.

(MORE)

74.

ROSS (CONT'D)

When I try to access information,

I get stuck with a CIA Access denied

folder. I understand you were the

station chief down there when this

rash of murders with the same MO...

RICHARD

Listen, Agent Ross, we don't give

out any type of information over

the phone. So what I suggest is

you file a formal request with the

agency for any information you

might want. And I'll be more than

happy to get back to you as soon

as I can.

ON ROSS

ROSS

Thank you.

MARCO

Bueno?

RICHARD

No more bullshitting me Marco.

I've got the FBI on my ass now. I

want that problem taken care of.

Yesterday. Do you hear me?

MARCO

Loud and clear.

75.

ROSS

Where are we?

AGENT 1

We ID'd everyone who came in and

out of the police station for the

twenty four hours preceding the

incident. The only one that we

could not verify was a...

AGENT 1

Valarie Phillips. Picked up for

drunk driving four hours before

the hit on Rizzo.

ROSS

(STUNNED)

A woman? Are you sure?

AGENT 1

It's our only lead.

ROSS

Let's see her booking report.

AGENT 2

(HESITANT)

Well, there was a little problem.

Seems she was too drunk to get a

photo.

ROSS

But not to get prints.

AGENT 1

We ran the prints in the data base.

No match was found.

ROSS

Lovely. So if there is no booking

record, how did we get the name?

AGENT 1

A library card. The only ID she

had was a library card.

ROSS

I don't believe this.

AGENT 1

There are the surveillance tapes.

76.

AGENT 2

From three angles.

ROSS

(HOPEFUL)

Well, let's see them.

ROSS

That's it?

AGENT 1

That's it.

ROSS

It's not a lot to go on. But put

them in the data base and let's

see what matches.

ROSS

...a woman.

MARCO

Hello Eduardo, que pasa?

EDUARDO

I have fifty bucks on this shot.

That's what's que pasa.

MARCO

(SMILING)

Hey sorry. Come on.

77.

MARCO

Here. For you.

EDUARDO

For what?

MARCO

First for fucking up your shot.

Second, for an address. You

remember Fabio? The Cataleya

Killer?

EDUARDO

It's a long time. My memory...

MARCO

You went to school with his brother

in law. What was his name? Emilio?

EDUARDO

Like I said...my memory...

MARCO

I have a problem. And we think

Fabio's kid is behind it.

EDUARDO

Look Marco. I gotta be honest

with you. Everyone knows you guys

were playing a double game, and

when the shit went down, you were

the only ones who got out of it

clean.

MARCO

So you do have a memory.

EDUARDO

Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck

out, and let me take my shot.

MARCO

OK...

78.

MARCO

Fuck...

MARCO

You don't tell me what I want to

know by the count of three, you

scum sucking lowlife prick, your

memory will be permanently disabled.

One...two...

CAT

I brought you something.

DANNY

That's real progress. Let's see.

DANNY

Wow! Just what I always wanted.

CAT

You're making fun.

DANNY

No. No. I mean, a gift from you.

Something to show me you're thinking

of me as more than your boy toy.

79.

CAT

Well, there's that too.

DANNY

Wait.

CAT

You don't want me?

DANNY

Of course I do. But can't we talk

a little first?

CAT

What would you like to talk about?

DANNY

Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

Anything.

CAT

You really want to do this?

DANNY

Yes, I do.

CAT

(AMUSED)

OK.

DANNY

So...what's new?

CAT

Nothing much.

DANNY

Where have you been?

CAT

On vacation.

DANNY

Really? Where?

CAT

Down south.

DANNY

Where there are alligators?

80.

CAT

There was that one.

DANNY

Was it nice?

CAT

It was OK.

DANNY

What did you do?

CAT

Nothing much. A little swimming,

fed the fish.

DANNY

OK. Now you.

CAT

Now me what?

DANNY

Conversation. It goes two ways.

CAT

OK. Want to fuck?

DANNY

OK. OK. I get it. You want to

protect yourself. I understand.

But I'm...I don't just want to be

here for the sex. I know a lot of

guys would think this is perfect.

She comes over, we fuck like mad.

She leaves. But I need a little

more.

CAT

Like what?

DANNY

Like...uh...some trust maybe.

CAT

That's a hard one for me.

DANNY

I got that. I'm not in a hurry.

And just so you know. The past?

If it's too painful right now?

(MORE)

81.

DANNY (CONT'D)

If you can't talk about? That's

OK. But, you know, if someone

hurt you before...like a broken

heart or something. I'm not

responsible for that. I just want

want to be here for you. To know

a little about what's inside.

What you feel. Just a little.

CAT

I'm lonely sometimes.

DANNY

...And?

CAT

Isn't that enough?

DANNY

It's a good start.

DANNY

Now we can have sex.

DANNY

Let me this time.

82.

DANNY

Morning.

DANNY

I didn't know if you like your

eggs over easy or scrambled, so I

made...

DANNY

Wait...

CAT

I shouldn't have done this.

DANNY

Done what?

CAT

Any of it.

DANNY

Why?

CAT

Because.

DANNY

Can we talk about it?

83.

CAT

We already talked. I'm late.

DANNY

I made breakfast.

CAT

I don't like eggs.

CAT

Now you know something else about

me.

CAT

(TO HERSELF)

Don't come out. Please. Don't.

CAT

Sorry I'm late.

EMILIO

You said you would stop the writing!

84.

EMILIO

Read this!

EMILIO

Seven people slaughtered in a Miami

bar. I knew one of them. Years

ago, in school.

CAT

So what?

EMILIO

I don't like it. This is getting

too close.

CAT

Tio. Could be anyone. You're

seeing things that aren't there.

EMILIO

And you are so blinded by your

need for revenge that you are not

seeing things that are. The

handwriting is on the wall Cara.

Let me read it to you. This is

over. I will no longer accept

jobs. I will no longer solicit

jobs. You are retired.

CAT

How many people did you kill in

revenge for your boy's death? How

many? And you're going to give me

a lecture about revenge?

EMILIO

Cara. It's time to get a life,

before you run out of time. Here.

EMILIO

Maybe this will help you understand

what I am telling you.

Great body, killer smile.

And I think about her all day long.

RYAN

Dude, you're in love.

DANNY

You're so smart.

RYAN

Seriously. This comes from the

heart. OK?

(BEAT)

You're nuts.

(BEAT)

The girl comes over, strips down,

rocks your world, gets dressed,

asks for nothing. Leaves. The

only thing she doesn't do is bring

the pizza and beer. You are living

my dream. And you want to go and

fuck it up with love?

DANNY

I knew you were the perfect guy to

talk about this with.

RYAN

Hey come on. It's me. Since first

grade. You and me?

DANNY

Ryan, I'm twenty eight. I met

someone who I want to be with.

All the time. I have nothing. A

stuffed animal.

(BEAT)

And a picture.

RYAN

You have a picture?

DANNY

In my phone.

86.

RYAN

Give it up!

DANNY

It's not even a whole picture. I

took it while she was asleep.

RYAN

Whoa...total babe-age! When do I

meet the future Mrs. Delaney?

DANNY

Haven't you been listening to me?

I don't even know how to get in

touch with her.

RYAN

Dude. That is such a no brainer.

SHARI

You know, if you weren't my

brother's best friend...

RYAN

You're doing it for love Shari.

Not for me. When they walk down

the aisle, you can say you were

the one made it happen.

DANNY

Maybe I shouldn't...

SHARI

Up to you Danny. I do it all the

time. Photo goes in here. Bangs

around the National Data base

looking for a match. Bingo.

Address, phone number, shoe size,

dress size, rap sheet, anything

you want to know. It's really no

big deal.

DANNY

I just feel like, maybe, I'm

invading her privacy or something.

87.

SHARI

Hey guys, I haven't got all day.

(holds her hand on

the send button on

Yes or no?

RYAN

Of course yes.

I want a trace put on an incoming

No Mama. One thing at a time.

We got her! I want SWAT there!

All of them! Now!

You know it's so crazy. I was

just sitting here, looking at your

call her." And you called.

CAT

...What picture?

DANNY

I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't

have. But I have nothing to

remember you by, except this little

stuffed...

CAT

(TIGHT)

What picture Danny???

DANNY

I took a picture of you while you

were sleeping. With my phone.

DANNY

Jen. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't

mean to offend you.

DANNY

...it's just you looked so cute.

I can erase it if you want. It's

not even a good picture...Jen?

CAT

Who else saw the picture?

DANNY

Nobody. My friend Ryan...

CAT

Who else?

DANNY

His sister. I didn't want to..it's

wanted to...

I'd like to speak to the agent in

Agent Ross. Hello? Hello?

CAT

This won't take long. Hands up.

CAT

Turn around.

99.

CAT

Sit.

ROSS

Just so you know, all this? Being

so smart? Covering all your bases?

It's not going to matter. It's

already over. The whole place is

wired with web cams.

CAT

You mean these?

CAT

Talking about covering all your

bases. Your chair is pressure

wired. You move your ass one inch

you don't have one anymore.

CAT

I know what you're thinking. Maybe

yes a bluff, maybe no. But you

have to figure yes, given what you

know about me.

CAT

This wasn't what I had in mind for

myself when I was a kid. I wanted

to be on the other side of things.

Like you.

ROSS

So what happened?

CAT

He did.

CAT

This is the last time I was happy.

(MORE)

100.

CAT (CONT'D)

The next day they were dead. He

killed them.

ROSS

And all this? All these

clues...they weren't for us. They

were for him.

CAT

I didn't know how else to find

him.

ROSS

And you figured sooner or later we

would make this public.

CAT

It took you a long time.

ROSS

You're very patient.

CAT

What else do I have to be? I have

no one. I did. Until this morning.

I had them.

ROSS

You sent him a message. He sent

you one back.

CAT

And now I want to finish it.

ROSS

I can't help you.

CAT

Yes you can. He's protected by

your government.

ROSS

By a part of the government I have

no way of reaching. It's CIA. I

don't know why. But there's no

getting through it, under it, around

it, believe me, I've tried.

CAT

You're going to have to try harder.

101.

CAT

I found this on your table inside.

Your family, right?

CAT

Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews.

Mother, father. Nice.

CAT

I know this sounds harsh. But

until I get what I want, you'll go

to a funeral a week. And you will

begin to feel what I have felt all

these years.

ROSS

Wait...

ROSS

What about...?

CAT

When your dinner's ready, the timer

on it will have expired. Then you

can get to work.

RICHARD

You understand, I only agreed to

this meeting out of professional

courtesy.

side, and all that pie in the sky

crap.

The truth is, I really can't help

you at all.

ROSS

Can't or won't.

RICHARD

Same thing really.

ROSS

Look, let's put all our cards on

the table here. I've met this

woman. The killer.

RICHARD

(SKEPTICAL)

Really? Where?

ROSS

My apartment. She trapped me.

She told me if I did not get her

this man.

ROSS

She will kill a member of my family

every day until I have none.

RICHARD

You're kidding me?

ROSS

Do I look like I could make

something like that up?

ROSS

So? What should I do now?

RICHARD

I'd go to the police. Now if you'll

excuse me, I have a meeting...

ROSS

Ross.

(BEAT)

It's her.

103.

ROSS (CONT'D)

She says you either give her what

she wants or she is going to

redecorate your office.

ROSS

Bright red.

RICHARD

What does she think this is?

Amateur hour? Tell her that glass

is tempered to resist a direct hit

by a fifty seven millimeter

ordinance.

ROSS

She says she's using seven point

six two steel jacketed armor

piercing shells. And you have ten

seconds to give her the address.

RICHARD

How can I be sure once she has the

address she won't kill me anyway?

ROSS

You can't. But I can assure you

that if you don't give her the

address you will be number twenty

four on her hit parade. Trust me

on this one.

RICHARD

Eight seven six Magnolia Terrace...

New Orleans.

ROSS

She asked you to keep this

conversation strictly confidential.

RICHARD

(SWEATING)

With pleasure.

104.

ROSS

Thank you. Because honestly I

didn't know how I was going to

explain you splattered all over

your walls.

CAT

You guys ever been to New Orleans?

FADE TO

CAT

Good morning.

105.

CAT

I didn't know if you took sugar

and cream, so I got one of each.

SMITH

Who are you?

CAT

You designed the house at eight

seven six Magnolia.

SMITH

You either leave immediately young

lady or I am going to call the

police.

Cat pulls a gun.

CAT

I would love to see the plans of

this house.

MARCO

You will take up positions here...

MARCO

And here. And here. You must

expect the unexpected. She is

like mist under a door, like a

mouse in the wall. She will never

attack straight on. You will not

see her, until it is too late.

She is that invisible.

106.

MARCO

We would prefer she be taken alive.

But with a bitch like this, if you

get a kill shot you take it.

DON LUIS

Marco?

DON LUIS

MARCO!

MARCO

You four! Get the armored Mercedes!

We have to get Don Luis out of

here!

MARCO

Don Luis! This way! Everyone to

their positions!

THUG

OK! Everyone in!

107.

ANGLE ON

MARCO

Don Luis! You hide here.

MARCO

Wait for my call. Either she is

dead, or we have her far enough

away so you can make it to the

garage. Take the van. The armor

is so thick nothing short of an

atomic bomb can penetrate it.

DON LUIS

Marco. Thank you.

108.

MARCO

(TOUCHED)

That's the first time you ever

said that.

DON LUIS

Said what?

MARCO

Thank you.

DON LUIS

Don't get used to it.

MARCO

Down!

MARCO

Go!

109.

Now!

MARCO

Outside!

MARCO

Kill her!

MARCO

Checking.

MARCO

I think we got her.

110.

DON LUIS

Did you see the body?

DON LUIS

Marco??

MARCO

(INTO PHONE)

Stay where you are!

MARCO

You know what bitch? I loved

killing your father. He was a

coward! And you know what else?

I screwed your mother behind your

father's back! We all did! She

couldn't get enough of it! The

whore! I killed her! I killed

him! You want to avenge them?

The whore and the coward? That's

what you come from! Come out!

I'm here! Come get the bullet

with your name on it, Bitch!

MARCO

Kill her!

111.

DON LUIS

Marco! Marco!

MARCO

You two here! That door opens...

MARCO

...kill anything that comes through.

MARCO

Shit!

MARCO

Giorgio?

MARCO

Tonino?

DON LUIS

Marco! What the hell's going on???

MARCO

Hold on.

112.

MARCO

I will hold here! Run! Run!

MARCO

Do it! Do it you bitch! Isn't

this the moment you've been waiting

for?

CAT

Yes, it is.

113.

DON LUIS

(LAUGHING MADLY)

I beat you bitch! You can't kill

me! I am unkillable!

DON LUIS

Marco?

CAT

It's Cataleya.

DON LUIS

I don't understand you. You should

have been dead a long time ago.

You got lucky. You escaped. You

were given a second chance at a

life. Why did you not take it?

Why did you involve yourself with

this insanity?

CAT

For something you can never

understand. The love I had for my

parents. And you killed that.

DON LUIS

And because of that, you have ruined

your whole life to try to kill me?

You stupid bitch. Don't you get

it? Someone like me?

(MORE)

114.

DON LUIS (CONT'D)

I cannot be killed. I do the

killing. Not the other way around.

And now it is your turn to be

hunted. You will never find me.

But as day follows night, believe

me, I will find you. And I will

kill you. And you know why?

Because I will never be where you

can kill me. I will never be where

you want me to be.

CAT

Actually Don Luis...you are exactly

where I want you to be.

CAT

EAT!

ROSS V.O.

I want you to think hard...

ROSS

Was there anything else?

DANNY

I already told you everything.

She would come over, we'd have

amazing sex, and she would leave.

It's really late, and I'm really

tired, if you're not going to arrest

me...

115.

ROSS

We don't really have anything to

charge you with.

DANNY

Then can I go?

ROSS

Just a few more questions.

DANNY

Can I have a cup of coffee?
