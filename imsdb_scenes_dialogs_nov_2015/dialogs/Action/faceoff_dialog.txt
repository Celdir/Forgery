FACE/OFF

Written by

Mike Werb & Michael Colleary

Revised 9/10/96

ARCHER

Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.

Intelligence?

BUZZ

No, sir, nothing yet.

ARCHER

Get them on the phone -- now.

What about S.I.S. and our airport

teams?

WANDA

We've had everything from psychics

to satellites on this.  Even if

Castor was here... he must have

slipped the net by now...

ARCHER

He's here!  And we're going to

keep looking until we find him!

TITO

Jon, these people have been

working round the clock -- you

gotta cut them some slack...

ARCHER

I'll cut them some slack when I

cut myself some slack.

JANITOR

What are you doing?

CASTOR

(in perfect Spanish)

Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus

in the labyrinth -- where's the

men's room?

JANITOR

(in Spanish)

This area is off limits, Padre.

(re:  security door)

How did you get in that room?

CASTOR

Okay... I have a confession to

make, but you aren't gonna like

it.  I was planting a bomb.

JANITOR

Bomb?

CASTOR

You know -- boom --

(patting his

neck)

Oh, never mind...

CASTOR

I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.'

But your voice makes even a hack

like Handel seem like a genius.

ARCHER

(on phone)

... I don't have time to get a

warrant from some hung-over judge.

Just give me the go-ahead, Victor,

and I promise -- as soon as this

is over -- you can brand my butt

with the Fourth Amendment.

KIM (V.O.)

Sir, your wife's on line one...

S.I.S. on two...

ARCHER

Tell her to hang on --

TITO

A jet was chartered at Anderson

Airfield.  Guess who just showed

up to pay for it?  Pollux Troy.

ARCHER

Scramble the Reaction Team --

we're moving out.  And get one of

our people on that plane.

TITO

But there's still no sign of

Castor...

ARCHER

Where one brother goes, the

other's sure to follow...

POLLUX

You're 26 minutes late.  The

casing didn't fit -- right?  I

knew that cheap-shit Dietrich

would rip us off...

CASTOR

Oh, God -- !

POLLUX

What!?

CASTOR

I forgot to turn the damn thing

on!

POLLUX

You're kidding, right?

(to the twins)

He's kidding...

(grabs Castor

by throat)

... are you fucking kidding!?

CASTOR

Bro -- everything went fine.

POLLUX

I hate when you call me bro.

CASTOR

Thanks for babysitting.

LUNT

Anything else?

CASTOR

I'll contact you when we get the

rest of the money.

(turns to leave)

Oh, and stat away from downtown.

The inversion layer's going to be

pretty thick around the 18th.

CASTOR

Let's go, let's go!

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you like anything else?

CASTOR

Hell, yes...

(pulls her into lap)

It's the only way to fly.

CASTOR

What's wrong?

CASTOR

It's Archer.

(gun to Pilot's

head)

Go, dammit!

WINTERS

F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain!

ARCHER

Get out.

TITO

You're not playing chicken with

two tons of aluminum...

ARCHER

Get out!

CASTOR

What are you doing?

PILOT

The horizontal elevator's smashed!

We can't lift off!

POLLUX

Forget it -- Go!  Go!

CASTOR

Wherever they put you, I'll find a

way to get you out...

TITO

-- not unless you want that 200

I.Q. splattered all over the

floor.

(as Archer

approaches)

We got him now, Jon.

ARCHER

That's what you always say.  Seal

it off.  I'm going in.

CASTOR

Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed

by your obsessive need to spoil my

fun.

ARCHER

And how much will your 'fun' net

you this time?

CASTOR

What's it to you?  I declare it.

Here I am, back in the States for

less than a week --

ARCHER

You're under arrest.  Incredibly,

you still have the right to remain

silent --

CASTOR

I've got something going down on

the eighteenth... it's gonna be

worse than anything God ever

dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give

it up -- but my brother and I have

to walk.

ARCHER

No discussion -- no deals.

CASTOR

What're you gonna do with me

locked up?  You'll drive your wife

and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter

is just about ripe by now.  What's

her name, Janie?

TITO

Tell me he didn't get away

again...

POLLUX

Where's my brother?!  I want to

see my brother!

LAZARRO

The oversight committee would've

roasted us for this one -- thank

God it paid off.  Damn fine work.

ARCHER

Real fine, Victor.  Especially the

casualties.

LAZARRO

Classified information.  No

photographs.

LAZARRO

You okay, Jon?

(off Archer's nod)

Then go home.  Tell Eve.

ARCHER

Hi...

(no response)

... What's wrong?

EVE

She complimented for her 'F' in

history with an 'A' in

shoplifting...

ARCHER

Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the

law and I'm expected to ignore it?

JAMIE

That's right -- it's all about

you.  Don't even ask me what

happened.

ARCHER

Okay.  What happened?

JAMIE

Like you'd ever fucking believe

me!

EVE

Well, you tried.  You failed

miserably, but you tried.

ARCHER

Why won't she even talk to me?

EVE

Maybe because you taught her never

to speak to strangers.

(immediately

regrets it)

I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.

EVE

I've got patients waiting.  Try

again, Jon.  She hates you -- but

she needs you.

ARCHER

Eve...

EVE

Jon -- what is it?

EVE

Is it -- him?  It's... it's over?

ARCHER

I'm going to make everything up to

you and Jamie.  I'll put in for a

desk job.  We'll go away, get

counseling -- anything you want.

This time, I mean it.

SECURITY GUARD

Print, please.

ARCHER

Much appreciated.  Now let's get

back to work, okay?

WANDA

(to Buzz)

Is that stick ever gonna fall out

of his ass?

KIMBERLY

The C.I.A. sent this over.  What

should I do with it?

ARCHER

Send it back and tell them to stop

wasting the taxpayers' money.

Anything else, Miss Brewster?

KIMBERLY

No, sir.

KIMBERLY

Four years -- and he still calls

me 'Miss Brewster.'

ARCHER

How's Loomis?

TITO

He needs some surgery, but he's

going to be okay.  That's the good

news...

ARCHER

Go on.

TITO

... Brodie and Miller from Special

Ops need to see you.

ARCHER

I don't have time for those cloak

and dagger guys.

BRODIE

You better make time, Jon.

(hefts a disc)

We found this in the jet wreckage

-- among Pollux Troy's effects...

ARCHER

Porcelain casing... Thermal

cloak... Undetectable payload.

MILLER

Powerful enough to flatten ten

city blocks.

ARCHER

'Worse than anything God ever

dumped on the Pharaohs.'

(to Tito)

Get Pollux Troy.  Now.

DISSOLVE TO:

POLLUX (V.O.)

(on screen)

That bomb was just a crossword

puzzle to me... a mental exercise.

I never built it...

ARCHER

He's lying.

LAZARRO

He's hooked up to a full-spectrum

polygraph.

ARCHER

Pollux is a manipulative

psychopath.  He can control his

heartbeat, his sweat glands, his

blood pressure...

LAZARRO

Jon, I trust your instincts, I

always have.  But D.C. wants more

evidence.  And frankly, so do I.

ARCHER

You'll get all the evidence you

need when ten thousand people die.

LAZARRO

We'll get a team right on it.  But

we can't evacuate the city on what

amounts to a hunch.

ARCHER

That bomb has been built, it's out

there somewhere and it's going to

detonate...

IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS

OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES

IN THE LINE OF DUTY

BRODIE

Didn't Castor give any clue where

the bomb might be?

ARCHER

Only one person knows -- his

brother Pollux.  And he'll keep

his mouth shut until it blows.

BRODIE

We could plant an agent in his

cell -- get him to spill the

location.

ARCHER

Pollux is way too paranoid.  The

only person he'd talk to about

that bomb is Castor himself.  And

dead men can't talk.

BRODIE

There might be a way around

that...

ARCHER

Why are you keeping him alive?

(gets no answer)

As long as he's breathing, he's

dangerous.

MILLER

Relax, he's a turnip.

BRODIE

We can arrange for you to enter

Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy.

ARCHER

What are you talking about?

HOAG

I think I'd better answer that

question.

(offers hand)

Malcolm Hoag.  I run the

Physiological Camouflage Unit for

Special Ops.

ARCHER

I know who you are.

MILLER

But you don't know what he can do.

Physical augmentation; enhancement

surgery...

BRODIE

... He can disguise a compromised

agent or alter the likeness --

even the voice -- of a government

witness.

HOAG

Let me show you how it's done.

(leading him out)

I think you'll recognize our

patient...

HOAG

With our new generation of anti-

inflammatories, healing is

accelerated from weeks to days.

By his next paycheck, he won't

even remember which ear he lost.

(a beat)

Your situation, however, would be

a little less permanent...

BRODIE

-- and a lot more classified.

ARCHER

This'll fool Pollux.

HOAG

That is a state-of-the-art morpho-

genetic template.  The inside can

be built to match the exact shape

of your skull; the outside --

exactly like Castor's.  Then we

fit his face right on top --

MILLER

-- and you become him.

ARCHER

You're talking about removing the

guy's face?

BRODIE

Borrowing, Jon.  The procedure's

completely reversible.

MILLER

One way or the other -- the

mission ends on the eighteenth.

BRODIE

You know Castor better than

anyone.  You've lived and breathed

him for years -- hell, you even

look a little like him.

ARCHER

Find yourself another lab-rat.

MILLER

If you don't do this -- Castor

will beat us again.  He'll beat

you again...

HOAG

I don't think that went very well.

BRODIE

Trust us, Doc...

MILLER

... he'll jerk around.  Then he'll

be back.

ARCHER

I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.  So

you've only got ten seconds to go

through your usual litany of lies,

empty threats, and moronic

denials.  Then I'm coming over

there --

DIETRICH

If you're in such a fucking hurry

-- why are you wasting your time

with me?  I'm just an art dealer.

ARCHER

You're a dealer, all right:

technical secrets, munitions...

explosives.

DIETRICH

You've never proven any of that.

And when my bitchy, never-been-

laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here,

she's going to...

ARCHER

Time's up.

LAZARRO

The only ticking bomb I see is

inside his head.  He's getting

worse, Tito.

TITO

Don't worry, sir.  It's all an

act...

DIETRICH

... Okay!  Castor called me but I

blew him off... I swear I never

saw him.  And I don't know

anything about any bomb!

ARCHER

Let him go, but I want him

watched... Who's next?

TITO

Just Dietrich's sister...

ARCHER

When was the last time you saw

Castor Troy?

SASHA

Who cares?  He's dead.

ARCHER

Answer the question.

SASHA

Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids

now --

ARCHER

Sasha -- you are a felon, on

probation for harboring Castor

Troy.  So it's in your best

interest to cooperate.

(as she's silent)

Would you like your son put in a

foster home?

SASHA

No, but I'm sure you'd love it --

you sick bastard.

ARCHER

(unmoved)

When was the last time you saw

Castor Troy?

SASHA

I haven't seen him for years.

ARCHER

What about Lazarro?

BRODIE

No way -- the red tape alone would

take a month.  This is a black-bag

operation -- completely off the

books.

MILLER

If you need him, Tito can help you

prepare.  But you know the drill:

You can't tell anyone -- not the

Director, not your wife... nobody.

ARCHER

I'm in.

EVE

I was dreaming...

ARCHER

Something good?

EVE

I'm not sure... you were flying

this weird old stunt plane...

doing flips... walking on the

wings... I was watching from the

ground -- when you fell.  You had

a parachute, but you wouldn't open

it.

ARCHER

Did you catch me?

EVE

No.

ARCHER

How come?

EVE

I don't know...

(nuzzles him)

Maybe because you've never needed

my help.

ARCHER

Come on, you made that up, didn't

you?

EVE

... Maybe I did...

(teasing)

... maybe I didn't...

EVE

It's all right, Jon.

ARCHER

After all these years, I still

can't get it out of my head -- an

inch to the left, Matty would

still be alive.

EVE

And you wouldn't be.

EVE

Things will get better now that

you're home.  Everything will be

better -- now that... that man is

finally out of our lives.

ARCHER

Eve...

ARCHER

... If I had to do something to

find some closure... I should do

it, shouldn't I?... No matter how

crazy?

EVE

Oh, God -- you're going on

assignment again...

ARCHER

One last time.  And while I'm

gone, I want you and Jamie to go

to your mother's.  It's

important...

EVE

You said you'd be here!  You

promised!  What could be more

important than that?

ARCHER

I can't tell you... except only I

can do it.

EVE

You want me to tell you it's okay

to leave?  Okay, go on!  Go!

DISSOLVE TO:

TITO

Jon, this is goddam insane.  You

can't do it.

TITO

You haven't got a chance in hell

of fooling Pollux.  Castor drinks,

smokes and walks around with a 24-

hour hard-on.  He's nothing like

you --

ARCHER

Don't worry... If Hoag can do half

what he claims, I'll get Pollux to

talk.

TITO

It's not that simple, Jon...

Becoming another person --

especially him -- nobody can come

all the way back from that... not

even you.

ARCHER

Keep this for me.

HOAG

Let's walk through it, Jon.  Your

blood types are different, but we

can't do anything about that.

Otherwise, nature is cooperating

nicely.  The height difference is

negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.

Eye color -- almost a perfect

match.  Penis size, flaccid,

essentially the same --

Substantial.

HOAG

Hairline will be adjusted with

laser-shears... micro-plugs for

the body hair... the teeth will be

bonded to match Castor's...

HOAG

How about an abdominoplasty?

ARCHER

Abdomino -- what?

HOAG

A tummy tuck.  On the house.

ARCHER

Do it.

TITO

Nice catch.  But you used the

wrong hand.

TITO

Shoot me.

(as Archer

doesn't move)

Shoot me!

TITO

You want to be Castor Troy?  If

you hesitate for a breath, you're

finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill

me!

TITO

You can't do it... because Castor

is tougher than you...

HOAG

Let's see if I missed anything

before I get my hands really dirty.

HOAG

You realize this has to be

removed.

(as Archer

slowly nods)

Then here we go, Commander.

Through the Looking Glass...

HOAG

Make sure you get everything --

I'll need to study the tape before

the reverse surgery.

HOAG

Vault it.

DISSOLVE TO:

TITO

Jon -- are you all right?

ARCHER

Okay... I'm okay.

(realizes)

But my voice... I still sound like

me.

HOAG

I implanted a micro-chip onto your

larynx.

CASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER

Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a

confession to make, but        confession to make, but

you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like

it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.)

ARCHER

Now what?

TITO

We're down to 72 hours.  Let's

call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just

came out of his coma.

TITO

Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite

your nuts off if he gets the

chance!

LOOMIS

What a week for Archer to go on a

training op.  Maybe we should try

to contact him.

WANDA

Forget it.  He's knee-deep in

Georgia swamp by now.

ARCHER

Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher

meal...

WALTON

You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a

citizen of nowhere.  Human rights

zealots, the Geneva convention and

the P.C. police have no authority

here.  You have no right...

(slaps on latex gloves)

When I say your ass belongs to me

-- I mean it.  Bend over.

WALTON

Step into them.

WALTON

Don't sniff 'em, you perv.  Just

step into them.

ARCHER

They're too tight.

WALTON

So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth

shut.

WALTON

The prison's one big magnetic

field.  The boots'll tell us where

you are -- every second of the

day.

(into comm-link)

201 to Population.

WALTON

I've got fifty bucks says you're

dead by dinner.  Don't disappoint

me.

LITTLE MAN

Hey, Castor -- remember me?

ARCHER

Fabrice Voisine... sure, I --

(catches himself)

-- I believe Jon Archer busted you

for poisoning five members of the

the Canadian parliament?

VOISINE (LITTLE MAN)

Those scumbags should never have

voted against the Quebecois.

(a beat)

We heard you got wasted.

ARCHER

Do I look wasted -- asshole?

GUARD

(into comm-unit)

Central.  I have a disturbance in

population.  Go to lock down --

WALTON

(into comm-unit)

Hold that lock down.

ARCHER

Never -- in -- the -- face.

WALTON

Lock 'em down.

ARCHER

What?  He started it!

ARCHER

When I get out of here --

WALTON

You'll what?

ARCHER

I'm going to have you fired.

WALTON

(to Dubov)

That's two strikes, Dubov.  One

more and you know where you're

going.

(to the others)

Back to your 'suites' -- or no

dinner.

POLLUX

Hey, bro...

ARCHER

-- Pollux?

POLLUX

Of course it's Pollux, what the

fuck's wrong with you?

CASTOR

Lars... okay, Lunt, then.

(rifling desk

documents)

Something really fucked-up

happened... I'm in trouble... so

listen very carefully...

HOAG

What's this about?  What do you

want?

CASTOR

What do you think I want?

POLLUX

You realize, of course, that

magnetic humming is designed to

drive us insane.  If we all don't

get brain tumors first.

VOISINE

And that same cloying Bambi tape

-- over and over...

POLLUX

It's like they're begging us to

riot.  Where the fuck are we,

anyway?

(the game ends)

Gotta go...

POLLUX

... I'm worried about you.

ARCHER

Why?

POLLUX

Your jumpshot has no arc.  You

used to swagger... now you swish.

You're gumming that butt like a

Catholic school girl.

(notices)

And why do you keep picking at

your finger?

ARCHER

I was in a coma...

ARCHER

My reflexes, my senses, my

memory... everything's jumbled.  I

can't even tell you why Dubov

jumped me yesterday.

POLLUX

You Pollinated his wife the day he

was arrested.  How could forget

that?

ARCHER

I've forgotten plenty.  Look

around -- we've screwed over half

the freaks in here.  What's gonna

happen to us if they think I've

lost it?

ARCHER

I need you to play big brother for

once -- till I can fill in a few

blanks.  Think you can handle

that?

ARCHER

I know I got this on my tenth

birthday.  I just can't remember

why.

POLLUX

Man -- that was the worst day of

our lives!

ARCHER

Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County

General.

POLLUX

Retching and convulsing while

those bastards didn't even try to

save her sorry ass.  You gave her

mouth to mouth -- man -- even then

you had some constitution.

(a beat)

Remember what you swore to me at

the funeral?

ARCHER

Uh -- to kill the doctors?

POLLUX

After that.  You promised you'd

always take care of me.

ARCHER

And I bet I kept that promise...

POLLUX

Only one you've never broken.

ARCHER

Screw the past.  We've got the

future to look forward to.

(a beat)

We still have tomorrow.

POLLUX

No shit... five million bucks...

now those Red Militia crackpots

get to keep it.

ARCHER

That's not the worst part.

POLLUX

What's worse than losing five

million bucks?

ARCHER

Being stuck in this rat-hole when

it blows.  What you built was a

work of art.  It belongs in the

Smithsonian.

POLLUX

Yeah -- well... the L.A.

Convention Center will have to

do...

ARCHER

Thanks, Pollux.

POLLUX

'Thanks'?  I guess they really did

fuck you up.

WALTON

You have a visitor.

IMPOSTOR

What's the matter?  Don't you like

the new me?

ARCHER

-- Castor...?

CASTOR

Not anymore.

ARCHER

It can't be.  It's impossible.

CASTOR

I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used

was 'titanically remote'.  Who

knows?  Maybe the trauma of having

my face cut off pulled me out.  Or

maybe God really is on my side

after all.

(starts pacing)

By the way, I know you don't get

the papers in here.

"INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead"

CASTOR

Terrible tragedy.

Hoag was such a genius -- but

selfish with his artistry.  I

actually had to torture his

assistants to convince him to

perform the same surgery on me.

ARCHER

You killed them?

CASTOR

Of course I killed them, you dumb

fuck.  Hoag, his staff...

CASTOR

Miller and Brodie --

CASTOR

I even paid a visit to your buddy

Tito.

ARCHER

He doesn't know anything about

this!

CASTOR

Come on, Jon.  I think I know you

better than that.  I only wish you

could have been there to see the

look on his face --

CASTOR

-- then again, I guess you were

there.

(a beat)

I torched every shred of evidence

that proves who you are.  So

swallow this -- you are going to

be in here for the rest of your

life.

ARCHER

Castor, don't do this --

CASTOR

No discussion, Jon -- no deals.

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got

an important government job to

abuse, and a beautiful wife to

fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make

love to.'

WALTON

Sorry, sir.

CASTOR

It's quite all right.  You never

know what to expect from a

psychopathic criminal...

WALTON

Better be nice, Castor.  You could

get mighty lonely now that Pollux

is gone.

ARCHER

Pollux is -- what?

WALTON

Archer cut him a deal for turning

state's evidence.  He's been

released...

ARCHER

Walton, you have to listen to me

-- right now!

WALTON

Or what?  You'll have me fired?

(pushes a button)

You're confined until I say

otherwise...

CASTOR

(sickened)

Jesus, what a life.

EVE

I suppose it was only a matter of

time before you forgot where we

lived.

CASTOR

Sorry -- the job's been murder

lately.

EVE

So what happened to your

'important' assignment?

CASTOR

What do you know about it?

EVE

I know exactly what you always

tell me:  Absolutely nothing.

CASTOR

It didn't work out the way

everyone thought it would.  Where

are you off to?

EVE

I've got surgery.

CASTOR

Surgery -- are you okay?

EVE

Don't try to charm me -- I'm still

angry.  There're leftovers in the

fridge.

CASTOR

Have fun at work.

EVE

What is with you?

CASTOR

Don't I usually kiss my wife?

EVE

No.

CASTOR

What a dump.

CASTOR

'... "Date-night" has been a

typical failure... we haven't made

love in almost two months...'

What a loser ...

CASTOR

The plot thickens.

JAMIE

-- I got your E-mail, Karl.  That

poem was really sweet --

(spots Castor

at door)

Hang on a sec...

JAMIE

I'll call you back.

(to Castor)

You're not respecting my

boundaries.

CASTOR

I'm coming in, Janie.

JAMIE

'Janie'?

CASTOR

I don't think you heard me...

Jamie... You have something I

want ...

JAMIE

Clarissa left those here.

CASTOR

(shrugs and

lights up)

I won't tell mom if you don't.

JAMIE

When did you start smoking?

CASTOR

You'll be seeing a lot of changes

around here --

(blows a perfect

smoke ring)

Daddy's a new man.

BUZZ

Listen, sir... we just want you to

know...

WANDA

We're all really sorry about

Tito...

CASTOR

Yeah, well, shit happens.

CASTOR

How's our star witness?

BUZZ

He hasn't told us a damn thing

except what kind of mustard he

likes on his tongue sandwiches.

WANDA

If that bomb is out there -- we're

almost out of time.

LAZARRO (O.S.)

Archer!

LAZARRO

You made a deal with Pollux Troy?

He's 'a manipulative psychopath.'

Your own words, Jon!

CASTOR

Just let me do my job, Victor.

LAZARRO

The job I've been protecting for

the last eight years.  From now

on, you go strictly by the book.

Everything gets cleared by me.

Understand?

CASTOR

You're supposed to be snitching --

making me look good.

POLLUX

'Look good'?

(drops food in

disgust)

Seeing that face -- I want to

vomit.

CASTOR

I'm the one who has to look at

this butt-ugly mug every time I

pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes,

my chin, my perfect nose -- gone!

(considers his

reflection)

Archer took my life, so I'm taking

his.  Bro, I'm going straight.

POLLUX

Sounds like they took your brain,

too?

CASTOR

Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar

Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running

Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the

Mossad.  Think of the secrets we

could sell...

POLLUX

The drug agents we could expose.

The movie stars we could

blackmail!

CASTOR

That's just the bottom of the food

chain.  Pollux -- what would

happen if somebody planted a bomb

on Air Force One?

POLLUX

... that somebody would get rich.

And, I suppose, the nation would

be pretty pissed-off.

CASTOR

Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking

for someone to step in, take

charge, give them hope again.

What if that someone was an F.B.I.

hero?  A true Boy Scout and family

man -- with a spotless past.

Imagine where that guy could land

-- if the timing's right.

POLLUX

It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But

Jon Archer is hardly a household

name.

CASTOR

Not yet he isn't.  But after you

'confess' -- you'll be a free man.

And I'll be on my way...

BOMB LEADER

Jesus... Any suggestions?

TECHNICIAN

Yeah... run

BOMB LEADER

It's protected by a vibration

detector... One touch and...

CASTOR

Evacuate your team, Captain.

BOMB LEADER

Sir, you can't disarm it --

CASTOR

Just go!

WALTON

A special privilege today:  TV --

by order of Agent Jon Archer of

the F.B.I...

ANCHORMAN (V.O.)

That was the scene at the L.A.

Convention Center, where an F.B.I.

agent is being hailed as a hero.

Agent Jon Archer disarmed a

powerful bomb just seconds before

it was set to explode.  Let's get

the latest from Valerie Rice...

REPORTER RICE

The apparent target was a group of

Supreme Court justices -- due to

speak here today.

(thrusting microphone)

Mr. Archer, do you have any idea

who planted it?

CASTOR

That's classified.  But if he's

listening I have a message for

him:

(directly into

camera)

Nice try.  Now you know who's

really in charge.

CASTOR

Don't you guys watch TV?  Where's

the parade?

CASTOR

-- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda...

all of you, thanks from the bottom

of my heart.  Thanks for enduring

all those years I was an

insufferable boor.  From now on --

consider me reborn.

WANDA

Stop the presses -- Jon Archer

found a personality...

KIM

Sir... the White House is calling.

CASTOR

Jon, your career is finally taking

of.

(picks up phone)

Archer.  Sure I'll hold...

CASTOR

Mr. President, what an honor...

CASTOR

How about a game of horse?

JAMIE

Don't make me beat your butt

again, Dad.  It's harmful to my

developing psyche.

CASTOR

Afraid you'll lose?

CASTOR

'H.'

CASTOR

Try putting a higher arc on the

ball... and square your shoulders

to the basket.

JAMIE

Gotta go.  Karl's here.

CASTOR

Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve --

it's date night!

EVE

Why do I feel like I'm on a blind

date?

CASTOR

It's important to keep some

mystery... so things stay...

unpredictable.

EVE

'Unpredictable'?  You're about as

unpredictable as the tide.

(detached)

How long are you going to be gone

this time?

CASTOR

Gone?

EVE

Isn't that what all this is about?

The wine, cooking me dinner --

your next assignment?

CASTOR

I'm not going anywhere.

EVE

You always say that -- then you

leave.

CASTOR

I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon

Archer is the most inattentive,

sexless spouse on Earth.

EVE

Jon, that's not true --

CASTOR

Of course it's true, but I'm

trying to change?  I'm here

because I want to be alone with

you.  I want to see the candle-

light dance in your beautiful --

CASTOR

-- brown eyes.

CASTOR

I wanted it all to be just

right... when I told you about my

promotion.

EVE

Your what?

CASTOR

Well, I don't have it yet.  But

Lazarro's getting old -- he won't

be around forever.  And I'm

getting the itch to move up.

EVE

Jon... that's wonderful.

CASTOR

So you see, I'm not going

anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs

with you...

CASTOR

baby, it's like I'm having you for

the first time.

ARCHER

Don't they ever let us take off

these boots?

VOISINE

Not unless you're sent to the

'Clinic.'

ARCHER

You mean if I get sick?

VOISINE

They don't give two fucks about

your health.  The Clinic's where

they send the real hard-cases for

attitude adjustment.  Dubov just

got sent down -- and look at

Wainwright --

VOISINE

Toughest bastard I ever saw --

after you, of course.  Now he's a

fucking drool case.

ARCHER

What did he do?

VOISINE

He hit a guard.

WALTON

Looking for trouble, Castor?

ARCHER

As a matter of fact -- yes.

MED-TECH

Where's the mop, he puked all over

the place.

MED-TECH

(mopping up)

-- next time, bring them in before

dinner...

MED-TECH

Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.

WALTON

Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll

be gumming baby food from here on

out.

MED-TECH

Get his boots, Sergeant.

ARCHER

Dubov -- come on!

SMASH CUT:

WALTON

There!

ARCHER

Let's go!

EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY

SAFETY LINES REQUIRED

SMASH CUT:

ARCHER

Come on... come on...

EVE

Last night, I thought -- this

isn't my husband.

EVE

Then I woke up in the middle of

the night -- and found you passed

out in the study.

CASTOR

I couldn't sleep -- you roll

around a lot.

(jingles car keys)

Anyway, I'm late.

EVE

Jon, you know what day it is.  I

know it's difficult for you, but

we still have to go.

CASTOR

Can't we skip it just this once?

I gotta 'protect and serve', you

know.

EVE

'Protect and serve' later.  You're

going.

CASTOR

Okay, if you insist.  But -- you

drive.

CASTOR

So who's this Karl creep Jamie's

been seeing?  He's a little old

for her, isn't he?

EVE

I don't know... they're about the

same ages we were when we met.

(smiles)

Remember the all-night dentist?

CASTOR

Sure, how could I forget.

(changes subject)

By the way, you never said

anything about last night...

EVE

Aren't you going to get that?

EVE

Jon -- this is hardly the time or

place.

Matthew Archer, Age 5

Beloved Son & Brother

We Cherish You Always

EVE

Happy birthday, Matty.

EVE

He took our baby, Jon.  He took

our little boy.

CASTOR

Stop crying... stop crying...

stop ...

WANDA

You picked a helluva day to leave

your beeper off!

CASTOR

What happened?

WANDA

Castor's dead!

CASTOR

He's -- what?

BUZZ

Somehow he escaped from Erewhon.

But a prison chopper mowed him

down just off Long Beach Harbor...

CASTOR

Where's the body?

WANDA

It hasn't been recovered yet.

CASTOR

'It hasn't been recovered yet!'

You people have no idea who you're

dealing with!

(beat)

I want everyone on this, reports

on the half hour, and all leads

get routed through my office.

Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D.

BUZZ

L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive,

Castor isn't stupid enough to come

back to the city.

CASTOR

He's alive -- and he's already

here.  Move!

ARCHER

Dr. Archer please.   It's an

emergency.

(listens)

-- Her husband.

ARCHER

Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds

crazy, but --

(reverting back)

Dammit.

EVE

How did this happen, sweetie?

IRIS'S DAD

She fell off her Big-Wheel.

NURSE

Dr. Archer -- your husband's on

three.

EVE

Get Child Services down here --

and don't let her father leave.

(goes to wall-phone)

Jon?  Hello?

ARCHER

Eve, listen carefully.  The man

you think is your husband --

isn't.

EVE

Who is this?

ARCHER

Please, just listen!  Take Jamie

and go to your mother's in Santa

Fe.  Don't tell him where you're

going -- just go.

EVE

Whoever you are -- don't call

again...

ARCHER

I need to speak to Director

Lazarro immediately... I have

information about Castor Troy.

CASTOR

This is Jon Archer.  Who's

calling?

ARCHER

Well, if you're Jon Archer... I

guess this must be Castor Troy...

CASTOR

I've gotta hand it to you, Jon.

You're doing a damn respectable

job of being me.  But let's face

it, we both liked it better the

way it was.  So before the cops

blow your brains out -- why not

tell me where you are...

ARCHER

If you were really me, you'd

know -- no discussion, no deals.

CHOLO # 1

Where are you going?

CHOLO #2

Ten bucks he's the guy who popped

Tito!

CHOLO #1

9-1-1?  I want to report a stolen

car and don't put me on hold!

RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)

... the escapee is considered

extremely dangerous.  If you have

any information concerning the

whereabouts of Castor Troy...

ARCHER

No, Jon... you have to think like

Castor.  Where would he go...?

DIETRICH

Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's

in big trouble.

ARCHER

Yeah -- me.

DIETRICH

Jesus Christ, Castor.

ARCHER

Drive.  And punch up your

cellular -- I need you to make

some calls.

DIETRICH

You're gonna get me busted!

ARCHER

You're already busted, Dietrich.

It's just a matter of time before

they pick you up.

DIETRICH

Man, when you came to me about

that bomb -- I knew I should have

blown you off... but that's my

fucking curse -- I just can't say

no to a friend.

ARCHER

You can't say no to money.

DIETRICH

That's my other curse.

ARCHER

You're Castor Troy... This is your

old crew -- you don't take shit

and you don't take no for an

answer...

ALDO

Helluva place, Dietrich.  So

what's the big surprise?

FITCH

Are you crazy?  You're going to

bring the Feds down on all of us!

ARCHER

Archer doesn't want you, he wants

me!  But I'm going to get him

first -- with your help.

ALDO

Archer's a damn celebrity now --

he's untouchable -- and you're

radioactive.

ARCHER

You wanna face-off with Castor

Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on!

'Cause I've had a real bad day...

ARCHER

You're all forgetting who the real

enemy is.

(to Aldo)

Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled

you in for questioning.  He

rattled you so bad -- you shit

your Armani suit right there in

the interrogation room.

ARCHER

You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer

laughed at your last arraignment,

when you got down on your knees

and tried to blow your way to

freedom.

DIETRICH

We all have a reason to hate Jon

Archer.  We all want to see him

dead --

ARCHER

And nobody's untouchable if we say

he's not.

DIETRICH

It's all worked out.  Caz has

Archer's routine down cold.

ARCHER

We start with your basic

kidnapping.  Then -- a little

surgery.

FITCH

Surgery?

ARCHER

I'm going to rearrange his face in

a way you won't believe.

ALDO

You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But

you've got balls of titanium.

Count us in.

DIETRICH

Come on -- let's drink to it!

DIETRICH

How about one of your famous

toasts, Caz?

ARCHER

To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --

blow jobs?

LIVIA

Enough business, Caz.  Let's

dance.

ARCHER

Sorry... I don't...

LIVIA

Remember the Charger's game, Caz?

The owners box?  We did it four

times.

ARCHER

Sure I remember... Once a quarter,

right?

LIVIA

Caz?  Are you okay?

DIETRICH

When even Castor Troy can't handle

a tab of Quantrex...

(raises his glass)

That, dear friends, is the first

sorry whiff of old age.

ARCHER

-- Sasha Hassler.  Age 35.  Met

Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at

Pearl Jam reunion...

(catches himself)

Uh, how you doing, baby?

SASHA

What the hell are you doing here?

You're supposed to be dead...

JAMIE

No... Karl, please.

JAMIE

My father -- he's got a gun --

he'll -- he'll --

KARL

(pulls open belt)

That wimp won't do shit.

CASTOR

Who are you to call Jon Archer a

wimp?

CASTOR

What are you -- stupid?

JAMIE

That's just like you.  Some guy

tries to rape me -- and you side

with him.

CASTOR

Did it look like I was siding with

him?  Did it?

(she falls silent)

You want to play with scummy organ

grinders, you better be prepared.

Do you have protection?

JAMIE

You mean like... condoms?

CASTOR

I mean like... protection.

JAMIE

For me?

CASTOR

Next time -- slip it in low, then

twist it -- so the wound doesn't

close.

CASTOR

Go on, get out of here.

CASTOR

No wonder he spent all his time

chasing me.  Who can deal with

this family shit?

CASTOR

Jon Archer.

(immediately alert)

Where is he?

POLLUX

(into cell phone)

-- I thought he might visit some

old friends of yours.  And bro, if

I didn't know better -- I'd swear

this guy likes being you...

ARCHER

Uh -- can't we just talk?

SASHA

Talk?  The only talk I ever heard

from you was 'take it off,' 'sit

on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

SASHA

Take off the rest of those rags

and get dressed.  Then get out.

ARCHER

Not until I finish my business

with your brother.

SASHA

I told him to keep those creeps

away -- but you're just too big an

attraction.

(calming herself)

Look, if the F.B.I. finds out

you've been here -- I'll lose my

son.  So please, just go.

ARCHER

I know I've done some things that

made your life harder...

SASHA

How would you?  You walked out and

never looked back.

ARCHER

I'm not the same person you

remember.  And for what it's

worth, I'm sorry...

ARCHER

Not a bad fit.

SASHA

They should.  They're yours.

ARCHER

Nice-looking kid, too

SASHA

Of course he is...

SASHA

Adam, come here... I want you to

meet your father.

CASTOR

(into cellular)

We've got him sighted.  Okay,

Pollux, pull out.

BUZZ

What makes you so sure this guy's

gonna set up his own brother?

CASTOR

I've never been more certain of

anything.  Get everyone in

position.  Remember -- shoot to

kill.

BUZZ

You heard the man -- let's saddle

up!

ARCHER

How old is he?

SASHA

Five.  No one knows you're his

father.  I thought someone might

want to hurt him -- just to hurt

you...

ADAM

Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

SASHA

You know Mommy doesn't like you

playing with these things...

SASHA

You're not holding him right...

Caz...

ARCHER

He's not my son.

SASHA

Yes, he is -- !

ARCHER

Get down!

SASHA

Adam!

ARCHER

Buzz...

ARCHER

Dietrich!  The painting!

DIETRICH

Let's go!

SASHA

Adam!

DIETRICH

They're like cockroaches!

DIETRICH

If we make it, we'll meet up at my

Malibu place.  You remember it,

Caz?

ARCHER

Off Kanan Road -- I know it.

SASHA

Thank you, Caz... thank you...

ARCHER

Get the boy out of here...

ARCHER (O.S.)

That's about a thousand years bad

luck...

CASTOR

It's too late, Jon.  Your kid

loves me.  And your wife's an

animal.  Even I can't keep up with

her.

CASTOR

Tonight I'm going to make her come

like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate

your death.

POLLUX

Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'?

POLLUX

You tricked me into telling you

things I never told anyone...

POLLUX

Now take it to your grave.

CASTOR

Pollux...

CASTOR

Get a medic -- now!

LOOMIS

Forget him, sir.  It's only Pollux

Troy...

WANDA

What happened?

CASTOR

What the fuck do you think

happened?  Castor Troy just

shot him!

(beat)

What are you waiting for?  Go!

KIM

Sir -- you're on the cover of

Time.  They're calling you 'An

Authentic American Hero.'

CASTOR

What is it?

LAZARRO

We were friends once, Jon, so I

feel I owe it to you -- to tell

you face-to-face...

(a beat)

I don't care how much hype you're

getting -- you're through.  After

that massacre last night, I'm

ordering a full inquiry into your

recent erratic -- and deeply

suspect -- behavior.

CASTOR

Me -- 'erratic'?  Victor, what are

you talking about?

LAZARRO

You start meeting with Brodie and

Miller.  Then they die

mysteriously.  Your best friend is

murdered -- and you don't seem to

give a shit.

Suddenly you're smoking, drinking,

acting like a man with something

to hide...

(beat)

Maybe you've been bought -- maybe

you've lost your mind.  But I

promise... I'm going to find out.

CASTOR

Okay, Vic, I have a confession to

make.  But you aren't gonna like

it...

(wraps arm

around neck)

I'm Castor Troy.

LAZARRO

-- I don't understand...

CASTOR

Now you understand.

CASTOR

Cancel my four o'clock.

(beat)

And send for the paramedics.

Victor Lazarro's having a heart

attack.

MATCH CUT TO:

DISPATCHER

All units.  I have a confirmed

code zero-zero priority alert.

Proceed at once to Parthenia

Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia

at Nordhoff.

Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.

Choppers lift off and veer east.

The surveillance CARS ROAR away.

WANDA

Commander, what are you doing

here?

CASTOR

Where should I be?

(looks around)

Where's everyone else?

WANDA

Backing you up!  Didn't you track

Castor to the Parthenia Street

Terminal?

CASTOR

What?

WANDA

You radioed in your personal

security code.  Nobody knows that

code but you.

CASTOR

Obviously someone else knows it!

Get everybody back to their

posts -- now!

ARCHER

Eve...

ARCHER

I'm not going to hurt you.  Just

don't scream, okay?

(no response)

Okay?

EVE

I know you -- you're the one who

called.  You're Castor Troy.  You

killed my son --

ARCHER

-- I called, but I'm not Castor.

I'm your husband.

ARCHER

Now, you're going to listen.  The

last time we saw each other -- was

in this room.  We had a fight

after I told you I had to go away.

(a beat)

My assignment -- Jon Archer's

assignment -- was to enter a

federal prison as Castor Troy.

EVE

How did he expect to do that?

ARCHER

An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's

face.  He handled the transplant,

the vocal implant, everything.

But somehow Castor came out of his

coma -- and killed everyone who

knew about the mission.  But not

before he was transformed into me.

COP (O.S.)

Dr. Archer, are you okay?

ARCHER

If you need hard evidence, get it.

Your husband's blood type is O

negative.  Castor's is A.B.

ARCHER

Remember the parachute dream?  I'm

falling, Eve... I'm falling...

CASTOR (O.S.)

I want you guys here around-the-

clock.  And stay off the lawn.

CASTOR

You're all in knots.  Maybe

another date night will help you

relax...

EVE

Not tonight... I'm way behind in

my Continuing Ed.

CASTOR

You think I've been acting

strange.  Like a completely

different person.

EVE

-- Yes.

CASTOR

Okay, I have a confession to make.

But you aren't going to like it...

CASTOR (cont'd)

... I read your diary.  I've been

trying to change -- trying to be

more like the man you want me to

be.

CASTOR

And to prove it, I'm taking you

and Jamie away on a trip -- right

after the memorial service.

EVE

What memorial service?

CASTOR

Victor Lazarro had a heart

seizure... right in my office.  It

was horrible...

EVE

Oh, my God...

CASTOR

First Tito... now Victor...

(holds her tight)

... please don't tell me I'm going

to lose you, too...

EVE

(returns the embrace)

Of course not.

CASTOR

What was that?

EVE

What was what?

CASTOR

Something bit me.

EVE

Probably a mosquito -- I'll close

the window.

COP

Sorry, Dr. Archer.  Where are you

going at this hour?

EVE

There's been an emergency at the

hospital.

COP

One of us will have to escort you.

EVE

Fine...

(a beat)

But please don't wake my

husband... he's exhausted.

EVE

Please be O-neg.  Please...

ARCHER (O.S.)

Thanks for believing me.

ARCHER

What are you doing?  Where did you

get that gun?

EVE

I took it from my fake husband.

ARCHER

Why point it at me?  I'm the real

thing.

EVE

I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's

already dead.

ARCHER

What more proof do you need?

EVE

Tell me... tell me about the all-

night dentist.

ARCHER

... I took a date out for chicken

and ribs -- not knowing she was a

vegetarian.  When the night

couldn't get worse, she broke

her tooth on a pebble that got

into her three-bean salad

Somehow she and I had fun driving

around looking for an all-night

dentist...

(a beat)

And even though it must have hurt

-- you still kissed me.

EVE

Christ, Jon!  How could you put us

in this position?  Do you know --

do you know what he did to me...?

ARCHER

Whatever happened, whatever he did

-- I know it's my fault and I know

I can never make it up to you --

EVE

But you're damn well going to try.

(a beat)

First -- how are we going to get

you out of this?

EVE

This will knock him out for hours.

ARCHER

Good.  What's his schedule

tomorrow?

EVE

He doesn't tell me anymore than

you ever did... All I know is --

tomorrow we're going to Victor's

memorial service.

ARCHER

Victor... Tito... they both died

thinking I killed them... And in a

way... I did.

EVE

Jon -- you can't think about that

now.

ARCHER

-- What happens after the memorial?

EVE

He's taking Jamie and me away.

ARCHER

And neither of you will be coming

back.  Where's the service?

EVE

Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea.

EVE

What are you going to do?

ARCHER

Hit him with a trank dart.  Once

he's unconscious -- I'll try to

get to Buzz and Wanda before the

security team gets to me.

EVE

What else can I do?

ARCHER

Think up a good excuse.  I don't

want you or Jamie anywhere near

that service.

EVE

I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm

not there, he'll suspect

something...

(as Archer

considers)

The second you make your move, all

hell's going to break loose.  If

I'm there beside him -- I can take

charge.  I'm his wife, remember?

(a beat)

There's no way around it -- for

once, you need me.

ARCHER

I've always needed you...

EVE

Jon -- what are the odds?

ARCHER

Terrible.  But it's the best we

can do with what we have.

(a beat)

If it doesn't happen, take Jamie

and don't look back...

EVE

It'll happen.

ARCHER

Do doctors travel in packs?

EVE

Only when we're golfing.

EVE

Jon!  What are you doing here?

CASTOR

That's what you're going to

explain to me.

EVE

Didn't the police tell you?  There

was an emergency.

EVE

Jon -- stop it!  Mr. Alandro is

very ill!

CASTOR

Not as ill as he's going to be...

CASTOR

Sorry.  But what's a guy to think

when his wife runs off in the

middle of the night?

EVE

It's my fault.  I should've woken

you up before I left.

(kisses him)

Now please let me get back to

work.

CASTOR

Stay here.  Watch her like a hawk.

LARS

Think she knows?

CASTOR

Who cares?  She's going to be dead

by tonight anyway.  They're all

going to be dead.  The wife, the

kid... and the father.

ARCHER

How's the boy?

SASHA

His ears are still ringing -- but

he'll be okay.

SASHA

The truck's all gassed up.

Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.

agents all over that place.  Maybe

I can talk my brother into helping

us.

ARCHER

'Us'?  No, Sasha -- believe me,

this isn't your fight.

ARCHER

Thanks...

CASTOR

Where's Jamie?

EVE

That's what I'd like to know.  She

stole fifty dollars from my purse

and took off.

EVE

Don't act so stunned, Jon.  You

know how hard it is to get that

girl into a dress.

CASTOR

I'll deal with her later.

EVE

Good.  Because I am fed up.

PRIEST

We are here to celebrate the life

of Victor Lazarro.  We all know

him as a man who dedicated himself

to defending this great nation --

first, as a highly decorated

admiral -- then, as west coast

director of the F.B.I.  But not

all of you know what a deeply

spiritual man he was.  It was his

wish that his Requiem Mass be

performed in Latin.

(a beat)

In Nomine Patris, et Filii et

Spiritus Sancti.  Amen...

PRIEST

Domine, de morte aeterna, in

die illa tremenda quando caeli

movendi sunt et terra...

PRIEST

Requiem aeternam dona eis,

Domine... Amen.

JAMIE

Thanks anyway, Mom --

(slides her $50)

But I wanted to be here for you...

and Dad.

PRIEST

The admiral's family will now take

his ashes to the sea...

CASTOR

(into headset)

Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car

around, then meet us at that

boathouse...

EVE

Wanda -- I need to talk to you.

WANDA

(reads her face)

Sure... what's wrong?

EVE

Never mind --

CASTOR

Come on, baby.  I've got a

surprise for you.

CASTOR

Look who we caught creeping around

-- Castor Troy.

EVE

Why is he here?

CASTOR

Before I turn him in, I thought

we'd pay him back for everything

he's put us through...

CASTOR

Come on, baby.  Join the fun --

CASTOR

Too bad.  Part of me was hoping

you didn't know.

CASTOR

Did you really think it would be

that easy, you dumb fucks?

(to Eve)

Sorry, baby.  Castor Troy is about

to murder you and our daughter...

but I promise you won't die

unavenged.

ARCHER

This is between you and me.  Leave

them out of this.

CASTOR

It was between you and me.  Even

your little boy -- that wasn't

supposed to happen.  But you

couldn't let it go.

ARCHER

No father could.

CASTOR

Appealing to my sense of 'family'

won't work, Jon.  I thought you

knew me better than that

ARCHER

I know some things that even you

don't know, Caz.  You have a son.

I've met him.  His name is Adam...

CASTOR

I imagine I've got a dozen kids --

so what?

(cocks pistol)

No more head games... First your

wife dies.  Then your daughter.

Then you.

CASTOR

Just one big happy family...

CASTOR

Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?

DIETRICH

That's right, Archer.  Now drop

'em.

LARS

Don't fucking move...

SASHA

Caz -- are you okay?

CASTOR

You're making a mistake.  I'm

Castor -- he's Archer.  Sasha,

baby -- just give me a minute to

explain!

SASHA

That's pathetic, Archer.  But

then, your terrible sense of humor

is legendary.

ALDO

(cocks GUN)

It's pay-back time.

ARCHER

Find Jamie!

EVE

Jamie?  Jamie!

SASHA

... Help Adam... don't let him end

up like us...

DIETRICH

Sasha -- !

WANDA

We heard gunshots --

EVE

Wanda, I've got to tell you

something.  Something crazy...

ARCHER

Give up, Castor.  People are going

to find out.

CASTOR

Not if I kill you first.

CASTOR

Give it here, Jamie.

ARCHER

No, Jamie.  Don't do it!

ARCHER

Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm

your father.

CASTOR

It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your

father.

CASTOR

Shoot him, Jamie.

ARCHER

Jamie...

CASTOR

Shoot him!

CASTOR

You dunce.  No kid of mine would

miss so badly.

WANDA (O.S.)

Hold it.

CASTOR

Just saving the taxpayers the cost

of a trial.  So take a hike.

WANDA

You're both under arrest until a

D.N.A. test proves who's who.

CASTOR

I'm ordering you to back off!

WANDA

Put the gun down --

BUZZ

-- Now!

CASTOR

(beat)

Can't blame me for trying.

CASTOR

Say goodbye to Daddy --

CASTOR (O.S.)

You ungrateful delinquent!

CASTOR

Give me your weapon -- now!

JAMIE

(to Archer)

Who are you?  Will someone please

tell me what's going on?

BOAT CAPTAIN

Hey -- !

CASTOR

You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm

unarmed...

ARCHER

Okay, I have a confession to

make... but you aren't gonna like

it... You're right, I won't shoot

you.  Not in the face anyway.

CASTOR

It'll never be over, Jon... every

time you look in the mirror...

you'll see my face...

BUZZ

You okay, Archer?

ARCHER

What did you call me?

WANDA

He called you 'Archer' -- sir.

EVE

Hang on, Jon... they're bringing

in their top surgical team from

D.C...

ARCHER

(re:  Castor)

How is he?

EVE

No life signs at all.  He's a

turnip.

ARCHER

That's what they always say...

WANDA

I'm sorry, Eve.  You can't come.

(to Buzz)

Take her home.

EVE

But he's my husband!

WANDA

But he works for us.

JAMIE

Will Dad be Dad again?

EVE

I hope so, honey.

JAMIE

And you guys say my life is

screwed up...

ARCHER (O.S.)

Hello, Eve.

JAMIE (O.S.)

Dad?

JAMIE

I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.  Am I

grounded?

ARCHER

I have something to ask you -- to

ask both of you...

ARCHER

This is Adam.  He needs a place to

live... just for a little while.

DISSOLVE TO:

EVE

How was your first day back?

EVE

Jon?

FADE OUT.

THE END
