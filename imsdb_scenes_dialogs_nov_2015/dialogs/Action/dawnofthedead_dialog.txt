WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!

5	The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others

6	Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE

STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.

SO GET ME A NEW LIST.

SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.

8	We begin to listen over the din of the news room.

BELIEVE...

LIFE?

LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?

9	Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it

ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.

AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...

COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO

I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.

CLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.

14	 Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops

SHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.

15	 The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small

THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN

CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT

RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF

INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES

LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING

DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT

LARGE!

18	 Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.

FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?

19	 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters

20	 TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)

THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE

MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.

IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...

WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-

ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN

OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE

BODY.

TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...

21	 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and

YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK

WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.

WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.

22	 The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!

THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!

23	 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter

24	 Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even

OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?

MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

WE'RE ON THE AIR.

GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!

25	 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up

MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...

WE'RE LOSING PICTURE...

FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE

30	 TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.

THEY KILL FOR FOOD.

THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,

MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

64	 Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65	 Trooper:	YOU NEED MORE MEN?
