ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

... The War Office today approved military

expenditure for the nation's new defense alert

still necessary in the uncertain climate.

Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

BRENDA

See how you're getting on ...

STEED

Something in the wind?

MOTHER

Weather's turning nasty.

STEED

You didn't come to talk about the

weather, surely.

MOTHER

Oh yes I did. I want you to meet

somebody.

(off Steed's look)

I expect you'll like her.

STEED

PORTER

May I help you, madam ...

EMMA

Mr. John Steed, please.

PORTER

I'm afraid that's impossible.

EMMA

Impossible?

PORTER

You are female?

EMMA

As you see.

PORTER

Then you can't come in.

EMMA

I have an appointment.

PORTER

No women. Not in Boodles. Not

since 1922.

EMMA

Really -- what happened in 1922?

EMMA

Thank you so much. I can find Mr.

Steed myself ...

50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

STEED

Doctor Peel, I presume?

EMMA

And you must be Steed. Please

don't get up.

STEED

I was about to throw in the towel.

EMMA

I had a spot of bother at the door.

STEED

I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman

inside Boodles since --

EMMA

1922. Why the kippers?

STEED

Red herring would have been too

obvious, don't you think?

EMMA

(looks around)

So what was all this -- some sort

of test?

STEED

Congratulations, you've penetrated a

bastion of male privilege. I guessed

you weren't a stickler for Tradition,

doctor.

EMMA

Whereas you are.

STEED

Dyed in the wool. But I can admire

someone who doesn't play by the

rules.

EMMA

Rules are made to be broken.

STEED

Not by me. Play by the rules,

Doctor, or the game is nothing.

EMMA

And just what is the game?

STEED

I say, this is all terribly formal.

Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

EMMA

(re:  the steamroom)

Under the circumstances, you may

call me Mrs. Peel.

STEED

Much better.

EMMA

And now that we've settled the matter

of honorifics, will you kindly explain

why you wished me to meet you?

STEED

I didn't. Mother did.

EMMA

Mother?

STEED

I expect you'll like him.

51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

STEED

Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't

A word of warning. Don't take the

macaroon. Mother's favorite.

53      INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

MOTHER

That's better. I much prefer a

womb with view, don't you, Mrs.

Peel?

MOTHER

Shall I be mother?

MOTHER

I expect you're wondering where

you are.

EMMA

Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret

service. You're so hushhush, even the

legit secret service knows nothing about

it. Am I right?

MOTHER

Close. We're so hush-hush, even

we know nothing about it.

(before Emma can

make sense of this)

Now let's see, there's coconut cake,

date and walnut; I recommend the

rum baba ...

EMMA

Hmmm ...

MOTHER

Looks like rain, Steed...

STEED

... Showers followed by sunny periods.

EMMA

(looks up from

trolley)

We're not here to talk about the

weather, surely.

MOTHER

Oh, yes we are.

BRENDA

(to Emma, cunning)

Macaroon?

54      IN DARKNESS

MOTHER

We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.

We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into

the field for data. Case number one:

April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins

investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.

A field outside the village of Little Snoring,

one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped

by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death

in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in

perma-frost.

(the picture changes)

Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M.

Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges,

investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak

rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a

flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five

inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size

of a cricket pitch ...

(the picture changes)

... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief

Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip

field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins

recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth,

temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous

combustion. Not much of him left ...

MOTHER

My number two. Special assignments.

She's --

EMMA

Let me guess -- 'Father'?

FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)

All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

EMMA

You're --

FATHER

God, you're quick.

MOTHER

Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

STEED

Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My

shoemaker.

EMMA

(unimpressed)

A kipper. Or a red herring? What were

they investigating?

FATHER

A series of bizarre shifts in local weather

patterns ...

STEED

Global warming?

FATHER

Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush

English village transformed overnight

into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

EMMA

How curious ...

MOTHER

Something strange is happening. And

whoever knows about it doesn't want

us to find out.

FATHER

(to Steed)

Your mission is simple. Find out

how and why these agents died.

EMMA

I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

MOTHER

Your research into climate engineering was

state-of-the-art. Your experiments could

have revolutionized our knowledge of global

warming -- had they succeeded. We need

your expertise.

STEED

Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor

again, Mrs. Peel --

EMMA

I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.

I've been out of action for some time. I'll

consider your proposal.

FATHER

One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another

special reason we wanted you to join our

happy family; rather curious, actually ...

MOTHER

Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.

One description tallied in all three places.

Recognize her?

EMMA

Me, isn't it?

FATHER

Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.

With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

EMMA

You're saying I have no choice.

MOTHER

Father will be your controller. Steed here

will show you the ropes.

EMMA

(very arch)

Ropes?

55      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY

Emma, who works at reloading as

56      HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY

STEED

Think she really killed those agents?

MOTHER

She may not know. Theory goes she

may be very ill.

STEED

Amnesia?

MOTHER

Possibly. Split personality ...

STEED

Insane ... ?

MOTHER

Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right,

you should watch out.

STEED

Why?

MOTHER

She may try to kill you.

57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY

STEED

Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr.

Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

DR. DARLING

One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:

she's obsessively devoted to the memory

of her husband the scientist Peter Peel.

You may find her a little ... remote.

DR. DARLING

They were a team. Met at Cambridge.

Working on a top secret research mission

into weather conditions, code name The

Prospero Project, when Peel died.

MOTHER

Something went wrong. System malfunction.

Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.

Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File

still open.

STEED

How come you took so much interest

in her, Dr. Darling?

DR. DARLING

Her husband was one of ours.

STEED

(eyes Peel's photo,

then Mother)

Peel? Did she know?

MOTHER

Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She

was in a dangerous game, Steed. High

stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If

she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

STEED

Anyone particular in mind?

MOTHER

You.

59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

STEED

You're a lady of hidden talents,

Mrs. Peel ...

EMMA

I've no intention of hiding them ...

STEED

Scientist ...

(tic-tac)

... marksman ...

(tic-tac)

... swordsman ...

(tic-tac)

... To what do you attribute your

overachievements?

EMMA

My father always wanted a boy.

STEED

Really?  I fail to see the connection.

EMMA

I had a feeling you would. Touche!

STEED

I take your point.

EMMA

Do you?

STEED

Yes indeed. I need protection.

60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

EMMA

I thought we were on our way.

STEED

Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man

worth meeting. No point setting out

half shod.

EMMA

(dry)

Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

STEED

I couldn't agree more. Thank you,

Trubshaw.

TRUBSHAW

(significantly)

Very good, Mr. Steed.

62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

EMMA

(gags at the waistcoat)

Steed, we really must be --

STEED

(relishing his shoes)

Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a

hand-made shoe. As unique as a face

or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?

63      BEHIND DISPLAY

EMMA

You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

STEED

Thank you, Trubshaw ...

64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

EMMA (V.O.)

That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

STEED (V.O.)

Do you really think so?

65      SIGN

STEED (V.O.)

Press that button, would you?

Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

STEED

Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt

your flow of oratory ...

EMMA

You know what I mean. This car

-- and you. Nobody walks around

like that. Milk?

STEED

Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.

Peel. No thank you.

EMMA

But why? What's the point?

STEED

A Gentleman has to have a code.

This is part of mine. A uniform.

Think of it as my suit of shining

armor.

EMMA

And I suppose you're the knight.

STEED

The most unpredictable piece on

the board. And always ready to

protect his queen.

EMMA

That's predictable. When I find

a queen in need of protection

I'll let you know.

STEED

I'm hoping you will.

68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

69      INT.  JAG - DAY

EMMA

Sir August Merryweather ... why

are we seeing him first?

STEED

As per mother's instructions.

EMMA

Do we always follow Mother's

instructions?

STEED

For a man in my position --

EMMA

Just what is your position, if you don't

mind my asking.  How did a stuffed

shirt like you get into this line of work?

STEED

(smiles)

They call me in when they've reached a

dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

EMMA

I have no choice. Why should you

risk your life?

STEED

After our fencing match, I was rather

hoping you would do the risking.

More tea?

EMMA

No thanks.

STEED

I meant me.

70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

STEED (V.O.)

According to Mother, Sir August owns

half of the Highlands. A millionaire.

Former head of Special Projects at the

Ministry. Now ...

EMMA (V.O.)

An eccentric recluse?

71      INT.  JAG - DAY

STEED

Not so much eccentric. More barking

mad. He has a wife called June. And

a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

EMMA

June, July ... August?

STEED

The family does seem to be somewhat

meteorologically inclined.

EMMA

Any other vices?

STEED

All of a piece, really. A fanatical

weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.

(off her look)

British Royal Organisation For

Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British

weather has been tampered with

by ... aliens.

EMMA

So ... I distract him while you snoop

around? How?

STEED

Small talk.  Try the weather.

72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

EMMA

EMMA

Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

VOICE (O.S.)

Eh? In here!

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

EMMA

I've come to apply for membership

in Brolly --

SIR AUGUST

(shouts above the tempest)

You don't get rain like you used to in

England. A good shower that's the ticket.

Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells

the namby-pamby in a man.

EMMA

I so agree. How did you acquire a

taste for it?

SIR AUGUST

Out in India. So character-forming for the

British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The

rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen

inches overnight. A whole week of lovely

rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

SIR AUGUST

You

EMMA

Have we met?

SIR AUGUST

You mean you don't recall??

SIR AUGUST

Ah, Lady June ...

LADY JUNE

Dear August.  Loves his showers.

Like a baby.

(beat)

Scones, Mrs. Peel?

EMMA

Thank you, Lady -- June ...

SIR AUGUST

Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

EMMA

Promised? Who promised?

SIR AUGUST

There, look!

SIR AUGUST

Imagine being caught out in a blow

like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

STEED

I say, this is a bit much.

FADE TO BLACK.

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

STEED

Ah, Brenda ...

(as she leaves)

Mrs. Peel?

EMMA

You should be dead.  How do you

feel?

STEED

(eyes her)

Strange.

EMMA

You were very lucky.  Four shots to

the heart. I found you after I slipped

away from Sir August. Mother brought

you here. Not me you should thank.

STEED

I wasn't about to.

EMMA

I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your

bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought

you were just overdressed.

STEED

I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

EMMA

Mother and Dr. Darling have me

under observation. They think I

tried to kill you.

STEED

Why should they think that?

EMMA

You told them. You said I arrived

on a camel, shot you four times.

Left you for dead.

STEED

Frankly that's how I remember it.

EMMA

But that's absurd. I may not be

over-fond of you, Steed, but it's

not my style.

STEED

Perhaps your memory plays tricks,

Mrs. Peel.

EMMA

(conceding)

That's possible. Sir August was convinced

he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.

Another odd thing. When it rained, he said

it was just as someone had promised.

STEED

Did he say who?

EMMA

No. But he must know. Incidentally,

my double left you with this.

STEED

An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

EMMA

Did you say formal? I must dress.

85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

STEED

I must say, you look more your

old self --

EMMA

You mean my other self ...

STEED

Either way ... may I ask: why

you dress in that fashion?

EMMA

I should have thought that was

obvious ...

(off his smirk)

I'm in mourning.

STEED

I can't wait to see afternoon.

EMMA

Where's the picnic?

I welcome you to the first general meeting

VOICE (V.O.)

You have all given time, money and expertise

to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a

new phase of our operation. From today,

many of you will no longer be needed. I have

to warn you ...

VOICE (V.O.)

(filtered)

A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ...

A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is

no longer secret. Agents are investigating

us. Their names are John Steed and Emma

Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us

... perhaps more than one ...

VOICE (V.O.)

(filtered)

That remains to be seen. When we find

the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

TEDDY BEAR #l

These agents.  Where are they?

VOICE (V.O.)

(filtered)

Here. In this building. By our estimate, they

will enter this room in thirty-five point five

seconds precisely ...

VOICE (V.O.)

I am sorry the party is over.  But we

shall meet again.

To each of you a gift. A token of

my appreciation.

FATHER (V.O.)

A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.

Completely unpredicted ...

125     INSIDE CAR

EMMA

Where's Mother?

FATHER

Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't

take chances. I'm looking after

things while he's hiding out ...

FATHER

You're probably wondering how I

can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new

prototype from the boys in X division.

Micro-sensors in the system read

signals and road information. Converts

the info into miles per hour.

Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

STEED

We know one thing. That suspect

was not Mrs. Peel.

FATHER

So you say ...

EMMA

You don't believe him?

FATHER

It's Mother you have to convince.

He's very agitated.  Wait here.

EMMA

But

Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

MOTHER

Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's

turning quite nasty. Sir August was

blown to smithereens. Along with

half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's

worried.

EMMA

He tried to warn us ...

STEED

We had a lead to Wonderland

Weather but we got there too late.

Someone tipped them off ...

MOTHER

Too late anyway. Today's escapade

was only for starters. This is no

ordinary weather. It's manmade. A

kind of weather bomb.

STEED

Impossible.

EMMA

Not quite. This is my field.

STEED

Is there anything that isn't?

EMMA

(ignores)

The Prospero Project was started by

my husband. It was an early attempt

to solve the problems of global warming.

In theory, climate engineering is entirely

feasible. We thought of injecting a

chemical cocktail into the atmosphere

by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

STEED

Filling in mother nature's blind

spots ... ?

EMMA

Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts

to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.

Propane gas mostly. In small quantities

it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone

layer. But it proved impractical.

Too bulky ...

STEED

But if someone miniaturized the

process...

EMMA

That's what we were working on.

STEED

Sounds as if someone's hijacked

your research.

MOTHER

Would it be possible to use it for

military purposes?

EMMA

Directed by laser. Bounced by

satellite. Quite possible.

STEED

Where would they aim for?

MOTHER

London. The World Council of Ministers

meets soon on global defence. If you can

control the weather, you control the world.

EMMA

After the cold war ...

BAILEY

Normally, we'd be eager to

STEED

Seriously?

BAILEY

Of course. Natural weather delivered

to your door on demand. Down your

phoneline. For limited periods.

STEED

You don't say. How real does it feel?

BAILEY

As real as you wish. Hot or cold.

Humid or dry. Anything you like.

Within reason.

STEED

There are limits?

it will be more powerful. We

points to you.  No sisters?  No

undiscovered twin?

EMMA

Not that I know of.  Explanation?

STEED

According to Dr. Darling, you're a

psychopathic personality with

schizophrenic delusions, suffering from

recurring amnesia based on traumatic

repression, leading to outbursts of

anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

subconscious guilt at her other crimes.

To you ... ?

I think you owe Mrs. Peel an

explanation ...

MOTHER

Peter Peel was a first class agent.

A senior operative.

'X' department Special operations.

He was engaged in top secret research.

Top priority.  Government approved.

EMMA

The Institute ... the funding ...

MOTHER

A cover ... for us.

(beat)

I'm sorry...

EMMA

So all that time. Our work, our research

was for you ... for this? And the

accident --

DARLING

It was no accident.

EMMA

The official investigation ...

MOTHER

... was written by me.

(beat)

It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

EMMA

Who?

MOTHER

Quite frankly ... it could have

been you.

STEED

You're accusing Mrs. Peel of

killing her own husband?

MOTHER

Her husband suspected someone very

close to the operation. On the day he

died, he was setting a test.

To prove to himself -- to us that his

wife was beyond suspicion. He had to

be certain. He said he was going to

give Mrs. Peel something ...

MOTHER

... I want you to remember. Did

Peter give you anything on-that

day?

176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

No.

DR. DARLING

it was ... you who betrayed him.

He took a huge risk. The ultimate

test.

EMMA

So I'm still ...

MOTHER

Under suspicion. Everyone died in

the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were

the only survivor ...

MOTHER

This is an official matter, Mrs.

Peel. No need to take it

personally. Where are you going?

EMMA

To find out who killed my husband.

MOTHER

The doors and walls are monitored,

Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure

establishment.

She must remain here. She's

highly dangerous.

find the shoe that fits ...

TRUBSHAW

It should be easy. A Trubshaw

client has his shoes delivered

personally. The Ministry should

be able to confirm our delivery.

STEED

I'll be back ...

EMMA

Where are you going?

STEED

Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather

may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

EMMA

You needn't bother. I can't drag you

further into this. After all, I am still

the chief suspect.

STEED

No bother. Mother and Father think

I've joined you. I might as well.

EMMA

But --

STEED

Oh, and by the way, I think it's about

time you got rid of that chip on your

Fortunately my research into plastics

came in handy ...

EMMA

Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

VALENTINE

An unholy trinity ...

EMMA

(stands)

You killed my husband.

VALENTINE

For starters. Of course I had to kill

the Teddy Bears, as well ...

EMMA

Too many cooks --

VALENTINE

Spoil the majority shareholders. In

Wonderland Weather. I planned

everything, even the Ministry

recruiting you ...

EMMA

But I found you. All the clues

led me here ...

VALENTINE

Of course. I planned that, too.

EMMA

But -- why?

VALENTINE

You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't

you guess?

Come, come, you're a widow -- a

most attractive widow. Now I think

of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

VALENTINE

My latest model. A compound of

plastics and sensor chips. A big

improvement on the old X404s.

The poor thing is quite fond of me.

Emma, say hello to Emma.

VALENTINE

You know, I believe she's actually

jealous.

EMMA

Valentine, listen to me ...

309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

VALENTINE

People expect weather to be free.

They're used to it. I call that a

denial of freedom. No freedom of

choice. An abuse of human rights.

They buy water, electricity, gas.

Why shouldn't they be able to buy

their own weather if they want to?

If they have a little incentive ...

EMMA

Such as?

VALENTINE

Destruction of their local weather

systems. I can zap a thousand

Chernobyls into the air.

EMMA

The result would be ...

VALENTINE

Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop

failure.  Economic disaster.

Frostbite or sunburn ... on a

massive scale.

You've seen a few samples...

EMMA

Then what's stopping you?

VALENTINE

One very small thing. A diamond

'cyclone' chip. A thousand times

more information on a fraction of

the size. If I possess that, my

powers would be unlimited. My

dear half-brother was developing

it. But he suspected sabotage.

He gave the chip to ... you,

'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But

also your ring.

310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.

311     BACK TO SCENE

VALENTINE

The missing piece of the jigsaw.

I tried to get you to give it to me

as Peter; I tried to steal it from

you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll

be a bit less subtle.

(he slips it off her

finger; holds it up)

With this ring my plan will be

complete.

EMMA

How Wagnerian ... Do you mean

to say you've waited all these

years because you couldn't create

a chip on your own? That would

have amused Peter.

VALENTINE

Speaking of Peter, there's more good

news: You won't even have to change

your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

EMMA

What are my choices?

VALENTINE

Choices?

EMMA

I'll never marry you.

VALENTINE

One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you

alive, darling Emma. In a year or five,

you may change your mind. If you're

still in it.

VALENTINE

This little toy gave me back my face.

It can replace yours. What do you think?

Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie

Thatcher?

FATHER (V.O.)

Dr. Darling, this is Father. We

have an intruder. I repeat --

VALENTINE

Ah. That will be Steed. He followed

you. Please excuse me. I have work

to do. My most spectacular

performance. A ballet of clouds. It

was made for you. I want to give you

a heart, Emma. I want all of London

to see it. And now with this ...

(flourishes ring)

They will.

(leans close)

And for an encore: the biggest cyclone

in history will wipe the City from the
