a bustling market. CITIZENS eye the wares. MERCHANTS,

PERFORMERS, noise, and MUSIC.

SUPERIMPOSE: JOPPA, CAPITAL OF THE DOMINION OF ILLYRIA

Suddenly the market falls SILENT. Fear grips the crowd.

An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- AN OLYMPIAN

The clouds stop dead. The crowd stops. TIME STOPS. A

PRESENCE WE DO NOT SEE moves to the BASILICA, the royal

residence and assembly hall.

INT. THE BASILICA - THRONE ROOM - DAY

KING KEPHEUS, the aging, worried ruler, sits on his

throne, then stands, paces, sits again. Expecting

Flitting nearby is his Queen -- CASSIOPEIA, a fading

beauty, fiercely intelligent, but not wise; she can be

Abas uses his sword to HACK at dried wood. He bends to

pick up a branch when he HEARS the CRACK of wood. He

whirls, sword at ready. But there is nothing there.

Embarrassed, he picks up the firewood. Now he HEARS

something unidentifiable -- is that BREATHING? Spooked,

he turns to head back to camp --

A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,

grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a

twisted PAW swats it away with a ROAR. Abas tries to

raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone. He

looks up in horror as the Creature envelops him --

Only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of

features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.
