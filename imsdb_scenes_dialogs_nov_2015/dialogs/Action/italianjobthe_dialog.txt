"THE ITALIAN JOB"

Screenplay by

Donna Powers and Wayne Powers

Based on the 1969 screenplay by

Troy Kennedy-Martin

December 21, 2001

CHARLIE

Lyle?

LYLE

I've got the orbital data and SV

clock corrections for each satellite

that gets the signal. That'll make

my reading as solid as the Precise

Positioning Service that only the

D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100

meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter

vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds

time accuracy.

STEVE

Why can't he talk like a person?

CHARLIE

...Because he's not.

LYLE

I do need one more thing, Charlie.

CHARLIE

What's that?

LYLE

Someone to turn the goddamn homing

device on. No signal, no score.

CHARLIE

(to Steve)

Where're the Italians?

STEVE

Patience.

HANDSOME ROB

What's that shit?

HALF-EAR

A book. It's called reading. You

should try it some time.

HANDSOME ROB

You wanna read something. Read between

the lines.

HALF-EAR

Well here's something even you can

relate to. Albert got a lotta trim.

That genius thing is a babe magnet.

HANDSOME ROB

Lemme see that book.

STELLA (V.O.)

Hello?

JOHN BRIDGER

Hi, sweetie.

STELLA

Daddy. How are you?

JOHN BRIDGER

I'm sending you something.

STELLA

Really? Does it smell nice?

JOHN BRIDGER

No. But it's sparkly.

STELLA

Does it come with a receipt?

JOHN BRIDGER

I'm having it sent to you from the

store.

STELLA

(toweling her hair)

Why not bring it by yourself? We

could have dinner.

JOHN BRIDGER

Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.

STELLA

Let me guess. Checking out the

birthplace of Christopher Columbus.

JOHN BRIDGER

Something like that.

STELLA

With your parole officer's approval.

JOHN BRIDGER

I think I've paid my P.O. my last

visit. I liked the guy, but we never

really connected.

STELLA

What are you into, Dad? Don't break

my heart. You told me you were

through.

JOHN BRIDGER

After this, I swear to you, I am.

STELLA

You promised me. Daddy, don't do

this.

JOHN BRIDGER

Everything's going to be fine. I've

got to go now. I love you. Bye.

JOHN BRIDGER

Italians?

CHARLIE

Not yet.

STEVE

Don't worry, they'll come through.

You can trust these guys.

JOHN BRIDGER

I trust everyone. It's the devil

inside them that I don't trust.

(then, to Charlie)

Got a sec?

CHARLIE

My office.

JOHN BRIDGER

How you feeling, boss?

CHARLIE

Fine. I'm fine, fine.

JOHN BRIDGER

You know what fine, stands for, don't

you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic,

and Emotional.

CHARLIE

You've become quite the philosopher

since you quit drinking.

JOHN BRIDGER

You don't like me sober?

CHARLIE

No, I'm glad. Makes you a better

thief.

JOHN BRIDGER

For after the haul.

CHARLIE

Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's

Italians are a no-show, it's three

months prep down the shitter and

I've dragged you out of retirement

for nothing.

JOHN BRIDGER

This is kinda nice. You being the

boss with all the worries, me just

along for the ride.

CHARLIE

Ain't you sweet...

STEVE (O.S.)

Charlie!

CHARLIE

Your Italians.

STEVE

Yup. Dixie cups.

CHARLIE

Dixie cups?

STEVE

I toss 'em away if there's a problem

down the road.

LYLE

For those about to rock, we salute

you.

HANDSOME ROB

Yeah.

CHARLIE

Let's get rich.

CUT TO:

HANDSOME ROB

Can you chill out back there? You'd

make a hummingbird nervous.

HALF-EAR

I'm done. Over.

LYLE (V.O.)

Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

CUT TO:

LYLE (V.O.)

Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

CHARLIE

Sweet Jesus.

JOHN BRIDGER

"That for which all virtue is sold.

And almost every vice -- gold."

CUT TO:

JOHN BRIDGER

My name is John and I'm a very rich

alcoholic. And I'm going to live my

life one very rich day at a time.

THE CREW

Alright, John!

JOHN BRIDGER

You planned this one down to a t,

kid. It's a gift. You saw the big

picture, made contingencies, covered

the angles...

JOHN BRIDGER

Shit, you made thirty million dollars

in gold drop out of sight without

holding a gun. Who else could've

pulled that off?

CHARLIE

You could've. I had big shoes to

fill.

JOHN BRIDGER

Fill the shoes but don't follow the

footprints.

CHARLIE

What're you talking about? You've

lived the life.

JOHN BRIDGER

My life's been nothing but fake IDs,

fake business cards and divorce

papers. This is the only thing that's

real.

CHARLIE

Stella's a beautiful girl.

JOHN BRIDGER

She's amazing. And I spent half her

childhood in prison. This is a once

in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring

down the curtain after this one.

Make a new life. Find someone amazing

and be there for her.

HANDSOME ROB

Shit.

STEVE

Anyone acts stupid and his brains go

on the windshield.

CHARLIE

What the hell do you think you're

doing?

STEVE

Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of

Cracker Jack all to myself.

CHARLIE

You're not thinking this through.

It's a stupid move.

STEVE

Think so? Well you're the brilliant

one. The Master Planner. Isn't that

so, John?

STEVE

You bet on the wrong horse.

JOHN BRIDGER

We'll hunt you down. You're gonna

regret this.

STEVE

No regrets, Dixie cup.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

If you would have told me that I

would spend the next three years

searching for Steve Bandell, I would

have said that was nothing. Cause I

would have spent a lifetime looking

for that bastard if I had to.

DISSOLVE TO:

Three Years Later Philadelphia

FIRST COP

You always work in the dark?

STELLA

Buzz of the fluorescents throws me

off. She's all yours.

SECOND COP

Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack

it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.

STELLA

Now you know who to call first.

FIRST COP

You're expensive, Stella. Those guys

cut us a break on subpoena jobs.

Goodwill, community service...

STELLA

Well I do it for the money. I'll

send you the bill.

SECOND COP

Don't you want to see what's inside?

STELLA

I never look. Bye, guys.

RECEPTIONIST

How long?

STELLA

Four minutes, forty-three seconds.

RECEPTIONIST

You're the man.

STELLA

So what's on the line-up?

RECEPTIONIST

2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park.

Owner died and the wife never knew

the combination. And Todd Milliken

called. He has a prototype combination

lock he wants you to test out tomorrow

morning. Says he added two false

contact points on the tumbler.

STELLA

Tell him if I don't have it opened

in six minutes flat, breakfast is on

me.

RECEPTIONIST

And there's a Charlie Croker in your

office. He said you two know each

other.

(an aside)

And he looks pretty fine for a white

boy.

STELLA

Charlie Croker.

CHARLIE

Hi, Stella.

STELLA

Refresh my memory. After you came to

see me and told me what happened to

my father, I told you I never wanted

to see you again, didn't I?

CHARLIE

Yeah. You did.

STELLA

So I'm a little confused.

CHARLIE

I found him.

CHARLIE

I can tell you where he is.

STELLA

I don't want to know.

CHARLIE

Are you sure?

CHARLIE

He's in Los Angeles.

CHARLIE

The gold bricks he stole from us

were minted in Singapore and decorated

with the face of a Balinese girl.

I've had my tentacles out and got a

call from a friend of mine and your

father's, Philly Steak.

STELLA

When I was little he would play poker

at the house and drop quarters under

the table for me to find.

CHARLIE

He got word from an L.A. connection

named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer

has been buying bricks with the

Balinese girl on them, three or four

at a time.

STELLA

You ever heard the expression, cut

to the chase?

CHARLIE

I tracked Steve down to an address

in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed

his last name to Frezelli. And get

this: he had a Worthington 1000

installed in the house before he

even moved in. We both know that you

don't install a Worthington 1000

unless you have something precious

to guard.

STELLA

Precious or not, I don't deal with

ill-gotten goods.

CHARLIE

We boosted that gold from a terrorist

group that was about to trade it for

bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly

make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our

own little way we were doing a good

deed. Problem is, no one in my crew

can handle that safe. And I need

someone I can trust.

STELLA

And you think that's me? Haven't you

heard that I work for the other side?

CHARLIE

What I heard is that you have your

father's touch. And he was the only

safecracker I knew who could open a

Worthington 1000.

STELLA

I'm not a safecracker. I'm a

professional safe and vault

technician.

CHARLIE

You're John Bridger's daughter. And

this is our chance to set things

right.

STELLA

Our chance? Who do you think you are

coming in here? Stealing the gold

isn't going to bring my father back

to life.

CHARLIE

No, it won't.

STELLA

Then get out.

HANDSOME ROB

How'd it go with the chick?

CHARLIE

I'm working on it.

HANDSOME ROB

I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Gotta have her. Important piece of

the puzzle.

HANDSOME ROB

There has to be someone else. What

about Bill Huchins?

CHARLIE

Doing ten long at Levinworth.

HANDSOME ROB

Red O'Reilly?

CHARLIE

Chemo.

HANDSOME ROB

Martin Hernandez?

CHARLIE

Found Jesus.

HANDSOME ROB

I don't want a civilian to screw

this up.

CHARLIE

She has the skill. And the motivation.

HANDSOME ROB

Exactly. She's emotional. You know

what happens when emotion gets into

it.

CHARLIE

It's emotional for all of us at this

point. Don't kid yourself.

RICHARD

It's all in my patented sideways

glance. Like this...

RICHARD

I hit each woman on the jury with

one of these. We make contact. And I

know exactly what they're doing.

Undressing me with their eyes.

STELLA

I see...

RICHARD

The case is all but won. That's why

in jury selection I choose as many

women as possible. Except lesbians,

of course. I can tell in sixty seconds

if they're a lesbian. Want to know

how I know?

STELLA

If they don't undress you with their

eyes?

RICHARD

Precisely. Like that waitress right

there. See? She's looking at me right

below my belt. Definitely not a

lesbian.

STELLA

Your fly.

RICHARD

I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait

until later tonight.

BUSBOY

Oh, man. I'm sorry.

RICHARD

You should be. Moron. What the hell's

wrong with you?

BUSBOY

It was an accident. I'm very sorry.

RICHARD

Where's the manager? Richard Worth

is not paying to have his suit

cleaned. Damn.

(to Stella)

I'm going to... I don't believe this.

CHARLIE

I think your date's going pretty

well, what do you think?

STELLA

What are you doing here?

CHARLIE

What do you mean? I come here all

the time.

STELLA

I don't think so.

CHARLIE

Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of

crowd. See that gentleman there, he

sentenced me to 90 days in county

once. We need to talk.

STELLA

No, you need to listen. I want you

to leave. Got it?

CHARLIE

Hey, I paid valet parking prices to

get in here, not to mention a twenty

spot to the busboy to spill that

drink on Mister Zipper.

STELLA

You -- I don't believe this. You

paid someone to spill that drink?

CHARLIE

Actually, you paid for it.

CHARLIE

Didn't notice it was me who bumped

into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I

was hoping we could get to know each

other a little better before we leave

for Los Angeles. I already booked

your flight.

STELLA

You truly are a fatuous, odious man.

CHARLIE

I have no idea what you just said,

but I like the sound of it.

STELLA

Well maybe you'll understand this.

Hit the road, Jack --

CHARLIE

Charlie --

STELLA

Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause

I'll kick you in the nuts so hard

that your voice will be as high as

my heels.

CHARLIE

I'm beginning to worry about this

whole relationship.

STELLA

I'll let you in on a secret. You

can't have a relationship with a

pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind

of thief.

CHARLIE

John wasn't just a man I crewed up

with, he was my friend, he was the

closest thing to a father I ever

had. I wish to God I could bring him

back. But all I can do is go after

this guy, the guy that killed him,

and hit him where he lives.

RICHARD

Everything alright, Stella?

STELLA

Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was

just saying goodbye.

RICHARD

Can I help you with something?

CHARLIE

Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you

with my eyes.

CHARLIE

Hello.

STELLA

I'm in this for one thing, Charlie,

and one thing only. I want to see

the look on his face when his gold

is gone. He took my father from me,

I'm taking this; it's the best I can

do.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

I see Drive Defensively is your motto.

STELLA

Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let

me down.

CHARLIE

By the way you drive, I'm not

surprised you named your car after a

bottle of whiskey. Left.

STELLA

Jack Daniels was chief engineer of

the Mini. And I drive it exactly the

way it was meant to be driven.

CHARLIE

Another left.

STELLA

We're going in circles. Who's tailing

you this week?

CHARLIE

The possibilities are endless.

STELLA

Where are they?

CHARLIE

We're a little early. I didn't expect

us to get here quite that fast.

There...

CHARLIE

That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really

invented Napster...

QUICK CUT TO:

CHARLIE (V.O.)

At least that's how Lyle tells it.

CUT BACK TO:

CHARLIE

Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty

percent of his hearing in the fifth

grade.

QUICK CUT TO:

CHARLIE (V.O.)

One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many.

KID

That was rad!

HALF-EAR

Wha'?

CUT BACK TO:

CHARLIE

Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He

once drove all the way to L.A. just

so he could set the record for longest

freeway chase.

QUICK CUT TO:

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Smashed the mark by twelve minutes.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

He got a hundred and ten love letters

sent to his jail cell from women who

saw him on TV.

CUT BACK TO:

STELLA

And what about you?

CHARLIE

I've been a thief since I had baby

teeth.

QUICK CUT TO:

BULLY

Cough it up, Charlie!

CLASSMATE

So much for lunch.

SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE

You need a dollar?

CLASSMATE

I thought he took your last one.

SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE

He did.

SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE

But I got lots more now.

CUT BACK TO:

CHARLIE

This is Stella. She's working with

us on this one. IDs?

LYLE

(reading his)

Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once --

have a cool name?

HALF-EAR

(also complaining)

220 pounds? Try 180.

HANDSOME ROB

Try 'Deal A Meal'.

LYLE

I don't even have a cool nickname.

CHARLIE

Enough of this sewing-circle shit.

Phones.

HALF-EAR

Philly Steak says these are clean as

a whistle. He also got us four dozen

internal chips with different numbers.

Change out the chips twice a day.

CHARLIE

We travel to L.A. separately.

LYLE

You still haven't told us the most

important thing. What exactly is the

job, Charlie? And who exactly is

she?

CHARLIE

This is Stella Bridger. And we're

finishing the job that we started in

Italy.

HALF-EAR

Holy shit. It's about time.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

We need an in to get a video blueprint

of the interior. We're not going

into this place blind. Half-Ear, you

take the first surveillance shift.

Who goes in, who goes out, levels of

security, you know the drill.

HALF-EAR

You got it.

CHARLIE

I also want audio surveillance on

his phone.

LYLE

I'll hack into the phone company's

central office remote observance

monitoring system and fool it into

thinking there's a legal tap on the

line. Reroute the digital copies of

his calls to our own listening post.

CHARLIE

How long?

LYLE

I'll burn through the night, have it

up and running before morning.

CHARLIE

(to Handsome Rob)

We need to know how long to get from

the house to Union Station downtown.

HANDSOME ROB

No problemo.

CHARLIE

Stella. How much time will you need

with the safe?

STELLA

I'll have it open in five minutes

flat.

HANDSOME ROB

It's not the same as opening a safe

for the cops. Your heart will be

pounding in your ears. Perspiration

on your fingertips. It's a whole

different ball game.

STELLA

You get me to the safe, I'll open

it.

HALF-EAR

(into recorder)

We've got an anti-scaling fence.

Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw

won't work. We'll need Nitramon.

HALF-EAR

Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in

the holster. Security booth is

accessible and ideal for a triple

charger chemical grenade.

HALF-EAR

Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate

dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie.

Because dogs are racist. That's a

natural fact. Someone else deal with

'em.

LYLE

(into micro cassette

player)

Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System.

Monitors 132 points for intrusion,

fire, and environmental hazards.

Best way around it is to get a back

door password, trip the alarm during

the heist, then call it in as a false

alarm.

CUT TO:

LYLE

(into micro cassette

recorder)

15:25. There he is. He's gained 15

to 20 pounds living off our money.

And Handsome Rob, you're going to be

pissed when you see his wheels.

CHARLIE

(into micro cassette

recorder)

Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.

YEVHEN

You're right on time.

YEVHEN

All those poor bastards out there

putting their life savings in banks

and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do

they think -- that when the collapse

comes they can depend on the

government? I don't think so.

STEVE

Is the camera off?

YEVHEN

Of course. Just like you said. I

never tape you, you can see for

yourself.

YEVHEN

Governments are nothing more than

puppets on the strings of the

Trilateral Commission with their

twisted gods.

YEVHEN

I mean, it's so obvious that in a

world where NAFTA can overturn the

Supreme Court, not to mention

Microsoft's nefarious financial

machinations, this, is our only

refuge; gold.

YEVHEN

Plus a little walking around money.

HANDSOME ROB

Where's a grenade launcher when you

need one?

HANDSOME ROB

Doesn't matter what time it is. It's

either bad traffic, peak traffic, or

slit-your-wrists traffic.

HALF-EAR

You gotta ride the Metro-Rail, man.

HANDSOME ROB

I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a

ton of gold, genius.

CHARLIE

What's your guesstimate?

HANDSOME ROB

If we had all green lights, fourteen

minutes. But in the twenty times

I've done it, the average is thirty-

two minutes, with a top time of fifty

minutes.

CHARLIE

Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.

CHARLIE

When cars first started catching on,

workers on tall ladders would use

these swiveling colored boards for

traffic signals. Now whenever

Rockefeller would take the drive

from his mansion to his office on

Wall Street, the workers would make

sure that he got green boards all

the way.

HANDSOME ROB

How do we get all green lights?

CHARLIE

Lyle?

LYLE

Let me see what I can do.

HALF-EAR

Did you know that the first traffic

signal to be patented was invented

by a black man named Garrett Morgan?

(to Charlie)

You're not the only one who watches

the History Channel.

HANDSOME ROB

We still need an in to get the video

blueprint.

LYLE

Carpet cleaners? Gutter cleaners?

Flower delivery?

CHARLIE

We'll never get by the guard unless

they're certain it's legit. I'm

thinking cable TV. We cut his cable,

he calls the cable company. We show

up. Send a cable technician into the

house with a pinhole video camera

while we get a feed through an RF

antenna.

HANDSOME ROB

Who plays cable technician? Steve

thinks we're all dead.

STELLA

If you're all dead, I guess I'm the

man for the job.

CHARLIE

Are you up for it?

STELLA

In for a penny, in for a pound.

LYLE

I'm telling you. He claims he named

it Napster because his hair is so

nappy underneath that cap of his.

But I know the real reason. It's

because I was NAPPING when he stole

the idea from me. I should've been

on the cover of Wired magazine.

HANDSOME ROB

Would you clam up. You'd give a

woodpecker a headache.

LYLE

I'm the Napster.

HANDSOME ROB

Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up:

cable chick.

LYLE

Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she

calls the other one.

HANDSOME ROB

And it's such a mystery why you don't

have a girlfriend.

LYLE

I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately

even though the relationship ceased

in an objective reality, it's still

going on in my mind.

(tapping his head)

That woman's lived in here rent-free

for four years.

LYLE

Okay. All we need now is a work shirt

like this one and a service truck

like that one. You think Stella will

be able to pull it off?

HANDSOME ROB

I have my doubts, but there's no

talking to Charlie.

LYLE

Maybe he's been inserting his hard

drive into her software. Clouds the

judgment.

HANDSOME ROB

He knows better than to mix business

with pleasure.

(getting out of the

car)

Only I'm allowed to do that.

LYLE

Where you going?

HANDSOME ROB

To get a work shirt and a service

truck.

SECURITY GUARD

What can I do for you, Mister

Frezelli?

STEVE

The cable's out. See if you can get

someone over here to fix it'.

SECURITY GUARD

Yes, sir.

LYLE

Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak

version of Purple Haze before.

CHARLIE

When's the appointment?

LYLE

Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

SECURITY GUARD

Hello.

CHARLIE

Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable.

I understand your service is out and

an appointment was set up for

Thursday.

SECURITY GUARD

Yes.

CHARLIE

Well we have a technician working in

your area who finished with an

appointment earlier than expected.

Will someone be there for the next

hour?

SECURITY GUARD

Sure. That'd be great.

CHARLIE

Our technician will see you then.

Have a nice day.

SECURITY GUARD

You too.

CHARLIE

Let's check the camera.

LYLE

Stella, you're going patriotic today.

CHARLIE

He's got cable lines in the kitchen,

living room, bedroom and a cable

modem on the computer in the office.

Try to get a 360 look at each room.

And walk slowly or the image will

streak.

LYLE

I printed these up to look like

paperwork from Adelphia. When you're

done, ask him to sign and date the

bottom.

CHARLIE

How you doing?

STELLA

Fine. I'm fine.

CHARLIE

You know what fine, stands for? Fucked-

up, Insecure --

STELLA & CHARLIE

Neurotic and Emotional.

HALF-EAR

Here's our spot.

HANDSOME ROB

Girls girls girls.

HALF-EAR

Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.

HANDSOME ROB

(scowls)

Y'got a great job.

BURLY MAN

Pays the rent, asshole. You got a

problem, talk to Skinny Pete.

SKINNY PETE

Philly Steak sent you?

HALF-EAR

That's right.

SKINNY PETE

So was I right-on about the gold

bricks or what?

HALF-EAR

That's really not what I'm here to

talk about. Philly Steak said you

could get us some supplies.

SKINNY PETE

What do you need?

HALF-EAR

A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon

primer. Detonating cord. Two triple

charger chemical grenades. Launcher.

SKINNY PETE

Nine p.m.

HANDSOME ROB

Should we hang here? Check out the

dancers?

SKINNY PETE

Nothing's going down here. I don't

shit in my own yard, do you?

HANDSOME ROB

No, but I take a whizz off the deck

sometimes.

SKINNY PETE

Five thousand dollars. And don't be

late.

CUT TO:

STEVE

It's all right. They won't bother

you now.

STELLA

It's okay. I'm used to running into

all sorts of dogs on my job.

STEVE

I'm Steve.

STELLA

Becky.

STELLA

You want to show me the problem?

STEVE

Yeah. Course. This way.

STELLA

I'd like to check the cable modem

first.

STEVE

I'll show you.

OFFICE

She turns her body so the mini-lens

can stare at the gleaming black

Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes

up to his desk and pretends to work

on the cable line that feeds into

his computer.

STEVE

The cable guy who hooked this up

weighed about 300 pounds, didn't

wear any underwear, and his pants

slung a little too low if you know

what I mean.

STELLA

There we go. Now onto the TVs.

STEVE

Is it fixed?

STELLA

Turn it on and see.

LYLE (V.O.)

Now.

STEVE

Perfect.

STELLA

Then it looks like you're all set.

STEVE

Have we met before?

STELLA

I don't think so. Sign here, please.

STELLA

Date.

STEVE

You read my mind.

STELLA

Oh, no. I meant that I need you to

put the date by your signature. It's

the 26th.

STEVE

I know what you meant.

(he smiles)

This might seem a little sudden,

but... would you like to have dinner

with me?

STELLA

I don't think that'd be a very good

idea.

STEVE

Why? Is there some kind of cable-

rule against dating customers?

STELLA

No, it's my rule. I don't accept

dates from men I've just met. I've

only known you five minutes.

STEVE

Then I guess I'll have to sabotage

my cable over and over again until

you get to know me better.

STEVE

Look, I'm just talking about dinner.

Friday night. It's no big deal. If

you don't like me, you never have to

see me again. You know I'm not going

to stop until you say yes.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

I know it was tough in there.

STELLA

He touched my hand. And he came-on

to me. That slimy, disgusting man

came onto me and I had to pretend

that I liked it.

STELLA

You do know what this means... I've

created our window of opportunity.

CHARLIE

I know. When Steve leaves Friday

night, we go in. By the time he

realizes you've stood him up, we'll

be long gone with the gold.

CUT TO:

HALF-EAR

Skinny Pete.

HANDSOME ROB

The guy makes Jabba the Hut look

like a spokesman for the Subway

Sandwiches' diet.

HALF-EAR

What do you think?

HANDSOME ROB

I'm trying not to.

HALF-EAR

Drive slow. We crash and we're a

crater.

HOMEBOY

What'd you put in the trunk?

HALF-EAR

Suitcase.

HOMEBOY

Just gimme the keys before I pop a

cap in your head.

HOMEBOY

Hurry up!

HALF-EAR

Christ.

CHARLIE

Looks like that went without a hitch.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Lyle, what's the distance from the

front door to the vault?

CHARLIE

Lyle?

HANDSOME ROB

He only answers to The Napster now.

CHARLIE

I'm not calling you The Napster.

LYLE

You call him Half-Ear.

HALF-EAR

That wasn't my idea.

LYLE

And him, Handsome Rob.

CHARLIE

That's only cause he is Handsome

Rob.

LYLE

And I'm The Napster.

CHARLIE

How far?

(sighs, gives in)

The Napster.

LYLE

Five hundred yards.

CHARLIE

So here's the riddle. How do we get

over a ton of gold from the vault to

the getaway car?

STELLA

How wide is the hallway?

LYLE

Only six feet.

QUICK CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

STELLA

Jack Daniels, straight up.

CHARLIE

Minis?

STELLA

We could rumble right up the front

steps, bring the getaway car right

to the vault, and then straight to

Union Station.

HANDSOME ROB

We'll need three to hold the gold.

HANDSOME ROB

I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S.

Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60

in 4.2.

COUNTER BABE

As long as it's a convertible -- I

always like to have my top down.

COUNTER BABE

Do you know them?

HANDSOME ROB

Never seen 'em before in my life.

CUT TO:

YEVHEN

You're early.

STEVE

And I'm in a hurry, okay?

YEVHEN

Of course the Florida vote rigging

was a CIA and Mob operation.

STEVE

(with total disinterest)

That a fact?

YEVHEN

You want facts? Fact: CIA officials

were allowed free -- and illegal --

access to official election material.

YEVHEN

Now given the sordid history in Miami

of joint ventures between Central

Intelligence and the Mob, which led

to the unsuccessful attempts to kill

Fidel Castro and the successful

assassination of your President John

F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises

numerous red flags.

STEVE

And I'd love to hear more about it,

but like I said...

YEVHEN

Don't worry, we'll have you out in

no time. The cash is on its way.

STEVE

On its way?

YEVHEN

My cousin is bringing it over.

STEVE

Your cousin?

YEVHEN

Yes. Cousin Mashkov.

STEVE

He's on his way?

YEVHEN

Don't worry, he will be here any

minute.

STEVE

The tape's off?

YEVHEN

Of course. Believe me, he doesn't

want to be on video, either.

STEVE

Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times,

that I never wanted to meet with

anyone but you?

YEVHEN

I know. But it's his cash. He uses

me to launder money. I'm just a

middleman.

STEVE

And a middleman is supposed to stay

in the middle.

YEVHEN

But you were early. Please. Don't

worry. It will be fine. My cousin's

a cool guy. Like I am.

STEVE

What you are, is a Dixie cup.

YEVHEN

Dixie cup?

CUT TO:

MASHKOV

My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.

DANYA

By who?

MASHKOV

That's what I'm going to find out.

DANYA

And what will you do when you find

this piece of shit who killed your

cousin?

MASHKOV

I'll hack off his limbs and bury him

while he's still alive.

DANYA

Okay. But now we should stop talking

Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.

(switching to accented

ENGLISH)

How are you tonight, Karen?

KAREN

Hungry.

DANYA

Then eat your Frosted Flakes.

KAREN

(like Tony the Tiger)

They're grrrreat!

DANYA

Such a perfect girl.

CHARLIE

How are our matchbox cars?

HANDSOME ROB

Souped.

STELLA

Don't let their size fool you. These

were rally cars back in the day. 135

mph, 155 horsepower --

LYLE

Do I get to drive one?

HANDSOME ROB

No.

LYLE

Why not?

HANDSOME ROB

Because you can't navigate your way

out of a parking lot. Here's your

ride.

LYLE

But he ran into me.

HANDSOME ROB

He's not driving either.

(to Stella)

You ever got a speeding ticket?

STELLA

Let's put it this way: I can only

get insurance through companies that

advertise on TV at 3:00 in the

morning.

HANDSOME ROB

You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.

CHARLIE

I got us spots for three cars on a

car carrier and five first class

seats. Train 59 from Union Station

to New Orleans.

HALF-EAR

That's N'Or'lins, Yankee.

CHARLIE

What's the word on Rockefeller?

LYLE

The Traffic Control Center is on the

top floor of a building on Olympic

and Grand. They get their data from

pavement loop detectors and video

image vehicle detectors. That info

is fused together by specially

designed algorithms to predict traffic

conditions and control the traffic

lights. So all I have to do now is

change the data by creating my own

algorithm.

CHARLIE

What can I do to help?

LYLE

I need to hard-wire into the

mainframes.

LYLE

B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's

linear discriminant function

coefficients, SpdRat is the speed

ratio, and TTratio is the travel

time ratio.

CHARLIE

I have no idea what you're doing.

Just do it fast.

LYLE

We own this place.

CUT TO:

MASHKOV

$2000. And this is the new girl.

Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's

guys picked her up hitchhiking

downtown.

DETECTIVE

Those tits'd make Dracula rise from

his coffin at high-noon.

MASHKOV

They're all yours Saturday. You can

do whatever you want to her. Her

name is Karen...

DETECTIVE

You're too generous.

MASHKOV

I needed a fast answer.

DETECTIVE

And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy

who works the counter at your cousin's

shop told me that someone named Skinny

Pete had been asking around about

gold bricks with the face of a

Balinese girl on them. Same gold

bricks your cousin was buying.

MASHKOV

You talked to this Skinny Pete?

DETECTIVE

I thought you'd want a shot at him

first.

CUT TO:

STELLA

You want the safe cracked, don't

you?

CHARLIE

Yeah.

STELLA

Then I have to have perfect nails.

CHARLIE

Are you making this shit up?

STELLA

I just let you in on a valuable trade

secret.

LYLE

Charlie.

CHARLIE

Yeah?

LYLE

Steve called to confirm a 7:30

reservation at Ago's. And as for

your getaway, not even Rockefeller

had it so good.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Radio check.

HANDSOME ROB

Got cha, boss.

STELLA

Loud and clear.

LYLE

Check.

CUT TO:

LYLE

For those about to rock, we salute

you.

CHARLIE

This is it, guys. Moment of truth.

VALET

Are you hear for the Baxter party,

sir?

CHARLIE

Shit. Stella?

STELLA

I know. I've got a date tonight.

CHARLIE

You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his

jokes. You need him to ask you out

again.

CUT TO:

STELLA

You really make laugh.

STEVE

So here's what I have lined up for

after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep.

The Ferrari always gets me to the

front of the line. We'll do a little

dancing...

STELLA

Not tonight. I don't want to be out

late.

STEVE

Why the curfew?

STELLA

Let's just say I've made some wrong

calls in the past. I like to take

things slow, cautious. Next time...

STEVE

I understand. You have nothing to

worry about. You can trust me.

STELLA

I trust everyone. It's the devil

inside them that I don't trust.

STEVE

That's an interesting saying.

STELLA

What?

STEVE

There's only person I've ever heard

say that. Used to say it all the

time.

STELLA

Who was that?

STEVE

A man named John Bridger. Where did

you pick up that phrase?

STELLA

Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting

me.

STEVE

John Bridger was a thief. And he had

a daughter. About your age. He told

me that she took over a safe and

lock company that he used as a front.

STELLA

Let go of my wrist. What is wrong

with you? It's just a saying.

STEVE

No wonder I liked you right away.

Just like I liked your old man, right

up until the moment I shot him in

the head. Now tell me who you're

working with and tell me the plan.

Do it now or we'll go for a ride and

I'll break every bone in your body.

CHARLIE

Something wrong, Steve? You look

like you want to call Ghostbusters.

HALF-EAR

She's coming with us. You got a

problem with that?

STEVE

Fine by me. But it's you that has

the problem.

LYLE

How do you figure?

STEVE

You've just blown the one thing you

had going in your favor, the element

of surprise. And I was surprised.

(he laughs unpleasantly)

Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys

come out of the woodwork. For a minute

I thought maybe you were ghosts. But

you're screwed now.

(an arrogant sneer a

Half-Ear)

Did you figure out how to take care

of my security guard? I'll hire five

more.

(at Lyle)

You know how to bypass my alarm

system? I'll have a new one installed

tomorrow.

(at Handsome Rob)

Does it tear you up inside seeing

what car I drive? I'll buy a matching

one in red.

(at Stella)

You think you can crack my safe?

You'll end up the same way as your

dad.

(then to Charlie, all

smiles)

Looks like Good Time Charlie's got

the blues.

CHARLIE

You can wear that shit-eating grin

on your face, but I know under that

Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat.

And you're not going to sleep a minute

tonight. Cause you thought you'd

gotten away with it free and clear.

You thought you'd gotten rid of us.

You're the one who's screwed. Right

to the wall.

STEVE

Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart

you every step of the way. And this

time, I'll bury you myself.

CHARLIE

(taking the challenge)

Get more guards. Change the alarm.

Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be

here. Sleep tight.

CUT TO:

MASHKOV

(in accented English)

Do you know who I am?

SKINNY PETE

You work for Danya.

MASHKOV

Yes. And you are gonna be straight

with me and everything's gonna be

okay. You fuck with me, I will be

ruthless.

SKINNY PETE

I understand.

MASHKOV

I don't want you to understand. I

want you to overstand.

SKINNY PETE

Overstand... Okay.

MASHKOV

Because if you don't overstand, I

will use this.

MASHKOV

Someone was asking about gold bars

with a Balinese girl's face on them.

I want the name of this man.

CUT TO:

LYLE

Well we scared him alright. He's

flying the coop. His security guard

called Brink's Armored Car Service

to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his

house, then JetClub to confirm a

MD11 cargo plane departing from the

Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.

CHARLIE

Confirmed? How'd we miss the first

calls?

LYLE

They must have been cellular. The

cargo plane is being chartered to

Mexico City.

HANDSOME ROB

Only place with worse smog and traffic

than L.A.

STELLA

Once the charter's in the air, he

could change the flight path to

anywhere. And good-bye gold.

CHARLIE

Not so fast. This is good news for

us.

HANDSOME ROB

Good news?

CHARLIE

Sometimes when you're up to your ass

in alligators you forget that you

started off trying to drain the swamp.

HANDSOME ROB

Meaning what the fuck?

CHARLIE

We've been trying to get to the gold

in the safe. Now the safe is coming

to us. We'll boost it in transit.

HANDSOME ROB

Charlie. He could take a dozen

different routes to the airport and

we have no idea which one. We can't

take out an armored truck during

rush hour.

CHARLIE

We're already set to do it. Napster:

how would you like to create the

biggest traffic jam in the history

of Los Angeles?

LYLE

Keep talking.

CHARLIE

You gridlock every route except the

one we choose. Force the truck to go

exactly where we want it to go.

HANDSOME ROB

But where do we want it? We can't

shoot it out with armed guards in a

Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we

pulled it off, the cops would be all

over us, chasing us all the way to

Union Station. We're outmanned and

outgunned.

CHARLIE

But not outsmarted.

CHARLIE

We'll do it like the Italian job.

We'll make thirty million in gold

drop out of sight.

CHARLIE

Who else has this number?

HALF-EAR

No one but us.

CHARLIE

Hello?

PHILLY STEAK

Why'd you do it?

CHARLIE

(informing the crew)

Philly Steak.

(then into phone)

Do what?

PHILLY STEAK

Yevhen. The Ukrainian gold, dealer.

You didn't, have to clip him, for

Christ's sakes.

CHARLIE

Clip him?

PHILLY STEAK

Listen to me. You've gotta get out

of L.A. Now.

CHARLIE

What're you talking about? We didn't

clip anybody.

PHILLY STEAK

Well Skinny Pete just called me.

Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct

impression that you did.

CHARLIE

Why does he think that?

PHILLY STEAK

Because you wanted, to know about

the gold with the Balinese Girl.

Plus I guess Pete was under duress.

This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul

Fucking Bunyan.

CHARLIE

Do you know how to get in touch with

him?

PHILLY STEAK

Yeah but...

CHARLIE

Maybe there's a way we can play this

to our advantage.

PHILLY STEAK

Are you out of your mind? Listen to

me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now.

Cause if there's one thing I know,

it's that you never mess with Mother

Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother-

fucking Ukrainians.

MASHKOV

He's going to be on Train 59 for New

Orleans.

UKRAINIAN

You sure your source is good?

MASHKOV

I'm sure.

Did you know Einstein's 7th grade

teacher told him he was a moron who'd

never amount to anything? Same as

mine.

CHARLIE

Still hope for that Nobel Prize.

HALF-EAR

Not me, man. But I did get my college

diploma.

CHARLIE

No shit. I thought you dropped out

of high school.

HALF-EAR

Got my GED after Italy then just

kept going.

CHARLIE

How'd you manage that, all the jobs

we've been pulling?

HALF-EAR

Quit going to strip clubs. Went to

night school instead. City college

is all.

CHARLIE

Good for you. That's a real feather

in your cap.

HALF-EAR

I didn't want to say anything to the

guys.

CHARLIE

Secret's safe with me.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Napster. How goes it up there? Over.

LYLE

Working on the Metro Rail system.

Almost ready.

HANDSOME ROB

Everything's quiet here. Over.

CHARLIE

You okay?

HALF-EAR

Ah huh. Just need a moment's

meditation.

CHARLIE

Now?

HALF-EAR

I'm about to insert a wire into a

detonator tube and if the wire touches

the sides of tube, we'll be blown to

Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with

yourself.

CHARLIE

Take all the time you need.

HALF-EAR

My work here is done.

HANDSOME ROB

Problemo.

CHARLIE

What is it?

HANDSOME ROB

He's brought in three identical

armored trucks.

CHARLIE

Shit. Decoys. It's like a shell game

on wheels.

LYLE

How can I reroute the truck if I

don't know which truck to reroute?

HANDSOME ROB

Three Brink's trucks are leaving

with motorcycle escorts, plus Steve

in his Ferrari.

LYLE

How're we going to figure out which

truck has the gold?

CHARLIE

You can monitor the traffic video

cameras from your laptop, right?

LYLE

Yeah.

CHARLIE

Where's the first camera the trucks

will go past?

LYLE

Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to

cross that.

CHARLIE

The weight of the gold will lower

the suspension on the truck.

LYLE

Lines up with the top of the sign.

Next...

LYLE

First two are the same.

LYLE

That's our truck! License plate

AWP82092.

CHARLIE

Gridlock time.

YOU'LL NEVER SHUT DOWN THE REAL NAPSTER!

CHRISTINA GRIEGO

This is Christina Griego with your

drive-home traffic report on KNX.

I'm looking down on Hollywood

Boulevard and this is definitely a

CIG alert.

STEVE

What the hell?

LYLE

Opening up a space on North Highland.

GUARD

Get us out of here.

DRIVER

I'm trying.

LYLE

He's taking it...

LYLE

I now command you to turn left.

LYLE

I've got it on Hollywood Boulevard.

Time to slow down.

CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.)

According to the police, the computers

at the Traffic Control Center are

down.

STEVE

Sonovabitch.

CHARLIE

Gentlemen, start your engines.

CHARLIE

Give us the flag when you're ready.

LYLE

Shutting down the rail as we speak.

LYLE

Tunnel's clear. Go!

LYLE

Coming into position...

LYLE

Five... Four...

LYLE

Three...

LYLE (V.O.)

Two... One...

LYLE (V.O.)

Do it.

CHARLIE

Nice work.

HALF-EAR

Well like Einstein almost said: genius

is ten percent inspiration, ninety

percent detonation.

CHARLIE

Let's get our gold.

CHRISTINA GRIEGO

I've seen earthquakes, mudslides,

fires, riots, but this... Let me try

to paint a picture for our listeners.

CHRISTINA GRIEGO (V.O.)

There's been some kind of an explosion

and a Brink's truck has just dropped

down into the Metro Rail Blue Line.

STEVE

The truck's in the Metro Rail. Where

does the Blue Line go back above

ground?

MOTORCYCLE GUARD

It comes out at Flower & Pico.

CHARLIE

Stella?

STELLA

Shhh...

STELLA

You know when you said this wouldn't

be the same as opening a safe for

the cops?

HANDSOME ROB

Yeah.

STELLA

Did you have to be right?

CHARLIE

Don't you want to see what's inside?

STELLA

I never look.

CHARLIE

Trust me. You wanna look.

CHARLIE

Split up!

How about far, far away?

KAREN

MASHKOV

Take out your gun and drop it on the

STEVE

Who are you?

MASHKOV

You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

STEVE

I never knew anyone named Yevhen.

MASHKOV

Get in the trunk. Not that trunk,

this one. That gold is for us. A

gift from some old friends of yours.

They said to tell you that they didn't

mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack,

as long as you didn't get any. Not

even the toy surprise.

STEVE

Please. Don't shoot me. Please...

MASHKOV

Don't worry. That wasn't the deal.

I'm not going to shoot you.

STEVE

Thank you. Thank God.

MASHKOV

(to the others)

He really thought I was going to

shoot him.

MASHKOV

No. No. I'm not going to shoot you.

I'm going to hack off your limbs and

bury you while you're still alive.

It has been a hectic day.

It's about that thing you said to me

That thing?

You said that you can't have a

robber, or any kind of thief.

STELLA

Oh... That thing.

Yeah. I do.
