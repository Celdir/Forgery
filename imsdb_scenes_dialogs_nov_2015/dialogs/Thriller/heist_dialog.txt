of forever...

118.

BERGMAN (cont'd)

...this way you walk away, you Lucky Dog.

MOORE

Take the gold. Take the gold off, leave me

the boat.

BERGMAN

Don't make me lose my respect for you. By the

way, we already had the gold. Pincus gave it

up. That's what she traded for your life.

(PAUSE)

She's got a very commercial mind...

BERGMAN (cont'd)

...take it back to the boatyard

(HE MAKES A DIALING MOTION)

Get a number, call'im up, we need a private

slip, what do you call it, a shed. Tell'im

we'll pay in cash. Get the thing squared

away, we'll take the gold out...

(THE HENCHMAN STARTS TO GO OFF,

NODDING)

BELLA

(TO MOORE)

You don't want to stay here, pal. They're

coming for you... they're coming for you...

FRAN

(TO BERGMAN)

Leave him some money. Give him some money...

don't let him go out there with nothing...

(SHE GETS INTO THE CAR.)

FRAN (cont'd)

I'm sorry, baby.

BERGMAN

Yeah, we don't want, to send you out there

broke... here: go buy yourself something

nice... You don't mind if I pay you in

Gold...?

119.

BERGMAN (cont'd)

A knife, gimme another knife...

BERGMAN (cont'd)

...I don't... I need you to tell me where

the gold is.

BERGMAN (cont'd)

Where's the gold?

MOORE

Where would you like it to be...?

BERGMAN

What is it, with your pal...?

BERGMAN (cont'd)

And then   where is he now. Your  running buddy?

No, It's   all over, and I need to know:

Where Is   The Gold. I hate to do  anything as

dramatic   as "counting to Three," but... ONE:

(MORE)

120.

BERGMAN (cont'd)

(HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A

HENCHMAN PUTS A PISTOL INTO IT.)

BERGMAN (cont'd)

Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the

world must you, why in the hell, a guy like

you, would you put me in a position... Aahh,

the Hell with it, life is too short, you

know what? Fuck you...

MOORE

How you doing?

BLANE

I'm leaking?

(PAUSE)

You hurt?

THUG

(WEAKLY)

I... I...

BERGMAN

Cute.   Very cute.

121.

BERGMAN (cont'd)

Don't you want to hear my dying words...?

MOORE

I just did.

DISSOLVE TO:

BLANE

(VO)

I hear...

BLANE (cont'd)

I hear if you put milk into it, it lesses the

chance of stomach distress.

MOORE

Hey, you can't worry about every little

thing...

WAITRESS

Heat it up?

MOORE

(AS HE RISES)

No, I think we gotta be moving on.

BLANE

Too bad about Pinky.

MOORE

Ain't that so.

BLANE

...always made me laugh.

122.

MOORE

Well, what more can you say of anyone?

BLANE

Nothing...

BLANE (cont'd)

Robert the Bruce...

MOORE

Yeah?

BLANE

Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce...

MOORE

...what?

BLANE

Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce?

(PAUSE)

MOORE

Because he asked them to.

BLANE

Y'go to that Plastic Surgeon, don't lettem put

you all the way under. I knew a guy in

Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke

up, sucker'd given him a pair of tits.

MOORE

Yeah, that's no bargain.

BLANE

Well, he landed back inside, he never had to

want for Cigarettes...

MOORE

Send your cut there...?

BLANE

Wire it there, when you get where you're

going.

MOORE

That I will, Pal.

123.

BLANE

I hear it's nice down there in the Sun.

MOORE

Zat where I'm going?

BLANE

Wherever it is, Brother, don't come back.

(BEAT. MOORE NODS.)

MOORE

Yeah, I knew you'd show.

FRAN

Good, good plan, baby...

MOORE

Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a

backup plan...

124.

FRAN

That's the right way to do it.

MOORE

End of the day, though, end of the day,

what's the important thing...?

FRAN

That's right.

MOORE

What's the important thing...?

(PAUSE)

FRAN

Shame about Pinky...

MOORE

You heard.

(OF TRUCK)

Come on, get in.

FRAN

Y'all loaded up?

MOORE

C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You

heard about Pinky...

FRAN

Yeah.   I heard. I'm sorry about that.

MOORE

Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that

little bit. Dinnit...?

FRAN

Yes, It did.

MOORE

...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.

FRAN

...and, so, you got hurt.

MOORE

Well, you can't do it halfway, can you...?

FRAN

No, anything you do, you got to do full-out.

Don't you?

125.

MOORE

Indeed you do.

FRAN

And, sometimes...

(PAUSE)

MOORE

(TOUCHES HIS FOREHEAD, AND THE

BRUISE, WINCES)

Then, that's just the Price.

FRAN

That's right. That's what you taught me.

That's part of it.

MOORE

Well, but didn't you do great. Played it down

to the last recorded syllable...

FRAN

I went to a good school.

MOORE

Never seen it done n'y better.   You hotwalked

that dude so good.

FRAN

...thank you, Joe.

MOORE

Cooled him out the livelong day.   You made it

look so real.

MOORE (cont'd)

(TO HIMSELF)

...yes, you did.

FRAN

Well, you know...

(PAUSE)

MOORE

...what d'you mean, "that's part of it?"

FRAN

I don't get you?

MOORE

I was talking about Pinky.

FRAN

Uh huh.

126.

MOORE

I said we paid the price.         And you said.   We

paid part of it.

(PAUSE)

FRAN

Yes.    That's right.

MOORE

...what's the rest of it...?

(PAUSE)

What's the rest of it...?

MOORE (cont'd)

Oh.

(PAUSE)

BELLA

Well. They don't always leave with the Ones

they came In with.

MOORE

(PAUSE)

Oh.

FRAN

(TO MOORE)

It was dead, anyway.

(PAUSE)

You know it was.

MOORE

Was it...?

FRAN

(PAUSE)

You shouldn't of sent me to him.

MOORE

Well, you can't think of everything.

(PAUSE)

127.

MOORE

I'm sorry.

(PAUSE)

FRAN

Well...

MOORE

I'm sorry...

FRAN

You knew it was over...

FRAN (cont'd)

(TO BELLA)

...it's in the back.

MOORE

(OF BELLA)

Why dun' he shoot me?

FRAN

Cause it's over. It's all done.    That's the

deal.

MOORE

He ain't gonna shoot me?

FRAN

No.

MOORE

Then he hadn't aughta point a gun at me.

(PAUSE)

It's insincere...

MOORE (cont'd)

Oh, God, I'm tired...

FRAN

(TO MOORE)

I'm sorry, Baby.

MOORE

Well, no.   You told me, "you knew him

before."

FRAN

That's right. I did.

(TO BELLA)

(MORE)

128.

FRAN (cont'd)

Get in and drive

(TO MOORE)

I'm sorry.

MOORE

You said that.

(PAUSE)

Well.

(PAUSE)

You must be under quite a lot of stress.

FRAN

Hmm.

MOORE

It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...?

FRAN

Cute as a Chinese baby...

MOORE

Thanks for everything.

(FRAN GETS UP INTO THE TRUCK)

FRAN

You'll be alright.

MOORE

You think so?

FRAN

You always are.

(PAUSE)

MOORE

Well, I missed this trick, though, didn't

I...?

FRAN

...the best laid plans of mice and men...

MOORE

...what?

FRAN

I said Nobody's Perfect.

(PAUSE)

You take care.

(TO BELLA)

Alright, let's go.

129.

FADE OUT.
