PURPOSES ONLY

HOWARD

How about it, Jeff?

JEFF

Done.

2.

HOWARD (O.S.)

Nice legs.

JEFF

(matter-of-fact)

Sniper.

HOWARD

Where?

JEFF

High-rise. Top floor.        Window in

the middle.

HOWARD

(looking through

his binoculars)

Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go

back to the woman. Now!

HOWARD (O.S.)

Back to the sniper.

HOWARD

Stay tight on the sniper.

Jesus -- look at him! He's about

fourteen! Don't lose this!

3.

JEFF

He sees her.

HOWARD

Stay on her. If she runs, widen

and try to get her and sniper in

the same frame.

JEFF

I said he sees her.

HOWARD

I heard you.    Stay on her.

JEFF

(under his breath)

No... no...

4.

JEFF

Sniper!   Sniper! Sni--

AMY

God, I missed you.

JEFF

Me too.

AMY

Let's get out of here. Where's

your equipment? Don't tell me you

checked it?

JEFF

(holds up his bag)

This is it.

AMY

No camera?

AMY

No nothing?

AMY

Ah ha.

CUT TO:

6.

AMY

Jeff?

AMY

Can I come in?

JEFF (O.S.)

Sure.

AMY

Couldn't sleep?

AMY

I remember when you took that. We

had fun on that trip, didn't we?

AMY

You want to talk about it?

JEFF

There's nothing to talk about.

AMY

C'mon, Jeff.

(CONTINUED)

7.

JEFF

I told you. I quit.   Walked out.

end of story.

AMY

That's   it?

AMY

Whatever happened back there

wasn't your responsibility. You

can't keep beating yourself up

over it.

AMY

What do you think? You could have

stopped that girl from getting

killed?

JEFF

You don't understand...

JEFF

It was different this time.

CUT TO:

JEFF

I talked to Reynolds.

(a beat)

He thinks I could still get the

job at the San Diego station.

AMY

Oh, Jeff, you didn't...

(CONTINUED)

8.

JEFF

Think of it. Low pressure, a

steady paycheck. So I shoot city

council meetings -- how bad could

it be?

AMY

Is that what you really want -- or

are you just running away?

JEFF

Who's running? It's good money,

full benefits. I'm tired of

freelance. We could finally put

some money in the bank.

AMY

You know I'll never stand in your

way. But you've worked so hard.

Are you sure you want to throw it

away?

JEFF

Throw what away? Don't you get

it? I don't do anything. I sit,

I watch, I film -- I let it

happen.

AMY

You're supposed to let it happen.

It's your job.

JEFF

No, Amy.   It's my excuse.

JEFF

That girl... it's like I was

paralyzed. I wanted to do

something, but I didn't. I just

stood there and watched her get

killed.

JEFF

Please, babe, I need this.     Say

yes and we'll take as long    as you

want -- drive cross-country    and

make a vacation out of it.     What

do you say?

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

10.

AMY

Jesus, Jeff...

JEFF

Sorry.     I took my eyes off the

road.

AMY

(seeing thermos

on floor)

Maybe it's time we took a break,

you know?

11.

JEFF

I'll pull over next chance we get.

(a beat)

Sorry...

CUT TO:

TRUCKER

On vacation?

AMY

Sort of.    We're moving, actually.

TRUCKER

Whereabouts?

AMY

California. We thought we'd take

the scenic route.

(CONTINUED)

12.

TRUCKER

Huh. In that case, you oughta try

the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles

west. Real pretty, makes a loop

through the hills, then hooks back

up with the highway.

AMY

Thanks. I'll mention it to my

husband.

TRUCKER

Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the

rest of your trip.

EARL

(flatly)

Nice car.

JEFF

Thanks.

(CONTINUED)

13.

EARL

Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you

sprung for the whole nine yards.

JEFF

I guess.

EARL

Then again, out here, what you

really need's a C.B. radio.

JEFF

Is that right?

EARL

'Course, if you use a C.B., you

gotta have a handle.

EARL

How about Shit-for-Brains?

(beat)

You damn near killed us back

there, boy.

JEFF

Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.

You pulled out in front of me.

EARL

The hell I did. I saw what

happened.

JEFF

How about if we just forget it,

okay? I'm sorry it happened. I

don't want any trouble.

EARL

(snorting)

Yeah.     I bet you don't.

(CONTINUED)

14.

EARL

Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow

tryin' to steal your Cherokee.

AMY

What was that about?

JEFF

Nothing. Guy in the truck.

Thinks I tried to hit him.

JEFF

C'mon, let's go.

AMY

You want me to drive?

JEFF

Later.   Just get in.

AMY

Is something wrong?

JEFF

No, let's just go.

(CONTINUED)

15.

AMY

This isn't the Grand Prix, you

know.

AMY

What's bothering you?

JEFF

I told you. Nothing.

(pause)

The guy was an asshole.

JEFF

What'd you get?

AMY

Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo

Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe

they still make this stuff?

JEFF

You kidding. It's probably

gourmet cuisine around here.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

16.

AMY

(trying to brighten

the mood)

This is crazy. Look at this.

Says if you win this mail-in

contest, you can choose either

ninety thousand dollars or ninety

thousand doughnuts.

AMY

What would you do with ninety

thousand doughnuts?

JEFF

I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty

cents each and pay off this car.

AMY

Very funny.

(beat)

Alright, what about ninety

thousand dollars? What would you

do with that?

JEFF

I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm

not --

JEFF

Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He

stole my camera!

AMY

(startled)

Who?

JEFF

The redneck at the gas station!

He lifted it right under my nose!

My brand new Nikon.

(pounds wheel

in frustration)

Goddammit.

AMY

Should we go back?

(CONTINUED)

17.

JEFF

What's the use. He's probably

halfway to Bumblefuck now, the

bastard.

AMY

Look, maybe if we call the cops --

JEFF

What the hell?

AMY

What'd you do?

JEFF

Nothing.   I --

JEFF

Hang on -- I can't steer!

AMY

(deadpan)

Found your camera.

JEFF

Ow!

(CONTINUED)

18.

AMY

Are you okay?

JEFF

I'm fine.

JEFF

(annoyed)

I said I'm fine, okay?

AMY

Out of range?

AMY

What's going on, Jeff?

JEFF

What's it look like?      I'm trying

to fix the car.

AMY

Not the car.

JEFF

What?

AMY

What's going on with you?

AMY

It's been a month since you got

back. You can't keep shutting me

out like this.

AMY

Jeff, I'm talking to you.

(CONTINUED)

19.

JEFF

(flaring)

Look, I really don't want to go

into this right now. I'm changing

jobs, our finances are fucked, and

we're stuck in the middle of

nowhere. So could we maybe just

fix the --

JEFF

Christ, not these guys...

JEFF

Asshole...

AMY

(looking down

the road)

Jeff --

JEFF

What the hell?

AMY

What's he doing?

JEFF

I don't know.

20.

RED (TRUCKER)

You folks all right?

JEFF

Yeah.   Our car broke down.

RED

(chuckling)

I figured that much. You want a

hand pushing it off the road?

JEFF

Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy,

you want to steer?

JEFF

Think you could radio a tow truck

for us?

RED

I sure would if I could, mister,

but my C.B. blew a fuse this

morning. I'm waiting till I hit

the truck stop on I-40 to get it

fixed.

(CONTINUED)

21.

JEFF

How far is that?

RED

About 60 miles.

JEFF

(disappointed)

Oh.

RED

I'd offer to take a look, but it's

hard to say with these new

engines. Used to be, you could

give 'em a kick and a holler and

they'd start right up. Now it's

all computers and chips.

JEFF

It's a new car.

RED

That could be the problem. You

been running it pretty fast?

RED

Tell you what. If you want a

ride, there's a little diner up

the road. Belle's. They got a

pay phone. You could call a tow

truck from there.

JEFF

Nice     of you to offer. But we've

got a     lot of stuff in the car. I

think     we're better off waiting for

a cop     to come along.

(CONTINUED)

22.

RED

(casually)

Suit    yourself. Not many cops on

this    road, that's why the truckers

use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky.

(tipping his cap)

Good    luck.

AMY

Are you nuts?

JEFF

We don't know this guy.

AMY

He's offering to help. It       could

be hours before anyone else      comes

along. It's 100 degrees.        You

really want to be stuck out      here?

JEFF

Amy, I've got my equipment in the

car. All our stuff. What if

those guys come back and we're not

here?

(turns away,

quietly to

himself)

Jesus... don't be stupid...

AMY

Stupid is sitting out here waiting

for a cop when we already have a

ride.

AMY

Stupid was letting you talk me

into leaving Boston.

AMY

Excuse me? Do you think you could

drop me at that diner?

(CONTINUED)

23.

RED

(surprised)

Sure thing. How about you,

mister? I could take you both

just as easy.

AMY

That's okay. My husband wants to

stay with the car. I'll just get

my purse.

JEFF

What do you think you're doing?

AMY

I'm going to the diner. I'm going

to call a tow truck. Then I'm

going to order an iced tea and

wait. Good-bye, Jeff.

JEFF

(firm)

You're not riding with that guy.

End of story.

AMY

You wanted to be alone. Well...

you're alone. Why don't you take

the time to get your head

together?

RED

Watch your step, ma'am.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

Oh for Christ's sake...

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

25.

JEFF

Excuse me.

JEFF

I was supposed to meet my wife

here.

JEFF

Dark hair, slender, about five-

five. Wearing a pale blue

Benetton shirt.

BARTENDER

A pale blue what?

JEFF

Benetton shirt.

BARTENDER

Hank!  Your order's ready.

(to Jeff)

I been busy. They come and go.

JEFF

It would've been within the last

half hour. She might've been with

a trucker?

BARTENDER

A trucker.

(CONTINUED)

26.

JEFF

Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving

an eighteen wheeler.

BARTENDER

Don't ring a bell.

JEFF

You sure?

BARTENDER

Hey! Man here's looking for his

wife, dark hair, button-on shirt,

travelin' with a guy in a baseball

cap. Anybody see 'em?

FLO

Looks like she got away from ya,

cowboy.

JEFF

Could she have left a message with

another one of your employees?

BARTENDER

Don't see how. I'm the only one

who works here.

JEFF

I don't understand. Is there

another Belle's Diner?

BARTENDER

(chuckles)

No siree. Definitely not.

(CONTINUED)

27.

JEFF

(under his breath)

Shit.

JEFF

Excuse me, how far is the next

town?

BARTENDER

About twenty miles.

JEFF

Look, if my wife comes in -- her

name is Amy -- tell her I was

here. Tell her to stay put till I

get back, not to move. Would you

do that, please?

BARTENDER

(shrugs, bored)

Okay.

28.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

29.

JEFF

C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over.

JEFF

Pull over!    Pull over!

(CONTINUED)

30.

RED

Jesus, pal, what the hell you

doing?

JEFF

I was signaling you to stop.

Didn't you see me?

RED

No.

JEFF

Where's my wife?

RED

Huh?

JEFF

My wife.     Where is she?

RED

How should I know where your wife

is?

JEFF

I checked at the diner.      No one

saw her there.

RED

Mister, I don't know what you're

talking about.

JEFF

You gave her a ride. You were

supposed to drop her at Belle's

diner.

(CONTINUED)

31.

RED

Nope.   Sorry.

JEFF

How can you not remember? It was

just half an hour ago, for

chrissakes!

RED

Mister, I never seen you before in

my life.

CB VOICE (V.O.)

(filtered)

Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you

copy?

JEFF

(reacts)

Your radio works --

(locks eyes with Red)

What the hell are you doing -- ?

JEFF

Amy?    Amy?!   You in there?

RED

Look, mister, I don't know what

you want, but --

JEFF

I want my fucking wife, is what I

want! What have you done to her?!

(CONTINUED)

32.

JEFF

Officer, I need your help!

SHERIFF BOYD

What's your problem?

JEFF

I don't know, this guy has my

wife!

SHERIFF BOYD

Calm down, sir. Tell me what's

going on.

JEFF

I don't know what the hell's going

on. Last time I saw her she was

with this guy in his truck. Now

he's saying he's never seen her!

RED

Officer, he's crazy -- I don't

know what he's talking about.

JEFF

Don't lie, you son of a bitch!

SHERIFF BOYD

All right -- everybody just calm

down.

(to Jeff)

Sir, you want to tell me what

happened?

JEFF

Our car broke down. This guy

stopped to help us, said he'd

drive my wife to a pay phone.    But

she never showed up.

SHERIFF BOYD

(turning to Red)

Sir?

(CONTINUED)

33.

RED

I don't know, officer. I'm

driving along, suddenly this fella

runs me off the road and starts

hollering about his wife. I

swear, I never seen the guy

before.

SHERIFF BOYD

And you didn't give his wife a

ride?

RED

No, sir.

JEFF

He's lying!

SHERIFF BOYD

Sir, all right with you if I

search your truck?

RED

Hell yes, officer. Go right

ahead. Name's Red, by the way.

Red Barr.

(pulls out his

wallet)

My permits are all current. You

can check 'em out.

SHERIFF BOYD

That won't be necessary yet. Just

stand back behind the line. Both

of you.

(CONTINUED)

34.

SHERIFF BOYD

(to both of them)

All right, let's see your license

and registration.

SHERIFF BOYD

What are you hauling today, Mr.

Barr?

RED

Nothing, empty load. I'm heading

to Fresno for a pick up -- ball

bearings or something.

SHERIFF BOYD

(eyeing him)

Long way to go empty.

RED

Tell me about it. Too much

competition nowadays. One horse

guys like me gotta drive halfway

'cross the country just to get a

payin' job.

JEFF

(to Sheriff,

impatient)

Are we gonna keep looking or what?

SHERIFF BOYD

Yes, we are.

(to Red)

Sir, I'm gonna have to see

everything.

RED

No problem.   I understand.

35.

SHERIFF BOYD

(re: boxes)

Those yours?

RED

Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes

and whatnot. You want to take a

look?

SHERIFF BOYD

No. I think we're pretty much

done here. You're free to go.

JEFF

(reacts)

Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's

it? You're not going to question

him anymore?

SHERIFF BOYD

Sir, I searched the truck.

There's no evidence of suspicious

activity, no sign of struggle.

RED

Look, I don't mean to butt in, but

maybe you got my truck confused

with someone else's.

JEFF

(lunges)

Go to hell, you sonofabitch --

(CONTINUED)

36.

SHERIFF BOYD

Hey! Hey! You want to get

arrested? Now the man has a

point. This is a plain-looking,

John Doe truck. Maybe you did get

them mixed up.

SHERIFF BOYD

Hey!

SHERIFF BOYD

Mr. Taylor, either you come down

from there or I'm going to have to

arrest you.

JEFF

It was him.    It was this truck.

SHERIFF BOYD

Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you

get a license plate?

JEFF

No.

SHERIFF BOYD

What about the information on the

door panel. You recall any of

that?

(CONTINUED)

37.

JEFF

I wasn't paying attention.

SHERIFF BOYD

Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance

have a beef with your wife today?

JEFF

What does that have to do with

anything?

SHERIFF BOYD

Well, for starters, maybe she left

you.

JEFF

I don't believe this...

SHERIFF BOYD

I've seen it a hundred times.

Lovers, married couples, gay guys.

You put two people in a car long

enough, they'll go at it. Hell,

I've even seen men dump their

women on the side of the road, and

vice versa.

JEFF

My wife did not leave me.

RED

(cuts in)

Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to

stay and help, but I really got to

make it to Fresno...

SHERIFF BOYD

I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I

appreciate your cooperation.

JEFF

This is insane. You're just going

to let him go?

SHERIFF BOYD

I've got his information. If we

need to find him later, we'll know

where to look.

(CONTINUED)

38.

RED

Much obliged.

(to Jeff)

Good luck findin' your wife,

mister. No hard feelings.

SHERIFF BOYD

Sir, I believe you that your wife

is missing. Maybe you got

confused about what truck she got

into, maybe you had a fight -- you

don't have to tell me. The point

is I'm trying to help.

SHERIFF BOYD

The town of Brackett's 31 miles

that way. My deputy's name is Len

Carver. He's a good man. He'll

help you fill out the necessary

forms if you want to report your

wife missing.

SHERIFF BOYD

If you want my opinion, your wife

is probably around here. Lost or

plenty pissed off and giving you a

scare. Either way, she'll turn

up.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

(filtered)

Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs.

Gilbert's locked out of her

trailer again. Can you respond?

SHERIFF BOYD

(into mike)

10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on

my way.

(CONTINUED)

39.

JEFF

I want your name and badge number.

SHERIFF BOYD

Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93.

This really isn't necessary --

JEFF

Don't tell me what's necessary,

goddamnit. I'm noting the exact

time of this conversation. 10:52

A.M.

SHERIFF BOYD

(exhaling)

Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.

CUT TO:

DEPUTY CARVER

Is this a recent picture?

JEFF

Two months old.

DEPUTY CARVER

She still wear her hair like that?

JEFF

Yes.

(CONTINUED)

40.

DEPUTY CARVER

We'll certainly do our best, Mr.

Taylor. There's over a hundred

thousand people go missing in this

country every year. Runaways,

deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks

hiding from the I.R.S. -- all

vanishing without a trace.

DEPUTY CARVER

Now I'm not saying she's one of

them. I sure hope not. But

unless there's a ransom demand or

evidence of forced abduction,

believe me, the F.B.I. won't even

look at your case till it's been

24 hours.

DEPUTY CARVER

Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our

eyes peeled. How's that sound?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

41.

JEFF

Did she come in?

BARTENDER

(looks up, uninterested)

Didn't see her.

JEFF

You didn't see her, or she didn't

come in?

BARTENDER

Buddy, I told you the last time.

I'm busy. Maybe she came in,

maybe she didn't. All I know is,

I didn't see her.

BARFLY

(confidentially)

None of my business, mister. But

if I was you I'd take a look in

the ladies room.

JEFF

Amy?

42.

FLO

Hey -- what the hell you doing?!

JEFF

I want to see your order slips.

BARTENDER

What?

JEFF

You write down the names.   I want

to see them.

BARTENDER

What are you, nuts? I don't have

to show you jack shit.

(CONTINUED)

43.

JEFF

If my wife came in here, then her

name's in that pile.

BARTENDER

You calling me a liar?

BARTENDER

Mister, I've had just about enough

of you.

JEFF

Let me see the fucking slips.

BARTENDER

Now, mister, you're going to have

to leave.

JEFF

Please, I need the phone -- I have

to call the police!

(CONTINUED)

SLUGGISH MAN

(drawls)

My name's Billy. You the feller

lookin' for his wife?

JEFF

How'd you know? Did you see her?

JEFF

Please, if you know something,

anything, tell me.

BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN)

(a beat)

I seen her... maybe.

JEFF

What?    When?

BILLY

Oh man. Never shoulda opened my

damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.

JEFF

No one's going to hurt you, Billy.

Just tell me what you saw.

BILLY

She came in on a truck.   A big

white one.

JEFF

Yes...

BILLY

Then she... she got in another

truck.

(CONTINUED)

45.

JEFF

Another truck? With who?

BILLY

Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They

say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I

see things.

JEFF

Do you know where they went?

BILLY

Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the

river.

JEFF

Where by the river?

BILLY

Dunno. They don't tell me that

kind of stuff.

JEFF

Who doesn't? The bartender?      The

men in the truck?

BILLY

I ain't talking to you no more.

JEFF

Billy, I need you to come to the

police. If you tell them what you

saw, they'll be able to help me.

BILLY

Man, you're the dummy.

BILLY

Don't you git it? The police is

the ones in on it!

CUT TO:

JEFF

C'mon... work, goddammit...

JEFF

Fuck.

47.

JEFF

(thank God)

Yes.

JEFF

Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor...

Listen, I -- don't put me on hold!

I need a favor... I've gotta talk

to that friend of yours at the

F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's

missing --

JEFF

I said Amy's been --

JEFF

Fuck!

JEFF

Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't

call back -- Steve?!       Steve?!

JEFF

Goddammit!

(CONTINUED)

48.

JEFF

Shit!

EARL

(calling out)

Out of the car! Put your hands

where I can see 'em!

EARL

I said get out, dammit!   Now!

50.

EARL

Sonofabitch...

51.

EARL

Fuck!

EARL

Goddammit...

EARL

He's getting away!

DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.)

Where is he?

(CONTINUED)

EARL

He's in the water!   I just saw

him!

DISSOLVE TO:

AL

... can't believe you let him get

away...

EARL

You try chasing... through this

shit...

AL

Fuck... this is what happens when

you get one without the other...

CUT TO:

CUT TO BLACK.

55.

EARL

He coming around?

BILLY

Should be... I clocked him pretty

good...

BILLY

Rise and shine, dad.

BILLY

C'mon, shake a leg.

JEFF

(weak)

Where is she?

BILLY

Give us some answers and you might

find out. According to her,

you've got a pretty good pile of

ready cash sitting in the bank.

Is that true?

JEFF

There's some... yeah...

BILLY

Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut

it. Your wife gave us a dollar

figure. I want the same exact

from you.

(CONTINUED)

56.

JEFF

(coming around;

stalling)

I don't -- there's different

accounts... the balance

fluctuates...

BILLY

Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot

like you ain't tracking his bottom

line, it'd be the first time in

history.

(turning)

What do you think, Earl?

EARL

We been fucked with, is what I

think. Little slut lied to us.

Put 'em on the spot, they'll say

anything to stay alive.

BILLY

Yeah, I suppose. Too bad.

(peers down at Jeff)

Guess you're not the donut magnate

after all.

(to Earl)

Waste of time. Plug him.

JEFF

(blurting out)

Ninety thousand.

BILLY

Say again.

JEFF

(emphatic)

Ninety thousand dollars.

(CONTINUED)

57.

CUT TO:

EARL

Get out.   Don't try anything

stupid.

RED

You're a tough man to get a hold

of, Jeffrey.

JEFF

(barely able to

control himself)

What do you want?

RED

It's not me we're talking about.

Question is what you want.

RED

See, I've got something you might

want to buy. Can't show you the

merchandise right now, but I can

describe it for you. About five-

five, hundred and fifteen pounds.

I'd say three, maybe four of that

is tits. Black curly hair

upstairs and down. Interested?

(CONTINUED)

58.

JEFF

You sonofabitch --

RED

Bring him up here.

RED

Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If

ever there was a two-bit shithole

in the middle of nowhere, this is

it. One gas station, a half-dozen

stores and a V.F.W. hall.

(pointing)

See that building?

RED

That's the bank. Brackett

Commerce Bank. You with me?

RED

Then here's the drill. You're

gonna walk in there and tell the

manager you want an express wire

in the amount of $90,000 from your

account in Boston. Got your

wallet?

RED

You ask for the money in cash.

Small bills.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

59.

RED (CONT'D)

Today's payday at the copper mine,

so don't take any horsecock about

how they haven't got it. If the

manager gives you a hard time,

that's your problem. It's your

wife who's counting on you.

JEFF

How do I know she's still alive?

BILLY

Shut up.

RED

She's tucked away someplace safe.

You get her back as soon as we get

the money. Simple as that.

RED

Now a smart guy like you, you're

already thinking about calling the

cops, right?

RED

(into mike)

Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open

the gate.

AL (V.O.)

(filtered)

Copy that, Iron Man.

RED

Like I said, Jeff, if you want to

call the cops, there's nothing I

can do. Hell, with the fire

you've got in your eyes right now,

I figure you're fixing on calling

the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the

82nd Airborne.

(CONTINUED)

60.

RED

Problem is, you can see this town

for miles around. So ask

yourself: How's the law gonna get

here? They gonna fly in? Drive

in? Either way, we'll see 'em.

So let me be very clear: if we see

one unmarked car, one plane, one

human being who even smells like a

cop -- this deal is dead.

RED

Now take a look at the building

with the flagpole.

RED (O.S.)

There's exactly two cops in this

town. One of them's inside

pulling ass duty; the other's on

patrol in the foothills. Now a

minute ago one of my men called in

a non-injury accident on the I-40

connector.

RED (O.S.)

It'll take that good ol' boy 20

minutes to get to the connector,

another 10 to see there's no

accident, and another 20 or so to

tool his way back. 50 minutes all

in.

61.

RED

That's your deadline. If for any

reason one of those cops pulls

into town before I'm looking at a

bag of money, your wife is dead,

you're shit out of luck and we're

gone for good.

RED

See, that's why there's no risk to

us in this thing. You do the

legwork. We sit back, we watch,

we listen to our scanners, we

monitor you every step of the way.

If at any moment we don't like

something, we split. Period.

(beat)

Helluva lot safer than sticking up

7-11s, wouldn't you say?

RED

Put this on. You can't go into

the bank like that.

RED

How about it, Jeff? Time to get

the show on the road?

CUT TO:

62.

JEFF

I need to see the manager. I need

a wire transfer from my bank in

Boston.

CALHOUN

Yes... sir. I'm the manager.

Would you like to have a seat?

CALHOUN

Sir?

JEFF

(turning; preoccupied)

What?

CALHOUN

I said you can have a seat if you

want.

JEFF

Right.

(CONTINUED)

63.

JEFF

Here's my driver's license, credit

card if you need it, my account

number in Boston... How long is

this going to take?

CALHOUN

Are you all right?

JEFF

(quickly)

Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account

only has $5,000 in it. How much

can you advance me on my credit

card?

CALHOUN

Excuse me?

JEFF

(impatient)

My credit card. I've got a $6,000

limit. Can you advance me the

whole $6,000?

CALHOUN

No, I can't. For non-customers

the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are

you sure you're all right?

JEFF

Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer

the money, okay?

JEFF

Look, I'm going to tell you

something. Whatever happens, just

keep filling out that form, okay?

CALHOUN

(looking up;

baffled)

Sir?

JEFF

There are people watching --

(CONTINUED)

64.

COWBOY (O.S.)

Excuse me, you the manager?

CALHOUN

Yes, I am.

COWBOY

Lady over there said to see you

about a car loan.

CALHOUN

(indicating

waiting area)

Certainly, sir. Would you like to

have a seat?

CALHOUN

(turning back

to Jeff)

You were saying, Mr. Taylor?

JEFF

Just... transfer the money.

CUT TO:

65.

JEFF

Would you tell the manager I want

the money in these denominations?

CUT TO:

JEFF

I'm here.

RED (V.O.)

(filtered)

No shit. I can SEE that.   How

much you got?

JEFF

The whole thing. Ninety thousand.

(CONTINUED)

66.

RED (V.O.)

(filtered)

Good. Turn left and start walking

toward the main road. Get in the

first car that stops.

JEFF

When do I see my wife?

RED (V.O.)

(filtered)

When I say so. Now walk.

CUT TO:

CALHOUN

Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down

at the bank. Is the Sheriff

there?

(a beat)

Well, maybe it's nothing, but you

might tell him we just had a

fellow in here acting kind of

strange...

CUT TO:

EARL

Toss the envelope on the seat.

(CONTINUED)

67.

JEFF

No.   First you tell me where she

is.

EARL

Wrong, asshole. First you give me

the money, then you find out.

Unless you want me to shoot you

dead right here on the highway.

EARL

Now lift your shirt and jacket and

turn around.

EARL

Turn around, hands behind your

back, and step toward the truck.

EARL

Now get up in the truck, knees on

the floor. Do it now!

JEFF

I gave you the money.     Now let her

go.

(CONTINUED)

68.

EARL

'Let her go.'    Do I look like I

have her?

JEFF

What the hell --

EARL

(on phone)

It's done. I'm heading in.

(a beat;

listening)

Gotcha.

EARL

You gotta be the dumbest

motherfuck yet. You think we

picked you out of the blue? New

car, Massachusetts plates --

probably be days before anyone

misses you. Hell, you shoulda got

the bumper sticker that goes with

it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for

Trouble!'

EARL

I'd have loved to see the look on

your face when that car seized up.

(mimicking panicked

driver)

Help, help, I ain't got no power!

(CONTINUED)

69.

EARL

You know what I'm gonna do first

with your money, boy? Well, do

you?

EARL

(fluttering bills

under his nose)

I'll give you a hint. Only one

thing smells better than money.

You wanta guess what?

EARL

What the hell?

EARL

These are... it's nothing but

singles...

Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you

sonofabitch! You want to try 'em

again?

How about an emergency stop? You

want to try that, Earl? Where is

she?

EARL

I don't know!

Fuck you, you don't!

Is that what you want? You really

want me to stop? 'Cause I bet

this baby stops on a dime!

End of the line, Earl! How about

EARL

She's with Billy.

Yeah?     Where's that?

EARL

I don't know!    Driving around!

Main highway... Texaco...

I know where she is!   My wife!

SHERIFF BOYD

(ignoring him)

Drop the gun!

JEFF

You don't understand!      She's been

kidnapped!

SHERIFF BOYD

I understand plenty. Now get down

on the ground or I'll shoot!

75.

SHERIFF BOYD

You there -- in the pickup! You

all right? Can you get out?

EARL

Yeah! Just don't shoot me,

officer! He's crazy, I tell you!

SHERIFF BOYD

Well, get out dammit!

Hello? Can you hear me? This is

ARLEEN

Why can't Al and Billy come some

I told you, we've got some stuff

Deke, c'mon over here, I got

Guess which hand.

DEKE

This one.

Nope.    Try again.

Nope.

There's reports of an accident up

Five Mile, but that's about it.

BILLY

I told you we shoulda gotten rid

of 'em like that couple up in

Utah. Nice and clean.

So it got a little fucked up -- so

what? We stay out of the area for

a while, things will cool off.

RED

Dammit, Al, what the hell you

doing?

AL

Figured I'd get started on the

jewelry.

RED

Fuck that, you can work on it

later. Help us with the girl.

RED

Must've died from the exhaust.

I'll get some plastic. We'll bury

her before it gets light out.

Aagh!

Goddamn.   Scared me half to death.

Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be

Shit, it's my wife. Help me get

Just a second, Arleen.

Don't   worry, honey. It's not as

So what happens but   this big old

rooster, damn thing   must've

weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out

toward that highway   patrolman...

Ever wonder where all this stuff

DEKE (O.S.)

Stick 'em up.

You don't want to do that, kid.

I understand that, Deke. I'm not

gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull

that trigger, there's a chance

I'll still kill your father.

Out of surgery. It looks like

he's being turned over to

Protective Services.

FBI AGENT

We've got I.D. on the dead

suspects. Turns out they were all

licensed truckers. One of 'em had

a rap for check kiting. Otherwise

they could've been model citizens.

JEFF

What about the leader?

FBI AGENT

Same thing. His real name's

Warren Claney. Three speeding

tickets in five years -- apart

from that, he's clean as a

whistle.

AMY

How could they do it? How could

they treat it like a... business?

I don't know. I've been doing

this 15 years, I've never seen

anything like it.

FBI AGENT (CONT'D)

It was simple, efficient and

crime.

You were just a couple of the

lucky ones.
