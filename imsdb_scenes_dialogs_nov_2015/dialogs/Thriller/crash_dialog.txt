"CRASH"

Screenplay by

David Cronenberg

Based on a novel by

J.G. Ballard

SHOOTING DRAFT

AD

I'm looking for James. Has anybody

seen James Ballard? You know who I

mean? The producer of this epic.

GRIP

I think I saw him in the camera

department.

AD

(off screen)

James? James, are you in there? Could

we please get your stamp of approval

on our little tracking shot?

JAMES

Of course. Be there in a minute.

CAMERA GIRL

It'll take more than a minute.

JAMES

Where were you?

CATHERINE

In the private aircraft hangar.

Anybody could have walked in.

JAMES

Did you come?

CATHERINE

No. What about your camera girl? Did

she come?

JAMES

We were interrupted. I had to go

back to the set...

CATHERINE

Poor darling.

(pause)

What can I do about Karen? How can I

arrange to have her seduce me? She

desperately needs a conquest.

JAMES

I've been thinking about that, about

you and Karen.

CATHERINE

There, that's better.

JAMES

Thank you.

CATHERINE

Not a lot of action here.

JAMES

They consider this to be the airport

hospital. This ward is reserved for

air-crash victims. The beds are kept

waiting.

CATHERINE

If I groundloop during my flying

lesson on Saturday you might wake up

and find me next to you.

JAMES

I'll listen for you buzzing over.

JAMES

(referring to the

lighter)

Is that a gift from Wendel? It has

an aeronautical feel to it.

CATHERINE

Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate the

licence approval for our air-charter

firm. I forgot to tell you.

JAMES

That's going well, then.

CATHERINE

Well, yes.

(pause)

You're getting out of bed tomorrow.

They want you to walk.

CATHERINE

The other man, the dead man, his

wife is a doctor -- Dr Helen

Remington. She's here, somewhere. As

a patient, of course. Maybe you'll

find her in the hallways tomorrow on

your walk.

JAMES

And her husband? What was he?

CATHERINE

He was a chemical engineer with a

food company.

STUDENT NURSE

No smoking, please.

STUDENT NURSE

(to Catherine)

Are you this gentleman's wife? Mrs

Ballard?

CATHERINE

Yes.

STUDENT NURSE

You can stay for this, then.

CATHERINE

Aida telephoned to say how sorry she

was, but could you look at the

storyboards again, she's made a number

of changes.

JAMES

Where's the car?

CATHERINE

Outside in the visitors' car-park.

JAMES

What!? They brought the car here?

CATHERINE

My car, not yours. Yours is a complete

wreck. The police dragged it to the

pound behind the station.

JAMES

Have you seen it?

CATHERINE

The sergeant asked me to identify

it. He didn't believe you'd gotten

out alive.

JAMES

It's about time.

CATHERINE

It is?

JAMES

After being bombarded endlessly by

road-safety propaganda, it's almost

a relief to have found myself in an

actual accident.

VAUGHAN

James Ballard?

JAMES

Yes?

VAUGHAN

Crash victim?

JAMES

Yes.

VAUGHAN

We'll deal with these later.

JAMES

Dr. Remington...?

CATHERINE

Both front wheels and the engine

were driven back into the driver's

section, bowing the floor. Blood

still marked the hood, streamers of

black lace running toward the

windshield-wiper gutters.

CATHERINE

Minute flecks were spattered across

the seat and steering wheel. The

instrument panel was buckled inwards,

cracking the clock and the speedometer

dials. The cabin was deformed, and

there was dust and glass and plastic

flakes everywhere inside. The

carpeting was damp and stank of blood

and other body and machine fluids.

JAMES

You should have gone to the funeral.

CATHERINE

I wish I had. They bury the dead so

quickly -- they should leave them

lying around for months.

JAMES

What about his wife? The woman doctor?

Have you visited her yet?

CATHERINE

No, I couldn't. I feel too close to

her.

CATHERINE

Renata tells me you're going to rent

a car.

JAMES

I can't sit on this balcony forever.

I'm beginning to feel like a potted

plant.

CATHERINE

How can you drive? James... your

legs. You can barely walk.

JAMES

Is the traffic heavier now? There

seem to be three times as many cars

as there were before the accident.

CATHERINE

I've never really noticed. Is Renata

going with you?

JAMES

I thought she might come along.

Handling a car again might be more

tiring than I imagine.

CATHERINE

I'm amazed that she'll let you drive

her.

JAMES

You're not envious?

CATHERINE

Maybe I am a little.

(rising)

James, I've got to leave for the

office. Are you going to be all right?

RENATA

Are we allowed to park here?

JAMES

No.

RENATA

I'm sure the police would make an

exception in your case.

JAMES

There's still a patch of blood there

on the road. Did you see it?

RENATA

I saw the blood. It looks like motor

oil.

JAMES

You were the last one I saw just

before the accident. Do you remember?

We made love.

RENATA

Are you still involving me in your

crash?

RENATA

Who is that man? Is he a private

detective?

RENATA

Can you drive?

JAMES

I can drive.

CATHERINE

I can't believe you've done this.

KAREN

This is the exact same car as your

old one, isn't it?

CATHERINE

Yes, it is.

(to James)

Are you planning to have another car

crash?

JAMES

I'm not thinking about the crash at

all.

HELEN

After this sort of thing, how do

people manage to look at a car, let

alone drive one?

(pause)

I'm trying to find Charles's car.

JAMES

It's not here. Maybe the police are

still holding it. Their forensic

people...

HELEN

They said it was here. They told me

this morning.

HELEN

This is your car?

JAMES

You'll tear your gloves.

JAMES

I don't think we should have come

here. I'm surprised the police don't

make it more difficult.

HELEN

Were you badly hurt? I think we saw

each other at the hospital.

(pause)

I don't want the car. In fact, I was

appalled to find that I have to pay

a small fee to have it scrapped.

JAMES

Can I give you a lift?

(almost apologetically)

I somehow find myself driving again.

JAMES

You haven't told me where we're going.

HELEN

Haven't I? To the airport, if you

could.

JAMES

The airport? Why? Are you leaving?

HELEN

Not yet -- though not soon enough

for some people, I've already found.

A death in the doctor's family makes

the patients doubly uneasy.

JAMES

I take it you're not wearing white

to reassure them.

HELEN

I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want

to.

JAMES

So -- why the airport?

HELEN

I work in the immigration department

there.

HELEN

Do you want a cigarette? I started

to smoke at the hospital. It's rather

stupid of me.

JAMES

(suddenly very agitated)

Look at all this traffic. I'm not

sure I can deal with it.

HELEN

It's much worse now. You noticed

that, did you? The day I left the

hospital I had the extraordinary

feeling that all these cars were

gathering for some special reason I

didn't understand. There seemed to

be ten times as much traffic.

JAMES

Are we imagining it?

HELEN

You've bought yourself exactly the

same car again. It's the same shape

and colour.

HELEN

Turn up here into the car-park. It

won't be busy this time of day.

HELEN

I've found that I enjoy burying myself

in heavy traffic. I like to look at

it. Yesterday I hired a taxi-driver

to drive me around for an hour.

'Anywhere,' I said. We sat in a

massive traffic jam under an off-

ramp. I don't think we moved more

than fifty yards.

(pause)

I'm thinking of taking up a new job

with the Road Research Laboratory.

They need a medical officer. The

salary is larger -- something I've

got to think about now. There's a

certain moral virtue in being

materialistic, I'm beginning to feel.

Well, it's a new approach for me, in

any case.

JAMES

The Road Research Laboratory? Where

they simulate car crashes?

HELEN

Yes.

JAMES

Isn't that rather too close...?

HELEN

That's the point. Besides, I know I

can give something now that I wasn't

remotely aware of before. It's not a

matter of duty so much as of

commitment.

RENATA

I almost forgot to give you this.

Probably because I know you're going

to like it.

JAMES

What is it?

RENATA

A complimentary ticket for a special

stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely

not part of the big auto show. There's

a map in the packet and a note

requesting you be discreet about the

location.

JAMES

Really? What kind of exhibition is

it?

RENATA

I suspect it involves re-enactments

of famous car crashes. You know,

Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert

Camus...

JAMES

You're kidding.

RENATA

Serious. But you'll have to take

your new friend, the female crash-

test dummy. She dropped it off for

you.

JAMES

You're not jealous, are you? You

have to understand... Helen and I

had this strange, intense...

experience together.

RENATA

We've had a few of those ourselves,

haven't we?

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

'Don't worry, that guy's gotta see

us!' These were the confident last

words of the brilliant young Hollywood

star James Dean as he piloted his

Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a

date with death on a lonely stretch

of California two-lane blacktop,

Route 466. 'Don't worry, that guy's

gotta see us.' The year, 1955; the

day, September thirtieth; the time:

now.

JAMES

It's strange -- I thought all this

would be far more popular.

HELEN

The real thing is available free of

charge. Besides, it's not quite legal.

They can't advertise.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

The first star of our show is 'Little

Bastard', James Dean's racing Porsche.

He named it after himself, and had

his racing number, 130, painted on

it.

JAMES

Who is that? The announcer. Do I

know him?

HELEN

That's Vaughan. He talked to you at

the hospital.

JAMES

Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical

photographer, doing some sort of

accident research. He wanted every

conceivable detail about our crash.

HELEN

When I first met Vaughan, he was a

specialist in international

computerized traffic systems. I don't

know what he is now.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

The second star is stuntman and former

race driver -- Colin Seagrave, who

will drive our replica of James Dean's

car.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

I myself shall play the role of James

Dean's racing mechanic, Rolf

Wutherich, sent over from the Porsche

factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany.

This mechanic was himself fated to

die in a car crash in Germany twenty-

six years later. And the third and

in some ways most important party,

the college student Donald Turnupseed,

played by movie stuntman Brett Trask.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

Turnupseed was on his way back to

his home in Fresno for the weekend.

James Dean was on his way to an

automobile race in Salinas, a dusty

town in northern California. The two

would only meet for one moment, but

it was a moment that would create a

Hollywood legend.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

You'll notice that we are not wearing

helmets or safety padding of any

kind, and our cars are not equipped

with roll cages or seat-belts. We

depend solely on the skill of our

drivers for our safety, so that we

can bring you the ultimate in

authenticity. All right, here we go.

The fatal crash of James Dean!

JAMES

Is that part of the act or are they

really hurt?

HELEN

I don't know. You can never be sure

with Vaughan. This is his show.

VAUGHAN

(over speakers)

Rolf Wutherich was thrown from the

Porsche and spent a year in the

hospital recovering from his injuries.

Donald Turnupseed was found wandering

around in a daze, basically unhurt.

James Dean died of a broken neck and

became immortal.

COLIN

Hold me. I'm dizzy. I can't stand

up.

HELEN

I know that man, Seagrave, the stunt

driver. I think he's genuinely hurt.

POLICE

(over loudspeaker)

This is an illegal and unauthorized

automotive demonstration which is in

contravention of the Highway Traffic

Act. You are all liable to fines and

possible arrest and confinement...

Disperse at once! Disperse at once!

HELEN

(to Vaughan)

What's the matter with Seagrave?

VAUGHAN

Hit his head, I think. His balance

is off.

JAMES

Why are the police taking this all

so seriously?

VAUGHAN

It's not the police. It's the

Department of Transport. Internal

politics. It's a joke. They have no

idea who we really are.

VAUGHAN

That was glib, wasn't it? 'James

Dean died of a broken neck and became

immortal.' But I couldn't resist.

VERA

Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie

down.

HELEN

They did the James Dean crash. It

seemed to go perfectly. But he started

to feel nauseous on the way back.

I'm sure it's concussion.

VERA

Ah, well... We're familiar enough

with that, then, aren't we?

VAUGHAN

I'd really like to work out the

details of the Jayne Mansfield crash

with you. We could do the decapitation --

her head embedded in the windshield --

and the little dead dog thing as

well. You know, the Chihuahuas in

the back seat. I've got it figured

out.

COLIN

You know I'll be ready, Vaughan. But

I'll want to wear really big tits --

out to here -- so the crowd can see

them get cut up and crushed on the

dashboard.

VAUGHAN

Don't leave yet, Ballard. I want you

to help me.

JAMES

Do you live here? With Seagrave?

VAUGHAN

(laughs)

I live in my car. This is my workshop.

VAUGHAN

And this is the new project, Ballard.

JAMES

What kind of help can I possibly be

to you? You seem to be everywhere at

once as it is.

GABRIELLE

Thought you might be missing these.

(to James)

So here you are at the nerve centre.

Vaughan makes everything look like a

crime, doesn't he?

JAMES

What exactly is your project, Vaughan?

A book of crashes? A medical study?

A sensational documentary? Global

traffic?

VAUGHAN

It's something we're all intimately

involved in: the reshaping of the

human body by modern technology.

JAMES

Vaughan, what the hell are you doing?

Are you trying to create your own

Famous Crash?

VAUGHAN

It excited her, Ballard. Your wife,

Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her.

CATHERINE

He must have fucked a lot of women

in that huge car of his. It's like a

bed on wheels. It must smell of

semen...

JAMES

It does.

CATHERINE

Do you find him attractive?

JAMES

He's very pale. Covered with scars.

CATHERINE

Would you like to fuck him, though?

In that car?

JAMES

No. But when he's in that car...

CATHERINE

Have you seen his penis?

JAMES

I think it's badly scarred too. From

a motorcycle accident.

CATHERINE

Is he circumcised? Can you imagine

what his anus is like? Describe it

to me. Would you like to sodomize

him? Would you like to put your penis

right into his anus, thrust it up

his anus? Tell me, describe it to

me. Tell me what you would do. How

would you kiss him in that car?

Describe how you'd reach over and

unzip his greasy jeans, then take

out his penis. Would you kiss it or

suck it right away? Which hand would

you hold it in? Have you ever sucked

a penis? Do you know what semen tastes

like? Have you ever tasted semen?

Some semen is saltier than others.

Vaughan's semen must be very salty...

HELEN

Have you come?

JAMES

Please finish your story.

HELEN

The junior pathologist at Ashford

Hospital. Then the husband of a

colleague of mine, then a trainee

radiologist, then the service manager

at my garage.

JAMES

And you had sex with all of these

men in cars? Only in cars?

HELEN

Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

JAMES

And did you fantasize that Vaughan

was photographing all these sex acts?

As though they were traffic accidents?

HELEN

Yes.

(laughs)

They felt like traffic accidents.

VAUGHAN

Get all the paper you can, Ballard.

Some of the stuff they're giving

away is terrific: 'Mechanisms of

Occupant Ejection', 'Tolerances of

the Human Face in Crash Impacts'...

HELEN

We can have a look at it again on

the monitors. They're showing it in

slow motion.

VAUGHAN

I've always wanted to drive a crashed

car.

JAMES

You could get your wish at any moment.

VAUGHAN

No, I mean a crash with a history.

Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel

West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's

Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to

get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't

touch anything else.

JAMES

Is that why you drive this car? I

take it that you see Kennedy's

assassination as a special kind of

car crash?

VAUGHAN

The case could be made.

VAUGHAN

Take a look at this and tell me what

you think.

JAMES

It's very... satisfying. I'm not

sure I understand why.

VAUGHAN

It's the future, Ballard, and you're

already part of it. For the first

time, a benevolent psychopathology

beckons towards us. For example, the

car crash is a fertilizing rather

than a destructive event -- a

liberation of sexual energy that

mediates the sexuality of those who

have died with an intensity impossible

in any other form. To fully understand

that, and to live that... that is my

project.

JAMES

What about the reshaping of the human

body by modern technology? I thought

that was your project.

VAUGHAN

A crude sci-fi concept that floats

on the surface and doesn't threaten

anybody. I use it to test the

resilience of my potential partners

in psychopathology.

VAUGHAN

You drive.

VAUGHAN

Let's get rid of that. I don't want

you blowing it up my urethra.

RENATA

Your friend's still out there.

RENATA

What does he want from you?

JAMES

Hard to say.

RENATA

I'm going to leave now. Do you want

a lift?

JAMES

No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.

CATHERINE

They're questioning Vaughan about an

accident near the airport. Some

pedestrian... they think he was run

over intentionally.

JAMES

Vaughan isn't interested in

pedestrians.

CATHERINE

You'd better drive him. He's a bit

shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where

is yours?

JAMES

At home. I couldn't face all this

traffic.

CATHERINE

I'd better come with you, then. Are

you sure you can drive?

VAUGHAN

It's Seagrave. He was worried that

we would never do Jayne Mansfield's

crash, now that the police were

cracking down. So he did it himself.

VAUGHAN

(shakes his head)

The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant,

perfect. I wonder where he got it?

VAUGHAN

Come with me, James. I have to

document it.

JAMES

We must have driven through a pool

of blood. If the police stop you

again, they may impound the car while

they have the blood analyzed.

VAUGHAN

You're right, Ballard. There's an

all-night car-wash in the airport

service area.

SALESMAN

Is there something here that interests

you?

GABRIELLE

The white sports model. Could you

help me into it, please? I'd like to

see if I can fit into a car designed

for a normal body.

GABRIELLE

Don't. Not there.

GABRIELLE

Do it there. And then after that, do

it here.

AD

Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want

it?

JAMES

Hello? Ballard.

VAUGHAN

I need to see you, Ballard. I need

to talk to you about the project.

JAMES

(phone)

Where are you?

VAUGHAN

(to tattooist)

You're making it too clean.

TATTOOIST

Medical tattoos are supposed to be

clean.

VAUGHAN

This isn't a medical tattoo. This is

a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty

and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged.

TATTOOIST

(a hint of sarcasm)

Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy

or global prophesy?

VAUGHAN

There's no difference. James -- I

want you to let her give you this

one.

JAMES

Where do you think that one should

go?

VAUGHAN

It should go here.

JAMES

I thought that was you, up there.

CATHERINE

My last lesson's next week.

(pause)

James... my car...

JAMES

What? Tell me.

CATHERINE

I wasn't driving. I'd left the car

in the parking-lot at the airport.

Could it have been deliberate?

JAMES

One of your suitors?

CATHERINE

One of my suitors.

JAMES

It's Vaughan. He's courting you.

Let's go find him.

JAMES

The traffic... where is everyone?

They've all gone away.

CATHERINE

I'd like to go back. James...

JAMES

Not yet. It's only beginning.

JAMES

Vera! Vera Seagrave!

JAMES

Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm

trying to find Vaughan.

VERA

The police are after him. An American

serviceman was killed on the Northolt

overpass.

VERA

I was with him in the car at the

time.

JAMES

I think he'll be waiting for us at

the airport.

CATHERINE

James...

JAMES

I'd like to register a claim for the

black 1963 Lincoln, the one that

came in a couple of days ago. Is

there a form I can fill out?

POUND OFFICER

There certainly is, but you'll have

to come back between 7:30 and 4:30

to get one. What's your attachment

to that thing?

JAMES

A close friend owned it.

POUND OFFICER

Well, it's got to be a total write-

off. I don't see what you could

possibly do with it.

JAMES

Catherine. Are you all right? Are

you hurt?

CATHERINE

James, I... I don't know... I think

I'm all right...

JAMES

Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe

the next one...

THE END
