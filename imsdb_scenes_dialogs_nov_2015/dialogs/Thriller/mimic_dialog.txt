FADE IN:

PETER (OS)

How we doing?

SUSAN

We'll see...

ANCHORMAN (VO)

Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan

like a thief in the night, claiming its

first hundred victims before it was even

classified.

ANCHORMAN (VO)

Most were children under ten.

ANCHORMAN

Only after the numbers had reached into

the thousands were officials able to

identify the carrier of the deadly

infection...

DIRECTOR

Cut to three.

ANCHORMAN

Blattida Germanica.  The common

cockroach.

DIRECTOR

(To a RUNNER)

Tell them we're ready for a live feed.

REPORTER 1

...an insect that has proven virtually

immune to chemical control...

REPORTER 2

...the announcement by the Health

Department that an end to the nightmare

has finally...

REPORTER 3

...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan

Wyeth...

PROTESTER

...Susan has always been opposed to

biological tampering. A real advocate

for ecological causes, it's not...

PETER

(wrapping up)

...in Nature, evolution is a long,

leisurely conversation between an

organism and its environment. We,

however, did not have the luxury of

time...

SUSAN

With the aid of genetic labs throughout

the country, we recombined cockroach DNA

with genetic information from termites

and mantids. We were able to create a

biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if

you will...

SUSAN

Blattida Traditor.

SUSAN (OS)

The "Judas Roach".

SUSAN

The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers,

with a short life-span and heightened

pheromone emission.

SUSAN

The female is basically a sexual magnet;

common males travelled miles and fought

for the right to mate with them.

SUSAN

When they did, they took away something

else we added -- a hormone, passed

through sexual congress that causes their

metabolism to go into overdrive.  No

matter what their food intake, they

starved to death in a matter of hours.

PETER

We've achieved almost total eradication

of the roach population.  As of today,

the disease has been officially

contained.

CUT TO:

PETER (OS)

Sus, come on.  You're missing it.

PETER

Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping

this.

(Out.)

Susan, come on.  It's really good this

time. I got most of the lines out.

(No response.)

Sus?

PETER

Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came

and went and all we got was bad

cable...

PETER

Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

PETER

A shame.  You looked great tonight.

SUSAN

Please.

PETER

You did!

SUSAN

Do you think we did the right thing?

PETER

Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

SUSAN

You know what I mean...

SUSAN

We did no impact evaluation.  The

consequences of...

PETER

(sighs)

Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

NEWSREADER (TV)

...a flawless strategy which has stopped

a potential epidemic in its tracks...

PETER

You hear that?  Flawless.

SUSAN

We just don't know.

PETER

We know we saved lives.

PETER

There're gonna be a lot of kids running

around next year because of you.

PETER

Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple

of 'em'll be ours.

SUSAN

(smiling now)

We're down to a "couple" now, huh?

PETER

Oh, I don't know. People are beginning

to talk about us...

SUSAN

Don't worry, I'll save your honor.

Maybe I'll even marry you.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN TO:

CHINESE PREACHER

No.  Please, God, no!

CHUY

(a whisper)

Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...

CHUY

(very low)

Funny, funny shoes...

CUT TO:

PETER

Excuse me, ladies...

CUT TO:

SUSAN

...no, guys, these have to fit

perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let

me tell you why. Insects have no

hands. All they have is this set of

mandibles.

SUSAN

See?  This little piggy will grab the

prey.

SUSAN

Then this little piggy will tear it

in half...

SUSAN

...and this little one will grind it

to a pulp and push it in... all the

way into the mouth.  These are

precision tools here. Can you

remember that?

SUSAN

Good.  Then get it right.

CUT TO:

PETER

(teasing)

"Baby in a bottle..."

SUSAN

Don't tease.

PETER

You know where they get this

fertility stuff?  They extract it

from the urine of menopausal Italian

nuns.

SUSAN

(laughs)

Monks bottle their own wine. Don't

they?

SUSAN

Trust me. I've never been this late.

Never.

SUSAN

If nun's pee is what it takes...

SUSAN

You were the one who ran around with

ice in his underwear, don't forget

that.

PETER

Don't get kinky here...

PETER

Okay, meet me out front.

(to Susan)

I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five.

see you tonight.

SUSAN

I'll be late.

SUSAN

Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks

like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are

supposed to be made of dirt and

excretions...

SIRI

(a wicked smile)

Just like Trump Tower, then.

CUT TO:

JOSH

...So I say "buddy, you have every

violation in the book.  Gimme one

good reason not to close you down."

You know what the Kraut says to me?

JOSH

The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

PETER

(distractedly)

Selling your sould for a fistful of

carbohydrates...

JOSH

Not just any carbohydrates, mind you.

It was like being on the receiving

end of some kind of transcendent oral

sex.

(honks furiously)

We should get a strobe on this thing.

Maybe even a siren.

PETER

Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can

yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all

going to die!"

JOSH

Health Department...

PETER

You really love flashing that thing,

don't you?

JOSH

Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

PETER

Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were

the first on the scene?

WOYCHEK

(gestures to Rice)

We were both on patrol, saw this paint

mess. Then I looked through that cellar

window. We both did...

PETER

You gone in?

WOYCHEK

No. We waited.

PETER

Good.

PETER

(to Josh)

Get the EMT's in there, now.

CUT TO:

MANNY

C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.

(discreetly crossing himself)

Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.

PETER

Jesus.

WOYCHEK

(from the outside)

They look real sick, don't they?

CUT TO:

SUSAN

...as long as they're ready for the

opening I don't care, just tell them

that.

SIRI

I'm on it.  Don't worry.

(Beat)

Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry,

but... I kinda overheard you and

Peter.

SUSAN

(Smiles ironically)

Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant

could be on the line here.

SIRI

I just...well, I had this cousin in

Delhi.  She was having problems, too.

She, ah...

SUSAN

What?

SIRI

She used a baster.

SIRI

Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a

turkey baster.

SUSAN

Oh, Jesus.

SUSAN

Come on, darlin'...

SIRI

(continues)

She kept it under her bed. Thing is,

it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to

hide it from her husband, but...

SUSAN

What's this?

SIRI

Oh, right... They been here since noon.

I told them you're real busy.

SUSAN

Hello.

RICKY

You the bug lady, right?

SUSAN

(smiles)

I suppose so.

RICKY

We're here to deal.

SUSAN

Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes

Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been

upstate?

DAVIS

Avenue B.

SUSAN

(sadly)

I guess they got lost in this city.

RICKY

So, you wanna buy em?

DAVIS

There's extra wings in the bag.

SUSAN

You guys have done a nice job.  How bout

five dollars?

RICKY

(dismayed)

That's it?

DAVIS

(to Ricky)

Show her the weirdbug.

RICKY

Cost a dollar just to look.

DAVIS

It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a

little...

SUSAN

Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars

for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some

tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you

catch will be in better shape.

DAVIS

Deal!

RICKY

You crazy! That's the best!!

DAVIS

Bug's almost dead anyway.

DAVIS

Thanks, lady.

SIRI

Ten dollars?

SUSAN

Alphabet City kids- there's much worse

things they could be selling.

SIRI

I hate this fucking window...

CUT TO:

PETER

(to Josh)

There's plenty of systemic infection

already, so as soon as we get a

preliminary reading, start them on

anti-biotics. You saw this?

PETER

Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have

it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll

quarantine them a week just to make sure.

JOSH

Immigration's gonna love you for that.

PETER

Tell them to send flowers to the

usual address.

JOSH

Two shifts, people rotating from bed to

work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart

hell, here.

PETER

Did they get the sleazebag who owns this

place?

JOSH

Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people

from Yunan. Slave labor...

(eyes his notebook)

Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the

flophouse fronting for them. No sign of

him.

PETER

Tell her she's going to be alright.

We'll take care of her.

YANG

She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark

Angels" are coming for her. She says

they took some of her people away.

PETER

Dark Angels?

YANG

(Shrugs.)

Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man.

They come up with some wacky stuff.

SUSAN

Siri?

(louder)

Siri?!

SIRI

...the fuck?

SUSAN

(To Siri)

Can you...?

SUSAN

(a scared whisper)

Could you...help me...?

CUT TO:

SUSAN

I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to

pin it down, okay?

SIRI

What is it?

SUSAN

I have no idea.  Are you ready?

SIRI

Oh my God...

SIRI

Shit!! Get it!  Get it!

SUSAN

(Noticing Siri's hand)

It bit you.

SIRI

No shit.

SUSAN

This wing configuration. I've

never...

SIRI

(looking at her injury)

Fuck! It broke the skin...

SUSAN

And they're not fully developed.  This

thing's not even an adult.

SUSAN

My God.

SIRI

What?

SUSAN (OS)

It's breathing.

SIRI

That's impossible.  Insects don't...

SUSAN

I know.

(Picks up a SCALPEL)

Help me get a sample.

SUSAN

Hold on, big guy, hold on...

CUT TO:

SUSAN

Hold on a second...

SIRI

What?

SIRI (O.S.)

Susan?

SUSAN

Call security.

CUT TO:

MANNY

Not too little, not too much. You rub it

in, around and around like this. Let the

leather take it.

MANNY

You watching? You should learn to

work the shoes. You're good with your

hands...

MANNY

Chuy...you gonna get all wet.

MANNY

Did you look at the story book I got you?

MANNY

Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that,

Chico?  "Friends"?

MANNY (OS)

A friend is the one you can trust.  When

you are with a friend, no matter where in

the world, you are at home.

MANNY

In this city. A friend is a hard thing to

find...

CHUY

Funny Shoes...

CHUY

Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.

MANNY

No one is there. Is empty.

MANNY

Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on

the cross, but that is not a holy place.

You understand?

MANNY

Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in

your head, eh?

CHUY

Mr. Funny Shoes...

CUT TO:

PETER

Josh, what was Immigration's

countdown?

JOSH

Thirty-three workers.

PETER

There are thirty five listed in the

reverend Wong's roster...

JOSH

Shit.

PETER

Remember what that woman said, about

people being taken? Check with the

copsin the area.

PETER

Sus?

PETER

(Looks around once again)

Susan?

PETER

(Regarding the laundry.)

Thought it was my week for that.

SUSAN

(Shrugs.)

I needed to think. It was either this

or the weather channel.

SUSAN

This thing was the size of my fist,

Peter!! That's off the charts!

PETER

Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

SUSAN

Don't you get it? It's more than

that.

SUSAN

You know why insects don't grow larger?

Because they don't have a complex

respiratory system. What I saw did. It

had lungs.

SUSAN

Evolution doesn't work that fast.

Something pushed that thing to take the

leap. We need to find another specimen.

PETER

We?

SUSAN

I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.

SUSAN

There's only two species who match the

enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant

in the Amazon...

SUSAN

The other we released here two years ago.

ARMENIAN DRIVER

Avenue B... again! Maybe you got

wrong letter, uh?

SUSAN

Keep going. We'll tell you when to

stop...

PETER

Maybe they lied to you.

SUSAN

Even if they did... that's all we

have, isn't it?

ARMENIAN

No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!

SUSAN

Pull over!

ARMENIAN DRIVER

What...?

SUSAN

Metaxonycha Godmani.

PETER

So?

RICKY (OS)

If you want your money back, forget it!

DAVIS (OS)

We already spent it!

SUSAN

We're here to deal.

CUT TO:

PETER

Here, let me...

SUSAN

You sure you didn't see one of these?

RICKY

Gross. What is it?

SUSAN

An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had

more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

RICKY

(shakes his head)

No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

DAVIS

It was in that corner over there.

RICKY

Sucker was fast, man.

(Picks up a pipe.)

Had to take it out with one a these.

PETER

Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.

RICKY

Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops

you're here.

PETER

Let's keep it at five and I won't

condemn your clubhouse.

PETER

(quietly)

Look, a broken tooth...

SUSAN (OS)

You okay?

SUSAN

There's something under here.

PETER

Shit.

SUSAN

Let me try.  My hands are smaller.

PETER

Honey, just leave it.

SUSAN

No, there's...

LEONARD

(Wearily)

Now don't tell me.

LEONARD (OS)

You lost a token, right?

CUT TO:

PETER

Look, I showed you my badge...

LEONARD

Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot

bigger one you wanna go down there.

That's the old maintenance grid, Doc.

Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

PETER

The Department of Public Health...

LEONARD

...should know better'n to go sneakin'

around my turf...

PETER

Fine.  You want me to call your

supervisor?

LEONARD

Please do.  He's a lonely guy.

CHUY (OS)

Gucci.  Flat pump.

ERNEST

Your shoes.

SUSAN

(Laughs.  To Chuy.)

That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?

ERNEST

No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.

MANNY

(immediately)

He's special.

LEONARD

He can imitate anything, you just watch

him.

PETER

(Irritably, to Leonard)

Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

LEONARD

No, you talkin' at me.

ERNEST

(discreetly, to Susan)

Is there some reward for this?

SUSAN

I guess that could be arranged.

PETER

For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two-

bit bureaucratic, territorial number

on me?

LEONARD

You wanna keep up the conversation, you

best come back with the proper permits

and the right attitude.

PETER

You give someone a fucking uniform

and... Did you hear how he talked to us?

SUSAN

I heard how you talked to him.

PETER

Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?

SUSAN

He was just doing his job.

PETER

Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

PETER

He wants a permit, I'll get him a

permit.

CUT TO:

ERNEST

Chrissakes...

ERNEST

Guys, c'mon.

ERNEST

I told you to stick by the maintenance

area.

BAG LADY

Nah... It's private property now.

SKELETAL BUM

He eats down there.

ERNEST

Who?

HOMELESS MAN

The Stickman.

BAG LADY

Long John.

ERNEST

Graffiti artist, uh?

(To Homeless People)

Look guys, just get off my beat, you

hear?  Get moving.

DISSOLVE TO:

ERNEST

Hey, buddy!

ERNEST

Get off my track...

ERNEST

Sweet Jesus...

CUT TO:

PETER

Heya.

(Kisses her on the cheek.)

Where's the boss?

SIRI

Ant mound.

PETER

You okay?

SIRI

It's just a headache.  We were

sandblasting Trump Tower here since

four this morning.

PETER

Maybe you should sit...

SIRI

I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could

use a good word right now.

PETER

Great crowd.

SUSAN

No such thing, baby.

SUSAN

I get the feeling they came more for

the potroast than the apterids.

PETER

Fuck 'em.  They don't know what

they're missing.

SUSAN

(Distantly)

Right.

PETER

What's wrong?

SUSAN

Oh...nothing that a little

menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't

cure. Least that's what I thought.

PETER

(genuinely moved)

Oh, no, you were-

SUSAN

I was just late.

SUSAN

Ironic, don't you think?  These guys

can hatch hundreds of offspring in a

single clutch of eggs, right? And

here we are...

PETER

Susan, we're not b-

SIRI (OS)

Susan?

SIRI

(Weakly.)

I'm sorry.  I think...I need...

SUSAN

Siri...

SUSAN

Siri!

SMASH CUT TO:

PETER

...I think it's some kind of systemic

infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases

like it yesterday. A sweatshop in

Canal.

RAYMOND

(to Peter.)

Okay, look.  You better come in with

me.  Help me through.

RAYMOND

(To Peter)

All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the

dril?

PETER

It'll come back to me.

PETER

Looks like a Lyme disease rash.

RAYMOND

It's not consistent with the internal

bleeding. Any idea what bit her?

RAYMOND

I think we're gonna need to have that

specimen here.

CUT TO:

CHUY

Mr. Funny Shoes.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

...you don't even know what you're

looking for.

PETER

You said that thing was big as your

hand.  I don't think I'm going to

miss...

SUSAN

Why take the chance?  Just let me go

down there with you...

PETER

No.

PETER

Susan, listen to me:  you handled

that insect almost as much as Siri...

SUSAN

It didn't bite me.

PETER

I know.  But if it was carrying

something...there's a chance you

could have been exposed.

PETER

Chris is going to run some blood

tests on you.  I want you to stay here

till he's absolutely sure you're

clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me...

You'll catch up with us...

PETER

We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.

CUT TO:

MANNY

My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get

a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you

that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

MANNY

Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em,

Chu-chu...

(He pours a glass of milk.)

We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to

pick some up tonight, okay?

CUT TO:

WORKMAN

Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.

WORKMAN

Oh, God...

CONTROL BOOTH

VOICE

What's the problem?

WORKMAN

I think it's a baby!

CUT TO:

RAYMOND

How you feeling?

SUSAN

You tell me.

RAYMOND

Your blood tests were all negative.

You checked out.

SUSAN

What about Siri?

RAYMOND

She's stable.  I don't think there's

any immediate danger, but we'll have

to keep her under observation...

SUSAN

You think it's some form of

Strickler's, don't you?

RAYMOND

Pathology's still working on the

tissue samples.  If it is...it must

be an errant strain.  Shorter

incubation period.

(Beat.)

I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know

yet.

JEREMY (OS)

...how many times I gotta tell you,

man: we can't accept this!

EMT (OS)

Well, what the hell else am I suppose

to do with it?

JEREMY

Take it out back and throw it in the

friggin' dumpster!

EMT

Not unless somebody signs for it.

SUSAN

Oh, my God.

JEREMY

Hey, you can't...

SUSAN

What's your name?

JEREMY

Jeremy...

SUSAN

Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris

Raymond, will you?

JEREMY

Lady...

SUSAN

Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond!

NOW!!

JEREMY

Okay.

SUSAN

(To EMT)

Where'd you find it?

EMT

Washed up at the filtration plant on

Bank street. Some asshole there

thought it was a baby. They called

us.

EMT

It's a lobster, right?

CUT TO:

LEONARD

Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's

almost over.

PETER

Guess someone requested you for

overtime...buddy.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

Posterior sternites are gone...half the

protonum rotted off.

RAYMOND

Maggots...

SUSAN

Near hatching.  Thing must've died about

three weeks ago.

SUSAN

Do you have a polaroid?

CUT TO:

LEONARD

You all watch your step.  We got some

burrows goin' down seven stories

here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to

come pick you up.

JOSH

(Whisper to Peter)

New York's finest.

JOSH

There's really people living down here?

LEONARD

Mole people. This section was pretty

popular, all the way to Fulton Street...

LEONARD

Substance abusers, mental cases... Then

about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors

got started... Someone found a couple of

stiffs...

LEONARD

Down here's the land of talk, see? So the

wildest version goes the farthest. They

mark that area with a sign or a drawing,

and its as good as closed.

(chuckles)

We had one fella... for years said he was

Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo.

SUSAN

It's me. Can you hear me?

PETER

(phone, barely audible)

Yeah, barely. We haven't found

anything down here. Nothing...

SUSAN

I have.

SUSAN

I'm on my way. I've got something for you

to look at...

PETER

We'll be back at the platform in...

LEONARD

20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing

anymore.

PETER

(To phone.)

20 minutes.

(Beat.)

Susan?

LEONARD

Funny.  Shoulda seen some track

bunnies by now.

JOSH

What?

LEONARD

Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're

usually around.

CUT TO:

MANNY

No, no, please understand... I can't

wait that long.

MANNY

Please. I write it down.

(he writes)

2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean

"case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When

can you...?

MANNY

No, I can't wait...no, listen...

MANNY

Hijos de puta.

MANNY

Mr. Funny Shoes.

CUT TO:

JOSH

(Sniffing)

Smells like acid.

PETER

Ammonia.

JOSH

Peter...

PETER

Yeah...?

JOSH

There's some weird shit here.

PETER

Weird shit...?

JOSH

Take a look.

JOSH

Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird

shit.

(Beat)

Whatever it is, it's not human.

LEONARD

And it needs some metamucil.

CUT TO:

MANNY

Chuy...

MANNY

Chuy...

CUT TO:

REPAIRMAN

Hey, Lady, all power will be down in

five minutes, okay?

SUSAN

Okay....

SUSAN

Peter?

CUT TO:

LEONARD

I've never been this deep. This area

here is the Old Armory station. They

built it in the 40's. Ran out of money

half-way through...

LEONARD

Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.

PETER (O.S.)

(To Josh)

I want a team in here by six tonight,

hands and knees with toothpicks...

PETER

Don't!!

LEONARD

Did you see the size of that thing?!

PETER

Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

JOSH

Peter!

PETER

It's okay.  I'm all right.

LEONARD

Get the hell away from me!

PETER

(Deadpan)

He's all right, too.

LEONARD

Oh, that's gonna work.

PETER

You got a better way up?

LEONARD

(To Josh.)

Show that to the station manager.  Tell

him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt

he don't have someone down here in ten.

JOSH

H-how do I get...?

LEONARD

Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to

your right...

LEONARD (OS)

Go left.  Go left again till you hit the

fork... Then right again. You got that?

JOSH

I think so. One right, two lefts...

LEONARD

And a right.

JOSH

Right.

PETER

Go Josh. Now.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SUSAN

HELP!!!

CUT TO:

JOSH

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

CUT TO:

PETER

Any luck?

LEONARD

Well...there's an old service elevator

half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna

be much use, though.  Lines are dead.

PETER

You said those cables're still live.

Can't we rewire...?

LEONARD

Oh, man, there you go again.

PETER

What?

LEONARD

Those things bring juice to the new

stations.  You just can't rewire that

shit...

PETER

For Chrissakes, what's the problem?

You need a memo every time you fart?

LEONARD

All right, motherfucker, that's it.

PETER

Shh! Shh!

LEONARD

(tentative)

Manny?!

LEONARD

My God, what the hell are you...?

MANNY

Hurry, the woman needs help!

PETER

Woman?

CUT TO:

SUSAN

(A whisper)

Don't.

PETER

Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

PETER

(To Manny and Leonard)

Give me your belts.

LEONARD

(to Manny, as he ties them

together)

What are you doing down here?

MANNY

Chuy. He was taken. He's down here

somewhere...

(to Peter)

Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was

after her.

PETER

What's...?

MANNY

Just hurry.

PETER

I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.

SUSAN

No, Jesus, no.

PETER

(To Leonard)

Toss the flare down!

LEONARD

I only got...

PETER

Just do it!

PETER

Oh, Jesus...

LEONARD

What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is

that?!

SUSAN

(A desperate appeal)

Peter...

PETER

Wrap it around your hand!

PETER

Come on!

PETER

Get on my shoulders!

PETER

Let's go!

PETER

Oh, shit...

MANNY

There!

LEONARD

Get the goddam door!

PETER

Push it! Push it! Don't let up!

LEONARD

What the fuck was that?

LEONARD

You better tell me what the hell's

going on here!

MANNY

Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

PETER

(to Leonard)

We don't know!! We don't know what it

is!

PETER

Wait a minute-

LEONARD

Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm

going to-

LEONARD

GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!

PETER

Its muscles are locked.

LEONARD

(Hoarse)

Oh, Jesus!!

MANNY

Wait...

LEONARD

Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get

it off!!

PETER

(Stopping him.)

Hey hey hey...

MANNY

Is how we make loose the ticks back home.

CUT TO:

PETER

Just keep holding it.  Can you do that

for me?

(No reponse.)

Susan?

MANNY (OS)

Doctor Tyler?

PETER

You feel anything?

LEONARD

Yeah, I feel like ripping your

fucking eyes out...

PETER

Leonard, listen.  I need to see if

there's any nerve damage before we

carry you back.

(No response.)

Look, I'm trying to help you here...

LEONARD

Oh, you helped me here, all right, white

boy.  You and your goddam memo. You

needed to prove your point, uh?

PETER

I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you

bleed to death is the best apology.

MANNY

Where the hell'd that thing come from?

PETER

(Quietly)

A mistake.

LEONARD

"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

PETER

It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.

LEONARD

How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin'

around with its buttside gone and a

fucking pipe through its heart...

SUSAN

(Quietly)

It doesn't have a heart.

SUSAN

Just inner chambers...

MANNY

But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

SUSAN

No...

SUSAN

That's what it wanted you to see.

CUT TO:

PETER

So, you're saying this is like those bugs

that -- that look like twigs or leaves

or...

SUSAN

(shakes her head)

That's camouflage...

SUSAN

This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic

their predators. A butterfly can look

like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar

can copy a snake...

SUSAN

This has evolved to mimic the most

dangerous predator it's ever had...

SUSAN

Us.

SUSAN

Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas

that code...

MANNY

(quotes)

"...and behold he will come that walks as

a man, yet is not a man- ..."

SUSAN

This, is our baby Peter. Yours and

mine. Aren't you proud?

SUSAN

All these...they're like tunnels of an

insect colony. Once these things hit a

certain population density, they'll have

to move out, form new colonies.

SUSAN

We have to get help down here.  Burn

the tunnels before...

LEONARD

Get the doors!

PETER

Is there a switch?

LEONARD

Third rail is dead.

(To Manny and Susan.)

Get me up.  There must be a manual

override in the booth.

SUSAN

(Whispering to Peter)

The lights!

LEONARD

(Starts looking around)

Where's the damn crank?!

PETER

(hissing a whisper)

They're coming!

SUSAN

I got it!

SUSAN

Hurry! Please!

LEONARD

Come on, you son-of-a...

SUSAN

Oh, God.

(Looks at Leonard.)

The blood...

SUSAN

His blood! It's driving them crazy! We

have to mask the odor!

PETER

How?!

PETER

It's no use! They know we're in here!

SUSAN

They don't know anything Peter, they

just sense. They're hardwired!

PETER

Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's

not like them!

SUSAN

Exac...

SUSAN

(To Manny)

Give me your razor.

PETER

What are you doing?

LEONARD

(covers his nose)

Shit!

SUSAN

Rub it on the windows!

PETER

What-

SUSAN

Just do it!!

LEONARD

What are you putting that crap on me

for?

SUSAN

Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to

identify themselves to each other.

CUT TO:

LEONARD (O.S.)

Okay. That's us.

LEONARD

This track we're on? Goes down into

the repair area.

(Makes an "X" further down)

The elevator's over here. Leads up to

the active tunnels.

PETER

Can we get this car there?

LEONARD

Someone'd have to go to the

switchroom, pull the coupling lever,

that'll send us left and to the

elevator.

SUSAN

But the power...

LEONARD

Hell, I might be able to juice the whole

area, if I can get to the power box. It's

just a couple of cables...

MANNY

Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard?

Hop?

PETER

(To Leonard)

Just talk me through it. I can go with

Manny.

LEONARD

It would take a minute or so.

(beat)

You won't last that long out there.

SUSAN

Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

PETER

We'll cover ourselves with this. They

can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

SUSAN

Peter-

PETER

It worked before...

SUSAN

(an edge in her voice)

The scent won't last...

PETER

That's why we should do it now.

LEONARD

It's just a regular old pump switch,

okay? Right by the track signal

board.

LEONARD

The lights come up, you pull the

switch.

MANNY

I pull.

LEONARD

You don't do that, we're on the wrong

track.

(turns to Peter)

You...

LEONARD

You gonna finally get to fuck around

with the wires.  Think you can

handle it?

PETER

Depends.  You got a memo?

LEONARD

All right then.  You gonna find two

wires.  One's green.  The other's

blue...

MANNY

He's out there. I heard him. How can

he be? This things...

SUSAN

Manny...

MANNY

I didn't protect him, lady. He

trusted me. And I didn't protect

him... His father...I lost his father

to the streets and now, Chuy...

SUSAN

We'll find him. We'll be back and

find him.

SUSAN

You're going to have to keep it

really slow.  Their eyes react to

sudden movements.

SUSAN

Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,

try not to sweat.  They can sense

chemical changes...

PETER

Try not to sweat?

LEONARD

Okay, people...

LEONARD (OS)

...are we ready for this?

LEONARD

Whatever you do, don't step on the

third rail coming back. Six hundred

volts'll blow your leg right off.

PETER

I was just thinking how I could use a

pair of pliers... and I remembered where

they are...

SUSAN

(overlapping)

That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.

PETER

In the tool box under the kitchen

counter...

SUSAN

Open it.

SUSAN

Choke on it, motherfuckers.

PETER

(to himself)

Green...Blue...

MANNY

Chuy...?

MANNY

(Whispering)

Nino...

MANNY

Chuy...

PETER

Dammit!

SUSAN

(horrified)

The scent's fading...

LEONARD

(tense as hell)

What's Manny doing? I can't see him

anymore.

MANNY

Nino, please...

MANNY

Dios mio...

MANNY

(barely audible)

Chuy...

CHUY

(whispers)

Friends.

MANNY

NO, NO, CHUY, NO...

CHUY

Friends.

MANNY

God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot

see...

SUSAN

Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!

SUSAN

(to Leonard)

THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

PETER

Manny...

SUSAN

Peter!!

PETER

Come on, kid...

PETER

(horrified)

Jesus!

SUSAN

Run!! Peter!!

SUSAN

(Yelling to Leonard)

GO!!

LEONARD

The kid...

PETER

The kid's with them!!

LEONARD

What do you-?

PETER

Go!! Just go!!

LEONARD

He didn't do it!

SUSAN

What?

LEONARD

Manny never threw the coupling switch!!

We're goin' the wrong way!!!

SUSAN

MOVE BACK!!!

SUSAN

You all right?

LEONARD

(Simply, re: his leg)

Can't feel it.

SUSAN

Which way?

LEONARD

Across both tracks!!

PETER

Shit.

LEONARD

(Quietly)

Lemme go.

SUSAN

We're no leaving you!

LEONARD

No way we can outrun 'em together.

Move it!

LEONARD

NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!

LEONARD

Come on.  Come to poppa.

SUSAN

There.

LEONARD

Come here, you mealy-mouthed...

LEONARD

Multi-legged...

LEONARD

Maggot-munchin' motherfu...

SUSAN

I can't tell if it's working!

SUSAN

Oh, come on, come on!

PETER

Jump in.

PETER

You go first. I'll be right below you.

SUSAN

Your arm, you can't...

PETER

I can.  We can do this...

SUSAN

We're gonna make it!

PETER

Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,

even flow!

PETER

C'mon...

SUSAN

Ah...

PETER

Talk to me.

SUSAN

Peter...

SUSUAN

I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.

PETER

Hang onto me.

PETER

Hang on tight!

PETER

Come on!

SUSAN

Don't look back!

SUSAN

No...

PETER

We can do it!

LITTLE GIRL

Mommy, there's people...

PETER

(Adrenaline pumping)

We-can-do-this!!!

PETER

It'll be fine... it... They're still

down there. We'll seal the whole

system, go in with whatever it

takes...

PETER

It'll be fine... We nailed them

before, we'll do it again...

SUSAN

(barely audible)

They've come up...
