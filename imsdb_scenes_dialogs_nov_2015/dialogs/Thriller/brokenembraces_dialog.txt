JUDIT

Mateo, say something!

MATEO-HARRY

Mateo is dead.

JUDIT

(Sweet and devastated) Don't say that!

OFF HARRY

I always wanted to be another person, to be someone

beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn't

seem enough. Living a single life wasn't enough for

me. And half-joking, I came up with a pseudonym for

myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would

have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him

author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I

came up with a standard biography to fill the back

flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an

industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a

boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A

self-made man, active and attractive like an English

spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years,

Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person,

me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't

be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my

pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror,

we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled,

reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not

reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one

left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and,

never better stated, a self-made man, one might even

say, "self-written man". There was only one detail I

had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer.

WAITER FRIEND

Do you want me to read you something from the

newspaper?

HARRY

No, thanks. I am off on a stroll.

8

GIRL

(Alarmed) Watch out! You can't cross!

9

HARRY

Sorry . . .

GIRL

I'll tell you when!

HARRY

Thank you very much.

HARRY

I live nearby, two blocks up, would you mind coming along

with me?

GIRL

10

But I warn you, I've never read out-loud, you may not

like it!

HARRY

You will only have to browse.

GIRL

Do you mind if I turn on the light? So that I can

read... It's too dark in here.

HARRY

Oh, yes... Turn the light on...

GIRL

Ernesto Martel is dead!

HARRY

Who?

11

GIRL

Ernesto Martel. I know one of his granddaughters...

HARRY

So he's dead.

GIRL

You knew him?

HARRY

No...

GIRL

What are you interested in, politics, economy... culture?

HARRY

I am interested in you. What are you like? Do you

mind describing yourself?

12

JUDIT

What are you laughing at?

13

HARRY

I am only smiling, because of the way you're looking

at me.

GIRL

(To Harry) I must go.

HARRY

Thanks for helping me cross.

JUDIT

(Annoyed and without apologizing, even if it seems

she's trying) I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.

HARRY

She helped me cross the street and I invited her in to

read me the newspaper . . .

14

JUDIT

Harry, you can't bring into your house the first

person who helps you across the street. One of these

days something awful will happen to you!

HARRY

(Sullen and ironic) Everything awful that's had to

happen to me has. Now, all that's left is for me to

enjoy life . . .

JUDIT

Diego told me yesterday that you finished the script.

HARRY

I would like to add a final epilogue. It may not be

necessary, but I'd like to write it.

JUDIT

I agreed to deliver the definitive version to the

producer and director today.

HARRY

You will have it by tomorrow, don't worry.

15

HARRY

Ernesto Martel has died.

JUDIT

I think he was very ill...

HARRY

It's been so long since we've spoken of him!

16

JUDIT

You look awful ...!

DIEGO

I ran here.

HARRY

And it's Monday! Diego, you don't have to run for me.

We are not in a hurry.

JUDIT

I am, I've committed ...

HARRY

You'll have it by tonight, don't worry.

JUDIT

Start thinking of the next script. Some kind of

horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It's

what sells best ...

HARRY

I don't know if I'll know how to. I was thinking of

developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son...

JUDIT

(Perplexed) The writer who married Marilyn?

HARRY

17

Yes... After Marilyn he married the photographer Inge

Morat and they had a son. He was born mentally

handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even

mention him in his memoirs. He never recognized him

publicly. From the moment he was born, he had him

placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of

him. Despite his condition, the boy was able to learn

and to make an almost normal life for himself. He

lived in an apartment with other friends and he found

a job as a clerk in a supermarket...

JUDIT

And Miller never saw him? ...

HARRY

(Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was

giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded

man, who had been condemned to death, after what was

believed to be a forced confession. Among those

present was his mentally handicapped son, who was

integrally involved with organizations that aided all

sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to

finally be sharing something with his father. At the

end of the conference, he approached the stage and

held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless

to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract

himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine,

it would not have been politically correct, least of

all given the situation in which Miller found himself.

Then the stranger let go of him and told him: "I am

18

your son, Daniel, and I am very proud of you, Father!"

This was the only time father and son saw each other.

JUDIT

(Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but I don't think

we can write a script about Arthur Miller without

procuring rights from the family.

HARRY

We change the names, the story is not about the

writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the

son who survives without the least bit of rancor

toward the father who has ignored him his entire life.

It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent

goodness. There aren't those many good men that one

can write about.

JUDIT

It's a beautiful story. But years ago, when you began

writing again and I began selling your scripts, you

told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor

biopics. Nor stories whose protagonists were film

19

directors, handicapped or blind. I remember clearly

because the part of the biopics surprised me.

(SMILES)

HARRY

I can't bear them... (As if he had at that very moment

remembered) It's true, it's true I said all that, but

this wouldn't exactly be a biopic...

JUDIT

I'll get it.

HARRY

Diego, go to the end of the document.

20

DIEGO

Did you bring me the session?

ALEX

It's still warm. Just downloaded from the eMule.

DIEGO

Dude. I'll throw it in now. You want something to

drink?

ALEX

Yes. And you, would you like a tip of "crystal"?

DIEGO

I pass. I do need to sleep once in a while.

21

JUDIT

You need anything?

MATEO

No, thanks.

JUDIT

What are you up to?

22

HARRY

I was going to read an Alice Munro story on the MP3.

JUDIT

Then I'll leave you. I'll stop by tomorrow, when I

can. I have to finish the budget for the Americans as

soon as possible, so that I can decide what to do ...

(Hangs up) (To the Americans, in English). Ok, we can

continue tommorow...

OFF

Ernesto Martel has passed away at his residence in the

countryside, "La Berzosa." Financier, of Chilean

origin, who achieved great success and notoriety due

to his involvement in the financing of crucial public

infrastructures in different Latin American countries.

23

OFF

Recently he had been involved in various financial

scandals. He was implicated for fraud in the infamous

"case of Bank Banelco". He was married three times,

and had two children...

ERNESTO

... I just spoke to the Transportation Minister. Things

are in full swing. Yes, we are doing the Caracas

24

metro ... there's a lot of money ... at least five years.

I am looking for a qualified company and had you in

mind ... of course, I will serve as intermediary, I have

been told so by the President himself.

25

ERNESTO

I will dictate a letter for the Minister of Industry...

26

ERNESTO

Are you alright?

MAGDALENA

(As she picks it up) Yes, thank you.

ERNESTO

Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I'm sure I could

help you.

MAGDALENA

My father is very ill. This afternoon they are

releasing him and I wanted to ask you if I could leave

an hour early to go pick him and my mother up.

ERNESTO

Of course. What's wrong with him?

MAGDALENA

Stomach cancer, metastasized.

ERNESTO

I am really sorry.

27

LENA

I can't believe they have thrown you out of the

hospital, like dogs...

MOTHER

(Humiliated, hurt) Yes, honey, yes...

LENA

(Indignant) Does Dr. Alvaro de la Torre know this?

MOTHER

He's been the one...

LENA

But how? If he was going to operate him this week,

and last week, and the other week...

MOTHER

28

I couldn't explain on the phone. (She recounts) Dr.

De la Torre called us for an appointment. I though it

would be to tells us that they were finally going to

operate on your father... but instead he tells us they

are releasing him. (In disbelief) I asked him what

he meant and he replied: "quite simple, it's July and

I am leaving for my vacation" (as her story moves

forward the mother relives the same states of mind

that she went through in her conversation with the

doctor) And I told him, "you are throwing us out onto

the street?" and he insisted, without the least bit

of compassion, "I am releasing him so that you can go

home", but "what can I do with him at home in his

condition?". "That's your problem" he told me (she

cries), "do whatever you like, I am leaving on

vacation". "He is dying!" I begged. "Well, let him

die in peace, at home", he said to me.

LENA

(Powerless, furious) It cannot be! They can't keep

him for twenty days, torturing him with tests in

preparation for an operation and now leave him like

this, just because the doctor is leaving on vacation!

LENA

Have you protested?...

MOTHER

To who? Dr. De la Torre is the head surgeon. There

is no one over him.

29

FATHER

Did you forget about me?

LENA

(Her eyes welled up with tears, she gathers her last

bit of strength) How could you think that Dad!

FATHER

You know what Dr. De la Torre told me before he broke

the news?

30

FATHER

(To the Mother) You tell her, Paca.

MOTHER

He said: I am glad you are not still in the service,

Emilio.

LENA

(Not understanding)Why?

MOTHER

"Because if you were still in the service, after what

I am going to tell you, you'd shoot me..."

LENA

He really said that?

FATHER

Yes... and he was smiling, he thought it was funny...

31

LENA

Call me any time, no matter what it is!

32

33

LENA

Madame Mylene? Hello, it's Severine.

MADAME MYLENE

Severine! It's been so long! I'm so happy to hear from

you.

LENA

I need money.

MADAME SEVERINE

How soon?

LENA

Now! My weekend's free. I am busy during the week.

MADAME MYLENE

I'll see what I can do. May I call tonight if I find

something?

34

LENA

Yes. I'll wait for your call.

LENA

Yes?

OFF ERNESTO MARTEL

Severine?

LENA

(On alert) Who is it?

35

ERNESTO MARTEL

I am calling on Madame Mylene's behalf.

LENA

(Slightly altering her voice) You've made a mistake,

sir. No Severine lives here.

ERNESTO MARTEL

I must have dialed wrong. Excuse me.

MADAME

Hi! Has he already called?

LENA

Who?

MADAME

The client! You will not complain about my speediness!

LENA

36

(Furious) But... how have you given him my number?!

MADAME

I couldn't say no.

LENA

Things aren't done like that! Have you gone mad!?

MADAME

He knows everything. And I haven't been the one to

tell him, he found out on his own account, he knows

about your foray into acting, and that you sometimes

"acted" for me...

MADAME

Months ago he made me promise him that if you got back

in contact with me I would call him. I couldn't say

no, he is one of my best clients.

LENA

You bitch!

MADAME

(Unmoved) Look on the bright side. He must really

like you to go to the lengths he has... Perhaps you've

found your Sugar Daddy.

MADAME

What have you agreed on? Remember I am part of the

business.

37

LENA

(Wakes up, suddenly, frightened) How is Dad?

MOTHER

(Crying) Not well at all, my dear. We've been through

a hellish night. He has not eaten anything. But he

won't stop bleeding... and everything is coming up...

it's as if he has burst inside.

LENA

I will be there with an ambulance immediately. Be

ready to leave!

LENA

Mr. Martel? It's Lena.

ERNESTO

(Delighted) Good morning, Lena.

38

LENA

I am sorry to bother you...

ERNESTO

(Gallantly) You are never a bother.

LENA

My father is dying. We must admit him urgently, but I

don't know where. As I told you, they released him

from Puerta de Hierro yesterday.

ERNESTO

Don't worry. We will take him to the Emergency Room

at a private clinic. (Wanting to confirm) You told

me that he has stomach cancer...

LENA

Yes.

ERNESTO

(Thinking) The best digestive surgeon in Europe is at

the Clinica de la Luz. I will take care of the

admittance issue. Call an ambulance and tell them to

pick up your parents. I'll meet you at the Clinica de

la Luz in an hour...

LENA

(Plainly, but grateful) Thank you very much.

39

ERNESTO

How's the patient?

SURGEON

You have brought him in terrible conditions... Which I

suppose you know.

ERNESTO

(With good manners, but authoritarian) Will you be

able to save him?

40

SURGEON

We will do everything possible... at this very moment

it is impossible to operate...

SURGEON

Perhaps tomorrow. We are providing parenteral

nutrition... He will need a blood transfusion...

(Looks at both women) Do you have any relatives who

can donate?

LENA

Well, here... I don't know...

ERNESTO

Give him the best blood you've got!

SURGEON

I will keep you updated on his condition in the next

hours... (He says goodbye to them)

MOTHER

May I stay?

SURGEON

Yes, of course. You can stay in his room as long as

you wish.

41

LENA

I'll stay here, Mom. You have to rest...

MOTHER

(With strength, but beaten) No, you rest... You've

already done enough... Thank you very much, Mr. Ernesto.

If my husband survives, it will be thanks to you.

ERNESTO

He will survive, ma'am.

LENA

Really, you don't want me to stay? Or that I bring you

something?

MOTHER

No, go. You both must have things to do...

42

HARRY

(From inside) Who is it?

RAY X

I'm Ray X ...

HARRY

Ray X? There's no such a name.

RAY X

It's a nickname, at one time I took a lot of ecstasy.

HARRY

What do you want?

RAY X

To write a script with you, so that I can direct it.

HARRY

It's your first film?

RAY X

I made a documentary (naive) ... a very good one,

eighteen years ago, this would be my first fiction

film.

HARRY

43

OK. Call Judit Garcia, my agent, and explain

everything. If she finds it suitable, she will set up

a date for us. And now, I'd like to go dry myself, you

pulled me out of the shower and I am dripping wet.

RAY X

(The words escape) You are naked?

HARRY

It's none of your business.

HARRY

Will you stand there all day?

RAY X

You haven't given me Judit Garcia's phone number.

HARRY

Find it out. She is a well-known Production Director.

44

OFF JUDIT

Hi Harry. It's me.

HARRY

Tell me.

OFF JUDIT

A young director has been in contact with me. His

name is Ray X and he wants to write a script with you...

Does this ring a bell?

HARRY

Yes... (He is about to tell her he showed up without

notice, but Judit doesn't give him time to).

JUDIT

(Since she is always busy and in a hurry) Well, he

wants to see you this afternoon, or tomorrow, if you

can. I have asked him for an advance and he has

accepted, but I cannot accompany you either today or

tomorrow...

HARRY

I will speak to him... and let you know.

JUDIT

Good, I hope you like him, he seems to be loaded.

HARRY

Have you seen him?

JUDIT

No, just judging from his voice. And from the check I

am about to ask him for. I will send Diego over so

that you're not alone.

45

RAY X

Hi, I'm Ray X.

HARRY

Hello Mr. X. Please, have a seat...

RAY X

Please, don't address me formally.

46

RAY

I love your work, I know it from the start.

HARRY

Thank you.

RAY

I have seen all of Mateo Blanco's films, including the

last one, "Girls and Suitcases".

HARRY

Is that so? You must be the only one.

RAY

What happened to Mateo Blanco?

HARRY

47

Why do you ask?

RAY

Because he vanished from public life...

HARRY

It would seem that way.

RAY

Almost as if he'd died.

HARRY

Yes . . . (Ironically) I lost track of him some time ago.

RAY

I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film.

HARRY

Whose?

RAY

Mateo Blanco's. The first five are stupendous. You

were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you

explain that the last one was a disaster?

HARRY

(Made uncomfortable by the topic) Films turn out well

or badly. The reason is always a mystery. (Mateo

switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for

comedy). But tell me about the story you want to

write.

48

RAY

... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge,

one against the memory of his father.

HARRY

Why does the son desire revenge?

RAY

(Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his

life, practically nullifying him while he lived. The

father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic,

very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone

has a price and that's how he behaves with people. I

don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting

someone like this...

HARRY

When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are

you referring to?

RAY X

Economic, with everything that entails. He is a

broker, of the generation of speculators that made

quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a

great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is

sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations,

and lives under his shadow, trying to please the

father in everything. Despite being a bit...

homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the

father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a

49

son that hates him just as much as he hates his own

father. When the father dies, the son is finally able

to rebuild his life. That is his salvation and his

revenge.

HARRY

I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are

looking for.

RAY X

You are, you don't know how much!

RAY X

I will pay whatever you ask.

HARRY

It's too personal.

RAY X

Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic, rather,

I think of it as a base from which to develop a

fiction.

HARRY

Thanks, but no. (He rises) And now, if you don't mind...

50

RAY X

There you have my phone number, if you change your mind.

RAY X

I am sure we will see each other again.

HARRY

In my case, that would be a miracle.

HARRY

Did you overhear that?

DIEGO

Yes... I'm flipping out! Why did he ask you if Mateo

had died?

HARRY

51

To provoke me... I don't know... Help me find

something... (he points toward the drawers at the

bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to

open one of them) Look inside that drawer.

HARRY

Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of

the photographs must have the date on it.

DIEGO

I think this is him...

HARRY

Who?

DIEGO

The man who just left.

HARRY

52

(Rising) Describe the picture to me.

DIEGO

It's from the shoot. (He looks at the box from where

he's taken it). He is carrying a small camera, like a

Super 8.

HARRY

It's a 16mm. Are you sure it's him?

DIEGO

He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him. He

is talking to you.

HARRY

What am I saying?

DIEGO

I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks

like a pack of cigarettes.

HARRY

It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it

and I am refusing it.

DIEGO

Who is he?

HARRY

Ernesto Martel's son.

HARRY

(Serious and pensive) You can put them away now...

53

54

ERNESTO S.

I can't talk now, Rosanna.

OFF

It's about your son. I have caught him trying on my

dresses. And it's not the first time...

ERNESTO S.

It's your fault, you made him effeminate to humiliate me!

OFF

That's not the problem, the boy is very depressed,

I've had to take him to a psychiatrist.

ERNESTO S.

Don't call him "boy". He is already seventeen.

OFF

The doctor has told me he is in need of a father

figure... I think I am going to send him your way so

that he can spend some time with you, after all you

are his father.

ERNESTO

If I haven't been a good father in eighteen years, I

don't think I can learn to be one precisely now.

OFF

How can you speak like that! Have you no feelings?

ERNESTO

(Looks at Lena, intently) I have them. Very deep

feelings, they just don't include either of you.

55

OFF

If anything happens to him, you'll know who's at fault.

ERNESTO

Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna. Tell Ernesto that if

he wants to talk to me he should call me himself.

LENA

(In reprimand) Don't be so harsh with them, Ernesto!

ERNESTO

Blackmailers!

LENA

Why don't you invite your son to spend a few days here?

ERNESTO

It'd be better if you didn't get involved with them,

Lena.

Ernesto takes a sip from his drink.

56

LENA

He can keep me company... Does he like movies or theater?

ERNESTO

I don't know. But the mother has told me he is a bit

faggot. If I ask him to come I would like for you to

tell me if that's true... and whether you think there's

any remedy...

LENA

And how would I know?! What an idea!

ERNESTO

I am not asking you to fuck him, but you good-looking

girls can tell these things.

LENA

Call him, but you can't count on me for the rest.

57

OFF EX-WIFE

I am not reproaching you for our separation but that

you live with a man... What will your children think!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

(On the phone) That their father is a homosexual (he

gazes at his handsome boyfriend) and that he has very

good taste. If they love me and you don't set them

against me, they will accept it.

OFF EX-WIFE

You should have told me before we married!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

If you hadn't been so exclusively concerned with my

father's fortune you might have noticed it yourself.

ERNESTO JUNIOR

I have to go, I have another call.

ERNESTO J.'s LOVER

Will it be your other ex-wife?

58

ERNESTO JUNIOR

I hope not. (Into the headset) Yes?

JUDIT

(Dryly) It's Judit Garcia.

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Oh, hello, Judit. (In an amiable tone) Did you get the

money?

JUDIT

I don't want it! I just sent it back, Ernesto!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

You won't call me Ray? It's my artistic name...

JUDIT

Artistic? What are you up to?

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Hoping to erase my father's name.

JUDIT

And what does that have to do with Harry?

ERNESTO JUNIOR

I've been wanting to see him for a long time. And

it's true that I want to shoot a movie and that I want

him to write the script. (Looks at the boyfriend) I've

got the protagonist.

JUDIT

You are not a director!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

You should take a look at my documentary, you'd change

your mind.

59

JUDIT

Ernesto, forget about us!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Don't be afraid of me. I am not my father.

JUDIT

Do not come near Harry again. If you ever stop by his

house again I will report you for harassment.

JUDIT

I am not at all pleased with having to scout outside

Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need

money.

60

DIEGO

You can leave without concerns. Don't worry about me.

JUDIT

I am also worried for Harry. (Sounds more like an

order than a request) Please, look after him during

my absence...

DIEGO

(Protests) I have things to do, mom. I can't look

after him all day.

JUDIT

It's only two weeks!

DIEGO

Harry manages perfectly on his own and right now we

are not writing anything.

JUDIT

I am worried about Ernesto Junior's visit. I would

like for you to be on guard in case he appears or

calls and then let me know immediately!

DIEGO

Why are you so worried?

JUDIT

He's crazy. I don't trust him.

DIEGO

Why?

JUDIT

61

(Evasive) It's a long story.

DIEGO

(Persistent) Summarize it!

JUDIT

Diego, please, this is not the moment.

DIEGO

It never is for you!

JUDIT

(Exasperated) Hey, if it bothers you so much to look

after Harry, I'll quit the job and stay in Madrid! Or

I'll hire someone.

DIEGO

It doesn't bother me to look after Harry! But I am

tired of so much secrecy!

DIEGO

Don't go so fast!

HARRY

62

We are exercising...

DIEGO

I'm not. I'm just keeping you company. How can you

walk so fast?

HARRY

I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug

myself.

DIEGO

(On guard) What do you mean by that?

HARRY

That I take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an

older, handicapped person.

DIEGO

You are no fanatic.

HARRY

Yes, I am. All of us who survive a critical physical

injury are. There is no other way.

HARRY

63

What are you looking at?

DIEGO

A billboard.

HARRY

Why so?

DIEGO

In huge letters it says "Donate Blood", it includes

where one has to go.

HARRY

You want to donate blood?

DIEGO

No, no... I was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good

title for a movie...

HARRY

Yes. It has a good ring.

DIEGO

For a vampire flick.

HARRY

It's true.

DIEGO

(Ironizing, kidding, improvising) Imagine that behind

the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in

ambulatory care are hiding... and they actually keep the

blood they get from donors for their own consumption,

of course...

HARRY

Your mother would like that story.

64

DIEGO

The vampires would be like a type of ethnic group,

completely assimilated into Spanish society, they

don't stand out. There are vampires who occupy

important positions, keeping it a secret (like the

Opus Dei). But even though they live in the shadows,

they have amassed great social and economic power...

HARRY

They control various industries. For example, the one

responsible for dark sunglasses...

DIEGO

(Smiles) And those that provide nightly entertainment:

bars, discos, after-hours... Since they don't need drugs

to stay awake, they are the most apt for working at

night. They don't burn out...

HARRY

65

And for the sunscreen business. The poor things are

very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in

the ozone layer. Their sunscreens are some of the

best on the market.

DIEGO

(Laughs) And those which sell best... This is all great...

HARRY

Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day...

The lotion must be as dense as armour.

DIEGO

(More inspired) This is how the story could begin:

(describes) A gorgeous woman, totally naked, rubbing

her body with a super-dense lotion, before heading to

work at an ambulatory hospital. Her body is a velvety

pale, beautiful...

HARRY

(Continues) What a great opening! We also need a love

story...

DIEGO

A hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a

normal guy.

HARRY

Like in "Cat People", a love story between beings of

different species...

DIEGO

She works at one of those labs where blood is donated

and where they snatch it for themselves. The guy has

gone to donate his, or to get some tests. They like

HARRY

DIEGO

67

No, no sucking. She would tear it on the first bite.

HARRY

And how does he react? A man may do without kissing,

but it's very rough not to have your cock sucked.

DIEGO

Since he is deeply in love, he accepts the situation

(or gives up to it). Once they are more comfortable

with each other, she wears a muzzle, as security for

both. Because when she's turned on, she has a type of

dental erection, her face grows into something like

that of a she-wolf...

HARRY

I like your story very much, Diego.

DIEGO

Our story.

HARRY

No. This one was your idea, and you'll author it.

I'll be your sparring partner, for all the times

you've done the same for me...

68

DIEGO

(Without acrimony) Stop fondling me... damn it!

ALEX

It's the GHB. It kicks your ass.

ALEX

Do you want a little bit of "X"? (referring to

"MDMA", aka Ecstasy)

DIEGO

Just a tip. (He licks his finger and sticks its moist

tip into the bag that Alex offers him, he takes his

finger to his mouth) Tomorrow I have to work, we are

writing a vampire script that's going to be the shit!

DIEGO

Stop already, you are going to go through the roof.

69

ALEX

Holy shit, he's taken a drink from your glass! Why in

the world did you get Coca-cola! Didn't you notice he

was drinking a jack and coke?

FRIEND A

I didn't realize!

ALEX

(Very alarmed) He's unconscious!

ALEX

No. I'm a friend. Diego just... he's not well. We

are taking him into the emergency room...

HARRY

70

Emergency? Can I talk to him?

ALEX

No... because...

HARRY

What hospital are you taking him to?

ALEX

Who are you?

HARRY

(Improvising) ...His uncle. I am on my way.

HARRY

(Anxious) I am here to see Diego Garcia. He's just been

admitted.

71

HARRY

I am here to see Diego Garcia.

DOCTOR

Are you immediate family?

HARRY

(Improvises) Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.

DOCTOR

Your nephew is at the ICU, he arrived in a coma...

HARRY

In a coma?

DOCTOR

Yes...

HARRY

But, what has happened?!

DOCTOR

He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol... it is a lethal

combination. His friend informed us it was a mistake...

(It happens sometimes, kids grab the wrong glass...)

HARRY

My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy...

72

DOCTOR

Barring any complications, he will recover in six to

twelve hours.

HARRY

If that's the case, I'll wait...

DOCTOR

Go home, we will call you...

HARRY

I'd rather wait.

DOCTOR

Are you certain?

HARRY

Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit, please...

DOCTOR

Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone

number?

HARRY

He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is

working outside Madrid... I would prefer to call her

myself... I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly

in a grave condition...

DOCTOR

Normally, he should recuperate in a few hours... but,

in any case, you should have a talk with him, once

he's better...

HARRY

Yes, of course...

73

HARRY

How are you?

DIEGO

I don't know... dazed. Did you speak with my mother?

HARRY

74

Yes, I told her it was something you ate...

DIEGO

And she believed it?

HARRY

I don't know. She wanted to hurry back, but I

convinced her to continue with the location scouting.

At some point you'll have to call her.

HARRY

Are you asleep?

DIEGO

I'm not sleepy anymore.

HARRY

Do you want to talk?

DIEGO

No...

HARRY

Would you like me to speak?

DIEGO

I don't know. If you'd like...

HARRY

I say so in order to distract you. When I was young,

before I got into making movies, I was very good at

telling stories.

DIEGO

(Not sure) Well, then... would you mind telling me why

my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?

HARRY

She's afraid of him?

75

DIEGO

Before she left, she made me promise that I would

remain alert, in case he reappeared...

HARRY

She didn't explain why?

DIEGO

She never explains anything.

HARRY

It's a long story...

DIEGO

Judit says the same thing. How did you meet him?

HARRY

We met him... In an office we had rented in preparation

for my new film, about fourteen years ago.

76

OFF HARRY

...After having written five dramas, I had finally

managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what

I thought. I wanted to change genres... to take a risk

(ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,

the part about taking a risk.

JUDIT

77

A girl has stopped by. She doesn't have an appointment,

so there is no reason for you to see her...

MATEO

(Without much interest) What's she like?

JUDIT

Too beautiful to be funny.

MATEO

(Smiles) Really?

JUDIT

She is Ernesto Martel's lover, the tycoon. She is

here with his son.

MATEO

And she's an actress?

JUDIT

(Ironic) Her? If she's been with him for three years,

she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be

polite. One must get along well with important men.

You never know.

78

LENA

I am sorry we showed up like this, but I've heard you

are running auditions... and I would like for you to

give me a try out.

79

LENA

I can come whatever day is convenient.

MATEO

You're already here. Let's read something.

OFF HARRY

The reading didn't work out. We were both too nervous.

The first meeting and the reading we did only served

to make me realize that woman's very presence

perturbed me.

80

ERNESTO SENIOR

Where have you been this morning?

LENA

Ernesto hasn't told you?

ERNESTO SENIOR

I haven't asked him.

LENA

(She hates having to account for herself.) I went to

see a film director.

ERNESTO S.

What for!

LENA

(Dryly) For an audition.

81

ERNESTO S.

An audition? How so?

LENA

(With less determination than she would like, but

enough to alarm Ernesto Senior) I want to work.

ERNESTO S.

Weren't you going to study interior design? Weren't

you going to redecorate the house? I thought we

agreed that you would transform what's left of my two

shipwrecked marriages into something more our own...

LENA

Call a decorator... I want to be an actress. I've

always wanted to.

ERNESTO S.

You've already attempted it once... and look how you've

ended up.

LENA

(Affected) That's a cheap shot.

ERNESTO S.

(First, he attacks. Then, he is sorry. Loike any

violent lover) I am sorry, forgive me.

LENA

82

Excuse me, I am retiring to my room.

LENA

In any case, don't worry. It didn't turn out well. I

was too nervous.

LENA

(Yells) Come in!

LENA

(Enthusiastically) That's the film director. He says

the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me

once more!

83

ERNESTO S.

What are you going to do?

LENA

Go see him, no?!

LENA

Please, Ernesto. I need to do something! And I've

always wanted to be an actress!

ERNESTO S.

And what will become of me?

LENA

They have not given me the role yet.

ERNESTO S.

They will...!

LENA

Well, if I were to get it, we would still see each

other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and

evenings. Nothing will change, except that during the

day I would work, just like you.

ERNESTO S.

Why don't we get married?

LENA

(Taken by surprise) What?

ERNESTO S.

I am asking you to marry me...

LENA

Don't you think you've married and divorced enough

times already?

ERNESTO S.

84

With you it'd be the first.

LENA

We've been living together for three years, aren't we

fine like this?

ERNESTO S.

(Somber) It doesn't seem you are.

HARRY

Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie. Your

mother didn't want him to. She was waiting for a

subsidy from the Ministry and an advance sale to

television, but that would take months and I was

suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting.

85

OFF HARRY

I enjoyed making her up, styling her and dressing

her. Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of "The

Apartment" and the Audrey Hepburn of "Breakfast at

Tiffany's", or even Goldie Hawn...

86

OFF HARRY

Your mother didn't like Lena.

OFF HARRY

I, on the other hand, liked her a lot, and she liked

me.

OFF HARRY

Ernesto Junior also liked me...

OFF HARRY

I was hoping to use him for my own ends. His father

had asked him to make a documentary about the

shooting...

87

CONTINUED OFF HARRY

As far as Ernesto Senior was concerned, (we observe

him watching the projection uncomfortably) I've never

known a man more obsessed with a woman, except myself.

He was producing the film out of a desperate attempt

to not lose Lena. In the middle of this emotional

quagmire, we began shooting... Your mother was present

at every instant, her face like a sergeant's.

88

89

90

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Are you going to work on something?

MATEO

No. You may go.

ERNESTO J.

I don't mind staying.

MATEO

It's best if you leave. I am going to try out some wigs.

ERNESTO J.

91

Wigs? I love wigs!

MATEO

(Categorically) No! You don't love them! You already

have many hours shot of wigs. This is more of the

same.

ERNESTO J.

And Lena?

MATEO

After she tries on the new wigs, she's asked for a

massage therapist, she has a spasm...

ERNESTO J.

Spasms... I don't have footage of spasms... Couldn't I

shoot that?

MATEO

Ernesto, stop being a pest and leave already! See you

tomorrow!

92

MATEO

(To Edurne) I am going to speak to Magdalena... Do you

mind being on the lookout? Don't let anyone interrupt

us.

LENA

Is Junior around?

MATEO

No. I sent him home. There's only Edurne, on watch...

93

LENA

This is madness, Mateo. I am no good for you.

MATEO

You should have warned me sooner.

ERNESTO S.

(Ironic) I didn't know one worked so hard in the movies.

LENA

(Smiles) Well, yes, especially if you're a girl.

ERNESTO S.

94

Why if you're a girl?

LENA

Because you must put on makeup (and then remove it),

dress up, do your hair. Get dressed again, do your

hair again. And that takes hours.

ERNESTO S.

And you're not tired?

LENA

At the end of the week, sure, but I'm happy...

ERNESTO S.

I was thinking we should take a break, a weekend.

Just the two of us, alone. At the house in Ibiza, or

in Paris... wherever you want... you and I.

LENA

I can't travel until the shoot is over...

ERNESTO S.

I am talking about just a weekend.

LENA

We rehearse on weekends.

ERNESTO S.

Don't you also rehearse during the shooting?

LENA

Yes.

ERNESTO S.

What's going on, you spend all day rehearsing!

LENA

(Without losing her cool) That's how one makes a

movie! (thinking, "you moron!", but she doesn't say

it).

95

ERNESTO S.

And everyone else's life? It can't be set aside for

months!

LENA

The movie is boss.

ERNESTO S.

Excuse me, I'm the producer, so I'm the boss.

MATEO

You look awful...

JUDIT

Little Diego... he could hardly breathe all night...

neither of us has slept a wink.

MATEO

(Worried) You still don't know what it is?

JUDIT

96

Some doctors say it's asthma, others that it's

allergies, but we don't know to what... They are still

running tests, but it's driving me to the brink...

MATEO

Take all the time you need... Even if we're shooting,

your son is more important.

JUDIT

Thanks. (Changing subjects) One more thing, I've

talked to the producer.

MATEO

And?

JUDIT

He complains that the shooting is monopolizing Lena.

MATEO

(Exasperated and condescending) And how does he think

one makes movies?

JUDIT

Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist.

MATEO

Then he shouldn't have signed up as a producer, no one

asked him...

JUDIT

I warned you! Ernesto Martel doesn't give a crap

about this movie and those of us making it, except for

one person! This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza

with him, so you won't be able to rehearse.

MATEO

Son of a bitch!

97

98

ERNESTO S.

Have you put on makeup?

LENA

(Animated, without exaggeration. A well-faked

serenity) I want you to find me pretty.

ERNESTO S.

To me, you always are! It's impossible that you

wouldn't be pretty.

LENA

Would you like a cigarette?

ERNESTO S.

No... thanks.

LENA

Do you know how many fucks we've had since we arrived

yesterday?

ERNESTO S.

(Smiles, like a champ) Six?

LENA

(Also smiles) Ten.

ERNESTO S.

With honours, yes?

99

LENA

Yes, I suppose so.

ERNESTO S.

We have to take advantage of our time. We only have

one more day left.

CHUS

100

Look at what I've found on the sidewalk, they fell

from your terrace.

PINA

They are gifts from Mr. Ivan and I tossed them out.

He told me to keep them, but I don't want them!

CHUS

But you can't do that, Ms. Pina. You could have

killed somebody... You can't just throw things off the

terrace, much less if they are metal...

PINA

In Naples, on New Year's Eve, they even throw out

furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan... I carry it

in my blood.

CHUS

But this is not Naples, nor is today New Year's Eve...

PINA

I was anxious and throwing things relaxes me... Keep

them if you like.

CHUS

Thanks so much, Ms. Pina. But that's not right...

CHUS

It's not alright, Ms. Pina.

101

MATEO

(Serious) Your tone is off, Magdalena.

LENA

(Very depressed) I know.

MATEO

(In a very low voice) What's wrong?

LENA

(Whispers, on the brink of tears) I'll tell you later.

ASSISTANT

We break for thirty minutes, it's snack time!

102

MATEO

(With urgency) What's happened?

LENA

I've had a horrible weekend...

MATEO

But... we haven't rehearsed, so that you could rest!

LENA

Rest? I haven't slept a wink all weekend... (Sighs, on

the brink of tears) It's been a nightmare!

LENA

I have literally had Ernesto on top of me, all those

forty-eight hours, like a leech! (repulsed

expression) He has not given me a second to breathe,

the asshole!

103

ERNESTO JUNIOR

104

My father asks me why it is that I don't go with you

to yoga, he asks me all the time.

LENA

Well, you tell him that I am a grown-up now, and free,

and that I've forbidden you to follow me.

ERNESTO JUNIOR

You know I can't tell him that.

LENA

Try it. It would do you good.

ERNESTO JUNIOR

I can't.

LENA

Do as you wish, but you're not coming with me.

105

ERNESTO SENIOR

(Quotidian and tranquil, an unexpected demeanor for a

character of his temperament) How are you?

LENA

Good, tired.

ERNESTO SENIOR

And relaxed.

LENA

(On guard) Yes...

ERNESTO SENIOR

The yoga is doing you good, isn't it?

LENA

Yes, especially after work...

ERNESTO SENIOR

I am going to snack on something. Will you join me?

LENA

I am not hungry, I'd rather go to bed right now. I'll

only have a yogurt.

106

LENA

Ernesto, what are you doing here?

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Working.

107

LENA

Turn that off, you idiot! Hasn't Mateo forbidden you

to tape us outside the shooting?

ERNESTO JUNIOR

My father has told me not to listen to him... he wants

to see everything.

LENA

You both have no scruples!

ERNESTO JUNIOR

Remember I am taping you.

LENA

(In a barrage) Listen carefully, Ernesto. Yes, I am

talking to you. (She points toward Mateo's house) I

was just with the man I love and I am the happiest

I've been all my life because he loves me too!

(screams) And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let

108

you be very soon! There is no need to spy on me.

There is nothing left to hide!

109

LENA

I was just with the man I love and I am the happiest

that I've been all my life because he loves me too!

And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let you be very

soon! There is no need to spy on me. I don't have

anything left to hide!

110

LENA

(Suitcase in hand) I am leaving, Ernesto. I am leaving

you.

ERNESTO SENIOR

(Cold, drunk, contemptuous) You are not going anywhere.

LENA

And how will you stop me?

ERNESTO S.

(Pleading) Lena, please.

111

112

113

ERNESTO SENIOR

We have to get to the hospital. My wife is badly hurt...

POLICEMAN

What's happened?

ERNESTO

I was in the living room and, since we weren't

planning to go out, I started drinking early. I am

pretty drunk, as you may notice. Suddenly, I heard a

thump, I ran to the stairs and there she was. She

tripped and fell down the stairs...

POLICEMAN

Is this true, Madam?

LENA

Yes... Can't you leave the paperwork for later?

POLICEMAN

Your husband can't drive in this condition!

ERNESTO SENIOR

What do you mean?

114

POLICEMAN

You're crazy!

LENA

Please!

POLICEMAN

Get out of there! I will drive!

ERNESTO S.

Absolutely not!

POLICEMAN

You either let me drive or we all stay here until the

ambulance arrives!

LENA

(To Ernesto) Stop it, Ernesto! Let him drive!

POLICEMAN

(To Ernesto, paternalistic and contemptuous) Get down

and sit in the back, with your wife!

ERNESTO S.

(Threatening) If anything happens (referring to Lena),

you better be ready... You have no idea who I am!

POLICEMAN

115

I will pretend that I didn't hear you. I will also

pretend I noticed neither how drunk you are nor your

affronts to authority, Mr. Martel.

ERNESTO S.

Are you all right?

LENA

(Screams) No! (to the policeman) And could we get (the

fuck) going?!

116

ERNESTO

You really can't wait?

LENA

(Defiant) No.

LENA

Hello, Mateo?

OFF MATEO

117

What's going on? Are you not coming?

LENA

Not tonight.

OFF MATEO

Has something happened?

LENA

Something unexpected has happened, but don't worry,

everything's OK.

OFF MATEO

Tomorrow the shooting begins in the afternoon, will I

see you before then?

LENA

I won't be able to. I will see you directly at the

studio. I have something to do.

OFF MATEO

(Worried) You're acting strange, Magdalena. Are you

sure nothing's wrong?

LENA

Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

118

ERNESTO SENIOR

(Begs, sincerely) What would you like me to do? What

can I do so that you will forgive me?

LENA

(Seriously) Take me to the studio.

ERNESTO SENIOR

You shouldn't move.

LENA

If you don't take me, I'll go there myself, even if I

have to drag myself.

119

ERNESTO SENIOR

And what will you say? how will you explain the cast

on your leg and the bruises?

LENA

It's up to you.

ERNESTO SENIOR

To me? I will do whatever you ask, as long as you

promise you'll stay with me.

LENA

I will stay, under the condition that you let Mateo

finish the shooting, according to what he decides.

ERNESTO SENIOR

He will barrage you with questions, that guy's not

stupid.

LENA

I will tell him I tripped.

ERNESTO SENIOR

And how will you shoot, if you can't walk?

LENA

I don't know. Whatever Mateo decides, but I want to

rest assured that you will respect his decision, no

matter the cost nor the time that it will take. Is

that clear?

120

121

LENA

... And that's it.

LENA

Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide.

MATEO

(Containing his rage) Decide, what?! I can't move

from one shot where you are walking normally to

another one where you are wearing a cast! How long

must you wear the cast?

LENA

Three weeks.

JUDIT

(To Ernesto Senior) Can we stop for those three

weeks? With pay for the team, of course.

ERNESTO S.

If there is no other option!

MATEO

(A bit agitated) I hate stopping! Movies, when you

pick them back up, are no longer the same!

122

MATEO

(Dryly) Do you mind if I speak to Lena alone for a

moment?

123

LENA

Be careful, he may walk in.

MATEO

Let him walk in!

MATEO

Tell me the truth! People don't fall down the stairs,

that only happens in movies.

LENA

Mateo, we must finish the shooting as soon as

possible! Until then, I cannot leave Ernesto.

MATEO

Why not? He's a psychopath! What more proof do you

need?

LENA

I cannot leave, I've made a deal with him.

MATEO

A deal? What deal?

LENA

124

MATEO

LENA

MATEO

LENA

MATEO

LENA

MATEO

LENA

MATEO

LENA

MATEO

LENA

125

(Angst-ridden) I don't know... but the sooner you

finish shooting, the better! Come up with a reason

not to pause!

MATEO

(Unenthusiastic) We would have to repeat part of the

stairway scene...

126

PINA

(Indignant) Leave that note there! It's not for you.

How dare you take it and crumple it?

JULIETA

What do you have to speak to Ivan about, you whore!

PINA

It's none of your business.

JULIETA

I am his wife.

PINA

His wife has been admitted at a psychiatric hospital

for twenty years now.

JULIETA

Not anymore.

127

JULIETA

(Repeats) I am no longer committed. I am now here

with you. Walking down the stairs.

JULIETA

You are in a hurry to see him, aren't you?

PINA

Yes...

JULIETA

Well, what are you waiting for!

128

129

PINA

(Whispers) What a drag! (she opens the door, in a

languid, bored tone) Oh, it's you?

CHON

(Reproaches, depressed) I've left you a thousand

messages!

PINA

Yes...

CHON

And this suitcase?!

PINA

(Sounding bored, asleep) It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

130

CHON

And that broken leg?

PINA

His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the

stairs . . .

CHON

I see, we're in great shape...

MATEO

(Interrupts the take) Cut!

131

WAREHOUSE, SHABBY STUDIO. AWAY FROM THE LOFT. AT THE

LENA

(Distressed, maybe she'll cry) I am sorry...

MATEO

Don't worry, it will turn out. (Acknowledges) But I

don't know what more direction to give you.

LENA

(Exhausted, hard on herself) You have told me

everything, in every way possible...

132

MATEO

(Somber and guilty) Ernesto is getting just what he

hoped. That we make a piece of crap of a movie! I

told you not to agree to that deal...

LENA

We can't let him have his way! (She dries her tears,

feeling newly replenished) Every day I arrive worn

out and every day I recover, right?

MATEO

(Acknowledges) Yes...

LENA

I ask you only for a bit more patience... And a kiss!

PINA

133

(Whispers) What a drag! (contemptuous, she greets

her) Oh, it's you?

CHON

Listen, if that's how you'll greet me, I'll leave.

PINA

No, c'mon! Come inside!

MATEO

She's so much better! Grab this one!

LUIS

Yes.

134

MATEO

Let's look at fourteen, it's even better!

OFF HARRY

When we finished shooting, I quickly selected all the

takes for the film so that I could rescue Lena as soon

as possible from the Martel house. The situation had

135

worsened, we could hardly see each other, he had

practically kidnapped her... They were difficult days for

everyone, but Lena insisted that I leave all the takes

selected... then, we could leave.

OFF

It's Magdalena.

MATEO

Is there something wrong?

OFF

No. I'm downstairs. I've forgotten my money. I have

to pay the cab . . .

MATEO

I'll be right down.

136

MATEO

(Horrified) But . . . what has happened?!

LENA

We have had a brutal fight... At the end, he ripped my

clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto

the highway. The jacket belongs to the cab driver.

You must give him a good tip, if it weren't for him I

don't know how I would have made it here...

MATEO

(To the cab driver) Take us to the nearest police

station...

137

LENA

No, please...

MATEO

We must denounce him, Magdalena!

LENA

He will turn against you!

LENA

No, not your house.

MATEO

We have to look after you. Let's go to a hotel...

LENA

(Pleads) Let's leave Madrid.

138

139

MATEO

Look. It's us. (I thought it was empty)

140

142

HARRY

Do you want to go back home and return to the "Donate

Blood" story?

DIEGO

I am hoping to get back to it, but first tell me what

happened in Lanzarote. You can't leave me hanging!

HARRY

Without realizing, a month had elapsed... I knew that

sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept

postponing it. I was only worried about you and your

mother. I had not even said goodbye and you were still

suffering from your allergy problem when we left... I can

imagine Judit was furious with me.

DIEGO

You can't imagine how much.

HARRY

I was planning to return soon to finish the editing...

and to explain things to your mother. But Magdalena

decided she'd wait for me on the island. She couldn't

stand the thought of seeing Ernesto again.

143

LENA

Sorry to interrupt... I wanted to ask if there are any

employment opportunities available here, with you... You

always look so busy... I have a lot of free time...

EMPLOYEE

We could use the help, especially now that the high

season is about to start... Do you have experience?

LENA

I have worked as a secretary at M. Capital, a very

important finance company.

EMPLOYEE

(Looks at her) You could first work during the

afternoons and, then, we could see...

144

EMPLOYEE

We were just saying that the girl in the ad looks like

you.

LENA

(To the employee) No. It's not me.

MATEO

I was wondering how long it would take him to emerge!

145

LENA

(Disoriented) But they can't release the film so

soon, right?

MATEO

No. It's a scheme to annoy us, and a trap to get you

to return. The ad is only lacking the words "Missing."

LENA

What are we going to do?

MATEO

Nothing. Fuck them!

146

MATEO

(Disconsolate) What does it say?

LENA

That the only intelligent thing we have done has been

not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic,

that you seem like a first-time director and that you

lack talent. At the end, it wonders who might have

made your first films. Never before has such a

resounding downfall been witnessed... How horrible!

LENA

What are you going to do?

147

MATEO

(Dryly) Judit. It's me. I hope you and the boy are

OK. I apologize that I left without notice, but

terrible things have happened, I will explain.

Speaking of which, I need to talk to you, urgently.

Please call me! Here's the number... (Asks one of the

employees) Oh, and, ask for Harry Caine, I have

registered under that name... (said almost as an order)

I will be waiting for your call!

MATEO

Luis, I just read in the newspaper that the film has

opened and I am beside myself!! I don't know what the

fuck is going on there, but I would like to know! OK,

I'll ring back!

148

DIEGO

And mom, did she call you back?

HARRY

No.

DIEGO

(Can't understand, he's almost indignant) Why?

HARRY

She was pissed, I suppose.

DIEGO

I remember that time, it was while I was undergoing

treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis. It was a

horrible time for me... Not just because of the illness,

my mother was like a crazy woman... I had just seen "The

Exorcist" and, for some time, I believed she was

possessed...

HARRY

(Smiles pathetically) I was the demon, Diego. And I

am sorry. I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not

sure I had a choice...

DIEGO

149

(Emotionally exhausted) No matter how upset she was,

she should have alerted you to what was happening.

HARRY

The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of

it. Neither one of us has broached the topic.

DIEGO

(Surprised) And you weren't curious?...

HARRY

(Emphatically) Me? Curiosity was killing me! For

two days I called both your mother and Luis non-stop,

the editor (says it agitated), but neither of them

answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next

day so that I could witness what was happening for

myself!

MATEO

How did you meet Ernesto Senior?

LENA

150

(It's not a topic she likes, but she doesn't hesitate

to answer.) I was one of his secretaries.

MATEO

And... how did you end up with him? You fell in love?

LENA

He was very generous with me and my family. My father

was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital

and Ernesto took care of everything... He paid for

everything... And he made sure that my parents could

return to their home town and that they lacked nothing...

MATEO

(Lovingly) Pardon me, I have no right to ask you about

that time in your life.

LENA

It's only natural that you would want to know. And I

don't want any skeletons between us. (Unguarded) I

would like to be able to forget all that, but you have

the right to ask.

MATEO

(Assuring her) No. I do not have any right. For me,

you were born the day you came for the audition. You

looked at me, I saw your face and... I was left

hypnotized.

151

LENA

I remember your face perfectly. I think I fell in

love with the way you looked at me. I thought: this

man will be my salvation.

LENA

(Childish) It's the first time we part...

MATEO

(Pampering) Either way, I will return next weekend.

But if you are going to be worried, you should come

with me.

LENA

No... I will be better off here.

152

MATEO

(Very insecure) And did I manage to save you from

anything?

LENA

(Enigmatic and unwavering) Yes!

153

OFF HARRY

154

Magdalena's death didn't catch us melded in an embrace,

but sitting on separate seats. It caught me by

surprise, in that of leaving me alive.

JUDIT

Mateo, say something!

HARRY

Mateo is dead, Judit.

JUDIT

(Bags under her eyes and tearful) Don't say that!

155

PSYCHIATRIST

We call him by his name, but he doesn't respond to it.

He insists Mateo has died.

JUDIT

Images are the source of his work... and to live in the

dark, I suppose that's death to him... Is there any

chance he will see?

DOCTOR

None. His is what we refer to as a cortical

blindness, and it's irreversible. It's the result of

a lesion to the occipital lobe, the intelligent part

of the brain, which has the role of processing all

visual information. In other words, the neurons have

died... and that's permanent...

OFF HARRY

I felt as though I had died with Lena. The Mateo-

film-director who had left Madrid would never return.

156

MATEO

Did you visit Lena's mother at her hometown?

JUDIT

Yes.

MATEO

What did she say?

JUDIT

She was very thankful to Ernesto for having taken care

of everything...

MATEO

157

That's it?

JUDIT

Yes, they buried her next to her father.

MATEO

Did you visit the grave?

JUDIT

Yes.

JUDIT

What's wrong?

MATEO

158

(Weakened) You go... I can't... I'll wait for you on the beach.

DIEGUITO

I also want to go to the beach!

MATEO

Do whatever you need to do. We'll wait for you there.

JUDIT

Bundle up! And don't get too close to the water. (To

little Diego) Don't let go of his hand!

159

JUDIT

I am here to pay Mateo Blanco's bill.

EMPLOYEE

We don't have anyone here registered by that name.

JUDIT

It's the man who had the accident. He was in bungalow

number two.

EMPLOYEE

Oh, you mean Harry Caine.

JUDIT

Yes, of course.

EMPLOYEE

Poor souls! They are not the first to have an

accident on that traffic circle! Awful!

160

DIEGUITO

Look... There are kites!

161

162

JUDIT

Harry! Harry Caine!

HARRY

We're here, Judit! (And raises his hand like a child)

JUDIT

We have to go, Harry.

HARRY

(To the boy) Let's go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.

DIEGUITO

(Protests, politely) Can't we stay a little longer?

HARRY

No. We must obey your mother... You've had enough wind

for one day...

DIEGUITO

But I'm already all better!

163

164

HARRY

Play "Elevator to the Gallows" and take a look at the

ending...

DIEGO

Do you always watch the same movies?

HARRY

Yes. Since I know them by heart, I can visualize the

action.

DIEGO

Is there any new movie you'd want to see...?

HARRY

Yes. But you'd have to describe the action. Your

mother used to describe some to me, some time ago.

DIEGO

I wouldn't mind doing so.

HARRY

I would like to "watch" one by Tarantino or Scorsese,

and also some Asian cinema...

DIEGO

Done.

165

PINA

What a drag! (she opens, not very welcoming) Oh, it's

you?

HARRY

That's "Girls and Suitcases"!

DIEGO

166

Yes.

HARRY

Turn up the volume!

CHON

(Reproachful) I've left you a thousand messages.

PINA

Yes. A thousand from you, and none from Ivan.

167

CHON

(Sees the suitcase sitting in the middle of the loft.

Looks at it as if it were some strange insect.) And

this suitcase?

PINA

It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

CHON

And the cast on your leg?

PINA

His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the

stairs and I broke my leg...

CHON

Wow! Well, we're in good shape... I also broke up with

my husband...

168

HARRY

(Annoyed) They're terrible!

HARRY

How could I have thought these takes were the good

ones! What was I thinking!

169

HARRY

May I come in?

DIEGO

(Drying himself) Yes, come in!

HARRY

Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago. At

that time I didn't even bother to open it, I didn't

want to know anything about him. I am now thinking

170

that perhaps he had something to tell me. Would you

mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there

is something else written?

DIEGO

At the end he says this is my new number, a number's

written down.

HARRY

Call him, please!

DIEGO

Right now? It's too early.

HARRY

It doesn't matter.

DIEGO

May I get dressed? I'm naked...

HARRY

Oh, I'm sorry.

171

HARRY

(On the phone) Could I speak to Luis, please?

WOMAN'S VOICE

(Surprised) Luis died six years ago!

HARRY

Oh, I am so sorry... I had no idea!

VOICE

It was cancer. I'm his widow. Who are you?

HARRY

Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films...

VOICE

(More serene) Mateo Blanco! Luis spoke to me about

you. I am his second wife...

HARRY

The one I know is Nieves, the first one.

VOICE

We married twelve years ago.

HARRY

(Sincere and sorrowful) I am sorry to hear about Luis'

death. I would have liked to speak to him...

VOICE

He would have liked so too! Once he was quite ill and

didn't want to speak to anyone, he would always tell

me that, if it was you, I should hand him the phone...

172

HARRY

You have no idea how sorry I am!

DIEGO

What's going on?

HARRY

My editor. I just found out he died six years ago...

HARRY

Not long before he died he sent me this notebook. But

I didn't want to know anything about him, I also

didn't know he was dying... and I put it away... until

today... His wife just told me he would have liked to

speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the

notebook... but I didn't give him the chance.

DIEGO

Had you spoken since the accident?

173

HARRY

No. Never.

DIEGO

The coffee is in front of you...

DIEGO

Are you OK? Would you like me to stay here?

HARRY

No, no... You're heading out?

DIEGO

My mother arrives today. I would like to be home when

she arrives.

HARRY

I didn't know she was arriving...

DIEGO

I didn't either, she left me a message this morning.

She's coming to celebrate your birthday, with us...

HARRY

It's my birthday?

DIEGO

It seems so. Today's the (he tells him the day), does

that sound right?

HARRY

Yes. A day like today, fifty-one years ago, I entered the

world.

DIEGO

174

Happy birthday!

JUDIT

I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?

DIEGO

Yes.

JUDIT

I was very worried about you!

DIEGO

Mateo has looked after me day and night...

JUDIT

Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...?

DIEGO

Yes...

JUDIT

175

Today's his birthday, we must get him something... What

have you been up to all this time?

DIEGO

Nothing... Watching movies... and talking...

JUDIT

(As if it were something strange) Talking?

DIEGO

Yes...

JUDIT

What about?

DIEGO

Mom, please!

JUDIT

OK. So what happened to you? (Sort of joking) I

don't know if I should believe the thing about the

stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a

script...

DIEGO

(Elusive) (I suffered) ... an accident. But I would

rather not speak of that right now...

JUDIT

(Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident?

DIEGO

It's hard to explain.

JUDIT

(Orders him, annoyed) Try to! I am not that stupid!

DIEGO

176

Let's leave it for another time, yes? I am all well now.

JUDIT

What's wrong with you, Diego?

DIEGO

Nothing. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to buy a

present for Mateo.

JUDIT

(Repeats) For Mateo...

DIEGO

Alright, Harry.

JUDIT

Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of

having two names.

177

JUDIT

Wait, my arms are full...

MATEO

Are those flowers?

JUDIT

Yes! Happy Birthday!

JUDIT

Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank

you!

MATEO

You've been looking after me for fourteen years now...

JUDIT

178

I've found him somewhat hostile. He left without

telling me what it was that happened... Will you tell

me?

MATEO

I don't know. It should be your son to tell you.

JUDIT

What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he

suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?

MATEO

(He evades the first question, but responds to the

second one.) Two weeks ago, at the place where he

D.J.'s, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that

had been spiked with G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He

thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola.

JUDIT

Liquid ecstasy?

MATEO

Yes. It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with

alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres

before he drank from his friend's glass...

JUDIT

And... what happened... exactly?

MATEO

(Being vague.) He was badly affected. He spent two

days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here.

179

JUDIT

Diego's a drug addict?

MATEO

No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing

liquid ecstasy by mistake...

JUDIT

But how can one make a mistake with something like

that?

MATEO

At first glace one cannot tell the difference. Both

glasses contained Coca-cola... It's not the first time

it happens...

MATEO

Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed...

JUDIT

(That I wouldn't be alarmed?!) Well, he hasn't

succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me,

no?

MATEO

He is wanting to do so!

JUDIT

Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn't answer!

MATEO

Then you should try answering him, when he asks you.

180

JUDIT

The two of you are acting very differently. Both of

you. You both have changed.

MATEO

You smell good...

JUDIT

(Insecure) I have put on some makeup and I am dressed

as a woman.

MATEO

What's the dress like?

MATEO

181

And the hair? How are you wearing your hair? It's

been so long since I've asked you that I don't even

know whether it's long or short.

JUDIT

I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short.

MATEO

Short like Jean Seberg in "Breathless"? Like Joan of

Arc on the bonfire? Like Liza Minnelli in "Cabaret"?

Or like Yul Brynner?

JUDIT

Short, or rather, very short, like that of all

fortysomethings who want to appear younger.

MATEO

I am sure it looks good on you. Thanks for dressing up

for me, Judit...

182

JAVIER

My name is Javier. How many are you?

MATEO

Three.

JAVIER

Please, grab onto each other's shoulders and follow me

in Indian-file. I will guide you to your table. It's

number eight.

JUDIT

What is the idea here, Harry?

MATEO

We are dinning in darkness.

JAVIER

You didn't know this, ma'am?

JUDIT

(Anxious, feeling slightly ridiculed) No...

JAVIER

You should have been warned, but don't worry. People

get used to it after a few minutes.

183

JAVIER

Imagine that your plate is the face of a watch. Your

silverware is at 9h and at 3h. Your glass at 1h.

Bread at 11h.

JUDIT

Harry, what is all this about?

JAVIER

We want our clients to discover that the lack of sight

harnesses the other senses. Touch, taste, smell and

sound will acquire a special intensity tonight, ma'am.

I hope you'll enjoy them.

184

JAVIER

Will the gentlemen be drinking something?

MATEO

Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast.

MATEO

I found out about this place in the newspaper and I

wanted to check it out.

DIEGO

It's a German idea, there are various restaurant like

this one, they're totally in fashion.

JUDIT

(Can't believe what she's hearing.) Darkness, in

fashion? I don't understand.

185

DIEGO

Let's toast!

JUDIT

Yes. Let's toast.

DIEGO

Happy Birthday!

JUDIT

Happy Birthday! We must look into each other's eyes.

(She has already said it and it's too late when she

thinks of retracting it.)

DIEGO

Well, we're kind of screwed...

JUDIT

Oh, sorry... It slipped.

186

MATEO

Joy! Joy! (to Judit) Bring your ear to me so that I

can sprinkle some wine behind it. It's for good luck!

187

JUDIT

I don't know what you've been talking about these past

days...

JUDIT

But I do know what I haven't talked to you about all

these years...

MATEO

I've never asked you...

JUDIT

But you must have asked yourself a thousand times.

This is my birthday gift, Mateo. (To Diego) The gift

is also for you, Diego.

188

JUDIT

(To Mateo) After you disappeared, Ernesto Senior

thought only of his revenge. A plan had occurred to

him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very

least, both Luis and me. It wasn't an issue, we both

sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With

me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he

proposed that I leave for a month and a half to the

United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could

undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I

wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the

movie (because that was his plan, to make a mess out

of the film). I opted to stay in Madrid and have

Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness

everything. If I was going to betray you, I wanted to

pay the full price...

MATEO

What a living hell! For both of you!

DIEGO

You said it!

JUDIT

Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst

takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning

your film into a monster (briefly tears?). The only

way of withstanding that was to suffer more.

189

(Overcome) I sold myself to Ernesto because of my pain

and jealousy. I couldn't take it and I couldn't (then)

forgive you for having abandoned Cinearte with Lena

without saying a word! My betrayal was my revenge

against you, against her and against myself... The only

innocent one was Diego... (To Diego) Forgive me, my

son, for the bitterness that you've had to absorb all

these years... no one deserves to grow up like this...

MATEO

(Interrupts her) Don't continue, Judit! It's not necessary.

JUDIT

Yes. Now that you once again call yourself Mateo, I

have no excuse.

JUDIT

190

No one knew where you were. We had no idea. Ernesto

Senior put everything together, the premier, all that

ruckus, to see if you'd react. His revenge was

pointless if neither of you found out about it.

(Pauses) Ernesto asked me constantly if I knew where

you were, but I said that I also didn't know anything,

which was true.

MATEO

(Somber) That's why I never called you, but even if

you don't believe it, I was very worried for you and

the boy.

JUDIT

I believe you...

JUDIT

Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but

before they found you, you called me, two days after

the premier. (Slowly, debilitated.) I was too

embarrassed to answer, and... too stunned. I still am.

When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don't

know why, I gave him the phone number for Famara...

JUDIT

191

Ernesto sent his son to find you in Lanzarote.

JUDIT

He was the one who found you after the accident and

called the hospital...

DIEGO

Did he have something to do with the accident?

JUDIT

No! But I can't stop thinking that had I not given his

father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have

happened...

MATEO

(Dryly) Why do you think that?

JUDIT

I don't know...

MATEO

(Categorically) If you don't know, then stop torturing

yourself.

192

MATEO

Good night.

JUDIT

(Destroyed) Good night. Call me if you need anything...

193

DIEGO

(Touching her forehead) You are sweating...

JUDIT

It's a panic attack... (Takes a deep breath, as if she

had lost her wind) Hand me the purse!

JUDIT

194

This will pass soon...

JUDIT

I will sleep well with this...

DIEGO

Do you want me to stay here?

JUDIT

(Surprised) Here? What for?

DIEGO

In case the panic returns, so that you don't feel alone.

JUDIT

Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep

soon.

DIEGO

Call me, if you are not feeling well...

195

196

WAITER FRIEND

Why here so early?

MATEO

I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number?

197

JUDIT

How impressive!

DIEGO

I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same

for Mateo...

DIEGO

Are you OK?

JUDIT

Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last

night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally

and I know how to stop it...

DIEGO

It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop

out of your stomach.

JUDIT

198

It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack...

(Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the

decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego,

there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday.

DIEGO

About Mateo?

JUDIT

Yes.

DIEGO

You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast.

JUDIT

If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end

of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.

DIEGO

The year of punk.

JUDIT

Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...

DIEGO

In a love affair?

JUDIT

Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are

still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his

side... That didn't keep us from working together...

until now...

DIEGO

I knew all that, or I imagined it...

JUDIT

There's one more thing... Mateo is your father...

199

DIEGO

And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological

father? You made him up?

JUDIT

No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up...

I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover

existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived.

His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him

that you were conceived, but your biological father

was Mateo, not Vicente.

DIEGO

(Assimilates the news. He is not displeased) Does

Mateo know?

JUDIT

No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of

course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I

didn't want our relationship to change because of it.

After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to

become a father.

DIEGO

I see...

JUDIT

200

If you think I made a mistake, don't tell me now. We

have the rest of our lives for recriminations.

DIEGO

I will not recriminate you... I think I like being

Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he

called early this morning...

JUDIT

Who?

DIEGO

Mateo. At 8h.

JUDIT

What did he want?

DIEGO

For you to call him as soon as you could.

JUDIT

(Surprised, tense) That I call him? Why in the world

have you not awakened me?!

DIEGO

Because, after what happened last night, you needed to

sleep. He didn't say it was urgent. You can call him

now.

201

JUDIT

(Attempts to appear calm, since her confession her

voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker)

Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need

anything? (This is what she's most worried about.)

MATEO

(Almost with irony) I am not alright, Judit. And yes,

I do need something... The forty thousand meters of

negative we shot during my last film in order to edit

it... I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just

found out the material was destroyed in '94. I

imagined something like this, I just didn't think it

would have happened that soon...

JUDIT

(With urgency) Let me explain...

MATEO

(Cuts her off) No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit,

and I don't want to take it out on you!

JUDIT

(Surprised and alarmed) What are you doing at

Ernesto's house?

202

MATEO

I think I am going to bribe him. We need money, I

don't want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay

Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to

throw...

JUDIT

Mateo, stop talking crazy!

MATEO

It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to

blame for Magdalena's death.

JUDIT

My God! (She asks Diego to bring her the box of

tranquilizers.) Wait a second... I have something to

tell you.

MATEO

Let it be, you already said enough last night.

JUDIT

203

(She takes a pill and yells at him) Listen to me,

Mateo! (As she raises her voice, she becomes

dominant.) I was the production director, if you want

to know anything about the footage, ask me!

MATEO

Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you have to

tell me?

JUDIT

In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be

destroyed.

MATEO

In '94! Very shortly after the release of that

aberration.

JUDIT

Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of

all the material... and that was many years ago.

MATEO

That's not anything that I don't already know.

JUDIT

As the film's producer I was the only one who had

access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave

the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted

it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home.

MATEO

You are lying to me.

JUDIT

I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't

realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all

the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes...

Everything! You can have it whenever you want!

204

MATEO

That changes everything.

JUDIT

(Begs) Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto

alone. He had nothing to do with this.

MATEO

I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what he was

doing in Lanzarote. I'll let you go, it seems he

wants to talk... (Hangs up)

ERNESTO J.

Here is a copy of "the making of".

MATEO

And why would I want that? I can't watch it! Plus,

I'm not interested.

ERNESTO J.

Have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it.

(This DVD proves that I wasn't responsible for the

accident.) Oh, and even if my father had asked me to

205

harm you, I never would have... You are very important

to me, Mateo...

MATEO

Is there something new I should know about?

DIEGO

(Surprised and moved) It's a very interesting

documentary... And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed

you to Lanzarote, until the last moment.

MATEO

The images are there?

DIEGO

206

Yes.

MATEO

Those of the last night?

DIEGO

Yes. He recorded you at a safe distance, while you

were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit

by the light of his headlights. It's not a lot, but

enough to see what happened. Not only did he not have

anything to do with the accident, he saved your life.

DIEGO

And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic

circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and

Lena kiss...

MATEO

A kiss? I don't remember it...

DIEGO

It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many

kisses a couple gives each other, almost without

thinking...

MATEO

(Pensive) The last kiss...

DIEGO

207

Yes. Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell

you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed,

but the last sensation she experienced in this world

was the taste of your mouth...

208

PINA

(Whispers.) What a drag! (She opens, not the least

bit welcoming.) Oh, it's you?

CHON

(Anxious, reproachful.) I have left you a thousand

messages!

PINA

Yes. A thousand from you and none from Ivan.

CHON

(Looks at the suitcase as if it were a menacing,

strange bug.) What about this suitcase!

PINA

It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

CHON

And that cast on your leg?

PINA

His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the

stairs...

CHON

Well, we're in good shape! I've also broken up with

my husband...

209

PINA

Oh, sorry to hear it! I will make some coffee, I have

spent my entire night looking for Ivan and I haven't

gone to bed.

CHON

Neither have I.

PINA

When did you leave him?

CHON

Four days ago. I could see it coming. The thing is

that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I

notice there is this "guy" looking at me.

CHON

(Voracious.) Oh my, gazpacho! Can I have a bowl?

PINA

210

No! I've spiked it with an entire box of downers...

CHON

How so?

PINA

In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho.

CHON

(Scolds her.) Pina, my God!

PINA

And that's not all! Since he wasn't calling, I've

torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage...

CHON

I've tripped on the thing, but I didn't want to pry...

And the bed? I think I noticed it smoking a bit...

PINA

I dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and I

didn't want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will

have to change the mattress, but all for the best! A

whole lot of less memories!

PINA

But excuse me, I've interrupted you. You were telling

me...

PINA

211

CHON

(Struggling with what she's about to say.) Yes. I

was telling you that I also have a suitcase at home.

PINA

Your husband's?

CHON

No. It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine,

uncut.

PINA

You've become a dealer, Chon?

CHON

No! How could you think that! I am still a Counselor

for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase

appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the

police find out. They could put me in jail!

PINA

212

CHON

PINA

CHON

PINA

CHON

PINA

CHON

PINA

CHON

213

standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who

knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure!

PINA

So you lost your mind...

CHON

What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could

stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I

couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking

that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the

suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the

closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase.

And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure

chance, I am watching TV last night and I find out

that the police have nabbed him in the course of a

drug sting operation and that he is one of the most

wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I

discover that it is filled with little bags of

cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't

returned since...

PINA

What a story, my God!

CHON

(Concluding.) I was wondering why he was such a good

fuck! For men living in such high-stakes conditions,

each fuck could be the last! (She reaches her arm

out, again.) Look, the goose-bumps!

214

PINA

I've seen them already... They comes easy for you...

(Changing topic.) And the suitcase?

CHON

(Humble.) I was going to ask you... if you didn't mind

that I brought it here. If they find it in my house,

well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that

it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of

Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would be,

and my party! My party can't take one more scandal!

CHON

The police!

PINA

Shush, how could it be the police?! No one knows

you're here!

CHON

I am a woman who attracts attention, Pina. Since I

was a little girl...

PINA

Just pretend you're here for coffee...

215

DIEGO

This is hilarious!

MATEO

(Wants to be sure.) It doesn't sound like what we

watched on TV, right?

DIEGO

Not at all! This is a whole different thing!

JUDIT

It's wonderful, Mateo. We should re-release it.

MATEO

The important thing is to finish it. Films must be

finished.
