"BLADE II" -- by David Goyer

BLADE II -- By David Goyer

EMPLOYEE

Have you recently visited a tropical

country?  Uh-huh?  In the past twelve

months have you gotten a tattoo, non

sterile acupuncture, or undergone any

ear, skin or body piercing?

NURSE (O.S.)

Jared Nomak?

NURSE (CONT'D)

Hi.  We're ready for you now.

NURSE

(referring to her clipboard)

I see from your questionnaire that you

don't have any immediate next of kin?

NOMAK

Not that I'm in contact with.

NURSE

Nobody to call in case of an emergency?

NOMAK

No --

(apprehensive)

Does that mean I can't be a donor?

NURSE

It depends.  We came up with some

unusual results on your blood test.

NOMAK

(anxious)

How unusual?

NURSE

Your blood has a very rare phenotype,

one that's quite valuable to people like

us.

NOMAK

Us?  What are you talking about?

DOCTOR

It's a good news-bad news scenario,

Jared.  Good news for us, bad for you.

NOMAK

Vampires --

NOMAK (CONT'D)

I fucking hate vampires.

CUT TO:

BLADE

Tell me where he his now and I'll

consider you a loose end.

CUT TO:

VAMPIRE

Nobody's th--

BLADE

Old man, old man, what've they done to

you --

WHISTLER

Why didn't you finish me off?!?!  I told

you --

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

-- TO -- FUCKING -- FINISH -- ME -- OFF!

BLADE

Come on, Whistler.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Let's go home.

BLADE

Scud!

SCUD (O.S.)

Lock up your daughters, people --

SCUD (CONT'D)

The Dark Knight returns.

SCUD (CONT'D)

Little toke of the smokage, B?

BLADE

Knock it off.  We've got work to do.

SCUD

Fuck me!

BLADE

You going to stand there crapping your

pants or are you going to help me?!

SCUD

You got something in mind, Blade?

BLADE

Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on

heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey

in one night.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Gonna try and OD Whistler on a

retroviral cure.

SCUD

I don't know about this, man --

BLADE

(to Scud)

Get back!!!

BLADE (CONT'D)

If there's anything of you left in

there, Whistler, listen up now.  Come

morning, those shutters are going up.

Either you'll be cured, or you'll fry.

BLADE

It's going to be a long night.

CUT TO:

WHISTLER

Daylight.  Son of a bitch.

CUT TO:

BLADE

How do you feel?

WHISTLER

Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my

mouth.

WHISTLER

You came back for me.

BLADE

Did you think I wouldn't?

WHISTLER

Took you long enough.

BLADE

Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst

for good.  I'll be watching you close.

You start to back-slide --

WHISTLER

You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't

expect anything else.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

I'll say one thing for doing time as a

suckhead.  Seems to have knocked that

cancer of mine back into remission.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

Where the hell's my lathe?

TV (O.S.)

Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer!

He's a demon on wheels.  He's gaining on

you so you better look alive.  He's busy

revving up the powerful Mach Five --

SCUD

Whistler.  Cool beans.  Nice to meet

you, man.  Heard a lot.  I'm Josh

Frohmeyer.  You can call me Scud,

though.  That's what most people do.

WHISTLER

Tell me something, Skid --

SCUD

Scud.

WHISTLER

Whatever --

(checking the motor)

What'd you do to the Charger?

SCUD

The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after

market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide

injection system, forged aluminum

pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing

fuel pump.

WHISTLER

Gave it a more aggressive exhaust

profile ramping.

SCUD

Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this

betty up another three-hundred

horsepower.

WHISTLER

(cutting him off)

And you'll burn the damn thing out

before your next fucking oil change.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

Where'd you dig up this shit-bird

anyway?

SCUD

Look, what's your problem?

WHISTLER

My problem, shitbird, is that I tried to

blow my fucking head off and wound up

sucking blood clots for the last year

and a half!  Now you're standing there

choking your chicken like we're all

walking around some fucking candy-ass

vampire sitcom!

SCUD

Hey, you think I don't know what's at

stake here?  We practically compromised

our whole operation to save your

puckered old ass!  And for what?

WHISTLER

(grabs Scud's shirt)

Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I

built this operation, you fucking turd

stain.

SCUD

Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.

BLADE

Human?

SCUD

Body temp's fifty so I'll guess suck

head.

SCUD (CONT'D)

I don't understand, I'm not getting

anything on the surveillance cams.

WHISTLER

They're fried.  Whoever's out there is

using magnesium flares.  Seems like

they've got your security system stopped

out pretty well.

SCUD

Whoa, whoa, easy cowboy - I'm not

trusting you with a weapon just yet.

BLADE

Hit the God-lights.

SECOND INTRUDER

Stop!!!!!

SECOND INTRUDER (CONT'D)

We didn't come here to fight.  We came

to deliver a message.

BLADE

Take off your masks.

ASAD

My name is Asad.  This is Nyssa.  We

represent the Shadow Cabinet.  The

ruling body of Vampire nation.  They're

offering you a truce.  They want to meet

with you.

SCUD

(wiping blood from his nose)

Bullshit.

NYSSA

For decades you've been the thing we've

feared the most.  But there's something

else loose on the streets now --

NYSSA (CONT'D)

Something worse than you.

CUT TO:

SCUD

This whole deal's giving me a serious

case of the butt-willies.

WHISTLER

Look, kid, they obviously found your

base of operations.  If it was a trap,

why flip their dicks by announcing

themselves?

BLADE

I agree.  We play along for now, we

might wind up learning something about

how their world ticks.

WHISTLER

(grinning at Scud)

Either that or feeding the worms.

ASAD

They're ready to see you now.

CUT TO:

BLADE

What?

NYSSA

They tell bedtime stories about you.

Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly,

I'm disappointed.

(Blade raises an eyebrow)

That you were willing to come along so

easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

BLADE

Semtex explosive.  Enough to level a

city block.  How's that for assurance?

NYSSA

The House of Erebus you encountered

before were nothing but feudal lords.

The true power of the Vampire Nation

lies here --

ASAD

Few warmbloods have seen what's beyond

this door.

NYSSA

Father --

DAMASKINOS

I hope you don't mind the cold.  When

one such as myself reaches an advanced

age, certain precautions are needed in

order to preserve the flesh.

ASAD

Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

DAMASKINOS

(in vampire dialect; subtitled)

Welcome, Daywalker.  I thank you for

coming.  I've been anxious to meet you

for quite some time.

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

And the late Abraham Whistler.  I trust

your time amongst our numbers was

agreeable?

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

(smiling knowingly)

It has been said, you may have enemies

whom you hate, but not enemies whom you

despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then

his success shall be yours, too.  In

that regard, I should thank you.

BLADE

For what?

STEVENS (O.S.)

Eliminating Deacon Frost.

STEVENS (CONT'D)

All that unseemly business with LaMagra.

You did us a favor.

(offering his hand to Blade)

Carter Stevens.

BLADE

You're human.

STEVENS

(with a smile)

Barely.  I'm a lawyer.

ASAD

Mr. Stevens works with the National

Institute of Health.

(off Blade's look)

Given that they monitor the nation's

blood supply, a strategic alliance

seemed prudent.

STEVENS

We also finance a number of humanitarian

organizations -- the National Institute

of Infectious Diseases for one, the

Human Genome Project...

BLADE

Why?

NYSSA

Survival.

NYSSA (CONT'D)

As you may know, Vampirism is an

arbovirus, one that's spread through the

saliva of parasitic organisms --

(motioning to the hologram)

In this case, vampires are the vector.

The virus replicates within the human

bloodstream, evolving its host into an

entirely new life-form.

(beat)

Unfortunately, viruses evolve too --

NYSSA (CONT'D)

We've dubbed this new virus the Reaper

Strain.  And like any good pathogen, it

appears to have found a carrier -- a

"Patient Zero".

NYSSA (CONT'D)

His name is Jared Nomak.

DAMASKINOS

Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece.

The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more.

He was born a vampire, but he is an

anomaly.

(to Blade)

Like you.  Unlike the rest of us,

however, he feeds on not just humans,

but vampires as well.

BLADE

Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.

NYSSA

You're missing the point.  Their vampire

victims don't die.  They turn.  They

become carriers.  If the Reapers

continue unchecked, there could be

thousands of them before the month is

over.  Do the math.

BLADE

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

You want me to hunt them for you.

DAMASKINOS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

Not alone.

ASAD

We've been training a small tactical

unit -- the Bloodpack.  We want you to

lead them.

WHISTLER

Just how long has this little social

club of yours been together?

NYSSA

Two years.

BLADE

Then they weren't created to go after

your "patient zero".

NYSSA

No.  They've been training to hunt you.

CUT TO:

BLADE

What do you think?

WHISTLER

Sounds like a plan.

BLADE

What do you really think?

WHISTLER

(lighting a cigarette)

These guys are shitting bricks cause

they're no longer on the top of the food

chain.  They're going to fuck us the

first chance they get.

SCUD

So you're going to do this?

BLADE

Keep your friends close and your enemies

closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?

SCUD

I'm worried about him.

(off Blade's look)

Look, I know he's your friend, but just

watch him, okay?  Nobody goes cold

Turkey from the Thirst in a night.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SCUD

Um, we've got company.

WHISTLER

Well if it isn't Snow White and the

Seven Suckheads.

REINHARDT

Check it out, troops.  Count Chocula.

ASAD

Blade, this is Reinhardt.  That's

Snowman, Lighthammer, Priest, Chupa and

Verlaine.

REINHARDT

Tell me something, Chief.  Can you

blush?

BLADE

Alright, you want to play this game?

BLADE (CONT'D)

You've been training two years to take

me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire

hunter.  So do it.

NYSSA

What the hell are you doing, Blade?

BLADE

We're going to be working as a unit, you

people will be taking orders from me.

(spreading his hands wide)

So let's get it over with.  I'll give

you a free shot, Reinhardt.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Why are you looking at her for?  You

need permission?   I'm giving it to you.

CHUPA

Take him, cabron!

BLADE

What's wrong, Reinhardt?  You need a

fucking manual?

VERLAINE

Do it, Reinhardt.  Do it!!!

BLADE

Listen up, Adolph, I just popped an

explosive charge in the back of your

head.  Silver nitrate.  Rigged to blow

if anyone tampers with it.  I'll be

keeping the detonator on me at all

times.  You so much as look at me

crosswise and I swear you'll be macking

your girlfriend's pie with a fucking

neck stump!  Got it?!

BLADE (CONT'D)

Any questions?

CUT TO:

WHISTLER

(opening a case of bullets)

Glaser safety rounds in .38, .45, and

9mm caliber.  Foil capsules at the tip

filled with silver nitrate grains.  They

pack a major kinetic energy dump.  And

since you suckheads don't like sunlight,

we've modified the entry lights with UV

filters --

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

This puppy here?  Hyper-velocity

railgun.  Spits up silver-tipped iron

core needles at six thousand butt

humping feet per second.  Like this --

CHUPA

Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!

WHISTLER

Getting your attention, Paco.

CHUPA

Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what

the fuck are you gonna do with it?

BLADE

If you girls are finished flirting, I'd

like to get started.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Didn't I kill you already?

VERLAINE

(cold)

That was my sister.

BLADE

This the part where you beat your chest

and vow revenge?

VERLAINE

Something like that.

BLADE

Save it for the director's cut.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Where to first?

NYSSA

The House of Pain.

CUT TO:

NYSSA

From what we can gather, the Reapers

hunt in packs, targeting places where

vampires congregate.  So far, they've

attacked bloodbanks, safehouses,

underground clubs like this --

WHISTLER

I don't see any traffic, no vampire

glyphs --

NYSSA

Look closer.  Because of your efforts,

we've had to re-think our habits,

tighten our security.

WHISTLER

(lowering binocs; to Blade)

Let's put this clusterfuck in gear.

REINHARDT

You're not going anywhere, greenjeans.

You won't be able to pass for us.

WHISTLER

Like I give a shit.

BLADE

(to Whistler; sotto)

He's right.  They'll smell that you're

human.  Stay here, watch our backs.

WHISTLER

(bristling)

I don't like it.

BLADE

I'm not giving you a choice, old man.

REINHARDT

You don't keep that dog of yours curbed,

Blade.  We might have to do it for you.

BLADE

Keep pushing, asshole.

NYSSA

This is our world you're entering.  You

may see things -- feeding.

(off Blade's inscrutable face)

Just remember why you're here.

BLADE

(cryptic)

I haven't forgotten.

PRIEST

So what are we looking for, exactly?

ASAD

Anyone who looks suspicious.

BLADE

You gotta be kidding me.

BLADE

(to Nyssa)

What is it with you people and pain?

NYSSA

We need it.  Sensations are addictive

and pain cuts the deepest.

(off his look)

Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring --

because we regenerate, none of it's

permanent.  So we have to take it to the

next level. To remind us we're alive.

BLADE

You reading me, Scud?

SCUD (O.S.)

Loud and clear, B.

SCUD

Everything's copacetic in the Mystery

Van.  How you doing, Whistler?

WHISTLER

Walking on sunshine, toke-boy.

CORPULENT VAMPIRE

Close the fucking door, buddy.

CORPULENT VAMPIRE (CONT'D)

I said, close the f--

NYSSA

What was that?

BLADE

(poker-faced)

Nothing.

SCUD

Um, Whistler, you out there?

SCUD (CONT'D)

(more urgently)

Whistler?

SCUD (O.S.)

(filtered; panicked)

They're here!!!!

LIGHTHAMMER

Ohmygodhe'sfuckingkillingmehe's --

SCUD

UV headlights, c'mon, come on!!!

SCUD (CONT'D)

FuckmefuckmefuckmeFUCKME!!!!

CUT TO:

SCUD

Use your entry lights!  They can't stand

the UV!!!

ASAD

Use your entry lights!

BLADE

(into com-link)

Whistler!  He's heading across the roof!

Take him!

BLADE (CONT'D)

Whistler!!!

NOMAK

Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my

enemy?  What do you think, Blade?  What

am I to you?

NOMAK (CONT'D)

Athelfiki singenia ex amato.

NYSSA

You're hurt.

BLADE

(brushing off her concern)

I'll heal.

NYSSA

What about Nomak?

BLADE

He escaped.  You didn't tell me they

were immune to silver and garlic.

NYSSA

I didn't know.

BLADE

We lose anybody?

NOMAK

Lighthammer and --

PRIEST

Oh god, oh God it hurts!  It hurts, it

hurts, fuck, it hurts.  Ugh!

BLADE

how long since he was bitten?

NYSSA

Minutes.

BLADE

It's already changing him --

REINHARDT

Jesus, can't you get him to shut the

fuck up!?

NYSSA

(gravely)

His blood cells aren't producing oxygen

anymore.  His own body is suffocating

him.  These things are like crack

addicts.  If they don't feed every few

hours, they'll feed on themselves.

REINHARDT

Somebody put him out of his misery for

fuck's sake!

VERLAINE

You kill him!  I'm not killing him!

CHUPA

Mierda!!

WHISTLER (O.S.)

If this is the best you turd-stains have

to offer, I'm not impressed.

BLADE

I thought you were supposed to be

watching our backs.

WHISTLER

Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

CHUPA

(approaching, hostile)

Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you

hadn't noticed, we lost two men while

you were out farting around.

WHISTLER

(poking Chupa in the chest)

You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours

down a few notches, paco.

CHUPA

Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair

away from cowboy heaven.

WHISTLER

Ain't no thing but a chicken wing,

buttercup.

BLADE

(still suspicious)

Where were you, Whistler?

WHISTLER

I'll show you.

REINHARDT

What the hell?

WHISTLER

I found him like this.  I think he was

trying to crawl back into that culvert.

NYSSA

(calling down)

Everything okay?

CUT TO:

DAMASKINOS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

Yes?

STEVENS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

They've made contact with the Reapers.

DAMASKINOS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

Any casualties?

STEVENS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

Two so far.

DAMASKINOS

(reverting to English)

An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was

not among them, I trust.

STEVENS

No.  This is a dangerous game, you're

playing, Damaskinos.

DAMASKINOS

Any game worthy of being played is.  One

must be patient.  In this way, I have

outlived my enemies.  All of them.

STEVENS

Blade's too volatile.  You're not going

to be able to keep manipulating him --

DAMASKINOS

You worry too much, Stevens.  I have

assurance from our friend inside that

events are unfolding as scripted.

STEVENS

As scripted?  You've already lost two of

your own.  How many more are you willing

to sacrifice?

DAMASKINOS

As many as it takes.

(pointing)

Do you see that jar over there?

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

It contains my human heart --

(touching a pale scar on his

chest)

Something I relinquished a long time

ago.  Only a fool would appeal to it

now.

CUT TO:

BLADE

Recognize him?

NYSSA

(nodding)

From the surveillance footage in the

bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's

Nomak attacked.

BLADE

Which means he turned about seventy-two

hours ago.

NYSSA

Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't

appear to have any broken bones, no

entry wounds of any kind -- what's

killing him?

BLADE

Time.

BLADE (CONT'D)

No hemoglobin left.

Their metabolisms are too fast.  They

burn out.  That's why they're having to

feed so often.  Their systems are self

destructing.

NYSSA

If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's

been alive longer than the others.

BLADE

Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.

(shaking his head)

There's something driving him beyond the

Thirst.  Something we're missing.

NYSSA (O.S.)

They appear to have a nictating membrane

here, like you'd see on a crocodile or

camel.  Shields the eyes from sunlight.

NYSSA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

A bifurcated mandible.  More developed

masseter muscles and zygomatic bones

around the mouth allowing for a much

larger, stronger bite --

NYSSA (CONT'D)

Epidermal layers are thicker, tougher --

SCUD

Ho-lee shit.

NYSSA

I've never seen anything like this.  The

Reapers are as different from us as we

are from you.

(probing the organism)

It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring

their bodies, creating new, parasitic

organs which consume the old ones.

BLADE

Like cancer with a purpose.

NYSSA

Exactly.  Look at the digestive system.

It's been drastically simplified.  Super

charged.  And this --

NYSSA (CONT'D)

The heart is completely encased in bone.

SCUD

Good luck getting a stake through that.

BLADE

We've got six hours till sunrise.  Be

ready by then.

ASAD

What happens at sunrise?

BLADE

We take up the hunt again.

CHUPA

You gotta be fucking joking.

BLADE

You've seen what we're up against.

Daylight's the only advantage we've got.

They'll be more vulnerable then.

REINHARDT

(pointedly)

And so will we.

BLADE

Look, I care about the humans who are

dying, not you, got it?

REINHARDT

(snarling)

Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not

going out into the sun.  It's too risky.

BLADE

You don't have a choice.  You're just

going to have to protect yourselves as

best you can.

REINHARDT

You buying any of this chocolate Elvis

bullshit?

CHUPA

This guy doesn't know what the fuck he's

doing.  We already lost Priest and

Lighthammer, who's gonna be next?  Fuck

him.  Fuck his rules.  First chance I

get, I'm chowing down on that fucking

HeeHaw sidekick of his.

VERLAINE

What do you think, Asad?

ASAD

(pointedly)

I don't think.  I follow orders.

WHISTLER

You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are

getting a mite too cozy for my taste.

BLADE

I wouldn't worry about it.

WHISTLER

I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're

starting to get confused as to which

side of the line you're standing on.

BLADE

Pretty hollow words coming from a man

who spent the last year running with the

enemy.

WHISTLER

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

BLADE

It means I'm starting to wonder if the

vampires still have their hooks in you.

You've been acting strange ever since I

gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to

anger --

(beat)

You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those

vampires knew our defense system

backwards and forwards.  Where'd they

get their intel?

WHISTLER

I'm compromised?!  Me?!  I'm not the one

playing stink-finger with Vampirella out

there!

BLADE

You're out of line, old man.

WHISTLER

(quietly)

We'll see.

DEALER

Lookin' to get hooked up?

CHUPA

What you got?

DEALER

Horse, Hawaiian ice.  Whatever you want.

CHUPA

Whatever, huh?  Well I'm all off the

hook on that bitch.

DEALER

So what's it gonna be?

CHUPA

Fear.

CHUPA (CONT'D)

I like a little adrenaline chaser.

BLADE

What do you think you're doing?

CHUPA

Trying to feed, puto baboso!

NYSSA

Do it and you die.

(Chupa considers options)

You heard Asad.  Until this is over,

these people are our allies.

CHUPA

Oh I haven't forgotten about Asad.  I'm

just wondering if you have.

NYSSA

He's right about one thing.  We do have

to survive.

BLADE

You don't have to hunt to do it.

NYSSA

Really?  What are we supposed to do,

then?  Starve ourselves because we fee

on others in order to live?  What about

that scumbag you just let off the hook?

A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you

justify saving people like that?

NYSSA (CONT'D)

You know the Thirst better than any of

us.  You're barely managing to tread

water yourself.  Living in a constant

state of pain, having to shoot up that

serum of yours.  That's not what I call

surviving, Blade.

CUT TO:

WHISTLER

(observing Scud)

The hell are you fiddling with there?

SCUD

(proud, succinct)

Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the

collimated beam, wanna concentrate the

light, get something like a UV laser

going.

WHISTLER

(shaking his head)

You're wasting your time, already been

tried.

SCUD

Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster

working on it, did you?

WHISTLER

(testy)

Nope.  Back then we did not.

SCUD

(unfazed)

So how long have you known Blade,

anyway?

WHISTLER

Going on twenty years now.

SCUD

Blade doesn't talk about the old days

much.

WHISTLER

Blade doesn't talk about anything much.

(nodding to Scud)

What about you, though?

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

Pretty.

SCUD

I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these

two chicks who were off to see the

Burning Man festival.  We were gonna

take "E", have ourselves a little

freeball out in the desert.  You know

the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never

thought this would happen to me, but --"

SCUD (CONT'D)

Anyway, halfway through our Three's

Company marathon, Janet and Chrissy

started taking chunks out of me.  Woulda

died too if Blade hadn't shown up and

staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.

(shrugging)

Things kinda fell in place after that.

SCUD (CONT'D)

Took myself a few souvenirs, though.

SCUD (CONT'D)

Mmm-mmm.  Poppa's got a brand new bag.

SCUD

The powerpacks have a limited charge,

maybe ten minutes of continuous use at

most.

NYSSA

What are these?

SCUD

UV flashbang grenades with plug-in

phosphor sticks --

(pointing to a backpack

carrier)

This is for the grand finale.  Wired

together a couple-dozen of those

puppies.  But I'd be careful where you

pop your load.  Might end up frying

yourselves in the process.

WHISTLER

What about you?  You're not coming?

SCUD

After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover,

not a fighter.

ASAD

What good is all this firepower if we

don't know where they're hiding?

BLADE

We won't need to.  They'll come to us.

REINHARDT

How?

REINHARDT (CONT'D)

This is fucking foul!

NYSSA

They're pheromones.  I infused them from

that Reaper's adrenal glands.  All

mammals use them to mark their

territory.  Even vampires.

CHUPA

Fuck that!  I'm not spraying some gash

hound's nut-juice on me!

NYSSA

Trust me, the Reapers will key to it.

If we use this, we'll draw them out.

CUT TO:

BLADE

Time for Nyssa's pheromones.

WHISTLER

Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.

BLADE

We'll split into three units.  First

team that makes contact wins the prize.

Try to maintain radio silence from here

on out.

CHUPA

Turn it off.

CHUPA (CONT'D)

We want to attract them, not scare them

off.

WHISTLER

Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark.

What am I supposed to do?

CHUPA

Bifocals, grandpa.  And try to keep up.

WHISTLER

(startled)

Shit!

BLADE

Must be hundreds of these skeletons

here.

REINHARDT

So?

BLADE

So I think you people may have

underestimated how many Reapers you're

dealing with.

CHUPA (O.S.)

Hey,hillbilly.

WHISTLER

What the fuck you doing?

CHUPA

Ain't nobody here but you and me,

chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a

time as any to settle up.

NYSSA (O.S.)

(filtered; over comm.)

Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're

all dead.

BLADE

Fry 'em.

ASAD

What?  Where did they go?

VERLAINE

Screw that, where did Snowman go?

NYSSA

Jesus, they were playing possum!

NOMAK (O.S.)

Whistler.

NOMAK (CONT'D)

If you survive this, tell your master.

My end is my beginning.

BLADE

Take mine!

BLADE (CONT'D)

Reinhardt!

BLADE

(shouting into radio)

Re-group!  Re-group!

NYSSA

Where's Chupa?

WHISTLER

Forget him, he's chunk-style.

ASAD

Same with Snowman and Verlaine.

WHISTLER

Guess that perfume of yours did the

trick after all?

BLADE

(quietly)

A little too well, I'd say.

WHISTLER

Perfect.  We got the whole fucking

Partridge family here.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

Unless anybody has any bright ideas, I'd

say we're about half a battery away from

a reaper gang-bang.

BLADE

Give me the rest of the pheromones.

ASAD

What are you doing?

BLADE

Verlaine's body is back there somewhere

with the UV bomb.  If you train your

guns in that direction, you'll drive an

opening in their ranks.  I'll run for

it.  When the Reapers come after me, you

make a break for it the other way.

ASAD

You won't make it.

BLADE

(hefting his UV gun)

Then I'll die trying, won't I?

NYSSA

Blade.

BLADE

Save it.  I don't want to hear your

words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

CUT TO:

ER NURSE

Sir, you can't just --

DOCTOR

What?!

BLADE

She needs a hypertransfusion.  NOW!

DOCTOR

(aghast)

God in Heaven.

POLICEMAN

Alright, buddy, step away if --

BLADE

Do you want to die?

DOCTOR

Not particularly.

BLADE

(holstering his MACH)

Then get your fucking team in gear.

CUT TO:

NYSSA

Each day is a little life.

BLADE

What?

NYSSA

"Each day is a little life.  Every

waking and rising a little birth, every

fresh morning a little youth, every

going to rest and sleep a little death."

NYSSA (CONT'D)

Anyone else make it?

BLADE

I don't think so.

NYSSA

Thank you.

BLADE

For what?

NYSSA

It would've been easy for you to let me

die back there today, but you didn't.

BLADE

(shrugging)

I wouldn't read too much into it.

BLADE (CONT'D)

You don't want to go there.

NYSSA

Why?

BLADE

Because one of us is going to kill the

other before this ends.

NYSSA

It doesn't have to be like that.  We

don't have to be enemies.

BLADE

Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as

long as the hunt was still on.  Now that

it's over, all bets are off.

NYSSA

(pointedly)

If that's true, then why'd you save me?

NYSSA (CONT'D)

Why do you hate us so much?

BLADE

I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I

do.  It's in my blood.

NYSSA

Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a

pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born

this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil

because I want to survive?

(beat)

What about a wolf?  What about any

predator?

NYSSA (CONT'D)

The only difference between you and me

is that I made peace with who I was a

long time ago.  I'm not ashamed of what

I am.

(beat)

You haven't been hunting us all these

years.  You've been hunting yourself.

NYSSA (CONT'D)

You're hurting me.

BLADE

Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what

you said?

BLADE (CONT'D)

Reminds you you're alive?

CUT TO:

SCUD

What's going on?

BLADE

He was here.  Watching us.

SCUD

Nomak?

BLADE

He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Nomak said something to me before he

disappeared the first time --

BLADE (CONT'D)

Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  At first I

thought he might've been using one of

the vampire dialects.  But it turns out,

it's Greek.  Do you know what it means?

BLADE (CONT'D)

It means "bloodbrother."

NYSSA

I don't understand.

WHISTLER (O.S.)

Well maybe I do.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

(to Scud)

Your security's for shit, kid.

BLADE

Where the hell have you been?

WHISTLER

Just out connecting a few dots.

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

Bangin' some vampire chick.  Kind of a

faux pas in our line of work, wouldn't

you say?  Hope you double bagged it, at

least.

BLADE

What's your problem, Whistler?

WHISTLER

Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

WHISTLER (CONT'D)

I did some checking on that Carter

Stevens character.  That familiar of

theirs who claimed he was with the NIH?

Turns out he used to work for them, but

he doesn't anymore.

BLADE

Then who does he work for?

WHISTLER

Some biotech outfit called Caliban

Industries.  They've been lying to us

since day one.  This Nomak fucker didn't

evolve.  He was designed.

NYSSA

I don't know what he's talking about.

WHISTLER

You expect us to believe that?

(to Blade)

Who you going to trust, Blade?  Me or

her?

STEVENS

You?

BLADE

(mobing in on Stevens)

Start talking, bitch.

STEVENS

I don't know what you --

BLADE

Nomak!  You created him!

STEVENS

Ohgodohgodohgod...

(in agony)

Alright, alright.  Yes, we did...

(gasping)

PLEASE!  PLEASE!!!

BLADE

Keep talking, Stevens.  Tell me why.

STEVENS

(sputtering)

The Shadow Cabinet.  For decades they've

been trying to find a way to rid

themselves of their hereditary

weaknesses.  Viral epidemiology,

immunochemistry.  Recombinant DNA was

the next logical step.

NYSSA

(genuinely horrified)

No, that's not possible.  They wouldn't

keep something like this from me...

STEVENS

Your father didn't want you to know.

(haltingly)

Something went wrong.  The Reaper strain

was too aggressive.  Then Nomak escaped.

WHISTLER

And we're supposed to clean up your

mess.  Fucking perfect.

STEVENS

(defensive)

Look, the fact that Nomak was

artificially created didn't make the

threat any less urgent.  He was still

out there, spreading the Reaper virus.

BLADE

The genetic material you spliced into

Nomak --

(beat; almost fearful)

Where did you get it?

DAMASKINOS (O.S.)

I should think that would be obvious at

this point.

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

We took the genetic material from you.

DAMASKINOS

Jared Nomak is your genetic brother.

And I suppose if you follow that line of

reasoning to its logical conclusion,

then these are your offspring.

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

(proudly)

A new breed, begotten from your own

flesh.  Immune to silver, even sunlight.

(stepping towards Blade)

The wolves have lain with the sheep long

enough.  No more compromises.  No more

deals.  Only closure.

REINHARDT

Put it back in park, Blade.

BLADE

Thought you were dead.

REINHARDT

Seems like there's a lot of that going

around these days.

REINHARDT (CONT'D)

Six-thousand feet per second, isn't that

what Whistler said?  Let's see you dodge

this one --

NYSSA

Blade!

BLADE

Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.

SCUD

You're wasting your time, Blade.  The

flechette's a dud.

SCUD (CONT'D)

It was never supposed to explode.  All

it was supposed to do was make you feel

like you were in control.

REINHARDT

Thought you had me on a short leash,

didn't you, chief?  Only it turns out,

you're the one that's been on the leash.

REINHARDT (CONT'D)

That's better.

SCUD

See, I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.

SCUD (CONT'D)

Yeah, your little cootchie knew.

WHISTLER

You little shit.  When did they get to

you?

SCUD

Back when Blade had me hunting down your

puckered old ass.  What's up with your

hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson

look-a-like?

SCUD (CONT'D)

Man, I so wanted to do that.

SCUD (CONT'D)

And you.  You never cared about me.  I

gave you everything.  All you cared

about was digging up the old fuck!  You

think they scoped out my security

system?

(chuckling)

I let them in.  Dude, I practically gave

'em the fucking keys.  I've been feeding

Damaskinos information the whole time.

Providing them with samples of your

genetic material -- helping them with

the Reaper program.  They're close,

Blade.  Right up against it.  Any day

now, they're all going to be Daywalkers.

And when that happens, well, let's just

say, I don't want to be on the losing

team.  You may be strong, you may be

fast, but in the end, you're just too

human, B.

SCUD (CONT'D)

So that's down and dirty.  Got anything

to say for yourself?

BLADE

(weak, but defiant)

Two things.  One, I was on to you the

moment they turned you.  And two --

(raising the detonator;

smiling)

I switched that dud of yours back with

the real one.

REINHARDT

Son of a bitch!

DAMASKINOS

Reinhardt!

REINHARDT

What about him, then?

(crossing to Whistler,

handcuffing him)

Me and Hobo Kelly here have a little

unfinished business.

REINHARDT (O.S.)

Nice.

REINHARDT (CONT'D)

How many vampires do you think he's

killed with this thing?

WHISTLER

Not nearly enough, Fritz.

REINHARDT

Keep talking, warmblood.

REINHARDT (CONT'D)

When I'm through with you, you'll be

begging for a dirt nap.

WHISTLER

Been dead before.  Didn't much cotton to

it.  Tell you what, chicken shit.  You

do your worst.  We'll settle up after.

CUT TO:

DAMASKINOS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

My child --

DAMASKINOS (CONT'D)

(in English)

I would hate to think you were losing

your perspective.  Who do you think God

favors in the web?  The spider or the

fly?

NYSSA

Nomak said something to Blade in Greek.

Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did

he learn that?

DAMASKINOS

From his father, of course.

NYSSA

(horrified)

You experimented on your own, son?

DAMASKINOS

I have fathered thousands of children in

centuries since I first walked this

earth.  Make no mistake, Nyssa.  Those

blood-ties mean nothing to me when

measured against the ascendancy of our

race.  Nothing.

(giving her an extra squeeze)

If you have any interest in remaining

alive, you would do well to remember

that.

CUT TO:

DAMASKINOS

With every century, humans become more

repulsive to me.  Once, you were souls

to be taken, corrupted.  But you have

disgraced yourselves to being nothing

more than blood and meat.

STEVENS

We're going to harvest you, Blade.

(injecting fluid into Blade)

Bone marrow, organs, everything.  Your

tissue's too valuable to let go to

waste.

BLADE

(weakly)

Nomak is still out there.

DAMASKINOS

True, but thanks to you, we know his

weakness.  We can keep him contained.

It's just a matter of time before we

hunt him down.

BLADE

Too bad you're out of it.

DAMASKINOS

And why is that?

BLADE

Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all

along.  To pay back the people who

created him.

STEVENS

You may be right.  Fortunately for us,

he has no idea where this facility is

located.

BLADE

He does now.

(off their concerned looks)

He's been watching me since the tunnels.

Following me.  I led him right to you.

BLADE (CONT'D)

Just like a trail of bread crumbs.

CUT TO:

NOMAK

(roaring)

FATHER!

DAMASKINOS

Stop him!

CUT TO:

REINHARDT

Shit!

CUT TO:

DAMASKINOS

Get out of the way.

CUT TO:

WHISTLER

Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!

BLADE

(weakly)

Blood...

STEVENS

What are you doing?!!

CUT TO:

REINHARDT

Stop him!!!

WHISTLER

GO!!!

BLADE

Tell me something, chief.  Can you

blush?

CUT TO:

NYSSA (O.S.)

I overrode the security codes.

NYSSA (CONT'D)

We're locked in.

DAMASKINOS

Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!

NYSSA

Maybe it's better that way.

BLADE (O.S.)

What's it going to be, Damaskinos?

Thiavolos.  The devil you know --

BLADE (CONT'D)

-- or the devil you don't?

DAMASKINOS

(vampire dialect; subtitled)

For God's sake, Nyssa!  Let us out of

here!

NOMAK

(in vampire dialect)

Why are you frightened, father?  The

prodigal son has returned.

BLADE

(alarmed)

Get out of here!

BLADE (CONT'D)

Nyssa!!!

NOMAK

(in vampire dialect)

Blood brother.

NYSSA

How does it look?

BLADE

(with genuine sadness)

Not good.

NYSSA

It won't be long now.  I can already

feel it burning inside me --

NYSSA (CONT'D)

I don't want to become what Nomak was --

(beat; straining)

I can't.  I want to die while I'm still

vampire.

BLADE

What do you want me to do?

NYSSA

I want to see the sun rise.

NYSSA

Each day is a little life.  Remember?

DISSOLVE TO:

BLADE (V.O.)

I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I

do.  It's in my blood...

RUSH

-- yelling for your tender touch, you

can never get enough --

RUSH (CONT'D)

-- cover me with your love --

RUSH

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir!

Voulez-vous coucher AVEC MOI!!!

BLADE

What?  You think I forgot about you?

FADE TO BLACK.
