DISSOLVE TO:

KETCHAM

Aw-shit!

KETCHAM

How much farther?

RATH

Just a little ways.  Up to those

trees.

KETCHAM

Oh, fuck it.

KETCHAM

Hey, this feels kinda good.

KETCHAM

Hey, do you mind if I talk a

little?  I feel like, I don't

know, talking I guess.

RATH

Sure.

KETCHAM

Funny, I've never been a talker.

My wife was always getting on me

about that.  'Say what you feel,

tell me what's bothering you,

you ve got to talk to me.'  I

never would though.  Not really.

RATH

Why not?

KETCHAM

I don't know.  Part of me wanted

to but part of me always said,

'What's she going to be able to

do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I

didn't trust her.

KETCHAM

My Margaret... I loved her but you

know what?  I cheated on her.  All

the time.  I don't even know why.

It wasn't the sex, Margaret was

great in bed.  I think if I wasn't

married I wouldn't have even looked

at some of those women.  I knew she

couldn't trust me, so how could I

trust her?  If she was here right

now I'd think that I would tell her

that I was sorry... 'course, if she

were here right now, maybe I

wouldn't feel like talking.

KETCHAM

I think I've heard of you.

RATH

It's possible.

KETCHAM

You're pretty famous aren't you?

RATH

I hope not.

KETCHAM

I know this may seem like a strange

question, but can I ask you how

much the contract was for -- not

to insult you or anything, I know

you're a professional, but just

for me, I was just wondering.

RATH

It's a common question.

KETCHAM

Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to

see that price tag.  Like art,

right?  You hang some painting

that looks like baby-puke in your

living room only if it costs a

bundle.

RATH

A dime.

KETCHAM

One hundred thousand?  That's it?

Jesus... Is that a lot?

RATH

Average.

KETCHAM

Shit... oh well.

KETCHAM

I have been thinking about this

for a long while.  I knew this day

was coming.  I knew someday

someone would make the call on me.

I never thought about anyone that

I had whacked.  What do you call

it anyway?

RATH

Taken.

KETCHAM

'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had

someone taken I would call our

General Contractor, transfer the

money and as soon as I hung up the

phone I forgot about them.

RATH

Everyone who plays the game knows

the rules.

KETCHAM

That's exactly what I told myself.

KETCHAM

I always wondered what I'd be

thinking at this exact moment.  I

imagined that I would be thinking

about the fucker who contracted

this, trying to figure out who

it was...

RATH

Don't know.  That's how it works.

KETCHAM

That's what our General Contractor

told us but how can you trust

someone like that?

RATH

Right.

KETCHAM

I thought that I would be thinking

about Margaret, or work, or that

I'd be having these deep, profound

and depressing thoughts but I'm

not.  I'm trying to think really

profound thoughts, but I can't.

It seems very funny to me.

RATH

What are you thinking about?

KETCHAM

I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't

that funny?  I haven't had a

Moonpie since I was ten years old.

Right now, I'm thinking how much

I'd love one.

RATH

And an R.C.

KETCHAM

Can I ask you something?

RATH

Go ahead.

KETCHAM

What do other guys do?

RATH

Everyone handles it differently.

Some are ready, some are not.

KETCHAM

Do they get down on their knees,

begging and crying?

RATH

Some.

KETCHAM

When I thought about this, that

was always there, in the back of

my head, that image of me on my

knees, crying.  It wouldn't go

away and it would really upset me.

It was something that I could never

get away from... but now, I feel

it's okay.  I feel good.

RATH

Can I ask you a question?

KETCHAM

Anything.

RATH

Why didn't you fade?

KETCHAM

You mean quit?

RATH

Yeah.

KETCHAM

I used to think about it.  I had

Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I

thought about moving somewhere

far away like, Europe.  I could

see all of that, the first part,

the getting away but I couldn't

see that next part.  'Then what?'

So I'd stop thinking about it and

go back to work.  You understand?

RATH

Yeah.

KETCHAM

I always pictured that I would end

in some land fill, under

someone else's garbage.  I kept

picturing those plastic diapers

filled with some baby's green shit,

covering me.  But this is nice...

KETCHAM

Look at that.  I haven't watched

the sun set in a million years.

Do you mind?

RATH

No.

KETCHAM

Nice... real nice.

ESCORT (WOMAN)

Hi.  Did you call --

RATH

Yes.  Please come in.

ESCORT

Goodness, it's so dark...

RATH

I prefer it like this.

ESCORT

How can a beautiful man like you

be shy?

RATH

I prefer it, that's all.

ESCORT

It's okay, honey.  We can do it

anyway you want.

RATH

Would you like a drink?

ESCORT

I'd love one.  Whatever you're

having.

ESCORT

Beautiful.

ESCORT

Good will towards men.

RATH

Why are you working today?

ESCORT

Holidays are our busiest days.  No

one likes to be alone on holidays.

I know I don't.

RATH

You're very good at this aren't

you?

ESCORT

I think you're supposed to answer

that question.

RATH

I know what you expect, but I

don't want...

ESCORT

That's okay, hon, I always expect

the unexpected.

RATH

I called because I just want... I

need to talk.

RATH

I've been thinking about my life,

about things I have done... What I

do for a living is in some ways

similiar to what you do.

RATH

I know that everything has a

price.  I want you to understand

that I'm willing to pay.

ESCORT

For what?

RATH

Honesty.

RATH

I just want to ask you some

questions.

RATH

Do you ever regret things you've

done?

ESCORT

Everyone regrets something.

RATH

But when you finLsh a job,

afterwards do you think about

them?

ESCORT

Sometimes.

RATH

Do you think about their wives or

their families?

ESCORT

No.  They call me, I don't call

them.  If they didn't call I

wouldn't exist.

RATH

Do you ever think about starting

over?

ESCORT

All the time.

RATH

Can you tell me about it?

ESCORT

Sometimes I dream that I meet a

man, this good, honest man and we

fall in love.  I imagine us living

on a boat, reading books, sailing

to places where no one knows who

we were or cares what we did.

RATH

And what if you never meet that

man?

ESCORT

Then, I'll sail alone.

RATH

Do you believe that?

ESCORT

Are you asking me if I believe in

another life?

ESCORT

I have to.

ESCORT

Is that all you want?

RATH

Yes.

RATH

Thank you.

ESCORT

Anytime.

RATH

Fuck you, Nick.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Where have you been, Robert?

RATH/SCREEN

Sick.  The flu.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I don't believe you.

RATH

I don't give a fuck --

RATH/SCREEN

It's true.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I have been sitting on a contract

from Cleveland for six days

because of you.

RATH

Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck

your contracts --

RATH/SCREEN

I need a rest.

CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN

That's impossible, Robert.  You're

at the top of your field.  These

are the best contracts.  To stop

now would be self-destructive.

RATH/SCREEN

Send the file.  I'll have the

estimate tonight.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I'm worried about you, Robert.

RATH

You fucking should be --

RATH/SCREEN

Don't be.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

You're too late, Robert.

RATH/SCREEN

What?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

The contract was stolen.

RATH/SCREEN

Who?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

A new player.  He's using the name

Nicholai.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

You know what must be done.

LEEVIO

Don't!

BAIN

Don't anybody move.  You move,

you're dead.

BAIN

Come on, you chicken shit

motherfucker.  I know you're here.

Let's go.

BAIN

You!  Get up!

BAIN

You, too!  Up!

BAIN

Not yet.  Don't move or you're

fucking dead.

RATH

Shit.  Just do them all.  All of

them.  Shit.

BAIN

Now run!

RATH

Shit.  What are you doing, old man?

You're too fucking slow.

RATH

Okay.  Which one?  Which one is

yours?

RATH

Amateur.

BAIN

Fuck!

RATH

Your move.

BAIN

Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I give

up!

COP

Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread

your legs!

BAIN

Hey, don't touch that!

COP

Shut up!

RATH

Son of a bitch.

COP #2

This is 181, returning with suspect

involved in multiple shooting at

Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route

with suspect.

COP #2

Jesus Christ, do you know who you

shot in there?

COP #2

What are you?  Some kind of a

hitman?

COP #2

You know what we call guys like you?

COP #2

Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your

ass.

RATH

I'm not done yet.

RATH

This is 1242.  I got it.

BAIN

Is there a problem?

RATH

No.  No problem.  The airport,

right?

BAIN

Right.

RATH

How'd you cut yourself?

BAIN

Oh?  Working.  A little accident.

RATH

You a waiter?  You look like a

waiter.

BAIN

Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.

RATH

Where?

BAIN

What?

RATH

What restaurant?

BAIN

Uh, Fontella's

RATH

So you're from around here?

BAIN

No.  No I'm not.

RATH

Where you from?

BAIN

What is this?

RATH

Not too good at small talk, eh?

BAIN

Look, I'm real tired and I'm not

interested in fucking chit-chat.

RATH

I know just what you mean.  I'm

pretty beat myself.

RATH

Since you looked like a waiter, I

had to ask what restaurant because

of what happened at the Trattoria

Roma.

BAIN

Why?  What happened?

RATH

Didn't you here all them sirens?

It's been all over the radio.  Some

guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch

of bystanders, in the Trattoria

Roma.

BAIN

No shit.

RATH

Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli,

and I don't care what office he's

running for, the guy's a crook.  He

probably had it coming, but all the

other people.  Real sad.

BAIN

Yeah.

RATH

But they caught the guy.  I heard it

all.  Sounded like he just went

berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting

anybody.  Drugs, probably.

BAIN

Probably.

RATH

I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send

that S.O.B. right to the chair.

BAIN

Sizzle lean.

BAIN

What are you doing?

RATH

What?

BAIN

That was Peterson back there.  That

goes to the expressway for the

airport.

RATH

You're right.  Talking too much

again.

BAIN

Yeah well, you just blew your tip,

pal.

RATH

What?  You think I'm running you up?

BAIN

Just do your job.

BAIN

What are you doing?

RATH

Get out.  You think I'm running you

up?  Get out.

BAIN

You can't --

RATH

The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I

don't like you.  So, get the hell

out!

BAIN

Holy fucking shit!

BAIN

I get out, you got me.

BAIN

Now what?

RATH

We're both going to the airport.

RATH

Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

BAIN

No fucking way.

RATH

Okay, don't.

RATH

If either of us fucks around, the

other can blow the fuel line.

BAIN

Jesus -- I'm being driven to the

airport by Robert Rath.

BAIN

I can't believe this.  You rolled

some cabby for the radio, then

waited for an airport fare.

BAIN

Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're

a fucking genius.  Then you're just

sitting there, bullshitting with me.

Man, no way I coulda done that!

RATH

What's your name?  We both know it's

not Nicholai.

BAIN

Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to

know my name.

BAIN

Bain.  Michael Bain.

RATH

How long have you been freelance?

BAIN

Two years.  Two long fucking years.

BAIN

Hey.  What I don't get was why

didn't you take the shot inside the

restaurant?  I mean you had me, a

free shot.  That's what I would have

done.

RATH

It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty-

forty, at best.  Not my odds.

BAIN

Sounds like chickenshit --

BAIN

Listen to me calling you

chickenshit!

BAIN

Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs!

Wigs are the worst part of this job.

I'd rather dye my hair than wear a

wig.

RATH

You're wearing a wig now.

BAIN

God damn are you good.  Everyone

says you're so fucking good.  I just

can't believe I'm still alive.  If I

believed in God, I'd be down on my

knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come

you just didn't plug us all when we

came through the door?

BAIN

Shit if I was you, back there --

BAIN

Game over.

BAIN

Do you mind if I ask you a couple of

business questions?  You know I was

wondering how much you bid this job

at?

BAIN

You don't have to tell me that.

It's just, I know my bid was low,

but was it too low?  I mean, did I

seem like an amateur, like I didn't

know what I was doing?

RATH

We both know what you were doing.

BAIN

Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight

inch silencer.  Classic.  When I

first heard you used that, I

thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.

Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real

clean.

BAIN

Would you really blow us?

BAIN

Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this

has been driving me crazy for years

-- shit, listen to me.  I sound like

some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but

I just got to ask you.  Everybody

talks about how you left the Agency

and got into the business and then

how you went after the Russian,

Nicholai Talinkov --

RATH

Tachlinkov.

BAIN

Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a

fucking genius.  They said he shaded

you over and over.  And in the end,

he aced you again.  Shaded and

faded.  They say he's living on some

Greek island, but I say that's

fucking bullshit.  I say you're the

best and that you planted his ass.

Am I right?

BAIN

I bet I'm right.

BAIN

Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus

fucking Christ!

RATH

After those cops, you'll never be

able to come back to Cleveland.

BAIN

Who the fuck cares about Cleveland.

Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks

have they got here?  Greasy mobster,

teamster or some hand job

politician.  I want the money marks.

I want the marks that you get.

BAIN

So what happens now?

RATH

We go around once.

BAIN

Bullshit.

BAIN

You tell me that we're gonna go

around once, then, while I'm

checking out the lay of the land,

you bail out and send me flying over

the bridge.  Right?  Am I right?

RATH

Okay.

BAIN

What?  What's okay?

BAIN

What are you doing?

RATH

There's a sand barricade up ahead;

I'm going to ram this cab into it.

The cab has an airbag, odds are good

I'll survive.  But with this steel

casing and bullet proof glass, odds

for you are not so good.

BAIN

Oh man, that's sweet.  That's

fucking sweet.

BAIN

You're bluffing.

BAIN

You're fucking with me.  You want me

to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes

and bang -- Game over.

BAIN

No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to

jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm

stuck back here until it's too late.

Wham -- over!

RATH

I know you're going to jump.

RATH

You're still young.  Young enough to

still think you're indestructible.

Invincible.  You believe with utter

certainty you can bail out at the

last second and survive.

RATH

If you do survive, we'll see each

other again.

MAN (V.O.)

I don't give a shit what your mother

thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your

mother, I'm sleeping with you.

WOMAN (V.O.)

You won't be for long, with that

attitude.

MAN (V.O.)

Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god

damned worried about your mother's

approval, why don't you move back

home so she can pat you on the head

when you do something right.

ELECTRA

Jerk.

MAN (V.O.)

Oh good.  Go ahead and cry.

JENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.)

Would you please leave?

ELECTRA

Mmm, smell that, Nikita?

ELECTRA

I hope she saves some for us.

MAN (V.O.)

Do you think slamming doors is going

to help work this out?

MAN (V.O.)

I can slam doors too!

JENNIFER (O.S.)

Hello?  Ken, is that you?

JENNIFER (V.O.)

Hi, Mom, it's me.  Ken and I just

had a big fight.

ELECTRA

Crap.

WOMAN (V.O.)

Electra, they are not paying you to

sit at home and watch television.

ELECTRA

I wasn't watching television.

WOMAN (V.O.)

The point is, they are paying for

information.  Real information.  Not

tooth paste brands.  Not whether he

wads of folds his toilet paper.  And

no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.

You are wasting everyone's time with

this shit.

ELECTRA

I thought it was interesting --

WOMAN (V.O.)

God damnit, Electra.  This is not a

game.  This is business.

ELECTRA

Right.  In my hands I have five

back-up disks he made of all of his

work last night.

WOMAN (V.O.)

Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?

ELECTRA

I'll make my usual arrangements and

expect my usual bonus.

WOMAN (V.O.)

Electra --

ELECTRA

A pleasure doing business with you.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Hello, Robert.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I know what happened.

RATH

I bet you fucking know!

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

It cost us.

RATH

I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit!

Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking

gone!

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

He stole another contract.

RATH

I'm being set up.  Fucking set up!

RATH

Is this how it went, Nick?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Robert?  Robert?

RATH/SCREEN

How did he know?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Know what?

RATH/SCREEN

The fucking contract!  How in the

fuck did he know.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Such language in front of a lady.

RATH/SCREEN

I don't know what the fuck you are.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I know.  It was a joke.

RATH

A joke?  A joke?

RATH

You think this is a fucking joke?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

$1,000,000.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

That's the bonus on the contract.

RATH/SCREEN

Deadline?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese.

His retirement a condition of the

bonus.

RATH/SCREEN

Who is the mark?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance

specialist.

RATH

A player?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

We have an M.O... Her system is

protected by her 'pussy virus.'

RATH

Sorry.  My mistake.

RATH

Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that

black limo.  We're not sure which

hotel we're at, so could you just

follow them?

CABBY

Sure.

AKIRA

Hello?

ELECTRA (V.O.)

I trust your flight was comfortable?

AKIRA

Your Japanese is excellent.

ELECTRA (V.O.)

Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.

ELECTRA

I'll call you again in twenty

minutes.

ELECTRA

Excuse me, your Highness.

ELECTRA

Room 1414.

YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)

Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about

thirty minutes.  You're welcome.

ELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.)

Good morning, gentlemen.  I

apologize for the arrangement, but

we all know those aren't business

cards you're reaching for.  If

anyone leaves this room, the deal's

off.

RATH

One vegetarian plate and a can of

tuna fish.  Room 1014.

ELECTRA

Ten thousand dollars per disk.

Insert the first disk now.

BAIN

Yes!

BAIN

Surprise!

ELECTRA

Oh, God.

AKIRA

Don't kill me.

BAIN (V.O.)

Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust

anyone these days.

RATH

Don't be stupid and you will live.

RATH

Hurry.

RATH

Turn here.

RATH

How many bodies were there?

ELECTRA

What?

RATH

He has to clean up.  How many bodies

were there?

ELECTRA

Um, five.

RATH

One hour per man.

BAIN

Hi.  This is room 1414 --

BAIN

Yes, could you send up a pot of

coffee and my friends are going to

need some more towels.  Thanks.

RATH

Get on the expressway.

ELECTRA

Where are we going?

RATH

Nowhere yet.

ELECTRA

Nikita, hush.

ELECTRA

She won't stop unless you let her

out.

RATH

Nikita?  She helped me find you.

ELECTRA

What?  How did you know I had a cat?

RATH

Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I

guessed right.

ELECTRA

Who the fuck are you?  Who do you

work for?

RATH

I work for the government.

ELECTRA

Yeah?

ELECTRA

Bullshit.

RATH

Yeah.

ELECTRA

You're one of them, aren't you?  A

fucking pro.

RATH

I'm part of the game, just like you.

ELECTRA

Jesus!

ELECTRA

What do you think you're doing?

RATH

Twenty large?  That's all?

ELECTRA

What do you mean, 'that's all'?

What in the hell do you know?

RATH

The bonus on the contract for you

was one million dollars.

RATH

Slow down.

RATH

I figure that means these are worth

ten times that, maybe more.

ELECTRA

Ten million --

RATH

Now you understand why I'm here.

RATH

I really think you should slow down.

BELLBOY

Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage

you need carried.

BAIN

Indeed I do.

ELECTRA

Now what?

RATH

Turn off the engine.

ELECTRA

You want me to pump?

RATH

No, stay in the car.  I want you to

understand something.  If I intended

to kill you, you would already be

dead.

ELECTRA

Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think,

breathe, think...

ELECTRA

Come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

RATH

Oh shit.

ELECTRA

Please, please.

RATH

Dammit.

JENNIFER

Excuse me --

JENNIFER

You live here, don't you?

JENNIFER

I'm sorry, this may sound really

weird, but my friend told me he

slipped a letter under the door here

and I was wondering if you happened

to see it?

ELECTRA

Letter?

JENNIFER

Yeah.  He said he saw a woman with

dark hair going into the building

when he dropped it off.

ELECTRA

No.  I don't have it.

JENNIFER

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to -- I'm

sorry.

BAIN (V.O.)

Oh, you sick little bitch --

BAIN

Fuck me!

RATH

Want a drink?

RATH

Okay...

RATH

I'm not good at this sort of thing,

but we don't have a lot of time, so

I'll just go ahead and get started.

First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is

she thinking?'

RATH

Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost

been killed twice and now she is

alone in a room with a man that she

believes is an... assassin.

RATH

Furthermore she was brought here not

entirely on her own accord which

only increases her fear and

suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is

afraid, her first, maybe her only

thought will be escape.  Does that

leave me any other option?

RATH

No.

RATH

The gun is silenced.  She could

shoot me right now.

RATH

She could take the car and be far

from here before the maid comes in

the morning, but --

ELECTRA

Shut up!

ELECTRA

Stop trying to tell me what I'm

thinking!

ELECTRA

I'll tell you what you're thinking

-- you think I'm not going to shoot

you but right now you're not so

sure, are you?

ELECTRA

You're thinking that maybe it was a

mistake to give me this gun, that

maybe I'm not going to think about

things logically because I'm a woman

and I'm freaked out and I'm going to

do something impulsive and

irrational -- right?

ELECTRA

You don't know shit about me!  Now

sit down!

ELECTRA

Okay.  How did you find me?

RATH

You're the computer hacker, you tell

me.

ELECTRA

You didn't know anything about me.

ELECTRA

Nikita?

RATH

Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian.

There aren't that many.

ELECTRA

You're one of them, aren't you?

RATH

'Them'?

ELECTRA

An assassin?

RATH

Until a minute ago.

ELECTRA

What does that mean?

RATH

If I still was what I used to be,

you would not be pointing that at

me.

ELECTRA

Who is that other guy?

RATH

Another contractor.

ELECTRA

Someone hired both of you?

RATH

No.  They hired Bain.  The contract

would have been mine, but Bain took

it from me as he took the previous

one.

ELECTRA

So this is something between you and

him?

RATH

He stole the contract knowing that

I would come after him.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because he is trying to retire me.

ELECTRA

He wants to kill you?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

The nature of the business.  You

remove your competition.

ELECTRA

And you want to use me to get him?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

Forget it!

RATH

We don't have a choice.

ELECTRA

Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

RATH

Right.

ELECTRA

I'm two seconds away from making my

choice which means you've got two

seconds to tell me why I shouldn't

shoot you.

RATH

It's simple.  You need me.  I need

you.  And we will both need money.

ELECTRA

I don't need you to get the money --

my money!

RATH

If it hadn't been for me, you would

be dead.

ELECTRA

I don't need the money.

RATH

This is something that is never

going to end.  You can never work in

the business again with this

contract, because he will find you.

To survive, you have to go into deep

hiding.  And that's going to take

money, a lot of money.

ELECTRA

Then you can have the disks and I'll

just walk out that door --

RATH

If you walk out that door, Bain will

still come after you.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because he took a contract on you.

He'll come for you and he'll find

you.

ELECTRA

You don't know that -- you're trying

to scare me.

RATH

No.  It's the truth.  I know what

you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're

a ghost, you're not part of the real

world.  You don't have a social

security number.  You don't pay

taxes.  You've probably used ten

different names over the last ten

years.  A long time ago something

probably happened, something illegal

and you ran, you disappeared and it

was easy.  You think you can do it

again.  But I'm telling you, fading

from the law is nothing.  No matter

what you do, where you go, I swear

to you that Bain will find you.

ELECTRA

How?

RATH

Right now, as we sit here, he is

tearing through your apartment.  He

is digging through your drawers,

emptying your closets.  He will take

your telephone and address books,

your appointment books.  If you keep

a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go

into the kitchen and find out what

kind of food you eat, liquor you

drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the

bathroom he will find any

prescription drugs you take and

where you get them filled.  If you

have video tape or recordings he

will watch and listen to all of

them.

ELECTRA

Oh Jesus Jesus...

RATH

He will know everything about you.

Everything.  I know, because I've

done it.  Once you've been inside a

mark's home, you're in their head.

If you're any good, you'll find the

mark in a week, and Bain is good

because I was the best and I

couldn't take him.

ELECTRA

Shut up!  All right!  You've said

enough!

ELECTRA

I need to think... To be alone.

ELECTRA

Oh shit, Nikita.

ELECTRA

Cheers.

ELECTRA

Listen -- I don't even know your

name.

RATH

Rath.  Robert Rath.

ELECTRA

Electra.

RATH

Just Electra?

ELECTRA

Yeah.

RATH

As in daughter of Agamemnon?

ELECTRA

No.  Just Electra.

ELECTRA

What I'm trying to say is that --

I'm not sure I can do this, help

you, unless I know more about you.

RATH

What do you want to know?

ELECTRA

If Bain hadn't taken the contract on

me, would you have?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because I'm done.

ELECTRA

This is crazy.  I can't trust you.

You can't trust me.  How can we

possibly help each other?

RATH

Do you play?

ELECTRA

With computers.

RATH

It's not the same, is it?

ELECTRA

Better than playing with yourself.

RATH

I had an opponent.

ELECTRA

Had?

RATH

He was Russian.  Nicholai

Tachlinkov.  A legend in the

business when I was just starting.

I admired him.  When I heard he

loved chess I became obsessed with

the game.

ELECTRA

He was white?

ELECTRA

It looks like white's game.

RATH

We played with a code using

The New

York Times

obituaries.  Over three

years we played twelve matches.  I

never won.

ELECTRA

Why didn't you finish this game?

RATH

He was... taken.

ELECTRA

He was killed.

ELECTRA

By who?

RATH

I killed him.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because that's how it works.  That's

what it's about.  He was the best.

He was on top.

ELECTRA

Where you wanted to be?

RATH

Yes.  As soon as you get into this

business, all you can think about is

getting to the top.  That's all

there is.  Until then, there is

nothing.  You are nothing.

ELECTRA

How did you get into the business?

RATH

The same way everyone does; the

government, the Agency.

ELECTRA

The C.I.A.?

RATH

More or less.

ELECTRA

How old were you?

RATH

They recruited me when I was in high

school.

ELECTRA

Jesus -- why?

RATH

Languages.  I was already fluent in

nine languages.

ELECTRA

You were like a boy genius?

RATH

Some people said that.  I never

thought so.

ELECTRA

Why not?

RATH

I was just different.

ELECTRA

You went from high school to the

Agency?

RATH

No.  I graduated from George

Washington University.  Then I

entered the Agency training program.

ELECTRA

They didn't give you a choice, did

they?

RATH

No, they didn't.

ELECTRA

But you knew what they were training

you for?

RATH

Of course.  I was going to be James

Bond.

ELECTRA

Ahhhh...

RATH

They are very good at what they do.

It's very seductive.  The training,

the weapons, the travel --

ELECTRA

The exotic women.

RATH

Women?  No... not really.

ELECTRA

Why not?

RATH

Women... I don't... I don't want to

talk about women.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because you are a women.

ELECTRA

Why did you leave the Agency?

RATH

The same reason everyone does.  You

hear your name on C-SPAN and you

realize you're a skeleton in

someone's closet and they're coming

to bury you.

ELECTRA

They tried to kill you?

RATH

Yes.  It didn't matter much to them

as long as I disappeared.

ELECTRA

Then you went freelance?

RATH

The only thing different about the

private sector is that a General

Contractor takes less of a

percentage than the government, so

you make more money.  Then once you

make the transition, you realize you

were never working for the

government; it was always the

private sector, the vested interests

and it's the same vested interests

that continue to buy your plane

tickets.

ELECTRA

Tell me about the first time.

RATH

My first take?

ELECTRA

Yes.

RATH

Why?

ELECTRA

Because I want to know.

RATH

It was... mechanical.  Very precise.

It was exactly like the training

drill except for the adrenaline.

ELECTRA

Are they usually like that?

RATH

No.  Just the first one.

ELECTRA

After that?

RATH

They become complicated... messy.

ELECTRA

Did it ever bother you?

RATH

Did it ever bother James Bond?

ELECTRA

That's fiction.

RATH

This is fiction!  Don't you see

that?  This is another reality.  And

the people that come into the world

to play this game -- nobody forces

them!  They're here, they know the

rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do

you understand what I am saying?  No

one is innocent -- including you!

ELECTRA

Does that mean it didn't bother you?

RATH

You get a job swinging a hammer, the

first day you get a blister, it

tears open, it bleeds and it stays

sore a long time.  You keep swinging

the hammer, you get a good hard

callous that covers that spot and it

never bothers you again.

RATH

Check.

RATH

Is that what you wanted to hear?

Something cold blooded... something

remorseless...

ELECTRA

No.  Something honest.

ELECTRA

Mate.

ELECTRA

I hope your plan is better than your

game.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Where have you been, Michael?

BAIN/SCREEN

Tracking the mark.

BAIN

I'm on the scent.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

You're too late.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

I've learned from MicroCell, Rath

fulfilled the contract.

BAIN/SCREEN

How?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

He took out the mark and sold the

disks back to MicroCell.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Michael?

BAIN

No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

They money will be standard bank

transfer.  We believe we will know

where and when.

BAIN

What?

BAIN/SCREEN

How?

BAIN/SCREEN

How in the fuck do you know that?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Such language in front of a lady.

BAIN

I don't give a fuck what you are.  I

asked you --

BAIN

(types)

How in the fuck do you know that?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Do you want Rath or not?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

It will take three days to arrange

the transfer.

ELECTRA

Three days?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Which account?

ELECTRA

Are you going to tell him?

RATH

It.  Tell it.  For all I know it

could be a machine.

ELECTRA

You said you didn't trust it.

RATH

I don't.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Which account?

ELECTRA

What kind of bank is going to allow

us to withdraw ten million dollars

the day it is transferred?

RATH

The kind preferred by drug

smugglers, arms dealers and

politicians.

RATH

Do you have a passport?

ELECTRA

Several.

RATH

Good.

ELECTRA

Where is it?

RATH

Mexico.

ELECTRA

God, I love first class.  I remember

when I was a little girl, I would

wonder what it was like up here.  I

would always try to peek through the

curtains.

ELECTRA

I hope Nikita's all right.

ELECTRA

Hey, where are you?

RATH

Thinking.

ELECTRA

About?

RATH

Nothing.

ELECTRA

I've never been to the Gulf of

Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?

RATH

I don't know.

ELECTRA

You were there?

RATH

Yes.

RATH

(in Spanish)

Good afternoon.  We have

reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in

Costa Blanca.

CABBY

(in Spanish)

Yes, sir.

RATH

(in Spanish)

No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

CABBY

(in Spanish)

Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

RATH

(in Spanish)

No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the

city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.

CABBY

(in Spanish)

I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there

was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.

This is the new Hotel Paraiso.

RATH

(in Spanish)

Take us there.

ELECTRA

So, that's where all that S & L

money is?

RATH

That's where he'll be.

ELECTRA

What?

RATH

I wasn't expecting this.  I need to

think.

ELECTRA

Did you see them?

ELECTRA

They looked like they were in love.

ELECTRA

Well, I think I'll take a bath.

Come on, Nikita!

ELECTRA

That felt great.  You should try it.

ELECTRA

Don't you ever get tired of playing

the same game?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

Why not?

RATH

It helps me to focus.  It centers

me, helps me think.

ELECTRA

Oh.  What do you think about?

RATH

Work.  The things I need to get

done.

ELECTRA

Do you think about the game?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

But you've never figured out a way

to win.

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

Not even a stalemate?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

What happens if you do?

ELECTRA

Can I ask you something?

ELECTRA

What will you do if this works, if

we get the money?

RATH

I don't know... maybe I'll live on a

boat, sail to all the places I've

never been.

ELECTRA

That sounds nice.

ELECTRA

I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like

to try and get some sleep.

RATH

You can have the bed.  The chair is

fine for me.

ELECTRA

Thanks.

ELECTRA

Do you think he's here?

RATH

Here?

ELECTRA

In Costa Blanca.

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

What do you think he's doing?

RATH

I don't know... But I'm sure he's

not sleeping.

BAIN

You're dead, motherfucker.

RATH

Breakfast.

ELECTRA

Why don't you bring it out here?

It's beautiful out here.

ELECTRA

I know what you are thinking.  I'm

not going to disappear, okay?  I'm

not going anywhere, just down there,

to that beautiful beach.  I got to

get out of this room, just for a

little while.

RATH

Okay.

ELECTRA

Really?

RATH

He won't be looking for you.  Just

be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your

sunglasses on.

ELECTRA

Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.

RATH

You should knock.

ELECTRA

Sorry.

RATH

How was the beach?

ELECTRA

The beach?  It was nice.

ELECTRA

That was beautiful.

ELECTRA

Tai Chi, right?

ELECTRA

Where did you learn it?

RATH

Taiwan.

ELECTRA

Not that I would know, but you look

like you're really good at it.

RATH

Thank you.

ELECTRA

I've always wanted to learn

something like that.

RATH

You should.  It's very important,

that the body release the energy

that builds in it.

RATH

I'm going to shower.  If you're

hungry, go ahead and order some

dinner.

RATH

I'm going to call.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Hello, Robert.

RATH/SCREEN

The contract?

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Paid in full.

ELECTRA

Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Transferred to the specified

account.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN

Goodbye, Robert.

RATH

Sit down.

RATH

Okay --

ELECTRA

Two way?

RATH

Transmits and receives.

ELECTRA

Cheap as shit.

RATH

I paid a lot for these.

ELECTRA

They saw you coming a mile away.  If

I had known we'd be using --

RATH

It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have

to deal with these.

ELECTRA

Fine.

RATH

This is the bank.  This is the

hotel.  In the morning I will enter

the bank.

ELECTRA

Check.

RATH

He will be hidden somewhere out

here, probably somewhere low, in the

crowd.  He'll stay there until he

sees me enter the bank.

ELECTRA

But he won't shoot you right then?

RATH

No.  It would be amateur.  A risk.

He'll wait for the prime shot, that

he knows is coming.  Once I'm

inside, he'll move to the hotel.

He'll go up the back, too much

traffic in the front.

RATH

You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A

public place far enough away that he

won't notice you, but with a good

enough view you'll be able to see

him when he moves inside.

ELECTRA

Okay.  Then what?

RATH

Then, we wait.

ELECTRA

Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know

if I like this plan.

RATH

It will take the entire day, but he

will begin to doubt himself.  He

will begin to believe that he missed

me, that somehow I slipped by and am

already on a plane to Europe.

RATH

The sun will be low, almost dark,

the air cool and the bank will

almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He

will put the rifle down, he will get

up and he will walk across the plaza

to the bank.

ELECTRA

Why won't he wait until the bank

closes?

RATH

He won't be able to.  He'll have to

go inside.  He'll have to see with

his own eyes, whether or not I am

there.  If the bank closes, he won't

know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm

sure.  And when he does you'll go

into the hotel, go upstairs and take

the gun.

ELECTRA

What?  What if he brings it with

him?

RATH

He can't.  The bank has an expensive

security system; metal detectors and

X-ray machines.

ELECTRA

That means you won't have a gun.

RATH

That's right.

ELECTRA

And with the mikes, I'll tell you

when he leaves the hotel and you'll

tell me when he leaves the bank.

RATH

If things go well, I don't have to.

You'll already be in a rented car

waiting for me.

ELECTRA

You'll have the money.  How do I

know that you won't --

RATH

I'll be walking out of the bank,

unarmed.  You'll have the gun and

I'll drive the car.

ELECTRA

We split the money?

RATH

Five million apiece.  You get on

your plane, I get on mine.

ELECTRA

Sounds pretty well figured out.

RATH

I've been thinking about it for a

long time.

ELECTRA

Except --

RATH

What?

ELECTRA

Except, if he doesn't come out of

the hotel.

RATH

I told you, he will.

ELECTRA

You can't know for sure, how can

you?  I mean, you're not him.

RATH

I was.

RATH

Ten years ago, I sat there in that

same hotel window, sweat pouring off

of me waiting --

ELECTRA

For Nicholai?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

You killed him here?  In this city,

outside that bank?

ELECTRA

What is it?  I don't like this at

all.  What is going on here?

RATH

I don't know.  It just happened.  I

was here ten years ago, I'm here

now.  That's it.

ELECTRA

I don't believe that.

RATH

It wasn't planned or premeditated.

I swear.  Things happened beyond my

control.  I understood; I saw where

they were leading and I suppose that

it just made sense.

ELECTRA

Ten years ago.

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

What happened?

RATH

I waited until I was insane and then

I walked into the bank.  He was

sitting there, very calm, waiting

for me.

ELECTRA

What did he want?

RATH

He wanted what I want now; to get

out of the business.  To disappear

to some empty Greek island.

RATH

What did he say?

RATH

He said I couldn't win.  That no one

wins at this game.

ELECTRA

Was that it?

RATH

Then he offered me one million

dollars to walk away, to quit the

business.

ELECTRA

You didn't take it.

RATH

No.  I went back to the hotel.  And

waited.

ELECTRA

Ten years later, here you are again.

RATH

Yes.  Here I am again.

ELECTRA

This has been the longest day of my

life.

ELECTRA

Do you have ulcers?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

I think I got one today.

RATH

Five million dollars will buy a lot

of Rolaids.

ELECTRA

What do you suppose he's doing now?

RATH

Why did you trade a bishop for a

knight?

ELECTRA

I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I

like knights.

RATH

They're worth less points.

ELECTRA

So?

ELECTRA

Do you hear them?

ELECTRA

Listen.

ELECTRA

Did you think they were newlyweds?

RATH

I didn't notice them.

ELECTRA

When I first saw them I thought they

were married.

RATH

How do you know they're not?

ELECTRA

I went into their room this

afternoon.

RATH

What?

ELECTRA

It was no big deal.  I saw them

leave, I went in.

RATH

Jesus, if someone had --

ELECTRA

Nobody ever sees me.

RATH

Why in the hell would you take that

chance?

ELECTRA

I heard them last night and it made

me want to know something about

them.  I wanted to, so I did.

ELECTRA

She is married, but not to him.

Another man, much older.  She has

four kids.  The young guy works for

her.  And I think she likes kinky

sex.

RATH

Thank you.

ELECTRA

Isn't it interesting though?  I

mean, look at us, in this room.  Or

yesterday, when we were walking in

the plaza market.  I mean, we look

like just another couple.  But what

are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

No?

RATH

It's always been that way.  The

world has always functioned on two

levels.

ELECTRA

I know.  It makes me crazy.

RATH

Why?

ELECTRA

I don't know.  When I was in

college, I was forced to go to a

psychiatrist because I was caught

drilling holes in my dorm room

floor.

RATH

And you were drilling these

holes...?

ELECTRA

So I could watch the girl that lived

under me.

RATH

Apparently this doctor was unable to

cure you.

ELECTRA

He told me that my curiosity became

unnaturally entangled with my sense

of self-preservation.

RATH

Did he explain how this happened?

ELECTRA

He believed it all went back to one

night, when as a little girl.  I

watched my parents have this big

fight, really big.  I thought my

mother was going to kill my father.

Then they went into their room and

made up.  And I watched them make

love through the keyhole.

RATH

What are you doing?

ELECTRA

What?

RATH

That's a ridiculous move.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Because, I'll take it.

ELECTRA

I'm playing white, remember.  You

can't tell me which pieces to move.

It doesn't work that way.

ELECTRA

Can I ask you something?

RATH

I'm sure you will.

ELECTRA

Am I attractive?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

Are you attracted to me?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

Why?

RATH

Why?  I don't know.

ELECTRA

Is it a physical thing, or a mental

thing?

RATH

Both.

ELECTRA

Is that why you didn't want to talk

about women before?

RATH

I didn't want to complicate the

situation.

ELECTRA

Attraction is a complication?

RATH

It can be.

ELECTRA

It happened to you before?

RATH

Yes.

ELECTRA

Who was she?

RATH

Someone like me, like you.  A pro.

ELECTRA

What happened to her?

RATH

She was taken.

ELECTRA

Did you --

RATH

No.  I tried to stop it.  I

couldn't.

ELECTRA

Was she the only one?

RATH

After her, I realized that to

survive I had to live without...

It's dangerous to let things become

complicated.

ELECTRA

Is this becoming complicated?

RATH

I'm not sure that I care anymore.

ELECTRA

Were you attracted to me right away?

RATH

No.

ELECTRA

When did it start?

RATH

Honestly?

ELECTRA

Uh-huh.

RATH

When I gave you my gun and you

almost shot me.

ELECTRA

Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

RATH

Why?

ELECTRA

That doesn't sound normal.

RATH

I'm not normal.

ELECTRA

I know.  That's why I'm attracted to

you.  I mean, you make me nervous.

You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my

curiosity/self-preservation thing,

but all I can really think about

right now is kissing you.

ELECTRA

I wanted to tell you --

ELECTRA

My real name is Anna.

RATH

Martin.

ELECTRA

Martin.

ELECTRA

Nice to meet you, Martin.

DISSOLVE TO:

RATH (V.O.)

All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll

move now.  How are you doing?

ELECTRA

I'm ready.

RATH

Good.

TELLER

May I help you?

RATH

Yes.  Could you check on a transfer

for me?

TELLER

Your name, or account?

RATH

Rath.  Robert Rath.

OFFICIAL

Senor Rath, we have received your

transfer.

RATH

Good.  Now I'll need to close this

account.  I'd like you to ready the

paperwork.

OFFICIAL

You wish to close this account

today?

RATH

That's correct.

OFFICIAL

How would you like the funds?

RATH

American currency.

OFFICIAL

This will take some time.

RATH

I have all day.

ELECTRA

He's here.

ELECTRA

He's inside.

RATH

Now, we wait.

BAIN

Shit.

DISSOLVE TO:

BAIN

What in the fuck are you doing in

there?

BAIN

That's not him.  Jesus, Bain, baby,

chill the fuck out.

OFFICIAL

Your signature, senor.  Everything

is ready.

OFFICIAL

Excellent, senor.  If you could

follow me?

RATH

I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an

associate.  Can you hold everything

for me until he arrives?

OFFICIAL

Of course, senor.

RATH

Thank you.

ELECTRA

Ten million dollars, sitting there.

Waiting... this is insane.

BAIN

This is fucking insane.

BAIN

Fucking God dammit!

ELECTRA

Oh my God.

ELECTRA

He's coming.

RATH

Four minutes.

ELECTRA

What?

RATH

I waited another four minutes.

ELECTRA

Shit.

RATH

Wait until he is on the stairs.

ELECTRA

Right.

RATH

I'm taking off my mike.

ELECTRA

Okay.

RATH

Electra --

ELECTRA

What?

RATH

Last night --

ELECTRA

Was nice.

RATH

Yes.

BAIN

How'd you know?  Just tell me that.

How'd you fucking know?

RATH

I knew the same way in ten years

you're going to know.

BAIN

What does that fucking mean?

RATH

It means that I'm going to tell you

things, even though I already know

that you're not going to listen to a

God damned thing I say.

RATH

It's irony.  That's what it is.  But

the real irony is that you won't

know it's irony until you're sitting

over here.

RATH

When you walked in here and you saw

me, sitting here, waiting; the first

thing that went through your head

was that you were a dead man.

RATH

You're thinking that you've been

sold out.  That's the only way I

could know you were out there.  Why

would you think this?  Because you

don't trust your contractor.  You

don't trust anyone.  It's automatic.

It's the first and last commandment.

It's the only thing that keeps you

alive.  So, try as I might to tell

you the truth, you can't believe me.

Do you see the irony of the

situation?  It's kind of funny,

isn't it?

RATH

Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago,

you contacted your contractor, who

told you that they knew when and

where I was going to pick up the

transferred money from MicroCell.

You don't know how they got the

information.  It bothered you, but

you didn't care.  How do I know

this?  Because ten years ago, I was

sitting in that chair, as scared

shitless as you are now.

BAIN

I ain't scared of you.

RATH

Yeah you are and you hate it.  You

hate the fact that your hand is

shaking and mine isn't.  That you're

sweating your balls off and I'm not.

You've got fear and hate in your

belly like battery acid, all because

of me.

BAIN

If you think you can take me, quit

fucking bullshitting and try it.

RATH

All right, Bain.  Pay attention,

because this is where everything

changes.

RATH

You're a businessman, right?  This

is a business deal.  Behind that

counter, I have over ten million

dollars.  I'll give you half of it,

more money than you'll make in the

next ten years if, you walk away.

BAIN

Five million dollars?

RATH

That's right.

BAIN

Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.

RATH

Did you see how I did that?  Magic

wasn't it?

BAIN

What?

RATH

You understand what's going on?  It

makes sense, right?

BAIN

Oh, yeah.

RATH

What I just said, no assassin would

say.  What I've said, only a mark

would say.

BAIN

You think I would be an idiot to

pass up five million dollars.

RATH

You would be.

BAIN

You don't know a fucking thing about

me.  You don't have the slightest

fucking clue.

RATH

Why don't you tell me.

BAIN

I'll tell you this.  After

Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to

be alive.  But now, here, I just

realized that you were the lucky

one.

RATH

Now I'll tell you something.  It

wouldn't fucking matter if I offered

you one hundred million dollars.

You'd still be thinking the same

thing, that you're going to take me.

And here I am, sitting through this,

knowing it's bullshit, looking at

you and the only thing going on in

my mind, the only thing I can think

is that, in just a few minutes I'm

going to take you.

BAIN

Yeah, okay!  I'm ready!  Let's

fucking go!

RATH (V.O.)

Electra?

RATH

Electra?

ELECTRA

God, I can't find it!  I can't find

it!  I can't find the fucking gun!

ELECTRA

It wasn't with his other stuff!

RATH

Electra, get out.

RATH (V.O.)

He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

ELECTRA

Oh, God.  I see it!

RATH (V.O.)

Electra, listen!  You have got to

come to the bank for the money!  The

money!

RATH

Electra!

RATH (V.O.)

Electra!

RATH

Electra, what's happening?  What are

you --

OFFICIAL

Finido, senor.

BAIN

You're gonna take me?  Come on!

Come on, motherfucker!

BAIN

Take this!  Take this, you fuck!

BAIN

Motherfucker!

BAIN

Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-

gameover-comeon.

OFFICIAL

We are closed, senor.  Thank you for

banking with us.

BAIN

Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of

mark meat!  Come on, come on.  It's

over!  I know it!  You know it!  We

know it!

BAIN

Lift your head, motherfucker.

BAIN

Look up here.

BAIN

Look up.  Look at me.  I want to see

your face.

BAIN

Yes.

BAIN

Wha --

RATH

Electra.

BAIN

Die, bitch!

BAIN

Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you

doing?  I don't believe this is

happening!

BAIN

You're dead!  You're fucking dead!

I'm going to kill you a hundred

fucking times for this!

BAIN

Game over, bitch!

RATH

Bain!

BAIN

Fuck no!

RATH

Shit!

RATH

Electra!

RATH

Electra!

RATH

Down!  Get down!

BAIN

Game --

RATH

Electra!

RATH

The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid

of it!  Throw it!

BAIN (O.S.)

Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy.

BAIN (O.S.)

Are you still thinking that you're

going to take me?

BAIN (O.S.)

No, I don't think you are.  You know

what I think?

BAIN (O.S.)

I think you're thinking what I'm

thinking.

BAIN (O.S.)

You know what I'm thinking,

Bobby-boy?!

BAIN (O.S.)

You know what I'm thinking?!

RATH

Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

RATH

Game over.

FADE OUT.

THE END
