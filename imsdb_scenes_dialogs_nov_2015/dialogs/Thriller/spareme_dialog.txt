FADE IN

THEO (VO)

When you hear thunder...

THEO (VO)

...God is bowling.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOWLING BALL

A slow motion low tracking shot of a

bowling ball hitting a polished lane.

BOWLING PINS

Close-up of the milky white surface of

two bowling pins on opposite sides of the

lane - a seven-ten split. The RUMBLING

ball is heard in the distance like a

furious hulking steamroller of doom. The

pins begin to tremble, and then transform

into a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls

burst into flame.

BALL

The ball blasts past the camera and

metamorphoses into Theo's car.

RAPID DISSOLVE TO:

BURNING DOLLS

The flaming couple stand in the middle of

the bridge. Theo's car hits the pair and

they fly into the air in slow-motion. A

distant SOUND of pins scattering is

heard. The two dolls smoke as they spin

into the sky, then hit the water with

dual HISSES.

DISSOLVE TO:

ALFIE

I'm an addict. I can't go through a day

without the stuff. Theo reaches over and

pours for him with a steady hand.

ALFIE

You're not from around here, are you?

THEO

I'm from Akron.

ALFIE

You a bowler?

THEO

I'm looking for a man.

ALFIE

What kind of man?

THEO

A bowler.

SID

Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

THEO

I'm not here to bowl.

SID

(gesturing to Theo's bag)

You drag that coconut around for your

health, or do you know how to use it?

THEO

(bristling at the challenge)

I'm looking for somebody.

BREEZE

Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?

SID

No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.

THEO

I'm looking for Buzz Fazeli.

BREEZE

Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

SID

What do you want with old man Faz?

THEO

Some unfinished business.

SID

If you wanna do business in this town,

there's other people around here got more

weight than old Faz.

DWARF

Evening Sid, evening Breeze.

SID

Evening Tina.

BREEZE

Good luck tonight Tina.

THEO

You guys got something going on

downstairs?

SID

We provide some extracurricular

activities for the senior citizens in the

community.

THEO

Basement bingo?

SID

(smirks)

Yeah, basement bingo.

BREEZE

Lemme see your ball.

THEO

Let go of my bag.

BREEZE

Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.

SID

You afraid we're gonna steal it?

THEO

I said, let go of my bag.

SID

Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!

THEO

Tell your little pal to let go.

SID

Breeze, give him his ball back!

THEO

Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?

BREEZE

Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge,

past the Peter Pan, last house on the

dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid

drops to his knees and cradles his

damaged hand.

BREEZE

Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.

THEO

It belonged to my dad.

THEO

Is Mr. Fazeli in please?

MILLIE

Who wants to know?

(to dog)

Zeus!

THEO

I'm a bowler.

MILLIE

I'm sick of you people. Why don't you

leave him be?

BUZZ (OS)

Let him in, Millie. And don't frisk him.

MILLIE

Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I

leave the door wide open. Let the parade

begin!

BUZZ

Clam it!

BUZZ

Hey, rat. C'mere.

MILLIE

Jerk.

BUZZ

Sit down.

BUZZ

Buzz Fazeli.

THEO

Theo.

BUZZ

I know your face, you're an up-and-comer.

You bowl on the tour.

THEO

I'm not on the tour this year.

BUZZ

(nods understandingly)

Need some advice, huh.

THEO

Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress

says I'm a thorn in their side.

BUZZ

(dismissive wave)

Don't worry about the Congress, they're

just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.

MILLIE

(under her breath)

Get that outta your mouth!

THEO

They suspended me.

BUZZ

Why'd they suspend you?

THEO (VO)

It wasn't really my fault.

JUDGE (VO)

The American Bowling Congress hereby

suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all

professional bowling activities within

the jurisdiction of the American Bowling

Congress and its international co-

signers... The ball mashes into the

smirking mans head, causing it to snap

forward. The judge's gavel BANGS and the

crowd ROARS.

BUZZ

I got suspended when I was young, too. I

was pretty cocky in my day.

THEO

They suspended me for 100 years.

BUZZ

100 years!

(knits his brow)

THEO

I can appeal in five. I was hoping you

could help me Mr. Fazeli.

BUZZ

(uneasy)

What do you think I can do?

THEO

(sweating slightly)

I need a sponsor to get my sanction card

back. Where I come from, you're the king.

BUZZ

Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy

could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't

do any good for me to talk to the

Congress.

(briskly changing subject)

Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?

THEO

I've never had orange whips, I'm from

Akron.

CUT TO:

MILLIE

He's the guy Buzz.

BUZZ

He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the

whips.

MILLIE

I looked in his car. He's got pictures of

you, clippings, maps.

BUZZ

Bowlers don't go around killing other

bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll

give him some tips and an autograph and

he's outta here.

MILLIE

You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz?

You're doing something dangerous in that

alley.

BUZZ

Millie, I know what I'm doing.

MILLIE

We should leave this town. I can't take

this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill

you in my house.

THEO

Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You

had a seven-ten split in the final frame.

BUZZ

Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.

THEO

Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it.

The toughest shot on the last frame.

BUZZ

That game was before you was born.

THEO

My mom was there. She told me about it.

The 'Fazeli Split.'

BUZZ

And the irony is, thirty years later,

that prick is bowling in the seniors on

TV all over the world, and look at me. Ah

well. The docs made me stop, on account

of my ticker.

(taps his chest)

I don't really miss it, but then...

(chokes up)

...I miss it.

BUZZ

Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods.

Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so

that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo

takes the other glass.

THEO

Thanks.

ZEUS

Zeus is on the sofa, GROWLING and tugging

at Theo's bowling bag. The bag rips apart

and the ball hits the floor.

ORANGE WHIP

Theo brings the drink to his lips. The

ball rolls across the room.

BUZZ

The ball rolls into Buzz's feet.

BUZZ

This your lucky bullet?

BUZZ

(with intensity)

Where'd you get this ball?

THEO

(stunned - looks at the mess on

the floor, then at Buzz)

It's mine.

BUZZ

Who gave it to you?

THEO

Grace Skinner.

BUZZ

(astonished)

Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to

you?

THEO

She's my mom.

BUZZ

(regaining his voice)

Who are you? Who sent you here?

THEO

I'm your son. You're a hard father to

find.

MILLIE

Son?

BUZZ

(to Millie)

Millie, please.

(to Theo)

I don't have a son.

I think you better leave now young man.

Buzz gestures towards the front door.

THEO

(calmly)

Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember

her?

BUZZ

I don't know no Grace Skinner.

THEO

(pulls his arm away)

You knew her. You married her in 1963.

MILLIE

Married?

BUZZ

You're a bullshit artist, that's what you

are. You got no right to be here! Theo

yanks the trophy away from Buzz.

THEO

I got a right. You're my father.

BUZZ

I ain't nobody's father!

MILLIE

(noticing Zeus)

ZEUS!

MILLIE

My poor baby!

BUZZ

(to Theo)

You see what you did?

(he picks up the ball)

Take your ball and get out.

THEO

(resignedly)

99 years, 241 days,

(looks at his watch)

15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling.

Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve

island and begins wiping it down.

ALFIE

Find your bowler?

THEO

Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't

the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying

to affix the lid on his cup, but his

hands are trembling, spilling some of the

coffee.

ALFIE

My father used to say to me "Never..."

no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...

(puzzles)

Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.

THEO

Maybe I should have left the ball in the

car.

MILLIE

He's not here.

THEO

I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.

MILLIE

(points to grave)

This is a sign! Someone's coming to take

Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're

the guy or what, but I'm not letting it

happen. I'm leaving him first.

THEO

I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help.

Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the

trunk of her car.

MILLIE

Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but

himself.

THEO

He's my father, Millie.

MILLIE

He's no father to you.

MILLIE

Careful with that one. He won't tell me

anything, but I know there's something

strange going on over at the lanes. If

you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to

die.

THEO

Where can I find him?

MILLIE

(looks at her watch)

The Peter Pan.

MILLIE

You tell Buzz I went to my sister's in

Ronkonkoma. Oh, I'm sorry about trying to

kill you last night, Theo. It was nothing

personal. Millie puts on a pair of

sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of

gravel and dust.

12-PACK

Hey Sheila, how's that orange whip

comin'?

SHEILA

(mimicking him under her

breath)

How's that orange whip comin'?

12-PACK

So, I heard Junior busted out again?

12-PACK

Hey Sheila, you can whip my oranges

anytime. Sheila puts a Barbie head

earring on her left ear. Buzz comes into

the diner and slides into a booth. Sheila

walks over with a pot of coffee.

SHEILA

Cup of joe Mr. Fazeli?

BUZZ

Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't

sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a

cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his

hands trembling.

SHEILA

You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you

need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of

Theo pulling into the parking lot. She

puts a Ken head earring in her right ear.

Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.

BUZZ

(groans)

Some people will do anything for an

autograph. Theo enters the diner and

walks over to Buzz.

THEO

Millie left to stay with her sister in

Ronkonkoma.

BUZZ

You know what a mixer ball is? It's like

you, you come out of nowhere and upset

things, scattering everything all over.

Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.

THEO

What are you doing over at the lanes

that's so dangerous, Buzz?

BUZZ

You shouldn't listen to her, she's a

nervous old Nellie.

THEO

She thinks someone's trying to kill you.

BUZZ

I couldn't pay someone enough to try to

kill me. Sheila comes over to take their

orders.

BUZZ

I'll have my usual please, Sheila.

SHEILA

Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't

introduced me to your fan.

BUZZ

Sheila, meet...uh...

(leans in to Theo,

sardonically)

I forget the name.

THEO

(uncomfortably)

Theo.

BUZZ

Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's

daughter.

SHEILA

(eyeing Theo up and down)

You look like you're something on the

lanes.

BUZZ

Theo's bowled on the tour.

SHEILA

Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?

THEO

What's your specialty?

SHEILA

Whips...orange whips.

THEO

Then I'll have the number four with one

of your finest whips.

SHEILA

How do you want it?

(their eyes meet)

The eggs.

THEO

(discomfited at the blatant

double entendre)

Uh...over easy.

SHEILA

Coming right up.

BUZZ

Watch out for that one. She's got a great

average, but she's looking for a prince.

And, believe me, she's

(more)

BUZZ

kissed a lotta tadpoles.

(looking Theo in the eye)

Listen, I been thinking about your

problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you.

It would be unethical. But, there is

something I could do for you.

(leans in, secretively)

Putt-putt golf.

THEO

Putt-putt golf?

BUZZ

It's the next level, the next

dimension...

(deep conviction)

...the small ball.

THEO

(in Buzz's spell)

The small ball.

BUZZ

It's gonna be bigger than big. Think

Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room

for real golf courses in Japan.

THEO

(snapping out of it)

Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.

BUZZ

If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies

are my kind of people. Sheila steps over

to the booth with their food. The Buzz

Burger has three holes cut in the middle

to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz

sees the two sleazeballs park their car

and walk towards the diner.

THEO

(pondering the thought)

Maybe I could bowl in Japan.

BUZZ

I gotta wash up.

SID

Three whips. To go.

BREEZE

When you get a chance.

BREEZE

Hey, you still here?

SID

We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?

THEO

I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

BREEZE

Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's

favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the

plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and

pulls his burger away from Sid.

BUZZ

Get away from that burger.

BREEZE

Sorry Faz, we didn't know you was here.

SID

Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

BREEZE

(to Theo and Buzz)

Are you guys bruddas?

BUZZ

No, we ain't brothers.

SID

You know why we call him Breeze?

BREEZE

Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm

serious! You guys are related, right?

THEO

He's my dad.

BUZZ

(slapping his hand)

Get your own.

BREEZE

See that, toldja Sid. I knew I seen a

resemblance.

BUZZ

Why don't you clowns get your whips and

get lost.

SID

Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual

charismatic self today when he told us to

tell you...

(gazing artfully upwards and

rubbing his chin)

What was that he said...?

BREEZE

I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't

like no sticky fingers in the till.

SID

(exasperated)

Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.

BREEZE

(to Sheila)

Your pop said to put these on his tab.

Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards

the door.

SID

So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is

waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and

steps between his father and the two

sleazeballs.

THEO

I'm coming with you.

BUZZ

Easy. I got business to do, Theo. I'll

come back and haunt you later.

(drops a twenty on the table,

pats Theo's cheek)

Don't say I never gave you nothing.

THEO

(to Sheila)

Do those two work for your dad or mine?

SHEILA

Mine, and they never tip.

THEO

Do you know where they're taking him?

SHEILA

Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there

for my dad. Everybody who has anything to

do with bowling in this town answers to

my dad. Theo splits.

JUNIOR

(shrieks)

SHEILA!

KASTLE

Buzz.

KASTLE

(to Breeze)

You got my whip?

KASTLE

(motions to Sid and Breeze)

Lose yourselves.

BUZZ

What's on your mind, Miles?

KASTLE

We've been partners a long time now,

haven't we Buzz?

BUZZ

Seven years.

KASTLE

This scam we got going here was your

(more)

KASTLE

brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it

was a rotten idea, but I put up the

scratch.

(pulls a smile)

And now we got a beautiful thing.

BUZZ

It's a beautiful thing.

KASTLE

A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz?

You know what we got? Buzz raises an

eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.

MILES

We got balance.

KASTLE

A partnership is a very delicate balance.

But let's say something tips the scales,

maybe one partner takes more than his

share, then... Kastle tips the wire man

off his perch. The little motor squeals

pathetically.

KASTLE

... oops. We got no more balance.

KASTLE

And look at that; both partners go down

together. Kastle shoves the sculpture

onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it

under his heel. He goes over and puts his

arm around Buzz.

KASTLE

Simple math, Buzz.

(he holds up his fingers)

Two plus two does not equal three.

BUZZ

Miles, I've always been on the square

with you.

KASTLE

I'm sure you have Buzz.

BUZZ

Wish me luck.

KASTLE

Break a leg...

(sneers)

...partner.

BUZZ

(over the PA)

Greetings, ladies, gentlemen.

(the place grows silent)

My dentist told me this one the other

day: How many bowlers does it take to

screw in a lightbulb?

AUDIENCE

How many?

BUZZ

It takes three bowlers to screw in a

lightbulb. One to hold the bulb, one to

turn the ladder, and one to hold their

balls. Thank you, thank you. Just throw

money.

CUT TO:

BUZZ (OS)

Welcome to Buzz Fazeli's Dwarf Bowling,

folks, where we bring you the finest in

specialized bowling entertainment.

THEO'S POV

Through a crack in a door Theo can see

Buzz standing in the spotlight.

BUZZ

I would like to draw your attention to

the top of the lane.

(a Casio drum roll PLAYS)

Weighing in at sixty-nine pounds and

standing exactly three feet - the

diminutive dominatrix Teeny Weenie Tina

the Terrible! The crowd CHEERS as the

spotlight moves to Tina, a masked lady

dwarf duded up in a combination black

leather and cowhide western style S&M

outfit. She CRACKS a whip and leers at

the bowlers. They HOWL with excitement.

BUZZ

Don't be shy, folks!

BUZZ

And - bowl 'er!

TINA'S POV

The camera tracks low behind Tina as she

crashes into the pins.

SID

Seems to me like you ain't got much

choice Buzz.

BREEZE

You're between Miles Kastle and a hard

place.

BUZZ

Aaay, hands off the tux!

SID

The busyboy!

THEO

Get your hands off me, you moron.

THEO

What the fuck is this?

BUZZ

What's it look like to you?

THEO

It looks like dwarf bowling.

SID

Very good, busyboy.

THEO

(with intensity)

Dwarf bowling's illegal.

SID

(sarcastically)

What are you gonna do, call the bowling

police?

BREEZE

Heh, heh, heh.

THEO

You said it would be unethical to help

me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!

BUZZ

I do what I gotta do to survive.

THEO

You have no right to call yourself a

bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.

BUZZ

I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be.

I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking

anyone to bail me out.

THEO

I'm your blood.

BUZZ

You wish!

THEO

You knew she was pregnant.

BUZZ

What makes you so sure it was me? She

coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes

Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men

struggle for the pin.

THEO

Don't say that about my mom!

BUZZ

I had a career. She wanted a little

bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap

into the fray, prying the two men apart.

They wrestle Theo against a wall,

pressing his face into the tiles.

THEO

Fuck you and fuck bowling.

BUZZ

That's a laugh. You're all strung out.

You're a bowling junkie.

THEO

I don't need the stinking pro-tour.

BUZZ

You're dead without the pro-tour, and you

know it. Get him away from me. Sid and

Breeze punch Theo in the face.

DISSOLVE TO:

SID

You shoulda taken our advice, busyboy.

THEO

Hello.

LITTLE GIRL

Waaaaaaaaah!

SHEILA

Luna, that's the guy. I saw him do this

spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge.

LUNA

Typical.

SHEILA

Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a

seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane

and sees the two pins standing.

THEO

I'm not here to - I can't...

SHEILA

(knowing nod)

Bowling block.

BREEZE

Think he'll bowl it?

KASTLE

Nah, he won't do it.

SID

Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't

bowl.

KASTLE

It's not an "Alley". I hate when people

call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so

common! I prefer "Bowling Center".

BREEZE

What's this guy here for, anyway?

KASTLE

Maybe he's here to pay his last respects.

SID

Someone gonna get kacked, boss?

KASTLE

If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on

dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him

and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze

look sideways at each other.

KASTLE

I hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on

the Faz. I want you all over him like a

tent. Find out how that little weasel's

ripping me off. Buzz Fazeli's gonna blow

the lid off dwarf bowling!

THEO

I came here to have a word with your dad.

SHEILA

What do you want with my dad?

THEO

Business.

SHEILA

Won't your father help you with that?

THEO

(shakes his head)

Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's

cracked up to be.

SHEILA

Your dad's one of the only nice people in

this fucking town. My Dad is slime.

Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and

shakes Kastle's proffered hand.

KASTLE

So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting

you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't

come and see me sooner.

THEO

You know who I am?

KASTLE

Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling

ball in this town without Miles Kastle

knowing about it. You don't mind if I

have a word with Theo, do you bunny?

Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls

him away.

KASTLE

I heard you've been having a little

trouble with the Congress.

(waves at a mother/daughter

couple)

Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle

walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.

THEO

You might say I'm at the top of their

shit list.

KASTLE

Maybe I can help you.

(calling to a young bowler)

Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get

hurt with that big ball, honey.

(to Theo)

I've seen tapes of you bowling on the

circuit. You got Fazeli blood running

through you. Your pop was a genuine

talent in his day.

THEO

What's with the bad air between you two,

Mr. Kastle?

KASTLE

(dismissive gesture)

It's nothing, just a slight business

imbalance.

(to a seated mother)

How's Gloria's thumb?

MOTHER (OC)

The blister's worse than last week.

KASTLE

No pain, no gain! Keep trying the ice.

Chin up, sweetie.

(turning to Theo)

This place is a bowling oasis.

THEO

It's very...clean.

MRS. JACKSON (OC)

Hello, Mr.Kastle.

KASTLE

Hello, Violet. How's my favorite

'bowlerina' doing?

MRS. JACKSON (OC)

132, 154.

KASTLE

You keep that up Carmelita and one day

you'll be a champion just like Mr.

Skinner here. What do you think, Theo?

Think Carmelita's got the stuff?

THEO

That's some pinfall. Almost a 133

average. Her ball's flat, she needs to

work on her spin control.

KASTLE

That's right, didn't you have a slight

control problem in a recent

tournament,champ?

(to Carmelita)

Now go take out your "big four", darling.

(to Theo)

Come on, we're making her nervous.

KASTLE

I get them while they're young. Builds

loyalty.

MRS. JACKSON (OC)

She hit it, Mr. Kastle!

KASTLE

(waving over his shoulder)

Four or five years when a girl like

that's bowling on the pro tour for Team

Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on

my investment.

THEO

And the dwarf bowling?

KASTLE

(making sweeping gesture)

Think of this business like a big

aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to

eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies

can swim free at the top.

(more)

KASTLE

Profits down there, philanthropy up here.

(looks at Theo)

Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.

THEO

Nice set-up.

KASTLE

If it springs a leak, it'll be because

Buzz is making waves.

THEO

What if he wants to get out?

KASTLE

(chuckles)

He's earned an early retirement.

(sprays his mouth with Binaca)

But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is

history. Lets talk about your future.

(puts his arm around Theo)

I wanna show you something.

KASTLE

Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate,

Computerize. That, my boy, is the future.

One of the monitors shows a little girl

bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it

barely tips over the first pin. Kastle

hits a key and the pins explode in an

emphatic strike. The little girl jumps

with joy.

THEO

What ever happened to just bowling?

KASTLE

There's a lot of competition for

amusement out there. You gotta adapt to

survive.

THEO

I like the sport the way it is.

KASTLE

A guy like you could breathe some fire

into bowling. You got ambition like

a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what

you want and anything that gets in your

way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.

(puts his arm around Theo)

Maybe lady fate washed you up on my

doorstep for your own good.

(pauses for effect)

I think I could help you, Theo.

THEO

(he's been waiting for this)

How Mr. Kastle?

KASTLE

You need a sponsor; I have influence. I

could sponsor you.

THEO

Why would you help me?

KASTLE

I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.

KASTLE

But, now that you mention it, you could

afford me one minor dispensation. Theo

follows his gaze to the screen.

KASTLE

While you're in town, I need you to keep

an eye on my daughter for a couple of

days. Her big brother broke out of the

mental hospital... Theo's eyes glaze

over, the lights in the office dim, and

Kastle seems to recede into the far

distance.

KASTLE (OS)

...and I want someone watching out for

Sheila while he's, uh, loose.

KASTLE (OS)

Junior's a problem child. He has a thing

about -

JUNIOR

(wails)

SHEILA!

THEO

I could do that.

KASTLE

One thing,

(pointing to Theo's mid-

section)

keep the meat in the freezer.

CUT TO:

THEO

(shouting above the engine)

This is a vicious cycle.

SHEILA

I think that a motorbike is one of the

last really free things that people can

do.

THEO

Isn't this technically a scooter?

SHEILA

When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild

person.

(she looks sideways at Theo)

Better than any sex I've ever had.

THEO

Kinda tough on the butt.

SHEILA

Everything has it's drawbacks.

THEO

Where did your brother escape from?

SHEILA

The mental hospital.

THEO

What does he do?

SHEILA

He follows me, he tries to have sex with

me, and then they send him to the nut-hut

for a while and then he gets out and then

he follows me, he tries to have sex with

me, they send him to the nut-hut for a

while...

THEO

Whoa.

SHEILA

It's a vicious cycle.

CUT TO:

LUNA

Hookah?

THEO

No thanks, I don't hookah.

LUNA

Theo, you ever do the 'Swing'?

SHEILA

These guys all work at the alley, too.

This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne,

Jonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo

and Sheila.

LUNA

(screams)

Dance Break!

GUY

Hey man, howyadoin'?

THEO

Don't tell me, John.

JOHN

Cool!

THEO

Theo. Howzitgoin.

JOHN

Hey man, welcome to our parking lot.

Lemme give you some advice, if she asks

you to dance, make sure her brother's not

around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot

light, if you get my meaning.

THEO

How's that?

JOHN

I was doing the lambada with her and the

guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to

kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I

was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a

been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He

woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just

snapped. How do you like your burger?

THEO

(meets eyes with Sheila)

Uh...over easy.

JOHN

(throws a blackened burger on

Theo's styrofoam plate)

I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me

around that alley with that freak on the

loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't

play any of his fuckin' knock-knock

jokes.

LUNA

Sheila wants me to show you a few steps

before you two swing-a-delic.

THEO

(uneasily)

So, you're the pinman around here?

LUNA

...And one, and two, and yes, I am. But

no one gets them working like Junior used

to...and two, and one.. - they call him

The 'Quasimodo of the lanes.' He's the

best pinman there is.. and one and

two...People used to say he got the

machines working so well 'cause he

lubricated them with blood...and two, and

one...but people just love saying things

about Junior.

SHEILA

Mind if I cut in?

THEO

No, not at all.

SHEILA

You and your sideburns are the talk of

the party, Theo.

THEO

The ladies in Akron call them thigh-

ticklers.

SHEILA

Can I ask you something personal?

THEO

I'd rather you didn't.

SHEILA

Do you have a girlfriend?

THEO

Not while I'm in training.

SHEILA

Do you have a boyfriend?

THEO

(surprised)

No. Do You?

SHEILA

No. Not at the present.

THEO

So this brother of yours is hazardous to

the health of your dates?

SHEILA

Nobody in this town really understands

Junior. When I went to family sessions

for him I realized he was the sanest one

in the family. Actually, he's the only

one in this whole fucking town who knows

exactly who he is and what he wants.

THEO

Unfortunately what he wants is you.

SHEILA

So, what about you?

THEO

Do I want you?

SHEILA

We'll get into that later.

CUT TO:

KASTLE

(with rising anger)

Why that filthy, slimey, double-crossing,

misbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a-

bitch bastard!

SHEILA

Theo, what would you do if you couldn't

bowl?

THEO

I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to

do.

SHEILA

I wanted to be a motocross champion. My

folks didn't really care what I did. Then

Junior blew a fuse and I became their

last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed

down their throats, I got bowling. I

never understood how anyone could take it

so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting

you.

THEO

No, I'm fascinated.

SHEILA

Why were you suspended?

THEO

I used to be kind of wild. They used to

call me the bad boy of bowling.

SHEILA

So you're hoping Buzz can get you re-

instated?

THEO

Well, that was plan A.

SHEILA

What's plan B?

THEO

Plan B is your dad.

SHEILA

What do you think my dad's gonna do for

you?

THEO

He said he'd sponsor me.

SHEILA

Ha! And what do you have to do for him?

THEO

Nothing.

SHEILA

Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do

anything unless there's something in it

for him.

THEO

He asked me to keep an eye on you for a

couple of days.

SHEILA

What? Be my body guard?

(she laughs)

Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my

dad's sake. For your career. Sheila

starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.

THEO

Sheila, please.

SHEILA

Come on Theo, what about plan C?

THEO

(looking worried)

What's plan C?

SHEILA

Plan C...

(opens her shirt, showing off

her brassiere)

...is me.

THEO

(torn)

Look, Sheila, I really like you but...

Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a

hickey on his neck.

THEO

(stopping her)

Forget it, Sheila.

KASTLE

Junior? Is that you, Junior? Don't be

afraid. Where are you? I won't hurt you.

KASTLE

Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for

you, son. The beam of light catches

Junior's face. He is crouched inside the

machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut

and bleeding and his straitjacket torn

and filthy.

JUNIOR

Needs lubrication. Lubrication.

KASTLE

We're having a party for you, boy. Cake

and shish-k-bob, just like you love.

Junior cringes away from the light.

JUNIOR

You made me hurt him!

KASTLE

Look what I got for you.

KASTLE

Happy Birthday Junior!

JUNIOR

Ooooooohhh.

KASTLE

I have someone for you to play with

Junior.

JUNIOR

Someone wants to play with me?

KASTLE

I have someone for you to play Blueface

with Junior.

JUNIOR

Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.

SID

Bowling used to be so pure, so...All-

American. Breeze sings along with Caruso

and pretends to conduct.

BREEZE

La da da dalala...

SID

(looking heatedly disturbed)

I hate fuckin' opera.

BREEZE

How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has

all the drama and excitement of real life

- to music!

SID

How do you know, you don't even speak

Latin?

BREEZE

You listen to the feelings, not the

words.

SID

You got an 8-track tape player on

purpose, just 'cause you knew the only

thing they had on 8-track was fuckin'

opera.

BREEZE

It was a clearance.

SID

(wistfully)

You know, Elvis bowled.

BREEZE

No kiddin'.

SID

Bowling was the most incorruptible sport.

No megalomillionaires, no

(more)

SID

gambling. And it was a safe place for

kids, a place where the whole community

could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.

BREEZE

(sympathetically)

Sure, Sid.

SID

(becoming rabid)

But not no more. Now people take

advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to

be. There's something evil spreading in

this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss-

ridden -

BREEZE

(getting excited)

- canker sore.

SID

(apoplectic)

Right, eating at the core, eating it's

way out. It makes me sick!

SID

How do you turn this thing off?

BREEZE

Wait! That's an aria!

SID

Gimme that!

BUZZ

(in deadly serious)

Theo, I want you to get out of this town.

THEO

I'm getting to like it here.

BUZZ

Did that porcupine say he'd get you back

on the tour?

THEO

I gotta survive.

BUZZ

(shaking his head)

He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest

of your life.

THEO

You got a better offer?

BUZZ

No...

THEO

I didn't think so.

BUZZ

Not for somebody who hit a man with his

ball on national television.

THEO

(bitterly)

That's right, Buzz, and you know when I

did it? Last match, last frame. All I

needed was one spare for the crown - and

I get stuck with the seven-ten, the

Fazeli Split.

BUZZ

You never even took the shot. You

couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz

in a threatening manner.

THEO

(repressed fury in his voice)

I was beaten on a shot named after my own

dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and

climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.

BUZZ

Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.

(taps chest)

I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm

finished - dead from my ankles up.

THEO

I couldn't care less.

BUZZ

You know what I think? You didn't

BUZZ

(at the top of his lungs)

I SHOULDA HAD MY TUBES TIED!

SHEILA

I don't think your new outfit suits you,

Theo.

THEO

(flicking dust off the suit)

Really? I kinda like it.

SHEILA

Do you talk with your mom?

THEO

It's been awhile. She didn't want me

looking for my dad.

SHEILA

My mom told me not to stay in this town.

THEO

So why do you stay?

SHEILA

I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a

binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm

trapped in his easy payment plan.

THEO

I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible

bowlers.

SHEILA

Yeah, but they're all little wannabes.

I'm looking for a professional man.

THEO

(he ponders the thought)

I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no

amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.

SHEILA

(touches his lips)

How much would you charge me for the

lips?

THEO

More than you could afford.

SHEILA

Come on, bargain with me.

THEO

I could let them go for ten.

SHEILA

(she pulls away, slightly)

You professional men drive a hard

bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on

me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.

THEO

(smiles)

If you want a professional man, you have

to be willing to pay for him.

THEO

What are you going to do about your

brother?

SHEILA

You're here.

THEO

What about the guy he put in the body

cast?

BINOCULAR POV

The road is empty

SHEILA

Momentary relapse. Except for that, he's

been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo

nervously pulls his collar up over the

hickey on his neck.

SHEILA

Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves

his birthday so much, that every year,

before we can go pick him up...

BINOCULAR POV

Kastle's car appears, driving hell-for-

leather towards the house.

SHEILA

...he breaks out of the hospital and

comes home on his own. Here they come.

She hands the binoculars to Theo, who

immediately trains them on the road.

SHEILA

My mom once had an affair. When my dad

found out, he had Junior kill the man.

The body was never found, but I think

Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers

the binoculars and looks at Sheila.

THEO

Then it's true, isn't it? About...

SHEILA

...lane six. Yes.

KASTLE

(a loud whisper)

He's here! Come on down!

KASTLE (OS)

(muffled)

OK, hats on everybody.

SHEILA (OS)

(muffled)

Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

KASTLE (OS)

(muffled)

Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three.

One...two...three!

EVERYONE

Surprise!

KASTLE

Steady boy, steady.

CUT TO:

KASTLE

I bet you didn't know that you and Junior

have something in common, Theo: Junior

can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that

right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup

bottle down on Junior's right hand. The

table settings jump from the shock.

Junior sits impassively, his face a

blank.

KASTLE

See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened

to your hand, Junior.

SHEILA

After we eat, Dad.

KASTLE

He stuck it in the ball return machine

when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve

endings. Junior starts stroking the

ketchup bottle with his dead hand.

JUNIOR

It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels

like someone else. Sheila grabs the

bottle from Junior, opens it and pours

some on her shish kebab. She leans over

and whispers furiously to her father.

SHEILA

Do you have to get your hooks into every

guy I'm interested in?

KASTLE

(whispers back, defensively)

You're just like you mother! Always

jealous!

SHEILA

That's why Mom ran away, because you had

to control everything!

KASTLE

She ran away to be with that...

(spits out his words)

that Motocross champion.

JUNIOR

Your turn, Theo. Why can't you bowl?

THEO

I don't like to talk about it.

JUNIOR

You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't

you?

THEO

It depends.

JUNIOR

It feels good to let it out, doesn't it?

Sheila leans over and whispers furiously

to her father.

SHEILA

You're using Theo for your own deviant

purposes!

KASTLE

Look who's talking!

SHEILA

Leave him alone!

KASTLE

Just because your mother signed part

ownership of the lanes over to you,

doesn't mean you have a right to tell me

how to run my business! I can have my

lawyers take that deed away from you like

that.

(snaps his fingers)

Sheila and Kastle sit up.

KASTLE

Junior, how 'bout a riddle?

JUNIOR

(turns to Sheila)

Sheila. Knock-knock.

JUNIOR

(impatiently)

Come on Sheila, knock-knock.

SHEILA

Who's there?

JUNIOR

Junior.

SHEILA

Junior who?

JUNIOR

J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?

(laughs)

KASTLE

(laughing)

Fantastic! What talent.

SHEILA

(caustically)

You still got the touch Junior.

CUT TO:

KASTLE

Make a wish, son.

JUNIOR

Same wish as last year.

SHEILA

It won't come true, Junior.

KASTLE

It's a bowling claw. You can bowl now,

Junior. With the whole family. Junior

beams at the group.

KASTLE

(puts one arm around Junior and

one on Theo)

Pretty soon everybody can bowl!

SID

Hello Mr. Kastle.

(nods to seated party)

Junior, long time. I thought they locked

you up and threw away the warden!

BREEZE

Is it true they blacked out the whole

county giving you electro-shock? Junior

looks from one man to the other,

breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.

JUNIOR

Knock, knock.

BREEZE

Who's...

SID

(interrupting)

Don't do it Breeze!

(to Junior)

You ain't getting us into that.

KASTLE

Hey, enough fun and games. We have work

to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for

his car. Junior gets up and follows. The

two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.

SID

(to Theo)

If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy-

bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap

dance on your spleen.

(pokes Theo in the side)

BREEZE

(pulls down Theo's collar to

reveal the hickey)

With cleats.

KASTLE

Buzz has been moving the cash out in

hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw

sideways glances at each other.

SID

No!

KASTLE

I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring

him to lane six. Junior will take it from

there.

JUNIOR

(perks up at mention of lane

six)

I'm gonna play Blue Face!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MILES

Champ, as soon as you get back on the

tour, we should do an instructional

videotape. 'RAMBOWL' Theo Skinner teaches

Power Bowling. You on the cover with a

flame thrower. Kastle lights Theo's cigar

and they puff away.

KASTLE

Theo, how would you like to be my new

partner?

THEO

You already have a partner Mr. Kastle.

Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car

pulls out of the driveway.

KASTLE

I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I

think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls

out a shiny gold credit card and holds it

in front of Sheila.

KASTLE

Here, Bunny. Why don't you two go and do

something fun tonight, on me. Sheila is

lured to the scent of the plastic like a

junkie to a fix.

KASTLE

One thing, stay away from the lanes. If

Junior sees you two together, he'll

swallow his tongue.

She reaches for the card and Kastle

snatches it away from her with a chortle.

KASTLE

What did I say?

SHEILA

Don't go near the bowling alley.

KASTLE

(enunciating clearly)

Bowling "Center"!

SHEILA

It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in

danger, would it?

THEO

Nope, I couldn't care less.

SHEILA

I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed

your help, right?

THEO

Why should I help that old fuck.

SHEILA

(sarcastically)

Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for

you?

THEO

Zip.

SHEILA

And besides, it's probably too late,

anyhow.

THEO

(exhaling cigar smoke)

Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.

(goes to take another drag,

then stops)

Too late for what?

SHEILA

Nothing.

THEO

Too late for what, Sheila?

SHEILA

You know how people with broken bones

know when there's a storm coming?

THEO

You got any broken bones?

SHEILA

No, but something's gonna blow in this

town. I can feel it.

THEO

Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is

something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila

seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is

unable.

SHEILA

(faltering)

I can't tell you, Theo.

THEO

Why not?

SHEILA

I saw your eyes when you hit that guy

with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles.

Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.

THEO

(gently)

Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of?

Sheila shakes her head.

SHEILA

I'm afraid you'll hurt him.

THEO

It's Junior, isn't it.

SHEILA

(starting to cry)

I can't - I can't do it.

(she looks up through her tears

at Theo)

He's my brother.

THEO

He's my father.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SHEILA

These open the back door. Don't let him

catch you behind the machines; if he

does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at

the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila

grabs his arm.

SHEILA

You don't have to do this. We could just

cut out of here, go to Akron,  or

anywhere else.

THEO

(dislodging her hand gently)

I'll be at the bridge.

THEO

Knock-knock.

JUNIOR

(stops and looks around)

Who's there?

JUNIOR

(getting angry)

Who's there!

THEO

Buzz Fazeli.

JUNIOR

NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's

there. I say who's there and then you say

who who. You're not playing right.

(primly)

Knock-knock.

THEO

Who's there?

JUNIOR

Junior.

JUNIOR

JUNIOR!

(boiling)

You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm

going to have to hurt you. Theo and

Junior circle one another.

JUNIOR

You shouldn't touch her.

THEO

No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.

JUNIOR

Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch

her. Sheila told me you played bouncy-

bouncy with her.

THEO

What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz?

Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and

knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his

ankles.

JUNIOR

He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I

like games.

THEO

(struggling to get away)

What did you do to Buzz?

JUNIOR

You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so

I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.

(he grabs Theo's throat)

THEO

(hoarsely)

I don't want to play.

JUNIOR

To play, I press my fingers on a throat

like this...

(he presses tighter on Theo's

windpipe)

...and then the mans face would go blue

and I should keep pressing...

(Theo's face goes pale blue)

...and I did and then he stopped moving

and he didn't play anymore after that.

Theo bends back a finger on Junior's

hand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and

releases Theo's neck. Theo GASPS for air.

JUNIOR

You didn't play fair.

(stands up)

You were almost blue.

JUNIOR

Go ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I'm your

biggest fan. Junior offers Theo his

unprotected head.

JUNIOR

(yelling)

Come on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH!

JUNIOR

Thank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you!

JUNIOR

I can have her,you know.

(looks around and whispers)

She's not my real sister.

(he flashes a lecherous smile)

THEO'S POV A ball pops up at

the far end of the return and

TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo.

The ball hits Theo's face with

a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR

"Raindrops Keep Falling On My

Head." THEO'S BOWLING SHOE

ATTIRED FEET Being dragged

down the lane. Theo comes to

and looks down his body to see

the empty lane. He looks up to

see Junior pulling him towards

the pin reset machine. The cut

on Theo's forehead bleeds down

the side of his face.

JUNIOR

(muttering)

Lubrication.

CUT TO:

THEO

(loud whisper)

Sheila! Where are you?

THEO

(angry)

You told Junior that we did it.

SHEILA

It?

THEO

It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to

squeeze my fucking head off. What did you

say to him?

When they reach each other, they stop.

Sheila seems to weigh her answer.

SHEILA

I told him you were my boyfriend.

THEO

(very pissed off)

What the hell did you go doing that for

Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!

SHEILA

We would have sooner or later.

THEO

Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew

he would go off if he thought I fooled

around with you.

SHEILA

Did you - kill him?

THEO

How do you get this thing down?

SHEILA

Tell me what happened Theo.

THEO

(glares at Sheila)

You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?

SHEILA

(in shock)

If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.

THEO

He's dead Sheila.

SHEILA

I feel sick.

THEO

You should.

SHEILA

Are you sure he's dead?

THEO

I didn't stop to take his pulse.

SHEILA

Where are you going?

THEO

I think your brother may have already

gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

SHEILA

Can I come with you?

THEO

I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now

fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila

standing alone. She watches his car

recede with a thoughtful expression, then

turns on her heel.

CUT TO:

THEO

(whispers)

Buzz? You alright?

JUNIOR

Don't you KNOCK?

BALL

Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his

forearm, dripping off his elbow.

Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of

the ball. Blood streams out of the three

finger holes. He drops the ball to the

floor. He goes into the bathroom and

turns on the sink faucets.

GRACE

Hello?

THEO

Hello, mom?

GRACE

Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?

THEO

I found dad.

GRACE

He's dead, isn't he.

(pauses)

Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died

before you were born.

THEO

Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did

it a little too late.

GRACE

You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not

bowling are you?

THEO

I gotta go. Love ya mom.

ALFIE

Did you hear about that bowler who got

smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out

of the alley. I heard he was kacked but

good. They had to take apart the pin

machine to get him out.

THEO

(stunned)

The pin machine?

ALFIE

Just like Junior did the last time; lane

six. All's I know is it's gonna be a

closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay

low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven

shades, flips up his collar and skulks

away.

LITTLE GIRL

There he is!

BREEZE

Bowling police, step back, give him room.

SID

Nothing going on here, everybody stand

back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies,

please. As they start to move through the

female throng, a little girl pops out in

front of them, holding her ball.

LITTLE GIRL

Mr. Kastle, we know you wouldn't do

anything bad.

KASTLE

Thank-you, sweetheart.

(turns to Breeze)

See that you pinheads! Character witness.

(with sweeping head gesture)

They're all character witnesses!

(he sees Theo)

Thanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in

this town! He KILLED it! The two officers

hustle Kastle towards the van. Theo steps

out in front of him.

KASTLE

(between clenched teeth)

You fool, we could have done great things

together!

THEO

Where's Junior?

KASTLE

He killed your stoolie embezzler father,

and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and

Breeze push him towards the van as the

crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns

and yells over his shoulder.

KASTLE

(shouting)

Lock your daughters up, ladies! Junior's

out there! Mothers and daughters send out

a cacophony of screams and scatter for

their cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into

the back of the van. Sid slams the doors

shut. The van screeches off, sirens

wailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo.

BREEZE

Sorry about your loss.

THEO

(shaking his head)

I should've pegged you guys for bowling

dicks from day one.

SID

You should probably hit the road. Go

home. This place could get hazardous for

your health.

THEO

So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

SID

You call it stooling, we call it

cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's

car.

BREEZE

Did you know you were parked in the

handicap space?

SID

Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

SID

She told us you went after Junior to save

your old man's hide. You got some balls

goin' after that psycho.

BREEZE

Only problem is, you didn't put his

lights out, you just got him mad. Then he

took it out on poor Faz, God rest his

soul. Theo patches out.

SID

Think he bought it?

BREEZE

I'd buy it!

SHEILA

Once my father walked in on me while I

was making Barbie and Ken do it. He

freaked. I was seven. He took all my

dolls away from me and cut them in half.

He gave the top halves back to

(more)

SHEILA

me. Then he made me watch him burn the

bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo

kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie

onto the bonfire. It goes up with a

WHOOSH.

SHEILA

I can see Junior's face in the fire.

SHEILA

Why did you come back?

THEO

When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even

think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in

his arms and kisses her passionately. She

stops him and looks around nervously.

SHEILA

If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.

THEO

I killed him once, I'll just have to kill

him again.

SHEILA

You don't get two chances with Junior.

THEO

At least I'll die smiling.

SHEILA

And you only get two chances with me.

FIRE

The shirt CRACKLES and burns.

SHEILA

What's it gonna be, Theo?

THEO & SHEILA

Theo bends Sheila backwards, down on her

back. She grabs the tail of his shirt,

yanks it over his head and off his body.

Sheila rubs her hands up Theo's back.

SHEILA

What's the plan, Theo?

SHEILA

Say something, Theo. Give me something. A

doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into

Sheila's eyes.

THEO

Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C.

Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy

hands sliding over each others' sweaty

skin.

THEO

It's gonna be you, Sheila.

CUT TO:

PRIEST

(with pomp and vigor)

Bowling!

(pauses to reflect)

Bowling is a little like faith. Every now

and then, we are blessed with the ability

and strength to send a full roller down..

(makes bowling gesture)

...and scatter those babies like nobody's

business. And every now and then we end

up in the gutter.

(pauses and gets glum)

Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter

of life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing

nothing balls. But before he left us for

that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled

himself out of that gutter.

Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of

bowling. Now he lies at peace alongside

his lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field.

(makes sign of the cross)

He died so that we could bowl - with

dignity. Millie, decked out in mourning

black, lets out a wail, steps up and

throws a bouquet of flowers onto the

coffin.

MILLIE

(sniffles)

I forgive you Buzz.

SID

(in loud whisper)

The Faz sure took care a her.

(points to Millie, does the

cash rub with fingers)

Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to

suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep

a straight face - elbows him. Sid and

Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls

an orange whip out of a paper bag and

carefully places it on the coffin lid.

BREEZE

Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.

SID

See ya 'round Faz.

TINA

These are all your perfect games.

(she drops scoresheets onto the

coffin)

Bowl with God, Buzz.

THEO

Maybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did

just come here to take it out on

somebody. But, I had to find my father...

The muffled BEEPING of "Raindrops Keep

Falling On My Head" begins playing from

inside the coffin. Theo's body jolts. He

runs after Sheila who is walking towards

her scooter.

THEO

Buzz is alive, Sheila.

SHEILA

Theo, Buzz is dead.

THEO

I didn't come this far to bury a guy

that's not my dad. He owes me.

SHEILA

(bitterly)

Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all

over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.

SHEILA

I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my

whole life. She walks over to her

scooter, and mounts it.

SHEILA

Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm

the one who's free. If I gotta do this

alone, I might as well start now. She

revs up and peals out.

THEO

(yells)

SSHHEEIILLAAA!

THEO

Why is Junior's watch in that coffin?

Something stinks around here.

SID

Your time is up, busyboy.

THEO

Who identified the body?

SID

The body was identified along proper

Bowling Congress guidelines for

processing a bowling related fatality.

THEO

I'm the next of kin. I should've seen

him.

BREEZE

After we ID, we bury the body. Case and

casket closed.

THEO

You tried to make it look like Junior

trashed his place. Junior's underground

in that coffin you dicks put him in.

BREEZE

It's splitsville for you.

THEO

You faked my dad's murder. You used him!

Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze

around their car. He catches Sid and

grabs the middle fingers on his right

hand. Sid howls.

SID

Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back

on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze!

Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler"

from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB

OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM

KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

SID

It's official, you're an orphan.

THEO

(shouting and pointing

frantically)

What makes you think you know me so well

that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?

SHEILA

Who said anything about an ultimatum? You

want to find your father? Get a shovel

and start digging. Hurry up, he's

probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila

makes a pathetic attempt to speed away

from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

THEO

You're really pissing me off.

SHEILA

I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I

said I'd do. What the hell are you doing?

What about your word?

THEO

My word is good, and it'll always be

good. When did I ever give my word to

you?

SHEILA

What about plan C?

THEO

Fuck plan C!

SHEILA

Your word is so good, you're never gonna

give it to anyone.

THEO

You think I'm dumping you to get back

into bowling. Well who's dumping who?

SHEILA

I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.

THEO

Sez you!

SHEILA

Suck my dick!

THEO

Paradise.

THEO (OS)

(whispers to himself)

Paradise. Hmmmm

ALFREDA

You a mini-golfer?

THEO

Nope.

ALFREDA

Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new

putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to

leave.

ALFREDA

Can I get you something for the road?

THEO

You have orange whips?

ALFREDA

Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?

THEO

No. I'm from Akron.

WOMAN (OS)

I just hold it loosely with both hands?

MAN (OS)

That's right, sugar, find the grip that's

right for you. Then grasp firmly.

The camera weaves past a five foot pink

whale with a gaping green mouth leading

onto a mini-green.

WOMAN (OS)

Grasp firmly. Then what?

MAN (OS)

Line up where you want it.

WOMAN (OS)

Yeah.

MAN (OS)

Now swing it out a little to the right...

WOMAN (OS)

Like this?

MAN (OS)

No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle

stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead,

now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes

around the side of the whale, we see an

elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports

coat and white slacks hunched over a

diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is

to the camera and he is wearing a

baseball cap with a plastic halo attached

to it.

WOMAN

Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.

MAN

Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!

WOMAN

Yippy!

BUZZ

Get away from me!

WOMAN

Who the hell are you?

THEO

Hi Dad.

WOMAN

Dad? You said you was single.

BUZZ

We ain't married no more.

THEO

He says that to all his wives.

WOMAN

(freeing herself - to Buzz)

Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth?

BUZZ

Don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.

WOMAN

You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you

got two wives - I ain't into no

polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the

club out of her hand. She steps away -

startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz

throws down his club in a fury.

BUZZ

Goddam it! I was just about to make a

love connection. You sure got a way with

women. You show up, women get away.

THEO

(laughs)

The whole world thinks you're

underground.

BUZZ

I am underground.

THEO

It could just as easily have been me in

that box.

BUZZ

I told you to get lost. You forced

yourself into this mess, so the mess

accommodated you.

Buzz straightens out and carefully

remolds the bent out of shape halo.

THEO

What about bowling?

BUZZ

(takes a practice swing)

Bowling died for me years ago. Besides,

I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

THEO

You're a scumbag.

BUZZ

I'm a live scumbag.

THEO

Nice knowing you, dad.

BUZZ

So, eh, you never saw me. Right?

THEO

I never saw you.

BUZZ

Thanks, kid.

(pause)

Where are you goin' now?

THEO

I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts.

Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the

open window.

BUZZ

Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you

come work for me.

(hands Theo his card)

Just make sure nobody's following you.

Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of

the sunset, his halo bouncing in the

breeze.

BUZZ

I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was

trying to keep you out of this muddle.

I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh,

and by the way, I made a call for you

before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his

card and scrawl on the back with a gold

pen.

BUZZ

(hands the card back)

You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling

Congress a call.

(taps the card)

Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's

expecting you, and he owes me. He'll

getcha back in like Flynn.

(pats Theo's cheek)

Don't say I never gave you nothing.

THEO

(cracks a half smile)

See ya 'round Maynard.

LUNA

Theo! Howya doin'?

BOWLER

Theo! Hey, Theo's back!

TINA

Hello there, stranger.

LITTLE GIRL

(still crying)

Waaaaaaaaaaah!

CUT TO:

SHEILA

Very professional.

THEO

I am a professional man.

SHEILA

(touches his lips)

Lips still for sale?

THEO

(nonchalantly)

You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw

in the tongue.

SHEILA

(she pulls away, slightly)

Can you change something this big?

THEO

I don't know.

SHEILA

You'll owe me.
