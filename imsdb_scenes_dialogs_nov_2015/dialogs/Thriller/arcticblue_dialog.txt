Hand me the transmitter.

He's coming around fine.

Be right back.  I left my

(CONTINUED)

NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.

ERIC

Anne Marie!  Stop!

ERIC

(continuing)

Don't move.

ERIC

(continuing)

Goddamn trappers!

ERIC

(continuing)

Takes nerve, laying traplines on

restricted land.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

What are you doing?

ERIC

He still might be around.  I saw

fresh tire tracks coming in.

ERIC

Man and a jeep, about a mile and

a half down.

LEMALLE

Where the fuck did you drop

Corbett off?

MITCHELL

He's over there.

ERIC

Stay here.

ANNE MARIE

Be careful -- there're two of

them.

ERIC

If I unzip my parka, stick this

out the window.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(to LeMalle)

No shooting.  Let's see who's so

interested in us.

MITCHELL

(to Corbett)

Ain't worth it, Ben...

ERIC

You got two counts against you --

trapping out of season and

poaching on restricted land.

CORBETT

Can't be much of a crime, if all

they got minding the area is a

cocky kid.

ERIC

I got your plate number, asshole.

Maybe you feel like spending a

few months in jail.

(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE

Ben?  Sure you don't want me to

drop the fucker?

ERIC

You leave and don't come back,

that's the end of it.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

(unnerved)

Great idea -- pointing a lousy

dart gun at some nut with a

high-powered hunting rifle.

ERIC

Bastards took off, though, didn't

they?

LEMALLE

All this fuckin' land, and we're

locked out.  Makes me puke.

CORBETT

Jawing about it won't change it.

LEMALLE

Three hundred seventy-five

million acres in this state.  I'm

real tired of runnin' into

people.

MITCHELL

Then don't look to your left.

CORBETT

Leave it here.

(CONTINUED)

MITCHELL

Let's keep going.  We're only an

hour from Devil's Cauldron.

CORBETT

(pats Mitchell's shoulder)

Relax.  I just want to ask them

how the hunting is.

CORBETT

Looks like you've had some luck.

Where's your guide?

SPORTSMAN #1

We're on our own, if it's any of

your damn business.

CORBETT

(re ermine)

You did real good.

LEMALLE

(to Corbett)

No swinging shit.  They're over

their goddamned limit.

CORBETT

(to Sportsmen)

My friend is right.  Supposed to

have a licensed guide when you're

on this land, too.

SPORTSMAN #1

Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit

fees.

(CONTINUED)

SPORTSMAN #2

I were you, I'd drive right on

outta here again.  Now.

CORBETT

(calmly)

This was my roaming land, 'til

the government took it over.

Only Innuit can hunt here now,

and tourists, like you.

CORBETT

(continuing)

According to tribal law, hunters

passing through the land of

another tribe can only take game

to survive.  They can eat the

meat, but have to surrender the

hides.

LEMALLE

Want the meat?

SPORTSMAN #1

Fuck you, dirtball.

LEMALLE

I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with

their shiny new car.

MITCHELL

(to LeMalle)

If you're gonna take something,

take it and let's go.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(to Sportsmen)

Put him in your truck.  Smell of

blood will attract the bears.

(to trappers)

Let's go.

LEMALLE

I don't believe in leavin'

witnesses behind, Ben.

MITCHELL

It was self defense.  Leave it at

that.

LEMALLE

You think those fucks will tell

it that way?

CORBETT

(ending the argument)

We'll get a head start before

they go crying to the law.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(continuing; to Sportsmen)

You can pack out of here -- two,

three days' hike along this river

at most.  Weather should hold

this early in the season.

LEMALLE

Think I'm pretty?  You better

forget how we look, 'cause next

time they won't keep me from

killing you.  This land ain't

quite civilized, you know...

MITCHELL

At least he scalped the dead one.

LEO MEYERLING

State Legislature

VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND!

CORBETT

Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?

WILDER

(wary)

Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and

I'd like to keep it that way.

CORBETT

(conciliatory)

Just passing through.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(continuing; re boot)

Needs patching.

KENAI

Twenty-five dollar.

CORBETT

(smiles)

Sure have learned to worship the

white man's god.

MEYERLING

I hope I can count on you

gentlemen to vote for The

People's Friend this November.

CORBETT

Share some of that oil company

money in your pocket and you can.

WILDER

(to Meyerling)

One flier comes loose and I shoot

you for littering.

MEYERLING

(exiting; grudgeless)

Have your fun... just remember

The People's Friend come election

day.

WILDER

(shakes his head)

Oil Company candidate running on

that slogan makes about as much

sense as a rat fucking a

grapefruit.

CORBETT

Hard to work up an interest in

politics, way we live.  You're

the first people we've seen in

two weeks.

(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE

(to Kenai)

How about a quart of Jack

Daniel's?

KENAI

How about it is right.  Back in

the primary this town was voted

dry.

LEMALLE

(to Corbett)

Aw, shit.  Let's go.  Leave a

note for Viking Bob, tell him to

meet us in Cache.

CORBETT

Relax.  One more day without

drink won't kill you.  Right,

Sam?

WILDER

I'm living proof of that sad

fact.

CORBETT

Can we buy the Marshal some

dinner?

WILDER

No, I better stay at my post.

Even without the hootch riling

'em up, you know how

mean-spirited folks get when they

smell winter coming.

MITCHELL

So much for the walking weather

you predicted.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

Had no choice...

(pointedly, at LeMalle)

...Given the situation.

MITCHELL

I know.  Least you didn't shoot

all of them.

LEMALLE

Fuck you, Mitchell.  Woulda been

my ass if Ben didn't waste that

prick.

CORBETT

(after a beat)

Mitchell, look, it don't take

three of us to wait for Viking

Bob.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll

come to Cache with Bob when he

gets here.

MITCHELL

Okay by me.  You're the one likes

these hot springs so much.

CORBETT

Leave my traps.  We'll tag up,

couple days.

(CONTINUED)

WILDER

I was making my rounds, saw your

hangar wide open, plane getting

rained on, so I closed it up.

ERIC

Thanks.

ANNE MARIE

(to Wilder)

I bet you haven't had lunch.

WILDER

(smiles)

Bet you're right.  But I didn't

come by to wangle a meal --

ERIC

-- We appreciate the company.

Anne Marie's getting cabin fever

already.

WILDER

What'd you say they call these

spaceships?

ERIC

Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.

ANNE MARIE

I call it 'the Turtle,' as in

carrying your home on your back.

ERIC

Best thing is, Meyerling has to

chase around to find us.

ANNE MARIE

(laughs)

The little creep hates it that

Eric actually does what the

company hired him to do.

WILDER

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's

as mean and corrupt as they get.

Cut his mother's throat if it'd

get him a couple votes.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black

and white smoke.

WILDER

Damn.  Likely that's an SOS.

Have to pass on that lunch.

ERIC

We'll go with you.

CUT TO:

WILDER

Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze

to death.

ANNE MARIE

It's not even winter!

WILDER

They got wet in the rain.  Core

body temperature dropped, got

drowsy, probably didn't even know

what was happening.

(CONTINUED)

WILDER

(continuing)

Question is why they sat here

when the storm moved in.  Check

their stuff while I sniff around.

ERIC

They had Emergency Locater

Transmitters, but didn't use

them.

(opens one up; shakes his

head)

Maybe because they didn't bring

batteries.

WILDER

I'm too old for this shit.

ERIC

Any idea who could've done it?

WILDER

A certain sonofabitch bastard

-more-

(CONTINUED)

WILDER (Cont'd)

wearing a damaged mountain boot.

Left a footprint clear as an

autograph.

WILDER

(continuing)

Even for Ben Corbett, this is

nasty.  Man's got balls.  He was

sitting in Devil's Cauldron when

I left, calm as can be.

ANNE MARIE

Thank God.  You can arrest him.

WILDER

Not necessarily.  Corbett's awful

hardbitten these days.

WILDER

(continuing)

His old roaming area's all

private reserve now.  Normally,

long as he stays civil in my

jurisdiction, I let him be.

(beat)

Won't be able to take him by my

lonesome, though.  Nobody in

town'll lift a finger on this.

ERIC

(quietly)

I'll go into town with you.

ANNE MARIE

Eric, leave it alone.  It's not

your business.

ERIC

(shakes his head)

No way can he get away with this.

I'll be back by tonight.

ERIC

Ben Corbett?

CORBETT

Yep.  Afraid you have me at a

disadvantage.

ERIC

Kenai at the general store asked

me to bring these.  Didn't expect

we'd already met.

CORBETT

No big deal.  We just got off on

the wrong foot.  What's your

name?

ERIC

Desmond.

CORBETT

New to the country, kid?

ERIC

Six months.  Ecological study for

Northland Oil.

CORBETT

Ecology.  Folks use that term for

everything but what it means:

who's eating who.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(continuing)

Now, why don't you get around to

saying what you want.

CORBETT

(continuing; smiling)

You wouldn't shoot anyone...

WILDER (OS)

But I would.

CORBETT

All this for laying traps on

private land?

WILDER

You left a footprint at the

Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty

sight there, Ben, 'cause the two

men you didn't shoot and mutilate

died of exposure.

CORBETT

Christ if I shouldn't know better

than to step in soft earth.  I've

seen footprints in the tundra a

hundred years old.

WILDER

(to Eric)

I got it from here.  Thanks.

CORBETT

(to Wilder)

Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks

out of my kit, will you?

(CONTINUED)

KENAI

Before white men came, my people

lived in sod houses underground

and laid our dead on the tundra.

Now we live above ground and bury

our dead, and we haven't been

warm since.

CORBETT

Nice bluff the other day with the

tranquilizer gun out your jeep

window.  See you again, maybe.

ERIC

(unintimidated)

Yeah.  Maybe so.

WILDER

I need to call Fairbanks.

WILDER

(continuing)

Neff!  Dial it up.  State police.

(CONTINUED)

NEFF

(on phone)

Fairbanks Alascom?  Patch me

through to the State Police.

WILDER

(on phone)

This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in

Devil's Cauldron.  Had some

killings here.  I got a suspect;

be real nice if someone came and

took him off my hands.

STATE POLICEMAN (VO)

(thru phone)

On a good day I couldn't spare a

crosswalk guard.  But now, no

way.  Folks're batshit with the

weather turning sour.  Bring him

in yourself.

WILDER

(on phone)

Next plane's not coming 'til next

Monday.

STATE POLICEMAN (VO)

(thru phone)

Sit your suspect out in the cold.

He'll keep.

WILDER

(on phone)

This man's friends ain't gonna

look favorably on his

incarceration.

STATE POLICEMAN (VO)

(thru phone; Mr. Glib)

So shoot him.  Won't have to feed

him that way --

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

Mind if I get some stuff from my

kit?

CORBETT

(continuing)

Sam, listen -- I shot to defend

my man.  Other guy drew first.

WILDER

If that was all, fine.  But

carving him up, stranding the

others, that's too fucking much.

Is everything that walks, crawls,

flies or swims fair game to you?

CORBETT

(softly)

I'll get loose before that plane

comes.

WILDER

Don't try me.  I'll kill you if

it comes to it.

NEFF

Mr. Desmond!

(grins; sticks his hand

out)

Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the

Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell

the boys in DC to keep those

goodies coming.

ERIC

Sure.

NEFF

Snowplow, generator, TV dish...

hell, we get the goddamn Playboy

Channel!  Here, this is for you.

(CONTINUED)

NEFF

(continuing)

Warm to forty below.  Remember,

anything you want, you ask Arthur

Neff.

ANNE MARIE

Did you catch Corbett?

ERIC

Sure did.  He was one of the

trappers we rousted from the Haul

Road.

ANNE MARIE

Was there any trouble?

ERIC

He was sitting in a hot tub with

a hooker.

ANNE MARIE

Going after killers isn't the

same as chasing poachers, Eric.

ERIC

(grins)

Can't help myself.  Corbett's

type always pisses me off.

(hands her the package)

Oh, I found this at the post

office.  Had your name on it.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!

ERIC

You were looking at it in the

catalog.  Don't know where you

can wear it...

ANNE MARIE

I'll wear it for you.  And I can

wear it when we go home.  We

won't be here forever.

ERIC

(frowning)

You make it sound like a prison

sentence.

ANNE MARIE

That's not what I meant.

ERIC

It's exactly what you meant.

ANNE MARIE

Look, why get into this again.

As long as it's working, let's

leave it alone.  It's been nice

so far.  We're together --

ERIC

-- Permanently?

ANNE MARIE

(sighs)

Do I want to be with you

permanently?  Yes, I think I do.

But be with what you do and the

way you live?  That I don't know.

C'mon, Eric, until I met you,

coming back to Alaska was totally

out of the question for me.  But

I'm here.  I'm getting great

pictures, and I'm having fun.

(slips her arms around him)

I love you.

(kisses him)

So shut up and let's eat.

VIKING BOB

I'm looking for some trappers.

Ben Corbett, Mitchell, LeMalle.

Seen 'em?

NEFF

Yesterday.  Said they were going

to Cache.  They were thirsty, but

we were voted dry.

VIKING BOB

Shit.

VIKING BOB

These yours?

KENAI

Gonna make an offer.  Man who

owns them won't need them where

he's going.

(CONTINUED)

WILDER

Back against the bars.  Now.

WILDER

Your brother and the boys left me

some traps to sell for them.

They're gone --

VIKING BOB

-- To Cache.  So I heard.  Ben

never said nothing to me about

selling his gear.

CORBETT

Bob!  They got me on a murder

charge!

WILDER

Sorry, Bob.  I'll have to keep

you here 'til I ship him south.

(CONTINUED)

WILDER

(continuing)

You stupid, greedy, loudmouth

sonofabitch!  He'll have the

others here in a few hours.  You

fucked me up, now you're gonna

help me move him.

KENAI

(shakes head)

Forget it, Sam.  I never work for

free.

ANNE MARIE

I still can't believe I'm being

financed by an oil company.

Especially when they get a look

at these pictures.  Technology in

the wilderness; not too pretty.

(re ELTs)

What's that?

ERIC

I thought I should check our

emergency transmitters.

ERIC

(continuing)

Avalanche season is coming.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

Winter.  Two straight months of

night -- we may never get out of

bed.

(kisses him)

Which would suit me fine.

ERIC

Prolonged darkness makes people

crazy.

ANNE MARIE

Not me.  I'm equipped.

ANNE MARIE

(continuing)

Allow me to give you a practical

demonstration of low-light

infrared photography...

ANNE MARIE

(continuing)

High-tech in the wilderness.

Gets me excited, too.

ERIC

Come here...

(CONTINUED)

VIKING BOB

Ben?

VIKING BOB

(continuing)

Where's Ben Corbett?

KENAI

I have no argument with you, Bob.

Wilder said I could keep his

truck if I drove it ten miles

away from town.

VIKING BOB

Where did they go?

KENAI

He didn't say, but I would guess

the opposite way from here.

CUT TO:

WILDER

I got an emergency on my hands.

WILDER

(to Eric)

...You give us a ride in the

Cessna you got hangared at the

pumping station, we'll be in

Fairbanks in a few hours.

ERIC

That's what we should've done in

the first place.

WILDER

I could've sat tight for the

transport, 'til Bob came poking

around.

CORBETT

(to Wilder; re Anne Marie)

A lot to ask, dragging him away

from such a good-looking girl --

ERIC

(irritated)

-- To take you to jail?  It'll be

my pleasure.

WILDER

(to Eric)

You better get some sleep.

CORBETT

Good idea.  Flying over mountains

can give you some nasty

surprises.  Go too low, one of

the clouds might have a big rock

inside it.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

(hard)

I'll get you there all right.

CUT TO:

WILDER

Goddammit, I don't need this

aggravation.  I'll shoot you,

Ben.  Bank on it.

CORBETT

I don't want to hurt you, Sam.

WILDER

I'm not too old to knock the snot

out of you!

CORBETT

Nothing personal.

ERIC

You want to try that handgun

against this rifle, go ahead.

CORBETT

Some day you might have to face

me without a gun.

WILDER

(thickly)

Fetch him back?

(Eric nods)

Don't let him walk...

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(softly)

Does he have people?

ERIC

(after a beat)

A daughter in Oregon.

CORBETT

Send him down to her.  There's

money in my duffel bag, back at

his cabin.

ERIC

I better call in.

ERIC

(continuing)

Thought of everything, huh?

CORBETT

Surviving is what I know --

ERIC

-- Killing is what you know.

(to Anne Marie)

Pack some food while I prep for

the flight.

(off her look)

I'm sure not gonna let him go.

(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE (OS)

C'mon, girl, talk to me,

negotiate with me...

VIKING BOB

LeMalle.  We got a problem.

Where's Mitchell?

LEMALLE

Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's

inside, boring bastard...

CUT TO:

MITCHELL

(to Viking Bob)

...Ben never sent a signal.

VIKING BOB

Musta never got a chance to

-more-

(CONTINUED)

VIKING BOB (Cont'd)

activate.  Wilder's aiming to

take him to Fairbanks, we can

count on that much.

MITCHELL

Meaning he'll need a plane.

VIKING BOB

Closest planes for hire are here

in Cache.

MITCHELL

Hang on...

(to LeMalle)

Remember that Cessna we saw at

the pumping station on the Haul

Road?  Belongs to the guy they

got patrolling the pipeline.

LEMALLE

There you go.  Wilder's always

chummy with the fuckin'

Bambi-lovers.

VIKING BOB

It's a long shot.

MITCHELL

You got a better idea?

CORBETT

How long have you been up north?

ANNE MARIE

(after a beat)

Six months.

CORBETT

Can't be.  Too keen a sense of

this place in your pictures.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

Six months this time.  I was born

in the Aleutians.

CORBETT

Your people Alaskan?

ANNE MARIE

My dad was a Navy doctor.

CORBETT

Knew you had no native blood,

even with your dark hair.  Blue

eyes give you away.  My wife had

blue eyes.

ANNE MARIE

Had?

CORBETT

She's dead.

ANNE MARIE

Oh.

CORBETT

Had some good years.  Met her in

'66.  She showed up one day in

Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One

Sunday morning, she marched into

a bar and announced she was

available as a wife to the

highest bidder.  Didn't work out

in three months, she'd return the

money and leave, no hard

feelings.

(off Anne Marie's amazed

look)

My bid was eight thousand

dollars.  Beautiful girl.

ANNE MARIE

How did she..?

CORBETT

I was gone, in September, laying

traplines.  She went to our cache

for some meat.  Got mauled by a

bear.  Tore open her skull.

-more-

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT (Cont'd)

Might've lived if she got help,

but the exposed part of her brain

froze.

CORBETT

(continuing)

What about you -- why come back?

Classy girl like you seems more

suited to the finer things.

ANNE MARIE

That's why I left, moved to

Washington.  When I met Eric I

was doing day shoots -- products

and fashion, mostly.  Pretty

dull.  Eric was teaching college,

and then he got the job with

Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay

together, so we talked them into

funding some wilderness

photography... and here I am.

CORBETT

You should know something.

ANNE MARIE

I don't want to talk any more.

CORBETT

Wasn't my intention to hurt

Wilder.  I'm telling you the

truth.  I liked the man.  I only

meant to get loose... to survive.

Your cheechako boyfriend better

understand that.

(beat)

Listen, I've got some money put

away --

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

-- Don't ever think you can buy

Eric off, Mr. Corbett --

ERIC (OS)

-- Cheechako?

ANNE MARIE

(translating)

Outsider.

ERIC

(to Corbett)

Let's go.

ANNE MARIE

Wait a second.

ANNE MARIE

Maybe you should drive him into

Devil's Cauldron, let them decide

what to do with him.

ERIC

(reassuringly)

Fairbanks is a three-hour flight.

I'll be back by dinnertime.

ERIC

(continuing)

Be careful, okay?

ANNE MARIE

That's my line.

CUT TO:

MITCHELL (OS)

Aim for the tires!

CORBETT

Let me out and keep going.  They

catch us, they'll kill you.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

They'll still catch us.  All

you're doing is pissing them off.

VIKING BOB

Get in.  We can jump it.

ERIC

How the hell were they smart

enough to find us?

CORBETT

Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm

sitting in this plane and they're

down there blowing me kisses.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Been driving long?

ERIC

I needed a pilot's license to

take the job here, so I got one

in six weeks.

CORBETT

That makes the flight more

interesting.

CORBETT

(continuing)

See the blood?  Pack of wolves

took down a moose.  Greedy,

gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd

kill the last wolf on earth,

right in front of the President

of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly

predator, the wolf.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

Sounds like professional

jealousy.

CORBETT

Hunting and trapping was a damn

fine life.

(beat)

Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,

we were teams.  I'd always go

with Mitchell.  Good man,

Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry

about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire

a plane in October.  On the way

to a dirt airstrip somewhere,

we'd drop supplies.  We'd land,

tell the pilot to come back for

us a few days before Christmas.

CORBETT

The idea was to get to the

supplies before the bears did.

Along the route we'd set our

traps.  Made our year's living in

three months.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Lot of times we didn't even have

a landing strip.  We'd set down

on a plateau, like that one

there.  Yeah, that one's easy;

you could glide right in...

CORBETT

Hope you got your money's worth

on those lessons.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

Stay put!

CORBETT

You got the belly to look me in

the eye and pull the trigger?

ERIC

Be no different than shooting a

rabid dog.

ERIC

(continuing)

Next time you want to kill

yourself, don't include me.

CORBETT

I took the odds on getting down

in one piece, and I made it.  Now

we're in my territory.

ERIC

With light clothing and no

supplies, this is nobody's

territory.

CORBETT

You sound like the tourists.

Know-it-alls who read about

survival in a magazine.  Fuck

you.  You won't make it off this

mountain.

ERIC

Let's go.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

(re Eric's ankle)

I'm not gonna carry you out of

here.

ERIC

That's right.  You're not.

CORBETT

Look, take these cuffs off.  We

need to work together.

ERIC

Forget it.

ERIC

(continuing)

Last time I checked the flight

plan, we were forty miles

northeast of Devil's Cauldron.

Southwest is that way.  No sense

waiting for a goddamn taxi.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

It'll be interesting, trying to

build a fire without any wood.

CORBETT

Welcome to the environment, Mr.

Ecology.  Out here, one mistake

is all you get.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Why in hell you care enough about

me to die taking me in?

ERIC

I don't plan on dying.

DISSOLVE TO:

ERIC

We'll stop here, dig out a snow

shelter.

CORBETT

Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig.

I'll have a little sit-down.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Even in the drifts, this snow's

too powdery to make a shelter.

When you're done jerking around,

reach down the back of my coat.

(CONTINUED)

CUT TO:

CORBETT

Still quite a hike to Devil's

Cauldron.

(beat)

Days.  A long stretch to go

can hide behind that pistol for

now, but take your eyes off me

long enough to sneeze --

ERIC

-- Turn around.

FADE TO:

END DREAM

CUT TO:

CORBETT

Ice is too thin -- you can see

the water moving underneath.

ERIC

We're not sitting here 'til

November.  There's a cargo plane

coming to Devil's Cauldron in

four days, and I'm putting you on

it.

CORBETT

We get wet, we freeze to death in

a couple hours.

ERIC

I've been on ice like this when I

was a kid, skating.  Spread your

weight, keep moving.  Go on.

CORBETT

(gestures 'you first')

Be my guest.

ERIC

(points .357)

I'm right behind you.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

Wait 'til I'm across!

CORBETT

Most dangerous thing in the

world: A regular Joe, in over his

head.  You trying to prove how

tough you are for me, or for

yourself?

ERIC

It wasn't my idea to crash the

plane.

CORBETT

Let's camp.  There's grayling

under this ice. I'll snare some

for dinner.

ERIC

(standing)

We've got another two hours of

daylight.

CORBETT

Pushing it is flat wrong.  All

you prove is your ignorance about

breaking trail.

MEYERLING

I've been trying to raise you on

the shortwave for two days.

ANNE MARIE

Have you talked to Eric?

MEYERLING

I have not, but I very much want

to.  What do you know about the

trouble in Devil's Cauldron?

ANNE MARIE

I was hoping you had some news --

MEYERLING

-- Get this straight: I'm the

District Supervisor.  Whatever

you do reflects on me.  It wasn't

my idea to bring you people up

here, but I'm stuck with you.

You are absolutely not to involve

yourself in any local disputes.

Whichever side you take, you

alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett

is quite well-known in this

region.  People admire him --

ANNE MARIE

-- Corbett's a killer.

(CONTINUED)

MEYERLING

I don't care if Ben Corbett makes

meatloaf out of nuns and babies,

he's not your concern.

Understood?

MEYERLING

(continuing)

What happened here?

ANNE MARIE

The radio's on the fritz.

MEYERLING

Where'd you say Eric is?

ANNE MARIE

Somewhere along the pipeline.

MEYERLING

What about that hotheaded

marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he

was in the middle of this mess.

ANNE MARIE

Sam?  We haven't seen him.

MEYERLING

Really.  I thought maybe that was

his snowmobile outside.

(beat)

By the way -- your truck also 'on

the fritz?'

ANNE MARIE

(blanching)

Why?

MEYERLING

It's out by the pumping station,

shot full of holes.

MEYERLING

(continuing)

Still nothing to tell me?

(no reply)

Suit yourself.

CORBETT

Have to backtrack, find another

way down.

ERIC

Forget it.  It would take days.

CORBETT

(assessing the drop)

Going to be a bit of a challenge

with handcuffs on.

You'll want to hear about it with

God almighty, how I hate the U.S.

government.

LOGGER

We should pass a hat.  Send

Corbett a few bucks.  We owe him.

Hold it.  Meyerling told me that

LEMALLE

He's full of shit.  We got run

out of there by some fuckhead

driving a Northland truck.

VIKING BOB

I called the cops in Fairbanks,

see when Ben is standing trial.

They don't know shit about Ben or

Wilder!

LEMALLE

Get the fuck out of here.

VIKING BOB

It's a three-hour flight.  They

shoulda got there yesterday.

LEMALLE

Maybe they went back to Devil's

Cauldron.

MITCHELL

Naah, Wilder knows we got friends

in town.

VIKING BOB

That plane might've been to throw

us off the track.  Remember the

bait-and-switch Wilder pulled

with the Eskimo and his truck?

(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE

Wilder still woulda made

Fairbanks by now.  Fuck a duck!

Ben musta got loose.

VIKING BOB

Okay, let's backtrack, try to

pick up his trail.  You know the

kid out on the pipeline that

Wilder's buddies with?

MITCHELL

(smiles)

We were just talking about him.

CORBETT

(shouts over WIND)

Just gather birch.  It'll smoke

like hell, but it'll burn green.

CORBETT

I need your pocket knife.

(Eric hesitates)

I have to eat, too.

CORBETT

Damn lucky this storm didn't blow

down when we were on those

baldheaded mountains.  It

continues, we better stay put.

ERIC

It could blow over tomorrow, too.

CORBETT

I'm still figuring: You're either

real brave or real dumb.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

I just want this over with.

CORBETT

(laughs)

Where in hell Meyerling dig you

ERIC

You know Meyerling?

CORBETT

Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss

your ass with precision if

there's a vote in it.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Always eat your meat raw when the

weather's cold.  Does you more

good, long as the entrails look

clean.

ERIC

I'll hold onto that.

CORBETT

Sure love to know where you fit

in up here.

ERIC

I'm here to do my job.

CORBETT

You want to fool yourself about

that bullshit job, fine.  Damn

shame you have to drag your

girlfriend along.  You think a

woman like that will be happy

making moose stew for a man

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT (Cont'd)

making your salary?  Look, I'll

give you five grand.  Take the

money and go home where you both

belong.

ERIC

Don't fucking insult me.

CORBETT

Folks come to Alaska for a real

short list of reasons:  Money.

Adventure.  Solitude.  Those

cover most everyone.  But

frontiers also draw another type

of man.  One with a demon in his

gut.  He comes to the edge of the

world to face that demon, and lay

it to rest.

ERIC

Yeah?

CORBETT

Yep.  Sometimes they do, but

usually they end up crazy or

dead.

Too bad we're heading west.

There's a snowmobile. Inside a

day we could be on the Yukon.  I

smart.  Take it and walk away.

ERIC

You don't get it, do you?

ERIC

Stop!

CORBETT

Nothing personal.  Just wanted to

CORBETT

Have to get these wet things off.

ERIC

You're not going to slow us down!

Keep moving!

CORBETT

Inside of three hours you'd be

If that means freeze my balls

I'll be okay.

CORBETT

Told you I'm fine!

ERIC

(holds up three fingers)

How many do you see?

CORBETT

What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.

ERIC

You don't feel cold?

CORBETT

It's a spring day...

ERIC

Wake up, goddammit!  You've got

classic hypothermia --

crankiness, fatigue, can't feel

your coldness.  Worst thing you

can do is fade out.

ERIC

One more thing -- this doesn't

mean we're going steady.

ERIC

Stay still.

CORBETT

Where's my ELT?

ERIC

Emergency transmitter?  All your

gear is back at Wilder's.

CORBETT

You got one?

ERIC

It was blown up with the plane.

CORBETT

Too bad.  We'd be out of here in

a few hours.

ERIC

How?  Nobody this far north

monitors that frequency until

avalanche season.

Besides, I'm surprised a tough

guy like you uses fancy

CORBETT

I'm surprised a flat-ender like

you knows cold-weather remedies.

ERIC

Read a lot of adventure stories

CORBETT

I'm hungry.  Go kill me some

CORBETT

Used to see the natives eating

roots when I was a kid in Nome.

ERIC

Nome?  I figure you'd be a

whaler, coming from there.

CORBETT

Told that's what our old man was.

Planned on going to sea, me and

Bob, 'til I read Jack London.

Started trapping when I was ten.

Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight

bucks for a skunk, three for a

muskrat.

(off Eric's look)

That was fine money.

ERIC

Killing wildlife not good enough

anymore, so you go on to bigger

and better things.

CORBETT

You got a knack for seeing things

the way you want to see them.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Don't judge me.  You're a joke,

coming here from a fucked-up

culture, telling us what to do!

ERIC

Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's

not too late to keep that from

happening here.

CORBETT

(temper flaring)

All you do is keep folks from

working the land, living like

they're meant to.  You don't

understand shit!  Trappers,

hunters -- we're part of the

environment.  Who's protecting

us?

from the rest of us as possible.

CORBETT

I'm real sad you don't approve of

me.

CORBETT

Tell me what I should do,

Professor.  You got all the

answers.  I shouldn't hunt?

Fine, I'll just phone up and have

a salad delivered.

Cowardly bastard.  I'm in

ERIC

They think you're in Fairbanks.

If not, they still won't find you

CORBETT

Don't bet on it.

ERIC

I already have.

CORBETT

You don't know how true that is.

ERIC

We'll wait here until nightfall.

No fire, no tarp.

CORBETT

Didn't mean it, you being a

coward.  You're a lot of things,

but chickenshit isn't one of

them.

ERIC

Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you

what scares me -- stumbling

through life, like an ordinary

jerk.  That's why I want to work

on the front lines, where what I

do means something.

Soon as I got here, I realized my

job was bullshit.  Oil company

propaganda.  I was ready to

leave, then I thought screw it,

I'll outsmart them, do the work

anyway.

I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am

fooling myself.  That's what I'm

Sundays.  See her friends, 'cause

I was away so much.

Should've been home that day.

She'd be getting dressed right

about now...

VIKING BOB

My guess is he's loose and

heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll

need supplies; that's the closest

settlement without a lawman.

LEMALLE

I ain't gonna leave a seven-

NEFF

You don't mind me saying, Mr.

ERIC

Have you heard anything from the

NEFF

Not a damn thing.  What's going

on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all

steamed up, looking for you.

ERIC

Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett

with me --

NEFF

-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?

ERIC

Back at my place... he, uh, broke

his leg.

NEFF

If Corbett's men find out --

ERIC

-- I'm putting him on the plane

to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.

NEFF

Jiminy Christmas.

What do you want from me?

ERIC

Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to

my place on the Haul Road, tell

Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit

tight.

(CONTINUED)

NEFF

I'll go at dawn.

ERIC

Thanks.  Don't tell anyone you

saw me.

NEFF

Why the smirk?

KENAI

Bet I could make some money

turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe

more for lettin' him loose.

(off Neff's flustered look)

I was up in my cache.  Saw the

Northland man come talk to you.

NEFF

You're out of your greedy goddamn

mind.

KENAI

Corbett coming here stinks of

trouble.  We should make the best

of it before it turns around and

bites us in the ass.

NEFF

Stay out of it.

CORBETT

Talk to that good-looking girl of

yours?

ERIC

You broke the radio, remember?

CORBETT

(smiles)

I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like

a clever kid.

CORBETT

(continuing)

You were real resourceful out

there.  Got me thinking of this

perimeter man, froze all his

fingers one winter.  So he hacked

the tips off and sharpened the

exposed bones.  Gets along better

than ever.  Yeah, maybe I

underestimated you.

ERIC

I liked you better frozen.  You

didn't talk so much.

CORBETT

You're damn lucky, glimpsing this

country before it's ruined, gone

for good.  You saw wonders you'd

only dreamed of.  That alone

makes you different than the

sorry bastards back where you

came from, because you have

dreamt them.

CORBETT

(continuing)

Remember that demon in the gut?

Sometimes it's nothing more than

wondering if the so-called

civilized life has bred the balls

and brains out of you.  That's

what you want out of this, isn't

it?

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

All I want want is you in jail --

NEFF

(explaining)

He saw you and Corbett come in...

KENAI

Dixie's waiting at the infirmary.

She'll put a splint on that

injured leg.

NEFF

Don't let him fool you.  Real

reason he's here is to buy

Corbett's traps.

ERIC

(to Kenai)

Okay.  You can talk to him.  But

I'll keep the keys with me.

DIXIE

Earl says you get discount.

Twenty-five dollar.

NEFF

(apologetically)

Look, Ben, we don't want any

trouble.  The kid's got the key,

and besides, he looks edgy enough

to use that magnum he's carrying.

CORBETT

Relax.  I'll get loose in time.

KENAI

Any traps you don't want, I'll

pay cash money.

CORBETT

Guess someone should use them.

Open the bottom drawer in

Wilder's desk.  My kit's in

there.  Might as well unload

everything.

DIXIE

I wash your back for you.  You

will like it.

MEYERLING

I hate to interrupt playtime, but

why the hell are you caught up in

a local matter when I gave you

express instructions to the

contrary?!

ERIC

Cut the shit, Leo.  I might need

They got nice beds upstairs,

honey.

LEMALLE

I'm standin' guard duty.

Besides, rather spend the room

money on sloppy seconds.

Hey, Tiger --

(CONTINUED)

MEYERLING

Alleged killer.

ERIC

What does this matter to you?

MEYERLING

(sneering)

You can't see past your lousy

little assignment, sniffing

around the pipeline.  The few

voters there are in this district

look up to Corbett, and I'm not

about to alienate them.

ERIC

I should release Corbett because

you want some votes?

MEYERLING

This miserable wilderness is a

state of the union.  Policy's

made here the same way as in the

civilized world: at the ballot

box.  That's the beauty of it --

these icebox cowboys are living a

century too late.  Get them on

your side, it's like buying

Manhattan for beads.  With a

handful of votes you control the

greatest frontier since white men

stumbled onto the New World.

ERIC

Some day these people'll wake up,

and you'll be the first one

they'll run out of here.

ERIC

(continuing)

Shit...

(to Meyerling; distracted)

Do what you have to.  So will I.

LEMALLE

Northwest.  Devil's Cauldron.

NEFF

What's wrong?

ERIC

Just stay out of my face until

I'm gone!

ERIC

(continuing; picks up ELT)

Emergency transmitter?  What

happened to signal mirrors or

two-tone smoke fires?

CORBETT

Lets us watch each other's backs

over a wide area.  Only thing

messed me up this time was

getting arrested in the baths.

ELT was in my duffel bag, not

around my neck where it should've

been.

ERIC

No way they'll find you on a

five-minute signal.  And no way

CORBETT

Flashbomb, eh?

END MONTAGE

ERIC

I need to rent a cabin.

KENAI

What's the problem with Sam

Wilder's place?

ERIC

Will you rent me a cabin, or not?

KENAI

Pretty clever:  If the trappers

got that signal beacon and get

here in time, Sam's is the first

place they'll look.  They may

figure you're waiting for an

airplane, so you can't stay in

the shack by the airstrip.  Last

place they'd expect you is on the

far side of town.

(shakes his head)

I can't afford any trouble --

ERIC

(takes out all his cash)

-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And

if you or anyone else will back

me up on this --

KENAI

(grabs money)

-- Forget it.  And try not to

bleed on my throw rugs.

(walks away, then turns

back)

Why do this?

If you have to ask, you wouldn't

understand.

ANNE MARIE

Eric!  Why aren't you in

Fairbanks?

ANNE MARIE

(continuing)

Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four

days!  I thought you were dead,

ERIC

You can't stay here.  Go back to

the Turtle.  I'll meet you back

there in a few hours.

ANNE MARIE

(stung by his coolness)

What's going on?

ERIC

I'll tell you everything later.

ANNE MARIE

Where's Corbett?

ERIC

Here.  A transport plane is due

at eleven.  Once I put him on it,

it's all over.

ANNE MARIE

So what's the problem?

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

There isn't one, unless Corbett's

men get here before the plane

does.

ANNE MARIE

Let the people here handle it.

It's their marshal Corbett

killed!

ERIC

Please, Anne Marie, you being

here only complicates things.

ANNE MARIE

I'm staying.

ERIC

Take the snowmobile, park it

behind Wilder's cabin.

INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

NEFF

I was just on my way to your

ladyfriend's, but I guess she

found you.

ERIC

Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last

night.

NEFF

I'm the one should be sorry...

Goddamn Kenai, always out for a

score.  I never should've let him

go over there.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

I'd sure like that favor you

offered a while back.

NEFF

Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count

on it turning this ugly.

ERIC

What are you talking about?

NEFF

Bastards killed Sam, you think

they won't kill the rest of us?

ERIC

There'll be three, four men at

the most.  I have some backup,

nothing will happen.

NEFF

I'm real sorry.  In a while,

you're gone from this country.

But we live here.  No one wants

to mix it up with those hombres.

ERIC

(angry)

You don't care enough about Sam

to --

NEFF

-- Sam Wilder was my cousin.

He's why I came to Alaska.  All

his letters, saying what a

paradise it is.  But me ending up

dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

ANNE MARIE

You're hurt.

ERIC

Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have

to hurry.

CORBETT

Could've told you no one would

help...

CORBETT

(continuing; to Anne Marie)

Maybe you can talk sense into

your boyfriend.

ERIC

Shut up!

CORBETT

(to Anne Marie)

Either way, you better clear out.

I don't want anyone innocent

getting harmed.

ERIC

We're moving.  Let's go.

ERIC

You'll catch a chill by that dumb

waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.

I'm right fuckin' here with you.

LEMALLE (OS)

Ben!  Speak out before I torch

every dump in town!

ERIC

CORBETT

You kill me, you sign your death

warrant.

(re Anne Marie)

LEMALLE

You hear me?  Ben?

VIKING BOB

(to LeMalle)

Ease off.  We do this my way.

VIKING BOB

Whoever's holding Ben Corbett,

listen to me: we just want to

know he's okay.  He is, nobody

gets hurt.

CORBETT

They know I'm here.  I don't say

something, they'll plow this town

under.  You willing to accept

that responsibility?

ERIC

Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll

kill you if they rush us.

CORBETT

(shouts through window)

Bob?

CORBETT (OS)

Relax.  I got a nervous man here

with a magnum up my nose.

(CONTINUED)

VIKING BOB

You in one piece?

CORBETT (OS)

I'm fine.  Look forward to seeing

you...

VIKING BOB

Count on it.

LEMALLE

(to Viking Bob)

Sweet-talk won't get shit.

(calls out)

Choose it, asswipe -- cut Corbett

loose, or soon as you come

outside, I put a fuckin' bullet

through your eye!

CORBETT

Snow's to their advantage, kid.

You can't see them, but soon as

that plane comes, they'll sure as

hell know where we're going.

Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon.

I'll give you that money and

guarantee you'll walk away.

ERIC

Why offer a buyoff with your

gunmen waiting outside?

CORBETT

The time has passed for men like

them and me.  I know it.  But

they're still fighting for

survival, like cornered animals.

That's why they'll kill you.

Ben?

CORBETT

At least your girl had the sense

to jump ship.  Too bad she's the

only one small enough to fit

through that dumb waiter.

VIKING BOB

Just wait, we don't know what

this guy's up to.  Ben'll let us

know what to do.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

Your infrared camera?

ANNE MARIE

(nods)

Technology in the wilderness.

Only problem is talking to you on

your way to the landing strip.

ERIC

I've got an idea.  We'll have to

work fast.

VIKING BOB

There's what they're waiting on!

MITCHELL

(smiles tightly)

They'll have to come right past

us.

ERIC

When you ran off, I thought you'd

keep going 'til you were back

home in Washington.

ANNE MARIE

My home is here.  With you.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE (OS)

(over PA)

They're moving toward you!

ANNE MARIE (OS)

(over PA)

They're fanning out.

LEMALLE

(to Viking Bob)

Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck

she seein' us?

VIKING BOB

Doesn't matter.  We know where

they're going.  C'mon.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

(into mic)

One is moving back toward the

cabins.

DIXIE

Earl, it's crazy to go out there.

(CONTINUED)

KENAI

I hear someone in the spa.

ERIC

(to Corbett)

That'll keep him out of the cold.

ERIC

He'll live.

(CONTINUED)

ANNE MARIE

(gasping)

Don't make me shoot.

ANNE MARIE

(continuing)

We're going to Sam's cabin.  You

can stay in the jail until this

is over.

LEMALLE

Want to chance it with that

hog-leg?  You can't even hold it

up.  Better drop me first shot,

bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'

lungs out.

(CONTINUED)

KENAI

(disgusted)

Lookit this damn mess.  Where in

hell's Wilder?

NEFF

(after a beat)

Dead.  Trappers killed him.

KENAI

Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was

trouble.

(to Meyerling)

What about you, big shot?  Do

something.  Who's side are you

on, anyway?

MEYERLING

Hey, I thought you people loved

Corbett and his wild men!

KENAI

This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for

business.  I'm sick of it.

MEYERLING

What about you, Neff?

NEFF

Well... two of the trappers are

down already --

MEYERLING

(suddenly on the bandwagon)

-- One left; three of us.  Let's

finish it.

NEFF

What about Eric Desmond?

MEYERLING

I'll handle him.

(CONTINUED)

LEMALLE

(whispers)

Over there...

MITCHELL

(whispers)

Hold it.  You might hit Ben.

LEMALLE

Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming

at.

MITCHELL

Let 'em come closer first...

(CONTINUED)

MITCHELL

Glad to see you're okay.  I told

LeMalle not to shoot.

(tries to smile)

Had some fine seasons, didn't

we...

CORBETT

(to Eric)

Fifteen years on the trail with

this man, I never saw him rise to

anger.

CORBETT

(continuing; bitterly)

Your first kill.  How does it

taste?

PILOT

(into radio mic)

Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just

touched down in Devil's Cauldron.

Nobody's here to greet me like

usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm

getting scarce.

ANNE MARIE

You can't leave yet.

PILOT

It's my responsibility to get

this aircraft out of here safely.

PILOT

(continuing)

You got to be kidding.

ANNE MARIE

Leave the engines idling.  Go

back and open the side door.

MEYERLING

Nobody wants any more killings;

we all agree to that, correct?

(no one argues)

That's good.  Now, Eric, you're

gonna hand your prisoner over to

us.

ERIC

Fuck you.

MEYERLING

This isn't your concern.  It's

over, here and now.

CORBETT

(to Meyerling)

Sure, when you put a bullet in my

back on the way out.  Easier for

all involved.

MEYERLING

Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben.

There's no room in Alaska for you

any more.

MEYERLING

(continuing)

You're as antiquated as this

shit.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

Keep back.

CORBETT

You're quite a piece of work,

Meyerling.  The tide changes, you

ride right along with it.

ERIC

Neff, you know better than

this...

NEFF

You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.

Step aside; stay out of it.

(CONTINUED)

ERIC

(continuing)

Anybody moves and I'll shoot!

ERIC

(continuing)

Can you walk?

CORBETT

Wound's a through-and-through.

Missed my liver, I think.

ERIC

Let's get out of here.

ERIC

How come you didn't let him shoot

me?

CORBETT

(softly)

Like I said, I'd still be up on

that mountain, frozen solid, it

wasn't for you.

ERIC

We'll get you to a hospital, soon

as we get to Fairbanks.

(CONTINUED)

CORBETT

So they can patch me up and put

me in a cage?  Forget it.

Meyerling's right -- I'm a

dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like

him, it's their turn with this

land.  Put me in the woods, let

me live or die on my own.

CORBETT

(continuing; peers out

window)

Look down there, tell me what any

of this matters.  Struggles of

men get swallowed by the bigness.

Soon there won't be a trace of

our troubles... or us.

ERIC

You're wrong.  Everything we do

leaves its mark.  You said it

yourself -- there are hundred-

year-old footprints in the

tundra.

CUT TO:

PILOT

(to himself)

Too damn crazy in this state

anymore.  I'm moving back to L.A.
