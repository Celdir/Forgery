Never Was anybody like Janis.

BILLY

(smiles)

Never was anybody like you...

SUSAN

his hand away ,a

clicking sound in

her throat)

You can't take anything seriously.

BILLY

(smiles)

You're right.

Gentlemen. For your own safety

real fear in his

voice)

panic)

For Christ's sake, just GET on the

Bomb!  He's got a bomb!

AMERICAN PASSENGER

Bomb!  Bomb!

FIRST OFFICER

(yells out)

It's hashish. just a smuggler.

SOLDIERS (OFF)

relaxing, chuckling)

Hashish...smuggler...hippy...

SUSAN

...Billy...?

FIRSTOFFICER (OFF)

Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum...

BILLY (OFF)

CAMERAMAN

No.. He's smiling. Make him look

FIRST OFFICER

CUT:

BILLY

(trying to explain,

innocent)

I forgot... I really did.

(makes ineffective

gestures)

THIRD OFFICER

(screaming at SECOND

OFFICER)

You idiot, you fool. You told me

the American was searched... and

he's pulling hashish out of his

boots!  You're all dogshit!

SECOND OFFICER

(turning on First

Officer, screaming)

You worthless piece of garbage,

where did you learn to search a

prisoner?  He's been in our custody

for an hour, etc.

FIRST OFFICER

(screaming at the

others)

Who searched him?  Who?

BILLY

(protesting)

That's it! That's all I have!

CUT:

VOICE (OFF)

Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok?

TEX

(smiling, extends

Billy's clothes)

I think these gentlemen have

finished for the time being if

you'd like to put your clothes on.

CUT:

DETECTIVE

(thickly accented

English, sympathetic)

Are you afraid, Vilyum?

BILLY

No, I'm not afraid.

DETECTIVE

Good. There's nothing to be afraid

of. If you co-operate with us, you

will be on the plane for New York

tomorrow... yes?

BILLY

(softly, hoping)

Yes...?

DETECTIVE

Good. Now, where did you get the

hashish?

BILLY

A cabdriver. He picked me up in

the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.

DETECTIVE

Would you recognize him again?

BILLY

Yes.  I think so.

DETECTIVE

Good.  Would you go back to the

Pudding Shoppe now and point him

out to my men if you see him?

BILLY (OFF)

Yes.

TEX

(casual tone)

You decided to fly at a bad time

Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all

over the place blowing up planes

and all.

BILLY

(shakes his head)

Stupid.

TEX

Four planes in four days...but I

guess you kids don't read the

newspapers...and what with our

people kicking up a shit storm

'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey

you got...

BILLY

But didn't have heroin.

TURK

(grins)

Well I'm not up on all that. A

drug's a drug seems to me Billy

and...

BILLY

(sweating)

But it was my first time. I'm not

really a smuggler, was just two

kilos.

TEX

Well, you see Billy, it don't really

matter right now if it's 2 kilos

or 200 kilos. The Turks love to

catch any foreigner smuggling - it

shows the world they're fighting

the drug trade.

BILLY

But just...

TEX

Just what?

BILLY

I just needed some extra money.  I

was broke, the guy offered me the

hash and...

BILLY

...are you with the Consulate?

TEX

(not looking at him)

Something like that. Cigarette?

TEX

How much you pay this joker...

this cab driver?

BILLY

Two hundred dollars. It was my

last two hundred.

TEX

How much did you figure to make?

BILLY

Three, four thousand...I don't

know.  The guy offered me the hash--

(shakes his head)

...it just seemed like easy money.

TEX

Beats working.

BILLY

I was just going to sell it to

friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.

TEX

Got a family back there?

BILLY

(inhales deeply)

Yeah. Parents, brother, sister.

Babylon, Long Island.

TEX

What's your father do?

BILLY

He sells insurance for Metropolitan

Life.

TEX

(a pause, not looking

at Billy)

Be tough on 'em.

TEX

Girlfriend?

BILLY

...She was on the plane.

BILLY

She didn't know anything about...I

wouldn't have wanted her to.

TEX

Lucky girl.

BILLY

Jeez, she used to say I was the

lucky one.

TEX

Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure

hope so.

CUT:

HIPPIES (OFF)

(in passing, low)

Hey Janet, why don't you go sell

'em some dope.

TEX

You seem like a nice enough kid to

me Billy, but try it and I'll blow

your fucking brains out.

BILLY VOICE

Dear Mom and Dad. This is the

hardest letter I've ever had to

write. know the confusion and the

pain it will cause you.  And the

disappointment...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

I really thought knew what I was

doing with my life. I'd hoped

somehow to get out of this quickly

so that you'd never know about it.

But that just isn't possible now.

I don't know what's going to happen.

But what can I say to you?  Will

'I'm sorry' make a difference?

Will it ease the pain, the shame

you must be feeling?  Forgive

me...Please...

CUT:

ZIAT VOICE (OFF)

Git!

BILLY

Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?

Blanket?

(makes a gesture of

a blanket wrapped

around him)

ZIAT

(in English)

Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow...

ZIAT

(through the bars)

You be here tomorrow.  "Ayi

Gedjaler"("good night")

VOICE (OFF)

Pssst!

VOICE (OFF)

(Whispering)

Your cell, no key.  Open...!

Blanket. Three cell down. You get

me one. Take...

VOICE (OFF)

Ziat go for night.  Go!

ZIAT

(tugging the sheet,

growls)

Brack!...Brack!

ZIAT

You, goddamn you, give me sheet.

Give me!

CUT:

CUT:

HAMIDOU

(to one of the guards)

Name?

GUARD

(checking a clipboard)

Vilyum Hi-yes

HAMIDOU

(looking at BILLY,

repeating it)

Vilyum Hi-yes...

HAMIDOU

Vilyum Hi-yes

BILLY

It was cold. Cold! I get blanket.

Blanket! Cold!

HAMIDOU

(In some sort of

English, smiles)

No do. No do.

SHARP CUT:

CUT:

VOICE

(close, intense)

Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his

feet gonna swell up worse.

2ND VOICE

(softer, sonorous,

Swedish accent)

We take him down to courtyard...

BELL

Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the

pain.

BELL

You gotta walk around some man, or

your feet gonna swell up something

bad...

BELL (OVER)

You've been out for days man,

talking all kinds of shit. Come

on, we'll walk you down to the

courtyard.

ERICH

Okay?

ERICH

How's it feel?

BILLY

(dizzy)

About as good as it looks.

BELL

Getchmis olsun

BILLY

Getchmis...?

BELL

Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm

Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich

something Swedish.

ERICH

(smiling)

Just Erich.

BILLY

I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used

to be.

BILLY

Looks like a cheap hotel.

BELL

Yeah... Only the room service is

lousy.  Come on, let me show you

the tennis courts.

ERICH

(watching Billy

limp)

Feeling all right?

BILLY

(still groggy)

Yeah.  That guy who beat me?

(stops, slightly

puzzled)

I feel stoned.

BELL

(grins, interjects)

'Figgers.

BILLY

(vague, going on)

...He had a bald skull and...

BELL

Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards.

Don't fuck with him. He almost

killed an Italian dude couple months

ago.  Bad news. He try anything

with you?

BILLY

No... I don't remember.

BELL

With these fucking Turks, soon as

the light goes out... I keep one

hand on their feet and their feet

better not grow.  You'll meet Max.

He got raped something bad down in

Section 13. That's the pits.

BILLY

The kids? Why are they...

BELL

(snorts)

Little fuckers are thieves, rapists,

pickpockets, murderers, you name

it - they do it. Don't trust any

of 'em...

BELL (OVER)

...They tell Ziat everything. He's

the squeal round here. Goes all

over the prison.  Sells watered-

down tea, blankets, hash, black

money, nembutols --anything for a

buck...

BELL

(continuous)

He was an informer on the outside

but he tried to screw the cops out

of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him,

he's a fox.

BELL (OVER)

Whatcha' in for, smuggling? Rash?

BILLY

Yeah.

BELL

(shaking his head)

History, man, history. How much?

BILLY

Two kilos.

BELL

Where?

BILLY

The airport. Trying to get on the

plane for the States.

BELL

(whistling a kind

of punctuation)

Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe

even twenty.

BILLY

(tensing)

Twenty months?

BELL

Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS!

I figger ten at the least.

BILLY

(soft)

Years?

BELL

Yeah, what do you think this is,

the good USA? This is Turkey, man...

(laughs bitterly))

It's a fucking accident here if

you're innocent. And anyway...

...ain't nobody who's innocent.

ERICH

(his English is

halting but has a

calming effect)

Don't pay too much attention,

anything is possible in Turkey.

You might get bail.

ERICH

...If you make bail, you're free.

You can get a fake passport or

sneak across the border to Greece.

The Greeks hate the Turks so much

they never send you back. The Turks

know it. They just keep the bail.

money.

BELL

Sure, keep dreaming and see where

that gets you... like Max, up in

the head, you know...

(makes a crazy signal

towards the head)

You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia

beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste

a hamburger 'gain cause you broke

the law man, and you got caught...

(grins)

And that... is history.

ERICH

The law is sometimes wrong.

BELL

(eyes feverish)

The Law is never wrong, asshole.

The Law is!

ERICH

New people sometimes get on his

nerves.

BILLY

(lifeless)

What did he do?

ERIC

He was caught steeling from a

Mosque.  That's heavy here.  He

got 30 years.

BILLY

Thirty years?

ERICH

Jimmy has more balls than brains.

He didn't tell his parents he was

in jail for a year and a half.  He

says he got himself in and now

he's going to get himself out.

BILLY

And you?

ERICH

Hashish.  Ninety percent of the

foreigners are in for hashish.

BILLY

What they give you?

ERICH

(passive)

Twelve years.

BILLY

How much did you have?

ERICH

A hundred grams.

BILLY

(appalled)

It's not fair!

ERICH

There is no fair in Turkey, Billy.

It's all "sula-bula" like this,

like that. An Italian hippie had a

car accident and a Turk was killed.

SO, they threw him in here for six

months...

BILLY

That doesn't seem so bad.

ERICH

But he was eating lunch a mile

away when the Turk smashed into

killed himself.

BILLY

He wasn't even in the car?

ERICH

(shakes his head)

Aslan, there...

(points)

ERICH (OVER)

Killed a guy. But his father's a

big gangster on the docks.  A

"Kapidiye."  He'll stay in... twelve

months no more, and get parole. In

Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek".

ERICH

You just got to get yourself a

good lawyer.  And some money...

Talk to Max.  He's been in the

longest.

BILLY

How long?

ERICH

Seven years...

CUT:

MAX

(smiles)

Gastro.  Stomach medicine. Has

codeine in it... Best can do

ERICH

Lawyers?

MAX

Yeah... there's no straight lawyers

in Turkey... They're all bent bent

as hairpins...

ERICH

His name?

MAX

Who?

ERICH

The lawyer?

MAX

What lawyer?

ERICH

Who got the Frenchman out?

MAX

Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but

I...don't know anything...

'bout...Yesil...

MAX

Best way is get your ass out...

any... way... you can...

BILLY

What do you mean?

MAX

Get the... midnight... express.

BILLY

What's that?

CUT:

FATHER

Billy!

BILLY

Dad!

BILLY

Dad...I'm...

FATHER

(voice quivering)

...Don't worry about it.

(managing a smile)

I can punch you in the nose later.

Right now we've got to get you out

of here.  You all right?

BILLY

(eyes moistening)

Yeah. How's Mom?

FATHER

Bad. She couldn't make the trip.

You know Her boy...

(breaks off)

Susan told us before we got your

letter. She's fine; she's trying

to get the money to come back and

see you, but...

BILLY

No, don't let her!  I'll... How

about Peg? Robbie?

FATHER

Same. None of the neighbors know.

We told them you were in a hospital

in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley

Davis. He's the American Consul

here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer

you wanted...

DAVIS

(shaking hands)

Hello, Billy.

BILLY

Hello.

DAVIS

I want you to know we're going to

do everything, in our power to get

you out as soon as possible. Believe

me.

BILLY

Thank you.

YESIL

Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.

BILLY

Mr. Yesil.

YESIL

I know exactly what you feel but

you must not worry, we are acting

immediately, we get the right court,

the right judge,  I arrange

everything - just right.  And I

think we get you bail. If very

bad, maybe twenty month sentence...

But I think we get you bail...

YESIL

(reassuringly)

You know I have lectured at the

University of Maryland in your

country?  Also University Michigan

Very nice country. We both go back.

(smiles)

BILLY

(trying to

concentrate)

If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they

say it's easy to cross the border

into Greece?

FATHER

(pacing up, hungry)

Right!  That's what we're shooting

for.  Mister Davis and have been

in contact with the State

Department, but right now relations

with the Turks aren't too good,

Nixon's upset the hell out of them.

Our best bet's... right here.

BILLY

Dad...

(pauses, glances at

Davis and Yesil,

embarrassed)

I'll pay you back for all this, I

Promise.

FATHER

Don't worry about it.  Right now

money doesn't count. Okay?

FATHER

Where'd you get that limp?

BILLY

(not wanting to

alarm him)

Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.

BILLY

Where you staying, Dad?

FATHER

(pulls up a seat

next to Billy)

The Hilton.

BILLY

How do you like it?  Istanbul?

FATHER

Well, it's an interesting place...

(lowers his voice,

a hint of a smile)

Tell you the truth, I think the

food is lousy. The crap they sell

in these little restaurants. I

went out to eat in one of them

last night, and I had to run to

the damn toilet... You shoulda'

seen the toilet.

BILLY

You mean you got toilets?

FATHER

Yeah, with real toilet paper - and

you don't have to use both sides.

FATHER

So now I'm eating at the Hilton

every night.

FATHER

Why'd you do it, Billy?

BILLY

For the money...

(Looks away))

FATHER

(sighs)

I know you kids smoke that stuff,

and we drink booze, but taking it

across a border - it was stupid,

Billy. Stupid.

BILLY

I know.

BILLY

Dad get me out of here.

BILLY

Okay.

CUT:

PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)

THE world is now looking at Turkey.

We are called the Heroin Supplier

of the world.  Stories about us

are in newspapers and on television

every day all around the world.

The time has come, your Honor, to

alter this image before we find

ourselves isolated and morally

ostracized by the rest of the human

race...

PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER)

(continuous)

...We must alter this image by

punishing only our own drug

smugglers-but by handing out

foreigners who infest our culture

with their depravity ungodly and

behavior.  We must start now - by

sentencing this American, Vilyum

Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence

for smuggling, to be held up to

the light of the world as an example

of Turkish justice and its intention

to halt the drug trade once and

for all.. .I ask the Court therefore

to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life

Imprisonment.

JUDGE

Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court

will now recess to consider its

verdict.

BILLY

What'd the Prosecutor say?

YESIL

(hurried)

It's not important, just technical

things. We make our case.  You

were very good, you spoke well.

The Judge like you. It look good.

Don't worry.

BILLY

(pressing)

Did you ask for bail?

CUT:

JUDGE

The Defendant has been found guilty

by the Court of the illegal

possession of Hashish...

JUDGE

...Therefore. this court sentences

you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned

at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of

four years and two months. This

Case is now closed.

YESILF

Four years, two months. It's good.

FATHER

(stunned)

Four years!

YESIL

(quickly)

We appeal it.

YESIL

You will see, he will have maybe

one year taken off this sentence

for good behaviour. Remember, it

is only for possession; the

prosecutor wanted life sentence

for smuggling...

(a smile)

To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a

great victory!

CUT:

FATHER

(embarrassed)

...With good time Billy it works

out to about 3 years... then there's

the appeal.  Yesil, Davis, they're

all working for you We're going to

try to make a deal to get you

transferred to a Stateside prison.

And Davis thinks there might be a

political amnesty any month...

FATHER

Look - I know it sounds tough,

Billy, but we're gonna get you

out...

FATHER

...I promise you, but I don't want

you to get stupid again. Pull

anything.  They can play with your

sentence.

FATTIER

(his voice starting

to crack)

I'm putting $500 in the bank for

you.  Anything you need you write...

FATHER

There's food, candy, writing paper,

soap, books...

(his eyes start to

water)

...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush,

there's... Jesus!

(cracks, throws

down the cigarette

carton)

I been writing insurance policies

on people for thirty goddamn

years...

(laughs and cries

at the same time)

And now I gotta see my own

son...Jesus! Jesus!  If I could be

where you are Billy, I'd be there...

Goddamn Jesus!  These bastards.

BILLY

DAD!

FATHER

Oh Jesus!

(sobbing)

FATHER

You take good care of my boy, you

hear, or I'll have your fucking

head, you Turkish bastard!

CUT:

BILLY'S VOICE

Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed

into 1971.  You can drift in here

and never know you're gone. You

can fade so far out and you don't

know where you are anymore or where

anything else is...

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

I find loneliness is a physical

pain which hurts all over; you

can't isolate it in one part of

your body. I so much need your

softness, your strength. I have

your letters. They charge me, give

me courage.News about amnesty and

getting out - tangled,

complicated...

VOICE

...I feel myself drifting more

heavily into smoking hashish. The

haze helps the time pass. Also I

do soap carvings.  Erich taught

me. And I have been learning Turkish

because it helps me to deal with

the guards and the prisoners. I'm

trying hard to maintain some sort

of schedule to my life, but

sometimes it seems like I'm just

trying in order to try...

CUT:

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

... In the daytimes we sometimes

play volleyball against the big

Turkish gangsters...

CUT:

CUT:

BILLY'S VOICE

...To the Turks all foreigners are

"ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't

shave our under-arms or around our

crotch...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

Even the yoga I sometimes do is

"ayip" - too suggestive...

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

And you're never supposed to eat

with your left hand. You know why?

Because that's what they use to

wipe their asses with instead of

toilet paper.  And yet they hate

pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey.

They're considered dirty...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

So is homosexuality. That's a big

crime here but most of them do it

every chance they get.  There are

about a thousand things that are

"ayip".  But they're really so

hypocritical, like children breaking

the rules. For instance...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

...You can stab or shoot some body

the but not above the waist because

that's intent to kill. So everybody

runs around stabbing everyone else

in the ass.  That's what they call

'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a

lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite

Turkish word for bribery...

HAMIDOU

Unfortunately my youngest son Arief

is having problems with his teeth;

he needs braces, but dentists are

so expensive these days

ASLAN

(patting Arief on

the head)

Poor kid... You know I have a

friend, a very good friend; he's a

dentist; maybe he could get you

some braces at a... reasonable

price.

HAMIDOU

(protesting with

his hands, shaking

his head))

Oh, no...it's out of the

question...wouldn't want to ask

your friend...

ASLAN

Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

Hamidou hints that he needs new

braces for one of his sons.  Aslan

of course has a friend who's a

dentist.  They bullshit for half

an hour and Hamidou finally accepts

the "Baksheesh" in return...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

Dope and all kinds of shipments

get delivered to Aslan, who re-

sells it through his runners. People

like Ziat.  But one night, it

backfired...

CUT:

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

There were thousands of yellow

nembutols.  Aslan as usual had the

privilege of going into the

courtyard before anybody else to

pick up his stuff but...

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

...it happened to be a new guard

that day and he didn't understand

the system.

GUARD

No. It's too early.

ASLAN

Open the fucking Gate, you asshole!

Do you know who I am? You want to

get in trouble!

GUARD

(angry)

Hey, I your mother! Get back to

your bunk.

CUT:

PRISON DIRECTOR

Aslan...be reasonable. Come down

and talk.

ASLAN (OFF)

(from second story)

You come up here and talk!

PRISON DIRECTOR

(not moving)

Aslan... if you give up the gun,

you can keep the bullets

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

A week later Aslan had a new gun...

BILLY'S VOICE

...I know all this must sound crazy

to you, but this place is crazy...

CUT:

BILLY

(continuous)

Everything is "sula-bula" which

means "like this, like that" - you

never know what will happen. One

day one of the new kids was raped

in the children's kogus, so they

picked out six of the worst kids...

CUT:

HAMIDOU

PIS!  PIS"

("Obscene, filthy")

HAMIDOU

You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens

when you're not a good boy.

BILLY VOICE

(continuos)

Then there's Ziat.  The more I

know of him...

You're ayip!

ZIAT

(glares at him,

then lets it go)

Look, you don't fuck with me, I

don't fuck with you, right?

BILLY

But you fuck with me. You fuck

with me all the time. You make

crummy tea.  You rip us off on the

hash.

ZIAT

(amused)

I make special tea for you, Hiyes,

okay?  We've to live like brothers.

We have to be in here together.

BILLY

(tired of it)

Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money

you have, you have nothing!

ZIAT

You 'Merican.  You don't know.

BILLY

Know what?

ZIAT

Was..

(makes gesture with

his fingers)

...seven years old. I was on street

in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to

take care. I learn.

BILLY

Learn what?

ZIAT

Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other

And you must fuck last.

BILLY

That's a great philosophy.

YESIL

(smiling)

The new American Ambassador here

is following your case very closely.

He says there is progress. But

there is another route that is

quite possible...

(lowers his voice

and leans close)

...For the proper amount of money

it is possible I can convince

certain officials to lose track of

your papers before the High Court

in Ankara confirms the sentence of

the Lower Court in Istanbul... You

would not exist; and you could be

in Greece by the time the Turkish

courts discovered a stupid clerical

mistake...But I have to act before

the official sentence is handed

down, and for that I must pay

certain officials in advance...

SUSAN'S VOICE

...My dearest Billy. I know it is

long and it is hard for you, but

your family and I are thinking

about you all the time. I am trying

hard to make enough money nights

to come and see you.  Your father

says that lawyer Yesil wants another

$2000.  I know you distrust him

more and more, but your father

wants to do everything he can, and

he is borrowing all he can on the

mortgage of the house.  Money seems

to be the only way out of there.

Except of course the other way...

SUSAN'S VOICE

(continuous)

...But I cannot say I am for it.

Nor are your parents. They consulted

the priest, and he said to send

you money for that reason would be

like sealing your death.

BELL

(excited)

The blueprints!

MAX

To what?

BELL

The prison, man. There was this

German cat an architect in the

hospital. He was helping the Turks

build some shit round the place.

I laid some bread on him and he

let me copy them.

MAX

Too bad you didn't have a machine.

BELL

(intent)

There's two ways out I figger -

over the roof, but that's only one

person, maybe two. The other way

is Under.

BILLY

Tunnel?

BELL

(grins)

It's already built!  There's a

basement substructure where they

used to keep weapons and stuff,

but beneath that there's these old

catacombs that the Christians built

'bout a thousand fucking years ago

to bury their dead.  We're sitting

right on top of it -- here.

BELL (OVER)

The Kraut said there's a whole

bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort

of like dumbwaiters running along

this wall; one of them is right in

there, right next to our shower.

We get in there, he says, we can

get down into the catacombs. With

three of us working....

(stops)

MAX

Gotta be here someplace.  Thought

I heard a couple of dead Christians

singing down there.

BELL

(irritated)

Stop shitting me, man!

BILLY

(trying to be serious)

But how would you get into the

shaft, Jimmy?

MAX

I suppose you knock three times

and ask for St. Peter.

BELL

(turning on Max)

Hey!  I'm getting this together

man and I don't need no fucking

Gastro-head along on this trip!

(a fierce look at

Max then back to

Billy)

We go through the wall.

BILLY

(a resigned look on

his face)

We go through the wall?

MAX

(quite sure Bell is

out of his skull)

We go through the wall.

BELL

...The Kraut was right!  I checked

it out - there's no reinforced

steel in those bath walls. They're

real soft from underground seepage--

BELL

(gesturing profusely)

--the water like "'weeps" through

the cement, see. Twenty, thirty

years, you can almost push it over.

All we do is use Gastrohead's

screwdriver here and scrape the

mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones,

squeeze through, put 'em back, and

get our ass down the shaft, It's a

two night operation, maybe three.

MAX

And what do you do when you in the

catacombs?

BELL

The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a

door?  There's miles of em like a

sewer system but they got to come

up someplace in Istanbul.

MAX

You gotta be fucking crazy!  You

got stabbed in the ass once too

much, sweetheart, cause you're

gonna end up in Section 13, that's

what - not the 'catacombs.

BILLY

Section 13?

MAX

(looking at Bell)

Yeah,  for the criminally insane.

(looks at Billy)

I was there once for two weeks and

it ain't an illusion. It's awful.

Namidou runs it like a death camp,

that's where he spends most of his

time...

BILLY

Where is it?

MAX

I don' t know. It's someplace down

in there....

(points at the ground)

..deep.. A big door...a wheel....

BELL

(low-keyed)

Hey, you know what's gonna get us

out of here?  It's not a map, Max.

It's our balls. You know what I

mean...

(straight at Max,

Billy, very sincere,

his eyes almost

watering)

...I gotta get laid man, I don't

know 'bout you guys, but if I don't

get it on soon, I'm... I'm not

gonna make it.

MAX

(under his breath)

Shit.

BELL

Billy?

BILLY

...The roof sounds better to me

than digging through a wall.  Ziat's

round there all the time. But the

roof....

(looks up)

BILLY

The bullet percentage is awful

high.

BILLY

If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing

another months. I'd be back up to

3 years, maybe more...

BELL

Well fuck it!  Choose your own

death, babe, I'm taking the roof

out of here!

BILLY'S VOICE

Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught

and beaten so badly he got a severe

hernia and lost a testicle. He's

been in the hospital for months

having operations..

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

...In comparison my problems seem

very small. But two and a half

years have now gone by, and in

their own fashion, the Turks are

slowly draining my life away...

BILLY'S VOICE

...I have problems with my stomach

and my leg muscles feel very weak.

My gums seem to be shrinking and

they sometimes bleed when I massage

them... They've pulled five of my

teeth...

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

...sometimes they null the wrong

one...

CUT:

BILLY VOICE

(continuos)

...even my dreams don't seem to

work any more. Because the outside

doesn't seem real any more. It's

not even a fantasy...because there

is no fantasy.

BILLY'S VOICE

(continuous)

Even masturbation has become boring.

It teaches you, like the rest of

prison life, to seal up your

emotions, and this is the greatest

danger, this is what makes so many

of the men change into something

monstrous...

CUT:

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

It is Erich who has taught me how

it is to be conscious, to channel

and direct my energy.  He has

convinced me to stop smoking

hashish, he is the calmest man I

have ever known.  If you don't

control your energy in here if can

blow you apart like with Bell. And

you can't waste it either.  You

have to weigh up every one of your

actions - for and against.  Too

little sex, too much sex either

will throw you off balance...

BILLY VOICE

(continuously)

...he has taught me about feelings,

and the need to express them.  And

he has taught me about love...

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)

...and what love really is, beyond

its physical forms.. .I think up

to now I have only considered my

own self, never really another...

CUT:

BILLY VOICE

...and now strange as it seems,

Susan, without having seen you in

so long I feel myself more inside

of you than ever before. I feel

your female mind.  I sense you,

touch you; ...know you; and find

myself falling more and more...

in love with you.

Dear Susan. Erich has been

transferred to a prison back in

Sweden. He has profoundly affected

my life and though I am lonely

without him I am calmer than ever...

Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm

afraid I have some bad news for

you.

BILLY

Something happen to Dad?... Mom?

DAVIS

No... It looks like your going to

have a new court.

BILLY

What do you mean?

DAVIS

The Prosecutor objected to your

sentence for possession; he wanted

a smuggling conviction and the

High Court in Ankara reviewed it.

BILLY

And?

DAVIS

We've been notified that they

rejected the sentence...

DAVIS

(continuing)

There were 35 judges on the High

Court. Twenty eight of them voted

for a life sentence.

DAVIS (OFF)

The Lower Court in Istanbul will

have to go along with the decision.

The Judge likes you and he'll do

the only thing he can do under the

law.... . He'll reduce the sentence

to thirty years... We're notified...

Billy.

BILLY

What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!

FOR WHAT!

DAVIS

Billy!  Please!

BILLY

FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT!

BILLY

I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!

BILLY

I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!

CUT:

BILLY

...What is the crime?  And what is

the punishment?  The answer seems

to vary from place to place, and

from time to time. What's legal

today is suddenly illegal tomorrow

cause some society says it's so;

and what's illegal yesterday all

of a sudden gets legal today because

everybody's doing it and you can't

throw everybody in jail. Well I'm

not saying this is right or wrong.

It's just the way things are....

BILLY

(continuous)

But I spent the last three and a

half years of my life in your prison

and I think I paid for my error

and if it's your decision today to

sentence me to more years, I...

I...

(a break)

You know my lawyers told me 'be

cool

Billy don't get upset, don't get

angry, if you're good I can maybe

get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal,

this that and the other thing.'

Well that's been going down now

for 35 years...

BILLY

(continuous)

And I've been playing it cool and

I've been good and now I'm damn

tired of being good cause you people

gave me the belief that I had 53

days left.  You hung 53 days in

front of my eyes and then you took

those 53 days away, and Mister

Prosecutor!  I just wish you

could...

BILLY (OVER)

... stand right here where I'm

standing and feel what that...

...feels like, cause then you'd

know something you don't know you'd

know what means, Mister Prosecutor

and you'd know the concept of a

society is based on the quality of

its mercy means, of its sense of

fair play, its sense of justice...

but

(shrugs and scoffs

at himself)

I guess that's just like asking a

bear to shit in a toilet...

BILLY

(same self-mocking

tone)

For a nation of pigs, it's funny

you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give

me the sentence. Jesus forgave the

bastards, but I can't. I hate you.

Nation. I hate your I hate your

people. And I fuck your sons and

AHMET

Good morning, my American friend!

There will be trouble if you go

this way. A good Turk always walks

to the right. Left is communist.

Right is good. You must go the

other way... It's Good.

AHMET

Why you go?  Why don't you walk

the wheel with us?

(suspiciously leaning

forward, suddenly

realizing the answer)

The bad machine doesn't know he's

a bad machine. You still don't

believe it? You still don't believe

you're a bad machine?

AHMET

(shakes his head)

To know oneself is to know God, my

friend. The factory knows.  That's

why they put you here. You'll see.

You'll find out. Later on you'll

know.

BILLY

I already know. I know that you're

a bad machine.  That's why the

factory keeps you here.

(Lowers s voice)

You know how I know?  I know because

I'm from the factory. I make the

machines.. I'm here to spy on you.
