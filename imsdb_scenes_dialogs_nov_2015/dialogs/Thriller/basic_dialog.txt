FIRST DRAFT

MARCH 27, 2000

STYLES (O.S.)

Jesus, God. . .

PILOT

Hurricane Beth, huh? Had    an ex-wife

named Beth, this is pretty   much par

for the course. This area    got the

worst of it, I hope these   guys are

all intact-

STYLES

That's enough, Lieutenant.

PILOT

Coming up on the pick-up.

2.

PILOT

Holy shit, that's live fire!

STYLES

Who's shooting at them-

PILOT

I can't see-

STYLES

That was one of their own, he just

Shot one of their own men-

PILOT

Who was trying to shoot them-

STYLES

Get us on the ground!

BIGGER MAN

Are you ready for this?

3.

HARDY

Tell the truth, Vic. You made these

with a blender, right?

BARTENDER

Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't

make no damn difference to me.

HARDY

You know that was like a quadruple

negative?

HARDY

Can I at least have a drink?

BARTENDER

It's ten thirty in the morning.

HARDY

Yeah, if you've slept.

BARTENDER

You know the law - no liquor before

noon. Could lose my license.

HARDY

Don't you mean "don't need no liquor

license not taken away from me"?

BARTENDER

Hurricane kept you up, too?

HARDY

Yeah, and I could've used the sleep.

I'm supposed to meet people here

tonight, try and get some work going.

NEWSCASTER

...is expected to announce the grand

jury indictments in the Guissepe

Torres police corruption case as

early as tomorrow afternoon.

Speculations abound that up to ten

former homicide detectives could be

named in the proceedings-

4.

BARTENDER

Sorry.

HARDY

Bill Styles...

BARTENDER

Who?

HARDY

Old friend. Haven't talked to him

in- 911. Can I use your phone?

HARDY

Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no.

. . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah...

yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.

BARTENDER

What was that?

HARDY

I gotta go out to McKinley.

5.

OSBORNE

This is totally unnecessary-

STYLES

He asked to see a policeman, we're

getting him a policeman .

OSBORNE

But this guy you called, he's not

even Army-

STYLES

He's former Army and the best I've

ever seen in a room. Besides, he

knows the territory, we did Basic

together here.

(off her look)

You've had three hours with Dunbar

and haven't gotten a peep, we need

to take a different tack.

OSBORNE

He's not Army, it's not official-

STYLES

Then it's unofficial.

OSBORNE

(re: his appearance)

Doesn't get any unofficialer than

that...

HARDY

How are you?

STYLES

Been better.

(pause)

I read about what's been happening

With you... I should have called-

HARDY

What kind of trouble are you in?

HARDY

That bad?

STYLES

Would I have called you if it wasn't?

If there was any other way-

6.

HARDY

Tell me what I can do.

OSBORNE

You can get us some answers.

STYLES

This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,

The closest thing we have to an in-

House investigator.

HARDY

And here you are going out of house.

How's that make you feel, Jules?

OSBORNE

Hostile and uncooperative.

HARDY

Fantastic.   You want to tell me what's

going on?

STYLES

The official term for it is

"Clusterfuck" . By the time Beth hit

us, I'd canceled all off base

exercises save one - a six man cadet

team and their Drill out in the bush.

We're missing three and the Sergeant.

The cadets are in their eighth week

of the cycle, nobody here knows much

about them, up to and including their

names. But the Sergeant...

HARDY

It's not West, is it?    Tell me it's

not West.

HARDY

Ah, Christ

OSBORNE

You knew Sergeant West?

HARDY

He was our Drill here.    Man's older

than sand.

7.

STYLES

A few years ago, the Army picked our

good buddy as their go to non-com to

trot out to the press to talk about

the kinder, gentler military. He

even did the standard video greeting

played to all incoming Basic cadets

across the country.

HARDY

Well, he's a good soldier.

HARDY

I didn't mean that as a compliment.

OSBORNE

Sergeant West's served for twenty-

Three years. He's the public face

of the modern Army.

HARDY

And you notice I'm not in the Army

anymore.

STYLES

The exercise was one of his Section

Eight "private sessions". Left around

2100 yesterday and were scheduled

for pick up at 0630 this morning.

HARDY

And the problem is you only got three.

STYLES

No, the problem is one's dead, one's

got a bullet in his arm, and one

won't talk. The one who won't talk

was trading live fire with the dead

one as we reached the pick-up.

HARDY

I'm assuming that's what made him

the dead one?

STYLES

Cadet Roberto R. Nunez.   Killed right

in front of me.

OSBORNE

Search parties for the others are

fanning out in a ten click radius

from the pickup. If they're hurt

and we can get to them in time...

8.

STYLES

I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets

we retrieved are to be flown to D.C.

On a transport leaving here at 1700-

HARDY

Which gives us about five hours.

Why'd you call me?

STYLES

The guy in interrogation said he'd

only talk to a cop.

HARDY

And I'm the closest thing to it,

right?

STYLES

Tom, bottom line: I let those kids

go out there. If JAG shows up and I

don't have any answers for them, my

career is finished-

HARDY

I'm not gonna let that happen.

STYLES

Thank you. Osborne will brief you

on the cadets. And Tom?

(half-smile)

It really is good to see you.

HARDY

Gotta be honest, I love what you've

Done with the place-

OSBORNE

You and the Colonel go back.

HARDY

He got me through Basic and a lot of

other stuff. I owe him.

OSBORNE

You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading

about in the papers, right? New

Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes

from Guissepe Torres.

9.

HARDY

It was for suspicion of bribery,

it's really all in the wording-

OSBORNE

Wording and your friendship with the

Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable

having you involved in this.

HARDY

Subtlety really isn't one of you

finer points, is it, Osborne?

HARDY

Three things. First - You don't

have a choice. Second- I've never

taken a bribe in my life. And Third -

I'm still a little drunk from last

night, so if I skip over the witty

banter and move forward to straight

hitting on you, try not to take

offense. Tell me about the two guys.

OSBORNE

Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe,

so all we have are their dogtags.

Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-

HARDY

Levi?   Who names their kid Levi-

OSB0RNE

Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.

HARDY

Christ... Remind me to thank Bill

for mentioning that on the phone-

OSBORNE

Kendall Junior is still  in surgery,

so he won't be available  to answer

for his name or anything  else for

another hour - the cadet  we're talking

to first is Dunbar.

HARDY

He's in interrogation?

OSBORNE

Yes.

HARDY

Move him.

10.

OSBORNE

Why?

HARDY

Because interrogation rooms look

suspiciously like interrogation rooms,

which doesn't exactly put people at

ease. Is he cute?

OSBORNE

Excuse me?

HARDY

Is Dunbar cute?

OSBORNE

(pissed)

That is the most unprofessional-

HARDY

Is he handsome, self assured, carry

himself well, does he look you in

the eyes or down at the floor, does

he have good bones, suggesting good

breeding, does he slouch or sit up

straight - these are important

questions, as they reveal a great

deal about this man's character so

please get over yourself for two and

a half seconds and tell me is he

cute?

HARDY

Thank you. At some point in there

I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do,

go at him with everything you got.

OSBORNE

Good cop/bad cop?

HARDY

Something like that.

HARDY

Oh, and Osborne? You have any donuts

around here?

11.

OSBORNE

I questioned him for three hours and

he didn't make a sound. You don't

have a badge, he won't talk to you.

HARDY,

Ten bucks says I have him talking in

under three minutes.

OSBORNE

Go.

HARDY

Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom

Hardy and I believe you've already

met Officer Osborne. I understand

you had a rough time of it last night?

HARDY

Not talking, huh? You probably just

want to get some food and some sleep.

They feed you yet?

HARDY

Go on. You can eat in front of

someone and still not talk to them -

my parents did it for years.

HARDY

Want another one?

12.

HARDY

Maybe later. Ray, let me say this

up front - I'm not a cop.

HARDY

I used to be, but that's beside the

point. Who I am doesn't really

matter; what matters is that right

now, you're in a shitload of trouble.

You understand that, right?

HARDY

Now, I don't know if you did what

you did in self defense and frankly

I don't really care. I'm just doing

a favor for Colonel Styles because

he wants to know if anyone else who's

still out there is in need of

assistance. To be honest with you,

though, I don't care about that

either.

HARDY

I don't know those guys, you do.

They die, to me, it's like seeing a

couple people died in a fire on the

news - tragic, but it doesn't affect

me. The only thing I care about is

I agreed to do a favor for a friend

and try and talk to you till your

transpo shows up. You like baseball?

HARDY

I could talk baseball for   days.

Batting averages, ERA's, I   got

statistics in my brain, I   don't know

how I remember them. It's    freaky.

You wanna talk baseball?

HARDY

Come on Ray, we're gonna be here

five hours, we gotta talk about

something. So who do you like?

13.

DUNBAR

I don't like baseball.

HARDY

Why not?

DUNBAR

I asked for a policeman.

HARDY

You're under military arrest, it's

not gonna happen. What's wrong with

baseball?

DUNBAR

It's... too slow.

HARDY

Well, it's a game of anticipation,

that's the beauty.

DUNBAR

I just don't like it.

HARDY

What do you like then?

DUNBAR (O.S.)

I don't know... I like the Army.

HARDY (O.S.)

C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army

during Basic. I'll tell you straight,

I hated it here.

DUNBAR

You did Basic here?

HARDY

Fifteen years ago under Sergeant

West. Piece of work, that guy. I

remember, he used to have these two

silver .45's with ivory handles and

if you weren't quick enough, he'd

(MORE)

14.

HARDY (CONT'D)

knock you on the head with one of

them. He still carry those guns?

HARDY

I was also his " knife dummy" .

(to Osborne)

See, West used to say he could slit

a man from stem to sternum in three

seconds. He'd use this length of

pipe to demonstrate and if you were

the knife dummy, you'd spend all day

getting a pipe rammed into your balls

if you weren't fast enough to defend

yourself. That was a loooong day.

HARDY

Incidentally, Ray, I promised them

I'd ask where West and the others

are. Can we get to them?

DUNBAR

There's no need...

HARDY

They're dead, aren't they?

DUNBAR

Yeah.

HARDY

You kill them?

OSBORNE

The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez,

You're a murderer-

HARDY

See, Ray, this is what we call "good

cop, bad cop".

(MORE)

15.

HARDY

She shouts, I stand up for you, you're

grateful, a bond of trust is

established.

HARDY

But I don't want to play games.

That's why you're not in an

interrogation room, with one of those

two way mirrors - everyone knows

those things are two way, right?

HARDY

Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you

another donut and you think about

whether you want to talk more, okay?

DUNBAR

Okay.

OSBORNE

Baseball?

HARDY

Believe somebody owes me ten dollars-

OSBORNE

You made me look like an idiot-

HARDY

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the

object of the interrogation is to

make you look good- Everyone knows

good cop, bad cop - by admitting it

I appeared trustworthy.

STYLES

You think he did it?

OSBORNE

No-

HARDY

Yes-

16.

STYLES

You've got four hours and forty-five

minutes to find out.

HARDY

Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

DUNBAR

I'm not telling you what happened.

HARDY

Okay... but I would like to know

about the other cadets. What they

were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes

a deep breath.

DUNBAR

Some.

HARDY

Tell me about them.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge

hated him from the beginning.

WEST

You motherfuckers have just made the

worst mistake of your lives! You

have chosen to join my Army! This

Army is my mother, my father, and my

little virgin sister and I will not

allow anyone or anything that is not

up to my standards near her pretty

little virgin cooze, do you understand

me - give me a sir, yes, sir!

THE CADETS

Sir, yes, sir!

17.

WEST

Those who I deem unworthy to pass

through this camp will quit, and

those who refuse to quit I will kill.

You ever hear of a training accident -

Give me a sir, yes, sir!

THE CADETS

Sir, yes, sir!

WEST

In my time I have killed sixteen men

for the good of my country, sixteen

men whose entrance into this Army I

could not condone, as it would weaken

the fabric of this nation's defense!

This base suffers an average of three

training accidents a year, unfortunate

incidents that I will not hesitate

to repeat if you cross me, understand -

Give me a sir, yes, sir!

THE CADETS

Sir, yes, sir!

WEST

So forget what you've seen on Sixty

fucking Minutes about the kinder,

gentler military - you will either

succeed, quit, or die by my hand!

WEST

My power here is absolute, isn't

that right, nigger?

PIKE

Sir, yes, sir!

WEST

I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where

we string greasy coon necks up from

tree branches when the mood strikes

us you have a problem with that?

PIKE

Sir, no, sir!

18.

WEST

What the fuck is this? You lay a

hand on me while I'm trying to do my

duty and rid the world of you?

WEST

Get the fuck up, you're still in

formation, get the fuck up!

WEST

What the fuck have you done to that

uniform, take it off, take it off,

take it off!

WEST

Get those fucking pants off, I want

you buck ass naked, you don't deserve

to wear these beautiful United States

Army issue clothes!

WEST

Cadet, what's your name!

DUNBAR

Sir, Dunbar, sir!

WEST

You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?

DUNBAR

Sir, yes, sir!

WEST

Dunbar you are to stand here and

guard this nigger for the next twenty-

four hours! He is not to be given

food, water, or clothes! If he so

much as moves, you are to blow his

nigger brains out, is that clear?

DUNBAR

Sir, yes, sir!

19.

WEST

The rest of you, fallout for

physicals!

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not

Pike.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Time went on and the Sarge started

singling people out.

DUNBAR

He'd zero in on a fella and ride him

till he quit.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in

what he called Section Eight.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Washout rejects, guys he said were ,

"dumbfucks too stupid to know they

were dead". He separated us from

the rest. We slept alone...

20.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

. . .ate alone.. .

DUNBAR ( V. O . )

...and trained long after the other

guys got to turn in.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Fellas lived in daily fear of being

Sectioned and with good reason, too.

DUNBAR

They figured we were the boys who'd

meet with a "training accident" .

OSBORNE

Are you saying Sergeant West tried

to kill you?

DUNBAR

No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit.

Making it through was kind of an

honor. Some of the other guys on

the base told us that if you could

hack Section Eight, Command would

consider you at the top of the class.

HARDY

That's not exactly true...

(off their looks)

I'm living proof. How did you get

Sectioned, Ray?

21.

DUNBAR

That first night with Pike. I made

the mistake of letting him sit down

at around 0300.

OSBORNE

Tell us about the other guys, the

ones West weeded out.

DUNBAR

There were six of us...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good

ol' boy type. One of those "his

Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull

Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was

gonna take away his scatter gun" .

He idolized West.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big

fella from New Mexico. After he got

Sectioned he just followed Mueller

around like a lap dog. He wasn't

mean like Mueller, though, didn't

have it in him.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

But Childs did. Didn't talk to

anyone, but you got this feeling

something was wrong with him, like

real wrong. Type of guy you felt

uncomfortable going to sleep near.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Pike I told you about. He took the

brunt of it from Mueller and West.

Once they found it out he was a

convict they were merciless.

(MORE)

22.

DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He'd been busted for Auto Theft,

judge gave him the option of jailor

the Army. He made the wrong choice.

DUNBAR

Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was

a smart guy, we got along okay.

Pike and I tried to help him, but...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

He was sickly. Had that shaking

thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?

OSBORNE (V.O.)

Epilepsy.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Yeah. Spent half his time in the

infirmary. Only reason he enlisted

was his father. West didn't section

him till last week.

HARDY

And those were the guys who went on

the exercise with you?

DUN BAR

Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying.

HARDY

You smoke, Ray?

DUNBAR

This is one of those interrogation

tricks, isn't it? You don't give me

a cigarette till I tell you more.

HARDY

No, actually, I just left mine in

the car and was hoping you had some.

HARDY

My brand.   Must be my lucky day.

23.

HARDY

Let me ask you one thing. You seem

like a good guy, Ray. You carried

Kendall wounded to the pickup. So

what I don't get is what you did to

make Nunez want to kill you?

M. P.

Sirs?

HARDY

He's not done by a longshot, I can

get more out of him-

STYLES

He can wait.     Kendall's out of

surgery.

HARDY

Why'd you join the army?

OSBORNE

You really want to make banal chit-

Chat like that now?

HARDY

You're right. We should sit in

silence.

OSBORNE

We're in the middle of a murder case-

HARDY

Best time for banal chit-chat.

OSBORNE

What is that?

24.

HARDY

Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't

have- time to wire his room. Now

tell me why you joined the army or

I'll jab this pen through your neck.

OSBORNE

Typical army brat story. Dad was

noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was

never any real doubt of joining up.

HARDY

You had a mobile of bayonets above

your crib.

OSBORNE

Something like that.     You?

HARDY

I lost a bet.

OSBORNE

You're kidding.

HARDY

Yeah. That's just the story I tell

the girls to get them into bed.

Truth is... I don't know. The whole

honor and duty thing. Make a

difference in the world, crap like

that. Didn't really work out.

OSBORNE

I bet    that's the second story you

tell    the girls to get them into bed,

after    you make them laugh with the

first    one.

OSBORNE

This is the straight hitting on me

you were talking about, isn't it?

HARDY

The very same.

OSBORNE

You do understand that there's

absolutely no way I could ever be

attracted to you, right?

25.

HARDY

I plan to grow on you.

OSBORNE

You're off to a late start.

HARDY

So noted.

HARDY

You guys really got the shit kicked

out of you here.

OSBORNE

Imagine what it must have been like

for them out there. What do you

think of Dunbar?

HARDY

He's telling the truth, up to a point.

OSBORNE

What point?

OSBORNE

Something wrong?

HARDY

Being back here. Gives me the

willies.

OSBORNE

Not the happiest of memories?

HARDY

No.

NURSE

Normally we wouldn't let anyone see

him this soon, but Colonel Styles

said it was urgent-

26.

HARDY

It is.

OSBORNE

Remember, he's the son of a Senator,

so go easy. Kid gloves.

HARDY

Got it.

KENDALL

You... I've seen you around the Base.

But you...

(POINTING TO HARDY)

You're not Army, are you?

HARDY

Coast Guard, special detective detail.

We feel this incident may have put

the beaches of Florida at risk.

KENDALL

That's it. You're that policeman

with friends in low places. Tell

me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these

days? Those racketeering indictments

must have really been a downer-

HARDY

Levi, you got about four hours before

armed men show up here, put you on a

plane to Washington, and lock you in

a very small dark room.  I suggest

you talk to us.

KENDALL

I've done nothing wrong.

(gestures to his wound)

I'm the victim here.

HARDY

But not the only victim, right?

KENDALL

My, my, my, how did things turn so

hostile so quickly? If I didn't

know better, I'd say you two were

out to get me.

27.

OSBORNE

We just want-

KENDALL

What, "The Truth"? Please. There

are degrees of truth, officer, always

degrees. Things are not what they

seem.

HARDY

It's too early in the day for me to

give a shit about some pissant cadet's

bad version of "intrigue". You want

to talk to us, send word over to the

brig. Let's go.

HARDY

You're working too hard, Levi. I

can tell cause you're sweating. And

you're sweating cause you have no

idea what Dunbar's already told us.

OSBORNE

That was kid gloves?

HARDY

Have no fear, Osborne, we have not

yet begun to fight.

OSBORNE

But we have to question him-

(noticing)

Thought you didn't have cigarettes-

HARDY

I lied.   Wait for it...

NURSE

Cadet Kendall-

HARDY

We're on our way.

28.

HARDY

Sergeant West is dead isn't he?

HARDY

And the other three Cadets?

HARDY

Feel free to elaborate .

KENDALL

My father is a powerful man. Over

the years he's used that power to

protect me, in one form or another,

from certain... unpleasantries.

(deep breath)

I am a homosexual.

HARDY

Senator Daddy must be thrilled.

KENDALL

He is not, shall we say, wild about

the idea. He has asked me on numerous

occasions to be more discreet about

my proclivities, and I have done my

best to oblige him. However, in the

last four weeks, I began a

relationship with another cadet.

What do you think of that?

HARDY

I think you just blew "Don't Ask,

Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.

KENDALL

The Sergeant discovered this

relationship and wanted me expelled.

My father interceded, so instead,

West Sectioned me and made sure every

other cadet knew that I was gay.

OSBORNE

He couldn't kick you out so he wanted

you to quit on your own.

KENDALL

He wanted more than that.

29.

HARDY

More intrigue, Levi?

KENDALL

Yes.

KENDALL (V.O.)

It was the regular Tuesday night

drill. He'd let us sleep for an

hour and then wake us up, drag us

out to the bayou, and work us all

night, separate from the others.

The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West.

WEST

Get up, get up, get up! We're going

on a little night hike, boys - muster

in five on the south tarmac!

PIKE

Hurricane's due after midnight and

we're still going out?

MUELLER

Toughens us up, Pike.    You don't

like it, quit.

KENDALL

Maybe we shouldn't go.

MUELLER

The faggot speaks.

KENDALL

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

MUELLER

(mocking gay lisp)

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

NUNEZ

You really heard this?

30.

PIKE

You know Popham, works in the kitchen?

He told me it was on the radio.

KENDALL

We should tell him we're not going.

MUELLER

Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir,

we don't feel like going out - we

don't want to get rained on." He'll

kick our asses from here to Cleveland.

DUNBAR

He's right.    We don't have a choice.

WEST

A rifle, a pistol, and three

phosphorous grenades to a man! This

is live fire, so keep those safetied

until we touch down; I don't want

anyone shooting their dick off!

WEST

Some of you may have heard there's a

hurricane coming! American soldiers

do not wait for good weather - they

do not wait for a bright sunshiney

day to do their duty! An American

Soldier learns to operate in the

worst conditions and turn said

conditions into an advantage against

their enemy! Anyone who thinks these

conditions are too harsh, feel free

to lay down and die, you get me?

THE CADETS

Sir, yes, sir!

WEST

LZ is two clicks North of a cabin,

you are to split into teams of two

(MORE)

31.

WEST (CONT'D)

and work your way through your

designated area blasting as many

targets as you can find! Each area

has twenty targets, first team to

take all twenty and find the cabin

wins! Teams are as follows - Dunbar

and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall

and Childs!

WEST

I will be in the areas monitoring

your progress and if I see anyone

drag ass I will personally slit you

stem to sternum and leave you for

dead! Fall out!

WEST

You're gonna die tonight, faggot.

OSBORNE

He said what?

KENDALL

"You're gonna die tonight, faggot" .

Clear as day.

OSBORNE

No one else heard it?

KENDALL

He whispered it in my ear.

HARDY

Levi, I don't know   if you're familiar

with investigative   work, but we have

this little thing   called "motive"

and you just gave   yourself one.

KENDALL

You said you wanted to know what

happened- I'm telling you the truth.

HARDY

What happened to "degrees"?

32.

KENDALL

Didn't kill him-

HARDY

Then who did?

KENDALL (V.O.)

I wanted to tell someone what he'd

said, but I couldn't. Mueller would

just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't

care. Pike and Dunbar were okay,

but... When West outed me, he isolated

me. An outcast among outcasts. And

I'd just been told tonight was the

night I'd die.

WEST

First team, second team, third team,

go, go, go!

KENDALL (V.O.)

I knew Childs a little, we worked at

the PX together.

KENDALL (V.O.)

I started getting it in my head that

maybe West had paid him, maybe he

was the one who was supposed to give

me a training accident-

33.

CHILDS

Don't you ever point a gun at me!

KENDALL

I'm- I'm sorry. . .

CHILDS

Come on, let's move.

KENDALL (V.O.)

All I could think of was West, out

there somewhere in the dark. Maybe

watching the others, maybe watching

me. And waiting to make his move.

CHILDS

Christ, am I alone in this world?

Shoot something-

CHILDS

A target, Kendall, cap a fucking

target. What's wrong with you?

KENDALL (V.O.)

I thought I was gonna have an attack.

Go into a fit and bite off my own

tongue in the middle of the bayou.

Childs could tell I wasn't right.

CHILDS

Just safety your shit and get behind

me, okay? I'll take care of this.

KENDALL (V.O.)

Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this

was when they'd get me, when I felt

safest.

34.

KENDALL (V.O.)

But if I struck first and took out

Childs, then maybe I could make it

out alive...

KENDALL

Maybe I shouldn't tell you that.

Maybe I should tell you I wasn't

scared at all. But I was...

(long pause)

Enough to almost kill him.

HARDY

But you didn't.

KENDALL

No.    Poetic justice, though.

OSBORNE

Why?

HARDY

Because Childs is the one who shot

you.

KENDALL

But that came later.

CHILDS

Over there!

CHILDS

Hello!    HEL-

35.

CHILDS

GET DOWN!

CHILDS

Fuck, what the fuck is going on-

KENDALL

What do we do?

CHILDS

Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...

KENDALL

Don't want to go-

CHILDS

Fine.

KENDALL

What's-

KENDALL

Oh, Jesus.. .

KENDALL

Did- Did you-

CHILDS

It was the grenade you fucking idiot.

Look at him!

36.

CHILDS

This isn't our area.   Whose area is

This-

MUELLER

Can anybody hear me!

MUELLER

Hey, I-

(seeing it)

Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the

fuck did you guys do?

CHILDS

We found him like this-

MUELLER

You killed him you fucking faggot-

CHILDS

We found him like this! Kendall was

with me the whole- Listen to me!

MUELLER

Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ...

CHILDS

Where's Pike?

CHILDS

Mueller, where's Pike?

MUELLER

We got- I don't know, we got separated

CHILDS

Before or after the explosion?

(no response)

Mueller-

MUELLER

I don't know!

37.

KENDALL

How can you not know-

MUELLER

Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,

You just shut the FUCK UP-

CHILDS

HEY!

CHILDS

We have to get out of this.    To find

the cabin.

KENDALL

What about Pike?

CHILDS

Maybe he'll be there.    Either way,

we have to go.

MUELLER

Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't

just leave him here.

CHILDS

You can carry him if you want.

KENDALL

There!

38.

NUNEZ

What happened to you-

MUELLER

What happened to you?

DUNBAR

We finished the course and came here,

Then heard an explosion-

(to Mueller)

Where's Pike?

CHILDS

We don't know. West is dead.

MUELLER

They found him. Poor fucker was

Practically blown in half-

KENDALL

Poor fucker my ass...

MUELLER

You better watch it, faggot, I'm not

Sure you and Childs didn't do him-

CHILDS

What about you, wandering around

Alone? At least we have an alibi-

DUNBAR

What do you mean, alone?

MUELLER

Pike and I got separated-

KENDALL

Yeah and he doesn't know when-

MUELLER

I remember now, it was before the

Explosion-

39.

KENDALL

Oh, you remember now-

MUELLER

I'm about two seconds away from seeing

If fairies really can fly-

NUNEZ

What about Pike?

DUNBAR

He wouldn't kill anybody. . .

MUELLER

Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict.

You know how much he hated West-

DUNBAR

I hated West, Childs hated West,

everyone with a goddamn brain hated

West but that doesn't mean we killed

him!

NUNEZ

What if it wasn't one of us?    What

if it was a local-

KENDALL

He was blown up by a phosphorous

grenade, they don't exactly sell

those at 7-11.

MUELLER

Look, here are the facts - Roberto

was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was

with Childs, and Pike's the only one

not here. He did it!

CHILDS

He is the only one unaccounted for.

KENDALL

Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed

Them both, Mueller-

DUNBAR

Shut up.

(to Mueller)

Let me see your grenades.

MUELLER

Why?

40.

DUNBAR

We were each given three so whoever

killed West will be missing one.

MUELLER

See?   Three.     Now can we please-

PIKE

Hey, guys.

DUNBAR

Whose blood is that, Jay?       West's.

PIKE

Any kindling for afire?

DUNBAR

What do you mean, West's?

PIKE

I mean I killed him.

(pause)

Isn't that what we all wanted?

HARDY

He admitted it.

KENDALL

Right in front of us. Mueller went

after him but we held him back.

Pike surrendered and volunteered to

be tied up. So we roped him to a

chair and tried to ride out the storm.

OSBORNE

Why would he just surrender?

KENDALL

Because he had a plan.

41.

PIKE

Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?

PIKE

You hated West as much as I did.

I'm not saying what I did was right,

but you can't tell me you're not

glad the motherfucker's dead.

PIKE

The thing is, we've got a real

opportunity here. You turn me in

Tomorrow and we're both fucked-

KENOALL

What are you talking about?

PIKE

A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge

get fragged on a training exercise?

The press'll crucify you and your

father. His career will be over and

it'll be your fault. But we do this

different and you come out a hero.

KENOALL

How?

PIKE

Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we

both know   it. Now I can't do it,

cause I'm   tied up, but we get the

others to   go along-

KENDALL

Don't think I want to hear this-

PIKE

Someone else can do the deed, it

doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez

too, he's got a tendency to follow

Mueller, but the rest of us can come

out ahead - the guys who took out

their Sergeant's killers!

(MORE)

42.

PIKE (CONT'D)

We'll   move the bodies out to the

creek   and say we came over the hill

right   as they fragged West, all we

gotta   do is tell the story right.

KENDALL

You're sick, Pike.

KENDALL (V.O.)

Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar.

They had been close. I was in another

room when it happened.

KENDALL (V.O.)

I don't think he meant to do it. It

was just reflex - he'd already been

gutshot. I must have passed out

cause next thing I knew...

43.

KENDALL

And that's it.

OSBORNE

Nunez was chasing Dunbar.

KENDALL

Because he'd shot Mueller.

OSBORNE

But you didn't see it, right?

KENDALL

Like I said, I was in the kitchen.

When I came out, Mueller and Pike

were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit

and Dunbar was gone.

HARDY

Why did he come back for you?

KENDALL

I honestly don't know. Maybe to

have someone to cover for him. And

I wish I could, but there's no doubt

in my mind he killed those men.

HARDY

Okay. I think that's it.     He rises

and walks to the door.

KENDALL

Mr. Hardy?

KENDALL

What did Dunbar tell you?

44.

HARDY

Pike killed West, Dunbar killed

Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

STYLES

Who killed Pike?

HARDY

Someone must have got a shot off.

He wasn't exactly a moving target.

STYLES

What do you think?

OSBORNE

It's too neat.

HARDY

"Too neat." How long have you been

an investigator?

OSBORNE

I don't think that has anything to

do with-

HARDY

That means under a year. Let me

explain what ten years of police

work has taught me - murder is basic.

There are no conspiracies, no grand

mysteries, and no evil puppet masters

behind it all, pulling the strings;

murder is shitty people doing a shitty

thing to other shitty people - it

doesn't always make sense but it's

always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

OSBORNE

I just... He came back for Kendall.

I don't think he's capable of murder.

HARDY

Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

45.

OSBORNE

Look, all we've got is what Kendall

says, and he didn't actually witness

any deaths except Nunez. He found

West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but

just their bodies - he didn't see

any crime committed.

HARDY

Well, I'm sure if he'd known this

was all going to happen he'd have

Tried harder to witness it for you-

STYLES

West's body isn't in the creek bed.

STYLES

We've already been over the terrain

twice. Nothing.

HARDY

There was a hurricane, Bill, the

wind probably moved it.

STYLES

Habeas Corpus - you have to have a

body to have a crime.

HARDY

Okay, then let's widen the search

'to include the endzone in Giants

Stadium and the trunk of my car-

STYLES

Without the body we have no physical

proof. We need a confession.

HARDY

From Dunbar? I hate to break this

to you, but I don't think he's gonna

be all that psyched to put himself

in for the death penalty.

STYLES

Nevertheless-

HARDY

Nevertheless what'? Kendall will

testify and that'll be enough.

STYLES

Not for me.

46.

HARDY

You mean not enough to save you.

STYLES

JAG gets here in three hours.   Try

for the confession.

HARDY

(cheerfully)

Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with

your buddy. Kendall - seems you

killed three people!

DUNBAR

That son of a bitch.

HARDY

That'd be my reaction too-

DUNBAR

He's lying.

HARDY

Well, why didn't you say so? We'll

Just drop all your charges, then-

DUNBAR

I'm serious-

HARDY

Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you

got exactly zero truck with us; right

now we'd take the word of a crackhead

over yours, so if you've got something

to say, say it.

DUNBAR

Did Kendall tell you about the PX?

OSBORNE

He said he worked there-

DUNBAR

No, did he tell you about it?   About

the business Childs ran?

OSBORNE

What business?

47.

DUNBAR

Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a

lot easier when you don't feel pain-

HARDY

So Childs made some side money, so

what? People are dead, Ray, and the

only one we have to blame is you-

DUNBAR

Didn't shoot West-

HARDY

Yeah, we know, Pike did.

DUNBAR

You think you know everything, don't

you? You haven't even scratched the

surface.

HARDY

I know enough to know you got two

choices - you can sign a confession,

in which case you'll probably spend

the rest of your life in a military

prison, or you can tell us to fuck

off, in which case you'll probably

get the gas chamber.

(smiling)

Am I scratching your surface yet?

OSBORNE

Hardy!

HARDY

Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

48.

OSBORNE

I don't know.

STYLES

Tom, where are you going-

HARDY

Home, I'm done.

STYLES

What about the confession?

HARDY

You want a confession? Why don't

you confess, Bill: people are dead

and you don't give a shit about it!

Only reason you called me is to

protect your fucking job, you know

this is your fault-

STYLES

What the hell are you talking about-

HARDY

I'm talking about West! We had him,

Bill, we were there. You're the

fucking Base Commander, you knew

what he did to Cadets and you let

him go on the way he always he has-

Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a

legend-

HARDY

You knew what he was capable of and

you just stood by. It was just a

matter of time till somebody fragged

his ass, and you know what? He

deserved it. There's your confession.

OSBORNE

Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just

leave-

HARDY

Watch me.

49.

OSBORNE

You said you owed Styles and now

you're gonna turn your back on him?

HARDY

West was a monster! Fifteen years

ago, I was here, I was Section Eight,

I was Pike. Fuck being the knife

dummy- that thing he did, stripping

Pike down, making him stand outside

all night? He did that every year,

he did that to me. Fifteen years

ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm

supposed to care that somebody offed

him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.

OSBORNE

You did more than try. You cracked

Dunbar in less than three minutes,

as an investigator you're phenomenal-

HARDY

Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?

OSBORNE

I was starting to believe you, you

know? That you weren't who everyone

Said. I guess I was wrong-

HARDY

Oh, spare me the reverse psychology

bullshit! This isn't my "great second

chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks

I'm a piece of shit cop who took

money and nothing is going to change

that. Nobody will ever know what

happens here-

OSBORNE

But you will.

HARDY

Why do you care?

OSBORNE

Because it's my job. Because people

are dead. Because of the whole honor

and duty thing, make a difference in

the world, crap like that.

(pause)

We can do this, Hardy.

50.

OSBORNE

Two and a half hours. That's all

I'm asking. Two and a half hours to

maybe get the truth. Silence.

HARDY

I didn't shoot West...

OSBORNE

What?

HARDY

Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot

West. West wasn't shot, Kendall

said he was blown apart by a

phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never

saw the body.

DUNBAR

Apologize-

HARDY

You saw West's body.

DUNBAR

Of course-

OSBORNE

Where?

DUNBAR

The creek bed-

HARDY

And he'd been shot.

DUNBAR

Yeah-

OSBORNE

What about the phosphorous grenade?

DUNBAR

One went off, yeah, but it didn't

Touch him- I thought you knew this-

51.

HARDY

Tell it to me.

DUNBAR

Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the

fuck did you guys do?

CHILDS

We found him like this...

KENDALL

Somebody emptied a full clip into

him-

HARDY (V.O.}

Stop.

HARDY

Kendall told us Mueller was the one

who found them with West's body.

DUNBAR

He's lying, then. We didn't see

Mueller till we got to the cabin.

MUELLER

Jesus, what happened?

DUNBAR

(breathing hard)

West...he's dead.

OSBORNE (V.O.}

Back up.

OSBORNE

Mueller was alone in the cabin?

52.

DUNBAR

Yeah.

MUE:LLER

Pike and I got separated... then I

heard gunfire. Close.

DUNBAR

So did we.   Why didn't you come?

MUELLER

I was afraid... Mueller voice FADES

OUT as he continues to talk.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

I didn't buy it. But Mueller had

all three of his grenades.

OSBORNE

At least you and Kendall agree on

that.

HARDY

What happened next?     Dunbar shudders.

DUNBAR

Pike came back.

PIKE

What the fuck happened to you-

MUELLER

What the fuck happened to you? One

minute you're next to me and the

next you're gone and the sky lights

up like fucking Christmas-

DUNBAR

Where have you been, Jay?

53.

PIKE

Wandering through a hurricane trying

to find this place. It's gettin'

bad out there-

(looking around)

Where's West?

CHILDS

Yeah, right. . .

DUNBAR

Shut up.

(to Pike)

West's dead.

PIKE

What?

DUNBAR

Where have you been, Jay?

PIKE

Oh, no. . . no, fuck that-

NUNEZ

Hey!

PIKE

Roberto, what the fuck?

DUNBAR

We just want to check your pack-

PIKE

Why?

MUELLER

Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade

first-

PIKE

Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone

turns up dead, you just look for the

Darkest face in the crowd-

DUNBAR

You know it's not like that-

54.

PIKE

Do I?

NUNEZ

Let him check your pack.

DUNBAR

Tie him up.

PIKE

Just like the first day, huh?    You

standing guard on me.

PIKE

This place ain't gonna hold much

longer.

PIKE

You and me are friends, right?

PIKE

Right?

DUNBAR

Yeah...

PIKE

You gotta untie me.

(off Dunbar's look)

I didn't do this thing, Ray.

55.

DUNBAR

You hated West more than any of us.

PIKE

Maybe, but that don't make me a killer-

DUNBAR

You're the only one missing a grenade.

PIKE

Which anyone coulda taken out of my

gear on the chopper. Were you

watching your pack on the ride in?

PIKE

Ray, this is my life    here. I ain't

gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is

gone, but you know I    couldn't have

done this. It's not     in me.

DUNBAR

If not you, then who?

PIKE

Mueller.

DUNBAR

Oh, come on-

PIKE

We're sweeping our area and suddenly

he's gone. Couple minutes later,

phosphorous grenade pops off about a

third of a click away-

DUNBAR

That's exactly what he says about

you.

PIKE

Who you gonna trust, Ray?    Him or

your friend?

DUNBAR

You hated West, Mueller loved him-

PIKE

Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX

Scam, Mueller was in on it-

DUNBAR

Bullshit.

56.

PIKE

Look in my pack.

DUNBAR

Why?

PIKE

Just look.   Little pocket.

PIKE

Combat grade morphine.    Mueller sold

it to me. .

DUNBAR

You're lying-

PIKE

Pull up my sleeve.    Right arm.

PIKE

That look like a lie to you? I been

using solid for the last eight weeks.

PIKE

After that first night on the parade

Grounds with you, I was bad -

Exposure, malnutrition, the works.

I needed something to keep me from

crashing. Mueller found me.

PIKE (V.O.)

He said he knew guy who had an in at

the PX, could hook me up. This is

before I knew what a dick he was.

57.

PIKE

Later on Childs got assigned there,

started running the shit out to every

cadet who needed it. But I was our

class's first customer.. .

DUNBAR

Why... why didn't you tell me?

PIKE

Becoming a morphine addict during

Basic ain't exactly something you

want to broadcast. Only Mueller and

Childs know.

DUNBAR

That still doesn't mean you didn't

kill him.

PIKE

You saw West, right?   How was he

killed?

DUNBAR

Full clip to the body-

PIKE

From up close or far away?

DUNBAR

His chest was hamburger-

PIKE

That's close range. You go full

auto on a guy from close range, you're

gonna be swimming in blood. Look at

my uniform. Nothing.

PIKE

And where's Mueller's? When I came

in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.

58.

PIKE

Way I figure it, West must have found

out about their little business and

was gonna bust them, so they decided

to get rid of him first...

DUNBAR

(softly)

They?

PIKE

Mueller and Childs. One of them

must've taken the grenade from my

pack on the chopper...

PIKE (V.O.)

Then Mueller ditches me during the

exercise and heads for the creek.

PIKE (V.O.)

He blows the grenade to frame me and

gets West to come running... .

WEST

What the fuck is going on?!

59.

MUELLER

Don't know, sir, I-

PIKE

Childs' job is easy, he only has to

delay Kendall long enough for Mueller

to get away.

CHILDS

GET DOWN!

PIKE (V.O.)

Now all Mueller has to do is get rid

of the evidence...

PIKE (V.O.)

And wait for everyone else to arrive.

DUNBAR

I... I don't know...

PIKE

What don't you know?

DUNBAR

This is a lot of information to be

Getting... I have to think-

60.

PIKE

There's no time to think, Ray, we

gotta get out of here! You untie

me, we grab the guns, get Kendall

and Nunez, and make a run for it-

DUNBAR

No... no, we can just wait till we

get back and then tell the M.P.'s-

PIKE

We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a

black face, a criminal record, and

over a hundred other cadets who'll

testify how much I hated West - my

court martial will take six minutes.

It's either me or them, Ray, and you

gotta decide right now.

PIKE

Untie me.

PIKE

Untie me, Ray.

PIKE

Thank God. . .

MUELLER (O.S.)

What the fuck are you doing?

MUELLER

Guys, get out here!

PIKE

This place is going, Mueller.     We

gotta move-

61.

MUELLER

Shut the fuck up.

(to the others)

He was gonna cut him loose.

NUNEZ

Why?

PIKE

Cause I didn't do it.

CHILDS

Get away from there.

MUELLER

We all know what you did, Pike. I

don't know what kind of nigger voodoo

You been working in here, but-

PIKE

Where's your shirt, Mueller?

MUELLER

Used it to start the fire-

PIKE

Still got mine on, not a speck of

blood on it. Not a bad trick for a

murderer- you said you burned yours?

MUELLER

Was freezing from the hurricane-

KENDALL

So you took off your shirt?

MUELLER

To start a fire, goddammit!

(pointing to Pike)

What about him, huh? Maybe he offed

the Sarge and changed shirts, brought

an extra one in his pack. Y'ever

think of that? Go ahead, cut him

loose! First chance he gets, he'll

waste the rest of us, that's how

they work-

62.

PIKE

Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of

Here-

MUELLER

We're not going anywhere.

PIKE

Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place

you under military arrest for the

Murder of Sergeant Nathan West-

MUELLER

The fuck are you talking about-

PIKE

You are to be stripped of all weapons

And placed under guard-

MUELLER

Bullshit-

PIKE

Until we return to base, and

ballistics can match your weapon to

the slugs in Sergeant West's body-

MUELLER

Shut up!

KENDALL

Mueller, what the fuck-

DUNBAR

Don't do this-

PIKE

A test will no doubt link you to the

Killing-

DUNBAR

Put it down!

MUELLER

Tell him to shut up-

PIKE

-failure to comply with this arrest

is a court martialable offense in

and of itself-

63.

KENDALL

Pike, please-

PIKE

Although that won't matter much when

Coupled with the murder charge-

MUELLER

SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING NIGGER-

PIKE

You stupid white trash motherfucker,

I saw you do it-

KENDALL

Oh.. . my God...

MUELLER

He wouldn't... stop talking...

DUNBAR

(softly)

So you killed him?

MUELLER

I. . .

CHILDS

Get that hand away.

DUNBAR

You too?

64.

CHILDS

We can still come out of this okay.

Pike got free, he got a gun, he came

after us. That's the story.

MUELLER

West was one thing, but this-

CHILDS

Shut up, Mueller.

KENDALL

You framed-him...

CHILDS

None of that matters now. We got

two dead bodies and a story that

explains them. You're either with

us, or against us - which is it?

KENDALL

Okay-

65.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

And then I killed the last of them.

DUNBAR

Can I have some coffee?

OSBORNE

Yeah... yeah, sure.

HARDY

You shot Childs and Nunez.

DUNBAR

They would have killed us both. You

want me to write a confession, I'll

write a confession.

HARDY

You saved Kendall's life-

DUNBAR

But not Pike's.

OSBORNE

Why didn't you tell us all this in

the first place?

66.

DUNBAR

Would you have believed me?

OSBORNE

Where's the cabin?

DUNBAR

Don't know on a map. West told us

it was there, we just found it.

Maybe the hurricane took it away.

HARDY

Raymond, for you to have any chance

of coming out of this, we need to

locate the other bodies and examine

them to corroborate your testimony.

Otherwise this is just another story-

DUNBAR

Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for

college money. I didn't ask for any

of this - I tried to do the right

thing out there and people got killed.

You say finding those bodies'll help

me, then go find them. I don't want

to die.

OSBORNE

Talk it through: Childs, Mueller,

and Nunez know they're going out on

the regular Tuesday Night drill,

hurricane or ho hurricane, so they

plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.

HARDY

And they're smart about it. They

know when you commit a crime you

know is going to be investigated,

you need a fall guy and for that to

work, you have to have a witness.

OSBORNE

Dunbar.

HARDY

Exactly, someone who's not involved,

who's word can't be questioned. You

only let them see what you want them

to see, you make them believe, so

when the time comes, they've totally

bought into your version of events.

67.

OSBORNE

They believe the innocent are guilty

and the guilty are innocent.

HARDY

And if they're asked, that's what

they'll tell the, world.

OSBORNE

So it's a good plan but it goes wrong;

Mueller flips out and shoots their

fall guy, which means they have to

bring Dunbar and Kendall into the

Cover story-

HARDY

Kendall maybe would have agreed, but

The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-

OSBORNE

Buttfucks the cabin?

HARDY

And all hell breaks loose. A lot of

Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys

and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

OSBORNE

So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall

out from under a house, does the

Senator's son try and get us to put

his savior in the gas chamber?

HARDY

That bugs you too?

OSBORNE

Little bit.

HARDY

Let's go talk to Bill...

STYLES

Fucking asthma... This whole thing's

driving it nuts.

HARDY

What I said before-

68.

STYLES

Was dead right. You think Dunbar's

on the level?

HARDY

Yeah.

STYLES

Does Osborne agree?

OSBORNE

Yes, sir, I do.

HARDY

Dunbar's confession. It should be

enough to get you out of trouble.

STYLES

You want Kendall, don't you?

OSBORNE

He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You

don't do that if you're not involved.

STYLES

You both know if you do this, if you

go after a Senator's son and you're

wrong... it's not just me in the hot

seat anymore.

OSBORNE

We know.

STYLES

(to Hardy)

I'm giving you a chance to walk away.

HARDY

We know.

STYLES

You don't get to be a Colonel without

compromising. Without getting out

of the way of the bigger dogs. You

politic, play it safe, think of the

career first. And when things get

dirty, you just look the other way...

69.

STYLES

Four of my men are dead. You think

Kendall had something to do with it,

then you go get the son of a bitch.

OSBORNE

Pike never confessed.

KENDALL

We've been making progress, I see.

KENDALL

Running out of time, are we? Tick-

Tock, tick-tock, how long till your

witnesses fly the coop?

OSBORNE

Fifty minutes.

KENDALL

Not much time to solve the crime.

Tell me, detective, how did it feel

taking blood money from Guissepe

Torres? Did it weigh on your

conscience or did you just not think

about it?

HARDY

You tried to pin three stone murders

on Dunbar-

KENDALL

How many murders did you cover up?

One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

HARDY

(to Osborne)

Can I go to jail for punching a guy

who's been shot?

KENDALL

I think they're giving me the wrong

medicine. This isn't a very good

Hospital, you know-

70.

KENDALL

Epileptic attacks are murder on your

system. Rattle your internal organs

like a paint mixer.

HARDY

My heart weeps.

OSBORNE

Pike never confessed.

KENDALL

No, but it got you interested, didn't

it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray

to tell you terribly sordid tales

about drugs and creek beds and dead

little sergeants who stuck their

noses where they didn't belong.

HARDY

Is it the truth?

KENDALL

There's that word again.

(smiling)

As I told you, I wasn't in the room

when everyone started shooting.

OSBORNE

Dunbar says you were.

KENDALL

Then he's mistaken. You know, I

really don't think my father would

approve of this line of questioning-

HARDY

Why did you tell us he shot everybody,

Levi? You put him in for three

murders, the man saved your life-

KENDALL

So I should stay silent about his

misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran

in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller

were dead, and Dunbar was running

out the door with the smoking gun-

HARDY

Dunbar was running out the door?

Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was

confused, because I thought you said

Nunez was running out the door.

71.

KENDALL

No.   I said Dunbar.

HARDY

Huh. You know, I really thought you

said Nunez. I thought you said

"Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta

check the tape on that.

(off Kendall's look)

Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.

This one too. Cause it'd be a real

break for us to catch you in a lie.

KENDALL

I believe your next line is "What

are you trying to hide?"

HARDY

Well?

KENDALL

Sorry to disappoint. I'm on

painkillers for the injury - they

cloud the mind. You're right, it

was Nunez. Any more questions?

KENDALL

Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs

were quite the pair, the type of

guys you didn't feel comfortable

going to sleep around. Completely

capable of murder. But as I said, I

didn't hear the exchange before the

shooting. I wasn't in the room.

HARDY

Dunbar will testify that you were.

KENDALL

Then we'll leave it up to the courts -

His word against mine. What does

his father do again? Steelworker?

(smiling)

Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice

will be served. In any case, my

father will definitely want to talk

to you about all these questions,

these accusations on his son. He's

quite protective.

72.

OSBORNE

I need to talk to you outside.

HARDY

We're fucked, I know-

OSBORNE

They got their stories straight.

HARDY

What?

OSBORNE

What Kendall said - "the type of

guys you don't feel comfortable going

to sleep around." That's what Dunbar

said about Childs to the letter.

HARDY

Are you sure?

OSBORNE

Positive.    Hardy, they planned this.

OSBORNE

Not bad for hostile and uncooperative,

eh?

HARDY

Something funny, Levi?

KENDALL

I was just thinking of what's going

to happen to your careers when my

father gets through with you.

HARDY

Why don't you talk to Levi off the

record for a second?

OSBORNE

Good idea.

73.

OSBORNE

You and Dunbar got your stories

straight. Little details, little

inconsistencies, designed to bounce

us back from one of you to the other,

asking questions, killing time, until

the transport arrives and whisks you

away to where Senator Daddy can

protect you. You think you're just

going to slide out of this? You're

an accessory to murder, Levi, you're

Going to jail-

KENDALL

You can't threaten me-

HARDY

Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber

if he's not-

KENDALL

Didn't do anything-

OSBORNE

It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going

to find those bodies and when we do,

I'm going to make sure one of them

has a bullet in them that matches

your weapon-

KENDALL

What?

HARDY

That's a fantastic idea-

OSBORNE

See, I just take your gun to the

morgue and fire it into one of their

skulls; then I call every newspaper

in the country with the story about

how Senator Kendall's gay son went

nuts on a training mission-

KENDALL

(beginning to panic)

It won't work-

OSBORNE

It will and you know why?

(MORE)

74.

OSBORNE

Because you're not a person anymore,

you're a cadet in the United States

Army; you have no identity, no Miranda

warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna

throw you to the wolves, and unlike

you I'm gonna get away with it,

because you're pissing me off!

OSBORNE

Enjoy your flight to Washington-

KENDALL

Wait-

OSBORNE

What.

KENDALL

Dunbar's telling the truth.

OSBORNE

Wrong answer-

KENDALL

We did get our stories straight, but

not because we killed anyone.

(pause)

It was because I threatened him.

HARDY

Why?

KENDALL

Because of what I saw.

(pause)

Who really killed West.

OSBORNE

Who killed Sergeant West?

OSBORNE

Who, Levi-

KENDALL

Childs.

75.

HARDY

How do you know?

KENDALL

Because I was standing next to him.

KENDALL

I was in on the PX thing. He and

Mueller and me, we were making

thousands. West found out. Childs

said we were just gonna scare him -

Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole

speech prepared about how if he ratted

us, his career was over. We met him

in the creek bed but before I said

anything...

KENDALL

I swear, I didn't know he was gonna

do it. After, he told me we were

gonna pin it on Pike, one of our

biggest customers.

KENDALL (V.O.)

Nobody'd believe the word of a black

junkie ex-con against ours.

KENDALL (V.O.)

He told me I'd better keep quiet, or

I'd end up the same as West.

KENDALL (V.O.)

Dunbar didn't know anything about

any of it. Everything he told you

was true, except after...

76.

KENDALL (V.O.)

I told him what had really happened

to West. Told him to keep quiet

about it or I'd destroy him. Because

if it came out that I was involved

with the whole PX scam, my father

would be finished.

KENDALL

I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's

been trying to cover for me the whole

time. We got here, you came to  see

me... I didn't know if I could trust

him with that kind of secret-

OSBORNE

So you framed him. The same way

Childs was going to frame Pike.

HARDY

Little advice, Levi, next time you

frame a guy, pick someone who can't

defend themselves.

OSBORNE

What happened with Nunez?

KENDALL

He came after us. And I told Dunbar

he had to kill him...

KENDALL

Do it!

KENDALL

And he did.

77.

OSBORNE

That's how you do good cop/bad cop.

HARDY

Childs did it, huh?

HARDY

First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs?

When are we getting to the others?

When are we gonna hear about Nunez?

HARDY

Or Dunbar?

HARDY

Or you, Levi? When is it finally

going to come out that you were the

one who killed him?

KENDALL

I didn't-

HARDY

But you can't prove it! You can't

prove anything until we find the

bodies!

HARDY

You lied to us, Levi, you're going

to the gas chamber unless you tell

us where to find them!

KENDALL

I don't know-

HARDY

Where are they!

KENDALL

Maybe-

HARDY

MAYBE WHAT-

78.

KENDALL

MAYBE HE-

OSBORNE

Get something between his teeth!

HARDY

Shit!

NURSE

What is-

OSBORNE

He's an epileptic!

DOCTOR

You're going to have to wait outside-

OSBORNE

He's a witness!

DOCTOR

It doesn't matter, outside-

KENDALL

F-F-F-F-F-F-Fuh-

OSBORNE

He's trying to say something-

DOCTOR

Out, NOW.

KENDALL

Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-

79.

DOCTOR

SECURITY!

KENDALL

Fuh-Fucking Pike.

HARDY

I pushed him too hard.

OSBORNE

You couldn't have known-

HARDY

Yeah, I could've.      Should've.

OSBORNE

You wanted to get the truth.

HARDY

No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate

him. For what he did to Dunbar.

For fucking over the little guy.

OSBORNE

You mean the falsely accused?

OSBORNE

You wanted to break him.

HARDY

Yeah.

OSBORNE

So did I.

STYLES

It's over.   Time of death was 4:42.

(MORE)

80.

STYLES (CONT'D)

JAG's been notified and I called the

Senator myself. My report will

reflect that his medical condition

made this unavoidable... you two had

no culpability in the matter.

HARDY

That's horseshit and you know it.

STYLES

Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll

carry it.

STYLES

We found the cabin. Demolished,

like they said. No bodies. Hurricane

like that coulda scooped 'em up,

dropped them down two counties over.

We'll find them.

STYLES

You think you could explain all this

to me?

HARDY

I wouldn't know where to start.

(pause)

I guess it was about one man framing

another. He thought if the other

guy got blamed, people would over

look his own wrong doings.

OSBORNE

What happens to Dunbar now?

STYLES

Gets on his plane in ten minutes,

which means you two are done.

You'll understand if I don't walk

you out.

HARDY

They're taking your command, aren't

they?

STYLES

The Senator...

81.

HARDY

I'm sorry, Bill.

STYLES

Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal

with the West's of the world.

HARDY

You're a good soldier, Bill.

STYLES

I thought you said that wasn't a

compliment.

HARDY

This time it is.

OSBORNE

Your car's in the motor pool.     I'll

walk you over.

OSBORNE

So what now?

HARDY

Now I go home, get drunk, and try

and forget this ever happened.

OSBORNE

Think it'll work?

HARDY

Nah.

OSBORNE

You know, you never told me why you

left the army.

HARDY

It dawned on me one day that we were

supposed to be a nation founded on

the principle of questioning

authority... and all I did here was

follow orders. It didn't add up.

82.

HARDY [CONT'D)

Plus, I got kicked out.

OSBORNE

For what?

HARDY

That's gonna stay my secret.

OSBORNE

We were close to something with

Kendall.

HARDY

Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near.

(pause)

I haven't by any chance grown on

you, have I?

OSBORNE

No.

HARDY

Good, just making sure.

OSBORNE

We're going need a vehicle release.

SERGEANT

Sign here and here.

(recognizing them)

Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on

that whole hulabaloo from last night?

OSBORNE

Yeah.

SERGEANT

Terrible tragedy. One of those

Section Eight boys worked in here.

Pike. Heard he got out okay.

HARDY

Hate to be the bearer of bad news,

Sergeant, but he didn't make it.

83.

SERGEANT

Funny. I swear I saw them bring him

and the smaller guy in this morning.

OSBORNE

No, no that was Cadet Dunbar-

SERGEANT

You mean Ray Dunbar?     Well, that

ain't right.

HARDY

Why not?

SERGEANT

I saw 'em get off the chopper.     White

guys, right? Two

OSBORNE

So?

SERGEANT

Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.

SERGEANT

Did I say something wrong-

HARDY

(to Osborne)

What runway's that transport leaving

from?

OSBORNE

Four-

HARDY

Get in.

84.

OSBORNE

We need to talk to him-

JAG LAWYER

Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule

To keep-

OSBORNE

We need to talk to him now.

HARDY

We're not finished yet-

DUNBAR

You wanna bet?

JAG LAWYER

M.P.'s, escort this man off the base!

DUNBAR

(smiling)

Sorry, detectives.     Time's up.

HARDY

James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!

OSBORNE

Let's go have a talk.

JAG LAWYER

This is your entire career here-

OSBORNE

Fuck off.

85.

OSBORNE

We got maybe three minutes till they

break it down.

HARDY

Right back where we started.

DUNBAR

You want to talk about baseball now?

HARDY

No more games, right, Pike?    It was

you who West singled out...

HARDY

You who got hooked by Mueller's

morphine...

HARDY

You who did it all.

HARDY

You wanted revenge on West, revenge

on them all, so you killed them.

HARDY (V.O.)

But that wasn't enough. You needed

a new identity, because no one was

going to believe James Randall Pike,

convicted felon, had acted so nobly

in the face of danger - you needed a

name people could trust, one that

hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't

publicly been West's bitch boy.

86.

OSBORNE

You kept Kendall alive to corroborate

your story and he did it all they

way up to the end. You even gave

him his own motive in case we decided

to burn him, too.

DUNBAR

Can't do that now, though, can you?

HARDY

You walked into the army a convicted

felon with a sentence of five years

in a uniform and were going walk out

eight weeks later with a different

name, a clean record, and an honorable

discharge - a guy who did "everything

he could" to save his friends.

DUNBAR

Is that what I did, now? And of

course, you can prove all of it.

OSBORNE

We can prove that you're not Ray

Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet

is a court-martial in and of itself-

DUNBAR

Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar?

Was I ever told to state my name

rank and serial number for the record?

No. You assumed who I was, because

I was wearing this uniform. Don't

believe me?

DUNBAR

Check your tapes.

HARDY

We don't need the tapes-

DUNBAR

Oh, you don't? What else do you

have on me? You haven't found any

bodies yet, have you?

HARDY

We've found all of them.

87.

DUNBAR

Ohhhh, I don't think so...

OSBORNE

How do you know that?

DUNBAR

Just a guess. Maybe they're not

where they're supposed to be. Maybe

somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -

no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still

plays as self defense. Face it

detectives ... you have nothing.

HARDY

Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun-

DUNBAR

(terrified)

Jesus!

OSBORNE

Hardy, what are you doing-

HARDY

Isn't this how your story goes?

Pike annoys someone so much he gets

shot in the head-

DUNBAR

Please, please don't-

HARDY

We can tie you to the chair if it'll

work better for you-

OSBORNE

Hardy, for Chrissakes-

HARDY

WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?

DUNBAR

(practically in tears)

You'll never find it-

88.

DUNBAR

You'll never find it cause HE'S NOT

DEAD!

STYLES

What in God's name is going on?

DUNBAR

He- He made me do it-

HARDY

Do what?

DUNBAR

Hunting- we had to hunt him-

JAG LAWYER

Sergeant, arrest these men!

OSBORNE

You mean the exercise?

DUNBAR

There never was an exercise! Never

targets, never teams, I don't even

know if there's a creek bed out there-

HARDY

What did you do?

JAG LAWYER

That's enough-

HARDY

Goddammit, what did you DO?!

DUNBAR

I COULDN'T KILL HIM!

STYLES

Hang on.

JAG LAWYER

Colonel-

STYLES

No.   I want to hear this.

89.

DUNBAR

You're right. I was the one he

singled out. Beat me morning, noon,

and night, ran me ragged. When

Mueller found me, I was gone. He

gave me a little taste...

MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)

I got a friend with an in at the PX,

can hook you up...

DUNBAR

What I didn't know, was his friend

was West. He ran the whole thing.

STYLES

You're lying, son.

DUNBAR

You think it's easy to have all that

morphine just disappear without a

higher up authorizing it? Check the

requisition orders, I'll lay money

it's his signature on them.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

That was his game, see? Ride the

cadets so hard they'd need something

to stay on their feet. Then he'd

send Mueller or Kendall to them,

waving around their magic needle

promising to make it all go away.

DUNBAR

It wasn't a new thing either.   He'd

been doing this for years.

(MORE)

90.

DUNBAR

Every nine weeks, a new class of

cadets, new potential customers.

The amount of money involved over

that period of time... this was some

high stakes shit.

DUNBAR

Dunbar moved his through the kitchen.

I worked in the motor pool and hooked

all the mechanics. By the time the

hurricane hit, we were all in. Some

using, some pushing, some both. But

then something happened. West heard

one of us was about to talk, to blow

his whole operation. He figured

he'd made enough money, had enough

of the army, maybe it was time to

disappear. But first he was gonna

teach us one last thing.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

The Tuesday Night drill was the

perfect cover. The hurricane made

it even better.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

He put us on the chopper and flew us

to his cabin. And then he told us.

WEST

Gentlemen! It has come to my

attention that there is a traitor in

our midst. Someone who was going to

break the code of fraternal

brotherhood that I have endeavored

to create in all of you. Perhaps

that failure is mine. But we take

care of our own. And this traitor

must be made to pay.

91.

WEST

Run.

NUNEZ

Sir, I wasn't-

WEST

I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found

the letter you'd written to the

Colonel in your locker.  You were

going to betray us all.  Now, run.

WEST

Now we'll see whose training's paid

off the most. You are to hunt Cadet

Nunez down and bring his body back

to me. If you fail and he escapes,

we all go down together.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

It was insanity. We were hunting a

man down to kill him.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

He got Mueller first.

92.

MUELLER

Roberto...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

He took his gun. Used it on Childs.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

I can't imagine what it was like.

Having your friends try to kill you...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

But you do what you have to survive.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple

minutes later.

DUNBAR (V.O.)

It came to me in a split second.

Change clothes, change identities.

If James Pike gets discharged he

goes right back to jail. But if I

was Dunbar, I could walk away from

all this with a new life. But then...

93.

NUNEZ

Put it down!

DUNBAR

I just want to go!

NUNEZ

You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought

you were my friend!

DUNBAR

I have to get Kendall to a hospital!

NUNEZ

He was gonna kill me too!

NUNEZ {CONT'D)

I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my

best friend and I had to snap his

neck because he was gonna shoot me

for drugs! For West!

DUNBAR

We don't have to do this! You go

that way, I'll go this way!

NUNEZ

You'll shoot me in the back!

DUNBAR

You killed three people!    Isn't that

enough for one night?

DUNBAR

I don't want to die out here, Roberto!

Do you?

94.

NUNEZ

If you even twitch...

DUNBAR

Forgive me. ..

WEST

Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You

get the gold star.

DUN BAR

Fuck you.

WEST

You'd best get him out of here.

Don't worry about the bodies, they'll

be taken care of.

WEST

This is where we part ways, Cadet.

You tell them I died out here, or

I'll come back for you. Tell them

one of the others did me. Mueller,

Childs, I don't care who. You and

Kendall, you tell them a story.

(smiling)

You can tell a story, can't you?

95.

WEST

Dismissed.

DUNBAR

I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.

He came after us with a vengeance.

(to Styles)

You know the rest.

HARDY

And the bodies?

DUNBAR

You won't find them. Won't find

West, either. He's too good.

OSBORNE

No bodies, no West...

HARDY

No death certificates.    No crime.

DUNBAR

Just four people MIA.    Silence.

JAG LAWYER

You'll testify to this, the

corruption, the drug scam?

JAG LAWYER

We can cut a deal for you on the

Nunez killing.

DUNBAR

I don't want any deals.

96.

JAG LAWYER

If you're telling the truth, the PX

requisition records will prove it-

DUNBAR

All the proof you need will be when

West comes back and puts a bullet in

my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a

dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.

(looking at Hardy)

We both should have died out there

with our brothers. I know that now.

JAG LAWYER

I'll take him now if you don't mind.

DUNBAR

Tell me, detective.   Did you get

what you wanted?

HARDY

Not even close.

STYLES

Tom-

OSBORNE

We need to talk-

HARDY

Seven.

OSBORNE

What?

97.

HARDY

Seven guys. What was it you said?

You were "just starting to believe I

wasn't the guy people said".

HARDY {CONT'D)

Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's

question. How many? Seven.

OSBORNE

This isn't the time-

HARDY

This is the perfect time. You know

what makes a good detective? The

number of confessions they get.

You're a good detective, Osborne.

So now you get mine.

OSBORNE

What if I don't want it?

HARDY

Tough.

HARDY

Thing about    taking money is, you

don't have    to do anything.  You just

sit there.     Maybe you don't return a

phone call.     Maybe you don't follow

up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the

money, your    work's done.

HARDY

Seven unsolved murders. And you

know what? It didn't weigh on my

conscience. Not one goddamn bit.

OSBORNE

That's not true.

HARDY

There are degrees of truth, officer.

Always degrees.

98.

OSBORNE

You're a good man, Hardy.

HARDY

Really.

OSBORNE

Far as I'm concerned, whatever you

did in the past can stay in the past.

HARDY

I may not be growing on you, but

you're sure as hell growing on me.

OSBORNE

And because you're a good man, I

know you'll do the right thing.

OSBORNE

Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody

took him off the plane before it

left. My guess is he's already dead.

HARDY

West?

OSBORNE

Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.

OSBORNE

These are the requisitions from the

PX, the ones used to release the

drugs to Mueller. West signed half

of them - Pike was telling the truth.

Look who signed the other half.

HARDY

Do I have a choice in this?

OSBORNE

Yeah. I can wait till you're off

the base and do it myself.

99.

HARDY

Fuck it.   Let's go finish this.

HARDY

"You have to get out of the way of

the bigger dogs". That was good.

STYLES

Tom, is that you?

HARDY

It was so good, I actually forgot

you're one of the bigger dogs now.

The Base Commander. The one in

control.

STYLES

What are you talking about?

HARDY

If you let him testify then it would

have all come out. West was supposed

to take care of it out there, shut

Nunez up and then disappear. But it

got messy and people got killed. So

you called your old pal Tom Hardy,

figuring if worse came to worse,

he'd cover for you.

STYLES

You're drunk-

HARDY

I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.

Not for this.

STYLES

Look-

100.

HARDY

Stay where you are.

STYLES

Or what?   You've gone round the bend-

HARDY

West had a partner. Someone who

knew how to get things done.

HARDY

What I can't understand is why you

signed these. If you'd just let

West take care of the paperwork, no

one would have known, but you got

careless. So when Pike finally told

the truth you had to get rid of him,

too.

STYLES

That's preposterous-

HARDY

Toxicology report came back.

Kendall's attack was caused by a

drug known as anephadrine, maybe

you've heard of it. It's for

asthmatics. If an epileptic takes

enough, it kills them. I checked

with the nurses at the hospital -

you're the only other person who

visited Kendall.

STYLES

Wanted to see if he was okay-

HARDY

You poisoned him, Bill. You heard

our interrogation, you knew he was

ready to crack, so you killed him,

just like Pike.

STYLES

I'm not even going to dignify that-

HARDY

No!  You will stand there and you

will listen! What happened to you,

Bill?  You were the one who joined

up to do good in the world. You

were the one who believed in it-

101.

STYLES

You want to get into a finger pointing

contest about character? The army

kicked you out for drugs, the cops

fired you for taking bribes from a

mobster, and you think you can stand

there and lecture me on codes of

conduct? There's only one criminal

standing in this room and it's you.

HARDY

Not for long.

HARDY

No more witnesses. West's a ghost.

But it doesn't matter because we

have your signature, the hospital

log, and Kendall's toxicology report.

And that'll be enough.

STYLES

You're crazy-

HARDY

You can't duck this, Bill. I may

have done every goddamn thing in my

life wrong but I won't let this

happen.

STYLES

For the last time, I have no idea

what you're talking about-

HARDY

(squinting)

Get your hands away from the desk!

HARDY

Osborne, gun!

102.

OSBORNE

It's West's, isn't it?

HARDY

Now it's over.

OSBORNE

What are you doing out here?

HARDY

Leaving without saying goodbye.

What are you gonna do?

OSBORNE

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget

this ever happened.

HARDY

Think it'll work?

OSBORNE

Nah.

HARDY

Want company?

OSBORNE

A word of advice about women - that

first hour or so after they kill

their boss? Probably not the best

time to hit on them.

HARDY

I should probably write that down.

OSBORNE

Yeah. .

OSBORNE

Your phone number?

103.

HARDY

In case you need me to testify about

the shooting. They'll clear you.

OSBORNE

He was your friend.

HARDY

Yeah. But he was a lot of other

things, too. Thanks.

HARDY

I'll see you.

OSBORNE

Hey, Hardy!

OSBORNE

I owe you this.

HARDY

You saved my life tonight. Keep it.

(pause)

Actually, don't keep it, I need the

money.

HARDY

You're one of the good ones, Osborne.

Don't sweat the details.

WEST

Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare

is simple and complex. Simple in

its goal, complex in its execution.

104.

WEST

As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare

is deception.

WEST

At all times you must confuse your

enemies, surrounding them with

uncertainty, giving them false hope.

WEST

At all times, you must mask your

true intentions.

HARDY (V.O.)

Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

OSBORNE (V.O.)

They got their stories straight. . .

WEST

What the fuck is going on?

DUNBAR

Your weapons, Sergeant.

105.

WEST

Is this about that little drug

business you all are running? Yeah,

I know about that, Roberto told me-

NUNEZ

Shut up!    Look, we won't say anything-

WEST

Fuck that. You little pissers really

think you can throw a scare into me?

WEST

You're gonna have to do a lot better

than that, son.

HARDY (O.S.)

How about this?

WEST

Didn't I kick your ass out for this

drug thing fifteen years ago?

WEST

Should've known you were involved in

this. Come on then. Let's see you

try and stick me-

HARDY

Stem to sternum. You taught me well,

Sarge.

STYLES (V.O.)

You think you could explain all this

to me?

HARDY (V.O.)

I wouldn't know where to start.

106.

HARDY (V.O.)

I guess it was about one man framing

another...

HARDY (V.O.)

When you commit a crime you know is

going to be investigated, you need a

fall guy.. .

STYLES (V.O.)

The one who won't talk was trading

live fire with the dead one as we

reached the pick-up.

HARDY

And for that to work, you have to

have a witness...

HARDY (V.O.)

Someone who's not involved, who's

word can't be questioned...

HARDY

You only let them see what you want

them to see, you make them believe...

107.

OSBORNE (V.O.)

They believe the innocent are guilty

and the guilty are innocent.

HARDY (V.O.)

And if they're asked, that's what

they'll tell the world.

WEST

Your greatest weapon will by your

allies . . .

HARDY

My brand.   Must be my lucky day.

WEST (V.O.)

. . . some of which you may have to

sacrifice for the greater good.

HARDY (V.O.)

We got the toxicology report . . .

WEST (V.O.)

Make no mistake, the innocent will

die. . .

108.

HARDY (V.O.)

Next time you frame a guy, pick

someone who can't defend themselves...

But it will not be in vain.

Sometimes, you can trick the enemy

into doing your work for you. . .

HARDY (V.O.)

He still carry those guns?

WEST (V.O.)

...if you engage in a clever enough

subterfuge.

HARDY (V.O.)

What I can't understand is why you

signed these...

OSBORNE (V.O.)

You never told me why you got kicked

out of...

STYLES (V.O.)

The army kicked you out for drugs...

MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)

I got a friend with an in at the PX,

can hook you up...

STYLES (V.O.)

There's only one criminal standing

in this room and it's you.

WEST

Which brings us to the simple goal.

For the true warrior, the one and

only objective is to emerge from

conflict unscathed.

109.

HARDY (V.O.)

I promised them I'd ask you where

West and the others are...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

Washout rejects, guys he said were

"dumbfucks too stupid to know they

dead"...

HARDY (V.O.)

He's telling the truth up to a

point...

HARDY (V.O.)

You can't prove anything until we

find the bodies...

PIKE

All we gotta do is tell the story

right...

DUNBAR (V.O.)

You haven't found any bodies yet,

have you...

HARDY (V.O.)

WHERE ARE THEY?

STYLES (V.O.)

Habeas Corpus - you have to have a

body to have a crime.

WEST

Thank you.

110.

WEST (V.O.)

You can tell a story, can't you?

HARDY (V.O.)

Murder is basic.

HARDY (V.O.)

There are no conspiracies, no grand

mysteries, no evil puppet masters

behind it all, pulling the strings.

HARDY

Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

DUNBAR

Are you ready for this?
