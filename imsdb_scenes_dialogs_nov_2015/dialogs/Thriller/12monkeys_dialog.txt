Twelve Monkeys

TWELVE MONKEYS

An original screenplay by

David Peoples

&

Janet Peoples

Inspired by

LA JETEE, a Chris Marker Film

FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

P.A. SYSTEM

Flight 784 for San Francisco is now

ready for boarding at inmate number

66578, Greely.

PRISON P.A. SYSTEM

--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

COLE

Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

JOSE

"Volunteers" again.

SCARFACE

"Volunteer duty".

The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

COLE

I didn't volunteer.

SCARFACE

You causing trouble again?

COLE

(controls his temper)

No trouble.

TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE

OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)

All openings must be closed.

OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)

If the integrity of the suit is compromised

in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper

not closed, readmittance will be denied.

TTTLES END

AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)

Raise your arms above your head.

TINY

James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.

MICROBIOLOGIST

Thank you.  You two wait outside.

SCARFACE

He's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

SCARFACE

Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.

ENGINEER

I don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're

not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

COLE

No, sir.

MICROBIOLOGIST

Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

ASTROPHYSICIST

We want you to tell us about last

night.

COLE

I went to the surface and I collected

specimens like I was told.

COLE

(worried)

I mashed the spider, didn't I?

MICROBIOLOGIST

We'll get to the spider later, Mr.

Cole.  Right now, we want to know

everything that you saw.

ASTPOPHYSICIST

Where you collected sample #4, what

street was that?

COLE

Uh...

BOTANIST

It's important to observe everything.

COLE

I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

Close your eyes, Cole.

ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Tell us in detail what you've seen in

this room.

COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

Uh, in this room?  Uh...

MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

How many of us are there?

COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

Six...seven, if you count me.

ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)

Uh, you mean the newspapers?

A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)

Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you

hear my voice?  What do I look like?

What does he look like, the man who

just spoke?  How old were you when you

left the surface?

P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)

Flight 784 now boarding at gate...

MR. PONYTAIL

WATCH IT!

TERRIFIED TRAVELER

Just exactly why did you volunteer?

ASTROPHYSICIST

Wake up, Cole.

COLE

Uh, I didn't hear the...

MICROBIOLOGIST

(tapping a pencil on the table)

I asked you, why did you volunteer?

COLE

Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me

I volunteered.

ENGINEER

We appreciate you volunteering.  You're

a very good observer, Cole.

COLE

Uh, thank you.

ENGINEER

You'll get a reduction in sentence.

ASTROPHYSICIST

To be determined by the proper authorities.

ENGINEER

You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,

do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

COLE

No, sir!

ASTROPHYSICIST

We have a very advanced program, something

very different, requires very skilled people.

MICROBIOLOGIST

An opportunity to reduce your sentence

considerably...

ZOOLOGIST

And possibly play an important role in

returning the human race to the surface

of the earth.

ENGINEER

We want tough minded people.  Strong

mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes

with "unstable" types.

ASTROPHYSICIST

For a man in your position...an opportunity.

BOTANIST

Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.

MICROBIOLOGIST

(tapping his pencil again)

Definitely a mistake!

POET

Still among the myriad microwaves, the

infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones

and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally

small, byte-sized now, tinier even than

science lurking in some vague electricity

where, if we listen we can hear the solitary

voice of that poet telling us,

"We are no other than a moving row

Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go

Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold

In Midnight by the Master of the show."

POET'S VOICE (o.s.)

"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,

Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit

Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,

Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."

POET

"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;

Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:

Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:

Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where."

FRANKI

-- so they get there and they ask the guy

real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets

agitated, starts screaming about viruses.

Totally irrational, totally disoriented,

doesn't know where he is, what day it is,

alla that stuff.  All they got was his

name.  They figure he's stoned out of

his mind, it's some kinda psychotic

episode, so they're gonna bring him...

RAILLY

He's been tested for drugs?

FRANKI

Negative for drugs.  But he took on

five cops like he was dusted to the

eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?

RAILLY

You have him in restraints.

FRANKI

Were you listening?  We got two officers in

the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus

the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill

a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

RAILLY

That would explain the bruises, I

guess.  The struggle.

FRANKI

You want to go in?  Examine him?

RAILLY

Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...

FRANKI

(unlocking the door)

James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None

of the James Coles on the computer match him.

No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.

You want me to go in with you?

RAILLY

(entering)

No, thank you.

FRANKI

I'll be right here...just in case.

RAILLY

Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.

I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the

County -- I don't work for the police.

My only concern is your well being --

do you understand that?

COLE

I need to go now.

RAILLY

I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm

not going to lie to you.  I can't make

the police let you go...but I do want

to help you.  And I want you to trust

me.  Can you do that, James?  May I

call you "James"?

COLE

"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.

RAILLY

(frowns, studies him)

Have you been a patient at County?

Have I seen you someplace?

COLE

No, not possible.  Listen, I have to

get out of here.  I'm supposed to be

getting information.

RAILLY

What kind of information?

COLE

It won't help you.  You can't do anything

about it.  You can't change anything.

RAILLY

Change what?

COLE

I need to go.

RAILLY

Do you know why you're here, James.

COLE

Because I'm a good observer.  Because I

have a tough mind.

RAILLY

I see.  You don't remember assaulting a

police officer...several officers?

COLE

They wanted identification.  I don't have

any identification.  I wasn't trying to

hurt them.

RAILLY

You don't have a driver's license,

James?  Or a Social Security card?

COLE

No.

RAILLY

Why not?  Most people have some ID.

COLE

You wouldn't understand.

RAILLY

You've been in an institution, haven't

you, James?  A hospital?

COLE

I have to go.

RAILLY

A jail?  Prison?

COLE

Underground.

RAILLY

Hiding?

COLE

I love this air.  This is wonderful air.

RAILLY

What's wonderful about the air, James?

COLE

It's so clean.  No germs.

RAILLY

You're afraid of germs?

COLE

I have to go.

RAILLY

Why do you think there aren't any germs

in the air, James?

COLE

This is April, right?

RAILLY

July.

COLE

(sudden panic)

July?!

RAILLY

Do you know what year it is?

COLE

What year is it?

RAILLY

What year do you think it is?

COLE

1995?

RAILLY

You think it's July of 1995?  That's

the future, James.  Do you think you're

living in the future?

COLE

(slightly confused)

No, 1995 is the past.

RAILLY

1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.

COLE

Where are you taking me?

POLICEMAN #1

South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.

You're gonna love it.

COLE

South of France?!  I don't want to go

to the South of France.  I want to make

a telephone call.

POLICEMAN #2

Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink

with your act, but you don't fool us.

BILLINGS

Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you

got any creepy crawlies.

COLE

I need to make a telephone call.

BILLINGS

(pulling Cole's head)

Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.

Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.

COLE

It's very important.

BILLINGS

What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it

easy, relax into things.  We all gonna

get along fine if you just relax.

BILLINGS

Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.

Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV

rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?

JEFFREY

(with a sly look)

How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd

be doing your job.

BILLINGS

Five thousand dollars, my man.  That

enough?  I'll wire it to your account

as usual, okay?

JEFFREY

Okay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's

enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll

give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.

JEFFREY

Kid around, kid around.  It makes them feel

good, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're

the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?

JEFFREY

Here's the games.  Games vegitize you.

If you play the games, you're

voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

JEFFREY

What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How

much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.

COLE

I need to make a telephone call.

JEFFREY

A telephone call?  That's communication

with the outside world!  Doctor's

discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts

could just make phone calls, it could

spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone

cables, oozing into the ears of all those

poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos

everywhere!  A plague of madness.

(suddenly sly and confidential)

In fact, very few of us here are actually

mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're

not mentally ill, for all I know you're

crazy as a loon.  But that's not why

you're here.  Why you're here is because

of the system, because of the economy.

(indicating the TV)

There's the TV.  It's all right there.

Commercials.  We are not productive

anymore, they don't need us to make

things anymore, it's all automated.  What

are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,

buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.

But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you

know what?  You're mentally ill! That's

a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet

paper, new cars, computerized blenders,

electrically operated sexual devices...

(getting hysterical)

SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN

RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH

BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-

ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...

TERRY

Take it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.

JEFFREY

So if you want to watch a particular

program, say "All My Children" or

something, you go to the Charge Nurse

and tell her what day and time the show

you want to see is on.  But you have to

tell her before the show is scheduled

to be on.  There was this one guy who

was always requesting shows that had already

played.  He couldn't quite grasp the

idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't

just make it be yesterday for him, turn

back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!

JEFFREY

Seriously, more and more people are

being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?

Because they're not consuming on their

own.  But as patients, they becone

consumers of mental health care.  And

this gives the so-called sane people work!

(hysteria again)

WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!

HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!

IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE

SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...

TERRY

Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna

get a shot.  I warned you...

JEFFREY

(calming himself, smiling)

Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.

I got "carried away".  Explaining the

workings of...the institution.

TJ WASHINGTON

I don't really come from outer space.

JEFFREY

This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he

doesn't really come from outer space.

TJ WASHINGTON

Don't mock me, my friend.

(to Cole)

It's a condition of "mental divergence".

I find myself on another planet, Ogo,

part of an intellectual elite, preparing

to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.

But even though it's a totally convincing

reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,

hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a

construct of my psyche.  I am mentally

divergent in that I am escaping certain

unnamed realities that plague my life

here.  When I stop going there, I will

be well.  Are you also divergent, friend?

P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)

James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!

JEFFREY

Staff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now the

geniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!

COLE

This is a place for crazy people!  I'm

not crazy!

RESIDENT #1

We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.

COLE

Well, you've got some real nuts in here!

Listen to me, all of you -- I have to

tell you something that's going to be

difficult for you to understand, but...

DR. RAILLY

James...please.  These are all doctors

here and we want to help you.

DR. FLETCHER

Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.

Railly you thought it was...

(checking a file)

1995. ... How about right now?  Do you

know what year it is right now?

COLE

1989.  Look, I'm not confused.  There's been

a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.

COLE

Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

COLE

(drawing)

Do any of you know anything about the

Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint

this, stencil it, on buildings, all

over the place.

DR. CASEY

Mr. Cole...

COLE

Right.  I guess you wouldn't, this is

1989, they're probably not active yet.

That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,

three billion people died in 1995.

Three billion, got that?  Almost

the whole population.  Of the world!

Only about one percent survived.

RESIDENT #2

Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?

COLE

Save you?  How can I save you?  It

already happened!  I can't save you.  I'm

simply trying to get some information for

people in the present so that someday...

(sees their eyes)

You don't believe me.  You think I'm

crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  I'm a convict,

sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as

sane as anyone in this room.  I...

DR. RAILLY

Can you tell us the name of the prison

you've come from?

DR. FLETCHER

Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?

COLE

(recovering, new tack)

No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I

need to do is make a telephone call to

straighten everything out.

DR. FLETCHER

Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would

straighten everything out?

COLE

Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in

to them.  They'll want to know they

sent me to the wrong time.

DR. FLETCHER

So you could talk to these scientists

and they do what?  Send you to the future?

COLE

No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called,

"voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages.

They monitor it from the present.

RESIDENT #2

"From the present."  We're not in the

present now, Mr. Cole?

COLE

No, no.  This is the past.  This has

already happened.  Listen...

RESIDENT #3

Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's

the present, is that it?

COLE

No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...

DR. FLETCHER

These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they

doctors like ourselves?

COLE

No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given

a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.

You have to let me use the phone.  One call!

MOTHER

Yes?

(listens, frowns, then)

Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know

what you're talkin' about. ... Is this

a joke?  I don't know any scientists.

James who?  Never heard of you!

RAILLY

It wasn't who you expected?

COLE

It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.

RAILLY

Perhaps it was a wrong number...

COLE

No.  That's the reason they chose me --

I remember things.

RAILLY

James, where did you grow up?  Was it

around here?  Around Baltimore?

COLE

(lost in thought)

What?

RAILLY

I have the...strangest feeling I've met

you before...a long time ago, perhaps.

Were you ever...?

COLE

Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed

to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's

not the right number yet.  That's the

problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?

RAILLY

James, take these.

(watching him step back)

Please -- I helped you like I said I

would.  Now I want you to trust me.

MR. PONYTAIL

WATCH IT!

WOMAN'S VOICE

NOOOOOOOOOO!

VOICE (o.s.)

It won't work. You can't open it.

JEFFREY

You think you can remove the grill but

you can't.  It's welded.

JEFFREY

See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are

locked, too.  They're protecting the

people on the outside from us.  But the

people outside are as crazy as us.

JEFFREY

You know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is

"majority rules".  Take germs for example.

COLE

Germs?!

JEFFREY

In the 18th century there was no such

thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a

thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along

comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I

think.  He tries to convince people...

other doctors mostly...that there are

these teeny tiny invisible "bad things"

called germs that get into your body and

make you...sick!  He's trying to get

doctors to wash their hands.  What is

this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible

whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!

JEFFREY (cont.)

So cut to the 20th century!  Last week

in fact, right before I got dragged

into this hellhole.  I order a burger

in this fast food joint.  The waiter

drops it on the floor.  He picks it up,

wipes it off, hands it to me...like it

was all okay.

JEFFREY

"What about the germs?"  I say.  He

goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs

are just a plot they made up so they

can sell you disinfectants and soap!"

Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you

believe in germs, don't you?

COLE

I'm not crazy.

JEFFREY

Of course not, I never thought you were.

You want to escape, right?  That's very

sane.  I can help you.  You want me to,

don't you?  Get you out?

COLE

If you know how to escape, why don't you...?

JEFFREY

Why don't I escape, that's what you

were going to ask me, right?  'Cause

I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken

care of, see?  I've sent out word.

COLE

What's that mean?

JEFFREY

I've managed to contact certain underlings,

evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and

assorted minions, who will contact my father.

When he learns I'm in this kind of place,

he'll have them transfer me to one of those

classy joints where they treat you...properly.

LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS!

TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS

FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...

JEFFREY

Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little

agitated.  The thought of escaping

crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly

I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS

BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW

FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING

THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...

JEFFREY

You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient!

I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you

morons find out who I am.  My father's

gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY

FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES!

MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER.

JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)

Torture!  Experiments!  We're all

monkeys

COLE

They hurt you!

JEFFREY

Not as bad as what they're doing to

kitty.

TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)

These video tapes were obtained by

animal rights activists who worked

underground as laboratory assistants

for several months.  Authorities say

there is little they can do until...

COLE

Look at those assholes, they're asking

for it!  Maybe people deserved to be

wiped out!

JEFFREY

(startled, turning)

Wiping cut the human race!  That's a

great idea!  But it's more of a long

term thing -- right now we have to

focus on more immediate goals.

(sudden whisper)

I didn't say a word about "you know

what".

COLE

What are you talking about???

JEFFREY

You know -- your plan.

JEFFREY

What're you writing?  You a reporter?

COLE

(shielding the magazine)

It's private.

JEFFREY

A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?

BILLINGS

Yo, James -- time to take your meds.

NARRATOR (v.o.)

Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine.

Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys!

TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)

We'll return to the Marx Brothers in

"Monkey Business" following these

messages.

JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)

Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business.

JEFFREY

Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk!

(big grin)

Key!

COLE

(groggy)

What....???

JEFFREY

Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.

Major load!  Listen up -- try and get

it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan!

Remember?  I did my part.

COLE

What...???

JEFFREY

Not, "what", babe!  When!

"When???"

JEFFREY

(pressing the key into Cole's hand)

Now!

VOICE/TV (o.s.)

Let us guide you to the stocks and

bonds that will enhance your portfolio.

JEFFREY

YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS!

BILLINGS

(missing a tackle)

God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.

JEFFREY

LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!

PATIENT

Place to go would be...Florida.  The

keys are lovely this tine of year.

PATIENT

Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.

SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Two's not working today.  Use one.

DR. CASEY

This was in my box, but I have a slight

suspicion it wasn't meant for me.

DR. CASEY

"You are the most beautiful woman I have

ever seen.  You live in a beautiful

world.  But you don't know it.  You have

freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."

RAILLY

(smiling)

Cole.  James Cole -- right?

DR. CASEY

"I would do anything to stay here, but

I must leave.  Please, help me."

RAILLY

Poor man...

DR. GOODINS

Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of

yours, right?

DR. GOODINS

He got out.  Took off.  Last seen, he

was up on nine.

INT.  X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY

A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,

while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.

DOCTOR

Just relax -- don't fight it.  We have

to know exactly what's there so we can...

DOCTOR

Eh, excuse me.  Can I help you?

RAILLY

It's just a shot to calm you.

COLE

No more drugs.  Please...

RAILLY

I have to do this, James.  You're very

confused.

DR. FLETCHER

Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't

an inquisition.

RAILLY

I didn't think I was being defensive.

I was just...

DR. FLETCHER

He should have been in restraints.  It

was bad judgment on your part, plain

and simple.  why not just cop to it?

RAILLY

Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have

the strangest feeling about him -- I've

seen him somewhere and...

DR. FLETCHER

(impatient, not interested)

Two policemen were already in the

hospital and now we have an orderly

with a broken arm and a Security

Officer with a fractured skull.

RAILLY

I said it was bad judgment!  What else

do you want me to say?

DR. FLETCHER

You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.

(to Dr. Casey)

Isn't she being defensive, Bob?

BILLINGS

Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...

situation.

DR. FLETCHER

He was in full restraints?  And the

door was locked?

BILLINGS

Yes, sir.  Did it myself.

DR. FLETCHER

And he was fully sedated?

RAILLY

He was fully sedated!

DR. FLETCHER

Then are you trying to tell me that a

fully sedated, fully restrained patient

somehow slipped out that vent, replaced

the grill behind him and that he's wriggling

through the ventilation system right now?

P.A. SYSTEM

Flight 784 to San Francisco now

boarding at Gate 38...

WOMAN'S VOICE

NOOOOOOOOOO!

BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM

The Freedom For Animals Headquarters

now boarding on Second Avenue.  The

Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Cole, you moron -- wake up!

UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM

-- they're the ones who are going to do it...

UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER

I can't do anything more.  The Police

are after me.

ASTROPHYSICIST

Well?

COLE

Uh, what?

ENGINEER

He's drugged out of his mind!  He's

completely zoned out.

ASTROPHYSICIST

Cole, did you or did you not record

that message?

COLE

Uh, that message...me?

MICROBIOLOGIST

It's a digital reconstruction of a

message, Cole, from a weak signal on our

contact number.  Did you make that call?

COLE

(angrily)

I couldn't call!  You sent me to the

wrong year!  It was 1989.

SCIENTISTS

1989!

ZOOLOGIST

You're certain of that?

GEOLOGIST

(before Cole can answer)

What did you do with your time, Cole?

Did you waste it on drugs?  Women?

COLE

They forced me to take drugs.

BOTANIST

Forced you!  Why would someone force

you to take drugs?

COLE

I got into trouble.  I got arrested.

But I still got you a specimen -- a

spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to

put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong

year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.

GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)

Cole!

ENGINEER

What about it, Cole?

ZOOLOGIST

Did you see it?

COLE

Uh, no, sir.  I...

ASTROPHYSICIST

What about these people?  Did you see

any of these people?

COLE (o.s.)

Uh, no, sir, I...wait!

ASTROPHYSICIST

Him?  You saw that man?

COLE

Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.

MICRO3IOLOGIST

(switching on the light)

You were in a mental institution?!

ASTROPHYSICIST

You were sent to make very important

observations!

BOTANIST

You could have made a real contribution.

GEOLOGIST

Helped to reclaim the planet...

ZOOLOGIST

As well as reducing your sentence.

MICROBIOLOGIST

The question is, Cole -- "Do you want

another chance?"

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Hey!  Who's that?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Hey, Bob...what's your name?

COLE

Where are you?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

You can talk!  Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?

Volunteer?

COLE

My name's not "Bob".

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Not a prob, Bob.  Where'd they send you?

COLE

Where are you?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Another cell. ...  Maybe.

COLE

What do you mean, "maybe"?  What's that

supposed to mean?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Maybe.  Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell,

another "volunteer" like you -- or "maybe"

I'm in the Central Office spying on you

for all those science bozos.  Or, hey, "maybe"

I'm not even here.  "Maybe" I'm just in

your head.  No way to confirm anything.

Ha Ha.  Where'd they send you?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Not talking, huh, Bob?  That's okay

I can handle that.

COLE

1989.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

89!  How was it?  Good drugs?  Lotsa

pussy?  Hey, Bob, you do the job?  D'ju

find out the "big info"?...Army of the

Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was

prior to mutation?

COLE

It was supposed to be 1995.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Science isn't an exact science with

these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't

end up in ancient Egypt!

GEOLOGIST

No mistakes this time, Cole.

ASTROPHYSICIST

Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open.

ZOOLOGIST

Good thinking about that spider, Cole.

Try and do something like that again.

MICROBIOLOGIST

Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We

have to know exactly what's there so we

can fix it.

SERGEANT

(FRENCH, subtitled)

Where's your mask?!  And your clothes...

and your weapon, you idiot?!

COLE

What?  What??

SERGEANT

(FRENCH, subtitled)

Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut!

COLE

I don't understand.  Where am I?

CAPTAIN

(GERMAN, subtitled)

How'd you get here, soldier?  What's

your rank?  Where are your clothes?

COLE

I...don't understand.

CAPTAIN

(frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)

German!  Speak German!  What are you

doing here?

VOICE (o.s.)

(pleading in English)

I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em.

Please, you gotta help me!

COLE

JOSE!

JOSE

Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

DR. KATHRYN RAILLY

MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS

MAY 17

RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)

According to the accounts of local

officials at that time, this gentleman,

judged to be about forty years of age,

appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle

near Stonehenge in the West of England in

April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and

speaking in a strange accent, the man made

dire prognostications about a pestilence

which he predicted would wipe out humanity

in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and

hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the

village, was taken into custody, but then

mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.

RAILLY (cont.)

In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons

of great pestilence, men have often

believed the prophecies of crazed

fanatics, that the end of the world was

come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday

scenario is considerably more compelling

when reality supports it in some form,

whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,

or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural"

contagions, there are now technological

horrors as well:  besides radiation,

consider our lurking fear of germ

warfare and its close approximation,

chemical warfare, which first reared

its ugly head in the deadly mustard

gas attacks during the First World War.

RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)

During such an attack in the French

trenches in October, 1917, we have an

account of this soldier...

RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)

-- who, during an assault, was wounded

by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the

lines where Doctors discovered he had

lost all comprehension of French but

spoke English fluently, albeit in a

regional dialect they didn't recognize.

The man, although physically unaffected

by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed

he had come from the future, that he was

looking for a pure germ that would

ultimately wipe mankind off the face of

the earth in the year... 1995!

RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)

Although seriously injured, the young

soldier disappeared from the hospital

before more data could be gathered.  No

doubt, he was trying to carry on his

mission to warn others, substituting

for the agony of war...a self-inflicted

agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".

RAILLY (cont.)

Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,

was condemned to know the future but to be

disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,

the agony of foreknowledge combined with

impotence to do anything about it.

DR. PETERS

I think, Dr. Railly, you have given

your alarmists a bad name.  Surely

there is very real and very convincing

data that the planet cannot survive the

excesses of the human race:  proliferation

of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding

habits, the rape of the environment, the

pollution of land, sea, and air.  In this

context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken

Little" represents the sane vision and

that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go

shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR

Doctor Railly -- please!  I wonder if

you're aware of my own studies which

indicate that certain cycles of the

moon actually impact on the incidence

of apocalyptic predictions as observed

in urban emergency rooms and...

MARILOU

You were great.

RAILLY

You're leaving?

MARILOU

The reservation's at nine thirty --

it's getting late.

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR

Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very

important!

WAYNE CHANG

(checking the professor)

You sure you're gonna be all right?

RAILLY

(smiles, checks her watch)

I'll be there in twenty minutes.

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR

Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand

your exclusion of the moon in relation

to apocalyptic dementia...

MAN'S VOICE

Get in!

MAN'S VOICE

I've got a gun.

RAILLY

You can have my purse.  I have a lot of

cash and credit...

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

Start the car.

RAILLY

Here!  You can have the keys.  You can...

MAN

START THE CAR!  NOW!

MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

I don't want to hurt you.  But I will.

I've hurt people before when...when I

had no choice.  Turn left.

RAILLY

Where... where are we going'

MAN

I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.

RAILLY

(startled, horrified)

But that's... that's more than 200 miles!

MAN

That's why I can't walk there.  Turn

here... I think...

RAILLY

If you make me go with you, it's

kidnapping.  That's a serious crime.

If you let me go, you could just take

the car and...

MAN

I don't know how to drive!  We went

underground when I was nine, I told you

that.  When you come to the corner,

turn right.

RAILLY

Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a

locked room six years ago.

COLE

1989.  Six years for you.  There's the

sign!  Right here!

RAILLY

I can't believe this is a coincidence,

Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

COLE

You told me you'd help me.  I know this

isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...

no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.

I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.

But then I saw your book in a store window

with a notice about your lecture.

(sudden pride)

I can read, remember?

RAILLY

Yes, I remember.

(a beat, then)

Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?

COLE

It's the next step.  I checked out the

Baltimore information, it was nothing.

It's Philadelphia, that's where they

are, the ones who killed everyone.

(pointing suddenly, eagerly)

Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?

COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)

This is a personal message to you.

COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)

Are you at the end of your rope?  Are

you dying to get away?

COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}

The Florida Keys are waiting for you.

COLE

I've never seen the ocean!

RAILLY

It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You

do understand that, don't you?  It's

not really a special message to you.

COLE

You used to call me "James".

RAILLY

You'd prefer that? ... James...you

don't really have a gun, do you.

COLE

(cynical laugh)

Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...

COLE

Can you...can you make it louder?  I

love hearing twentieth century music!

Hearing music and breathing air!

ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)

This just in from Fresno, California:

emergency crews are converging on a

cornfield where playmates of nine year

old Ricky Neuman say they saw him

disappear right before their eyes.

ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)

Young Neuman apparently stepped into an

abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere

in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,

possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim

they heard him cry out faintly but since then

there has been no contact with...

COLE

"Never cry wolf!"

RAILLY

What?

COLE

My father told me that.  "Never cry

wolf."  Then people won't believe you

if...something really happens.

RAILLY

"If something really happens"...like

what, James?

COLE

Something bad.  Is that all the music?

I don't want to hear this stuff...

RAILLY

Did something terrible happen to you when

you were a child?  Something so bad...?

COLE

Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)

"Since I met you, baby,

My whole life has changed...

IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)

"-- cause since I met you, baby.

All I need is you..."

ANSWERING MACHINE

Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych

Admitting.  There was a guy here this

afternoon looking for you.  He seemed

very agitated.  We tried to keep him, but

he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know

this guy.  Then, just a few minutes ago,

it came to me.  It's Cole!  James Cole.

Remember him?  The paranoid who pulled

the Houdini back in '89.  Well, he's

back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking

for you.  I thought you oughta know.

MARILOU MARTIN

It's just as I told you -- my husband

and I had gone ahead -- she never

showed.  That's totally unlike her!

OFFICER TWO

(pulls out his notebook)

Do you happen to know the make of her car?

MARILOU MARTIN

Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that

cat's starving!  She would never neglect

her cat!

FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Son, it's important for your cat to

have the nourishment necessary for

healthy bones and a rich coat.

RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)

Please untie me.  I'm very uncomfortable.

COLE

You were in my dream just now.  Your hair

was different, but I'm sure it was you.

RAILLY

We dream about what's important in our lives.

And I seem to have become pretty important

in yours.  What was the dream about?

COLE

About an airport...before everything

happened.  It's the same dream I always

have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid

in it.

RAILLY

And I was in it?  What did I do?

COLE

You were very upset.  You're always

very upset in the dream, but I never

knew it was you before.

RAILLY

It wasn't me before, James.  It's

become me now because of...what's

happening.  Please untie me.

COLE

No, I think it was always you.  It's

very strange.

RAILLY

You're flushed.  And you were moaning.

I think you're running a fever.  What

are you doing?

COLE

I'll be back in a minute.

RAILLY

No!  Don't leave me here like this!

TV ANCHORMAN

And in Fresno, California...crews

continue to attempt to rescue nine year

old Ricky Neuman.

TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)

The boy was playing ball with four

other children when he literally

disappeared off the face of the earth.

COLE

My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

RAILLY

Clues?  What kind of clues?

COLE

A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve

Monkeys.  I've told you about them.

They spread the virus.  That's why we

have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to

find them -- it's my assignment.

RAILLY

What will you do...when you find

this...secret army?

COLE

I just have to locate the virus in its

original form before it mutates.  So

scientists can come back and study it

and find a cure.  So that those of us

who survived can go back to the surface

of the earth.

COLE

You won't think I'm crazy next month.

People are going to start dying.  At

first the papers will say it's some

weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll

begin to catch on.  They'll get it.

RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)

We interrupt this program with a

special bulletin...

RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)

This report just in from Fresno,

California.  Naval sonar specialists

who were flown to the site...

COLE

I thought it was about us.  I thought

maybe they'd found us and arrested me

or something.

COLE

Just a joke.

RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)

-- an hour ago have been unable to

determine the location of the boy in the

150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who

lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into

the narrow tube claims he heard breathing

sounds coming from approximately seventy

feet down...

RAILLY

Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking

about that little boy in the well?

COLE

When I was a kid I identified with that

kid, down there alone in that pipe...a

hundred feet down -- doesn't know if

they're going to save him.

RAILLY

What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

COLE

Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a

hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn.

Hey, turn left here.  Left!

EVANGELIST

"And the wild beasts of the islands

shall cry in their desolate houses and

dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and

her time is near to come, and her days

shall not be prolonged."

COLE

Where I come from we think of this as Eden.

If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown

food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut

know what they have.  They don't see the

sky.  They don't feel the air!

COLE (o.s.)

And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug

they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP!

COLE

The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here.

(looks around)

Somewhere.  Come on!

COLE

Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything,

I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

RAILLY

I'm not going to "do" anything, I

promise.  But you need help, James.

None of this is what you think it is.

RASPY VOICE (o.s)

You can't hide from them, Bob.

LOUIE

No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.

(conspiratorially)

They hear everything.  They got that

tracking device on you.  They can find

you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha!

LOUIE

(touches his back jaw)

In the tooth, Bob!  Right?

(sudden triumphant grin)

But I fooled 'em, old buddy!

COLE

They're keeping an eye on me.

RAILLY

Who's keeping an eye on you?

COLE

The man...with the voice.  I recognized

him.  He's from the present.  He...

RAILLY

James, no -- we shouldn't be here!

RAILLY

James!  We have to go back.  Those men...

FIRST THUG

Hey, buddy.

SECOND THUG

Stick around, bitch.

COLE

Please!  Please don't hurt me!

COLE

Are you hurt?

RAILLY

Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...

RAILLY

Is he...alive?

COLE

Come an.  We're running out of time.

You can't help him.

RAILLY

Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!

COLE

I did him a favor.  Now come on.

RAILLY

You didn't have a gun before, did you?

COLE

I've got one now.

EVANGELIST

You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you?

FALE

Uh, can we help you?

FALE

Excuse me.  You looking for something

in particular?

RAILLY

It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.

COLE

I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the

Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

TEDDY

We don't know anything about any "Army

of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't

you and your friend disappear, okay?

COLE

I just need some information...

TEDDY

Didn't you hear me?  We're not...

RAILLY

James, no -- don't hurt them.

(to the activists)

Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do

whatever he tells you to do.  He's...

upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's

dangerous -- just cooperate.

FALE

What do you want -- money?  We only

have a few bucks.

COLE

I told you what I want.

(snaps at Railly)

Lock the door!

RAILLY

James, why don't we...?

COLE

Lock it now!

BEN

I told you that fuckhead Mason would

get us into something like this.

FALE

Shut up!

COLE

Mason???

RAILLY

Jeffrey Mason?

BEN

Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.

FALE

Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big

star -- the media latch on to him

because he's picketing his own father,

a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist".

You musta seen all that on TV.

COLE

No, I don't watch TV.

COLE

Is this him -- Dr. Mason?

FALE

That's him.

BEN

(very frightened)

What are you going to do with us?

COLE

(stares at the photo, then)

Tell me more about Jeffrey.

FALE

(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)

Jeffrey started getting bored with the

shit we do...picketing, leafleting,

letter-writing stuff.  He said we were,

"ineffectual liberal jerkoffs".  He

wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to

"educate" the public.

FALE

Yeah, that's when he let a hundred

snakes loose in the Senate.

TEDDY

But we weren't into that kind of stuff.

It's counter productive, we told him.

FALE

So he and eleven others split off and

became this underground..."army"

COLE

The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.

BEN

They started planning a "Human Hunt".

TEDDY

They bought stun guns and nets and bear

traps.  They were gonna go to Wall

Street and trap lawyers and bankers...

BEN

But they didn't do it.  They didn't do

any of it.

TEDDY

Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot

sold his friends out!

COLE

What's that mean?

FALE

He goes on TV, gives a news conference,

tells the whole world he just realized

his daddy's experiments are vital for

humanity and that the use of animals is

absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey

Mason, from now on, is going to personally

supervise the labs to make sure all the

little animals aren't going to suffer.

COLE

(holding up a rolodex)

What's this?

RAILLY (v.o.)

You can't just barge in on a famous

scientist.  They'll have security guards,

gates, alarm systems.  It's insane, James.

RAILLY

If those young men don't get loose,

they could die in that basement.

COLE

All I see are dead people.  Everywhere.

What's three more?

RAILLY

(a beat, carefully, a new tack)

You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey

Mason, don't you, James?  You met him

in the County Hospital six years ago.

COLE

The guy was a total fruitcake.

RAILLY

And he told you then his father was a

famous virologist.

COLE

No -- he said his father was "God"!

RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)

This just in:  police are widening

their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,

prominent psychiatrist and author.

Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has

been abducted by escaped mental patient,

James Cole. The two are believed to be

traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,

license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.

RAILLY

This can't go on, James.  You're not

well.  You're burning with fever.

COLE

We need gas.

RAILLY

I thought you didn't know how to drive.

COLE

I said I was too young to drive.  I

didn't say I was stupid.

RAILLY

What's the matter with your leg?

COLE

I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas

station up ahead.

RAILLY

Shot!  Who shot you?

COLE

It was some kind of...war.  Never mind,

you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.

COLE

You were going to run out off gas on

purpose, weren't you?

RAILLY

No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James --

It'll go much better for you if you do

-- but I'm not going to trick you.

COLE

(sees the credit card)

That has your name on it.  Give him cash.

COLE

Where are you going?

RAILLY

You can come with me.  I have to get

some things.  Scissors, bandages, some

alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look

at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)

Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining

engineers continue their desperate

attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the

ant in which nine year old...

RAILLY

You shouldn't put your weight on it.

You need stitches and antibiotics.

Lucky for you it was near the surface.

COLE

I love seeing the sun.

RAILLY

Wait -- let me help you.

COLE

(leans closer, shuts his eyes)

You smell so good.

RAILLY

(trying to concentrate)

You have to give yourself up, you know.

COLE

I have to do something now.  Something

I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry.

COLE

I have a mission.  It's important.

FIRST AGENT

They find him?

SECOND AGENT

Who??

FIRST AGENT

That kid.  The one in the pipe.

SECOND AGENT

You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey

down there with a miniature infra-red camera

strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich

wrapped in tinfoil.

FIRST AGENT

You're making that up!

SECOND AGENT (o.s.)

I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!

A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who

thought that one up.

FIRST AGENT (o.s.)

Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel

Prize!

DR. MASON

Would that I could enjoy this opulent

dinner and this excellent and

stimulating company for itself, with no

sense of purpose.  But alas, I am

"burdened" with the sense that with all

this excess of public attention and

this cacophony of praise, there comes

great responsibility.  Indeed, I

practically feel a soapbox growing

under my feet whenever I stand for more

than a few seconds.

DR. MASON (o.s.)

The dangers of science are a time worn

threat, from Prometheus stealing fire

from the Gods to the Cold War era of

the Dr. Strangelove Terror.

DR. MASON (cont.)

But never before, not even at Los Alamos

when the scientists made bets on whether

their first atomic bomb test would wipe out

New Mexico, has science given us so much

reason to fear the power we have at hand.

JEFFREY

What are you talking about?  What

friend?  I'm not expecting anyone.

DR. MASON

Current genetic engineering as well as

my own work with viruses has presented

us with powers as terrifying as any...

JEFFREY

This is ridiculous.  My father is

making a major address.

AGENT #3

Normally if we caught a guy sneaking

around like this with no I.D., we'd

bust his ass, excuse the French, but

this one said he knows you...

(smirk, smirk)

-- and, since you seem to have had

some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates",

we certainly didn't want to arrest one

of your, uh, closest...pals.

JEFFREY

(dismissing Cole casually)

Never saw him before in my life.  Go

ahead and shoot him or torture him or

whatever it is you do.

COLE

(rising)

You do know me.  You helped me once.

JEFFREY

(turning to leave)

That would be totally out of character.

Helping people is against my principles.

(to the Agents)

See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now,

I'm going to go back and listen to my

father's very eloquent discourse on the

perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS

INTRUDER TO DEATH.

COLE

I'm here about some monkeys.

JEFFREY

Excuse me -- what did you say?

COLE

Monkeys.  Twelve of them.

JEFFREY

Arnold...Arnold.

JEFFREY

(stepping back)

My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?

You look like shit

AGENT #3

(dubious)

You know this man?

JEFFREY

Of course I know him.  What do you

think -- I act like this to strangers?

Listen -- you fellas are terrific.  I

thought you were pulling a number on

me.  What a terrible thing if you'd

thrown old Arnie out.  I owe you guys

the big apologia!  Mea culpa, fellas.

(turning to Cole)

Christ, Arnie, it's black tie!  I mean,

I said, "drop by," but, like, this is

Dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret

service, and...and everything.

AGENT #4

"Arnie?"

JEFFREY

Arnold Pettibone.  Old Arnie Pettibone.

Used to be my best friend.  Still is.

What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?

No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?

Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.

Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.

AGENT #4

These people -- all of 'em -- are true

weirdoes!

AGENT #3

(moving to the phone)

I'm gonna call in a description of this

"Pettibone" character.  You go keep an

eye on him.  Make sure he doesn't do

one of the guests with a fork.

JEFFREY

Hey, nice ta see ya.  Lookin' good!  Hi,

there.  Yes, it has been a long time.

JEFFREY

(whispers to Cole)

County Hospital, right?  1989.  The

"Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?

(smiling to guests)

Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.

COLE

Listen to me -- I can't do anything

about what you're going to do. I can't

change anything.  I can't stop you.  I

just want some information...

JEFFREY

We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.

(to a guest)

I am a new person!  I'm completely

adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.

(whispers to Cole)

Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?

COLE

I just need to have access to the pure

virus, that's all!  For the future!

JEFFREY

Come on, follow me.  You don't lock so good.

COLE

I don't have time to go upstairs.  The

police are looking for me.  I need to

know where it is and exactly what it is.

JEFFREY

(brightening suddenly)

I get it!  This is your old plan, right?

COLE

Plan?  What are you talking about?

JEFFREY

Remember?  We were in the dayroom,

watching TV, and you were all upset

about the...desecration of the planet.

And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be

great if there was a germ or a virus

that could wipe out mankind and leave

the plants and animals just as they

are?"  You do remember that, don't you?

COLE

Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!

JEFFREY

And that's when I told you my father was

this famous virologist and you said, "Hey,

he could make a germ and we could steal it!"

COLE

(grabbing Jeffrey)

Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates

We live underground!  The world belongs

to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're

like moles or worms.  All we want to do

is study the original...

AGENT #4'S VOICE

Okay -- take it easy.  We know who you

are, Mr. Cole.

AGENT #4

Let's go somewhere and talk this thing

over. Okay? Just come with me...

JEFFREY

You're right!  Absolutely right.  Me's

a nut case, totally deranged.  Delusional!

Paranoid.  HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED

UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.

JEFFREY

YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE

TWELVE MONKEYS"?  IT'S A COLLECTION OF

NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.

SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN

FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE

RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF

INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR

GRAND PLOT!

AGENT #3

Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.

Everything's...

JEFFREY

MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT

THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH

VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE

"PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH

YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND

LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE

"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES

SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY

CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU

KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???

AGENT #4

Did a man just come through here...limping?

TV REPORTER (v.o.)

These pictures we are seeing are coming

to us live from deep inside the pipe.

You can just make out the metal wall

behind those roots and I guess those

must be spider webs.

MRS. McCANN

Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey

is going to eat the sandwich himself.

TV ANCHOR (v.o.)

This just in:  Police say that the body of

a woman found strangled in the Knutson state

Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.

TV ANCHOR (v.o.)

Earlier in the day, police located

Railly's abandoned car not far from a

building where three animal rights

activists were found bound and gagged...

AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)

COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING

TO HURT YOU.

COLE

LIGHTS!  LIGHTS!

RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)

---when they pulled the monkey out, it

was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped

sandwich.

PILOT

There!  He's showing lights.

RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)

We don't know what to think.  They

didn't locate him and they don't know

how much longer he can last, that's

assuming the boy is still alive.

PILOT

Goddamnit!  Where is he?

CO-PILOT

There!  Over there.

PILOT

Where?

CO-PILOT

Eight o'clock!  He was right there.

PILOT

He musta turned his lights of if.

CO-PILOT

Couldn't drive down there without

lights.  We just can't see 'em.

PILOT

Maybe he's not driving!

POLICE OFFICER

He's not in here.

RAILLY

You bastard!  You total bastard!

RAILLY

I could have died in there.  If something

had happened to you I would have died.

COLE

I...I...I'm really sorry.

RAILLY

What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?

COLE

(getting to his feet)

No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car

and they chased me.  I hit a tree.

RAILLY

See -- you can drive after all!

COLE

Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry

I locked you up.  I thought...I thought...

I think maybe I am crazy!

RAILLY

What made you think that?

COLE

Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about

the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't

sure.  We talked when I was in the

institution, and it was all...fuzzy.

The drugs and stuff.

(horrified)

You think maybe I'm the one who wiped

out the human race?  It was my idea?

RAILLY

Nobody is going to wipe out the human

race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody

else.  You've created something in your

mind, James -- a substitute reality.

In order to avoid something you don't

want to face.

COLE

I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would

love to believe that.

RAILLY

It can be dealt with, but only if you

want to.  I can help you.

COLE

I need help all right.  They're coming

after me.

RAILLY

First, it's important that you

surrender to them instead of them

catching you running.  Okay?

COLE

(brightening)

It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm

wrong about everything...the world will be

okay.  I'll never have to live underground.

RAILLY

Give me the gun.

COLE

The gun! ... I lost it

RAILLY

You're sure?

COLE

(showing her)

No gun!

(looking up)

Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!

RAILLY

I'm going to attract their attention,

let them know where we are, okay?

RAILLY

(calling out)

They'll tell you to put your hands on top

of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're

going to get better, James -- I know it!

COLE

I love this world!

RAILLY

Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll

stay with you.  I won't let them...

RAILLY

Then I said something to him about

cooperating and he said he would do

that, so I got in the car and started

honking the horn.  When I got out, he

was gone.

LIEUTENANT HALPERIN

You lucked out.  For a while we thought

you were a body they found down state...

mutilated.

RAILLY

He wouldn't do something like that -- he...

LIEUTENANT RALPERIN

(interrupts, hands her the photo)

This the man he attacked?

RAILLY

I'd like to be clear about this.  That

man and the other one were..."severely"

beating us.  James Cole didn't start

it.  In fact -- he saved me!

LIEUTENANT RALPERIN

Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can

explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist

-- why do kidnap victims almost always

try to tell us about the guys who grabbed

'em and try to make us understand how

kind these bastards really were?

RAILLY

(as if reciting)

It's a normal reaction to a life-

threatening situation.

(suddenly animated)

He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the

future.  He's been living in a carefully

constructed fantasy world and that world

is starting to disintegrate.  He needs

help!

ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (O.S.)

Wake up! Wake up!

GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)

I think we gave him too much.

MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)

WAKE UP, PRISONER!

ASTROPHYSICIST

Come on, Cole, cooperate!

GEOLOGIST

Spit it out... you went to the home of

a famous virologist...

COLE

(weakly)

You...don't...exist!  You're in

my mind...

SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)

What?  What's that?  What did he say?  His

brain's fried.  Give him another shot!

SPEAK UP, COLE.  WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?

TV REPORTER (v.o.)

The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but

apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal

as she left the police station in

Philadelphia this morning.  So far she

has refused to make a public statement.

WAYNE

Sorry.

RAILLY

No -- I'm in a state of hyper-

alertness.  I can't sleep.

MARILOU

Did you take the sedative?

RAILLY

I hate those things.  They mess my head

up.

TV REPORTER (v.o.)

Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore

woman, James Cole is now also wanted in

connection with the brutal slaying of

Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...

RAILLY (o.s.)

Do they really expect him to come here?

TV REPORTER on air

And in Fresno, California...

RAILLY

(glances sadly toward the TV)

He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?

WAYNE

He's fine.  It was just a "prank" he

and his friends pulled.

TV REPORTER (v.o.)

Authorities have so far been noncommittal

about whether they will try to file

charges against the families of the

children involved in the hoax.

SCIENTISTS

---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...

SCIENTISTS

Well done, James!  Well done!  Nice

going!  Congratulations!  Good for you!

BOTANIST

During your "interview," while you

were..."under the influence," you told

us you liked music!

ZOOLOGIST

This isn't the prison, James.

BOTANIST

This is a hospital.

ASTROPHYSICIST

But just until you recover your,

uh,... equilibrium.

ENGINEER

You're still a little... disoriented.

GEOLOGIST

Stress!  Time travel!

ASTROPHYSICIST

You stood up very well, considering...

GEOLOGIST

Superior work!  Superior!

BOTANIST

You connected the Army of the 12

Monkeys to a world famous virologist

and his son...

MICROBIOLOGIST

Others will take over now...

ZOOLOGIST

We'll be back on the surface in a

matter of months....

GEOLOGIST

We'll retake the planet.

ASTROPHYSICIST

We're very close!  Because of you!

ENGINEER

(unrolling a document)

This is it, James...what you've been

working for.

BOTANIST

A full pardon!

MICROBIOLOGIST

You'll be out of here in no time.

ASTROPHYSICIST

Women will want to get to know you...

COLE

I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU

BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!

ASTROPHYSICIST

(sympathetically)

Of course you want to be well, James.

And you will be...soon.

COLE

YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!

YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T

TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE.

MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN'T TRICK ME!

YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND

YOU'RE MY INSANITY!

RAILLY

He not only used the word "prank" -- he

said the boy was hiding in a barn.

DR. FLETCHER

He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him

murder someone.  You knew there was a real

possibility he would kill you, too.  You

were under tremendous emotional stress.

RAILLY

For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he

knew about the boy in Fresno and he says

three billion people are going to die!

DR. FLETCHER

Kathryn, you know he can't possibly

know that.  You're a rational person.

You're a trained psychiatrist.  You

know the difference between what's real

and what's not.

RAILLY

And what we believe is what's accepted as

"truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry --

it's the latest religion.  And we're the

priests -- we decide what's right and what's

wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...

I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

You sure fucked up, Bob!

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

But I can understand you don't want

your mistakes pointed out to you. I can

relate to that, old Bob.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're

thinking I don't exist except in your

head.  I can see that point of view.  But

you could still talk to me, couldn't you?

Carry on a decent conversation?

COLE

(blurting)

I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world!

You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?

They don't like that.  That's a no-no.

And when did you say you saw me?

In...1872?

COLE

FUCK YOU!

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Yelling won't get you what you want.  You

have to be smart to get what you want.

COLE

Oh, yeah?  What do I want?

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

You don't know what you want?  Sure you

do, Bob.  You know what you want.

COLE

Tell me.  Tell me what I want.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to

be topside -- breathe the air -- to be

with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't

that what you want?

COLE

More...than...anything.

LIEUTENANT HALPERIN

Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..

Sorry to call so early but...

RAILLY

You found him?  Is he all right?

LIEUTENANT HALPERIN

Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your

good friend, the kidnapper.  However,

the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic

report on my desk that says the bullet

you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's

thigh is an antique...and all indications

are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.

LIEUTENANT RALPERIN

So what I was thinking was, maybe if I

sent a detective down there to talk

with you, you could maybe revise or

amplify on the circumstances....

Hello?  Hello?  Dr. Railly?

RAILLY

No!

ASTROPHYSICIST

The food, the sky, the certain, uh,

sexual temptations -- you haven't

become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To

that "dying" world'

COLE

No, sir!  I just want to do my part.

To get us back on top...in charge of

the planet.  And I have the experience,

I know who the people are...

BIOLOGIST

He really is the most qualified...

GEOLOGIST

But all that..."behavior"...

ASTROPHYSICIST

(to Cole, a little hurt)

You said we weren't "real," Cole...

COLE

Well, sir, I don't think the human mind

was built to exist in two different...

whatever you call it..."dimensions."

It's stressful, you said it yourselves,

it gets you confused.  You don't know

what's real and what's not.

MICROBIOLOGIST

But you know what's real now?

COLE

Yes, sir.

GEOLOGIST

He'd have to bone up, catch up to our

research, the latest clues...

ZOOLOGIST

He's proved to be a quick study...

ASTROPHYSICIST

You can't trick us, you know.  It

wouldn't work.

BIOLOGIST

And why would you want to?  It'll be

dangerously close to the end.

COLE

I understand.  There'd be no point.

ASTROPHYSICIST

We're going to think about it, Cole.

Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.

DR. MASON

You have reason to believe that my son

may be planning to do what?!!!

RAILLY

Please, I know it sounds insane but...

DR. MASON

(into the phone)

I'm afraid this doesn't seem very

professional to me, in fact it's

distressingly unprofessional for some-

one who treated my son briefly (if

indeed you actually are who you say you

are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest

in his mental health six years later,

and to telephone a parent to express

opinions that would be inappropriate...

(breaks off, listens, then)

I don't know anything about "Monkey

armies", Doctor.  Nothing whatsoever.

If my son ever was involved in...

(listens, then,)

It would be doubly inappropriate to

discuss matters of security with you,

Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at

ease, neither my son nor any other

unauthorized person has access to any

potentially dangerous organisms in this

laboratory.  Thank you for your concern.

DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)

Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????

DR. MASON

The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by

that man who broke into my house.  She

seems to have been suddenly struck by

the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.

DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)

I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic

visions.

DR. PETERS (cont.)

Has she succumbed to her own

theoretical..."disease"?

DR. MASON

Given the nature of our work, we can't ever

be careful enough.  I think we should review

our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.

BOTANIST

Let's consider again our current

information -- if the symptoms were

first detected in Philadelphia on June

28, 1995, that makes us know that...?

COLE

It was released in Philadelphia,

probably on June 14, 1995.

BOTANIST

And it appeared sequentially after that

in...?

COLE

San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de

Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,

Bangkok, then Peking.

BOTANIST

Meaning...???

COLE

That the virus was taken from Philadelphia

to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,

Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,

Bangkok, then Peking.

BOTANIST

And your only goal is...???

COLE

To find out where the virus is so a

qualified scientist can travel back into

the past and study the original virus.

BOTANIST

So that...???

COLE

Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed

that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim

the surface of the earth.

BOTANIST (o.s.)

This is from a magazine printed in late

September, 1995.  The writer speculated

that this graffiti might be related to

the epidemic that by that time had

already killed thirty million people

world-wide and was getting worse.  He

says, certain people, unnamed, were

questioned, but what came of that is not

known.  But it is a clue you should pursue.

RAILLY

IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS

SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE,

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

FALE

It's the kidnap woman -- the one who

was with the guy who tied us up.

BEN

What's she doing?

FALE

She's drawing attention to us, that's

what she's doing. ... I don't know what

you're up to this time, Mason, but

you're gonna get us in deep shit!

JEFFREY

Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie

talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies.

RAILLY

I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I

KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

RASPY VOICE (o.s)

Secret experiments!

LOUIE

That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!

RAILLY

You!  I know you!

LOUIE

Not just on them.  Do 'em on people,

too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em

chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.

RAILLY

Have you seen James Cole?  The man...?

LOUIE

They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures.

RAILLY

The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to

talk to James, but he has to be careful

how he contacts me.  He mustn't get

caught.  Do you understand me?

LOUIS

Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James?

RAILLY

He was with me, he spoke to you.

Several weeks ago.  He said you were

from the future...watching him.

JEFFREY

You get the bolt cutters?

KWESKIN

One dozen.  They're in the van.

FALE

One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you

gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?

JEFFREY

(grins)

You really want to know?

FALE

No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

BEN

Hey!  Do you know what she's doing?

TEDDY

What's it say?

BEN

I can't see it.

JEFFREY

(erupting)

WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN

PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT

HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.

FALE

(spinning around)

Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say,

"your psychiatrist"?

JEFFREY

Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about

flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

FALE

That woman is...was...your...

psychiatrist?  And now she's spray-

painting our building?

COLE

Kathryn!

RAILLY

James!

RAILLY

James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend

you don't know me.  If he sees you...

COLE

(turning, looking)

No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?

(placing his hands on his head)

Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm

not crazy any more!  I mean, I am

crazy, mentally divergent, actually,

but I know it now and I want you to

help me.  I want to get well...

RAILLY

James -- put your hands down and listen

to me.  Things have changed!

RAILLY

James, come on!  We have to get out of here!

ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!

IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE

SOURCE?  THREE BILLION DIE?

COLE

I've seen that...before.

RAILLY

James, trust me.  We're in terrible

trouble.  We have to run.

BEN

Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her

and some other guy I can't see.

FALE

Hey, no problem, it's probably just

another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's

shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.

(indicating Jeffrey to the others)

This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic

who told his former psychiatrist all his

plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible

schemes, and now who knows what she's

painted out there on our wall?

JEFFREY

WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON

WALLS?

(moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)

You think I told her about the Army of

the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why,

you pathetically ineffectual and

pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to-

animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because

when I had anything to do with her six

years ago, there was no such thing -- I

hadn't even thought of it yet!

FALE

(triumphant)

Then how come she knows what's going on?

JEFFREY

Here's my theory on that.  While I was

institutionalized, my brain was studied

exhaustively in the guise of mental health.

I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied

thoroughly.  Then, everything about me

was entered into a computer where they

created a model of my mind.

JEFFREY (cont.)

Then, using the computer model, they

generated every thought I could possibly

have in the next, say ten years, which

they then filtered through a probability

matrix to determine everything I was

going to do in that period.  So you

see, she knew I was going to lead the

Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the

pages of history before it ever even

occurred to me.  She knows everything

I'm ever going to do before I know it

myself.  How about that?

JEFFREY

Now I have to get going -- do my part.

You guys check all this stuff out and

load up the van.  Make sure you have

everything.  I'm outta here.

FALE

He's seriously crazy -- you know that.

RAILLY

James!  Come on.

COLE

I don't understand what we're doing.

RAILLY

(climbing out of the dumpster)

We're avoiding the police until I

can....talk to you.

COLE

(climbing out after her)

You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn,

those words on the wall -- I've seen

them before...  I...I...dreamed them.

DESK CLERK

Twenty five bucks an hour.

RAILLY

An hour?!

DESK CLERK

You want quarter hours, go someplace else.

RAILLY

(catches on, pulls out her last bills)

Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal?

DESK CLERK

Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right.

Elevator's busted.

DESK CLERK

Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe.

You know if Wallace has a new girl?

Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde?

RAILLY

Okay...you were standing there looking

at the moon...you were eating grass...

then what?

COLE

I thought I was in...prison again.

RAILLY

Just like that?  You were in prison?

COLE

No, not really.  It's...it's in my

mind.  Like you said.

RAILLY

You disappeared!  One minute you were

there, the next minute you were gone.

Did you run through the woods?

COLE

I don't know -- I don't remember.

RAILLY

The boy in the well.  How did you know

that was just a hoax?

COLE

It was?  I didn't...know.

RAILLY

James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

COLE

I think I saw a TV show like that when

I was a kid.  Where a boy...

RAILLY

IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!

COLE

Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV

show and copied it.  Listen, you were

right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally

ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know

they're not real, I can trick them, make

them do what I want.  I just worked on

them in my head and I got back here.  I

can get better.  I can stay here.

RAILLY

What does this mean to you?

COLE

...I had a dream about...something

like that.

RAILLY

You had a bullet from World War One in

your leg, James!  How did it get there?

COLE

You said I had delusions -- that I

created a world -- you said you could

explain everything...

RAILLY

Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying

to.  I can't believe that everything we

do or say has already happened, that we

can't change what's going to happen,

that I'm one of the three billion

people who are going to die...soon.

COLE

I want to be here.  In this time.  With

you.  I want to become...become a whole

person.  I want this to be the present.

I want the future to be unknown.

RAILLY

(sudden hopeful idea!)

James...do you remember...six years

ago...you had a phone number!  You

tried to call and...

WALLACE

This is my territory, bitch!

COLE

(confused, turns to Railly)

Is this real -- or is this one of my

delusions?

RAILLY

This is definitely real:

(to Wallace)

Excuse me, I think we have a little

misunderstanding here...

WALLACE

What're you -- some kind of tough guy?

You wanna be a hero?  You gonna try and

mess with me?  Come on...

WALLACE

Now that's a smart boy.  But you,

honey, you think you can go 'round

me and peddle your fancy ass in this

part of town, you bet your life we got

what I would call a major goddamn

misunderstandin'.

RAILLY

JAMES -- DON'T!

WALLACE

(eyes bulging)

You...heard...her.  Don't do it, man.

RAILLY

(gets up, looks around)

Put him in the closet, ... But get his

money first.

COLE

(amazed)

You want me to rob him?

RAILLY

I...I...We need cash, James.

SHOUTS (o.s.)

They're killing him!  Call the cops.

WALLACE

You two are crazy.  I got friends.  You

put me in a closet, they're gonna be

really pissed.

his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.

RAILLY

James, no!

RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)

(rattling the door knob)

James, what are you doing?

WALLACE

I have friends, man -- if you cut me...

WALLACE

What...the...fuck..are you doing???

RAILLY

Oh, my God, James.  Did you kill him?

COLE

Just...just in case.  In case I'm not

crazy...

(holds up two bloody molars)

That's how they find us.  By our teeth.

(a beat, eye contact)

I don't want them to find me.  Ever.  I

don't want to go back.

RAILLY

Push it tight!

WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)

NO PROBLEM!  I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!

DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

PLAINCLOTHES COP

POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND

COME OUTTA THERE!

WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)

HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT

VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A

COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!

RAILLY

Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone

number.  Let's hope it's nothing!

RAILLY

James!  James!  It's okay.  We're

insane!  We're crazy!

RAILLY

It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...

COLE

A Carpet Cleaning Company?

RAILLY

(laughing)

No superiors!  No scientists.  No

people from the future.  It's just a

Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have

voice mail -- you leave a message

telling them when you want your carpet

cleaned.

COLE

You... you left them a message?

RAILLY

(impishly)

I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved.

Wait'll they hear this nutty woman

telling them...they better watch out

for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

COLE

"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --

they're the ones who are going to do

it.  I can't do anything more.  The

police are watching me."

RAILLY

You... you couldn't have heard me.

COLE

They got your message, Kathryn.  They

played it for me.  It was a bad

recording...distorted.  I didn't

recognize your voice.

RAILLY

Come on.

RAILLY

And this.

(turning)

Anything else?

RAILLY

I guess that's it.

CLERK

Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?

RAILLY

(producing Wallace's roll of bills)

No -- I'll pay cash.

RAILLY

What floor are the wigs on, please?

KWESKIN

So then he goes into this incredible riff

about how his shrink, like, replicated

his brain while he was in the nut house.

Turned it into a computer.

WELLER

And Fale believed it?

KWESKIN

Oh, you know Fale!  He's like, "If you

guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --

I never saw you before in nay life!"

JEFFREY

Let's do it!

JEFFREY

Okay, that's Stage One.  In Stage Two,

Monkey Four is over here...

GOINES

What's the harm in opening the bag?

His eyes are taped.

SANDY

Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.

JEFFREY

Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.

ICHIOKA

So why should we be like him?

JEFFREY

Want the full effect?

DR. MASON

Jeffrey?  I know it's you, Jeffrey.  I

recognize your voice.

DR. MASON

JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You're out

of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all

about your insane plan.  That woman --

your psychiatrist -- she told me.

DR. MASON

I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy

even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps

to make sure you couldn't do it.  I took myself

out of the loop!  I don't have the code any

more.  I don't have access to the virus.  So,

go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract

anything of use to yourself.

JEFFREY

What...virus?

DR. MASON

(spins his head toward Jeffrey)

She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew

you were going to try this.

JEFFREY

What virus are we talking about, Dad?

DR. MASON

You're insane, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

You "develop" viruses and you're calling

me insane?  Typical.  What does this

virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick

fuck, it doesn't matter.

(to the others)

Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I

put helpless animals in cages and measure

their reactions to electrical stimuli?

Do I inject radioactive substances into

living creatures and examine their

bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!

DR. MASON

Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly

are you going to do?  I don't have to

tell you I'm afraid.

JEFFREY

THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE

OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.

GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS

HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED

FUCKING MANIAC?

SCOTTY (up on the screen)

Here's a cross section of one of the

old trees that's been cut down.

MADELINE (up on the screen)

Somewhere in here I was born.  And here

-- I die.  There's only a moment for

you.  You don't notice.

RAILLY

Here, let me help you.

COLE

I think I've seen this movie before.

When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

RAILLY

(fussing with his upper lip)

Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

COLE

(moving his head to see the film)

I have seen it, but I don't remember

this part.  Funny, it's like what's

happening to us, like the past.  The

movie never changes -- it can't change

-- but everytime you see it, it seems

to be different because you're different

-- you notice different things.

RAILLY

If we can't change anything...because

it's already happened, then we ought to

at least smell the flowers.

COLE

Flowers!  What flowers?

RAILLY

(whispering)

It's an expression.  Here...

COLE

Why are we doing this?

RAILLY

So we can stick our heads out the

window and feel the wind and listen to

the music.  So we can appreciate what

we have while we have it.  Forgive me,

psychiatrists don't cry.

COLE

But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're

wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.

RAILLY

In a few weeks, it will have started or

it won't.  If there are still baseball

games and traffic jams, armed robberies

and boring TV shows -- we'll be so

happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves

in to the police.

SHADOWY MOVIEGOER

SHHHHHHH

COLE

(whispers)

Where can we hide for a few weeks?

RAILLY

You said you'd never seen the ocean...

DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)

What are you doing to me?  Where are

we?  Jeffrey, please...

SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)

For God's sake, put the tape back on

his mouth!

JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)

Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than

he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?

COLE

Kathryn?!

BRUNETTE

We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.

COLE

You were in my dream just now.  I

didn't recognize you.

RAILLY

Well, you look pretty different, too.

COLE

I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize

it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I

thought you were gone.

RAILLY

(studies him seriously)

I remember you...like this.  I feel

I've known you before.  I feel I've

always known you.

WOMAN CABBlE

What time's your flight, friends?

RAILLY

Nine thirty

WOMAN CABBIE

Might be tight.

RAILLY

(startled, checks her watch)

Tight?  My watch says 7:30.

WOMAN CABBIE

On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a

time, but today, gotta take inta account

your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.

RAILLY

What?  What did you say?

WOMAN CABBIE

Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks

didn't turn on your radio this morning.

WOMAN CABBIE

Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta

the zoo last night.  Then they locked up

this big shot scientist in one of the cages.

Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!

WOMAN CABBlE

Now they got animals all over the

place.  Buncha zebras shut down the

thruway 'bout an hour ago and some

kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got

traffic blocked for miles over on 22.

RAILLY

That's what they were up to!  Freeing

animals!

COLE

On the walls -- they meant the animals

when they said, "We did it."

WOMAN CABBIE

You can hear it on the radio all the

stations...

ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)

In the meantime, numerous animal rights

activists have joined the chorus

condemning what they're calling the

"loose canon" activities of Jeffrey

Mason and his Army of the Twelve

Monkeys.

RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)

Can these fools seriously believe that

releasing a captive animal into an

urban environment is being compassionate

to the animal?  It's mindlessly cruel,

almost as indefensible as holding the

animal in captivity in the first place.

RAILLY

Maybe it's going to be okay.

DETECTIVE

Tell your people if they spot either

one of them, not to try and apprehend

then.  They should notify us and...

P.A. SYSTEM

-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready

for boarding at Gate Seventeen.

COLE

I know this place! ... This is my dream.

RAILLY

Airports all look the same.  Maybe

it's...

(turning, reacting)

James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.

COLE

It's not just my dream.  I was actually

here!  I remember now.  My parents

brought me to meet my uncle.  About a

week or two before...before...before

everybody started dying.

RAILLY

They may be looking for us, James.

(placing the tube in his hand)

Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.

COLE

(confounded)

I was here...as a kid.  I think you

were here, too.  But you...looked just

like you look now.

RAILLY

(getting desperate)

James, if we're identified, they're

going to send us someplace...but not to

Key West!

COLE

(snaps out of it, hand to moustache)

Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.

RAILLY

(indicating a sign)

I'll get the tickets and meet you... in

the Gift Shop.

RAILLY

Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for

Key West.

COLE

Listen, I don't know whether you're

there or not.  Maybe you just clean

carpets.  If you do, you're lucky --

you're gonna live a long, happy life.

But if you other guys exist and you're

picking this up -- forget about the

Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they

didn't do it.  It was a mistake'

Someone else did it.  The Army of The

Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids

playing revolutionaries.  It was

someone else!

COLE

I've done my job.  I did what you wanted.

Good luck.  I'm not coming back!

TICKET AGENT

Don't see a lot of this... cash.

RAILLY

It's...a long story.

TICKET AGENT

(smiles, hands over the tickets)

They'll begin boarding in about twenty

minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Got yourself a prob, Bob?

COLE

Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I

didn't have to do that.

RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

Point of fact -- you don't belong here.

It's not permitted to let you stay.

COLE

This is the present.  This is not the past.

This is not the future.  This is right now!

COLE

I'm staying here! You got that?  You

can't stop me!

PLUMP MAN

(high pitched voice)

Anything you say, chief.  It's none of

my business.

TICKET AGENT

Woooo-eeee.  San Francisco, New

Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome,

Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!

That's some trip you're taking, sir,

All in one week!

MR. PONYTAIL (o.s.)

Business.

TICKET AGENT

(handing over the tickets)

Have a good one, sir.

FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)

You gotta be crazy, man!

COLE

Jo...Jose????

JOSE

Pulling out the tooth, man, that was

nuts!  Here, take this.

COLE

What?  What for?  Are you crazy?

JOSE

Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one!

You were a hero, man.  They gave you a

pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come

back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!

COLE

How did you find me?

JOSE

The phone call, man.  The phone call.

COLE

The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?

JOSE

Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!

Yes, that phone call.  I been in training

for this a couple a months now -- ever

since I got back from that... "weird"

war we were in.  You remember that?

(pressing the pistol on Cole)

Here, take it, man!  You could still be

a hero if you'd cooperate!

DR. PETERS

Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little"

represents the sane vision and that

Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!"

is the cry of the true lunatic?

RAILLY

Oh, my God!

P.A  SYSTEM

-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now

ready for boarding at Gate 36.

JOSE

Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.

(then, blurting it out)

Look, I got orders, man!  You know what

I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?

I'm sposed to shoot the lady!  You got

that?  They said, "If Cole don't obey

this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his

girlfriend!"

JOSE

I got no choice, man.  These are my

orders.  Just take it, okay?

COLE

This part isn't about the virus, is it?

JOSE

Hey, man...

COLE

It's about obeying, about doing what

you're told.

JOSE

They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya

want?

COLE

Who am I supposed to shoot?

RAILLY

James!  Thank God!  I thought you'd

disappeared.  Listen, I think I know

who it is!  I saw him!  It's Dr. Mason's

assistant.  An apocalypse nut!  The next

flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.

If he's there, it has to be him.

COLE

I love you, Kathryn.  Remember that.

RAILLY

Maybe we can stop him.  Maybe we can

actually do something.

SECURITY OFFICER

Excuse me, sir.  Would you mind letting me

have a look at the contents of your bag?

DR. PETERS

Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples.

I have the appropriate papers.

RAILLY

Oh, God, we don't have time for this.

DR. PETERS

Biological samples.  I have the

paperwork right here.

SECURITY OFFICER

I'm going to have to ask you to open

this, sir.

DR. PETERS

Open it?

(blinks stupidly, then)

Of course.

DR. PETERS

Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the

papers -- it's all proper.  I have a

permit.

SECURITY OFFICER

It's empty!

DR. PETERS

Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!

But I assure you, it's not.

RAILLY

Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!

SECOND SECURITY OFFICER

You'll have to get in line, ma'am.

TRAVELER

We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so

special about you?

DR. PETERS

You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye.

DR. PETERS

It doesn't even have an odor.

SECURITY OFFICER

That's not necessary, sir.  Here you

go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have

a good flight.

SECOND SECURITY OFFICER

Who are you calling a "moron"?

COLE

Get your hands off her!

SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.}

HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT.

COLE

I said, get your hands off her.  She's

not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a

psychiatrist.

RAILLY

THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY

VIRUS!  STOP HIM!

RAILLY (o.s.)

PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!

FIRST DETECTIVE

(raising his badge)

Police Officers.  Would you step over

here, please.

FIRST SECURITY OFFICER

HE'S GOT A GUN!

FIRST DETECTIVE

STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!

DR. PETERS

WATCH IT!

BRUNETTE (RAILLY)

N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!

MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

My God!  They shot that man!

FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Come along, son, this is no place for us.

FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Hurry up, son.

MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)

Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.

FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.)

It's obscene, all the violence, all the

lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now.

You might say...we're the next endangered

species...human beings!

DR. PETERS

I think you're right. sir.  I think

you've hit the nail on the head.

ASTROPHYSICIST

Jones is my name.  I'm in insurance.

FADE OUT:
