Ferris on monitor

Mr. Johnson, you've been sent to us

by the state authorities for

testing. We want to determine if

there's any substance to your

claims.

CrIS

Fire away.

FERRIS ON MONITOR

If we can verify your ability, we

may be able to help you avoid a

criminal trial.

CRIS

And "we" is...?

Ferris ON MONITOR

Homeland Security.

Ferris ON MONITOR

Now if you would, please look at

the monitor and tell us what you

see, say, five minutes from now.

Ferris (o.c.)

Are you there yet?

2.

CrIS

Surfers.

Ferris (o.c.)

Good. Now can you move ahead ten

minutes.

cris

Ants crawling up a tree.

Ferris (o.c.)

Excellent. Can you get to 1900

hours?

3.

Woman's voice

Sir...Sir?

WAITRESS

Warm-up?

CRIS

Just the check.

Cris (V.O.)

"The future ain't what it used to

be." Ever hear that expression?

CRIS (V.O.)

It's a joke, but it's true. The

future changes every time you look

at it. Because you looked at it.

4.

CRIS (V.O.)

Cause once you see it, you're

different.

CRIS (V.O.)

Maybe just a little.

CRIS (V.O.)

And that changes everything else.

CRIS (V.O.)

It's got something to do with

quantum physics.

Cris (V.O.)

That's why I stay away from

roulette and craps. It only takes a

millionth of an ounce to change a

roll. Just placing a different bet

can throw things off.

CRIS (v.O.)

I've got other rules, too. I don't

play against people, like at poker.

Only against the house.

CRIS (v.o.)

And my goal isn't to win big. At

least not any more. The idea is to

go unnoticed so I can keep coming

back to the trough.

5.

CRIS (v.o.)

So no jackpots. No longshots. No

big bets except when I want `em to

see me lose.

CRIS

Try that one, man. I've got a

feeling.

Gambler

(suspicious)

Then you play it.

CRIS

Against my religion.

CRIS

Do it, quick, before somebody else

gets there.

CRIS (V.O.)

Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring

but controllable.

CRIS (V.O.)

And safe unless they think you're

counting.

6.

casino boss

If you don't mind my asking, why

does Homeland Security give a damn

about who's lucky in Vegas?

Ferris

Maybe they're more than lucky.

casino boss

Then we handle it.

Ferris

I'm not talking about cheating.

That's your problem. But if

somebody wins consistently and you

can't figure out how...Excuse me.

Ferris

Ferris...I'll be there in fifteen.

FERRIS

Call me, like they did. And try to

hold him till I get here.

7.

Casino boss

Yes, ma'am.

Ferris (o.c.)

Nice looking guy.

davis (o.c.)

I guess.

Ferris

Maybe she's in cahoots.

davis

He's beaten six dealers in a row.

ferriS

You're sure he's not counting?

hawkeye

We've got five decks in the shoe.

And he wins more off the top than

the bottom.

davis

Moves a lot from table to table.

hawkeye

Keeps his stacks short.

WAITRESS

What's your pleasure?

CRIS

Grand Dad, rocks.

8.

Ferris

What's his name?

davis

(shrugs)

Not staying here. Pays in cash.

Hawkeye

We're running him through face

check.

Ferris

Invite him for a drink.

(remembers her manners)

If you don't mind.

black suit (o.S.)

Sir, would you come with us,

please.

SNAPBACK to:

WAITRESS

What's your pleasure?

CRIS

Scuse me, sorry.

9.

davis

What's wrong with you guys?

hawkeye

He's right next to you! Aisle 63!

Davis

There! There! He's right there in

front of you! Walk toward each

other!

10.

hawkeye

Maybe he's on our frequency.

DAVIS

I don't see an earphone on him.

hawkeye

He's heading to the Convention

Annex.

FERRIS

(stands)

Give me a headset. I'm going down

there.

Ferris

(to head mic)

He's heading toward...

(reads sign)

the Ipanema Grill.

11.

FERRIS

You! I just need to talk to you!

FERRIS

Homeland Security!

12.

davis

You were right. This guy is a lot

more than lucky.

ferrIS

At least now I know he exists.

Ferris

Jeannie, I have to see him right

away.

Jeannie

He's on with Washington. We just

went on Code Orange.

Ferris

What's the threat?

JEANNIE

We found a dirty bomb in East

Vegas. A barrel of C-4 and a kilo

of nuclear waste. But we're getting

chatter about a dozen more out

there somewhere, ready to blow.

13.

Ferris

Tell him I have a new source that

could help with the case.

JEANNIE

(snide)

Another remote viewer?

Ferris

Have him meet me in imaging.

CrIS

Thanks, guys. Not too heavy on the

starch.

male voice (O.s.)

You pulled me out of a conference

call with the Secretary to show me

a video game?

14.

FERRIS

I need six men to bring him in.

WISDOM

We're on Code Orange.

Ferris

He could help us find the other

bombs.

WISDOM

That's an ultra low probability.

None of your "specials" have ever

panned out, and this isn't the time

to experiment.

FERRIS

Come on, Eric, you saw it. We're

flying blind and he's got radar.

WISDOM

Callie, people are talking. They

say I'm only funding your research

because we're involved.

FeRRIS

That's because they're....

WISDOM

Right.

WISDOM

I'm sorry, but they're right.

FERRIS

You bastard.

WISDOM

I care about you, and I wanted to

support you. But there's a limit to

what I can...

FERRIS

(professional)

Look, we analyzed what this ability

would look like if it existed.

(MORE)

15.

FERRIS (cont'd)

I went screening for it in a highly

scientific way. And now I've

identified someone who matches all

the indicators. So the next obvious

step is to...

wisdom

Let me do my job! - Christ! Don't

you ever quit?

FERRIS

No.

(beat)

I've got a country to protect.

WISDOM

Use your charm on somebody else.

Cris (v.O.)

I'm not God. I don't see

everything. Just my own future.

Cris (v.O.)

To me, it seems normal. The way

lightning comes before thunder.

CRIS (V.O.)

Most of the time, I'm not paying

attention. Just making sure I don't

step in a mess.

16.

CRIS (V.O.)

Sometimes I get a blast from far

away.

CRIS (V.O.)

Or I can start with a glimpse of

something close and keep pushing

on.

CRIS (V.O.)

Usually it's none of my business.

CRIS

Guy around?

MANAGER

You are?

CRIS

Tell him it's King Midas.

FERRIS

Terry? Terry! - I know you've got

your hands full but I was wondering

if you might be able to spare a few

warm bodies for an outside

operation.

17.

BAINES

We're strictly internal.

FERRIS

That's why I need your people.

Everybody else is assigned.

BAINES

Does Wisdom know about this?

FERRIS

He suggested it.

AMANDA

Callie.

(corrects herself)

Agent Ferris. I've got a face match

on your subject. His name is Cris

Johnson.

fERRIS

(slows to a stop)

Never mind, Terry. Pretty Boy here

is wanted for murder in Nevada.

Guy

Well, if it isn't the Golden Man.

Guy

What brings you crawling back to

me?

18.

CRIS

I need to cash some chips. - Got

tagged.

GUY

You burned through your stash

already?

CRIS

I've been trying to lay low.

CavANAUGH (o.s.)

That's him. I call him the Road

Runner. You know? Beep beep.

Ferris

What's he running from?

CAVANAUGH

You showed me yours. I'll show you

mine.

19.

CRIS

(slurred)

He was gonna kill you! You all

would'a died!

Guy

But you of all people. How could

you have let it happen?

CRIS

That was the night Donna broke off

our engagement.

GUY

Ahh.

CRIS

I was so drunk I could barely see

now.

GUY

Well, I hope you don't mind. I

called Neal to let him know you're

here.

CRIS

Christ, Guy, did you have to?

GUY

You say everything's inevitable, so

I guess I did.

CRIS

Well, you can save your breath.

Cause I know what you're gonna say.

20.

GUY

Then you're aware that Neal is in a

serious cash crunch and could lose

it all.

CRIS

I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm

done playing the market.

GUY

Neal's got it all worked out. He'll

fly you out of the country on his

jet. Put you up in style. He pays

taxes, totally legal. You get cash,

squeaky clean. Half the net. When

your share hits fifty mil, you can

say "finito"...and it's over.

CRIS

Except last time, Neal didn't take

"finito" for an answer.

GUY

You need us, asshole! The Law is

breathin' down your neck!

CRIS

I can stay ahead of `em forever.

GUY

But why live that way?

CRIS

Because I don't want to be used any

more.

GUY

What do you give a shit as long as

you get what you want?

CRIS

Cause what I want is freedom. And

you don't get it by giving it up.

21.

CRIS

Enjoy it while it lasts.

SNAPBACK TO:

CRIS

Looking for this?

CRIS

Don't mess with somebody who knows

your moves before you even think

'em.

GUY

The jet'll be sold in a week. Then

there goes your ticket out.

CRIS

Don't wait for me.

Guy

You know what I think? I think I

know the future better than you do.

22.

CAVANAUGH

He's just some gambler. Lives

completely off the grid. No bank

account. No credit cards. No

previous record.

Ferris

So why'd he do it?

CAVANAUGH

Must be a wacko. He'd never met the

victim. No connection whatsoever.

feRRIS

And in fifteen months, why haven't

you caught him?

CAVANAUGH

You saw. He's got eyes in the back

of his head. He can see around

corners. I even had him in custody

once, and he disappeared.

Ferris

Must be very embarrassing.

CAVANAUGH

And what is it you want him for?

Ferris

Questioning.

CAVANAUGH

About?

Ferris

Stuff that hasn't happened yet.

23.

CAVANAUGH

Well, I guess Homeland Security

trumps liquor store murder. How can

I help?

IRV

What are you doing back here?

CRIS

I came to fix you dinner.

IRV

Idiot.

IRV

This is what you get from two packs

a day.

CrIS

But you quit ten years ago.

IRV

It was already too late. I just

didn't know it.

CRIS

Sometimes not knowing is better.

IRV

Look where you're headed, pal. The

big decisions are over before you

even realize you made `em.

24.

CaVANAUGH

Any idea where he might be going?

GUY

I've got a little problem with the

IRS. Think I could get some relief?

FERRIS

Depends how helpful you are.

GuY

Oh, I know everything about him.

FERRIS

I need to speak to him alone.

GUY

And another thing, no woman ever

turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly

because he only propositions the

ones he knows'll say yes, which is

most of `em anyway. But does that

make him happy? No. Says he's

bored. Never surprised. Has to

watch himself die over and over

again.

FERRIS

Why'd he come back to Vegas?

GUY

Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's

this friend who's dying. An old

fart who took him in when he was

strung out on drugs. - He's an

orphan, ya know. Been on the road

since he was ten.

25.

IRV

You want my advice? Get yourself a

good lawyer and turn yourself in.

CRIS

If I tell `em the truth, you know

what happens? I end up with the

Feds. - And you know what they do

to me?

IRV

Make you a secret agent.

Cris

Don't laugh. They strap me in a

chair and make me watch the news.

IRV

Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?

CRIS

It's not funny, Irv. That's all I

do, day after day, for the rest of

my life. Watch the news until I

lose my hair and croak.

Irv

There's no way around it?

CRIS

The best I can do is stay away from

all of `em.

IRV

In that case, you've gotta leave

the country.

CRIS

I know, I know, but there's

something I gotta do first.

26.

IRV

What?

IRV

Cris?

CRIS

She's coming here. The Fed.

IRV

You gotta go?

CRIS

Let's play it out.

CRIS

I've got the place all picked out.

It's called Palau. Three hundred

teeny islands in the South Pacific.

(places roast in pan)

Nothing ever happens there, so

there's nothing to foresee.

IRV

Then what the hell are you waiting

for?

CRIS

Her.

IRV

Who?

CRIS

I haven't met her yet.

IRV

Then find somebody else!

27.

CRIS

It has to be her.

IRV

What's so special about this one?

CRIS

She's the mother of my child.

IRV

I thought you were shooting blanks.

CRIS

I guess the doctors were wrong.

IRV

I don't mean to be indelicate, my

friend, but how do you know the

little bastard is yours?

CRIS

He's got my thing.

IRV

Your thing?

CRIS

My thing.

IRV

I still don't understand why you

never got that fixed.

cris

She's here.

CRIS

Agent Ferris, come in.

28.

FERRIS

One step ahead of the game.

cRIS

Always.

Ferris

Is there some place we can speak

privately?

CRIS

Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a

roast in the oven.

IrV

No, you two stay here. I'll watch

the food.

FERRIS

You're wasting your life, Cris. You

have the most amazing talent, and

you're running from it.

CRIS

Yeah, people say I could have been

a chef.

Ferris

Don't be cute. There's too much at

stake here.

FERRIS

Now if you say that man in the

liquor store was going to shoot

five people, I believe you. Why

else would you kill a stranger?

FERRIS

But no good deed goes unpunished,

eh?

(MORE)

29.

FERRIS (cont'd)

And that's how it's going to be in

this world. People will either hate

you or want to exploit you.

CRIS

Everyone but you, of course.

FERRIS

I can fix your legal problems. More

importantly, I can give you a

chance to use your gift.

CRIS

Trust me, it's better if I don't.

It's better if I just mind my own

business.

FERRIS

I'll be honest with you, Cris.

That's not an option. Your country

needs you. And if we don't grab

you, somebody else will.

CRIS

Nobody's grabbed me yet.

Ferris

You're up against more powerful

forces now.

FERRIS

I'd like you to come with me for

some testing. Would you be willing

to do that?

FERRIS

Where are you going?

FERRIS

(temporarily blinded)

Shit! Cavanaugh!

30.

SNAPBACK TO:

IRV

In that case, you've gotta leave

the country.

CRIS

I know, I know, I've got the place

picked out. But there's something

I've gotta do first.

IRV

What?

IRV

Cris?

CRIS

I have to go.

IRV

You just got here.

CRIS

I know, but they're coming for me.

31.

CRIS

This is for nurses and stuff, to

make things a little easier.

IRV

You're gonna need it.

CrIS

You're the only one I could trust.

Ever.

IRV

I don't suppose you've discovered

any last minute escape for me?

CRIS

I looked, Irv, I really did. I went

down every path, every treatment.

Sometimes there's just no...

IRV

It's okay. It's okay...Now I can

relax.

32.

Snapback TO:

Cris

(to himself)

Twenty-four minutes.

FERRIS

I need him alive, Cavanaugh. Even

if he resists.

CAVANAUGH

Yes, ma'am.

FERRIS

Tell them.

Irv

You'll never catch him. He knows

what you're gonna do to him.

FERRIS

That's very helpful information.

33.

CrIS

Medium coffee, black, and a glazed.

CRIS

Mind if I join you?

LIZ

(prickly)

Yeah, actually I do.

SNAPBACK TO:

CRIS

Is that cruller any good?

SNAPBACK TO:

34.

CRIS

Shopping for a car?

LIZ

What business is it of yours?

SNAPBACK TO:

CRIS

Rough day?

lIZ

I don't want to talk about it.

SnAPBACK TO:

SNAPBACK TO:

LIZ

Aw Christ! Look what you've done!

CRIS

I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz.

LIZ

Yeah, you are.

LIZ

It looked like you spilled it on

purpose.

CRIS

Why would I do that?

LIZ

I don't know. To impress me?

35.

CRIS

Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do

it over.

CRIS

Here.

Liz

Divorce, bankruptcy, repossession.

Yeah, I'd call that a bad year.

CRIS

Well, Liz, your luck's about to

change.

LIZ

How's that?

CRIS

You met me.

LIZ

And what are you, a leprechaun?

CRIS

An angel, actually. And we always

reward the people who help us.

LIZ

Great, what do I have to do?

CRIS

You don't have to do anything.

CRIS

But I could use a ride.

36.

LIZ

When does the luck kick in?

CRIS

It already has.

LIZ

I don't feel anything.

CRIS

Not even a tingle?

LIZ

Son, I haven't had a tingle in

eight months.

Liz

(can't hold it in)

Since my worthless no-good dickhead

of a husband ran out on me.

CRIS

Then you're way overdue. For a

reversal of fortune.

CRIS

Any kids?

LIZ

Thirty.

(off his look)

I teach fifth grade.

CRIS

I mean of your own.

CRIS

I guess that's good. Considering.

LIZ

No, that was the problem. - I

couldn't get pregnant.

37.

CRIS

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

LIZ

You didn't. I'm just running off at

the mouth. - That's why I was in

Vegas. To see another doctor.

CRIS

He didn't want to adopt?

LIZ

No, he had to have a Randy Junior.

LIZ

What, is there an accident?

SnAPBACK TO:

LIZ

When does the luck kick in?

CRIS

It already has.

LIZ

I don't feel anything.

CRIS

(urgent)

Take this exit. Quick!

LIZ

Why?

CRIS

Just take it!

38.

LIZ

It's too late!

CRIS

No it's not!

LIZ

Let go! Are you out of your mind?!

LIZ

Get out!

CRIS

Traffic was piling up. You didn't

see it?

LIZ

GET OUT!!

CRIS

We could'a been stuck there for

hours.

LIZ

I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You

don't grab the steering wheel!

CRIS

You're right. I'm sorry. I

panicked. I get phobic sitting in

traffic. It won't happen again, I

promise.

LIZ

Damn straight, cause you won't be

in the car!

39.

CRIS

How `bout at the next gas station?

Please. I'll fill up your tank.

Ferris

You're wasting time here.

CaVANAUGH

How long have you been in law

enforcement? About six months?

FERRIS

Long enough to know we're not gonna

catch him by surprise.

CAVANAUGH

What, you think he's got some kind

of radar?

FERRIS

Interesting idea. It'd explain a

whole lot.

CAVANAUGH

And Area 51 would explain my

missing tennis shoes. But that

doesn't mean they're on a flying

saucer.

FERRIS

In this case, it does.

40.

CRIS

I am really really really really

sorry.

Liz

Get in the car. I'll be back in a

minute.

CAVANAUGH

I'd call your proof a little iffy.

FERRIS

Look, from your own experience,

this guy can't be punched, shot,

surprised, captured, or confined.

So either he's got something

special, or you're an idiot.

CAVANAUGH

Let's say I'm not an idiot...

FERRIS

And I'm not saying you are.

CAVANAUGH

Then what?

FERRIS

We've got to think like he does.

We've got to think ahead.

41.

CRIS

But lately I've been traveling all

around Oregon. It's really peaceful

up there.

LIZ

All right, I'm starting getting the

picture. - Basically, you're a no-

good, worthless ramblin' man who's

never held a job in life.

CRIS

(smiles)

Exactly.

liz

At least you're honest about it.

LIZ

This is where I turn into town.

CRIS

Well, thanks for the ride.

LIZ

Thanks for the card.

CRIS

You're welcome.

cRIS

I don't suppose you'd have time for

a drink.

LIZ

No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow.

42.

CRIS

I understand...Well, see ya.

LIZ

So long.

LIZ

Well, maybe just a quick one.

LIZ

Hey, George.

Bartender

Hey, Liz.

LIZ

I'll take the usual and he'll have

a...

CRIS

Sierra Pale.

Bartender

Two Sierras.

BartENDER

Randy's been hanging around.

LIZ

He's not here now, is he?

LIZ

Thanks.

LIZ

We gotta split. My ex is here.

43.

Randy

I gotta talk to you, baby.

LIZ

Sure, Randy. I'll call you

tomorrow.

Randy

Bullshit. I've left a dozen

messages on your phone.

Cris

Excuse me. We were just leaving.

Randy

And who the hell are you?

Liz

Don't mess with him, Cris. He used

to play hockey.

CRIS

Just a friend.

Randy

Then don't get between me and my

woman.

LIZ

I'm not yours anymore, asshole!

Randy

Baby, I've made a terrible mistake,

and I just want to undo all the...

liz

Let go!

44.

RANDY

You still care for me, I know it.

CRIS

Easy, man.

LIZ

Get out of here! Get out!

SNAPBACK TO:

RANDY

You still care for me, I know it.

CRIS

Easy, man.

45.

LIZ

Stop it, Randy! Stop it!

LIZ

Get out of here! Get out!

LIZ

Oh God, I'll take you to the

emergency room.

CRIS

No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital.

LIZ

God, I hate that bastard...Will

somebody get some ice!

CRIS

I'm sorry I'm causing you all this

trouble.

LIZ

Are you kidding? You stood up for

me.

CRIS

Actually, I wasn't standing for

that long.

LIZ

Sorry it's so cold in here. The

heater's broken.

46.

LIZ

I really should've left him a long

time ago. God knows he deserved it.

CRIS

Why didn't you?

LIZ

Cause I don't leave. I never have.

My boyfriends always left me.

LIZ

I get attached to people, and then

I'll put up with anything.

CRIS

What a terrible quality. You're too

loyal.

LIZ

Sit in the light.

LIZ

I never minded that I was the more

devoted one. Somebody's gotta be

more this or more that.

LIZ

But they never appreciate it, that

you're there for them.

LIZ

They just try and get away with

more and more, and figure you'll

just...

47.

LIZ

Salty.

LIZ

Christ, I don't even know you. I

have no idea who you are.

SNAPBACK TO:

LIZ

Sorry to get you caught up in my

soap opera.

CRIS

Once you start watching, it's hard

not to get involved.

LIZ

You ever been married?

CRIS

Almost.

LIZ

What happened?

CRIS

She wanted kids.

LIZ

And you didn't?

CRIs

No, I did, too.

48.

CRIS

It's just that...I can't.

LIZ

Why are you telling me this? These

personal details.

CRIS

I don't know. You asked and...I

guess I felt like you'd understand.

lIZ

I do.

lIZ

I can't either. Have kids.

CRIS

That was incredible.

LiZ

What was?

CRIS

This.

49.

DISSOLVE TO:

LIZ

That was...I've never...

expert 1

We sent the payload to Livermore,

and by measuring the cesium

degradation, they've identified the

reactor in Smerlensk that it came

from.

expert 2

Washington has our birds tracking

for that radiation signature in key

cities.

wisdom

What do we know about the

explosive?

Expert 3

Our lab downstairs is still

studying the C-4 sample. It's

Czech, but we haven't nailed down

the batch.

WISDOM

So basically we've got nothing.

50.

WISDOM

You're failing your country,

people. You're not trying hard

enough.

(looks around the table)

Do you understand what I'm saying?

Do you understand what I expect

from you?

WisDOM

TWIST ARMS! CRACK HEADS! BREAK THE

FUCKIN' LAW! BUT DON'T LET THIS

HAPPEN!

WISDOM

(suddenly calm)

Are there any questions?

FERRIS

You know you're very sexy when

you're ruthless.

WISDOM

We're groping in the dark.

FERRIS

My guy's got a flashlight. We just

need to bring him in.

WISDOM

I'll see if Baines can spare some

manpower.

FERRIs

You're all the manpower I need.

51.

LIZ

What the hell are you doing?

CRIS

You said it was broken.

LIZ

Well, you're not leaving till it's

fixed, I'll tell you that.

crIS

I'm afraid that could take a while.

LIZ

As long as it's done right.

FeRRIS

Did Wisdom talk to you?

BaiNES

(grudging)

What do you need?

FERRIS

This one first.

52.

BAINES

What is it?

FERRIS

A trap for somebody who can see the

future.

BAINES

If you say so.

FERRIS

And then these.

LIZ

And what was the main staple of

their diet?

shy girl

Trout.

LIZ

From the lake?

SHY GIRL

No. From the rivers.

LIZ

Right. And the Washo were so

jealous of their fishing grounds

that when other Native Americans

came to trade for dried fish, they

were only permitted to remain one

night.

LIz

I'll be right back.

53.

LIZ

What are you doing here?

CrIS

(beaming)

I brought ice cream sandwiches for

everybody.

LIZ

Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have

any idea how much fat they have in

them? Don't you see how overweight

half of them are?

CRIS

(crestfallen)

I - I didn't think of it. - I

thought you'd be happy to see me.

LIZ

Well next time exercise a little

forethought, okay?

CRIS

Do you want me to leave these

somewhere?

LIZ

No.

CRIS

All right then. I'll just go.

LIZ

Put a few in the freezer. I love

ice cream sandwiches.

54.

LIZ

You have been such a bad influence.

I'm gonna be up all night grading

papers.

CRIS

I've got a better idea. Run away

with me to the South Pacific.

LIZ

Funny. We've only known each other

a week.

CRIS

But we're going to be happy

together for the rest of our lives.

Really, I peeked.

LIZ

I think you're serious.

CRIS

Deadly.

CRIS

Let's go pack your bags. We'll

leave tonight.

LIZ

And what'll we do for money?

CRIS

Don't worry. That's always been

easy for me.

LIZ

This is ridiculous.

55.

CRIS

Why?

LIZ

Well, first of all, it's the middle

of the school year.

CRIS

They'll replace you.

LIZ

And I'm in charge of science fair.

CRIS

They can pick up the slack.

LIZ

It disturbs me, Cris, that you

think it's okay just to duck your

responsibilities.

CRIS

I - I don't think it's okay. I'm

not that kind of person. But I

have this feeling, this very strong

feeling, that it has to be now. We

have to leave soon, or it's not

gonna work out.

LIZ

I don't believe that. If it's meant

to be between two people, somehow

it'll happen.

CRIS

Yes, but sometimes you have to make

it happen. You have to seize the

opportunity before it's too late.

LIZ

What are you afraid of, Cris? Why

are you running away from yourself?

(MORE)

56.

LIZ (cont'd)

Whatever it is you're looking for,

I don't think you're going to find

it on some island, cut off from the

rest of the world.

CRIS

Your students are very lucky.

LIZ

Now I've got to grade papers.

Randy

A religious fella, are you? Ready

to turn the other jaw?

CRIS

But then you have to sign the

divorce papers.

LiZ

Randy, don't you dare.

Liz

Paul, Janice. Have you met Cris?

Randy

There's something weird about that

jerk. Have you checked him out?

Policeman RICK

I'm not dragging the Law into your

romantic squabbles, Randy.

57.

Randy

C'mon, Rick, help me out here.

Paul

Cris, are you free on Tuesday?

Cause I'd like you to be my guest

at the Rotary luncheon.

Janice

I'm the first female member.

SNAPBACK TO:

Paul

Cris, are you free on Tuesday?

Cause I'd like you to be my guest

at the Rotary luncheon.

Janice

I'm the first female member.

LIZ

Cris.

CrIS

Miss! Lady! Don't!

58.

CrIS

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for

the damages.

CRIS

I said I'll pay.

DRIVER

You're damn right you'll pay! I

wanna talk to the cops.

CRIS

No need for that. I'll give you

cash. Okay? Will you take cash?

CriS

Two thousand? That should cover it.

DRIVER

Make it three.

CRIS

Okay, three.

59.

POLICEMAN riCK

I'll run him through the computer.

criS

People shouldn't drive that fast

around kids. They shouldn't get

away with it.

LIZ

So you throw rocks at them?

CRIS

What do you want me to do? Wait for

people to die?

LIZ

Cris...I think you should move on.

Today.

CRIS

Look, there's something I've been

wanting to tell you.

LIZ

It doesn't matter.

CRIS

It does.

60.

CaVANAUGH

Cavanaugh...No, you were right to

call...Ring Ferris and have her

meet me there.

CaVANAUGH

They've located him near Tahoe.

CaVANAUGH's wife

If you let him get away again, you

may not have a job.

CAVANAUGH

I know.

LIZ

What are you saying, you're some

sort of prophet?

CRIS

It's not religious. I just happen

to see my life before it happens.

LIZ

Cris, it's sweet that you feel

responsible for people. But I think

you need help.

LiZ

And I'm...I'm not the one to help

you, right now. I've got too much

going on in my own life.

CRIS

Flip it.

LIZ

Why?

61.

CRIS

Just do it.

CRIS

Heads.

CRIS

Flip it again.

(calls it in the air)

Tails.

CRIS

Tails.

(she looks;flips again)

Heads.

(she looks, flips again)

Tails.

CRIS

Now you believe me?

LIZ

Yeah. And I don't want to have

anything to do with you.

CRIS

Liz.

(follows)

Don't you see? I can get us all the

money we need.

LIZ

Don't follow me. Don't talk to me.

Get out of my life!

SNAPBACK TO:

62.

Cris

What do you want me to do? Wait for

people to die?

LIZ

Cris...I think you should move on.

Today.

CRIS

Why? Because I care so much about

kids that sometimes I overreact?

ferris (o.s.)

Who's the woman?

POLICEMAN rick

Liz Cooper. Nice girl, but very

erratic.

cAVANAUGH

Think she'll cooperate?

POLICEMAN RICK

Hard to say. She's impossible to

control.

Ferris

Sounds like you've tried.

POLICEMAN RICK

She's quite a challenge.

LIZ

I swear, I can't figure you out.

63.

CRIS

Believe me, the feeling is mutual.

LIZ

Sometimes you seem mindlessly

impulsive. But other times I feel

like you're utterly calculating,

saying exactly what you think'll

push my buttons.

CRIS

What do you mean?

LIZ

Don't you think it's kind of an

amazing coincidence that neither of

us can have kids?

CRIS

You want to talk to my doctor? I'll

get him on the phone. No, really, I

mean it. I'll have him send you my

records. Because I want you to

trust me.

LIZ

Then open up. Talk to me. Where are

you going with your life?

crIS

Wherever it takes me.

LiZ

You never think about the future?

CRIS

All the time. - But mainly how to

stay out of trouble.

LIZ

No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?

CRIS

There's only one thing I've ever

wanted.

LIZ

What's that?

64.

CRIS

A family.

LIZ

That's all? Just a family?

CRIS

Well, I was, as they say, left on a

doorstep when I was two.

(makes light of it)

Never found foster parents who

could put up with me. - So to me, a

family sounds like plenty.

LIZ

You've got to be making this up.

CRIS

I wish.

LIZ

You poor guy.

CAVANAUGH

I say we get the whole department

up here and bust his ass.

Ferris

And by that time, his ass'll be

long gone.

CAVANAUGH

Then why won't he see through your

trap?

Ferris

Let's try this one more time.

65.

LIZ

I'll meet you inside. I need to

pick something up at the drug

store.

FERRIS

Stay in the car. If he sees your

shadow, he won't take the bait.

CaVANAUGH

We hear you.

Ferris

I'm serious. This guy can smell

your farts before you even eat the

beans.

rick

Miss, I won't even think about

beans.

Rick

Sounds like a crock to me.

CAVANAUGH

You haven't been chasing him for

three years.

Ferris

Miss Cooper.

LIZ

Yes?

66.

FERRIS

Agent Ferris.

LIZ

He's not a killer. He needs help.

Ferris

I agree. But he has a long history

of resisting arrest, and the state

wants to hunt him down with fifty

trigger-happy cops.

LIZ

(aghast)

You're not gonna let them.

FERRIS

That's why I came to you.

LIZ

Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to

get him to...

FERRIS

Even his best friend says he'll

never turn himself in. - At this

stage, there's only one way to keep

him from self-destructing.

crIS

What took so long?

LIZ

I ran into a friend I hadn't seen

in a while.

67.

LIZ

She said we could use her cabin up

at the peak.

caVANAUGH

Did you tell her about the future

thing?

Ferris

Of course not. I wanted her to

believe me. - But I loaded her up

with liquor, to dim his headlights.

CRIS

God, this is gorgeous.

CRIS

What's wrong?

LIZ

Nothing.

68.

baines

Okay, when you press the remote,

the cabin will lock down like a big

jail cell.

FERRIS

But silently, right?

BAINES

Unnoticeably.

CAVANAUGH

And that's when we go in.

Ferris

You still don't get it.

(tries to be patient)

This has to be clear to your whole

army.

(to Baines)

And yours. -- After she comes out

and we lock down the cabin...We

don't do anything. We wait.

Policeman RICK

But if he's already trapped...?

FERRIS

Gentlemen, try to think like him. -

If the plan is to go in right after

he's trapped, he'll see it coming

and he'll slip away before he's

trapped...

(to Cavanaugh)

Like he's always done.

cavANAUGH

How does your plan change anything?

baines

At least he won't hear it when the

trap closes.

FERRIS

And if he doesn't know he's

trapped, he can't foresee knowing

he's trapped.

CAVANAUGH

That kinda makes sense.

69.

FERRIS

The eureka moment is when he

realizes he's been trapped.

CAVANAUGH

When is that?

ferriS

That's the point. We want to delay

"eureka" for as long as possible.

So by the time he sees trouble and

decides to waltz away...

baines

(finally gets it)

He's already been in the trap for

hours.

FERRIS

Voila.

RICK

You're smart.

LIZ

Cris. Do you think we met for a

reason?

CRIS

You mean, do I believe a higher

power brought us together?

LIZ

Yeah.

CRIS

No. I think we're just the last in

a long chain of accidents that

started with the Big Bang.

70.

LIZ

That's not very romantic.

CRIS

Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us

to meet, everything from the very

beginning, every sub-atomic event,

every galactic cataclysm, every

step of evolution, every act, every

accident, every decision in the

history of the universe had to

happen exactly the way it did just

so you and I could be together,

right here and now.

CRIS

To whatever happens next.

LIZ

I shouldn't.

CRIS

(concerned)

Why?

LIZ

I'm late.

CRIS

Late?

LIZ

That's why I went to the drug

store. To get a pregnancy test.

LIZ

You know what this means?

71.

CRIS

I do now.

LIZ

How did it...?

CRIS

I have no idea. Unless...But that

still doesn't explain...

CRIS

Liz, I really did have this

problem. I wasn't lying to you.

CRIS

But this is good. This is amazing.

I want this baby more than

anything.

LIZ

It's like a miracle.

CRIS

For both of us.

baines

Think she'll come through?

72.

FERRIS

Women hate good-looking men.

Rejecting them makes us feel

powerful.

Baines

And that's more important than

love?

FERRIS

No. But she doesn't really love

him.

CriS

Liz... Liz?

FERRIS

Surprise.

Snapback TO:

73.

CRIS

You lying bitch! You betrayed me!

SnAPBACK TO:

CRIS

(whispers)

Liz, please, I love you.

CRIS

Let me talk to you for one minute.

I won't hurt you, I promise.

LIZ

Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt

people. But you need help or you're

going to keep on hurting them.

CRIS

The man I killed was there to rob

the store. He was going to panic

and shoot five innocent people.

74.

LIZ

How do you know this?

CRIS

Because I saw them die.

LIZ

Like yesterday, with the car?

CRIS

Yes.

LIZ

You were afraid something bad might

happen so you...

CRIS

Not "might"! Those people died! -

They just hadn't died yet.

LIZ

What if you hadn't done anything?

Have you ever waited to see what

would happen?

CRIS

Once.

CRIS

That's why I don't go out much. So

I won't be there to see.

CAVANAUGH

What's taking so long?

BAINES

We could just do this the old-

fashioned way.

75.

LIZ

Cris, you're a good man. And I will

stand by you through this. But you

have to...

CRIS

If they catch me, they'll put me in

a cell without a trial, and they'll

never let me out. They do that, you

know.

LIZ

I won't let it happen. I'll get you

a lawyer.

LIZ

Cris...Cris.

CRIS

There's one decent path.

(fixes her gaze)

But if we're gonna stay on it, I

need you to do exactly what I say.

CRIS

Will you give me one chance? One

chance in exchange for a miracle?

caVANAUGH

We can't wait any longer. We've got

to go in.

FERRIS

Okay. Wait for my signal.

76.

CRIS

A few steps on, your robe will get

caught on a thornbush. You won't be

able to get unstuck. Ferris and a

tough guy will come help you.

She'll say, "You've done your

country a great service."

LIZ

And then?

CRIS

Be unpredictable. Surprise works to

my advantage. - And read this when

you're safe.

LIZ

Will I see you again?

CRIS

Bet on it.

Ferris

She's coming now.

(to Cavanaugh)

We stay put. Tell them.

CAVANAUGH

(disappointed, via radio)

We stand pat till notified. Don't

make a sound.

77.

FERRIS

What's she waiting for?

Ferris

You've done your country a great

service.

LIZ

Then why do I feel like a traitor?

78.

Ferris

Rick, get her some coffee.

CAVANAUGH

(relays a message)

We've got movement in the canyon.

(to radio)

Where are you?

bAINES

She told him.

CAVANAUGH

We tried it your way.

Ferris

Go for it. But I want him alive.

79.

CAVANAUGH

Boys, now it's our turn.

FERRIS

I want him alive. Tell them.

CaVANAUGH

(afterthought, to radio)

And the Feds want him alive.

Ferris

We need to get to him first.

FERRIS

You've made a very stupid mistake.

LIZ

I trust him more than I trust you.

Ferris

I wouldn't swallow the "I love you"

part.

LIZ

You've never even met him.

FERRIS

But I've profiled him for months.

And I can tell you this: he doesn't

love anybody. How could he? To him,

we're not even human.

(MORE)

80.

FERRIS (cont'd)

We're the characters in a

videogame, and he's the player with

the joystick. We say our lines, and

he practices his moves until we do

what he wants.

Trooper

There! I got him!

TrooPER 1

Stop!

troOPER 2

Take better aim!

TROOPER 1

I'm trying!

baines

You might be right about this guy.

FERRIS

(shakes her head)

I underestimated him.

81.

FERRIS

By a lot.

Trooper

Shit!

ferriS

Be thorough, gentlemen. If you

leave a way out, he'll find it.

TEAM leader

(to radio)

I've got two men down. Friendly

fire.

FERRIS

(to radio and Baines)

Change of plans, everybody.

(MORE)

82.

FERRIS (cont'd)

Try to kill him. Use everything

you've got.

CAVANAUGH (o.c.)

Is this a joke?

FERRIS

No, it's an order.

BaiNES

Don't get emotional here.

FERRIS

There's only one way to beat this

man. He's got to see his own death,

and not just maybe. He's got to see

himself die again and again and

know it's inescapable. And then,

maybe, he'll surrender.

bAINES

And if he doesn't?

FERRIS

That'll be his choice. And he was

no use to us anyway.

Snapback TO:

SNAPBACK TO:

SnaPBACK TO:

83.

BAINES

Damn. Fifty men might not be

enough.

FERRIS

Somehow we've got to bring him down

to our level.

BaINES

Got any ideas?

FERRIS

I'm workin' on it.

BAINES

He's crossed over into Maxwell

Gorge.

FERRIS

Move in fast. Keep him moving.

Don't let him rest.

FERRIS

Don't give him time to look ahead.

That's the key.

84.

SNAPBACK TO:

BAINES

He's heading this way.

feRRIS

Cavanaugh! We've got a fox hunt

going in Maxwell Gorge, right

beneath the stakeout. Throw

everybody into it! We need to

overload him!

FerrIS (o.c.)

Gentlemen, if he surrenders, fine,

cuff him. But if he even shivers,

shoot to kill.

85.

CaVANAUGH

(megaphone)

Lie down on your stomach, hands

behind your head! You've got ten

seconds. Ten seconds and we shoot.

CAVANAUGH

This is your last warning.

fERRIS

Keep after him! Quick! Stay on him!

86.

baines

What the...?

CRIS

Believe me now?

LIZ

I'm getting used to miracles.

CRIS

Where were you going?

LIZ

No idea. I was just trying to be

unpredictable.

87.

LIZ

So what's the plan? Bonnie and

Clyde?

CrIS

Remember that place in the South

Pacific?

LIZ

It's starting to sound really good.

CRIS

I'll check on our ride.

Guy

Yeah...

Guy

No, the jet's not sold...I'm here

with him now...Of course, he's

pissed...I can ask.

Guy

He wants to know how soon the jet

can be ready.

88.

Neal

I'll wait until eight o'clock. But

if he's not there, I'm taking off

without him.

cRIS

It's arranged. But we have to get

to the North Vegas airport by

eight.

LIZ

Will we make it?

CRIS

Right now I'm just trying to stay

alive.

LIZ

Christ, you live dangerously.

CRIS

Just the opposite. I never take

chances.

89.

FERRIS

(to radio)

Cavanaugh, get all your men into

town.

(waits)

Cavanaugh? Tell them.

BaINES

He's dead. Crashed.

FERRIS

You take command of the chase.

(hands him the map)

Have cars block these intersection.

BAINES

Why these?

FERRIS

Get in the chopper.

CRIS

Did the doctors ever say why you

couldn't have kids?

LIZ

I grew up at Love Canal.

90.

CRIS

What's that?

LIZ

A neighborhood back East built over

a chemical dump. A bunch of my

friends had birth defects.

(looks back)

I always figured I was lucky just

to be sterile.

CRIS

Except you're not. And neither am

I. We're different, that's all. We

just had to find the right match.

LIZ

And somehow we did.

BAINES

(discouraged)

He doesn't miss a beat.

FERRIS

(pleased, to herself)

Come to momma.

91.

FERRIS

(to radio)

Stay after him. Keep the pressure

on.

BAINES

(incredulous)

He's driving right into it...

BAINES

Sometimes looking one step ahead

isn't enough.

LIZ

You make it look easy.

CRIS

Oh shit. Oh no.

Liz

What is it?

CRIS

I blew it.

92.

FERRIS

I need your vehicle.

BAINES

What's the plan?

FERRIS

Playing chicken.

BAINES

Don't be stupid! He knows what

you'll do!

FERRIS

But so do I. And for once, that

makes us even.

CRIS

GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE!

LiZ

What's going to happen?

cris

We'll find out.

93.

94.

SnapBACK TO:

95.

FERRIS

Cuffs on both wrists. Leave him if

he doesn't.

BaiNES

What can he do hanging by one arm?

FERRIS

I don't want to find out.

Baines

Both wrists!

FERRIS

I was wrong about one thing. He is

capable of love.

Ferris

Cris Johnson, we meet at last.

CRIS

Why does everybody have amnesia but

me?

96.

FERRIS

I only ask one thing from you. Give

me a chance to earn your trust.

cris

I did, and you failed.

FERRIS

Then give me another chance. You

get `em all the time.

CRIS

Don't let them know you're

pregnant.

CrIS

You don't have to raise him. But at

least let him be born. Can you do

that? It might be the only chance

either of us gets.

LIZ

I promise.

LIZ

Work with them Cris. So we can be

together.

CRIS

I'll get us out of here. We can

still make the plane.

97.

Wisdom

Are you out of your mind? Did you

ever play chicken before?

FERRIS

This game was different. He knew I

wouldn't flinch.

baINES

What's new with the Code Orange?

WISDOM

It's red now. And we're out of

leads.

fERRIS

Then you better hope he's what I

say he is.

WISDOM

Please, make me a believer.

FERRIS (o.c.)

Electromagnets.

98.

WiSDOM

Aren't you being a little over-

cautious?

FERRIS

Not possible with him.

FERRIS

Cris, please step into the next

room.

FERRIS

Cris, we'll be firing at you with

live ammo. Are you ready?

WisDOM

You're shooting your secret weapon?

CrIS

You're paying for the shirt.

WisDOM

(unconvinced)

I hope you've got more than that.

99.

FERRIS

Now we are going to use live ammo.

WISDOM

Not on my watch, you're not.

FERRIS

I promise you, he won't be hit.

WISDOM

It's your experiment.

CRIS

"From now on, Cris, the bullets are

real."

FERRIS

He's almost impossible to shoot,

hit, surprise, capture, or contain.

WISDOM

Mind if I try?

FERRIS

Be my guest.

100.

WisDOM

How do you know it's prevision?

Maybe he's reading minds.

FERRIS

No minds to read. The guns are

aimed automatically by infrared.

WiSDOM

(impressed)

What other tricks can he do?

ferris

(to Cris)

Please step into the next room.

CRIS

I'm going. No need for a hotfoot.

BaiNES

(explains, to Wisdom)

The floor is electrified. He must

have tried resisting and foreseen

the result.

Ferris on monitor

Cris, it's time to get started with

the next test. This won't be

unpleasant. We just need to you sit

in the chair.

101.

Ferris on monitor

I want you to look ahead, tell me

the time on the clock and then tell

me what film clip you see playing.

Let's start with five minutes from

now. Then we'll press ahead as far

as you're capable of.

(to Wisdom)

The clips have been assembled at

random by a computer, so nobody

knows what'll be playing next.

cris

Look, I'll stand here and tell you

what I see.

Ferris on monitor

I'm afraid we need you to sit.

CRIS

Why?

Ferris on monitor

Why not?

CRIS

I know what happens.

Ferris oN MONITOR

Tell us.

CRIS

You tie me down and never let me

out.

FerriS

That's only because you won't

cooperate.

CRIS

Because you're trying to force me.

102.

Ferris

Work with us, Cris, and you can be

a hero. Fight us, and things will

get worse and worse.

Ferris ON MONITOR

(severe)

Now sit in the chair. One. Two.

Three.

WISDOM

Whoa, you are one tough bitch.

FERRIS

We're still in a Code Red if I'm

not mistaken.

WISDOM

He knew he'd get shocked, but he

chose to resist.

FERRIS

He's almost never had to face

consequences.

(flips toggle)

Cris, are you ready to get in the

chair?

FERRIS

We need information, right?

FERRIS

Leave him there. We'll start again

when he recovers.

103.

WISDOM

Okay, how do we use him to find the

bombs?

FERRIS

Simple. We make him watch the news

and tell us about it.

WISDOM

How far ahead can he see?

FERRIS

I don't know. But I suspect we can

increase his range with practice.

Especially if we restrict his

future to only watching news. Then

he'll be like a timescope.

WISDOM

You were right. This is huge.

FERRIS

This is just for starters. You want

to stage a pre-emptive strike, he

can tell you if you'll hit the

target and whether they hit back

and what went wrong. And you can do

this over and over until you get it

perfect before you begin.

wisDOM

And all he's ever done with it is a

little gambling and securities

fraud?

FeRRIS

I know, it's amazing; but he's not

ambitious.

WiSDOM

Damn, how will we control this guy

when he figures out what he's

capable of?

104.

Ferris

We control him now. We just have to

keep it that way.

WISDOM

Right now, sweetheart, we can't

even get him to sit in a chair.

WISDOM

We've got to think this through.

Your friend could be more dangerous

than the terrorists.

Ferris

Aren't you running ahead of

yourself?

WISDOM

With this guy, you have to. Or

it'll be over before it begins.

Ferris

So we'll keep him in chains.

WISDOM

That may not be enough. We may

have to cut off his arms and legs.

Then I might start to feel safe.

Ferris

You're not serious.

WISDOM

Think about it. What we're talking

about here is the next step in

human evolution. And I'm not gonna

make the same mistake the

Neanderthals made when they ran

across this good-looking Homo

Sapien fellow and all the lady

Neanderthals said, "He's so cute.

Let's keep him around."

FERRIS

Can we deal with your sexual

insecurities at another time?

105.

WISDOM

You mean after it's too late?

Ferris

I wish you'd given me a chance to

chain him up before you decided to

prune him into a stump.

wisdom

You think he knows? Already?

WiSDOM

I haven't made any firm decisions.

Maybe we will just keep him tied

up.

FERRIS

I told you, he doesn't read minds.

He sees the results.

Wisdom

Tell Baines to meet us there. And

bring a dozen men.

106.

WISDOM

Wait for my signal, then go in and

surround him.

WISDOM

I'll do the talking.

WISDOM

Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the

director of this facility.

(MORE)

107.

WISDOM (cont'd)

We're in the middle of a Code Red,

and we'd like your help in

preventing a major catastrophe.

CRIS

I don't believe you.

WISDOM (o.s.)

I apologize for the way you've been

treated. Agent Ferris got a little

carried away.

wisdom (o.S.)

Could I ask you as a favor to

please sit in the chair so we can

begin?

WiSDOM

What's he doing?

FeRRIS

Looking ahead.

108.

WISDOM

(to microphone)

Cris, time is running out.

wiSDOM (plasma screen)

We need your cooperation right

away.

SnAPBACK:

wiSDOM (plasma screen)

Cris, don't you feel some sense of

obligation to the rest of us? Your

ability could save so many lives.

SNAPBACK:

wiSDOM (plasma screen)

Cris, don't you feel some sense of

obligation to the rest of us? Your

ability could save so many lives.

109.

FERRIS

Don't give him time. Send them in

now.

WISDOM

Baines, do it.

wiSDOM (plasma screen)

Cris, don't you feel some sense of

obligation to the rest of us? Your

ability could save so many lives.

wISDOM

What happened? - You idiots!

110.

CrIS

Don't make me do what I can do.

CRIS

Don't get too attached to your arms

and legs.

CrIS

Don't.

WISDOM

Don't let him out of here alive.

baINES

Isolate the building. If there's

one exit overlooked, he'll know it.

FERRIS

If there's one soft heart, one slow

shooter, he'll know it.

FeRRIS

Don't worry. I caught him once;

I'll catch him again.

WISDOM

Be careful. I don't want anything

to happen to you.

111.

Sergeant

You five, up. You five, down. The

rest stay with me.

WISDOM

No demerol. I need to be alert.

FERRIS

Get him a local.

amanda

You asked for these as soon as they

were ready.

112.

FERRIS

Not now.

amanda

You might want to check this

result.

FeRRIS

How pregnant?

amanda

A few days.

FERRIS

This is getting interesting. We

have a mating pair.

WISDOM

Secure the female.

Cris (o.c.)

Unscrew the vent.

SOLDIER

(to Liz)

We're here to protect you.

113.

Leo

He must be in the walls.

SOLDIER

I found him! In here!

SNAPBACK:

Cris

(to himself)

Sixteen minutes.

114.

115.

Baines

He hasn't gotten out through any

exit. The bad news is...

wisdOM

You've lost him.

BAINES

I'm issuing infrared to all my men.

We should have a fix in a few

minutes.

WISDOM

You realize if he gets away now,

we'll never get him back. He'll be

out there, and he'll be our enemy.

FeRRIS

I know how to flush him out.

bainES

(at a loss)

Fine. Tell me what to do.

FERRIS

We don't actually have to do

anything.

(beat)

We just have to decide to do

something...unthinkable.

116.

WISDOM

You want me to threaten to kill a

pregnant woman?

FERRIS

Threats don't count. When he

foresees that you actually did kill

her, that she's dead...

(beat)

He won't let it happen. - He'll

come to us. Surrender. And she'll

live.

FERRIS

But it only works if we're not

bluffing. Because he'll know.

117.

SnaPBACK TO:

118.

Leo

I've got him. Third level, building

C. Pete, Brian, get up there. Kyle,

block off the west staircase.

Jason, bring your dogs in from the

east.

Leo

He was on third level seventy

seconds ago.

BaINES

But where is he now?

119.

LEO

He's on this floor!...Shit! He's

coming here!

LEO (o.c.)

He blinded us.

120.

BAINES (o.c.)

And the dogs are useless.

FERRIS

He's getting away.

WISDOM

Any developments on the Code Red?

...Let me know if there are.

WISDOM

Baines, bring the girl friend to

the Interrogation Room.

(to Ferris)

I'll deal with her there.

BAINES

We're moving her.

121.

SOLDIER

Sit there and shut up.

FERRIS

You understand what's at stake

here? We're playing for the future.

Not just what happens next, but

what the future is. What the rules

are.

(MORE)

122.

FERRIS (cont'd)

If one man will know it and control

it -- and have power over the rest

of us. Or if we'll have power over

him.

WISDOM

By killing an innocent woman.

FERRIS

If you want, I'll pull the trigger.

WISDOM

I think that might be...more

reliable.

FERRIS

I'll join you in a minute. I need

to take care of some details.

WISDOM

Get more men up here.

FERRIS

This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper

tanked up and ready.

123.

WISDOM

(not listening)

Where the hell did she get the

scissors?

PATROL LEADER

Hold your fire.

(gets on the radio)

We've got the target in plain sight

in Corridor 2C, but he's holding a

hostage. Agent Ferris. - Request

instructions.

BAINES

You won't believe this. He's got

Ferris.

WISDOM

How?

BAINES

I don't know, but he's on his way

to the front door.

(beat)

They want instructions.

124.

WISDOM

Don't shoot.

BAINES

Then how are we going to stop him?

WISDOM

We don't. We let him go.

- It's part of the plan.

BAINES

You're sure about this?

WISDOM

No, but Ferris is.

WISDOM

I hope he loves you as much as I

love her.

wisdom (o.c.)

Cris Johnson...I've got your girl

friend. We know her condition.

wisdom (o.c.)

Something very bad will happen at

six o'clock unless you're back in

custody.

CRIS

(to Ferris)

He hasn't got the balls.

FERRIS

We'll find out, won't we?

125.

LIZ

You're not going to kill me. That's

what the bad guys do.

WISDOM

In war, you have to be as ruthless

as your enemy.

LIZ

(emphatic)

Cris isn't the enemy.

WISDOM

I didn't mean him.

LIZ

Can't you just leave us alone?

126.

FERRIS

God, you're remarkable.

FERRIS

I wish you had a little more sense

of duty.

CRIS

I'd say you have way too much.

CRIS

Give me your keys.

CRIS

(to soldier)

If I see you, I'll kill her.

WISDOM

I'm sorry.

FERRIS

You know what our problem is?

CRIS

"We got off on the wrong foot."

127.

FERRIS

It's really...

CRIS

"all been a big misunderstanding."

FERRIS

Exactly.

CRIS

"We've never meant you any harm."

FERRIS

It sounds so insincere when you say

it.

CRIS

I guess you're a better liar than I

am.

FERRIS

You know what I'm going to say

next?

CRIS

It'll never happen.

FERRIS

My door will be open. We can start

from scratch.

FERRIS

The magic word is cooperate. That's

all we've ever wanted to hear from

you.

CRIS

When are they going to give up?

After you're dead?

128.

SNAPBACK TO:

ferriS

I wish you had a little more sense

of duty.

CRIS

To a gang of murderers?

FERRIS

I see you got our message.

CRIS

What's about to happen...you've

brought it on yourselves.

fERRIS

It's not too late Cris. You can

save her.

CRIS

I'm planning on it.

129.

Soldier

He's heading this way.

WiSDOM (o.S.)

Johnson, this is Wisdom. It's 5:55.

You have five minutes to turn

yourself in...

Wisdom (o.S.)

Or your worst nightmare will

happen.

WisDOM (o.S.)

Look ahead if you don't believe me.

SnAPBACK TO:

SnAPBACK TO:

130.

SnAPBACK TO:

CRIS

Get out!

feRRIS

It's going off in ten seconds!

131.

132.

TV NewsCASTER (o.S.)

The situation in Chicago is not

quite as severe as in the other

nine cities where the dirty bombs

exploded, as prevailing winds blew

the nuclear waste across Lake

Michigan rather than straight into

town. Radiation levels in Detroit,

on the other hand, may require the

entire city to be evacuated.

LIZ

This is what they wanted you to

prevent?

CRIS

I guess...

LIZ

And you wouldn't help?

CRIS

They didn't explain. They were

trying to force me.

CrIS

They were gonna make me a slave.

CRIS

Liz? Where are you going?

Liz

To the doctor.

NEAL

She's not coming with us?

133.

SNAPBACK TO:

FeRRIS

Ferris.

Cris (o.c.)

This is Cris Johnson.

FERRIS

Where did you get this number?

CrIS

I want to cooperate.

FERRIS

That's music to my ears.

CRIS

But I have conditions.

FERRIS

I'm sure we can work something out.

CRIS

Liz...

134.

LiZ

Come back to bed.

CRIS

I can't. - I have to go.

LIZ

(incredulous)

You're not leaving?

CRIS

There's something I have to do.

Something you'd want me to do. And

I can't put it off any longer.

LIZ

(wounded)

Fine. Then go. What do I care?

CRIS

Liz, it's not like that. I searched

for you for a long time. I want to

be with you forever.

LIZ

Don't overdo it. We just met last

night.

CRIS

But a lot has happened since then.

LIZ

While I was sleeping?

CRIS

We're going to have a child.

LIZ

Then you really are an angel.

CRIS

I don't expect you to believe me.

But when you do find out, remember

that we came together for a reason.

That this wasn't just...one night.

It was a special chance for both of

us.

135.

LIZ

Then why are you running away from

me?

CRIS

I'm not...I'm taking the long way

around.

LIZ

I don't understand. We got off to

such a great start.

CRIS

And I looked for a happy ending...

But this was the best I could do.

LIZ

See ya?

CRIS

I wouldn't be surprised.

Ferris

Mr. Johnson, we meet at last.

136.

CRIS

I wasn't ready till now.

FERRIS

We don't have time to waste. Maybe

you could start by telling me how

your talent works.

CRIS

"The future ain't what it used to

be." Ever hear that expression?

CRIS (v.O.)

It's a joke, but it's true. The

future changes every time you look

at it. Because you looked at it.

Cause once you see it, you're

different. And that changes

everything else.

FADE OUT
