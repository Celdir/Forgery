BLACK. THE SOUND OF CHANNELS BEING TURNED ON A TV. TITLE UP:

"SOME TIME AGO".

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

It's hard for us here to believe

what we're reporting to you, but it

does seem to be a fact.

CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS.

On it, in BLACK & WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

Bodies of the recently dead are

returning to life and attacking the

living.

CLICK! With each CLICK, the TV disappears, then reappears in

a new position ON SCREEN. CREDITS ROLL in the surrounding

BLACK.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

Murder victims have shown signs of

having been partially devoured by

their murderers.

CLICK! ANOTHER NEWSCASTER is on the TV now, sitting in a more

modern studio. The broadcast remains in BLACK & WHITE.

SECOND NEWSCASTER

Because of the obvious threat to

untold numbers of citizens, due

to the crisis that is now

developing this radio station will

remain on the air day and night.

CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled.

SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

It has been established that persons

who have recently died have been

returning to life and eating the

flesh of the living.

CLICK!

SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

We must not be lulled by the

concept that these are our family

members or our friends. They are not.

They must be destroyed on sight.

CLICK! A THIRD NEWSCASTER, more haggard than the others, sits

at an ANCHOR DESK on a barren set, still in BLACK & WHITE.

2.

THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

Every dead body that is not

exterminated becomes one of them.

It gets up and kills. The people it

kills get up and kill. They kill

for one reason. They kill for food.

CLICK!

THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

If this situation is allowed to

continue, there will be nothing

left. Nothing.

CLICK!

THIRD NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)

It's over. Finished. Finished. It's

their world now.

CLICK! IN ABSOLUTE BLACK, A SINGLE WORD FADES UP: "TODAY". A

SOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft.

Metallic. It makes us nervous.

EXT. UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

1                                                                1

IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American

town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops

whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES,

SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST

EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit.

Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark.

TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues.

Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling

around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with

a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to

make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player,

who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where

that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK.

A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are

the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town

itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO.

MIKE (O.S.)

They're trying to be us.

RILEY (O.S.)

They used to be us.

RILEY

(Worried) They're learning how to be

us again.

RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made

rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough

exterior. MIKE CONVERSE, 21, young and unseasoned, has the

eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned.

MIKE

o way. Some germ or some devil got

them things up and walkin'. But

there's a big difference between

them and us. They're dead!

3                                                                3

EXT. "UNIONTOWN TEXACO" - NIGHT

DEAD TEENAGE COUPLE walks hand-in-hand near the gas pumps

of a defunct TEXACO STATION. The boy steps on the little hose

that BINGS when a car pulls in. Out of the building comes...

...AN ATTENDANT. It was once tall and handsome. Now his face

is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried

blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm

was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to

work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG

DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as

if searching for a car to fill with gas. There is none.

MIKE (O.S.)

It's like they're pretending to be

alive.

RILEY

Isn't that what we're doing, son?

Pretending to be alive?

THE SOUND OF GROANING WOOD as THREE heavily-armed GUERILLAS

push a large CRATE over a PRECIPICE into a deep GARBAGE PIT

below. FIVE SIMILAR CRATES lie amid the rubble.

Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie

everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads

show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which...

...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from

the bottom of the pit toward...

(

4.

...CHOLO DeMORA, a Latino in his 20s, handsome, roguish, and

confident...a bit too confident. He reaches over his shoulder

and unstraps a CROSSBOW.

CHOLO

Poor bastard.

WFFFFT! Cholo shoots the skeleton. His arrow goes completely

through the WHITE SKULL.

EXT. MOVING VAN - NIGHT

6                                                                  6

The doors of a beat-up WHITE MOVING VAN open. Cholo reaches

in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers ANOTHER CRATE.

GUERILLA

Whole lotta trash this week.

CHOLO

That's life, brother. A whole

lotta trash.

As the men tip the crate onto a dolly, MAGGOTS are revealed

in the darkness beneath, squirming in a POOL OF BLOOD.

(What's in that crate?)

7                                                                  7

EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

RILEY and MIKE watch THREE DEAD THINGS lumber toward them

from the town below.

ILEY

They know we're here. They can

smell life. Smell blood.

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY replaces the nozzle in the

gas pump. Sensing something, it looks around. Up. His dead

eyes lock on Riley's. Big Daddy grunts. Responding to him...

EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

9                                                                  9

...the THREE DEAD THINGS move up the hillside with more

determination.

RILEY

Glancing at Mike's guns) You any

good with those?

MIKE

Dunno. It's my first trip. Never

had to use `em before.

5.

RILEY

Great. I'm out here with a guy who

can't shoot. Let's go.

iley FIRES four more times. THREE BULLETS RIP into the

ike looks at Riley.

M

IKE

Jesus. You can't shoot, neither!

10                                                               10

CHARLIE

Tcha doin', Riley?

RILEY

Havin' a bad dream.

CHARLIE

I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just

look at me, you can tell that I

have terrible dreams.

6.

RILEY

The town is full of walkers.

CHARLIE

Every town is full of walkers.

RILEY

These aren't just walking. They're

like...regular folks.

CHARLIE

But they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead

folks is near as dumb as me!

RILEY

You learned how to make yourself

useful. That's what they're doing.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

They dumped the trash. Cholo's on

his way.

Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the

voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what

looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with

a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black

leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back.

MIKE

(Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame?

RILEY

This one is. Last one was a guy.

MIKE

What happened to him?

Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE

encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket.

PRETTY BOY

I kept his jacket. For good luck.

MIKE

Luck?

RILEY

Put some flowers in the graveyard.

Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the

control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be

felt as much as heard as...

CHARLIE

(Looking up) `Flowers in the

graveyard'. Why do you call `em

that, Riley? I don't get it. These

here flowers ain't the kind you lay

down on the ground. These here are

sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.

R

ILEY

I love ya, Charlie. Know why?

Cuzz you still believe in heaven.

HOLO

You guys scope out the town?

RILEY

Looks like nobody's hit it before.

HOLO

CHARLIE

Always ready. Just look at me

CHOLO

Let's go have some fun.

RILEY

ILEY

We go in, do our job, and get out,

any fuck-ups on my last day out here.

C

HOLO

CHOLO (CONT'D)

YEEEE-HAAAAAAAA!

CHARLIE

What'd he do, hit the lottery or

RILEY

Somethin'. (Wondering) Somethin'.

MIKE

Do those things really work?

RILEY

Yup. (Almost sadly) Stenches can't

take their eyes off `em.

I thought it was gonna be a battle.

This is a fucking massacre.

HOLO

(Through an open hatch) Kid, these

You can't keep `em from wantin' to

get some chuckles.

iley gives Cholo an irritated look.

CHOLO (CONT'D)

Hey, not me, Boss. You told me not

to have any fun, I'm not having any

fun at all. (To Mike) Come with me,

kid. I'll show you the ropes.

RILEY

ILEY'S VOICE comes over one Guerilla's hand-held radio.

RILEY (O.S. RADIO FILTER)

How's the food?

GUERILLA #1

(Into his radio) Lousy, but there's

lots of it.

17                                                               17

A FOOT KICKS the Zombie off Cholo, who looks up to see...

...RILEY extending a hand to help him to his feet.

RILEY

Close one.

CHOLO

I'm still here, ain't I?

Everyone relaxes. Cholo picks up the case of Dom. The others

head toward the front of the store.

TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past. In the gloom

behind stacks of cartons...

...A DEAD HAND appears. Reaching.

CHOLO

Shit! Look out, kid!

The hand grabs Mike around the ankle! Mike turns, raising his

gun. Too late.

A DEAD UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, the skin on half its face STRIPPED

DOWN TO BONE, RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth!

ike SCREAMS, staggers into a wall, and drops to a seated

position on the floor. Riley and Charlie spin around at the

sound of his cry. Cholo, closest to Mike, pulls his crossbow

and fires an arrow through the Zombie's head.

C

HOLO

Fuckin' rookies.

Cholo tucks away the crossbow, grabs a box of Cohibas off a

counter, and runs outside with Foxy. Riley goes to Mike.

ILEY

(Kneeling) It's alright, son.

You're gonna be alright.

MIKE

No. I'm dead. You get bit by one

f those things and you become what

they are.

Riley wraps a strong arm around Mike and lifts him. Mike

quickly plants the barrel of his .45 under his chin and...

BLOWS HIS OWN BRAINS OUT!

iley, stunned, lets the corpse slide to the floor. He looks

into the rookie's open eyes, devastated.

iley lunges at Cholo, takes hold of his shirt, and SLAMS

him against the wall.

RILEY

The fuck are you turning into, man?

CHOLO

e take money to do nasty shit.

Shit that nobody else is dumb

enough to do. We go in knowing the

risks. The kid did too. His number

came up, that's all.

RILEY

We take the risk to bring in things

people need. Not to make a few

extra bucks selling liquor. You

used to know that.

CHOLO

Everybody makes their own way.

verybody makes their own

holo shrugs out of Riley's grasp. Behind them, the guerillas

continue to unload cargo.

CHOLO (CONT'D)

CHARLIE

Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just

ook at me, you can tell I could

RILEY

Later. Gotta see a man about a car.

(

20.

Charlie follows Riley, who strides into...

...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking

REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands

on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him.

He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.

MULLIGAN

Irish accent) How long are you

gonna let him push you around? If

there was enough of us...if you all

would join up with us...we could

pull him down off his throne!

Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes

to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away.

RILEY

You can't fix a place like this,

Mulligan. You just have to get out

of it.

MULLIGAN

We've got the firepower, Riley. If

you and your friends would come in

with us, we'd be unstoppable.

Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to

Charlie, who takes a swig.

RILEY

Everyone's stoppable.

We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN

stands behind him, looking feverish.

MULLIGAN

You alright, son?

BRIAN

I'm fine, dad.

As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his

pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm.

RILEY

Antibiotics. For your boy.

Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand.

When he looks up again, Riley is gone.

She resumes her SCREAMING.

In the kitchen, the Young Man is slicing through the rope

when his DEAD FATHER'S EYES POP OPEN! The Young Man is too

busy with the rope to notice. THE HANGED MAN'S EYES BLINK.

Once. Twice. Three times. Its body TWITCHES. And then...

...the Hanged Man turns, making a move on the Young Man. The

motion increases the strain on the light fixture, which pulls

away, SPARKING, from the ceiling and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR,

along with the Hanged Man and his son.

The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. The woman

stops her screaming. Almost as soon as she does, a SNARL can

be heard from the kitchen, followed by another SCREAM, this

one coming from the Young Man.

Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a

MATCHLIGHT, which looks like a pistol, but shoots FIRE from

its tip. He approaches the kitchen, using the FLAME to light

his way. In the FLICKERING GLOW, he sees...

...the Young Man lying on the floor. CHUNKS have been bitten

out of his neck and wrist. The body is CONVULSING in the last

moments of life. THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head

with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. The

woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway.

CHOLO

Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he

go? Where'd the other guy go?

Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head.

SHUFFLING sounds. He follows them to the other end of the

kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.

The sounds are LOUDER here. Cholo lifts the poker, ready to

strike. Just as he does...

24.

...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY

GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand.

SECURITY GUARD

(To Cholo) Drop it!

Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.

CHOLO

Hey, no problem.

TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front

door and rush into the kitchen.

CHOLO (CONT'D)

No problem, no problem! But there

is a problem. There's a dead guy

walkin' around in here.

THE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the

guards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK,

including the EYE.

Before his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM

HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man.

WOMAN

YOU SELFISH BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME

ALONE HERE!

She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work.

The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his

legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him,

BITING HIM again and again.

Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man.

BITTEN SECURITY GUARD

I need help. I need help!

Cholo kills the bitten security guard, too.

SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD

You...FUCK!

Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard.

CHOLO

You wanna talk about this? I did

what I had to do. I only did what I

had to do!

RILEY

What's on the menu today? Cat or

TOUT

I told you. Today it's something

new.

CLANG! Another gate opens in the cage. A hush falls as

everyone awaits what will come. Including the Dead Men, who

gaze with anticipation at the opening. What comes is...

..A WOMAN! Alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters.

Despite tarnish, she still looks sexy. Last night she was a

hooker known as SLACK. Now she's meat in a lion cage.

RILEY

Jesus fucking Christ.

The gate SLAMS shut. The Dead Things walk toward the woman.

Riley rushes off. Charlie follows.

S

lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and, terrified,

starts to circle its iron perimeter. The Dead Men flank her.

Black is the first to touch her. The crowd HOWLS.

lack's terror turns to determination. She punches Black

three times in the face. The Thing recoils as she glides out

of its grasp.

RILEY and CHARLIE reach the BRUISERS who took their weapons.

RILEY

Give us our guns.

BRUISER

(Handing over the weapons) You

leavin'?

Riley cocks his M-16.

T

28.

RILEY

In a little while.

In the ring, BLACK reaches for SLACK again. With one

lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it

flying into Red's arms. Red shoves Black aside.

Black makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival.

This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around

in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match.

Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb.

She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES

with the force of...

...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh.

On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push

through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON

steps in front of them.

GOON

No guns in here!

Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.

S

lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but

Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming

her to the ground.

Black hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite,

RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's

collarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops.

Red lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST.

he crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE

BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by...

...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of

the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a

steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his

trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16.

Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES

PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock

misses Charlie completely.

Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just

on the other side of the bars.

R

ILEY

You okay?

F

C

29.

She nods gratefully.

hihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed.

Not because of the holes in his gut, but because...

CHIHUAHUA

My suit! You fucked up my new suit!

Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the

M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack

delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending

Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from...

...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK!

Spun around by the impact, she falls face down.

Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets

PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps

coming, keeps FIRING, until...

...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He

drops like a broken pinata.

Riley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's

GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is

going to break out. But before it does...

POLICEMAN (O.S.)

Hold it!

.

..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons.

Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest

gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor.

He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects

worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.

SLACK

I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!

Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting

position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder.

SLACK (CONT'D)

ucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty.

They look into each other's eyes.

ILHOUETTED MAN

How was Uniontown?

CHOLO

Dead.

SILHOUETTED MAN

Death intrudes on us even in the

Green, I'm afraid. I heard about

what happened with my neighbors.

I'm grateful for your help.

CHOLO

to drink out of a glass.

CHOLO

Nope. I left it in the bank. Your

bank. With all my other dough.

rom all those other nights. I got

enough now to buy me a place.

SILHOUETTED MAN

You mean here? In the Green?

The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively

dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down

the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper

champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling

politely at Cholo.

KAUFMAN

I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but

there's a very long waiting list.

CHOLO

How long?

KAUFMAN

This is an extremely desirable

location. Space is limited.

CHOLO

You mean restricted.

KAUFMAN

Well, I do have a board of

directors, a membership committee

that has to approve...

A wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over Cholo's face.

No, no, no. Three years! Three

years I been cleaning up after you,

taking out your garbage, and you

tell me I'm not good enough? You're

the one who's no good. You are no

fucking good. And you are gonna let

me in. You know why? Because I know

what goes on around here. How many

of your fucking "members" know

what's in that garbage I take out

for you?

CHOLO (CONT'D)

when you're less excited.

RILEY

(To Slack) Why you? In that arena.

Why did the little fat man throw

you in with those things?

SLACK

It wasn't the little man. It was the

big man. The man upstairs. He's got

his fingers in everything down here.

If you can drink it, shoot it up,

fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs

to him. He's just seein' that we get

a few cheap kicks so we don't go

thinkin' too hard about why he's

eating steak and the rest of us are

lucky to get the bones.

RILEY

Same question. Why you?

SLACK

They found out I was working with

Mulligan and his people. Tired of

eatin' off Cbones.

HARLIE

What can you do? Every place is the

same.

RILEY

people. North. Canada.

Green. Till somebody figured I'd be

a better hooker than a soldier.

RILEY

I don't need to hear your story.

Everybody's got a story, and I'm

tired of hearin' them all!

SLACK

What's your story, Riley?

They look at each other, clearly attracted.

R

ILEY

I said everybody has a story. That

was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy

was a preacher. Mama kept the

house. School. Engineering. Nothing

bad ever happened to me...(turning

away)...till everything changed.

LACK

Everything changed for all of us.

Whether we had a story or not.

A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars.

CHARLIE

Hey...

Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are

chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like

an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.

RILEY

Mulligan.

RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but

there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.

HARLIE

What are they gonna do? Kill him?

SLACK

Not right away. First, they'll try

to get what they can out of him.

About people like me.

Riley puts his hand on her back.

Money. I want my money out of your

don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow

you out of your fuckin' ivory

tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.

that belongs to us. The vehicle you

designed, Mister Denbo. Dead

second in command. I want him

captured. Or killed. And I want my

two-million-dollar piece of

equipment returned.

get close enough to...do what has

to be done. (Refilling his scotch)

Do this for me and I'll grant you

something in return. Residence in

Not me. That's what Cholo wanted,

and you didn't give it to him, did

you? That's why he's out there

waving a cannon at your ass.

Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him

with a glimmer of respect.

When the truck pulled out, it must

have knocked the fence down. That's

how they got in.

RILEY

That fencing was pushed in from

outside.

TEAHOUSE

You know how many stenches it

would take to do that?

RILEY

There's a thousand of them out

there for every one of us.

CHARLIE

Good thing we're smarter.

SLACK

Look who's talkin'.

RILEY

They're getting smart. I saw it in

Uniontown, last time out. They're

learning how to work together.

Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker,

virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the

WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood.

TEAHOUSE

What do they want?

Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down

another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a

suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow

of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE.

SLACK

They want the city.

RILEY

The city is us. They're after us. We

pissed `em off one too many times.

it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING!

he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle,

their backs to each other, guns searching for a target.

Darting eyes peer into the void. MORE NOISES emanate from

somewhere. Everywhere. Slowly...

...Charlie unstraps his Remington. Licks his thumb. Wets the

sight of the rifle.

LACK

(A whisper) Why do you do that?

CHARLIE

(Whispering back) Catches the

light. Right now it's moonlight.

Lets me see where I'm aimin'.

BLAM! Charlie FIRES! A single shot into the black smoke.

SLACK

The hell you shooting at?

CHARLIE

That thing.

A

DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it

grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls

away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the

left side of the Thing's forehead.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

ff-center. But I got him.

The Thing relaxes its grip and drops at Slack's feet.

ANOLETE

(Hysterical) There's more of `em out

there. I can hear `em. THERE'S MORE!

There are SHUFFLING SOUNDS in the smoke. Manolete backs away.

Pillsbury grabs him. Slaps him, hard, across the face.

harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. What

he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him...

..a FEMALE WALKER, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants

of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke.

The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one

else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite...

BLAM! Slack SHOOTS! Her bullet cuts closer than the one

Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before

DROPPING THE BRIDE.

SLACK

CHARLIE

Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you!

Manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash.

RILEY

Hurry up.

PILLSBURY

(Impatient) Yellow to red!

TEAHOUSE

What the fuck does a Samoan know

about hot-wiring cars?

PILLSBURY

Five thousand cars. Stole. Every

Fifty thousand in Mexico.

PILLSBURY

Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got

five thousand. Every one. Stolen.

THE T-BIRD'S ENGINE REVS.

MANOLETE

I GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get

out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by

the door...

...SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder. It's a

FOREARM! It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him.

TEAHOUSE

God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?!

Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly,

the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A

twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping

the limb loosely attached to...

...A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird. Lifting

itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE

M

SHOOTS it.

anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...VROOOOOM!...pedal

to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at

Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley.

SLACK

(Softly) How long does he have?

RILEY

I had a brother. Real brother, by

birth. Bit. Hung on for six days.

Before he turned. I was the one had

to shoot him.

SLACK

And you said nothin' bad ever

happened to you.

That happened to my brother.

AUFMAN

I recognize that some of you are

concerned. We've been threatened by

a disgruntled employee. I've sent

people out to take care of the

problem. However, should something

go wrong, I want to assure you that

measures have been taken. I've

established outposts. With food and

supplies to support us on our way.

C

LIFF

On our way? To where?

KAUFMAN

Alternate sites have been chosen.

Air transport has been arranged.

For us and our families. As well as

necessary support personnel.

What about all the others?

AUFMAN

All the others can be replaced.

LIFF

But...

KAUFMAN

Cliff, let me talk to you for a

moment.

51.

...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket

doors made of sandblasted glass. Sutherland and the others

can't hear, but can see, Kaufman and Cliff in SILHOUETTE.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS: Kaufman leans close to Cliff,

smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

You interrupted me. I was just

talking about how people can be

replaced. You don't want to be

replaced, do you?

CLIFF

(

Nervous) No.

KAUFMAN

No, and I don't want to replace

you. You have promise. A day may

come when you earn yourself some

responsibilities. Right now, the

responsibilities are mine. All

the responsibilities. It was my

ingenuity that took an old world

and made it into something new. I

put up fences to make it safe. I

hired soldiers and paid for their

training. I keep the people on the

streets away from us by giving them

their games and vices. It costs me

money! But I spend it because the

responsibility is mine! Now do you

understand "responsibility"?

CLIFF

Yes, but...

KAUFMAN

No buts.

CLIFF

But...

Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling

again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An

armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside.

KAUFMAN

Take him out with the rest of the

garbage. I won't be needing this

man anymore.

RILEY

I made a deal with your boss. Find

Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from

blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do

it, I don't want people to get hurt.

Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry.

That's where I stop. I didn't ask him

for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.

I've got the guns. I've got the ammo.

And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm

taking it to Canada. If any of you

Pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.

Charlie pulls his .45.

Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game

Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP.

RILEY (CONT'D)

Take a right onto Route Six.

Slack pulls out.

SLACK

This is what you were thinking

about all along. You got me out

here figuring I'm a boy scout, and

now you're telling me we're just

stealing a fucking car?

ILEY

You have a problem with that?

SLACK

No. I like the way you think.

HARLIE

I like the way he thinks, too.

Just look at me you can tell I

like the way he thinks.

RILEY

Take another right.

SLACK

How do you know which way you're

going?

Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT

shifts onto another MAP.

RILEY

I built a homing device into Dead

Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within

fifty miles, we can track him.

...TWO STEEL LOCKING RINGS swing up to cap the cannons. Just

beyond the barrels we see MANOLETE closing in on DEAD

RECKONING, raising his machine gun. A DEAD THING advances

behind him.

107                                                             107

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO charges RILEY. Grabs him around the throat.

CHOLO

Fix it!

RILEY

Not a chance.

Riley tosses the "Game Boy" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches

out after it.

MANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open

hatch. Where CHOLO is standing.

Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine

gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT!

RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from

the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder.

The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in

the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker,

destroying it.

FOXY, distracted by the mayhem, lets CHARLIE get the drop on

him. ANCHOR and SCAR go for their guns. RILEY unslings his

M-16 and holds them at bay.

RILEY

Easy boys.

Riley looks at the clock on the control panel. 12:01. Charlie

follows his gaze.

CHARLIE

Geez. We just made it.

Riley CLICKS the transmitter on.

RILEY

Riley Denbo calling the Green.

INT. PENTHOUSE CORRIDOR - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT

BING! KAUFMAN steps off the elevator, carrying his two Prada

bags full of money. A TWO-WAY RADIO in his pocket RINGS.

KAUFMAN

(Into radio, urgent) Yes?

RILEY (O.S.)

We got Cholo.

KAUFMAN

(Sagging with relief) I owe you,

Mister Denbo.

KAUFMAN rushes in with his bags, dropping them beside other

luggage that is already packed.

KNIPP

(Frightened) Mister Kaufman, sir. I

dunno what's happening, sir, but it

sounds bad.

68.

The windows are sealed so the NOISE Kaufman hears is MUFFLED,

but it is definitely the SOUND OF DISORDER. He goes to a

window. Looks down and sees...

...flashes of LIGHT from gunfire. SMOKE rising from an

EXPLOSION. PEOPLE running. THE DEAD swarming into the city

like ants. A war has begun.

EXT. ROOFTOP - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT

SUTHERLAND stands at the edge of the roof, looking down at

what Kaufman just saw.

SUTHERLAND

All this time Kaufman's been

worried about a revolution on the

streets. He never thought it would

come from across the river.

Sutherland, STYLES, OTHER BOARD MEMBERS, and their FAMILIES

get into the TWO HELICOPTERS.

THE SOUND OF RUMBLING. The CEILING VIBRATES, knocking tear-

shaped baubles off a CHANDELIER. The SOUND BUILDS in

intensity. Then suddenly eases off. Through the window,

KAUFMAN sees the things that caused the rumbling...

...TWO HELICOPTERS, SOARING off into the night.

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

No. No. They can't leave. Not

without me!

KNIPP

I think they just did, sir.

RILEY jumps out onto the street where CHOLO lies, bleeding

from the top of his left shoulder.

CHOLO

I hate you, Riley. There's

something about you I've always

fucking hated.

RILEY

(Smiling) Same here.

SLACK

Riley. Look out there.

69.

Riley looks where SLACK is pointing. From across the river

comes a flickering ORANGE GLOW.

Riley moves to a spot where he can see between the houses on

the hillside. In the distance, FIRE rises from the city.

Cholo sits up, cackling.

CHOLO

I didn't have to blow the fucking

place up. Somebody else did for me!

RILEY

(Stunned) The stenches. They got

across the river. They got across

the fucking river. (To the others)

Get him inside.

PILLSBURY steps in and lifts Cholo easily to his feet.

CHOLO

Wait, wait, wait. What are we

doin'? Where we goin'?

RILEY

Back to the city.

CHOLO

Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?

I'll take that.

FOXY

Me, too.

FOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side.

Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at

Cholo and Foxy.

RILEY

You guys'd be safer coming with us.

CHOLO

Nah, you'd never let me have any

fun.

RILEY

T-Bird's down that driveway over

there. Guns and ammo inside.

CHOLO

Thanks.

RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin

where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow.

SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back

her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean

the blood off Riley's neck.

He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.

SLACK

Almost lost you there.

RILEY

I don't get lost so easy. (To

PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across

the water.

PRETTY BOY

The bridges into the city are all

bricked up.

PRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing

the "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" bordered by the rivers and the

barricaded bridges spanning them.

SLACK

We could blast our way through.

RILEY

Don't want to. If the stenches got

in, there's a war going on in the

city. We take any of those bridges

we'll end up right in the middle

of it.

Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the

natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle.

RILEY (CONT'D)

We've gotta come in above the

throat.

His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the

base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the

two rivers.

RILEY (CONT'D)

What was built to keep folks safe

is gonna trap them inside. We've

gotta give them a way out.

In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS

swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven

from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things.

CLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at

the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets,

back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at

him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away.

119                                                            119

EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

CHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER

lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.

HOLO

I got it.

WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow.

HOLO (CONT'D)

Come on, let's go.

He slaps a hand on Foxy's back.

XCEPT IT'S NOT FOXY! It's ANOTHER WALKER that has moved

between the two men. It grabs the hand that slapped him and

BITES it.

HOLO

AHHH...FUCK!

Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker.

Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls

a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH

THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an

ominous silence.

HOLO (CONT'D)

I can't fucking believe it. (A sad

chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's

like...the world is spinning around

EXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

RILEY ducks under a caution gate at the entrance to the

bridge and starts across the roadway. Behind him...

...SLACK and CHARLIE stand, weapons ready, eyes alert for

danger.

As Riley runs...

...SOMETHING SKITTERS across the road, chasing him. Not a

zombie. Much smaller. A RIVER RAT.

Charlie draws his REMINGTON. Wets the sight with his thumb.

BLAM!

Riley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot.

SLACK

You missed.

CHARLIE

Nope. I blew its ass off.

The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet

IT'S STILL RUNNING!

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Just didn't hit it in the head.

74.

SLACK

(Realizing) Jesus. It's dead.

CHARLIE

They all are.

SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS.

Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry

closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off.

The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto

a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow.

Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before...

...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her!

She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to...

...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie

fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD

FLY. But there are too many. He can't shoot them all.

RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting

danger within. He steps through the opening...

...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over

his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a

generator. He flips it. The motor roars to life.

He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It

GROANS from disuse as he pulls it.

RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night.

The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across

the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly.

THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge.

SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned

bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether

holds it within inches of the shore.

Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...

...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting.

Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free.

Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer.

No paddles. The current carrying her away.

and sees...

...SLACK being taken downstream.

EXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

RILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by...

...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing

his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge.

Riley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward

the gearworks and...

...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It

drops with a PLUNK into the river below.

131                                                           131

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

SLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins

to paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long

and slimy. It looks like a snake!

But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on.

Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope

to become taut.

A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER!

Slack SCREAMS.

It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats

off on the current.

he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore.

Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until...

...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding

herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The

river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley

and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's

in the war zone.

THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles

up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE.

R

ILEY

Bring her over as soon as you can!

Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING.

Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and...

...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side.

He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward

Slack and the city.

133                                                              133

EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - NIGHT

SLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN

HIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a

panic. Slack grabs him.

SLACK

Brian!

BRIAN

We can't get out! There's no way out!

SLACK

There will be. Come with me.

BRIAN

Daddy! Daddy's still locked up.

Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by

canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As

MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole...

...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the

ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls"

roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.

S

ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the

street. One   of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks

against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker

is engulfed   in flames.

Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness. He lifts his

rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head.

B

77.

Big Daddy walks to the manhole. TOOLS are strewn around it,

pickaxes, sledges, chainsaws, and a pneumatic hammer which is

lying on the street...RATTATATTAT...still running.

Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLER'S GREEN SKYSCRAPER. His goal.

Finally in reach.

He looks down at the pneumatic hammer, and picks it up by the

handle. With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand, Big Daddy

walks toward the building.

He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord

is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer

stops running. Big Daddy looks at it. Puzzles over its

stillness for a moment. Then...

...he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by

guards. Doors that are made of glass.

The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple

by a MILITIAMAN.

UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA! The Militiaman FLIES BACK. It wasn't he

who fired. It was NUMBER NINE, standing nearby with her M-16.

The Militiaman lies on the ground, his dead eyes staring at

Number NINE in utter surprise.

Seeing what has happened, ANOTHER SOLDIER grabs a grenade,

pulls the pin, and is about to toss it at Big Daddy when...

...his HAND IS CUT OFF at the wrist by a meat clever held by

THE BUTCHER. The Soldier's hand, still clutching the grenade,

PLOPS into the street. The Soldier looks down in horror, then

collapses on top of his hand. A MUFFLED EXPLOSION makes jelly

of his mid-section.

Big Daddy continues to walk toward the building, carrying the

pneumatic hammer, as OTHER DEAD THINGS collect sledges,

pickaxes, lengths of pipe, and follow their leader.

KAUFMAN and KNIPP, carrying the Prada duffles, rush out of an

Kaufman FIRES THREE ROUNDS at the men! He's not a marksman,

but ONE of the GUARDS is WINGED. Whirls around and levels his

M-16 at Kaufman.

SECURITY GUARD

YOU STUPID OLD FUCK!

He's about to fire when Knipp steps in front of Kaufman.

KNIPP

gun hand) Boss? Don't you shoot,

ECURITY GUARD

The Guard takes off after his comrades.

CHOLO (O.S.)

Kaufman spins around to see CHOLO walking toward him across

the atrium.

CHOLO (CONT'D)

man, so I don't care about nothin'

no more. Still care about you,

though. I wanna make sure you come

BIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic

hammer to POUND at the safety glass.

aufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door.

Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left

calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his

gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman.

NIPP

Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let

us get out of here.

CHOLO

(Calmly reloading) You can go,

Knipp, but not him.

Kaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads

for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees.

CRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the

first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter;

it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin

plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND!

Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into

something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic

hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft.

Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through.

Kaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another

arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder.

AUFMAN

You fucking spic bastard!

CHOLO

I think we should talk when you're

a little less excited.

Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his

teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as...

CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More

HANDS POKE through.

aufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping

their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.

The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to

lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds.

ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one

in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing

eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired.

It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead.

Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see...

BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and

FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing

DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but

it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose.

Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's

not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.

K

NIPP

Boss. We gotta get outa here!

Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The

moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them,

moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is

still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.

TH-BOOOOM! The roadbed of the drawbridge drops into place.

VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING rumbles across the span.

KEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN

pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan

embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack.

MULLIGAN

(To his men) Let's go get our guns,

boys.

EXT. NEAR THE "THROAT" - NIGHT

137                                                           137

ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees...

...the "THROAT", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is

trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers

of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them.

There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The

fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED.

Terrible SCREAMS fill the air.

Riley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines,

the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as...

..a DEAD THING looms three feet away. Riley lifts his pistol

and puts a shell through the thing's skull. Blood flies,

taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by...

...the glare of DEAD RECKONING'S approaching headlights. The

dead thing falls to the road, where...

...it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous

treads. Riley stands right in the vehicle's path.

PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY looms larger and larger as the

vehicle closes in. He doesn't move. PRETTY BOY tries to turn

the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!

HARLIE

(Pure anguish) RILEY!

Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across

the windshield, climbing up toward...

EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

139                                                           139

...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.

ILEY

We gotta blow the fences!

PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

Johnson's are loaded!

RILEY

Yeah, but they're capped!

The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped.

DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of

the cannon barrels.

WHAM! A WALKER grabs him by the leg from the road. Riley

blasts him with his .45. As OTHER WALKERS approach, he shoots

them with one hand, Rusing the other to uncap the cannon.

ILEY

Number One is clear! I'm going for

Number Two!

tanding ASTRIDE the vehicle, riding it as if it were a

living beast, Riley picks some of them of with his .45.

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

140                                                             140

FOOTSTEPS ECHO as KNIPP, carrying one of the Prada duffles,

helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING

GARAGE, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the SOUNDS

of distant SCREAMING. Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the

shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder.

The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN. Knipp BEEPS the doors

open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in

the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a

scotch from the built-in bar.

Knipp starts the engine. The SOUND ECHOES big-time in the

concrete tomb.

NIPP

(Looking at the fuel gauge) We

eed gas.

Kaufman moans. Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through

the shadows, pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base

of a RAMP that leads up to the street. Knipp pushes a button

that pops open the gas tank. He shuts the engine off and gets

out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them.

H

e slides the Mag-Card into a slot, activating the pump. An

LED scrolls "Thank you, Mr. Kaufman". Knipp pulls the nozzle.

Freezes when he hears...

...FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. A DARK FIGURE is approaching through

the shadows.

nipp drops the nozzle. Ducks into the car. SLAMS the door.

WHAM! A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window.

A FACE leans in behind the hand. A face full of rage. BIG

DADDY'S FACE.

AUFMAN

Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!

L

83.

KNIPP

You didn't gimme no gun, sir.

Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see

inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear

windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the

rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs.

It's the man who shot him.

The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand

drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit..."Texaco". He moves

deliberately toward the pump.

KAUFMAN

Pull out! PULL OUT!

K

NIPP

Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump.

Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling

the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts.

The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.

Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy

POUNDS on the windshield, three times, before the SAFETY

GLASS COBWEBS. He POKES the nozzle through the flexible

fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. Gasoline FLOODS

into the car.

KNIPP (CONT'D)

ord!

TCHUNG! Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open. As Knipp

tries to run, he is GRABBED by Big Daddy.

KNIPP (CONT'D)

ORD!

Big Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him

aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman,

cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and,

surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street.

The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield.

Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into

the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle

out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas

in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs

the keys. As he starts back toward the car...

...WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's

one of the WALKING DEAD. It's...

...CHOLO.

aufman shakes his head in disbelief.

KAUFMAN

N-no, y-you're dead. (Realization

dawning) Oh my God. You're dead!

THE CHOLO THING reaches for Kaufman, vengeance in its eyes.

aufman breaks for the driver's door. He never makes it. The

Cholo Thing grabs him and SLAMS him down across the hood.

Leans over him. Opens a drooling mouth. Kaufman whimpers.

B

RRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball.

Kaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT,

rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire

ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked

Kaufman, and...

...WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The

FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating

HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air.

HROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see...Big Daddy is almost smiling.

DEAD RECKONING approaches the electrified fences from beyond.

PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

Get back! Get back! We're gonna

blow the fences!

The CROWD screams and starts to clear the area.

CHARLIE works a joystick. The cannon turret GRINDS above.

He takes aim at an area of the fences that is rapidly

emptying of people.

43      EXT. THE "THROAT" - NIGHT                                143

The fourteen-incher turns toward the fences. RILEY rides it.

RILEY

Shoot!

Riley leaps down. The instant he's clear...

KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. The ELECTRIFIED FENCES are BLOWN APART.

n the dissipating SMOKE, RILEY is the first one through the

opening. Within seconds, CITIZENS start toward it, heading

the other way. Riley finds himself running against the tide.

Searching. Desperately searching. Behind the surging crowd...

...WALKERS appear, grabbing people. Dropping them to the

ground. Eating them.

iley FIRES in all directions. WALKERS DROP around him. He

saves a WOMAN with a BABY...a YOUNG COUPLE...a PRIEST. CLICK.

He runs out of ammo. WALKERS close in. The situation seems

hopeless until...

144                                                              144

PTOOOM! PTOOOM! FIREWORKS "BLOOM" in the sky.

HE DEAD THINGS gaze upward, mesmerized.

THE HUMANS ESCAPE.

RILEY finds himself standing in the midst of FIFTY WALKERS,

frozen like statues around him.

Other than the intermittent BOOM of the fireworks, SILENCE.

Out of which...

SLACK (O.S.)

(A whisper) Riley.

Riley turns.

Slack emerges from behind one of the immobile dead things.

Riley moves toward her...

...she to him...

...both of them weaving a cautious path between the statues.

They reach each other and embrace, surrounded by dead things

that don't even know they are there.

RATATATATATAT. GUNFIRE EXPLODES around them!

86.

HAPLESS DEAD THINGS are MOWED DOWN the way they were back

in Uniontown. This time by...

...MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES...who slaughter every

zombie in the area. BRIAN is shooting, too, raring to go.

When it's all over...

MULLIGAN

We could still use you, Riley.

Riley looks out at the city, where there is still scattered

distant gunfire. He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's

side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead.

Riley shakes his head.

RILEY

It's all yours, Mulligan.

146                                                                146

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CITY - NIGHT

FIREWORKS EXPLODE. A ZOMBIE looks up toward the "blooms". A

strong hand grabs the collar of its shirt, pulls its gaze

away from the sky, and herds it onward.

The hand is BIG DADDY'S. He herds OTHERS along, too. A small

group of TWO DOZEN, including NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER.

147                                                           147

PRETTY BOY sits at the controls, about to push the firing

button when...

...RILEY grabs her hand.

RILEY

Stop.

Riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the

windshield at BIG DADDY.

RILEY lowers the binoculars.

RILEY

All they want is somewhere to go.

Same as us.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CITY - NIGHT

BIG DADDY leads his band into the future.

DEAD RECKONING rolls into the future, too, but in a different

direction.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHARLIE

Canada. That's where we're goin',

RILEY

If no one has any objections.

ANCHOR, SCAR, and PILLSBURY all shrug. Riley looks at Slack.

SLACK

No, we'll take you along with us.

ILEY

I'll try to make myself useful.

DEAD RECKONING growls off into the early dawn, a lethal
