WAITER

She's waiting for someone.

YOUNGER WAITER

Probably waiting for me.

WAITER

The door's waiting for you if you

don't get back to work.

MESSENGER

C'est vous, Mademoiselle?

2.

CARA

Oui.

ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)

(English accent)

They are following you Cara.

ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

They think you'll lead them to me.

But if you follow my instructions

closely, there is a way for us to

get away...

YOUNGER WAITER

Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie--

ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)

Take the 4:25 Orient Express to

Venice. En route select a man my

approximate height and weight...

3.

ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Have faith Cara. I'll be with you

soon.

WIFE

What are you doing Vincent?   Our

train car is over here!

CONDUCTER (V.O.)

All aboard! All aboard the 4:25

is departing!

4.

CARA

Ow!

FRANK

Sorry!   Excuse me. Pardone moi.

5.

CARA

I think I'm going to need your

help.

FRANK

Hmm?

CARA

My zipper...

(off his blank look)

It's stuck.

FRANK

I'm afraid of hurting you.

CARA

Don't be afraid.

FRANK

I'm... sorry.

CARA

It doesn't matter.

6.

FRANK

Maybe I should let you do this--

CARA

Don't give up so quickly.

CARA (CONT'D)

Thanks.

FRANK

My name is Frank.

CARA

Cara.

STEWARD

(to Frank)

Will you and your wife take dinner

here or in the dining car this

evening, monsieur?

FRANK

Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not

actually--

CARA

The dining car would be lovely,

thank you.

CUT TO:

7.

CARA

Are you ill?

FRANK

What?   No.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Just nervous.    I don't like

travelling.

CARA

(gently mocking)

So you decided to take a holiday

on the Orient Express?

FRANK

I'm on my honeymoon.

CARA

Your honeymoon?

CARA (CONT'D)

Should we ask the waiter to set

another place?

FRANK

She's in Pennsylvania.

8.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You're sure you want to hear this?

CARA

If you'd like to tell me.

FRANK

Two weeks ago she left me. For

the owner of a pizza parlor.

CARA

That's awful.

FRANK

No travel insurance. No refund on

the tickets. So... here I am. On

my honeymoon.

CARA

I'm sorry, Frank.

FRANK

I really loved that pizza too.

"Bala Pizza" if you're ever in

Rosemont.

CARA

I wouldn't touch it.    I'm loyal to

you.

WAITER

A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And

for Monsieur... a "Miller Light."

FRANK

Thanks.

FRANK (CONT'D)

What takes you to Venice?

CARA

You read spy novels.

(playful)

(MORE)

9.

CARA (CONT'D)

I'm a mysterious woman on a train.

You tell me what my story is.

FRANK

Okay... you'd be a diplomatic

attache or... let's see... a girl from

East Germany whose father's been

kidnapped by Soviet agents.

They're blackmailing you into

stealing... probably a microchip.

There's usually a microchip

involved.

CARA

What awaits me?

FRANK

Trouble, certainly.

CARA

Danger?

FRANK

No doubt. You'll probably be shot

at in less than two chapters.

CARA

Is there a man in my life?

CARA (CONT'D)

Or a candidate for the job?

FRANK

Maybe.

CUT TO:

10.

JONES

We're putting a lot resources into

this investigation, John. Tell me

you're going to get him this time.

ACKERMAN

(dry)

We're going to get him this time,

Ms. Jones.

GOYAL

She's on the train. They'll be in

Venice in the morning.

ACKERMAN

Our target's name is Alexander

Pearce. British citizen, born in

London into an ordinary middle

class family. The only thing

remarkable about his childhood was

a preternatural gift for numbers.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Which he used to hack into a

computer and fix the test results

his final year at school.

11.

JEAN LUC

Your mastermind couldn't pass his

exams on his own?

ACKERMAN

He didn't fix his test scores; he

fixed the scores for all the girls

in the class. It made him very

popular.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

(severely)

What started as school pranks

eventually became something much

more serious. After a year in the

training program at Goldman Sachs,

he decided that gambling suited

him better than working for a

living. That, in turn, involved

him with some rather unsavory

people and ultimately led him to

put his financial genius to work

in his true calling: money

laundering.

QUINN

You've assembled quite a task

force to catch a common money

launderer, Mr. Ackerman.

ACKERMAN

There is nothing common about

Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply,

he has turned money laundering

into an art form. His greatest

innovation: The False Lawsuit.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Pearce sets up two companies: one

is a Casino in Arizona for example

and the other is a shell company

in the Cayman Islands.

(MORE)

12.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

The Cayman Islands company files a

lawsuit against the casino,

claiming copyright infringement or

some other complaint. They

"succeed" in winning the case and

the casino pays the shell company

an enormous settlement.

QUINN

(understanding)

The money travels from America to

the Cayman Islands...

ACKERMAN

Yes, but now the money is legal.

JONES

Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has

been cheated out of the revenue.

(beat)

We calculate that Mr. Pearce's tax

bill currently stands at $743.7

million dollars.

JEAN LUC

(whispers in French)

That explains what the American

harridan is doing here.

JONES

Exactement, monsieur.

ACKERMAN

Mr. Pearce has some other debts as

well. Most of you will recognize

Ivan Demidov...

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

...Pearce laundered over a billion

dollars for Demidov. At some

point Pearce decided he'd rather

steal from Demidov than help him

steal.

(MORE)

13.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

(beat)

Given Demidov's ties to organized

crime, I'd say that was a mistake.

JONES

(clears her throat)

The U.S. Government is not

participating in an investigation

of a member of the Russian

parliament; our target is

Alexander Pearce.

ACKERMAN

Of course.

GERMAN INTERPOL

Has Mr. Pearce ever been in

custody?

ACKERMAN

Almost.

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Finally.     Let's go.

14.

SPECIALIST

This is gonna take a few minutes.

CARA

I'll be ready in fifteen minutes.

15.

CARA (CONT'D)

Alexander!

ACKERMAN

Where is he?

16.

ACKERMAN

You have nothing to say?

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Get her out of my sight.

QUINN (V.O.)

What does this Alexander Pearce

look like?

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Nobody knows. He disappeared

after his escape. He's had

extensive plastic surgery to alter

his appearance since then. Drug

lord Amado Carillo did the same

thing in the 90s to successfully

elude authorities.

QUINN

How do you know about it?

ACKERMAN

Pearce worked with no more than a

few accomplices at one time. He

treated them so well that they're

virtually all completely loyal.

None of them would cooperate.

We've questioned the ones we could

find, and the only thing we

learned is that Pearce apparently

arranged it so even his own people

have never seen him after the

surgery.

JEAN LUC

So nobody knows what he looks

like?

17.

ACKERMAN

Correct.

JEAN LUC

Forgive me for saying so Mr.

Ackerman, but he slipped away from

you when you knew his whereabouts

and his appearance...  What makes

you think you can catch him now?

ACKERMAN

His girlfriend was recently

released from custody. He'll come

for her. We'll be waiting.

QUINN

What makes you so certain?

ACKERMAN

He'll come for her.

MATCH CUT TO:

18.

FRANK

I was afraid I'd missed you. I

wanted to ask where you're staying

in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a

shuttle to my hotel but I thought

maybe--

CARA

(without turning)

I've got a better idea.

HARD CUT TO:

19.

CARA

You have a booking in the name of

Mason.

RECEPTIONIST

Si, Signorina.

CARA

Signora. That's my husband.

RECEPTIONIST

Very good, Senora Mason. Welcome

to the Danieli. You are in the

Doge's-- our premiere suite.

(pause)

Is there anything special you

require?

CARA

Have a copy of today's Herald

Tribune sent up to the room

please.

RECEPTIONIST

My pleasure, Signora.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

(in Italian)

Mother of God, what a waste.

20.

PORTER

The bedroom is through here. You

have two bathrooms, here and here.

There is a small kitchen which...

PORTER (CONT'D)

...you may not need. There are two

televisions, video, DVD, radio, hi

fi sound system. And...

PORTER (CONT'D)

Is everything satisfactory?

CARA

Yes. Thank you.

PORTER

Then I will leave you.

21.

CARA

You like it?

FRANK

What's not to like?

CARA

I'd have been bored here on my

own. There's more than enough

room for two.

FRANK

I can see that.

CARA

I didn't ask for an extra bed...

CARA (CONT'D)

Are you all right with the sofa?

If you like, I can have them bring

one up?

FRANK

No, no, no. The sofa's fine.

Perfect in fact.

CARA

The luggage.

FRANK

I'll get it.

22.

FRANK

I've put my things in the other

bathroom.

CARA

Have you ever been to Venice

before?

CARA (CONT'D)

Then we need to go out.

CUT TO:

GOYAL

She's checked into the Danieli...

she's not alone.

ACKERMAN

Good.

(to the room)

Maintain surveillance but keep

your distance.

(MORE)

23.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Don't try to get clever:

remember that Pearce is smarter

than most of you put together.

DEMIDOV

Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I

offer you a glass of Brunello?

It's a '97...

QUINN

No thank you, Mr. Demidov.

DEMIDOV

You know I'd never admit this at

home, but Vodka is for peasants.

There's much we could learn from

the Italians.

24.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

Tell me I'm not going to be

disappointed.

QUINN

I don't think so.

DEMIDOV

(to himself)

He always had good taste...

QUINN

Mr. Demidov... if I may ask you a

question... Why do you care so much

about Alexander Pearce? I mean,

you've come here yourself... as if

it were personal.

DEMIDOV

It may be difficult for you to

understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss

are mercenary by nature. But for

some of us, there are things more

important than money. I put my

trust in Alexander Pearce. He

betrayed that trust.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

And it's bad business to let

somebody make a fool of you. If

Pearce gets away with it, what

does that say about me?

CUT TO:

25.

CARA

So... when you're not on a Grand

European Tour, what do you do in

Rosemont, Pennsylvania?

FRANK

I'm a teacher. High school math.

And you? What do you do?

CARA

This is what I do, Frank.

FRANK

You're good at it.

CARA

Oh look... a wedding.   How lovely.

FRANK

I'm not really into weddings at

this particular moment in my life...

CARA

Oh yes.   I forgot.

CUT TO:

26.

CARA

Do you think it's really over?

FRANK

Hmm?

CARA

Maybe she'll change her mind.

Women do. She might give you a

second chance.

FRANK

I suppose that's a possibility.

(hesitates)

That's what I tell my statistics

class anyway; life is a game of

chance. Endless possibilities and

permutations. You just have to

calculate the odds.

CARA

You haven't answered the question.

FRANK

Well...

(quietly)

I'd like to think that love is a

question of destiny, not chance...

CARA

For a moment there you just

reminded me of somebody.

CARA (CONT'D)

He had a way of dancing around a

question so eloquently that you

never noticed until later that

he'd completely avoided the truth.

His entire life was wrapped up in

deception.

(lost in thought)

He told so many lies, I wouldn't

believe him even if he finally did

tell the truth.

FRANK

He doesn't sound like much of a

friend.

27.

CARA

He wasn't.

FRANK

So why are you wearing his watch?

CARA

You're smarter than you look,

Frank.

CARA (CONT'D)

And you're right. Here, take it.

FRANK

What? No, I can't. This thing

must be worth a fortune--

CARA

I insist. You're doing me a

favor.

(firm)

Take it or I'll toss it in the

ocean.

FRANK

I'll wear it until you regain your

senses.

FRANK (CONT'D)

What?

CARA

It suits you.

28.

FRANK

I could get used to this.

29.

CARA

You should leave Venice tomorrow.

(softer)

It's a city for lovers Frank; no

place to recover from a failed

engagement.

FRANK

What... what did I do?

CARA

Nothing.   I'm sorry.

CARA (CONT'D)

...that's exactly what I'm doing,

but now I want him to go...

30.

CUT TO:

31.

CUT BACK TO

REALITY:

WAITER

Pardone Signore. Good morning.

WAITER (CONT'D)

La Signora ordered this for you

when she left.

FRANK

When she...?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Thank you.

32.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Breakfast.

33.

34.

FRANK

Goddamn it!   I'm a fucking

tourist!

BURLY WELSHMAN

Are ya bloody mad?

35.

FRANK

Shit...

36.

A GONDOLIER

(in Italian)

Run faster, man!

CUT TO:

37.

CUT TO:

38.

DOMENICO

(in Italian)

You can't let them stay over, man.

You start cuddling and then she

wants to borrow your car. Stop

cuddling, Tomaso!

FRANK

Excuse me...

DOMENICO

(suddenly noticing

him)

Hey, what are you doing in here?

FRANK

The officers told me to wait here.

I've been sitting here for over

two hours...

DOMENICO

I think they forgot about you.

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

What happened to you, anyway?

FRANK

Somebody tried to kill me.

DOMENICO

Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a

day. Eh? We got chasing, we got

shooting.

FRANK

You think I'm crazy but it's all

true.

DOMENICO

Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my

friend.

39.

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

Okay, so who are these guys? Why

they mad at you?

FRANK

I have absolutely no idea.

DOMENICO

They followed you from the

Danieli?

FRANK

They came to the room. They

pretended to be room service.

DOMENICO

You don't scopata one of their

girlfriends or something?

FRANK

I didn't "scopata" anybody!

DOMENICO

Who is...

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

Cara Mason?

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

I catch you, right?

FRANK

(irritated)

In America the cops catch the

crooks, not the victim.

DOMENICO

Ha ha, we do that sometimes here,

too.

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

Is no domestic, then?

40.

FRANK

No.

DOMENICO

How long you know Cara Mason?

FRANK

I met her yesterday.

DOMENICO

And you take her to the Danieli?

That must have been good meeting,

yes?

FRANK

I didn't take her. She took me.

DOMENICO

You lead an exciting life, Mr.

Taylor.

FRANK

Not usually.

DOMENICO

Signora Mason was staying with

"her husband" last night. You

marry her, Mr. Taylor?

FRANK

No.

DOMENICO

I think maybe Signora Mason might

know why these guys behave badly.

What do you think?

FRANK

I think that's possible.

DOMENICO

You got a phone number, mobile?

FRANK

She didn't give me one.

41.

DOMENICO

You need some clothes.     I'll be

right back.

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

Here.     Put these on. Time to go.

FRANK

Um... thanks.   Where are we going?

DOMENICO

I'm taking you to the hospital,

Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take

a look at you.

42.

FRANK

I'd really rather just go--

DOMENICO

Don't worry. I put you in Padua,

away from Venice. You'll be safe.

(scribbles his

number)

Any worry, you call me. I give

you my home number.

CUT TO:

NURSE

Relax signore. We're just going

to make sure everything is all

right inside your head.

CLERK

(in Italian)

Unfortunately we've already re-let

the room.

(nervous)

We'd rather the guests didn't know

about the incident.

DOMENICO

Don't worry.   I'll be discreet.

CLERK

Grazie.

43.

CLERK (CONT'D)

I beg your pardon, Signore, but

this is a police officer. He needs

to briefly examine the room.

DEMIDOV

Of course.

DEMIDOV

(casually)

What happened, officer?

DOMENICO

That's what I'm trying to find

out, Signore.

DEMIDOV

You are a good detective.

DOMENICO

I do my best.

DOMENICO (CONT'D)

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Enjoy your stay.

44.

THE HOST (V.O.)

(in Italian)

Now remember, I said you were in

for a surprise... a big surprise.

ACKERMAN

What did we find on the American?

JONES

He's a tourist. Member of the

teacher's union. Pays his taxes.

Has bad luck.

ACKERMAN

Evidently. He had a pair of

Russian hit men after him. Are

you still going to tell me Demidov

is clean?

JONES

I never said he is clean.    I just

said he isn't our target.

GOYAL

I'm just wondering how they

tracked them down at the hotel...

ACKERMAN

(under his breath)

Just so long as they don't beat us

to Pearce when the real one

arrives.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Where's the teacher now?

45.

GOYAL

The local police picked him up.

ACKERMAN

Then he's safely out of the way.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Hello?

DOMENICO

Well it's official Mr. Taylor.

You're not mad.

FRANK

That's a relief.

DOMENICO

I went to the hotel. Somebody

shot at somebody. I found a shell

casing. I'll have it analyzed in

the morning.

FRANK

I'd like to be on a flight home

tomorrow morning.

DOMENICO

Relax, you're perfectly safe where

you are.

(pause)

You have any visits from your

Signora Mason?

46.

FRANK

(quiet)

I wish.

DOMENICO

Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor.

One cuddle and it all turns to

merda. Good night. If you need

anything, you have my number.

47.

48.

FRANK

(to the Nurse)

Wrong floor.

CARA

What are you waiting for?    Get in.

CARA

Did you miss me?

FRANK

A little.

49.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Um... you may not believe this but

there are some people trying to

kill me--

CARA

(calm)

I know.

FRANK

Do you know why?

CARA

It's because I kissed you.

CARA (CONT'D)

Shit.

50.

FRANK

(re: the Nurse)

That guy has nothing to do with

this.

CARA

Neither do you.

CARA (CONT'D)

Okay.   If you want to play hero...

CARA (CONT'D)

Hold on.

FRANK

There's not enough room!

CARA

There's enough room.

51.

FRANK

We won't make it!

CARA

I thought Americans were

optimists.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Do I look that much like Alexander

Pearce?

52.

CARA

How do you know--?

FRANK

The watch.

CARA

I don't know. You're about his

size. That's all.

FRANK

(incredulous)

You don't know what your own

boyfriend looks like?

CARA

Alexander crossed a very dangerous

man. He changed his appearance in

order to vanish.

FRANK

Great.

CARA

Don't worry. I'm taking you

somewhere you'll be safe.

FRANK

We should go to the police.

CARA

Because they did such a good job

protecting you before?

CARA (CONT'D)

Trust me.

FADE TO BLACK:

53.

CARA

Frank... Frank.

FRANK

And I thought I wouldn't get to do

any sight-seeing.

CARA

Here we are.

54.

FRANK

Whoa!

CARA

Sorry.

FRANK

What are you doing?

CARA

Making sure no one sabotaged the

gas lines.

FRANK

He goes Barracuda fishing?

CARA

He goes Marlin fishing. You catch

the Barracudas by accident.

55.

CARA

And she left you for a cook?

CARA (CONT'D)

Mmmmm!   That's decadent.

FRANK

With these ingredients, it's not

hard.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You know something? Food tastes

better after you've been shot at.

CARA

I'm glad I decided to come back

for you, Frank Taylor.

FRANK

Can I ask you a question.

FRANK (CONT'D)

What's it like? Being a criminal?

CARA

(scoffs)

I'm not a criminal.

56.

FRANK

You carry a gun, you consort with

people being chased by killers... I

hate to break it to you, but--

CARA

Okay, I'm a criminal.

CARA (CONT'D)

I didn't mean for things to turn

out like this. I always lived by

a certain code. But then... I broke

it.

FRANK

For Alexander Pearce?

FRANK (CONT'D)

What's he like?

CARA

He's the most interesting man I've

ever known. When I first met him,

I wasn't expecting that. He took

me by surprise.

CARA (CONT'D)

If I'd been prepared, I might not

have loved him. But I wasn't. So

I did.

FRANK

(soft)

I don't regret it, you know.

CARA

Regret what?

57.

FRANK

Kissing you.

CARA

What are you doing?

FRANK

I thought...

CARA

You thought what? That I saw you

on the train and my heart stopped?

That all my life I've been waiting

for a math teacher from the

Midwest to sweep me off my feet?

CARA (CONT'D)

I picked you because of your

height. Do you understand?

THE ENGLISHMAN

Have you been reading the

newspaper?

58.

CARA

Yes... there was nothing there

today. Is... is it you? Alexa--

THE ENGLISHMAN

No names.    Not on the phone.

THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.)

(from the speakers)

It's been a busier weekend than I

expected.

ACKERMAN

Place him.   Place him!

THE ENGLISHMAN (V.O.)

There's a recipe in a Tuscan

cookbook there I need. Would you

look it up for me?

CARA

Do we really need another

"recipe?"

THE ENGLISHMAN

I want to make sure our guests are

surprised.

59.

THE ENGLISHMAN

You're a brave and loyal girl.

I'm in awe of you.

ACKERMAN

Go!   Go!   Go!

CARA

That's because you leave

everything up to me.

CARA (CONT'D)

I'm fine by the way, in case you

were concerned about me.

THE ENGLISHMAN

(playful)

My only concern is for those who

cross you, my love.

60.

THE ENGLISHMAN

You may not believe it, but every

step of this miserable game is

taken in the hope of earning your

trust and ever-lasting regard. I

mean that.

CARA

You have a talent for saying the

right thing.

(to herself)

You always did.

CARA

Wait--

61.

GOYAL

We should check for prints.    Maybe

he forgot to wipe it down...

ACKERMAN

I doubt it.

62.

CARA

Frank... I have to go.

CARA (CONT'D)

Don't go out. All you need is

here. In four or five days

everything will be resolved...

FRANK

Resolved?

CARA

It will all be over. I'll give

you the all clear and you can go

back to your life. This will be a

great adventure you can look back

on.

FRANK

When will I see you again?

CARA

Never.

CARA (CONT'D)

Good-bye, Frank.

FRANK

Is he worth it?

CARA

Get back inside.

63.

FRANK

You're going to risk everything

for him. Would he do the same for

you?

CARA

It doesn't matter. I love him.

FRANK

He doesn't deserve it.

CARA

None of this is your business

anymore. Now get back inside

Frank!

OLD MAN

Signorina.

CARA

(to the neighbor)

Mi dispiace, Signor.

ACKERMAN

Why do women find these con men so

appealing?

64.

JONES

Don't look at me. I married my

personal trainer.

(sotto Jean Luc)

She's twenty-six.

ACKERMAN

How did Pearce seduce that

beautiful woman? Was it his

charm? His looks?

GOYAL

Looks change.

ACKERMAN

Maybe it's because if he adores

himself and spends every moment

gratifying his desires, so then

can she.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

She can become a child again. Who

wouldn't want that?

GOYAL

She's on the move. Time to go.

ACKERMAN

By all means.    Let's follow the

children.

65.

DEMIDOV

When I was a young man, times were

very hard. When an opportunity

presented itself, you took it.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

I was twelve years old when Gregor

asked me if I was ready for a

man's job. He was the top

chelovek in our housing block. So

I said yes. He gave me a crowbar

and told me to go bash in the

skull of another boy who had

stolen something from him.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

Now it just so happened this boy

was a friend of mine. I did not

want to do this terrible thing.

But when you come from the

streets, you have no choice.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

I worked   very hard for years to

get past   that life. So I would

not have   to do these terrible

things.    So I would have a choice...

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

I have people like you to do these

things for me...

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

Except that you don't!

67.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

If you did your job properly, I

wouldn't have to get my hands

dirty, you piece of shit.

AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.)

(from the speakers)

Eh, we do not know any

further...characteristics?

ACKERMAN

(pressing a button)

You know what we know.

69.

ACKERMAN

(into the speaker)

Hold...wait for my signal...

ACKERMAN

What is that fool doing in the

middle of my operation?

FRANK

Time for Alexander and me to meet

face to face.

CARA

(quietly)

I don't know what you're talking

about. Please go, I'd like to

have a quiet coffee.

70.

ACKERMAN

(frustrated)

Move off. Move off.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

(talking to the

screen)

Get rid of him!

FRANK

(to the waiter)

Caffe, per favore?

CARA

Cameriere!   No caffe for signor!

FRANK

(contradicting her)

With milk!

CARA

Do you want to be dead?

FRANK

Not particularly, but I'm tired of

being afraid. I've been running

around like a frightened mouse

long enough and I've decided I'm

finished.

71.

FRANK (CONT'D)

When I first saw the name I got

scared: "Alexander Pearce." He

even sounds like some super cool

master criminal with Russian

enemies and the beautiful

girlfriend... he probably works out.

He might own a pizza shop on the

side for all I know.

FRANK (CONT'D)

These are disgusting.

GOYAL

He's not going anywhere.

ACKERMAN

Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play

it like he's dealing with a rowdy

guest-- escort him out.

CARA

Frank, you have no idea what

you're sticking your nose into.

FRANK

Probably not. But I'm doing it

anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly

got me killed. It was his idea,

right?

(MORE)

72.

FRANK (CONT'D)

He told you to pick out some

random sap on the train to take a

bullet for him, didn't he?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Well I'm not playing the role

anymore. I'm going to confront

him. He's supposed to meet you

here, isn't he? I'm going to tell

him exactly what I think of him.

CARA

Wonderful. Another macho idiot.

(to the waiter)

Conto, per favore!

FRANK

What's the lure, Cara? Obviously

not his character. Is it the

money? The luxury? What's any of

that worth if you're getting shot

at and you could go to jail?

CARA

I'm leaving Frank.

FRANK

He's smooth, right? He probably

has mistresses in every European

city, too.

CARA

It's really a shame you've scared

him off--

CARA (CONT'D)

The two of you make a nice couple.

73.

FRANK

What the hell?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Is this him?

CARA

Frank!

ACKERMAN

Abort!   Abort, goddammit!

FRANK

You hide out poolside and send

your girlfriend and a total

stranger to face the murderers who

are after you? Not much of a

tough guy, are you?

74.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Where I come from, we don't treat

women like that!

ACKERMAN

That goddamn fool.

GOYAL

What do we do with him?

ACKERMAN

Throw him in the lagoon.

CUT TO:

FRANK

Cara!

75.

AGENT

Ok Signor... you can come with us

now.

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Please...

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Nice suit.

FRANK

It's borrowed.

ACKERMAN

It's a good fit.

FRANK

Unfortunately.

76.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Police... better than the

alternative I suppose.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Who's watching from behind there?

ACKERMAN

You have a vivid imagination.

FRANK

I haven't needed it lately.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You're in for a disappointment.

I'm not Alexander Pearce.

ACKERMAN

I know that.

FRANK

Since when?

ACKERMAN

Since the beginning.

FRANK

How...?

ACKERMAN

Come. I want to show you

something Frank.

CUT TO:

77.

ACKERMAN

(to Goyal)

Pull up the CID Academy graduating

class for 2002.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Take a good look.

FRANK

You?

ACKERMAN

Take a look at the second row.

FRANK

Cara...

ACKERMAN

We've been watching you this

entire time.

FRANK

(dawning)

You saw those men try to kill me

and you didn't intervene?

78.

ACKERMAN

I'm trying to apprehend a major

criminal. I'm not a babysitter.

FRANK

I want to speak with somebody at

the American Embassy. I'm going

to tell them that you and your

undercover officer knowingly and

recklessly endangered the life of

an American citizen! Let's see

what my government has to say

about that!

JONES

We're aware of the situation, Mr.

Taylor. But we take a long view

of these things... fortunately you

are unhurt...

FRANK

Then I'll go to the press. I'll

tell the entire story to the New

York Times.

ACKERMAN

(quietly)

No.   I don't think you'll do that.

FRANK

Why not?

ACKERMAN

Because I don't think you want to

see Cara's entire career

destroyed.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Espresso?

CUT TO:

79.

ACKERMAN

Women like Cara don't come along

very often.

FRANK

In my case, they don't come along

at all.

ACKERMAN

She's the worst combination:

stunning looks and a brilliant

mind.

FRANK

If she's so smart, how did she get

caught up with Pearce?

ACKERMAN

It started out as a

straightforward placement...

ACKERMAN (V.O.)

...we ran her deep cover to build a

case against Pearce. It took. He

hired her as an assistant.

ACKERMAN (V.O.)

Then she began missing drops.

Omitting important details.

80.

ACKERMAN

She was no longer with us.   She

was with him.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

She explains it now as the

confusion of her new life outside

the academy. That I misread her

capacity for this kind of work.

FRANK

Then why are you still using her?

ACKERMAN

She's all I have, Mr. Taylor.

FRANK

You think she'll turn him in this

time?

ACKERMAN

I don't know.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

I do know however, that you are

very smitten with her.

FRANK

It's not just me, is it?

CUT TO:

81.

ACKERMAN (V.O.)

Cara?     Where have you been?

CARA

Have you got him?

ACKERMAN

You mean the idiot who ruined our

operation?

CARA

Have you got him?

ACKERMAN

Yes.

CARA

It's your own fault. We never

should have endangered a civilian.

You should have put an agent into

place.

ACKERMAN

There was no time. Besides Pearce

is too smart for that; he would

have spotted the agent a mile

away.

CARA

He didn't spot me.

ACKERMAN

Apparently he didn't have to.

82.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry Cara. That was uncalled

for.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

I'm on edge because of our failure

today. If only the American

hadn't messed everything up... I

felt sure Pearce would show up

today.

CARA

What makes you think he didn't?

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Okay everybody, listen up.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

We have a location and time for

the next meet.    Pearce's villa.

Eight o'clock. We have to move

fast--

JONES

Pearce's own villa? Why would he

risk going back there? He must

know we'd be watching.

JEAN LUC

Perhaps he's nostalgic.

ACKERMAN

I doubt that. Maybe there's

something of value still there.

He left in a hurry after all.

JONES

Call in a search team.

83.

ACKERMAN

We searched the place after the

raid last year. If there's

anything hidden there, only Pearce

knows where it is.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

We need to get agents in place all

around the villa.

FRANK

If you're all around his house,

will he show up?

ACKERMAN

If I needed your advice Mr.

Taylor, I'd ask.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Establish a wide perimeter. We'll

keep our distance and wire the

entire villa for video

surveillance.

CUT TO:

84.

CARA

Come in.

FRANK

I'm sorry.

CARA

It's okay.   Come over here.    I

need your help.

FRANK

Ackerman told me everything.

CARA

I'm sorry Frank.

FRANK

There's no apology necessary.

CARA

(re: the wire)

How do I look?

FRANK

Like the most beautiful woman on

earth.

CARA

When will you go home?

85.

FRANK

Ackerman asked me to stay with the

surveillance team in case the

thugs who came after me at the

Danieli show up. I'm the only one

who can identify them.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Did you tell him to keep an eye on

me?

CARA

(busted)

I told him to make sure you were

safe until this was over.

FRANK

You shouldn't worry about me.

What about you?

CARA

What about me?

FRANK

What are you going to do?

CARA

My job.

CUT TO:

86.

FRANK

You all read the same newspaper.

ACKERMAN

It's a good paper. And sold

throughout the world. Makes the

classified ads especially useful...

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Since the internet came about,

hardly anybody uses old school

methods like that to communicate

anymore. Except Alexander Pearce.

No lines to tap. No signals to

intercept.

(admiringly)

He's a very clever man, your

double.

FRANK

I look forward to meeting him.

ACKERMAN

So do I.

87.

AGENT

(in Italian)

You'll have to turn around, sir.

There's been a chemical spill in

this area--

SURVEILLANCE AGENT (V.O.)

She's approaching the destination

now.

88.

FRANK

(points)

Who's that?

ACKERMAN

What happened? Get it back on

line!

JONES

Was that Pearce?

GOYAL

How did he know there would be a

camera?

JONES

He's taking out the entire

surveillance system--

ACKERMAN

Stop him.

TECHNICIAN

I can't! He's cutting the feed at

the source.

89.

JEAN LUC

How can one man move through the

house that fast?

GOYAL

(overlapping)

What should we do?

ACKERMAN

Shut up!    Everyone.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Do we still have audio?

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Turn it up.

CARA (V.O.)

Alexander?

90.

DEMIDOV

Sorry to disappoint you, my dear.

JONES

(whispers)

Who is that?

DEMIDOV (V.O.)

How are you this evening?

CARA (V.O.)

(a tremor in her

voice)

Fine, thank you.

JEAN LUC

The accent is Russ--

ACKERMAN

Shh!

(quietly)

It's Ivan Demidov.

JONES

(uncertainly)

Not possible.

DEMIDOV

You're waiting for someone, Ms.

Mason?

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

You haven't seen Alexander Pearce

in a long time, yes? I'm sure it

will be a touching reunion.

(MORE)

91.

DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

If you don't mind, we'll keep you

company while you wait.

GOYAL

(anxious)

What are we going to do?

ACKERMAN

We're going to wait for Alexander

Pearce. Just like them.

SNIPER

(into his radio mic)

She's brought them to the window...

SNIPER (V.O.)

...there are three of them.

DEMIDOV

Not very polite of your boyfriend

to keep you waiting.

CARA

He loses track of time easily.

DEMIDOV

I have a hard time believing that.

(pause)

Perhaps he's already here

somewhere... hiding... even watching

us.

92.

DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)

What do you think?

DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You know... I have a feeling he is

around here somewhere. And if he

cares about you... if he wants to

see your lovely face again... he

should show up before it's too

late.

GOYAL

Sir?

ACKERMAN

Demidov's right. He's here

somewhere...

JEAN LUC

We have to do something--

ACKERMAN

We have to wait.

JEAN LUC

Yes but--

ACKERMAN

(harsh)

She's my agent. She's my

responsibility.

93.

JONES

What if he doesn't come?

GOYAL

Where's Taylor?

SMASH CUT TO:

DEMIDOV

(leans down to Cara)

Good news. He loves you.

94.

CARA

That's not Alexander Pearce.

DEMIDOV

You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I

was finished with this sort of

thing. But in your case, I've

been forced to make an exception.

CARA

He is NOT Alexander Pearce!

CARA (CONT'D)

Oh Frank...   I'm so sorry.

FRANK

Nothing to be sorry for.

DEMIDOV

Good bye Mr. Pearce.

CARA

Ackerman!

95.

CARA (CONT'D)

(furious)

Ackerman!!

ACKERMAN

Do it.

96.

FRANK

Are you all right?

CARA

I did well to choose you on the

train...

FRANK

You didn't get to arrest Alexander

Pearce...

CARA

He never showed up.

97.

FRANK

(a British accent)

You're wrong. I'm here.

FRANK (CONT'D)

It's me.   I'm here.

CARA

Why?

FRANK

You said I'd told so many lies,

you wouldn't believe me even if I

did tell the truth... This was the

only way to convince you.

(pause)

The truth is that I love you. All

that matters is that you believe

me.

98.

CUT TO:

ACKERMAN

Cara... I want the paramedics to

make sure you're all right--

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Cara...

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about

this later.

CARA

No we won't. There's nothing to

talk about. I don't work for you

anymore.

ACKERMAN

Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

It seems I underestimated you.

FRANK

(American accent)

It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.

99.

GOYAL

Sir... over here. Take a look at

this!

ACKERMAN

He was here.

GOYAL

Account numbers... access codes...

unless I'm mistaken... he left the

money behind.

JEAN LUC

A mistake perhaps?

JONES

How much is there?

GOYAL

Looks like 744 million.

JONES

That's no mistake...

(walks over)

That's his tax bill.

JONES (CONT'D)

I'll take that.

100.

JONES (CONT'D)

Well John... with the funds

recovered, I don't think there's

going to be any appetite from our

side to continue this

investigation.

JONES (CONT'D)

I'm sorry you didn't get your man.

ACKERMAN

Oh but I did get my man, Ms.

Jones.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

Mr. Goyal, you may place Mr. Quinn

under arrest now.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

(to Quinn)

What? You thought I didn't know?

You were unwittingly quite

helpful; without you Mr. Demidov

might have escaped justice.

ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

After all, Demidov wasn't a target

of this investigation, was he?

101.

JONES

There's something I don't

understand... how did Pearce manage

to get here and open that safe

without anybody noticing? And

where did he go?

ACKERMAN

Because Pearce was cleverer than

all of us.

CUT TO:

THE ENGLISHMAN

$20 million dollars worth of

surgery and that's the face you

chose?

FRANK

(English accent)

It's good to see you too.

102.

CARA

You really think they'll just give

up?

FRANK

The Americans have their money.   I

left it all for them.

CARA

What about Demidov's money?

FRANK

Well...

(smiles)

You have to save something for

your pension.

THE END
