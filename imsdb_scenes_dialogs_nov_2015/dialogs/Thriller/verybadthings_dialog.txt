"VERY BAD THINGS"

by

Peter Berg

September 2, 1997

MOORE

That ought to be about the end of

that.

FISHER

Yup.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 -

6 lead in a, tough, football game

and this crowd is standing..."

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"Hang on to your hats, here come the

Steelers out of the Huddle..."

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"It comes down to one big play, 4th

down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw

at the controls..."

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"And Bradshaw, back and

looking...Again, Bradshaw running

out of the pocket... Looking for

someone to throw to..."

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...Bradshaw fires it down the field

and there's a collision!..."

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"...and it's caught out of the air!

The ball is pulled in by Franco

Harris!"

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Franco Harris running for the end

zone, all but home..."

FADE TO BLACK:

LIZ

This is ridiculous.

FISHER

Government cutbacks.

LIZ

Why can't we do it through the mail?

FISHER

(patient)

We missed the deadline.

LIZ

Can't we do it on the phone?

FISHER

I don't think so.

LIZ

Why is this Kid staring at me?

FISHER

I'm not sure.

LIZ

(reading from her

notes)

Did you send in all of the deposit

checks?

FISHER

I think so.

LIZ

(pause)

What do you mean, you think so?

FISHER

I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure

what all of them are.

LIZ

The wedding cake check?

FISHER

Sent it.

LIZ

Photographer?

FISHER

Sent it.

LIZ

Florist?

FISHER

Yup.

LIZ

Caterer?

FISHER

Yes.

LIZ

Hotel for my parents, the tent, the

band, the Judge...

FISHER

(beat)

I think I forgot the tent.

LIZ

(somewhat alarmed)

You forgot the tent?

FISHER

I think so.

LIZ

Why?

FISHER

Why what?

LIZ

Why did you forget the tent check?

FISHER

I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.

LIZ

You can't play around with these

tent people.

FISHER

I'm not playing around. I forgot.

LIZ

What else have you forgot?

FISHER

How could I know what else I forgot?

LIZ

I'm working my ass off here. I've

taken care of absolutely everything

Keith.

FISHER

Because you wanted to. You wanted

this to be your wedding not your

parent's.

LIZ

Don't you dare.

FISHER

What?

LIZ

Don't you put this on me. Don't do

it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...

FISHER

(trying to calm her)

Stop it. I'm sorry.

LIZ

(trying to control

herself)

You know how important this is to my

mother. You know that.

FISHER

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the

tent. I don't think I forgot anything

else.

LIZ

(not bitchy)

I bet you didn't forget the bachelor

party checks.

FISHER

Are we going to do this again?

LIZ

I'm just saying I bet those checks

all found the mailboxes.

FISHER

I wouldn't know.

LIZ

It amazes me how organized you and

your little fun bunch can be when it

comes time to mobilize to Vegas.

FISHER

(patient)

They organized this, not me. I have

nothing to do with it.

LIZ

Well it's bad timing.

FISHER

How do you figure?

LIZ

Right before the wedding?

FISHER

It's a bachelor party. You sort of

have to do it before the wedding.

LIZ

I suppose Boyd is the creative force

behind all this.

FISHER

He is.

LIZ

He's a moron.

FISHER

He's my friend. He's not a moron.

LIZ

David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

BOYD

(into phone)

David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's

the deal, we're talking five guys.

Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends.

Yeah. I'm calling you directly so

you don't have to go through the

agency...

(suddenly, over his

shoulder)

HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE!

(back into phone)

That's correct. Cash straight to

you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't

think so. It's just stripping. Just

a show. Hold on.

(O.C.)

Could you please wait off the

property?

MAN

We're just trying to sneak a peak.

BOYD

Just stay off the property until I'm

off the phone.

MAN

Why?

BOYD

Cause that's the way they do it.

BOYD

(back into phone)

So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino.

Nine hundred bucks and you do the

thing with the rubber hoses. Are you

in? Tina, are you in? Good.

BOYD

David Boyd, nice to meet you.

LIZ

Why do you feel the need to explore

this side of your personality?

FISHER

What are you talking about?

LIZ

I'm talking about the kind of people

you hang out with... about growing

up, assuming responsibility of

yourself.

FISHER

I asked you to marry me. I'm ready

for marriage. That's responsibility.

That's growth.

LIZ

I just think that at some point you're

going to have to re-evaluate some of

your friendships...

FISHER

Who else?

LIZ

Charles Moore for instants.

FISHER

You don't like Moore? Since when?

LIZ

It's not that I don't like him. But

the wedding has really got me thinking

and... I just keep myself opening

up. Growning. And I want you keeping

up with me here.

FISHER

What does Moore have to do with your

growing?

LIZ

I just don't see him in the big

picture.

FISHER

I've known him since Cub Scouts.

LIZ

He's weird.

FISHER

He's quiet.

LIZ

He's weird.

FISHER

He just doesn't talk a lot.

LIZ

Why? What's his problem?

FISHER

He's a great chef.

LIZ

He's weird. And I expect more from

you.

FISHER

You expect more what?

LIZ

You're going to be hungover for three

days. Like those guys on "Oprah"

that get drunk and have disgusting

sex with prostitutes and then say

their vows with the stench of cheap

hotel whore sex all over them.

FISHER

Time out.

LIZ

It's vile!

FISHER

That's absurd.

LIZ

I've seen it on television.

FISHER

I'm not going to marry you with the

smell of prostitutes on my body.

LIZ

(starts to cry)

I am not common Keith. I am not

common. I am a creature like no other

and I will not be commoned! Is that

to much to ask?

(screaming)

Is that to much to ask!?!

FISHER

You will not be common!!!

LIZ

Marriage license please.

LIZ

Do you love me?

FISHER

Of course.

LIZ

How much?

FISHER

With all my heart.

LIZ

(vulnerable)

Kiss me...?

MICHAEL

That's just insecurity.

FISHER

I don't know. She's really been

stressing out.

MICHAEL

Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut

splinters.

FISHER

What does that mean?

MICHAEL

It means she's insecure.

FISHER

About what?

MICHAEL

(picks up)

Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5

for 6. At 29.83 at 9.

(hangs up)

I'm amazed the windows don't blow

out of their fucking sockets with

all the repressed, ass-puckering

rage in these soul-less lizards.

FISHER

(beat)

I just want her to be happy.

MICHAEL

Same alarm clock every morning, same

two pops on the same snooze button...

(PHONE RINGS; picks

up)

Michael Brenn. Yes... Yes...

(looking through stacks

of stats)

Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321

at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at

3432.343.

(hangs up)

Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor,

hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic

Fisher and you better start addressing

it. You're getting married and I'm

not going to candy-coat it. It just

gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel

cement mixer that will crush every

bone in your body.

FISHER

I'm not breathing right.

MICHAEL

You're not breathing right?

FISHER

Lately I'll just start getting

lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I

haven't breathed in like two minutes.

ADAM

(to Michael)

We're leaving from my house in three

hours. If you want to come, get your

numbers in order by then.

MICHAEL

First of all...

ADAM

(cuts him off)

No first of all. I'm not in a game

mood.

MICHAEL

You're interrupting a personal

conversation.

ADAM

(to Fisher)

Sorry Fish.

FISHER

We'll be ready Adam.

ADAM

I know you'll be.

(to Michael)

Three hours.

MICHAEL

I don't care for him.

FISHER

He's your brother.

MICHAEL

So?

FISHER

(pick's up)

Keith Fisher.

LIZ

(into phone)

We've got problems here.

FISHER

Problems?

LIZ

Seating problems.

FISHER

Okay.

LIZ

Keith do not trivialize this.

FISHER

I'm not. What's the problem?

LIZ

We're supposed to have gold-trimmed

padded seats, now they're telling me

that there was a mistake and we can't

have padded.

FISHER

What kind of seats can we have?

LIZ

Not padded ones.

FISHER

So what do we do?

LIZ

You go down there.

FISHER

Go down where?

LIZ

Go down to the seat place and

straighten this out.

FISHER

Honey I don't have the time...

LIZ

I need your help.

FISHER

We're leaving in three hours.

LIZ

(starts to cry)

I need your help.

FISHER

I'll call them from the road.

LIZ

Do you love me?

FISHER

More than I ever imagined being able

to love anyone ever.

LIZ

Take care of those chairs.

FISHER

We're leaving from Adam's. Come send

me off.

LIZ

Maybe.

LOIS

Notice how clean and well-behaved

they all appear, respectable members

of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr.,

take a good look at this...

LOIS

...We will compare these before photos

with whatever form of degeneration

presented to us in 24 hours, no matter

how low, how vile...

LIZ

...embarrassing, shameful...

LOIS

...regression of Modern Man to his

most primitive, ape-like state...

LIZ

The stone age.

LOIS

The post-Vegas Man.

LIZ

A mutant species.

LOIS

Okay boys, smile!

LOIS

All right. As you were.

LIZ

Will you please call the chair people?

FISHER

I will.

LIZ

Do you love me?

FISHER

Of course.

LIZ

Just call and let me know that your

okay.

FISHER

I love you.

LIZ

Have a nice bachelor party.

ADAM

Not on your life.

BOYD

You're a fucking moron.

MICHAEL

It's my fucking opinion.

ADAM

It's really a stupid opinion. You

have developed an annoying habit of

talking for what seems to be no other

reason than to hear yourself speak.

MICHAEL

Because my opinion threatens yours,

it's poorly developed?

ADAM

No, because your opinions are idiotic

and have nothing to do with what any

given conversation is about, which

makes 85% of your eagerly injected

thought process highly offensive to

me.

MICHAEL

Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

BOYD

The hell I did!

MICHAEL

The hell you didn't!

BOYD

The hell I did!

MICHAEL

You said one in two marriages end in

divorce.

BOYD

I never heard that.

FISHER

You said that Boyd.

BOYD

Well, I didn't mean it.

MICHAEL

You're an asshole Adam.

ADAM

You're an asshole.

MICHAEL

Oh, and why am I an asshole?

ADAM

Multiple reasons.

MICHAEL

Name one.

ADAM

I don't have to...

FISHER

SHUT UP!

FISHER

(into phone)

Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak

to whomever is in charge of chairs?

Chairs.

BOYD

Four hours and fifteen minutes. I

can make Vegas in 3 and change.

ADAM

I'm not getting a ticket.

FISHER

(on cell phone)

Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're

doing my wedding and I'm calling

about the chair situation. Yeah,

I'll hold.

BOYD

Who's up for making some real money?

ADAM

Don't even start.

BOYD

You want to hear me out?

MICHAEL

Nope.

BOYD

Moore?

MOORE

No I don't.

BOYD

Fish?

FISHER

Not really.

(into phone)

Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...

BOYD

Prison Communication Systems.

(no response)

An acquaintance friend of mine is

professionally involved with a

communications outfit in Denver that

I just happen to know for a fact is

about to be rewarded a very large,

exclusive contract to rewire every

state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.

FISHER

(into phone)

No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs.

Keith Fisher. Okay.

BOYD

That would translate to government

guaranteed contract in excess of 35

million dollars.

FISHER

(into phone)

We need padded chairs.

BOYD

Or a stock kick of approximately

125% on shares which are currently

sitting around $4.38, or, in plain

English...

ADAM

SHUT UP!

MICHAEL

NO!

BOYD

What is wrong with you people? I'm a

helper here.

MOORE

Your investment ideas never work

out.

BOYD

That's the whole point. They rarely

work out. But on occasion they do.

And when they do, they do big.

MICHAEL

Your ideas never work out.

BOYD

Oh really? Starbucks?

ADAM

That's one idea.

FISHER

(into phone)

No... we want padded chairs... okay?

BOYD

One idea that if you had fucking

listened to, you would each be worth

approximately 15 million dollars.

ADAM

You can't keep bringing up Starbucks.

That was your only real hit in like

75 tries.

BOYD

I set up Fisher with the broker that

found his house. Took care of that

one, didn't I?

(beat)

Prison Communications.

MOORE

I don't think so Boyd.

BOYD

Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No

sir.

FISHER (O.S.)

Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs.

I have a chair problem. No, I'm not

Tony, I need to speak to Tony.

ADAM

All the bullshit aside Fish, we've

been coming up here for what, eight

years?

BOYD

More.

ADAM

Over eight years of some of the

hardest raging experiences of my

life.

MOORE

Good times.

MICHAEL

Drum banging real times.

FISHER

Real times.

ADAM

They've all been real times. And as

you prepare to enter into a new phase

of life, as you prepare for new roles;

father, husband, teacher, you will,

as I have, come to except the letting

go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing

will begin...

BOYD

But not tonight.

MOORE

Not tonight.

ADAM

Tonight we return once again to the

cave. Tonight we let the monsters

out. We fill ourselves with the

spirits of Genghis Kahn, Joe Namath,

JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...

MICHAEL

(screaming)

Franco mother-fucking Harris!

MOORE

Keith Richards, Dean Martin...

BOYD

Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville,

Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson.

I dedicate this evening to fear and

to major loathing. So from sun set

to sun rise, let me be heard...

ALL

He who acts the beast, rids himself

of the pain of being a man!

LIZ (V.O.)

Hello.

FISHER

Hi.

LIZ

Hi.

(teasing)

Are you calling from jail?

FISHER (V.O.)

Not yet.

LIZ

Well, the night is young. Did you

straighten out the chair situation?

FISHER (V.O.)

I'm working on it, I've made three

calls.

(beat)

I can't stop thinking about how much

I love you.

LIZ

That's sweet.

FISHER (V.O.)

Well I do.

LIZ

Well you should.

FISHER (V.O.)

What are you doing?

LIZ

Just a bit of organizing.

FISHER (V.O.)

Nesting?

LIZ

Yeah. Nesting.

FISHER (V.O.)

I'm mad at you.

LIZ

Go have fun. Not too much.

FISHER (V.O.)

I'll see you tomorrow...

BOYD

I don't hate women.

MICHAEL

You hate women.

BOYD

False.

MICHAEL

True.

BOYD

Not true.

MICHAEL

You have a King fantasy.

BOYD

I am a lover. In Africa, you can

stay king as long as you can service

your women every night.

MICHAEL

And what happens when you can't?

BOYD

(swigs whiskey; looks

up)

New king.

ADAM

No. No. No. It's what my father said

to me. He said it and he meant it...

He said to me... He said, Adam, he

said... He told me and I heard him...

he said...

(struggles to remember)

Hell he said so many Goddamn things

I can't remember everything he said

for Christsake.

FISHER

Right! That's exactly what I'm saying.

My father said, first of all, I'm

your father not your friend. I'm

your father.

ADAM

Are you solid with that?

FISHER

No. I think it's fucked.

ADAM

Then fuck what your father said,

cause I'm gonna tell you right now...

You'll know what it's all about, why

you got married and why you love her

when you wake up at three in the

morning, and the streetlight's coming

through the window and it's just

catching a corner of her face, like

a sleeping angel. And her hair smells

sweet and she's your's. She's all

your's. Do you see where I'm going

here?

BOYD

If I'm the king of Israel, I say to

myself, King, I say to myself, King...

Take a good look around. What do I

see?

MICHAEL

Israel doesn't have a King.

BOYD

Then what do they have?

MICHAEL

They have a president. A Benjamin

Yahoo something.

BOYD

I say to myself, look at the map.

Look what's all around you. People

who wish bad bad things for you and

your people. For thousands of years

the Jews are fighting everybody. It

used to be they'd throw rocks, then

the iron revolution and they would

attack with spears. Then the gunpowder

revolution. Now they're shooting

fire power back and forth, all day

bullets flying, babies getting shot.

MICHAEL

What's your point?

BOYD

Now if I'm the King of Israel and

all these sand niggers are armed to

the gills and you know it's just a

matter of time... right? Am I right?

MICHAEL

The Israelis can protect themselves.

They got the Mossad thing happening.

Mossad's for real, man. They scalp

babies.

BOYD

There's my point exactly.

MICHAEL

What? What's your point?

BOYD

Take Mexico.

MICHAEL

What?

BOYD

Look up the chickens, dig up the

holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying

wall thing they bang their heads on

all day long, stick it all on a big

fucking tug boat. The whole country

picks up and takes Mexico.

FISHER

The bucks gonna stop right here.

(pounds his chest)

If my son doesn't know the six New

England states, if he has trouble

with geography, I won't stick it in

his face. I'll help the little guy.

I'll put him in the car and take him

out there. I'll take him to Maine

for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing

in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee

Stadium... I won't stare him down.

ADAM

Don't ever stare him down.

FISHER

I won't do it.

ADAM

Don't eyeball your kids.

BOYD

The Mexicans would love it. They're

dying for a little order down there.

They need direction.

MICHAEL

They need leadership.

BOYD

That's what I'm saying. Let the

Israelis straighten it up. They got

plenty of room down there, number

one. Plus, and this is just a plus,

they kind of look alike -- the Jews

and the Mexicans. So I think on a

whole your average Joe Mexican is

gonna have less of a problem getting

his head around the whole assimilation

thing. Am I right?

ADAM

I tell mine that they're little men.

I tell them they're strong. They

make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So

they really know that I need them

just as much. You know. Just as much

man. And you know, you're their

godfather...

FISHER

I know and I'm honored...

ADAM

If anything ever happens to me...

FISHER

I know...

ADAM

Y'see? That's the real point here.

That's what I'm driving for, when

the big storm comes and knocks down

all the forests and the rocks fall

down and the leave's are bare. What's

left? The little trees, the little

fellas that the storm didn't see.

The tiny little...

MOORE

The stripper's here.

ADAM

(bombed)

Excellent.

BOYD

Gentlemen, this is Tina.

TINA

Who's the lucky groom?

TINA

Hi Fisher.

MICHAEL

God, I love women.

BOYD

(whispers to Fish)

She's all your's Fish. Anything you

want. Happy bachelor party.

FISHER

I can't.

MICHAEL

(jumps up)

I'll take a ride.

FISHER

Go for it.

MICHAEL

(to Tina)

Come on.

TINA

(to Boyd)

You said just dancing.

BOYD

(re: money)

I'll take good care of you.

TINA

(dead flat; re: Michael)

With him.

(beat)

Lucky me.

MOORE

She's fucking hot!

ADAM

I need a drink.

BOYD

Tequila...

TINA

Oh come on.

MICHAEL

I want to play.

TINA

It's gonna cost extra.

MICHAEL

I will pay.

TINA

Easy baby, easy.

MOORE

(beat)

Cool.

MICHAEL

I really fucked up.

MOORE

Jesus.

ADAM

Don't touch her. Call 911.

MICHAEL

(in shock)

I was just playing... we were playing

just playing around.

ADAM

(examines Tina)

She's dead.

FISHER

No... No.

MOORE

How do you know she's dead.

ADAM

She's got no fucking pulse.

BOYD

You don't know what you're doing.

BOYD

(not getting anything)

Where do you look? What side of the

neck?

MOORE

Left side.

ADAM

Either side you idiot. I'm calling

911.

FISHER

(semi-gone)

What happened? Oh my God...

MICHAEL

We were playing... she slipped...

she hit her head.

ADAM

(incredulous)

Playing?

BOYD

Wait!

ADAM

What?

BOYD

What are you doing?

ADAM

(hysterical)

What are you talking about?

BOYD

What do you think you are doing?

ADAM

I'm calling the ambulance.

BOYD

Just wait a second. Wait one second.

Okay. What are you doing?

ADAM

Calling the ambulance.

BOYD

Why?

(beat)

Why? She's dead. Why are you calling

an ambulance?

ADAM

We have to call the ambulance.

BOYD

Why?

FISHER

Oh, Jesus... call the police.

BOYD

No.

FISHER

She's dead. Call somebody!

BOYD

Shut up.

FISHER

Call 911.

BOYD

Shut up.

MICHAEL

She slipped.

ADAM

(attacking Michael)

What did you do?

MICHAEL

(defensive)

You never heard of accidents?! Get

off me!

BOYD

Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!

BOYD

Listen to me. Please. Everybody just

calm down a bit here. Okay... First...

are we sure she's dead?

ADAM

Her head's bashed in and her heart

isn't beating.

MOORE

She's dead.

MICHAEL

It was an accident!

BOYD

Are you sure this was an accident?

ADAM

You're a lying deviant. What did you

do?!

MICHAEL

The floor was wet. She slipped!

ADAM

Why was the floor wet?

MICHAEL

I don't know why the floor was wet!

ADAM

Why?!

BOYD

Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just

take a second here and take hold of

the situation, OK? Let's just review

our options here.

ADAM

We have a dead woman bleeding all

over the bathroom. What options?

Call the police.

BOYD

Call the police. Okay, that's one

option.

ADAM

That is not an "option." There is no

multiple choice here.

BOYD

Yes sir, there sure is an option

here. There are always options.

MOORE

I've never seen a dead person.

FISHER

(enraged)

Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!

BOYD

Well we can definitely call the

police. That's an easy call. If we

call the police... What happens?

(silence)

They find a dead prostitute in the

bathroom... They ask us... What

happened? We say, ah... our friend,

Michael...

(to Adam)

Your brother... got a little out of

control... they were making love...

and he got a little excited... and

he, ah, sort of beat her head into

the side of a toilet, while he choked

her to death with a rubber hose...

ADAM

Stop it!

BOYD

There's more.

ADAM

Just stop.

BOYD

Just giving the facts.

ADAM

I'm calling the police.

BOYD

What were we doing officer? Why didn't

we help her? Well... we're all a bit

high, you know, bachelor party, that

kind of thing. Fisher here is getting

married in three days... Beautiful

wife... he didn't have anything at

all to do with it... It was all

Michael here... just Michael...

ADAM

You don't play games with Homicide

police. There are no options here.

There is not the luxury of worrying

about how the fallout will settle.

BOYD

I've known him for while maybe twenty

years kind of a close friend but hey

what the heck officer, take him away,

go on it's for his own good.

FISHER

(outraged)

What are you talking about? Adam's

right. We don't have a choice here

Boyd... I mean what are you talking

about? What options???

BOYD

(calm)

Bury her out in the desert.

ADAM

(sarcastic)

Sure, why not.

MOORE

He's right.

BOYD

We can take her out to Red Rock.

Find some quiet place... and put her

in the ground.

ADAM

You don't just casually walk out of

a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.

BOYD

We can do this. We can get her out

of here.

ADAM

Have you completely lost your mind?

So you get her out of here. So you

get her out into the desert somehow,

without anybody seeing, so what, you

don't think at some point somebody

might notice that she's gone?

BOYD

Nobody knows she's here. I called

her personally. Nobody knows.

FISHER

Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody

must know she's here.

BOYD

Nobody knows.

ADAM

Her blood is all over the bathroom.

I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.

BOYD

It's a marble floor, we can clean it

up.

FISHER

Oh God. This is insane.

BOYD

What's insane is the fact that Michael

here put a fucking girl's head through

a toilet. That's insane.

MOORE

They'll get us on accessory to murder.

ADAM

Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't

do shit. You call the cops, you

explain it was an accident...

BOYD

Her fucking head was caved in.

ADAM

So! I didn't fucking do it!

BOYD

She's got bondage burns on her wrists.

There's blow all over the room, Moore

looks like he went at it with a

mountain lion. This room looks like

the Manson Family stayed here a month.

Michael goes down, we all go down.

MOORE

I'm not going to ruin my life over a

dead whore.

ADAM

That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead

whore?" She's a person!

FISHER

(falling away)

I'm getting married...

MICHAEL

I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

ADAM

I've got a wife and two boys.

BOYD

(unflappably calm)

Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two

choices; we clean up the mess. Right

now. Bury it in the desert, go home,

and never look back. Or, we can call

the police... Open those doors, roll

the dice and hope that it's only

Michael who falls. Let's take a vote.

Desert... or police?

BOYD

Desert.

MOORE

(beat)

Fucking desert.

MICHAEL

(to Fisher)

Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I

owe you man.

(puts up his hand)

Desert.

BOYD

Nobody knows she's here.

FISHER

Good God... Good God...

ADAM

How do we get her out of here?

BOYD

Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the

car around to the back of the hotel,

throw her off the balcony, put her

in the car... Done.

ADAM

(beat)

You don't think someone will have a

problem with a body being thrown off

a balcony?

BOYD

We check out the area and wait for a

time when it's clear.

ADAM

What about the blood?

BOYD

Someone goes to Walmart, gets some

buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and

Span, the works.

ADAM

Have you ever done this before?

BOYD

The reality is, you take away the

horror of this situation, take away

the tragedy of the death, take away

the moral and ethical implications

of all the crap you have had

conditioned, beaten, into your head

since grade one. What are we left

with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115

lbs. that must be moved from point A

to point B. Now, a straight line in

the shortest distance but we are

denied the luxury of a visible

straight line. But that line exists

and I see it. I see that line. Trust

me. Adam. Trust me... I can take

care of this.

RALPH (O.S.)

Hello? Is anyone in there?

BOYD

(calls out)

What is it?

RALPH (O.S.)

Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

BOYD

(through door)

What?

RALPH (O.S.)

I'm with Tina. Is she there?

BOYD

She's not here.

RALPH (O.S.)

Where is she?

BOYD

She's here. She's just... Hold on a

second.

RALPH (O.S.)

Could you open the door please.

RALPH

Okay. Hi.

RALPH

So who's the lucky guy?

BOYD

Who?

RALPH

The groom?

FISHER

Me.

RALPH

Cool...

(beat)

You all dudes from L.A.?

BOYD

Yup.

RALPH

Doing the bachelor party thing?

BOYD

That's right.

RALPH

Sin City. Devil's Playground. The

Black Bitch. All day every day.

(beat)

Where's Tina?

BOYD

She's in the bathroom... she's still

working.

RALPH

She's still working?

BOYD

That's right.

RALPH

Sweet deal.

RALPH

Is everything okay?

BOYD

Great. Fine. Perfect.

RALPH

(indicating bathroom)

I'm gonna just tell her I'm waiting.

BOYD

She's in there!

RALPH

I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.

RALPH

My God!

FISHER (O.S.)

No! NOOOO!!!

BOYD

Help me! Don't let him bleed on the

carpet!

BOYD

He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry.

Help me hold the door.

MOORE

Oh God.

BOYD

(with military

precision)

All right people. New plan. Not even

a new plan so much as a modification

of the old plan.

FISHER

(beyond shock)

I'm calling the police.

BOYD

So help me God you touch that phone

and I bury you with them.

(beat)

Surrender is no longer an option. I

repeat -- It is not an option. Is

there anyone who does not understand

that?

BOYD

A little gut check time fellas. A

time for some serious self-

exploration. How do I function? For

real? No more bullshit. Can I keep

my cool when they bounce my bananas?

When they won't play my fucking song?

etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get

me?

MICHAEL

Not really. no.

BOYD

Not a problem. Understand not my

words, but follow my orders. Follow

my orders

BOYD (V.O.)

We will organize, we will mobilize,

we will maximize and prioritize.

BOYD

Let's do it people.

BOYD

All right. Looking good people.

BOYD

Sun rises at 5:52.

ADAM

I'm not wrecking the transmission!

ADAM

Wait. Wait a minute.

BOYD

What?

ADAM

We can't do this.

BOYD

We've already done this.

ADAM

No, I mean the suitcases. We can't

bury them in suitcases.

MICHAEL

Why?

ADAM

It's sacrilegious.

BOYD

How do you figure?

ADAM

According to Jewish law, the blood

and limbs are considered to be part

of the human being. They must be

buried together or their souls won't

rest in peace.

BOYD

So that's what we're doing.

ADAM

No we're not. The bodies are all

mixed up. We can't do this to them.

BOYD

She's Asian. They don't have Jews in

Asia.

ADAM

That is absolutely not true.

BOYD

(beat)

Well what the fuck are we supposed

to do?

ADAM

(as if reasonable)

Open the suitcases, unpack the body

parts and reunite the limbs.

FISHER

No way.

ADAM

It has to be done.

BOYD

We have to get going.

ADAM

I am not flexible on this.

BOYD

Alright. Let's do it.

BOYD

I got her arm.

MOORE

Here's his head.

CUT TO:

BOYD

Now I am the last to say that we

have done here is a good thing. It's

not. It's not a good thing. But it

was, given the circumstances, the

smart play. We did what had to be

done. And... well... I'm proud of

us. I'm proud of each and every one

of us. We performed. Under the most

complex and nerve shattering of

situations, we stood fast and we

delivered. I feel proud.

ADAM

We are all going straight to hell.

Either hell or prison, whichever

comes first.

BOYD

Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell

is for cowards, for hypocrites who

fear to live by the strength of their

own convictions. This is war. Given

the circumstances and given the fact

that we are alive and they are not,

we have chosen life over death. Two

wrongs don't make a right. So our

conviction and execution would only

mean more death here, not less.

MOORE

Boyd... I don't know man... It just

seems to me that ever since you took

Tony Robbins self-help thing... you're

all fucked-up in the head.

FISHER

I got to agree with that.

BOYD

That is a load of shit. Personal

power has nothing to do with any of

this. Tony Robbins has helped me to

unlock energy and see my options

more clearly, yes, but to give him

credit for this, for all of this...

Well that's just more than the man

deserves.

FISHER

I think we should say some words

over the grave.

BOYD

What kind of words?

FISHER

I'm talking about prayer.

BOYD

Go ahead.

FISHER

Dear God... I don't know how to pray.

MICHAEL

Just go ahead and say what's on your

mind.

BOYD

Speak from the heart my brother.

ADAM

This is pathetic.

MICHAEL

You're pathetic.

ADAM

(turning on Michael)

What did you say?

MICHAEL

(pointing)

You're not a team player.

ADAM

Don't point at me.

MICHAEL

You never were a team player. That's

why you never had any friends.

ADAM

I have plenty of friends.

MICHAEL

The hell you do.

ADAM

The hell I don't.

MICHAEL

You have acquaintances -- business

friends and superficial golf buddies.

You have always been a fringe player.

You have some serious male on male

intimacy problems.

ADAM

What are you fucking talking about?

FISHER

Michael, now is probably not the

best time for this.

BOYD

No, this is the perfect time. This

is real time. Adam. Your brother and

I, as well as several others present,

have always suspected that you...

(points to Adam)

...are a fully repressed, living in

major denial, locked down, fly-boy

butt-fucker.

FISHER

Dear God, please forgive us for what

we have done here tonight. We have

lost our way. Speaking for myself,

let me say...

DISSOLVE TO:

FISHER (V.O.)

...I am deeply in love with the woman

I am about to marry and I look very

much forward to raising a family and

being a positive member of society.

We promise, if you forgive us, we

will never forget this tragedy and

will try with all our powers to use

it as a daily reminder that we are

here on earth to do good not evil.

Let us go from this day forward with

new purpose and spirit. You have

given us a second chance and let us

take that second chance and use it

as fuel to feed our fires of

productivity so that the spirits of

the two we now bury live on forever

in the good deeds and positive

achievements we from this moment on

shall make our life's work...

FISHER (V.O.)

Thank you lord, and again, we ask

for your forgiveness and guidance...

Amen.

LIZ (V.O.)

Hello.

FISHER

Hey. It's me.

LIZ (V.O.)

Where are you?

FISHER

We're on our way home. I just...

we're running a little late.

LIZ (V.O.)

How late?

FISHER

No. Just like an hour or so.

LIZ (V.O.)

What about the chairs?

FISHER

Okay.

LIZ (V.O.)

What okay?

FISHER

What!

LIZ (V.O.)

The chairs.

FISHER

I left a message. I think it's going

to be okay.

LIZ (V.O.)

You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?

FISHER

No. No. I'll see you in about four

hours.

LIZ (V.O.)

(distant; unheard)

Do you love me?

ADAM

I want you to hear me out.

FISHER

What.

ADAM

You and I have done nothing. You

especially. We are innocent.

FISHER

I don't think so.

ADAM

We are. We go to the police. We tell

them the truth. Now. Before they

find out. Now. We save ourselves.

BOYD

Let's go!

ADAM

We save ourselves. It's our only

chance.

FADE TO BLACK:

ADAM JR.

(screaming)

Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

BOYD

The past is the past. Today is the

beginning of the rest of our lives.

MOORE

Today is the best day of the rest of

our lives.

FISHER

(disgusted)

The first day.

MOORE

What?

FISHER

(disgusted & depressed)

It goes; "Today is the first day of

the rest of our lives."

BOYD

However it goes, the point is, nobody

says anything to anyone ever.

Right?... Right?

MICHAEL

Right.

MOORE

That's right.

BOYD

You're goddamn right. Adam?

ADAM

(reluctant)

Right.

LOIS

(with camera)

Group shot. Here we go boys! Yes

sir, compare and contrast time!

LOIS

Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do

you kids take note?

(taking pictures)

See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass

friends look?!

LIZ

What's the word on the chairs?

FISHER

I'm working on it.

LIZ

Then you'd better work on it in the

car. We gotta go see the Judge.

JUDGE TOWER

We don't say "love, honor and obey"

anymore. And we don't say "till death

do us part." Today we say, "respect,

honor and cherish, as long as you

both do love." How does that sound?

LIZ

I kind of like "till death do us

part." I mean, this is forever. In

sickness and in health, through good

times and bad. Honey, what do you

think?

FISHER

Yea... It's great... seems like... I

don't know you've got all the

important stuff in there.

JUDGE TOWER

All right then. It's refreshing to

see two young people not afraid of

real commitment. Will you have friends

or family saying words -- singing or

anything?

FISHER

(beat)

Are we supposed to?

JUDGE TOWER

It's not a question of supposed to,

it's an entirely personal decision...

Some do some don't.

LIZ

We don't think so. I mean, we just

want the singing when I come out.

JUDGE TOWER

Okay great. What will that be?

LIZ

We're just going to have the leader

of the band sing alone with his

guitar. Acoustic.

JUDGE TOWER

What song?

LIZ

"You Send Me."

JUDGE TOWER

Oh I know that. How does it go...

LIZ

You know,

(talks it)

Darling you... you send me... Darling

you... You mend me.

(to Fisher)

Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.

FISHER

(sings)

"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send

me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe,

mend me.

LIZ

"At first I thought it was

infatuation... But oh it's lasted so

long..."

FISHER & LIZ

"Now I find myself wanting to marry

you, marry you and take you home..."

MR. FISHER

I wanted to just take this final

opportunity to visit with you. You

know, just to be with you, father

and son, before you run off and do

your own husband, daddy thing.

(starts to choke-up)

I'm just so goddamn proud of you...

God knows I didn't always play it

right with you...

FISHER

You did all right dad.

MR. FISHER

I could have done it better. I'm a

fucking ball-buster I am.

FISHER

You never walked away dad. You could

have walked away.

MR. FISHER

I'm just so scared of that song.

That fucking, "My son just arrived

the other day... he says thanks for

the ball, come on let's play. I got

lots of bills come again next day.

He's grown up just like me... My boy

is just like me." Gordon fucking

Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever,

that song just fucking kills me.

FISHER

Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."

MR. FISHER

Just kills me...

FISHER

I love you dad.

MR. FISHER

I love you so much it hurts. Me and

your mother marvel at what you have

become. You're going to have a

wonderful journey with this girl. I

feel it deep inside. A wonderful,

magical journey.

(cries again)

And I'm, like I said, just so proud

of how you turned out. (hugs Fisher)

You go out and knock 'em dead Keith.

Knock 'em dead!

CUT TO:

FISHER

Where did you get that?

MICHAEL

At the newsstand on 3rd.

ADAM

(falling apart)

Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot.

They're on to us.

MICHAEL

They're not on to us. I'm gonna call

Boyd.

BOYD

Oh that's just nothing. That's just

a missing persons thing, that's all.

MICHAEL

You said nobody would miss her.

BOYD

No. I said nobody knew she was coming

to the hotel.

ADAM

(grabs phone)

Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming

down!

BOYD

What does that mean?

ADAM

You got us into this mess.

BOYD

Oh I did? I think it was your little

rat fuck brother who decided to play

Hamburger Helper with the hooker's

head.

ADAM

(freaks)

Would you, shush?! These phones aren't

secure!

BOYD

Lighten up Adam. Show some character.

ADAM

Don't talk to me about character.

BOYD

Watch the tone fella.

ADAM

Fuck you Boyd!

BOYD

Any time fat boy!

LIZ

I love it. I just love, love, love,

love it.

MAGGIE

Are you guys gonna fill this place

with kids? You sure got room for

them.

LIZ

We're in no hurry. I think we'll

take some time to enjoy each other,

enjoy our freedom before we surrender

ourselves to kids.

MAGGIE

Take your time. I wish I had.

LIZ

(hugs Fisher)

We will.

MAGGIE

So where to on the honeymoon?

FISHER

This is our honeymoon.

LIZ

After the wedding, which we're paying

for ourselves, and this house...

MAGGIE

Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big

picture, take your time. I wish I

had.

LIZ

That's our plan.

MAGGIE

Well, I just need your signature on

these contracts and a deposit check

so I can get the ball rolling.

FISHER

How much?

MAGGIE

Five percent should be fine for now,

which is, let's see, twenty thousand

dollars. Of course I'll be splitting

my commission with your friend.

(beat)

He is a very sweet man.

KIDS

(singing)

"Do your balls hang low, do they

wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em

in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow?"

ADAM

(snapping)

Knock it off!

LOIS

Don't snap at them!

ADAM

They're driving me nuts!

LOIS

They're singing.

ADAM

(getting out)

It's a disgusting song.

SUIT

How ya doing?

ADAM

(nervous mumble)

What?

SUIT

What's that?

ADAM

What did you say?

SUIT

I said how's it going?

ADAM

I didn't hear you.

SUIT

Well that's what I said.

SUIT

How do you like that mini-van?

LOIS

Honey, go in there and get some

Starbursts.

ADAM

What?

LOIS

They're screaming for Starbursts.

ADAM

Later.

LOIS

They're screaming like monsters and

it's giving me a headache. Go get

some fucking Starbursts.

ADAM

Fine.

ADAM

Oh my God.

COP (O.S.)

Excuse me.

COP

You okay?

CLERK

Just leave it!

ADAM

(determined)

It's okay.

CLERK

Leave it!

CLERK

GET OUT!

ADAM

(on his back)

I'm sorry.

ADAM

(tears in his eyes)

I'm sorry.

CLERK

GET OUT!

SUIT

The wife's begging me for one. How's

the mileage.

LOIS

Where's the candy?

ADAM

There is no candy!

LOIS

What do you mean? It's it's a goddamn

Mini-Mart?!

KIDS

Dad?!

ADAM

Have you thought about what I said?

FISHER

Jesus Adam, can we not get into this

now please?

ADAM

I got a migraine like a little monkey

kicking in the side of my skull,

Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge

hammer trying to crack...

FISHER

(cuts him off)

I got you.

ADAM

(dazed)

Where's the bathroom?

MR. FISHER

(holding picture of

Keith, age 4, on a

mule)

And this is Keith at age four and

his best friend "Bunker the Mule."

Evidently, when they were in camp,

Keith and Boyd got into some serious

arguments over exactly who was Keith's

best friend -- Boyd or the mule.

BOYD

Fisher had a less than normal

relationship with that Donkey.

FISHER

(seated next to Liz)

You always were a jealous man.

MR. FISHER

After camp came football, and for

those of you not following the sports

pages back in 1977, you might not

remember the Peewee Powerhouse

Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant

leadership of your's truly, rolled

to an auspicious league record of 0-

12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns.

MICHAEL

The problem was coaching. Poor

leadership.

BOYD

The problem was our quarterback had

trouble remembering his right from

left...

FISHER

No, the problem, as I recall, was

the lack of blocking...

FISHER

You all right?

ADAM

I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry.

BOYD

(approaching)

OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely

inappropriate behavior here.

FISHER

Shut up Boyd.

BOYD

Negative. This is not what we have

worked out in terms of presented

behavior.

FISHER

He's having a problem here.

MICHAEL

What's the problem Adam?

MOORE

What's the problem?

BOYD

What is your problem?

ADAM

I can't do this.

MOORE

Can't do what?

ADAM

We're gonna get caught. I know we're

gonna get caught. They were eyeballing

my car.

BOYD

What?

ADAM

At the seven-eleven.

BOYD

Who? What are you talking about?

ADAM

They're on me. They're smoking me

out!

BOYD

(shouts)

Nobody's smoking anybody out.

FISHER

Shut up.

MOORE

Quiet.

LIZ

Keith? Is everything okay, honey?

FISHER

Yeah baby. Everything's great.

LIZ

Well, can you come back inside?

FISHER

(not moving)

Yeah. Sure.

LIZ

Now?

FISHER

Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in.

I just... we're just taking care of

some Groomsmen last minute business.

MR. FISHER

Everything okay?

FISHER

Yeah, Dad. It's great.

MR. FISHER

Well, I'm in the middle of my goddamn

toast here.

FISHER

OK, OK. You guys just go back in.

Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll

be right in. Go on.

BOYD

(on Adam)

You got some mighty fucking fine bad

timing Adam. We got a rehearsal

situation here.

ADAM

I don't give a damn.

MICHAEL

About anybody but yourself. You never

have.

ADAM

And you're a little fucking reject.

MICHAEL

Eat my ass!

ADAM

Hey!

ADAM

If you ever touch my minivan again,

I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

MICHAEL

You're a loser.

ADAM

You're the loser! A big black hole

sucking up everything you touch! YOU

MURDERED THAT GIRL! MURDERER!

MURDERER!

MICHAEL

You're the loser! You think your

shit's so fucking righteous! FUCK

YOU! You were there with us, boy!

Right there! SIDE BY FUCKING SIDE!!!

FISHER

Shut up!

BOYD

Shut your fucking mouths!!!

ADAM

(freaking)

I didn't do anything! I'll turn your

pathetic ass in!

BOYD

Adam! Calm down.

ADAM

I won't calm down. I can't do this.

We can't do this. It won't work. It

will not work.

BOYD

It has worked.

ADAM

I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber

optics, search parties, they got

infrared scanners, FBI scientists.

They figure this shit out. They always

figure it out.

BOYD

They won't figure it out.

ADAM

I got children. I've got a life.

MICHAEL

You got a retarded kid and a fat pig

wife.

ADAM

You fucking bastard!

LIZ

Keith?!

FISHER

Everything's OK. Just some more

preparations.

LIZ

Are they fighting?

FISHER

No baby. We'll all be right in.

BOYD

This is going to stop right now.

Right now!

MICHAEL

(seething)

You will not screw this up.

ADAM

Don't you threaten me you little rat

fuck.

MICHAEL

Don't you fucking threaten me --

I'll fucking kill you.

ADAM

Go home!

MICHAEL

You go home!

BOYD

Why don't you just cool out. Go home

and go to sleep.

BOYD

Just go home, chill the fuck out.

Okay?

BOYD

Just go home.

BOYD

All right. Let's all go back in.

Adam? You're cool right?

ADAM

No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at

all.

MICHAEL

Mr. Fucking Minivan...

ADAM

NOOOO!!!!

CUT TO:

BOYD

It was just a crazy freak accident.

He thought the car was in reverse...

He didn't realize.

COP

Was there some sort of an argument?

FISHER

No. Nothing like that.

COP

We heard there was some arguing going

on. Some loud talk.

BOYD

No. No. We were just all outside

just talking.

COP

What were you talking about?

BOYD

The wedding. We were talking bout

how it was going to be one of the

last times for us to all be together

with Fisher not being married...

COP

A lot of people seem to think there

was some hostility out there.

BOYD

(getting righteous)

Well I can't really comment on what

"a lot of people" thought. I can

only tell you that we had a horrible

accident here and were all feeling

extremely traumatized and your

questions are a bit poorly timed.

We're in full on grieving mode right

now thank you very much Officer...

Randone.

FISHER

Easy Boyd.

BOYD

No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in

there in pieces. How about a little

sensitivity?

COP

That's all I wanted to know.

DOCTOR

His situation is critical. He's asking

to speak to his wife.

BOYD

The need to know is clear. What did

Adam tell Lois? That's the name of

the game. What did Adam tell Lois?

What does Lois know?

MICHAEL

Ball park sausages.

BOYD

You want some breakfast meat, Michael.

Is that what you want?

MICHAEL

(clearly starting to

crack)

Franco Harris has a flare for the

dramatic. The former Pittsburgh

Steeler running back, beat known for

"The Immaculate Reception," his

improbable sixty yard Ricochet

Reception. I say Ricochet Reception

has made a bold move on corporate

America.

(inappropriately loud)

Harris has lead a group of investors

in the purchase of the Park Sausage

Company. By taking on the challenge

of resurrecting Park's, Harris is

engaged in the equivalent of a sudden

death overtime.

BOYD

Easy Michael.

MICHAEL

(on a roll)

He must take an open-field run to

profitability through excessive debt

large competitors and dwindling market

share. Before the clock runs out.

MOORE

Shut up Michael.

MICHAEL

(screams)

I KILLED MY BROTHER!

BOYD

Okay. Time to fly.

MICHAEL

I ran down my brother in cold blood.

Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame!

MICHAEL

(struggling)

Time to pay the man. "For if we

confess our sins he is faithful and

just, to forgive us our sins, and to

cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

FISHER

(tipping Waitress)

Thank you.

MICHAEL

"Kill one man and you are a murderer!

Kill millions and you are a conqueror --

Kill all and you are a God!"

MICHAEL

(calming down)

"The memory of the just is blessed

but the name of the wicked shall

rot."

BOYD

You will get yourself together here

mister. Are you hearing me?

FISHER

He's cracked up.

BOYD

He is not cracking up.

FISHER

Boyd... What have we done?

BOYD

What did you ask me?

FISHER

What?

BOYD

What is the question you asked me?

FISHER

I said, what have we done?

BOYD

Yes, you did. Now that is the

question! That is exactly the question

we should be asking ourselves. You

tell me Fisher. What have we done?

FISHER

I don't know! I just want to get

married.

BOYD

Say it again.

FISHER

What?

BOYD

What you just said. Say it again.

FISHER

I just want to get married.

BOYD

Exactly! Exactly my point.

MOORE

What's your fucking point?

BOYD

I'm not talking to you?

FISHER

What's your point?

BOYD

You want to know what you are doing

here?! You are love pumping. You are

protecting all that is sacred and

beautiful and in sync with poetry

and sunsets and little newborn babies.

You are walking the walk. This is it

Fisher, the real stuff. You love

this woman. Love is second to nothing.

I love you. I love Moore. I love

Michael. This car is full of love,

and nothing -- absolutely nothing --

supersedes love, man. Nothing. We

will do what it takes. Whatever it

takes.

BOYD

Love does not lose.

FADE OUT:

BOYD

Easy Michael.

LIZ

(hysterical)

Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of

your fucking mind?!

FISHER

Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking

about modifying.

LIZ

No way.

FISHER

Can we just talk this out?

LIZ

Talk what out? We are locked and

loaded here. We are non-refundable.

I've got relatives on the airport

right now! I've got...

LIZ

Answer it!

FISHER

Hello?

LOIS

Keith. It's Lois. I just found a

note up in Adam's study. It's some

kind of crazy confession about killing

a stripper and cutting up bodies

and...

FISHER

(explaining)

...burying them outside of Vegas,

about Boyd being the ring leader...

She wants to know what the hell is

going on and I'm starting to freak

out here.

MICHAEL

We're goosed.

BOYD

We're not goosed.

MOORE

What's goosed?

BOYD

What is her disposition?

FISHER

Regarding what?

BOYD

Does she sound pissed, scared,

hostile? Did she mention the police?

FISHER

No, but she's definitely pissed and

hostile. And she's clearly starting

to think that's something's not right.

MICHAEL

We're goosed! Goosed by God!

BOYD

Michael get a grip.

(to Fisher)

What did you tell her?

FISHER

I told her that I have no idea what

Adam was talking about in that letter.

MOORE

Did she believe you?

FISHER

I have no idea.

MOORE

You can tell when people believe

you. It's obvious.

FISHER

Well I don't have that skill and if

I had to guess I would say that in

no way did she believe me.

MICHAEL

(screaming)

Goosed!

BOYD

Stop it!

MICHAEL

Goosed!

BOYD

Stop.

MICHAEL

Goosed!

BOYD

(to Moore)

Give me the Valium.

MOORE

He just had two.

BOYD

Give me two more.

BOYD

(to Michael)

Open sesame.

FISHER

Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.

BOYD

Suck my ass.

LOIS

I never liked you Boyd. You're a

snaky little fuck. Always have been.

BOYD

What are you talking about?

LOIS

Don't sweet lip me.

BOYD

I don't understand where this personal

attack is coming from...

LOIS

You're a liar. I want to know what

happened in Vegas.

BOYD

Nothing happened in Vegas.

LOIS

I don't want to hear it from the

liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher?

What happened in Vegas?

FISHER

(beat)

Nothing happened in Vegas.

LOIS

(not buying it)

Moore?

MOORE

(sheepish)

Nothing happened.

LOIS

Michael? Do you have something to

tell me?

BOYD

Michael. Tell Lois that nothing...

LOIS

Shut up Boyd! Michael?

MICHAEL

(quiet)

Goosed.

LOIS

What?

MICHAEL

Lois we were bad, we were very, very

bad.

BOYD

He's upset about Adam. We're all

upset.

LOIS

I will call the police right now if

I don't start getting some answers.

BOYD

Lois please.

LOIS

Fuck you Boyd.

FISHER

Okay. Lois... here's the deal.

(beat)

Adam was with a prostitute in Las

Vegas.

LOIS

What?

FISHER

I'm sorry he was unfaithful to you.

BOYD

And it wasn't the first time... He

had a thing about prostitutes.

LOIS

(crushed)

My Adam?

BOYD

We're sorry.

BOYD

Mommy just needs a little time out.

Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

(the boys don't answer)

Okay.

BOYD

After you drop the kids off, take

Michael home. Put a few drinks in

him so he'll sleep.

FISHER

I don't think that's such a good

idea.

BOYD

Just do it.

FISHER

What are you going to do?

BOYD

Take care of business.

FISHER

(accusing)

What does that mean?

BOYD

And what does that mean?

(off no response)

Are you insane?!

(whispers)

You think I would hurt Lois?! She's

the mother of those kids! What is

wrong with you?

FISHER

I don't know...

BOYD

You got a nasty side to your thought

process.

TIME CUT TO:

FISHER

I'm sorry. Honey... it's just for

tonight.

FISHER

Lois is a mess and Michael's really

upset. Everyone's upset.

LIZ

We're not canceling.

FISHER

I know.

LIZ

I won't even discuss it.

FISHER

No one's discussing it. I'm just

gonna run Michael home. I'll be right

back.

LIZ

I need you to pick up the cake

tomorrow.

FISHER

Don't we already have someone to do

that for us?

LIZ

Yeah. You.

FISHER

Okay. Okay.

MICHAEL

(finger in his ear)

Do you hear buzzing fish?

FISHER

Buzzing?

MICHAEL

Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing.

Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just

chipping away in the back of my skull.

FISHER

I don't hear it.

MICHAEL

Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.

FISHER

Have another drink.

MICHAEL

Dad used to bring home these sparklers

to me and Adam. Out back we'd light

'em up. The three of us. We'd hold

'em up to the sky and watch the

explosions of light. Sparks. And dad

would be all... "Get ready"... "watch

for it"... "here it comes," here

comes the "wahoo"

FISHER

The wahoo?

MICHAEL

The sparkler would burn hot, then

hotter, then even hotter... and there

would be one moment of pure burn

when that little fucker would cook

just perfect. Perfect. It would only

last a second, but that second was

it. It was it. That's what dad had

us looking for... You get me?

FISHER

The wahoo moment?

MICHAEL

That's my point! You see Man...

burning at his absolute. To see all

the forces just come together, just

right, you know, just in perfect

harmony. That's what I'm driving at.

You get me?

FISHER

I think so.

MICHAEL

I've been looking for that flash and

I look and I look and I can't find

it. And what if I already had it?

You know. My moment? What if it's

gone? And I never saw it?

(finishes drink)

You're getting married, man. That's

a fucking beautiful thing. Just a

beautiful thing. I just can't stop

breaking beautiful things.

LOIS

You picked the wrong woman mother-

fucker!

MICHAEL

You see for me it's over. Over baby.

I'm gonna turn myself in. After the

wedding of course. After the wedding.

Out of respect.

MOORE

I don't think that's a good idea.

MICHAEL

I said out of respect. Respect for

you Fisher. For you and your wedding

and your beautiful bride. There will

be no more rain. You see where I am

here?

FISHER

I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe

you ought to just ease up on yourself

a bit.

MICHAEL

No. No. No. This is my doing. You

see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark

for my own. For Lois and the kids,

for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna

turn myself in. I am all that. I'm

gonna do it for sweet Lois.

MICHAEL

If I was to think... If I were to

think... No I mean I have thinked it

over... I have. And without putting

a lot of pressure on you I just...

Well I just...

FISHER

What is it?

MICHAEL

(drunk-slow)

Well if you do think about names...

Michael's a pretty good one... It's

done me all right.

FISHER

(answers)

Yeah.

BOYD

(into the phone)

Okay. Here's the deal and it's a

good one. Lois is cool. It's a

pacified situation.

FISHER

What does that mean?

BOYD

I'm talking about Lois having relaxed

her anxiety. Only deal is... you

still got Michael there?

FISHER

Yeah.

BOYD

Good deal. Lois just wants to hear

it from Michael.

FISHER

Hear what?

BOYD

That it was all an accident. She

wants to here it from Michael's mouth.

FISHER

Now?

BOYD

That's right.

FISHER

Isn't it a little late?

BOYD

Hold on a sec.

(turns)

Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather

do this in the morning?

BOYD

(back into phone)

She says now's the time.

(quietly)

I got a peace treaty thing happening

over here... let's get this over

with.

BOYD

Okay Michael, let's go.

(helps him out)

Upsy daisy big guy.

MICHAEL

(hammered)

How about my Fatburger?

BOYD

Come on tough guy. Listen to me.

(takes Michaels face

in his hands)

You are going to tell Lois that it

was all an accident. Okay cowboy?

You got me?

MICHAEL

I love you.

MOORE

He's too drunk.

BOYD

He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.

(to Fisher and Moore)

You guys stay here.

MOORE

(beat)

I'm thinking about maybe making a

move.

FISHER

A move?

MOORE

Greenpeace.

FISHER

Greenpeace?

MOORE

Maybe go up to the North Pole, the

Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart

guns. I've always had a pretty good

aim...

BOYD

Michael was having an affair with

Lois. That's what Michael and Adam

were arguing about in the parking

lot. Michael killed Adam in a jealous

rage. Lois broke it off with Michael,

he strangled her to death and then

shot himself in the head.

(beat)

Happens all the time.

BOYD

That Lois fought like a fucking

Comanche.

BARRY MORRIS

I don't see how this could have been

kept from you. The facts are quite

simple; last month Adam and Lois

changed their will. They requested

that you two, as a married couple,

be the Custodians of Record for their

estate including all properties,

cash holdings, security holdings

and... children. You are legal

custodians of the Brenn Trust.

LIZ

My god.

BARRY MORRIS

There's more.

FISHER

More?

BARRY MORRIS

Adam and Lois were not terribly

prudent in terms of providing for

the possibility of the unforeseen.

FISHER

What are you talking about?

BARRY MORRIS

I'm talking about Life insurance.

I'm talking about money.

LIZ

Money?

BARRY MORRIS

Yes money. Adam had a five hundred

thousand dollar Term Life Insurance

Policy.

LIZ

What does that mean?

FISHER

That means we get five hundred

thousand to help raise the kids.

LIZ

(amazed)

No.

FISHER

Yes.

BARRY MORRIS

Actually, no. Adam was switching to

a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled

his medical exam... and failed to

make his last payment... so his Term

Life lapsed. So it's value is null

and void.

(off Liz's horror)

Now he did have a pension account,

worth another 150 thousand.

LIZ

(relieved)

Well, oh...

BARRY MORRIS

And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.

LIZ

So where's that leave us?

FISHER

150 plus 350... we still get 500

thousand.

BARRY MORRIS

(beat)

No. Not even close. With property

values down, the house is worth

100,000 less than 450 he paid for

it. With three credit cards, the

minivan payments, and other

outstanding debts... Plus the Income

and Estate Taxes assessed on his

IRA...

(punches his calculator)

You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood

of, ah... 14,223 dollars.

LITTLE ADAM

Get away from me!

FISHER

I'm just trying to help...

LITTLE ADAM

I don't want your help!

FISHER

Stop kicking. Stop kicking!

BARRY MORRIS

(breaking the tension)

So. When is the wedding.

LIZ

Tomorrow

(at Fisher)

We are getting married tomorrow.

LIZ

It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for

Mama. Cry for Mama.

FISHER

No it's not okay. It's not.

LIZ

Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.

FISHER

(sobbing)

Liz we've got to cancel, we have to

put it off.

LIZ

(ice)

Don't even.

FISHER

Do you love me?

LIZ

What?

FISHER

Do you love me?

LIZ

What kind of stupid question is that?

FISHER

(breaking down)

Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a

woman. We...

LIZ

What are you talking about?

FISHER

(completely hysterical)

Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael

crushed her skull. She was dead.

There was nothing else to do. It was

an accident.

LIZ

Who's dead?

FISHER

The prostitute.

LIZ

You fucked a prostitute?

FISHER

No Michael did. It was an accident.

LIZ

You killed a prostitute.

FISHER

Michael, by accident.

LIZ

Call the police.

FISHER

It's too late.

LIZ

My God. You've got to call the police,

tell them it was an accident. Where

is she?

FISHER

She's in the desert. She's out in

the desert.

LIZ

You left a dead prostitute out in

the desert? Alone?

FISHER

She's not alone... She's... Boyd...

Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed

Lois and Michael... it's all...

LIZ

Stop! You stop right here. I don't

want to know anymore. I told you not

to do this Bachelor Party thing. You

were warned.

FISHER

But...

LIZ

No buts. I told you your friends

were Jackasses.

FISHER

But...

LIZ

No buts. I've waited twenty-seven

years, twenty-seven years I have

focused and prepared to walk down

that aisle. I will not be derailed!

I will not be embarrassed! I will

not be denied! I am walking down

that aisle tomorrow come hell or

high fucking water!

BOYD

Okay, we're about two minutes out.

Moore, better take your position.

BOYD

Chop chop.

BOYD

This is a situation that defies

judgement. We have acted and showed

courage that is not of a kind known

by most.

FISHER

I'm getting really tired of your

bullshit.

BOYD

My what?

FISHER

You've got a warped thought process.

Your brain doesn't function properly.

BOYD

You care to add a little specification

to that slanderous accusation?

FISHER

(snaps)

I'm talking about some bad, bad,

very bad things. Bad things! Those

are bad fucking things!

BOYD

Okay fine.

FISHER

Fine? Fine what?

BOYD

Whatever you say Kojak.

FISHER

I'm serious.

BOYD

I'm serious. I'm the serious one

here. I'm the one making the play.

I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my

money.

LIZ

I told Boyd two fucking minutes!

FISHER

What money?

BOYD

Blood money. Insurance dollars that

you have thus fucking far decided

not to tell me about at all. In no

way have you mentioned that money.

And I find that to be very very

offensive.

FISHER

You're sick.

BOYD

(veins pulsing)

And if you think you can fuck me,

don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated

Fisher. Protected. Backed up on

floppy. Do you get me? I want my

fucking money!

FISHER

Not a prayer.

BOYD

I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up

all night in the rain, in stormy

gale force wind, tornado and fucking

earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I

stay lit. I don't go dark. I never

go dark!

FISHER

You need help.

BOYD

I want that money!

LIZ

(composing herself)

Here comes the bride.

MOORE

Where's Boyd?

FISHER

(whispers)

Downstairs in the closet.

JUDGE TOWER

May we have the rings please?

FISHER

What?

JUDGE TOWER

The rings?

MOORE

Got 'em.

JUDGE TOWER

(continues)

These rings represent the commitment

Fisher and Liz make to each other on

the day. Fisher do you take Liz to

be your beloved wife, to respect,

honor and cherish till death do you

part?

FISHER

I do.

JUDGE TOWER

Liz do you take Fisher to be your

beloved husband, to respect, honor

and cherish him till death do you

part?

LIZ

I do.

JUDGE TOWER

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

MOORE

He came to me early today, was talking

about money, insurance money. Said

he was gonna get what was his.

FISHER

My God...

MOORE

He said he was the Brain Trust. Said

he was smarter than all of us. He

started reading "Atlas Shrugged,"

staring at himself in the mirror.

FISHER

Did he try to kiss you?

MOORE

All week long.

FISHER

He kept saying he was protected.

LIZ

What does that mean?

FISHER

Like if something happened to him,

he could still get us.

LIZ

Like how?

FISHER

I don't know. He could have told

someone. He could have, like in the

event of his death, somehow let

someone know where those bodies are

buried.

LIZ

The only proof is those bodies.

FISHER

So what do we do?

LIZ

Move the bodies.

FISHER

Move the bodies?

OLD MAN (O.S.)

Excuse us?

OLD MAN

We just wanted to say

congratulations and

wish you great

happiness. Mazeltov. I

just did. I said

Malzeltov. You never

listen to me.

OLD WOMAN

We're your Uncle Henry's

parents. Opal and Earl.

Tell them from both of us.

Malzeltov. Wish them luck.

The secret to a good

marriage is to listen.

LIZ

(cheerleader smile)

Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye

bye.

FISHER

I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was

for you to be happy. I just wanted

to give you the wedding, the life

you always dreamed of...

(sobs)

...I just love you so much... So

much...

LIZ

(beat; unmoved)

You and Moore move the bodies and

bury Boyd with them. In fact, put

Moore in the ground too.

FISHER

What?

LIZ

If you don't tie up all the lose

ends it'll never be over.

FISHER

(horrified)

No...

LIZ

You put him down or don't bother

coming back.

FISHER

But...

LIZ

Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!

MOORE

You alright?

FISHER

Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's

Franco Harris fixation. You know how

Michael was always harping "Immaculate

Reception?" I've seen that play. A

lot of times... and I have to say

this... Franco was lucky. Flat out,

right place, right time. That's it.

He was where the ball bounced. You

get me?

MOORE

I guess.

FISHER

I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You

work your entire life, all the

training, focus, all the dedication,

all irrelevant. Where does the ball

bounce? My father spent his whole

life trying to start a company,

practiced every day, worked like a

dog, finally got enough money. He's

paid the dues, he's ready, does all

the market research, picks his shot --

"Pup Corn."

MOORE

Pup corn?

FISHER

That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie

treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's

figured it out. There is a hole in

the market and he's going to fill

it. Spends all out money, works

himself into not two but three heart

attacks getting this shit up. After

fifteen months, the big day arrives,

the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off

the belt. He comes running home with

that box, pulls us out of school. We

all pile into the living room, must

be fifty of us, and in comes

"Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here

Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got

that little fucking pup corn in his

hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat

anything, she eats rocks, anything.

She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks

down at the little pellet, licks it

once, turns around, walks out of the

room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn."

Fifteen months of my dad's life,

right there. Not one dog ate Pup

Corn. Not one. Three months later,

"Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven.

My father never got over it. Never.

FISHER

I think it was over here.

MOORE

It was over by those rocks.

FISHER

There.

MOORE

Where?

FISHER

There. This rock is where I stood

when I said the prayer.

FISHER

Bingo.

MOORE

Got it.

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

MOORE

I've been thinking about what you

said that day. The prayer. About

using this whole mess to bring out

the good in me...

FISHER

Yeah?

MOORE

I think there's a lot of truth in

that. I'm gonna pursue some options.

I want to join that Big Brother thing.

FISHER

(slowly raises the

shovel over his head)

That's a good one.

MOORE

I want a black one. A little black

brother. That's a big problem it

seems to me. Lack of racial

integration. That's a big one. You

think?

MOORE

What do you think?

FISHER

I think you'd make an excellent Big

Brother.

MOORE

(back to work)

That's what I'm thinking.

DISSOLVE:

SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

MOORE

Well that ought to be about the end

of that.

FISHER

Yup.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And it's Franco Harris running for...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

A TOUCHDOWN FOR PITTSBURGH!

UNBELIEVABLE!

CUT BACK TO:

CUT TO BLACK:

FISHER

Okay let's try it again.

TIMMY

A scout is thrifty,

saves for the future.

A scout is clean, he

keeps his body...

ADAM JR.

A scout is brave. A scout

can face danger, even if

he's afraid...

FISHER

Let's see the salutes!

TIMMY

(to Adam Jr.)

Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

FISHER

It's okay, it's okay.

FISHER (O.S.)

Timmy SHUT UP! Help your brother!

ADAM! Let him help you!

FISHER

Remember a scout is helpful! A scout

doesn't scream in the face of

adversity.

FISHER

(to the boys)

Okay, let's skip to the Scout's

Oath...

ADAM JR. & TIMMY

On my honor, I will do my best...

ADAM JR. & TIMMY

...to do my duty to God and my

country... To obey the Scout Law, to

help other people at all times...

ADAM JR. & TIMMY

To keep myself physically strong,

mentally awake, and morally straight.

CUT TO BLACK:

THE END
