MALIK'S VOICE

I'm gonna kill this dog!  You make my

wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this

fuckin' dog!

LEIFITZ

They're good to go, Talley.  Your word,

and we're in the house.

TALLEY

No one's going anywhere, L-T.  We can

talk this guy down.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

Hey, George?  George, don't kill the dog,

okay?  We don't want to hear a gun go off

in there.

MALIK'S VOICE

(screaming from the house)

Fuck you!

LEIFITZ

I don't think he wants to talk.

TALLEY

Where's the guy's wife?

KEITH

She didn't take the kid to her sister's.

The neighbors were wrong.

TALLEY

Goddamnit, you said we had her.  I told

him we had her!

KEITH

We got bad information, Talley.  I can't

pull her out of my ass!

MALIK

(shouting at Talley)

You said my wife was gonna talk to me,

you lying fuck!  I'm gonna kill her dog,

then shoot myself!  I mean it!

TALLEY

(to Keith)

Pull the dog's name out of your ass.  Get

the dog's name.

LEIFITZ

(alarmed by Talley's move)

Talley!  You're in the line of fire!

TALLEY

I didn't lie to you, George.  You scared

your wife pretty good last night.  We're

having a hard time finding her.

MALIK

She better talk to me!  I'm gonna kill

her goddamned dog!

TALLEY

You and I have been talking for, what,

sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that

your dog, too?

MALIK'S VOICE

I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied

about everything else, so she probably

lied about the dog.

TALLEY

I know you're hurting.  You lose your

job, you find out your wife's fucking

another guy . . . but don't give up.

We'll have her talk to you.

MALIK'S VOICE

Then why won't she open her mouth?!  Why

doesn't the bitch say something???

TALLEY

George?  Come back to the window.

MALIK'S VOICE

STOP LOOKING AT ME!!!

TALLEY

George?  Leave the dog alone and come to

the window.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(to Leifitz)

What's the dog's name?

LEIFITZ

The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.

MALIK'S VOICE

OPEN YOUR GODDAMNED MOUTH OR I'M GONNA

SHOOT THIS DOG!

TALLEY

Murray!!  They're in the house!  His

wife's in the house!

KEVIN

C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought

we were gonna go to the movies.

DENNIS

(grins past Kevin to Mars)

Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here

on the edge, no one around, it's perfect,

right?

MARS

I'll check it out.

DENNIS

Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think

you're a dick.

KEVIN

Robbing this place is gonna put you back

in prison.

DENNIS

Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.

KEVIN

We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why

even take the chance?

DENNIS

Because if you don't take the chance,

you're already dead.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Thirty seconds, we'll be down the road.

Thirty seconds.  Then we'll go to the

movies.

MARS

It's perfect.

DENNIS

A pack of Marlboros for my friend and all

your cash, you gook motherfucker!

MARS

He's got a gun!

DENNIS

Mars, help me --

KEVIN

(screaming in the background)

Dennis!  Dennis, someone's coming!

KEVIN

There's fuckin' blood all over you!

DENNIS

I didn't know he would have a gun!  It

just went off!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Jesus!  Fuckin' Jesus, it's on my face!

MARS

Relax.  It's only blood.

DENNIS

FUCK you, Mars!  I got it all over me!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

MotherFUCKING piece of SHIT!!!

KEVIN

That woman's gonna call the cops.

DENNIS

Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!

KEVIN

What if he's dead?  What if you killed

him?

MARS

People are looking.

DENNIS

That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not

gonna go in for murder.

KEVIN

We're on foot.  We can't get away.

DENNIS

We're surrounded by houses, dumbass.

Every house has a car in the garage.

All we have to do is take one.

WALTER SMITH'S VOICE

You can pick them up whenever you want.

WALTER

(into the phone)

I have his corporate and personal on two

disks, labeled Marlon and Al.

WALTER (CONT'D)

What, you don't have a sense of humor?

He's going to love it.

THOMAS

My stomach is eating me!

WALTER

(into the phone)

Yeah, that's Thomas, the human piranha.

I have to feed the animals while Pam's in

Florida with her sister.

THOMAS

My stomach has teeth!  It's eating my

guts!

WALTER

(still with the phone)

Listen, is Glen on his way?  Great.  The

paper's bagged and ready to go.  Bye.

(hangs up; then)

All right, all right, all right--it's

feeding time!

WALTER

(calling)

Jen!  Come feed your brother!  He's

wasting away!

JENNIFER

Can't we send him to Florida?

WALTER

Jen, c'mon, chop-chop!  I've got to

finish my work!

RADIO

Four, base.  You there, Mike?

WELCH

Four.  I'm gonna hit the Krispy-Kreme.

You want a dozen?

RADIO

Armed robbery, Kim's Minimart on Flanders

Road, shots fired with a man down.

WELCH

Are you kidding me?

RADIO

Ah, suspects are three white males

driving a red pickup last seen eastbound

on Flanders.

JENNIFER

Tell Daddy that lunch is ready.

(no answer)

Thomas, don't be a turd.  Tell --!

DENNIS

(quietly)

I'm not going to hurt you.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Stop fighting.  Relax, and I'll let go.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

That's better.  Be cool and we'll be

outta here in five minutes.  Understand?

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Who else is here?

JENNIFER

My father.

DENNIS

Get your ass in the chair!  Sit down!

WALTER

(quietly)

Jen?  Are you all right?

DENNIS

She'll be dead if you don't put your ass

in that chair!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Kevin!  Don't stand there, asshole, close

the windows!  Mars, keep him covered,

dude!

WALTER

Who sent you?

DENNIS

Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about

this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you

up, then we're gonna take your car.

WALTER

The car.  All you want is the car?

DENNIS

Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car!

Gimme the goddamned keys!

WALTER

The keys are on the wall by the garage.

Take it.  The tank's almost full.

KEVIN

Dennis!  The cops!

WELCH

(into his radio mike)

They had to go through the yard at 455

Castle Way.  I'm going to approach.

DENNIS

Open it!  You remember I'm right here!

WELCH

(into his mike)

Teenage female opened the front door.

(to Jennifer)

Miss, I found an abandoned vehicle on the

other side of your wall.  Did three young

men run through the area?

WELCH (CONT'D)

Miss?

JENNIFER

I didn't . . . see anyone.

MARS

He's going for his gun!

WELCH

(into his radio)

Officer down.  Jesus, I've been shot.

RADIO VOICE

Mike?  Mike, what did you say?!

TALLEY

(into phone)

It's really hard, Jane.  This isn't the

way I want it.

JANE

(into phone)

No?  Then whose idea was it for you take

a job in the middle of nowhere?

TALLEY

I need to work out some stuff.

JANE

You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding

from the job and you're hiding from me.

TALLEY

I still see that boy's eyes.

JANE

That happened a year ago.  You've been

gone for almost six months.  How long do

you have to punish yourself for something

that wasn't your fault?

TALLEY

Is Amanda there?

JANE

(to Amanda)

It's Dad.  He wants to speak with you.

AMANDA

(doesn't even glance over)

I'm gonna see him later.

JANE

(back to Talley)

She has to go to the bathroom.

JANE (CONT'D)

You're not only punishing yourself, Jeff.

Amanda and I are in this, too.

TALLEY

Can we talk some more when you get here?

JANE

We'll see you in a couple of hours.

AMANDA

I don't wanna go up there.  I want to

stay here with my friends.

JANE

Pack your things.  You're going.

LOUISE

Mike's been shot!  Someone shot Junior

Kim, too --

TALLEY

What are you talking about, shot?  What

happened?

LOUISE

Three white males shot Junior.  Mike

followed them to York Estates --

TALLEY

Where are they?

LOUISE

York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way.

Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

TALLEY

Sonofabitch.

ANDERS

Welch is down!  They shot him!

JORGENSON

We think it's the three guys who robbed

Kim's.

TALLEY

Are civilians inside?

JORGENSON

He said something about a girl --

TALLEY

Holster your guns!

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(calling)

Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?

ANDERS

I think he's dead!

TALLEY

Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

We have to cordon off the streets, then

evacuate these houses.

JORGENSON

What are we going to do about Mike?

TALLEY

Keep your head down.

TALLEY

How you doing, buddy?  You still alive?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Jesus.  You hang on.

TALLEY

He's in the backseat!

TALLEY (CONT'D)

This is Talley.  Who's on?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

One at a time!  Clear the air!

(as they settle)

Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?

LOUISE'S VOICE

Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.

COP VOICES

What about Mike?  Is Welch alive?  What

happened?

TALLEY

(forcefully)

Quiet!  I want radio discipline.

(as they quiet)

Mike's hanging in.  Larry, Jorgy?  Listen

up.

JORGENSON'S VOICE

Go, Chief.

TALLEY

Find out who lives at four-five-five.  We

gotta know who's in there.

LOUISE'S VOICE

Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered

the door.

TALLEY

Did he say if she was shooting at him?

LOUISE'S VOICE

(hesitant)

He didn't say.

TALLEY

Then we don't know if she's part of this

or not.  Mickey, you up?

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.

TALLEY

Mike found a red pickup abandoned on

Flanders.  You see it?

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

It's right in front of us.

TALLEY

Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's

name.

LOUISE'S VOICE

I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the

minimart.

TALLEY

Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a

crime scene like that.  Put a unit out

there.

LOUISE'S VOICE

We only have eight officers on duty,

Chief.

TALLEY

(to himself)

That's not enough.

LOUISE

What's that, Chief?  Say again.

TALLEY

Get everyone out here.  Then call the

Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible

hostage situation.

KEVIN

We could've gone out the back!  You

didn't have to shoot!

DENNIS

Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev!

They're already behind us!

KEVIN

We should give up.  All we're doing is

making it worse.

JENNIFER

Get out of our house!

WALTER

(softly)

Quiet, Jen.

JENNIFER

Why don't they go?!  Why don't they leave

us alone and go?!

DENNIS

Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!

WALTER

None of you will get out of this.

DENNIS

Stay down!  Stay down, goddamnit!

WALTER

I'm going to my desk.

DENNIS

You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the

fuckin' floor!

JENNIFER

Daddy, don't!

WALTER

(casually; to Dennis)

Take it easy, son.  I'm only going to my

desk.

DENNIS

Get on the floor!

WALTER

I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers

and judges who can help you.

DENNIS

I'll fuckin' kill you!

JENNIFER AND THOMAS

Daddy!  Please!

WALTER

This is every criminal lawyer in

California.  If you give up now, right

now, I'll buy you the best lawyer in the

state.

DENNIS

We just killed a cop!  We killed a fat

chinaman!  We'll get the death penalty!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the

back of the house!

WALTER

You won't die if you let me help.

DENNIS

Bullshit!

WALTER

But if you stay in this house, I can

promise you this --

DENNIS

(shouting over him)

Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor!

WALTER

You can't imagine the fucking you're

going to get.

JENNIFER

Leave him alone!!

ANDERS

(referring to notes)

The house belongs to Walter and Pamela

Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl

about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer

and Thomas.

TALLEY

That would be the girl who opened the

door.  Are the others inside?

ANDERS

The mother is in Florida visiting her

sister.  The father works at home, so

he's probably inside.

TALLEY

(into his mike)

Louise?

LOUISE'S VOICE

Go, Chief.

TALLEY

Get a phone number for the Smiths.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

(from the radio)

Chief, Mikkelson.

TALLEY

Go, Mickey.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

The truck is registered to Dennis James

Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has

an Agua Dulce address.

TALLEY

Contact the landlord.  I want to know

employment, friends, family, anything we

can find out about this guy.

CAMPBELL

What in hell is that?

TALLEY

(grimly)

News hawks.  There'll be more.  They

monitor our frequencies.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Everyone be cool.  That's our job right

now--stabilize the situation and don't

let things get out of hand.  All we have

to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take

over.  That's all we have to do.

METZGER

How do we do that?

TALLEY

That's my job, Metzger.  That's why I get

the big bucks.

JENNIFER

He's not waking up.  He should be awake.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

He needs a doctor.

DENNIS

Shut up and sit down.  You think

someone's gonna make a house call?

JENNIFER

At least let me get some ice for his

head.

DENNIS

Make sure Kevin isn't fucking off back

there.

MARS

I thought you wanted ice.

JENNIFER

I'm getting a wash cloth for the ice.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Please get away from me.

KEVIN

(from the background)

Mars?  What are you doing?

MARS

Hey.

MARS (CONT'D)

Want one?

JENNIFER

I don't drink beer.

MARS

Mommy won't know.  You can do anything

you want right now.  Mommy won't know.

JENNIFER

What I want is to help my father.

DENNIS

Hello?

TALLEY

(into his phone)

My name is Jeff Talley.  Is this Dennis

Rooney?

DENNIS

You with the cops?

TALLEY

The Bristo Police Department.  Look out

the window.  You see the car?

DENNIS

Yeah.  I'm Rooney.

TALLEY

We had an awful lot of shooting.  You

need a doctor in there?

DENNIS

We're cool.

TALLEY

Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to

hear it from him.

DENNIS

Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You

talk to me.

TALLEY

How about your two friends?  You don't

have a man dying in there, do you?

DENNIS

They're fine.

TALLEY

All three subjects are confirmed inside.

Call off the house-to-house.

(back to the phone)

Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your

situation --

DENNIS

(interrupting)

You don't have to explain shit!  That

Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for

it.  That Chinaman shot himself.

TALLEY

Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.

DENNIS

How about the cop?

TALLEY

Dennis?  I want you to release those

people.

DENNIS

Fuck that.  They're the only thing

stopping you from blowing us away.

TALLEY

We're not coming in there by force, okay?

No one wants to hurt you.

DENNIS

I got these people!  You try to come get

me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!

DENNIS

That fuckin' Chinaman is dead!  That's

murder-one, dude.  That's the needle!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Get back where you belong, asshole!

Mars, keep and eye on the cops; I gotta

find a way out of here --

KEVIN

I have to tell you something --

DENNIS

We gotta find a way outta here is what we

gotta do!

KEVIN

It's about Mars --

KEVIN (CONT'D)

That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied.

He just started shooting!

DENNIS

Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?

KEVIN

I was there, Dennis!  I saw!  It's like

he wanted to shoot that cop.

DENNIS

You're being stupid.  Check out the

bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a

window --

DENNIS

Kev.

KEVIN

Jesus.  What is this?

DENNIS

Are you totally stupid?  What does it

look like?

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Look, that's the master bedroom out here.

KEVIN

I can see you!

DENNIS

Dude, this is solid steel.  They gotta be

hiding something.

KEVIN

Dennis --

DENNIS

Go get Mars.

MIKKELSON

One in front is Dennis James Rooney.

MIKKELSON (CONT'D)

Dennis has a younger brother, Kevin Paul--

that's him entering now, the third guy.

TALLEY

Has Dennis done time?

MIKKELSON

Just pulled thirty days for misdemeanor

burglary.  He shows car theft,

shoplifting, and DUI.

TALLEY

Who's this?

DREYER

We don't know.

TALLEY

Have still prints made from the tape.

Show the landlord.  Maybe we can get a

fast ID.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Here on his head.  Is that a tattoo?

MIKKELSON

I can't make it out.

TALLEY

Says...burn it.

DREYER

What's he doing?

TALLEY

He's watching Kim die.

METZGER

Chief?

AMANDA

Are men with guns really barricaded in a

house?

TALLEY

Just around the corner and up that

street.  See the helicopters?

JANE

Wait by the car, Mandy.  Give me a minute

with Dad.

TALLEY

(apologizing)

I should've called.  This thing broke

right after we spoke, then everything

happened so fast --

JANE

Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?

TALLEY

The Sheriffs will take over when they get

here.

JANE

But they're not here yet.  Tell me about

you.

JANE (CONT'D)

Jesus, you're shaking.

TALLEY

Why don't you guys grab some dinner at

the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as

soon as I can.

JANE

You sure?

TALLEY

I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.

JANE

I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.

TALLEY

Jane?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

I'm scared shitless.

JANE

That's okay.  I love you anyway.

HOWELL

Hey, you guys know what's going on?

REPORTER

Three men took a family hostage.

HOWELL

Jesus, no shit?  My client lives in

there.

REPORTER

It's a family named Smith, Walter and

Pamela Smith.  Do you know them?

HOWELL

No.  No, I don't know them.  Thanks for

your time.

HOWELL (CONT'D)

(into his phone)

We have a problem out here.

TUZEE

Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The

detectives come out with Smith's

computer, and we go directly to jail, do

not pass Go.

BENZA

Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

TUZEE

I took the call from Glen personally.

They're still in Smith's house.

FISCHER

Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's

three kids.  They'll give up, the cops

will arrest them, and that's that.  Why

would they search the house?

BENZA

You think we should take that chance?

FISCHER

(on the spot)

I guess not.

BENZA

I guess not, too.  How much information

is in the house?

TUZEE

Smith was cooking the books for the IRS.

That means he has it all:  The cash flow,

where it comes from, how we launder it,

our split with the East.

FISCHER

It's on two computer disks he calls

Marlon and Al.

BENZA

What, he's cute?  That's his idea of

humor?

FISCHER

If the Feds get those disks, the East

Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You

should let them know.

BENZA

No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is

gonna handle this from back there.

TUZEE

You should warn them, Sonny.

BENZA

Fuck them!  Now get your head in the

game, Phil--we have to handle this.

BENZA (CONT'D)

Put our people on the scene.  Smith might

talk just to cut a break for his kids.

TUZEE

He knows better than that.

BENZA

Bullshit--a man will do anything to save

his family.  Who's running the show up

there?

FISCHER

They have a chief of police, a guy named

Talley.  I saw him being interviewed.

FISCHER

(pointing)

Hey, that's him.  That's Talley right

there!

BENZA

Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end

of the day, I want to own him.

TUZEE

It's happening right now.

SEYMORE

L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a

bank robbery in Pico Rivera.

HOWELL

Give me an ETA.

SEYMORE

An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.

MANELLI

When the Sheriffs get here, how many we

looking at?

SEYMORE

(checking his notes)

A command team, a negotiating team, a

tactical team--the tac team includes a

perimeter team, the assault team,

snipers, and breachers--thirty-five new

bodies.

HOWELL

How many locals?

DEVARONA

Fourteen officers and two civilians.  I

have their names and most of their

addresses.

HOWELL

And Talley?

DEVARONA

Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam

doesn't live here, but they're coming up

today.  I got his address there.

MANELLI

The cops I talked to, they said Talley

was a hostage negotiator in LA.

DEVARONA

His last three years on the job.  Before

that, he was SWAT.

RUIZ

How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here

to this shithole?

DEVARONA

I make him for a stress release.

HOWELL

Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay

ahead of the curve.  I want to know

everything that happens before it

happens.  I'll cover Talley.

SEYMORE

What if it goes south?

HOWELL

What do you mean?

SEYMORE

If things get wet, we're going to need

someone who can handle that end.

HOWELL

You worry about your end.  I got my side

covered.

HOWELL

Talley lives here.  I don't know if the

place has security or not.

MARION

It won't be a problem.

HOWELL

He has a wife and kid.  That's how

we'll get to him.

MARION

Okey-doke.

HOWELL

We have to own this guy, Marion.  We

don't want him dead; we need to use him.

MARION

Can we make him dead after we use him?

HOWELL

Whatever you want.  Page me when you're

done.

HOWELL (CONT'D)

Donuts here any good?

MARION

I don't eat junk food.

METZGER

PacBell shows six lines into the house.

They blocked all six like you wanted.

TALLEY

I have the only number that can call into

the house?

METZGER

Yes, sir.  They'll only accept calls from

your cell.

TALLEY

Way to go.

ANDERS

Chief, this is Brad Dill.  Dennis and

Kevin work for him.

DILL

I didn't know anything about this.  I

didn't know what they were gonna do.

TALLEY

Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what

they were going to do until they did it.

I want you to take a look at something.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Can you identify this man?

DILL

That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he

works for me, too.

TALLEY

(to Metzger)

Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek'

through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list

the tattoo as an identifier.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot-

tempered?  Anything like that?

DILL

Keeps to himself, more like.

TALLEY

You have his address?

DILL

Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --

TALLEY

(to Anders)

Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a

telephonic search warrant.  When you get

the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer

search his house.

ANDERS

Yes, sir.

METZGER

Chief!  The Sheriffs are ten minutes out!

TALLEY

(into his radio)

Louise?

LOUISE'S VOICE

Go, Chief.

TALLEY

Call Jane for me.  She's at the little

Thai place.

LOUISE'S VOICE

I know the one.

TALLEY

Tell her I'm almost home.

DENNIS

There's gotta be a million bucks here.

Maybe two million!

MARS

It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks

into your house, you can hide.

DENNIS

Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the

cash!  We're rich.

MARS

We're trapped in a house.

DENNIS

We can take it with us.

MARS

You can't run with suitcases.

DENNIS

Then we'll stuff it up our asses.  This

is the payoff.  This is every dream you

ever had, all in those two bags.

ANCHOR

(from the tube)

-- thought to be Dennis James Rooney.

Rooney was recently released from the

Antelope Valley Correctional Institute

where he served time for robbery.

DENNIS

(thrilled)

Check me out!  I look like fuckin' Jon

Bon Jovi.

KEVIN

Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis.

We won't be able to hide.

DENNIS

Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need

anti-depressants.

JENNIFER

My father needs a doctor.  Please.

DENNIS

Hey, I've got a situation here, in case

you haven't noticed.

JENNIFER

All you're doing is watching yourself on

TV.  Look at him.

DENNIS

Use more ice.

JENNIFER

I'm getting a doctor!

THOMAS

Jen!!!

KEVIN

Stop it!  Stop it, Dennis!  Jesus!

MARS

(quietly)

We should tie them.  We can put them

upstairs out of the way.

DENNIS

That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.

MARS

(to Kevin)

Find something:  Extension cords, rope,

wire--we'll have to tie them tight.

DENNIS

Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand

there.

(waves at Walter)

And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want

him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.

MARS

Tie her to the chair.  I'll take care of

the windows when I finish with the boy.

KEVIN

Here.  Put this on.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

You gotta pee?

JENNIFER

I don't see why you can't just lock me

in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.

KEVIN

Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will

tie you.  Which do you want?

JENNIFER

Thanks for the shirt.

KEVIN

Whatever.

JENNIFER

Kevin, my father needs a doctor.

KEVIN

He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked

out.

JENNIFER

If my father dies they'll charge you with

his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see

that?

KEVIN

I can't make Dennis see anything.

MARS

Look what I found.

MARS (CONT'D)

You tied her like a pussy.  Make it

tight.

MARS (CONT'D)

Better.

KEVIN

Make sure she can breathe.

MARS

Go downstairs, Kevin.

MARS (CONT'D)

I want to show you something.

MARS (CONT'D)

It cost two hundred forty dollars, but I

was happy to spend it.  I love my mom.

You see these?

MARS (CONT'D)

My mom burned me with cigarettes.

THOMAS

(whispers)

Jen!

THOMAS

Sit still!  If they're in the security

room, they can see you on the monitors.

THOMAS (CONT'D)

I figured out what these cameras can see

last year when Mom and Dad went to Lake

Arrowhead.  It can't see me over here,

but it's looking at you, so don't move!

JENNIFER

Ow!  Shit!

THOMAS

Be quiet!  Listen!

JENNIFER

No one's coming.

THOMAS

That big asshole nailed my windows.

JENNIFER

Mine, too.

THOMAS

We can use the crawlspace to get

downstairs.  Then we can run for it.

JENNIFER

No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with

them!

THOMAS

We can't carry him.

JENNIFER

You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll

stay with Daddy.

THOMAS

I'm not gonna leave you!

JENNIFER

Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help

the police!

THOMAS

We'll all go, Jennifer.  All of us or

none of us.  I know where Daddy keeps a

gun.

JENNIFER

(loud)

You leave that gun alone!

THOMAS

Shh, they'll hear you!

JENNIFER

(louder)

Better than you getting killed!  Don't

touch that gun!  Daddy says --

TALLEY

I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?

MARTIN

Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the

primary negotiator --

MADDOX

Is the perimeter around the house secure?

TALLEY

I've got fourteen officers on my

department including me.  We're as secure

as we can be.

MADDOX

(to Martin)

Permission to deploy the line?

MARTIN

Do it.

TALLEY

(to Maddox)

Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid

named Rooney.  He's amped up and

volatile.

MARTIN

Sounds like you know the job.

TALLEY

I've done it once or twice.  I blocked

their phones to incoming calls, so you'll

have to cut in a hard line to talk to

him.

MARTIN

(over her shoulder)

Maddox!  You got that?

MADDOX

Doing it now!

MARTIN

(back to Talley)

I'd like you to brief my supervisors

before we take over the scene.

TALLEY

Whatever you want.

KEVIN

Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What

if he wakes up?

DENNIS

(annoyed)

That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now

come here and see this --

DENNIS (CONT'D)

(excited)

These bushes follow the wall into the

neighbor's yard.  All we need is some

kind of diversion and we're home free.

KEVIN

That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see

us.

DENNIS

Not if they're looking at something else.

KEVIN

Like what?

MARS

Let's burn the house.

KEVIN

We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.

DENNIS

I've been carrying you our whole fuckin'

lives.

KEVIN

Everything we're doing is making it

worse.  You can't let him burn this

house.

DENNIS

Nothing's worse than listening to you.

I'm warning you, Kevin--stop holding me

back.  Now you pick up that fuckin' money

and get ready to go.

DENNIS

They're coming!  Kev, Mars, they're

coming!!!

DENNIS

The cops are comin'!

MARS

I got the gasoline --

DENNIS

We don't have time!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Get the kids!  They're our only chance!

TALLEY

(startled)

Who's that shooting?  Martin, what's

going on?

RADIO VOICES

Shots fired!  We are taking fire on the

back wall!

TALLEY

They're too close!  I told you not to

crowd him!  Pull back your people; do not

breach that house!

TALLEY

(to the deputy)

This thing good?

MADDOX

What in hell are you doing?  He's

shooting at my men!

TALLEY

(to Maddox)

Then get your men off the wall!

(to Martin)

You breach that house, we're gonna have a

bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain --

I can talk to him.

MARTIN

(to Maddox)

Order your men to stand down.

TALLEY

(over the p.a.)

Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT

entering the house.  We're pulling back.

DENNIS

(screaming into the phone)

You fuck!  I got a fuckin' gun to this

kid's head!  I'll kill'm, you fuck!

TALLEY

It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt

anyone.

DENNIS

(still screaming)

We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I

got gasoline all over in here!

TALLEY

No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out

here got carried away.

DENNIS

Goddamned right they got carried away.

It looks like an army out there.

TALLEY

(to Martin)

It's over.  He's cooling off.

DENNIS

Talley?

TALLEY

(back into the phone)

I'm here.

DENNIS

I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.

TALLEY

That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They

won't give you a helicopter.

DENNIS

I'll give you these people.

TALLEY

The Mexican police would arrest you as

soon as it landed.  There's only one way

out and you're doing it right now--just

keep talking to us.

(mutes phone; to Martin and

Maddox)

I think we could make the transition now.

Maddox, you good to go?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(to Dennis)

Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a

personal secret?

DENNIS

(hesitantly)

What?

TALLEY

I gotta piss real bad.

DENNIS

You're a funny guy, Talley.

TALLEY

I'm going to put on an officer named Will

Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

He says he has gasoline set to burn the

place.

MARTIN

Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the

cars.

TALLEY

If you go in, you can't use tear gas or

flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

MARTIN

(not without humor)

Looks like you're bailing out at the

right time.

TALLEY

(returns her smile)

That's why you get the big bucks,

Captain.

LOUISE'S VOICE

Chief, base.

TALLEY

(keying his shoulder mike)

Go.

LOUISE'S VOICE

I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the

restaurant.

TALLEY

You have her cell number?

LOUISE'S VOICE

She didn't answer.

TALLEY

They might be at the house.  Keep trying

and let me know.  I'm going to be here a

little while longer.

KEVIN

We're surrounded.  They're all over the

neighborhood.

DENNIS

What the fuck is that?

MARS

They'll cut the power.

JENNIFER

What about my father?

DENNIS

Aw, Jesus, not more of this.

JENNIFER

Look at him!  I think he's dying!

DENNIS

(to Kevin and Mars)

Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm

like before.  That little fuck untied

himself anyway.

LOUISE'S VOICE

Chief, base.

TALLEY

Did you find Jane and Mandy?

LOUISE'S VOICE

Could you call me back on your phone?

Right away.

TALLEY

What's wrong with the radio?

LOUISE'S VOICE

(hesitantly)

Other people can hear us.  Just call.

Please.

TALLEY

Stand by.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Is something wrong with Jane?

LOUISE

We have a boy on the line.  He says he's

Thomas Smith and he's calling from the

house.

TALLEY

It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste

my time with that!

LOUISE

His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I

think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy

is inside that house.

TALLEY

Put him on.

TALLEY

(to Metzger)

Get Martin.  Right away.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(into the phone)

This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name,

son.

THOMAS

Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on

TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't

wake up.  You gotta help him.

TALLEY

Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk

to me.  Was your father shot?

THOMAS

Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and

he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.

TALLEY

How about you and your sister?

THOMAS

We're okay.

TALLEY

Where are you right now?

THOMAS

In my room.

TALLEY

That's on the second floor.  Could you

climb out your window if we were

downstairs to catch you?

THOMAS

They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm

open.

TALLEY

(to Martin)

I've got the boy on the phone.  He's

using a cell phone.

(back to Thomas)

What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.

THOMAS

If I try to climb out they'll see me on

the security cameras.  They would see you

outside, too --

THOMAS (CONT'D)

They're coming!

TALLEY

Thomas?  Thomas...?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

He says that his father's hurt.

MARTIN

If we have a man dying in there, we'll

have to go in.

TALLEY

They have security cameras.  Rooney would

see you coming.

MARTIN

Did the boy say that any of them are in

immediate danger?

TALLEY

No.  He said that his father's

unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

MARTIN

Then I think we should wait.  Do you

agree?

TALLEY

You want me to stick around, I could --

MARTIN

You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a

break.  See your family.  If I need you,

I'll call.

TALLEY'S VOICE MESSAGE

This is Jeff Talley.  Leave your name and

number after the beep.

TALLEY

(into his phone)

Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay?

Mandy?

SEYMORE

(into his phone)

He's leaving now.

THE WATCHMAN

(meaning the gun)

Do you see the fuckin' gun?!  Look at it!

TALLEY

Take it easy.

THE WATCHMAN

Where's your gun?

TALLEY

I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Who are you?

THE WATCHMAN

Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

THE WATCHMAN

I know you're scared, but unless you do

something stupid we're not going to hurt

you.  You understand?

THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)

Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass.

Do you understand?

TALLEY

What do you want?

THE WATCHMAN

These guys are going to take hold of you.

Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.

TALLEY

What is this?

THE WATCHMAN

Say hello.

JANE'S VOICE

Jeff?  Is that you?

THE WATCHMAN

(trying to calm Talley)

I know, I know--she's all right.  Your

kid's all right, too.  C'mon, now, relax.

From this point on, you control what

happens to them.

THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)

Can we let go?  You past your shock and

all that, we can turn you loose and you

won't do something stupid?

TALLEY

You can let go.

THE WATCHMAN

Here's the deal--Walter Smith has two

computer disks like this in his house.

They're labeled 'Marlon' and 'Al.'

TALLEY

Marlon and Al....

THE WATCHMAN

We want them.  You will not let anyone go

into that house--or anything come out--

until my people recover these disks.

TALLEY

I can't control what happens.  The

Sheriffs are running the scene.

THE WATCHMAN

You will re-assume command.  In two

hours, a group of my people will arrive

at York Estates.  You will tell the

Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical

team.

THE WATCHMAN (CONT'D)

When this phone rings, you answer.  It

will be me.  I'll tell you what to do.

When I have what I want, you get your

family.

TALLEY

You want . . . Marlon and Al.

THE WATCHMAN

I have people in York Estates right under

your nose.  If you do anything except

what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and

Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on

that?

TALLEY

These disks . . . where are they?

THE WATCHMAN

Smith will know.

THE WATCHMAN

When it rings, answer.

LOUISE

You look terrible.  Chief, are you all

right?

TALLEY

I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet

me at the front gate.

ANDERS

What's up, Chief?

ANDERS (CONT'D)

Did I do something wrong?

TALLEY

I want you to run this license plate and

phone number.  Then I want you to find

out everything you can about Walter

Smith.

ANDERS

The guy in the house?

TALLEY

Go back to the office.  Run his name

through the FBI and the NLETS database.

I think he's involved with illegal activity

or he associates with people who are.

ANDERS

Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.

TALLEY

Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not

Louise, not the other guys, not the

Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?

ANDERS

I guess so.

TALLEY

Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.

ANDERS

I will, Chief.  Absolutely.

TALLEY

Get to work.

TALLEY

I'm re-assuming command of the scene.

MARTIN

Excuse me?  You requested our help.  You

turned over command --

TALLEY

And now I'm taking it back.  We're

getting Smith out of the house.

JENNIFER

Thomas?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Thomas, is that you?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

What do you want?

MARS

We can't make the microwave work.

JENNIFER

What?

MARS

We're hungry.  You're going to cook.

MARS

Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs

and hot dogs on mine.

JENNIFER

(under her breath)

How about dog shit?

MARS

With hot sauce and butter.

JENNIFER

I need a frying pan.  Would you get one?

Over there, under the range.

MADDOX

What put a wild hair up your ass?

TALLEY

I changed my mind.  That's all you need

to know.

DENNIS

That you, Talley?

TALLEY

The one and only.  We got a little

problem out here, Dennis.

DENNIS

You oughta try on the problem I got in

here.

TALLEY

I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.

DENNIS

We been through that.  Forget it.

TALLEY

We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think

you won't let me talk to Smith because

he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

MADDOX

(low, so that Dennis can't

hear)

What in hell are you doing?!

DENNIS

That's bullshit!  The guy's right here!

He's alive!

TALLEY

(pressing Dennis harder)

If you don't let me talk to him, they're

going to attack the house.

MADDOX

You're gonna set him off, goddamnit!

That's crazy!

DENNIS

(screaming)

They better not!

TALLEY

Help me keep them out!  Let me speak to

Smith, Dennis.  Let me speak to him right

now.

DENNIS

SHIT!!!!

TALLEY

(calmer; coaxing)

Talk to me, Dennis.  Help me help you.

Why can't you put Smith on the phone?

DENNIS

(quietly)

He got knocked out.  It's like he's

sleeping.  He just lays there.

TALLEY

(to Dennis)

Now I understand.  That helps.  I can

make them understand that.

DENNIS

Okay.

TALLEY

Let me come get him.

DENNIS

Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!

TALLEY

If you won't let me come in, then put him

outside.

DENNIS

You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out

the door!

TALLEY

You've already helped yourself once,

Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his

life, it'll help when you get to court.

DENNIS

Fuck you, Talley, fuck you!  You and one

other guy, but that's it!  I want you

stripped!  I gotta know you don't have

guns!

TALLEY

Bring up the ambulance.

TALLEY

(into the phone)

Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house

until you've closed the door.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(over his shoulder)

Easy....

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(to Bigelow)

Let's do it.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

How's he look?

BIGELOW

He's got a concussion for sure.  I'm

going to brace him.

BIGELOW (CONT'D)

Let's get him on the stretcher.

BIGELOW (CONT'D)

I'll support his head and shoulders.  You

lift his hips and knees.  On three.

Three.

MADDOX

You ready to tell me what's going on?

TALLEY

No.

TALLEY

I'm the chief of police here.  I have to

talk to him.

KLAUS

Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal

pupilation.  He could have an

intracranial hematoma or a fracture or

both.

TALLEY

Smith!  Wake up!

KLAUS

What are you doing?!  Stop that!

TALLEY

(to Smith)

Wake up, goddamnit.  Who are you?

KLAUS

This man needs a hospital!  Stop it!

TALLEY

Use smelling salts, give him a shot,

whatever.  I just need a minute.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Stop the fuckin' engine!

KLAUS

I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even

know that I can.

TALLEY

Just one question.  Please.

KLAUS

He.  Can't.  Answer.

TALLEY

I want you waiting in Smith's lap.  I

want to know the second--and I mean the

second--that he wakes up.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Talley.

ANDERS' VOICE

It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?

TALLEY

(into his phone)

What'd you find out?

ANDERS' VOICE

The cell phone is registered to a jewelry

store in Beverly Hills.  The phone

company shows no unusual --

TALLEY

(cutting him off)

Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the

Mustang?

ANDERS' VOICE

It was stolen.

TALLEY

You get anything on Smith?

ANDERS' VOICE

Chief...it's like none of this exists.

I'm sorry.

TALLEY

Keep trying.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(through the p.a.)

Call me.  If you're safe, call me.

DENNIS

I'll be safe when I'm outta here, you

asshole!  I'm not talking any more!

HOWELL

Was Smith talking?

SEYMORE

I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking

him to the hospital.

HOWELL

Goddamnit, tell me what you know.  Did

the cops go in?  Did Smith have the

disks?

SEYMORE

I don't know.  Talley talked those punks

into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us

over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.

HOWELL

What hospital?

SEYMORE

Canyon Country.

HOWELL

I have another job for you.

TALLEY

Put him on.

THOMAS

Is my daddy okay?

TALLEY

The doctors are taking care of him right

now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you

talk?

THOMAS

I think so.

TALLEY

I need your help with something.  But if

you think those guys could catch you,

then I don't want you to do it, okay?

THOMAS

Okay.

TALLEY

I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to

get hurt.

THOMAS

What do you want me to do?

TALLEY

Your dad has two computer disks.  They

have funny names:  Marlon and Al.

THOMAS

He has lots of disks.

TALLEY

I think he was working on them today, so

they're probably in his office.  Could

you find them and see who they belong to?

THOMAS

Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He

makes me sit on the floor.

THOMAS (CONT'D)

But I might be able to sneak into the

office if they're not around.  Then I

could open the disks here in my room.

TALLEY

I thought they locked you in your room.

THOMAS

I can get into the crawlspace from my

closet and climb all over the house.

TALLEY

Can you get into the office?

THOMAS

I can get into the den.  The office is

right across the hall.

TALLEY

If I get Rooney into the back of the

house, can you find the disks without

being caught?

THOMAS

Yes, sir.

MARTIN

I want to know what in hell you're doing.

TALLEY

I'm looking for you.  I need your

tactical unit.

MARTIN

I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of

here fast enough, then you take back

command; you agree to wait on Smith, then

you risk everything in a stupid stunt to

get him out --

TALLEY

(interrupting)

Don't question me, Captain!  This is my

crime scene!

MARTIN

(shouting over him)

-- then when you get him, you damn near

assault the man in the ambulance!  What

is going on?

TALLEY

(simply)

I'm a negotiator, Captain.  I negotiate.

That's all you need to know.  Now are you

going to help me or not?

MARTIN

Maddox!  Let's give the man a hand!

DENNIS

(to an imaginary bartender)

Keep the change, m'man.

KEVIN

We're fucked.

DENNIS

We're fucked until we think of a way out;

then we're rich.

KEVIN

There is no way out.

DENNIS

For chrissake, please!  Help me

celebrate!  I figured it out!

KEVIN

Celebrate what?  Going to prison?

DENNIS

No, dumbass--Talley.  Talley's the guy

who keeps us in here, and Talley's the

guy who can let us out.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Cops want to be rich like everyone else.

All we have to do is share.

(leans closer and lowers his

voice)

And if he wants someone to swing for the

Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

MARS

Dennis.

MARS (CONT'D)

The food's ready.

THOMAS

(whispers into the phone)

It's me, Chief.  I'm in the den.

TALLEY

(into his phone)

Okay, bud, here we go.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(into his mike)

Captain?  Kill the lights.

DENNIS

Shit!  It's the cops!

TALLEY'S VOICE

It's time to talk face-to-face, Dennis.

Come out, just you, and we'll talk.

KEVIN

What's he doing?  What's going on?!

DENNIS

Mars!  They're trying to blindside us!

Check the front!

DENNIS'S VOICE

What's going on out front?

DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Mars?!  What the fuck are they doin'?

DENNIS'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Mars!  Something's happening!  Get back

here!

TALLEY

Come on, Dennis.  Talk to me.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

I'm unarmed.  I'm looking at you.  Get

out here and let's talk.

DENNIS

You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot

me?

TALLEY

Only if you try to grab me.  We could've

shot you from the wall.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

You've been in there a long time.

What're you waiting for?

DENNIS

Would you be in a hurry to go to prison

for the rest of your life?

TALLEY

I'd be trying to get the best deal that I

could.

DENNIS

Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach

in my pocket, show you something?

DENNIS (CONT'D)

That's fifty hundred-dollar bills.  Five

grand.  They got money in this house,

Talley, more than you've ever seen.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

How much would it be worth to you,

getting me out of here?

TALLEY

You picked a bad house to hole up in,

son.

DENNIS

Two hundred thousand cash, right in your

pocket, no one needs to know.

TALLEY

Give up.

DENNIS

There's a million dollars in there, maybe

two million.  I'll give you half.

TALLEY

The man you sent to the hospital is a

criminal.  He has partners.  This is

their house and their money and they want

it back.

DENNIS

It ain't been a good day, Chief.

TALLEY

Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go.

At least you'll have your life.

THOMAS

I got'm!

TALLEY

Can you open them?

THOMAS

I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's

taxes.

TALLEY

Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes

they are?

THOMAS

I don't see any people names.  It's all

businesses.

TALLEY

Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

THOMAS

Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's

personal tax --

TALLEY

Who is it?

THOMAS

Charles G. Benza.

(then; noise in the hall)

They're coming!

TALLEY

Sonny Benza.  Oh, fuck.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

(into the mike)

Leigh?  Metzger, answer me!

METZGER'S VOICE

I'm at the hospital.

TALLEY

Put a guard on Smith!  I want you with

Smith until I get there!

JORGENSON

What's going on?

TALLEY

Get in the car.  Now.

MARION

(into his phone)

We're too late.  The police are here.

TALLEY

I'm posting a guard outside his room, but

we'll need help from hospital security.

REESE

Is my staff in danger?

TALLEY

Not with my officers here, no, ma'am.

METZGER

Hey!  He's waking up!

WALTER

Where am I?

KLAUS

Canyon Country Hospital.  Do you remember

your name?

WALTER

Walter Smith.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Where are my children?

TALLEY

They're still in the house.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of

police.  So far as we know, your children

are okay.

KLAUS

Chief Talley is the one who got you out.

TALLEY

(to Klaus)

I need to talk to him.  Alone.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter.  He

wants the disks, Marlon and Al.  He took

my family to make me help.

WALTER

I don't know what you're talking about.

TALLEY

He's going to kill you.  Don't you know

that?  He can't take the chance that

you'll talk.

KLAUS

That's enough.

TALLEY

Another minute.  Please --

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad!

TALLEY

Do you think I'm going to let you murder

someone?!

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

You want a blowtorch on your daughter's

pretty face?!

TALLEY

I'll go in that fuckin' house right now!

I'll give those disks to the real FBI,

you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've

got Smith!  I've got Smith!!

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

I guess we each have something the other

wants.

TALLEY

I guess we do.

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

My people are good to go.  You know who I

mean?

TALLEY

Your phony FBI assholes.

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your

shit together.  This isn't L.A.

TALLEY

What do you mean by that?

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE

You don't want another dead child on your

conscience.

DENNIS

I shouldn't have told him about the

money.  Now Talley is gonna keep it for

himself.

KEVIN

He said that?

DENNIS

If we don't escape, we gotta get the word

out about the cash.  That's how we'll

stay alive.

KEVIN

What are you talking about?

DENNIS

The only way he can keep the cash is if

nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap

all three of us before they even read our

rights.  He's probably planning it right

now.

KEVIN

That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.

DENNIS

Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...

KEVIN

It's over.  We have to give up.

DENNIS

Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.

KEVIN

That money's fucked up your brain.

Talley's going to get tired of waiting

for us to give up, and we'll all be

fuckin' killed!

DENNIS

Then we might as well die rich.

KEVIN

I'm not going to die for this!

DENNIS

You're my fuckin' anchor, Kevin, the

fuckin' lead around my life that I've

been draggin' like a cripple leg!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Get this into your stupid head, Kevin.

We're not leaving without the money.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

You got something to say?

MARS

I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going

to leave.

DENNIS

Fuckin' A.

JENNIFER

What do you want?

KEVIN

Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and

your brother out of here.

JENNIFER

What happened?

KEVIN

Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering

you a way out of here.

JENNIFER

I can't go without Thomas.

KEVIN

All three of us will go, but we have to

move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know

I'm doing this.

JENNIFER

How can we get out?

KEVIN

Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get

your brother, then come back for you.

We'll go down the stairs and out the

front door, you understand?

JENNIFER

Yes.

KEVIN

Put on some shoes.

KEVIN

You scared the shit out of me.  I was

looking for you.  Dennis wants you to

watch the monitors.

MARS

I heard you with the girl.

KEVIN

It's over, Mars.  If we stay the cops

will kill us.  Don't you get that?

MARS

I get it.  If you want to go, go.

COOPER

Come FBI guys showed up, Chief.  They

said you were expecting them.

TALLEY

They here now?

COOPER

You'll see'm up the street.

THE DRIVER

You Talley?

TALLEY

Yeah.

MR. JONES

Let me see some ID.  Something with a

picture.  I don't give a shit about your

badge.

MR. JONES (CONT'D)

Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special

Agent Jones.

TALLEY

Are all of you named Jones?

MR. JONES

Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford

it.

MR. JONES (CONT'D)

In a few minutes the white phone is going

to ring.  So let's get our shit straight

before that happens.

TALLEY

You used to be a cop.  All of you used to

be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.

MR. JONES

Don't worry about what we used to be.

TALLEY

How do you people expect this to work?

The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team

here.

MR. JONES

What's my name?

TALLEY

What?

MR. JONES

I asked you my name.  You just saw my

commission slip.  What's my fucking name?

TALLEY

Special Agent Jones.

MR. JONES

Think of me that way and you won't fuck

up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.

TALLEY

What are you people going to do?

MR. JONES

You and I are gonna straighten this out

with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait

for the man to call.  When he gives the

word, we move.

TALLEY

What does he have on you?  I know why I'm

doing this, but what does he have on you?

MR. JONES

Let's go, Chief.  Time to get real.

DREYER

Krupchek lives in a shithole.

MIKKELSON

I guess we could jimmy it.

DREYER

I don't want to pay for breaking it.

MIKKELSON

Christ, that stinks.

DREYER

Mickey?  Look at this shit.

DREYER (CONT'D)

He's burned them.

MIKKELSON

What?

DREYER

He burned their noses.

MIKKELSON

Okay, this is creeping me out.

DREYER

What are those, rats?

MIKKELSON

Ohmigod.  We gotta call Talley.

MR. JONES

Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness

Protection program.  When Washington

learned about the situation here, they

asked Chief Talley for his cooperation.

MARTIN

This is bullshit.  I should've been

notified.

MR. JONES

I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's

after midnight.  Now, if you'll pull your

people off the perimeter, I want to get

my people in position.

TALLEY

Let it go, Captain.

MARTIN

Goddamned small town bullshit.

TALLEY

It's mine.

(into his phone)

Talley.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

Chief, it's Mikkelson.

TALLEY

Go, Mickey.

MIKKELSON

Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer.

We just went in there.

MIKKELSON (CONT'D)

He has human body parts in his

refrigerator.  He has five human heads.

TALLEY

(into his phone)

Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau.

Don't touch anything, just sit back and

wait.

MIKKELSON'S VOICE

Yes, sir.

TALLEY

We're getting those kids out of there.

DENNIS

(calling)

Kev?  Key, Kevin, c'mon back.  I'm sorry

I hit you.

DENNIS

C'mon, Kev, don't fuckin' pout!  You're

right.  It's time to call it a game.

MARS'S VOICE

Kevin left.  He didn't want to be here

anymore.

DENNIS

You mean he left, as in went out the

front door?

MARS

I overheard him with the girl.

DENNIS

Shit!  That fuck!  Even when I want to

turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he

take the kids with him?

MARS

I don't know.

DENNIS

Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he

took those kids, we're fucked!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

KEVIN!!!  You ASSHOLE!!!

MARS

Kevin left without you.

JENNIFER

I don't know what you're talking about.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Don't do that.  Turn on the lights.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's

coming back!

MARS

Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone,

everybody's gone.

MARS (CONT'D)

Now we can do whatever we want.

JENNIFER

Stop it.

MARS

You're going to enjoy this.

DENNIS

Who's that?  Goddamnit, who's there?

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Kev?  Is that you?  Talley?

DENNIS (CONT'D)

Kevin, if that's you, say something.

Mars said you left.

DENNIS

Kevin, what the fuck?  Get up.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

MARS?!?!

DENNIS (CONT'D)

MARS!!!

DENNIS

You're dead, you fuck.

MARS

What's wrong, Dennis?  Why're you so

pissed off?

JENNIFER

Please...

DENNIS

This fuck killed Kevin.  There's blood

everywhere down there --

THOMAS

C'mon, Jen!  Run!

THOMAS (CONT'D)

I'll shoot you!

JENNIFER

Keep going!

MARS

Everyone's gone.  We can do whatever we

want.  We can do anything.

THOMAS

I'll shoot you!  I'm not kidding, you

better stay away!

JENNIFER

Run!!!!!

JENNIFER

No!  They have everything nailed!

JENNIFER

He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.

THOMAS

I know.

JENNIFER

What's he doing?

JENNIFER (CONT'D)

Ohmigod, he's going to burn us!

TALLEY

We've got to get those kids out of there!

MR. JONES

Not until the man calls.

TALLEY

Those kids are in there with a fucking

psychopath!  He kills people!

MR. JONES

They've been in there all day.

TALLEY

(into his phone)

Talley.

THOMAS'S VOICE

Mars killed Kevin and Dennis!  We're in

the security room.  He's burning the

house --

TALLEY

You do what you have to do; I'm getting

those kids.

MR. JONES

Talley!  We'll secure the house, but then

we get the disks.

MR. JONES

Go --

TALLEY

The kids are in here!

MR. JONES

Where's the office?

TALLEY

Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks

later!

MR. JONES

We don't need you any more, Chief.  We

can get the disks on our own.

TALLEY

Thomas!  Thomas, it's me!

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Stay close.  We're going to move fast --

TALLEY

(to Thomas)

Are the disks still in your room?

THOMAS

No!  They're right here --

CUT TO:

TALLEY

(quietly)

Smith.

JENNIFER/THOMAS

Daddy!

WALTER

Thank God!  Are you guys all right?

You're not hurt?

THOMAS

Our house is on fire!  We almost burned!

WALTER

(to Jennifer and Thomas)

You guys step out for a second.  I have

to talk to the Chief.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Did you find the disks?

TALLEY

Yes.

WALTER

Then you have everything.  You can put

them away.

TALLEY

(touches his wrist)

A man has my family.  Gold watch here.

Dark tan.

WALTER

That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his

way for the disks.

TALLEY

How do I reach him?

HOWELL'S VOICE

Hello?

TALLEY

Two words:  Glen Howell.

HOWELL

How did you get this number?

TALLEY

Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his

men.  The other three are in jail.  I

have the disks.  I have Walter Smith.

And you know what, you motherfucker?  I

have you.

HOWELL

I have your fucking family.  Don't forget

that.

TALLEY

I also have a couple of million in cash.

Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.

HOWELL

What do you want?

TALLEY

My wife and my daughter and the money.

I'll bring the disks to the mall by the

freeway, you bring my family.  We'll

trade.

HOWELL

Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!

TALLEY

I think you got no choice.

HOWELL

Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on

the road west of town?

TALLEY

Yeah.

HOWELL

You got ten minutes.  If you're one

minute late, we won't be here to find.

BELDONE

The house is in flames, Benza's

accountant is with the cops, and they're

stacking the bodies like cordwood.

CASTELLANO

Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.

BELDONE

You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I

would've moved in when we first found

out.

CASTELLANO

And by doing so, he would've known we

have spies in his organization.

BELDONE

(embarrassed)

Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If

the cops end up with the disks, we're

gonna see a whole lot of heat.

CASTELLANO

I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I

hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too.

Always with the tan.

BELDONE

What do you want to do?

CASTELLANO

Our people out there, they good people?

People in the right place?

BELDONE

The best.

CASTELLANO

Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off,

fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end

up with those disks, we cut our losses.

BELDONE

I understand.

CASTELLANO

I want a message sent:  No fuckups

allowed.

BELDONE

I'll make the call.

MANELLI'S VOICE

You see anything?

RUIZ

Not yet.

HOWELL

(to the Fat Man)

Keep your eyes open.  He should've been

here.

TALLEY

(screaming)

Police!

HOWELL

Don't shoot!  Don't shoot him!

TALLEY

Where's my family?!  Where's my family,

you fuck?!

HOWELL

Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're

here to do business.

TALLEY

You said they would be here, goddamnit!

Where are they?

HOWELL

They're close.  Let me make a call.  You

can see they're okay.

TALLEY

You said they would be here!

HOWELL

(into the phone)

Put on the woman.

TALLEY

(into the phone)

Jane?

JANE'S VOICE

Jeff, we're --

HOWELL

You have the disks?

TALLEY

You get the other one when I have my

girls.  Not talk to them; have them.

HOWELL

Where is it?

TALLEY

Close.

HOWELL

I have to see if it's real.

HOWELL (CONT'D)

All right.  Now the second one.

TALLEY

First my girls.  I get my girls, you get

the other disk.

HOWELL

(into the phone)

Bring them.  Stop the car outside the

room, but don't get out.

HOWELL (CONT'D)

(into his phone)

Aim your gun at the woman's head.  If he

doesn't give me the disk, kill her.

TALLEY

I'll kill you!  You won't get the other

disk!

HOWELL

If you shoot me, he'll kill your

daughter.  Do you want to lose both of

them?

HOWELL (CONT'D)

The negotiation is over, Talley.  I won.

Now give me the disk or he'll put her

brain on the glass.

TALLEY

I love you.

TALLEY (CONT'D)

I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and

they're giving it to the real FBI.  This

one's a fake.

HOWELL

You'd better be kidding.

TALLEY

I'm a cop, you asshole!  What did you

expect me to do?  Pretend all this never

happened?

TALLEY (CONT'D)

Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want

to take my family home.

HOWELL

Are you out of your mind?

MARION

(quietly)

You fucked up, Glen.

HOWELL

Kill them.

MARION

No fuckups allowed.

MARION (CONT'D)

It's like a storm, isn't it?  This raging

force that you can't control does

whatever it wants, and the best you can

do is survive.  A winner survives.

TALLEY

Why...?

MARION

What good would it do to kill you?  The

police already have the disk.

MARION (CONT'D)

Your wife is a very nice lady.

BENZA

The fucking jet's waiting!  Would you get

your shit out here?!

A VOICE

No fuckups allowed.
