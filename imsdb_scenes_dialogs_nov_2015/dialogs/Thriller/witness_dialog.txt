WITNESS

"WITNESS"

by

Earl W. Wallace

William Kelley

Pamela Wallace

PREACHER

...a brother has been called home.

God has spoken through the death of

our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

PREACHER

...husband of Rachel, father to

Samuel, son of Eli.

(and)

His chair is empty, his bed is empty,

his voice will be heard no more. He

was needed in our presence, but God

needs such men, too. That one should

be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow.

Still, we would not wish him back.

Rather we should prepare ourselves

to follow him.

CUT TO:

STOLTZFUS

Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

BEILER

But not the man to buy a horse for

you.

(and)

Hochstetler, wasn't it your father

sold him that horse with a ruptured

testicle?

TOM

(grins)

Told him it was a bee sting made him

limp that way.

HOCHSTETLER

(amused)

That horse had one good ball. That's

all it takes.

HOCHSTETLER

I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let

us hope he walks close with God.

RACHEL

I'm sure he does, Daniel.

RACHEL

Daniel?

HOCHSTETLER

I... I was at the feed store. And I

saw your horse, so...

HOCHSTETLER

You will come back soon?

SAMUEL

Quickly, Mother Quickly!

ELI

You be careful out among them English.

RACHEL

I need time, Daniel.

SAMUEL

Look, Mama...!

RACHEL

I see, darling.

SAMUEL

Is this where we're going?

RACHEL

Of course not. We're going to

Baltimore. It's much nicer in

Baltimore.

are drawing curious stares.

RACHEL

We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where

is that train, please?

TICKET SELLER

Delayed three hours. You'll hear an

announcement when it's time to board.

PARTNER

Jesus...

PARTNER

Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOOK

You found the body?

CUSTODIAN

Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported

it. It was the kid.

BOOK

What kid?

CUSTODIAN

How'n hell do I know what kid? The

kid in the funny black threads.

BOOK

Hi, kid.

RACHEL

What do you want of my son?

BOOK

I'm a police officer. I'm going to

have to talk to the boy. What's his

name?

RACHEL

Samuel. Samuel Lapp.

(then, quickly)

But what happened here is none of

his affair. My sister is expecting

me... our train is leaving soon.

BOOK

There'll be another train.

(turns to Samuel)

The man who was killed tonight was a

policeman, Sam. It's my job to find

out who did it. I want you to tell

me everything you saw when you went

in there.

SAMUEL

(stammers)

I saw him.

BOOK

Who'd you see?

BOOK

Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the

floor?

SAMUEL

No... I saw the man who killed him.

BOOK

Anybody know about this?

CARTER

I didn't even know about it.

BOOK

(back to Sam)

Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he

looked like?

SAMUEL

(groping, touching

his clothes and

pointing at Carter)

He was... like him.

BOOK

(nods)

Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

SAMUEL

Not Zwartich, like him

BOOK

Try that one again, Sam

RACHEL

May I talk to you?

RACHEL

Zwartich. It's the way we say...

dwarf.

(glances at Carter)

Not like him... very big.

DONAHUE

(to aides)

Close it all down... I want a man on

every exit... I want the lab in here

now!

(to Book)

And I want to talk to you, Captain.

BOOK

All right, talk.

DONAHUE

This is homicide  not Internal

Affairs! So why are you behaving

like you own this case?

BOOK

We were running Zenovitch... That's

all I can tell you. But I want it,

Terry.

(then)

I've got a call into Schaeffer.

SAMUEL

(alarmed)

Momma... are they angry with us.

RACHEL

(reassuring, but hardly

in her own mind)

No... No. It is just the English

way.

DONAHUE

You ought to think about coming back

to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with

Internal Affairs and you're not gonna

have any friends left.

BOOK

(smiles right back)

I'll buy a dog.

BOOK

Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

SCHAEFFER

How reliable is this kid?

BOOK

Oh, he's good.

SCHAEFFER

Amish.

BOOK

Yeah.

SCHAEFFER

What have you got?

BOOK

Zenovitch was about to deliver a

list of names tonight  street

chemists... the guys processing this

P2P into speed.

SCHAEFFER

So one of them got to him.

BOOK

Maybe.

SCHAEFFER

You know who?

BOOK

Maybe.

SCHAEFFER

You're still convinced there's a

link to the department?

BOOK

If there isn't I've just wasted the

last six months.

SCHAEFFER

That's the problem. We need results.

The press is driving us crazy over

this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed

capitol of the country'. You know

the sort of thing. It's getting

political. The Commissioner's getting

very uneasy.

BOOK

The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll

make it, but Set Donahue and the

Homicide Department off my back or

they'll blow the whole thing.

SCHAEFFER

When word gets out that Zenovitch

was a cop, all hell will break lose.

You've got 24 hours. That's all I

can give you. 24 hours on your own.

After that the case and the witness

go back to the Homicide Department.

SCHAEFFER

(shakes his head)

Tell you what... why don't you and

that blonde  what's-her-name  come

over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout

that.

BOOK

What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.

SCHAEFFER

(sighs)

Well, anyway, don't get crazy.

(dismisses him)

I'll do something for Zenovich's

wife.

CARTER

I got there late, John.

BOOK

Let's just find Coalmine.

(beat)

Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You

didn't let anybody down. It happens

CARTER

(grimly)

It won't happen again.

RACHEL

Where are you taking us?

BOOK

We're looking for a suspect. We've

reason to believe he's still in the

area.

RACHEL

You have no right to keep us here.

BOOK

Yes I do. Your son is a material

witness to a homicide.

RACHEL

You don't understand, we have nothing

to do with your laws!

BOOK

Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of

people like that.

RACHEL

It's not a joke.

BOOK

You're right. It's not a joke. Listen,

I know a little about the Amish. I

know this has to be an ordeal for

you; and I'm really sorry you an

Samuel got involved.

BOOK

What was that?

RACHEL

He wants to know who you are. Your

name. I told him we don't need to

know anything about you.

BOOK

Book. John Book

BOOK

Sammy, where's Coalmine?

SAMMY

What you got there, the Salvation

Army?

BOOK

Coalmine.

SAMMY

Try "Happy Valley".

BOOK

Put some light on him.

BOOK

(continuing; to Samuel)

Look at him.

RACHEL

John Book, you listen to me! I will

have no further part in this, nor

will my son! As God stands between

us!

DOORMAN

Ma'am?

RACHEL

No! We do not stay in hotels.

ELAINE

How could you do this to me tonight?

I told you I had company

BOOK

Sorry. It's important.

BOOK

Where's Timmy and Buck?

ELAINE

Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?

BOOK

You've got a man here and the kids

are upstairs?

ELAINE

That's none of your goddamn business!

So keep your goddamn holier-than-

thou mouth shut!

(and)

Anyway, they like Fred.

BOOK

Oh sure, Fred.

ELAINE

Who are these orphans, anyway?

BOOK

They're Amish.

ELAINE

Everything okay?

RACHEL

Yes, thank you very much.

ELAINE

(a beat)

John said you're Amish.

RACHEL

Yes.

ELAINE

(blankly)

Oh.

SAMUEL

I don't want to stay here.

RACHEL

They are English. They don't

understand.

SAMUEL

I wish dawdie was with us.

RACHEL

(swallows)

I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

FRED

Wrong door, kid.

ELAINE

(mutters)

Jesus...

RACHEL

Good morning.

ELAINE

(helplessly)

You didn't have to...

RACHEL

I wanted to. you were kind to take

us in last night.

(and)

Anyway, I needed something to do. I

was so angry with your brother. He's

so... agaanisish!

ELAINE

Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like

John.

RACHEL

Just a minute. I'll pour you some

coffee.

ELAINE

You're not carrying a bullwhip...

how'd you manage to put my kids to

work?

RACHEL

(smiles)

I made it a contest... the one who

does best gets his cereal back first.

(and)

Children like to help... they only

need to be kept after a little bit.

ELAINE

Oh, is that so?

(and)

No offense, lady, but I'm not so

sure I like the idea of your coming

in here and turning the place upside

down!

RACHEL

Please, I didn't mean...

ELAINE

I know exactly what you meant! Listen,

maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau,

but maybe I don't have time to polish

the goddamn china and keep after the

kids!

(and)

It's none of your business, but I

don't happen to have a man around

here full time. So I sell cosmetics

in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes

I can even pay the rent on time! So

maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe

I don't need to have it jammed down

my throat like this.

ELAINE

There is that clean enough for you?

FRED

Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and

leave you a broom?

ELAINE

(blurts)

Go to hell, Fred!

FRED

What's bugging her?

RACHEL

I brought your coffee.

RACHEL

I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that

way.

ELAINE

It's okay.

(and)

Look, I shouldn't have blown my top.

It's like... somehow... I've let

everything get away from me. And you

sort of made me face it.

ELAINE

What's so funny?

RACHEL

Fred. The way he looked when you

screamed at him.

ELAINE

(disparing)

God, Fred...

RACHEL

At home you'd never hear a woman

scream at a man that way.

ELAINE

No? Why not?

RACHEL

You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish

way.

(then)

But I think it would have done me

good if I could have screamed at

your brother last night.

ELAINE

Listen, I don't know what's going on

or how you got mixed up with him,

but don't you let that self-righteous

son of a bitch push you around, okay?

RACHEL

Okay.

BOOK

Now what's the problem?

RACHEL

The problem is I don't happen to

think my son should be spending all

his time with a man who carried a

gun under his coat and goes around

whacking people.

BOOK

Whacking?

RACHEL

(firmly)

Yes. And I also want to leave this

city.

BOOK

Believe me, I'm trying to get this

over with as fast as I can. But Samuel

will probably have to come back and

testify.

RACHEL

We do not go into your courts.

BOOK

People who don't go into our courts

when they're told to sometimes go

directly into our jail.

BOOK

Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

RACHEL

(snaps)

No you're not

(off his look)

You're glad, because now you've got

a witness.

(and)

I heard the other police talking

last night.

(and)

They don't seem to like you very

much.

BOOK

They kid a lot.

RACHEL

(glances at him)

I would not be too sure.

RACHEL

He says you look very tired. I thought

the same thing.

RACHEL

But not a good tired.

BOOK

What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

BOOK

(to Rachel)

Just wanted to see if you were on

your toes.

RACHEL

Your sister said you don't have a

family?

BOOK

No.

RACHEL

She thinks you should get married

and have children of your own. Instead

of trying to be a father to hers.

Except she thinks you're afraid of

the responsibility.

BOOK

Oh? Anything else?

RACHEL

Oh yes. She thinks you like policing

because you think you're right about

everything. And you're the only one

who can do anything. And that when

you drink a lot of beer you say things

like none of the other police would

know a crook from a... um... bag of

elbows.

RACHEL

I think that's what she said.

RACHEL

Good appetite.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOOK

Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you

to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a

little help.

KAMAN

There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone

for you.

KAMAN

And, Captain, don't want to rush

you, but I'm gonna need these files

back in a half hour. We got a lot of

work to do round here.

RACHEL

Why don't you arrest that man? Are

you protecting him because policeman?

BOOK

(snaps)

Listen, I'm the cop that polices the

police. I'm not in the business of

protecting crooked cops.

(eases up)

I'll make an arrest when I know

everybody involved.

RACHEL

But why would they murder...

BOOK

Because  somehow  they knew I was

getting close.

(and)

Look, it's narcotics... They make

dope out of chemicals... they sell

it on the street for millions of

dollars. They'll do anything.

(and)

And they can get away with it because

they're cops.

RACHEL

(beat, then)

I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I

want to go home.

BOOK

You'll be safe. You don't have to

worry.

BOOK

Look, they're thinking as long as

they keep the killer out of Samuel's

way, we can't make an I.D. There's

no way they can know Samuel saw that

photograph, so he's safe.

BOOK

I mean it. You will be safe.

RACHEL

Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we

feel safe in a city where the police

are so busy killing each other!

CUT TO:

BOOK

It was McElroy, Paul.

BOOK

Last guy I would have figured. But

he's part of it.

SCHAEFFER

I hope you don't have any doubts

about that.

BOOK

If I did, I'd have kept my mouth

shut...

(and)

It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons

of P2P confiscated four years ago...

Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.

(excited, explaining

the thing eagerly)

He salts it away somewhere... he

knows the stuff is potent, but the

street chemists haven't figured out

how to process it. But they do now.

(and)

And now the stuff is worth five-grand

a pint and there are a lot of pints

in a fifty-five gallon drum.

SCHAEFFER

(beat)

Who else knows?

BOOK

Just us.

SCHAEFFER

(shakes his head)

Okay, what are you going to need to

clean it up

BOOK

More people... Gotta pick up where

Zenovich left off. People from outside

the department.

SCHAEFFER

(nods)

Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards

at Treasury. I'll take care of it.

(then)

I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut

their balls off for me. I'm counting

on you.

SCHAEFFER

What's your first move?

BOOK

(expels a breath)

A hot shower... I haven't changed

clothes in two days.

SCHAEFFER (V.O.)

Who else knows?

BOOK (V.O.)

Just us.

MAN

Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little

too much to drink?

MAN

Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a

hospital!

(and)

Here; I'll give you a hand.

BOOK

No! No hospital!

WIFE

Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to

die in the street, that's his

business!

MAN

Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at

that blood?

MAN

Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed

to death!

MAN

Shit!

WIFE

(quavering)

I told you, Henry!

CARTER

Yeah...

BOOK

Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish

woman's name and address on my desk

calendar, I want you to lose it for

me, Now. Tonight.

CARTER

What the hell are you talking about?

What's happening.

BOOK

Nothing. I'm not going to be around

for a while. I'll call you when I

can.

CARTER

(alarmed)

Johnny, what the fuck?

BOOK

(hard)

Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of

it. Maybe at the top of it.

BOOK

Yeah... I can put it all together

when I get back, 'Til then, you know

nothing, understand? Business as

usual...

CARTER

(beat)

I hear you.

BOOK

(nods)

Good. Take care of that woman's name

for me. And watch your ass.

ELAINE

It's John. He says you have to leave

now. He says it's urgent.

BOOK (V.O.)

Put my car in the garage and close

the door.

ELAINE

John, I don't understand any of this.

BOOK (V.O.)

(snaps)

You don't know anything... borrowed

your car. Didn't say why. And you

never heard of that woman and her

boy.

ELAINE

John, why?...

BOOK

(shouts)

Just do it!

RACHEL

Where are you taking us now?

BOOK

Home.

RACHEL

You couldn't wait until morning?

RACHEL

(insistent)

What happened?

RACHEL

You said we would be safe in

Philadelphia.

BOOK

I was wrong.

RACHEL

Kinner un Narre...

["Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret"

"Children and fools say the truth"

Amish expressions]

CUT TO:

RACHEL

Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make

coffee and breakfast.

BOOK

I can't.

RACHEL

What about Samuel? Will you come

back to take him to trial?

BOOK

(grimly)

There isn't going to be one.

ELI

Who was that man?

RACHEL

His name is John Book.

SAMUEL

Momma  look.

CUT TO:

RACHEL

But John... why didn't you go to a

hospital?

BOOK

No, no doctor...

RACHEL

(bewildered)

But why?

BOOK

Gunshot... they'll file reports...

they'll find me.

RACHEL

But

BOOK

And when they find me, they'll find

your boy!

ELI

Is the English dead?

RACHEL

No...

ELI

Looks dead...

ELI

Stoltzfus is coming.

ELI

That has no place in this house.

RACHEL

I know.

RACHEL

It will go when he goes.

RACHEL

Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

STOLTZFUS

That's the English is it?

STOLTZFUS (O.S.)

I feel... burning.

STOLTZFUS

This man should be treated in town.

(indicates)

The bullet entered there... and came

out there. But there is the danger

of infection, and he has lost a great

deal of blood.

RACHEL

Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

RACHEL

No, he must stay here.

ELI

Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if

he dies? Then the sheriff will come.

They'll say we broke their laws

RACHEL

We'll pray that he doesn't die! But

if he does, then we'll find a way so

no one knows!

ELI

Rachel, this is a man's life, we

hold it in our hands.

RACHEL

I know God help me, I know that,

Eli.

(then)

But I tell you that if he's found

here, the people who did this to him

will come for Samuel.

RACHEL

What else can we do?

STOLTZFUS

Make a poultice... three parts milk,

two parts linseed oil... for the

infection.

RACHEL

Thank you.

STOLTZFUS

Lapp, I'll have to speak with the

diener on this matter.

ELI

(nods)

As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

CUT TO:

RACHEL

It's all right! You have got to lie

still.

RACHEL

(soothingly)

Yes, much better...

SCHAEFFER

Looks like we're going to need some

help from you folks down there.

UNDERSHERIFF

...want to help any way we can, Chief,

but you got to understand we've got

upwards of seven thousand Amish over

here.

SCHAEFFER

I've got the woman's name, Sheriff.

Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should

simplify your work.

UNDERSHERIFF

How about an address?

SCHAEFFER

Ah... no.

UNDERSHERIFF

(frowns)

Maybe a road or route number?

SCHAEFFER

Sorry.

UNDERSHERIFF

Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third

Amishman around here is named Lapp.

That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.

(and)

Chief, if the Amish have taken your

man in, I wouldn't want to hang from

a rope until you find him.

SCHAEFFER

Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an

education.

CUT TO:

TSCHANTZ

Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to

your credit.

STOLTZFUS

He was touched by God's hand.

RACHEL

Hello.

BOOK

(closing his eyes)

Who are they?

RACHEL

The leadership of our district...

the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the

one with no hair on top. They decided

to come and see you for themselves.

Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came

the first day. I think he saved your

life.

BOOK

Can I have something to drink?

BOOK

Does anybody know I'm here?

RACHEL

Only the elders.

BOOK

How long?

RACHEL

What?

BOOK

How long have I been here?

RACHEL

Two days.

BOOK

(a beat)

Listen, thank you. Thanks for

everything. But I've got to go.

RACHEL

(frowns)

But you can't.

RACHEL

See. Anyway, you don't have any

clothes on. And besides that, Bishop

Tschantz wants to talk to you when

you feel better.

STOLTZFUS

Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket.

And drink my of my tea.

BOOK

Tell him his tea stinks.

RACHEL

(smiles)

You tell him. When you're able.

RACHEL

(from the door)

We're all very happy that you're

going to live, John Book. We didn't

quite know what we were going to do

with you if you died.

HERSHBERGER

...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

TSCHANTZ

It is not the first time we have

done this. In the Englischer war of

the revolution, old Elmer Miller's

grandfather took in gunshot English

soldiers.

(a tad of pride)

Saved them, too.

ERB

Still, he should be among his own

people.

RACHEL

He'll leave as soon as he is able.

He already wants to go.

HERSHBERGER

How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

STOLTZFUS

(shrugs)

A month. Maybe less. With God's

healing love.

ELAINE

(half fearfully)

Did you find him?

SCHAEFFER

Not yet.

ELAINE

Then go away, you bastard.

SCHAEFFER

Elaine, I've come to apologize for

Lt. McElroy. He overstated the

department's position.

ELAINE

(bitterly)

He accused John of taking kickbacks.

And you know  anybody who knows

John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

SCHAEFFER

(smoothly)

Of course, Elaine. But as long as

there's any question, better Johnny

should come back and clear his name.

ELAINE

(cuts in)

Better you should get off my front

porch before I get my mace!

SCHAEFFER

Elaine, I don't want to have to take

you in for questioning. You've got

his car, you were the last to see

him

ELAINE

(clipped)

I don't know where he is.

SCHAEFFER

But... if you had to guess?

MCELROY

She say where he is?

SCHAEFFER

I don't think she knows.

SCHAEFFER

What about Carter?

MCELROY

Tight. But I'm working on him.

SCHAEFFER

Lean on him.

BOOK

Give me that.

BOOK

Come here.

BOOK

You ever handle a pistol like this,

Samuel?

SAMUEL

(swallows)

No pistol. Ever.

BOOK

Tell you what  I'm going to let you

handle this one. But only if you

promise not to say anything to your

momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't

understand.

SAMUEL

(grins)

Okay, Mr. Book.

BOOK

Call me John.

BOOK

You don't want to point that at people

you just started calling by their

first name.

RACHEL

(snaps)

Samuel!

RACHEL

Wait for me downstairs.

RACHEL

John Book, I would appreciate it if,

during the time you are with us, you

would have as little to do with Samuel

as possible.

BOOK

Nobody meant any harm. The boy was

curious. I unloaded the gun -

RACHEL

It's not the gun. Don't you

understand... It's you. What you

stand for.

(and)

That is not for Samuel.

RACHEL

Please, it has nothing to do with

you personally.

BOOK

Put it up someplace Samuel can't get

it.

BOOK

Friends?

CUT TO:

ELI

The gun  that gun of the hand  is

for the taking of human life. Would

you kill another man? Eh?

ELI

What you take into your hands, you

take into your heart.

SAMUEL

I would only kill a bad man.

ELI

Only a bad man. I see. And you know

these bad men on sight? You are able

to look into their hearts and see

this badness?

SAMUEL

I can see what they do.

SAMUEL

I have seen it.

ELI

And having seen, you would become

one of them?

(intent... gesturing)

Don't you see...? The hand leads the

arm leads the shoulder leads the

head... leads the heart. The one

goes into the other into the other

into the other... And you have

changed, and gone amongst them...

ELI

"Wherefore come out from among them

and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

ELI

(indicating pistol;

continuing from

Corinthians 6:17)

"And touch not the unclean thing!"

RACHEL

Enjoying your reading?

BOOK

Very interesting. I'm learning a lot

about manure.

(eyes the clothing)

What's that?

RACHEL

Your shirt and jacket are still

stained with blood. I have them

soaking.You can wear these.

BOOK

Your husband's?

RACHEL

Yes. It's good that someone can have

the use of them. Besides, in your

clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

RACHEL

I should tell you these do not have

buttons.

(shows him)

See? Hooks and eyes.

BOOK

Something wrong with buttons?

RACHEL

Buttons are Hochmut.

BOOK

Hochmut?

RACHEL

Vain. Proud. Such a person is

Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.

BOOK

(nodding)

Anything against zippers?

RACHEL

(almost blushing)

You make fun of me. Like the tourists.

Driving by all the time. Some even

come into the yard. Very rude. They

seem to think we are quaint.

BOOK

Quaint? Can't imagine why.

BOOK

Where's the nearest telephone?

RACHEL

Telephone? The Gunthers across the

valley. They're Mennonite. They have

cars and refrigerators and telephones

in the houses even.

BOOK

No. I'd want a public phone.

RACHEL

Well... the store at Saltzburg...

(then briskly)

But you won't be going to Saltzburg

for a while.

BOOK

I'm going this morning.

RACHEL

But Stoltzfus said...

BOOK

(cutting in)

I know what he said.

RACHEL

You can go with Eli. He's taking

Samuel to school. But you'll have to

hurry.

BOOK

Rachel.

BOOK

Thanks.

ELI

Hurry up now, John Book!

RACHEL

You'd better go.

BOOK

My... eh... gun?

BOOK

The... bullets?

RACHEL

Oh. The bullets.

BOOK

(attempting a joke)

Not much good without them.

CARTER

Yeah?

BOOK

It's me.

CARTER

Johnny! Where the hell have you been?

BOOK

Never mind. I'm coming in to take

care of business. How hot am I?

CARTER

(low, urgent)

Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

BOOK

I'm coming.

CARTER

Listen, Johnny, don't do anything

stupid. You couldn't get within a

mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay

put... Stay in touch  I'll let you

know when maybe it makes sense.

CARTER

(edgily)

You hear me?

BOOK

(finally)

I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

CARTER

That's more like it.

(and)

Where are you at, anyway?

BOOK

Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

CARTER

(uncomprehending)

Say again?

BOOK

Make that 1790.

ELI

If you are well enough to do that

thing, you can do work for me.

BOOK

Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind

me plugging in to your battery. Mine's

dead... How can I help? What can I

do?

ELI

Maybe milking.

BOOK

(eyes Eli)

Milking?

ELI

Cows. You know, cows?

BOOK

I've seen pictures.

ELI

Good, you start tomorrow.

ELI

(briskly)

Veck oufl. Time for milking.

ELI

Good, firm twist and pull, eh?

(and)

Right. Now you try it.

ELI

Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You

never had your hands on a teat before?

BOOK

(grimly)

Not one this big.

BOOK

(alarmed)

Careful, son

who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover

SAMUEL

That's Luke. He doesn't like

strangers.

BOOK

(still shaken)

You don't say.

ELI

Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.

CUT TO:

HOCHSTETLER

Good morning. Book, is it? You are

the Yankee they talk about?

BOOK

I thought I was the English.

HOCHSTETLER

English, Yankee. It's the same. My

name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.

(sizes up his clothes)

You look plain, Book.

(grinning)

Very plain.

HOCHSTETLER

I came to see Rachel Lapp.

BOOK

Try the house.

HOCHSTETLER

(genially)

You bet. you take care of yourself.

BOOK

Pigs.

RACHEL

Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the

district. He and his father built

the big house themselves forty years

ago.

BOOK

Oh?

(and)

What happened to Hochstetler?

RACHEL

We had some lemonade and he left.

BOOK

A real fireball.

RACHEL

You know carpentry?

BOOK

I did some carpentry summers when I

was going to school.

RACHEL

What else can you do?

BOOK

(really annoyed)

I can whack people. I'm hell at

whacking.

RACHEL

Whacking is not of much use on a

farm.

BOOK

Now hold on. There's a lot of people

who think being a cop is a legitimate

job.

RACHEL

I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.

RACHEL

Tonight I'll let out those trousers

for you.

CUT TO:

ELI

Eat up, Book. What's the matter with

your appetite?

BOOK

Guess I'm not used to so much.

ELI

(snorts)

Not used to hard work. That's what

makes an appetite.

RACHEL

Eli, John is a carpenter.

(conciliatory

afterthought)

As well as being a fine policeman.

ELI

Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to

Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how

good a carpenter.

BOOK

Sure.

RACHEL

But... You may not be well enough.

BOOK

I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus'

tea.

BOOK

Hi...

RACHEL

(beat)

When will you be going?

BOOK

Not long... A few days.

BOOK

You like it... Don't you?

RACHEL

No... You just stop

BOOK

(mock alarm)

Next thing you know you'll be off

drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

ELI

Rachel!

ELI

(in the dialect)

What is this? This Myusick?

BOOK

It's not her fault. I

ELI

(in the dialect)

How can this be? How can you do such

a thing? Is this plain? Is this the

ordnung?

RACHEL

I have done nothing against the

ordnung.

ELI

(in the dialect)

Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this

man to our house. With his gun of

the hand. You bring fear to this

house. Fear of English with guns

coming after. You bring blood and

whispers of more blood. Now English

music... and you are dancing to

English music! And you call this

nothing?

RACHEL

I have committed no sin.

ELI

(in English)

No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel,

it does not look...

(tone softening... in

the dialect)

Don't you know there has been talk?

Talk about you, not him. Talk about

going to the Bishop. About having

you... shunned!

RACHEL

That is idle talk.

ELI

(in English, pleading)

Do not make light of it, Rachel.

They can do it... quick! Like that!

And then... then I can not sit at

table with you. I can not take a

thing from your hand. I... I can not

go with you to meeting!

(the old man almost

breaks down as, in

the dialect)

Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go

too far! Dear child!

RACHEL

I am not a child.

ELI

(suddenly stern again)

You are acting like one!

RACHEL

I will be the judge of that.

ELI

(fierce as a prophet)

No! They will be the judge of that!

And so will I... if you shame me!

RACHEL

(blinking a tear now,

but meeting his gaze)

You shame yourself.

SCHAEFFER

You know where he is.

CARTER

Wrong.

SCHAEFFER

You'd lie to protect him.

CARTER

(cool)

Probably.

SCHAEFFER

You admit you're lying?

CARTER

(shakes head)

I admit I don't know where he is.

SCHAEFFER

You're the first one he'll contact.

CARTER

(sighing)

He's got my number.

SCHAEFFER

It's funny. I know he's hiding

somewhere with the Amish, I know it.

(a quick glance at

Carter)

Can you imagine John Book at a prayer

meeting? Our John Book?

SCHAEFFER

Either you're a member of the club

or you aren't, Elton.

(he nods his head, as)

Tell me what you know...

CARTER

What I know, Paul, is...

(nodding his head)

He's going to take you out...

BOOK

All right, you nasty son of a bitch,

we're going to be friends whether

you like it or not.

BOOK

See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't

you for Christ's sake?

RACHEL

(surprised)

Well...

BOOK

Won him over just like that.

RACHEL

I see.

(and)

But I hope you have a lot of sugar.

(then, going)

Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

BOOK

Later.

ELI

Wait here 'til I find a gang you can

work with.

HOCHSTETLER

Book! Good to see you!

HOCHSTETLER

Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

BOOK

It's been a while.

HOCHSTETLER

No matter. Come with me. We can always

use a good carpenter.

RACHEL

Good luck.

HOCHSTETLER

Your hole is healed, then?

BOOK

(gives him a look)

Pretty much.

HOCHSTETLER

Good. Then you can go home.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. YODER

Everyone has an idea about you and

the English.

RACHEL

All of them charitable, I'm sure.

MRS. YODER

Hardly any of them.

HOCHSTETLER

Nail it!

BOOK

Yes, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

HOCHSTETLER

We admire our work!

CUT TO:

BOOK

Hey, Sam...

SAMUEL

...I want to say a thing.

BOOK

(sitting up)

What's that, Sam?

BOOK

Same to you, Sam.

BOOK

Sam?

CUT TO:

BOOK

Last night.

BOOK

If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't

leave.

BOOK

Maybe I ought to learn to drive this

thing.

BOOK

(beat)

Pick myself up another useful skill.

RACHEL

Samuel, who is that?

SAMUEL

It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

BOOK

(teasing her)

Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

TOURIST LADY

Could I... ah, you know?

BOOK

(smiling)

Lady, if you take my picture, I'll

rip your brassiere off and strangle

you with it.

BOOK

Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

VOICE

Are you a member of the family?

BOOK

What? I'm a friend of his.

VOICE

I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter

was killed in the line of duty...

MRS. SCHAEFFER

How are you, John?

MRS. SCHAEFFER

(covering mouthpiece)

John Book!

SCHAEFFER

I'll take it in the study.

SCHAEFFER

You can hang up, dear.

BOOK

You made a mistake, Paul. You

shouldn't have taken Elton out.

SCHAEFFER

(beat)

How bad did Mac get you? We figured

pretty bad.

BOOK

I'm fine. I'm going to live a long

time. That's what I called to tell

you.

SCHAEFFER

(quickly)

Johnny

BOOK

You might want to pass it along to

Mac.

SCHAEFFER

(urgently)

Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're

out there all alone... We're getting

close... real close... Maybe if you

listen to me for a minute we can

work something out so you can come

in

BOOK

I've already got something worked

out.

(and)

Be seeing you.

RACHEL

Do nothing. This happens from time

to time.

RACHEL

It's not our way, John. We'll have

nothing to do with violence! John!

YOUTH

Here comes another one!

BOOK

(quietly)

You're making a mistake.

HOCHSTETLER

Everything is all right, John.

BOOK

(to the youth)

Pick up the hat.

LOCAL MAN

Never seen anything like that in all

my years.

RACHEL

(covering)

He's from... Ohio... My cousin.

LOCAL MAN

We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be

different.

(addresses a gathering

crow)

Our Lancaster brethren, they just

don't have that kind of fight in

them.

RACHEL

John, lost control of himself. He...

will be repentant.

LOCAL MAN

(to Rachel)

You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

RACHEL

Yes. Samuel! We're going.

SECOND MAN

Kid's nose is broken!

LOCAL MAN

We'll take him up the hospital. Good-

day to you, Mrs. Lapp.

(he shouts after her)

This ain't good for the tourist trade,

you know! You tell that to your Ohio

cousin!

RACHEL

You should not bother with that

birdhouse.

(a beat)

If you're leaving tomorrow.

BOOK

I'm leaving tonight.

(and)

I'm going to need my clothes. And my

gun.

RACHEL

There was a time when I thought you

might have stayed.

BOOK

(hesitating... then)

There was.

RACHEL

There was a time when I would have

welcomed it.

BOOK

(after a beat)

I know.

RACHEL

(asking)

I was being foolish?

BOOK

No.

(and)

I was being unrealistic. Even thinking

about living this life.

RACHEL

You're so sure of that?

BOOK

Aren't you? After today?

RACHEL

(almost conceding it,

but... her voice

rising a bit, annoyed)

I'm not so sure of anything as you

are, John Book. You could live this

life if you wanted to bad enough.

(a beat)

Just as I could live yours!

BOOK

(almost groaning)

Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

RACHEL

There is always a way! But you are

such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot

see! You'd rather go back to that

city! To nothing! No woman! No

children! No land!

BOOK

(now getting annoyed)

Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman

and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's

what I know and that's what I do!

RACHEL

What you do is take vengeance! Which

is a sin against heaven!

BOOK

That's your way, not mine.

RACHEL

That's God's way!

BOOK

Well in the City of Philadelphia,

God needs a little help!

RACHEL

I could never love a man who was

so... little.

RACHEL

The other night... when you saw me

after my bath... I... I tried to

look as I thought you would want a

woman to look.

(sadly... but with a

slight, proud lift

of chin)

I am sorry... that I did not.

RACHEL

Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

SHERIFF

There... White Oak Road a couple of

miles before it ties into two-twenty-

two. Got it?

SCHAEFFER

Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

SHERIFF

My man Holmes here put it together.

Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the

doctor at the hospital.

SCHAEFFER

Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked

on the phone.

(nods at Holmes)

Good work.

UNDERSHERIFF

Sure you don't want us to post some

backup units?

SCHAEFFER

If we need any help, we'll give you

a shout. I'd like to slip in there

quiet, then get out before we attract

any attention.

HOLMES

Maybe I'll take a drive over that

way.

SHERIFF

Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

MCELROY

Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity.

What do you figure they plug all

their shit into?

SCHAEFFER

They don't have any shit.

SCHAEFFER

(to Fergie)

Outside

(to Mac)

Check out the rest of the house.

SCHAEFFER

We're police officers. We're looking

for a fugitive, John Book. He's living

here?

ELI

I have nothing to say to you. Get

out of my house!

SCHAEFFER

You speak English. Good. Now listen

RACHEL

(recovering)

No, you listen. Get out!

SCHAEFFER

Lady, I'm here to help you. This man

is very dangerous. An armed criminal.

(ingratiating)

He's got a gun, hasn't he?

RACHEL

You have no right here!

MCELROY

He's not in this building.

SCHAEFFER

(to Eli)

All right, where is he?

ELI

John Book!

SCHAEFFER

He'll live.

RACHEL

You might have killed him!

SCHAEFFER

(to McElroy)

Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll

watch these two.

SAMUEL

Is it them?

BOOK

(turning, mind racing)

It's them, Sam.

(he bends to the boy,

takes him by the

shoulders)

Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to

me carefully. Listen to me as you

never listened before.

SAMUEL

(interrupting)

Are they going to kill you?

BOOK

Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go

across the new corn to Stoltzfus'.

Run as fast as you can. And stay

there!

SAMUEL

What are you going to do?

BOOK

I'll be all right. You just do as I

say.

SAMUEL

Don't let them hurt you.

BOOK

(rising, pushing Samuel

toward door)

I won't. Now run.

(as Sam looks back)

Fast as you can!

SAMUEL

(stricken)

Mr. Book?

SCHAEFFER

Get back in there.

RACHEL

My son is out there!

SCHAEFFER

Nobody's going to hurt your son...

MCELROY

(softly)

Fergie?

SCHAEFFER

What the hell happened?

MCELROY

Book, you sneaky bastard, I know

you're here! Come out and fight!

BOOK

(shouting)

Hey, Mac!

SCHAEFFER

You stay put!

are baling the first cutting of June hay.

SCHAEFFER

Cut that out!

SCHAEFFER

Get down to the house and stay there!

ELI

Praise Gott!

ELI

(fiercely)

No, Rachel...

RACHEL

I have to help him!

ELI

It is not our way!

SCHAEFFER

Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

BOOK

It's okay, Sam.

SCHAEFFER

Hold it.

SCHAEFFER

Get back, you people!

(prodding)

Keep moving, Johnny...

BOOK

You're going to have to do it right

here, Schaeffer.

SCHAEFFER

Don't try me, Johnny!

ELI

So... will you kill us all, then?

BOOK

It's all over, Paul.

SCHAEFFER

Move! Or you die right here!

SAMUEL

Are you really ever coming back?

BOOK

Got to, Sam. You and I are going to

a courthouse together, put some people

behind bars.

SAMUEL

Have you got your gun on now?

BOOK

Sure have, Sam.

RACHEL

I want you to take this... to remember

by.

BOOK

Where's my baggy pants?

RACHEL

Here. Whenever you want them.

ELI

You be careful, John Book! Out among

them English!

FADE OUT

THE END
