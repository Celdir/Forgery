LIZZY

He lives under the bed.

LIZZY

You scared him...

MEAGAN

I scared him?

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Lizzy?

FREDDY

Where ya been all my death, baby?

FREDDY

(continuing)

I've been waitin' at the altar for

a long, long time!

SATANIC PRIEST

Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

SATANIC PRIEST

And the groomsmen...?

SATANIC PRIEST

(continuing)

If anyone here believes that these

matrimony, let him speak now or

forever rot in hell...

JESSE

Meagan!

MEAGAN

Jesse!

TRANSITION CUT TO:

MEAGAN

Freddy...

FREDDY DOLL

Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

HARD CUT TO:

MEAGAN

Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake

up.

LIZZY

I had a bad dream.

MEAGAN

Me, too.

LIZZY

I was scared.

MEAGAN

Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

LIZZY

Promise?

MEAGAN

Promise.

MEAGAN

(continuing)

I'll never let anyone hurt you.

NEWS REPORTER

(filtered)

As the sun rises on yet another

morning, still no end in sight for

the standoff between police and the

mysterious group known only as the

"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned

house behind me just thirteen days

ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-

away teenagers -- have managed to

keep police at bay for almost two

weeks while inside they take mind-

altering narcotics in order to

communicate with their god --

Freddy.

MEAGAN

Morning.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Morning, Meagan.

MEAGAN'S MOM

(calls upstairs)

Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast

is almost ready!

NEWS REPORTER

Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger

was released on a legal technicality

but later burned to death at the

hands of a vigilante mob of grieving

parents.  Some years later, a rash

of bizarre and unexplainable teen-

age deaths began leaving many in

the area to wonder... is Freddy

really dead?

MEAGAN'S MOM

Hurry up and eat. You don't want

to be late for special school.

MEAGAN

Mom! Don't call it that!

LIZZY

I hate that school. The other kids

are mean... and they're all re-

tard-ed!

MEAGAN'S MOM

We don't use that word. They're

"special" children just like you're

"special".

NEWS REPORTER

The cult members have declined to

an on-camera interview but did send

out a note with a message. The note

-- which, by the way, appears to

have been written in blood -- reads...

(reads the note)

To the parents of Springwood --

Freddy lives! Soon he will come and

take one of your children as his

virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-

and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and

-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child

shall be born. The vessel for Freddy

to rise and rule the darkness forever

and ever.

MEAGAN

That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Oh, look at the time! I've got to

be going... anyone need me to bring

anything home tonight?

MEAGAN

I need an alarm clock.

MEAGAN'S DAD

What's wrong with your old one?

MEAGAN

Broke.

MEAGAN'S MOM

We're almost out of vodka.

JESSE

Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

MEAGAN

My mom...

JESSE

And...?

MEAGAN

I had another dream last night...

JESSE

Was I naked?

MEAGAN

No. You were Jason.

JESSE

Jason? Oh, yeech...

(then)

Was I any good?

MEAGAN'S DAD

Do you have to watch that crap all

the time? Months and months of the

O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

NEWS REPORTER

I'm standing here with State Trooper

Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the

Governor has called in to deal with

the cultists because of his past

experience with occult-style

murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch

is the only law enforcement officer

ever to survive a one-on-one encounter

with notorious Camp Crystal Lake

killer -- Jason Voorhees.

(to Murdoch)

You received some pretty nasty

injuries in your battle with Jason,

didn't you, Captain?

MURDOCH

Nothing serious... just a few

stitches.

NEWS REPORTER

What about these so called "Freddy"

cultists? They seem like pretty

tough customers. Think you'll have

any trouble getting them out of

there?

MURDOCH

No. Now that the Governor has given

me complete authority to deal with

these punks I should be putting an

end to their situation pretty quick.

Unless of course their attorney is

able to get them to come out peace-

fully... but I don't hold out much

hope for that.

NEWS REPORTER

(to camera)

Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and

gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough

criminals.

CUT TO:

MURDOCH

Damn media... oughtta be a law.

(gestures to house)

Is that shyster still in there

trying to talk them out?

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Yeah... he's making them some kind

of deal.

MURDOCH

Damn lawyers... what a bunch of

assholes. Shakespeare was right --

kill all the lawyers. Then we could

kill all the punks with no hassles

and the world would be a safer place.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Smaller anyway.

MURDOCH

Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?

Long-haired, English freak. He was

probably a punk.

SLEAZY LAWYER

So, as I explained to you before,

the revenues between the TV movie

deal and the book sale should be

adequate to fund your joint-defense.

And I think with my mass media

hypnosis argument I could get each

of you a reduced sentence on appeal

-- say... twenty years each. Out

in fifteen with good behavior?

Hmmmmm?

HARD CUT TO:

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Jesus Christ!

MURDOCH

Freeze!

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Hold your fire!

LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE

Help me, mister... please.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Hang on, honey... I'll have you

out of there in a second.

MURDOCH

Looks like we'll have to hunt the

rest of them down. Let's go before

they get too far.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

We can't leave! Can't you see

we've got a situation here?

MURDOCH

Leave her.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

You're crazy! I can't just leave

her!

MURDOCH

Forget it. I've seen this before.

There's nothing you can do.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

I've got to try...

MURDOCH

You're wasting your time.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Fuck it!

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

(continuing; yelling)

CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

MURDOCH

Punks.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Are you okay, honey?

LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE

Freddy lives!

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

NO!

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

(continuing)

Jesus... you were going to kill

that kid, weren't you?

MURDOCH

I told you you were wasting your

time. Once these kids go rabid,

best thing to do is put 'em down.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

You can't be serious...

MURDOCH

Dead serious. See... the world is

made up of rules. Kids don't like

rules. They rebel for a while, but

ultimately they start to fall in

line and become ordinary Joe's like

you and me. But some kids... dope

smokers mainly, watching their MTV...

Satanic lyrics melting what's left

of their brains... these kids grow

up to be punks. And when these punks

step as far over the line as these

"Freddy" punks have -- then we as

peace officers have no choice but

to kill them.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

I didn't become a peace officer to

kill kids.

MURDOCH

Punks. There's a difference...

(under his breath)

...barely.

CUT TO:

MISS KREPPS

(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

MISS KREPPS

(continuing)

(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

MISS KREPPS

(continuing; loud)

Meagan!?

MEAGAN

Yes, ma'am?

MISS KREPPS

I asked if you were ready to give

your oral report?

MEAGAN

Yes... I'm ready.

MISS KREPPS

Please come up here to the podium.

MISS KREPPS

(continuing)

You won't think it's funny when

you haven't learned the fundamentals

of a free market economy... oh,

why do I waste my breath? You're

all going to grow up to be gas

station attendants and waitresses

anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

MEAGAN

My report is on Global Economic

Trends.

(clears throat;

begins reading)

Try and think of a world where there

is no poverty... no sickness... no

crime. A world where everyone is

happy to be alive and everyone lives

together in peace. This is my dream.

MEAGAN

(continuing)

This dream is becoming a reality

with ever-growing international

business...

MISS KREPPS

Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

MISS KREPPS

(continuing)

Louder, Meagan... we still can't

hear you.

FREDDY

Aww... all dressed up and nowhere

to blow!

MEAGAN

Jesse... please, help me.

FREDDY

Looks like a photo opportunity to

me!

FREDDY

(continuing)

Say... cheesecake!

HARD CUT TO:

MISS KREPPS

Meagan? Meagan?!

MISS KREPPS

(continuing)

I asked if you were ready to give

your report?

MEAGAN

Sure...

DISSOLVE TO:

SCHOOL NURSE

Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you

know where you are?

MEAGAN

I was day dreaming and then I woke

up but then it was like I was still

dreaming and then I woke up and

then I guess I fainted and now I'm

awake again...

SCHOOL NURSE

Are you sure?

SCHOOL NURSE

(continuing)

Meagan?

MEAGAN

I'm waiting to see if you're going

to turn into Freddy.

SCHOOL NURSE

Freddy... I see. You've been watching

too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"

cult thing -- it's all over the TV

day and night -- you can't get away

from it. No wonder you kids are all

having nightmares.

MEAGAN

But this one was different... it

felt real.

SCHOOL NURSE

But that's just it, Meagan... dreams

aren't real. They're just broken

fragments of the subconscious mind.

MEAGAN

Fear is real though, isn't it? And

if nightmares are fear, then doesn't

that make them real?!

(gets excited)

And if the nightmares are real then

is reality like a dream?!

SCHOOL NURSE

(cutting her off)

Meagan! You've got heat prostration...

that's all.

MEAGAN

Old witch... what does she know?

She isn't even qualified to give a

shot and she's telling me that my

dreams aren't anything to worry

about.

JESSE

So she said you were okay?

MEAGAN

Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there

says it's just a case of heat pro-

stration and an overdose of TV news.

Ruined my makeup, too.

JESSE

So you're going back to class?

MEAGAN

No. She gave me last period off.

JESSE

Well, what are you bitching about?

I could have a compound fracture of

the skull and she wouldn't excuse me

from P.E.

MEAGAN

Jesse! I've been having nightmares

for almost two weeks now and they

keep getting worse! Now I'm having

daymares! I want to know why!

JESSE

Okay... well, didn't the nurse say

it was heat probation?

MEAGAN

You don't understand... I want to

know more about dreams. What they

mean... why we have them.

JESSE

Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've

got the rest of the day off, that's

all I'm saying.

MEAGAN

That's a good idea. Why don't you

cut last period and come with me?

JESSE

Sure. Where are we going?

MEAGAN

The library.

JESSE

You want me to cut school so we can

go to the library?

CUT TO:

MEAGAN

Find anything?

JESSE

What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

MEAGAN

Did you know that our sub-conscious

retains everything that ever happened

to us? Everything. From the time

we're born until we die.

JESSE

Really?

MEAGAN

That's how Freddy gets at us...

by using our sub-conscious fears.

Fears our conscious minds have

repressed or forgotten.

JESSE

I've got a news flash for you...

Freddy's dead.

MEAGAN

I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists

in our sub-conscious then he can

never be fully erased. Like a bad

memory... you may blot it out of

your mind but it will alway be

hiding someplace in your dreams.

(off Jesse's

disbelieving stare)

Weren't you scared as a child by

something so stupid that you're

ashamed to admit it?

JESSE

No.

MEAGAN

No?

JESSE

Well, yeah.

MEAGAN

Well, what? What is it?

JESSE

Well... when I was kid, my brother

took me to the carnival. And in the

penny arcade there was this robot

gunslinger...

MEAGAN

Black Bart.

JESSE

You know about Black Bart?

MEAGAN

Duh. You put your quarter in and he

says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."

And then you pull your gun out and

shoot him.

JESSE

That's just it -- I never could!

I'd point the gun right at him and

shoot, and I could never hit the guy.

So I always got killed.

MEAGAN

No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

JESSE

Scared the shit out of me.

JESSE

(continuing;

flustered)

Isn't that scary? I mean... for a

kid?

JESSE

(continuing;

mad)

Okay, smartass... what about you?

What scared you the most as a kid?

MEAGAN

I remember... Lizzy wandered off

one day and we couldn't find her.

The police came and everything. I

wasn't really worried until I saw

her picture on TV... then I got

really scared.

(then)

Jesse, I can't explain it... but I

think something bad's going to

happen.

DISSOLVE TO:

LEONARD

You're stupid!

LIZZY

No, you are!

LEONARD

They forgot you again!

LIZZY

No, they didn't!

LEONARD

Yes, they forgot and you're goin'

to wait out here until it's dark

and then the monsters are goin'

come and get you!

LIZZY

No they won't, because I'm walkin'

home!

LEONARD

Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with

me! I got forgot too, you know!

LEONARD

(continuing)

Okay... I'm going to have to report

this!

CUT TO:

MEAGAN'S DAD

Didn't you get my message?

MEAGAN

What message?

MEAGAN'S DAD

I called the school after lunch...

I had to stay late after work...

I...

MEAGAN'S MOM

Don't you dare blame this on her,

you sorry bastard! It's all your

fault!

(to Meagan)

Where have you been anyway?

MEAGAN

The library.

MEAGAN'S MOM

A likely Goddamn story!

MEAGAN

Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?

Where's Lizzy?

MEAGAN'S DAD

She didn't come home from school

today. The police got a report that

a girl fitting Lizzy's description

was forced into a car by some

crazies. They're pretty sure it was

this "Freddy" cult.

MEAGAN

(shocked)

Oh, my God...

MEAGAN'S DAD

Now don't worry. The police are

doing everything they can.

TROOPER

(O.S.)

Hey, Cap'n... better have a look

up here!

TROOPER

Looks like she was in the cult all

along.

MEAGAN

No... no, she wouldn't do that!

Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

TROOPER

I know it's hard to believe, miss.

But a lot of good kids get caught

up in this kind of trouble.

MURDOCH

Punks...

MEAGAN'S DAD

Captain Murdoch... is there any-

thing we can do?

MURDOCH

You can pray, sir. Pray we find your

daughter before... well, before it's

too late. But rest assured, if I

can't persuade her to come back to

her loving home, then I'll do what's

best for her. I know you and your

wife wouldn't want her to suffer.

(to his men)

Come on... I want to go talk to

Erwin.

JESSE

Where are we going?

MEAGAN

Over to Stormie's.

JESSE

Stormie? I thought you and her weren't

friends anymore since she stole that

twenty dollars from you.

MEAGAN

That was her "klepto" phase... when

she was dating that gang member.

She dumped him a long time ago.

JESSE

I still don't understand. What has

she got to do with Lizzy missing?

MEAGAN

She used to be in the Freddy cult.

Maybe she knows where they took

Lizzy.

CUT TO:

STORMIE

If I did know I would call the

police, you know that. I love Lizzy.

No telling what those freaks will

do to her. Those Freddy cult guys

are hard core.

JESSE

I thought you were in the cult?

STORMIE

I was in the cult for a week cause

my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,

he was. But I just liked the music

and the clothes... when they were

clean, but not like the violence

and stuff. But that was just my

"cult" phase... but I got past that.

You know, just like my "gang" phase

when I was dating Ramon and then

before that was my "death rock"

phase when I was dating Stuart...

JESSE

Uh, excuse me... but what phase

are we in now?

STORMIE

Militant feminist, man-hating phase,

what's it fuckin' to ya?!

JESSE

(to Meagan)

Why don't you just let the cops find

her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he

knows how to deal with these cultist

psychos. He was the man who got Jason

Voorhees.

MEAGAN

That guy in my dreams...

STORMIE

Jason kicked his ass.

QUICK CUT TO:

JESSE

(V.O.)

Well... yeah. But Murdoch put

thirteen bullets in Jason before

he hacked his head open.

JESSE

(V.O.,

continuing)

But even with his head hacked open

and his brains leaking out, Murdoch

still managed to put his last bullet

in Jason's eye.

STORMIE

(V.O.)

Well, one of my mom's boyfriends

worked at the hospital where they

took him. He said that Murdoch lost

more than half his brain and what

little that was left was all twisted

up inside. And they had to replace

his skull with a metal plate to

keep that from leaking out.

STORMIE

(V.O.,

continuing)

They say he hasn't been the same

since.

CUT BACK TO:

JESSE

So what's different about him?

STORMIE

One thing... he used to be a

Democrat. Now he votes straight

Republican.

MEAGAN

I think he thinks Lizzy joined the

cult or something.

STORMIE

Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

MEAGAN

I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've

got to find her and save her from

Freddy before that crazy cop kills

her.

JESSE

Just where are you going to look?

I mean, these cult guys could be

holding her anywhere.

MEAGAN

Murdoch said something about going

to talk to somebody named Erwin.

STORMIE

Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the

Freddy cult! I bet he knows where

they took Lizzy!

JESSE

Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak

that used to eat bugs?

STORMIE

(annoyed)

Who else?

(to Meagan; bright)

Erwin is scary smart -- always brought

home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked

up, too... I mean, who isn't really?

Anyway, he quit the cult a few months

back and the cops put him away for

his own safety. They say Freddy's

put a death hex on Erwin.

JESSE

A death hex?

STORMIE

Yes, a death hex. You know... where

someone wants you dead!

MEAGAN

Where is he?

CUT TO:

MEAGAN

I want you to stay here.

JESSE

Why?

MEAGAN

Don't be mad... it's just that you

might scare him.

JESSE

Scare him?

STORMIE

What she's subtly trying to tell

you is that this needs a woman's

gentle touch... butthead.

MEAGAN

Just stay here... okay?

SECURITY GUARD

Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple

of visitors. Now be a good boy...

(to Meagan & Stormie)

You've got five minutes. I'll be

right down the hall if you need me.

MEAGAN

Erwin...?

ERWIN

SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

ERWIN

(continuing)

Where do you shoot?

MEAGAN

Shoot?

STORMIE

He's talking about dream dope --

the stuff the cultists shoot up

with so they can talk to Freddy.

MEAGAN

I don't do drugs.

ERWIN

You're not in the cult?

MEAGAN

No.

ERWIN

Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

MEAGAN/STORMIE

No.

ERWIN

I don't trust you... better take off

your clothes so I can check you for

tracks.

STORMIE

Chill, Erwin. We're here for some

hard data -- not a floppy disk.

ERWIN

Well, what do you want? Can't you

see I'm busy?

MEAGAN

Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

STORMIE

I told her you might know where

they took her.

ERWIN

I already told the cops everything

I know.

MEAGAN

Tell me... please.

ERWIN

Look... I'm sorry about your sister,

but I've got my own problems with

Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

MEAGAN

Then tell me why they took her...

ERWIN

To bear his child. Freddy wants to

be human again. In order to do that

he has to be "reborn".

MEAGAN

How can he do that?

ERWIN

He has to marry a virgin on holy

ground. Then the cult consumate

the marriage by impregnating her.

STORMIE

The whole cult? Yeech!

ERWIN

Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.

It's sort of a tradition with him.

MEAGAN

So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

ERWIN

And Freddy enters the soul of the

fetus through a dream state. Voila!

Rebirth.

STORMIE

That's the stupidest shit I ever

heard.

ERWIN

Hey, they're not my rules... some-

body else wrote 'em.

MEAGAN

Erwin... you've got to help me find

Lizzy. You're my only hope.

ERWIN

I'll help you find your sister, but

you've got to help me.

MEAGAN

Anything. Just name it.

ERWIN

You have to help me kill Freddy.

STORMIE

But Freddy's dead.

ERWIN

Freddy lives...

(looks at Meagan)

If only in our dreams.

STORMIE

Come on, Meagan... our five minutes

is up. He's giving me the creeps.

MEAGAN

How can you kill a dream?

ERWIN

When it's not a dream.

(then)

Do we have a deal?

MEAGAN

Deal.

CUT TO:

JESSE

No! I won't do it!

MEAGAN

Come on, Jesse! Please...?

JESSE

It's illegal! I could go to jail!

STORMIE

How will they ever know? Don't be

such a pussy!

JESSE

Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

STORMIE

Okay, I will!

MEAGAN

No! They'll never believe her!

STORMIE

I can disguise my voice...

(lowers voice)

Hello, how do you do? My name is

Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm

actually a wimp.

MEAGAN

They'll never believe that. Come

on, Jesse... for me?

JESSE

Okay... okay... I'll do it.

(to Stormie)

And I'm not a wimp!

JESSE

(continuing)

I need a quarter for the phone.

SECURITY GUARD

Springwood Mental Center... how

can I help you?

JESSE

(filtered; disguising

his voice)

There's a bomb planted in your

building.

SECURITY GUARD

Who is this?

JESSE

If I were you -- I'd get my ass

out of there.

JESSE

(continuing; adding)

Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

SECURITY GUARD

Hey, Erwin... where do you think

you're going?

SECURITY GUARD

(continuing)

I'm talking to you, asshole!

JESSE

He's not going to make it.

MEAGAN

We've got to do something!

ERWIN

Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for

busting me out of there!

JESSE

Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do

me one favor -- don't eat nothing

disgusting. My stomach is tight

enough as it is.

CUT TO:

ERWIN

Damn! We must have just missed them!

MEAGAN

Oh, my God -- she was here! This

is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all

torn!

(grabs Erwin)

Erwin... we've got to find her!

ERWIN

We're too late! There's no way...

except...

MEAGAN

Except what?!

ERWIN

We could go after Freddy.

MEAGAN

How?

ERWIN

We'll inject ourselves with Dream

Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that

brings on a dreamlike state.

MEAGAN

Okay... let's do it!

JESSE

Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,

what if one of us gets hooked or

something?

(whispers)

We could turn out like him!

ERWIN

Don't worry about it. We need you

wide awake anyway.

JESSE

What for?

ERWIN

We're going to go under and try to

find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab

him and bring him here. Then you

kill him with this...

JESSE

This rusty chunk of shit? What

good is this?

ERWIN

It's not the gun, it's what's in

it -- silver bullets blessed by a

priest.

JESSE

Will that work?

ERWIN

(shrugs)

Should. But then...

JESSE

(finishes for him)

You don't make the rules... yeah,

yeah.

MEAGAN

What should we do?

ERWIN

Have a seat over there and make

yourselves comfortable. Roll up

your sleeves and put these on...

STORMIE

Oh, cool!

MEAGAN

What are they for?

ERWIN

It's how the cult keeps in constant

contact with Freddy. The little

lights flashing are a sustained

occular input that causes your brain

to resonate at approximately the

same frequency at which the dream

state is most likely to occur.

STORMIE

Whatever...

(to Meagan; excited)

Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

ERWIN

It helps to hold hands if you want

to go together...

ERWIN

(continuing)

And remember... Freddy knows what

scares you.

ERWIN

WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!

LIZZY

(distant)

Meagan... help me... please...

ERWIN

Freddy's trying to split us up...

JESSE

Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff

in Dreamland now.

FREDDY

Looking for some-body?

STORMIE

I've got him! Wake us up! Wake

us up!

STORMIE

(continuing)

Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

FREDDY

Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

FREDDY

(continuing)

Stew on this, bitch!

HARD CUT TO:

STORMIE

Shoot him! Shoot him!

FREDDY

Well, well, well... if it isn't

my ol' pal, Erwin.

FREDDY

(continuing)

I've got something special in mind

for you...

HARD CUT TO:

STORMIE

You didn't help me, you pussy!

I could've had him!

(smacks him some more)

You gutless... spinless... jelly

fish!

LIZZY

(V.O.)

Meagan... help me... Meagan...

MEAGAN

Daddy?

MEAGAN'S DAD

Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

LIZZY

Help me...

LIZZY

(continuing)

Meagan...

HARD CUT TO:

STORMIE

Are you okay?

MEAGAN

(shaky)

He got away... I had him and he

got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I

lost her...

ERWIN

Well, atleast you're not dead.

MEAGAN

No... I'm not dead...

(realizes)

No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

STORMIE

He killed me, too. But look...

MEAGAN

Now that I think about it -- he's

killed me in all my nightmares. But

I'm not dead... what does it mean?

ERWIN

It means we've still got some time

left. Until his remains are host to

the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't

hurt us.

JESSE

Hello. The Dream Demons...?

ERWIN

Freddy made a pact with Satan when

he died... so Satan bestowed upon

him the Dream Demons. They're the

source of Freddy's power to manipulate

our physical reality. Without them...

he's powerless -- nothing more than

a bad dream.

(off Jesse's cynical

look)

Hey, like I said... I don't make

the rules.

MEAGAN

But we've still got a chance, right?

A chance to kill Freddy before he

gets back his power?

ERWIN

We already tried that. There's no

way for us to kill Freddy. He's too

clever. He knows how to get to us.

MEAGAN

Then let's get somebody else. Some-

body strong.

STORMIE

Yeah! We could hire somebody to

kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

ERWIN

You would have to hire a thousand

of them... or one really big guy

who isn't afraid of anything. No

fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

JESSE

Where are you going to find a hit

man? The yellow pages? In your

dreams...

MEAGAN

Jason...

JESSE

Jason?

MEAGAN

Jason Voorhees...

ERWIN

(brightens)

Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!

The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

STORMIE

Sounds like our man!

JESSE

Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but

isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

ERWIN

Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal

Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I

know how to bring him back to life.

JESSE

Somehow I just knew you would.

ERWIN

But that's not the problem. The

problem is control. Once we bring

Jason back from the dead... I'm not

one hundred percent sure he'll do

what we tell him.

STORMIE

Well, that's okay... as long as he

doesn't chop us all up.

MEAGAN

Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,

so tell me the truth. Do you think

if we do this -- if we go and get

Jason and bring him back to life,

that he could kill Freddy?

ERWIN

No doubt about. Jason could wreck

Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.

But if Freddy has home court advan-

tage... I don't know. Too close to

call. The trick would be to get Jason

to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,

and drag him out to our reality.

MEAGAN

I haven't got a choice. I've got to

try something...

(turns to Stormie &

Jesse)

I can't ask either of you to help

me do this... it's illegal, immoral,

disgusting...

STORMIE

Hey, we sisters have to stand

together, right? Where you lead --

I'll follow. Count me in.

JESSE

Let me get this straight... we're

going to go dig one dead maniac up

to fight another dead maniac?

ERWIN

That's about the size of it... and

I'd be doing you a disservice if I

said there weren't a modicum of risk

involved.

JESSE

Meagan... I don't want to do this...

MEAGAN

You don't have to, Jesse... it's not

your fight. I understand.

JESSE

But I damn sure don't want you to

do it without me. Count me in.

ERWIN

Look out Freddy... here we come.

CUT TO:

NIGHT WATCHMAN

What's matter, girl... you hear

somethin'?

NIGHT WATCHMAN

(continuing)

What's this? A funeral procession?

CULTIST

That's exactly what it is.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

(suspicious)

Yeah? Whose?

CULTIST

Yours.

FREDDY

Smokin'!

DISSOLVE TO:

JESSE

(V.O.)

We're almost there...

MEAGAN

(V.O.)

We should pull over and ask

directions.

STORMIE

(V.O.)

If it doesn't offend the men...

ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

JESSE

(V.O.)

Very funny.

STORMIE

I don't think they're open.

MEAGAN

It says, open all night.

JESSE

Hey! Can we get some service out

here?!

STORMIE

I don't think there's anybody

here...

CRAZY OL' COOT

What do you kids want?

MEAGAN

We're looking for the old cemetery

that's supposed to be around here...

somewhere.

CRAZY OL' COOT

What do you want to know for?

STORMIE

We want to see it.

CRAZY OL' COOT

Ain't nothin' to see, girly...

'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

JESSE

Look, mister... can you give us

directions or not?

CRAZY OL' COOT

You're not goin' up there to do

somethin' stupid, are you?

JESSE

(laughs; nervous)

Stupid? Like what?

CRAZY OL' COOT

Like dig up Jason Voorhees --

that's what!

JESSE

(looks at Meagan)

Jesus... why would anyone do that?

CRAZY OL' COOT

I dunno... but people do.

STORMIE

Been dug up a few times already,

has he?

CRAZY OL' COOT

More times than I care to remember.

MEAGAN

Well, we're just doing an article

for our high school newspaper about

the dangers of breaking into

cemeteries at night. You know,

stuff that can get you hurt...

CRAZY OL' COOT

Well... okay... as long as you're

not going up there to do something

stupid.

(pointing)

Take this road up about a mile and

make a left at the ol' saw mill.

That road will take you right on

in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --

can't miss it.

MEAGAN

What's the story on Jason Voorhees

anyway?

STORMIE

Where have you been? Jason was that

guy who ran around in a hockey mask,

chopping up camp counselors, duh?

MEAGAN

I knew that. What I mean was why?

ERWIN

It started a long time ago, back in

the fifties, when Jason drown at

Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went

berserk and started killing the

counselors.

STORMIE

She got her head chopped off by one

of the girls she was trying to kill!

ERWIN

Right. And then Jason came back from

his watery grave to get revenge.

JESSE

He came back from the grave?

ERWIN

Yeah. Chopped up a number of people

before they finally caught up to him.

MEAGAN

What happened to him then?

ERWIN

They killed him.

JESSE

How can you kill somebody who's

back from the grave?

ERWIN

Not very well apparently. Jason

keeps coming back to life and

chopping people up. It's a never

ending cycle of terror up here at

Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

MEAGAN

Why does he keep coming back to

life and killing people?

ERWIN

They say he's looking for revenge

on the camp counselor who murdered

him as a child. Jason just happens

to go about it in the socially

unacceptable way of hacking through

every teenager he finds until he

gets the right one.

(spots grave)

Here it is...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ERWIN

Look... the boogerman!

(laughs)

Get it?!

STORMIE

Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!

Ug! I thought I had seen the last

of those when my brother graduated

third grade!

ERWIN

We just dug up a rotting corpse and

you're worried about a little snot.

MEAGAN

I'm exhausted... wake me when we

get back home.

ERWIN

Uhhh... better not fall asleep --

we've still got a lot of work to

do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

STORMIE

Well, that means we've all got to

stay awake!

JESSE

Duh?!

MEAGAN

I know! We'll sing a song!

(starts singing)

Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down

the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,

merrily... life is but a dream. Come

on, everybody!

DISSOLVE TO:

MEAGAN

...merrily, merrily, merrily,

merrily... life is but a dream.

FREDDY

Shouldn't dream and drive.

FREDDY

(continuing)

Looks like the cat's out of the

bag now!

MEAGAN

It's Freddy!

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got

to get him to a doctor.

ERWIN

Don't worry... an ambulance is on

the way.

MEAGAN

Oh, God... Jesse...

ERWIN

Meagan... listen to me... The cops

are on their way. If they find me

and Jason Voorhees in the trunk

there, we're finished.

MEAGAN

Go... get out of here. Take Jason

and Stormie with you.

STORMIE

I'm staying with you.

ERWIN

I'll call you at the hospital.

STORMIE

How?

ERWIN

Somehow!

CUT TO:

MEAGAN

Is he going to be okay?

DOCTOR

Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.

His leg is broken in four places

and he has four broken ribs and a

concussion.

STORMIE

Hey doc, is there someplace I

could get us something to eat?

DOCTOR

I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.

There are some vending machines in

the lobby.

(to Meagan)

I'll be back to check on him in a

couple of hours.

STORMIE

I'll be right back... I'm goin' go

score us some munchies.

MEAGAN

Jesse!

FREDDY

(ala John Wayne)

Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare

ain't big enough for the two of

us... draw!

MEAGAN

Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

FREDDY

Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't

you just go get [BEEP]

MEAGAN

Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!

FREDDY

Go ahead... make my dream!

Freddy killed Jesse...

STORMIE

Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd

have seen a dead body before.

Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie

please pick up the white paging

This is Stormie...

MURDOCH

Did you see a couple of girls go

by here a moment ago?

STORMIE

Just missed 'em.

HOSPITAL OPERATOR

(filtered)

The message is from Erwin... he

says to meet him at the side

entrance in two minutes.

STORMIE

Where'd you get the truck?

ERWIN

Same place I've got Jason hid.

STORMIE

And where's that?

ERWIN

A place where no one ever goes.

CUT TO:

STORMIE

What'd you do -- take him for a

swim?

ERWIN

Almost.

ERWIN

(continuing)

Is she going to be alright?

STORMIE

I don't know. She's pretty fucked

up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

ERWIN

You're a strong woman.

STORMIE

What's that supposed to mean?

ERWIN

Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean

anything.

STORMIE

Is this him?

ERWIN

Yeah...

(whips back tarp)

Meet the new and improved Jason.

STORMIE

Why'd you put that stupid mask

on him?

ERWIN

Take a look...

STORMIE

Good idea.

ERWIN

Not exactly a beauty queen entry,

is he?

STORMIE

So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy

Osbourne song backwards or something?

ERWIN

I'm afraid it's not that simple...

STORMIE

I thought you said you knew how to

bring him back to life?

ERWIN

I do! But when I was putting him

back together, I noticed something

was missing.

STORMIE

Awwww, he won't be needing that...

I mean, what girl would let him

put his rotten ol'...

ERWIN

(cuts her off)

No-no! Not that! It's his heart...

it's missing.

STORMIE

Well... does it really matter?

Can't you use an aquarium pump or

something?

ERWIN

No... he has to have a heart. A

human heart. A good one.

MEAGAN

I know where we can get a heart...

A good one.

CUT TO:

ERWIN

That guard in there might pose a

problem.

MEAGAN

Do you think you and Stormie could

keep him occupied for a few minutes?

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Okay... let's do it.

STORMIE

Hey! Watch that!

ERWIN

I'm just trying to make it look real.

STORMIE

Just keep your hands above the bra,

pizza face.

MEAGAN

Forgive me, Jesse...

STORMIE

He's head right for her! Do some-

thing!

GUARD

Stop right there!

CUT TO:

CRAZY OL' COOT

They said they were writin' for

some newspaper...

MURDOCH

Teenagers are notorious liars.

CRAZY OL' COOT

Well, after I heard about the

accident on my police scanner, I

came up here to have a look. When

I found it I figured you'd want to

know right away.

MURDOCH

You did the right thing.

CRAZY OL' COOT

Damn kids... I just knew they were

comin' up here to do somethin'

stupid.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Just got a call on the radio --

three juveniles just broke into the

morgue -- one male, two female. The

guard is pretty sure the male is in

the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

CRAZY OL' COOT

Sounds like the same kids I saw.

MURDOCH

Did the guard say what they took?

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --

they carved his heart out.

(beat)

They got away in a pick-up -- the

guard didn't get the license. You

want me to put out an A.P.B.?

MURDOCH

No... that won't be necessary. I

know just where they're going, and

just what they're up to. And this

time... I'll be ready.

CUT TO:

STORMIE

You've got to quit blaming your-

self for what happened to Jesse...

it wasn't your fault.

MEAGAN

He didn't want to come with us...

but he did anyway. He did it for me.

STORMIE

I'm not sorry I came... I don't

think Jesse would be, either.

MEAGAN

I just can't believe he's dead. I

keep thinking he'll show up any

minute...

ERWIN

Well, that just about does it...

ERWIN

(continuing)

As you can see, I've excavated the

power cable that runs across the

bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut

away the insulation, exposing a

patch of cable right near the water's

edge.

ERWIN

(continuing)

Now when I kick this over, the water

will wash down the trench and bridge

an eletrical gap between the cable

and the lake. There's plenty of

voltage, so it should work.

STORMIE

So you kick the bucket and Jason

lives.

ERWIN

Yeah, right...

(then)

Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

JASON'S FATHER

Just what the hell do you think

JASON'S MOTHER

I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

JASON'S FATHER

You ain't sending him nowhere.

for that contingency.

STORMIE

Just don't stand there! Do something!

MEAGAN

Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!

Do you hear me? Get up!

ERWIN

Well... it's off now.

ERWIN

(continuing)

Hey! Come back! I've got him locked

up in the tool shed!

MEAGAN

Who are you calling?!

STORMIE

The cops! Who else?!

MEAGAN

Are you kidding?! They'll lock us

up and throw away the key!

STORMIE

Fine by me!

(clicks the receiver)

Damnit! It's dead!

ERWIN

He's right behind me!

STORMIE

(to Erwin)

You're the one who brought him

back to life!

ERWIN

And?!

STORMIE

Well, do something!

STORMIE

(continuing)

Oh, some hero!

MEAGAN

STOP!

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Now... just stop! We're the ones

that brought you back to life.

And you have no right to kill us

with that chainsaw! In fact... you

owe us...

STORMIE

That's right! She gave you her

boyfriend's heart, you know!

MEAGAN

That's right.

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Look! Here's his picture...

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Now, I know that you've been through

a lot. And I know that you're pissed

off about being murdered and all.

STORMIE

(interjects)

I know I would be!

MEAGAN

But if you help us kill Freddy

Krueger... I promise to help you

find the little bastard that

killed you. What do you say? Have

we got a deal?

MURDOCH

You in there! This is Captain Renton

Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am

Jason, you have to hide! Stay in

here and don't come out until we

tell you. Stormie... help me!

MURDOCH

(through bullhorn)

Alright... anybody else left in

there had better say their prayers!

ERWIN

There's no one else inside.

MURDOCH

Is that a fact?

(into bullhorn)

Okay... you had your chance!

COP

Hey, look!

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Holy Mary, mother of God... would

you look at the size of that guy?

MURDOCH

I knew it!

MURDOCH

(continuing)

Stand back! I'll handle this.

MURDOCH

You...

Let her go.

MURDOCH

That'll teach you to fuck with the

Getting something to eat might help.

Yo, Butch!

DEPUTY MILLER

It's Deputy Miller.

STORMIE

Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could

we have something to eat?

DEPUTY MILLER

I thought you psychos only ate

human hearts?

STORMIE

And I thought you pigs only ate

donuts.

DEPUTY MILLER

Don't make me come back there.

STORMIE

(low; to Meagan)

Cow! I hope she chokes on her three

combo-burrito cud!

MEAGAN

What am I going to do? I'll never

be able to find Lizzy now.

STORMIE

You should be worrying about your-

self... I know I am.

MEAGAN

I bet you're sorry you came with

me now...

STORMIE

Nah... what are best friends for?

Afterall, you stuck by me through

all my crazy phases, I figure I

owe you one big crazy phase, right?

MEAGAN

That's for being my best friend,

Stormie.

DEPUTY MILLER

Come on, Meagan.

MEAGAN

Where are we going?

DEPUTY MILLER

Your parents are here.

MEAGAN'S MOM

Oh, Meagan... are you alright?

Let me look at you...

MEAGAN

I'm okay, mom.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Your mother's been worried sick,

Meagan. So have I.

MEAGAN

Sorry. Today has been a bitch.

STORMIE

Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

STORMIE

(continuing)

Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

FREDDY

You know what they say... when you

sleep -- you die!

MEAGAN'S MOM

Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said

you helped one of those cultists

escape from a hospital?

MEAGAN

A mental hospital.

MEAGAN'S MOM

And he said you desecrated a cemetery

and some other really terrible things.

Tell me you had nothing to do with

it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

MEAGAN

There's no mistake.

(to Murdoch)

What did you do with Erwin?

MURDOCH

Your boyfriend is headed back to the

looney bin where he belongs. But

don't worry, you'll be seeing him

soon enough... at the arraignment.

STORMIE

You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks

to my various phases and many hours

of watching violent televison, I

have become immune to violence. Seen

it all and done it all! Nothing you

do can gross me out -- so why don't

you give it your best shot, bitch!

FREDDY

Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

STORMIE

I'm warning you, Freddy... my father

is a drill sergeant in the Marine

Corps and he taught me just how to

defend myself against slimy bastards

like you.

FREDDY

Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!

Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!

I dare you!

MEAGAN

We're wasting time! We've got to

close down all the churches --

Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy

ground!

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Don't you understand?! He has to

come to our reality to do it! It's

our last chance to kill him!

MURDOCH

Okay, I think we've heard enough of

this crap. Take her back to the

lockup.

MEAGAN

Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!

I have to save Lizzy!

MEAGAN'S MOM

Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't

even realize what you've done.

MEAGAN

I did what I had to do to try and

save Lizzy!

MURDOCH

Yeah, including murdering your boy-

friend and cutting his heart out.

MEAGAN

Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was

already dead when I cut his heart

out!

MEAGAN

(continuing; manic)

Goddamnit, you don't understand!

Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

MURDOCH

I know how you must feel... I had

a dog once. I loved that dog. I

treated her like my own daughter.

We went camping, picnics in the

park... I even had a little stocking

for her nailed up on the mantle for

Christmas. Then one day, she bit

me... so I had to blow her brains

out.

(sighs)

God, I loved that dog.

MEAGAN

Yes... I want you.

HEAD BITCH

Prove it.

HEAD BITCH

(continuing)

Now that's more like it!

(to the others)

Hey, this bitch is alright!

HEAD BITCH

(continuing)

You're okay, honey... what's your

name?

MEAGAN

Meagan.

HEAD BITCH

So... what're you in for, Meagan?

MEAGAN

(sniffles a little)

Oh, my friend...

HEAD BITCH

The bitch that died last night?

MEAGAN

(starts to cry)

Yeah... they said she had some

disease that made her... explode!

Oh, God! Please hold me!

BITCH #1

What's this bullshit about some

killer funk make you explode?

HEAD BITCH

(to Meagan)

Easy... honey. It's goin' be

alright. But what I asked you is

why you're in here?

MEAGAN

Oh... well... the cops? Well, they

think I gave it to her...

DEPUTY

What the hell is all the screaming

about?!

MURDOCH

Punks...

JUNIOR TROOPER

Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

CUT TO:

REVEREND LOVEJOY

I won't do it! It's a sin!

Blasphemy!

CULTIST

Wedding or funeral... your choice.

REVEREND LOVEJOY

And who would be the bride?

LIZZY

One... two... Freddy's coming for

you.

LIZZY

(continuing)

Three... four... Better lock your

door.

REVEREND LOVEJOY

And the groom.

CULTIST

He's coming...

LIZZY

Five... six... grab your crucifix...

FREDDY

That's for the lift sister!

(to the cultists)

Hiya, kids!

CULTISTS

(in unison)

Hiya, Freddy!

FREDDY

Ready to get hitched?

CULTISTS

Ready, Freddy!

FREDDY

Then let's do it!

LIZZY

I love you, Freddy...

CUT TO:

DEPUTY

We found your patrol car, Captain.

It was abandoned near a local

religious station.

MURDOCH

Religious station? Is there a

padre there?

DEPUTY

Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-

casts out of that location.

MURDOCH

So that's where they're hiding.

CUT TO:

REVEREND LOVEJOY

...and if there be anyone among you

who has any reason why these two

should not be joined in holy...

REVEREND LOVEJOY

(continuing)

...in matrimony. Let them speak

now...

(under his breath)

...please God...

(aloud)

...or forever hold their peace.

MEAGAN

Stop!

MEAGAN

(continuing;

to Freddy)

Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

FREDDY

You're a virgin?!

MEAGAN

Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

FREDDY

Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier

than your retard sister... okay,

you've got the job.

(to cultists)

Get her ready.

MURDOCH

(through bullhorn)

This is Captain Renton Murdoch --

State Trooper. I'm giving you until

the count of three to come out with

your hands up...

MURDOCH

(continuing)

Hand me that flare pistol.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Good idea. Throw a little light on

them -- see if we can spot their

firing positions...

MURDOCH

(through bullhorn)

Alright, now I'm through playing

"nice guy" -- I want the rest of

you punks to come out right now

with your hands up.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Well, it doesn't look like they're

going to surrender.

MURDOCH

What we're going to need then is

somebody to charge their lines --

make a hole for us to slip in.

S.W.A.T. COMMANDER

Where are you going to find anyone

that crazy?

MURDOCH

Here comes one now...

(yells)

GO GIT 'EM, SON!

ERWIN

That was easy enough...

REVEREND LOVEJOY

Once again... if there be anyone

among you who does not want these

two people to be joined... let him

speak now or forever hold his peace.

FREDDY

Uh, oh...

ERWIN

I can't wake them up. Freddy's

got them trapped!

ERWIN

(continuing)

Go get him, boy!

TED BUNDY

(into microphone)

Ladies and gentlemen... welcome

to the fight of the century! I'm

your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

TED BUNDY

(continuing)

Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

OSWALD

(angry; defensive)

It wasn't me!

TED BUNDY

In my left corner, weighing in at

only ninety seven pounds... the

nightmare master himself! The one!

The only... Freddddddddy

Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

TED BUNDY

(continuing)

And on my right... weighing in at

a whopping four hundred and thir-

teen pounds... that killer of

countless teenagers... the big

(gestures to Jason)

Jason Voorhees!

TED BUNDY

(continuing)

And the prize tonight... not one but

TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...

ripe for the picking.

TED BUNDY

(continuing)

Hey, have one now and save the other

for the ride home. That's what I did.

MEAGAN

Kick his ass, Jason!

BLOODY MARY

HEY!

FREDDY

Oh, well... I just axed for that!

HITLER

Peasants...

HUMAN HEAD

That's it, kiddo! You're really

giving it to him out there! Use the

left more -- jab! Make him hurt!

That's the ticket to a knockout!

MEAGAN

Jason! Get up! Get up!

MEAGAN

(continuing)

Jason! You've got to get up!

FLASH CUT TO:

HARD CUT TO:

FREDDY

Oh, shit!

MURDOCH

Now's my chance... give me sixty

seconds to get in there then move

in.

MEAGAN

What took you so long?!

ERWIN

What ever you do... don't let this

guy drive.

MEAGAN

I knew you would come...

ERWIN

Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

ERWIN

(continuing)

He's going for the satellite dish!

If he uplinks with a communications

satellite he can beam himself any-

where in the world! We'll never be

rid of him!

ERWIN

No! Wait!

MEAGAN

Erwin? Erwin?!

MURDOCH

He's dead... and so are you if you

don't put your hands up right now!

MURDOCH

(continuing)

It's time I taught you girls some

respect for the law!

MURDOCH

(continuing)

So... you wanna be a punk?

MURDOCH

(continuing)

Then die like a punk!

MEAGAN

NO!

DISSOLVE TO:

LIZZY

You forgot to check under the bed.

MEAGAN

No monsters here.

LIZZY

But what if they come back?

MEAGAN

Then we'll just have to kick their

ass again.

LIZZY

I love you, Meagan.

MEAGAN

I love you too. Go to sleep.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Meagan?

MEAGAN

Yes, dad?

MEAGAN'S DAD

Your mom and I... well, we want to

thank you for saving your sister's

life... we know you went through

a lot.

MEAGAN'S MOM

We're going to be there for you

from now on... for both of you!

And that nice lawyer we hired for

you said he thinks he can get all

the charges dropped... except maybe

for the grave robbing and human

desecration ones.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Everything is going to be fine.

MEAGAN

I know...

MEAGAN'S MOM

And I'm going to get sober...

MEAGAN'S DAD

We're going to be a normal, happy

family again.

MEAGAN

I know...

MEAGAN'S MOM

Goodnight, sweetheart.

MEAGAN

Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

MEAGAN'S DAD

Goodnight, Meagan.

MEAGAN

Hello?

FREDDY

(filtered)

I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

MEAGAN

(sighs)

I know...

BLACKNESS:

CUT TO:

MONSTER

I don't think they're coming back.

TED BUNDY

Okay, folks... show's over. Every-

body can go home now.

CUT TO:

THE END
