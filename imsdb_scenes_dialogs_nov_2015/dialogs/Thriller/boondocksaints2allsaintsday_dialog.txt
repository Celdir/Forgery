ALL SAINTS DAY

MAN V.O.

There's two kinds of people in this

world when you boil it all down. You

got your talkers and you got your

doers.

ROCCO V.O.

Most people are just talkers. All they

got is talk. But when all's said and

done, it is the doers who change the

world. And when they do that, they

change us. That's why we never forget

them...So, which one are you? Do you

just talk about it? Or do you stand up

and do something about it? Because

believe you me all the rest of it is

just coffee house bullshit.

MURPHY

Looks like a storm's comin'.

CONNOR

Aye.

POPPA M V.O.

Peace, they say, is the enemy of

memory. So it had been for my boys.

2.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

For some time now, their past had felt

like a dream to them...faded and worn.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

And then suddenly, as if not a day had

passed...it was back. I could see it

in their eyes.

POPPA M V.O.

I could feel it, heavy in their

presence. Something calling them back.

3.

POPPA M V.O.

"And they cried out, How long O'Lord

dost thou not judge and revenge our

blood upon them that dwell on the

earth?"

POPPA M V.O.

And God said, "All will fear the wrath

of the lamb. For the great day of

their reckoning hath come."

POPPA M

"And they that holdest my name shall

come with the shaking of the earth and

the roiling of the oceans."

SIBEAL

Something's happened.

4.

REPORTER #1

There is no new information on the

victim found slain this morning inside

Trinity Church. As you can see the

size of the crowd here has increased

substantially over the last couple of

hours. People are demanding answers as

to how a priest could be murdered in a

church. But perhaps more shocking, we

have confirmed that the body was

ritualized with pennies in the eyes.

Many remember this as the grisly

calling card of the prolific vigilante

killers known as the Saints, who went

on a murder spree here in Boston.

REPORTER #1 V.O.

A rampage that ended six years ago,

when the Saints brazenly walked into

open court...

REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)

...and executed Mafia Don, Poppa Joe

Yakavetta before a courtroom of

terrified witnesses, then simply

disappeared without a trace.

REPORTER #1 V.O. (CONT'D)

The now legendary security camera

footage from that harrowing day, our

singular tiny glimpse of these infamous

and controversial killers.

REPORTER #1

As police have yet to confirm the

Saints' possible involvement, the

ominous question hangs heavy in the

air. "Are they back?"

5.

MURPHY

The priest.    Did they release his name?

SIBEAL

No. But I made a few calls, still got

some friends in the diocese there.

McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

SIBEAL (CONT'D)

You knew him?

CONNOR

Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular

Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup

kitchens. Even made it into the

newspapers sometimes.

SIBEAL

Listen boys. I think it's best that ya

just stay put and we'll try ta figure

out what...

6.

DUFFY

We need to keep our heads, here.   It's

probably not even them.

DOLLY

Of course it ain't them but that

doesn't really matter, does it. Our

skeletons just came screaming out of

the closet. We're fucked.

DUFFY

We're not fucked.

GREENLY

We are totally fucked!

GREENLY

...and not just fucked, like elephant

dick, pounded in the ass, no reach

around, jungle fucked!

DUFFY

Now's not the time to panic, Green

beans!

GREENLY

Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time

to panic. We're all Accessories to...

DOLLY

Don't you fucking say it!

OFFICER #1

Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.

7.

DOLLY

I didn't even know he had a protege.

What is this bullshit?

DUFFY

Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years

old. Smecker plucked her right out of

class at Quantico.

GREENLY

Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.

This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.

DUFFY

She was assigned to OCD two years back.

She can shoot a gun, set three course

records during her training.

GREENLY

Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-

be. We gotta get rid of her.

DUFFY

She is also an authority on the Saints

case. Which means Smecker must have

walked her through it.

DOLLY

And the hits just keep on comin'.

8.

POPPA M

Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just

slow 'em down.

SIBEAL

Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk

them out of this?

SIBEAL (CONT'D)

We don't even know what this is yet!

Somebody could just be tryin' ta get

away with murder here!

POPPA M

Aye. Only there's about a thousand

easier ways ta do that. Trust me.

Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya

kill a priest in a church and make it

look like they did it. Bring 'em back

with a vengeance. Don't know who.

Don't know why. But someone thinks

he's real fuckin' clever. Only one

problem with his little plan.

SIBEAL

What's dat?

POPPA M

It worked.

SIBEAL

Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't

know and if you're won't at least try

ta talk some sense into them, I will!

SIBEAL (CONT'D)

Exactly what do you intend to do?

9.

MURPHY

Every last motherfucker that had

anything to do with it.

DOLLY

Game time.   How are we playing this?

DUFFY

Feds love to pull the divide and

conquer routine. We hard line her.

Stick together on this. Agreed?

DOLLY

Agreed.   We're a brick wall.

GREENLY

Let's rock this bitch.

EUNICE

(POINTING)

You hafta be Detectives Dolly and

Duffy. Am I right?

(extending hand)

Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

And you must be Greenly. Smecker

always said you were the funny one.

GREENLY

T'sup...I mean, what? Yeah, well,

funny as in ha ha, though not like

funny as in gay cuz...I'm not...played

high school football.

10.

DOLLY

Look, with all due respect, Agent

Bloom...

EUNICE

Special.

DOLLY

Excuse me?

EUNICE

You see there's a "special" before my

"agent." If we are going to address

each other formally, I'd prefer if you

popped it in there. Makes me feel, I

don't know...special. Of course, I'd

hoped we could be a little more

personable. In fact, I'd like you to

call me Eunice.

DUFFY

O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the

fuck the Fed is...

EUNICE

Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a

"fuck" situation, is it? I can see a

"God Damn" or two but why skip all the

way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's

start slow and work our way up to it.

DUFFY

What is the Fed's interest in this?

EUNICE

Their interest, Detective, is capturing

the men responsible for the murders of

22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see

public perception is that these boys

stepped in, did our jobs for us and

then disappeared into thin air as we

fecklessly searched for them. The FBI

tends to take exception to such things.

They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.

Why do you think that is?

(BEAT)

Well, since we've broken the "Fuck

Barrier," allow me to be blunt.

(MORE)

11.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

It is because I am so fucking smart

that I make smart people feel like

retards. Now, we seem to be getting

off on the wrong foot here. I'd

appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's

chalk it up to paying respect to the

memory of a dearly departed mutual

friend. A man who taught me everything

I know.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Lovely.

(re: crowd)

Now what's with the circus?

DUFFY

The victim was killed late last night.

When people gathered for morning mass,

they found the front entrance chained

and padlocked. A locksmith came out,

cut the chain and surprise, surprise.

Cell phones. Half of them called the

cops. Half of them called the media.

But regardless...word's out.

EUNICE

And it looks like that's just the way

somebody wanted it. What say we scrape

the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?

Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto

the crime scene?

GREENLY

What?   No, yeah, no.   Of course.

GREENLY (CONT'D)

Do you want a cup of coffee or

something?

EUNICE

Never touch the stuff.

12.

EUNICE

It wasn't them...but I'm sure you boys

already knew that.

DUFFY

The two "V's." The victim and venue

don't add up.

EUNICE

Let's go with the venue first. Our

perpetrators are devout. They would

never commit such an act on sacred

ground. And as for the victim?

DOLLY

All their vics were criminals. Clearly

not the case here. So, it wasn't them

which means this is a local matter and

it falls under our jurisdiction. No

need for Federal involvement so with

all due respect...we'll see you later,

Special Agent Bloom.

EUNICE

Man, I hate it when people say that.

"With all due respect." Because it is

inevitably followed by a disrespectful

remark. I'll give you an example.

With all due respect, Detective, this

matter falls under whatever

jurisdiction I fuckin' say it does.

DUFFY

Uh, so...let's just...what can you tell

us about the shooters?

13.

EUNICE

Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell

you that he is left handed and how

shall I put this delicately...? He's a

short bastard.

DOLLY

(FACETIOUS)

One guy, lefty, short.   Got it.

EUNICE

I'll show you what I'm talking about.

EUNICE

Detective Greenly, you're the victim.

GREENLY

David.   You can call me David.

EUNICE

Very well, David.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

The Saints' signature stance. Copley

Plaza Hotel four years ago. Two men of

identical height put Yuri Petrova on

his knees and each dropped iron to the

back of his head.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Eyes front, David. The position of the

victim and the angles produced by the

killers' stance created a unique

scenario. The bullets criss crossed in

the skull and exited the eye sockets.

Here, this did not occur. The rounds

moved on a straight trajectory through

the back of the victim's head and out

the front. Which happens when...

14.

DUFFY

...one guy's holding two guns to the

back of your head.

EUNICE

One guy.

EUNICE

Now, the victim falls forward.   If you

please, David.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

The killer approached the body from the

left side...

(Eunice approaches)

...and flipped him to the right.

DUFFY

Left handed.

EUNICE

Yep, southpaw.

DOLLY

But you said he was wicked short.

EUNICE

The Saints were later determined to be

five foot eleven inches tall. It's

just dumb luck that the Russian and

McKinney are the exact same height.

15.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

The rounds exited Petrova's eye balls.

Here they came out the lower cheek.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Three, four inches below the eyes.

DOLLY

That puts him at five, seven-ish.

That's not uncommonly short.

EUNICE

The killer posed as a late night

confessor. Once the victim entered the

booth the killer had him isolated. No

escape. Short stuff exits his

confessional and kicks in the door of

the priest's chamber...

EUNICE V.O.

...leaving a crescent shaped

indentation which indicates that this

cowboy was wearing a boot with a

pronounced heel.

EUNICE

Gave him a couple inches. We're

looking at about five foot five,

gentlemen.

GREENLY

That's wicked short.

EUNICE

Wicked.

16.

DECK HAND

They're brawling in the hold!    Better

get your bets in now!

CONNOR

Why are his hands chained?

MEXICAN SEAMAN

Romeo's fast, man. He says the

Frenchman can't lay a hand on him.

MURPHY

But he can't hit him back.

MEXICAN SEAMAN

That's the bet. He's got to last five

minutes.

MURPHY

(to Connor, English)

This guy's fuckin' crazy.

BOTH

Fifty on the Mexican.

ROMEO

You should never fight a Mexican,

Frenchy. Pound for pound, the toughest

mother fuckers on earth. Know why? We

like pain. We like it, Pierre. I mean

think about it, "tabasco sauce." What

kinda fucked up people would even

invent that shit?

17.

ROMEO (CONT'D)

Don't be scared. Remember, I can't hit

you. I ain't gonna hit ya.

(avoiding blows)

Ain't gonna hit ya. Ain't gonna...

ROMEO (CONT'D)

Ooooo.    Found the loophole, bitch!

ROMEO (CONT'D)

Aughtta be a lawyer! Got the 'fine

print on y'ass! Pursuant to! Pro

bono! Pari Pasu! I'll knock you out

on contingency, mother fucker.

ROMEO

Oh, shit.   FIRE! FIRE!

ROUGHNECK #1

Out of zee way!

ROMEO

Whoa!    Uh, merci, uh, si vous plait.

MURPHY

Just protectin' our investment.   Ya

made us fifty bucks.

18.

ROMEO

Oh, thank, God. Irish, huh?   Finally

some class. I'm Romeo.

CONNOR

(shaking hands)

Connor.

MURPHY

Murphy.   Why were you yellin' "fire"?

ROMEO

I heard you were supposed to on t.v.

CONNOR

That's if you're gettin' raped.

ROMEO

Oh...I'd be more inclined to go with

something like, "THAT DOESN'T GO THERE,

MAN!"

ROMEO (CONT'D)

We saved your entire fucking country in

World War Two! Gee...thanks for the

statue!

BOTH

Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus?

(SUBTITLES)

Who dares trespass in the house of God?

RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O.

People are still in shock as Father

McKinney was a beloved local cleric.

(MORE)

19.

RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. (CONT'D)

His selfless contributions to the

community too numerous to list. In

related news, second generation crime

boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not

commented on whether he fears for his

own safety.

BOTH

Yakavetta?

CONCEZIO

So, there it is. I want everyone to

feel free to share their thoughts.

CAPO #1

I can't believe none of us were

consulted on this! The disrespect!

We'd have never okay'd such a thing!   A

priest! It's an infamita!

CAPO #2

Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ

fucking sakes?!

CAPO #3

And just for simple revenge?! There's

no business in it! You've put us all

at risk here! The cops could be all

over us!

CAPO #4

Forget the cops! What about these

Saints fuckers?! These guys were long

gone! And now you're trying to bring

the devil right back to our doorstep?!

20.

CONCEZIO

Six years ago, with the backing of an

adoring public, these vigilante fucks

put my father on his knees and executed

him...in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood

relative and benefactor to all of you.

Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder

remains un-revenged...

CONCEZIO (CONT'D)

This too, is infamita. These homicidal

maniacs nearly wiped this family out.

It's taken a lot of time to build

ourselves up again, brick by brick.

And now that we've re-acquiesced our

original power, can we really afford to

have these guys pop out of the woodwork

someday and try to finish the job when

we least expect it? Now, for those of

you who have forgotten, let's recap.

These fuckers walk into rooms full of

gangsters...

(denotes surroundings)

Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill

everyone...and leave.

CONCEZIO (CONT'D)

You think I don't know that each one of

you's been waking up in night sweats

over this the last couple years? These

sons of bitches prison fucked us with

no lube, wiped their dicks on our

drapes and walked away! And we been

living in silent fear ever since. Oh,

we don't talk about it. Rape victims

often don't. But it's there. Knowing

they're still out there, somewhere.

Thinking...what if?

CAPO #4

Concezio is right. Pretending you

don't got a problem don't solve

nothing.

21.

CONCEZIO

Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take

a moment to look at the serendiplious,

diperous, serendip...

(FRUSTRATION)

...type situation we find ourselves in

here. There's a good chance they'll

show. No catching us with our pants

down this time. We can deal with them

proactivitously. The cops were

embarrassed by these guys too. With a

second bite at the apple, they got

every reason in the world to crank up

the heat. And as for their doting

public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose

a few fans.

CONNOR

The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us,

he's fuckin' got us.

MURPHY

But why would he do something so

public?

CONNOR

Think about it. People figure we did

it. Makes it more likely someone will

drop a dime. Way easier to get to us

in prison, isn't it, now.

MURPHY

But how would anyone recognize us?

CONNOR

You don't remember those sketches on

the news channel?

22.

MURPHY

Shit. That's right. Y'know, every

time they show those composites on TV

and then they catch the guy, it looks

nothin' like him. But ours?

CONNOR

Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin'

Divinci as a sketch artist.

MURPHY

Maybe we should dye our hair.

CONNOR

What?

MURPHY

Yeah. These guys are always dyin'

their hair. You know, like in "The

Fugitive." It's covert and shit.

Connor smirks privately.

CONNOR

What color would you dye it?

MURPHY

I don't know...lighter, I guess.

CONNOR

Y'mean...blonde?

MURPHY

I didn't say that!

CONNOR

California, surfer boy, gay, gay

blonde?!

MURPHY

I'm warnin' ya!

CONNOR

Just keep your hands off my ass back

there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy."

MURPHY

Fuck you!

23.

CONNOR

AAAAAH!

CONNOR (CONT'D)

You motherfucker!

MURPHY

Serves ya right!

ROMEO

Oh, shit.

ROMEO (CONT'D)

I know who you are. You guys are the

fuckin'....

MURPHY

SHUT IT!

ROMEO

Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I'm

from Boston. I love you guys. Shit,

everybody does! I mean, holy fucking

shit! Maybe I could get in on this,

you know? Bring some La Raza ta this

thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is

it true you guys say a prayer before

you grease somebody?

CONNOR

And an awesome wailing was heard

throughout heaven...

24.

MURPHY

...as the terrible hand of the Lord

struck upon the earth.

CONNOR

And as Almighty God created you...he

now calleth you home.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

Ooops. Busy signal. We'll hafta

calleth back.

MURPHY

Let's have a shot while we're waitin'.

ROMEO

That shit was NOT funny, man!

ROMEO (CONT'D)

Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I

greased my drawers.

CONNOR

No.

ROMEO

But I got conex all over Bean Town.

Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!

MURPHY

No.

ROMEO

Why not?!

MURPHY

We don't hafta give you reasons.

Forget it.

ROMEO

It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it!

25.

CONNOR

How dare you, sir, insinuate such a

thing? The fact that you're a greasy

spic's got nothin' ta do with it.

ROMEO

I'm gonna let you have that one. Look.

I can do this. It's not rocket

science. You two find bad guys doing

bad shit and you kill them, right?

CONNOR

It's not that simple.

MURPHY

Yes it is.

CONNOR

S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we

were a little more artistic than that.

ROMEO

Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see

it? This shit's fate, man. Like

preordained type shit. Mea fucking

Culpa! Why do you think you just

happened to be in that hatchway today?

MURPHY

Oh, don't start gettin' all super

fuckin' natural on us. We saw those

guys goin' in there!

ROMEO

Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's

because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!

CONNOR

Oh, no.

ROMEO

Fine. Then what exactly do you intend

to do when you hit U.S. soil?

CONNOR

We'll go after all Yakavetta's people

and operations till we get to the man

himself.

MURPHY

Yeah, work our way up the food chain.

26.

ROMEO

So, what's your first gig?    What's the

first thing you gonna do?

CONNOR

Well, I don't suppose we have a

succinct plan, y'know, per se.

MURPHY

Yeah. It's not fully developed yet,

y'know, as it were.

ROMEO

You two need to chill in the green

room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let

your manager handle the details. And

you better get my Cub Scout badge

ready. Cuz if you want to kick

Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know

you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in

the hole for you.

HOT DOG VENDOR

These guys have gone "mad dog" here.

They need to be put down.

CAB DRIVER

I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd

have stayed gone.

PEDESTRIAN

I don't believe it for a second!   No

bleep-in way the Saints did it!

EUNICE

And that's all she wrote. Everything

points in the same direction.

27.

CHIEF

Why would Yakavetta want them back

here? Him of all people.

DUFFY

To have them executed. Revenge.

Oldest motive in the book.

GREENLY

The Saints killed his daddy six years

ago, right? He was inside when that

happened doing a nickel for extortion.

DOLLY

Yeah. From inside he could only do so

much. Since he got out nine months

ago, the Yakavetta's have regained

their original strength. Looks like

their clearing all their open accounts.

CHIEF

Well...it's a theory.

EUNICE

More than just a theory, Chief.

DUFFY

C.I.'s came back. Cold hits all

around. Concezio Yakavetta and his six

Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have

disappeared.

CHIEF

So?

GREENLY

So, it fits. He's gone to the

mattresses with his top brass. He's

protecting them till this is over.

EUNICE

And word's been put to all his

lieutenants that the Saints are to be

taken out, on sight.

DOLLY

That means his resources on the streets

are battening down the hatches, waiting

for them to show.

28.

CHIEF

Look, I been stone walling the media on

this thing but the Mayor's been riding

me like a rented mule here. I got half

of New England thinking the Saints

whacked a priest and the other half

thinking their innocent. Its a powder

keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics

games, here. I could clear them of

this murder, take the piss right out of

this thing, keep the peace in the

Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason

why I shouldn't go public right now.

EUNICE

Walk with me, Chief.    Let's talk.

DUFFY

This is not good.   She's gunning for

the boys hard.

DOLLY

This brawd, trying to put a feather in

her cap is gonna get us locked up.

DUFFY

Just calm down.

GREENLY

And you know they'll send us to the

Hoag. We put half those deranged sex

freaks in there. I hope you guys like

cock sandwiches. Cuz we'll be eating

them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

EUNICE

I understand you got a job to do,

Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs

that we're onto him, he puts a bullet

in Napoleon's head, plants him at the

bottom of the ocean and walks. This

pint sized killer is the only thing

that puts Yakavetta right in the middle

of this. It is imperative that we find

this man.

29.

DUFFY

We need to figure what we're gonna do

when the boys show and start doin' what

they do best. Cuz that's when the

shit's really gonna hit the fan.

DOLLY

That's another thing. Everyone's

assuming that they're going to come

back. I mean, we got no way of knowing

that for sure.

GREENLY

(ray of hope)

Yeah. That could totally happen.    They

could not come back.

DUFFY

What dream world did you two just slip

into?!

DUFFY (CONT'D)

Point blank! We know the boys. Is

there any part of you that thinks

they're are just going to let this

slide? Believe this. They are either

on their way...or they're already here.

ROMEO

It's been all over the papers the last

two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the

Chinese. They're using international

shipping routes to smuggle it in. This

is Little Yaka's shit.

30.

CONNOR

Let's follow 'em down the rabbit hole,

Alice.

MURPHY

You just scored a few points, Rome.

ROMEO

Well, dust off my "Members Only"

jacket.

(pulls set of keys)

Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!

MURPHY

I thought you said your car was

inconspicuous.

ROMEO

I don't like words that got 'spic'

right in the middle. Besides, it

is...where I live.

MURPHY

Where's that? Pimpville?

ROMEO

Hey! I hail from a colorful people.

Besides, you wouldn't know style if it

pitched a tent in your ass!

(looks into rear view)

What do you think of the ride, Conman?

CONNOR

The only way I could be more

embarrassed right now is if I was

ridin' a moped.

MURPHY

Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl.

CONNOR

Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my

high school reunion.

31.

ROMEO

All right!   I get the fucking point!

CONNOR

O'kay, here's the plan.

CONNOR

We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of

Irish. We're home in time for tacos.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

What?

MURPHY

Well, it's...uh...you know, it's...

32.

ROMEO

It's genius. I can even drive an F-

lift, man. Got my class "D" license

and everything.

CONNOR

Now, dat's the spirit.

ROMEO

I need a gun.

CONNOR AND MURPHY

Forget it.

ROMEO

What the fuck? I'm in on this shit,

man! I'm working here!

CONNOR

You can consider yourself a fuckin'

pledge until we say different.

ROMEO

Can I consider myself your girlfriend,

too?

CONNOR

That's what you get.   Is there a

problem?

ROMEO

(beat, fuming)

It's fine.

MURPHY

Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this

builds character.

ROMEO

Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

MURPHY

Now, dat's just unprofessional.

33.

MURPHY (CONT'D)

What do we think?

CONNOR

I think Yakavetta murdered a good man

just to send us a message.

MURPHY

Well...let's send him one back.

DOLLY

(re: Greenly)

Why?

DUFFY

I don't know.

CHIEF

Your boss, John Kuntsler called. Tells

me you got a problem with authority.

EUNICE

Absolute horse pucky, Chief.

Unfortunately, authority's developed a

problem with me.

CHIEF

And what's that?

EUNICE

Well, y'see, I am currently in

possession of a vagina.

34.

CHIEF

Oh, Jeez, that's not...

EUNICE

So you spoke to Kuntsler.      Anything

else.

CHIEF

If it's confirmed that the Saints are

back and too many bodies start showing

up with pocket change...

(re: his eyes)

...he's gonna pull you and step in.

EUNICE

Message delivered, Chief.

CHIEF

Listen.    I'll fend him off.    Just work

fast.

GREENLY

It's not them.

EUNICE

It's them.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

A wise man once told me. Where a man's

actions are firmly bound to an

unshakable faith one's worst nightmares

become sudden, terrifying reality.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Y'can almost smell the brimstone,

can'tcha?

DOLLY

What do you think happened here?

35.

EUNICE

Oh, this was a plan that fell to

pieces. A lot here doesn't make sense

which is why it makes perfect sense. I

believe things in our fair little city

just got downright biblical.

DOCK WORKER

You didn't have to bash me in the

skull.

ROMEO

Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here.

Technically, I was supposed to knock

you out.

DOCK WORKER

Christ! You got a gun. You could have

just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!

CONNOR

SCRAM!

DOCK WORKER

You got it!

ROMEO

So, let's not let this one, small

incident get in the way of...

CONNOR

Shut up and get behind the fuckin'

wheel!

MURPHY

Well, at least the plan is off to a

winning start.

CONNOR

Go fuck y'rself.

36.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

It's heroin.

MURPHY

How the fuck would you know?

CONNOR

Fuck you.    I know shit.

MURPHY

Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?!

CONNOR

He can't see where he's goin'!

MURPHY

Shit!    Tell him to go left, now!

CONNOR

Go left!    Go left!

ROMEO

What?!

MURPHY

I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk

me into this! This is a stupid plan!

CONNOR

I didn't notice you throwin' out any

ideas, ya creative asshole!

MURPHY

Fuck you!

37.

ROMEO

Hey!   What's goin' on in there?!

MURPHY

Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!

CONNOR

BRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES!

BROTHERS

And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my

Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended

forth from Thy hand, that our feet may

swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we

shall flow a river forth to Thee and

teeming with souls shall it ever be.

(MORE)

38.

BROTHERS (CONT'D)

In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus

Sancti.

DOLLY

Just got a call from my best snitch.

Never steered me wrong. He says its

this guy.

(hands Eunice mug)

"Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's

trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not

blood. He's been left control of the

streets. He's running all of it.

GREENLY

They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes

his silk suits and jewelry. He's even

got the 'out of season' fake bake going

on, a real peacock, this guy.

EUNICE

Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown.

DUFFY

Ballistics just dug it out.

EUNICE

A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me.

That's like bringing a knife to a

gunfight.

GREENLY

Yeah, or like bringing a really small

gun...to a gunfight.

39.

DUFFY

I don't know. Ballistics is reading

three shooters. This is one of them.

EUNICE

Well, I'm having a hard time believing

that one of the three most lethal

individuals on the planet just switched

over to bird shot.

DOLLY

Maybe we're reading it wrong. The

priest was a frame job, right?

DUFFY

Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to

eliminate some competition here.

EUNICE

No, sir. It's them. But we just might

have ourselves a change in the line up,

here.

GREENLY

Fine, they're back.   What's the plan?

EUNICE

Hell, we've just been called up to the

big show. We are tracking multiple

perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We

keep our ear to the ground and try to

figure out where Yakavetta's hiding.

Napoleon. We find him and flip him.

And as for the Saints...I'm gonna have

me a face to face with these boys one

way or the other.

DOLLY

Holy...fucking...shit.

40.

REPORTER #3

Law enforcement has confirmed the

Saints are back!

REPORTER #1 V.O.

It's confirmed. The five drug

traffickers all involved in the heroin

trade were victims of the Saints.

REPORTER #2 V.O.

...several having close ties to the

Yakavetta Crime Family, confirming the

long suspected merger of the Chinese

Triad and the Mafia.

DOC

BOYS!

DOC (CONT'D)

Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I saw da nuh,

nuh, news channel. Are ya boys all

right?!

CONNOR

Sound as an Irish pound, Doc.

MURPHY

Is it too late for a shot?

DOC

Oh, the Lord told me you'd be comin!

He said, "Doc, they're comin" and I was

ta get everting ready. So I did.

Everting's ruh, ruh, ruh, it's all set.

41.

ROMEO

Uh, hem!

MURPHY

Oh, this is our Mexican.

DOC

(shaking hands)

How are ya, lad? They call

me...FUCK!...ASS!

ROMEO

Nice to meet you, Fuck Ass, I'm Romeo.

THE BROTHERS

Holy shit.

DOC

The place used ta be an old speak easy

in the forties. I only use it for

storage, now.

ROMEO

This is so fucking cool.

DOC

Nobody even knows it's up here. You'll

be safe.

(POINTS)

You can get in and out the fu-fu-fire

escape.

ROMEO

You know what this is? This is our

hide out, man! We got a hide out!

CONNOR

What are you, fucking five years old?

MURPHY

Hey, Rome, we got sheets and

broomsticks. You could build yourself

a fort.

42.

ROMEO

Fuck the both of you!

DOC

(CONCENTRATION)

Not this time, ya little shit.

CONNOR

We'll see, old man.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

Would somebody please come over here

and...

DOC

FUCK!

CONNOR

...me up the...

DOC

ASS!

43.

GEORGE

Oh, yeah.     Someone's been eating their

Wheaties.     Yeah, get after it, girl.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

AAAAAH!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

WHAT THE FUCK!?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You fucking bitch!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

EUNICE

What did you just call me?

GEORGE

Who are you?

EUNICE

Why, I'm a lady, George. That fact

alone demands a certain amount of...

(cocks hammer back)

...cordiality.

GEORGE

I'm, I'm sorry I called you that.

EUNICE

Well, how courteous of you to

apologize. Courtesy is so important.

Don't you agree?

GEORGE

Y, yeah...I'm with that.

EUNICE

Good.   Now sit your fat ass down.

44.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

(with intent)

Where is...Concezio Yakavetta?

GEORGE

I don't know.

EUNICE

Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you don't

know, Hoss. For instance, why aren't

you safely tucked away in some ivory

tower with all the other big wigs,

sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail?

Why are you the one he left on the

streets, George?

GEORGE

Someone's gotta run our legitimate

businesses. Someone's gotta make sure

that...

EUNICE

Someone's gotta chum the waters.

GEORGE

That's bullshit and I ain't saying

another fucking word to you.

EUNICE

Good. Then you can just listen. The

jig is up. We know Concezio had that

priest killed.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Oh, surprise, surprise. Another thing

you don't know, I reckon. But why

would he tell you? You and your guys

on the streets, you're his bait. Y'all

just got thrown into a meat grinder.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Gorgeous George, huh? Expendable

George is more like it.

(BEAT)

(MORE)

45.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

By the by, you got a pretty nice ass

for a fat man.

ROMEO V.O.

You wanna find something in Boston that

don't wanna be found you go to the

Oracle, ese. My Uncle Cesar is hooked

up with the Underground.

CESAR

Word is, Yakavetta's gunning for you

boys hard. The whole city's on edge.

I even heard he posted a reward like

Jesse James style and shit. Any of his

guys that take you out gets his palm

crossed, two hundred and fifty grand.

ROMEO

Whew.   A quarter of a mill for us?

CESAR

Us? What the fuck are you talking

about "us?"

ROMEO

Uncle, why do you have to disrespect me

in front of them?!

CESAR

Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you

were washing my pots and pans!

ROMEO

Well, I don't wash fucking pots

anymore! I'm part of this, Uncle!

CESAR

Hey! This isn't my first bar-b-que!

Now shut up and stop interrupting! Let

me talk to them and I'll figure out

whether your in on this or in your own

fucking fantasy world!

46.

MURPHY

He's in.   All the way in.

CESAR

Is my nephew pulling his weight?

CONNOR

Mucho corazon.

CESAR

Gorgeous George is running the show for

Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution,

sharking, the whole cha cha. If

anybody knows where he is, it's that

fat fucking pedico. I'll put it out on

the wire.

MURPHY

Hey, uh, maybe we should...

CONNOR

Shut up.   Romeo's crying.

ROMEO

You fucking assholes!

47.

CAPO #5

That shipment of "H" was gonna square

our books for six months. Shit.

CAPO #6

We always bounce back. Besides, look

at the bright side. Better the chinks

than us, right.

CAPO #5

I guess.  Like the boss said...

(Concezio impression)

"This is war. There's gonna be

casuwalities."

GEORGE

Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here!

Where's all the concubines and shit?

CAPO #3

George.    What gives, here?

GEORGE

I need to see the Boss, right away.

CAPO #4

Jimmy the Gofer!

CAPO #2

(to Jimmy)

Il cortina.

CONCEZIO

Get over here!

GEORGE

Whoa!

48.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...!

CONCEZIO

Push the talk button, numb nuts.

GEORGE

Oh.

(he does)

Can you here me? Over.

CONCEZIO

I can hear you fine, Smokey and the

Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you

doing here?

GEORGE

Everything's in motion. All our guys

are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I

figure, no need for me to be on the

streets no more. So, which room do I

take, eh?

CONCEZIO

You stupid motherfucker! I told you,

you're on the streets till this is

over! Now get the fuck outta here!

CONCEZIO (CONT'D)

And don't come back here till I tell

you to, you fat fucking waste of space!

49.

JO JO

GEORGE

JO JO

GEORGE

JO JO

GEORGE

50.

JO JO

Naw, the other one.

GEORGE

Stop fuckin' around! This is serious

shit, here! Tell 'em we meet tomorrow

night. I'll call you with the

location.

GREENLY

Tap's up and running on George's cell.

EUNICE

(holds up baggy)

What's this?

GREENLY

Rosary bead. They found it pushed into

the carpet near the victim. Father

McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary so

it's probably been there a while.

DUFFY

The results on all 864 prints found at

the scene. All match churchgoers or

clergy but one. The partial on the

priest's watch is still unidentified.

EUNICE

That's horse shit. Everyone gets

printed nowadays. They're inking up

snotgobblers in kindergarten, now.

51.

DOLLY

It's a brick wall anyway. We know

Napoleon was wearing gloves. Lab got

zilch off the chain and lock. The

pennies came up clean too.

EUNICE

(FRUSTRATED)

I'm gonna go powder my nose.

GREENLY

Aw, man. Daddy would knock that out

like Mike Tyson.

GREENLY (CONT'D)

What?!   I didn't say nothing!

EUNICE

McKinney wore his watch on his left

hand.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Where was this found exactly?!

DUFFY

Right here, off his left elbow.   Where

are you going with this?

EUNICE

Dolly, get on the phone! Find out

which wrist he wore his rosary on and

if he was wearing it that night!

Duffy, run that partial through DMV!

David put it through INTERpol! Just

get an I.D.! Now! Come on! Vamoose!

EUNICE (CONT'D)

You took your glove off, didn'tcha

Cowboy. Now, why would you go and do a

damn fool thang like that?

52.

MURPHY

What the...did they use his mug shot?

CONNOR

What?   No.

MURPHY

You remember how he told us he was

embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up

all his long hair behind his head?

CONNOR

Aye.

MURPHY

Look at that.

MURPHY (CONT'D)

That's an arm.

CONNOR

Oh...that's fuckin' harsh.

MURPHY

Y'er one of a kind, Roc.

ROMEO

So, am I as good as this guy, or what?

CONNOR

You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.

53.

ROY

Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit!

(beat, recognition)

HOLY SHIT! You're the Saints! I'm

Roy, it's an honor. Huge fan!

CONNOR

We're developin' quite the cult

following in the old neighborhood.

ROMEO

Que pasa.

CESAR

I got that info you wanted, mijo.

CESAR V.O.

The place is Tropical Tan on Bunker

Hill. It's where the fat fucking juedo

gets his fake bake at. He's got a

secret appointment. Once a week, never

misses. Eight o'clock, tonight.

ROMEO

We got him.

ROY

(re: Romeo)

Who's this, your new sidekick?

(extends hand)

Pleased to meet you. I'm Roy.

ROMEO

How would you like me to sidekick you

in the ass, Roy?

54.

CONNOR

(GIGGLING)

Let's go.

ROY

I, I didn't mean to...

ROMEO

I'm sick of this shit! I've been

breaking my balls, here and I get

second banana billing! I...

MURPHY

I, I, I. There is no "I" in team, ya

selfish prick.

ROMEO

Yeah?!   Well, there's an "I" in "Fuck

you!

CONNOR

Lovely voice. We'd like ya ta sing for

us. What do ya say?

GEORGE

It's getting hard to be a fucking

gentleman of leisure, here!

MURPHY

We want the shooter you motherfuckers

used on that priest.

GEORGE

I don't know who it is.

55.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

It's the truth! Concezio didn't tell

no one what he was doing cuz he knew

nobody would have o'kay'ed it! The

shooter's an independent contractor!

That's all I know!

CONNOR

Where's Yakavetta hidin'?

GEORGE

The Prudential! Fortieth floor!   Jesus

Christ!

CONNOR

You meeting someone tonight, George?

GEORGE

Yeah.   The brugliones.

MURPHY

The what?

GEORGE

Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street

guys.

(suddenly brightens)

Your kind of guys. You could take a

real bite outta crime here, huh? I

could help you.

CONNOR

(re: phone)

What's this?

GEORGE

Nobody forgot what you guys did to us

last time. They're staying indoors. I

give out the location an hour before.

ROMEO

My Uncle's place is closed tonight.    I

got the key.

MURPHY

It's down by the docks.   Dead as a

doornail at night.

56.

CONNOR

Yeah. You could set off fourth of July

fireworks in dat place and nobody would

hear. How's Mexican for you, George?

GEORGE

No difference to me. I think I just

shit my Speedos, anyway.

EUNICE

How do, David?

GREENLY

Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial.

INTERpol's still working it. Should

only be another couple of hours.

EUNICE

Lovely.   Anything else?

GREENLY

Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a

text message from George's cell. Just

two words. "El Cava." It's a Mexican

joint down by the docks. He sent it to

his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess

gangsters gotta eat too, huh?

EUNICE

I think I'll drop in on their supper,

see if I can shake them up a little.

GREENLY

You need a body guard?

EUNICE

No thank you, Mike Tyson.    Bye now.

GREENLY

Bye.

GREENLY (CONT'D)

Oh, shit.

57.

GEORGE

Just two more to go. Uh...You guys are

gonna let me go, right?

MURPHY

We'll see, won't we.

GEORGE

Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.

N.S. BRUGLIONE #1

Yo, spicaroo. More nachos and mas

salsa, capisce?

S.S. BRUGLIONE #1

Hey and I need a refill there, pepe?

ROMEO

Si, muchachos.

S.S. BRUGLIONE #3

Whoa!    Easy...Jesus.

58.

ROMEO

These dagos are getting antsy and I'm

getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The

kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa

out there!

CONNOR

Stick it out. Waitin' on one more.

CREW CUT

He is not with them.

OLD MAN

Are you certain?

CREW CUT

Yes. It is only the sons. They have a

Spaniard with them. They will

slaughter everyone.

OLD MAN

Let them. If you kill the sons...the

father will come.

59.

CONNOR

The gang's all here.

ROMEO

Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.

MURPHY

Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome.

JO JO

So....where's Gorgeous?

N.S. BRUGLIONE #2

What the fuck is going on, here?

S.S. BRUGLIONE #2

Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe!

Where you at?!

S.S. BRUGLIONE #3

"Erin go brah?" What the hell does

that mean?

MURPHY

It's Irish for "You're fucked."

60.

ROMEO

Viva La Mejico, bitches!

GEORGE

Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have

really turned me around on this! I'm

like born again and shit! I swear!

MURPHY

(to Connor)

What do ya think? Let him go?

CONNOR

We'll let God decide if you get a

second chance.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

Well, praise the Lord.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

George?

(George turns)

All good boys go to heaven.

MURPHY

Now, that was, perhaps the finest

example of spiritual guidance that I

have ever had the good fortune ta

witness.

CONNOR

Well, thank you very much.     Mysterious

ways. Mysterious ways.

61.

CONNOR (CONT'D)

Drop the gun! Drop it!

EUNICE

Easy fellas. I'm alone.

ROMEO

He's gone.

CONNOR

Who are ya?

EUNICE

My name is Eunice Bloom...and I'm your

new guardian angel. A torch was passed

to me by a mutual friend, gone but not

forgotten.

MURPHY

We heard about Smecker.    He was a good

man.

CONNOR

Aye.   You have our condolences.

EUNICE

And you have mine.

CONNOR

CONNOR

MURPHY

Murphy.

62.

EUNICE

Very well...Connor, Murphy.

ROMEO

Who the fuck was that guy?!

EUNICE

That, I suspect, was the shooter you

boys have been looking for.

ROMEO

Fucking...what the fuck?! Who the fuck

is this brawd?! And what the fuck's

going on, here?!

EUNICE

Let's speed this up before your new

sidekick's got to dig any deeper into

his impressive vocabulary.

ROMEO

Oh, no you didn't.

EUNICE

I am an FBI agent who is controlling

this investigation from within, in

order to ensure that you gentlemen

never see the inside of a prison cell.

I am conspiring to do this with three

like minded individuals who have aided

you in the past. Though I have yet to

inform them of my agenda because, well,

girl's gotta have her fun.

MURPHY

Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?

EUNICE

The very same.

CONNOR

How are the lads?

EUNICE

Two of them are scared.   One's just

horny.

63.

MURPHY

Bet'cha I can guess which one.

EUNICE

Bet'cha can but let's save it for

group. Right now, we have a big

problem.

CONNOR

What's that?

EUNICE

This...simply won't do. We made a

deal. The big fish step in if your

body count gets too high and...

(re: carnage)

...you have been very naughty boys.

EUNICE

O'kay.   Here's how it all went down.

64.

EUNICE

A secret gathering of the Brugliones.

The topic of discussion? Weak

leadership and betrayal.

N.S. BRUGLIONE #1

Yakavetta's hiding from these Jesus

Freaks and making us look like pussies.

S.S. BRUGLIONE #1

And he's hanging all of us out to dry

to boot.

N.S. BRUGLIONE #2

All right.   I'll be the first to say

it.

EUNICE

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

So, even with all their old

vendettas...

N.S. BRUGLIONE #2

...I say fuck the Yakavettas.

EUNICE

And there it is. Guess what comes

next.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Red Rover.   Red Rover.

S.S. BRUGLIONE #2

We're taking over.

EUNICE

Ah. Easier uttered than accomplished.

The North End and the South End may as

well be the Hetfields and the McCoys.

These fellas...they just don't get on.

N.S. BRUGLIONE #3

Fuck you! The North End built that

racket from the ground up!

65.

S.S. BRUGLIONE #3

South End's been carrying your fucking

asses for years!

N.S. BRUGLIONE #3

15 percent?! In your dreams, asshole!

S.S. BRUGLIONE #3

Whoa! Just went up to twenty, fuck

stick!

S.S. BRUGLIONE #1

You want some of this, you mutt?!

N.S. BRUGLIONE #1

Let's see what you got!

EUNICE

Oh, the cliche. A Mexican stand off in

a Mexican restaurant.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

They cut each other to pieces...and

nobody walked away. Who knows who

fired first. Could have been any one

of them. But somebody let it loose.

(pointing to men)

And duck, duck, duck...

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Goose.

EUNICE

Yakavetta's lost control of the

streets.

(MORE)

66.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

They're fighting over his throne.      This

was not the work of the Saints.

GREENLY

INTERpol came through.

GREENLY (CONT'D)

You were right. Five foot five.       Gotta

be the shooter.

EUNICE

Are you ready for your fifteen minutes,

Sweetheart?

GREENLY

That ain't all. Short stuff's work

visa was signed by a sponsor that

doesn't exist and look at the date.

Two months after Nine Eleven.

EUNICE

Someone maneuvered it through the

system using false information during

the highest alert in U.S. history.

DOLLY

Yakavetta's just a gangster. He ain't

got the juice to pull that off.

EUNICE

You're darn tootin' he don't.

GREENLY

INS red flagged it like a motherfucker.

It's a shit storm.

EUNICE

Something stanks like manure.

67.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

We got someplace to be! Let's go!

DOLLY

What is this? Where are we going?

EUNICE

It's time to revisit the scene of the

crime.

GREENLY

It's after hours. I mean, if you

wanted a drink then...

EUNICE

37 bodies later and we're finally back

where it all began. Y'ever heard of

the southern expression, "We have an

elephant in the living room?"

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Hope you fellas brought some peanuts.

DUFFY

You knew all along.

CONNOR

What?    Ya don't call.   Ya don't write.

68.

MURPHY

I'm glad we got the band back

together...

(re: Romeo)

...even though our new bass player's

kind of a retard.

CONNOR

So, where'd you learn ta shoot like

that?

EUNICE

My Daddy was an old six gun shooter.      A

real cowboy.

MURPHY

Guess that makes you a cowgirl, eh?

Thanks. Saved our asses.

EUNICE

Don't mention it. Now, we have a

little business to go over before you

celebrate in earnest.

CONNOR

This is the guy?

EUNICE

That's the guy. He's a Sicilian

immigrant, name of Ottilio Panza.

MURPHY

Five, five?    He's short bastard isn't

he?

EUNICE

Yes...and well put. He'll be front

page news in the morning but we have to

assume Yakavetta already knows we've

ID'd his guy. We can't give him time

to 'Plan B' us.

69.

MURPHY

We're hittin' him tomorrow night.   Dat

soon enough?

EUNICE

Should be.   Where's it gonna happen?

CONNOR

The Pru.

DOLLY

The Prudential Building?   What are you,

cracked?

GREENLY

Why don't you just do it on center ice

at a fucking Bruin's game?!

CONNOR

Dat's where the man is so dat's where

we're goin'. No guts no glory, Green

Beans.

MURPHY

In fact, we could use a few extra

hands...that is if you fellas can still

get yer Irish on.

GREENLY

Hey, I got balls for days, pally.   I'm

a fucking sack-o-matic.

DOLLY AND DUFFY

We're in.

EUNICE

(to all)

Well, you boys have fun. Connor,

Murphy? Escort a lady to the door?

CONNOR

Y'sure you don't wanna hear the plan?

I'm not tryin' ta brag or nothin' but

this one's a real Picasso.

MURPHY

Aw, Jesus.

70.

CONNOR

Hey.

EUNICE

School night. Got some homework to do.

Besides, I'd like to critique your

masterpiece with a fresh eye.

MURPHY

What is it?

EUNICE

Something ain't right with this whole

thing. Panza knew you were in there

tonight and he just let it happen.

Didn't lift a finger. I mean, if he's

working for Yakavetta, why would he

stand by and just watch all his guys

get taken out?

MURPHY

That is...interestin'.

CONNOR

You think maybe we got another fox in

the hen house here?

EUNICE

Starting ta look that way. Somebody

pushed that visa through. Could have

ourselves a gen-u-ine 'Ghost in the

Darkness,' here.

CREW CUT

They still live...What if he does not

come? What if...

OLD MAN

Shhhhh.   He will come.

71.

GUN DEALER

Expanded my operation, since I saw ya

last. Word got out who may or may not

have outfitted ya. Turns out ya got

quite the underground followin'.

GUN DEALER

Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers

select from my private reserve.

GUN DEALER (CONT'D)

If I may make a suggestion.

MURPHY

I feel like that kid who found the gold

ticket in the candy bar in "Willy Wonka

and the Chocolate Factory."

GUN DEALER

Charlie.

CONNOR

Yeah...Charlie.

(picks up gun)

And I want an Oompa Loompa now, Daddy,

now.

GUN DEALER

Full accessory packages.      I'm sure

you'll find them useful.

ROMEO

I'll take these.

72.

MURPHY

Have you been crying again?

ROMEO

Yeah!  Tears of joy!

(to Dealer)

How much?

GUN DEALER

You guys are on the house.

MURPHY

(to Romeo)

Let's see.

ROMEO

What?

CONNOR

Nothin'.

ROMEO

Are you saying I look gay?!

MURPHY

No.    You just hail from a colorful...

ROMEO

(to Dealer)

You don't know me. You think these

make me look gay?

GUN DEALER

You look like you might have seen one

up close.

73.

OLD MAN

Evidence?

OLD MAN

Foolish, arrogant boy!   What have you

done?!

CONCEZIO

That wiley old fox not as clever as we

thought. Or maybe he played me from the

git. Y-you think he played me?

JIMMY

Uh, Boss. Maybe you aught not to be

telling me this stuff. I'm just...

CONCEZIO

A little sensitivity, huh? You

heartless cocksucker! I need to

vindicate my feelings here! I can't

tell those goombas outside! They'll

serve up my balls over a plate of

fucking spaghetti!

CAPO #4

Fuck that. We got a mutiny on our

hands. Every ten cent wanna be with a

gun is moving on us all over town.

74.

CAPO #3

Yeah and our fearless leader ain't even

come out of his little pussy room yet.

CONCEZIO

I want each of you to call your top

button man. The best you got. I want

them all here tonight. We rip this

city a new asshole. It's time for us

to reconnoiter our strength on the

streets. We seize the day starting

now...Carpel Tunnel, gentlemen, Carpel

Tunnel.

CAPO #5

Glad to see you back among the living,

Boss.

DOLLY

God speed.

75.

MURPHY

What.

ROMEO

Nothing.

CONNOR

Out with it! What the hell's the

matter with ya?

ROMEO

Nothing! It's just...this is some

heavy shit.

CONNOR

Ya did fine at your uncle's place.

ROMEO

Yeah, but we're going off a new script

here. I'm just having a...period of

adjustment.

MURPHY

You're about to have a period of

gettin' yer ass beat!

ROMEO

Hey! You two ain't the only ones

rollin' with no health insurance! Just

let me do my thing. I'm absorbing this.

CONNOR

This is not the time for you to be

absorbin' shit! Now, if ya freeze up

when you get in there just point yer

gay guns at 'em and fer Christ sakes,

at least try ta look cool!

MURPHY

I thought you were all hot fer dis!

ROMEO

Oh, I'm hot! I'm fucking red hot! The

kid's flamin' like Matt Damon in the

Grande Camens!

76.

CONNOR

This is you. Be on time.

ROMEO

I'll be there.

CONNOR

You ready fer dis shit, my dear

brother?

MURPHY

(cocking .50 cal)

Let's do some gratuitous violence.

EUNICE

(to herself)

On a sultry Saturday in September the

Saints saved seventeen souls...try

saying that five times fast.

GREENLY

Come on. There's nothing to be afraid

of. It's all over.

(TURNS)

He won't come out.

KUNTSLER

Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby

relieved of all obligation to this

investigation.

77.

KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

That's right, kids. This crime scene

is now under the full jurisdiction of

your beloved federal government. As of

now, you will all report to me, Special

Agent John Kuntsler.

KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

Don't let us interrupt you. Just don't

forget to turn over everything you

find. We have people standing by ready

to take credit for all your hard work.

KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

So, how ya doin', Bloomy?

EUNICE

Just fine...Cunty.

KUNTSLER

Nice little science project you got

going with these three goofballs.

(re: detectives)

You trying to turn them into your own

little junior G-men? Well, you can put

sprinkles on shit, Bloom, but it's

still shit. So, you and your Keystone

Cops can all go home now and let the

professionals handle this?

EUNICE

Boy. I'd love to hear a gen-u-wine

professional's assessment of a crime

scene. How 'bout you, detectives?

KUNTSLER

O'kay. Seems pretty obvious. The door

was broken down. We've got our point

of entry. The assailants fired in this

direction.

(points toward windows)

(MORE)

78.

KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

Explains the windows. The victims

were...

EUNICE

There are three inaccuracies in what

you just said. Number one, David.

GREENLY

If the windows were shattered by

gunfire coming from inside the room,

the glass would have been blown

outward. As you can see, most of it is

on the inside.

EUNICE

Number two, Dolly.

DOLLY

Blood splatters in the direction of the

rounds fired. If the assailants

discharged toward the windows, the

blood would follow suit. Here, the

majority of splatter is in the opposing

direction.

EUNICE

Number three, Duffy.

DUFFY

Trick question. There is no number

three. He only fucked up twice.

EUNICE

(WHISTLES)

Looks like Bloomy aced her science

project.

KUNTSLER

That was just off the...I would have

seen the blood thing...I haven't even

had time to...

EUNICE

Why don't you let me take a crack at

it, John? Won't cost you nuthin'.

KUNTSLER

And just why would I do that?

79.

EUNICE

Cuz, tonight...mamma's right on time.

EUNICE

This evening's topic of discussion?

Desperate times require desperate

measures.

CONCEZIO

Desperate times require...some, you

know, some desperate shit. Starting

tonight, every one of you fat fucking

slobs is back on the streets and

earning your daily bread.

CONCEZIO (CONT'D)

Shut the fuck up!

(they obey)

We got no choice. You motherfuckers

better get in touch with your 'inner

gangster'. It's time to knock the dust

off your ball bats! You break bones!

You smash heads! You do whatever you

gotta do!

EUNICE

Which brings us to the relevance of our

new guests.

CONCEZIO

(to button men)

Each one of you is to stick to the guy

that called you here like glue. You

arm yourselves to the teeth, pick your

own crews. These bible banging psychos

will make an attempt. It's your job to

blow their souless hearts out of their

chests.

EUNICE

It's time to reclaim the streets with

an iron fist.

80.

CONCEZIO

We gotta take back what's ours with

some sincere ironfistery.

EUNICE

Let's explain the glass, now.   Why is

most of it inside the room?

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Here's why...or it will be "why" in a

moment. Y'see, these boys. Well, to

put it simply, they tend to get

reeeeal...

CONNOR

Creative!   It's a creative plan!

MURPHY

It's ridiculous! Probably based on

some stupid shit ya saw in a movie!

And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up

with rope! What is the deal with you

and rope?! Honestly!

CONNOR

It happens ta be a useful thing!

DUFFY

You didn't get this from a movie...did

you?

81.

CONNOR

The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood!

And it worked like a fucking charm for

him!

ROMEO

O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty

Lane, apartment 3C.

(shows him wallet pic)

Lovely wife and kids. How old are

they? Nevermind. Here's the

situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of

friends of mine are fittin' to do some

killin' here tonight. I'm talking

bullets and blood, custom-wholesale

slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O?

(Lloyd nods)

Good. Now, I've run into a little

snag. I need to figure out a tag line.

You know, something cool to say when

it's all over like..."I'll be back,"

but mine, y'know? I need to own this

one. I think this'll help me get

through the quote, unquote event. I'm

going to take your gag off and you and

me are going to riff a little, o'kay?

Let's have fun with this.

LLOYD

I can't believe you! I'm a fucking

janitor. What do I know about bullets

and slaughter and shit?

ROMEO

Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an

"Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking

suite and you're gonna help me think of

one!

82.

EUNICE

And you can count on it like the U.S.

mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or

snow...something always seems to go

wrong for these poor sons o' guns.

CONNOR

What the fuck?

GREENLY

(hitting controls)

I don't know! It just stopped!

MURPHY

Well, get it fuckin' goin' again!

GREENLY

It won't turn back on!     It just died!

BROTHERS

OH, SHIT!

CONNOR

How much time?!

DUFFY

(looks at watch)

Sixty Seconds!

MURPHY

We gotta go now!

DUFFY

What are you talking about!?

CONNOR

If we're even a few seconds late,

Romeo's dead! We gotta go!

(looking up)

We're down thirteen stories!

MURPHY

Eleven more to go!     Ball park it!

BROTHERS

One floor, two, three...

83.

MURPHY

(MIFFED)

The fuckin' Eiger Sanction.

LLOYD

Uh..."Take that, suckers!"

ROMEO

Not cool enough.

LLOYD

Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!"

ROMEO

Too sacrilegious.

LLOYD

Oh God, uh, how about "Eat it!"

ROMEO

What are we at, a buffet, now?

LLOYD

Good God, man! I'm a...

ROMEO

Hang on, you might be onto something

with the buffet thing, like with food,

y'know? Let's brainstorm on that idea

for a minute.

MURPHY

TIME?!

DUFFY

JESUS CHRIST! SEVEN SECONDS...SIX...

FIVE...

DUFFY V.O.

FOUR...THREE!...TWO!...

84.

EUNICE

One...thing has always amazed me.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

How quiet it gets. You ever noticed

that? It's hard to imagine that just a

few hours ago, it was the God damn O.K.

coral in here.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

One thang I'm gon guarantee ya...

EUNICE

We gon have us a good time...

85.

EUNICE

...in the old barn tonight!

EUNICE

YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!!

BOTH

And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my

Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended

forth from Thy hand, that our feet may

swiftly carry out Thy command.

(MORE)

86.

BOTH (CONT'D)

So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee

and teeming with souls shall it ever

be.

BOTH (CONT'D)

In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus

Sancti.

ROMEO

"Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?"

MURPHY

What?

CONNOR

Whup ass fajita?

CONNOR AND MURPHY

That's fuckin' stupid.

EUNICE

Hold up, now.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

Was that the best you could do?

ROMEO

It's just...I couldn't think...I

EUNICE

Shhhhhh.

(whispers in ear)

Ya broke down the door, didn'tcha?

ROMEO

Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong!

87.

MURPHY

Exactly.

CONNOR

You said it.

EUNICE

And that, gentlemen...is the sound of

the fat lady singin'.

GREENLY

Should we...clap or something?

DUFFY

Shut up.

KUNTSLER

Hey!

DUFFY

Eunice!    Oh, shit!    Eunice!

GREENLY

If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I

will kill you! Do you fucking hear,

me? I'll kill you!

GREENLY (CONT'D)

Get a hostage negotiator down here and

put some stank on it! He could be in

there all...touching her and shit!

88.

JIMMY

I'm sorry!   I'm sorry!   I wasn't gonna

hurt you!

EUNICE

You bet your ass you weren't.

JIMMY

Just lemme explain. I have

information, like pertinent

information. Ouch! Look, I was

listening to you out there and that's,

like, exactly what happened. That's

what made me think you were the person

to talk to.

EUNICE

Yakavetta had a partner, didn't he.

JIMMY

Yeah.

EUNICE

You saw this fella?

JIMMY

Yeah. It was only one time and just

for a second but I think I could ID

him. I don't know his name, though.

Concezio always called him the "Old

Man" accept one time when he called him

something else, like he fucked up and I

wasn't supposed ta hear it.

EUNICE

What was it?

JIMMY

He called him...the Roman.

89.

GREENLY

(re: Jimmy)

Did this little motherfucker...?

EUNICE

Easy, David. I'm fine. C'mon gents,

we're leaving. This is the Fed's

problem, now.

KUNTSLER

Hey! What happened in there?      What was

said to you, Agent?

EUNICE

You got him in custody. Ask him

yourself. You're the professional.

DOLLY

Yeah, professional moron.

DUFFY

I got no idea. That's just weird. The

Roman? What do you think it means?

EUNICE

Feels like our ghost ta me.

DOLLY

What do we do now? I mean, the

brothers ain't goin' nowhere until we

get Panza or they do.

EUNICE

We've all had enough excitement for one

night. Let's sleep on it.

90.

MURPHY

When's Romeo returnin' to the "hide

out?'

CONNOR

Soon as he's done apologizin' to his

uncle for wreckin' his restaurant.

MURPHY

And he should be sorry.   The

disrespect.

DOC

Hold your damn horses!

GREENLY

Sack-o-matic, I said!

MURPHY

I got nothin'!

CONNOR

One in the hole.

DOC

Boys!

91.

CREW CUT

Put dem down! Throw dem over!

CREW CUT (CONT'D)

Throw dem over!

CREW CUT (CONT'D)

Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This

one?

(re: Murphy)

Dee other, eh?

MURPHY

Jesus Christ!

CONNOR

Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance!

CREW CUT

You.

POPPA M

Where is the Old Man?

CREW CUT

Never.

92.

MURPHY

Just hold on.

CONNOR

Hang in there, brother.     They're

comin'.

GREENLY

Naw, boys...it's over. Don't

worry...proudest day of my life.

BROTHERS

Da!

POPPA M

Easy, boys.

MURPHY

What the fuck's he doin'?

BROTHERS

JESUS CHRIST!

CONNOR

I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's

brains out, right now!

POPPA M

CONNOR!

POPPA M (CONT'D)

Son...Daddy's workin'.

93.

POPPA M (CONT'D)

Where is he?

CONNOR AND MURPHY

(WHISPER)

Come on.

CREW CUT

Make me famous.

POPPA M

(pulling back hammer)

Where?

CREW CUT

FUCK YOU!!!

POPPA M

I'm so sorry, boys.      This is all my

fault.

MURPHY

What are ya talkin' about, Da?

POPPA M

I was an immigrant to the U.S. in 1958.

I was sixteen. I came to New York

where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a

cobbler.

(MORE)

94.

POPPA M (CONT'D)

Had a little shop and I was to learn

the family business. Mafia was

everywhere in those days.

POPPA M V.O.

Simple extortion...protection money.

But your grandfather was proud.

JACOB

I can't help ya with dat, lads. Ya got

problems with your shoes, I'd be happy

to have a look, got fair prices.

POPPA M V.O.

I just...watched.

LOUIE

Il ochio de dio! We gotta call the

polizia, Noah! We gotta call somebody!

POPPA M V.O.

I buried my father, then I buried the

men who killed him. Louie, my best

friend, helped me...

THUG #3

Come on, kid. It was an accident.

We can work dis out. Whatever you want.

95.

THUG #4

He ain't gonna do shit.

(to Thug #3)

I'll take two.

THUG #3

What da fuck's da matter with you?

Can't you see...

THUG #4

I see just fine. Deal.

THUG #1

(in Italian, to Louie)

You're Italian, kid. Help us out here.

Put one in the back of his head and you

get anything you want!

LOUIE

I, I, I...am his friend.

THUG #4

Fuck him and fuck his friend. Deal the

cards! He ain't got the balls.

POPPA M V.O.

It started out slowly. Just the ones

who were a threat to us.

MAFIOSO #1

Come on, kid. It's good for you, good

for us. We'll move it right out the

back of the place.

MAFIOSO #2

It'll never touch you. You got the

word of the Bonnavese family on that.

96.

MAFIOSO #1

What's da matter with you, eh?

LOUIE

(WHISPERING)

Easy, Noah...easy friend.

MAFIOSO #2

What are you, stupid or something?

CUT TO:

POPPA M

Then one day...

LOUIE

Why should we not help others who

suffer these Mafia thugs?

POPPA M V.O.

Then it began.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

Louie would pick the marks and plan

everything in detail.

97.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

And I would go in and do the jobs.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

I would execute, over and over again,

those who had taken my father from me.

POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)

So it went for years.

MURPHY

Jesus.

CONNOR

So...how'd ya end up inside, Da?

POPPA M

Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and

the police were waitin' for me. He set

me up, 25 to life.

MURPHY

Wait...why did he set you up?

POPPA M

Can't wait ta ask him.

CONNOR

Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down

yer time? The guy fucked ya.

POPPA M

I couldn't.

CONNOR

Why the hell not?

98.

POPPA M

He'd learned of the birth of my sons.

CONNOR

Do you know Louie's full name?

POPPA M

Aye.

DUFFY

Hello.

CONNOR

It's me.   Put Eunice on.

EUNICE

I hope they do it slow...you piece of

shit.

99.

PATRONAZZI

Si.

OLD MAN

Hello, old friend.

PATRONAZZI

Many years.    Are you in need?

OLD MAN

Yes. I am making marinara and alas, I

have run out of tomatoes. To help an

old friend...how many can you spare?

PATRONAZZI

I am in good supply of tomatoes.

ROCCO

Come on.     The game's starting.

ROCCO (CONT'D)

Funny thing about the Red Sox. We

never gave up hope, y'know? It's what

kept us going all those years. And

they did it. They finally fuckin' did

it. What are we all gonna do now, huh?

100.

ROCCO (CONT'D)

I lost a lot of money on 'em. But I

gotta admit. Always felt

better...betting the underdogs.

ROCCO

So, how's things going?

ROCCO (CONT'D)

Yeah. I know. It's rough having your

faith shaken.

ROCCO (CONT'D)

But it happens to all of us.

(BEAT)

You know what's always tripped me out?

How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of

desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,

crossed the ocean blue. They had no

clue what was on the other side of it.

Took real balls. But they sailed into

infinity and made it all the way to the

shores of the New fucking World...

(re: surroundings)

...and all they had was their faith.

I'm always surprised how so many people

miss the simple fact that faith...is

the reason all of us are even here.

You can't underestimate the power of

it. Shit, you were the ones that

taught me that.

ROCCO (CONT'D)

Listen, your my boys so I'm gonna give

you some inside. The Sox are gonna do

it again this year. The line in Vegas

is huge. Put everything you got on it.

101.

MURPHY

Maybe we should.

CONNOR

You're sure, Roc? You know this?

ROCCO

No...I   just have faith. And for a

second   there, you almost did too.

Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough

people   catch it...look out, baby.

CONNOR

While the wicked stand confounded...

MURPHY

...call me with Thy Saints surrounded.

EUNICE

He lives in York Maine. About 30

minutes from here. Better go quick. I

logged on to an FBI database to get the

info. Homeland Security does internal

monitoring now. Only a matter of time

before they flag it.

POPPA M

Will they know it's you?

(she nods)

Will you be all right, dear?

EUNICE

I hear Costa Rica's nice.

EUNICE (CONT'D)

I never thought I'd ask this of another

human being but please...kill this man.

102.

POPPA M

It ends taday.

KUNTSLER

Anybody word from Bloom, yet?

G-MAN #2

Nothing.

KUNTSLER

I want that little Bayou Bitch in here.

Something stinks about this whole

thing.

G-MAN #2

I'm having D.H.S. dump her IP and check

for flags. See if she's been poking

around.

103.

KUNTSLER

This is S.A.I.C., Jonathan Buford

Kuntsler! Security code A4153B! I

need an immediate R2 law enforcement

override clearance!

FEDERAL OPERATOR V.O.

What is your specific request, Agent?

KUNTSLER

Everyone in the tri-state area with a

gun!

POPPA M

Hello, Louie.

ROMAN

Noah.

POPPA M

We haven't much time.

104.

ROMAN

My garden. She is beautiful, yes?     Ah,

but you. You are blind to beauty.     You

are a destroyer, Noah.

POPPA M

You know my reasons.   You know why I

did what I did.

ROMAN

But do you? You think it was for your

father? No. You were born a killer.

Death...is in the very blood that runs

through your veins.

POPPA M

No.

ROMAN

Then explain this.

ROMAN (CONT'D)

You were not there to raise them. Not

a single day. Yet, how closely they

follow in the footsteps of their

father. They have inherited your

blood, Noah...your anger.

THUG #1

(whispered into walkie)

Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man.

THUG #6

Got it.   Wait for the signal.

105.

POPPA M

And you?   What are you?

ROMAN

I am a creator. You see? Our very

natures stood in opposition as old as

the story of the scorpion and the frog.

POPPA M

Why...did you sell me out, Louie?

ROMAN

You can never understand.

POPPA M

25 years....try me.

ROMAN

I wanted to join with them. They were

building an empire. Creating something

and I was helping them! I used you,

Noah, to eliminate their problems, to

destroy their competition, to cut out

their cancers. I earned my place among

them.

POPPA M

Is this your place among them? Because

all I see is a an old man, sitting in a

garden.

ROMAN

Alas, the scorpion and the frog both

lost everything, yes? I should have

paid more attention to the story.

(MORE)

106.

ROMAN (CONT'D)

Without you...I was no longer useful to

them. They cast me out!

KUNTSLER

The location is to be surrounded and

secured upon arrival! Nobody goes in!

KUNTSLER (CONT'D)

Are those fucking news choppers?!

POPPA M

Why the priest, Louie?     Why all this?

Why, now?

ROMAN

Because I knew it would bring you and

your sons. You would destroy the

Yakavettas and clear my way. This

time, I will take what is rightfully

mine. Just a little piece, for my old

age. After all, I have never been a

greedy man.

THUG #6

That's it!   Move!

107.

CONNOR AND MURPHY

Da?

108.

POPPA M

Boys.    Help me up.

POPPA M (CONT'D)

I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

CONNOR

Oh, no, no, no.

POPPA M

It's a beautiful day.

MURPHY

Aye.    It is...it is, Da.

POPPA M V.O.

And shepherds we shall be...

POPPA M V.O.

...for Thee, my Lord, for Thee...

POPPA M V.O.

Power hath descended forth from Thy

hand...

109.

POPPA M V.O.

...that our feet may swiftly carry out
