MUTE WITNESS

(1994)

Screenplay by

Anthony Waller

CREDITS (First part)

White letters on black screen. We hear the sound of a radio with a

lot of statics. Apparently, someone is scanning the channels.

After we've heard different channels, the scanning stops on a

channel with jazz music.

With a loud sound, the credits stop, the black screen moves away

to the right and is replaced by :

FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

(it is actually day-time, but the scene in the film being shot is

supposed to take place during the night. So all the artificial

lights make us believe it is night-time)

We still hear the sound of the radio.

We are on a film set, even though we don't know it yet. The way it

is filmed makes us believe we are in a real bedroom.

A bedroom, seen through a window. Nice, clean, elegantly furnished

and very well lit. Large bed. On the other side of the room from

the window, a young woman is seated in front of desk facing the

wall. The young woman stands up, with a paper document in her

hand. She is wearing thick hoses, large slippers and a man's white

shirt, which hangs down to the middle of her thighs.

She walks out of the bedroom, to the next room. The window opens,

and the camera, which acts as the eyes of the intruder, looks

around the room.

VOICE ON THE RADIO

We interrupt this program to bring you a special news

bulletin.

The camera moves to the next room :

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

A dining-room with a large mantlepiece. In the center of the room,

a round dining table with four chairs around it. The table is set,

ready for dinner.

VOICE ON THE RADIO

Ernest Strohbecker and two accomplices escaped from a

maximum-security ward in Bellevue Hospital last night...

The camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) keeps on

looking around the room and then focus on the radio set sitting on

a small table.

VOICE ON THE RADIO

... after brutally stabbing two nurses and a custodian to

death. Strohbecker is extremely dangerous, brutal and

unpredict...

The radio is suddenly switched off.

The camera moves upward to show us the corridor and the open door

of the bathroom in the corridor.

THE YOUNG WOMAN (Voice over)

Harry ?

FILM SET - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

Close shot on the mirror, in front of which the young woman is

standing. She looks a bit surprised by the sudden silence of the

radio, but very soon goes back to her make-up.

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Harry ?

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Harry ?

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Harry !

KAREN (whispering)

He has the hots for you.

BILLY (in sign language)

For me ? No.

ANDY

Cut. Brilliant.

ANDY (yelling)

Natasha !

ANDY

Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here.

ANDY

When I said more...

ANDY

...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.

ANDY

This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just

another victim.

ANDY

You get stabbed. You die.

ANDY

I want to see the pain.

ANDY

I want to see the blood spurting.

ANDY (voice over)

Billy, where was the blood ? I want to see her bleed to

death.

ANDY (to Billy)

Okay ?

(to the actress)

Okay ?

ANDY (voice over)

Let's do it again, folks !

THE ACTOR

Oh !

KAREN

You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your

elbow. Okay ?

THE ACTOR

Sure.

KAREN

We're gonna be here till Christmas, right ?

(turning around and calling)

Natasha !

NATASHA

Yes.

KAREN

Tell him you make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with

your elbow.

KAREN

Okay.

NATASHA (voice over)

Tell her that he will get it right next time.

KAREN

Mmmm... She heard you. You all keep forgetting she can hear

you perfectly well.

NATASHA (voice over)

Oh, I'm sorry.

BILLY (in sign language)

It's okay.

ANDY

Okay, from the top.

THE VOICE

Stop. Stop. Stop!

ANDY

What's the holdup ?

ANDY

What is he saying ?

THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT

He says he's awfully sorry, but he needs at least a day to

redress the set.

ANDY (yelling)

A day ?

THE RUSSIAN ASSISTANT

Yeah.

ANDY

Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now,

and that'll wrap it for today.

ANDY

All right. Okay. So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a

slow zoom into the puddle of blood...

NATASHA

Billy.

NATASHA

Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again.

BILLY (in sign language)

Thank you.

KAREN

So, he's kind of cute.

KAREN

Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights...

KAREN

Just a thought.

KAREN

Billy, that's what Mom would say.

KAREN

Hi.

NATASHA

He says use more white like a real dead body.

ANDY (voice over)

Okay, Boris, get everyone ready.

A VOICE OVER WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT

Out of frame, Billy.

ANDY

What... what is going on now ?

ALEX

Andy. Sorry, it's six o'clock.

ANDY

One shot, one more shot !

ALEX

We have no time.

ANDY

One shot ! I can't believe this.

KAREN

She needs to go get Strohbecker's face.

ANDY

Ohh ! Right ! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday.

KAREN

We'll wait for you here.

ANDY

Karen, she's got her own car.

KAREN

Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight.

ANDY

Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta ! I'm making my famous chili con

Clarke.

ANDY

Alex !... what do you say ? You coming ?

ALEX

Sorry. I have tickets for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight.

ANDY

Well, try and stay awake.

ANDY

ANDY

Hello ?... Hello ?

ANDY

KAREN (voice over)

Didn't it even cross your mind ?

KAREN

ANDY (voice over from the kitchen)

I was thinking about dinner.

ANDY

I'm still thinking about dinner.

KAREN

She's not there either. Shit.

KAREN

Okay. Ohh !

KAREN

Okay. So are you coming over now ?

KAREN (voice over on the telephone)

KAREN

Well, don't worry. Just get over here.

KAREN

KAREN

Andy, go with the janitor...

KAREN (voice over)

KAREN (voice over)

KAREN (voice over)

Don't just stand there !

KAREN

Do it now !

ANDY

Ambulance !

ANDY

Come on !

KAREN

It's all right, sweetie.

KAREN

I'm here now and an ambulance is on its way.

KAREN

Let go of her. She's trying to say something.

KAREN

Police ?

KAREN

Murder ?

KAREN

Andy ! Andy !

LYOSHA

Excuse me. It's true. We just fake murder. If we really

want to murder...

LYOSHA (voice over)

...why make film of it ?

LYOSHA

We're not stupid, really.

ARKADI

No, no. Sorry.

ARKADI (voice over)

We understand how she feel. She think she see...

ARKADI

...a real murder and panic.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Where did you see the murder from ?

FIRST POLICEMAN

And it was this man ?

FIRST POLICEMAN

But you say here : He wore a stocking pulled over his

head.

FIRST POLICEMAN

And then they chased me through the building and try to

kill me as well.

ANDY

Guys ! Guys ! English, please.

ARKADI

We make test for you.

ARKADI

For your film. We try make blood much big.

BILLY (in sign language)

He's lying !

LYOSHA (voice over)

Sorry, Billy.

LYOSHA

We not tell you. Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.

ANDY

I would've let you done tests.

KAREN (whispering)

Andy.

ANDY

What I mean is... What I mean is... Let's see their film.

I'll know if it's real.

FIRST POLICEMAN (voice over)

You're right.

KAREN

Wait. Stop !

KAREN

He could expose the film.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Let her do it. Please.

KAREN

Okay.

KAREN

This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom.

FIRST POLICEMAN

I see.

ANDY (whispering)

God, it's hot in here.

KAREN (voice over)

If he had exposed the film to the light, he could have

destroyed all the evidence.

KAREN (voice over)

Actually, I haven't done this since film school.

KAREN (voice over)

Right. It's safe in the can now.

KAREN (voice over)

Here. Take it to the lab immediately...

KAREN (voice over)

...for developing.

KAREN

It's okay... It's okay.

KAREN

Murder weapon ? Where ?

LYOSHA (voice over)

Stop. Stop. Stop!

ANDY

I'm...

KAREN

What ?

ANDY

I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

KAREN

You...

ANDY

Oh, my God!

FIRST POLICEMAN

Tastes sweet.

ANDY

It's for the actors. They put the stuff in their mouths.

FIRST POLICEMAN

What she say ?

KAREN

That it's her knife. They broke into her box and used all

the blood.

FIRST POLICEMAN

So now she say it was a trick.

KAREN

It happened so fast she couldn't see the knife clearly.

FIRST POLICEMAN

But everything else she saw tonight was clear ? Huh ?

KAREN

The body in the elevator shaft. She saw that.

KAREN

What ?

ANDY

What ? What ?

FIRST POLICEMAN

Sweet. It is fake blood.

ANDY

It's fake blood.

KAREN

They could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards.

FIRST POLICEMAN

But... where is the body ? Huh ?

FIRST POLICEMAN

Here you say, "A head cut off."

KAREN

Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more

bags in there before.

ARKADI

No, she's right. I will show you.

ARKADI

From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy.

ANDY

Hey, we need that.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you

after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry.

ANDY

Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life.

KAREN

I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the

difference between a real murder and a gag.

ANDY

Please, has she even seen a real murder ?

KAREN

That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she

has seen the difference, right ?

ANDY

Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up

tonight. Even I believed it.

KAREN

Because you're a wuss.

ANDY

I'm gonna let that slide.

ANDY

No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today

using that guy's knife.

KAREN

It was her knife. God !

ANDY

Whatever. It looked good.

KAREN

Shut up.

JANITOR

Buka !

JANITOR

Buka ?

JANITOR

Buka.

JANITOR

Buka. Buka.

ANDY

Please, Billy, take some of mine. You'll feel better.

ANDY

Okay.

ANDY

Could you pass me the salt, please ?

KAREN

You could at least make the effort.

ANDY

Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the

movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn.

KAREN

How often have I heard that ?

ANDY

Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.

KAREN

What ?

ANDY

Okay, how about this ?

ANDY

Means makeup, right ?

KAREN

Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their

face.

ANDY

That was close.

KAREN

What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's

face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die.

She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act

that.

THE REAPER

Come closer, Mr. Hausmann. I won't bite.

THE REAPER (voice over)

Did it go smoothly ?

LYOSHA

About the money...

THE REAPER

Did it go smoothly ?

LYOSHA

Yes, of course. No problem.

THE REAPER

Did it go smoothly, Mr. Hausmann ?

LYOSHA

We did our job. The condition was...

THE REAPER

The condition was that everything would go smoothly.

LYOSHA

Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette.

THE REAPER

And who informed the police ?

LYOSHA

American girl say something, but nobody believe her.

THE REAPER

As long as there are witnesses, there's no money.

LYOSHA

You mean ?...

THE REAPER

I think we understand each other, Mr. Hausmann.

KAREN

No, honestly, you can come back to our place, and we'll set

up the couch if you want.

KAREN

You're not on one of your I'll show her how independent I

am kicks, are you ?

ANDY

Honey, you coming or what ?

KAREN

Andy, don't you care about her ?

ANDY

I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the

American Embassy tonight, okay ?

KAREN

It's the weekend. They're closed.

ANDY

Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number

before we left, just in case. So say goodbye.

LARSEN

Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the

complaint.

LOVETT

Good evening, gentlemen.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Good evening.

LARSEN

Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary. My

chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here. If this witness is

correct about what she saw tonight, she may help my own

investigation.

LOVETT

Your English is quite good, Mr. Larsen.

LARSEN

Thank you. My mother was a translator.

LOVETT

In the university ?

LARSEN

No. KGB.

LARSEN

Please.

LARSEN

We've been tracking gangsters in Moscow running an

international pornography and prostitution racket.

LARSEN

Sit down, please. We have information they have made snuff

films here and sold them all over the world.

LOVETT

Snuff film... Is that what I think it is ?

LARSEN

Victims believe they are making a sex film, but they are

murdered in front of the camera.

LARSEN

What is the name of the witness ? What is it ?

FIRST POLICEMAN

Billy Hughes, sir.

LARSEN

Billy Hughes. Yes. She claims to have seen one being made.

LARSEN (voice over from the loudspeaker)

The victims are illegal immigrants exploited as prostitutes

by a gang headed by one man.

LARSEN

He is brutal, ruthless. They call him The Reaper.

LARSEN

I'm surprised his men gave up the film so easily. If it is

what I think it is, our witness, Billy Hughes, is in great

danger.

Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ?

LARSEN

I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and

legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even

think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You

never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic

and horror when they realize   they're about to die.

ANDY (voice over)

Yes, sir... No, sir.

near the fucking door!

KAREN (voice over)

Oh, my God!

LARSEN

The girl you saw murdered tonight...

LARSEN

...her boyfriend stole a diskette full of information.

Money, names, connections, everything. He blackmailed The

Reaper. Very dangerous. And now he thinks that you have the

diskette.

BILLY

Me ?

LARSEN

You have it ?... Huh ?

ANDY

We don't have any diskettes.

ANDY

Not that one. That's my script.

LARSEN

The girl had it when she went into the studio. Then she was

murdered, and it was gone. Where is it ? Think. You were

the only person there.

LARSEN

Think.

LARSEN

Write. Write it.

LARSEN

Write it.

LARSEN

Quick, write.

LARSEN

Police ? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette.

LARSEN

You know, I work undercover. The Reaper thinks I work for

him. Trust me. Trust me.

Crazy !

LARSEN

They'll kill you !

LARSEN

Get in !

LARSEN

Get in!

LARSEN

WARTSCHUK

WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)

Delta three.

ANDY

What ?

ANDY

What ?

ANDY

This is all a big misunderstanding and... Excuse me, but

this is...

ANDY

You don't have to arrest us. Why is he arresting me ? This

is ridiculous. I'm an American citizen. Do you understand

what I'm saying ? Now, I'm a director.

ANDY

You know, I'm directing a movie here in Moscow. I'm

bringing a lot of money in this place.

ANDY

And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and...

Listen.

ANDY

You want money ? Is that what you want ?

ANDY

I don't understand what is going on here. We don't have a

diskette !

FAKE POLICEMAN # 1

You have one more chance to tell me where is diskette.

ANDY

The diskette. You know, I mean, this is ridiculous. We

don't have a diskette. That's what I'm saying.

ANDY

Karen, get the key ! Get the key ! Unlock me !

ANDY (voice over)

Find the key !

ANDY (voice over)

He's not gonna move, is he ? Okay, okay.

ANDY

Right. Let's get out of here.

WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)

Delta three. Delta three.

KAREN

Answer it.

ANDY

Why ?

KAREN

They may say something about Billy.

WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie)

Delta three.

ANDY (with an exaggerated deep voice)

Da.

ANDY

Da.

ANDY

Da.

KAREN

I got something about studio. Come on.

KAREN

Look out !

ANDY

Mmm... It's not what you think. What do you say ?... How do

you ?... In Russian, what ?...

ANDY

What ? What does that mean ?

KAREN

Hel...

ANDY

Hello ? We need help !

ANDY

I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a

movie.

ANDY

Put the gun away. You look like a hit man. He thinks we're

gonna kill him !

KAREN

We're not gonna kill you !

ANDY

This is not even ours !

KAREN

The policemen wanted to kill us !

KAREN

We gotta get out of here.

ANDY

Well, I think we should call the cops.

KAREN

Are you crazy ?

ANDY

Well, we can explain this.

KAREN

Explain ? You are crazy. Come on. Here.

ANDY

I'll take these too.

LARSEN

And now ?

LARSEN

Child locks.

LARSEN

Don't look now, but our friends are still here.

LARSEN

I will block the other entrances.

ANDY

What... what are you doing ? That... that's Red Square.

ANDY

Oh, perfect.

ANDY

This damn gun, I can't work the safety.

ANDY

Holy shit !

KAREN

Around the back.

KAREN

Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you.

ANDY

What ?

KAREN

I got you. I got you.

LARSEN

It's no use. All lines are cut.

LARSEN

Where is it ?

LARSEN

You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you.

WARTSCHUK

The Reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all

night and witnessed a live snuff.

WARTSCHUK

He wants you to do it.

LARSEN

You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you

die.

ANDY

Nice night, isn't it ?

ANDY

I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just...

KAREN

Who the hell is that ?

ANDY

Well, whoever it is, they're coming here.

ANDY

I can't work the safety.

KAREN

Andy, come on.

ANDY

Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

KAREN

Hurry !

THE REAPER

Where is she, Larsen ?

THE REAPER (voice over from the talkie)

Larsen, are you reading me ?

KAREN (whispering)

Somebody's coming.

ANDY (whispering)

I'm waiting.

LARSEN (answering The Reaper)

I'm bringing her out now.

KAREN

Shoot him. Shoot him, Andy.

ANDY

Okay.

KAREN

Be careful of Billy ! God.

KAREN (yelling)
