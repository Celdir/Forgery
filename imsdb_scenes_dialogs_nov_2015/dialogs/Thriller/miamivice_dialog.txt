FADE IN:

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

(low)

Burnett, what's crackin'?

CROCKETT

Nothing.

TUBBS

Maxin' and relaxin'.

NICHOLAS

(doesn't believe them)

Sure.  Change your mind; get

inclined?  Let me know...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

What's our deal?

TUBBS

Backup in case the Russians get

physical.

CROCKETT

How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?

TUBBS

Skin has to touch skin.  That's the

requirement for the warrant.  Then

he makes a credible excuse and he

stops....

(beat)

Her crew blackmailed and asset-

stripped the last mark down to his

social security...

GINA

This I gotta see...

(beat)

...the "make up an excuse and stop"

part.

CROCKETT

Have faith.

GINA

I have faith.  In horoscopes and

fortune cookies...

TUBBS

So?

GINA

Switek pulling this off...?  That's

not faith; that's delusional...

CUT TO:

TUBBS

Damn, girl...

TUBBS

This is exciting...

RICK

That's 'cause nothing is happening.

CROCKETT

No shit...?

FRANK

(it goes past him)

Yeah.  This is their

surveillance...how they video their

marks?  See, we jacked their fiber

optics, like we piggybacked their

signal.  Get it?

TUBBS

Cooool...

UGO

Runnin' the Biscayne 200?

TUBBS

If a coupla new exhaust manifolds

show up...

CROCKETT

Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or

Boodles.

BARTENDER

(Scandinavian accent)

Lemon or lime?

CROCKETT

Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics,

darlin'.  Where ya' from?

BARTENDER

(leaning in)

Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.

CROCKETT

You in Miami workin' on your

complexion...?

BARTENDER

(laughs)

No.  I was in Namibia...

CROCKETT

Doing...?

BARTENDER

With the United Nations High

Commission on Refugees.  Famine

relief.

CROCKETT

Really?  I did refugee relocation

in Somalia.  But they transferred

me out after I was wounded...

GINA

Only African he ever "relocated"

was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model

for Gucci, and he got wounded when

she took an NBA draft choice to the

Super Bowl instead of him...

TUBBS

He did volunteer one time...

TRUDY

(entering)

For a massage parlor bust?

(beat)

Why am I here...?

TUBBS

(low)

...to backup Switek.  But only if

it gets lethal.

TRUDY

That's impossible.

TUBBS

Why?

TRUDY

Because you cannot kill him.

TUBBS

And there's Dmitri...

CROCKETT

The honey trap.  And there's the

honey.

TUBBS

Hello, Miss Ukraine...

TRUDY

(to Crockett)

Eleven to seven he blows it.

CROCKETT

(whispers)

Twenty on my man...

TRUDY

You're giving away your money,

fool...

TUBBS

(to Zito)

You bet your partner?

ZITO

Sure.  Switek versus primal impulse

from the amygdala.  Higher thinking

versus the lizard brain.  Tectonic

plates of libido confront the

cognitive.

GINA

Oh, bullshit.  She cops his joint.

He pushes the button.

TRUDY

What's so fucking difficult?

CROCKETT

Yeah...?

STEVENS (O.S.)

Sonny...?

CROCKETT

Yeah.

STEVENS (O.S.)

Where's Riccardo?

CROCKETT

On the phone.

STEVENS (O.S.)

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...

CROCKETT

Who is this?

INTERCUT

WITH:

STEVENS

(voice cracks)

It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...

CROCKETT

(recognizing him)

Alonzo?

(beat)

What are you talking about?  Where

are you...?

STEVENS

They had me from the gate.

CROCKETT

I don't understand...

STEVENS

I gave up nothing on you guys.

Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico

out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're

on their own...it's all their deal,

anyway, so fuck 'em.

CROCKETT (O.S.)

Alonzo, what's goin' on?!

STEVENS

After I check on Francine and the

boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell

Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to

know...

CROCKETT

Where are you?

STEVENS (O.S.)

...look after her.  Ask Rico to.

Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do

it.  They had me from the gate.

Do that.  Whatever you can do for

them.  Okay?

(breaks)

Look what I did to them, Sonny...!

CROCKETT

Alonzo...!

STEVENS (O.S.)

Goodbye.

TUBBS

What is it?

CROCKETT

Alonzo...

TUBBS

Stevens?

CROCKETT

(nods)

Something's wrong.

TUBBS

(dialing)

I'll try Francine...

MACHINE VOICE

(recording)

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Our office hours are...

(Crockett punches three-

digit code)

FBI AGENT VOICE

F.B.I....

CROCKETT

(cuts him off)

This is Detective Crockett.  Miami-

Dade P.D.  Patch me through to your

Special Agent in Charge, James

Fujima?  It's an emergency...

FBI AGENT

He'll be in on Monday...

CROCKETT

I said, "emergency."  If he's not

reachable, who's running the

weekend?  The ASAC?

FBI AGENT

We don't give that out...

CROCKETT

Listen carefully.

CROCKETT (cont'd)

(into Nextel)

An informant who is working one of

YOUR cases right now called me.

YOU may have a problem.  So get me

somebody on the other end of this

telephone who knows what the hell

I'm talking about...!

TUBBS

(into phone)

C'mon...

VOICE (O.S.)

Miami-Dade PD Tech...

TUBBS

(into phone)

Bobby G.  The firefly we used to

have on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley,

check if it still runs; if so,

launch Air Support.  Locate the

Bentley...

(pause, listens)

I don't know...we haven't worked

with him for six months...

CROCKETT

(waits, then hears a click

on his Nextel)

Hello?

FUJIMA (O.S.)

This is Agent James Fujima.

CROCKETT

Detective Crockett.

FUJIMA (O.S.)

What's your Miami PD badge number?

CROCKETT

4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

FUJIMA (O.S.)

(pause)

Okay.  What's up?

CROCKETT

A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint

Interagency Task Force.  Name of

Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR

informant.  Stevens, called us.  I

haven't spoken to him for six

months.

I do not know what case you have

him on.  I do not know what he is

talking about.  But whatever he is

doing for you, it sounds like it is

going bad.  Right now...

FUJIMA

How do I discuss operations over an

open line?

CROCKETT

How do I know?

(beat)

I got the call from Alonzo on an

open line.  That is the hand we

have been dealt at this moment, at

eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday

night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert

you, here.

(beat)

You know whether or not...you have

a thing goin' down.  I do not.

(beat)

But we know this guy.  I think you

know this guy.  Normally, he is

cool.  Tonight he is distraught.

That is atypical.  That engenders

foreboding.  Do you understand the

meaning of the word "foreboding"?

As in badness is happening to your

deal right fucking now?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MEANWHILE:

FUJIMA

Guy's involved in a "meet"...

CROCKETT

"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"?

"Reverse undercover"?  What?

FUJIMA

Meet and greet.  "I flash you some

of mine, you flash me some of

yours?"

CROCKETT

And the deal goes down at another

place at another time.

FUJIMA

That's right.

CROCKETT

...so there's no industrial-

strength HRT weapons team out there

tonight?

FUJIMA

Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash

cash.

TUBBS

(into phone)

Haitian, Dominican, Russian,

Israeli?

FUJIMA

White supremacist types.

CROCKETT

OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders,

prison gangs?

FUJIMA

NLR, we think.  I wanna know...

TUBBS

(sarcastic)

Oh, good...

FUJIMA

...what else, what else did he

indicate to you?  I need to know

everything he said.

CROCKETT

He is saying they had him from the

gate.  He is saying to my partner

and I and to his family "goodbye."

What does that tell you?

CUT TO:

SWITEK

(keys radio; too much

static, tries cell phone)

Sonny, we got him...

CUT TO:

RUSSIAN #1

...sample now is okay.  And we want

sample load when we do deal...

ARYAN BROTHER

Sure, man.

RUSSIAN #1

What inventory you can supply...?

ARYAN BROTHER #1

Meth.  Glass, ice, K's, E's,

Mitsu's, Ames, Ex...whatever you

need.  Coke?  Tonnage.  And

Colombian H.  But give us a heads

up...

ARYAN BROTHER #1 (cont'd)

Ice.  Spectra-analyze that shit.

And party-on with the coke.  You

are looking at ninety-two percent

pure...none of that jumped-on

powder they sell up in New

Yorioo...

ARYAN BROTHER #2

Yeah...

(beat)

Now, let's see the green...

RUSSIAN

Never seen money before?  This is

called "money."

ARYAN BROTHER #1

Okay.  You got lotsa green.  We got

all the goodies.  We party.

Larry'll call you in the AM and

talk money, quantity, time and

place...

ARYAN BROTHER

Hey, Ivan!  I forgot to ask you

something, my brother...

ARYAN BROTHER (cont'd)

...they have a decent death-benefit

program in the FBI?

CUT TO:

TUBBS

(incensed, over traffic

noise)

What the hell did you do?

STEVENS

The Feeb gig was I front a coupla

undercover, Russian-speakers to

them.  One's ATF.  And broker the

deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR

types...

STEVENS (cont'd)

(shouts)

So I gave them up, man!  Gave up

the Feds!  Gave up everything

I knew.  Now I got to go home...

CROCKETT

How'd they get onto you?

STEVENS

How do I know?  But it was from the

get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me

into them.

(beat)

Sonny, I gotta go...!

MEANWHILE:

TRUDY

(after changing channel)

Hello, Sonny...?

STEVENS

(to Tubbs)

I gotta, I gotta go...!

TUBBS

Alonzo...

STEVENS

What...?

TUBBS

(voice cracks)

Alonzo, you don't need to go home.

STEVENS

They said they wouldn't hurt them,

wouldn't hurt them if...

TUBBS

They lied.

CROCKETT

They been known to do that...

TUBBS

Yeah.

CASTILLO (V.O.)

What's your twenty?

TUBBS

Quarter mile away.  We see the

lights...

CASTILLO (V.O.)

Turn around.

TUBBS

(taking cell)

We know these people...!

CASTILLO

Grieve elsewhere.

CUT TO:

FUJIMA

We're not certain...

CASTILLO

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

FUJIMA

We're not certain!

TUBBS

C'mon, man!

FUJIMA

We think NLR.  We don't know!

Alonzo only fronted as a broker for

our guys to make the meet.  He

wasn't deep into the crew.

CROCKETT

White gangs...?  It doesn't track.

TUBBS

White gangs is tweakers and a

crystal meth lab in a trailer park.

Bounce around the old lady Saturday

night and get your recidivist ass

busted back...

FUJIMA

Not anymore.  This is a distribution

network out of South Florida,

moving poly-drug loads, crystal

meth through coke, to Nashville,

Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And

computer fraud, identity theft.

It's like that.

CASTILLO

(to the point)

Tell them what you want.

FUJIMA

They knew about Alonzo, before he

made a move on them.  They had our

operation.  They've cut into us.

CROCKETT

How?

FUJIMA

We don't know.

TUBBS

Break your encryption?  Hack your e-

mail?  Employee databases?

Somebody on the inside?

FUJIMA

We don't know.  And that's the

point.  Maybe there's a mole.

Whatever, it's a disaster.  And

it's a Joint Interagency Task

Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S.

Customs components in on it.  So

the penetration could be from any

one agency.  What we do know is I

have to suspend operations right

now from undercover work through

interdictions 'cause I have to

assume our Operational Security is

blown.

TUBBS

As in, your ass is dead in the

water.

FUJIMA

But Miami PD wasn't part of the

J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said,

he didn't give you up.

CROCKETT

So what do you want?

FUJIMA

To recruit you.

CASTILLO

...I didn't want you around the

crime scene because it's crawling

with federal law enforcement.  We

don't know who's straight up, who's

not...

CROCKETT

Recruit us to do what?

FUJIMA

Get into business with this crew,

identify them.  Illuminate their

network.  If you're lucky, discover

their source, how they penetrated

us.  We'll indict and take it from

there...

CROCKETT

How do we do that?  Make a buy?

(wry)

That went well...

TUBBS

Reverse undercover?  WE supply to

them?

FUJIMA

They got a steady stream of supply.

So, no...

CROCKETT

From whom...?

FUJIMA

A Colombian producer.  Named

Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.

CROCKETT

Never heard of him.

FUJIMA

From the North Valle area.  New.

Low-level, we think.

TUBBS

Aryan brothers are not going to

change-up suppliers.  So...

CROCKETT

Transpo?  How they bringing the

loads in...?

FUJIMA

They're not.  They collect in

Miami.  Montoya, the producer,

handles deliveries.  That's his

end, and he varies the routes.  We

got some FLIR off an AWAC of a

coupla go-fast boats, on one run,

that's all.

TUBBS

Track with me, here...

(beat)

They knew the "Russians" were

undercover Feeb?  They should have

no-showed.  But, no, these guys

show anyway, and commit murder upon

federal officers.  And steal all

your money...

(beat; to Fujima)

What does that say to you?

CROCKETT

(speculating)

It says, "We do not fear you."

(to Fujima)

It says, "Fuck off and die."  It

says, "We get down for

recreation..."

CROCKETT (cont'd)

Blow that up...

TUBBS

(to Crockett)

So?

CROCKETT

We could try to run loads into

these guys.

(to Fujima)

Run a few loads for Montoya into

South Florida.  Into this group.

FUJIMA

You need to consider a few issues.

CASTILLO

(to Crockett + Tubbs)

...you'd be operating outside

territorial United States.  Your

badges do not count.  You have no

authorization to carry weapons.  If

you're busted, it could take a long

time to get you re-patriated.  And

there's no backup...

(to Fujima)

And you will share with them all

your intel on Montoya...

FUJIMA

Sure.

CASTILLO

I mean full disclosure.

FUJIMA

Of course.  From my side, I don't

WANT to know anything about what

you're doing or how you do it...

(to Castillo)

So let me know if we're on...

CASTILLO

(to Tubbs)

About the Stevens family, I'm

sorry.  I know you were close to

them.

TUBBS

I was the kids' godfather.

CASTILLO

(intuits)

And...?

TUBBS

"And" what?

CASTILLO

I got to know.  There is never any

room for "personal"...

CROCKETT

(for Tubbs)

He is fine.  And we know the jokes.

When it gets vengeful, things get

messy.  When they get messy the

wrong people die...

(beat)

Everybody gets it.

CASTILLO

Good.

TUBBS

And the answer is "yes."

(beat)

Before she met Alonzo, once upon a

time, a long time ago.

(beat)

You bet it was personal.

CASTILLO

Okay.

(to Crockett)

What'd you spot...?

CROCKETT

Three wakes off the back of those

boats.  Who runs three Sterling

engines off a deep-V hull?

TUBBS

Sal Maguda.

CASTILLO

He any good?

TUBBS

Oh, yeah...

CASTILLO

So what's gonna persuade Montoya to

change off Sal Maguda running his

deliveries...?

CUT TO:

BASTIDE

Odile, she say they're pregnant...

TUBBS

Yeah?  Okay.  Only Jean-Louis and I

do the talking...

CUT TO:

TUBBS

Comme on dit...

(Like they said...)

JEAN-LOUIS

Charger et les recoit d'ici...

(Load 'em up and get out of

here...)

BAD GUY

You crazy?  Que fais-tu?

TUBBS

Que faisons-nous?  De qu'a-t-il

l'air, fou!  Nous voulons tous

votre drugs.

(What are we doing?  What's it look

like we're doing, fool?  We are

stealing all your dope.)

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

(in the phone)

Hey, Sailor...

(pause)

Yeah, I'm good.

(beat)

Got a hole in the

calendar...looking to charge up the

cash flow.

(waits)

Yeah, later.

TUBBS

(into phone)

Hey, Nicholas, my ace.  Wha's up?

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

You know.  Same old...

TUBBS

(into phone)

We got idle all of an instant.  You

got something from somewhere that's

got to go someplace, somewhen,

which is not too distantly in the

future...?

NICHOLAS

It is fortuitous that you called...

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

We're from Nicholas to meet Jose...

JOSE YERO

(extends hand)

Jose...

CROCKETT

Sonny Burnett...this is my partner,

Rico.

JOSE YERO

Sit.

CROCKETT

(to Security)

Dos cafe.

TUBBS

So lay it out, my brother...

JOSE YERO

Nicholas said you okay.  That's

nice.  But how I know if you any

good?

CROCKETT

What...?

JOSE YERO

Who you run loads for?  Cause other

than Nicholas, you knows you?

CROCKETT

(dark)

My mommy and daddy know me.

TUBBS

And we didn't come down here to

audition.  Business auditions for

us...

(beat)

...and know who we are and know

they want their load run by us

before Nicholas calls.

CROCKETT

That way we do not waste AvGas or

our motherfucking time.

CROCKETT (cont'd)

(goes right up in Yero's

face)

You want to "know" shit?  Who the

fuck are you?  You got a side deal

with U.S. Customs to open up the

coast in a few spots...in exchange

you flip them some gringo runners?

Like us...?

TUBBS

You wearing a wire?

CROCKETT

Or DEA?  The Feeb?

TUBBS

People gonna walk into this place

and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some

crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild!

Is that a Jackson Pollack?"

CROCKETT

"No, viejo.  That was Jose Yero,

splattered all over his

motherfucking wall."

TUBBS

So we can close each other's eyes

right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.

(pause)

But, then, nobody makes any

money...

JOSE YERO

(flat)

Equipment?

TUBBS

Slow and low, Adam A-500s...

(Yero looks quizzical)

...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400

nautical-mile range, thousand ki

payload...all the way to Caravels

and 727's from a source country to

a transshipment point.  Small

freighters.  We've done

containers...

CROCKETT

And specialize in very fast go-fast

boats for coastal runs.

TUBBS

What kind of weight?

JOSE YERO

We don't talk weight.  We talk

logistics.

JOSE YERO (cont'd)

You get longs and lats for the

pickup.  Open ocean.  You run it

in.  On shore, our people receive

the loads.

CROCKETT

(interrupts)

The people on shore who handle a

load we run are our people, not your

people.  No tweakers, dopers, first-

timers we don't know.  They didn't

do time with us, they ain't doing

crime with us.

TUBBS

What you get from us is a date.  A

place.  "In the parking lot of a

Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At

such-and-such time, an eighteen-

wheeler will be there.  Keys in the

ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick

it up.  And you drive it...

(waves his left hand)

...away.

CROCKETT

Money thing is done in advance in

places where there are no guns.

Because when money and guns get

together, there is violence...

JOSE YERO

You afraid of violence?

CROCKETT

I am not John Wayne.  There is no

"S" on his chest.  We get down if

the play calls for it.  But we are

into business and making money.

TUBBS

And violence is extra.  And

expensive.  So how much weight you

looking to move?

JOSE YERO

Nothing.  'Cause how you do

delivery on the beach, I don't

like.  Maybe this does not work.

CROCKETT

Then it don't work.

TUBBS

What happened to the last

transporter you had?

JOSE YERO

What do you care?

TUBBS

(to Crockett)

Do we need this...?

CROCKETT

(rises)

Red light, green light, Jose?

JOSE YERO

(doesn't answer, leans

back)

I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That

means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I

enforce security and get people to

tell me what I need to know.  That

part of what I do, you never want

to find out about.

(pause)

Other people will negotiate the

money and go or not go.  Not me...

TUBBS

Then what were we talking to you

for?

JOSE YERO

I had to lay eyes on you.

CROCKETT

And...?

JOSE YERO

(to Tubbs)

You seem okay.

(to Tubbs re: Crockett)

But him?  I don't like... how he

looks...

TUBBS

What do I care what you think about

how he looks?  You wanna fuck my

partner or do business?

JOSE YERO

Wait by the phone.

(pause)

You get a call.  Or maybe you

don't.  Until then, piss off back

to where you come from...

CUT TO:

TUBBS

...Sonny can wait.

TUBBS

Anything?

CROCKETT

Nothing.

GINA

(beat)

"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."

CROCKETT

Hi, Gina.

(putting shopping bag on

table)

This is from Frick and Frack.

Trudy?

TUBBS

(re:  bag)

What do we got?

CROCKETT

Satellite.  New encryption.

Supposedly sharper than the G...

(to Gina)

How good's our background?

GINA

You're so not the PD, if you got

busted on a DUI, you're in serious

trouble...you're bad men back to

grammar school.

(to Tubbs)

San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.

(to Crockett)

Marine Corps.  Statesville.

Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked

up.  Now you're too smart and too

fast to get jacked again...

CROCKETT

How will it stand up?

GINA

If they ran the rental car or lease

on this place...even if it's EPIC

database in El Paso...they'd have

to work through the layers of

bullshit three weeks deep.  Then

they'd find your deeper, hidden

criminal selves...

GINA

(Lazily)

What am I supposed to do after I

get my nails and hair done...?

TUBBS

Reality TV and stay by the phone.

That's what all wives-in-crime

do...

GINA

Be...careful...  You hear me?

CUT TO:

TUBBS

Where we meeting 'em...?

CROCKETT

Port-Au-Prince.

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

What do we got?

TUBBS

Five minutes...

TUBBS (cont'd)

...show time.

DISSOLVE

TO:

DISSOLVE

TO:

TUBBS

They watching us watching them

watching us waiting for them?  Or

what?

CROCKETT

Who knows...

TUBBS

That's it.

CUT TO:

ISABELLA (O.S.)

(to Crockett)

Put your guns on the table...

(enters, sits)

If we wanted you dead, you would no

longer be drawing breath in Miami.

We wouldn't have brought you all

the way here.

CROCKETT

Really?  So, what is this, a party?

TUBBS

We'll have room service wipe up the

furniture...and bring drinks.

CROCKETT

Glad we came.  This place is a lot

of fun if you're Doctors Without

Borders.  So...?

ISABELLA

I run down the numbers.  Nothing is

very negotiable.  Small loads?  We

pay three thousand a ki.

We pay your fuel costs up front

plus ten percent.  The next ten

percent on U.S. landfall.

TUBBS

Define small.

ISABELLA

Two, three thousand a ki.

Two thousand ki's, your end is

$6,000,000.

(beat)

Complex transshipments or dealing

with containers, these have front-

loaded costs we pickup.

(beat)

For this kind of weight, the

balance of 80% is when our buyer

picks up the load.

(beat)

Transactions are offshore.  Dollars

or euros.  Secure internet

transfers.  We have lists of Cayman

and Isle of Man banks infiltrated

by IRS, to be avoided...

(beat)

No transactions of cash or other

banking instruments take place on

U.S. soil...

(beat)

That's the deal.

CROCKETT

I thought we had to meet the Man.

ISABELLA

You do.

CROCKETT

When?

ISABELLA

Right now.

MONTOYA

Please take that seat on the

side...

TUBBS

Thank you.

MONTOYA

(polite, friendly)

Excuse me because I am very busy

and have many things to do, so this

will be brief.  Yes?

(beat; not waiting)

We will try you on a "run."  One.

To build trust.  We do a thousand

kis.  In all matters, when you work

for us, you must do exactly what

you say you will do.

(beat)

In this business with me, if you

say you will do a thing, you must

do exactly that thing.

(beat)

Then?  You will prosper beyond your

dreams and you can live in Miami in

millionaire style.

(beat)

If you are arrested, there will be

lawyers made available to you in

the United States.  You will use

them.  Anything you need, you will

be provided by me.  It cost you

nothing.  You will contact and work

through Jose Yero on logistics and

communications.  To do with money,

you will work through my wife,

Isabella...

MONTOYA (cont'd)

More than I, in finance and

business, she is very dangerous.  I

look forward to our doing work

together.  Whether we do or not, it

is unlikely we will meet again.  So

I extend my best wishes to your

families...

(to Tubbs)

Particularly to your beautiful

wife.

(beat)

Thank you for making this long trip

to see me...

TUBBS

(low)

...who did we just meet?

GINA (O.S.)

Hello...?

TUBBS

You okay?

GINA

Yeah.

TUBBS

You sure?

GINA

Yes.  What's up?

TUBBS

Nothing.  Calling to say hi...

What's up with you?

INTERCUT WITH:

GINA

Bored.

TUBBS

Okay...see you soon.

GINA

...and thanks for the flowers.

TUBBS

What flowers?

GINA

The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred

dollars worth of roses...yellow.

TUBBS

There a note?

GINA

You mean with the flowers...?

TUBBS

What's it say?

GINA

"Salutations from the south..."

GINA (cont'd)

I...I thought it was from you.

TUBBS

We're on our way...

TUBBS (O.S.)

(forced casual)

So why don't you...meet the

plane...

GINA

(cool)

Okay.

TUBBS

Good idea.

(beat)

We'll grab a bite.

CUT TO:

GINA

...the lease, the phones, the

cars...layers of false ident.

Would take the FBI weeks.  How long

did it take them?  Three hours?

Four?

(re:  the note)

This means, "We can reach out and

touch somebody."  Like Bad

Teleflora.

TUBBS

(cuts in)

...even if they could run the

identities you built to EPIC, all

they'll find is more cover...

Trust what you built.  It's

quality, girl.  We're cool...

GINA

(leans in; holds his hand

tighter)

...you are trying to reassure me

because you know when people get

anxious, they make mistakes.

You're worried about me.  Do not

be.

(into his eyes)

I am careful.  I am cool.  I got

Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry

about you.  Because you are the

ones who are in denied territory,

not me.  If your focus is on me,

you'll miss something coming at

you.  That's how people slip up.

Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything

happened.  You worry about you.

You and Sonny...are in the

dangerous place.  I'm fine...

GINA (cont'd)

(loud)

Fuck 'em.  They sent us some

flowers.  Big deal.  Thanks for the

flowers...

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

We set.

TUBBS

To the limit.

CROCKETT

You worried about the tree line, US

Customs AWACS, or something else on

your mind?

TUBBS

Like...?

CROCKETT

Gina in the Miami pad.

(no answer)

You gonna give me phony denials?

TUBBS

No.

(beat)

You gonna give me phony

reassurances?

CROCKETT

No.

TUBBS

Good.  So let's go...

CROCKETT (O.S.)

(into radio)

Transglobal Airlines flight zero-

zero-zero...is in the air...

ZITO (V.O.)

Roger that.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you have a

visual on another aircraft...?

ZITO

Negative, Opa-Locka.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

Opa-Locka Air Traffic Control to

JIT 0-seven-six-Nellie-Charlie...

AWAC (V.O.)

Hello, Opa-Locka.  What's up?

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

I've got an Aero Commander coming

in on a two-seventy-nine heading,

but I had a double image...like

there's another plane there, now

I'm only picking up on one.  What

do you read?

RADAR OFFICER

Let me see...

AWAC RADAR OFFICER

(into mic)

Too many Mai Tais at lunch...

You're seeing double.  One blip.

One plane.

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Neptune gonna show?

JEAN-LOUIS

Oh, he'll show.  This is his kind

of deal.  Crime on crime.  Who's

gonna call the cops?

CROCKETT

(skeptical)

Usually his thing is street

dealers.  Torture their families

until they cough up the stash.

This...?

JEAN-LOUIS

He's ambitious.

TUBBS

Heads up...

TUBBS (cont'd)

That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's

worth more than the real estate.

But no one's supposed to notice his

drive-by?

CROCKETT

Here's another incognito genius...

TRUDY

April Fool, motherfucker.

TUBBS

(Patois)

Arrete!  Arrete!  Freeze!

(to one)

Et vous, mo-fo!

JEAN-LOUIS

(in French)

Get the fuck in the truck...!

CUT TO:

JOSE YERO (O.S.)

Client got delivery.  But there

were..."extras" in the back of the

truck.

CROCKETT

"Extras" tried to relieve us of

your weight...

(beat)

And by the by, you know of a player

in Overtown who goes by the name of

"Things Aquatic"?

JOSE YERO

I do.  We don't do business with

him...

CROCKETT

He tried to..."do business"...with

you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be

there.

JOSE YERO

I'll be there.

CROCKETT

Look familiar?

TUBBS

This the load you lost a while

back?

JOSE YERO

It is.  He try to take tonight's

load?

CROCKETT

Yeah.

JOSE YERO

And what do I do with him?

TUBBS

(shrugs)

Whatever you want.  Like we said,

we're not into violence.

CUT TO:

JOSE YERO

(suspicious)

I walk into Neptune's house...very

nice.  But I also see you... and

our drugs that got ripped from

Maguda.

TUBBS

You don't like us finding your

load?  We can go and lose it all

over again...

CROCKETT

How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know

where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op

sec's got a leak?  Yours?

JOSE YERO

What'd Neptune tell you?

CROCKETT

He didn't.  Interrogation's not in

our skill set.

(beat)

So c'mon, what suspicions have you

master-minded off these

associations?

JOSE YERO

(whispers in Spanish to

Isabella)

Here's what this is...ask how much

they want to turn back to us our

load...

ISABELLA

We want it back.

CROCKETT

Okay.

ISABELLA

What's the recovery?  How much are

you looking for?

TUBBS

(to Crockett)

How much we looking for?

CROCKETT

Nothing.

ISABELLA

What's "nothing"?

CROCKETT

Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

TUBBS

And as an investment in the

future...

ISABELLA

(takes off her glasses and

looks at Crockett)

"Future" of...?

CROCKETT

A fine...business...relationship...

TUBBS

It's yours cause what's yours, is

yours.  And what's ours is ours...

(to Yero)

...like the second ten-percent,

which is now due, Yero, my ace.

TUBBS (cont'd)

What's up next?  Or is this a one-

time deal?

ISABELLA

(to Yero)

Give them the shipment on the

seventeenth...

TUBBS

Conveyance?

ISABELLA

Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.

TUBBS

(to Yero)

Lay it out...

CROCKETT

(low)

There is one thing you can do for

me in recognition of the death-

defying risks we took to recover

your product...

ISABELLA

(low)

And what is that?

CROCKETT

Let me buy you a drink.

ISABELLA

(low)

What do you like to drink?

CROCKETT

(low)

I'm a fiend for mojitas.

ISABELLA

(low)

How fast does that go?

CROCKETT

It goes very fast.

ISABELLA

Show me...?

TUBBS

Can I talk to you for a second,

partner...?

TUBBS (cont'd)

(low, re:  Isabella)

Wha's up...?

CROCKETT

(low)

I know what I'm doing.

TUBBS

...secure satellite comms.

encrypted e-mail, the longs and

lats for the transshipment

point...all that?  It's all cool.

But I need a vector, not a

location.  'Cause ships move.

That's why they call them ships.

Ship stops?  It's trying to be an

apartment building.  At sea that

attracts attention.  That's bad...

CROCKETT

(through headset)

So where's the best place for

mojitas?

ISABELLA

Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the only

place for mojitas...

CROCKETT

Where's that?

ISABELLA

Off a little alley with

cobblestones.  Hemingway went

there...

CROCKETT

The Keys?

ISABELLA

Havana.

CROCKETT

Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my

business...

ISABELLA

Are you afraid?

(smiles; Crockett shakes

his head "no")

Good.  And you don't need a visa.

Cause you're with me.

CROCKETT

Light touch.  Everything comes to

you through the wheel.

CROCKETT (cont'd)

How do we get into Cuba?!

ISABELLA

My cousin is the harbor master.

You must not bring in drugs.  You

cannot be armed.  If you're

carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it

inside.  No one will go near your

boat...

CROCKETT

You do business in Cuba with your

husband?

ISABELLA

I never do business in Cuba.

(beat)

And nobody goes to Cuba but me.

(smiles)

And he is not my husband...

CROCKETT

Were you born in Havana?

ISABELLA

Angola.  My mother was being a

surgeon there.  She volunteered.

Mozambique and Mali, too...

(over the wind)

...those days, in those days...she

was part of Cuba's gift to the

third world.  She came from a

bourgeois family with a house in

Verdado...we still have the house.

We will go there...

CROCKETT

Where's she now?

ISABELLA

She's dead...

CROCKETT

Your father?

ISABELLA

Angolan Military.  Went back to the

fighting.  Disappeared.  Who

knows...?

ISABELLA (cont'd)

Go ahead and ask...

CROCKETT

How's he not your husband?

ISABELLA

I am no one's wife.  I live in my

own house.  I do not live in a

man's house.  He has a wife.  We

are together.  I am free.  Because

of banking and finance and travel...

(looks at him, shouts over

wind)

And I can do anything I want...

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

(shouts over noise)

Mojitas...?

ISABELLA

(shouting back)

Later!  Do you dance?

CROCKETT

I dance...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

My aunt.  She's ancient.  She looks

after the place...

(beat)

This was my mother's family's

home...

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

Tell me everything.

CROCKETT

No.

ISABELLA

I insist.

CROCKETT

(flip)

Okay.

(beat)

Macon, Georgia is where I was born.

Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I

was 14.  Then the military.  Then

prison.  Because I was dumb and

angry.  Then I read.  Then I got

smart.  Then I discovered what I

know, now...it's all business...

CROCKETT (cont'd)

(to Bartender)

My friend, two more.

(beat)

What was your mother's name...?

ISABELLA

Blanca...a rubio like you.

(pause)

I see her in a dress...an old

photograph from Lucinda somebody's

wedding...everybody is with

couples.  Husbands and wives.  They

all pose.  My mother is alone

because my father had to go back to

the fighting.

(she points)

...she looks right into the camera.

She is the most beautiful woman in

the room.  By herself.  In a party

dress.  And she looked like she

knew she would die alone...

(beat...remembers)

She spoke many languages.  We were

in Luanda when she died.  I went to

her friends in Mali.  They sent me

to the Ecole Polytechnique in

Geneva to study mathematics, where

I met Montoya in the discos.  He

had banking there...I was seventeen

and very much into the clubs.  And

he sent me to University for an MBA

in Finance.

(pause)

Your mother?

CROCKETT

Died in childbirth, having me...

ISABELLA

To mothers.  And all that we owe

them...

CROCKETT

You know how improbable this is...?

ISABELLA

"Probable"...applies to an event

that may be real.  Doesn't apply

here.

CROCKETT

...'cause we have no future...are

of today and not tomorrow.

ISABELLA

(laughs)

That's right.

CROCKETT

...and therafore there is no

consequence?

ISABELLA

Exactly.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

(soft)

Let's talk deliveries.

CROCKETT (cont'd)

...and a different kind of deal.

ISABELLA

Like...?

CROCKETT

Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's

nice.

And I can supply the transportation

into South Florida and the Gulf,

more reliable and on-time than

FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK

for openers.

ISABELLA

And why should continuing

excellence cost more?

CROCKETT

Cost less.  That's the point.

ISABELLA

Is it December?

CROCKETT

What do you mean?

ISABELLA

Did Christmas come early this

year...?

CROCKETT

Better than that.

(beat)

We become partners.  Only in this

territory and only on loads we run.

And you don't pay us three thousand

a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we

get is thirty percent of the load.

Product or cash.  "And why," you're

thinking, "would I be crazy enough

to out in these gringos like that?

Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love?

Too many mojitas?"  And the answer

is, "of course" but also "no.  It

is because Sonny can deliver what

no one else can."

ISABELLA

Good samba dancing...?

CROCKETT

Zero risk.

ISABELLA

'Cause you don't lose loads?

CROCKETT

'Cause we guarantee every load.

(beat)

Anywhere, for any reason, it comes

up short, we make good.  Your

operations will, from now on, run

risk-free.

ISABELLA

And you're our thirty-percent

partner?

ISABELLA (cont'd)

(deadly seriously)

What if I tell you that your ideas

are too big for your skin?

(beat)

That merely to propose this is a

dangerous thing?

CROCKETT

Then I would say to you, this has

been fun...

ISABELLA

The range should be between fifteen

and seventeen-point-five percent of

the P.O.E....to even consider it.

CROCKETT

I need thirty.  Calculate in, also,

the cash you don't have to front...

ISABELLA

Available cash is not an issue for

us...

CROCKETT

Twenty-eight-point-five.

ISABELLA

What if I pushed to twenty-one...?

CROCKETT

I would say you're...

(hesitates; holds up four

fingers)

...four percentage points away from

a deal...

ISABELLA

Maybe I'm only one.

CROCKETT

We'll do it at twenty-two...

CROCKETT (cont'd)

...and now what?

ISABELLA

And now I make you breakfast

again...

CUT TO:

TUBBS (V.O.)

Where the hell are you, man?

CROCKETT

(into phone)

On my way back...

CUT TO:

TUBBS

(mutters)

The meet with Castillo and the fed

got set up.  It's in 45 minutes...

GINA

What's up, Sonny...?

TUBBS

Where'd you go?

CROCKETT

Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell

back to her place.

TUBBS

Where?

CROCKETT

Verdado.

TUBBS

Verdado where?

CROCKETT

It's in the suburbs outside Havana.

TUBBS

Havana, Cuba...?

CROCKETT

No.  Havana, Louisiana.

(beat)

Don't we have a meet?

TUBBS

...where you're makin' a move on

the wife of Archangel de Jesus

Montoya?

CROCKETT

No.

TUBBS

You're not makin' a move on her...?

CROCKETT

We're makin' moves on each other.

TUBBS

Oh, that makes it okay, then.

CUT TO:

FUJIMA

Who said, "go exploring"?  We want

this staying on track.

CROCKETT

(to Fujima)

Who's the "we"?  There's you and

there's us.  And all we got from

you was bad intel.  "Low-level

producer."  Yeah, right...

FUJIMA

What are you talking about?

CROCKETT

Montoya.  We went to meet the

village priest.  It turns into

Alice in the fucking Vatican and

here's the Pope...of the North

Valle Colombia dope trade.

TUBBS

His operations are kingpin size and

first-class.  His security is ex-

Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis.

Their comms are satellite uplink

with mainframe encryption,

significant Sig Int and in their

zones of activity, they have signal-

jamming capability...

CROCKETT

Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...

TUBBS

And what does that level of

spending on first-class, private-

sector infrastructure signify to

you?

CROCKETT

Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...

FUJIMA

Out of...?

CROCKETT

Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money

through Dubai and Geneva maybe.

TUBBS

Their loads are poly-drug.  "E"

from Holland, methamphetamine

precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H."

Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real

business is:  he's a network.

CROCKETT

And we can illuminate part of it

from the inside out.

TUBBS

So we want to change-up the mission

statement.

FUJIMA

(no)

Identify and indict the white

supremacist group of importers.

End of story.  Everything else I'm

hearing is speculation masquerading

as intel...

FUJIMA (cont'd)

What's this?

CROCKETT

Keys to the boat.  Go do this

motherfucker yourself.

FUJIMA

Who are you talking to?

TUBBS

He's talking to you, bro.

(beat)

What he means to say is he is

reluctant to abandon the

penetration of a major

narcotrafficking organization...

CROCKETT

(re: Fujima)

Hey, fuck him.

TUBBS

Chill out Sonny.

CROCKETT

We're the ones doing the death-

defying shit?  And he wants us to

give that up?  For what?

A chump-change bust so he can get

his picture in The Miami Herald to

impress the slug farm in DC...

FUJIMA

(to Castillo)

Control your men.

CROCKETT

I'm my own man.  And anytime you

want to see how much man I am?

CASTILLO

(low)

That's.  It.

CASTILLO (cont'd)

(to Tubbs)

Where are you on this?

TUBBS

With Sonny.  110%.

CASTILLO

Then that's it.

(to Fujima)

Change the mission statement.

Crockett stays in.  He keeps

working up the ladder.  The

local importers get a pass for the

time being.

FUJIMA

I don't know.

CASTILLO

Yes you do...

FUJIMA

I got to talk to my ADO...

CASTILLO

No, you don't, Jim.

(beat)

'Cause if I close this down, you

got nothing to make a phone call

about.  And my guys don't have a

week for a Feeb bureaucratic

process.  Every hour longer they're

in there, they risk exposure.  So,

right here, right now, they're back

in or I pull them out and close you

down.  What's it going to be?

FUJIMA

Okay.

CASTILLO

(to Crockett)

You fuckin' better be right...!

CUT TO:

TUBBS

(low)

What is going on...?!

CROCKETT

As in...?

TUBBS

There is "undercover."  And there

is "Which way is up?"

CROCKETT

You think I am in so deep I forgot?

TUBBS

I am asking.  You to me.

CROCKETT

Do you believe...I have forgotten I

am a cop?

TUBBS

I would never doubt you.

TUBBS (cont'd)

And do you doubt I will slot anyone

complicit in the death of Maria,

Alonzo and those children?

Anyone...whoever they are...

CROCKETT

No, I do not.

ISABELLA (O.S.)

...90- and 120-day futures with

shorted Canadian and US dollars...

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

...and we're looking at Nigerian

crude...

MONTOYA

Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura

and Ju'aymah?

ISABELLA

Transshipped to a Malaysian

container ship.

MONTOYA

Not French registry?

ISABELLA

They've been targeted.  And

Pakistani registry is too

vulnerable to search and seizure

right now.

MONTOYA

Jose doesn't like the deal in South

Florida...

ISABELLA

(cuts in)

Burnett?

(shrugs)

They want 22% of the value on loads

they run into South Florida.  It's

the Juarez cartel model.

They guarantee the loads.  The

upside is our risk goes to zero.

That frees-up capital.

MONTOYA

But what does your intuition tell

you...?

ISABELLA

My "intuition"...?  My intuition

made him breakfast the other

morning in Havana.

MONTOYA

And...?

ISABELLA

They're serious.  They're cautious.

They'll forgo a deal over a

technicality of how a delivery's

handled...they'd walk away, rather

than compromise operational

security...that's good.

ISABELLA (cont'd)

But they have to be watched

closely...

MONTOYA

Why?

ISABELLA

A good deal, like this with us, for

Burnett will be good only

temporarily.  He'll get restless

because he believes nothing is

forever.  Life is dust, make it

while you can.  He's ambitious.

ISABELLA (cont'd)

So I predict a few good runs.  Then

there'll be a renegotiation.

MONTOYA

That's my girl...

MONTOYA (cont'd)

On the next load, Jose wants to

front them silver.  But they them in

lead...

(beat)

He thinks they are wrong.  What do

you think?

ISABELLA

(revealing nothing)

I think Jose suspects anybody he

doesn't intimidate.  And people,

who are good at what they do?  They

have egos, too...

MONTOYA

(careful)

What would you do...?

ISABELLA

(equally careful)

I like the diminished risk.  It

frees up capital reserves.  I like

working with self-interested

businessmen who are competent.  You

can predict their behavior....

ISABELLA (cont'd)

On the other hand...if what you

wish, mi corazon, is la

plumba...the lead?  Then let's do

that.  Accept their deal.  After

the load is received...we will

close their eyes forever...

MONTOYA

Let's try a few runs with these

partners, I think.  I will tell

Jose...

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Hola, chica.

ISABELLA

Hola, viejo.

ISABELLA (CONT'D)

Don't stop, bad man...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MONTOYA

(to an Assistant)

Do you have him?

MONTOYA (cont'd)

Jose, about the Americans...

INTERCUT

WITH:

JOSE YERO

(in Spanish)

They are "wrong."  I do not trust

them.

MONTOYA (V.O.)

(in Spanish)

Why?

JOSE YERO

(in Spanish)

Too good at what they do, I don't

know.  Something I don't like.

They are wrong...

MONTOYA (V.O.)

(in Spanish)

Isabella likes them.  We made their

deal.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOSE YERO

Transshipment point is here at

17:00 hours on the 23rd.

TUBBS

Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and

times to meet.  Give me their

heading and radio codes and I will

talk to them directly with the

longs and lats and time which will

be a last minute deal...

JOSE YERO

You give yours to me.  We position

all the assets hauling our loads...

CROCKETT

Now how we do it, blood.  It risks

signal interception and other bad

things like people who don't need

to know where we're at knowing.

TUBBS

At ten to three on the 27th, I will

satellite page him with a website

and encryption code.  He will have

ten minutes to log on and receive

his new heading.  Ten minutes and

thirty seconds, website disappears

and he can drive his fucking boat

up to Iceland...

JOSE YERO

Malaysian registry.  Small

containership.

(to El Tiburon)

Give them their codes and heading.

CROCKETT

Packaging?

JOSE YERO

Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A

hundred kilos in each.  You

transship that to the Malaysian

boat.

TUBBS

Importation value?  At twenty-two

thousand a ki...

JOSE YERO

You work that out with La Senora.

(beat)

You will get sixteen fuel bladders

of crystal meth precursors from the

Malaysian ship.  For collection in

North Miami.  You warehouse it.

Release it when we say.

(beat)

I'm sure you have friends with fast

boats...

CROCKETT

If you see a few new faces, don't

get jumpy...

TUBBS

And Jose, my ace, lots of

transshipment.  Lots of action.

Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has

assets on land, air, and sea.

(beat)

So any intel you got that can come

our way and contribute to the good

and welfare...?

JOSE YERO

Sure.  Check your e-mail.

CUT TO:

JOSE YERO

(to El Tiburon)

You know what Escobar used to do?

EL TIBURON

What?

JOSE YERO

(goes on)

In the '80's, air routes came into

favor.  It required many pilots.

The best were American.  Former

crop-dusters.  They didn't fly by

the book.  Tell one:  "Put that 747

down on this fifteen-hundred-foot

runway."  Somehow, he'd do it.

Great pilots.  But Pablo had a

rule.  After they flew six

loads...this good pilot who

facilitates so much good

business... he would come back to

Medellin or Barranquilla to pick up

the next load?

(beat)

And no one would ever see him

again.  He'd disappear.

(imitates Pablo)

"You a good pilot?

Make a lot of money for Pablo?

Thank you very much."  And then

Pablo would kill his ass.  After

six loads.

(pause)

And who was Pablo Escobar?  A

provincial who got busted-out by

the white collars from Cali.  When

the gringos got him, he was nobody.

We're three times better than Pablo

Escobar.

(beat)

The means we kill these

sonsabitches three times sooner.

(beat)

And do you know why Pablo Escobar

did that?

EL TIBURON

Why?

JOSE YERO

He didn't like pilots.

JOSE YERO (CONT'D)

And put eyes on her.  Put eyes on

her twenty-four hours a day...

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

I forgot the napkins.

CROCKETT

And the chopsticks and fortune

cookies?

ISABELLA

What's the best fortune you ever

got?

CROCKETT

They're all the same.  "Financial

security is around the corner."

"Your friends love you."

ISABELLA

In Kowloon, once, I got one that

said, "Live now because life is

dust."

CROCKETT

Do you have assets somewhere else?

Bank accounts?

ISABELLA

Why?

CROCKETT

...to fall back on.  You know, a

fail-safe.  Insurance.

ISABELLA

Do I need it?

CROCKETT

(shrugs)

Everybody needs it.  Ask

Prudential.  Or Allstate.

ISABELLA

(laughs)

'Cause whatever can go wrong,

will...?

CROCKETT

Something like that.  The odds

catch up with you.  The odds are

like gravity.  You can't negotiate

with them.

(then)

So...at some point, you should cash

out, take your money and run...

ISABELLA

(smiles)

Really?

CROCKETT

Sure.  As far away and as fast as

you can.

ISABELLA

When?

CROCKETT

Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe

sooner.

ISABELLA

Would you find me...?

CROCKETT

Of course.

ISABELLA

Where would I go?

CROCKETT

Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands.

Somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

There's twelve-hundred islands

there...

ISABELLA

(smiles)

Is this the protective male talk?

CROCKETT

(deadly serious)

This is the talk of a man...if he

were your husband...he would never

put you at risk.  He would never

put you within a thousand miles of

anything that could hurt you.

ISABELLA

And if I were in the Comoros, in

the Indian Ocean, where would you

be...?

CROCKETT

A few more moments, still in this

business.  Then I'd find you.

ISABELLA

Would you?  Because if you

couldn't, I would be very lonely...

I would have left the only world I

know and have known since I was

seventeen.

(smiles, touches Crockett)

But none of this will happen.  So

it doesn't matter.  Because we are

on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all

you see around you...look around...

is Archangel de Jesus Montoya-

Londono.  He is my man.  And you are

a smuggler moving a load...

CROCKETT

...in the morning.

ISABELLA

I'll be on board by noon.

ISABELLA (cont'd)

What did you think?  This deal with

you is my deal.  I am responsible.

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Go ahead.

TRUDY

Too fast.  Too many moving parts.

CROCKETT

Switek?

SWITEK

Same.  But it's your call, boss.

CROCKETT

What's your take?

TUBBS

What's the point?  It's going down.

CROCKETT

Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and

arrest our ass."

(beat)

And Switek resumes romancing Miss

Ukraine...

TRUDY

If we were for real, and knew our

shit, we'd fade this one...

CROCKETT

Then you should.

TRUDY

(no)

If you're down, we're down for the

play.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ARYAN BROTHER

El Tiburon.

COLEMAN

So...?

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

Meth precursors and the Dutch party

favors are en route.

COLEMAN

(perfect Spanish)

All I want to know is the where and

the when.  Spare me mini moves,

progress reports and bullshit.

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

Okay.  You got the "item"?

COLEMAN

I got the item.

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

And our friend don't like the rest

of the people bringin' the merch to

you.

COLEMAN

(in Spanish)

How many?

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

Two main players plus three.

COLEMAN

(in Spanish)

My end?

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

25% discount on the load.

COLEMAN

(in Spanish)

Make it 40%.

EL TIBURON

(in Spanish)

Make it 35.

COLEMAN

Deal.

CAPTAIN

(loud hailer)

Me-a salama.  Ila l-liqa.

TUBBS

Yeah.  Whatever...

(waves)

CROCKETT

Yeah?

JOSE YERO (O.S.)

(phone filter)

Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I

have second thoughts.

CROCKETT

(into phone)

You got something to say, Jose,

let's hear it.

JOSE YERO

I confess I have succumbed to my

weaknesses.  An inability to see

another's point of view.

(beat)

I've discussed it with

professionals.  Even with one of

your friends.  She's here now...

JOSE YERO (cont'd)

(beat)

So I want you to deliver my

product, how I want my product

delivered.

CROCKETT

What friend?

JOSE YERO

Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She

is safe.  To insure that, I am

keeping her close to me.  It's

always good to keep people your

friends care about close to you.

JOSE YERO (cont'd)

So, I will tell you when you're 10

minutes out where to drop the load

into the hands of my people.  You

have 35 minutes to enter Government

Channel.  Head up the River...  We

will watch you.  Then I will call

you.

(beat)

And you can reach out for La Senora

in Barranquilla or wherever 'cause

I don't give a shit...

CROCKETT

Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs.

Rico's alive?

JOSE YERO

'Cause she will tell you.

ISABELLA

That sonofabitch!

TUBBS

(turns on Isabella)

You set this up!

ISABELLA

(sarcastic)

Of course!  That is why I placed

myself here, with you, knowing Yero

would pull this crap.

CROCKETT

Yero doesn't know she's here!

SWITEK

(entering)

Cigarette and the two Starkeys are

coming in.

(senses)

What...?

TRUDY

They grabbed Gina...

ISABELLA

It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of

communication in Fals de Iguazu.

Jose knows that...  Whatever he's

going to do, he has to do it fast

because he's acting on his own.

And he will need a story.

TUBBS

Meaning...?

ISABELLA

They will kill you.  And then they

will kill your wife, too.

CROCKETT

Yero, by himself?

ISABELLA

Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy

whites.

ZITO

We're half loaded...

TRUDY

Gina.  Like Alonzo's wife...  Cochi

Loco's got her.

CROCKETT

Dump the rest.  Let's get the boats

up that river.

CASTILLO (O.S.)

(filter)

Yeah?

CROCKETT

Jose Yero changed-up the drop plan

on us.  He's grabbed Gina.

CASTILLO

Where's the new drop point...?

CROCKETT

They'll have surveillance on us.

We'll know only at the last

moment...

CASTILLO

What do you think?

CROCKETT

It's a rip and a hit.

CASTILLO

(to someone else)

Get me Air Support...

(to Crockett)

We'll be airborne and assault the

ambush...

CROCKETT

You can't.

TUBBS

They'll kill Gina.

CASTILLO

They may have already, so we

protect the living.  Proof she's

alive?

CROCKETT

Supposedly it's coming.

TUBBS

(into phone)

Hello...?

LOU DOBBS (O.S.)

Welcome, folks.  Today's Friday,

the three-hundredth-and-fourteenth

day of the year...

TUBBS

They're proving it's right now.

And that she's alive right now...

GINA (O.S.)

...nice friends you got.  Trailer

trash with a bad smell...

CUT TO:

TUBBS

Smell.  Bad smell.  Trailer...

(he gets it)

She's allergic to diethylene...she

in a meth lab?

CROCKETT

Just came in.  She's still alive.

CASTILLO

Safe house is empty...

(beat)

Air Support's set to jump when we

know your drop point.  Gina?

TUBBS

(takes phone)

She's sending a message.  Meth Lab.

Trailer park.  Anything with

interesting antenna arrays...?

CASTILLO

There's three between Miami

International and the glades.  I'm

gonna try for her, but this is

triage.  Protect the maximum number

of lives.  You need to know that...

CUT TO:

CASTILLO (V.O.)

(to Tubbs)

Three possibles...

CUT TO:

CASTILLO (V.O.)

...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the

next two...

TUBBS

Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

If they attack you...

CROCKETT

(finishes)

...it's gonna be an L-shaped

ambush.  They're not gonna open up

until they got the party favors,

'cause all they'd get is a lot of

police scrambling to a gunfight.

They will wait till they got the

goods before they do the deed.

CUT TO:

CASTILLO (O.S.)

(radio filter)

Do you have her?!

CUT TO:

TRUDY

(into radio, to Castillo)

Have eyes on her.  She's alive.

Moving in...

TUBBS (O.S.)

Asian Star...

ARYAN BROTHER

You order Chinese?

LONG-HAIRED NLR GUY

(laughs)

No, but I'm starving...

ARYAN BROTHER

Don't...

TUBBS

HOLD IT!!

TRUDY

PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR!

ARYAN BROTHER

Shoot me, she dies.  Hey, fuck it,

man.  We can all go.

TRUDY

(cool)

That's not what will happen.

(that stops him)

What will happen is...

(as she's aiming her Car-

15 and slowly taking up

the slack on the

trigger...)

...what will happen is, I will put

a round precisely through the

medula at the base of your brain,

at an entry-point mid-distance

between your upper lip and the

bottom of your nose, and you will

be dead from the neck down.  Your

finger won't be able to twitch.  Do

you believe that?

ARYAN BROTHER

Fuck...

GINA

Motherfucker!

TUBBS

He's dead!

TRUDY

(on radio, to Castillo)

...got Gina.  She's okay.

CUT TO:

CASTILLO

(into loud hailer)

Go!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

YERO

(in Spanish)

Isabella.  The gringos are police.

She's their informant...!

CUT TO:

YERO

Go!

PA

(loud hailer)

Freeze!  You're under arrest.  Down

on your knees.  Put your hands on

your head...

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Isabella!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Touch the windshield with your

hands.  Let 'em see your hands are

empty.  Steady.

SWAT SERGEANT

(approaching)

Don't move!  Don't move!  Keep your

hands where I can see them...

SWAT SERGEANT (cont'd)

...Sonny?

CROCKETT

Yeah.  Hey, Robert.

SWAT SERGEANT

Are you okay?!

CROCKETT

Yeah.  Going to Miami General.

Check out Gina.  Everybody's okay.

Everybody's fine...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

Isabella...?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ISABELLA

What are you going to do with me?

Are you taking me to jail?  You

think I will turn into your

informant, is that it?

CROCKETT

No.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROCKETT

No part of it wasn't real.

ISABELLA

I know.

(quietly)

And now?

CROCKETT

It still is.  I'm so in this, I

don't know which way is up... All I

know is I won't let anything bad

happen to you.

(beat)

Just like I said.

(beat)

And I know we can't ever see each

other again.  And we never will.

ISABELLA

You said time is luck...

CROCKETT

Luck ran out.

(beat)

This was too good to last.

CUT TO:

THE END
