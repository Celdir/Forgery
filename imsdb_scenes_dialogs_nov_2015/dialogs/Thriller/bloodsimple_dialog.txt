Blood Simple

"BLOOD SIMPLE"

By

Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

VOICE-OVER

The world is full of complainers.

But the fact is, nothing comes with

a guarantee. I don't care if you're

the Pope of Rome, President of the

United States, or even Man of the

Year--something can always go wrong.

And go ahead, complain, tell your

problems to your neighbor, ask for

help--watch him fly. Now in Russia,

they got it mapped out so that

everyone pulls for everyone else--

that's the theory, anyway. But what

I know about is Texas...

CUT TO

VOICE-OVER

And down here... you're on your own.

WOMAN

...He gave me a little pearl-handled

.38 for out first anniversary.

MAN

Uh-huh.

WOMAN

...Figured I'd better leave before I

used it on him. I don't know how you

can stand him.

MAN

Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't

married to him.

WOMAN

Yeah...

WOMAN

...I don't know. Sometimes I think

there's something wrong with him.

Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?...

Or is it maybe me, do you think?

MAN

Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor.

I don't know what goes on, I don't

wanna know... But I like you. I always

liked you...

MAN

...What're you gonna do in Houston?

WOMAN

I'll figure something out... How

come you offered to drive me in this

mess?

MAN

I told you. I like you.

WOMAN

See, I never knew that.

MAN

Well now you do.

WOMAN

...Hell.

WOMAN

Stop the car, Ray!

MAN

...Abby?

MAN

...You know that car?

WOMAN

No.

MAN

What's the matter?

WOMAN

I don't know... I just think maybe

I'm making a mistake...

WOMAN

...What was that back there?

MAN

Back where?

WOMAN

Sign.

MAN

I don't know. Motel... Abby--

WOMAN

Ray. Did you mean that, what you

said before, or were you just being

a gentleman?

MAN

Abby, I like you, but it's no point

starting anything now.

WOMAN

Yeah.

MAN

I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--

WOMAN

Yeah.

MAN

...What do you want to do?

WOMAN

...What do you want to do?

RAY

...Hello.

VOICE

Having a good time?

RAY

...What? Who is this?

VOICE

I don't know, who's this?

VOICE

...You still there?

RAY

Yeah, I'm still here.

ABBY

...Ray?

RAY

Yeah.

ABBY

What was that?

RAY

Your husband.

VOICE

I know a place you can get that

framed.

MARTY

What did you take these for?

VISSER

What do you mean...

VISSER

...Just doin' my job.

MARTY

You called me, I knew they were there,

so what do I need these for?

VISSER

Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe

benefit.

MARTY

How long did you watch her?

VISSER

Most of the night...

VISSER

...They'd just rest a few minutes

and then get started again. Quite

something.

MARTY

You know in Greece they cut off the

head of the messenger who brought

bad news.

VISSER

Now that don't make much sense.

MARTY

No. It just made them feel better.

VISSER

Well first off, Julian, I don't know

what the story is in Greece but in

this state we got very definite laws

about that...

VISSER

...Second place I ain't a messenger,

I'm a private investigator. And third

place--and most important--it ain't

such bad news. I mean you thought he

was a colored.

(he laughs)

...You're always assumin' the worst...

VISSER

...Anything else?

MARTY

Yeah, don't come by here any more.

If I need you again I know which

rock to turn over.

VISSER

That's good... "which rock to turn

over"... that's very good...

VISSER

Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna

cut off my head...

VISSER

...I can crawl around without it.

MATCH CUT TO:

MEURICE

Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?

MAN

What?

MEURICE

What night is it?

MAN

(studying Meurice)

...Friday?

MEURICE

Right. Friday night is Yankee night.

Where're you from?

MAN

Lubbock?

MEURICE

Right. I'm from Detroit

(turning to leave)

It's a big city up north with tall

buildings.

MEURICE

Where was I?

WOMAN

You we telling me about the Ring of

Fire.

MEURICE

Yeah, well, I may be getting in over

my head here, I mean you're the

geologist, but my theory for what

it's worth, you got all these

volcanoes and each time one pops

it's the equivalent of what, twenty,

thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to

light Las Vegas for how long?  How

many years? Course, I'm no

mathematician but--

MARTY

Meurice.

MEURICE

Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.

MARTY

Has Ray come in yet?

MEURICE

No, he's off tonight. Where was he

last night?

MARTY

(glaring)

How would I know?

MEURICE

I don't know, didn't he call?

MEURICE

...Marty, I'd like you to meet an

old friend of mine, Debra. Debra,

this is Julian Marty, the dude I'm

always talking about.

MARTY

If he does come in I'm not here...

What were you drinking, Debra?

DEBRA

Remy.

MARTY

You've got a very sophisticated

palate.

DEBRA

Thanks.

MARTY

Give Debra here another drink, and

give me the usual.

DEBRA

...What's a palate?

MARTY

Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers

and the Rams next week in the

Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty

yard line?

DEBRA

I don't follow baseball.

MARTY

You won't have to. I'll explain what

a palate is.

DEBRA

You won't have to. I just wanted to

see if you knew.

MARTY

What's this?

MEURICE

You said the usual--

MARTY

Red Label.

MEURICE

(picking up the milk)

Right. Sorry.

MARTY

Pour that back.

MEURICE

What.

MARTY

Don't throw that out.

MEURICE

Right.

MARTY

So how long have you know Meurice?

DEBRA

About ten years.

MARTY

What--Waitaminute--What...

MEURICE

What.

MARTY

Deuce in the corner needs help.

MEURICE

Right.

MARTY

...So what're you doing tonight?

DEBRA

Going out with Meurice.

MARTY

Tell him you have a headache.

DEBRA

It'll pass.

MARTY

We don't seem to be communicating--

DEBRA

You want to hustle me. I don't want

to be hustled. It's as simple as

that. Now that I've communicated,

why don't you leave?

MARTY

I own the place.

DEBRA

Christ, I'm getting bored.

MARTY

I'm not surprised, the company you've

been keeping the last ten years.

MARTY

What's this?

MEURICE

What.

MARTY

(pointing at Meurice's

drink)

This.

MEURICE

Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying

for it.

MARTY

That's not the point.

MEURICE

What's the point?

MARTY

The point is we don't serve niggers

here.

MEURICE

Where?

(he looks over his

shoulder; up and

down the bar)

...I'm very careful about that.

MARTY

He thinks I'm kidding. Everybody

thinks I'm kidding;

(as he turns to leave)

if Ray comes in I'm not home.

DEBRA

Nice guy.

MEURICE

Not really. What'd you say your last

name was?

ABBY'S VOICE

Ray...?

RAY

Yeah...

RAY

...You get what you wanted?

ABBY'S VOICE

Yeah. Let's get out of here.

RAY

Why d'you wanna leave all this?

ABBY

You kidding? I don't wanna leave all

this, I just wanna leave Marty...

ABBY

...Drive me to a motel?

RAY

You can stay at my place, I'll drop

you there.

ABBY

Where... where you going?

RAY

See a guy.

ABBY

(nervously)

Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know

him, that ain't a good idea.

RAY

I just gotta see a guy.

MEURICE

Howdy stranger.

RAY

Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last

night.

MEURICE

Wasn't too busy. You missed a good

one, though. This white guy walks in

about one o'clock, asks if we have a

discount for alcoholics... I tell

him to get lost, but Marty's sitting

here listening and I can tell he's

thinking that maybe it ain't such a

bad idea...

MEURICE

...Ray, this is Debra. She's a

geologist. That's the theory of rocks.

RAY

Is Marty here?

MEURICE

Not here tonight. Wasn't here last

night. He's especially not back in

his office.

RAY

(leaving)

Thanks Meurice.

MEURICE

For what?

RAY

Marty?

RAY

...Well...? What?

MARTY

What "what"?

RAY

Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?

MARTY

I don't particularly want to talk to

you.

RAY

Well... if you're not gonna fire me

I might as well quit.

MARTY

Fine. Suit yourself.

(still staring fixedly

at the furnace)

...Having a good time?

RAY

...I don't like this kind of talk.

MARTY

Then what'd you come here for?

RAY

(no more conciliation)

You owe me for two weeks.

MARTY

Nope. She's an expensive piece of

ass...

MARTY

...You get a refund though, if you

tell me who else she's been sluicing.

RAY

I want that money. If you wanna tell

me something, fine--

MARTY

What're you, a fucking marriage

counselor?

MARTY

What're you smiling at--I'm a funny

guy, right, I'm an asshole? No, no,

that's not what's funny. What's funny

is her. What's funny is that I had

you two followed because, if it isn't

you, she's been sleeping with someone

else...

MARTY

...What's really going to be funny

is when she gives you that innocent

look and says, What're you talking

about, Ray, I haven't done anything

funny...

MARTY

...But the funniest thing to me right

now is that you think she came back

here for you--*that's* what's funny.

MARTY

...Come on this property again and

I'll be forced to shoot you...

MARTY

...Fair notice.

MEURICE (O.S.)

Marty...

MEURICE

...I thought you were dead. Going

home?

MARTY

No. I think I'll stay right here in

hell.

MEURICE

(turning to leave)

Kind of a bleak point of view there,

isn't it Marty?

MARTY

Meurice...

MARTY

...I don't want that asshole near my

money. I don't even want him in the

bar.

MEURICE

We get a lot of assholes in here,

Marty.

ABBY

Hello?

ABBY

...Marty?

RAY

Who was it?

ABBY

What?

RAY

On the phone. Was it for you?

ABBY

I don't know, he didn't say anything.

RAY

Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a

he?

ABBY

(smiling)

You got a girl--am I screwing

something up by being here?

RAY

No, am I?

ABBY

...I can find a place tomorrow, then

I'll be outta your hair.

RAY

If that's what you want to do, then

you oughta do it. You, uh... you

want the bed or the couch?

ABBY

Well... the couch would be all

right...

RAY

You can sleep on the bed if you want.

ABBY

Well... I'm not gonna put you out of

your bed...

RAY

You wouldn't be putting me out.

ABBY

...Well, I'd be okay in here--

RAY

Okay.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

ABBY

Opal--

MARTY

(quietly)

Lover-boy oughta lock his door...

MARTY

...Lotta nuts out there.

MARTY

Let's do it outside...

MARTY

...in nature.

RAY

Like to have seen his face when he

found the dead end.

TEENAGER

Hey mister, how'd you break your

pussyfinger?

VISSER

(to the girl)

Sorry sweetheart, my date is here...

VISSER

...She saw me rolling a cigarette

and thought it was marijuana.

(he laughs)

I guess she thought I was a swinger.

VISSER

Idnat wild?

VISSER

(genially)

Stick your finger up the wrong

person's ass?

VISSER

You know a friend of mine broke his

hand a while back. Put in a cast.

Very next day he takes a fall,

protects his bad hand, falls on his

good one, breaks that too. So now

he's got two busted flippers and I

say to him "Creighton, I hope your

wife loves you. 'Cause for the next

five weeks you cannot wipe your own

goddamn ass..."

VISSER

...That's the test, ain't it? Test

of true love--

MARTY

Got a job for you.

VISSER

(settling down)

...Well, if the pay's right and it's

legal I'll do it.

MARTY

It's not strictly legal.

VISSER

If the pay's right I'll do it.

MARTY

It's, uh... it's in reference to

that gentleman and my wife. The more

I think about it the more irritated

I get.

VISSER

Yeah? Well how irritated are you?

VISSER

...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can

you tell me what you want me to do

or is it a secret?

MARTY

Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke

here.

VISSER

You want me to kill 'em.

MARTY

I didn't say that.

(a pause)

Well?

VISSER

Well what?

MARTY

What do you think?

VISSER

You're an idiot.

MARTY

So, uh... this wouldn't interest

you.

VISSER

I didn't say that. All I said was

you're an idiot. Hell, you been

thinking about it so much it's driving

you simple.

MARTY

Ten thousand dollars I'll give you.

VISSER

I'm supposed to do a murder--two

murders--and just trust you not to

go simple on me and do something

stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why

should I trust you?

MARTY

For the money.

VISSER

(sobering)

The money. Yeah. That's a right smart

of money...

VISSER

...In Russia they make only fifty

cents a day.

MARTY

(hoarsely)

...There's a big--

VISSER

(abruptly)

I want you to go fishing.

MARTY

...What?

VISSER

Go down to Corpus for a few days.

Get yourself noticed. I'll give you

a call when it's done... You just

find a way to cover that money.

MARTY

I'll take care of the money, you

just make sure those bodies aren't

found... There's a...

MARTY

...If you want, there's a big

incinerator behind my place...

VISSER

(under his breath)

Sweet Jesus, you are disgusting.

LANDLADY (O.S.)

--big windows, paneleen and

everytheen. So you want, like your

own place? Like a Town House?

LANDLADY (O.S.)

No one will bother you here, sweetie--

LANDLADY

(cheerful again)

I show you around.

ABBY

Are you sure this is... Are you sure

this apartment is vacant?... Mrs.

Esteves?

LANDLADY

Oh yes...

LANDLADY

...That's the kitchen...

LANDLADY

...This is the bathroom...

LANDLADY

...The toilet works and everytheen...

LANDLADY

...And here we are back in the liveen

room.

LANDLADY

...Good floors. Gas heat.

LANDLADY

...That's Mr. Garcia.

LANDLADY

...I was just esplaineen to him that

he moved out of here yesterday...

LANDLADY

...You look around. Don't mind Mr.

Garcia; he use do be my brother-in-

law.

EXHORTER

How 'bout it, gentlemen, let's show

out appreciation for Lorraine up

there, a registered nurse from Bolton,

Texas, how 'bout it gentlemen, yeah...

ABBY

Looks like the state legislature is

out of session.

MEURICE

I thought this is where they met.

ABBY

Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me

with a problem.

MEURICE

I am?

ABBY

You're gonna keep an eye on Marty

and Ray, make sure nothing happens.

MEURICE

It won't?

MEURICE

...Ever occur to you, Abby, that

maybe I'm the wrong person to ask?

EXHORTER

Let's not sit on our wallets,

gentlemen. Lorraine is up there

dancing her heart out, and if you

let that cash money set on your hip,

you might just as well be broke...

ABBY

Thanks, Meurice.

MEURICE

Any time. But you don't have to worry

about a thing for a while. Marty

went down to Corpus yesterday.

EXHORTER

And remember, gentlemen, we're always

here, two to two, A.M. to P.M., three

hundred and sixty-four days and

Christmas, God willing and the creek

don't rise...

ABBY

He's in the house.

RAY

What's the matter?

ABBY

I could've sworn I heard something.

RAY

Door's locked. Nothing there.

ABBY

I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have

heard anything if it was him. He's

real careful. Fact is, he's anal.

RAY

...Huh?

ABBY

Yeah, he told me once himself. He

said to me...

ABBY

..."In here, Abby. In here... I'm

anal."

RAY

(yawning)

...Well I'll be damned.

ABBY

I couldn't believe it either...

ABBY

...Me on the other hand, I got lots

of personality...

ABBY

Marty always said I had too much.

'Course he was never big on

personality...

ABBY

...He sent me to a psychiatrist to

see if he could calm me down some.

RAY

Yeah? What happened?

ABBY

Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest

person he'd ever met, so Marty fired

him.

RAY

(sleepily)

...I don't know if you can fire a

psychiatrist, exactly.

ABBY

Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll

tell you that much.

RAY

Uh-huh.

ABBY

I said, Marty, how come you're anal

and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?

RAY

What'd he say?

ABBY

Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't

say much.

RAY

(murmuring)

Thanks.

ABBY

Except when he doesn't say things

they're usually nasty.

RAY

...Mm-hmm.

ABBY

When you don't they're usually nice.

RAY

...You ever get tired?

ABBY

Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.

CUT TO

VOICE

Hello.

VISSER

Marty?

MARTY

Yeah. Is it...

VISSER

Ya catch any fish?

MARTY

...What?

VISSER

Ya catch any fish?

MARTY

Yeah...

VISSER

...What kind of fish?

MARTY

Listen, what is it? Is it done?

VISSER

...Yessir, you owe me some money.

VISSER

(dully)

They look good.

MARTY

Want a couple?

VISSER

Just the ten thousand'll be fine.

MARTY

Got something to show me first?

MARTY

Dead, huh?

VISSER

So it would seem.

MARTY

What did you...

MARTY

...What did you do with the bodies?

VISSER

It's taken care of. The less you

know about it the better.

MARTY

Jesus, I don't believe it...

MARTY

...I think I'm gonna be sick.

VISSER

I'll want that picture back...

VISSER

...and you did say somethin' about

some money.

MARTY

Your money, yeah.

VISSER

Something I got to ask you, Marty.

I've been very very careful. Have

you been very very careful?

MARTY

Of course.

VISSER

Nobody knows you hired me?

MARTY

Don't be absurd, I wasn't about to

tell anyone...

MARTY

...This is an illicit romance--we've

got to trust each other to be

discreet...

MARTY

...For richer, for poorer.

VISSER

Don't say that. Your marriages don't

work out so hot...

VISSER

...How did you cover the money?

MARTY

It's taken care of. The less you

know about it the better.

MARTY

...I just made a call about that.

It'll look fine.

VISSER

(shaking his head)

I must've gone money simple. This

kind of murder...

VISSER

...it's too damn risky.

MARTY

Then you shouldn't have done it.

Can't have it both ways.

MARTY

...Count it if you want.

VISSER

(reaching into his

coat)

Nah, I trust ya.

VISSER

Who looks stupid now.

WIPE TO:

RAY

(muttering)

Damn...

RAY

Marty...

RAY

Marty...

RAY

What's the matter, you deaf?

MEURICE (O.S.)

Marty?

MEURICE (O.S.)

Marty, ya home?

MEURICE (O.S.)

What day is it today, Angie?

WOMAN (O.S.)

Tuesday.

MEURICE (O.S.)

Tuesday is ladies' night.

WOMAN (O.S.)

What?

MEURICE (O.S.)

Tuesday night is ladies' night. All

your drinks are free.

EVANGELIST

--so there were three signs, the

second of which is Famine, this famine

which I have already pointed out is

devastatin' Africa and the Indian

subcontinent. And the third of these

signs is earthquakes. Now I don't

know why he threw that in but if you

talk to a geologist, and I've talked

to many, he'll tell you that

earthquake activity--

EVANGELIST

--has increased almost eighty percent

in the past two years, and what's

more, in two years' time we'll be

experiencin' what's knows as the

Jupiter Effect--

EVANGELIST

--wherein all the planets of the

known universe will be aligned up

causin' an incredible buildup of

destructive gravitational force. Now

in Matthew Chapter Six, Verse Eighteen

the Lord out and tells us that these

are the signs by which we shall know

that He is at our door. There are

many good people disagree with me,

but it's my belief that this

Antichrist is alive today and livin'

somewhere in Europe, in that ten-

nation alliance I spoke of, bein'

groomed for his task--

ABBY

(through phone;

sleepily)

Hello?

RAY

(present; very hoarsely)

Abby... you all right?

ABBY

Ray?... What time is it?

RAY

I don't know. It's early... I love

you.

ABBY

...You all right?

RAY

I don't know. I better get off now.

ABBY

Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.

RAY

Abby--

ABBY

(sleepily)

...Ray?

RAY

You're bad.

ABBY

...What?

RAY

I said you're bad.

ABBY

(smiling)

...You're bad too.

RAY

We're both bad.

FADE OUT

ABBY

Why didn't you get into bed?

RAY

(groggy)

I didn't think I could sleep. I'm

surprised you could. Are you all

right?

ABBY

Yeah...

ABBY

...You called me this morning.

RAY

Yeah.

RAY

...I just wanted to let you know

that everything was all right. I

took care of everything. Now all we

have to do is keep our heads.

ABBY

...What do you mean?

RAY

I know about it, Abby. I went to the

bar last night.

ABBY

What happened?--Was Meurice there?

RAY

Yeah.

RAY

...He didn't see me, though. Nobody

saw me.

RAY

...Is it cold in here?

ABBY

Well... what happened?

RAY

I cleaned it all up, but that ain't

important...

RAY

...What's important is what we do

now; I mean we can't go around half-

cocked. What we need is some time to

think about this, figure it out...

RAY

...Anyway, we got some time now. But

we gotta be smart.

ABBY

Ray--

RAY

Abby, never point a gun at anyone

unless you're gonna shoot him. And

when you shoot him you better make

sure he's dead...

RAY

...because if he's not dead he's

gonna get up and try and kill you.

RAY

...That's the only thing they told

us in the service that was worth a

goddamn--Where the hell's my

windbreaker?

ABBY

What the hell happened, Ray?

RAY

That ain't important. What's important

is that we did it. That's the only

thing that matters. We both did it

for each other...

RAY

...That's what's important.

ABBY

I don't know what you're talking

about.

ABBY

I... I mean what're you talking about,

Ray? I haven't done anything funny.

RAY

...What was that?

ABBY

(rapidly)

Ray, I mean you ain't even acting

like yourself. First you call me at

five in the A.M. saying all kinds of

nice things over the telephone and

then you come charging in here scaring

me half to death without even telling

me what it is I'm supposed to be

scared of. I gotta tell you it's

extremely rattling.

RAY

(quietly)

...Don't lie to me, Abby--

ABBY

How can I be lying if I don't even

know--

ABBY

...I mean if you and him had a fight

or something, I don't care, as long

as you...

RAY

...Pick it up.

ABBY

What.

ABBY

(looking at Ray)

...Welp, that was him.

RAY

...Who?

ABBY

Marty.

ABBY

...What's going on with you two?

RAY

(quietly)

All right...

RAY

...You can call him back, whoever it

was...

RAY

...I'll get out of your way.

RAY (O.S.)

You left your weapon behind.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Hi Meurice, this is Helene, Helene

Trend, and I'm calling 'cause I wanna

know just what the hell that remark

you made about Sylvia's supposed to

mean...

WOMAN'S VOICE

...She says you're full of shit and

frankly I believe her. And hey, I

love you too. Sure. Anyway, you better

call me soon because I'm going to

South America tonight--you know,

Uruguay?

MARTY'S VOICE

(barking)

Listen asshole, you know who this

is. I just got back from Corpus and

there's a lot of money missing from

the safe...

MARTY'S VOICE

...I'm not saying you took it but

the place was your responsibility

and I told you to keep an eye on

your asshole friend. Don't--uh, don't

come to the bar tonight, I've got a

meeting. But tomorrow I want to have

a word with you, and with Ray--if

you can find him.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Meurice, where the hell have you

been? I--

MATCH CUT TO:

MEURICE

I hope you're planning on leaving

town.

RAY

(his back to Meurice;

arranging the sheet)

Got a problem, Meurice?

MEURICE

No, you do, cowboy. You been to the

bar?

RAY

...Why?

MEURICE

You shouldn't have taken the money...

MEURICE

...Look at me man, I'm serious. You

broke in the bar and ripped off the

safe...

MEURICE

...Abby warned me you were gonna

make trouble. Trouble with you is,

you're too fucking obvious; the only

ones with the combination are me and

you...

MEURICE

...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as

I'm concerned that only leaves one

fucking possibility.

RAY

(tonelessly)

What's that?

MEURICE

Those things are nothing but coffin

nails.

MEURICE

...Look. Personally I don't give a

shit. I know Marty's a hard-on but

you gotta do something. I don't know;

give the money back, say you're sorry,

or get the fuck out of here, or

something...

MEURICE

...It's very humiliating, preaching

about this shit.

MEURICE

I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob,

so you know it's no fucking joke.

ABBY

(quietly)

Marty?

FADE OUT

ABBY

Ray...?

MARTY

Lover-boy oughta lock his door.

MARTY

I love you...

MARTY

...That's a stupid thing to say,

right?

ABBY

I... I love you too.

MARTY

No. You're just saying that because

you're scared...

MARTY

...You left your weapon behind.

MARTY

He'll kill you too.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

ABBY

Ray.

ABBY

...Where is everything?

RAY

In the trunk.

RAY

...In the car.

ABBY

...You leaving?

RAY

Isn't that what you want?

RAY

Wanna come with me?

ABBY

...But first I gotta know what

happened.

RAY

What do you want to know?

ABBY

You broke into the bar. You wanted

to get your money. You and Marty had

a fight. Something happened...

ABBY

...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe

a burglar broke in, and you found--

RAY

With your gun?...

RAY

...Nobody broke in, Abby. I'll tell

you the truth...

RAY

...Truth is, I've felt sick the last

couple of days. Can't eat... Can't

sleep... When I try to I... Abby...

RAY

...The truth is... he was alive when

I buried him.

MEURICE

Abby. What's the matter?

ABBY

I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta

talk to you... Can I come in?

MEURICE

Yeah... yeah, come in...

MEURICE

...but I gotta tell ya...

MEURICE

...I'm retired.

MEURICE

Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?

ABBY

No, I--

MEURICE

Well I do...

MEURICE

...For you I answer the door. If you

wanna stay here, that's fine. But

I'm retired.

ABBY

Something happened with Marty and

Ray--

MEURICE

(sharply)

Abby...

MEURICE

...Let me ask you one question...

MEURICE

...Why do you think I'm retired.

MEURICE

...Ray stole a shitload of money

from Marty. Until both of 'em calm

down I'm not getting involved.

ABBY

No Meurice, it's worse than that.

Something really happened, I think

Marty's dead--

MEURICE

What?! Did Ray tell you that?

ABBY

Sort of...

MEURICE

That's total bullshit. Marty called

me after he was jacked up...

MEURICE

...I mean, I don't know where he is,

but he ain't dead.

ABBY

Meurice--

MEURICE

You don't look too good. You sleep

last night?

ABBY

Meurice, you gotta help me...

MEURICE

All right. Just sit tight. Try to

get some sleep...

MEURICE

...I'll find Marty, find out what's

going on.

CUT TO:

MEURICE

...Opal?

MEURICE (O.S.)

Even the fucking dog's gone crazy...

MEURICE

...Something pretty fucking weird is

going on. Put your coat on and I'll

drop you at home. But don't talk to

either of 'em until I do. And don't

worry. Believe me. These things always

have a logical explanation. Usually.

RAY

(abruptly)

Turn it off.

ABBY

Ray...

RAY

Just turn it off.

RAY

(answering a question)

No curtains on the windows.

ABBY

...So?

RAY

I think someone's watching.

ABBY

So what'll they see?

RAY

Just leave it off. He can see in.

ABBY

(abruptly)

--If you do anything the neighbors'll

hear.

RAY

You think...

RAY

...Abby. I meant it... when I

called...

ABBY

...I love you too.

RAY

Because you're scared.

ABBY

Ray--

OLD WOMAN'S VOICE

(frightened, in Spanish)

Get away! I'll call my son-in-law!

ABBY

(groping for the words,

in Spanish)

No no--you don't understand--

OLD WOMAN'S VOICE

(in Spanish)

He has a gun!

VISSER

(grimly)

All right...

VISSER

...You got some of my personal

property.

VISSER

...One of you does.

VISSER

...I don't know what the hell you

two thought you were gonna pull.

QUICK CUT TO:

QUICK CUT:

ABBY

...I ain't afraid of you, Marty.

VISSER (O.S.)

...Well ma'am...

VISSER

...If I see him, I'll sure give him

the message.

[DELETED SCENE FROM 1st. DRAFT]

RHODES

Hey there, stranger! What can I do

you for?

RAY

I need a room.

KYLE

He needs a room, Dusty.

RHODES

I reckon I can hear him...

(to Ray)

...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day

plus sales tax, plus extra for the

TV option.

RAY

How much extra?

KYLE

(calling out)

He wants the TV option, Dusty.

RHODES

I reckon I can hear him. TV option,

that's a dollar twenty, makes nine

eighty-six plus tax.

KYLE

(calling out)

Tell him the channels, Dusty.

RHODES

Channels, we got two and six. Two

don't come in so hot.

RAY

Just a room then.

KYLE

(calling out)

He don't want the option, Dusty.

RHODES

I reckon I heard the man.

RAY

(after shooting Kyle

an irritated glance)

Does he work here?

KYLE

(calling out)

Sure don't.

RHODES

See, Wednesday's the special on RC

Cola. I don't know if I explained

about the TV option. If there's a TV

in the room, you got to pay the

option.

KYLE

(calling out)

And how many room got TV, Dusty?

RHODES

Ever durned one.

RAY

(gamely)

Okay, I'll take the TV option.

RHODES

Well see the thing about that is,

we're booked.
