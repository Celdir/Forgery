VOICE V/O (VALERIE)

Everything you face in life.

Everything you come up against..

CUT TO:

VOICE (VALERIE)

Everything that stands in your way.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE (VALERIE)

..your foes, your fears, your

terrors....your darkest nights.

VOICE (VALERIE)

..are all sent to ask you the same

question. The only question..

VOICE (VALERIE)

Who are you?

CUT TO:

2.

VALERIE

Jessica McDowell. Cognis Chemicals.

I hope I'm not late.

CHANEL SUIT

When do you leave Kuala Lumpur, Ms.

Macdowall?

VALERIE

I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back

to Dusseldorf. I really only need

five minutes of his time..

CHANEL SUIT

I hope we are lucky. He is very

busy man.

SECRETARY

Mr Tabir very busy this morning.

VALERIE

Oh I can imagine.

VOICE (HAFIZ O.S)

Seeing's we're waiting..

3.

HAFIZ

..why don't you practice your

little pitch on me?

VALERIE

Actually. If it's all the same-

HAFIZ

I know all my uncle's business. He

trusts me. Begin.

VALERIE

Well. I'm sure you're aware Mr..

(No answer)

You're aware that recently your

subsidiary, Kopa Oleochemicals

developed an organic, ester based

lubricant derived from Kernel oil,

that makes offshore drilling

significantly more environmental.

My company, Cognis CMBH wants-

HAFIZ

(Interrupting, flatly)

You American?

VALERIE

Canadian. Actually. From Toronto.

HAFIZ

You a Maple Leafs fan?

VALERIE

Right. Uh. No. Not really.

HAFIZ

You must be the only person from

Toronto's not a hockey fan.

VALERIE

Oh I'm a fan. Dad's from Vancouver,

so I'm a Canuck. Between us, the

Maple Leaves suck. They should

never have signed Mark Bell. Guy's

a liability on an off the ice. So

who's your team?

4.

HAFIZ

I don't like hockey.

CHANEL SUIT

Unfortunately Mr Tabir has no

window this morning. But tonight he

extends invitation to private

reception at his residence.

VALERIE

Is that ok? I really don't wish to

intrude.

HAFIZ

Come to the party.

VALERIE

Mr. Tabir? Jessica McDowall, Cognis

GMBH. Thank you for allowing me to

come to your beautiful Home.

TABIR

How can I help you?

VALERIE

Mr Tabir I wonder if you had time

to glance at our proposal which

would allow Kopa to access to

Cognis' current Petrochemical

Service Partners. Essentially its-

TABIR

Please excuse me, I have to attend

to something.. My assistant here

will make you comfortable..

5.

VALERIE

Hi. I was waiting for Mr. Tabir.

HAFIZ

My uncle had to leave. He asked me

to drive you to his tennis club.

You can have your meeting there..

CUT TO:

VALERIE

Why are we stopping?

HAFIZ

Ms. Macdowall, my uncle believes

that trust is something you earn.

And he doesn't trust anyone until

he knows them very, very well..

VALERIE

But he trusts you, Hafiz..

HAFIZ

How do you know my name?

VALERIE

Your car was swept an hour ago.

(He goes for the door.)

Do not get out. If you get out of

this car I can't protect you.

6.

HAFIZ

Who are you?

VALERIE

Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.

HAFIZ                            VALERIE

VALERIE

Listen carefully. Your uncle is in

business with Abu Domar Khan-

HAFIZ                          VALERIE

(Shaking his head            His company provides Khan

smiling)                     with shipping, money

components.

VALERIE

Khan has made contact with a terror

organisation via an aid agency in

Pakistan. They are seeking

materials to build a weapon.

HAFIZ

Fuck you.

VALERIE

(She fixes him)

Your brother is in Kalutara jail in

Colombo facing execution for

trafficking. We can help him.

HAFIZ                          VALERIE

Listen to me. Listen.

VALERIE

You have to think straight here

Hafiz. Because I promise you one

thing... Right now, you have no

idea what we can and cannot do.

7.

VALERIE

We need information about your

uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you

help us, we help you. If you don't,

your brother dies and tomorrow

you're sitting next to your uncle

in a cell in Thailand and it won't

be me asking the questions.

VALERIE

You will get a call at 8am. You'll

be asked if you need a cleaner. You

want her to come three mornings per

week. Do you understand? I said DO

YOU UNDERSTAND?

SUE

So after like six hours, he finally

manages to stand up on the

snowboard, and the instructor lets

go of him and he just plummets..

(Laughter)

I swear to god, he can't turn, slow

down, for like four hundred yards.

BILL

And yet I'm incredible in bed.

JOE

Keep the change.

BACK TO:

STEVE

So what do you do Valerie?

VALERIE

I work in Venture Capital. Brewster

Jennings, here in Georgetown.

8.

STEVE

Cool. So like net startups..?

VALERIE

Right. Retail and consumer..

Basically we create pooled

investment vehicles..

STEVE

Sounds high risk..

VALERIE

I guess. But you know..high risk,

high return. Pretty boring

actually. So what do you do?

JOE                            DIANA

the same train together.

STEVE

We got the same train to your

mom's.

LISA                            JEFF

DIANA

Whatever they're telling us we're

totally vulnerable. I mean who's

protecting us.

VALERIE

It's real scary.

LISA

Joe. Would you risk taking your

kids to Disneyland right now?

JOE

Absolutely not. Far from being a

playground of the imagination,

Disneyland is actually a giant

clearing house for crappy

merchandise. And Space Mountain is

a major disappointment.

9.

VALERIE

Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for

kids.

STEVE

Vegas. A dirty bomb in Vegas.

JEFF

OK. You get on a plane, there's two

guys with turbans, seats A1 and 2.

JEFF

They look nervous. They're

sweating, saying prayers..

JOE

(To himself)

Ye Gods..

JEFF

Steve you have a two year old.

You're off that plane. You're

calling the cops. I think if we're

honest we all are.

(To Joe)

Joe. Two guys. On a plane. Turbans.

Praying. Sweating. What's the call?

JOE

Well Jeff..

CUT TO:

VALERIE

Every time. Every time we go out.

JOE

He started it-

VALERIE

He's drunk Joe. Everybody's had a

hard day. They're just trying to

let off steam-

10.

JOE

By invoking quasi-racist connundra?

The guy's a parent.

JOE                           VALERIE

JOE

So?

VALERIE

So you can't call him a racist

pussy.

JOE

If not sitting there while someone

spouts obnoxious crap makes you an

asshole. Then I'm an asshole. And

you knew that when you married me.

(Silence. She drives.)

By the way. How was your trip?

CUT TO:

VALERIE

Who's that?

CUT TO:

VALERIE

Hello.

JOE

Hi. Forgive me. I was staring. It's

just I'm sure we've met before.

VALERIE

So who am I?

11.

VALERIE

Valerie Plame.

JOE

Joe. Joe Wilson.

VALERIE

Former Ambassador to Gabon.

Ambassador in Iraq during the Gulf

War. Married twice.. Has a

reputation for trouble.

JOE

You've been misinformed. I was only

acting Ambassador in Iraq.

JOE

So what do you do, Ms. Plame?

CUT TO:

VALERIE

I'm an energy consultant for a firm

in Brussels.

JOE

And do you enjoy your work?

VALERIE

I love it.

JOE

Val. Where's the babysitter?

12.

VALERIE

Didn't I say? She can't get here

til after lunch.

JOE

(Sighs)

OK. I'll work from home this

morning.

VALERIE

Are you sure-

JOE

Relax. Me `n Spongebob are on it.

JOE                            VALERIE

want to skip it they know

you're busy-

JOE

I promise to behave.

SAMANTHA

I promise to behave.

JOE

See. We're all gonna be on our best

behavior.

CPD AGENT (O.S)

Counter Proliferation tracks and

thwarts nuclear and WMD acquisition

by rogue nations and non-state

actors.

13.

CPD AGENT (CONT'D)

We're the fastest growing division

in the Agency, which sounds cool

but means you may have to share a

desk. Work like hell for years you

may get your own cubbyhole. And if

you're a workaholic, they make you

boss, and you get-

CPD AGENT

Bad time?

VALERIE

Hafiz hired a cleaner.

ALI

(Into phone)

Gotta go. Kuala Lumpur just went

live.

VALERIE

What time did he call this in?

CPD AGENT

11 hundred hours PST.

CPD AGENT V/O (CONT'D)

The asset passed the intel to the

cleaner at approximately eight

fifteen local time, this morning.

CPD AGENT (O.S.)

She made the drop fifty minutes

later... just outside Ko Yonh

Subway station..

14.

CPD AGENT

..a field team picked it up and D

and D'd it at the safe house..

VALERIE

We have a shipment. A holding

company in Pakistan asks Tabir to

purchase 200 un-identified units,

trackable by part numbers, from..

ALI

Teludyne Electronics of Lowell

Massachusetts..

VALERIE (V.O.)

The shipment is delivered to Goza

Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey...

VALERIE (V.O)

There it's bundled in with a second

shipment of legitimate electronic

parts, and documentation attached

that masks its point of origin.

15.

VALERIE V/O

Its then dispatched as medical

electronics en route to a company

in Johannesburg South Africa. First

it spends the night at a bonded

customs warehouse in the Port of

Jersey. That's the intercept.

SUPERINTENDENT

Can I help you?

VALERIE

Sir, we're from U.S customs. Can I

take a moment of your time?

ALI

What the hell is that?

CUT TO:

DR FORSTER (O.S.)

A spark gap is a high energy

voltage-controlled switching

device.

16.

DR FORSTER

To detonate a nuclear bomb you need

to be able to switch high voltage,

high current electrical circuits at

very high speeds to the nearest

hundredth of a nanosecond.

DR FORSTER

The extremely short rise times are

achieved by discharging a low-

induct, high-voltage capacitor

through the spark gap into the

bridge wire inside the warhead. The

ballpark is 5 kilovolt and 1 mf for

the capacitor, with a peak current

between 500 and 1000 amperes...

VALERIE

Does it have other uses?

DR FORSTER

High speed photography, industrial

photo-chemistry. Zapping kidney

stones.Is someone out there

building the fire train for a

nuclear device component by

component?

(Shakes his head)

You're talking one helluva

complicated process. This guy is

just one tiny piece in the jigsaw.

VALERIE

This is a list of other components

exported through the same network

over the last 3 years. Tilt tables.

timing equipment. High speed

monitioring devices.

DR FORSTER

(Reading)

Quartz rate sensors. Calibration

units...

(Takes off his glasses.)

It's not kidney stones. Thank god

you stopped this.

VALERIE

I'm not stopping it.

17.

DR FORSTER

(Confused)

I don't understand..

VALERIE

We keep the transaction live. Trace

it all the way to the end user.

VALERIE

The shipment arrives in Joburg on

the 21st. It's put in an unmarked

container and shipped to the free

trade zone in Dubai. Our asset

meets there with the buyer on the

23rd.

VALERIE

Dr Forster and his team at Los

Alamos have altered the impedence

timings of the spark gaps by a

fraction of a nanosecond.

Basically, they won't know it

doesn't work til it doesn't work.

ALI

Can we put a wire on the asset?

VALERIE

Too dangerous. This network has

avoided detection for years. Expect

meticulous operational security and

counter surveillance. Any

questions?

DEPUTY CPD

Val. The chief wants to see you.

18.

BILL

Val, seventh floor have issued a

directive for a Joint Task Force on

Iraq. We want you to head it up.

VALERIE

Yes Sir.

BILL

You can pick your team. This is top

priority. Down the line D.F.U.

VALERIE

What about the Dubai op?

BILL

Mike says you got a hunch on the

buyer.

VALERIE

Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National.

Based out of Karachi. On a wire

picked up in Cairo he talks about

componentry from a known source in

Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed

Gulf state..

BILL

Iraq?

VALERIE

Vaziri's devoutly Shia. Iraq's

controlled by the Sunni. Saddam's

Sunni. There's no way this is Iraq.

BILL

They're all good Muslims right?

VALERIE

And Martin Luther King and the KKK

are both Christian.

BILL

Great job. From Monday, I need you

both eyes on Iraq.

CUT TO:

MIKE

D.F.U?

19.

VALERIE

Don't fuck up.

CUT TO:

PRESIDENT V/O

States like these, and their

terrorist allies, constitute an

axis of evil, arming to threaten

the peace of the world...

PRESIDENT V/O (ON CNN)

They could provide these arms to

terrorists, giving them the means

to match their hatred..

PRESIDENT

They could attack our allies or

attempt to blackmail the United

States. In any of these cases, the

price of indifference would be

catastrophic.

JOE

(Rushes over)

Hey hey hey. Everybody OK? Let's

take a look at you. Four arms. Four

legs. No broken bones.

HEATHER

Hey kids! Joe I'm sorry I'm late.

20.

JOE

That's fine. Look guys. Heather's

here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

How do you think she got the job?

ANALYST 1

Memo comes out saying we got two

percent women in executive roles.

It's quotas by another name.

There's ten guys I could name could

do the job better..

ANALYST 2

I wonder who's she's fucking.

VOICE (MIKE, O.S)

Don't you have a home to go to?

CUT TO:

21.

MIKE

DIA released the report Tuesday.

WINPAC aren't buying and State

kicked it back, but it's making

waves in the Vice President's

Office.

(He looks at her)

What do you think?

VALERIE

He's qualified. He's been there

hundreds of times. Knows the arena

inside out.

MIKE

You don't look overjoyed.

VALERIE

He's been working hard to build his

business. Then there's the twins.

Money's kinda tight right now.

MIKE

(He looks at her)

We're at full stretch here. You

know that better than anyone. He's

helped us before. Could you ask him

to come in?

VALERIE

You want to go out for breakfast.

Or stay here?

JOE

I want to live with you.

22.

VALERIE

There's something I have to tell

you.

VALERIE

What are you thinking?

JOE

Is your name really Valerie?

VALERIE (O.S.)

Joe?

JOE

(Brightly)

Hey.

JOE

Nice place you got here. Cosy.

VALERIE

(Smiles)

I need to get you cleared.

JOE

You work in the basement?

VALERIE

(Deadpan)

Actually. I work in Georgetown for

Brewster Jennings. We're a small

firm of Venture Capitalists.

JOE

That must be interesting work.

23.

VALERIE

It pays the rent.

VALERIE

This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is

Mike, the Deputy Chief of CPD.

(They shake)

I'll leave you guys to it.

MIKE

Mr Wilson, what can you tell us

about Yellowcake?

JOE

I believe it's a concentrate

obtained from uranium ore used to

create fissile material for weapons

programs. But I'm not a scientist.

MIKE

What about Niger?

JOE

The UN Human Development Index

ranks Niger the number one Least

Liveable country in the world. I

started my Foreign Service there.

As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled

back many times. Then as director

of Africa policy for the NSC under

President Clinton, I frequently

visited, often met with Prime

Minister Mayaki. I know the former

foreign minister. I know the

Minister of Mines.

MIKE

The Office of the Vice President

has received a report concerning a

memorandum of sale between the

governments of Niger and Iraq for

the purchase of five hundred tons

of Yellowcake Uranium ore..

(He fixes Joe)

(MORE)

24.

MIKE (cont'd)

I don't have to tell you how

serious this allegation is.

JOE WILSON

No Sir, you don't.

MIKE

This is a request from the Vice

President. Can you help us?

MINISTER (O.S)

Bien revenue a Niger M. Wilson.

JOE

Par la grace D'Allah. Comment allez

vous, M. Bonzala ?

MINISTER

Last time we met I was Minister,

you Ambassador. Now, thanks to

Allah, we are free men. You're

growing a beard, no?

25.

JOE

So it would seem.

MINISTER

So tell me. How can Niger help its

old friend, America?

TURNER

(Reads)

"In summer 2001 Iraq sought to

purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4

aluminum tubes manufactured in

China. The high spec of these tubes

led us to conclude they were

intended for the enrichment of

uranium. In August 2001 J.

Turner.." That's me.. "flew to

Vienna, to meet with IAEA

scientists. Mr. Turner produced

this report, aspects of which

represents the CIA's present

position." I'm happy to take

questions.

ANALYST

The INR concluded late last year

that these tubes were probably for

artillery use, and the DOE agreed

they exactly matched those used by

Iraq for artillery rockets.

PAUL

Where are the tubes?

TURNER

WINPAC has them. We've examined

them. This is my point. None of you

guys has even seen the tubes.

VALERIE

I've seen them.

TURNER

And when was that?

26.

VALERIE

When I seized them last year in

Jordan. When I headed the covert

team that intercepted them, bought

back samples and delivered them to

you guys at WINPAC.

TURNER

So I take it you're not a nuclear

expert. These tubes are an EXACT

match for those developed by German

scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.

VALERIE

You're right. I'm no nuclear

expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at

Virginia U atomic facility is. He

also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and

lives in Austria, and he told him

that the wall thickness of the

Iraqi tubes was three or four times

the thickness of his design.

PAUL

And the tubes are twice as long as

Zippe's design. In fact the only

similarity between his tubes and

the alumumium tubes is that they're

made of aluminium.

VALERIE

A metal that hasn't been used in

gas centrifuges since 1952.

TURNER

I went to Vienna. Canada. I've

worked on this for months. They're

centrifuges. Fact.

PAUL

So basically, they're your tubes

and if we don't let you win you're

going home.

27.

TURNER

That's pathetic.

VALERIE

Joe. No one is saying you're wrong

here. But if you're right, it's

huge. So we ask the question.

Right? We have to ask the question.

JOE V/O

Niger has two Uranium mines in the

Sahara desert. One's flooded. The

other's run by COGEMA, a French

subsidiary, jointly controlled by

the Japanese and Germans.

JOE

500 tons of Yellowcake is not an

off the books size transaction, it

represents a 40% production

increase in the nation's annual

output of uranium. A sale that size

would leave a huge paper trail.

JOE (V.O.)

Any documentation would by law have

to be signed by the Prime Minister,

Foreign minister, and the Minister

of the mines... But say it was an

off the books deal..

JOE (V.O.)

How do you hide the transportation

of 500 tons of anything, let alone

lightly refined uranium?

(MORE)

28.

JOE (V.O.) (cont'd)

You're talking fifty semi tractor

trucks on one road through villages

where nothing passed for months

except maybe one bush taxi. It

would be the biggest event for

months. To say they forgot, it's

like kids forgetting Christmas.

JOE

The droughts of the 80s and 90s

were met by millions of dollars of

U.S Aid, which continues to this

day. It just doesn't make sense

Niger would compromise this

lifeline. For that reason, and the

others I've given, it's my opinion

that the sale couldn't happen.

CUT TO:

JOE

What happens next?

VALERIE

They write a report. Give it to the

analysts. It'll be re-written, then

kicked upstairs where it'll be

thrown in with whoever else's

report they got-

JOE

You guys are hysterical. I can't

believe you're actually gonna send

someone else all the way out there

to ask exactly the same questions.

VALERIE

You can't compile Intelligence from

a single source? That's not

Intelligence. That's an opinion.

JOE

I can save the CIA some air fare

here. There isn't a snowflakes

chance in hell this thing happened.

29.

VALERIE

Say who?

JOE

Says me.

VALERIE

What if you're wrong? One guy says

it's true. It's not true. Lots of

guys say it's true, it's still not

true. It's intelligence. It's slow.

Painstaking. But it works. Checks

and balances.

JOE

What am I, a check or a balance?

VALERIE

Probably neither. You're a teeny

tiny weeny cog in a giant machine.

But you did your job. You should

feel good. They count on that.

That's why they don't pay you.

JOE

I'm not feeling that 007 right now.

VALERIE

I can get the kids to make you a

medal, if it'll help.

JOE

Us double oh's are more about the

gratuitous sex.

VALERIE

I'll see what I can do.

CUT TO:

JOURNALIST

Mr. President, in your speeches now

you rarely talk or mention Osama

bin Laden. Why is that?

30.

PRESIDENT ON TV

The idea of focusing on one person

indicates people don't understand

the scope of the mission. Terror is

bigger than one person. So I just

don't spend that much time on him,

Kelly, to be honest with you...

VALERIE

Why is the OVP here?

VALERIE

Mike. The Vice President's men are

here.

MIKE

What the fuck?

LIBBY

My name is I. Lewis Libby. I'm the

Chief of Staff to The Vice

President. You are?

ANALYST

Dave. I'm an analyst. In non-

proliferation.

LIBBY

What can you tell the Vice

President about aluminium tubes?

CUT TO:

PROFESSOR AZIZ(V.O.)

The warping of the extra dimension

is analogous to the warping of

spacetime in the vicinity of a

massive object eg: a black hole.

33.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

Red-shifting, generates a large

ratio of energy scales so that the

natural scale at one end of the

extra dimension is much larger.

PROFESSOR AZIZ (V.O.)

It's an honor to meet you at last

Dr. Harper.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

I was unable to attend your String-

Gravity seminar at MIT but I read a

transcript. Truly groundbreaking

work.

VALERIE

Thank you.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

The Faculty have just moved me, so

you must excuse the mess.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

My old rooms were on the other side

of the courtyard. They were smaller

but I got the morning sunlight.

Will you settle for Peppermint tea.

It's fresh.

VALERIE

Thank you.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

Tell me Dr. Harper, did you read my

latest paper on quarks. I cite your

1995 essay more than once. I would

be very intrigued to know what you

made of my findings..

34.

VALERIE

Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge,

Massachusetts. She received a call

yesterday requesting she stay home

for 48 hours.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

I don't understand. Who are you?

VALERIE

I'm sorry for misleading you. But

I'm here to ask you the same

question.

(He stops)

Because you are not Professor Aziz.

VALERIE

I'm sorry to surprise you like this

Sir. Your name is Doctor Harif Al

Fallari. You were born in Basra.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

Well. This is indeed a strange

morning. Madam, there seems to have

been a mistake. My name is Said

Uhmah Aziz. I am a theoretical

physicist. I model space. I've

never been to Basra. I'm a teacher.

I'd like to be of assistance. But

I'm afraid I can't help you.

VALERIE

So you're not Doctor Fallari.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

Madam. I've never even heard of

this man.

VALERIE

You were not lead engineer at the

Osirak nuclear installation outside

Tikrit. You were never captured by

the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria.

You didn't spend three years in the

Abu Dhan jail.

35.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

This is absurd.

VALERIE

You weren't tortured. Broken. You

didn't finally escape and arrive

here in Cairo with nothing.

PROFESSOR AZIZ

No.

VALERIE

Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters.

They were taken by Uday Hussein's

private guard. He never saw them

again.

VALERIE

That didn't happen. They never

existed.

VALERIE

I need names. Of your colleagues in

the weapons programmes. The lives

of hundreds of thousands of your

people may depend upon it.

VALERIE

I know Tarif. I know what happened.

PROFESSOR

You know nothing.

36.

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

They're back.

ANALYST 1

The Iraqis were trying to buy the

tubes off the internet. They spent

three million dollars weather-

proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes

are roughly twice too long. Now you

could argue that that's to disguise

them, you could saw them in half.

That's sixty thousand tubes.

(Mimes sawing)

I mean whew. Saddam's gonna get the

mother of all blisters..

ANALYST 2

How was it?

ANALYST 1

Don't make jokes.

37.

ANALYST 2

He thinks I don't know how serious

it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen

hour days, we've gone back over and

over it.

PAUL

OK. I'll handle this.

CUT TO:

PAUL

And so apart from all the

scepticism surrounding the

specification, the analysis from

the IAEA which I believe is

numbered in the report..

(Stops. Changes tack)

Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear

scientists are among the most

boring people on the planet. They

can talk about gas centrifuges

until you want to jump out of a

window. And maybe once every ten

years someone comes along and says

"so, tell me about gas

centrifuges". That's literally the

only time you should listen to

these guys. If they say an

aluminium tube is not for a gas

centrifuge it's like a fish talking

about water. We've been over this

data with you now five, six times.

And... We don't really know how you

want us to play this..

LIBBY

Let me level with you here Paul. I

don't know what these tubes are

for. From everything you're saying,

there could be something to this,

but very likely not, right?

PAUL

Exactly.

LIBBY

May I ask a question? When you say

we don't really know how to play

this, what do you mean?

38.

PAUL

(Stops. Turns white)

I'm just saying I don't know how to

say it any other way than that-

LIBBY

Except you didn't say `I' you said

`we'. So you and the others have

discussed how to "play" these

briefings. Why does the CIA feel

the need to play these briefings?

PAUL

No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn't mean

what I just said.

LIBBY

Which part. The last part. Or other

things too.

PAUL

I'm a getting a little confused-

LIBBY

You want me to come back?

PAUL

No. GOD no.

LIBBY

You don't know why I'm here do you?

In 1991 the United States invaded

Iraq, and afterwards weapons

inspectors discovered Saddam was

six months off enriching uranium to

sufficiently high specification to

make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile

material. And not a single person

at the CIA, from the DCI down to

the janitor had the slightest clue

that such a program even existed.

So now, one decade on, are you

telling me that you're 100% sure

these tubes are not intended to

create nuclear weapons?

PAUL

I..Sir..OK. With intelligence,

nothing's 100 percent.

39.

LIBBY

So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine

percent sure? Ninety eight?

PAUL

You can't put an exact figure. You

can't be that precise.

LIBBY

But if you had to say, could you

say you're ninety seven percent

sure? Is there a three percent

chance you've got this wrong? Or

four? Or five? Still pretty good

odds. You like those odds Paul? You

willing to put your name to that.

Are you ready to make that call?

PAUL

I don't make the call, Sir-.

LIBBY

(Fixing him)

Yes you do Paul. Each time you

interpret a piece of data. Each

time you choose a "maybe" over a

"perhaps" you make a call. A

decision. And right now you're

making lots of little decisions

adding up to a big decision and out

there's a real world where millions

of people depend upon you being

right. But what if there's a one

percent chance you're wrong. Can

you say for sure you'll take that

chance and state, as a fact, that

this equipment is not intended for

a nuclear weapons programme?

LIBBY

Do you know what one percent of the

population of this country is? It's

three million, two hundred and

forty thousand souls.

PAUL

Sir. We're not machines. We.. It..

We look at the evidence, we game it

out. Not everyone agrees all the

time. It's a process.

40.

LIBBY

It's a process.

PAUL

Yes.

LIBBY

And not everyone agrees.

PAUL

Exactly.

LIBBY

Who doesn't agree?

in `83, he came here for an

engineering conference. Twice in

twenty five years. We try to stay

in contact. It's difficult.

VALERIE

Would you like to go back and see

him?

44.

SAWSAN

You want me to become a spy.

VALERIE

We need to ask Sa'ad some

questions. Do you think he would

answer them?

SAWSAN

I'm a doctor. I work hard. I'm also

a mother. I have a small girl and

I'm all she has.

VALERIE

We can help your brother. Right now

he is extremely valuable to us.

SAWSAN

And to Saddam. The Mukbarat watch

him night and day.

VALERIE

He could come here Sawsan. He's an

expert physicist. He'd have a job,

his children, his family would be

safe. You, your daughter could see

him whever you want. Sawsan. Can

you help us?

SAWSAN

I won't do anything to help you. I

don't know you. I would only do

this for Sa'ad.

We do know that he is actively

pursuing a nuclear weapon. That

there have been shipments into Iraq

of high-quality aluminum tubes that

are only really suited for nuclear

weapons programs, centrifuge

programs..

acquire some of the specialized

aluminum tubing one needs to

develop centrifuges that would give

Specifically aluminum tubes.

There's a story in The New York

has been seeking to acquire the

kinds of tubes that are necessary

to build a centrifuge.

MIKE (O.S.)

It's a coordinated leak..

There is no doubt that Saddam

Hussein's regime is a danger to the

United States and to its allies, to

our interests. The problem here is

that there will always be some

uncertainty about how quickly he

can acquire nuclear weapons. But we

don't want the smoking gun to be a

mushroom cloud.

PROFESSOR

Ambassador Wilson is the last

American diplomat to meet with

Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when

Saddam threatened to execute anyone

sheltering foreigners, Wilson

appeared at a press conference

wearing a noose around his neck,

declaring, "If the choice is to

allow Americans to be taken hostage

or be executed, I will bring my own

fucking rope." Saddam backed down

and Wilson evacuated several

thousand. He came home and was

taken to the Oval Office where the

President introduced him to the War

Cabinet as an American hero.

JOE

That's not quite true. It wasn't

the Oval Office it was the

Roosevelt Room.

58.

VALERIE

Sawsan's brother worked with five

hundred scientists at the Safa

factory. In `91 it was blanket

bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel,

Saddam's son in law, kept the

scientists together, threatening to

kill them if they tried to leave.

But sanctions destroyed the

economy, and when Kamel was

executed in `95, the team just

drifted apart. They're all say the

same thing Mike. Everyone.

Does Saddam pose an imminent threat

to National Security?

JOE

I haven't seen the intelligence.

I'm not qualified to comment. We

have intelligence services working

hard to assess just this. But I

have met Saddam. I've looked him in

the eye, so I can tell you what I

saw. During a particularly vicious

period of bloodletting in the late

eighties, Saddam was asked by his

foreign minister why he had

executed a certain official who had

been a loyal supporter. He said he

would rather kill a friend in error

than allow an enemy to live. For

me, that is the mark of a monster.

REPORTER

Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson

yesterday claimed in a piece in the

New York Times that the President

mispoke in his State of the Union

Address in January, concerning

claims that Saddam sought 500 tons

of Yellowcake from Niger. Wilson,

who was acting Ambassador in Iraq

during the first Gulf War, said-

MR. FLEISCHER:

Look. There's zero, nada, nothing,

new here. The President's statement

in the State of the Union was much

broader than the Niger question.

JOURNALIST

Is the President's statement

correct?

FLEISCHER:

Yes, I see nothing that goes

broader that would indicate that

there was no basis to the

President's broader statement. But

specifically on the yellow cake,

the yellow cake for Niger, we've

acknowledged that that information

did turn out to be a forgery.

JOURNALIST 2

The President's statement was

accurate?

FLEISCHER:

We see nothing that would dissuade

us from the President's broader

statement.

So you believe the British report

is true?

MR. FLEISCHER:

I'm sorry?

So it was wrong?

FLEISCHER

Let me do this, David. On your

from Cincinnatti ten weeks ago at

the CIAs request. They also have

that Gerson wrote both speeches.

Karl is on line one. He's unhappy-

LIBBY

I want a transcript of everything

across networks, blogs and print

citing Ambassador Wilson, Niger or

Yellowcake. I want Hadley to meet

me in the VP's office in five

minutes. And tell Karl I'll be in

my office straight after I'm done.

I have something.

fight to go on any longer.

VALERIE

I get death threats every day.

People threatening to kill my

husband. Hurt my children. I went

to the agency and I requested

security to protect my family. It

was declined. Because quote "My

fight, right now, Sir - we're

fighting it alone.

Joe Wilson versus the White House.

Well, all I can say is Good Luck.

But as a friend, I feel I should

tell you that those men..

Those few men in that building over

there, that small white house, are

the most powerful men in the

Vice President's chief of Staff

Scooter Libby, and special advisor

to the President Karl Rove. Both

men are under suspicion of having

leaked the agent's name to

ANCHORMAN

The Senate Intelligence Committee

published information that showed

Joe Wilson had lied about how he

came to be sent to Niger. He

denied that his wife had any role

in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame

wrote on February 12, 2002 proves

otherwise.

98.

ANCHORMAN

The Senate Intelligence Committee

let some air  a lot of air - out

of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego

when it issued its first report on

prewar intelligence. While the

committee heaped most of its

criticism on the Central

Intelligence Agency for getting

almost everything wrong about Iraq

and weapons of mass destruction it

pointedly rebuked the former

ambassador and his infamous mission

to Niger.

Mr Wilson, do you still maintain

the Vice President's office sent

you Niger and not your wife?

REPORTER 2

Mr Wilson was Niger just a free

holiday? A boondoggle?

The question still remains, who is

Valerie Plame? Was she really

simply a glorified typist?

Well, I think it's really all about

the money. We're talking about a

third-rate CIA agent who had a

government salary, and she had sent

her husband to Niger, and he had

come back and didn't give the

report to the CIA, but he turned it

over in an op-ed to The New York

Times. So she was already in the

hot seat with the CIA, and so now

she's all about the money. Plus

it's come out that she was

considered kind of a mediocre agent

at best.

That's the truth. That's the truth

right there, brother. Yes indeed.

Sierra Leone is dying. The people

at the top have too much power. WAY

too much power. Over there we have

no truth. Just power. People can't

see that from here. Over here it's

a different world.

JOE WILSON

I wouldn't be so sure of that.

TAXI DRIVER

How can you say that? Land of the

Free, brother. Home of the Brave.

JOE WILSON

Can we pull over. I'm going to

walk. Look keep the change.

TAXI DRIVER

Do you pray, Joe Wilson?

JOE WILSON

No.

TAXI DRIVER

I give you this. It is my church

maybe you come. And if you open a

bible, look John Chapter eight.

TAXI DRIVER (cont'd)

Then Jesus said if you continue in

my word then are you my disciples

indeed. And you shall know the

truth and the truth shall set you

free.

(he smiles)

Take care brother Joe.

VALERIE

How's is he?

MOTHER

Oh you know. Getting better.

Shakin' through.

CUT TO:

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

OK. See those birds. Those guys.

Those yellow fellas. See `em..

VALERIE

Yeah I see `em.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

OK. Listen.

(They both listen)

You hear that? Ain't that

beautiful. They suddenly showed up

last year. They're called..

(Stops)

What are they called? I know their

name. They're called something.

(He wracks his brain)

Anyway. They were here last year.

And the year before. God they're

beautiful. Look at that.

107.

VALERIE

Dad, I think my marriage is over.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

Well. I know my little girl doesn't

say anything til she absolutely has

to.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

I'm the same way. And I've said

that too. Those exact same words.

July 1972. Your mother and I were

fighting all the time. I guess she

was just plain tired of moving

home. Wasn't `til I retired after

42 years in the Air Force, I

realised we never had a home.

Germany, Singapore, Australia,

England. Heck I can remember the

day you were born in a freezing

cold airbase outside Anchorage

Alaska. You must have been to

twenty schools. Twenty different

chances to introduce yourself. Be

someone new. But you turned out OK.

Responsible. A little too serious.

Always looking down the road.

Worrying where life was going to

drag you next. But it made you

tough. Real tough. Maybe tougher

than I, or your mother, or anyone

knows.

VALERIE

He wants me to go on the record.

Speak out. Like that would suddenly

make this all go away. We can't

even speak to each other.

(She shakes her head)

I can't see how this comes round. I

just can't see it, pop. Not

anymore.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

What they did was wrong Valerie.

Plain wrong. Never forget that.

108.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

Say through some miracle you even

get through this.. you and Joe are

always gonna fight. You're

fighters. He's a stubborn son of a

bitch too. He don't give up easy

either.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

One day this country is gonna look

back on these years, and it's gonna

hang its head. It's gonna weep.

Then it's gonna stand up straight

and walk on.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME

I swear to God, she's gonna keep at

that until she licks it.

LT. COLONEL SAM PLAME.

They're tougher than we are.

They'll piss you off from time to

time, but they're built to last.

JANITOR

Mister?

(No reaction)

We're closing. You have to leave.

MSNBC

The vice president's chief of

staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby

Jr., was indicted Friday on charges

of obstruction of justice, perjury

and making false statements..

CUT TO:

FOX NEWS                          CNN

CNN

The U.S. military death toll in

Iraq exceeded 2,000 this week, and

the president's approval ratings

are at the lowest point since he

took office in 2001.

MSNBC

At a news conference, special

counsel Patrick Fitzgerald declined

to comment about Rove's

involvement.

FOX NEWS

Asked about Cheney, he said: "I'm

not making allegations about anyone

not charged in the indictment."

CNN

Friday's charges stemmed from a two-

year investigation by Fitzgerald

into whether Rove, Libby or any

other administration officials

knowingly revealed the identity of

CIA officer Valerie Plame..

110.

CNN

In a statement released Friday

afternoon, Libby said, "I have

conducted my responsibilities

honorably and truthfully. I am

confident that at the end of this

process I will be completely and

totally exonerated."

JOE

They served up Libby. He's taking

the fall.

JOE

I bet they've already struck the

deal. He takes the fall. He gets

pardoned. The deck's stacked. I bet

this doesn't even get to a trial.

VALERIE

Thank you.

VALERIE

I don't care how angry you get. I

don't care what they say about us.

I don't care if you hate me. If

they take everything away from us,

but they are not going to take

this. They do not get to take my

marriage.

JOE WILSON

I'm so sorry.

VALERIE

You did good.

JOE WILSON

I did it for me.

111.

VALERIE

I know why you did it.

(She looks at him)

Thank you.

JOE

If I could give it back to you. If

I could give you back who you were-

VALERIE

This is who I am. Right here.

VALERIE

So are you ready to fight?

JOE (O.S.)

How many of you know who put the 16

words in the State of the Union

address?

JOE WILSON (O.S.)

Arguably the most important speech

the president makes all year. Never

more important when the nation is

on the brink of war.

JOE WILSON

How many of you know who put it in?

(No hands.)

How many of you know my wife's

name?

(Everyone in the hall.)

How do you know one and not the

other?

(MORE)

112.

JOE WILSON (cont'd)

How did the question move from "Why

are we going to war?" to "Who is

that man's wife". I asked the first

question. Someone else asked the

second. It worked. Its still

working. Because we still don't

know the truth. But you all know my

wife's name.

JOE WILSON V/O

Public officials swear an oath to

uphold the constitution. That is

their duty. They must be kept to

their oath. That is yours. This

offense wasn't committed against

me. Nor against my wife...

JOE WILSON

It was committed against you.

And if you ever feel angry.

Misrepresented. Ashamed even.

JOE WILSON (O.S.)

Do something about it. In 1787 as

Benjamin Franklin left the

Constitution Hall after the last

drafting session, he was stopped by

a woman on the street. She asked--

JOE WILSON

-what manner of government have you

bequeathed us? Ben said 'A Republic

madam. If you can keep it.'

BACK TO:

JOE WILSON

If you can keep it.

CUT TO:

113.

JOE WILSON V/O

The responsibilty for this country

does not lie in the hands of a

privileged few.

JOE WILSON

We are strong and we are free from

tyranny only for as long as each

and every one of us remembers their

duty as citizens.

VAZIRI

Welcome to the revolution my

brother.

CUT TO:

JOE WILSON

Whether its a pothole at the end of

your street or a lie in the State

of the Union Address..Speak up. Ask

the question. Demand the truth.

JOE WILSON

Democracy is not a free ride...

114.

JOE WILSON

Man I'm here to tell you that. But

its where we live. And if we do our

job its where our children will

live. God bless America.

BACK TO:

VALERIE

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and

members of the committee. My name

is Valerie Plame Wilson, and I am

honored to have been invited to

testify under oath before the

Committee on Oversight and

Government Reform on the critical

issue...

REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE

...of safeguarding classified

information. I'm grateful for this

opportunity to set the record

straight. I served the United

States loyally and to the best of

my ability as a covert operations

officer for the Central

Intelligence Agency. I worked on

behalf of the national security of

our country, on behalf of the

people of the United States until

my name and true affiliation were

exposed in the national media on

July 14th, 2003, after a leak by

administration officials. Today I

can tell this committee even more.

(MORE)

115.

REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE (cont'd)

In the run-up to the war with Iraq

I worked in the Counter

Proliferation Division of the CIA,

still as a covert officer whose

affiliation with the CIA was

classified. I raced to discover

solid intelligence for senior

policy makers on Iraq 's presumed

weapons of mass destruction

program. While I helped to manage

and run secret worldwide operations

against this WMD target from CIA

headquarters in Washington , I also

traveled to foreign countries on

secret missions to find vital

intelligence. I loved my career

because I love my country.
