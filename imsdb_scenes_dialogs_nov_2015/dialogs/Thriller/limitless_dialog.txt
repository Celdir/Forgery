LIMITLESS

Based on the novel by

December 21, 2009

EDDIE (V.0.)

They found me.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I might have five minutes.

EDDIE (V.0.) ( (CONT'D)

I'll never know how they got past

security in a half-billion dollar

building.

EDDIE (V.O.)

They've become sophisticated.

Before they couldn't have done

this. But now...?

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I will never let them touch me.

2.

EDDIE (V.0.)

My neighbor must've heard the

noise. Opened his door to complain.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

He bought me half a minute. I wish

he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-

pitying and mine are no exception:

the waste. The waste of it all. I

mean, how many of us ever know what

it is to become... the perfect

version of ourselves. I'd come

that close. To having an impact on

the world.

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And now, the only thing I'd have an

impact on...

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... was the sidewalk.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Not so long ago, this was me.

(CONTINUED)

3.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I was a writer. Two years after my

copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr

came to a non-mutual end, I had, in

an extraordinary burst of desperate

energy, bullshitted my way into my

first book contract. This was it:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Now, at last, I was ready to write.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Gearing up, that's all.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Getting psyched.

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A few days did pass this way...

maybe a few months...

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Friends fled.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

And banks became attentive. But

just in case you think nothing ever

happened to me....

4.

LINDY

I don't think I can keep this.

EDDIE

Just like that.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I was kind of under the impression

you cared a little more than just--

LINDY

If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able

to stand to watch you do this.

EDDIE

Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to

Mark on Friday. If you could just

wait, see what he says-

LINDY

Stop. You think I don't know what

you do all day? I've loved you. I

know the good stuff, and I know the

shit.

EDDIE

And it's all shit to you now?

LINDY

You're the one living it.

(SYMPATHETICALLY)

Don't think I don't know it's worse

for you.

EDDIE

Then you know I could use a friend.

LINDY

Don't you dare try that shit on me!

(CONTINUED)

5.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Well -- what'll work, then?

LINDY

I see where it's going. You'll

lose your apartment. And then

what? You'll move in with me--

EDDIE

Not with that enthusiastic invite--

LINDY

--And then it'll go on this way,

and I'll rag on you, and finally

boot you out -- and then what? I

mean, have you run the film?

EDDIE (V.0.)

She knew what was beckoning: the

lower bunk in my childhood bedroom

in Newark. We'd even had sex on it

once. And it was a thing to be

pitied and avoided.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Lindy. I really thought I had it

in me to do something. --I wasn't

getting around it, but it was

fucking there. And now, I, ah...

don't think it is. There.

--Anything. At all.

LINDY

You know what...? I'd have had you

move in anyway... if...

EDDIE

If, what?

(CONTINUED)

6.

CONTINUED: (2)

LINDY

If it was me you wanted. And not

Melissa.

EDDIE

I never think about Melissa--!

LINDY

I have to get back.

EDDIE

--Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't

tell me what happened yesterday.

LINDY

I got it.

EDDIE

You got it--?!

LINDY

Yeah. I'll have my own assistant.

You believe that?

EDDIE

(GENUINE)

You deserve it, Lindy.

LINDY

Yeah, thanks. I do.

(CONTINUED)

7.

CONTINUED:

LINDY (CONT'D)

Oh, please.

EDDIE (V.0.)

She was right. I was almost 35.

No one talks about "potential" at

35. I had missed the on-ramp.

Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower

bunk of my childhood bedroom... my

father happy to welcome me into the

challenging field of dental supply

inventory...

VOICE

Eddie. Morgan.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Of all the useless relationships

better forgotten and put away in

mothballs, is there any more

useless than... the ex-brother-in-

law?

VERNON

Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?

EDDIE

But who's counting.

VERNON

(taking him in)

Hey, you!!!

VERNON (CONT'D)

Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't

you?

(CONTINUED)

8.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Sedentary job, you know...

VERN

So you're still trying to write?

EDDIE

As a matter of fact, I've got a

book contract.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

How about you?

(POINTEDLY)

Still dealing, Vernon?

VERNON

(SMUGLY)

Do I look like I'm still dealing?

EDDIE

No.

VERNON

Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna

hear about this book.

EDDIE

Nah, I should go--

VERN

You can't tell me you're a health

nut, now. Not with that tire-

EDDIE

(ANNOYED)

Enticing invitation. Thanks.

VERN

C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't

give `em back.

(CONTINUED)

9.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE

It's one o'clock in the afternoon,

Vern.

VERN

When's that ever stopped you?

EDDIE

(SIGHS)

Fuck.

EDDIE

So... how's Melissa?

VERNON

Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to

the beer.

EDDIE

I'm making conversation, Vern.

VERNON

Well, I don't know how Melissa is.

EDDIE

How don't you know? You're her

brother.

VERNON

I don't see her. She lives upstate

now, she's got some kinda internet

home sales kinda job... a couple of

kids...

EDDIE

A couple of kids...

10.

EDDIE

Who's the husband?

VERNON

What are you, jealous?

EDDIE

It's just a question, Vern.

VERNON

Walked out on her, if you really

want to know. But what do you care?

You guys weren't even married six

months, were you--? I mean, it was

just a coke thing, right?

EDDIE

Is that what she said--?! "A coke

thing."

VERNON

But I wanna know about this book.

How's it going?

EDDIE

(considering the question)

How's it going... Well... I'm

behind. I'm behind on my book, and

it's pretty well polluting my days

and nights if you really want to

know.

VERNON

How much have you written of it?

EDDIE

Not one fucking word, Vern.

(CONTINUED)

11.

CONTINUED:

VERNON

Wow. Creative problem, huh?

VERNON (CONT'D)

I think I have something that can

help you.

EDDIE

Oh, no-- no, no, no-

VERNON

You don't even know what it is.

EDDIE

You're still dealing.

VERNON

No -- yeah --will you listen?! This

isn't recreational. I've been doing

some consulting for a

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--

EDDIE

You mean a lab in some little

Yalie's basement? Give me a--

VERNON

No, this is an exclusive product

coming on-stream next year, they've

had clinical trials, and it's FDA

approved.

EDDIE

Okay, what is it?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

What's in it?

(CONTINUED)

12.

CONTINUED: (2)

VERN

Just take it. Get you over the

hump.

EDDIE

I'm too old for this, Vernon.

VERNON

Look, they've identified these

receptors in the brain that

activate specific circuits, and--

you know how they say you can only

access like 20 percent of your

brain? Well, what this does--

EDDIE

Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good?

I smoke too much: my chest is sore.

A fucking corpse has more energy

than I do, I've got weird aches,

possible lumps, rashes, maybe

they're a condition, or a network

of conditions. One of these days

they're all going to hold hands,

light up, and I'll keel over dead.

My life's in the crapper, and I

DON'T think it's going to take a

sudden upswing into the

stratosphere if I do some brand

new, shiny designer DRUG!

VERN

(INTO PHONE)

Gant.

(beat, getting agitated)

When. --I know, but when?

(looking at his watch)

Tell him we can't do that. He knows

that's out of the question. We

absolutely can't do that.

VERN (CONT'D)

No, I'm not going to tell him! You

tell him -- no, now!

(CONTINUED)

13.

CONTINUED: (3)

VERN (CONT'D)

Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm

going to have to leave you here,

Eddie. But let's hang out again,

have another beer.

VERN (CONT'D)

By the way, that's on the house.

EDDIE

I don't want it, Vern.

VERN

Don't be ungrateful, now. You know

how much these things cost?

VERN (CONT'D)

Eight hundred bucks a pop.

EDDIE (V.O.)

All the way home she was back on my

mind ... Melissa.

EDDIE (V.O.)

She'd been so smart. Smarter than

anyone around her. And oh, how she

loved to provoke people...

14.

MELISSA

--Oh, please, you think

professional women mentor one

another? You think there's some

mutually supportive empathetic

touch-feely network of kindly pie-

bakers? --Those bitches hate each

other! Quick, who was the worst

boss you ever had? A woman, right?!

We can't delegate, we can't command

-- I mean, there's a reason we're

not generals--!

EDDIE (V.0.)

I thought, by now, she'd be curing

cancer, directing movies, running

for the Senate...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

What had happened? Her life made no

sense. I mean, I could see a

direct, plausible link between this

Eddie, broke and buzzed at three

o'clock in the afternoon, and an

earlier Eddie...

EDDIE (V.0.)

...vomiting on his boss' desk

during a presentation...

(CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

... or stealing his dying Aunt's

Percocet.

EDDIE (V.0.)

But there was no link between my

Melissa and this upstate Melissa

dumped, cold-calling people from

her living room.

EDDIE (V.O.)

40 long blocks later I was "home."

EDDIE (V.0.)

Well. There was less than nothing

to lose.

16.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I didn't want to see anybody.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Especially not my landlord's nasty

young wife.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Tuesday.

VALERIE

Look, enough, okay--?

EDDIE

Just tell him-

VALERIE

Steve handles the rents. So feed

your fucking bullshit to him.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I suddenly had extra reason to get

away from her. I had thoughtlessly

ingested a substance.

VALERIE

--Like the rent's not low enough--!

EDDIE (V.0.)

I had gotten remarkably little

information from Vernon about what

this drug would do.

VALERIE

You could be a bike messenger and

come up with that!

(CONTINUED)

17.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.O.)

...What if it was a hallucinogen...

oh my God... listening to her rag,

if I were tripping...? I'd jump out

a fucking window.

VALERIE

--Look, I'm just telling you, he's

been talking about calling these

people he knows from the club to

muscle you out -- I've told him not

to do that, but he's really pissed.

EDDIE (V.0.)

And then... I felt it.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Levels more, layers more, 3-D

more... galactically more. But the

same. Just the depth and beauty...

of clarity.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

VALERIE

W-What?

EDDIE

"I was blind but now I see."

(CONTINUED)

18.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You don't like me, and I don't

blame you -- you see a schlumpy

energy- sucking defeated sack of

shit sponging off your husband.

You're hoping I'll blow my brains

out. But my existence shouldn't

make you this upset. What is it?

VALERIE

Look, that's none of your-

EDDIE

Something wrong at school?

VALERIE

How do you know I'm in school!

EDDIE

People who aren't don't usually

carry dry, academic constipated out

of print books about Dorothea

Lange.

VALERIE

Are you some kind of creep? Have

you been following me?!

EDDIE

I just saw the book--

VALERIE

You can only see a corner of it.

How did you know?

EDDIE

I've seen it before.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It was true. 12 years ago. In

college...

19.

EDDIE (V.O.)

...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I

was trying to make, waiting for her

to come back out of the bathroom...

hoping she'd have a condom...

BACK TO:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Somehow, my unconscious had served

that up... a memory I'd never even

recorded. Or was it there the whole

time... and all I needed... was the

access?

EDDIE (V.0.)

Vern was right. This was no

recreational drug.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

If you're writing a paper, that's

not the book I'd use.

VALERIE

Well, who asked y-

EDDIE

Cal Berkeley has her oral history.

I'd start there. Her son is still

alive. You could Google him. Sons

of famous people always want to

dish dirt about their parents.

You'd get something no one else

has, and you'd've gone the extra

mile, a nice little apple for the

professor.

(CONTINUED)

20.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Information from the odd museum

show, a half-read article, some PBS

documentary, was all bubbling up to

my frontal lobes, mixing itself

together into a sparkling cocktail

of useful information.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

She didn't have a chance.

EDDIE (V.0.)

We'd really worked on her paper,

too. In 45 minutes it was a

polished gem. She was pleased.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

One nice little side effect...? I

stayed hard for hours.

EDDIE (V.O.)

Happy and sore, I returned home.

(CONTINUED)

21.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

... But it couldn't be my home,

could it? Who would live like this?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

What was this drug? I couldn't stay

messy on it, I hadn't had a

cigarette in six hours...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious

and tidy. What was this -- a drug

for people who want to get anal?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just

clear. What I needed to do. And how

to do it.

EDDIE (V.0.)

The next morning, I sent a little

probe down into my brain. No surge

of brilliance came up to greet me.

I felt thick and stupid -- a

shuffling zombie without my coffee

and cigarette. In short...

(CONTINUED)

22.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I was back.

EDDIE (V.0.)

But something remained.

MARK

You're kidding.

EDDIE

No.

MARK

(SARCASTIC)

Words have appeared on paper.

EDDIE

Yes.

MARK SUTTON

Written by you.

EDDIE

Three pages. That's all you have to

read. If you read them in the next

hour, and you don't want to keep

reading I'll give back the advance.

23.

MARK SUTTON'S VOICE

Eddie... give me a call when you

get in... (BEEP)

MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in...

call me... it's a little grandiose,

but I'm still reading...

MARK SUTTON'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Okay, how did you do this? I'd, uh,

I'd really like to -- shit, just

call me the minute you get in,

call. Okay? Okay. (BEEP!)

EDDIE (V.O.)

But how would I finish? It was

"enhanced" Eddie who displayed all

that brilliance. Not me.

(CONTINUED)

24.

CONTINUED:

VERN'S VOICE

(GROGGY)

Yeah?

EDDIE

Vern! It's Eddie.

VERN'S VOICE

Bad time, okay--?

EDDIE

Vern -- last night 90 pages just

wrote themselves! I totally chucked

the novel I pitched them --I

suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole

societal economic class struggle --

and its solution -- didn't have to

be futuristic or fictional -- it

was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in

our lifetime -- and I could just

lay it out, like, like a manifesto,

or something, like Mein Kampf

except not by a crazy racist fuck!

(no response, realizing)

Okay, I won't talk any more about

this if you let me in.

VERN

Well, that was fast.

EDDIE

WHAT HAP-

VERN

Don't ask.

VERN (CONT'D)

So, Eddie. I guess you're

interested after all.

(CONTINUED)

25.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Yeah. That stuff's amazing.

VERNON

It works better if you're already

smart.

EDDIE

VERN-

VERN

You don't want to know.

EDDIE

What's... um... what's it called?

VERN

It doesn't have a street name yet,

because it doesn't have a street

profile. And that's the way we want

it to stay. The boys in the kitchen

are calling it MDT-48.

EDDIE

"The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern,

that doesn't sound FDA approved.

VERN

"FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did

you really believe that shit?

EDDIE (V.0.)

Okay, so what did we have here?

Some unknown, untested, possibly

dangerous drug scammed out of some

unidentified lab somewhere, given

to me by a highly unreliable guy I

hadn't seen in years.

VERN

So you want some more of it?

EDDIE

Yes. Definitely.

(CONTINUED)

26.

CONTINUED: (2)

VERN

We'll talk about it. But first

maybe you can do me a little favor.

EDDIE

Uh... sure.

VERN

You can see, I'm in no shape to go

out right now. Will you hop down to

the dry cleaners and get my suit?

And maybe pick me up a little

breakfast...?

EDDIE (V.0.)

It was amazing how quickly it all

slotted back into place...

EDDIE (V.0.)

..the dealer-client dynamic......

EDDIE (V.0.)

...the easy sacrificing of dignity

for the guaranteed return of a dime

bag, or a gram, or in this case a

little pill that was going to cost

me a month's rent.

27.

EDDIE

EDDIE

Yes... I... I need to report a

murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J.

I won't.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It took them forever. And the

longer I sat there, the clearer I

saw... Vern had known whoever had

done this. He'd opened the door.

EDDIE (V.0.)

And one guess what they'd been

looking for.

28.

EDDIE

At least you got your last meal.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You never did like to cook...

(CONTINUED)

29.

CONTINUED:

COP

Let me see your hands.

EDDIE

Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called

you!

EDDIE

... No, ex-wife's brother. I just

ran into him on the street and he

invited me up to, you know...

DETECTIVE

Buy some drugs?

EDDIE

Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --

DETECTIVE

Okay, fine, what did this guy do?

EDDIE

He was -- I don't know, I heard he

was sort of an antiques dealer.

DETECTIVE

A dealer?

EDDIE

Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind

of... chairs... sort of curlicue

leg kind of things--

DETECTIVE

(INTO PHONE)

Yeah. That is correct. An Edward

Morgan. He's here.

(CONTINUED)

30.

CONTINUED:

DETECTIVE (CONT'D)

The victim's sister.

EDDIE

Melissa?

MELISSA'S VOICE

Eddie. You were there?

EDDIE (V.O.)

I hadn't heard her voice in 10

years.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Right before. I'd just run into him

on the street.

MELISSA'S VOICE

God.

(BROKEN)

This is all so weird...

EDDIE

Melissa --you don't think I had

anything to do with-

MELISSA

No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I

wish I was more surprised. He

was... involved in some stuff... I

better not say any more.

EDDIE

Not on this line, no.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Melissa... maybe...

(a deep breath)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

31.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Do you want to... meet somewhere,

or...?

MELISSA'S VOICE

Eddie, I've got to do the funeral.

And God knows what else. I just...

we can't meet, okay?

EDDIE

Then... I'll see you at the

funeral.

MELISSA

No. I don't want that - please

don't... I'll call you at some

point, when this is over. Okay?

EDDIE

Okay.

MELISSA'S VOICE

Okay.

DETECTIVE

Something doesn't jell here.

EDDIE (V.O.)

But I knew, when his attention

wandered to something more

pressing, that he was going to let

me go.

(CONTINUED)

32.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Only then did it occur to me that

someone could have followed me from

Vern's apartment.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Probably not. Hopefully not.

Worth the risk?

MUSIC UP UNDER:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Back on MDT, it was obvious what I

should do.

(CONTINUED)

33.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Vern's cash...

EDDIE (V.0.)

...combined with an unprecedented

surge of motivation...

EDDIE

...enabled me to finish the book in

four days.

EDDIE (V.0.)

A tablet a day... kept the torpor

away. And what I could do with my

day... was limitless.

EDDIE (V.O.)

I now had cultural appetites.

(CONTINUED)

34.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Learned to read music in a week...

EDDIE V.0.

Even half-listening to any

language, I became fluent...

EDDIE (V.0.)

The only cloud was the nagging

feeling I was being followed.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Was I? Or did MDT create paranoia?

EDDIE (V.0.)

The focal point of my existence

quickly became... protecting my

stash.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Call it a homage.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I had a new, improved game.

(CONTINUED)

35.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

(PLAYFULLY)

So you're saying that any author

who's commandeered adjective

status, "Orwellian, Dickensian--"?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

--is prosaic. Yes.

EDDIE

Which means a prosaic author's work

rests on a foundation of acclaim-

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

OR ZEITGEIST-

EDDIE

So you're saying praise and fame

are unrelated to achievement, that

the greatest hits CD cannot

possibly contain good songs? That

Shakespeare's catchiness belies

mediocrity?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

I...

EDDIE

Well, then I'd guess you'd rather

not hear about what I, personally,

think could launch a thousand

ships?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Fish in a barrel.

EDDIE (V.0.)

And it wasn't just women. I was,

for the first time in my life, a

presence...

36.

EDDIE (V.O.)

Of course, all this seemed to work

better with people I didn't know...

than with people who knew me...

EDDIE

...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally

mis-invested -- these guys are have

done ONLY the most Pliocine era

fundamental analysis and paid no

attention to eye candy psychology

surrounding the stock --

(realizing they're lost)

Okay, remember when I explained

default flops? Did any of that

stick?

(THEY'RE LOST)

CDS's? CDO's CBO's?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I quickly returned to the

unfamiliar audience.

EDDIE

--Sure you get a short term spike,

but wouldn't that rapid expansion

devalue the stock completely in two

years?

KEVIN DOYLE

No, no, there are safeguards--

(CONTINUED)

37.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Against aggressive over-expansion?

There aren't, because there are no

safeguards in human nature.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

We're wired to overreach -- you

look at history, I mean, all the

countries that ruled the world?

Portugal? With its big, butch navy?

All that's left is salt cod and

cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they

just sit on their dank little

island, fussing over their suits.

Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're

doing pretty well, we've got Poland

and France, and a big Swiss bank

account -- let's not invade Russia

in the winter! Let's go home and

pop a beer and live off the

interest!

KEVIN DOYLE

(smiles, gets it)

Yeah. It'll all happen again.

EDDIE

Hey, I want in on it!

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

My brain was just pouring this

stuff out. Everything I'd ever

read, heard, seen, was now

organized and available --here it

is, here you go..

KEVIN DOYLE

You must have a portfolio, but if

you don't, I'd be very interested

in working with you.

(CONTINUED)

38.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Thank you so much.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

"I must have a portfolio." Very

well -- if I must, I must.

EDDIE (V.O.)

But Vern's cash was low. And it

takes cash to make cash...

EDDIE (V.O.)

But it takes cash to make cash...

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I'd like to re-negotiate my

advance.

DUNHAM

Well... sit down, we'll be

discussing that.

MARK SUTTON

First, ah... I want to apologize,

Eddie, if I in any way communicated

a lack of faith in your abilities.

MARK SUTTON (CONT'D)

Mr. Dunham has read your pages, and

we're prepared to make you what I

hope will be a very exciting offer.

DUNHAM

What would you say to ten thousand

more and another forty down the

road?

(CONTINUED)

39.

CONTINUED:

DUNHAM (CONT'D)

We think this could be an important

title, maybe one in a series. I

have to say, you came out of

nowhere, but the good ones always

DO-

EDDIE

(INTERRUPTING HIM)

This isn't going to work.

DUNHAM

What's not going to work? The

money?

MARK SUTTON

Eddie, we take you very seriously

as a writer.

EDDIE

Yes, but I now see that writing, as

a profession, is for marginalized

whiners not fit for anything else.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

No, I mean it, look at the life.

Incarceration, loneliness,

burrowing down into your own

psyche, increasingly insulated from

any truth, because you're not in

the currents of the world any more,

you're rattling around inside the

cage of your brain, self-

cannibalizing...

DUNHAM

You don't think a best-selling

author would disagree?

(CONTINUED)

40.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE

Oh, if you're good, there's some

remuneration, eventually, after

paperbacks, but at best your

career'll be oozing along like a

snail, a few thousand more copies,

whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a

readership," -- for what? So you

can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday

night reading from your own work at

some holdout indie book store to a

bored audience of ten? --Half of

them there for the wine and cheese?

MARK SUTTON

Yes, but if your goal is to have a

VOICE-

EDDIE

(INTERRUPTING)

I don't think any goal will be

really achievable, Mark, until I'm

sitting on a large pile of cash.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I would have to start very, very

small... in a down market. No one

was making money. But no one had

MDT...

DAY TRADER

You've got your quantitive analysis

- "quants..." Algorhythms to find

minute price discrepancies...

you're looking at numbers only.

Price and volume patterns...

41.

EDDIE

Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars,

I made 4000 in a day.

(BEAT)

It was too slow.

TIME/DAY CUT TO:

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Next day: $7,500.00

(BEAT)

Still too slow. I needed more

capital...

EDDIE

Why not?

GENNADY

Because I don't see you before. And

I don't fucking like you already.

Why do I give you 100 thousand

dollars?

EDDIE

Because I quintupled my money four

days in a row.

GENNADY

You're lucky.

EDDIE

It's not luck.

GENNADY

Okay, you tricked their computer,

you got some fix on the game.

(CONTINUED)

42.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

You think?

GENNADY

So you're a crook.

EDDIE

And that's a problem for you

because--?

GENNADY

You people all get caught.

EDDIE

I won't. And what if I do? You

think I keep detailed records of my

investors? You'll have your money

back long before they figure out

what happened.

GENNADY

Okay, you take this... you mine.

You don't pay, you know what we do?

We cut you around the waist, peel

your skin, pull it up over your

head and tie knot in it. And you

don't die from that. You suffocate.

(CONTINUED)

43.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed

me how you could leverage two and a

half times your cash at a day-

trading firm...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I'd been upping the dose for over a

week. It seemed to cut my learning

curve.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It was instinct. But informed

instinct -- instinct based on huge

amounts of research, which, thanks

to MDT, was conducted more rapidly

and comprehensively than anyone at

Lafayette Day Trading would ever

know...

TRADER BEHIND HIM

Why are you buying that? The CEO

just got indicted...

EDDIE

But not for the big fat defense

contract he bribed his way into.

That's still on. Should be

announced in a week.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

At the end of the week my brokerage

account contained... over a million

dollars.

SHOT"-

(CONTINUED)

44.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.O.)

I'd heard the old metaphors about

the stock market: it was a

collective nervous system, a global

brain, a numerical representation

of the will of God...

EDDIE (V.O.)

Whatever it was, I was jacked in,

booted up - my mind was living

tissue inside the greater,

functioning whole.

(BEAT)

By the end of the second week I had

2.6 in the bank....

EDDIE (V.0.)

The word quickly got out.

EDDIE'S MACHINE

You have... 19 messages.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Four job offers... my bank, raising

my line of credit... a reporter...

FEMALE VOICE

Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan,

this article's about you's gonna

get written with or without your

cooperation... (BEEP!)

EDDIE (V.0.)

(SARDONIC)

All my new friends.

GENNADY'S VOICE

...you stupid shit, I be there

Thursday for the money, ten

o'clock!

(CONTINUED)

45.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to

sound casual.

KEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE

Eddie, I was having drinks with a

friend of mine, and... ah, you

won't believe this...

LINDY

Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

EDDIE

Apparently he does.

LINDY

But you're not in the finance game.

What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

(shaking her head,

MYSTIFIED)

Eddie-- I --

LINDY (CONT'D)

Since when do you speak... what

happened to you?

EDDIE

Self-improvement month. Someone

gave me a wake-up call.

(CONTINUED)

46.

CONTINUED:

LINDY

God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about

that.

EDDIE

Why? It stuck, didn't it?

LINDY

You didn't do all this for me.

EDDIE

Who says I didn't? So what -- it's

not getting over? Is that it?

LINDY

All right, all right -- boy, you

are really begging for it.

EDDIE

Begging for what.

LINDY

"I'm proud of you."

EDDIE

Gosh. This is so unexpected.

LINDY

I'm actually... more than proud.

I'm a little...

LINDY (CONT'D)

... intimidated.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Of course, we started up again.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Her place...

47.

EDDIE (V.O.)

My place...

EDDIE (V.0.)

Every place.

LINDY

What are you doing, hon?

EDDIE

Nothing.

LINDY

What, you think somebody's

watching?

EDDIE

No.

LINDY

Is there anything you want to tell

me, Eddie? Now's the time.

EDDIE

With success comes enemies.

LINDY

Old Chinese proverb?

(CONTINUED)

48.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

No proverb. An inevitability.

LINDY

You should sleep. Isn't your Van

Loon meeting tomorrow?

LINDY (CONT'D)

What. What.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Then... I found myself at the door.

With no consciousness that I had

moved.

LINDY

Are you all right?

LINDA

When was the last time you ate

something?

EDDIE (V.O.)

It had been three days.

KEVIN

Hey.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

He'll be here in ten. Now look,

since we have a minute, be warned:

Van Loon's mercurial.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

49.

CONTINUED:

KEVIN (CONT'D)

One minute your best friend, the

next...you're a leper. And he needs

direct answers... anything

tentative and you've lost him

forever. I think we should rehearse

a few scenarios..

EDDIE

I'm eating, Kevin.

KEVIN

You up for this? You sure? Because

I've got a little bit on the line

HERE-

EDDIE

Have a toast point.

VAN LOON

So. Eddie Morgan.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

What's your secret?

EDDIE

Medication. I'm on special

medication.

50.

EDDIE

--Yes, that's partially what I'm

SAYING--

PIERCE

(CONTEMPTUOUSLY)

Pattern recognition? So that's your

snake-oil? Look, if there's one

thing we all understand, it's

understanding itself --that's how

the business works...

(SCOFFING)

Pattern recognition. Please.

EDDIE

(POINTEDLY)

Of course, not everyone can

understand the patterns.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Look, there's no time for human

judgement anymore. You see a

chance, you blink, and it's gone.

We entered the age of

decentralized, online decision-

making, with the decisions being

made by hundreds of millions of

individual investors around the

world, people who don't even know

each other -- making a killing in

less time than it takes to sneeze.

PIERCE

Until they weren't.

EDDIE

Same rules, even in a panic. It's

not understanding how companies

work. It's understanding how mass

psychology works.

PIERCE

(SCOFFING)

And you have a formula.

(CONTINUED)

51.

CONTINUED:

KEVIN

(MEDIATING)

Well, from 12 thousand to two point

eight million in ten days--

EDDIE

Yes. I do have a formula, Mr.

Pierce.

PIERCE

(SNORTING)

Delusions of grandeur.

EDDIE

I don't have delusions of grandeur.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I have an actual recipe for

grandeur.

KEVIN

..and, oh, you know, she's on the

wait list... Rosemary's pretty

devastated...

VAN LOON

My daughter went there. I'll call

the school for you.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

Eddie. Ride?

(CONTINUED)

52.

CONTINUED:

VAN LOON

I don't know who you are, Eddie, or

what your game is, but I'm sure of

one thing: you don't work in this

business. I'm up to my ass in

investment guys, and you don't have

their half-cocky, half-terrified

line of bullshit. Which is not to

say I like yours any better.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

But you obviously pick your stocks

in a way I haven't seen. So tell

me. We're thinking of acquiring

these companies. Take a few

minutes. What's your take on them?

EDDIE

But these companies aren't the

question, are they?

VAN LOON

What do you mean?

EDDIE

Well -- you're upmarket energy --

what do you want with these little

solar/windmill/hippie outfits?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

--Unless you wanted to play both

sides of the fence, control the

whole energy enchilada. But these

wouldn't get you there in emerging

markets. You'd need...

(CONTINUED)

53.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa. This must be some big-

ass merger you're contemplating.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

And there's really only one company

with enough bling to justify a

merger with Van Loon Associates...

VAN LOON

Have you been talking to somebody-?

EDDIE

Carl, it's just rationalization.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Is Hank Atwood going to go for it?

VAN LOON

You are either an amazing con

artist or a very smart young man.

EDDIE

Come on -- the two of you together?

The world would have to come to you

begging for energy like Oliver

Twist with his little bowl of

gruel.

VAN LOON

You realize that if the press got

one whisper of -- I can't fucking

believe I'm even discussing this--

EDDIE

It doesn't matter. It won't come

off.

(CONTINUED)

54.

CONTINUED: (2)

VAN LOON

The word "brazen" does not even

begin to go there.

EDDIE

You'd have to back off Libya.

VAN LOON

Why? He's come this far--

EDDIE

I don't think you'd want to hear

about it from some shmuck who needs

a ride home.

VAN LOON

You're a gusty little prick, Eddie.

EDDIE

Ooh. Now you're curious.

VAN LOON

Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a

couple pretty big buttons. Go on.

Tell me what you think.

EDDIE

(DISMISSIVE)

It's getting late.

VAN LOON

All right. You get your shot. Come

to my office, tomorrow at ten, and

tell me just exactly how the

schmuck who needs the ride would re-

structure this deal.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

And you better be prepared.

EDDIE

I'm at your disposal.

VAN LOON

You don't really live here...?

(CONTINUED)

55.

CONTINUED: (3)

EDDIE

The Spartans weren't big on

amenities.

VAN LOON

Yeah. And they eventually got their

asses kicked.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I didn't go in.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I wanted to walk, move, digest,

ingest...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

There are moments in life, moments

when you know you've crossed a

bridge, your old life is over. Van

Loon was my bridge. One week, two

weeks from now, I would be

hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying

to Dubai for meetings, blowing off

supermodels, vacationing in Medici

villas... And that too, was only a

bridge...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Suddenly...

CUT TO:

EDDIE (V.0.)

There was another skip.

(CONTINUED)

56.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

How had I gone that last 20 blocks?

I got another ten...

EDDIE (V.0.)

... then...

EDDIE (V.0.)

I was back uptown.

EDDIE (V.0.)

What bar was this? Was it

Harlem...?

EDDIE (V.0.)

Same bar? Different bar? How long

had passed...?

EDDIE (V.0.)

And it happened again--

57.

EDDIE (V.0.)

And again...

EDDIE (V.0.)

And again...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

And again...

EDDIE (V.0.)

When it finally stopped, I couldn't

account for the last eight hours of

my life.

(CONTINUED)

58.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

There was nothing to do but walk

home.

EDDIE (V.0.)

It was my first sleep in two days.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Should I? Would I start "skipping

time" again?

EDDIE (V.0.)

Even off MDT, I decided to give Van

Loon's files a shot.

EDDIE (V.0.)

They were fucking hieroglyphs.

(CONTINUED)

59.

CONTINUED:

KEVIN

Hello--? Eddie--? What are you

talking about?

EDDIE

I can't make the meeting, I'm,

uh... I'm sick.

KEVIN

Yeah, well, you can't have the

fucking flu right now -- he'll

never give you this chance again!

EDDIE

I need to, ah, analyze this data-

EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Already I recognized it... the

thick tongue, the leaden synapses.

It was regular Eddie - the Eddie

that, now, was unbearable to be.

KEVIN

... Don't you get it?! This is your

test--!

EDDIE

Well, I can't pass a fucking test

right now!

KEVIN

And how am I going to look if you

don't?

EDDIE

Okay, Kevin. Okay.

(CONTINUED)

60.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It was my first morning off MDT in

a month. The beginnings of a

headache was curling around my head

like a big fat, greasy python.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

But the time-skips had me scared.

EDDIE (V.O.)

My thought -- such as I had one --

was to tap dance with Van Loon

until I could find out more about

MDT.

VAN LOON

What do you know about Hank Atwood?

EDDIE

Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot

of Colorado...

VAN LOON

Uh-huh. So this is "prepared,"

Eddie?

EDDIE

What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone

knows about Atwood.

VAN LOON

Where was he two years ago?

(CONTINUED)

61.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Nowhere.

VAN LOON

Two years ago Forbes didn't even

have him on the radar.

EDDIE

Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.

VAN LOON

The guy comes on, out of nowhere,

so fucking strong he has me on the

run. Beat me out of two properties,

invests in bumfuck countries with

no oil, places I wouldn't go near,

sextuples his money.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

...Always picks green technologies,

invests in them, and a year later

he owns them.

ANCHORWOMAN

... found dead in her hotel room

last night, victim of foul play.

VAN LOON

...100 billion if he has a

nickel... and I have to convince

him, somehow, that I can raise his

game.

ANCHORWOMAN

EDDIE

Excuse me.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I couldn't have.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

...or could I?

EDDIE (V.O.)

If I could walk, talk, conduct

business, seduce a woman, fight--

We're talking now.

EDDIE

Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the

street. At two.

MELISSA

You can't see me, Eddie.

EDDIE

Please. Melissa -- it's important,

please come -- you have to tell me

what you're talking about!

EDDIE (V.0.)

I realized that there were other

Vernon's other clients.

You look good.

EDDIE

I guess I lost some weight...

MELISSA

Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

I know you've been doing it. I just

stocks? Second-guessing the

markets? You? Come on.

EDDIE

Since when do you read the Post?

MELISSA

These days, the Post's about all I

can read.

EDDIE

Melissa, what do you mean?

MELISSA

I mean, I did it too. And I only

took nine or ten hits. Vernon

didn't tell you any of this, did

he?

EDDIE

No.

MELISSA

Well, when he told me about this

amazing new drug...

MELISSA (CONT'D)

I was like, down the hatch. And it

was amazing. I read Brian Greene's

The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes

and understood it. My work rate

increased... just, insanely,

overnight. My boss started to hate

me -- they offered me his job. And

then I got scared.

EDDIE

Why?

MELISSA

I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can

keep up that level of mental

activity and not crash. I stopped

taking it.

EDDIE

And...?

MELISSA

I got sick. Headaches, throwing

up... I went back to Vernon to see

if I maybe shouldn't take another

hit, or half a hit, and then he

told me about... about the people

who were dying. One guy didn't die,

but he's a vegetable, his mother

has to sponge him down every day...

(BEAT)

How much have you been taking,

Eddie?

EDDIE

A lot.

MELISSA

Well, maybe they've worked out the

bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the

same batch...

You're off it right now, aren't

you?

EDDIE

Yeah.

MELISSA

Are you getting a headache?

EDDIE

Finish your story.

MELISSA

Well, I didn't take more. And I

didn't die. But after a while I

found I couldn't concentrate on

anything for longer than ten

minutes. I missed deadlines. I got

lazy... and slow... put on

weight... the magazine let me go.

My husband checked out. Sex? Get

out of here.

MELISSA (CONT'D)

That was two years ago, and I

haven't been the same since. I

can't read any more -- I mean, the

fucking New York Post?

MELISSA (CONT'D)

After this, I'm going to have a

migraine for three days. And I've

got to pee. Which is another thing.

EDDIE (V.0.)

How many times had I thought of

her, my first real love...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

But that Melissa had unraveled in

time and space -- she was a ghost

now. I was never going to see her

again, never bump into her in the

street...

70.

MELISSA

You have some left? Good. Go home

and take it. Take the dose down,

but don't just stop -- you'll die

if you just stop. Try to taper off.

Otherwise, the headache's just the

beginning... I have to go--

EDDIE

But when I run out--

MELISSA

I don't know. I have to go--

EDDIE

Who invented MDT?

MELISSA

I don't know--

Goodbye, Eddie.

EDDIE

Hi -- Have you got it?

LINDY

Yes. --Eddie, there's someone

following me.

EDDIE

Are you sure?

LINDY

He got into the cab behind me, and

they're making every turn I'm

making!

(CONTINUED)

77.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Don't get out.

LINDY

What the fuck did you put me in the

middle of--?!

EDDIE

Call the cops.

LINDY

(PANICKING)

There's traffic. We're slowing

down...

(to the driver)

Go around him! Go around!

(TO EDDIE)

Shit! We're stopped dead.

(A GASP)

He's getting out, Eddie -- he's

walking over here-

EDDIE

LINDY--!!!

TAN COAT

LINDY

LINDY

Help! Help!!

(CONTINUED)

78.

CONTINUED:

LINDY (CONT'D)

There's... a... man... chasing me.

He has a long, tan --

LINDY (CONT'D)

Are you still there?

EDDIE

Yes. What's happening?

LINDY

I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll

find me!

EDDIE

Just be still, stop talking.

LINDY

He killed a cop--

EDDIE

What?

LINDY

He's going to kill me, Eddie!

EDDIE

Listen to me. Can he see you?

LINDY

(CRYING)

You fucking asshole--

(CONTINUED)

79.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Can he see you?!

LINDY

Not yet. --I don't know what to do!

What do I do--!

EDDIE

There is something.

LINDY

What?!

EDDIE

Listen to me. Reach into the bag

and take one of the pills.

LINDY

S-swallow one of those things?!

EDDIE

Yes.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You will know what do to, Lindy.

Take one, and you'll know.

LINDY

He's got a knife -- I can't think

my way out of a knife--!

EDDIE

You'll come on in thirty seconds.

And yes, you will think your way

out, that's what it does. Are you

taking it--?

LINDY

(A BEAT)

Yes. He's getting closer.

EDDIE

Lindy. I love you.

(A BEAT)

--Lindy? Are you there?

(CONTINUED)

80.

CONTINUED: (2)

LINDY

Eddie...? I feel it.

LINDY'S

LINDY

81.

EDDIE

We'll stay here for a couple of

days. We'll be powered up, we'll be

able to think our way out of

this...

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I'm back. All right?

LINDY

Who's back, Eddie?

EDDIE

I can take care of you now.

LINDY

That was never what I wanted.

EDDIE

A lot's going to happen for us. And

everything that I will have... I

will share with you. I will love

you.

LINDY

You know... you were always smart.

You could have done this. Not

this... but some of these things...

maybe a third of these things...

without any smart drug at all. A

third of all this... to most

people...? ...would be plenty.

(CONTINUED)

82.

CONTINUED:

LINDY (CONT'D)

I understand that stuff now, Eddie.

And I don't blame you for taking

it. No one could ever tell you,

till you take it, what it can do.

Invincibility in a bottle. And I

know I'm going to think about

taking it again every day for the

rest of my life.

LINDY (CONT'D)

But once you can see everything

that way, mapped out like that, on

a grid... and always be right...?

Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want

to fuck up? Who'd want to be human?

LINDY (CONT'D)

I just came up to say goodbye. I

don't ever want to see you again.

I'm not even going to stay in New

York. Don't try to find me, and

don't try to help me.

EDDIE

Looking for me?

(CONTINUED)

83.

CONTINUED:

GENNADY

You think you can run out on me?

You think I don't know where you

are?

EDDIE

I was under the impression that our

business was settled.

GENNADY

Walk.

EDDIE

So now you're going to rob me? I

thought you were a businessman.

GENNADY

I want some more of that shit.

EDDIE

What shit.

GENNADY

The pills.

EDDIE

Well, so do I. You took the last

one.

GENNADY

So you get me more.

EDDIE

I can't get more -- the dealer's

dead.

GENNADY

Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because

how you gonna go to those fancy

meetings with your nose fed to my

dog?

(CONTINUED)

84.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE

Nothing. I. Can. Do.

GENNADY

Make some calls. One hundred pills.

EDDIE

A hundred can't happen. The

dealer's dead, I have to call three

people to even get a line on--

GENNADY

You know I don't really do this. So

clean, like this. What I do to you,

I do in stages.

EDDIE

I might... be able to get ten.

GENNADY

Ten. Fuck your ten.

EDDIE

(holding his ground)

Ten. And no guarantee there's more.

GENNADY

Oh, I think guarantee.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Self-pity and MDT were not

compatible. One has to go on...

EDDIE (V.0.)

...Patch up what's left...

85.

VAN LOON

I won't deny you pissed me off,

Eddie.

EDDIE

I was sick. I shouldn't have gone

to the meeting. I tried to cancel,

but Kevin imploded on me--

VAN LOON

I didn't know who or what I was

talking to.

EDDIE

A hundred and five, is what you

were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

VAN LOON

Look, there can't be any

instability. Not when you're

playing at this level.

EDDIE

I sent over my revised projections--

VAN LOON

I didn't ask for your projections.

EDDIE

I know, but I think if you look at

THEM-

VAN LOON

I already have.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

As a matter of fact, there were

firings over your projections.

EDDIE

I'm sorry.

VAN LOON

...some things my team missed. So,

oddly enough, I find myself...

needing to fill a position.

(CONTINUED)

86.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Two months after I started MDT, I

was helping broker the most

important merger in corporate

history.

EDDIE (V.O.)

I found that if I maintained an

even dose... remembered to eat...

drank no alcohol... the blackouts

didn't recur.

EDDIE (V.0.)

I was quickly back up to speed...

EDDIE

Is it possible to construct an...

imperceptible compartment?

TAILOR

Certainly, sir. How large?

EDDIE

Quite large.

(CONTINUED)

87.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I would never again stash my MDT,

not in an apartment, not in Fort

Knox.

EDDIE

I don't want it known that I have

any security. You won't precede me,

you'll follow me, never less than

ten steps behind... `inconspicuous'

doesn't begin to describe you.

You're not there. You're a CEO'S

wife -- you're wallpaper.

EDDIE (V.O.)

Safer though my stash now was, I

was not sitting around until it ran

out.

TECHNICIAN

Well, it's nothing you can cook up

on a stove top. Whoever made it,

it's a real pro act.

EDDIE

Can you make more?

TECHNICIAN

Can I combine these ingredients in

the same exact quantities? Yes.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

88.

CONTINUED:

TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)

But the exact method of delivery to

the brain...? Darts at a

dartboard.

EDDIE

Meaning...?

TECHNICIAN

Clinical trials. Guinea pig

people.

EDDIE

That's too long.

TECHNICIAN

It's what it is. Or you'll kill

people. You need twelve, eighteen

MONTHS--

EDDIE

Two million dollars if you do it in

six.

EDDIE (V.O.)

It was all going to work out...

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I thought we straightened this out,

Detective.

DETECTIVE

This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr.

Morgan.

(CONTINUED)

89.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

What is it about?

DETECTIVE

A witness identified the Donatella

Alvarez suspect as this person. You

want to tell me about your

whereabouts on the night of June

12?

EDDIE (V.0.)

Luckily, I could now afford Morris

Brandt, the best lawyer in New

York.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Time was bought, and I was released

-- for now.

MORRIS BRANDT

You're lucky somebody wiped the

room. Weak circumstantial at best.

Just between us -- were you there?

EDDIE

I don't remember.

MORRIS BRANDT

(SHRUGS)

Busy life.

(CONTINUED)

90.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood

remained unaware that soon, I would

be in a witness lineup as a

possible murderer.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

...well, a unified front between

Van Loon and Atwood would be

lethally effective, and not a

moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine

and others are jockeying for the

same industrial concessions in

Mexico that both our companies are

secretly sniffing out...

HANK ATWOOD

How do you know this?

EDDIE

Well, the governmental bribe

structure is, in itself, corrupt,

so of course information about its

inner workings, like anything, can

be bought. And there are other

barbarians waving cash at the

gates. I have a list here, in

descending order of threat...

ATWOOD

Go on.

VAN LOON

Eddie...? What's your read.

EDDIE

It flew. Of course, he's not going

to tell you right now...

(CONTINUED)

91.

CONTINUED:

VAN LOON

Jesus. He seems frail.

EDDIE

Might be an act.

VAN LOON

Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even

60.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

So, Eddie. What are you going to

do?

EDDIE

When this is over?

(SMILES)

I don't know. You haven't given me

the answer.

VAN LOON

You haven't asked the question.

EDDIE

All right. If all this comes

off... what's my take?

VAN LOON

You should have pre-negotiated.

EDDIE

I trust you.

VAN LOON

You shouldn't.

EDDIE

Well, given the scale of my

contribution, it can't be anything

lese than forty. Let's say forty-

five.

VAN LOOK

Done. Forty five thousand dollars.

(CONTINUED)

92.

CONTINUED: (2)

VAN LOON

Forty million's plenty, Eddie.

There's plenty more where this came

from.

VAN LOOK

...But you're not going to continue

working for me, are you?

VAN LOON

Don't lie. You're already bored.

Onto the next...?

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

I would really love to know what,

after a forty million dollar

payout, is "next" to you. But

you're not going to tell me that,

either.

(SMILES)

And I'm not sure I want to know.

Might singe my ego.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

I'll open a line of credit for you.

Even a tough nut like you's going

to want a few toys.

REALTOR

... three restaurants, health club,

of course, a private screening

room, wine cellar, walk-in

humidor... unparalleled, three-tier

security system...

(CONTINUED)

93.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

What is the asking price?

REALTOR

Twelve point five.

EDDIE (V.O.)

It was, as it turned out, a good

moment to move.

EDDIE (V.O.)

No one knew, or would ever know,

that I now carried the pills with

me at all times.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Right away, it was obvious he was

on MDT.

GENNADY

Next week...? I require twenty

pills.

EDDIE

Next week? You can fuck yourself.

(BEAT)

Not that you'll feel anything.

(CONTINUED)

94.

CONTINUED:

GENNADY

I don't think your Forbes 400 new

financial friends would appreciate

the details of your little dilemma

with the police?

GENNADY (CONT'D)

Thursday. You have them here.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Obviously, this could not go on.

But there is very little on this

earth that 45 million dollars can't

solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood

would sign the papers.

PIERCE

Well, you want to call it?

ASSOCIATE #1

Cold feet.

VAN LOON

There was all last night to tell us

that.

VAN LOON (CONT'D)

No call?

SECRETARY'S VOICE

Not yet.

(CONTINUED)

95.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Okay, the decision could have

changed -- that makes sense -- but

the discourtesy doesn't.

(BEAT)

It's still on.

PIERCE

(SARCASTIC)

Oh, based on your graphs and

projections?

EDDIE

(CALMLY REPEATING)

I saw his eyes: it's on.

PIERCE

You know, remind me: who the fuck,

exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry,

Carl, I'm about at the end with

this unqualified, posturing little-

VAN LOON

Pull it back, Pierce.

PIERCE

Since when is this little pisher

the fucking Delphi Oracle?!

VAN LOON

PIERCE-

SECRETARY'S VOICE

(INTERRUPTING)

Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here.

VAN LOON

Pierce, you can stay.

MRS. ATWOOD

I wanted this to be as confidential

as possible.

(CONTINUED)

96.

CONTINUED:

MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D)

My husband experienced some pain

and dizziness this morning. He's at

Lenox Hill, undergoing tests.

MRS. ATWOOD (CONT'D)

Obviously, it wouldn't be in our

best interests for this to be

reported by the press, as it might

put some of his interests at risk.

I just want you to know that we

have every intention of signing the

contract, and, as soon as he is

able, we will proceed.

EDDIE

I realize that this is a useless

platitude, but... if there's

anything we can do...

VAN LOON

Obviously we want to be as helpful

and respectful as possible.

MRS. ATWOOD

Thank you so much. I rely on your

discretion.

VAN LOON

(LOW)

You think there's a proxy?

EDDIE

Cagey fuck like him giving away

power of attorney?

(CONTINUED)

97.

CONTINUED:

VAN LOON

Well. He'd better get better.

EDDIE (V.0.)

But Atwood wouldn't get better.

Because Atwood was out of MDT.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Well. Why be surprised? How many

other meteoric rises might be

explained by MDT? At least I had

some; my life wasn't in jeopardy.

Only my money...

EDDIE (V.0.)

...and my liberty.

MORRIS BRANDT

I've been all over them... we can't

allow any disparity in race or

physical type between you and the

rest of the lineup -- they're as

close to your clones as I could

possibly get away with -- it's

going to be one big handsome blur

to this guy-

FEMALE COP

Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change

your jacket.

(CONTINUED)

98.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Why?

MORRIS BRANDT

Oh, that's me... I want everyone in

the same shirt, better for the blur

factor...

EDDIE

Of course.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Who was out there? The woman's

husband? Was some bellboy I

undertipped about to end my life?

MORRIS BRANDT

Not the dimmest clue. He was

dithering.

MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)

"Maybe the third from the right...

No not him..." --Oh. Here you go.

MORRIS BRANDT (CONT'D)

(re: the jacket)

Thing of beauty. You had it made?

99.

EDDIE (V.0.)

They'd kept me all day.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I'd missed my meeting with Gennady.

EDDIE (V.O.)

But I had more important

business...

FEMALE NEWSCASTER

...And the Dow has been yo-yoing

all day, amidst speculation that

Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood

have negotiated a merger...

VAN LOON

Have you been talking to anyone?

EDDIE

Not a word, Carl.

VAN LOON

Where have you been, Eddie--? This

is the second time you've turned to

VAPOR--

(CONTINUED)

100.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE

Personal time, Carl. Phone off.

You're not telling me there's been

any movement.

VAN LOON

No. Atwood's in a coma.

EDDIE

A coma?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It had gotten out, somehow. But I

felt thick, stupid, tired. A small

pain was starting behind my eyes.

I'd been unable to take my MDT, and

I was overdue.

EDDIE (V.0.)

Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The

police station? A coat room? How?

How?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

In an hour I'd be useless. In two

I'd be sick. In 24, dead.

101.

VAN LOON

Eddie--? This came for you.

VAN LOON

What are you doing, Eddie--?

EDDIE--!!!

EDDIE (V.O.)

I couldn't think.

EDDIE (V.O.)

Only MDT could help me. I had no

MDT. And then...

(CONTINUED)

102.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

One thought.

(BEAT)

Was there anywhere...

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

... anywhere at all...I could have

left one pill...?

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I had to keep thinking. Somewhere

safe...

MRS. HANK ATWOOD

There is absolutely no truth to the

rumor of this merger. None

whatsoever. My husband is having

some tests, this is a difficult

time, and I would appreciate your

directing further questions to our

attorney...

EDDIE (V.0.)

It wasn't downstairs security,

alerting me to a visitor.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

103.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

It was my inner door. Someone was

in the building, ten feet away,

right now.

EDDIE (V.O.)

And so... here I am.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I knew they would kill me, slowly

and horribly. But this choice would

at least be mine.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

But we're instinctive creatures. We

want to live.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

104.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

So, my foggy brain tried to

remember... where one tablet of

MDT... might be.

EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It was possible. And possible was

enough.

DRILL:

EDDIE'S HAND

(CONTINUED)

105.

CONTINUED:

GENNADY

I told you I want more. You don't

listen. Maybe you think I'm

joking...

GENNADY (CONT'D)

But I'm down to this last one.

GENNADY (CONT'D)

See, I dissolve pill in solution.

You shoot it - goes straight into

blood and to brain. Works much

better.

GENNADY (CONT'D)

Now. Where do you keep yours?

EDDIE

I'm plum out.

GENNADY

They will find it. Or I will make

you tell me. Which is quicker? We

see, huh?

(CONTINUED)

106.

CONTINUED: (2)

GENNADY

This is a waste of my time, you

know that? I am getting out of this

part of the business... starting

import-export company. Very

exciting stuff. A lot on my plate.

I need to learn to delegate...

GENNADY (CONT'D)

First, I will cut skin from you,

flay you... you stay alive nice

long time... then maybe we cut meat

from you, steaks... or maybe softer

parts... I get inspiration...

ON EDDIE

GENNADY

GENNADY (CONT'D)

WHAT--

(CONTINUED)

107.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.O.)

Not much of a triumph, was it?

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Because I would die here, too.

EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Only MDT could help me, and the

last of it was in this fuck's

bloodstream...

(CONTINUED)

108.

CONTINUED:

THE THUGS

INTO--

(CONTINUED)

109.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE (V.0.)

Later, it would be noted that my

neighbor was in the music business.

One of his drug deals had obviously

gone bad...

(BEAT)

And the night was still young.

110.

EDDIE

I'm sure you're curious about

what's happened to your boss. I

certainly am. If my attorney was

really working for Mr. Atwood, to

save his life, then why is he dead?

At what point was the Pony Express

supposed to ride in with the life-

saving medication?

(A BEAT)

Or, did the Pony decide that he

should be running his own Pony

show? Minus the dog.

EDDIE (V.O.)

I would not go back. I would not be

stopped.

FADE OUT.

111.

REUBEN

...actually, no, there's no more

tickets. --Yeah, I know, an

overbooked fundraiser -- there's a

first -- well, here he comes, I'll

ask him -- Edward!!

REUBEN (CONT'D)

I think we're looking at a second,

overflow event-- there's a wave of

donations coming in -- and I don't

think they're even going to try a

second debate -- don't go yet --

EDDIE

I have a lunch.

REUBEN

John Steadman's in there.

EDDIE

Who's that?

REUBEN

--Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're

your biggest contributor, give him

his two shitty little minutes.

EDDIE

Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they --

research?

REUBEN

Pharmaceuticals.

112.

STEADMAN

Mr. Morgan.

EDDIE

Nice to see you.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

We appreciate everything you've

done for us--

STEADMAN

Well, you've done most of it for

yourself. Senator Morgan.

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

I mean, everything from here's a

technicality, isn't it, Eddie?

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

I think we both know where it's

heading...

(A BEAT)

If... you can maintain.

EDDIE

Maintain?

STEADMAN

Eventually you'll run out. I just

want you to know we're here to help

you.

EDDIE

What are you saying?

(CONTINUED)

113.

CONTINUED:

STEADMAN

We've gotten most of the bugs out.

It's longer lasting - you'll only

have to take one a week.

EDDIE

Have you been watching me from the

beginning?

STEADMAN

No. Those of you who indulged...

distinguished yourselves very

quickly. You made yourselves clear

to us.

EDDIE

Who's "us?"

STEADMAN

You went the furthest with it the

fastest, so of course, to us,

you're the most interesting.

EDDIE

How did it get on the street?

STEADMAN

Security breach. That was never

our intention. We took care of it.

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

It will never again be on the

street. It will never publicly

exist. Obviously I don't need to

detail the advantages for you.

EDDIE

And what about for you? Why don't

you take it?

STEADMAN

We don't have to. You'll take it

for us.

(CONTINUED)

114.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE

And in return...? I do what.

STEADMAN

Just keep on doing what you're

doing. We won't bother you much at

first.

EDDIE

And later...? What will you be

"bothering" me with?

STEADMAN

Well, given where you're heading,

some of our ideas are... grandiose.

But, I think, achievable.

EDDIE

And if I don't like your ideas?

STEADMAN

Then we'll say Godspeed. And your

candle will have shed a brief, but

lovely, light.

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

But let's not even go there. Right

now you should feel relieved, your

problems are over. We just want to

keep you healthy... and brilliant.

EDDIE

Luckily I can do that myself.

STEADMAN

Well, no, ah, that won't be the

case. We shut your lab down this

morning.

EDDIE

My lab?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Which one?

(CONTINUED)

115.

CONTINUED: (3)

STEADMAN

All of them.

EDDIE

You sure?

STEADMAN

We were right about you Eddie -

you're gonna go all the way. Let's

not do anything to jeopardize that.

There's no downside here - we're

offering you a limitless supply

with fewer side effects. I think

you'll be pleased with the

arrangement.

(BEAT)

Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm

starving...

EDDIE

Tell me something.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Did I kill that woman?

STEADMAN

Do you really want to know?

STEADMAN

It's not so bad, is it?

(CONTINUED)

116.

CONTINUED:

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

Doesn't every man on the path to

greatness have to tolerate the wind-

drag of compromise?

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

Overall, we'll all be better off...

foreign policy, the courts, even

the Constitution could stand a

little tweaking...

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

Eddie?

EDDIE

After you.

STEADMAN

(CORDIAL)

No, "Senator". You first.

EDDIE

Please.

STEADMAN

All right then...

STEADMAN (CONT'D)

Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.

EDDIE

Don't underestimate your own

creation.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

I mean, you invented it. What does

it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead

of you fucks.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

117.

CONTINUED: (2)

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You think I didn't spend my days on

MDT devising a personal defense

structure that would scare the shit

out of the Israelis--? You think

there's not people with a bead on

you right now, right in this

building? You think this

conversation is private?

STEADMAN

You don't know the caliber of

enemies you'll be making.

EDDIE

You want to push that button? I'll

show you my silos if you show me

yours.

STEADMAN

You'll run out. You'll die.

EDDIE

Or I'll think of something. Isn't

that what MDT does? Makes you

think of something? Might even

tell me how to get off it.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

What if I just ask the drug... how

to tell the drug... how to fuck

itself? I mean, isn't it like the

8-ball?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

It always answers.

THE END
