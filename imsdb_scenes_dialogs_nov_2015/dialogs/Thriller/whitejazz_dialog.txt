WHITE JAZZ

Written by

Matthew Michael Carnahan & Joe Carnahan

9/16/07

Legend: Recife, Brazil, 1983

Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks

occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white

tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch

over what was my left eye.

ME (V.O.)

I'm old. And all I have left is the

will to remember...

I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &

white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below

me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of

Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...and the fear I'll forget...

Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30

years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I killed innocent men. I betrayed

sacred oaths. I reaped profit from

horror. The names are dead or too

guilty to tell. The events so

brutal they beg to be re-told...

Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958

The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab

bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the

`Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.

ME (V.O.)

Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice

Division. LAPD. That's what my face

looked like before.

My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this

bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD

"JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.

2.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Junior Stemmons. A partner I never

asked for. The scowl meant to hide

a shit-scared kid who'd been

teaching evidence classes three

months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD

lifer who never got past Sergeant.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

We should make our move now.

ME

Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you

wanna be at the center of a riot?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I don't wanna be here when Noonan

and the Feds show up.

I point at the bantam Black:

ME

We let Sanderline finish this

beating, we get his gratitude.                          *

Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for

`Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic

smells when I stand this close to it.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-

ME

-relax Junior.

The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double

doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping

jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-

taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:

ME

Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of

the LAPD and a real big fan-

JUNIOR STEMMONS

-you're under arrest.

Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees

the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to

Sanderline again:

3.

ME

No you're not. Reuben is-

REUBEN RUIZ

-Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-

ME

-for being a ranked fighter who

still steals hubcaps. Shut up.

(off Ruiz, back to

Sanderline)

If I was gonna arrest you, I

wouldn't have let you finish: and

that hook-uppercut combo you got is

something special.

(from Reuben, beat)

Reuben's in custody. But you could

be our Guest. Whaddya say?

Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.

Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,

hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:

RING ANNOUNCER

Ladies and Gentleman...due to

circumstances beyond our control,

Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-

-BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.

Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three

exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-

out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.

ME (V.O.)

Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy

League Crimefighter. Launching a

big boxing probe as a way to begin

prying into everything else crooked

and corrupt in LA.

Move faster.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Unaware the LAPD was walking away

with his two big witnesses.

As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a

foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.

4.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!

My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a

Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen

before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the

future. I can't take my eyes away...five seconds-

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

-HE SEES US!

Noonan's gaze strafes us. I see him squint.

ME

Then you can stop pointing at him.

Double-time out the double-doors.

9th floor suite. All four of us. I order room service.

ME

Hungry Sanderline?

Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his

street clothes, reading the Bible.

SANDERLINE JOHNSON

If they got shrimp.

ME

(into the phone)

Shrimp cocktail.

(over to Reuben)

You want something Reuben?

REUBEN RUIZ

To know why the fuck I'm here-

JUNIOR STEMMONS

-mind your tone, Shitbird...

REUBEN RUIZ

Shitbird went out with Vaudeville.

You get your badge in a cereal box?

ME

You're here because we want you to

remember where you live.

5.

SANDERLINE

(grade-school mind)

City of Angels.

ME

Excellent Sanderline.

REUBEN RUIZ

What?

ME

You live in LA, Asshole. You do not

live in `Federal Government.'

JUNIOR STEMMONS

We get to spend time alone now.

REUBEN RUIZ

Want some perfume?

ME

Stop laughing.

ME (CONT'D)

What were you gonna tell Welles

Noonan?

(watch as he flinches)

He has a subpoena with your name on

it, Sanderline. Why would someone

like you need to talk to the U.S.

Attorney?

ME (CONT'D)

You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I

know the Men that pay you for that

will murder you if they hear you're

about to talk to the U.S.-

SANDERLINE JOHNSON

-but they don't know...

6.

ME

(beat, small smile)

And they don't have to. Now tell me

what you were gonna tell Noonan-

SANDERLINE

Bet you they ran outta shrimp.

ME

Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

The Spook with you?

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (CONT'D)

C'mon, we know he is. We're just

trying to be mysterious-

ME

-who's `we?'

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

Me and Sam G.

ME (V.O.)

G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors

for the rest of my life.

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

We're out at the place in Palm

Springs. You should come out for

the weekend.

ME

Tell Sam if I get minute-

UNIDENTIFIED VOICE

-yer gonna have to make a minute

for him. Now. See, we think the

Spade might testify that Sam owns

him and how we was grooming him for

a title shot he was gonna tank. A

fight everybody woulda' got flush

off of, including the Spade.                        *

(beat, quieter)

Have him look out the window Klein.

7.

Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the

window...open it...then I chuckle genuine:

ME

Sanderline, you gotta see this...

Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window:

SANDERLINE JOHNSON

What'm I-

-smash his head against the frame using his forward motion.

He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to

pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask.

Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel

robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead

streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway.

Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside

now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the

door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where

Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...

ME

DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?

Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered.

Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to

me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:

ME (CONT'D)

Remember where you live.

Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself.

Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the

mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a

protest filter through the windows:

MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.)

MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL

DODGERS NO!

Four of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S.

Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD.

ME (V.O.)

LA's version of the Young Turks,

only meaner.

(MORE)

8.

ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives.

Smartest man in town. And one of

the richest: Dad was a Real Estate

Developer who owned a strip of land

that's now known as the Santa

Monica Freeway. On either side,

Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob

Gallaudet, not the smartest man in

town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my

notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune,

running for a City Council seat

that'll decide if this Mexican slum

called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed

and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              *

BRADLEY

Turn it off.

ME

I was pissing. He was jumping.

BRADLEY

`US Attorney Noonan is accusing the

Los Angeles Police Department in

general, and Lt. David Klein in

particular, of murder at worst,

gross incompetence at best...'

ME

Noonan had Sanderline scared. After

he sang to me he panicked & jumped.

TOM BETHUNE

He did spend a month in Camarillo

Mental Hospital last year-

GAS CHAMBER BOB

-and wearing that hotel robe over

his clothes makes him look even

more looney-bin.

TOM BETHUNE

Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So

Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's

got nothing-

BRADLEY

-but time, a mandate and new

targets...I need to speak to the

Lieutenant alone.

9.

BRADLEY (CONT'D)

Describe to me your duty, as you

understood it, regarding Sanderline

Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.

ME

Take both men into custody before

Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   *

out what they were going to tell-

BRADLEY

-and why did I choose you for this?

ME

Because I'm a Cop with a law

degree, and you thought my legal-

BRADLEY

-because your a thug with a law

degree. Because I thought by now

you'd be so indebted to this

Department for not indicting and/or                   *

imprisoning you, that diligent,

honest discharge of duty would be

assured.

(beat)

And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *

ME

Bethune and Gallaudet don't think

so.

BRADLEY

Bob's happy because he wants to be

State Attorney General and his most

likely opponent will be Welles

Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton

Diskant, who's leading their City

Council race, is endorsed by

Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing

the larger play.

(with calculated emphasis)

Noonan's new target will likely be

the LAPD itself.

ME

How do you know that?

10.

BRADLEY

Because that's where I would aim: a

subpoenaed Federal witness plummets

to his death in the company of two

LAPD detectives?

(beat)

This screams Police Corruption.                      *

This offers Noonan the possibility

of payback in the form of national

headlines.

ME

Johnson did that stint at the Nut

House -- leak his file to your

friends at the times-

BRADLEY

My friends would be more interested

in this.

(beat, flipping file open)

Coroner's preliminary: white paint

chips found embedded in Sanderline

Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on

the white window sill. I checked

with the hotel switchboard and

found a call was patched to your

room at about the same time Johnson

flew out of it.

(beat, proclamation:)

It shocks and sickens me that your

allegiance to the Chicago mob would

take precedence over the LAPD.

ME

(fuck drawing this out)

Alright. Where's this going?                         *

(pull my badge, table it)

Gun? Shield? What?

BRADLEY

The appearance of disciplinary

measures taken against you are

mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    *

so your suspension will be recorded

but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *

11.

ME

So if the papers or Noonan come

sniffing around-

BRADLEY

-we can provide adequate proof of

your dismissal.

ME

But you're not dismissing me.

BRADLEY

Just on paper.

(closes the file)

Since I misjudged the Cop I thought

you were, I'm going to leverage the

Cop that you are.

BRADLEY (CONT'D)

Morton Diskant is to be removed

from the City Council race. The

means and methods implemented to

that end I will entrust to you.

ME

(throw a thumb at Bethune)

You want me to torpedo Diskant so

your buddy Bethune can win a City                      *

Council seat uncontested-

BRADLEY

-or spend the next month in lock-up                    *

before being arraigned on charges                      *

of gross misconduct and dereliction                    *

of duty. The preamble before you                       *

face life in prison for murder.                        *

BRADLEY (CONT'D)

Diskant works Saturdays. Late.

12.

Hollywood Hills loom in the distance.

ME (V.O.)

Bradley's stooge now. A smart play

suspending me: a built-in shield                        *

for him if things go sideways.

Traffic teeming up Fairfax, tourettes-like glances in my rear-

view...a Black Buick...maybe mirroring my lane changes.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Black Buick...five Cars

back...feels like a tail...

Brake hard. They hang a left on Fountain.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...or maybe I just need sleep.

Cruising up Nichols Canyon to the pad, cameras and

copywriters loom on my front lawn.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Press camped out post-Sanderline,

looking for quotes to hang me with.                     *

Slouch in the seat, accelerate, keep looking back...dig that

geek from the Hearld pissing in my hedges.

Up the walkway.

ME (V.O.)

Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and

only living family. Mom and Pop

died in `51 when their first plane

ride became their last.

Scoop Meg's LA Herald of the ground. Headlines condemn me.

Tuck it under my arm as Meg opens the door:

MEG

(glances from paper to me)

I already got the Times inside.

13.

Silver tea-pot over blue flame on olive-drab stove. The Times

open on the table between us...Same shitty headlines.

MEG

How much is true?

ME

How many times have I lied to you?

MEG

Zero.

Shrug. Play aloof. Hope it suffices.

ME

You've always liked your Men mean.

She looks up at me. Feels the shame I shun...                    *

ME

What would Mom and Dad say?

ME

Nothing. That's where I learned it.

She stands, goes to the stove.

MEG

Poor you.

ME

Yeah, pour me...a cup please.

Black, no sugar.

Meg stares darts. I smile to defuse.

ME (CONT'D)

Pretty please.

She fetches cups and saucers.

ME (CONT'D)

How's work?                                             *

MEG

It's work.

ME

How's Pete?

14.

MEG

More work.

Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means

creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes

open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years.

I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you

see the Hell I see when sleep wins:

Fire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat,

point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine

fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a

cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       *

the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      *

-awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee

pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has

his hands on my sister's shoulders.

ME (V.O.)

Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA

Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead

a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly

impressed Howard Hughes hired him

on as his full-time muscle. My

Sister's new Hump. My oldest living

Friend.

PETE

(turns back at me)

You look like Death taking a shit.

Meg cackles.

MEG

He's still got that MGM-face.

PETE

You're still the only guy who ever

traded movie-potential for Police

work.

MEG

Because in the movies they make you

pull your punches.

15.

Drain my mug. To Pete:

ME

Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?

MEG

No. We're going to the Cocoanut-

-Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips,

which she bends backwards.

PETE

'Favor' mean `free?'

ME

Means $500 an hour.

MEG

Gimme the phone so I can find

another Date-

ME

-you're the only Woman I know who

calls Men-

MEG

-you're the only Man I know who

doesn't call Women.

Pete laughs, then:                                             *

PETE

What are we doing?

Me and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the

shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody

bored. Glance again at the file in my lap:

ME (V.O.)

Morton Diskant, a man who preferred

migrant workers to million dollar

ballparks. Beating Bethune in their

City Council Race despite getting

outspent 10 to 1.

(beat)

If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a

Stadium, Mexicans get to keep

raising chickens two miles from

City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   *

burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         *

16.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Junior brought along because he

begged. Already hip to how many

ways you can make money with a

badge.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

You got a birthday coming up.

ME

What?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

On the 16th, right? How old?

ME

Old. What are you writing?                          *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Just notes...about work-

ME

-what `work'?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Mostly compare and contrast stuff.

Street work versus textbook-

ME

-chapter 1: don't write shit down.

Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 *

you.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

So you think Noonan will come after

you for the Sanderline thing? He

seems like a real hard charger.

ME

(the deadest deadpan)

I heard he was coming after both of

us.

17.

Feature real concern from Junior.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

What?

ME

Indictments. Prison time. Whole

nine.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Holy Jesus. Is this true?

ME

I'm seriously thinking about

turning Junior...testifying against

you.

Junior goes sour...gets he's being goosed. I laugh, glance

out the windshield: see Diskant finally exiting the office.

ME (CONT'D)

Here we go.

I start the car, slow-roll up the street. My Hamilton says

11:04 PM. Streets deserted. Pete walking in Diskant's

direction now as I continue to roll toward both. Pete close,

dig his giant head nodding `hello.'

ME (V.O.)

Seen Pete do this a dozen times and

every time the same thought:

Pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook: hammers

Diskant from nowhere as they pass. Instant-ugly crumble.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

God help me if he ever hits me like

that.

Pete hoists Diskant by his waist-band, tosses him in the

backseat. I accelerate out, obeying every law.

CUT TO:

PITCH BLACK. Then a series of strobe-flashbulbs: maybe flesh,

maybe two bodies, maybe both hairy/pale. Then groaning, then

flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced.

Lights now. Diskant awake, trying to loosen his jaw.

18.

ME (V.O.)

Junior picked up this Quiff jocking

other Fags in a Men's Room. But

Quiff was a Law Student who wanted

his record kept clean.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

He should suck his dick. Y'know?

Put the icing on it.

PETE

What?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Tell me that wouldn't sell

it...plus he's a Communist.

ME

We're ruining his career, not his

soul. Reload the camera.

MORTON DISKANT

Off me!

ME

Drop out of the City Council race

or I send these pictures to the

papers.

MORTON DISKANT

I'll fight you rotten-

ME

-and maybe salvage something that's

a close cousin to `respect.' But

what about your wife and kid

getting hold of those pictures?

19.

Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.

Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw

punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior:

ME (CONT'D)

Take the Quiff home.

QUIFF

My name's Franklin-

ME

-of course it is.

Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me,

and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour...

ME (CONT'D)

I need a nod from you Morton, let's

me know you get it-

DISKANT

-don't say my name...

PETE

He gets it.

ME

Someone from the Times will call

for a quote. Whatever your reason

for dropping out make it real.

As Pete and I turn to leave:

DISKANT

(not looking at us)

You eventually lose the ability to

reconcile the things you've done to

people. That's Hell.

A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard.

Pete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn

up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his

cut. A $500 roll.

PETE

(pocketing the money)

Y'know Hughes has a job you're

tailor-made for. I already gave him

your-

20.

ME

-no thanks.

PETE

Stop pretending you're not a pig

for all this, Klein.

ME

I still got a day job, Pete-

PETE

-tossing more Bantamweights out                       *

windows?

I wait too long, answer in too high a voice:

ME

The Mutt jumped.

PETE

(laughs small, then:)

Not even the people who don't know

you believe that. If somebody from

the DA's office decides to dig, you

could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in

with a billionaire who's got a

fleet of planes, fly you outta the

country on a moment's notice.

(beat)

C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    *

just wants you to burn some actress

that stopped fucking him.

Stop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running,

jumps out.

PETE (CONT'D)

Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        *

It'll be worth it.

I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A

block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like

they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I

pass...but it just stays put...idling.

Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen

table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets.

A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz.

Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start

another futile fight with sleep.

21.

The last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a

Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle.

SMASH CUT TO:

Artillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled

frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off

the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine.

I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already

ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This

guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize

Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap

awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         *

ME (CONT'D)

Klein-

BRADLEY (O.S.)

-you know who Hector Magdalena is?

ME

(as cobwebs clear)

...yeah...Narco's Snitch.

BRADLEY (O.S.)

He's missing. His home was broken

into at some point within the last

hour.

ME

So send Robbery.

BRADLEY (O.C.)

The only thing taken was him.

Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get

over there right now.

ME

Why me?

BRADLEY

Call it penance.

ME

I thought that's what Morton

Diskant was-

BRADLEY

-that makes one of us. 1284 South                         *

Tremaine.

(MORE)

22.

BRADLEY (cont'd)

(edge to his voice)

This kind of timing makes for

disasters, Lieutenant.

I hear the first split-second of Bradley smashing his phone

down. Click my own cradle. Wipe my face. Dial another number.

ME

Junior. Meet me at 1284 South                         *

Tremaine. 20 minutes.

Police abound. Mostly work-a-day Blues pounding coffee. They

part as I approach: Dave "Enforcer" Klein half-legend here. A

plain-clothes breaks through, aims right at me: DAN WILHITE.

ME (V.O.)

Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the

LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan

Catholic poisoned by 25 years in

this desert. Recently divorced

despite seven kids with his Ex.

WILHITE

Why are you here?

ME

You smell like bourbon Wilhite-

WILHITE

-fuck off. This is handled. And

pull your idiot partner out of

there-

ME

-Junior's already here-

WILHITE

-Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's

my scene.

-push past him, toward the house.

ME

Then get Bradley on the horn, so

you can relay that order. I'm here

on his word. Now, what happened?

WILHITE

(dragged out of him)

Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's

missing.

ME

Alright, you better cut out before                      *

people start asking why the head of

Narco is at a missing persons.

Wilhite gets close, still sneering:

WILHITE

Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and

pin this thing fast or you'll have

a whole division of disgraced cops

at your front door.

ME

What are you talking about Wilhite?

WILHITE

You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe

by killing that boxer   and they

already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   *

Bradley sent you down   here as

damaged goods...think   about it.

Everybody sees what's   coming.

(beat, closer)

Now close this quick.

Wilhite bolts. I pause. Clarity finally dissolving the            *

bloodshot: this is the disaster Bradley was talking about:        *

ME (V.O.)

The God-sized problems I triggered

tossing Sanderline take shape: the

LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher

vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy                       *

spot to stick a new probe.                              *

All money, no taste. In the foyer: a Wilshire Station six-

pack interviews the old BIDDIE in a threadbare bathrobe. Dyed

orange hair and a burnt-butter grin. Leans-lunges as she

relays her story. I zoom in to catch the performance.

BIDDIE

(mid-sentence)

-shifty...colored...y'know Negros

are planning an invasion! After our

white women and our water supply-

OFFICER

-where was this Peeper you saw?

25.

BIDDIE

Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   *

there before! He's a black saboteur                   *

looking for fertile white wombs.

Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    *

ME

Officer.

ME (CONT'D)

Besides bat-shit insanity, is there

anything else about her that rings

true?

OFFICER

Heard an argument, loud, maybe a

minute or two, then silence.

ME

What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?

OFFICER

She saw someone in the bushes

earlier. She's reported that kind

of thing a dozen other times. She's

also reported flying saucers, so...

ME

See if any of the other Neighbors

can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

No one touch a thing `til I say.

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

Dave-

ME

-Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me'

in twenty minutes' not `go in

without me.'

JUNIOR STEMMONS

All I've been doing-

ME

(hard/harsh/low)

-is stepping on dicks. You don't

know the history, the players or

the play.

ME (CONT'D)

The Department gave Magdalena a                      *

monopoly on the LA dope trade

decades ago-

JUNIOR STEMMONS

-what Department?

ME

Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet-

proofed him in exchange for 60% of

his profit and a promise he only

deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

-Black and Mexican-

ME

-give the man a prize. He'd also                     *

rat his competition and kill the

ones we couldn't convict.

Now keep your mouth shut and stay

on my hip.

JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *

Fine.                                                *

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   *

Loaded him into a car-

ME

-are all the Magdalena vehicles

accounted for?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         *

27.

ME

OFFICER.

ME (CONT'D)

The old lady hear dogs barking?                       *

Gunshots?

OFFICER

No, I asked. Just the yelling.

ME

She didn't hear barking...so they

were either lousy guard dogs...or

they knew the Killer.

(point to the wounds)

You can't hit something this clean

unless you're point blank. He

could've been petting them when he

fired: look at the burn pattern-                      *

(point)

Like when you shoot something with

a silencer.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

How do you know that?

ME

(stare so he gets it)

I've shot things with silencers...

And the old lady didn't hear any                      *

gunshots.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

You make a family member for it?

Tommy?

ME

Maybe...                                              *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Do you want to issue an APB?

28.

ME

I want to talk to Bradley first.

Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   *

Feature this old Matriarch hanging by the thinnest thread:     *

MADGE MAGDALENA, fifty-plus, dyed blonde bouffant pulled at

and picked. Sad clown tears smearing too much mascara. She

pitches a boo-hoo in between belts of wine to a bored stiff

Wilshire Station six-pack.

LUCILLE MAGDALENA, 20's: Daughter. Big bedroom eyes. A top

two sizes too tight. Pops a palm of pills. Doesn't look too

shattered about Daddy's demise. I make eye contact. I catch    *

bruises on her arms. She sees me see, tries to cover           *

nonchalant. The wall phone rings. Grab without asking.         *

ME

It's Klein.

BRADLEY (O.S.)

Update.

ME

Hector's gone. Blood that may or

may not be his leads out to the                      *

garage. Two guard dogs shot dead

but no other signs of a struggle.

The house is intact.

BRADLEY

Family?

ME

Wife and Daughter are here.

BRADLEY

Describe their state.

ME

Mother Madge aggrieved.                              *

(aim my gaze at Lucille)

Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The                  *

son is persona non grata and a

strong early suspect.

BRADLEY

Alright, kick everyone out.

Including all police personnel.

29.

ME

How's that?

BRADLEY

Don't question me. Is your partner

on hand?

ME

Yeah...                                               *

BRADLEY

Have him bag and seal everything

and bring it to Wilshire Station.

Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and

take him into custody. No APB's,

nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI

to this situation.

ME

You want me to-

BRADLEY

-no more information over an open                     *

line. I'll be at the Bethune event

later on today. Find me there.

Click. Second time he's hung up on me in an hour. Pull Junior

to me just as he's going through a stack of mail:

ME

I'm giving you on-scene command.                      *

Bradley wants everyone removed from

the premises and the entire house

bagged for evidence and brought to

Wilshire Station.

(more of a dare)

Can you handle this?

Big brown-nose nods from an aim-to-please Junior.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Entirely. Where are you going?

ME

To find Tommy Magdalena.

Rolling up Hollywood to Highland.

KLEIN (V.O.)

Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep.

Buzz dispatch. A message from Pete.

`Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.                      *

Glance street-side: Sanderline smiling blood in a wind blown

bathrobe. Blink and he's gone, replaced by a kid hawking the

Times.

Pull-over. Toss the kid a coin. Front page: LEADING CANDIDATE

BOWS FROM CITY COUNCIL RACE, next to a picture of Diskant.

Pissed for reasons I won't name. Back to the Car. A Black

Buick passes, slower than the rest of traffic, act like I'm

oblivious. It turns. I slide in, start my Pontiac.

ME (V.O.)

Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed                     *

Tail. Noonan already up my ass.                        *

Let's see if they got guts enough

to keep following me South.

Cruising the Crenshaw district, up through Central Ave.

ME (V.O.)

Dispatch gave me Tommy's make and

model: A `32 Ford Deuce with a bent

eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to

goose the cops into giving chase.

Check my mirrors. That Black Buick hangs way back. Cruise

past jazz clubs: The Savoy, Joe Morris's Plantation, Shepp's

Playhouse, the Down Beat...no sign of a Ford Deuce. Pull up

to the Club Alabam. Valets stare: a white man in Watts at

this hour can only be Cop. Park.                                 *

Half-a-block back: buzzcuts in that black Buick.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces                       *

glow like Martians this far down

Crenshaw.

Smile big, give `em a thumbs-up.

Barely sober patrons sport Cop-hate stares, some on reflex,      *

some because of Sanderline Johnson.                              *

Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I

Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.

ME

Shit. He's wise.

LESTER LAKE

To what? You looking for him?

ME

Just never got this...

LESTER LAKE

Too white to appreciate good grass.                   *

Hector Magdalena is missing,

presumed dead. Tommy is our sole

suspect.

LESTER LAKE

Muthafucker -- there is a God.

If only I'd known this an hour ago.

ME

Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig

here last night?

LESTER LAKE

I don't let him, he just does.

Nails on a chalkboard too. He

rushed the stage last week when we

had Charlie Mingus drop in for a

set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   *

LESTER LAKE

Drugs. Especially here in South

Central. Hector ran it uncontested.

ME

Tommy can't hold the throne?                          *

LESTER LAKE

Tommy couldn't hold his pecker

without Hector's help and he knows                    *

that. He's gonna bury himself like                    *

Bethune Campaign Fundraiser turned Victory Bash. Big smiles

beam above sunburned double-chins. Bethune the nucleus of a

Press circle-jerk. I weave around, lack of sleep and a

miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up.

REPORTER #1

Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant

dropping out the only way you could

have won this race?

TOM BETHUNE

Not at all. My message of civic

advancement manifested in that

beautiful blue baseball team was

US Spymaster, current Head of the                       *

LAPD's Intelligence Division. He                        *

own Cold War -- each fighting to be

I wouldn't have expected so public

a showing after Sanderline Johnson.

ME

He jumped Fritz.

KOENIG

I'm sure he did. And where is your

young partner this day?

ME

Working his first big job.

KOENIG

Might the job involve the LAPD's

most important missing Wetback,

Hector Magdalena?

ME

It does.

KOENIG

I've known Stemmons since the

academy. He was a top pupil. A                *

peculiar little pain in the ass,

but very good with details.

37.

ME

Kid might have some climb in him.

(look back at Bradley)

Reminds me of another pain in the

ass.

KOENIG

I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley

would assign you to the Magdalena                     *

case when you're neither Homicide

nor Robbery...

ME

There's no body, and nothing was

taken except Hector.

KOENIG

He does know how to delegate

doesn't he...and also I'm sure that

poor Negro's nosedive has put you

squarely in his debt.

ME

Something like that.                                  *

KOENIG

Keep me abreast will you? Chief

Parker is understandably nervous.

Situations like these tend to yield

No.

I can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through

out if that's real. The tails and

the stakeout start tonight.

(beat)

Can you manage this?

Junior jacks his chin just high enough to save face, tucks

that steno away, this X-Ray stare.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Sure, Lieutenant.                                       *

ME

Shit.

Cruise in, crossing the hangar to Pete.

ME (V.O.)

Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ

freak. Boob man. Pete's prime

benefactor. Nobody had seen him in

years.

(MORE)

43.

ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

Now he only communicated through a

small standing army of lapdog

lawyers he kept on staff.

MILTEER

Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A

pleasure Lt. Klein.

ME

Dave. Sorry I'm late.                                  *

MILTEER

Indeed.

(motions to sit)

Please.

MILTEER (CONT'D)

Thanks for your time on a Sunday.

ME

(a wink for Pete)

Where's Mr. Hughes?

MILTEER

Unavailable. Unfortunately. But

I've been given full authority to-

ME

-I'm not contagious...if that's

what he's worried about.

MILTEER

I don't find that the least bit

humorous Lt. Klein.

ME

Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      *

Milteer?

44.

MILTEER

An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe

signed a Service Contract that

she's now willfully violating by

acting in a Z-grade horror picture

presently `shooting' in Griffith

Park. Despite entreaties for her to

cease participation in this

absurdity, she continues to revel

in her outlaw status with us. Thus

we would like her destroyed.

ME

What makes you think I can do a

better job than your people?

MILTEER

Mr. Bondurant says you're one of

the smarter people he knows-

ME

-dubious honor if you knew the

other people Pete knows.

(beat)

So you want to catch her in

violation of her Service Contract?

Something like that?

MILTEER

Exactly. The morality clause in

particular as the damage to her

reputation would be most

devastating: Nymphomaniac,

Criminal, Communist...anything

along these lines. Once you visit

the set of her `Attack of the

Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the

void that is her character. We

haven't a photograph handy, but

she's playing the lead female role.         *

ME

I'm happy to help. But my price is

$10,000. Not 5.

MILTEER

$10,000 should buy more than help.

45.

ME

For 10 give it any name you want.

I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      *

that means I'll have to find time

off hours to do this.

A long, cold moment drags...                                    *

MILTEER

Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      *

been stealing groceries from our

talent domiciles. There's no proof

that it's her, but it's her. Peter

will provide you addresses.

ME

(faux fey)

Thank you Peter.

MILTEER

We look forward to your updates.

Dialing the Station:

ME

Sergeant, pass a message to

Stemmons: I want him to meet me at

the one-thousand block of South

Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some

point between now and then, I'll

need him to do a preliminary work-

up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe.

(beat, check spelling)

B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks.

I hang up, step out, yawn.

Two-fisting coffees. On top of a hill overlooking the `Atomic

Vampires' shoot. Pure schlock. The spaceship: a totaled

Cadillac replete with home-made canopy and cardboard

extensions on the fins. Crew: homeless winos. Extras:

homeless drug-fiends. Scan the assembled `talent'...and see:

HER. My black and white picture. The Beauty at the fight. The

starlet I threw a Hail Mary dinner pass to at Bethune's

victory party: GLENDA BLEDSOE. Emerging from a small trailer.

46.

ME (V.O.)

Twice in a day doesn't happen. Not

in a city like LA. Not like this.

(beat)

This is fate. This is Cupid firing

his whole fucking quiver. Move.

Make sure she's real.

HER laughing. Melodic. I hike down through the bramble.

Walk past a pair of beat Airstream Clippers. Watch her

propping up this silver-haired junkie. She grabs a sound

blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down

next to another Woman and rehearsing.

I eyeball the rest of the `set.' Winos in werewolf masks and

capes, holding wooden ray-guns spray-painted silver: One

pisses, bottle in one hand, cigarette/dick in the other.

The "Director" is a fey manic, fingering a snuff-box.

DIRECTOR

This is the big Armada landing, so

I need everybody's energy up, up

up! Where's my Alien Commander?

The Pissing WEREWOLF careens back to set, pulling at his

zipper, mask askew, covering his eyes.

WEREWOLF

RIGHT HERE GOD DAMN IT.

MICKEY COHEN, 62, former mob boss. He boils eggs on a hot-

plate and slings hash to extras lining plywood picnic tables.

ME (V.O.)

Mickey Cohen: one-time LA crime

kingpin and West Coast Mob heavy

who now trawls for loose change.

Winos vibe LAPD, make a hole as I approach:

ME (CONT'D)

Cecil B. Demoted.

MICKEY COHEN

Where Klein goes tsuris follows.

This is what I hate about being

down, lip from the likes of you.

47.

ME

If this is `down' I never want to

see `out.' How the mighty have

fallen.

MICKEY COHEN

(gives it right back)

Which one of us are you talking

about Klein? Word is the Federal

Bureau is all hot and bothered with

you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar

schtups his personal assistant and

makes him wear ladies hose.

ME

What else are you hearing?

MICKEY COHEN

That this Welles Noonan character

has developed quite a crush. That

you might want to consider

relocating to Dogdick, Delaware.

ME

Been a marked man for years Mick.

MICKEY COHEN

But the bullseye on your back's

never been quite so big...if you

need a new line of work, I got this

faygele leading man needs replacing-

MICKEY COHEN

His agent told me he could play

straight.

ME                                          *

His agent lied.                                       *

MICKEY COHEN                                *

You interested?                                       *

ME

No. But I am interested in your                       *

leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    *

her at the Bethune-

48.

MICKEY COHEN

-not a chance. I'm still trying to

play hide the submarine.

ME

You want Chief Bradley angry?

MICKEY COHEN

Ten years ago I could call for that                   *

little Pisher's head on a stick.

(looks around)

And now...

ME

And now the only thing you're

putting on sticks are corn dogs.

What's her name, Mick?

MICKEY COHEN

Glenda.

ME

(still looking for HER)                           *

Why was she there?

MICKEY COHEN

Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda

and Rock to any event where there's

cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'-

honor treatment everywhere with

that shape a' her's...

ME

What she drive?

Following the tail-lights of a 56 Corvette. Top-down,

whipping Blond hair split-second visible under passing street

lights. Glenda pulls into what I guess is her place: tiny-

tidy Glendale flat. I roll past: no eye contact.

Around the block. Park on the next street over. Waiting until

I think of what comes next...get out now...

Up to a fence. Scratch it: make sure a nuts-hungry Pooch

isn't slobbering on the other side. Nothing. Vault the fence.

Dodge a pool. Over another fence and into-

49.

-creep to a window: curtains pulled. Creep to another: there

she is. Watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only

now beginning to betray age. Watch her shake her sandals off.

Arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming.

On cue: another car. A `53 Cadillac: the Director and Rock

Rockwell. I crane my neck to get as much of her as I can. She

leaves the tray, cups steaming. Muffled greetings. Check the

window, open. Slide it up gentle.

Glenda clearing seats.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go

over this quick because I'm beat.

DIRECTOR

We're set on a place where we can

stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga

Canyon, two weeks-

ROCKWELL

(petulant)

-two weeks? My body'll fall apart-

GLENDA BLEDSOE

-think of it as 14 days of push-ups-

(to the Director)

Are you sure about this Sid? Seems

shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?

DIRECTOR

And I think it's brilliant!

Inspired! The two leads of Mickey

Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped!

The press'll eat it up! They'll

write about `Gangster Mickey,' the

glory days. Couple a' headlines

like that and interest in Atomic

Vampires will go through the roof!

(to Glenda)

Who's gonna grab you?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

A charmer I knew in another

life...George Ainge.

50.

Pat myself down for a pen, scribble on my hand: "A-I-N-G-E"

SID FRIZELL

Is he okay with making it look real-

ROCKWELL

-he can't hit me in the face!                         *

That's a deal-breaker!

GLENDA BLEDSOE

He'll be thrilled to knock me

around. Plus he's holding something

of mine, so we can kill two birds.

He'll grab us Tuesday in front of

the Pacific Dining Car.                               *

ROCKWELL

What about Hughes?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

What about him? That angle can only

help us.

SID FRIZELL

I'm dying to know...was he the

Spruce Goose between the sheets?

My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown. I reach in, steal one   *

of the steaming cups, bolt. Audible as I retreat:

GLENDA BLEDSOE (O.C.)

Hung like a newborn and he called

my tits `propellers.'

Belly laughter from inside.

ME (V.O.)

The real howler: fake kidnappings

always bomb.

Parked. Tepid pulls off the stolen mug. Done. Toss it to the    *

passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam. Look

up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down. Glance at

the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills.

The name: BLEDSOE written across the front. Pick it up.

51.

ME (V.O.)

Thinking I could tip Milteer off to

the kidnap plot and pick up the

other half of my payment...

(stare at that money)

Thinking I should just give the

first half back now...'cuz I know

right now I'll never hurt her.

Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut. Scan. Two

heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered. Cursory

nods as they pass. Tail-lights fade. Dead quiet save my low

Jazz. Fighting my drift. Check my Hamilton. 10:00. Grimace.       *

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

No sense of time. Exhaustion steals

it. A full hour earlier than I told                     *

Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        *

Yawn. Look up...Lucille Magdalena at her window. Sudden.          *

Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples

touch/steam glass. Pushes the curtains back even further.

Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now.

I see her eyes aren't sex-placid or rolled back -- they're

scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back.      *

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *

This routine had been done before.

That old broad babbling about a

Peeper. The only other link to

Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *

She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex-

placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was

looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her. I look to where

I saw her gaze kink...unholster my .45. Get out quiet.

Cold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg.

Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet

steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...

Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm

shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my

head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       *

blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:

ME

STOP-

52.

WELLES NOONAN

That's for Sanderline Johnson.

ME

(nod at the Peeper trail)

ARE YOU BLIND-

WELLES NOONAN

-what were you firing at?

ME

The only lead on Magdalena -- we're

after the same guy you idiot!

WELLES NOONAN

(to one of the goons)

-write that name down: `Magda-LEE-

na' or `Magda-LAY-na.'

(back to me)

No, we were after you. But thanks

for the name.

53.

ME (V.O.)

Assumed the Feds were smart.

Assumed they were ready to stick a

new probe into the LAPD's deal with

Hector, like Bradley warned, like

everyone feared. But they had no                        *

clue and I just handed them the

whole God damn thing.

(beat)

Like I said: I need sleep...

Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out.

ME (CONT'D)

First punch you ever thrown Noonan?

Your Mom have to teach you how

because Dad was the same no-chin,

Connecticut Faggot you are?

Noonan stops, turns back to me: blazing.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I think I hit the Noonan family

dynamic, dead-on.

He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           *

darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn.

FLUTTERING BLACK:

WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)

Drop him.

DERBY #1 (O.C.)

You don't want to take him in?

WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)

I only want to bring him in when I

know he'll never leave.

BLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then:

Horizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one

side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking

down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He

slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A

balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped.

Gaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig

walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy.

54.

ME

Coffee?

KOENIG

Ice. Bradley's on his way down.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

That's mine...you needed some                        *

mopping up.

ME

Who found me?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I did. I got there at eleven like

you said, right as two black &

white's pulled up: you were out                      *

cold in a gutter `round the block.                   *

(this blithe little grin)

Did Noonan knock you out?

ME

He hit me with his car first.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

(a nod to Koenig)

The Captain was the only one here

at this hour...                                      *

KLEIN

If I need your help later on, can I

count on it?

KOENIG

Of course you can.

KOENIG (CONT'D)

Chief.

BRADLEY

What are you doing here?

KOENIG

The Lieutenant was thirsty.

55.

BRADLEY

Progress on Magdalena.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

No fingerprints. Clean crime scene.

Canvassed the neighborhood. A

senile neighbor did report a

possible Peeper-

ME

-confirmed Peeper.

BRADLEY

Is that who knocked you out?

ME

Noonan knocked me out.

BRADLEY

(beat)

He's having you tailed then...

ME

And he knows the Magdalena name and

that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    *

Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

She knows someone watches?

ME

And who he is. She has to.

(back to Bradley)

I want access to her juvie sheet or                    *

whatever arrest records exist.                         *

Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     *

dealers he did business with.                          *

BRADLEY

That's immaterial.                                     *

ME                                          *

(as my teeth grit)                                 *

It is if you're eliminating her as                     *

a suspect-                                             *

56.

BRADLEY                                    *

-did you confirm their alibi?                        *

JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *

I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  *

Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   *

of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      *

they've confirmed their visit and                    *

also corroborated the argument that                  *

resulted in them leaving early.                      *

BRADLEY                                    *

(back to me now)                                 *

One alteration to my previous

orders-

ME                                         *

-previous orders being what? Assign

the Cop Noonan blames for his dead

boxing probe to the case that's

becoming his new crusade?                            *

BRADLEY                                    *

Step out Stemmons.                                   *

BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           *

No direct approach on the mother or                  *

the daughter.                                        *

ME

No. Madge was a battered wife and                    *

Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     *

that's not motive, what is? You                      *

want answers then we brace those                     *

two hard.

BRADLEY                                    *

If you do so directly, if they're                    *

formally questioned then Noonan may                  *

find out and go after them with

Federal warrants.

57.

ME

Noonan will figure out who and what

Hector was sooner or later.                     *

BRADLEY                               *

Yes he will, so we buy time, keep

him busy-

ME

-until when?

BRADLEY

Until Tom Bethune votes on the

floor of the city council in two

days, ratifying the official start

of construction on Dodger stadium-

ME

-this is bigger than a fucking

ballpark! Hector Magdalena and

Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              *

whole Department to hell.                       *

BRADLEY

Don't be dramatic, it looks weak.

Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit,

so I supply him with one-                       *

ME

-me. You want me to draw him off-               *

BRADLEY

-you've been drawing him off. And

the more he sees you the less he'll

think of anything other than

getting you. Now find Tommy and                 *

take him alive. Do not let Noonan               *

get to him. As a potential major                *

case witness against the LAPD,                  *

Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            *

keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *

ME (V.O.)

Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm

getting close to it...I just

haven't hit home. Yet.                          *

58.

In a clean T-shirt from my locker. Heading toward Junior's

desk. All eyes on my wounds. I toss Stemmons his shirt.

ME

Seltzer will take the blood out.

Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up:

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I give you the shirt off my back                        *

and you bash me!                                        *

ME

When a Superior Officer tells you

to leave the room, you leave the                        *

fucking room.                                           *

Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     *

deep breath.                                                      *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I made a file on the Bledsoe broad.

The one you asked about.

ME

Thanks. But forget it.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I spent a whole day putting it

together and this skirt's got

skeletons.

Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink.

Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries:

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17.

Prostitution arrest at 21. Known

associate of a Kern County homicide

victim, this convicted pimp named

Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp.

Stabbed to death in his home,

weapon never recovered-

ME

Forget it. Burn it, s'not important

now.

Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed.

Glenda priors scream back instant conviction.

59.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Why is it not important?

Plant the file in his chest as my answer.

ME

I need an address on a guy named

Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *

JUNIOR STEMMONS

-what about Magdalena?

My temper turning threadbare.

ME

-after you get the Ainge address,                       *

get back to the Magda-

JUNIOR STEMMONS

(picks up Glenda's file)

-is Ainge related to this Cunt?

Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce.

ME

We're partners in name only. You

want to stay in the room next time,

Junior? Do something to impress me:

like finding that address.

Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog

glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face.

Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black

Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        *

ME (V.O.)

Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        *

Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        *

But I could still spot the tail.                        *

Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            *

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This jet-engine urge to see her.

Needing it like a junkie does. No

logic. Just the push.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Better looking than the last guy

Howard hired. Once you heal.

(she recognizes me)

Wait a minute. You were there, the

other night, the Bethune Party...                     *

ME

Yeah.                                                 *

GLENDA

Mickey told me this `Bent Cop'

everybody used to call-

(mocking, I love it:)

-`The Enforcer' was asking about

me. Told me to be careful. So

you're LAPD after all...

ME

In theory.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

You're going to arrest me for

breaking and entering?

ME

Depends.

(nod to groceries)

Those Howard's?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Everything's Howard's.

ME

Except you.

61.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

That's why I left.

ME

You just shop here now?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Some of our extras haven't had a

vegetable since Truman.

ME

Attack of the Atomic Vampires...

GLENDA BLEDSOE

(smiles, no flinch)

We can't all be Audrey Hepburn.

Plus it pays bills.

ME

Better than a billionaire does?

Go make amends and finish out your

service contract Ms. Bledsoe.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Not if there was just one day left

on it.

ME

Why?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

I'm better than that.

ME

You're also better than a starring

role in schlock horror flick

that'll never see a screen,

regardless if it's leading lady

gets `kidnapped' or not.                              *

GLENDA BLEDSOE

This isn't the first time you've

spied on me.

ME

Nor the second.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

(beat)

Well you've got me all giftwrapped,

Enforcer-

ME

-Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side

Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright

place to be. So please go-

GLENDA BLEDSOE

-Glenda.

(this smile just for me)

And tell Howard I'll take my

chances with the fake vampires.

And she twirls off, gone...watch her go...my radio buzzes.

DISPATCH

Message from a Lester Lake: asked

that you contact him immediately.

Ignition. Gas. Tires catch smoke as I peel away.

Out of dimes, drop slugs instead. Three rings, somebody snags

it before the fourth. Background reverb blares, bar racket.

Hear a muted male growl `Club Alabam...'

ME

Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant

Klein, LAPD-

-click. Fuck. Fish for another slug. Redial. One ring. Picked

up, same background din-

ME (CONT'D)

(push this out pronto)

-this is LAPD-put Lester on the

phone or I'll have your liquor

license and after-hours permits

yanked inside the hour...

A muffled back and forth before Lester comes on the line:

LESTER LAKE

Dave?

63.

ME

Got your message.

LESTER LAKE

Girl that works here, gigs the late

sets, the torch stuff Fridays and                 *

Saturdays, name of Tilly Hopwell.                 *

ME

I saw her singing the other night.

LESTER LAKE

I think she's been truckin' with

Tommy Mag. Got pipes like Ella but

she's a junk fiend: caught her                    *

mainlining in the ladies room a

month back.                                       *

ME

Heroin? Tommy get her hooked?

LESTER LAKE

Dunno, but when he'd get drunk,                   *

he'd trade Horse for blowjobs out                 *

back a' the club.                                 *

ME

Where's this girl now?                            *

LESTER LAKE

Didn't show up for work last night.               *

Called a friend of hers, a waitress

that works here too, said she was                 *

at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 *

she was `hiding out.'

ME

She actually said `hiding out?'                   *

LESTER LAKE

Then she got off the phone. Fast.

If Tilly's running with that demon,               *

you gotta get her out of there. She               *

got a lot more good in her than not-              *

64.

Driving.

ME (V.O.)

Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown

altogether. Holed up in Hollywood.

Hiding in plain sight.

Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the

way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table

in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     *

Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 *

Stare at that photo of Tommy.

ME (V.O.)

Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a

face out front if I get lucky. Wait

till Bido Lito's gets busy before I

make my move.

Snub my last Chesterfield, stifle a yawn, check my Hamilton.

9:20 PM. Bito Crowd bops out front. Valet ballet.               *

Scanning...spot a face...pull my mugshots...Steve Wenzel,       *

Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the

crush out in front of the club, hits the side alley.

I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door.

Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as

Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper

into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear.

Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools

at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under

a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       *

ME (V.O.)                                  *

Tommy's Deuce.                                       *

Pull the pig-sticker off my ankle, stab the Driver-side tire.   *

65.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *

Now he's on foot.                                       *

Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through

the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below.

Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws.

George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird!

Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward

the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         *

nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren,

dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie

scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes.

Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female.

Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right

foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to

gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes,

zips up, steps over the two legs.

Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade

wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room.

Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest,

blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is

there. Turn the corner:

Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.

A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her

right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up

at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks

on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope.

I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes

the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back

sudden tears.

VOICE BEHIND ME

FUCK YOU DOIN'?

Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits

the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him

in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade

before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     *

Jump-shock from the other room.                                   *

66.

ME                                            *

POLICE!                                                 *

Bodies scramble. No words. Just Pistol fire through the half-     *

rotted walls -- punks taking potshots. No compliance means I      *

hit the hallway shooting back. Firing dead-bang at a couple       *

fleeing silhouettes -- see them pop-stumble-fall-                 *

-the archway above my head shreds, collapses. Somebody firing

a sub-machine gun. Flat on my ass, my back finds the wall,        *

cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. Then quiet, save the     *

rattle-clap of changing clips.                                    *

ME                                            *

PUT THAT GOD DAMN GUN DOW-                              *

TOMMY MAGDALENA (O.C.)

-YOU SET ME UP YOU COCKSUCKER!

Machine-gun fire lights up my left side. Roll. Taste floor        *

grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.       *

TOMMY MAGDALENA

-RAT FUCK COP! YOU KILLED HIM                           *

WILHITE!

Every part of me pauses...`Wilhite'...back door gets blunted

open, frantic footfalls recede. That big bent V-8 on Tommy's

`32 Deuce roars to life. Up now, plow through the cloud of

cordite. See one of Tommy's Pachucos propped up against the       *

wall, unhit, unhurt. Point my .45 and pull the trigger a I        *

pass. Hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day.

Out the door reloading as the `32 Deuce barrels away. Tommy

fires shots into the air to clear traffic. Wenzel in the          *

passenger seat, screams to do the same. The Driver's side rim     *

sparks fireworks.                                                 *

Pandemonium out in front of Bido Lito's as the crowd

stampedes ass-over-elbows. Sprint to my car, inside, key          *

dispatch fast as I wheel rough off the curb:                      *

ME

Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar.                        *

Suspect fleeing scene in red `32                        *

Ford Deuce travelling westbound on                      *

Wilcox, vehicle impaired, intercept                     *

at Hollywood Blvd-

67.

-horns blare as I slalom club-goers scrambling across Ivar.

Punch it over-top Sunset, parallel to the Deuce. Rip a left       *

on Selma. Stay on my radio:

ME

-and I need an ambulance to respond

to 1607 North Ivar, second floor,

female negro, possible overdose.

Up ahead I catch a fireworks show: the Deuce gouges pavement      *

across the 4-way. Clip 90 MPH catching up. Squeal onto Wilcox     *

as Tommy hooks a right onto Hollywood.                            *

Two prowlers pass the next second, sirens lit, full scream.       *

Haul ass up to Hollywood, round it: See Tommy and Wenzel

sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease

Guns' into the approaching prowlers. Both cars go helter-

skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          *

crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire.

Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel

stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          *

prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      *

at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     *

he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple

bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints.

Tommy wide-eyes the heap that was Wenzel. Kick my driver's        *

side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *

sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz

by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end

of the mangled `Deuce.'

Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *

in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *

down fire on Tommy. Tommy running now -- I'm up on one knee,      *

aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h-     *

-that Gray Packard materializes across the intersection in

front of Tommy: shotgun blasts from the driver's side             *

backseat obliterates Tommy's mid-section.                         *

My mouth gapes at what just happened...then I remember to         *

fire at the Packard as it continues down the street, running      *

lights extinguished, no plates visible.

Get to Tommy. Crying. Fading. Roll him on his back.               *

68.

ME (CONT'D)                                 *

Where's your father!? Did Wilhite                     *

kill him!?- TELL ME!

-bubbling blood in place of words. Mouth moves like a           *

grouper's...get close...his last gasp...pray it's profound.     *

He breathes out...nothing.                                      *

Driving. Pissed. Radiator steam from under my crunched hood.    *

ME (V.O.)                                   *

That Gray Packard: not the Feds.                      *

Make them Magdalena rivals. I left                    *

Bido Lito's too fast to catch a                       *

tail. So where did they come from?                    *

Magdalena home. Pull up onto the front lawn. Grab my brass      *

knucks from the glove box. Out of my car. Growling. A pair of   *

Narco brims, Wilhite's boys, break wide on my approach.         *

Junior stumbles from the stakeout car, rushing up the street

toward me.

Nothing from her. Music upstairs. Climb the steps two at a      *

deals?                                                *

WILHITE

I have no fucking idea what you're-

ME

-he ever offer her to you?                            *

WILHITE                                     *

I'm married!                                          *

ME                                          *

And about to be divorced. Have you                    *

ever fucked Lucille?                                  *

72.

ME

I don't care where you get your                         *

dick wet Wilhite. I care that                           *

you're covering. Twenty years dirty                     *

with this fucked-up family...your                       *

secrets must stink like rot.                            *

Red and blue light strobe from outside. Look: an unmarked         *

caravan arrives. Bradley leading the charge, leaping from his     *

sedan. Wilhite gets a split-second's worth of gloat/glee.         *

WILHITE                                       *

You're worried about every wrong                        *

thing Klein. Bradley's tee'ing you                      *

up to take a big fat fall-                              *

ME                                            *

-then we'll hold hands on the way                       *

down: look further up the street.                       *

(directing his gaze)                                *

The Black Buick.                                        *

Wilhite focuses, sees the Feds inside, snapping pictures of       *

the Magdalena home...                                             *

ME (CONT'D)                                   *

Feds. They're all over this. You                        *

think I'm the only one that burns?                      *

Two decades worth of twisted shit                       *

between your division and the                           *

biggest dope dealer in LA?                              *

Wilhite wide-eyed. Slouching/sinking down onto the toilet.        *

Somebody beating on the bathroom door hard. Bradley's voice       *

behind it.                                                        *

ME (CONT'D)                                   *

I know I'm going down Dan...that's                      *

the difference between you and me.                      *

Open the door.                                                    *

Shoulder past, start down the stairs. Bradley follows.            *

BRADLEY                                       *

Klein!                                                  *

Hit the front door, moving toward my car, Junior and the          *

Narco brims cagey, primed for another atomic outburst.            *

73.

BRADLEY (CONT'D)                             *

I said `no direct approach!'                           *

ME                                           *

(my back still turned)                             *

Then what are you doing here?                          *

BRADLEY                                      *

You were instructed to take Tommy                      *

Magdalena alive. Do I have to                          *

remind you of the coroner's file-                      *

ME                                           *

(turn on him, fierce)                              *

-enough of your `Sanderline'                           *

bullshit.                                              *

(nod to the Black Buick)                           *

I'll checkmate with an admission of                    *

guilt to Noonan himself.                               *

BRADLEY                                      *

(sharp, shrill)                                    *

Keep your voice down!                                  *

ME                                           *

I'll bargain immunity in exchange                      *

for testimony on how the LAPD                          *

really runs: Magdalena dope profit                     *

kickbacks, Diskant run out of the                      *

city council race on your word,                        *

suspended cops pulling shakedowns.                     *

I'll give Noonan a dozen new probes                    *

for the one I killed.                                  *

BRADLEY                                      *

I'm assuming command of this                           *

investigation myself.                                  *

ME                                           *

What investigation? Tommy's murder?                    *

Hector's disappearance? What are                       *

you investigating?                                     *

BRADLEY                                      *

You're on one month's unpaid leave                     *

as of this moment.                                     *

74.

ME                                         *

You're scamming something big.                       *

BRADLEY                                    *

-if you make any further inquiries                   *

into this case I'll strip you of                     *

rank, have your pension revoked and                  *

walk that coroner's file into the                    *

Times myself...stay away from this.                  *

See red. Launch. Try to wrap my hands around his throat.       *

Watch him feather back just out of reach. Junior and a pair    *

of six-packs restrain me.                                      *

ME                                         *

What's your fucking angle Bradley!?                  *

His eyes beam back doom.                                       *

BRADLEY                                    *

You're done Klein. Soon.                             *

Reach the car, slide in, anger in aftershocks rattle across    *

still balled fists. Junior at my window blathering white       *

noise. He might as well be speaking Greek.                     *

JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *

Dave listen: don't do anything else                  *

to jeopardize yourself...I can                       *

protect you...I've been putting                      *

some things together-                                *

Rip my radio, punch the call button.

KLEIN

Central, this is Klein, I need an

update on that overdose I called

in. What's the girl's condition?

Static. Wait. Anger make my eyes ache, fuzz my focus.

DISPATCH

Lieutenant Klein, the girl, Tilda

Hopwell was pronounced D.O.A. at

Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital-

Rage flares, slam the radio into the dash console, crushing

it- fists flex, blood seeps from a battered knuckle, look at   *

my hands: blood drool over the faint remains of the pen-       *

scrawled `A I N G E'...Glare up at Junior:                     *

75.

ME                                            *

(God-like import)                                   *

George Ainge's address.                                 *

Up the walk, Junior tailing, feel his stare.                      *

JUNIOR STEMMONS                               *

You're in no state to conduct

yourself as a Police Offic-

ME                                            *

-shut up. Don't identify yourself,                      *

don't badge him, don't talk.                            *

BLACK. Then a light turns on somewhere: my gun in a round         *

man's face just through his front door. GEORGE AINGE.             *

Tough Ainge: He doesn't flinch. Drops his lunch-pail slow.        *

Takes off his jacket: jail-house tattoos abound. He sits.         *

ME                                            *

How do you know Glenda Bledsoe?                         *

Junior's `betrayed' look: this guy is tied to that Cooze.         *

GEORGE AINGE                                  *

Knew that whore'd try to muscle me-                     *

ME                                            *

-don't call her a whore again.                          *

Laughs in my face:                                                *

GEORGE AINGE                                  *

If you gave her as many paychecks                       *

as me, you'd know `whore' fits                          *

like a fuckin glov-                                     *

-I grab a chair cushion, put the .45 against it, fire a           *

muffled round that blows Ainge's hair back as it passes.          *

Junior twitches hard enough to spot himself. Ainge jabbers:       *

GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                         *

She fucked for a fee! Jesus Christ                      *

she's a pro! What is she paying to                      *

get that blade back-                                    *

76.

ME                                           *

What? What `blade?'                                    *

GEORGE AINGE                                *

What's she paying you to recover                       *

her knife?

JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *

GEORGE AINGE                                 *

Guess who she asked to hold the                        *

knife? Guess why she brought me in                     *

Swing it into a wall. Gaping holes in holster. Bring it back

like Babe Ruth over his head.

ME (CONT'D)                                  *

-that blade or your life.                              *

Door bashed open behind me -- deadbolt assembly pops, pieces     *

hit me -- then something big/black-metallic ends my night:       *

Junior, tear-streaked cheeks, Ainge's mailbox in-hand, pulled    *

free from the stucco. I drop. Ainge turns cheerleader:           *

GEORGE AINGE                                 *

NICE!                                                  *

Roll to my knees: guttural groans I can't place   because        *

they're mine. Junior rips a radio cord from the   wall, wraps    *

it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his   tears hit my   *

shoulders. Veins in his arms go Pop. Eyes in my   head go Pop.   *

JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *

Last time you push me out a door!                      *

For a dirty split-tail! You're-                        *

(cinches hard)

-not dragging me down! If Bradley

doesn't get you, Noonan will! And-

(through gritted-teeth)                            *

-you're gonna burn all by yourself!

-go black. Then eyes open...out for hours/days/months...what?    *

Feel. Hangman's bruise forming around my neck. Junior and        *

Ainge gone. Floorboards under Ainge's bed pried-up. Crawl to     *

the hole: a hiding spot, empty of whatever was in it.            *

ME (V.O.)                                    *

Call it: the knife was here. Ainge                     *

He currying favor with Chief Parker

KOENIG

Parker appreciates Bradley's

political skills...and the addition

of a professional Ball-club to our

fare city fulfills his own personal

mandate of a cleaner, brighter, LA.

ME

Sounds boring.

Stale milk to me too. And how are

Up the front walk, lean on the doorbell. She answers, Silk        *

Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a

sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No

answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.

Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before

he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the

pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope

and reading what's inside...then rereading it.

Gauge his reaction: ruined.

He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to

protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.

Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly

walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.

Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach

it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind

the curtains: Gunshot. I know what it is. Hit the door.

Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet

of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,

half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.

Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up

the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope. The first word I

see: SUBPOENA.

ME (V.O.)

My first thought, pure panic:

Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena

connection.

87.

Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's.

This subpoena has been issued and signed by LA District

Attorney Bob Gallaudet. Flip it back over, wide-eyed:

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena.

Wilhite was being called to testify

by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't

piss without Bradley's say-so.

(beat)

Bradley trying to beat Noonan to

the punch and burn the LAPD

himself...why?

A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits

nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's

Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.

Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the

trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to

stanch the inevitable rot smell.

ME (V.O.)

Swap my car for Wilhite's. The

former head of the LAPD's Narcotics

division dead in the trunk. Call it

the leverage I was looking for --

his body can buy me out of bad spot-

-and that's when I see it: a bandage poking out from under         *

Wilhite's collar...undo a couple buttons, lift the bandage.        *

FLASH TO:

BAM: me hit from behind by the Peeper. BAM: me firing at the       *

Peeper. Hit him in the left shoulder. BAM: Grabbing Wilhite's      *

shoulder in the Magdalena bathroom, him howling in pain.           *

RETURN TO:        *

The kind of wound a grazed bullet leaves.                          *

88.

ME (V.O.)                                    *

Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on                        *

Lucille, a girl younger than his                       *

youngest daughter. Call it grounds

for divorce...Call Wilhite Hector

Magdalena's murderer...

Slam the trunk as Wilhite's glazed eyes stare back at me.

Slow cruise, new ride means no tails. Check my mirrors           *

anyway. Back to the pad, back-streets all the way.               *

Rounding the corner -- break hard: those same process servers

leaning on my doorbell now.

ME

Bradley trying to bury me too. That

subpoena means my fifteen year

career with the LAPD just went up

in smoke.

Continue past. Those Process Geeks keep buzzing my doorbell.

Drop dimes. Dial Pete.

ME

Hey-

PETE (O.S.)

-Junior's left the fucking planet.

ME

You find him?

PETE

Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car

was out front. I scoped it: a sawed-

off shotgun in front, canned tuna

in the back seat. Think he's living

outta that car. After he left, I

tried to get inside his place: The

front door is triple pad-locked.

89.

ME

(out loud)

That knife is in there-

PETE

-the what?

Shit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too.

ME

Meet me down the street from his

place. You got bolt cutters?

PETE

I'll bring `em.

ME

Thirty minutes.

Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up.

Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail

as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out,

sidle up driver's side.

PETE

Who's car is that?

ME

Long story.

PETE

Junior looked real skeezed this

morning. Like he was on a dope jag.

ME

Yeah?

PETE

Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be

careful. He was fucking around with

his front door before he left. I

don't know what he was doing.

ME

Two honks if he shows. Then meet me

in the alley, back of his place.

90.

PETE

(handing me bolt-cutters)

What about this Bledsoe broad?

Milteer has called me twice.

ME

(taking the bolt-cutters)

One thing at a time pal.

Hustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket.

Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver

hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a

shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine

stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-

sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine

stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.

Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.

Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-

rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger

of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.

Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching

Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.

ME (V.O.)

Junior the Insane: You couldn't

hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,

and not have it rot your mind.

Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished

with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his

shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed

jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.

Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.

Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine.

ME (V.O.)

Junior stealing evidence from the

Magdalena crime scene.

91.

ME (V.O.)

Junior the Climber, trading me up

to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will

buy him a Bureau gig.

92.

Move into his kitchenette. Check the freezer even though

Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,

benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in

the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.

Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the

bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,

peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade

duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.

MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)

The safe scared me more than all of

it because a safe doesn't get

installed overnight...he'd been

working on something, planning

something...

Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the

refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator

out now. The safe bolted into the drywall. Stare at it: the

dial, the black paint-job...

CUT TO:

Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello

mold. Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive

noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this

clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall

out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.

THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.

Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like

honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-

walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...

Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the

snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front

of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck

it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas

but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.

Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.

Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to

Pete, then push the safe over the railing. Feature it almost

crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac. Pete jumps, yells:

PETE

Asshole!

93.

ME

Get it open if you can and meet me

back at Meg's!

Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the

pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-

-Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place.

Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the

Feds herding him like a rabid dog:

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Stay right here. I'll get it all

and come back. Don't move.

Ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen. Leap down half a

flight: put exterior brick between my head and the-

-BIG BOOM -- the grenade goes off.

Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight. Feds

come sprinting. Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up.

Juniors' front-door blown off. Terrified Neighbors greeted

with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs,

mags, dildos. The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a

photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach.

And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half. Crawls away growling

like a bear caught in one of his traps.

I step calm. Clear the alley slow. Don't let your stride give

you away. Another Black Buick arrives. More Bureau stiffs.

Keep moving. Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing. I'm

the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming

pad. The Powerhawk still another street up. Fire engines wail

close.

Shouts from behind now. Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my

way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.

94.

ME (V.O.)

Call it. Keep going and give up

Wilhite's car and the corpse

inside, or lay back and deal with

Noonan's Buzzcuts.

Lace my fingers behind my head, turn to face them -- catch a

form tackle from this geeked up junior G-Man diving from the

Buick, drives his shoulder and takes me down sprawling.

Welles Noonan staring. He picks nipped/mutilated fingernails.

ME (CONT'D)

Civil servants can't afford

manicures?

WELLES NOONAN

Breaking and entering, theft, and

willful destruction of private

property...and I'll add attempted

murder to the current first degree

murder charge I'm about to file

against you.

ME

Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't

be fucking around with shitty

shakedown routine -- you'd file.

Coercion equals confession. So

let's see you pound it out of me.

WELLES NOONAN

Where are the files you stole from

Sergeant Richard Stemmons.

ME

Junior. Your secret weapon right? I

mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted

fuck, but traditionally `vicious

fags' don't make the best major

case witnesses.

(beat, keep pushing)

I'm worried those burning dildos

may have damaged his credibility.

WELLES NOONAN

Oh I don't need his testimony

Klein. I'll just force yours.

95.

ME

WELLES NOONAN

ME

WELLES NOONAN

ME

WELLES NOONAN

(thrown)

ME

(scoffing)

WELLES NOONAN

ME

(sell this fucker now)

96.

WELLES NOONAN

I don't believe you'd turn.

Treacherous yes, traitorous no.

Tell me where Stemmons' files are.

ME

I'll bring them to you.

WELLES NOONAN

You're not leaving here Klein.

ME

Then like I said: you only get me.

WELLES NOONAN

I'll take it.

ME

I give you the body of Dan Wilhite,

head of LAPD's Narcotics Division.

Proof of a 20-year criminal

collusion between his department

and Hector Magdalena and my

testimony to link the dots.

(beat, make him believe)

Then I leave LA for good.

WELLES NOONAN

What happened to Wilhite?

ME

Suicide.

WELLES NOONAN

Like Sanderline Johnson?

WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)

Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's

body by noon tomorrow.

97.

ME

No more tails. I don't want anyone

else incriminated.

WELLES NOONAN

Agreed.

ME

(nod to agreement)

I get a copy of that?

WELLES NOONAN

After a judge signs it. Now Leave.

Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds

the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the

baffled Deputy.

WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)

We wait for him to deliver, then we

arrest him. You never saw that

agreement.

DEPUTY #1

Tail him?

WELLES NOONAN

No. Let him get comfortable...let

him believe me.

Backseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board.

ME (V.O.)

Running out of room, time, both.

Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.

Jump out of the cab, into Wilhite's Powerhawk. Slide in, slam

the door.

Bust in shaking. Teeth chatter like I'm freezing. Pete in the

garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power

drill, punching holes in Junior's safe.

PETE

I know what Feds look like -- those

were Feds with Junior...

98.

ME

Yeah and they made me leaving the

scene. Had to barter out.

PETE

Barter what?

ME

My Testimony. I signed a Federal

Witness Agreement.

Pete drops the drill.

PETE

You what?

ME

It's bullshit. Noonan's got no

intention of honoring it.

(beat)

They want Stemmons files though. I

think Junior's been working angles

for awhile, doing his own

investigations.

PETE

What did you do to his place? Nice

quiet neighborhood one minute,

Nagasaki the next.

ME

(point to safe)

He had a hand grenade tied to that.

(as Pete resumes drilling)

How much longer do you need?

PETE

Few more hours. Maybe. Junior

didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta

bore right through the face plate.

(beat)

You got some time now, why don't

you get Milteer off my back and go

work that Bledsoe broad.

ME

You read my mind.

Pull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights on low inside.

99.

The door opens. She's dressed for bed. I don't hesitate,

afraid she'll shun me. Move to her, she doesn't startle. An

arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers.

I take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before

they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and

kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my

split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in.

She feels exactly like I imagined.

My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward

a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over

her shoulders. I whisper:

ME

...tell me if I'm being too rough.

Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even

harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never

touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.

Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away.

I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever...

Lying there, staring at her. A silence and peace I've never

known. Not once.

ME

Tell me anything. Tell me

everything.

Label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just

as quickly. A long moment as she waivers...commits:

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Where would I start?

ME

Why here?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Why L.A.?

(this amazing smile)

Why is anybody here? Want the rest

of the world to know who they are.

100.

ME

You?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

No...I don't think so.

(beat)

I just love it. I grew up in

Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd

take me to the movies.

GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)                     *

The idea that you can outlive

yourself...that a part of you goes

on, long after you're gone.

(beat, grins)

Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of

the Atomic Vampires' being-

ME

-your ticket to immortality?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Hughes told me he could get me in

for this screen test two years ago.

Movie with Gregory Peck at

Universal. He thought he was

humoring me...until I got it. They

offered me the role...there in the

room. So Howard, who I'm sure never

thought in a million years I'd land

that part, makes some phone calls

and just like that they don't want

me anymore.

(beat)

Nobody calls now. I can't get in to

see any studio casting people. He's

ruined me in those circles.

ME

And you still want it-

GLENDA BLEDSOE

-bad enough to put on a silly

cheerleading skirt and try to make

the most god-awful dialogue sound

decent.

101.

ME

Surrounded by winos in werewolf

suits.

(she laughs, I laugh)

That's...dedication.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Or desperation. Depends on the day.

GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)

I'll get there though.

(beat)

I'll get there.

ME

Dwight Gillette.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

He asked me to take his `niece and

nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard.

These beautiful, funny little kids.

(tears she doesn't swipe)

I dropped them off. Didn't ask any

questions -- I believed Dwight. A

week later I saw their pictures in

the Post Office. A week after that

their little bodies came in on the

tide near San Pedro.

(beat, tears stream)

I'll never shake the thought that

maybe those poor kids thought I was

part of it. That I knew what was

going to happen to them. So I pray

to God that he let them look in

when I put that knife into Dwight.

(beat)

But I'll never ask his forgiveness

for doing it...

(beat, clears her eyes)

Why do they call you `Enforcer?'

ME

I've killed 44 men.

102.

She blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away

from mine.

ME (CONT'D)

33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for

profit -- mostly. Why did you sign

with Hughes, knowing what he was?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

`For profit -- mostly.'

Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...'

ME

I'm not much good.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Me neither.

She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and

it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She

takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things

audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.

BLACK.

Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow.

Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her

lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the

last good thing you'll get today.

Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light.

On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short-

stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching

for something else...Pete's voice behind me:

PETE (O.C.)

The Knife ain't there. File on top

of that middle pile: George Ainge

in an `undisclosed locale.'

I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down.

PETE

Junior documented everything like a

fucking Monk.

(pulls a file)

Like here: `has evidence' you

murdered Sanderline Johnson.

(MORE)

103.

PETE (cont'd)

Kept track of `suspected contract

killings' you pulled for the mob.

ME

You been up all night?

PETE

In-case Stemmons made a house-call.

He's got every goddamn address of

everybody you know...

(beat, hard)

And you should've told me about the

Bledsoe broad.

ME

There's nothing to tell.

PETE

Then call Milteer about this dead

Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind

like you, but I'll bet a murder

beef would violate her morals

clause quick.

(beat, hands phone)

Collect the rest of your money.

ME

I don't want it anymore.

PETE

Then give that five grand back.

ME

Junior stole it.

PETE

People are gonna start lining-up to

see you bleed, Pal.

104.

Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript

clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to

the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.

Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.

Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across

a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...

Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual

eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers.

Stop. Veer toward him...

KOENIG

(formal-frosty)

Your young partner called me at my

home, early this morning.

Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk.

KOENIG (CONT'D)

Heavily inebriated. Speaking

inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how

the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by

justice.' Is this the `bind' of

which we spoke earlier?

ME

Yeah.

KOENIG

And his apartment -- there was some

type of disturbance? A fire?

ME

That's why I needed his address. I

was trying to help him before

something like this happened. The

kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's

literally lost it.

(beat, deadpan)

He say anything else to you?

Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that

doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass

than he should. Trying to shake me.

105.

KOENIG

Only that he was in possession of

materials that might deeply damage

Chief Bradley...and yourself.

ME

Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his

lid. I don't want to go to Internal

Affairs but I'm afraid Junior

might've forced just that.

KOENIG

Let me try to locate the lad first

Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a

young career so soon.

ME

Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.

Spin, press on toward Bradley's office.

ME (V.O.)

Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in

the LAPD, digging. He'll find

Junior and when he does he'll find

Ainge...then Glenda...

Reach Bradley's office, burst in. Empty. To his Secretary:

ME

Where is he?

SECRETARY

(frowns at my informality)

Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.

Park the Powerhawk. Downwind. Out. Walking. Check my

Hamilton: 12:10 PM.

ME (V.O.)

Noonan's deadline lapsed ten

minutes ago. An official fugitive

from justice now.

Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear,

following him like he's handcuffed. PROTESTORS gather,

placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No! Mexico, Si!" The

group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus

continues: "DODGERS NO! MEXICO SI!'

106.

ME (V.O.)

Bradley doing damage control, the

forced relocation of the Ravine's

immigrants has the press in a

feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced

along as the token Mexican

mouthpiece.

BRADLEY

-this area has long been rife with

crime and venality, but with a

brand new Stadium, we can make this

horrible blight a bright spot and

give our Los Angeles Dodgers the

home they deserve.

(like Ruiz was an orphan)

Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his

travails growing up in this

horrible slum and why now is the

time to `Redeem The Ravine.'

REPORTER #2

Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney

Noonan has promised to deliver

surprise witnesses before the

Federal Grand jury on-

BRADLEY

-Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous

hack politician whose smear

campaign against us will fail, for

he has grievously underestimated

the moral rectitude of the Los

Angeles Police Department.

BRADLEY

Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave

you with Reuben Ruiz.

107.

ME

Your subpoena hasn't caught up to

me yet, Chief...

ME (CONT'D)

(hand him Junior's file)

Hurwitz Holdings.

ME (CONT'D)

You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought

big chunks of Chavez Ravine over

the past two years through a shell

company called Hurwitz Holdings.

(beat, look around)

If the Dodgers move here the value

of the land booms...you could sell

it off for a fortune -- or hang

onto it and make even more. The

parking lots alone would make you

all multi-millionaires.

ME

Word gets out that the three City

Officials who were pushing hardest

for a Stadium also stood to gain a

mint -- might color public opinion.

Might color it even more to know

that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives

was trying to purchase a huge tract

of that land from the biggest dope

dealer in town.

ME

Hector Magdalena owned ten and half

acres of this land.

(beat, ram him)

You didn't give a shit about

solving his disappearance. You were

worried that your real estate deal

was going south.

(MORE)

108.

ME (cont'd)

That's why you wanted Tommy found,

not because he was a murder suspect

or you were concerned that Noonan

might tap him as a federal

witness...you needed him to

finalize your fucking land grab. To

sign paperwork in place of his dead

Dad. That's why you've got Madge

and Lucille in custody now.

(beat)

Maybe I'll let your subpoena find

me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right

into it...the tales I could tell.

BRADLEY

How?

ME

Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence

teacher. His `excellent ratings'

didn't stop him from stealing the

Magdalena seizure and doing his own

investigation.

BRADLEY

Why would he investigate me?

ME

That was stapled to the cover.

(beat)

Why would Noonan worry about a Turd

like me now...when a high profile

target like you can be taken down.

BRADLEY

Where is Stemmons?

ME

No idea. If you haven't spoken to

Internal Affairs today, I'm sure

they've called. Junior's apartment

caught fire. Deeply deviant

material inside. Round him up-

(my angle)

-and anyone he's got with him.

109.

BRADLEY

I'll issue an A.P.B. saying

Stemmons is a known deviant

targeting kindergarten children.

ME

Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed

Wilhite too.

BRADLEY

How do y-

ME

-don't worry `how.' Why?

ME (CONT'D)

You're going after Narco yourself.

BRADLEY

Exposing the corrupt parts of the

LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll

prove that Police can police

themselves-

ME

-so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his

crusade and condemn your own before

he can...Jesus Christ can you turn

lemons to lemonade.

BRADLEY

No Cop will testify against other

Cops. This is why Wilhite has

suddenly disappeared.

ME

And how.

(beat)

So where do we go now Chief?

BRADLEY

(beat, eyes flick again to

the files I'm holding...)

There are other forces at work

here...faces we need to identify.

Names we need to know. A third

party.

(MORE)

110.

BRADLEY (cont'd)

Find out who Klein and I'll

reinstate you, rescind that

subpoena & burn the coroner's

report on Sanderline-

ME

-that report is only useful to

Noonan now.

BRADLEY

No. It ensures our mutual

destruction should you choose to

share the contents of that Stemmons

file. Which I know you won't do

until you figure out how it will

best benefit you.

He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the

press ranks once again.

ME (V.O.)

A mistake to underestimate me now

Chief. The price to keep your

secrets is steep...and you're going

to pay up. Soon.

Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near

it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They

see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers:

SIX-PACK

Something in your trunk smells to

high hell Lieutenant.

ME

Dead body.

Laughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning,

give `em an "Enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. I

jump in the Powerhawk and tear off.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Borrowed time burning fast. My days

are done. Only hours remain.

Whatever moves I have left...make

them now.

Going through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl.

Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon.

111.

PETE

Fucking Christ. You can't keep that

car in the garage, the smell's

coming into the house.

MEG

Open the windows.

PETE

That's not gonna help.

ME

(still scribbling)

Take a couple bottles of bleach,

pour it over the trunk.

PETE

What do you got in there?

ME

My foreseeable future.

MEG

I'm going to work.

ME

You taking her?

PETE

(God damn glowering)

I'm taking her.

ME (CONT'D)

What?

PETE

Hughes.

ME

This is almost over Pete -- I'll

give Milteer the five-grand back.

PETE

It's more than that.

112.

ME

I'll square it. It's my thing.

PETE

That you made mine.

ME

I'm sorry.

PETE

Look as bad as I've ever seen you.

ME

Things are as bad as they've ever

been...

ME (V.O.)

Bradley's Third Party Theory.

Everything linked: Wilhite,

Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my

own theories...and the one that

sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong

about.

ME (CONT'D)

Klein.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me!

That Cooze you threw everything

away for is still cooked! I got the

knife. I got Ainge-

ME

How'd you get this number Junior?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I got everything on you! AND I'M

GONNA USE IT!

ME

-you're a broom-closet Queer. Your

career is over.

113.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

The knife for MY file on Bradley.

I know you already burned that

Whore's but don't think I can't re-

do investigations.

ME

You snitch to Noonan, then what?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.

ME

Who? The Soviets?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Meet me in one hour with that file,

Fern Dell Park-

ME

-Where you used to snag fruits for

Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

Be there with Bradley's file or I

scratch your scabby Bitch.

ME

Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?

ME (CONT'D)

-I see anybody near there Junior,

the deals off and I gift that file

to Bradley to fuck you with-

GLENDA BLEDSOE

-Dave?

ME

(big beat)

Glenda?

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Sorry...you gave me this number...

114.

ME

Jesus...hey...

GLENDA

Who were you talking-

ME

-no, no. It's nothing. I had a

phone call, just before yours.

A beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking

the canyon. She sits up.

GLENDA

Was it him? The Cop you were

telling me about?

ME

I don't want you to worry. I'm

handling it. But I might send my

friend Pete out there.

GLENDA

You don't think it's safe?

ME

I'd just rather have someone there

with you.

GLENDA

I wish you would've woken me up

this morning.

ME

I'm better-looking in low light, I

didn't want to blow it for myself.

She laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in...

ME (CONT'D)

Stay by the phone.

GLENDA

I miss you.

And I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment

of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen,

scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655

TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.'

115.

Rolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any

back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary

Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick-

draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him

the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45.

ME

Where's the knife.

Junior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a

small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind

the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me.

ME

Turn your lights off...and just

come out and talk to me...Fritz.

A pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin,

divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The

lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car

that we've all heard before.

ME (V.O.)

Third Party Confirmed...I fucking

knew it.

Fritz Koenig steps out of the Packard.

KOENIG

Not much with these sub-rosa

things...

ME

(a nod to the Packard)

I thought it was Noonan tailing me.

KOENIG

Bradley's greatest stroke was

enlisting you to his side.

Junior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it.

ME (CONT'D)

Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not

Narco.

KOENIG

When did you know?

116.

ME

I didn't. I had a feeling. I

smelled cover-up all over Hector's

disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't

have the muscle or the mind-set to

kingpin something that big by

himself...you knew about Bradley

trying to buy him out?

KOENIG

He was offering to exonerate Hector

and clear his criminal record.

Hector met with Wilhite and I to

inform us of his decision...

FLASHBACK TO:

For the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive

and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite.

KOENIG (V.O.)

...to accept Bradley's deal...

Koenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs.

KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...and although the terms of that

deal worked well for him. I found

them less than favorable...

Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before

shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite

staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the

coup de grace head-shot to Hector.

KOENIG

Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots

for Human Vice. These are slums I

run & profit from. If these slums

suddenly become Stadiums, that

profit goes elsewhere...that crime

goes elsewhere.

ME

Bradley...you two got greed in

common.

Koenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead.

117.

ME

You knew about Wilhite and Lucille.

That's how you were operating him.

KOENIG

I was aware of his sexual

predilections.

ME

(a scowl for Junior)

...and someone else's...

KOENIG

(that great white grin )

We share an eye for human frailty

and we're both born blackmailers

Dave.

(beat)

I knew young Stemmons here had a

fondness for Lads, stretching back

to his days at the academy.

ME

And now you're his only ally.

(back at Junior)

This sad queer who fell out with

cops and flunked out with the Feds.

(back to Koenig)

So you get this file to battle

Bradley with. What's Junior get in

return?

JUNIOR STEMMONS

JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!

JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)

(two inches from my face)

THERE'S YOUR KNIFE KLEIN!

118.

KOENIG

(turning his back)

I don't want to watch...I'm sorry

it came to this, Dave.

JUNIOR STEMMONS

I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth

it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a

crooked cop, you think small.

ME (V.O.)

Whatever moves I had left...I just

made.

KOENIG

This isn't it!

KOENIG

Poorly played Dave...poorly

played...

KOENIG

Could I talk you into something?

Cut you in on something?

119.

Give him no hope.

ME

Won't work for me Fritz.

He nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now.

KOENIG

Give me a minute then?

I do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an

ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes

aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this

short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.

KOENIG

(with a nod)

Okay...

...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content

as I shoot him. Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes,

retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE -

1195 Centinela Ave. Inglewood, CA 90302

George Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer,

goofing on a TV test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick.

Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks

this is a good sign...I shoot him right through the glass.

Bradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the

stairs, his back door wide open. Reaches the landing, turns

on the light.

Feature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee. I

look like something exhumed. His monogrammed serving napkins

soak up blood from my knifed side. He startles school-girl.

Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained. He

inches forward, cinching his robe.

BRADLEY

Who?

ME

Fritz Koenig.

120.

BRADLEY

(going pale)

Where?

ME

Dead. Along with Wilhite,

Junior...and Hector Magdalena.

BRADLEY

Why are you here?

ME

To collect. I have the things you

need to destroy Noonan's play.

These same things can be used to

destroy you.

BRADLEY

Things like?

ME

Stemmons files...and Wilhite's

body. He committed suicide after

you subpoenaed him.

BRADLEY

This body is in your possession?

ME

And it's what you need to burn

Narco to the ground...but if those

files and his body were to be given

to Noonan and the Feds, with me

providing the cherry-on-top

testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The

word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.

BRADLEY

What will this cost?

ME

A percentage of your Dodger Stadium

stake in perpetuity. You buy my

silence for a fourth of Hurwitz

Holdings.

121.

BRADLEY

Doubtful.

ME

What'd you expect? A stick-up?

Empty your safe? I'm about to

disappear for good, and you're

gonna fund my new life. You can't

counter-punch out of this. Arrest

me and I snitch the world.

(point to the file)

I'll hold that over your head for

the rest of your life. Renege on

our deal and it won't matter if

it's tomorrow or ten years from

now...I'll fry you with that file.

(at my cracked Hamilton)

I'm officially outta time now

Chief. Call it.

Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple

bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten.

BRADLEY

Wilhite's body...Bury it.

Cruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home...

ME (V.O.)

Shaking to see her, touch her...

Door locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A

pissed-off nod.

Liquor wafts off of him.

ME

You go to bed drunk, or just been

up all night.

No answer as I follow him into the house.

KLEIN

Where's Glenda, is she asle-

122.

ME (V.O.)

Seen Pete do this a dozen times and

every time the same thought: God

help me if he ever hits me like

that...

ME (CONT'D)

Don't kill me.

MILTEER

The harder you hit him the quicker

I say `stop' -- and cease that

absurd crying.

GLENDA BLEDSOE

(at Milteer)

THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-

MILTEER

-touch me and he dies.

MILTEER (CONT'D)

Kick him-kick him-kick him.

MILTEER (CONT'D)

(prim, official)

-you may stop.

(beat, for the room)

Howard determined that this was the

price for your time together.

123.

MILTEER

You still have a job.

Milteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur

for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing.

PETE

...I'm sorry Dave...

Pushing out words past shattered teeth.

ME

I put you here...that Powerhawk-

PETE

-there's a body in the trunk-

ME

-burn it.

Big drunk nod from Pete. Glenda panicking, trying to stanch

blood that keeps rushing. Pete, reeling drunk, leans down,

stuffs something in my jacket.

PETE

I'm so sorry....

Steaming water. Almost painful. I sit in the tub, let the

shower rain down. Drain floods diluted red. Wash my wounds,

my soul. So many bruises I look bubonic. My face still

swelling, already purple-black. My left eye more than swollen

shut. On the other side of the curtain:

Glenda naked. Beauty that catches in my chest. Try to stand,

turn my destroyed face. She gently pushes me back down. Sits

into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits

my lips. No nerves, no unease. Home. She closes the curtain.

Post-coital. Both wide awake. Still scared.

GLENDA

Let me take you to a hospital.

ME

We'd never make it inside.

124.

GLENDA

(big beat)

I'm worried.

ME

I'm through the worst of it.

She frames my face with her hands.

GLENDA

I don't believe you.

Lies will only leak, expose. The silence makes me just as

guilty. She lets me off the hook, her head on my arm, leaning

in. I kiss her.

GLENDA (CONT'D)

(at a whisper)

Was I worth this?

ME

Whatever the cost.

GLENDA

Just like that then?

ME

Just like that.

A nod. An understanding. Another kiss, the last one I'll

remember.

Head shaved. Stopped bleeding. You clearly see what my face

will look like 25 years hence. Gauze over my left eye.

Reading the Paper: my dress-blue photo, the one that looks

nothing like me now. Headline:

`LAPD Officer Wanted in Connection with

Recent Rash of Murders...U.S. Attorney

Welles Noonan issued a nationwide warning

to law enforcement...'

ME (V.O.)

My deadline with Noonan: two days

old. He and Bradley playing chess

by press release.

(MORE)

125.

ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

Bradley relocates the deaths of

Captain Fritz Koenig and Sergeant

Richard Stemmons to Chavez

Ravine...both given posthumous

Medals of Valor. Junior dies a hero

after all.

INSERT: TELEVISION SCREEN

Bradley: Professorial in glasses and pinstripes, mid-press

conference. Watch him work...a statesman's guile.

ME (V.O.)

Cop-killings clear the way for

Bradley's "Redeem The Ravine'

mandate. Dodger Stadium

construction moves forward.

(beat)

Captain Dan Wilhite and Hector

Magdalena. Missing. APB's issued.

Bradley's press fodder cast them as

`outlaw cop and drug dealer' who

most likely fled to Mexico. Narco

under a full-blown, Bradley-led

investigation.

BRADLEY (ON SCREEN)

...police unit run amok, who's long

tradition of graft, does not extend

to other divisions of the LAPD...

Just sit and watch Glenda. Listen to her sleep: rhythmic

breathing. The little natural smiling curl to her lips.

Blonde hair splayed over white sheets. Touch her.

ME (V.O.)

I haven't loved you long enough to

leave it all behind...Too many

enemies. Too many ways for you to

get hurt. Too close to me...a

decision that will haunt me the

rest of my days...

The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to

Glenda. Place a letter under it on the night stand:

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

"My Heaven: the hours I had with

you. My Hell: the years ahead,

without. Someday I'll see you

before you even know I'm looking."

126.

I stand quiet, `grief' the best word but still not enough.

Choke back tears as I lift Pete's camera and take the black

and white picture you've seen before.

Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete

planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...

FLASHBACK TO:

PETE

...be nice to be in with a

billionaire who's got a fleet of

planes, fly you outta the country

on short notice...

RETURN TO:

A Times vending machine: paper blazing with front page photos

of wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past my old face. Past

Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me.

ME (V.O.)

Pete's penance beating built me a

brand new face...nobody gives me a

second glance...not even the cops I

recognize.

Up to the TWA counter: glance up at the departures board-

BLACK.

Legend: Recife, Brazil, 1978

I'm old. Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a

gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed

uneven. I start to pack my suitcases. Old files you think you

may have seen before. An old gun you know you've seen before.

Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...

ME (V.O.)

My will to remember. My confession

complete. Still not enough.

(beat)

Post-scripts.

(MORE)

127.

ME (V.O.) (cont'd)

Me: gringo exile rich off funds

from Stadium Parking lots. Meg and

Pete: still married. Three boys.

Boyce Bradley: Lt. Governor, then a

Gubernatorial primary loser to some

chump who acted in Chimp movies.

Welles Noonan, convicted of jury

tampering in `64. Prison suicide in

`66. Howard Hughes: a shut-in

shitting in coffee-cans at the

Vegas Hilton.

(beat)

George Ainge: body found, murder

unsolved. Madge Magdalena, liver

failure in `68. Lucille Magdalena:

Mother of five.

ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding

her name. Only a photograph,

yellowed with years-passed,

reminding me of everything I never

was.

(beat)

Then a week-old Times at the place

I buy coffee. Her picture sees me

before I realize she's looking. Her

Face eternal-beautiful...

ME (V.O.)

...and it asked me to revoke our

time apart, redeem it...tell her

anything...tell her everything...

WHITE JAZZ
