Alien III

Screenplay by John Fasano

Story by Vincent Ward & John Fasano

FIRST DRAFT

March 29, 1990

- Hesse

BROTHER KYLE

Well would he guess the ascending of the star,

Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.

He knew the course of every malady,

Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.

Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

BROTHER KYLE

Tend you quickly he will,

with bottles from a shelf.

But heals not, so easily,

The ills which plague himself.

BROTHER JOHN

(to Kyle)

Enough.

BROTHER JOHN

(to the burned Monk)

Relax.

(to Kyle)

Put those lungs of yours to better

use.

BROTHER KYLE

Yes, Doc Tor.

JOHN

Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at

late afternoon mealtime and don't come

back to work today --

BURNED MONK

But John --

JOHN

I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.

You're lucky you only burned yourself on

the side of the furnace.  If some of that

glass had gotten on your arm --

JOHN

-- it would've burned clean through to

the other side.

JOHN

That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

BURNED MONK

Thank you, John.  I --

JOHN

You're welcome.  Go!

KYLE

Good work.

JOHN

All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

KYLE

You're yourself, that's better...

KYLE

The Abbot will be pleased.

JOHN

Don't.

KYLE

Don't what?

JOHN

Please don't tell him.  At least until

I know if there's an infection.

KYLE

You want to be the Abbey's Physician,

and you haven't learned the first rule:

Don't worry about the patient.

KYLE

I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know

how you must --

JOHN

You don't, but thanks anyway.

KYLE

Not coming down?

JOHN

I have someone waiting for me.

JOHN

Come on, Mattias.

PHILIP

Brother John.

JOHN

Brother Philip.

PHILIP

Feeding the mind instead of the body

again?

JOHN

My training has taught me to feed what's

hungry.

PHILIP

As did mine.  As long as you're alone.

Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book

leaves the library.

JOHN

How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

JOHN

Perfect.

John

(reading)

In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother

Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury

the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

VOICE O/S

Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John

Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

ABBOT

Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed

him on the way up.  He said you'd come

in alone.  I knew better.

ABBOT

Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

ABBOT

You know what Philip says about Mattias'

hair and his breathing.  You'll have to

take him out of here.

JOHN

He likes when I read to him and -- I

can't --

ABBOT

(smiles)

Someone must have left this one unlocked.

Take the book with you.

JOHN

Father, I --?

ABBOT

Kyle tells me you did a good job at

the glassworks today.

JOHN

I'll reserve judgement until the patient

lives.

ABBOT

It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...

an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

ABBOT

Just have it back before the end of lunch.

Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

JOHN

Thank you.

(to Mattias)

Let's go upstairs, boy.

JOHN

In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother

Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury

the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day

by day, one by one, until I am the only

one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear

it, then with my dog --

JOHN

- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest

this pestilence - this Black Death -

stay my hand.

(beat)

This was finished by another hand...

RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON

-----------------------

POPULATION: 350 Exiles

CRIME:  Political Heresy

KYLE O/S

Watch it!

KYLE

John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

COMPUTER VOICE

(sotto)

Seal broken...seal broken...

WOMAN

...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS

Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.

Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper

sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has

hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.

Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt

and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

KYLE

John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

JOHN

No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone

in here --

SECOND MONK

This is forbidden.

KYLE

John.  Just get the hell out of there --

JOHN

I don't want to stay.  I have to get her

out before this sinks.  You come in, give

me a hand --

KYLE

Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,

so this is technology forbidden to us.

Get out of there now!

JOHN

All right --

CUT TO:

FIRST MONK

(reverent)

A space ship...

SECOND MONK

(even more reverent)

A woman...

KYLE

You shouldn't have gone in --

JOHN

I'm supposed to be a doctor.

JOHN

She could've been lost.

FIRST MONK

Been a long time since I saw either.

SECOND MONK

It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we

supposed to do with it?

KYLE

What was it like in there --?

JOHN

Lights.  So many lights --

THIRD MONK

Tow it in.  Bring it in.

SECOND MONK

It's evil.

FIRST MONK

It's just technology.

SECOND MONK

Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

THIRD MONK

The Abbot will know what we should do

with it --

KYLE

Just lights?

JOHN

Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

SECOND MONK

See?  Just look at the fish.

THIRD MONK

The Abbot will know.

SECOND MONK

They're boiled.  These fish are boiled.

JOHN

Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.

Like Heaven on Earth.

RIPLEY

Wait.  New...

GO TO BLACK...

RIPLEY

AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

JOHN

You're out of it.  Out of it...

ABBOT

How is the woman, John?

JOHN

I don't think she's here yet.

JOHN

She is close, though.

RIPLEY

What the hell --?

RIPLEY

This must be a dream.  A bad one.

RIPLEY

Who are you?

ABBOT

I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.

And you?

RIPLEY

Ripley.  How did I get here?

ABBOT

Your vehicle crash landed.

(indicates John)

Brother John found you and brought

you here.

RIPLEY

Where is here?

ABBOT

This is the Minorite Abbey within the

manmade orbiter Arceon.

RIPLEY

Can I use a radio to --

ABBOT

We have no radio here.  We are a monastic

order that has renounced all modern

technology.  We live the old way.  The pure

way.

RIPLEY

Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever

took me out of the stasis tube must not

have run the full D-F program...

Where's Newt?

RIPLEY

There was a little girl with me --

ABBOT

You were alone.

RIPLEY

No.  She was with me.  I put her in her

stasis tube -- We launched when the --

ABBOT

You were the only living thing found

aboard that vessel.

RIPLEY

(slowly)

Oh, God.  Newt.

RIPLEY

It came with us.

ABBOT

What came with you?

RIPLEY

Listen -- there is a danger here.  It

came with me.  How long have I been here?

ABBOT

Almost two days --

RIPLEY

(calculates)

Loose for two days.  This planet could be

overrun within the week.

RIPLEY

Look, there's a xenomorph --

(sees his confusion)

An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.

And now it's here.

RIPLEY

Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a

platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission

to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six

months ago - maybe a year --

ABBOT

(interrupts)

Wait a moment --

ABBOT

Leave us.

ABBOT

Continue.

RIPLEY

We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from

Gateway sub-orbital space station --

ABBOT

Not possible.

RIPLEY

What do you mean?

ABBOT

When we left Earth seventy years ago, it

was on the brink of a New Dark Age.

Technology was on the verge of destroying

the planet's environment.  A computer virus

was threatening to wipe away all recorded

knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any

way it could be averted.  In the almost

forty years since we were towed out here

in hypersleep, the news that came with

occasional supply ships only got worse.

Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We

had to resign ourselves to the fact that

worst had come to pass, and the Earth

no longer existed.

RIPLEY

(slowly)

Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How

many people do you have here?  Let's worry

about them.  Warn them --

ABBOT

Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest

some more.

RIPLEY

I don't need rest - I need to get to

your people.  You've got to get to them --

tell them about the alien --

ABBOT

I have had enough for now.

RIPLEY

Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?

It could wipe out the entire population

of this planet.  It may have started

already - Have there been any unusual

deaths since I got here?

ABBOT

No.  And there won't be.

ABBOT

Bolt it.

JOHN

What is it -- What's wrong?

ABBOT

Your patient is in a dangerous mental

state.  Nobody gets in or out until I

say so.

JOHN

But I.  Her meals --

ABBOT

Nobody.

JOHN

Father, I don't understand --

HYSTERICAL MONK

Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot

said you'd -- I need -- you're the

medic --

JOHN

What?!

HYSTERICAL MONK

My Sandy -- she's ill --

JOHN

Huh?  A woman?

HYSTERICAL MONK

Sandy.  My ewe.

JOHN

One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.

Call a vet.

HYSTERICAL MONK

Father Anselm was the vet.

JOHN

You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.

All creatures great and small...

HYSTERICAL MONK

I just gave her dinner and she

keeled over.

JOHN

So would I.  It's freezing in here.

HYSTERICAL MONK

Been using the wood from the walls

for the fire in my cabin.

JOHN

Haven't we all...

JOHN

May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay

around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

JOHN

First, I'll --

JOHN

Wait a minute...

HYSTERICAL MONK

What is it?

JOHN

I don't know.  It's all over the ground.

Some sort of --

HYSTERICAL MONK

What?!  WHAT?!

JOHN

Jesus!  Help m --

RIPLEY

Idiots...I'll --

RIPLEY

What the -?

ABBOT V.O.

An evil has come to Arceon...

ABBOT

You heard Brother Graham tell of the

devil inside sheep's wool --

ABBOT

An evil brought by this woman in her

vessel of technology.

RIPLEY

This can't be happening.

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

You have no voice in this tribunal.

RIPLEY

You must listen to me!  You're all in

terrible danger!  It came with me on

the ship --

ABBOT

We know that.  At first we believed its

arrival was a good omen.  But it has only

brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

Evil.

RIPLEY

Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It

brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

ABBOT

We know the name of the evil it brought.

It brought technology.  Technology to

destroy our planet, as surely as it

destroyed the Earth.

MONK IN AUDIENCE

Destruction!

RIPLEY

I was on the Earth less than a year ago.

It's still there.  People, cities, all

still there!

ABBOT

(matter of fact)

All dead.

RIPLEY

(screams)

It's still there!

ABBOT

You could not have been on the Earth a

year ago, because there is no Earth to

be on -- for at least twenty years.

RIPLEY

I haven't been floating in space for

twenty years.  Let me get to my ship

and I'll prove it.

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

No.  Who knows what new evils she'll

release if allowed back into that

infernal machine.

MONK IN AUDIENCE

No!  Don't let her!!

TRIBUNAL MEMBER

This woman is a danger.  She denies The

New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

RIPLEY

This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph

loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must

have stowed away on my ship -- must have

killed --

(swallows hard)

Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.

You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like

an egg - grows -

(mimes)

Explodes out of you - keeps growing into

some sort of monster.  Kills you --

Kills all of you...

RIPLEY

Who are you people?  Look at you -- all

of you -- the way you're dressed.  This

isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --

on a artifical planet.  What are you

doing out here?

RIPLEY

Isn't there anyone here who will

listen?

RIPLEY

(defeated)

I guess not.  I can't believe this...

ABBOT

Then there is no choice.

ABBOT

(to Ripley)

The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.

To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on

your soul.

SLAM CUT TO:

RIPLEY

You won't be able to fight it...

You don't know what it is --!

RIPLEY

You've sentenced yourselves to

death!

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

...they'll have started before she gets

down to the Hermitage level.

ABBOT

No trouble?

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

Only finding the wood for the ship.  But

Anderson's hut was about that big, and

he's dead three months now.

ABBOT

I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister

next winter.  Well, we might not get to

the winter if we don't take care of this.

By winter time we can start taking the

penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK

The wood isn't going to last forever.

ABBOT

Neither are we --

ABBOT

Go ahead.

JOHN

This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

ABBOT

Yes, and you did a good job.  You

shouldn't feel responsible.  You

couldn't have known --

JOHN

Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that

there may be something to what she says.

ABBOT

There isn't.

JOHN

I don't understand what you are doing.

ABBOT

This colony is my responsibility.  I am

protecting the colony.

JOHN

From what?  This woman?  You never gave

her a chance.  How can you be so sure

you're right?

ABBOT

A better question is what makes you

think I'm wrong?

JOHN

You didn't see this thing -- this demon --

Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

ABBOT

(realizes)

That's right.  You both did.

(beat)

And what was it?

JOHN

I -- I don't know what it was.  But I

don't think Ripley was a party to it.

ABBOT

She admits she brought it.

JOHN

But she tried to warn us --

ABBOT

You know that's how the devil works.

Deception.

JOHN

But I believe her.  I don't know how to

describe it -- A feeling.

ABBOT

You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.

Where does this feeling originate, John?

JOHN

(points to his head)

Here.

ABBOT

I believe you.  But your feelings are

fooling you.

JOHN

It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

ABBOT

Don't think.

ABBOT

It's been a long night.  For all of us.

You really don't understand what you're

dealing with here.

JOHN

That's what she said.

ABBOT

These are ideas which threaten the very

system we live under.  The creature is

dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.

Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,

but leave this alone.

JOHN

But I --

ABBOT

Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias

into the Library, all right?  For your

own good, just stay out of this.

ABBOT

I mean it.

JOHN

(slowly)

Yes, Father.

WORKER

Here you go, woman.  Something from your

ship.  Something to keep you company --

RIPLEY

You fucking idiots!  You're dead!

You're all dead!

RIPLEY

(sotto)

Dead...

RIPLEY

Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.

Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

RIPLEY

Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

RIPLEY

(snaps)

Don't stare at me!

VOICE O/S

Sorry.

JOHN

Now find John and have him brought to

me immediately.

THIRD BURLY MONK

Yes, Father.

ABBOT

Start in the library.  And keep it quiet.

KYLE

Hey!  Watch it!

KYLE

What?  What is it?

JOHN

I -- Abbot.  Must --

KYLE

John - relax.  Take a deep breath -

Christ, now I sound like you --

KYLE

Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

JOHN

(panting)

Yes.  Devil.

WHISPERING MONKS

He's got it...

SECOND WHISPERING MONK

Like the Comet Woman...

THIRD WHISPERING MONK

He found her...

WHISPERING MONK

He's infected...

KYLE

Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's

see the --

JOHN

Don't humor me -- I'm --

KYLE

Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

KYLE

Wait -- JOHN!

CUT TO:

ABBOT

Cold tonight --

BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER

Gets colder every night.

ABBOT

And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken

so much wood out of the structure the

surface wind blows right through the

colony.  Right under the floor --

BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER

Right up your bloody backside.  Nights

like this make me miss plumbing --

Ack --!

ABBOT O/S

What?

BALD TRIBUNAL MONK

I don't -- AAH --

ABBOT

Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

CUT TO:

RIPLEY V.O.

Death...

RIPLEY

Wherever I go.

WHITE-HAIRED MAN

Take it.

RIPLEY

Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

ANTHONY

You waiting for meat?  They don't bring

me meat because they know I'm an android.

Really don't need it.  Bread's better

for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so

it makes you feel fuller than you are.

RIPLEY

Not hungry.

ANTHONY

Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

RIPLEY

Waste of time.

ANTHONY

You don't eat, you'll starve to death,

girl.

RIPLEY

That was the plan when they put me down

here.  And why should you care?

ANTHONY

Because I'm a synthetic person you don't

think I can care?

RIPLEY

Believe me, that's a discussion you don't

want to have with me.

ANTHONY

You told me you had a bad experience and

a good one with androids --

RIPLEY

That's one of each.  That means you could

go either way.  I'm tired of talking about

this.

ANTHONY

You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight

the bastards --

RIPLEY

I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be

dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't

get the satisfaction.

ANTHONY

He?  You make it sound like this Alien

has a personal score to settle with you.

The biology you describe:  Queen laying

eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very

insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear

grudges.

RIPLEY

And Androids usually aren't the prisoners

of lunatics that believe they're ancient

Greeks.

ANTHONY

Medieval Monks.

RIPLEY

Whatever.

ANTHONY

And they've only chose to live the life

style, they don't believe they're --

(hears something)

What's that?

JOHN

(hoarse)

Ripley!

ANTHONY

Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --

You're going to wake everybody up.

ANTHONY

Brother John?

JOHN

Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

ANTHONY

Made too good for that.  What're

you doing?

JOHN

I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

ANTHONY

What?  You look like you've seen the

devil.

RIPLEY O/S

He has.

ANTHONY

You mean he --

RIPLEY

I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,

you've seen the Alien?

RIPLEY

I can tell you have.  I was right.

It came with me.

(to the wall, sharp)

Go away.

RIPLEY

Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I

know what you want.  I can't help you.

I couldn't help any of the others.

Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.

Do you understand?

RIPLEY

You going to stay, Father?  But you're

not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can

listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot

was right.  I am guilty.  But not of

heresy.  Of murder.

RIPLEY

The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.

That was when I first met the Alien.

RIPLEY

No, not the same one that's here now.

Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the

same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.

I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.

When I went the second time --

RIPLEY

Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --

stayed alive to keep Newt alive.

Hoped maybe that would make up for...

RIPLEY

Now he got her too.  What's the point?

(hard again)

Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you

let me out you'll want me to help you

and it will start all over again.

Let it end.

RIPLEY

I can't help you.

JOHN

Puh. (pant) Please.

RIPLEY

It never ends.

RIPLEY O/S

Sheep?

ANTHONY

It must be able to take on some of the

characteristics of the animal it grows in.

Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive

soldier race -- warring parties drop the

eggs on opposing planets --

RIPLEY

And the alien takes on the form of the

creature that finds it, assuming that

animal is the dominant life form on the

planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

ANTHONY

It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

RIPLEY

Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that

to animals.

JOHN

Wait a minute - I thought you were the

expert on this monster.

RIPLEY

Is that the only reason you came to get

me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

JOHN

Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of

it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.

I was wrong not to say anything.  I was

afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a

monk, you know?

RIPLEY

Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

JOHN

We all are.  Took vows.

RIPLEY

I don't know about the Abbot.

JOHN

I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

RIPLEY

Is that speaking up for someone?

JOHN

No.  Charity.

RIPLEY

All right, let's forget about the past

and get on to our survival.  No more

prisoners behind us?

ANTHONY

Not for years.

RIPLEY

Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days

to lay his eggs our only hope is to get

off this - What is this?

JOHN

Arceon.

ANTHONY

Satellite.

RIPLEY

Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

JOHN

We can't.

RIPLEY

We can't what?

JOHN

Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

RIPLEY

A Tape Library?

JOHN

Books.

RIPLEY

So?

JOHN

The reason we are out here.  Like the

Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries

on remote islands off England during

the First Plague --

RIPLEY

There must be books on other colonies --

JOHN

Some of these books survived the burning

of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They

contain knowledge that exists in no

other record.  Their value is unestimable.

JOHN

We're supposed to protect them.

RIPLEY

(to Anthony)

And what does an android have to do

with all this?

JOHN

He's a spy.

ANTHONY

The Company planted me here.

RIPLEY

The Company?  What does the Company have

to do with this?

ANTHONY

They built this prison.

RIPLEY

Prison?

JOHN

Colony.

ANTHONY

Prison.  They are all political heretics.

RIPLEY

You left that part out.

JOHN

The order was more of a counter culture,

a reaction to the Technology that was

beginning to take over everyone's lives.

It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't

watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons

into the air.  The earliest members

renounced technology.  Started to collect

the remaining books.  Nobody would have

noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

RIPLEY

Your Abbot talked about that.  The

New Plague.

ANTHONY

A computer virus.  A bad program.  By

this time the Corporate structure was

transglobal, all the world's data storage

systems were linked.  It spread through

two countries before it was stopped.

JOHN

After a scare like that, thousands flocked

to our retreat.  People started clamoring

for written information.  For our books.

They abandoned the modern ways --

RIPLEY

I think I can see how this comes out.

They gave up their possessions.

ANTHONY

This was a threat --

RIPLEY

To the Company.

JOHN

They sold the technology.  A movement

to live simply was quickly twisted by

Federal agents into a political movement

against the Company-controlled World

Government.  Too much was at stake.

RIPLEY

Too much profit.

JOHN

We were sentenced as political dissidents.

This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men

were packed up with all our books, and

towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The

eldest died very quickly.

RIPLEY

The Company had such a sense of irony.

Sending you out on this wooden tub.

ANTHONY

I was placed among them as a sensor.

Keeps tabs on the movement.

RIPLEY

So how'd they find out about you?

ANTHONY

I told them.  After the supply ship's

stopped coming I saw no point in keeping

up the charade.  Since I was a sort of

walking reminder of technology, they cast

me down.

RIPLEY

Join the club.

(to John)

I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't

have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be

prudent to try to preserve man's written

works for generations -- without women.

RIPLEY

And I don't know about your New Plague,

but I was just on Earth and everything's

fine.

RIPLEY

I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?

Means I must be right about the Earth.

JOHN

(beat)

Perhaps.

RIPLEY

That's better than nothing.  Come on.

RIPLEY

At any rate, let's forget about the

Earth completely - whether you're right

or I'm right what's important is getting

the hell out of here.  From here my ship

is...?

ANTHONY

In Heaven.

RIPLEY

Right.  And this is...

ANTHONY

This orbiter was patterned after a

medieval concept of the universe --

(makes a circle in the air)

They call the top half "Heaven - "

JOHN

The Abbey, the fields --

ANTHONY

The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

RIPLEY

Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

JOHN

The sea.

ANTHONY

Really.

RIPLEY

Work with me here.  How far is it back

to the surface of the planet?

JOHN

As a stone falls --- Five miles through

the center.

RIPLEY

And the elevator -- the thing they

lowered me down in?

JOHN

Ropes cut.

ANTHONY

It's smart.  First he cuts their escape

off, then works his way down through the

monastery level by level until there

isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

RIPLEY

Well, you start appreciating him more

than me and I'll find a way to shut

you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we

get up?

JOHN

There are ladders.

RIPLEY

Five miles with the Alien between us

and there?  Good luck, boys.

JOHN

You can't --

RIPLEY

Can't what?  Not help you go to your

deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

JOHN

I need you.  I can't do it alone.

RIPLEY

I've fought these creatures twice

before.  It take a lot to kill

these things.  Heavy artillery.

ANTHONY

We don't have weapons here.

RIPLEY

How about something we can make weapons

from?  Do you have anything like that --

any modern things here?

JOHN

We renounced technology.  It was those

things that caused the Plague.

RIPLEY

This is a man-made planet.  Something has

to be recirculating your air, your water.

JOHN

God?

RIPLEY

Please.

JOHN

I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

RIPLEY

Most people do.  Without some sort of

technology we haven't got a chance.

ANTHONY

There is technology.

ANTHONY

A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air

and water come out.

RIPLEY

An atmosphere processing plant --

ANTHONY

The heart and lungs of Arceon.

RIPLEY

Where is it?

ANTHONY

One level beneath the underground sea.

JOHN

That's five levels up --

ANTHONY

(points into the gloom)

On the other side of the orbiter.

JOHN

A chance.

RIPLEY

All right.  You've got me - so far.

But here's the deal:  I don't know

how many of your brethren are going

to be alive when we get up there,

but if we make it to my ship, you're

all coming with me.  We'll take as

many of your precious books as we

can carry, but we're going.  I'm not

going to fight this thing again to

end up alone again.  Understand?

RIPLEY

We're all dead anyway.  We might as

well go fi --

RIPLEY

Ugh - I'm all right.

RIPLEY

Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...

Come on.

CUT TO:

ABBOT

(sotto)

Stay together.  Together...

ABBOT

Run!  RUN!

ABBOT

No - NO.  The --

JOHN O/S

It isn't your fault, you know.

RIPLEY

What?

JOHN

Those things you said before --

JOHN

I read about it in psychology books.

Sometimes when people outlive someone

they cared for, they transfer some of

the guilt for that person's death to

themselves.

RIPLEY

I got a belly full of that from the

Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.

"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something

like that.  But that's not what I was

thinking about.  I was thinking about

my "friend" up there.

RIPLEY

He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but

not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like

he's playing with me.  Maybe they have

some sort of race memory.  Maybe he

knows what I did to his "mother."

That's why he didn't just kill me.

That would be too easy.  He has to

torment me.

JOHN

You make it sound human.

RIPLEY

Hell, I don't know what it is.

JOHN

I think I do.

JOHN

Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

RIPLEY

Thanks.

JOHN

You're welcome.

RIPLEY

I'm all right.

JOHN

Hold this against your nose.  It'll

stop the flow.

JOHN

I'm a doctor.

ANTHONY

No - please.  Just let me sit.

Awhile.

ANTHONY

Damn it.

RIPLEY

What was that?

ANTHONY

The reason I'm down here.

JOHN

Visions.

ANTHONY

Dreams.

RIPLEY

Androids can't dream...

ANTHONY

That's probably what they thought when

they built me.  But my brain is cyber-

organic - patterned after the human

brain - it functions the same way a

human brain does.  It accumulates random

images and sensations during waking

hours, but unlike the human brain that

sloughs them off during sleep --

RIPLEY

Androids don't sleep.

ANTHONY

Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later

models, but I don't.  Do you know what

happens to the human brain when it is

deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off

the dreams while you're awake, as

hallucinations.  Same thing with me.

For twenty years I absorbed data on this

planetoid.  A little after we lost contact

with Earth the visions started.  They

thought I was insane.  I had to explain

that it was because I was an android.

They liked that even less.

RIPLEY

What did you see?

ANTHONY

What I always see.  Images of Monsters.

Demons.

JOHN

They're portents.  They stand for an

evil yet to come.

ANTHONY

Just images I've absorbed from those old

books and have no way to get rid of.

RIPLEY

I saw the inside of your cell.

ANTHONY

(shrugs)

My head is full of them.  I try to get

them out any way I can.

JOHN

You need sleep.

ANTHONY

I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

RIPLEY

Stay with him.

JOHN

No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

JOHN

Doctor's orders.

JOHN

Besides, you see what happens when you

get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

RIPLEY

All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

JOHN

What do you mean?

RIPLEY

I've faced this evil twice before - I

guess I've gotten sensitive to it --

(beat)

You're really a Doctor?

JOHN

See my bag?

RIPLEY

What's that book?

JOHN

Just a book.

RIPLEY

I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who

says we can't leave the planet without

the library.

JOHN

It's just... a medical book I might need.

RIPLEY

You don't have any food in there, do you?

JOHN

Only if you can eat bandages.

RIPLEY

In a few hours that's going to sound

good.  Going in and out of suspended

animation - Christ I probably haven't

eaten in a year.

ANTHONY

(without opening eyes)

You should've eaten the bread.

RIPLEY AND JOHN

Rest!

JOHN

You all right?

RIPLEY

Aces.

JOHN

You weren't hurt when I landed on you?

Bruised a rib?

RIPLEY

Are you sure you're a doctor?

JOHN

Sort of.  My father passed on when we

first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -

Father Anselm - took me in.  He really

raised me --

(pause)

Taught me what he could before he

passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

RIPLEY

Well, I'm just hungry.

JOHN

You haven't eaten since I took you

out of your tube.

RIPLEY

You did that...

RIPLEY

You burned yourself on the escape pod.

RIPLEY

Thank you, I guess.

ANTHONY O/S

You should've eaten the bread.

ANTHONY

Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

JOHN

Blood.

(sniffs)

Mixed with sea water.

ANTHONY

We're getting close to the center of

the arc -- near the sea.

RIPLEY

Blood.

JOHN

Getting close...

RIPLEY

The Abbot.

JOHN

Father --

RIPLEY

(sarcastic)

What are you doing down here, father?

You look like you've seen something

that doesn't exist.

ABBOT

I was their spiritual leader.  I was not

prepared to lead them in battle.

Not against that thing.

JOHN

No one could be.

RIPLEY

I thought you said the evil was inside

me -- that sealing me up was the answer

to all your problems?

ABBOT

Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought

to us!

RIPLEY

I only tried to warn you.

ABBOT

What are you doing with this woman --?

JOHN

We are going to the Technology Room.

Trying to find some way to fight --

ABBOT

You don't join the devil to fight the

devil.

ANTHONY

She's helping us --

ABBOT

Look who defends the deceiver -- the one

who isn't even human.  John, can't you see

what is happening?  On ancient Earth,

during the Black Death - many believed

that God had abandoned them, so they

appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him

hoping to save their bodies - losing their

souls in the bargain.

RIPLEY

Father, we're all on the run from the

same monster so let's not resort to the

fire and brimstone routine.  I've been

enlightened about your "movement."

Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a

planet of heretics.

JOHN

Please.

ABBOT

All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet.

JOHN

Sir --?

ABBOT

I do what I have to do to keep the

Brotherhood together.  We all gave up

believing in Earth a long time ago.  How

do you think they would feel if told

their exiled was in vain?  That the

holocaust they were trying to avoid

never occured?  Those men up there have

grown to live with it.

RIPLEY

And with you as their leader.

ABBOT

You threatened the status quo.

RIPLEY

So you, protector of knowledge and truth,

lied to them.

ABBOT

Only about you.  The rest I still

believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun

there is no way it could have survived

being reduced to Barbarism.

RIPLEY

You're as bad as the Company.

JOHN

Ripley --

RIPLEY

That's why you ran.  After all your talk

death stared you in the face and you

were afraid.

ABBOT

Not afraid of death.

RIPLEY

The Alien.

ANTHONY

The Organism.

ABBOT

The Devil.

ABBOT

What was that?

ANTHONY

Man trap.

ANTHONY

In case anyone tried to get in and

tamper with the technology.

ABBOT

What do we do?

RIPLEY

Don't move.  Don't breath.

ABBOT

We can't just stand here and wait.

RIPLEY

Floor's too unstable to try to walk

around them.

ABBOT

John - what are you doing?

RIPLEY

He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:

Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.

(proud of him)

Good work, Father John.

JOHN

Brother.

RIPLEY

Brother.  Let's go.

JOHN

I just - are you allright?

RIPLEY

Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just

feel my age.

(smiles)

Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a

hundred.

JOHN

Hello?

JOHN

I think this is it.

ABBOT

Technology.

RIPLEY

Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

ABBOT

(to Ripley)

Go ahead.

RIPLEY

Go ahead and what?

ABBOT

Open the door, woman.

RIPLEY

I'll get to it, but listen to me --

you may dress like you're living in

the middle ages but you can't treat

me like your chambermaid, or whatever

Monks had.

ABBOT

OPEN IT!!

ABBOT

What's wrong?!

RIPLEY

Shit.

RIPLEY

It's open!!

ABBOT

Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

RIPLEY

We wait.  John!!

ABBOT

Hurry --

JOHN

HURRY!!

DISSOLVE TO:

RIPLEY

No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother

fucker!!

JOHN

I thought we'd lost you.

RIPLEY

What are you writing?

JOHN

Last will and testament.

(beat)

Just kidding.

RIPLEY

Is he --?

JOHN

Resting.

(shakes his head)

He'll be fine.

ANTHONY

No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

RIPLEY

I'm sorry.

ANTHONY

It's ironic.  I guess my visions were

prescience after all.  How will I ever

resolve that with my artifical con-

science?

ABBOT

Do you see what you've delivered us

into?

RIPLEY

Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to

kick your -- ahh --

RIPLEY

Oh shit.

RIPLEY

Where is the Big Boy -?

ABBOT

On the other side of that door.

Waiting for us to starve to death.

RIPLEY

It's playing with us.  It could get in

here any time it wants.

ABBOT

Why should he enter?  He knows that one

of the people in this room is in league

with him.

JOHN

Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so

to speak.

ABBOT

Maybe more than one of us.

RIPLEY

Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

RIPLEY

This is your technology?

ABBOT

Even this is forbidden to us.

RIPLEY

Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

RIPLEY

An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your

atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds

generated down here --

(looks at the floor)

Windmills use the natural surface winds

to turn wheels underground, create tides

on the seas to recirculate your water...

ANTHONY

More than that.  There are pumps beneath

the floor - I can feel their vibration.

RIPLEY

Probably pumping this air through charcoal

filters.

RIPLEY

It gets colder all the time here, right?

JOHN

Yes...

RIPLEY

Your wood burning fires throw soot into

the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -

cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the

planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

ANTHONY

The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth

almost destroyed itself in the late 20th

century.

RIPLEY

Don't you see?  This is a planet set to

self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two

hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is

finite.  If the plants die the fires will

eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid

will be dead - Everyone will die.

ABBOT

It's here.  I was just hoping I would be

dead long before it came to this.

JOHN

What?

ABBOT

We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

RIPLEY

Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

ABBOT

The punishment for our crime was death.

ANTHONY

This planet is the supreme triumph of

planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of

primitive materials with an atmosphere

processing system as fragile as a real

environment but not replenishable.

ABBOT

Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.

The Company's best work.  You know, I used

to be a corporate executive.  Middle range

V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.

I chucked it all and joined the order.

Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,

being chairman of the board...

RIPLEY

No, now I understand why I landed here.

To join you happy lunatics in your

deaths.

JOHN

Ripley, wait --

ABBOT

Where can she go?  She's trapped.

(beat)

Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison

in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.

Sparklets of light - dance with the june

RIPLEY

BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking

head!

ANTHONY

I didn't have to see that to know what

that means.

RIPLEY

He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.

I can't get away from him.  He's fucking

with my mind.  He's my punishment!

ANTHONY

I'm confused.  Before you said it came out

of the torso, not the head --

RIPLEY

I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

JOHN

Ripley, don't --

RIPLEY

I should just wait for the air to run out...

JOHN

I believe - I know - that we can win --

there is an answer in our books.

RIPLEY

Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.

Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts

to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if

they aren't already - are dead.

JOHN

If that's true, then all of us, the books,

are consigned to ashes.

ANTHONY O/S

Ripley?

RIPLEY

What?

ANTHONY

There are several inconsistancies between

this and the other Aliens you described.

RIPLEY

Give it up.

ANTHONY

I think this is important.  This may help

us fight it.  The creature that I fought

in the hall - when I first saw it, it had

camoflaged itself to look like wood.

RIPLEY

Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked

the way it did before -- black, mechanical --

unless that was a dream.

ANTHONY

I don't think it was.  I think that this

creature, if it is the efficient predator

that you say it is, has the ability to

adapt to its environment.

RIPLEY

Then the reason they've always looked the

same to me is that I only ever saw them in

the same environment.

ANTHONY

Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of

development -- you saw a queen -- This

could be like a King ant -- more highly

advanced than the drone, bred for

survival -?

JOHN

How does this explain the thing that came

out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

RIPLEY

Maybe it can deposit different types of

eggs.  The chest burster is probably

dormant until the host eats - The first

one I ever saw came out of Kane after he

started to eat --

RIPLEY

No.

JOHN

No what?

RIPLEY

No, we're not beat yet, Father --

JOHN

Brother --

RIPLEY

Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,

then maybe we can use that.  We can beat

this bastard.  We can get to my ship.

We can live.

CUT TO:

ANTHONY

Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and

crippled I would only slow you down.

Give him time to figure out what you're

doing.  Just leave me my staff.

RIPLEY

Okay.  Good luck.

ANTHONY

Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

RIPLEY

Sit tight.

RIPLEY

He could be waiting on the other side

of that door.  We might not get ten feet

before he kills the three of us.

JOHN

We had better go, then.

JOHN

Must be day on the surface of the planet.

RIPLEY

Where is the light coming from?

JOHN

Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down

great shafts -- through lenses.  That's

what they make in the glass factory.

Lenses.  Look --

JOHN

Opens to the surface.  Water flows in

and out.  I don't know how.  There's one

at either end.  I came down on the other

side.

RIPLEY

What do we do?

JOHN

We cross.

ANTHONY

Now the seer can only see what God wants

him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks

and I've finally found religion.

ANTHONY

John?  Ripley?

ANTHONY

Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

RIPLEY

Your hands okay?

JOHN

They'll be fine.  You've been on

a boat before.

RIPLEY

I was a warrant officer on a ship --

but I did all my sailing in space.

JOHN

Father Anselm used to take me on his

coracle when I was little.

RIPLEY

How old were you when they towed

this satellite out here?

JOHN

Five.  The Abbot said they put us to

sleep for the thirty years it took

to get here.  We've had almost forty

more.  Until now.

RIPLEY

What happened to your mother?

JOHN

Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.

I mean, I did, once.  She left my father

when he joined the movement.  If she

hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept

the other children with the women, on

Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like

a dream.

RIPLEY

Did you know that I was a mother?

JOHN

The girl in the ship with -?

RIPLEY

No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my

daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had

I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.

Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to

the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before

you know it I said.  My shares would have

set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years

floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks

to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,

70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little

girl who's mother never came home.

JOHN

Jesus Christ.

RIPLEY

They said I should have been happy to be

alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went

back the second time.  Not so I could

fight it -- You can't fight it -- So

I could let it kill me.

JOHN

You didn't choose to get lost in space.

RIPLEY

Thanks for the try Father --

JOHN

Brother.

RIPLEY

Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.

I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.

I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But

I can be a good mother to you.  I can make

sure you survive.

RIPLEY

Blood.

JOHN

From the levels above.

JOHN

He must have slaughtered all --

RIPLEY

Don't think about it.  Don't think about

what's up there.  Just row.

RIPLEY

Holy shit.

JOHN

There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

RIPLEY

Stop.  How far?

JOHN

We're right below the Abbey now.

JOHN

This is the glassworks.  They have

tools here --

(spots)

Kyle --

KYLE

(sotto)

Can't see my baby.

Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

JOHN

Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

KYLE

Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.

Black king on red queen, put the

ace up --

JOHN

Kyle goddammit!

RIPLEY

John - it's too late --

KYLE

Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.

Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-

boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma

looma --

JOHN

Keep singing, my friend.

JOHN

I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I

killed him.

RIPLEY

You had to.  You're supposed to end

suffering.

RIPLEY

Let's get the hell out of here.

RIPLEY

He's made a mess.

JOHN

No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I

did this.

JOHN

Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

JOHN

Mattias!

JOHN

He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My

dog.  Good fellow.

RIPLEY

I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably

only got a few minutes before this

entire place goes up in flames.  Just

grab whatever books you want and --

JOHN

Easy, boy...

RIPLEY

Is there another way out?

JOHN

Not that will do us any good.

JOHN

We hurt it.

RIPLEY

You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --

Where is my ship from here?

JOHN

On the roof directly above this room.

RIPLEY

Here's the plan --

JOHN

But the books --

RIPLEY

Forget the books!

RIPLEY

Shit.

JOHN

No!  THE BOOKS!!

RIPLEY

Don't --!

JOHN

Are you all right?

JOHN

Ripley -!

RIPLEY

Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck

out of --

JOHN

Ripley - the lever!!

JOHN

Saw that happen to a bottle once.

RIPLEY

(panting)

Beat... Beat him - ugh --

JOHN

We've got to get to the Library --

RIPLEY

Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

RIPLEY

Don't be stupid --

JOHN

Some of them!  I've got to save some of

them!  Mattias!!

RIPLEY

They're lost.  You did your best.  If

you get out, it wasn't in vain.

We've got to live!!

CUT TO:

RIPLEY O/S

Come on in!

JOHN

The Library --

RIPLEY

I told you -- the Earth is still there --

RIPLEY

Not working.

JOHN

What does that mean?

RIPLEY

It means I don't know how long I was

in hyper sleep.

JOHN

It means the Abbot could've been right --

RIPLEY

It means my clock isn't working.  We have

to get out of here.  Even if he was right

this ship's onboard computer is filled

with man's knowledge.

JOHN

Not everything.  Some things will be

lost forever.

RIPLEY

Then man starts over.  He's done it

before.

RIPLEY

Okay.  The seals weren't broken so

we're probably clear.  But those dead

monks out there are going to start

hatching soon.  Let's get ready to

take off.

JOHN

What can I do?

RIPLEY

Here, I need a compressor tank from

in that compartment.

JOHN

Hey!  What?!

JOHN

Hey - I'm locked in.

RIPLEY

I know.  I locked you in.

JOHN

What?

RIPLEY

I'm not going with you.  I've got one

inside me.

JOHN

What?!  You can't --

RIPLEY

I figured it out.  That's why it didn't

kill me.  He must have impregnated me

when I was in the stasis tube.

(remembers nightmare)

It hasn't come out yet because I

haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So

either I eat and it kills me or I don't

eat and I starve to death.  Either way

I die.

JOHN

My book -- I know what to do --

RIPLEY

What, an exorcism?  No good.

JOHN

You can't do this.  Ripley - listen

to me - you're confusing feeling of

guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

RIPLEY

(ignoring)

I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes

the Colony's gravitational pull this

compartment will open.  Then all you have

to do is get into the Stasis tube with

Mattias and press the blue button.  With

any luck a freighter or something will

pick you up.  Good luck.

JOHN

NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.

You can't let it win.

RIPLEY

It always wins.  We killed it, but it's

still inside me -- You're my last chance.

If I can keep you alive it'll make up

for all those I've lost.

JOHN

Listen to me!  You have to let me try!

Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

JOHN

I told you Father Anselm raised me.

He raised me and when he was dying I

couldn't do anything to save him.  I

didn't know enough.  It was my fault

he died.  If you don't let me try to

save you my body will live but my soul

will be dead.

JOHN

Please.

CUT TO:

RIPLEY

What is this stuff?

JOHN

(forceful)

Something that will make you well.

Something that will make you sick.

RIPLEY

I don't --

JOHN

Shut up and drink.

RIPLEY

Why?

JOHN

Choking.  It was the only way.

JOHN

They knew.

RIPLEY

But you --

RIPLEY

You'll die --

JOHN

That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If

we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --

either way, where we belong.  World of

books.  Pages.

JOHN

You... are from the real world.

JOHN

Stay -- both of you.

RIPLEY

No - wait!  John!

JOHN V.O.

I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter

Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know

the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great

evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to

paper now lest this plague - this creature

stills my hand.  I have gone down below -

both to try to warn the others and get

the woman - Ripley - get from her some

clue as to how to battle this evil, or

at least to make my peace for not

defending her.  She believes there is

still and Earth and I hope she is right.

I hope she will be able to find out.

I hope she can find some rest for the

devils that torment her.
