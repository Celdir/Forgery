Shooting Script:  White August 28, 1997

MONSIGNOR

(dismissing young

priest)

Thank you Father Macklepenny, for

coming all the way across town to be

our guest speaker today. I hope you

found our little parish to your

liking.

ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.)

(thick Irish accent)

They've never been like anyone else.

From the moment they were born, of

the same womb, on the same day, they

just had their own way, my boys did.

And I always knew that one day they

would do something of true greatness.

I just never expected they would

bring about such a... such a

reckoning.

MONSIGNOR

(loud, authoritative)

...and I am reminded of this holy

day of the sad story of Kitty

Geneviese. This poor soul cried out

time and time again for help but no

person answered her calls. Though

many saw, not one so much as called.

Her assailant wiped the bloody knife

off on her lifeless little body.

They watched as he simply walked

away. Nobody wanted to get involved.

Nobody wanted to take a stand... We

must fear evil men and deal with

them accordingly but what we must

truly guard against, what we must

fear most

(beat)

Is the indifference of good men.

CONNOR

(Irish accent)

I do believe the Monsignor finally

got a point.

MURPHY

(Irish accent)

Aye.

CONNOR

What?

MCGERKIN

Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle...

Gurtle.

ROZ

Rozengurtle Baumgartner.

MCGERKIN

You'll be training her today, and do

a good job.

BOTH BOYS

Aye.

CONNOR

(wipes hand and extends

it)

Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.

ROZ

I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by

men.

CONNOR

(taken aback)

Okay then... let's get ya started.

MURPHY

Christ, that's the largest woman

I've ever seen.

MCGERKIN

It's self-imposed affirmative action.

If we hire big, fat, angry lesbians,

then the leftist groups representing

big, fat angry lesbians, won't think

we're violating their rights.

MURPHY

Well, how politically correct you

are. That's good stuff.

MCGERKIN

Hey, those people can shut ya down.

They'll sue you into the ground

claiming they were put under mental

duress, inner pain. and sufferin'.

MURPHY

Well, as long as we're hirin' fat

lesbians, give your ma a call.

MCGERKIN

Fuck you Murphy.

CONNOR

Okay, just cut off as much fat as

you can as it goes by and the rule

of thumb here is...

ROZ

Rule of thumb?

CONNOR

(questioningly)

Yeah?

ROZ

Do you know where that term comes

from? In the early 1900's it was

legal for men to beat their wives as

long as they used a stick no wider

than their thumb.

CONNOR

Can't do much damage with that.

Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of

wrist. Ha!

(he elbows her)

Rule of wrist.

CONNOR

Hey Murphy?

MURPHY

Aye.

CONNOR

(slight smirk)

How many feminists does it take to

screw in a light bulb?

MURPHY

How many?

CONNOR

Two. One ta screw it in and one ta

suck my cock.

ROZ

(angry)

I knew you two pricks would give me

problems. Give me shit cause I'm a

woman. I'm not gonna take your male

dominance bullshit!

CONNOR

(trying to calm her,

but still chuckling)

Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was

just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.

MURPHY

Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice

is all.

ROZ

(to Murphy)

Fuck you...

(to Connor)

...and fuck you!

MURPHY

Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day.

It's all in good fun.

ROZ (V.O.)

Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck

face?

CONNOR

Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry.

Just relax.

CONNOR

Why don't you save all your aggression

for protests and marches and what

not.

ROZ

You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the

needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck

up! Leave him there.

MURPHY

Guess you'll have ta change that

tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!?

CONNOR

Fuck you.

CONNOR

Hello.

MOM (V.O.)

Connor, is that you?

CONNOR

(interested)

Mother, is that you?

MOM (V.O.)

Is that worthless brother of your

there? I want you both ta hear this.

CONNOR

Ma, what's wrong?

MURPHY

No fuckin' hot water man. That...

CONNOR

Shut it. It's Ma.

MOM (V.O.)

It's all your fault. Both you little

bastards. I was a fool to believe

you would bring me any peace. The

day your Da left us when you were

almost too young to remember, he

said the two of you would do me right

and make me proud, but he was wrong

and I got nothin' ta live for.

CONNOR

Mother, what are you sayin'? You're

talkin' crazy here.

MURPHY

What's the matter with her?

MOM

I finally found your Da's army

revolver, Connor.

CONNOR

What the hell are you doin' with

Da's gun!?

MURPHY

(widening eyes)

What the...?

MOM (V.O.)

I got it ta my head now.

I got it ta my head now.

CONNOR

What?! What are you doin'?

MOM (V.O.)

I want ta tell ya one last thing

before I pull the trigger.

CONNOR

(screaming)

Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it

woman?! Now just calm down here.

MURPHY

(eyes widen)

Oh my god!

MOM (V.O.)

I...

CONNOR

No ma! No!

MOM (V.O.)

BLAME...

CONNOR & MURPHY

Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma!

MOM (V.O.)

YOU...!

CONNOR

(grabs his balls,

rolls over)

Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!

MURPHY

Lord have mercy. That was a good one

ma.

MOM (V.O.)

Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No!

MURPHY

(to Connor)

Oh, she's quite proud of herself.

MOM

Okay, seriously, both you listen ta

me now.

CONNOR

All right, we're both here.

MOM

(finally)

It's only 11:00 here boys so I got

lot's more drinkin' ta do with your

worthless relatives down at the Anvil.

MURPHY

Just called ta torture us did ya?

CONNOR

How's Uncle Sibeal?

MOM

Well, you know how it is with him.

Always complainin' he's never turnin'

a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn

family goes down there with no money,

cause we know he can't bear ta charge

us.

MOM

But he's been havin' himself a nip

or two as well... Been up the

waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.

MURPHY

Well you tell him ta take it easy

with that. He's gotta learn ta respect

women the way Connor does.

CONNOR

Oh, Jesus.

MURPHY

I gave him his first lesson in

sensitivity toward the fairer sex

just today.

CONNOR

Don't even do it, ya bastard.

MURPHY

(laughs)

He got beat up by a girl.

CONNOR

If that was a girl I want ta see

some papers. She had ta be just

preoperative for Christ sakes.

MOM

(dogmatically)

Lord's name.

BOTH

(genuflecting,

impassionate)

Mother Mary, full of grace.

MOM

What did you do, Connor?

CONNOR

Well, we tried ta make friends and

she gave me a shot ta the nuts.

MOM

(aghast)

What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya

trounced her a good one!

CONNOR

Well, I didn't but...

MURPHY

(shaking his fist)

Don't worry, I respected the hell

out of her for ya, Ma.

MOM

Well listen, I know how my boys take

ta scrappin' when they take ta

drinkin'.

BOTH

(semi-condescending)

Yes mother.

MOM

(light-hearted anger)

I mean it now. I carried the two of

you little bastards around in my

belly at the same time you ungrateful

pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure

in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked

me dry.

(grabbing her breast)

My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles.

I trip over em for Christ sakes, now

ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!

MOM

Promise me boys.

MURPHY

We promise.

CONNOR

Yeah, we promise.

MOM

Well, there's my boys.

(pulls back curtain,

looks out window)

Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused

a ruckus with that shot. Half the

damn neighborhood is comin'.

MURPHY

All right, love ya ma. Listen, before

ya go just give us the goods, eh?

CONNOR

Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.

MOM

Still bickerin' over that, huh?

CONNOR

Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came

out first?

MOM

All right, I suppose you have the

right ta know.

MOM

Are ya ready?

BOTH

Aye.

MOM

(yells)

The one with the biggest cock!

CONNOR

Crazy woman.

CONNOR

Don't start. I've had ice on mine.

GREENLY

(thick Boston accent)

...so these guys are just kickin'

the shit out of each other. This guy

(points to Vladdy)

Picks up an old kitchen sink that

some one threw out and crushes this

guy

(Checkov)

With it. All right, so it makes a

big bang and alerts their friend,

who's standin' look out around the

corner. So he comes over and gets

into it with this guy,

(Vladdy)

He's angry at him, right? They get

into an altercation in which the

look out guy crushes this guy by

jumpin on him. And look at the damage

here.

(Vladdy)

I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger

man. His spine is crushed. He's all

twisted and shit. That guy had to be

one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400

pounds, fuckin huge.

GREELY

Or, okay. Check this out. Say these

two don't even know the huge guy.

They're just staggerin' home from a

bar this morning, still all fucked

up from St. Patty's last night. So

they figure they'll take a short cut

down the alley and this big mother

fucker, he's just waitin'. And what

could be more perfect for strong arm

robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged

up. They're already injured for Christ

sakes. He takes a blunt object and

whacks the guy with the bandage on

his head, right? Cause he's smart.

He knows the guy with the bandage on

his ass, he ain't going nowhere.

Matter of fact, this guy's probably

helping his friend with the rectal

problem along. They're limping around

like a couple of decrepit old broads.

So once this guy's out of the picture

(denotes Vladdy)

this poor asshole, he tries to run.

But look how far he gets fore the

huge bastard catches up with him.

Only a few yards. And what does he

do? He gets creative. He picks up a

sink and crushes the poor mother-

fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He

comes over here, jumps on this guy's

back and crushes him to death.

(Vladdy)

He steals their shit and beats it!

Thanks for comin' out!

(beat)

And look at this print...

GREENLY

That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and

think about it. Of all the ways to

kill a guy, crushin' him to death.

That's very particular. You don't

get many of those. I dunno. I feel

something big here. I wouldn't be

surprised if we see more of these

turning up.

SMECKER

(stepping into the

open)

Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy

theory and Serial crusher theory.

Top fucking notch.

(to Greenly)

What's your name?

GREENLY

Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are

you?

SMECKER

That's who the fuck I am.

CHIEF

Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on

this one. I.D. just came back on

these guys. They've got connections

to the Russian mob. That makes it a

federal matter and Agent Smecker,

here, is heading up the investigation

with our full cooperation.

SMECKER

(transfixed on Greely)

Why don't you get me a cup of coffee.

GREENY

What the fuck?

SMECKER

Cafe latte.

GREENLY

Who the...

SMECKER

Twist of lemon!

GREENLY

(to Chief)

Chief, what the fuck is this?

SMECKER

Sweet-n-low!

SMECKER

(loudly)

Mitchell, Langley!

MITCHELL

Yes sir.

SMECKER

Find the manager of this building.

See if he has had any complaints of

water coming down in any apartments,

starting just this morning. If he's

not there, knock on every door

starting from the third floor up.

Langley, you take this building,

same thing.

SMECKER

Chaffey, Newman.

CHAFFEY

Yes sir.

SMECKER

(to Chaffey)

Look in the trash around their hands.

See if you can find me two bullet

casings. 45's, if my eye serves me

right. Don't disturb them. Mark them

as they lay. Newman, root through

this shit.

(points to the mountain

of garbage)

If this was a sink find me some metal

parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain

cover or something.

CHAFFEY

Got it. It's a 45.

SMECKER

Chief, could you get ballistics down

here and tell them they have to dig

a 45 slug out of a brick wall.

SMECKER

...and locate another that's been

fired through a dumpster.

CHIEF

I got the best ballistics guy in the

world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff

right in the van. Can have him down

here in 10 minutes.

DOLLY

How did you know that?

SMECKER

Paraffin came up positive. And bullet

holes are usually a big clue.

CHAFFEY

I can't find the second one, sir.

SMECKER

Look under the body.

CHAFFEY

(obeys)

Got it.

SMECKER

You guy's ready for this?

SMECKER

This was no gangland assassination.

Though creative, it was way too

sloppy. Something went wrong here.

This has personal written all over

it. Now, these men were crushed and

the first natural reaction the body

has to such trauma is to tense up.

So now the two shots fired here were

reflex rounds. These guys weren't

shooting at anything, but they were

just about to.

MITCHELL

Agent Smecker,

(pointing to MacManus

building)

This is all illegal loft housing so

there's no manager on the premises

but I found a lady on the fourth

floor said she's had water dripping

down on her whole place. Started

just this morning.

SMECKER

Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading

to the fifth. Let's go up and see

just how right I am.

DUFFY

So what are you thinkin' here?

SMECKER

Really want to know?

GREENLY

No way. You know how big a guy's

gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

SMECKER

(beat)

Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel

with my coffee.

GREENLY

(to Dolly)

I ain't getting him no fuckin' bagel.

SMECKER

(to Greenly)

We'll start the ass kissing with

you.

MITCHELL

(approaches Smecker)

Agent Smecker. I know this

neighborhood pretty good. There's a

bar called McGinty's down the block.

It's a good bet they were there last

night.

SMECKER

(turns to detectives)

Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that

out myself.

REPORTER

Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened

here? You owe me. This is the one I

want.

DUFFY

Let's go get a cup of coffee. You

ain't gonna fuckin' believe this

one.

SMECKER

I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more

uniforms on the streets. One thing's

for sure, wherever these guys are

they're hurting.

MURPHY

Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy.

He'll have his day. He'll have his

(turns)

FUCKIN' DAY!

MURPHY

Thanks for comin', Doc.

DOC

(Irish accent, squeaky

voice)

J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are

ya b-boys all right?

CONNOR

We're alive.

DOC

An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He

left me his c-c, he left me his c-c,

he left me this.

DOC

(extremely loud)

Fuck!..........Ass!

DOC

What are you going to do?

CONNOR

We're going to turn ourselves in. It

was self defense.

DOC

y-y-yeah that's what he said.

MURPHY

How the fuck's he know that? We

haven't spoken to anyone yet.

DOC

Don't know. He didn't say.

MURPHY

Listen Doc, we need a favor.

DOC

A-anything.

CONNOR

Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be

comin back for it when we get out.

DOC

Right.

SMECKER

First of all, I'd like to thank

whichever one of you donut munching,

barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this

to the press. That's just what we

need now, some sensational story in

the papers making these guys out to

be super heroes, triumphing over

evil. And let me squash the rumors

now. These two aren't heroes.

(rolls his eyes)

They are two ordinary men who were

put in an extraordinary situation

and they just happened to come out

on top. Yes, nothing from our far

reaching computer system has turned

up jack shit on these two. All we

know is what we found out from their

neighbors. And the general consensus

is that they're... angels.

(pause)

But angels don't kill and we got two

bodies in the morgue that look like

they've been...

SMECKER

...serial crushed by a huge fuckin'

guy.

CHAFFEY

Are these me considered armed and

dangerous?

SMECKER

Well, not armed. If they had guns,

they'd have used them. But dangerous?

Oh yeah.

MITCHELL

What makes you think they're

dangerous? They were just protecting

each other.

SMECKER

Look, look! I'm not saying one way

or the other. Just be careful and go

by the protocol on this one.

CHAFFEY

Any tips on where these guys may be?

SMECKER

(to Officer Mitchell)

Any word back from the E.R.s?

MITCHELL

No help at all. Swamped from St.

Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody

Irish.

SMECKER

Just hit the bricks nice and hard.

GREENLY

(talking loudly)

These guys are miles away by now.

GREENLY

But if you want to beat your head

against a wall, then here's what you

look for. These guys are scared like

two little bunny rabbits. Anything

in a uniform or flashing blue lights

will spook them. So the only thing

we can do is put a potato on a string

and drag it through South Boston.

MURPHY

(loud)

You'd probably have better luck with

a beer.

SMECKER

What the fuck is this!? This isn't a

fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only

thing I want in here is them.

SMECKER

This conversation is going to be

recorded. Just answer to the best of

your knowledge.

MURPHY

(politely)

Excuse me, sir.

MURPHY

"What do we tell him about the guns

and money?"

CONNOR

"We just got up and left. Bum musta

rolled them before the police got

there."

MURPHY

(to Smecker)

Okay. We're ready.

SMECKER

You guys are not under oath, here. I

am assuming you knew these two guys

from before, huh?

CONNOR

We... met them last night.

SMECKER

They had some pretty interesting

bandages. Know anything about that?

CONNOR

(presently, imitating

Doc's voice)

Would someone please come over here

and...

DOC

Fuck!

CONNOR

me up the...

DOC

Ass!

ROCCO

Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer!

ROCCO

(trying to connect

with Connor)

...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm

just afraid of faggots.

DOC

I got some bad news. Looks like I'm

gonna have ta close d-down the bar.

The Russians have been buying up

buildings all over town, including

this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're

not letting me renew my lease. I got

'til the end of the week to come up

with 26,000 dollars, or they take

the place. I left them a note telling

them not to show their faces t-

tonight. They been pressuring me ta

close and take the last few days ta

get all my shit outta here but it's

my right to stay open ta the last.

ROCCO

Let me talk to my boss, may I can...

DOC

L-l-listen I don't want anyone ta

know until the last possible moment.

So you guys keep your traps shut. ya

know what they say; People in glass

houses sink ships.

ROCCO

Y'know Doc, I gotta get you a, a,

like a proverb book or something.

This mix and match shit's gotta go.

DOC

What?

CONNOR

(imitating Doc)

A p-penny saved is worth two in the

bush.

MURPHY

(imitating Doc)

Don't c-cross the road if ya can't

get out of the kitchen.

CHECKOV

(thick Russian accent)

I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing

now.

MURPHY

(after a long pause)

This is McCoy... we find Spock and

we got enough for an away team.

CHECKOV

Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of

Irishmen... and they are being drunken

idiots. You are killing the

stereotype. I'm in no mood for

discussion.

(points to Doc)

You! You stay. The rest of you go

now.

DOC

Why don't you make like a tree and

get the fuck outta here!

CONNOR

Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're

reasonable fellows.

CONNOR

Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til

this week's end. Ya don't have ta be

hard asses, do ya?

MURPHY

Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's

Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya

pull up a stool and have a drink

with us?

CHECKOV

You insult me. I would never drink

that sewage. Especially with you

people. You are fools.

CHECKOV

This is no game! If you won't go, we

will make you go!

CONNOR

If ya want a fight, you can see you're

outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil

here, so I suggest you take our offer.

CHECKOV

I make the offers, ass-hole.

ROCCO

(standing between the

two brothers)

Hey, there Boris. What would you say

if I told you that your pinko, commie

mother sucked so much dick...

CONNOR

"Now, that wasn't too polite, was

it?"

MURPHY

"I'm afraid we can't let that one

go, Ivan."

CONNOR

I don't think Ma would mind.

CONNOR

Let the boy go. He knows what the

fuck he's doing!

CONNOR

Nicely done, boy!

CONNOR

Now, like my fine brother says, on

St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And

this piece of shit is about to be

initiated.

FRIEND #1

Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck?

CHECKOV

(almost whispering)

I was going to kill you. But I'm

not... I'm going to kill your brother.

I'm going to take him down to the

dumpster and I'm going to shoot him

in the head. Then I'm going to throw

his dead body in the garbage.

(looks at this watch)

Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes,

gotta go.

MURPHY

It was just a bar fight. You guys

are fuckin' pussies!

CHECKOV

I hope your conscience is clear,

Irishman.

SMECKER

(gathering himself)

So, how is it that you guys are fluent

in Russian?

CONNOR

We paid attention in school.

SMECKER

Know any other languages?

MURPHY

Aye. Our mother insisted on it.

French.

MURPHY

(subtitled)

How do you think he figured all this

out without talking to us?

CONNOR

Italian.

CONNOR

(subtitled)

I have no idea. Maybe someone saw

and talked.

MURPHY

German.

(subtitled)

Not in our neighborhood, man. A

hundred percent Irish. No one talks

to cops. Period.

CONNOR

Spanish.

(subtitled)

Then I guess he's just real... real

good.

SMECKER

What are you guys doing working at a

fucking meat packing plant?

CHAFFEY

Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

SMECKER

What?

CHAFFEY

The press is everywhere outside.

They're going nuts for these guys.

What do you want to do?

SMECKER

You're not being charged. It's up to

you. Do you want to talk to them?

CONNOR

Absolutely not.

MURPHY

No pictures, either.

SMECKER

Well, we could try the bag over the

head thing. Walk you right out the

front.

CONNOR

Our mother can see through bags.

MURPHY

Aye, she can.

(beat)

Any way we can stay here?

CHAFFEY

Sure, we have an empty holding cell,

They can... can they stay?

SMECKER

Well, we'll have to check with your

mother, but it's ok with me if your

friends sleep over.

SMECKER

Time to feed the dogs.

CONNOR

He's a nice guy.

MURPHY

Yes... he is.

CHIEF

This is our official statement. The

MacManus brothers are not being

charged with a crime. It was a clean-

cut case of self defense. We have

thanked them for their cooperation

and we thank you, the media, for

your tireless pursuit of the truth.

CONNOR

Destroy all that which is evil...

MURPHY

...so that which is good may flourish

CONNOR

Be right back...

DUFFY

We would be honored, sir, if you

would join us peasants, in a donut.

MURPHY

Saints?

(beat)

I will not accept this pizzle until

my feet have been properly anointed.

VINCENZO

(hushed)

Well, it's the funny man. Give it

here, package boy.

ROCCO

(a bit defiant)

Joey Bevo said it was important.

Said I had to give it to him myself.

VINCENZO

(snatching the package)

Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the

fuck down!

VINCENZO

(hushed)

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee

Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.

ROCCO

Fuck you Vincenzo.

VINCENZO

(hushed)

Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.

ROCCO

I caught your show down at the velvet

room at the Holiday Inn, loved it

when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.

ROCCO

Hey, hey, hey...

YAKAVETTA

Fuck you! I could snap my fingers

and have you dead in four hours,

rotting in a truck off of Boyleston!

You insignificant little fuck! I

always get my fuckin' money!

YAKAVETTA

Fuckin' 90's are killin' me. I

shouldn't a done that. You're not

supposed to tell a guy you're gonna

kill him anymore. I gotta tip-toe

through the tulips with these

assholes. I prance. I'm a prancer.

It's what I do... sucked all the fun

right out of this job.

ROCCO

Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?

YAKAVETTA

Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

YAKAVETTA

Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.

ROCCO

Yeah boss?

YAKAVETTA

I always see you talking to the boys

and making them laugh. They always

come around telling me what a crack

up you are. What is it they call

you?

ROCCO

(totally intimidated)

The... The funny man.

YAKAVETTA

The funny man. Well, I got a new job

for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having

a real shitty day. I'm depressed.

Tell me a funny story or a joke.

ROCCO

(terrified)

Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one

about the, no fuck that one... uh...

oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's

a white guy. He's walkin' along the

beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know

and ah, he rubs it and this genie

pops out. But this genie, he's a

ni... he's a black guy.

YAKAVETTA

He's a nigger.

ROCCO

Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He

says, "Why you crackers always gotta

find my mother fuckin' pot? And he

tells him he's gonna grant all his

three wishes but he's gonna give all

the black guys...

VINCENZO AND YAKAVETTA

Niggers!

ROCCO

Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the

planet get double what he wishes

for. "I'll take a million dollars,"

he says. Genie give it to him and

says every nigger on earth just got

two million. "I don't care gimme a

yacht." Poof there it is.

(intimidated, losing

steam)

E-every bl... every nigger just got

two yachts. Genie goes...

(gives up)

I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This

joke sucks.

YAKAVETTA

Continue the joke.

ROCCO

(deflated)

He says, "What's your third wish?"

And the guys says, "I-I want you to

beat me half to death."

YAKAVETTA

(still in guffaw)

Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good

stuff. Tell me another one.

CONNOR

Know what we need, man?... some rope.

MURPHY

For what?

CONNOR

Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

MURPHY

What?

CONNOR

Yeah, these guys always got a lot of

rope strapped around em in the movies

and they always end up using it.

MURPHY

Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?

CONNOR

I'm serious.

MURPHY

Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing

we're gonna need it for.

CONNOR

I don't know they just always need

it.

MURPHY

What is all this "they" shit? This

ain't a movie.

CONNOR

Is that right, Rambo?

MURPHY

All right, get the stupid fuckin'

rope.

SMECKER

Uh,huh.

(pause)

Room number.

SMECKER

We got a time of death?

SMECKER

(sighs)

What's the body count?

SMECKER

Uh, huh.

SMECKER

I'll be down there in a bit. Keep

the press out.

SMECKER

What are you doing?

REUBEN

(beat)

I was just trying to cuddle.

SMECKER

Cuddle?...

(yelling)

What a fag!

SMECKER

(intrigued)

He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?

GREENLY

Why do you always disrespect me like

that?

SMECKER

Respect is earned, Greenly, never

given. Guys like you should have to

follow me around squabbling for the

scraps from my table.

SMECKER

How many bodies, Greenly?

GREENLY

(still Dejected)

Eight.

GREENLY

(catching himself)

No! Shit! I didn't see that one.

Nine! Nine!

SMECKER

While Greenly's getting coffee,

anybody else want anything?

GREENLY

(as he walks to the

door)

Shit! Shit!

SMECKER

So Duffy, got any theories to go

with that... tie.

DUFFY

(looks down)

These guys were pros. I think they

were coming for one target, the fag

man, he was the...

SMECKER

The what man?

DUFFY

(surprised)

The fat man.

SMECKER

Well, Freud was right. So you think

they came for the fag man, huh? And

what do you base this upon?

DUFFY

He was the only one done right. Two

in the back of the head.

SMECKER

And the pennies?

DUFFY

New hitman wants to leave his mark

SMECKER

That's a possibility. Y'know you

Boston cops are perking up. That's

two sound theories in one day, neither

of which deal with abnormally sized

men.

(pause)

Another possibility is that they

were placed there with religious

intent.

DUFFY

Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies

in the eyes of the dead, or silver.

SMECKER

The Greeks. The Italians.

DUFFY

The Sicilians.

DOLLY

What's the symbology there?

SMECKER

Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has

relinquished his King Bone Head crown

I see we have an heir to the throne.

I'm sure the word you were looking

for was symbolism. What's the

symbolism there? Let me explain it

to you. In Greek and Roman mythology

when you died you would have to pay

the toll to Charon, the boatman who

ferried you across to the gates of

judgment. This made sure the dead

came to atone for what they did during

their lives, Detective...

SMECKER

Dollapoppaskalious.

DOLLY (DOLLAPOPPASKALIOUS)

Holy shit. You're the first one that's

ever got that.

SMECKER

(aside)

Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name-

ology.

SMECKER

I've seen burns like these before.

They used silencers. Look at these

entry and exit wounds. They're

identical.

SMECKER

The two bullets went in here, through

the top of the skull, criss-crossed

and exited through the eyeballs.

This one clue tells us three distinct

facts. Number one... Duffy.

DUFFY

They shot him at a downward angle.

(makes connection)

They put him on his knees.

SMECKER

Excellent! Number two. Greenly.

GREENLY

Uh.

(thinking hard)

Shit, I, uh...

SMECKER

It tells us that he was the last to

die. All these men

(fans across the

corpses with his

hand)

Were carrying. They came in, dropped

all in seconds and then took their

time with fag man. Didn't they,

Duffy?!

(psychotic laugh)

They sure as fuck did!

SMECKER

And number three, Dolly.

DOLLY

Uh... two shooters!

SMECKER

Fan-fuckin-tastic!

SMECKER

Now stay with me, boys. What did

they do to make two such identical

wounds? Did one guy put him on his

knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up

and shoot him again the same way?

No. Two men of similar height dropped

this guy down, each put some iron to

his head and boom! That's all she

fuckin' wrote!

DUFFY

What about one guy with two guns?

SMECKER

Possible, but unlikely. The angles

are too extreme. A guy holding two

guns to the back of your head is

gonna shoot straight ahead. He

wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes

no sense. Besides, you telling me

one guy came in here and killed eight

men with eight extremely well aimed

shots in just a few seconds? No way.

Had to be at least two.

SMECKER

Television,... television is the

explanation for this.

SMECKER

You see this is bad television.

(again pointing out

the hole in the

ceiling)

The little assault guys creeping in

through the vents and coming in

through the ceilings. That James

Bond shit never happens in real life.

Professionals don't do that. So we've

got this up here, which has novice

written all over it. And all this

down here that's simply a perfect

textbook assassination. So here's

our two possibilities. We either

have rank amateurs that got lucky or

consummate professionals that fucked

up.

SMECKER

Join me in a drink, gentlemen.

SMECKER

With the exception of my coffee boy,

you Boston detectives are starting

to show signs of intelligence. So, I

am going to make you privy to some

information that you would not

normally be. These men are all Russian

mob. Not like those two peons in the

alley the other day. These guys are

all syndicate bosses and underbosses.

I have a dossier on every man in

this room. Since the Iron Curtain

has gone down, the Russian syndicates

have started to come here. And in

the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets

have opened their borders to the

mafia. But the Italians, they're not

convinced that the grounds in mother

Russia are fertile enough for

organized crime yet. So they ain't

ready to commit. The Russians are

coming here anyway. They are

unwelcome. What we have here,

gentlemen, is possibly the beginning

of the first international mob war...

unless I've totally missed something.

SMECKER

Now, what is this going to look like

to those who do not know what I just

told you?

DUFFY

It's gonna look like the bad guys

are killing each other.

SMECKER

And is there an American, shit is

there a man seated among us that

hasn't thought about it many times,

let's just put them all on an island,

give them guns and let them kill

each other. This is our wet dream

come true. You can expect federal

and local law enforcement to go only

deep enough to satisfy the law, then

bury it from here on out.

DOLLY

So, what do we do now?

SMECKER

That depends. You either do your job

or get ethical.

ROCCO

This better be good.

(viciously ties his

hair back)

Talk!

MURPHY

Nervous?

CONNOR

A bit.

MURPHY

Me, too.

MURPHY

You and your fucking rope.

CONNOR

(smiling)

See. I told you there'd be a shaft.

MURPHY

(smiling)

Just like on TV.

MURPHY

Where the fuck are you going?

CONNOR

We'll find it. Just calm down.

MURPHY

No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit.

I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'

this stupid thing around. Must weigh

30 pounds.

CONNOR

We're doing some serious shit here.

Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.

MURPHY

Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin'

Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's

getting' us lost!

CONNOR

Sh, sh! Fuck you!

MURPHY

No, fuck you!

BOTH

And shepherds we shall be. For thee,

my Lord, for thee. Power hath

descended forth from thy hand that

our feet may swiftly carry out thy

command. So we shall flow a river

forth to thee and teeming with souls

shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et

Fili e spiritu sancti.

CONNOR

(looks up)

That was some good fuckin' rope.

MURPHY

That was way easier than I thought.

CONNOR

Aye.

MURPHY

On TV ya always get that asshole

that jumps behind the couch.

CONNOR

Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for

ten minutes.

MURPHY

Oh, we're good man.

CONNOR

Yes, we are.

MURPHY

I love our new job.

ROCCO

Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the

same side! The boss musta sent you

in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please!

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.

(almost crying)

They call me the funny fuckin' man!

CONNOR

(attempting to hide

accent)

Where's your gun?

ROCCO

Chest pocket.

(they take it)

Shit!

CONNOR

This is a six-shooter.

MURPHY

(hiding accent)

Nine bodies.

CONNOR

Oh, you're good. What were you gonna

do? Laugh the last three to death,

funny man?

ROCCO

Poppa Joe said there was only two.

In and out.

(trying to make friends)

Boy, you guys sure did a good job.

You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd

you get them?

CONNOR

Let's do him right here.

MURPHY

Right now.

ROCCO

(screaming like a

baby)

Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no.

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the

funny man... the funny.

ROCCO

What did you do?! Fuckin'... what

the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked

this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two

fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!

CONNOR

Certainly illustrates the diversity

of the word.

ROCCO

What the fuck are you doing here?

What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS!

I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

CONNOR

(slaps his face)

Get a hold of yourself, man.

MURPHY

Yeah, get a hold of yourself.

CONNOR

Listen, we gotta get outta here now.

We'll take separate exits and meet

at Rocco's.

ROCCO

Fuck!

ROCCO

Anybody you think is evil?

CONNOR

Yes.

ROCCO

Don't you think that's a little

psycho? A little weird?

CONNOR

Weird, huh?... Know what I think is

weird? Decent men with loving families

go home every day after work. They

turn on the news and see rapists,

murderers, and child molesters all

getting out of prison.

MURPHY

Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos

and walkin' on bail the same day.

CONNOR

Little girls catchin' stray bullets

in their heads, playin' hopscotch in

their front yards. And everyone thinks

the same thing... Someone should

just go kill those motherfuckers.

MURPHY

Kill em all. Admit it, even you've

thought about it.

ROCCO

You guys should be in every major

city.

ROCCO

This is some heavy shit. This is

like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it!

There's so much shit that pisses me

off. You guys should recruit 'cause

I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin'

down the street waitin' for one of

these assholes to get me, y'know?

MURPHY

(chuckling)

Hallelujah, Jaffar.

ROCCO

So you're not just talkin' mob guys.

You're talkin' anyone, right? Even

like pimps and drug dealers and all

that shit?

ROCCO

Well fuck, you guys could do this

every day.

MURPHY

We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always

doing business, but we're always

open.

CONNOR

Nicely put.

ROCCO

You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm

fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.

MURPHY

Who says that? You could take credit

on it.

ROCCO

What are you serious?

MURPHY

Yeah, fuck it. If you think about

it, it's all you can do really. You

can't tell him it was us. Go in

braggin' and shit.

CONNOR

Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don

Rocco.

ROCCO

Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it.

I've been working for those fat

bastards since I was in high school

and look at this place.

ROCCO

(working into a frenzy)

They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they

can suck my pathetic little dick.

And I'll dip my nuts in marinara

just so the fat fucks can get a taste

of home while they're at it. That's

it, it's done, I'm doing it.

MURPHY

I can't fuckin' believe that just

happened!

CONNOR

(hung over)

Donna's gonna be angry about her

cat.

ROCCO

Shit. She's on every drug know to

man. She'd have sold that thing for

a dime bag. Screw her.

(beat)

But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.

CONNOR

(chuckles)

You sound real remorseful.

ROCCO

She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

CONNOR

(beat)

Listen. Something's been bothering

me about last night.

ROCCO

What?

CONNOR

Well... what if your boss knew how

many guys were supposed to be there...

in that room?

ROCCO

What are you saying?

CONNOR

Think about it man. Nine men, six

bullets.

ROCCO

You think they sold me out? No way.

CONNOR

He probably knew you'd end up nailing

the fat guy, maybe one or two more,

but he had to know you weren't walking

out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's

dead on the scene. No in-depth

investigation. It'd slide right off

his back. 'Cause as much as I love

ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone.

What would he be losing? A thirty-

five year old delivery boy?

ROCCO

No, no. That's just not the way things

are done. Besides, how's he know I

don't just get in there see there's

too many and just serve em their

fuckin' food and beat it?

CONNOR

He knows you, man. He knows all you

want is to move up. That's all. A

smooth hitter woulda gone in there,

seen it was a wash and slipped out.

But a guy like you? Knowin' this is

your only chance? Waitin' eighteen

years?

ROCCO

No. No man. That's... that's... you

don't know what you're talking about.

That's bullshit. I know these guys.

I mean, thanks for your concern, but

that just ain't the thing of it.

CONNOR

Do me a favor and roll it around for

a bit on your way in.

ROCCO

No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs

to be rolled.

MURPHY

(to Rocco)

Where are you goin'?

(to Connor)

Did you tell him?

CONNOR

Yes.

MURPHY

(to Rocco)

Then what the fuck?

ROCCO

Hey. You don't know that shit for

sure.

MURPHY

Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin'

retard!

ROCCO

Fuck you!

MURPHY

Use your brain for once. Is it so

unbelievable they don't care about

you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in

there today. Dead!

ROCCO

Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know

what's going on, huh?

(flips them off)

Fuck you!

CONNOR

(trying to calm him)

Hey, this ain't a thing you should

gamble on, Roc.

MURPHY

Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya

want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop.

This is the last time I'll see you.

Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.

ROCCO

(walking away)

I'll be back at 9:00.

CONNOR

Hey. You get in there and start

getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out

quick.

MURPHY

Hello?

ROCCO (V.O.)

Hey Murph.

MURPHY

Roc. You okay?

ROCCO (V.O.)

Yeah. Anybody call for me?

MURPHY

No. You sure you're okay?

ROCCO (V.O.)

I'm fuckin' fine.

(beat)

Catch you on the flip side.

DONNA

(trying hard)

Here kitty, kitty...... kitty.

DOLLY

(approaches Smecker)

She was in here when it went down.

SMECKER

Can she I.D. them?

DOLLY

They were wearing masks.

SMECKER

Of course they were. How many?

DOLLY

Three.

DOLLY

Only two did the shooting.

(beat)

So what are you thinking, Russian

retaliation?

SMECKER

Nah, too quick half their

infrastructure got taken out at the

Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a

hitter, you're either working for

the Russians or the Italians. There's

no riding the fence. Our little theory

from last night just got blown to

shit. Something... new is going on

here.

SMECKER

Probably shouldn't work another shift

for awhile.

DANCER

Fuck this job. I'm getting out of

the porno business and I don't care

who I gotta blow to do it.

SMECKER

After talking to the dancer we know

that their mark was the guy in the

middle booth. After she watches them

whack him, she passes out.

(pause)

Why the two extra victims?

GREENLY

Witness?

SMECKER

No way they could have seen it.

SMECKER

(sarcastic)

Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen

to the protocol of the porno industry,

as I'm sure you've never been in one

of these places before. A man goes

into the booth, puts the money in

the slot. The dancer gets it on the

other side. She hits the button,

door goes up, now there is only glass

between you and it's

(makes a masturbatory

gesture with hand)

little fireman time.

DUFFY

No way they could have seen it?

SMECKER

Those doors were down... which means

this. They looked down in through

the peep hole, saw these guys and

opened the doors from the inside.

Pop, pop, pop, right through the

glass. Why?

DOLLY

Maybe the three of them had something

in common.

SMECKER

No. This guy is big time.

(points to middle

booth)

These two are street-walking scum.

GREENLY

(kidding)

Then that's what they had in common.

They were all bad guys... now they're

all dead bad guys.

SMECKER

We got another thing to think about

here. We got us a genuine Kennedy

assassination style bullet theory.

Two guns were used here, guns A and

B. The guy in the middle was done

with both. But this guy...

(denotes right booth)

...he was killed with bullets from

gun A only. And this guy...

(denotes left booth)

...gun B only. But ballistics dug

two slugs out of the wall from over

here where the victim was done with

A.

SMECKER

And it's the same story over here.

Why the crossover?

(beat)

Theories.

DOLLY

That's just fucking weird. I have no

idea.

DUFFY

Jesus. I just can't think anymore.

That scene over at the coffee shop

today tapped me out.

SMECKER

What?

DUFFY

A guy went nuts over off of

Commonwealth today. Shot three guys

to death in a coffee shop in broad

daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have

much on him.

SMECKER

(angry)

Why was I not informed of this?

GREENLY

They weren't related. The guy used a

38. No pennies. Totally amateur.

SMECKER

Who were the victims?

GREENLY

A couple of peons for the mob and...

SMECKER

(livid)

Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the

scumbags in the quiet city of Boston

start dropping dead and you think

it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I

want the Boston Police doing my

thinking for me, I will have a fucking

tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad

car and get me over there. I want

the crime scene photos and any witness

statements. NOW!

SMECKER

(wide-eyed)

Oh... it looks like we got us a

cowboy.

SMECKER

The shooter knew these guys, huh?

DOLLY

How do you figure?

SMECKER

Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.

SMECKER

These guys were packing. Not one

hand near a gun. It's simple human

behavior. Someone you don't know

approaches you, you put your hand on

it. This guy's got his hands on the

table. He's eating his food, for

Christ sakes. They were friends.

SMECKER

These two fucking scenes are related.

Too many coincidences. Same day?

Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on

both scenes. Now, why did he kill

the bartender?

DUFFY

Crime of passion. He just went nuts.

He would have shot everyone in here.

He just ran out of bullets.

SMECKER

Duffy. This look like a fucking post

office to you? This guy came in here

with intent. Maybe he didn't know

exactly what he was gonna do but he

had a pretty good idea. The bartender

wasn't a fucking accident.

DUFFY

Well, we didn't get any help on that.

A lot of people saw it. Nobody's

talking.

SMECKER

Fucking figures. Look, are you guys

seeing the pattern here? We got big

questions at both of these crime

scenes, with no answers. WHY did

they kill the guys in the other two

booths? WHY did he do the bartender?

It would seem unnecessary, even

stupid.

(angry)

God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm

fucking leaving now. And do me a

favor, tell me when the next guy

dies, cause these guys are not done

yet.

MURPHY (V.O.)

Hello?

ROCCO

Hey, Murph.

MURPHY (V.O.)

Roc. You okay?

ROCCO

Yeah. Anybody call for me?

MURPHY (V.O.)

No. You sure you're okay?

ROCCO

I'm fuckin' fine.

(beat)

Catch you on the flip side.

ROCCO

Pack your shit! We gotta get outta

here! We gotta get out!

CONNOR

(hopping into his

boots)

What happened?

ROCCO

I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em

all!!

DONNA

Rocco?

MURPHY

Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us

what happened!

ROCCO

No! Fuck you! You start getting

excited! We gotta fucking go!

DONNA

Rocco!

CONNOR

(packing up gear)

Who did you kill?

MURPHY

(packing up gear)

Holy shit. Who? How many?

ROCCO

(rummaging through

his drawers)

Hurry the fuck up!

MURPHY

This is some crazy shit, man!

ROCCO

Those cocksuckers sold me out!

CONNOR

Did I fuckin' tell ya, Rocco? They

pull on you first?

DONNA

ROCCO!

ROCCO

What did I fuckin' do?... in the

middle of the Lakeview.

CONNOR

Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!

MURPHY

Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of

coconut balls man!

DONNA/RAYVIE

ROCCO!

ROCCO

(turns in rage)

What?

DONNA

(softly)

Where's my cat?

ROCCO

(slight pause)

I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie

bitch!

DONNA

(shocked, hurt)

You... oh god, why?

ROCCO

I felt it would bring closure to our

relationship!

DONNA

(crying)

You killed my... my...

ROCCO

(screaming)

Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!

DONNA

My, my...

ROCCO

(puts his gun to his

own head)

Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself

in the head, you can tell me that

cats name! Go ahead... Your what?

Your precious little...

(waiting for her

response)

DONNA

(flustered, crying)

Pee...Per...Man.

ROCCO

Peeperman? WRONG? What color was

it?!!!

DONNA

It was... It was...

ROCCO

Male or female, bitch?!!

RAYVIE

Don't you yell at her you fuckin'

prick!

ROCCO

Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't

buy a pack of smokes without running

into nine guys you fucked.

DONNA

Don't you yell at her!

ROCCO

All right, let's get the fuck outta

here!

RAYVIE

Is my... I mean it's not really...?

DONNA

No. No. It's not fat.

ROCCO

Those rat fucks! All of them were

all laughing at me man!

MURPHY

You sure you killed them?

ROCCO (V.O.)

Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam

turkey shoot over there.

VINNIE

I'll bet it was a test. Vincenzo

came in here shooting his mouth off.

He was makin' sure we knew. But we

did what we were supposed to, eh? We

kept our mouths shut. You did your

part. They know we're goodfellas

now. We'll get taken care of.

ROCCO

What? Did everyone know? Next thing

you'll tell me Sal was in on it.

OLY

Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That

fat fuck knew before we did.

OLY

At least we got our funny man back.

CONNOR

Anybody see ya?

ROCCO

Fuck, man! I may as well have posted

flyers. Right out in public, man.

MURPHY

Liberating isn't it?

ROCCO

(smiles at last)

Y'know it is, a bit.

ROCCO

Stop the car!

ROCCO

Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,

Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one

who set me up. Then he went around

shooting his mouth off, telling

everyone I was as good as dead. He

goes in there every Wednesday night

around 10:00, he jerks off in the

same booth to the same titty dancer.

Never misses.

MURPHY

So?

ROCCO

So let's kill the motherfucker. I

mean, what are you guys... like that's

your new thing right?

CONNOR

(looks at Murphy)

Yeah, well...

ROCCO

Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys

decide who you're... I mean, who

makes the cut? Is there a raffle or

something?

MURPHY

Well, truth be known, those first

ones just kinda fell into our laps.

ROCCO

Well, what'ya do?

CONNOR

I guess we really don't have a system

of deciding who.

ROCCO

(excited, yelling)

MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know

everyone, their habits, where they

hang out, who they talk to. I know

where they fuckin' live. We could

kill everyone!

MURPHY

(to Connor)

So what do you think?

CONNOR

I'm strangely comfortable with it.

MURPHY

Okay Roc, this is...

ROCCO

What? You guys got masks.

MURPHY

(through laughter)

You look like Mush Mouth from Fat

Albert.

ROCCO

(takes off mask)

Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she

can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin'

to be professional, but no...

CONNOR

(still laughing)

No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it

back on. It's good.

CONNOR

(imitating mush mouth)

Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B?

ROCCO

Which one is he in?

ROCCO

(takes his hand off

her mouth)

What's his routine?

DANCER

H... h... he jerks off in there.

Th... then he puts money through the

slot and I raise the door.

MURPHY

How?

ROCCO

Then what?

DANCER

He watches me do my thing and f-

finishes himself off.

VINCENZO

(grunting, muttering)

Don't you talk to me like that, you

dirty little... give it to daddy...

give it ta da King... garbage mouth,

garbage mouth.

ROCCO

Oh man. He is some sicko.

CONNOR

You've earned this.

CONNOR

What the fuck are you doing?

ROCCO

I-I'll tip her.

MURPHY

We've teamed up with a sex offender.

CONNOR

So, when are you getting a plastic

fuck doll?

ROCCO

All right. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.

ROCCO

What? What is it?

CONNOR

This place is like a scumbag yard

sale.

MURPHY

We gotta come down here once a week

and clean house.

ROCCO

You sure about this guy?

ROCCO

Oh man. You gotta let me do these

guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make

up for the tit thing.

CONNOR

No way. I've been waitin' for this

asshole.

ROCCO

Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family

name here. I've brought shame to the

house of Della Rocco.

MURPHY

Give the guy a shot.

CONNOR

(thinks it over)

Rocco, this is the real deal. We

must kill without hesitation, without

guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead

man.

ROCCO

Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man!

ROCCO

You guys gotta teach me that prayer,

man. That's some good shit.

CONNOR

Forget it. It's a family prayer. My

father, his father before him that

sort of shit.

ROCCO

C'mon!

AUGUSTUS

Fuck you.

YAKAVETTA

Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I

got a serious problem here. I'm not

screwing around.

AUGUSTUS

I bounced you on my knee at family

reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad

and me ran the whole east coast

syndicate you snot-nosed little prick.

And when you took the wheel, who was

beside you?

YAKAVETTA

Hey, I just...

AUGUSTUS

Don't start with your shit. Don't

you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy,

thanks for years of service. Here's

a gold watch and a job sniffing other

guys' shit eight hours a day. What

am I, a retired bus driver?

YAKAVETTA

I need Il Duce.

AUGUSTUS

The Duke?

(beat)

What did you do?

YAKAVETTA

This kid, this package boy could

bring down the whole east coast. If

he decides to turn states he could

dismantle us... totally. But it looks

like for now, he's content with just

killing us one by one. And even worse

the kid is good at it. I mean I had

a prodigy on my hands the whole time

and didn't even know it.

AUGUSTUS

Listen kid, I think you better

understand who you're dealing with

here.

YAKAVETTA

Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen

when you guys used to talk about

him, like he was a ghost or something.

AUGUSTUS

Your dad and I used him three times

over twenty years, only when

everything went totally fucked.

Believe me kid, you don't want this

guy unless you are 100% sure you

need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.

MR. COBB

(English accent)

Do you feel you have been

rehabilitated?

AUGUSTUS

I've had this guy in front of me,

and I couldn't tell you what he looks

like, sounds like. He is the Picasso

of assassins, kid. He plants hair

samples, blood. Puts skin under

fingernails. He is a fucking genius.

Only one problem. He's been rotting

in prison for twenty-five or thirty

years. Don't even know if he's still

alive. Or if he's even up to it.

YAKAVETTA

There's ways around that.

AUGUSTUS

Go find one.

ROCCO

Let's talk some business here. I

know a sick fuck... makes the ones

we been doing look like altar boys.

Worst night of my life when I met

this guy.

ROCCO

The guy never says a fuckin' word to

me. We're driving for 25 minutes.

Never a sigh, no throat clearing,

nothing. And his face, blank man.

Just nothing there.

ROCCO

I didn't see what he was doing while

he was in there.

THE MAN

I have a poker game at the house

every Saturday with a couple of guys

you know. Why don't you come down?

Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que.

ROCCO

(pause)

Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me

something. What did they do?

THE MAN

I don't know.

ROCCO

Worst day of my life, man.

MURPHY

(pause)

Well, I'm sold.

CONNOR

Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy

right and you'll feel a lot better.

CONNOR

Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know

you fuckin' know!

ROCCO

Fuck you! I told you I never saw him

before!

MURPHY

Well he sure as fuck knew you!

ROCCO

Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was

aiming at you!

SMECKER

Okay. Here's what happened.

SMECKER

They waited in a parked car down the

street for the kid to leave.

MURPHY

There he goes.

(turns back to them,

pulls his guns)

Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to

bring this man into the light? Are

we ready to truly do the work of the

Lord?

CONNOR

(cocks his pistol)

A-fuckin'-men!

ROCCO

This is so fuckin' cool!

SMECKER

They went in through the garage. The

kid says he leaves it open when he

takes his bike out.

SMECKER (V.O.)

Now, they know the wife is the gate

keeper. She knows the code.

ROCCO

Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill

you.

SMECKER

The wife says she doesn't know what

happened after she hit the code. She

just remembers going down. But,

judging by the burn mark on her back,

I think what they did...

SMECKER

...was use a stun gun on her.

SMECKER

Now the guy knows a friend is coming

to the game. And they know that this

door can only be opened from the

inside. So they wait... and when

that door opens, man...

ROCCO

All of them.

SMECKER

Nobody was ready for it. Devastation,

panic! This was like shooting fish

in a fuckin' barrel!

SMECKER

Now these guys dove under the table.

The trajectory on the bullets show

they came from straight across. So

this means one of our shooters...

dropped to his knees...

ROCCO

Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.

MURPHY

What the fuck do you mean?

ROCCO

I mean he ain't here.

CONNOR

Look again for fuck sake!

ROCCO

I know what the fuck he looks like!

SMECKER

Something went wrong. Right here.

CONNOR

Let the boy go!

MURPHY

C'mon Roc!

SMECKER

Now, one of these guys is a real

sicko. He knew this man. He wanted

him to suffer, to feel every second

of a painful death.

ROCCO

Help me you assholes!

(they continue to

cheer)

He's gonna fuckin' kill me!

(he fights harder)

SMECKER

This guy is one bad motherfucker.

ROCCO

I don't wanna die!!!!!

SMECKER

I've never seen wounds like these

before, but whatever he used on this

guy, it was a blunt object and they

took it with them.

SMECKER

They exited out the front door. And

they had no fucking idea what they

were in for.

SMECKER

Now they are staring at six guys

with guns drawn. It was a fucking

ambush.

SMECKER

And this was a fucking bomb dropping

in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few

seconds this place was Armageddon!

There was a fire fight!

IL DUCE

No!... No! No!...

GREENLY

What if it was just one guy with six

guns?

SMECKER

Why don't you let me do the thinking,

huh, genius?

SMECKER

What is taking so long with those

blood samples?

FORENSICS WOMAN #1

I can't get a good sample. There is

variable here I'm not seeing.

SMECKER

(in shock, and rage)

They used ammonia... none of this

shit is any good... Fuck... You know

what this means?! Even if we get

suspects in this case, we got

nothing... Nothing!

SMECKER

(screaming)

Who the fuck are they?! I've never

seen any-fucking-thing like this in

my whole fucking life. Who the fuck

are they?!!

DUFFY

What? That's it?!

CONNOR

Shit.

ROCCO

What?

(points to TV)

What, that guy?

MURPHY

That's the guy that got us off the

hook with the "Checkov" thing.

CONNOR

And he is one smart man.

ROCCO

They got nothing.

CONNOR

This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't

figured us out yet, he will.

MURPHY

You bet your ass he will.

ROCCO

Well, I'd say that makes him a lia-

fuckin-bility.

CONNOR

He isn't to be touched.

MURPHY

He's a good man.

ROCCO

Okay... whatever.

(looking at the bloody

mess)

My Mom's gonna kill me.

SMECKER

No. This is all wrong. David Della

Rocco?

MARIA (V.O.)

Boston Police Department.

SMECKER

Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could

you find me the visitor's list for

the day the MacManus brothers were

in and read me all the names?

SMECKER

Okay, thank you.

BARTENDER

You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are

you sure you...

SMECKER

Pour the drink, faggot-ass!

SMECKER

Okay... But I don't cuddle.

ROCCO

Hey! We gotta talk about this early

morning church shit.

MURPHY

We have to go now.

(giggles)

We're on the lamb.

ROCCO

You gonna do what I say, got it?

PRIEST

Yes.

ROCCO

I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see

this. Don't look at me!

PRIEST

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.

ROCCO

Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

PRIEST

Don't do this my son.

ROCCO

Open it!

PRIEST

Have you no fear of God?

ROCCO

That's who I'm doing this for, now

open the fuckin' thing.

ROCCO

Father, I'll do you right here.

PRIEST

(slowly obey,

whispering)

God have mercy on my soul.

CONNOR

(hard whisper)

You little fuck. Let him go. I'll

drop you right here.

ROCCO

Okay, just calm down. He could hurt

us, brother. He could ruin the whole

thing.

CONNOR

Let him go or I will deliver you,

right now.

(pulls hammer back)

ROCCO

You won't do it Connor, you won't.

You love me man.

SMECKER

(slurred, loud)

Hello? You there?

PRIEST

Y-Yes my son.

ROCCO

(whispers)

Do your thing Father. Don't fuck

this up.

PRIEST

(whispering to Rocco)

What do you want me to say?

ROCCO

Just be natural, goddamit.

PRIEST

How long since your last confession,

my son?

SMECKER

Oh, Christ, uh, I've never confessed.

SMECKER

According to the dogma of the Catholic

church, I should probably burst into

flames right here in this booth. But

I've come here for advice, not

salvation.

PRIEST

Why have you come to a church for

council if you're not religious?

SMECKER

(ponderous)

Why have I come to a church? I never

have before. I guess I just... felt

I should.

PRIEST

What is it my son?

SMECKER

It's ethics. I put evil men behind

bars, but the law has miles of red

tape and loopholes for these...

cocksuckers to slip through. I've

found out there are these two young

men who fix the situation with an

iron fist. As if they have God's

permission. But what they do is wrong

and I should arrest them...

technically.

PRIEST

God's permission? God doesn't...

SMECKER

But in this day and age I believe

what they do is... necessary. I feel

it is... correct.

PRIEST

You believe?

SMECKER

Yes.

PRIEST

You feel?

SMECKER

Yes.

PRIEST

You feel? A soul is what gives you

feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or

wrong. It is a conduit through which

the Lord speaks to us. You felt that

your answers would be here in the

house of God today. You feel these

men are necessary. The Lord has spoken

to you twice this day.

SMECKER

(sarcastically)

Has he now?

PRIEST

You have entered the house of the

Lord of your own free will speaking

of beliefs and feelings. Is it so

much to believe that God has brought

you here?

SMECKER

I guess not.

PRIEST

It is easy to be sarcastic about

religion. It is harder to take small

hints from God, your feelings and

listen to them... to take a stand.

SMECKER

You're right.

PRIEST

Those who do not act are in a constant

state of ethical indecision.

SMECKER

I want to stand for what I believe

in, father.

PRIEST

Then you must find out what your

beliefs are.

SMECKER

I believe these young men are right.

PRIEST

You know them personally?

SMECKER

Yes.

PRIEST

Do you think they would harm an

innocent man, for any reason?

SMECKER

No. They would never do that.

SMECKER

Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.

But the Italian guy, he might. He's

kind of an idiot.

ROCCO

(whispers to priest)

Goddam right, I am.

SMECKER

I'm beginning to see. I've been doing

my job... well for fifteen years and

it's just not enough. All the things

I wish I could do, these guys are

doing. Millions of dollars in tax

payers' money wasted on shit like

wire taps and surveillance. Theses

boys go in and take care of it for

the price of a bullet.

(looks up)

Ww-what do you think I should do?

Because I'm a law man.

PRIEST

The laws of God are higher than the

laws of man.

SMECKER

(the clouds have lifted)

Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too.

No. I was feeling it. All I needed

was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll

help them.

PRIEST

(whispers)

Forgive me father.

SMECKER

Thank you, Father, thank you.

(he attempts the sign

of the cross but

screws it up)

Whatever. Goodbye, amen.

ROCCO

I wouldn't have, uh, killed you,

Father.

(signs cross)

Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're

bound. You can't talk about this...

to anyone.

PRIEST

Just go!

ROCCO

(giggling)

The Lord works in mysterious ways.

SMECKER

That's all you can give me?

CONNOR

Well, the light caught the side of

his face for a second. And it looked

like he had a gray beard, maybe...

late fifties, early sixties.

SMECKER

So you're telling me it was one guy

with six guns? A-and he was a senior

fucking citizen?

CONNOR

I think it's better if we find this

man before he finds us again.

SMECKER

I'll see what I can do. How do I get

in touch with you?

CONNOR

We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight,

right in the comfort of his own home.

Then we move on to New York. It's

getting a bit hot for us here.

SMECKER

Be careful.

CONNOR

I'll call you tonight, afterwards.

(hangs up)

AUGUSTUS

I don't know who he is. Nobody does.

SMECKER

What did he bring him in for?

AUGUSTUS

Needed an outsider. The package boy

knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters

a mile away.

SMECKER

Just for him?

AUGUSTUS

Well he's the one shooting up all

his guys, right? He's scared of the

kid. Says he's real good, got every

available gun in the city up there.

SMECKER

Up where?

AUGUSTUS

Up his house. I don't know what's

going on but I know it's gotta have

something to do with this kid.

SMECKER

Oh fuck!

(runs out)

YAKAVETTA

(yelling)

You gonna tell me what's going on

here?! Huh! You little fuck! Gimme

some answers!

YAKAVETTA

What do you guys think?

GENO

They're tough. No way they're gonna

talk.

HOJO

I know Rocco. He ain't smart enough

for this shit. These other guys are

the brains. He's just a player.

YAKAVETTA

There's only one way to get them to

talk.

ROCCO

(struggles to talk)

You guys?

CONNOR

(crying)

We're here brother.

ROCCO

You gotta keep going.

MURPHY

(sobbing)

We'll keep going, Roc.

ROCCO

You'll make it outta here. You can't

ever stop, not ever.

CHAPPY

Once you set him in motion, you can't

call him off. He thinks it's still

on.

YAKAVETTA

Oh Jesus Christ!

HOJO

What? I...

YAKAVETTA

Hey, I don't have my name spray

painted on the front of this house.

There are no big pictures of me

anywhere. If this guy thinks the job

is still a go then I got green money

says the mother fucker's out in the

bushes already. I'm fucking gone!

I'm leaving you guys to deal with

this.

GENO

One fucking guy, so what.

HOJO

Why don't you take the front.

(points)

You guys cover those other exits and

if you see him, don't flag him down,

just kill the mother fucker. I'm

going back down to work on these

pricks.

SMECKER AS WOMAN

Joey Bevo sent me over. As

entertainment.

GENO

Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night

for this shit.

(beat)

Bevo's so great. Always sending us

hot girls.

SMECKER

You look like you could use a quickie.

GENO

Hey, Chappy!

CHAPPY

(Chappy, emerges way

down the hall)

What the fuck?

GENO

I ain't been laid in a week. Take

five minutes.

CHAPPY

If I die cause you're getting a piece

of ass, I'll come back and beat you

to death with a big rubber dick.

GENO

Don't worry about it.

CONNOR

How far are we going with this, Da?

FATHER

The questions is not, "how far?" The

question is, "Do you possess the

constitution, the depth of faith to

go as far as is needed?"

MEDIA MAN 1

(whispering to #2)

Look at his charisma. He's the next

John Gotti.

MEDIA MAN 2

He'll walk. Even with all this

evidence.

MEDIA MAN 1

Look.

(points to the left

and right sections

of courtroom seating)

All Yakavetta's people are on the

right. All the families of the men

he has killed are on the left.

Everyone wants some justice.

MEDIA MAN 2

Look at him. He doesn't have a care

in the world. He's gonna walk.

FATHER

How long do these put a man down

for?

MURPHY

Ten minutes.

FATHER

Twenty is a bit better.

JUDGE

Due to the lack of hard evidence......

FATHER

All media to the back! Drop the

cameras! Drop 'em!

FATHER

(loudly)

You people have been chosen to reveal

our existence to the world. You will

witness what happens here today and

you will tell of it afterwards.

YAKAVETTA

(looking to his

comrades)

Fuckin' do something!

FATHER (WHISPERS)

(whispers)

You must watch dear. It'll all be

over soon.

(she obeys)

CONNOR

(yelling over the

alarm)

Now, you will receive us.

MURPHY

(yelling over the

alarm)

We do not ask for your poor or your

hungry.

CONNOR

We do not want your tired and sick.

MURPHY

It is your corrupt we claim.

CONNOR

It is your evil, who will be sought

by us.

MURPHY

With every breath we shall hunt them

down.

CONNOR

Each day we will spill their blood

till it rains down from the skies.

MURPHY

Do not kill, do not rape, do not

steal. These are principles which

every man of every faith can embrace.

CONNOR

These are not polite suggestions.

They are codes of behavior and those

that ignore them will pay the dearest

cost.

(points to Yakavetta)

MURPHY

There are varying degrees of evil.

We urge you lesser forms of filth

(pointing to

Yakavetta's people)

Not to push the bounds and cross

over into true corruption... into

our domain.

CONNOR

For if you do, there will come the

day when you look behind you and see

we three. And on that day you will

reap it.

MURPHY

And we will send you to whatever God

you wish.

REPORTER 2 (V.O.)

Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss?

Did you see?

WOMAN (FRAIL)

(frail)

Yes. I was there.

REPORTER (V.O.)

How do you feel about what they did?

WOMAN

I guess we all know what is right

and wrong. We all know. Nobody needs

to be convinced of what he was...

I'm going home now to have my first

real full night's sleep.

FADE OUT:

THE END
