V FOR VENDETTA

Written by

Larry and Andy Wachowski

Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore

EVEY (V.O.)

"Remember, remember, the fifth of

November, the gunpowder treason and

plot.  I know of now reason why the

gunpowder treason should ever be

forgot."

EVEY (V.O.)

Those were almost the very first

words he spoke to me and, in a way,

that is where this story began,

four hundred years ago, in a cellar

beneath the Houses of Parliament.

EVEY (V.O.)

In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to

blow up the Houses of Parliament.

EVEY (V.O.)

He was caught in the cellars with

enough gunpowder to level most of

London.

EVEY (V.O.)

Sometimes I wonder where we would

be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder

if it would have mattered.

EVEY (V.O.)

I suppose the answer is in the

rhyme.  More than the man, what we

must remember is the plot itself.

EVEY (V.O.)

For in the plot we find more than

just a man, we find the idea of

that man, the spirit of that man,

and that is what we must never

forget.

EVEY (V.O.)

This, then, is the story of that

idea, of that spirit that began

with an anarchist's plot four

hundred years ago.

FADE OUT.

EVEY (V.O.)

I was born near the end of the

millennium, the year 1997.  My

father used to say that people were

so afraid that the world was going

to end that they were willing it to

happen.

EVEY (V.O.)

I don't remember much of the

century's turn.  I don't remember

the market crash or the plague or

any of the Trafalgar riots.

EVEY (V.O.)

I've read about them since but I

don't recall how any of them

impacted my life except for the

fear.  They would hide it from me,

like a secret between them.

EVEY (V.O.)

But I could feel it.

EVEY (V.O.)

Of the chaos that seemed to swallow

the beginning of the 21st century,

there is one thing I do remember.

EVEY (V.O.)

Very clearly, I can remember that

sound.

EVEY (V.O.)

And I remember those boots, black

leather that gleamed bright in the

morning sun.  I had never seen such

boots.  All moving in perfect

unison.

DASCOMBE

The time has come, London, to

return to a bygone age, an age of

tradition, an age of values that

have been disparaged and all but

forgotten.  What this country needs

is a leader!  A true leader to

remind us of that age.  A righteous

leader with the strength of his

moral convictions to do what must

be done.  I give you that man!  I

give you our leader!  Adam Susan!

EVEY (V.O.)

It must have seemed so easy to

them.  They offered such a simple

deal; give up control and we will

restore order.

EVEY (V.O.)

At first, the arrests were

political.  Dissidents.  Radicals.

Liberals.

EVEY (V.O.)

When my parents were younger, they

had been activists.  They had

marched with Labor in the great

train strike.

LITTLE EVEY

Mommy?

MOTHER

My daughter!  Don't take my

daughter!

FATHER

Evey!  Evey!

LITTLE EVEY

Mommy!  Daddy!

EVEY (V.O.)

I never saw them again.  Overnight,

my life, my entire world was

erased.

EVEY (V.O.)

It was done so quickly and

violently, so completely, that it

began to seem that it had never

even existed.

EVEY (V.O.)

The homosexuals were next.  What

God had started with AIDS had to be

finished by man.  It was God's

work.  That's what we were told.

EVEY (V.O.)

But once they were gone, there was

someone else.  Someone different.

EVEY (V.O.)

Someone dangerous.

EVEY (V.O.)

There were those who understood

what was happening, who knew it was

wrong but who kept silent.

EVEY (V.O.)

And in the vacuum of that silence,

order was imposed.

EVEY (V.O.)

Order that was like those boots,

order that required rigorous

discipline.  Order that is exactly

the same, where each single step

falls with every step.  The order

of the many shaped into one.

EVEY (V.O.)

Somehow in my heart, I knew it

wouldn't last.

EVEY (V.O.)

What they thought they had crushed,

the spirit they believed trampled

and ground beneath the marching of

their boots, rose up, rose as if

from a four hundred year old grave,

rose to remind us all that day.

FADE OUT.

FATE (V.O.)

Good evening, London.  It's nine

o'clock, the fourth of November in

the year 2019 and this is the voice

of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285

of the medium wave.

FATE (V.O.)

People of London, be advised --

FATE (V.O.)

-- that Braxton and Streathon are

quarantine zones as of today.

FATE (V.O.)

It is suggested that these area be

avoided for reasons of health and

safety.

FATE (V.O.)

Good news following the

productivity reports from

Herefordshire indicating a possible

end to meat rationing starting mid

February.

FATE (V.O.)

Police raided seventeen homes in

the Birmingham area, uncovering

what is believed to be a major

terrorist ring.

FATE (V.O.)

Twenty eight people, eight of them

women, are currently in detention

awaiting trial.

FATE (V.O.)

And that is the face of London

tonight.

FATE (V.O.)

And this is the voice of Fate

signing off and bidding you a

pleasant evening.

EVEY (V.O.)

I don't know what brought us

together that night.  I had never

been to that part of Westminster

but ever since I've known him, I've

stopped believing in coincidence.

EVEY

Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,

Mister?

EVEY

Would you like... uh, would you

like to sleep with me?

EVEY

I mean, for money.

MAN

That is the clumsiest bit of

propositioning I've ever heard.

EVEY

Oh god, I'm sorry.

MAN

Is this your first time, darling?

EVEY

Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I

know what you want and I'll do it.

EVEY

Anything you want, mister.  Please,

I need the money.  I know I'm young

but I promise I know what I'm

doing.

MAN

No.  You don't know what you're

doing.

EVEY

Christ, you're a Fingerman.

FINGERMAN 1

Give the little lady a prize.

FINGERMAN 2

I've got something to give her.

FINGERMAN 1

Prostitution is a class H offense.

Know what that means?  It means

that we get to exercise our own

judicial discretion --

FINGERMAN 2

And you get to swallow it.

EVEY

Oh god, please.  It's my first

time.  Please don't hurt me.

FINGERMAN 1

Gosh, fellas, look at those big

innocent eyes.  What do you think?

FINGERMAN 3

Spare the rod, spoil the child.

EVEY

Oh no!

EVEY

Please, don't!

FINGERMAN 3

You heard the man, sweetie.  This

rod's for your own good.

V

"The multiplying villainies of

nature do swarm upon him."

FINGERMAN 3

What the hell --

V

"And fortune, on his damned

quarrel, smiling, showed like a

rebel's whore."

FINGERMAN 1

We're police officers, pal.

FINGERMAN 4

We're with the Finger.

FINGERMAN 3

So bugger off!

V

"Disdaining fortune with his

brandished steel, which smoked with

bloody execution."

FINGERMAN 1

He's got a knife!

FINGERMAN 3

Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me!

V

Good evening.

EVEY

Who -- Who are you?

V

Me?  I imagine all manner of names

shall be heaped upon my humble

visage but, for now, let us simply

say I am the villain.

V

And you would be?

EVEY

Evey.

V

Of course.

EVEY

Why did you do that?  Why did

you... help me?

V

Why indeed?

V

Almost time.

EVEY

For what?

V

For the music.

EVEY

Music?

V

Yes, music.  My music.  You see.

Evey, I am a performer.

EVEY

Is that why you're wearing a mask?

V

We all wear masks.  Life creates

them and forces us to find the one

that fits.  Do you know what day it

is?

EVEY

Uh... November fourth.

V

Not for long.

V

"Remember, remember, the fifth of

November, the gunpowder treason and

plot.  I know of no reason why the

gunpowder treason should ever be

forgot."

V

Tell me, Evey, what good is an

actor that plays his part to an

empty theatre?

EVEY

I don't know.

V

Nor do I.  That's why you are here.

I need you, Evey.  I need someone

to listen.

EVEY

To your music?

V

Yes.  Yes, to my music.

V

Can you hear it?  It's already

begun.

EVEY

I can't hear anything.

V

At first, you have to listen very

carefully...

V

Ahh, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,

is it not?

EVEY

Oh my...

EVEY

It's beautiful...

V

Thank you.

LEADER

Gentlemen, I will hear your reports

now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye.

CONRAD

We have less than two minutes of

usable footage, Leader.  It took

the suspect less than a minute to

dispatch the Finger's vice patrol.

CONRAD

As you can see, the suspect's

reflex speed is extraordinary.  As

is his strength.

LEADER

Freeze it!

CONRAD

I'm afraid the mask makes retinal

identification impossible.

LEADER

Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear!

ETHERIDGE

We were able to triangulate the

origin of the fireworks.  We also

are currently monitoring a lot of

phone surveillance indicating a

high percentage of conversation

concerned with the explosions.  All

suspect or significant transcripts

are being forwarded to Mr. Almond.

LEADER

Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for

the Nose.

FINCH

Thanks to Etheridge, we found the

launch for the fireworks.  These

appear to be individually weighted

flares and we have found traces of

the same chemicals at both of the

detonation sites which leads us to

conclude that, despite a level of

sophistication, these devices are

all home-made with over the counter

chemicals, making them impossible

to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,

he's good.

LEADER

Thank you for that professional

annotation.

LIEUTENANT (V.O.)

Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived.

LEADER

Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me

informed of any further

developments.  England prevails.

LEADER

Mr. Almond, do you know what this

is behind me?

ALMOND

Uh... the Fate computer system,

sir?

LEADER

No.  No sir.  It's more than that.

This, this computer is a symbol,

Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the

highest attainable goal of mankind.

Do you know what that goal is, Mr.

Almond?

LEADER

Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The

world around us is a changing,

directionless, amoral morass and it

is up to man and man alone to set

things right!

LEADER

Without control, man is nothing

more than any other stinking,

sweating, brute animal.  Control,

Mr. Almond.  The control that we

have painstakingly built up over

the last ten years.  Now, do you

understand what happened last

night?

ALMOND

We... lost control.

LEADER

Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night

someone did the unthinkable.

Someone hurt us.  It is imperative

that we act swiftly and precisely.

I want that man found, Mr. Almond.

I want his head or, by god, I'll

have yours.

EVEY

Wait.  I've lost you.

V

No, you haven't.

EVEY

Oh...

EVEY

A jukebox?  Where did you get it?

V

I saved it.  Like everything here.

EVEY

Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never

heard anything like it.

V

Of course not.  You grew up in

their world.  Art is created by

individuals and there are no

individuals in a world where you

are told what to think.

EVEY

This place is amazing.

V

You're welcome to stay.

EVEY

Stay here... with you?

V

Yes.  If you like.

EVEY

I... I don't even know your name.

V

I don't have a name.  But you can

call me V.

EVEY

V?  V... I like that.

PROTHERO

Good morning, London.  This is the

voice of Fate -- Damn.

PROTHERO

Good morning -- ack.  Good morning

Lond-- Goddammit!  Where is my

bloody tea?!

DASCOMBE

Would someone get his lordship his

bloody tea?

DASCOMBE

Lewis, they want this report on the

first hour --

PROTHERO

I know.  I know.  Damned

inconvenient this entire affair.

Fine.  Let's try again.

PROTHERO

Good morning, London.  It is 6 am,

the fifth of November 2019 and this

is the voice of Fate.  The new day

brings good news and bright

prospects from overseas, where

negotiations with New China are

moving in a positive direction.

Last night's scheduled demolition

of two deteriorating landmarks went

off without a hitch.

PROTHERO

Spokesman for the Interior ministry

said both structures were severely

damaged and judged to be a danger

to the unsuspecting public.  Plans

for new landmarks are well

underway.

PROTHERO

Do you believe this crap, Dascombe?

DASCOMBE

It's not our job to believe it,

Lewis.  Our job is to tell the

people --

PROTHERO

"Exactly what they tell us."  I

Know but do you think that people

will believe it?

DASCOMBE

They will if it's you that's

telling it to them.  Now let's try

it again.

PROTHERO (V.O.)

... plans for new landmarks are

already well underway.

PROTHERO

"Remember, remember, the fifth of

November..."

PROTHERO

Do you suppose that's why he did

it?

BODYGUARD 1

Sir, who did what, sir?

PROTHERO

Guy Fawkes.  He tried to blow up

Parliament.

PROTHERO

Don't they teach history in school

anymore?

BODYGUARD 1

Sir, we're both straight military,

sir.

BODYGUARD 2

Sir, yes, sir.  I was fighting in

Ireland by the time I was sixteen.

PROTHERO

Yes, of course.  My mistake.

PROTHERO

I love trains.  I remember riding

the underground with my father.

Shame they shut them all down.

BODYGUARD 1

What the hell's that!

BODYGUARD 1

I thought I saw a man jumping onto

the train.

BODYGUARD 2

The train's doing almost seventy.

It would break his legs.

BODYGUARD 1

You're right, I... It must have

been rags.

PROTHERO

Get off of me!

BODYGUARD 2

What the fuck is going on?

BODYGUARD 1

Lock the car doors.

PROTHERO

I have a lighter... somewhere...

BODYGUARD 2

I can't find the lock -- wait.  Hey

wha--

BODYGUARD 1

What's happening --

PROTHERO

I found it!

PROTHERO

Oh god.

PROTHERO

Who are you?  What do you want?

Money?  Is that it?

PROTHERO

Wait, wait.  You're, you're the one

that blew the Bailey.

PROTHERO

You're making a mistake.  I'm

nobody --

PROTHERO

Oh god, what do you want?

V

I've come to offer you a choice.

Commander Prothero.

PROTHERO

What -- What did you call me?

V

Commander Prothero.

V

That was your title at Larkhill.

You remember Larkhill, don't you,

Commander?

V (V.O.)

Where they sent the undesirables.

PROTHERO

I don't know what you're talking

about.

V

Maybe I can help your memory.

Let's see.  Larkhill opened in the

summer of 2009.  You were appointed

it commander.  You wore a uniform

in those days.  You looked very

good in it.

V (V.O.)

You were a man of many

responsibilities.  You made sure

Larkhill made all its quotas,

especially the oven quotas even

though they required an excessive

amount of maintenance.

V (V.O.)

But there was one task you took to

with exceptional relish.  Remember

the medical block, Commander?  I

believe you called it the funny

farm.  You were the one that

selected the prisoners.  You hand

picked each one.

PROTHERO

Her.

PROTHERO

You.

PROTHERO

You!  You're him, aren't you?

PROTHERO

Oh my god!  What are you going to

do?

V

You gave us a choice, remember,

Commander?  You said we could

cooperate with the doctors or...

V

Hold out your hand.

PROTHERO

Oh no, no!  Please I was just doing

what I was told!

V

Of course you were.  Now I'm

telling you to make a choice.

Either you stick that syringe into

your neck or --

V

I can kill you right now.

V

Crying doesn't help, Commander.  I

remember there was a woman who had

been screaming for two days.  You

winked at the doctor and laughed,

"All in the name of science."

PROTHERO

Please, don't make me do this...

V

It's a difficult choice, isn't it?

Certain death versus something that

might be... worse.  But you never

know.  There is still a chance.

You could survive.  Look at me.

Now, time's up, Commander.  Choose.

PROTHERO

I'll see you in hell.

V

Yes.  I'm quite sure you will.

TRAIN MAN

This door's locked!

TRAIN MAN

Holy Christ!

TRAIN MAN

What happened here?

TRAIN MAN

Good lord!  I need a medic here.

PROTHERO

Fi... Fi... Fi...

TRAIN MAN 2

He's trying to say something.

PROTHERO

Five.

TRAIN MAN 1

Five?  Where's the goddamn medic?

PROTHERO

Room five.

TRAIN MAN 2

I think he needs a priest.

DOMINIC

What do you make of this, Mr.

Finch?

FINCH

Hmm.  It's a rose.  A violet

carson, I believe.  Strange.

DOMINIC

Strange?

FINCH

I didn't think they still existed.

SOLDIER

Mr. Finch!  Sir!

SOLDIER

Sir, they want you at headquarters,

sir.

FINCH

Now?

SOLDIER

Yes, sir.  I'm to transport you

immediately.

FINCH

Send the rose to the lab.  Also,

scrape a sample of this paint and

have it analyzed as well.  I'll be

back as soon as I can.

LEADER

Ah, Mr. Finch.  I sent for you

because what I have to say cannot

be said over a phone or a radio.

What I have to say cannot leave

these four walls.  Do I make myself

clear?

FINCH

Yes, sir.

LEADER

I believe in a few things, Mr.

Finch.  I believe in god.  I

believe in the destiny of the

Nordic race.  And I believe in

fascism.  The romans invented

fascism.  They had a symbol for it;

a bundle of twigs bound together.

One twig could be broken but a

bundle would prevail.  That is the

heart and soul of fascism.

Strength in unity.  I tell you

these things knowing full well that

they make you uncomfortable.

FINCH

Well, I...

LEADER

You have in fact expressed your

discomfort in several arrest

reports, arrests that were, in your

opinion, "unnecessary."  The fact

that you are here, that you are not

rotting in a prison cell, is a mark

of my respect and admiration for

you, for your craft, and for what

you have done for this country.

LEADER

It is also because I know you,

Finch.  I know what you are.

You're a man like me.  A man who

understands when they are given a

job what must be done.  I

understand you, Finch, and that is

why I can trust you.

LEADER

This terrorist knows us, Finch.

These attacks are perfectly

calculated and they are divisive.

He knows what he's doing, Finch.

He knows us all too well.

FINCH

You think he's an insider?

LEADER

What I think is that this man must

be stopped.  Stopped at all costs

and no one, I repeat, no one is to

be placed above suspicion.  Do I

make myself clear?

FINCH

Perfectly.

LEADER

England prevails, Mr. Finch.

FINCH

England prevails.

EVEY

V, v, v, v, v.

V

I hear your summons, my lady.  And

obey.

EVEY

Oh, V, you scared me.

EVEY

I was reading the inscription.

What is it?

V

A Latin quotation.  A motto.  "Vi

veri veniversum vivus vici."  "By

the power of truth, I, while

living, have conquered the

universe."

EVEY

Yes, I suppose you have.  This

place is the only universe I have

right now.

V

Does that bother you?

EVEY

I don't know.  I'm so grateful to

you -- I just feel I should help

you, you know, the way you're

helping me.  I mean, that's the

deal, isn't it?

V

No deals, Evey.  Not unless you

want them.

EVEY

I think I do.  Part of me wants to

stay here forever and never have to

face what's going on outside.  But

that's not right.  Is it?  That's

not taking responsibility.  Not

conquering my universe.

EVEY

I want to help you, V.  I want to

do something.  Can we make a deal?

V

Yes.  I think we can make a deal if

you like.  I think I know a way you

could help me very soon indeed.

EVEY

Good.  That's that, then.

EVEY

V, you said that Latin thing was a

quote.  Who said it?

V

Nobody you'd have heard of.  A

German gentleman named Dr. John

Faust.

V

He made a deal too.

CONRAD

Hello, Rosemary.  Derek, how --

HELEN

Derek!

HELEN

Darling, how are you?  Hello,

Rosemary.

ROSEMARY

Hello.

DEREK

It's so good to see you.  Since

this bloody terrorist business, the

old man has me literally chained to

the office.

HELEN

Oh, you poor dear.

DEREK

It comes with the job.  How are

things in the Eye, Conrad?

CONRAD

Well, we've been working some bugs

out of the new Mark IX fiber optic

network, actually --

HELEN

Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody

bore.  Do tell us about the

terrorist, Derek.  Is it true he

blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?

DEREK

I'm afraid so.  We're dealing with

a pathological psychotic in the

most extreme case.  We'll catch him

though.  I promise.

HELEN

Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting.

Aren't you glad you've got such a

ruthless, implacable brute for a

husband, Rosemary?

ROSEMARY

Yes, well --

HELEN

Believe me, you're lucky.  You

could be struck with a professional

peeping tom like Conrad.  England's

highest paid voyeur, aren't you

darling?

CONRAD

Helen, I think we'd better --

HELEN

Oh yes, of course.  We have to get

back so the little pervert can

watch what the neighbors do after

Sunday lunch.  He's so exciting.

HELEN

Ciao!

DEREK

Goodbye, Helen.  Conrad.

ROSEMARY

She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?

DEREK

Until you're half the woman of

Helen's sophistication, I'd keep

your little mouth shut.

DEREK

Really, just look at the way you

dress.

LILLIMAN

Ah, there they go.  My happy and

contented flock.  Spiritually

refreshed and ready to face the

world again.

LILLIMAN

Did you enjoy the sermon today,

Dennis?

DENNIS

Very inspiring, your grace.  Though

the segue of the forces of Satan

among us did strike me as a bit of

a curious digression.

LILLIMAN

Hmm, yes.  A trifle purple, I

thought.  Still, Fate wanted it

included and who are we to question

the will of the almighty, miserable

sinners that we are?

LILLIMAN

And speaking of sin, I wonder which

of the seven deadlies the good lord

will see fit to tempt me with

today.

DENNIS

Perhaps pride, your grace.

LILLIMAN

I was thinking of something a

little less ethereal.  Has the

young lady arrived?

DENNIS

The agency informed me she'll be

here directly.  However, there was

a mixup.  It's not one of the usual

girls.  She's a little older.

LILLIMAN

Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Not too old, I

trust?

DENNIS

They promise me she's no more than

fifteen.

LILLIMAN

Fifteen, hmm.

LILLIMAN

Ah well, if Job could bear his

disappointments, I suppose I must

have the good grace to bear mine.

Show her in when she arrives.

DENNIS

Yes, your grace.

DENNIS

The young lady, your grace.

LILLIMAN

Oh my!

LILLIMAN

And to think I doubted your

loveliness for even an instant.

Mea culpa, my child, mea culpa.

You are a vision.  An angel.

EVEY

Uh... thank you.

LILLIMAN

Of course, "hate the sin, love the

sinner."  I always say.  Take your

dress off, please.

EVEY

Listen -- I was kind of hoping --

EVEY

No --

LILLIMAN

You -- You filthy whore!

LILLIMAN

I'll kill you, you fucking sow.

LILLIMAN

What's this?  Who --

V

Please allow me to introduce

myself...

V

I'm a man of wealth and taste.

LILLIMAN

Dennis?

V

Shh.  It isn't polite to disturb

the dead on their journey.

V

A courtesy I'll most respectfully

extend to his grace.

EVEY

V?

EVEY

V, what are you doing?

V

Vi veri veniversum vivus vici,

Evey.

EVEY

Oh no.

EVEY

You can't kill him!

V

Death has followed his grace the

whole of his career.  Is it any

coincidence it has finally followed

him here?

EVEY

Oh god, V.  I can't -- I can't --

V

Let us pray.

OPERATOR 1

Bloody hell.  Doesn't anybody fuck

with feeling anymore?

OPERATOR 2

Hey, it's Sunday.  Children's hour

over at the Abbey.

OPERATOR 1

Let's see what that filthy old

pervert is up to.

OPERATOR 1

What the --

VOICE 1

... And I saw a black shape against

the flames.  Oh god.  It's you.

The man from room five.  You've

come --

VOICE 2

To collect what's mine.

VOICE 1

I beg you!  I don't want to die!

Please have mercy!

OPERATOR 1

Get me the Finger.  This is an

emergency!

DOMINIC

No prints yet, sir.  Just like

Prothero.

FINCH

I want those tapes from the Ear in

my office tonight, Dominic.

DOMINIC

Yes, sir.  They're on top of it.

FINCH

Any word from your superior, Mr.

Creedy?

CREEDY

Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be

answering his page, sir.  I'm sure

he's in the field.

FINCH

Quite.

HELEN

There you go, baby.  Now my baby

boy can think so much clearer.

Can't he?

HELEN

You have been thinking, haven't

you?

HELEN

I know you have.  Ever since this

terrorist appeared.

HELEN

Oh jesus, that smile.  That smile

turns me on like nothing else.

HELEN

Tell me.  Tell me what's going on

in that ruthless sadistic brain of

yours.

DEREK

Everyone is so worried about the

terrorist.  Especially Susan.  You

know why?  Because nobody knows

what he's going to do.

DEREK

If I were him, I know what I'd do.

DEREK

I'd blow that fat bastard to

kingdom come.

HELEN

No.  You're kidding.

DEREK

Am I?

DEREK

There's an old train line under the

New Government Building.  It

collapsed when they poured the

foundation.  You could haul in

enough TNT to launch our Leader's

ass all the way to the moon.

HELEN

You're serious, aren't you?

DEREK

You need to be careful, Helen.

Your mouth is going to get you into

trouble one day.

HELEN

Is that the same trouble you love

putting in my mouth?

DEREK

You never know who might be

listening.

HELEN

I know, Derek.  You love your

country and you love your party,

just like you love your wife.

HELEN

Derek.  I'm sorry.  I know I can be

a bitch.  But that's why you're

here, isn't it?

HELEN

This is it, isn't it, Derek?  What

we've been waiting for.  At last,

you'll be rid of Susan.  I'll be

rid of Conrad.  And we'll be free.

Free, won't we?

DOMINIC

Sorry it took so long.  The boys

had a devil of a time trying to

filter out the background noise.

FINCH

Background noise?

DOMINIC

The perpetrator apparently turned

on the Bishop's stereo.

Subsequently, a great deal of the

tape is useless.

FINCH

What music did he play?

DOMINIC

Beethoven.  The fifth, I believe.

FINCH

Da, da, da, dum.  That's code.

Morse code.

DOMINIC

Sir?

FINCH

For the letter "V".

FINCH

Anything on the girl yet?

DOMINIC

No.  The agency said somebody

claiming to be Lilliman's valet

canceled his Sunday appointment.

FINCH

What is it?

DOMINIC

23rd Psalm.

TAPE (V.O.)

Though I walk through the valley of

the shadow of death...

DOMINIC

It goes on like that for a while.

Fairly incoherent except we could

make out a few words in this part.

Transubstantiation.

DOMINIC

That miracle business when the

wafer transform into the body of

Christ.

FINCH

He made him eat a host.

DOMINIC

Yes, listen to this part.

TAPE (V.O.)

... And at the moment this enters

your mouth it becomes the flesh of

the savior?  Yes... please... And

whatever it is made of now it will

become the body of Christ?  Yes...

yes...

TAPE (V.O.)

I want you to swallow it.

DOMINIC

There's a couple of funny human

noises...

FINCH

And then just Beethoven's fifth.

FINCH

We have got the initial path report

back.  The host was full of

cyanide.

FINCH

And do you know what?

FINCH

When it reached his abdomen, it was

still cyanide.

DELIA

Do you have a motive?

DELIA

I mean, was anything taken?

FINCH

Just lives.

FINCH

I know it's too early for your

profile but do you have any initial

impressions?

DELIA

Well...

DELIA

He's incredibly powerful.  This

man's sternum was split like dry

wood from the base all the way up

to the manubrium.

DELIA

And he's resourceful.  On that

table behind you is a breakdown of

all the chemicals found in

Prothero's blood stream.

FINCH

Bloody hell.

DELIA

There were hundreds of different

chemicals in him.  From

trinitrotoluene to estrogen to

motor oil.

FINCH

Perhaps Fate will make something

more of all this.  I certainly

can't.

DELIA

The Leader finally authorized an

uplink for you?  He must be getting

nervous.

FINCH

Quite.  Government directed

terrorism never sews healthy ideas

into the public.  Oh, that reminds

me.

FINCH

Can you tell us anything about

this?

FINCH

We found one in the carriage with

Prothero and this one in the

Bishop's quarters.  A violet

carson.

FINCH

I heard that strain had died off.

Thought a botanist might shed some

light on it.  Delia?

DELIA

Yes -- Yes, of course.

FINCH

Magic.  I'll drop by tomorrow then.

V

"There is more behind and inside of

V than any of us had suspected.

Not who, but what: what is she?"

CREEDY

What's all this, then, Harper?  I

get a radio that a man's down and

in need of assistance?

HARPER

I ain't gone down yet but I sure do

need some assistance.

CREEDY

Are you flat broke already?

LOUT

How'd you sneak away, Creedy?

Almond off buggering that blonde

chippy?

HARPER

The one with the tits?

CREEDY

What I wouldn't give for a piece of

that.

LOUT

She could serve a tray of drinks on

those thingies.

HARPER

I bet you get your chance with her

sooner than later, Creedy, with the

way Almond's crackin' up.

LOUT

Bloody bugger's losing his marbles.

HARPER

Terrorist or no, if that bastard

gives me another double shift, I'll

stomp his fucking head.

CREEDY

Aye.  This nonsense has put a

serious strain on my drinking.  I

think I was actually sober today.

LOUT

I'll drink to that.

HARPER

We need to get a real man of the

people in that director's position.

Like Creedy here.

CREEDY

Well, it's good to know when the

shit hits the fan who your real

friends are.

ROSEMARY

Derek --

DEREK

I don't want to hear it, Rosemary.

ROSEMARY

Derek, please!  We can't carry on

like this.

ROSEMARY

You don't talk to me.  You don't

eat with me.  You don't have sex --

DEREK

I don't have to take any crap from

you!  I have that fat bastard

riding me all day.  I don't want to

listen to you, so shut your fat

gob!

DEREK

And me not wanting to fuck you is

obvious.  Take a look at yourself.

DEREK

Get out of my sight.  I'm cleaning

my gun.

DOMINIC

I got it!

FINCH

A connection?

DOMINIC

Larkhill Resettlement Camp.

Prothero's and Lilliman's

employment records show they both

help positions there at similar

times.

FINCH

What about codename V?

DOMINIC

Most of Larkhill's records were

destroyed for security reasons but

I did uncover an old standard

procedures and operations manual.

DOMINIC

In special case studies, medical

research groups used roman numerals

to identify test inmates.

FINCH

Five is the letter V.  Brilliant,

Dominic.

FINCH

All we need is Larkhill's

employment records.

DELIA

Roses.

DELIA

It's you, isn't it?  You've come to

kill me.

V

Yes.

DELIA

Oh thank god.  Thank god.

FINCH

Oh my god.

FINCH

Oh bloody hell.

DOMINIC

He's killed them all?  It's not

possible.

FINCH

Oh no.

V

Are you afraid?

DELIA

No, no.  I thought I would be, but

I'm not.  I'm --

DELIA

Relieved.

DELIA

Oh god, all these years.  All this

waiting.  And somehow I always knew

you'd come back.

DELIA

When I saw you that night -- the

night you escaped, you were

standing against the flames and you

looked straight at me.

DELIA

I knew then that one day you'd come

looking for me, that you'd find me.

DELIA

What -- what happened at Larkhill.

What we did -- What I did.  That

terrible knowledge, it's been with

me so long.  That I could do things

like that.

DELIA

For years, I blamed it on the

government, on the authority I

could never stand up to.  But

living so long with the knowledge

of what I did has made me

understand otherwise.  I alone was

accountable.

DELIA

There is something wrong with us.

With all of mankind.  With me.

Something evil that made me enjoy

what I did.  Some hideous flaw.

DELIA

We deserve to be culled.  We

deserve it.

ROSEMARY

Derek?  What?

DEREK

Bang.

DEREK

Don't worry, Rose.  I didn't load

it.

DEREK

Not tonight.

DEREK

Almond.  What?!  Where?

DEREK

Oh god, yes!  God, thank you!

CREEDY

You look lost.

CREEDY

Can I buy you a drink?

EVEY

No... I made a mistake.

EVEY

I have to find someone.

CREEDY

Well I didn't like the looks of you

anyway --

RADIO (V.O.)

All units, all units.  Code red.

Converge in Plaistow to apprehend

codename V.

CREEDY

Bloody hell!

CREEDY

It's him!  We got him!

DELIA

It's funny, I was given one of your

roses today.  I wasn't sure you

were the terrorist until I saw it.

DELIA

What a strange coincidence.  That I

should be given it today.

V

There are no coincidences, Delia.

Only the illusion of coincidence.

V

I have another rose.  This one is

for you.

DELIA

Then you are going to kill me now?

V

I killed you ten minutes ago.

While you slept.

DELIA

Is there any pain?

V

No.  No pain.

DELIA

Thank you.

DELIA

Can I -- Can I see your face again?

DELIA

It's beautiful...

DEREK

Don't move an inch, you bloody

bastard.

DEREK

You didn't hear me arrive, did you?

Didn't know we'd rumbled you?

DEREK

It's all finished, chummy.  All of

it.  The old man told me it was my

head or yours and what do you know.

It's yours.

DEREK

Because you're standing over there

with your bloody stupid knives and

your fancy karate gimmicks --

DEREK

And I've got a gun.

DEREK

Bang.

DEREK

Who -- Who are you?

V

Yes, look.  Look and tell me what

you see.

DEREK

Horrible!  God, it's horrible!

FINCH

Delia?

FINCH

Get an ambulance.

EVEY

Oh no... V?

DOMINIC

I'm sorry, sir.  You knew the

doctor pretty well?

DOMINIC

We found this on her bureau, sir.

It's Dr. Surridge's journal.  It

covers her years at Larkhill.  It

might contain the whole story.

DELIA (V.O.)

May 23rd...

DELIA (V.O.)

Prothero has hand picked my

subjects.  Four dozen of them, none

of which will be any use to me if I

don't get to work soon.

DELIA (V.O.)

They're so weak and pathetic I find

myself hating them.

DELIA (V.O.)

They don't fight or struggle.  Just

stare at you with weak eyes.

PROTHERO

Next.

DELIA (V.O.)

June 9th: Of the original four

dozen, over 75% are now deceased.

Strangely, no clear patterns have

emerged as of yet.

DELIA (V.O.)

Batch 5 seems to have no common

discernible effect on any specific

group though the men seem slightly

more resilient than the women.

DELIA (V.O.)

I'm hoping the survivors will

provide more answers or my time

here will have gone to waste.

DELIA (V.O.)

June 18: And only five left now.

Two men and three women.  Which

tends to contradict my entry on the

9th.

DELIA (V.O.)

The man in room five is a

fascinating case.

DELIA (V.O.)

Physically, there doesn't seem to

be anything wrong with him.  No

cellular anomalies, nothing.

DELIA (V.O.)

Batch five, however, seems to have

brought on some kind of psychotic

breakdown.  He's quite insane.

DELIA (V.O.)

He has this way of looking through

you.  Reverend Lilliman won't go

near him.  He claims that it is the

devil in room five.  I see him

cross himself whenever he passes

his door.  Still, there's something

about him...

DELIA (V.O.)

I'm glad Prothero let room five

have a go at the gardening project.

He is quite proficient.  Prothero

was reluctant to allow an inmate

access to the tool and chemical

supply at first but now the fat

toad is delighted.  The crop has

almost doubled.

DELIA (V.O.)

He also grows roses.  Beautiful

roses.

DELIA (V.O.)

December 24th: I was in the mess.

It was about half past ten when we

heard the first explosion.

DELIA (V.O.)

The ones at the front ran straight

into the gas.  It was horrible.

DELIA (V.O.)

A few of us made it out through the

rear door.  You could hear men

screaming everywhere.  I hate the

sound of men screaming.

DELIA (V.O.)

In the center of the camp,

everything was on fire.  Everyone

running in all directions.  We had

hardly enough time to get our

bearings when the ovens exploded.

DELIA (V.O.)

It was the man in room rive.  I

couldn't have known.  The chemical

supplies, grease solvents, ammonia,

fertilizer.  He'd been making

things with them.

DELIA (V.O.)

Mustard gas...

DELIA

And napalm.

DELIA (V.O.)

And in the yard, I saw him.  He had

the flames behind him.  He was

naked.

DELIA (V.O.)

He looked at me...

DELIA (V.O.)

As if I were an insect.  Oh god.

As if I were something mounted on a

slide.

DELIA (V.O.)

He looked at me.

FINCH

That's the last entry until six

months later when Dr. Surridge is

back in London.  There is no

mention of the man in room five

again.  End of story.

FINCH

Except that it wasn't the end of

the story.

FINCH

Between 2009 and 2012, over forty

men and women who were previously

stationed at Larkhill met with what

were believed to be accidental

deaths.  Eventually, only three

remained.

FINCH

The three he'd been saving until

last.

FINCH

Everyone who worked at Larkhill.

Everyone who could have identified

him.  You see there are two

possible motives here.  Not one.

FINCH

The first is revenge.  He escapes

from Larkhill and vows to get even

with his tormentors.  The whole

exercise an elaborate, chilling

vendetta.

FINCH

That's the explanation that I find

most reassuring, funnily enough.

Because that means he's finished.

It's over now.

FINCH

The second motive is more sinister.

Like I said, everyone who could

have identified him is dead.

FINCH

What if he's just been clearing the

ground?

FINCH

What if he's planning something

else?

FINCH

You see, the diary we found was in

full view.  We didn't have to

search for it.  He left it there.

He wanted us to find it.  He wanted

us to know the story.  Or...

FINCH

For all we know, the diary could be

a complete and utter fake.

Codename V could have written it

himself.

FINCH

He's playing games with us.  He

might never have been at Larkhill

at all.  Do you see?  It could all

be another smoke screen, a false

trail, another cover story --

LEADER

Enough!

LEADER

Mr. Finch, would you please explain

to me the nature of this meeting?!

Because I was under the impression

that you had some information about

the terrorist, codename V!

LEADER

No more questions, understand!  I

want answers!  I am not interested

in where he grew up, what kind of

flowers he likes or his favorite

color!

LEADER

Do I make myself clear?

FINCH

Yes, Leader.

LEADER

Dismissed.  England prevails, Mr.

Finch.

LEADER

Mr. Finch, the girl.  Do you have

anything on the girl?

FINCH

No, Leader.  Not yet.

MAN

Wake up, cow.

GUARD 1

Tsk.  This pathetic whore is the

famous Miss Hammond?

EVEY

You've made a mistake.

ROSSITER

Shut up.

EVEY

Please.  I haven't done anything --

ROSSITER

I said shut your hole!

INTERROGATOR

Do you know why you're here.  Evey

Hammond?

EVEY

No, please, I didn't do anything.

INTERROGATOR

Allow me to be more precise.  Did

you participate in the murder of

Dr. Delia Surridge?

EVEY

No.

INTERROGATOR

Did you participate in the murder

of Derek Almond, director of the

Finger?

EVEY

No, I --

INTERROGATOR

Did you participate in the murder

of Bishop Anthony Lilliman?

EVEY

Oh god, I don't --

INTERROGATOR

Have you ever participated in a

terrorist act against your country?

EVEY

No --

INTERROGATOR

What is the identity of codename V?

EVEY

I don't know.

INTERROGATOR

You are a lying cunt.

EVEY

They were going to rape me, kill

me --

ROSSITER

Shut up.

INTERROGATOR

This board will not tolerate any

more of your lies, Miss Hammond.

We have over 120 minutes of audio

and videotape and 75 pages of

testimonials from eye witness that

identify you as an accomplice to

the terrorist, codename V.

INTERROGATOR

Do you want to know why you're

here?  You are formally being

brought up on charges of murder on

fourteen counts and sedition

against your Leader and country

which brings an automatic sentence

of death.

EVEY

Please.  I didn't do anything.

INTERROGATOR

Process the prisoner and return her

to her cell until she is more

cooperative.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

EVEY (V.O.)

I read her letter.  Hid it.  Slept.

Woke.  They questioned me.  And I

read her letter again.

EVEY (V.O.)

Over and over...

EVEY (V.O.)

Her name was Valerie.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I was born in a rainy burg in

Nottingham in 1975.  I passed my

eleven plus and went to girl's

grammar.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I met my first girlfriend at

school.  Her name was Sara.  Her

wrists.  Her wrists were beautiful.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I sat in biology class staring at

the pickled rabbit fetus while Mr.

Herd said it was an adolescent

phase that people outgrew.

VALERIE (V.O.)

Sara did.  I didn't.

VALERIE (V.O.)

In 1994, I stopped pretending and

took a girl called Christine home

to meet my parents.

VALERIE (V.O.)

A week later I moved to London to

go to college and study drama.  My

mother said I broke her heart.

VALERIE (V.O.)

But it was my integrity that was

important.  Is that so selfish?  It

sells for so little but it's all we

have left in this place...

VALERIE (V.O.)

It is the very last inch of us...

VALERIE (V.O.)

But within that inch we are free.

INTERROGATOR

Enough.

INTERROGATOR

Now Miss Hammond, let us review the

facts.

INTERROGATOR

You work for codename V.  Codename

V killed Delia Surridge and then

Derek Almond with your help and

that is why you were found outside

her home.

INTERROGATOR

Isn't that what happened, Miss

Hammond?

EVEY

No.  No, that isn't true --

INTERROGATOR

Oh dear, Rossiter?

EVEY

No, wait!

VALERIE (V.O.)

London.  I was happy in London.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I played Dandini in Cinderella.

VALERIE (V.O.)

The world was strange and rustling

with invisible crowds behind the

hot lights and all that breathless

glamour.

VALERIE (V.O.)

Work improved.  I got small film

roles, then bigger ones.

VALERIE (V.O.)

In 2006, I starred in "The Salt

Flats."  That's where I met Ruth.

We fell in love.

VALERIE (V.O.)

Every Valentine's Day she sent me

roses and, oh god, we had so much.

Those were the best three years of

my life.

VALERIE (V.O.)

In 2010, they came.

VALERIE (V.O.)

And after that there were no more

roses...

VALERIE (V.O.)

Not for anybody.

VALERIE (V.O.)

After the takeover, they started

rounding up the gays.  They took

Ruth while she was out looking for

food.

VALERIE (V.O.)

Why are they so frightened of us?

VALERIE (V.O.)

They burned her face with

cigarettes and made her give them

my name.  She signed a statement

saying I'd seduced her.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I didn't blame her.  God, I loved

her but I didn't blame her.

VALERIE (V.O.)

But she did.

VALERIE (V.O.)

She killed herself in her cell.

She couldn't live with betraying

me, with giving up that last inch.

Oh, Ruth.

VALERIE (V.O.)

They came for me.  They shaved off

my hair.  They held my head down a

toilet and told lesbian jokes.

They brought me here and pumped me

full of chemicals.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I can't feel my tongue.  I can't

speak.

VALERIE (V.O.)

It is strange that my life should

end in such a terrible place but

for three years I had roses and

apologized to nobody.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I shall die here.  Every inch of me

shall perish...

VALERIE (V.O.)

Except one.

VALERIE (V.O.)

An inch.  It is small and fragile

and it's the only thing in the

world that's worth having.

VALERIE (V.O.)

We must never lose it or sell it or

give it away.  We must never let

them take it from us.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I don't know who you are but I hope

you escape this place.  I hope that

the world turns and things get

better and that one day people have

roses again.

VALERIE (V.O.)

I don't know who you are but I love

you.  I love you.  Valerie.

EVEY (V.O.)

I had come to know every inch of

those four walls in that dark hell

and they knew every inch of me.

Every inch...

EVEY (V.O.)

Except one.

INTERROGATOR

"My name is Evey Hammond.  On the

5th of November 2019, I was

abducted by the terrorist known as

codename V and then taken against

my will to an unknown location."

INTERROGATOR

"Once there, I was systematically

brainwashed by means physical and

psychological.  I was frequently

subjected to sexual abuse during

this period."

INTERROGATOR

"Eventually I was terrorized into

helping him commit the murders of

Derek Almond, Dr. Delia Surridge,

and Anthony Lilliman, Bishop of

Westminster."

INTERROGATOR

"I, the undersigned, swear that the

above statement is genuine and that

it was not signed by means of

intimidation."

INTERROGATOR

We'd like you to sign that for us,

Miss Hammond.  Where we've put the

little cross.

EVEY

No.

INTERROGATOR

As you wish.

INTERROGATOR

Escort Miss Hammond back to her

cell, Rossiter, where she will wait

while you arrange a wet detail of

six men.

INTERROGATOR

Then take her out behind the

chemical sheds and shoot her.

ROSSITER

It's time, unless you want to

change your mind.

ROSSITER

Sign that statement.  You could be

out inside three years.  Perhaps

they'd find you a job with the

Finger.

EVEY

Thank you but I'd rather die behind

the chemical sheds.

ROSSITER

Then there's nothing left to

threaten you with, is there?  You

are free.

EVEY

What?

V

Welcome home, Evey.

EVEY

You...

EVEY

You did this... to me.

EVEY

You did this to me!

EVEY

You -- You hit me and -- and cut my

hair.  It was you.  It was just you

all this time.

EVEY

You tortured me.  You tortured me --

EVEY

Oh god, why?

V

Because I love you, Evey.  Because

I wanted to set you free.

EVEY

Love?

EVEY

Set me free?  Don't you realize?

EVEY

Don't you realize what you did to

me?  You nearly drove me mad!

EVEY

I hate you.

EVEY

I hate you!  Set me free?  You put

me in a prison to set me free?!

V

You were already in a prison.

You've been in a prison all your

life.

EVEY

Shut up!  I don't want to hear it.

I wasn't in a prison.  I was happy!

I was happy here --

V

Happiness is the most insidious

prison of all, Evey.

EVEY

That's warped!  That's evil and

it's wrong!  What gives you the

right to judge?  Who are you to say

what's not good enough?!

V

You were born in a prison, Evey.  I

didn't put you there.  I just

showed you the bars.  You've been

in a prison so long, you no longer

believe there's an outside world.

EVEY

Shut up!  You're mad!  I don't want

to hear it!

V

That's because you're afraid, Evey.

You're afraid because you can feel

freedom closing in on you.  You're

afraid because freedom is

terrifying.

EVEY

I can't feel anything!  There's

nothing left to feel!  Don't you

understand?

V

Don't back away from it, Evey.

Part of you understands the truth

even as part pretends not to.

V

Woman, this is the most important

moment in your life.  Don't run

from it.

EVEY

I don't know what -- Oh god -- I

can't breathe --

V

Good.  You're almost there.  Go

closer.  Feel the shape of it.

EVEY

What are you doing to me?  I can't

breathe --

V

You were in a cell.  They offered

you a choice between the death of

your principles and the death of

your body.

EVEY

I feel -- I feel like I'm going to

burst.

V

You said you'd rather die.  You

faced the fear of your own death

and you were calm.  Try to feel now

what you felt then.

EVEY

Oh god -- I felt --

EVEY

Like an angel --

EVEY

Oh god, V, I'm so scared.  What's

happening to me?

V

The door of the cage is open, Evey.

All that you feel is the wind from

outside.  Don't be afraid.

V

Try to walk.  The lift will take us

to the roof.

EVEY

The roof?  Outside?

EVEY

I -- I don't want to be

blindfolded.

V

No, Evey.  No more blindfolds.

V

Do you feel it?

EVEY

Everything's so -- different.

V

I know.  Five years ago, I too

stared beneath a night like this.

Naked under a roaring sky.

V

The night is yours, Evey.  Seize

it.  Encircle it within your arms.

V

Bury it in your heart up to the

hilt.

V

Become transfixed and

transfigured --

V

Forever.

DASCOMBE

Finch!

Do you know what this is all about?

FINCH

No, but I can guess.

DASCOMBE

What?

FINCH

"Remember, remember, the fifth of

November."

DASCOMBE

Oh come on.  He's long gone.  He

has to be.  He did what he came to

do and it's over.

DASCOMBE

Isn't it?

FINCH

Not for us.

FADE OUT.

LEADER (V.O.)

A year, gentlemen.

LEADER

I have given you almost a year and

you have given me nothing.

Nothing!

DASCOMBE

Now Adam, there is no one better

than Finch and you know it.

LEADER

Yes, Mr. Dascombe, I do know it.

It is that very fact that keeps me

awake at night, wondering if

perhaps there is a reason that Mr.

Finch has failed.

FINCH

What are you saying?

LEADER

I'm saying that perhaps I don't

know you as well as I thought I

did.

FINCH

Are you asking for my resignation?

LEADER

No, I am asking for some goddamn

results!

DASCOMBE

It's not Finch's fault, Adam.

CONRAD

We've all been looking.  The man

simply disappeared.

ETHERIDGE

Vanished.

DASCOMBE

He's gone, Adam.  It's over.

LEADER

It's over, is it?  He's gone.

Vanished, you say?

LEADER

Transcripts recorded over the last

thirty days in which the terrorist

was talked about or mentioned in a

positive context.  This is only

thirty days!

LEADER

Is this what you consider,

"disappeared?"

DASCOMBE

For god's sake, Adam, it's a stupid

variety show.

LEADER

Mr. Creedy, I want the producers,

writers, and actors of that "stupid

variety show" arrested and charged

with sedition.

CREEDY

Yes, sir.

DASCOMBE

You can't be serious --

LEADER

Push me, Roger, push me and you'll

find out how serious I am.

LEADER

This, this V is still out there.  I

can feel him like a sickness

worming its way into the hearts and

minds of the public.  Something

must be done, and done quickly, to

exorcise this demon for the very

soul of this country is at stake.

LEADER

That is why I am compelled to give

each and every one of you notice

that if by the fifth of November

you are still giving me nothing

more than excuses, I will have to

revoke your party status and

terminate your positions.

LEADER

Mr. Creedy, I will speak with you

in private.  The rest of you are

dismissed.  England prevails.

LEADER

Mr. Creedy, as the new head of the

Finger, you are the most important

member of my cabinet.

CREEDY

I, uh, appreciate your faith in me.

LEADER

Your predecessor, Mr. Almond, was a

good man, a man who understood what

strength in unity meant, a man who,

above all, loved his country.  I

need to know if you are such a man.

LEADER

Do you love your country, Mr.

Creedy?

CREEDY

Oh god, yes!

HELEN

"The most important member of my

cabinet."  Yes it is, isn't it,

dear?

CREEDY

Oh, don't stop.

HELEN

I stop when you stop.  What did he

say next?

CREEDY

I can't --

HELEN

Come on, Peter, what are you afraid

of?  Almond used to tell me

everything and you're twice the man

he was.

CREEDY

He asked me... if I loved my

country.

HELEN

Oh yes, I can tell you do love your

country, almost as much as you love

this...

CREEDY

Oh god...

HELEN

Go on.

CREEDY

Then he asked me to do something...

oh, oh...

HELEN

What?

CREEDY

Helen, I can't.  I can't tell you.

HELEN

He told you to frame someone as the

terrorist.

CREEDY

My god?!  How did you know that?

HELEN

I know Adam Susan.  Now who was it?

CREEDY

No way.  I can't tell you that.

HELEN

Yes you can, honey.  You can and

you will.  You have to trust me,

love.  We're going to help each

other.

CREEDY

Helen, please.

HELEN

Look at that face.  You see?

You're just bursting to tell me.

HELEN

Now who was it?

CREEDY

It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!

EVEY

That was beautiful.

EVEY

I've wanted to do this for a long

time.

EVEY

Thank you, V.  Thank you for

everything you've done for me.

V

You did it all yourself, Evey.  I

just provided the backdrop but the

drama was all your own.

EVEY

It was a good backdrop.  I believed

it.  I really did.  It's still a

bit hard for me to accept that it

wasn't real.  That it was just you.

Especially the letter.

EVEY

It is a beautiful letter, V.  Every

time I read it I could feel

Valerie, almost like she was

holding me.  I believed in her most

of all.  I believed that she loved

me and I loved her back.

EVEY

I feel a bit foolish telling you

this.  I know that you must have

written it and thought you should

have it back.

V

But I didn't write that letter,

Evey.

EVEY

What?

V

Come with me.

EVEY

Valerie?

V

Yes.  Valerie Page.  She was the

woman in room four.

EVEY

She's beautiful.

V

She wrote the letter just before

she died.  I delivered it to you as

it was delivered to me.  The words

you wept over were the same words

that transformed me.

EVEY

Roses.  You grew them for her.

V

Yes.

EVEY

They're beautiful.

V

Evey, do you know what day it is?

EVEY

Two days before the first day we

met.

V

You remembered.

EVEY

You're planning something, aren't

you, V?

V

You know me too well now.

EVEY

What are you going to do?

V

I'm going to fulfill an old

promise.

V

I'll show you.

EVEY

I've never been here before.

V

Yes.  It is the deepest part of my

home.  Once you know it, I should

think you'll know everything.

EVEY

Oh, V, it's lovely.  Where on earth

did you find it?

V

In a way, I suppose it really found

me.

EVEY

What's in these packages?

V

Gelignite.

V

Careful.

EVEY

What are you going to do with all

of it?

V

I told you.  I'm going to finish

what was started four hundred years

ago.

EVEY

Where does this train go?

V

This is the old Victoria line but

it is blocked, blocked somewhere

between Whitehall and St. James.

EVEY

Whitehall... V, that's the New

Government Building.

EVEY

But the underground has been shut

down for years.  How are you going

to make it run without any power?

V

I just thought I might ask them to

turn it on for me.

LEADER

Yes, Mr. Creedy?

CREEDY

Everything's set, sir.  No worries.

LEADER

When?

CREEDY

Tonight.

ANNOUNCER

Tonight on Tales from the Bible, a

story of treachery and betrayal

from the Book of Daniel.

DASCOMBE

All of London's waiting.  Ready,

two.  And here we go --

ANNOUNCER

Tonight, England's greatest hero

repels the forces of darkness in a

brand new episode.

HEIDI

Oh, Storm.  Save me!  Save me!

STORM

You mongrel trash, if you harm her!

MONGREL TRASH

Look out, de white debil has a

laser lugar!

GUARD

Hey, what the -- ?

HEIDI

Oh Storm, hold me.  Hold me tight.

FINCH

I don't know how you stand that

tripe.

DOMINIC

Es gooh.

DOMINIC

Finch?  Finch, what's wrong?

DOMINIC

What the hell?

FINCH

Don't you see, Dominic?

FINCH

I'm V.

GUARD

Bloody hell!

GUARD

Freeze!

GUARD

Fuck all.

DOMINIC

Creedy?  What the hell's going on?

CREEDY

I'm here to arrest Mr. Finch for

acts of treason and terrorism.

DOMINIC

You can't be serious.

CREEDY

If I were you, boy, I'd shut my

hole unless you want to start

explaining why you didn't say

nothing about Mr. Finch's secret

identity.

FINCH

Why don't you just shoot me,

Creedy?  Wouldn't that make

everything a lot simpler?

CREEDY

Yeah, I suppose it would.

DOMINIC

Holy Christ!  Creedy, you stupid

ape!  If Finch is V then tell me

who is that?

V

Good evening, London.

CREEDY

Bloody fuckin' hell.

V

I thought it was time we had a

little talk.

FINCH

He has to be at Jordan tower.  Come

on!

CREEDY

Don't just stand there!  Follow

them!

V

Are you sitting comfortably?  Good.

Then I'll begin.

LEADER

Damn you!  Damn you!

LEADER

Lieutenant, ready my transport.  I

want every armed man within a

hundred miles at Jordan tower.

Now!

V

Right now, I imagine there are

hundreds of soldiers rushing here

to kill me because someone does not

want us to talk.

MOTHER

Hush.  Turn it up.

V

They are afraid that I am going to

say the things that are not

supposed to be said.  They are

afraid that I am going to say the

truth.

V

The truth is that there is

something terribly wrong with this

country, isn't there?  If you look

about, you witness cruelty,

injustice and despotism.  But what

do you do about it?  What can you

do?

V (V.O.)

You are but a single individual.

How can you possible make any

difference?  Individuals have no

power in this modern world.

That is what you've been taught

because that is what they need you

to believe.  But it is not true.

V

This is why they are afraid and the

reason that I am here; to remind

you that it is individuals who

always hold the power.  The real

power.  Individuals like me.  And

individuals like you.

V

I have come to offer you a deal.

If you accept, I will give you a

different world.  A world without

curfews, without soldiers and

surveillance systems.  A world that

is not run by other men but that is

run by you.  I am offering you a

second chance.

V

Four hundred years ago, a great

citizen made a most significant

contribution to our common culture.

It was a contribution forged in

secrecy and stealth although it is

best remembered in noise and bright

light.

V

To commemorate that glorious night

at precisely the stroke of

midnight, the edifice of their

world will erupt with enough sound

and fury to shake the earth.  All I

ask is that you join me at the

gates to watch as the past is

erased, the pathway cleared so that

together we can start toward a new

day.

LEADER

I want this man dead!  I want him

shot on sight!

CAPTAIN

Yes, sir.

V (V.O.)

But, you ask, who am I to make such

promises?  A fair question but

hardly necessary as you know me

already.  To know me any more you

need only look to a mirror.

V

Truth be told, this wasn't even my

idea, was it?  If you think back,

you'll remember that night,

whispering in your lover's arms.  I

became a part of your plan just as

you have now become part of mine.

Give me the line of the queen and

I'll give you your secret dream.

V (V.O.)

On the twelfth stroke of the fifth

day of the eleventh month, I hope

we shall all meet again.

V

Until then, I bid you goodnight.

LEADER

Who was it?  Who was he?

LEADER

Roger Dascombe!  Of course.  Of

course!  It makes such perfect

sense.

CAPTAIN

Sir, I think there has been a

mistake.

LEADER

No!  There is no mistake!

CAPTAIN

But sir, there are people that say

they saw both the terrorist and

Dascombe together --

LEADER

Who?  Who are these people?  They

must be detained immediately.

Whatever they saw or whatever they

think they saw is subordinate to

the truth and that truth is that

Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and

the terrorist is dead!

FINCH

But I thought I was the terrorist.

LEADER

Finch, what are you doing here?

FINCH

Since I'm not in jail and since you

have another, even more convenient

suspect.  I'm guessing the charges

have been dropped.

LEADER

Be careful, Finch.

FINCH

I am careful, sir.  Always.  That

is why I suggest that a search of

this building begin immediately.

LEADER

The terrorist is dead!

FINCH

With all due respect, I disagree

and I believe that he is presently

trying to get out of this building

disguised as one of us.

LEADER

Are you challenging my authority?

FINCH

No sir, I'm trying to run an

investigation --

LEADER

I am trying to run a country!  When

I tell you, Mr. Finch, the

terrorist is dead, then the

terrorist is dead!  If you continue

to suggest otherwise then you will

leave me no choice but to have you

arrested on charges of sedition.

Do I make myself clear?

LEADER

Now, it is imperative for the

people of London to know that they

are safe, that the terrorist is

dead and everything is under

control.

SPEAKERS

The terrorist is dead.  No further

threat exists.  Everything is under

control.

LITTLE GIRL

Bollocks.

LITTLE GIRL

Bollocks!

LITTLE GIRL

He's not dead!  It's all bollocks!

V

... if you give me the line of the

queen, I'll give you your secret

dream.

FINCH

Play it again.

DOMINIC

Come on, Finch.  We've seen it

fifty times.  I mean, after what

they done to you, I don't know why

we're even trying to stop him.

FINCH

I don't know.  For twenty seven

years, I've been at this job.

Twenty seven years, I've done what

I've been told to do.  Maybe that's

all there is to it.  I'm just a

dumb old dog.  A dumb old dog that

only knows one trick.

DOMINIC

That ain't it, Finch.  It's more

than that.  I know you.  It's

something personal with this one.

FINCH

Maybe.  And maybe I'm not ready for

a revolution.

DOMINIC

Well, we got less than thirty hours

to stop it.

FINCH

We will.

DOMINIC

How?

FINCH

It's on the tape.  I know it.  I

can feel it.  He did this for a

reason.  He needs something.

DOMINIC

What?

FINCH

The line of the Queen?

DOMINIC

But what does that mean?

FINCH

Maybe it's a line from Shakespeare.

Or a book.  I don't know.

V

... This wasn't even my idea, was

it?

FINCH

But right here.  He's talking to

someone.  Someone specific.

Someone who knows what he wants.

V

If you think back, you'll --

V

Remember that night, whispering in

your lover's arms.

CONRAD

Helen?  Helen, why did you want

that tape?

HELEN

Shut up, Conrad.  I'm thinking.

V

... now you've become a part of

mine.

HELEN

How?  How did you know that?

CONRAD

Know what, my love?

V

Give me the line of the Queen and

I'll give you your secret dream.

HELEN

All right.  You have a deal.

HELEN

Oh no!  Not you.  Conrad.  Not yet.

Here you can have a chocolate.

Open up.  Open!

HELEN

Good boy.  As for the rest of the

box, perhaps when you're Leader.

HELEN

Right now I need something else

Conrad.  I need you to use that

pretty little brain for me.  You

know all about the old underground,

don't you?

HELEN

I need to know everything,

understand?  Everything.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

Ready in five, Leader.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

In four, three...

LEADER

Good evening London.  As Leader of

this great country, I felt it

imperative to speak with you and to

assure you once and for all that

the shadow that recently fell

across our land has indeed passed.

WOMAN

Oh, for fuck's sake.

LEADER

What we have endured this long year

was no accident, no mere

coincidence.  This was not a simple

act of terror conducted by a

singular madman.  No, this was a

test.

LEADER

It was not me, nor the Party, nor

the government that was threatened

this year.  It was our beliefs.

Our faith.  I believe that God

himself bore witness to our

struggle and like Job I believe

that we have been vindicated.

DRUNK

Remember fifth of November!

LEADER

How do I know this?  Let me read to

you where I found the answer, where

I so often find the answer.  In the

Scripture.  Revelations.

LEADER (V.O.)

"If any man have an ear, let him

hear."

LEADER (V.O.)

"He that leadeth into captivity

shall go into captivity; he that

killeth with the sword shall be

killed with the sword.  Here is the

patience and faith of the Saints."

LEADER (V.O.)

"And I beheld another beast coming

out of the Earth; and he had two

horns like a lamb and he spake as a

dragon."

LEADER (V.O.)

"And he doeth great wonders, so

that he maketh fire come down from

Heaven on the Earth in the sight of

men."

LEADER (V.O.)

"And he deceiveth them that dwell

on the Earth by the means of those

miracles which he had the power to

do --"

EVEY

Oh, V, turn it off, please.

V

Of course, my dear.

CREEDY (V.O.)

But how does he know?

HELEN (V.O.)

I don't know.  All I know is he

does... And I know what he wants.

EVEY

What is that, V?

V

That, Evey, is what I have been

waiting for.

CREEDY (V.O.)

Do you know what I want?  I want

you just like this... Bent over

that black leather chair...

CREEDY

What about Conrad?

HELEN

I told you, I'll handle Conrad and

V will take care of Susan.  The mob

will take care of the guard and

then... You can use the Finger to

take over.

CREEDY

Use the Finger?  You mean like

this?

HELEN

Oh... oh... that is vulgar...

CREEDY

But you like it?

HELEN

Yes, oh yes, oh you're a pig,

Peter...

CREEDY

That I am, misses.  But I'm the pig

that's gonna be running this

country.

HELEN

Yes and I'm... I'm going to be

Eva... Oh Eva...

HELEN

"Don't cry for me Argen... oh

Argen... Argen... tina!

FINCH

Eighteen hours.

FINCH

Dominic!

FINCH

Dominic, go home.

DOMINIC

But I've still got over three

hundred lines from The Fairy Queen.

FINCH

Forget it.  There's no more time.

You go home and get some rest.

You're going to need it tonight.

DOMINIC

He's got us, doesn't he, Finch?

FINCH

Yes, he does.

HELEN

Now listen to me, Conrad.  This is

the most important moment of our

lives.  Everything I've worked and

hoped for comes to this.  Susan is

a very dangerous man, especially

now, that's why I need you, Conrad.

I need you to be stronger than him.

I need you to be the better man.

Understand?

HELEN

If you do this Conrad, and you do

it right, I'm going to turn you

from the little man I married into

the man of my dreams.

CONRAD

Oh, Helen.

HELEN

Not on the lips.

FINCH

Give it up, old man.  You're not

even sure you want to stop him.

FINCH

Christ!  That's it!  It's got to be

it!

LIEUTENANT (V.O.)

Sir, Mr. Heyer is here to see you.

Says it's urgent.  And he's here

with his wife, sir.

LEADER

His wife?

LIEUTENANT (V.O.)

Sir, yes, sir -- Wait, you can't

go --

HELEN

Leader, I'm terribly sorry but I

absolutely must speak with you.

HELEN

I have something to tell you,

something important but --

HELEN

I can tell you and only you.  In

private.

HELEN

It is a matter of national

security.

LEADER

Now what's this all about, Mrs.

Heyer?

HELEN

Please, forgive me.  I've been so

afraid, afraid to come here to talk

to you.  I thought he must know.  I

was terrified he knew but I had to

come because I knew you were the

only one that can protect me.

LEADER

Protect you from what?

LEADER

Come now, Mrs. Heyer.

HELEN

You won't let him hurt me, will

you?

LEADER

Let who hurt you?

HELEN

The terrorist.

LEADER

The terrorist is dead.

HELEN

Oh, how I wanted to believe it,

Leader, but I know it's not true.

LEADER

How?

HELEN

Because I know who the terrorist

is.

LEADER

Who?  Who is it, woman?

HELEN

It's Conrad, Leader.  Conrad.  My

husband is the terrorist.

LEADER

What?!

LEADER

How do you know?

HELEN

I saw him, Leader.  In the middle

of the night.  I heard something.

I went to the landing and that's

when I saw it.

HELEN

That mask.  That hideous smiling

mask.

LEADER

But how did you know it was Heyer?

HELEN

I know, Leader.  I know the way a

woman knows.

LEADER

But you have no proof?

HELEN

Proof?

LEADER

Yes, proof?  This is an extremely

delicate situation, Mrs. Heyer.  It

has been reported that the

terrorist is dead.  It would be a

catastrophe to arrest a man now

without concrete, conclusive proof.

Do you have any evidence at all?

LEADER

But if you're right, if Heyer is

indeed the terrorist...

HELEN

Leader!  Wait!

CONRAD

Is everything all right?  Helen?

LEADER

Yes, Mr. Heyer, your wife has done

her duty to her country.

LEADER

Don't worry, Mrs. Heyer.  You will

be taken care of.  I will launch an

immediate investigation and I

promise, you will be the first to

know when an arrest will be made.

CONRAD

Investigation of what?

LEADER

Subversion, Mr. Heyer.  Your wife

was privy to the dialogue of

subversives.  That's all you need

to know at this time.  Lieutenant!

LEADER

The Heyers are leaving.  I need to

see Mr. Creedy at once.

HELEN

Thank you, sir.

HELEN

I want you to go straight to your

office and wait for me to call.

When I do, I want you to come

immediately home.  Understood?

CONRAD

Yes, Helen.

HELEN

Oh, Conrad, I'm so proud of you.

CONRAD

I did it, Helen.  I did it, didn't

I?

HELEN

Tonight, Conrad.

CONRAD

Tonight.

HELEN

I promise you will never forget

tonight.

HELEN

Goodbye, Conrad.

GUARD

Mr. Heyer!  Mr. Heyer!

CONRAD

Yes?

GUARD

Sir, this package arrived for you,

sir.

CONRAD

Thank you.

TAPE (V.O.)

Do you know what I want?  I want

you just like this... bent over

that black leather chair.

FINCH

Oh my god.

TAPE (V.O.)

Use the Finger?... You mean like

this?... Oh... That's vulgar... But

you like it?... Yes... oh yes.

FINCH

Is the Leader in?

LIEUTENANT

Yes, but he's meeting with the

Captain of the Guard.

FINCH

Perfect.

LIEUTENANT

Mr. Finch, you can't go in --

LEADER

Mr. Finch?

FINCH

Leader, I need as many men the

Captain can spare and I need them

right now.

CAPTAIN

What for?

FINCH

To capture codename V.

FINCH

He's underground.  The old subway.

I know exactly what he's going to

do.  If we move quickly, we can be

there, waiting for him.

FINCH

Leader, every second we delay...

LEADER

I'm coming with you.

GUARD

Sir --

LEADER

There will be no discussion --

GUARD

But if Mr. Finch is right --

LEADER

I am sick to death of this

terrorist being everywhere and

nowhere!  I will judge whether Mr.

Finch is right and I will judge it

with my own eyes!  Do I make myself

clear, Captain?

CAPTAIN

Sir, yes, sir!

LEADER

Is there a problem, Mr. Finch?

FINCH

No... no sir.

LEADER

Good.  Captain, mobilize your men.

CAPTAIN

Sir, yes, sir.

LEADER

We'll find this bloody bastard and

we will finish him.

EVEY

V?

V

Yes.

EVEY

V, what's going to happen?

V

Change, Evey.  That's all.  Just

change.

EVEY

Is it going to be violent?

V

Yes, I suppose it will.

EVEY

But why?  Why must is be violent?

V

Because, Evey, that is the nature

of change.  She is a temperamental

creature that appears in earnest

rarely but, when she does, she will

wear one of two faces.  The first

face is the destroyer.  It is

lamentable but all true change

begins with death.

EVEY

What is the other face, V?

V

The other face?  She is the true

face of change.  The face of the

creator.  She is the one that

remakes the world.  Evey?

EVEY

Yes, V?

V

May I ask you for a favor?

EVEY

Of course.

V

It is a small thing but it would

mean a great deal to me.

EVEY

Tell me.

V

I've never danced before.  I've

thought about it many times, here

in this room, listening to the

music.  But I've always been alone.

EVEY

It would be my pleasure.

V

Thank you, Evey.  You are an

excellent dancer.

EVEY

All it takes is a little practice.

V

Alas, I have run out of time.

EVEY

V?  What are you going to do?

V

Don't you remember?  I have a date

tonight, Evey.

EVEY

You're coming back though, aren't

you?

EVEY

V, I won't let you leave unless you

promise me that you will come back.

V

Of course, I'll be back.  You don't

think you can be rid of me now, do

you?

EVEY

Just promise.

V

I promise.

LEADER

Mark my words, Mr. Finch, this man

is going to become an example so

that every man, woman, and child in

this country will remember what

happens to those who would ever

think to stand against the state.

LEADER

Captain, I need a gas unit down

here with enough nerve gas to fill

every rat-hole in these tunnels.

FINCH

I don't think that will be

necessary.

LEADER

There are over one hundred of the

best trained soldiers in this

country down here.  Let him come.

LEADER

Captain, what's happening?

RADIO (V.O.)

No sign sir.  Repeat, no sign of

him.

CAPTAIN

They lost him.

FINCH

This... this is a mistake.

LEADER

Don't tell me you're a coward, Mr.

Finch.

FINCH

Leader, we have to get out of here!

LEADER

This was your idea.

FINCH

It was a mistake.  This is what he

wants.  He knows us, Leader.  He

knows us too well.  We have to get

out of here before it's too late --

V (V.O.)

Good evening citizens of London.

This is the voice of Fate.  Your

fate...

LEADER

What trick is this?

V (V.O.)

Tonight, the face of London is

going to change and I am going to

offer you the chance to change with

her.  Your Leader is finished.  He

will not leave these tunnels alive.

LEADER

This is an outrage!  I order you

not to listen to this!

V (V.O.)

At midnight tonight, the Head will

be destroyed and a new era will

begin.  You must now decide if you

are going to be a part of that era.

V (V.O.)

You can choose to stay here and die

with your Leader or you can choose

to be free.  The decision is yours

and yours alone.

LEADER

Captain, order all your men to fall

back and secure this position!

V (V.O.)

Some of you have wives.  Some of

you have families.  All of you have

lives.  Consider each of them as

you ask yourself, are they a part

of the past, or are they a part of

the future?

CAPTAIN

Fall back.  Fall back and secure

the central platform.

LEADER

Any man that disobeys this order

will be court marshaled!

LEADER

Captain!  Captain, where are your

men?

LEADER

Goddammit, I will not tolerate this

insubordination!  I want those

deserters shot, Captain.

LEADER

Shot on sight!

CAPTAIN

You!  You!  Point position.  We're

getting out of here!  Now!

LEADER

Traitors!  You cowards!

LEADER

I know who you are!  I'll see you

hang!  Every last one of you!

LEADER

Finch?  Finch!  Finch, goddammit,

you can't leave me!  Don't leave

me!

V

You are going to die as you ruled --

V

Alone.

LEADER

Damn you!  Damn you!

LEADER

Conrad?  Is that you?  You're

working with Finch, aren't you?

And Creedy!  You're all in this

together!

LEADER

Who are you?

V

You, most of all, should know,

Leader.  You created me.  Without

you, I would never be.  More than

life, Leader, you gave me purpose.

V

"He that killeth with the sword,

shall be killed with the sword."

LEADER

Noooo!

FINCH

Don't move!

LEADER

Mr. Finch!  Oh god, Mr. Finch!

FINCH

Drop the knife.

LEADER

Oh, I knew it, Mr. Finch.  I knew

you wouldn't desert me.  You're a

good man, Finch.  A damn good man.

FINCH

No, Mr. Susan.  No, I'm not.  I'm a

man who does his job and does what

he's told.  For twenty seven years,

that's all I've been.

LEADER

Careful, Mr. Finch.  He's quick as

the devil.

FINCH

I've read Delia's diary over and

over all year.  It sickens me but I

am unable to judge her.  I am as

guilty as she.

LEADER

Mr. Finch, what are you doing?

Shoot him.  Kill the bastard,

Finch.

FINCH

I have no excuse.  I did what I was

told to do.

LEADER

Finch, I order you to shoot him!

Finch!

FINCH

My job was to find you and catch

you.  I've done my job.  I've done

it for the last time.  I'm tired of

it.  I'm tired of it all.

FINCH

Kill him yourself if you can.

FINCH

Thank you, V.  And goodbye.

V

Goodbye, Mr. Finch.

LEADER

I warned you, Finch, the penalty

for treason is death.

LEADER

Are you ready to die?

V

The real question is, are you?

LEADER

Do you really believe you can pick

up that knife before I pull this

trigger?

V

No.  But I don't have to.

V

You see?  You cannot kill me.

There is no flesh and blood within

this cloak to kill.  There is only

an idea.

V

And ideas are bulletproof.

HELEN

Creedy?  Creedy, you dumb bastard,

you left your car parked in front.

HELEN

What did I tell you?  Creedy.

HELEN

Oh my god.

CONRAD

Helen...

HELEN

Conrad!  What have you done?

CONRAD

I won, Helen.  I did it.  I won.

I'm the better man.

CONRAD

We've been through a bad patch,

Helen.  But now, he's gone...

There's nothing to come between

us...

HELEN

Don't touch me!  You stupid piece

of shit!  You've ruined it!  I had

it all planned perfectly and you've

ruined it!

HELEN

I have to get out of here!  I have

to get away!

CONRAD

Helen --

HELEN

No!  Let go!  Now!

HELEN

Conrad, damn you!  Let me go!

CONRAD

No, Helen, you're not leaving me...

not this time... not ever.

HELEN

No, please!  Oh god, no!  Oh god,

please help me!

CONRAD

No one can help us, Helen.  God is

dead.

EVEY

V?

EVEY

You came back.

EVEY

V!  V!

EVEY

Oh god, what happened?

V

Evey...

EVEY

You need a doctor.

V

It's too late for that...

EVEY

No, don't say that!

V

Evey, listen to me.  I've not long

and there are things that must be

said.

V

I have done that which I came to

do.  Now, it is time for me to rest

and with me the past will, at last,

find peace.

V

But the world, the world is not

saved... Do not think that, when

the fires die and the smoke clears,

there is no miracle... there is

only a path... upon which they must

learn to rule themselves.

EVEY

Yes, they need you, V.

V

Not me, Evey, not me.  I told you I

am the villain.  The destroyer...

But yes, they will need help...

V

I kept my promise to you, Evey...

Now you must promise me.

EVEY

What?

V

Promise me... you will discover the

face under this mask... but you

will never look beneath it.

EVEY

I don't understand.

V

Promise me.  Please...

EVEY

I promise.

V

Sweet Eve.  Wherever I shall go, I

shall always love you.

EVEY

V, you are not going anywhere!

V

Midnight... Midnight.  Eve... Make

them remember...

EVEY

You're not going to die, V!

V

Let me be there, Evey, when it

begins... Please, let me hear the

music, one last time... my music...

EVEY

I won't let you die!

V

I know you won't... I know...

EVEY

V!

V

My love... Ave Atque vale...

SERGEANT

Return to your homes!  There is

nothing to see!  The terrorist is

dead!

RABBLE ROUSER 1

He ain't dead!

RABBLE ROUSER 2

He'll be here, just like he said!

EVEY (V.O.)

I remember... I remember staring at

the mask, at that smile.

EVEY (V.O.)

Part of me couldn't believe he was

dead and maybe that was why.  The

smile was still the same.

It made me want to tear it off so I

could see the face, so I could see

that he was dead.

EVEY (V.O.)

But I had promised.

V (V.O.)

You will discover the face under

this mask but you will never look

beneath it.

EVEY (V.O.)

I began to try to imagine his face.

Of course, I had long pictured my

father behind that smile but I knew

in my heart that V was not my

father.

EVEY (V.O.)

Yet every time I pictured another

face, any face, something was lost,

something important was somehow

diminished.  V was more than a

face.  V was V.

EVEY (V.O.)

And then, quite suddenly, quite

naturally, I realized whose face

must be beneath that mask.  It was

the only face that mattered.

EVEY

I won't let you die.

V (V.O.)

I know you won't... I know.

EVEY

Goodbye, my love.

EVEY (V.O.)

"Ave Atque vale."

EVEY (V.O.)

I looked it up the next morning.

EVEY (V.O.)

"Hail and farewell."

V (V.O.)

"Make them remember..."

EVEY

They will, my love.  They will.

EVEY (V.O.)

"Remember, remember, the fifth of

November!"

EVEY

I have come here tonight to keep a

promise.  A promise that is over

four hundred years old.  Tonight I

am here to give you your freedom!

EVEY

Since mankind's dawn a handful of

oppressors have accepted the

responsibility over our lives,

responsibility that we should have

accepted ourselves.  By doing so,

they took our power.  By doing

nothing, we gave it away.

EVEY

Tonight, our world will change.

Our leaders will be gone and we

must choose what comes next.  A

return to the chains of others or

lives of our own.  A world of the

past or one of the future.

EVEY

Let us choose carefully, London,

and when we do, let us mark well

and remember, remember this fifth

of November!

V (V.O.)

Let me be there, Evey, when it

begins...

V (V.O.)

Please let me hear the music... one

last time... my music.

V (V.O.)

At first, you have to listen

carefully.

V (V.O.)

Ah, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,

is it not?

EVEY

Yes, my love.  Yes it is.

EVEY (V.O.)

I know that there is only one way

to repay him for what he did.

EVEY (V.O.)

And I know that that way is going

to take a lot of hard work.

EVEY (V.O.)

I know this like I know the sun

will rise tomorrow and beneath that

new sun, our work will begin.

FADE OUT.
