SALESWOMAN

This is Mr. Mathison. He's

a doctor.

DR. MATHISON

You okay?

SALESWOMAN

An ambulance is on the way.

DR. MATHISON

Is there a name yet?

WOMAN

Elijah.

WOMAN

Is he supposed to be crying

like that?

WOMAN

Can I have him back?

DR. MATHISON

What happened during the

delivery?

OLDER SALESWOMAN

Nothing. It was very quick.

The baby just wanted to come

right out. There was no

problems.

DR. MATHISON

Did you drop him?

DR. MATHISON

Did you drop this baby?

OLDER SALESWOMAN

Jesus Christ, no.

DR. MATHISON

Please inform the ambulance

we have a situation...

DR. MATHISON

I've never seen this... It

appears your infant

sustained some fractures

while in your uterus.

(beat)

His arms and legs are

broken.

FADE TO BLACK:

ANNOUNCER(o.s.)

Last call track three,

Amtrak Clocker making it's

final stop at Philadelphia's

thirtieth street station.

First two passenger cars

only. First two cars only.

CUT TO:

WOMAN(o.s.)

You alone?

DAVID

Someone left these. You want

one?

DAVID

You like sports?

WOMAN

It's my field. I represent

athletes. I'm an agent.

DAVID

What a coincidence? I'm a

male synchronized swimmer

and I'm looking for

representation.

WOMAN(smiling)

Is that right?

DAVID

But I'm afraid of water, so

that's been holding my

career back a little bit.

DAVID

You represent someone in

Philadelphia?

WOMAN

I'm meeting a player from

Temple University. He's a

cornerback. You like

football?

DAVID

Not really.

WOMAN

This kid is six foot two,

two hundred and forty

pounds. He runs the fifty in

under six seconds. He's

going to be a God.

DAVID

I'm David Dunne.

WOMAN

Kelly.

DAVID

How long are you staying in

Philly?

KELLY(soft)

I'm married.

DAVID(fake excitement)

Great.

KELLY

Sorry.

DAVID(fake confusion)

What are you talking about?

DAVID

I think you got the wrong

idea.

KELLY

I'm going to find another

seat.

You okay, Virginia?

MEGAN

I'll put something on the

almost naked guys to inspire

you.

CUT TO:

MAN IN SCRUBS

How are you feeling?

DAVID

Okay.

MAN IN SCRUBS

You are in the emergency

room of the University of

Pennsylvania Hospital. You

were in a serious accident.

(beat)

How's your vision?

DAVID

Fine.

MAN IN SCRUBS

Where were you sitting on

the train?

DAVID

Against a window.

MAN IN SCRUBS

In the passenger car?

DAVID

Yes. Where are the rest of

the passengers?

MAN IN SCRUBS

Was your family traveling

with you?

DAVID

No.

MAN IN SCRUBS

Did you get up from your

seat?

DAVID

No.

MAN IN SCRUBS

You're certain you were in

the passenger car?

DAVID

Yes... Why are you looking

at me like that?

MAN IN SCRUBS

Your train derailed... Some

kind of malfunction... It

took a curve way to fast. A

second train collided with

yours after it derailed. The

debris is spread over one

mile. It's unbelievable they

said.

(beat)

They only found two people

alive so far... You and him.

MAN IN SCRUBS

The man's skull was cracked

open and most of his left

side was crushed.

MAN IN SCRUBS

And to answer your question,

there are two reasons why

I'm looking at you like

this.

MAN IN SCRUBS

One, because it seems, in a

few minutes, you will

officially be the only

survivor of this train

wreck.

(beat)

And two, because you don't

have a scratch on you. You

didn't break one bone.

CUT TO:

JEREMY

I told you!

JEREMY

They thought everybody on

the train died.

JEREMY

I told them they were wrong.

JEREMY

Mom even cried.

JEREMY

A lot.

MEGAN

Not a lot.

JEREMY

Let's go home.

CUT TO:

DAVID

I don't think I got the job

in New York.

MEGAN

What does that mean?

DAVID

I'm still going to New York.

Just not this second.

MEGAN

I don't want to drag this

out too long for Jeremy.

DAVID

I know.

DAVID

How about in the meantime,

you don't sleep in the

guestroom anymore?

(beat)

You sleep in our room. I'll

sleep down here.

MEGAN

It stopped being our room a

long time ago.

(beat)

You should go up and get

some rest.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Jeremy, why don't you go

sleep with your mom?

JEREMY(eyes closed)

I want to sleep here

tonight.

DAVID

I think it's be better if I

was alone.

JEREMY(eyes closed)

I won't make any noise.

DAVID

How about your room then? If

you get scared like before,

you can come back in here?

CUT TO:

NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)

...Derailed approximately

seven and half miles outside

Philadelphia. It came to

rest on its side on the

northbound tracks. It is

train officials belief that

some if not most of the

passengers were still alive

at this time.

NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)

The momentary peace lasted

only a few seconds. A Boston

bound freight train on the

northbound tracks was

seconds away from passing

train 177 when it derailed.

The impact happened at about

three-fifteen p.m. The first

of the two occupied

passenger cars was severed

in half and sent careening

in two directions. The

second of the passenger cars

was crushed and dragged for

four hundred feet. Six crew

members were on the freight.

One hundred and eighteen

passengers and seven crew

members were on the

passenger train... There is

one reported survivor.

(beat)

Rescue teams will be working

for the next forty-eight

hours removing bodies and

debris.

CUT TO:

DAVID

I used to play football in

college. In my first year as

quarterback, we went on this

winning streak. It just went

on and on. It didn't matter

who we played... I'd always

win.

(beat)

You get superstitious when

something like that happens.

You give things meaning.

Like you wear the same color

socks each game or you

listen to the same B.B. King

song before you leave the

apartment. I wouldn't even

untie the shoelaces on my

cleats. I'd just slip them

on and off so nothing would

change... I gave things

meaning that had no meaning.

(beat)

I'm here to make sure I'm

not making shoelaces into

something they're not again.

(beat)

I was the only person to

survive that accident. The

only one... It feels like it

means something.

PRIEST

Are you a religious man,

David?

PRIEST

Good. Because I'm going to

talk to you as a man. Not as

a man of the cloth.

DAVID

Okay.

PRIEST

It was luck.

DAVID

What do you mean?

PRIEST

Luck... Random... Without

meaning.

PRIEST

Three years ago, my cousin

died on a plane that crashed

on take off at Philadelphia

International airport. Do

you remember that crash?

PRIEST

I prayed and prayed and

finally found some meaning

in the event. It gave me

peace... And then not quite

a year later, an entire

family from my parish burned

to death in a hotel fire

downtown...

(beat)

Again I prayed. Again I

found  meaning.

(beat)

Just two days ago, my nephew

rode with you on that train

back from New York. He was

traveling alone for the

first time.

PRIEST

I'm sorry if I can't react

to your survival with the

appropriate 'It was the hand

of God. It was a miracle.'

kind of answer... I'm fresh

out of those right now.

DAVID(soft)

The metal of the watch I was

wearing was crushed like a

sledge hammer hit it.

PRIEST

My twelve year old nephew's

neck was broken in four

places... What's your point?

You were chosen?

I don't think so.

No sir he is not.

Oh.

ANCIENT SECRETARY

I was in an accident once

too. A horse almost trampled

me to death.

DAVID

Wow.

ANCIENT SECRETARY

I had to put him down.

DAVID

That's a sad story.

Do you think you could ask

Noel something for me?

ANCIENT SECRETARY

Proceed.

DAVID

Ask if he can check how many

sick days I've taken since

I've worked here?

ANCIENT SECRETARY

Is that the entire message?

DAVID

Yes.

CUT TO:

DAVID

You know what I think about

to calm down? I think about

those big fat, hundred and

twenty pound turtles that

live in the islands. Those

suckers never get angry,

never get in fights and live

longer than all of us and

all they do all is sit on

the beach and hump other

turtles.

(beat)

Why don't we take a second

and think about the turtles?

FATHER

Yeah Jerry why don't you

think about the fat ass

turtles... Like your fat ass

son on the field

jeopardizing the rest of our

chances at a fucking

championship.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Hey Noel.

NOEL

Forty dollars.

DAVID

What?

NOEL

You're getting a forty

dollar raise per week...

that's it.

NOEL

I checked. You were right.

You've never taken a sick

day.

(beat)

Five years, no sick days. I

get it. You want a raise.

You made your point.

NOEL

All right fifty dollars and

that's the god damn limit.

MEGAN(low voice)

Is Jeremy okay?

DAVID(low voice)

He's asleep.

MEGAN(low voice)

Oh.

DAVID(low voice)

I wanted to ask you a

question. It'll sound

strange, but just think

about it for a second.

DAVID(low voice)

When's the last time I was

sick? You remember?

MEGAN(low voice)

I don't know. It's been a

while.

DAVID(low voice)

I haven't been sick this

year. I know that.

MEGAN(low voice)

Okay.

DAVID(low voice)

Do you remember me getting

sick?

MEGAN(low voice)

Not a specific day. What's

this about?

DAVID (low voice)

Megan, do you

remember

me getting sick?

DAVID(low voice)

In the three years we've

been in this house?... In

the old apartment?... Before

Jeremy was born?... Before

we were married?

MEGAN(low voice)

...I can't remember.

DAVID(low voice)

That's strange isn't it? Not

remembering one fever... Or

a cold... Or a sore throat.

What do you think that

means?

MEGAN(low voice)

It means we're probably to

tired to remember.

MEGAN(low voice)

Is that what you wanted to

ask me?

DAVID(low voice)

Yes.

MEGAN(low voice)

Is there anything else you

wanted to ask me while I'm

up?...

MEGAN(low voice)

...When was the last time

you wore pink? When was the

last time you drank soup

standing up? Final call for

strange questions at two in

the morning.

DAVID(low voice)

No that's it.

MEGAN(low voice)

Maybe you should go up.

Jeremy might see you're gone

and get frightened.

(beat)

The train thing, really

shook him up. He's scared

something's going to happen

to you. He doesn't want to

let you out of his sight.

DAVID(low voice)

Yeah. I know.

DAVID(low voice)

When was the last time I

wore pink?

MEGAN(low voice)

The Mitchell barbecue three

years ago.

DAVID(realizing)

Oh shit...

MEGAN(low voice)

Matching shirt and shorts.

It was brutal.

DAVID(low voice)

Goodnight Megan.

MEGAN(low voice)

Goodnight David.

FADE TO BLACK:

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

No more sitting in this

room. I've let it go on long

enough.

ELIJAH

I'm not going out anymore.

I'm not getting hurt again.

This was the last time. I

told you.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

You can't do anything about

that. You might fall between

that chair and this

television. If that's what

God has planned for you,

that's what's going to

happen. You can't hide from

it in your room.

ELIJAH

They call me Mr. Glass at

school. Cause I break like

glass.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

...You make this decision

now to be afraid...

(beat)

And you'll never turn back

your whole life. You'll

always be afraid.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

...I got a present for you.

ELIJAH

Why?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

Forget why. Do you want it

or not?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

Well, go get it then.

ELIJAH

Where is it?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

On a bench, across the

street.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

You calling me a liar?

ELIJAH

Someone's gonna take it.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

Then you better get out

there soon.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

I bought a whole bunch.

They'll be one of these

waiting for you, every time

you want to come out here.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

They said this one has a

surprise ending.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN

This is from Fritz

Champion's own library. This

is before the first issue of

the comic book hit the

stands in 1968.

ELIJAH

It's a classic depiction of

good versus evil. Notice the

square jaw of Slayer -

common in most comic book

heroes. And the slightly

disproportionate size of

Jaguaro's body to his head.

This again is common, but

only in villains... The

thing to notice about this

piece... The thing that

makes it very, very

special... is its realistic

depiction of its figures.

When the characters

eventually made it into the

magazine they were

exaggerated... as always

happens.

(beat)

This is vintage.

BUSINESS MAN

Wrap it up.

ELIJAH

You've made a considerably

wise decision.

BUSINESS MAN

My kid's gonna go berserk.

ELIJAH

Once again please?

BUSINESS MAN

My son Jeb. It's a gift for

him.

ELIJAH

How old is Jeb?

BUSINESS MAN

Four.

ELIJAH

No.

ELIJAH

No, no, no, no no... You

need to go now.

BUSINESS MAN

What did I say?

ELIJAH

Do you see any Telletubbies

around here?... Do you see

a slender plastic tag

clipped to my shirt with my

name printed on it?... Do

you see a little Asian child

with a blank expression

sitting outside in a

mechanical helicopter that

shakes when you put a

quarter in it?... No?...

Well that's what you see at

a toy store? Any you must

think this is a toy store,

cause you're in here

shopping for an infant named

Jeb. One of us has made a

gross error and wasted the

other person's valuable

time...

ELIJAH

This is an art gallery my

friend. This is piece of

art...

ELIJAH

This is one of seventeen

original drawings by Fritz

Champion remaining in the

world. It's value will

triple every year... This

piece is to be treasured. To

be cherished... To be

coveted by every single one

of your banker friends that

think they're better than

you.

BUSINESS MAN

What if I kept it?

ELIJAH

I'm listening.

BUSINESS MAN

I'll keep it in my office

room.

ELIJAH

What about Jeb?

BUSINESS MAN

I have a lock on the door.

ELIJAH

Will it be near a window?

BUSINESSMAN

No direct sunlight will fall

on it.

ELIJAH

Come back in three days.

I'll think about it.

ELIJAH

We're by appointment only.

MAN

I received a card from your

store.

ELIJAH

Congratulations, you have a

mailbox... The sale isn't

for two weeks.

MAN

This one was under the

windshield of my car.

ELIJAH

You've never been sick?

DAVID

I don't know for sure.

(beat)

...I don't think so.

ELIJAH

Well if this ain't a riddle

worthy of the Riddler?

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

So let's get some of the

usual questions out of the

way. Why am I using a cane?

Raise your hand if you were

thinking that.

ELIJAH

I fractured my leg. It's the

fifth time I've done that

particular bone. It didn't

really heal well this time.

ELIJAH

Raise your hand is you're

wondering who the hell

breaks the same bone five

times?

ELIJAH

I have something called

Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

It's a genetic disorder. I

don't make this particular

type of protein very well

and it makes my bones very

low in density, very easy to

break. I've had fifty-four

breaks in my life. I have

the tamest version of the

disorder... Type one.

(beat)

There are type two, type

three, and type four. Type

four's don't make it very

long...

(beat)

That ends our lecture on the

medical anomaly known as

Elijah Price.

ELIJAH

How certain are you that you

haven't been sick in your

life?

DAVID

Seventy-five percent.

ELIJAH

Seventy-five percent? That's

not nearly good enough for

me. I'm extremely skeptical.

DAVID

Skeptical about what?

ELIJAH

Your answer to my question.

It's one thing to have never

been injured in your life,

but to state that you've

never taken ill, well that's

a whole new level.

JEREMY

Dad's been injured.

ELIJAH

What's he talking about?

DAVID

In college. A car accident.

ELIJAH

Was it serious?

JEREMY

He couldn't play football

anymore.

ELIJAH

I assumed because of the

train.

DAVID

You assumed wrong.

ELIJAH

It's over.

(beat)

You can go now.

DAVID

I think you skipped a couple

steps.

DAVID

You forgot the "Now I'm

going to tell you what the

hell is going on" step. See

usually that comes before

the, "It's over" Step. And

it always, always comes

before the "You can go"

Step.

(beat)

What is over?

ELIJAH

The life of an idea that has

lived too long in my head.

ELIJAH

There are probably only four

or five individuals in the

world who can claim more

knowledge of comics than

myself. I've spent a third

of my life in a hospital bed

with nothing else to do but

read. I have studied the

form intimately. I have seen

the patterns in them... The

references to social and

cultural events and the

atmosphere that surrounded

them. I've come to believe

that comics are our last

link to the ancient way of

passing on history.

ELIJAH

The Egyptians drew pictures

on walls about battles, and

events. Countries all around

the world still pass on

knowledge through pictorial

forms.

(beat)

I believe that comics, just

at their core now... have a

truth. They are depicting

what someone, somewhere felt

or experienced. Then of

course that core got chewed

up in the commercial machine

and gets jazzed up, made

titillating - cartooned for

the sale rack.

ELIJAH

This city has had its share

of disasters. Well

publicized ones. It was

around the time of that

plane crash, when it first

entered my head. And there

it stayed, as I waited and

watched the news over the

years...

(beat)

And then one day I see a

news report on a train

accident and its sole

survivor who was

miraculously unharmed.

(soft)

And just like that, an idea

blossoms into the flower of

possible reality.

DAVID

What was your idea Elijah?

ELIJAH(soft)

If there is someone like me

in the world, and I'm at one

end of the spectrum...

Couldn't there be someone

the opposite of me, at the

other end?

(beat)

A person who can't be hurt

like the rest of us. A kind

of person they were talking

about in those stories.

ELIJAH(soft)

A person they believed was

put here to protect the rest

of us. Guard us.

JEREMY

You thought my dad was a

real-

DAVID

Jeremy don't take another

sip of that drink.

DAVID

Throw it in the trashcan

near the door and wait for

me outside. Do it now

please.

DAVID

At the church... You were

following me weren't you?

ELIJAH

Technically no. I gambled

that you would attend the

church service. I just

waited for you.

DAVID

What's this about? This is

obviously some scam. Is this

where you tell me one of

those pictures is like an

investment?

ELIJAH

You've misunderstood.

DAVID

I see guys like you all the

time in my work. You find

someone you think is

emotionally vulnerable and

you tell them a fantastic

story, utterly convincing...

and somewhere in there, you

slip it in... 'I just need

your credit card number','I

just need a small down

payment.'

DAVID

Did you know that this

morning was the first

morning I can remember, that

I didn't open my eyes and

feel that sadness... Do you

know what I'm talking about?

That little bit of sadness?

(beat)

I thought the person that

wrote that note had an

answer for me. For why I

survived that train. For why

my life feels so out of

balance...

(beat)

But I guess that's what you

were counting on.

DAVID

I'm going to leave now.

(beat)

Good luck with your sale.

ELIJAH

What type of job do you have

David?

ELIJAH

You mentioned you've met

'guys like me' in your work.

(beat)

What type of job would that

be?

DAVID

I work at the stadium as a

security guard.

I've come to a decision.

DAVID(whisper)

Oh.

MEGAN(whisper)

Let me just ask you

something okay? And you can

be totally honest. I'm

prepared for any answer. It

won't affect me...

MEGAN(whisper)

Have you

with anyone?

Since we started having

problems? The answer won't

affect me.

MEGAN(whisper)

It won't affect me either

way.

MEGAN(soft)

...My decision is... I'd

like to start again. Pretend

we're at the beginning.

It's a big deal you walked

away from that train. It's

a second chance.

If you want to ask me out

sometime, that would be

okay.

Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got

WALKIE

He's got the most beautiful

eyes... The hell kind of

DAVID(into walkie)

Send him packing. I'm not

walking all the way over

WALKIE

Consider him packed. I

didn't like his attitude...

Struttin around with a cane

DAVID(into walkie)

Hold up Jenkins...

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

They said I couldn't get in

with my ticket.

DAVID

It's for last week's game.

ELIJAH

I've come to understand

that...

(beat)

An ill advised purchase in

the parking lot.

DAVID

What do you want?

ELIJAH

Not money.

(beat)

But I appreciate your

healthy cynicism in the

manner. It will be wise for

both of us to proceed with

greatest caution.

DAVID

We're not proceeding

anywhere together.

ELIJAH

We've already begun.

DAVID

One more time. What is it

you want?

ELIJAH

Why is it, do you think,

that of all the professions

in the world... you chose

protection?

DAVID

Are you for real?

ELIJAH

You could have poured coffee

in Starbucks, you could have

learned to install track

lighting in office

buildings, you could have

told people their horoscopes

on the internet... You could

have been one of ten

thousand things... but in

the end, you chose to

protect people. You made

that decision... and I find

that very, very interesting.

(beat)

Now all I need is your

credit card number.

ELIJAH

That last part was a joke.

DAVID

I got this job because my

college coach called the guy

who manages the stadium.

There's no hidden meaning to

it.

DAVID

They need me at the gate.

DAVID

Did you really want to see

the game? I can get you in.

CUT TO:

DAVID

It gets heaviest ten minutes

before kickoff.

DAVID

Why don't we pat down?

DAVID

Just give me a minute.

ELIJAH

Is there a problem?

DAVID

That guy in green. Sometimes

people carry weapons in

here. Then they drink too

much. They're team isn't

doing so well, bad things

happen... We do random pat

downs of the crowd to

discourage people from

carrying.

(beat)

If he's carrying, he'll step

out of line.

CUT TO:

DAVID

I got you a seat in the

seven hundred level.

(points straight up)

It's nose-bleed territory,

but at least you won't get

spit on.

ELIJAH

How did you know that man

you bumped was carrying a

weapon?

DAVID

Probably the army jacket.

Those guys carry hunting

knives and stuff for show.

ELIJAH

You thought he was carrying

a knife?

DAVID

I thought he was carrying

something.

ELIJAH

But not a knife?

DAVID

I got this picture of a

silver handled gun tucked in

his pants.

(beat)

Like on t.v.

ELIJAH

You have good instincts when

it comes to things like

that?

DAVID

Like what?

ELIJAH

Telling when people have

done something wrong?

DAVID

Yes.

ELIJAH

Have you ever tried to

develop it?

DAVID

I don't know what you're

asking?

ELIJAH

You're skill.

DAVID

Listen. I got to be on the

sidelines during the game...

You can get to your seat by

taking the stairwell at-

ELIJAH

Characters in comic books

are often attributed special

powers. X-ray vision, things

of that sort.

DAVID

Okay, I don't want to play

this game anymore.

ELIJAH

It's an exaggeration of the

truth. Maybe it's based on

something as simple as

instinct. Like being able to

touch someone and tell

whether they've done

something wrong... Or the

level of what they've done

wrong.

DAVID

The guy might not have been

carrying anything.

ELIJAH

Or he might have been

carrying a silver handled

gun tucked in his pants.

DAVID

I have to go now.

ELIJAH

One last question.

DAVID

Quick.

ELIJAH

The car accident you were

in... Was there anyone else

involved?

DAVID

Yes. My wife Megan. She was

in the car with me.

DAVID

Have a good life Elijah and

try to buy your tickets at

an authorized sales

location.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH(calls out)

Hold up for a second!

ELIJAH(calls out)

I just want to ask you

something!

CUT TO:

JEREMY

Was it sold out?

DAVID

You know how mad your mom

would be if she knew you

were playing football?

JEREMY

Are you going to tell?

JEREMY

You want yo play the last

downs? We got a big guy like

you. You can play on

opposite sides.

JEREMY

He's Potter's cousin. He's

the starting corner back for

Temple University.

JEREMY

He going pro in the draft.

They say he can run the

fifty-

DAVID

In under six seconds.

(beat)

I've heard.

DAVID

I'm going to go in.

JEREMY

Just play one set of downs.

I told them you were great.

DAVID

Why'd you do that?

JEREMY

Just one-

DAVID

Jeremy.

(beat)

I'm going in. I have to do

some things.

JEREMY

What things?

DAVID

I'm going to work out.

JEREMY

I'll help you.

DAVID

There's nothing to do.

JEREMY(yells)

I can't play! I'm working

out with my dad!

CUT TO:

DAVID

Why don't you rest now? I'll

take it from here. You've

been a big help.

JEREMY

You think you could beat up

Mike Tyson? I mean before he

started wiggin out and

eating people's ears?

DAVID

No.

JEREMY

What if you worked out

everyday for six months? You

think you could beat him

then?

DAVID

No.

JEREMY

What if you only ate foods

that were good for you and

you worked out everyday for

a year?

DAVID

No.

DAVID

How much did you put on

there?

DAVID

You put too much. That's two

hundred and fifty pounds.

JEREMY

How much can you lift?

DAVID

That's the most I've ever

lifted.

(beat)

That could have been

dangerous Jeremy. Why don't

you go upstairs and let me

finish up?

JEREMY

I'll take it off. I'll help

you right.

JEREMY

You think you could have

beaten up Bruce Lee?

DAVID

No.

JEREMY

I mean if you knew karate?

DAVID

No Jeremy.

JEREMY

What if he wasn't aloud to

kick and you were really mad

at him?

DAVID

No.

DAVID

How much did you take off?

JEREMY

I lied.

DAVID

You added?

JEREMY(soft)

How much is it?

DAVID(soft)

Two hundred and seventy.

JEREMY(dead serious)

Let's put more.

DAVID

Okay.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Why don't you move back a

bit? Just to be safe.

JEREMY

More?

CUT TO:

DAVID

You should never try

anything like this. You know

that right?

DAVID

What do you do if something

happens?

JEREMY(soft)

Get mom.

DAVID

How many did you put on that

time?

JEREMY(soft)

All of it.

DAVID

There's no more left?

DAVID

What else can we use?

CUT TO:

JEREMY(soft)

How much is it?

JEREMY(soft)

How much is it dad?

DAVID(soft)

About three hundred and

forty.

CUT TO:

DAVID

Yeah, hello.

WOMAN(on phone)

Is David Dunne there?

DAVID

Megan?

MEGAN(on phone)

Yes. Is this David?

DAVID

Yeah? Megan where are you

calling from?

MEGAN(on phone)

My name is Megan Inverso. We

went to college together.

DAVID

I remember you.

MEGAN(on phone)

I was hoping you would call

me, but... Anyway I decided

not to wait.

(beat)

I was thinking, it might be

nice to go to dinner

together.

MEGAN(soft)

...Hello?

DAVID

Yeah it might be nice.

CUT TO:

DAVID

...When you work with

clients on machines, do they

sometimes just jump up a

level or two? Do something

they didn't know they were

capable of?

MEGAN

Not often, but it is

possible. Most people get

scared when they see the

shadow of their limits. They

don't know how long the

shadow really is. They don't

know how far away the real

limits are standing... They

stop out of fear.

MEGAN

This is kind of strange

isn't it?

MEGAN

We're not even acting like

ourselves.

MEGAN

Like that. Your mouth's

dirty. You tapped your

napkin to your lips. You

only do that when you're

with someone you don't know.

DAVID

What do I do when I'm around

someone I know?

MEGAN

You use your sleeve.

WOMAN(o.s.)

Megan?

WOMAN

I thought it was you.

MEGAN

Hi.

(to David)

This is Claire. Her son is

in Jeremy's class. Claire

and I worked on the school

food drive together.

DAVID

Hello.

CLAIRE(mouths)

He's cute.

CLAIRE

I'm very happy about this.

Megan mentioned to me she

was considering dating

again.

CLAIRE(to David)

I'm sorry, what's your name?

DAVID

David.

CLAIRE

David?

MEGAN

This is my husband.

CLAIRE(soft)

I am so sorry.

CUT TO:

DYED HAIR GIRL

He ate about six of those

chocolate covered doughnut

holes with his milk. He said

he only had three, but I

know he had six.

DAVID

Okay.

MEGAN(soft)

Goodnight.

DYED HAIR GIRL

My parents sleep in separate

beds.

DAVID

Thank you.

DYED HAIR GIRL

By the way, Jeremy went to

sleep in his room tonight.

DAVID

His room?

CUT TO:

JEREMY(whispered)

I'm sleeping in my room.

DAVID(soft)

I see.

JEREMY(whispered)

I'm not scared.

DAVID(soft)

That's great.

JEREMY(whispered)

Do you know why?

JEREMY(whispered)

I know now.

DAVID(soft)

Know what?

JEREMY(whispered)

You're secret identity.

(beat)

That man was right.

DAVID

Jeremy.

DAVID(soft)

There are big guys in almost

every gym who can lift that

much.

JEREMY(whispered)

You could have lifted more.

(his eyes close)

...Don't worry, I won't tell

anyone.

CUT TO:

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)

...fracture of the proximal

phalanx of the little finger

as well as multiple

fractures of the sixth,

seventh, and eighth ribs.

The worst of the injury,

however, was sustained to

the left leg in the form of

a spiral fracture. There

were fourteen breaks. It

simply shattered...

ELIJAH

They call me Mr. Glass.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)

Who does?

ELIJAH

Kids.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)

Shall I continue?

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)

Pins were placed throughout

the length of the leg. The

use of a wheelchair will be

needed for a two month

period. The use of crutches

will follow for twelve to

fourteen months. Hospital

stay will range from five to

eight days followed by nine

therapy. Prescribed

medication for pain

management will take the

usual forms of...

The hospital discharged him

MEGAN

Thanks.

MEGAN

Elijah right?

CUT TO:

DAVID(whispers)

Four ten... four

forty-five...

(beat)

Five hundred.

CUT TO:

MEGAN

We're going to prevent any

substantial atrophy of your

good leg with this.

(She taps the machine)

It works the quadriceps.

ELIJAH

How long have you been

married?

MEGAN

Twelve years.

ELIJAH

How did you get together?

MEGAN

A car accident.

ELIJAH

Now you're going to have to

tell me more.

MEGAN

...See my husband was a big

football star in college and

we were in an accident

together. Our car flipped on

an icy road. We were both

injured. He couldn't play

football anymore.

(beat)

If that hadn't happened, we

wouldn't have been together.

ELIJAH

How so?

MEGAN

Football wasn't the kind of

life I wanted... For ten

years I'd be by the phone

waiting for a call telling

me he broke his neck in a

practice game. And if it

wasn't that call, it would

be a call telling me he blew

out his knee or suffered his

third concussion. I've seen

way too much of it in my

job... I can barely take it

when my clients are in pain.

(beat)

I don't hate the game. I

admire the amount of skill

it involved and, like

everyone else, I was in awe

of how he could play it, but

I couldn't give him my heart

and then have something

happen to him. And it always

does with that game.

(beat)

It's not a thing many people

would understand.

ELIJAH

You and my mother would have

a special connection.

MEGAN

Any way, fate stepped in and

took football out of the

equation.

ELIJAH

...And everyone lived

happily ever after.

MEGAN

Sort of.

ELIJAH

What part of David's body

was injured?

MEGAN

Who said my husband's name

is David?

CUT TO:

STOCKY WOMAN

Choose.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

There have been three major

disasters in this city over

the last four years. I've

followed each one of them...

A Seven-three-seven crashes

on take off. One hundred and

seventy-two die. No

survivors... A hotel fire

downtown. Two hundred and

eleven die. No survivors...

And am Amtrak train derails

seven and half miles outside

of the city. One hundred and

thirty one die. One

survivor. He is unharmed.

(beat)

I've spoken with your

husband about his survival.

I suggested a rather

unbelievable explanation.

Since then, I've come to

believe, that my

explanation, however

unbelievable, is in fact,

true.

MEGAN

And what was that

explanation?

ELIJAH

It's a mediocre time Mrs.

Dunne. People are starting

to lose hope. It's hard for

many to believe that

extraordinary things live

inside themselves as well as

others... I hope you can

keep an open mind?

MEGAN(soft)

Is this a religious thing?

ELIJAH

I own a comic book museum.

It's called the Limited

Edition.

MEGAN(smiles)

For a second there I thought

you were a fanatic.

ELIJAH

I believe comic books are

based loosely on reality -

I believe there are real

life equivalents of the

heroes in those books that

walk the earth - I believe

your husband is one of those

individuals.

ELIJAH

I'm glad you brought up fate

Mrs. Dunne. I'm becoming a

strong believer in it...

See, David refuses to speak

with me any longer... And

when I saw your name on my

insurance list of approved

physical therapists... It

was like fate had

intervened...

(beat)

We were meant to speak to

each other.

CUT TO:

SWEAT SHIRT MAN(whispers)

This is my house, bitch.

These are my customers.

GRAY EYED MAN

Yeah?

DAVID

We've had some problems with

drug selling in this

stadium.

(beat)

Would you mind if I checked

the pockets of your

sweatshirt?

DAVID(into walkie)

Yeah?

WALKIE(o.s.)

There's a message for you at

the office. Your kid was

hurt.

DAVID(into walkie)

When?

WALKIE(o.s.)

Just now. They want you to

come down to his school.

GRAY EYED MAN

Why don't you go take care

of your business?

GRAY EYED MAN

And dude, no one carries

their merchandise on them

any more. They got

messengers for that shit

now.

(beat)

That's what they tell me.

CUT TO:

THERMOMETER BOY

Is that your dad?

THERMOMETER BOY

I bet my dad can beat up you

dad.

JEREMY

I don't think so.

CUT TO:

NURSE

...No, he insisted we only

call you.

(beat)

Though it took us a while to

track down your number. It's

not on file here.

DAVID

Megan handles that type of

stuff.

NURSE

What stuff is that?

DAVID

Jeremy's stuff.

DAVID

So do I need to put any

smelly ointments on him or

anything?

NURSE

It's more emotional damage.

It wasn't very serious

physically.

NURSE

Nothing like when I sent you

to the hospital.

DAVID

What was that?

NURSE

My office was on the other

side of the building back

then.

(beat)

You don't remember me do

you?

NURSE

I had red hair.

NURSE

I think you were a little

younger than Jeremy when it

happened.

(beat)

Did you know we changed the

conduct rules of the pool

because of you?

NURSE

The kids still talk about it

like some ghost story..."Did

you know there was a kid

that almost drowned in the

pool? He got pneumonia and

almost died."

NURSE

We let them tell it... It

helps keep them safe.

NURSE

Are you still phobic of

water?

DAVID

Yes I am.

CUT TO:

JEREMY(soft)

It was Potter and another

guy I play football with.

They were messing with this

Chinese girl. She's kind of

fat. She doesn't talk to

anybody.

(beat)

I tried to make them stop.

They kept pushing me down

and wouldn't let me get up.

JEREMY(soft)

I thought maybe cause you

were my dad, I thought I

might be like you.

JEREMY(soft)

I'm not like you.

DAVID

You are like me. We both can

get hurt. I'm just an

ordinary man.

(beat)

I'm not what you think I am.

JEREMY

Why do you keep saying that?

CUT TO:

MEGAN

He's just laying in bed.

He's pretty upset. He won't

talk.

DAVID

He's dealing with a lot of

things.

(beat)

I think he needs to find

answers himself.

MEGAN

It's weird to hear you tell

me about Jeremy.

(beat)

A good weird.

DAVID

Would you like to try going-

MEGAN

Yes.

DAVID

-out again.

DAVID

But if we see another mother

from Jeremy's school, me

name is Juan. I always

wanted to be a Juan.

MEGAN

Oh. Elijah Price came to

visit me at the center

today.

DAVID

Jesus.

MEGAN

He didn't do anything. He

just told me his theory...

It's sad when patients get

like that. They loose

reality.

DAVID(whisper)

Jeremy what the hell are you

doing?

JEREMY(crying)

You don't believe. I'll show

you... You can't get hurt.

MEGAN(realizing)

-Oh my God.

DAVID

-Jeremy did you load that

gun?

JEREMY(crying)

-You won't get hurt...

DAVID

-Elijah was wrong.

MEGAN

-Sometimes when people are

sick or hurt for a long

time, like Elijah, they're

mind gets hurt too.

MEGAN

-They start to think things

that aren't true. He hold me

what he thought about your

father. It isn't true.

JEREMY(crying)

-I'll show you.

DAVID

-You know the story about

the kid who almost drowned

in the pool?

DAVID

-That was me they were

talking about. I almost

died. That was me.

JEREMY(crying)

-You're lying.

DAVID

-I'm not. I just didn't

connect it.

MEGAN

-Jeremy, your father was

injured in college - you

know that. You know all

about that.

MEGAN

-Don't do it. He'll die

Jeremy.

JEREMY(crying)

-I'll just shoot him once.

DAVID

-Jeremy listen to what-

JEREMY

-Don't be scared.

DAVID

-Jeremy if you pull that

trigger I'm going to leave!

I'm going to go to New York.

DAVID

You're right... If you shoot

me, that bullet is going to

bounce off me and I won't

get hurt... but then I'm

going to go upstairs and

pack. And then leave to New

York.

JEREMY(crying)

-Why?

DAVID(loud)

Jeremy!

DAVID(loud)

You're about to get into big

trouble! I'm your father and

I'm telling you to put that

gun down right now God damn

it!

(beat)

One!...

(beat)

Two!...

JEREMY(soft)

...You didn't have to yell.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELIJAH

Joined a rugby league.

Turned out to be a bad idea.

(beat)

Come here I want to show you

something.

ELIJAH

Look at this. I just noticed

this today.

ELIJAH

This is from the Sentryman

series. A color version of

this was actually used in

the second issue.

ELIJAH

Look at this eyes. What do

you see?

ELIJAH

It's fear.

(beat)

He was scared. They were

being honest in the

beginning you see. They let

him be human.

(beat)

They turned him into a

garden variety hero later...

Then he was brave all the

time.

ELIJAH

I followed the guy in the

army jacket.

ELIJAH

He had a silver handled gun

tucked in the back of his

pants.

(beat)

Were you really injured in

that car accident in

college?

ELIJAH

Because I think you faked

it. I think you took the

opportunity to end your

career - no questions asked.

(beat)

And I think you did it, of

all things, for a women...

(beat)

Not only do you have the

physical traits of a hero,

down somewhere in there, you

have the moral code of one

too. You were ready to

sacrifice everything for

what's right. Where can you

find that these days?

(beat)

Only thing you didn't realize

is that you were giving up

a part of yourself when you

gave up football. The

physical part. And you need

that part desperately to

feel balance again...

(beat)

You can have it back now.

(beat)

This was all just make

believe before. What if

there was someone the

opposite of me? What if?...

(beat)

I now believe you are the

genuine article Mr. David

Dunne. The kind of person we

knew existed, from our

history.

ELIJAH

It's time for someone like

you.

(beat)

Bad is winning. I can feel

it.

DAVID(rattled)

I must have felt some lump

in his back when I bumped

him. Most guns have a black

or silver handle. I had a

fifty-fifty shot at the

color.

ELIJAH

That's not what I witnessed

David.

DAVID

Stop messing with my life

Elijah. My son almost shot

me last night. He wanted to

prove you were right.

ELIJAH

I never said you couldn't be

killed. I never said that.

DAVID

You have a problem, Elijah.

My wife is right. Somewhere

along the line one of your

bones broke and your mind

just broke with it.

ELIJAH

Are you finished?

DAVID

No. And I have been sick. I

spent a week in a hospital

when I was a boy recovering

from pneumonia and almost

drowning.

DAVID

Two skinny eight year old

kids were playing around the

pool. They were dunking me.

I swallowed water. They

didn't know it and they

almost killed me.

(beat)

Heroes don't get killed like

that. Normal people do.

DAVID

I don't want to see you

again okay.

(soft)

Now I'm finished.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MEGAN

The sitter's here.

MEGAN

We can do this another time

if you want? I'm fine with

anything.

DAVID

But I put cologne on.

MEGAN

Is that what that smell is?

CUT TO:

PONYTAIL MAN

Hey man it's twenty after.

It's time to close. I gotta

head.

PONYTAIL MAN

You better not be jacking

off to the Japanese comics.

I swear to God.

PONYTAIL MAN

Listen man, I didn't know

you were in-

(beat)

Just choose something all

right?

PONYTAIL MAN

Hello. You understand

English?

PONYTAIL MAN

Look man, I'm just gonna

wheel you out. You can think

about things outside on the

sidewalk. I gotta get some

chicken in me, you know what

I'm saying?

PONYTAIL MAN

Shit.

PONYTAIL MAN

Dude, I don't care if you

are in a wheelchair. If you

do that again, I'm calling

Five-O.

PONYTAIL MAN

That's it crackerjack!

You're going to sit your ass

in jail now.

ELIJAH

How much is this one?

CUT TO:

DAVID

...I think rust.

MEGAN

Rust?

DAVID

As a color, not as rust. You

know, a rust colored paint

or wood?

MEGAN

I didn't know that. Mine's

still brown.

DAVID

My turn. What's your

favorite song?

MEGAN

Soft and Wet, by the Artist

Formerly Known as Prince.

DAVID

What was that?

MEGAN

We're supposed to be honest.

DAVID

Soft and Wet. That's very

interesting.

MEGAN

My turn.

(beat)

When was the first time the

thought popped into your

head that we might not make

it?

DAVID

That's not the game.

MEGAN

It's a second date. There

aren't any rules.

DAVID

I'm not sure.

MEGAN

Think carefully?

DAVID

What about the game?

MEGAN

It's finished. I won.

MEGAN

Maybe it wasn't a specific

moment, maybe it-

DAVID

I had a nightmare one night

and I didn't wake you up so

you could tell me it was

okay.

(beat)

I think that was the first

time.

(beat)

Does that count?

MEGAN(soft)

That counts.

MEGAN

Do you knowingly keep Jeremy

and me at a distance?

DAVID

Yes.

MEGAN

Why?

DAVID

I don't know Megan.

MEGAN

It's like you resent us

David. Resent the life you

have.

MEGAN

You know even if it meant we

couldn't be together, I

would never have wished that

injury on you? What you

could so physically was a

gift. I would never have

wished it to go away.

MEGAN

You know that right?

DAVID(soft)

I know.

CUT TO:

DYED HAIR GIRL

You got two calls. One came

through while I was on the

line - I wasn't talking too

long. There was an emergency

with my sister. She tried to

do her own perm and now she

looks like-

DAVID

Who called through?

DYED HAIR GIRL

Someone from New York.

DYED HAIR GIRL

About a security job at a

museum. They want to hire

you.

(beat)

I didn't know you guys were

moving to New York. Thanks

for telling me.

MEGAN

We're not moving.

DYED HAIR GIRL

Oh.

(beat)

I let the answering machine

pick up the other call.

DYED HAIR GIRL

Great.

MEGAN

Look let's be honest here.

We're just at the beginning.

I don't expect you or I to

change the course of where

our lives were headed

because of two dates.

(beat)

If you do go to New York, we

can still develop this.

We'll just be forced to take

it slow. And in the end,

that's definitely better.

(beat)

This is our second time

around David. I don't expect

us to get carried away.

(beat)

I guess congratulations is

the right thing to say.

CUT TO:

ELIJAH(on tape)

...David. It's Elijah. It

was so obvious. It's

referred to over and over.

That's the key you see. The

repetition across time. That

means at some point it was

all based on common thought,

a common event - a fact.

(beat)

It was this one issue that

brought it back for me...

Century Comics

One-Seventeen. That's where

this group, the Coalition of

Evil, tried to ascertain the

weakness of every superhero.

ELIJAH(on tape)

...Because they all have

one.

(beat)

Just like you.

(beat)

The cells that make up your

muscles and your bones react

to forces that act upon it,

slightly different from than

mine. That's clear... Your

cells react to bacteria and

viruses slightly differently

than mine... That's also

clear...But for some reason,

you and I react the exact

same way to water. We

swallow it, we choke. We

swallow too much of it, we

drown. However unreal it may

seem, we are connected, you

and I, we are on the same

curve... just on opposite

ends.

ELIJAH

The point of all this is, we

now know something we

didn't... You have a

weakness... Water. It's your

krpytonite.

You hearing me David? Call

me back... I got rugby

practice in an hour.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

...See the villain's eyes.

They're larger than the

other characters'. They

insinuate a slightly skewed

perspective of how they see

the world. Just off normal.

DAVID

He doesn't look very

threatening.

WOMAN

That's what I said to my

son. He said, there's always

two kinds. The soldier

villain who fights the hero

with his hands, and then

there's the real threat. The

brilliant and evil arch

enemy who fights the hero

with his mind.

DAVID

Are you Elijah's mother?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

I am. I'm helping him with

the sale.

DAVID

It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm David Dunne.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

He's spoken of you. He says

you're becoming friends.

DAVID

We are.

DAVID

He's doing well today.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

I'm very proud of him.

(beat)

He's been through a lot in

his life. A lot of ups and

downs, a lot of bad spells.

A couple I'd thought had

broken him... I mean

emotionally.

(beat)

They were bad... But he made

it. Yes he did.

DAVID

He's kind of a miracle.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

Yes he is.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER

I'll tell him you're here.

ELIJAH

Did you see this?

ELIJAH(soft)

It has begun.

ELIJAH

When I saw it this morning.

I felt a part of the world

again.

MAN

What's going on?

ELIJAH

A plane just crashed.

CUT TO:

ELDERLY MAN

I've worked here twenty-five

years. I know all its

secrets.

ELIJAH

Secrets?

ELDERLY MAN(whispers)

Like if there was ever a

fire on floors one, two, or

three... Everyone in this

hotel would be burned alive.

CUT TO:

ENGINEER

Passengers aren't allowed in

there.

ELIJAH(low voice)

I almost gave up hope. There

were so many times I

questioned myself. I've made

so many sacrifices but it's

all been worth it.

(beat)

There are millions and

millions or mediocre people

in the world David. Isn't it

great that we aren't one of

them?
