Aliens - by James Cameron

"ALIENS"

by

James Cameron

FIRST DRAFT

May 28, 1985

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALIENS

LEADER

(filtered)

Internal pressure positive.  Assume

nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep

capsules, style circa late twenties...

LEADER

(voice over; filtered)

Lights are green.  She's alive.

Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

DISSOLVE TO:

MED-TECH

Why don't I open the viewport?

Watch your eyes.

MED-TECH

And how are we today?

RIPLEY

(weakly)

Terrible.

MED-TECH

Just terrible?  That's better

than yesterday at least.

RIPLEY

How long have I been on

Gateway station?

MED-TECH

Just a couple of days.  Do you

feel up to a visitor?

RIPLEY

Jones!

RIPLEY

(cooing baby-cat talk)

Come here Jonesy you ugly old

moose...you ugly thing.

MAN

Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.

I work for the company, but other

than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to

see you're feeling better.  I'm told

the weakness and disorientation

should pass soon.  Side effects of

the unusually long hypersleep, or

something like that.

RIPLEY

How long was I out there?  They

won't tell me anything.

BURKE

(soothing)

Well, maybe you shouldn't worry

about that just yet.

RIPLEY

How long?

BURKE

All right.  My instinct says

you're strong enough to handle

this...Fifty-seven years.

RIPLEY

Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

BURKE

You'd drifted right through the

core systems.  It's blind luck that

deep-salvage team caught you when

they...are you all right?

MED-TECH

(shouting)

Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!

4-1-5!

RIPLEY

No...noooo!

DOCTOR

Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!

And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

MED-TECH

Bad dreams again?  Do you want

something to help you sleep?

RIPLEY

(faint)

No.. I've slept enough.

RIPLEY

We made it, Jones.  We made it.

CUT TO:

RIPLEY

(voice over)

Dumbshit.

BURKE

Sorry...I've been running behind

all morning.

RIPLEY

Have they located my daughter

yet?

BURKE

Well, I was going to wait

until after the inquest...

RIPLEY

Is she...?

BURKE

(scanning)

Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married

name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six

...at time of death.  Two years

ago.

(looks at her)

I'm sorry.

RIPLEY

Amy.

BURKE

(reading)

Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't

licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred

Parkside Repository, Little Chute,

Wisconsin.  No children.

RIPLEY

I promised her I'd be home for

her birthday.  Her eleventh

birthday.  I sure missed that

one.

(pause)

Well...she has already learned

to take my promises with a grain

of salt.  When it came to flight

schedules, anyway.

RIPLEY

You always think you can make it

up to somebody...later, you know.

But now I never can.  I never

can.

BURKE

(gently)

The hearing convenes at 0930.  You

don't want to be late.

RIPLEY

You read my deposition...it's

complete and accurate.

BURKE

Look, I believe you, but there are

going to be some heavyweights in

there.  You got Feds, you got

interstellar commerce commission,

you got colonial administration,

insurance company guys...

RIPLEY

I get the picture.

BURKE

Just tell them what happened.  The

important thing is to stay cool

and unemotional.

RIPLEY

Do you people have earwax, of

what?  We have been here three

hours.  How many different ways

do you want me to tell the same

story?

VAN LEUWEN

Look at it from our perspective.

You freely admit to detonating the

engines of, and thereby destroying,

an M-Class star-freighter.  A

rather expensive piece of hardware...

INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR

(dryly)

Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.

That's minus payload, of course.

VAN LEUWEN

The shuttle's flight recorder

corroborates some elements of

your account.  That the Nostromo

set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed

planet, at that time.  That

repairs were made.  That it resumed

its course and was subsequently set

for self-destruct.  By you.  For

reasons unknown.

RIPLEY

Look, I told you...

VAN LEUWEN

It did not, however, contain any

entries concerning the hostile

life form you allegedly picked up.

RIPLEY

Then somebody's gotten to it...

doctored the recorder.  Who had

access to it?

ECA REP

Would you just listen to yourself

for one minute.

VAN LEUWEN

The analysis team which went over

your shuttle centimeter by

centimeter found no physical

evidence of the creature you

describe...

RIPLEY

(losing it)

That's because I blew it out the

Goddamn airlock!

(pause)

Like I said.

INSURANCE MAN

(to ECA Rep)

Are there any species like this

'hostile organism' on LV-426?

ECA REP

No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous

life larger than a simple virus.

RIPLEY

I told you, it wasn't indigenous.

There was an alien spacecraft there.

A derelict ship.  We homed on its

beacon...

ECA REP

To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed

over three hundred worlds and no one's

ever reported a creature which, using

your words...

(read from Ripley's

statement)

...'gestates in a living human host'

and has 'concentrated molecular acid

for blood.'

RIPLEY

Look, I can see where this is

going.  But I'm telling you those

things exist.  Back on that planetoid

is an alien ship and on that ship

are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.

Do you understand?  I suggest you

find it, using the flight recorder's

data.  Find it and deal with it --

before one of your survey teams

comes back with a little surprise...

VAN LEUWEN

Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That

will be...

RIPLEY

(louder, stepping

on him)

...because just one of those

things managed to kill my entire

crew, within twelve hours of

hatching...

VAN LEUWEN

Thank you, that will be all.

RIPLEY

That's not all, Goddamnit!  If

those things get back here, that

will be all.  Then you can just

kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss

it goodbye.

CUT TO:

BURKE

You had them eating out of your

hand, kiddo.

RIPLEY

They had their minds made up

before I even went in there.

They think I'm a head case.

BURKE

(cheerfully)

You are a head case.  Have a donut.

VAN LEUWEN

It is the finding of this board of

inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,

NOC-14672. has acted with questionable

judgment and is unfit to hold an

ICC license as a commercial flight

officer.

VAN LEUWEN

Said license is hereby suspended

indefinitely.  No criminal charges

will be filed at this time and you

are released on own recognizance

for a six month period of

psychometric probation, to include

monthly review by an ICC psychiatric

tech...

RIPLEY

(insistent)

Why won't you check out LV-426?

VAN LEUWEN

(condescendingly)

Because I don't have to.  The

people who live there checked it

out years ago and they never

reported and 'hostile organism'

or alien ship.  And by the way,

they call it Acheron now.

RIPLEY

What are you talking about.

What people?

VAN LEUWEN

Terraformers...planet engineers.

It's what we call a shake 'n' bake

colony.  They set up atmosphere

processors to make the air

breathable...big job.  Takes

decades.  They've already been

there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

RIPLEY

How many colonists?

VAN LEUWEN

Sixty, maybe seventy families.

RIPLEY

(low)

Sweet Jesus.

ELEVATOR PASSENGER

Do you mind?

HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159

"WELCOME TO ACHERON"

LYDECKER

You remember you sent some

wildcatters out to that

plateau, out past the Ilium

range, a couple days ago?

SIMPSON

Yeah.  What?

LYDECKER

There's a guy on the horn,

mom-and-pop survey team.  Says

he's homing on something and

wants to know if his claim will

be honored.

SIMPSON

Christ.  Some honch in a cushy

office on Earth says go look at

a grid reference in the middle

of nowhere, we look.  They don't

say why, and I don't ask.  I

don't ask because it takes two

weeks to get an answer out here

and the answer's always 'don't

ask.'

LYDECKER

So what do I tell this guy?

SIMPSON

Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,

he finds something it's his.

JORDEN

(gloating cackle)

Look at this fat, juicy magnetic

profile.  And it's mine, mine,

mine.

ANNE

Half mine, dear.

NEWT

And half mine!

JORDEN

I got too many partners.

NEWT

Daddy, when are we going back

to town?

JORDEN

When we get rich, Newt.

NEWT

You always say that.  I wanna go

back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

TIM

You cheat too much.

NEWT

Do not.  I'm just the best.

TIM

Do too!  You go in places we

can't fit.

NEWT

So!  That's why I'm the best.

ANNE

Knock it off!  I catch either of

you playing in the air ducts again

I'll tan your hides.

NEWT

Mom.  All the kids play it...

JORDEN

(reverently)

Holy shiiit!

JORDEN

Folks, we have scored big this

time.

ANNE

You kids stay inside.  I mean

it!  We'll be right back.

ANNE

Shouldn't we call in?

JORDEN

Let's wait till we know what to

call it in as.

ANNE

(nervous)

How about 'big weird thing'?

TIM

Cheater!

NEWT

Timmy...they've been gone a

long time.

TIM

(quavering)

It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows

what he's doing.

ANNE

Mayday!  Mayday!  This is

Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner

calling Hadley Control.

Repeat.  This is...

CUT TO:

VOICE FROM VIDEO

(o.s.)

Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the

family are heading off for the

colonies!

BON

(o.s.)

Best decision I ever made, Bill.

We'll be starting a new life

from scratch, in a clean world.

No crime.  No unemployment...

BURKE

Hi, Ripley.  This is

Lieutenant Gorman of the...

BURKE

Ripley we have to talk.

(pause)

They've lost contact with the

colony on Acheron.

RIPLEY

No.  There's no way!

BURKE

Hear me out...

RIPLEY

I was reamed, steamed and

dry-cleaned by you guys...and

now you want me to go back out

there?  Forget it.

BURKE

Look, we don't know what's going

on out there.  It may just be a

down transmitter.  But if it's

not, I want you there...as an

advisor.  That's all.

GORMAN

You wouldn't be going in with the

troops.  I can guarantee your

safety.

BURKE

These Colonial Marines are

some tough hombres, and they're

packing state-of-the-art firepower.

Nothing they can't handle...right,

Lieutenant?

GORMAN

(cool)

We're trained to deal with these

kinds of situations.

RIPLEY

(to Burke)

What about you?  What's your

interest in this?

BURKE

Well, the corporation co-financed

that colony with the Colonial

Administration, against mineral

rights.  We're getting into a lot

of terraforming...'Building Better

Worlds.'

RIPLEY

Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

BURKE

I heard you were working in the

cargo docks.

RIPLEY

(defensive)

That's right.

BURKE

Running loaders, forklifts, that

sort of thing?

RIPLEY

(shrugging)

It's all I could get.  Anyway,

it keeps my mind off of...

everything.  Days off are worse.

BURKE

What if I said I could get you

reinstated as a flight officer?

And that the company has agreed

to pick up your contract?

RIPLEY

If I go.

BURKE

If you go.

(pause)

It's a second chance, kiddo.  And

it'll be the best thing in the

world for you to face this fear

and beat it.  You gotta get back

on the horse...

RIPLEY

(frosty)

Spare me, Burke.  I've had my

psych evaluation this month.

BURKE

Yes, and I've read it.  You

wake up every night, sheets

soaking, the same nightmare

over and over...

RIPLEY

(shouting)

No!  The answer is no.  Now

please go.  I'm sorry.  Just

go, would you.

BURKE

Think about it.

CUT TO:

BURKE

(on video phone)

Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

RIPLEY

Burke, just tell me one thing.

That you're going out there to

kill them.  Not study.  Not bring

back.  Just burn them out...clean

...forever.

BURKE

That's the plan.  My word on it.

RIPLEY

All right.  I'm in.

RIPLEY

And you my dear, are staying

right here.

Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for

DRAKE

They ain't payin' us enough

for this.

DIETRICH

Not enough to have to wake up

to your face, Drake.

DRAKE

Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look

like I feel.

HUDSON

This floor's freezing.

APONE

Christ.  I never saw such a

buncha old women.  You want me

to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

HUDSON

Would you, Sir?

HUDSON

Hey, Vasquez...you ever been

mistaken for a man?

VASQUEZ

No.  Have you?

FROST

Hey, hand job, you take my

towel?

SPUNKMEYER

(overlapping)

I need some slack, man.  How

come they send us straight back

out like this?  We got some slack

comin', man.

HICKS

You just got three weeks.

SPUNKMEYER

I mean breathing, not this frozen

shit.

DIETRICH

Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

APONE

You know it ain't up to me.

(louder)

Awright!  Let's knock off the

grabass.  First assembly's in

fifteen...let's shag it.

VASQUEZ

Who's the fresh meat again?

FERRO

She's supposed to be some kinda

consultant...

(exaggerated)

...She was an alien once.

HUDSON

Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

APONE

Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

HUDSON

Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

APONE

Rescue mission.  There's some

juicy colonists' daughters we

gotta rescue from virginity.

SPUNKMEYER

Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.

What's this crap supposed to be?

WIERZBOWSKI

Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't

mind getting me some more a

that Arcturan poontang.  Remember

that time?

HICKS

(low)

Looks like that new Lieutenant's

too good to eat with us grunts.

WIERZBOWSKI

(glancing

over shoulder)

Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,

definitely.

BISHOP

I'm sorry you feel that way

about Synthetics, Ripley.

RIPLEY

You never said anything about an

android being here!  Why not?

BURKE

Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's

been policy for years to have a

synthetic on board.

BISHOP

I prefer the term 'artificial person'

myself.  Is there a problem?

BURKE

A synthetic malfunctioned on her

last trip out.  Some deaths were

involved.

BISHOP

I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

BURKE

Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

BISHOP

Well, that explains it.  The

A/2's were always a bit twitchy.

That could never happen now with

out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible

for me to harm or, by omission of

action, allow to be harmed a

human being.

(smiling)

More cornbread?

RIPLEY

Just stay away from me, Bishop!

You got that straight?

WIERZBOWSKI

She don't like the cornbread

either.

APONE

Tench-hut!

GORMAN

At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't

have time to brief before we

left Gateway but...

HUDSON

Sir?

GORMAN

(annoyed)

Yes, Hicks?

HUDSON

Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

GORMAN

What's the question?

HUDSON

Is this going to be a stand-up

fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

GORMAN

All we know is that there's

still no contact with the colony

and that a xenomorph may be

involved.

WIERZBOWSKI

A what?

HICKS

(to Wierzbowski;

low)

It's a bug-hunt.

(louder)

So what are these things?

RIPLEY

I've dictated what I know on

these.

APONE

Tease us a bit.

SPUNKMEYER

Yeah...previews.

RIPLEY

Okay.  It's important to understand

this organism's life cycle.  It's

actually two creatures.  The first

form hatches from a spore...a sort

of large egg, and attaches itself

to its victim.  Then it injects

an embryo, detaches and dies.

It's essentially a walking sex organ.

The --

HUDSON

Sounds like you, Hicks.

RIPLEY

(controlled)

The embryo, the second form, hosts

in the victim's body for several

hours.  Gestating.  Then it...

(with difficulty)

...then it...emerges.  Moults.

Grows rapidly --

VASQUEZ

I only need to know one thing.

RIPLEY

Yes?

VASQUEZ

Where they are.

DRAKE

Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

VASQUEZ

Anytime.  Anywhere.

HUDSON

Somebody said alien...she

thought they said illegal alien

and signed up.

VASQUEZ

Fuck you.

HUDSON

Anytime.  Anywhere.

RIPLEY

(icy)

Am I disturbing you conversation

Mr. Hudson?

RIPLEY

I hope you're right.  I really

do.

BURKE

(to all)

I suggest you study the disks

Ripley has been kind enough to

prepare for you.

GORMAN

Are there any questions?  Hudson?

HUDSON

How do I get out of this

chicken-shit outfit?

GORMAN

All right.  I want this to go

smooth and by the numbers.  I

want DCS and tactical database

assimilation by 0830.

(some groans)

Ordnance loading, weapons strip and

drop-ship prep details will have

seven hours...

BISHOP

(into mike)

Attention.  This concluded final

maneuvering operations.  Thank

you for your cooperation.  You

may resume work.

BURKE

Still nothing from the colony?

GORMAN

Dead on all channels.

FROST

Clear, please.

HUDSON

Excuse me.

RIPLEY

I feel like a fifth wheel

here.  Is there anything I can

do?

APONE

I don't know.  Is there anything

you can do?

RIPLEY

(pointing)

I can drive that loader.  I've

got a Class Two rating.  My

latest career move.

RIPLEY

Where you want it?

APONE

Let's move it, girls!  On

the ready line.  Let's go,

let's go.

HUDSON

I am ready, man.  Ready to get

it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the

ultimate badass...state of the

badass art.  You do not want to

fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't

worry.  Me and my squad of

ultimate badasses will protect you.

Check-it-out...

HUDSON

Independently targetting

particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!

Fry half a city with this puppy.

We got tactical smart-missles,

phased-plasma pulse-rifles,

RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic

ballbreakers, we got nukes, we

got knives...sharp sticks --

HICKS

Save it.

HUDSON

Sure, Hicks.

BURKE

Here we go.

FERRO

Initiate release sequencer on my

mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark!

FERRO

(icy calm)

Switching to DCS ranging.

SPUNKMEYER

Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.

Picking up some hull ionization.

FERRO

Got it.  Rough air ahead.

FERRO

(voice over;

filtered)

Stand by for some chop.

RIPLEY

How may drops is this for you,

Lieutenant?

GORMAN

Thirty-eight...simulated.

VASQUEZ

How many combat drops?

GORMAN

Well...two.  Three, including

this one.

FERRO

Turning on final.  Coming around to

a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal

guidance locked in.  Where's

the damn beacon?

GORMAN

Let's see.  Everybody on line.

Drake, check you camera.  There

seems to be a...

GORMAN

(o.s)

...that's better.  Pan it around

a bit.

APONE

Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.

Let's move.  Two minutes.

Somebody wake up Hicks.

RIPLEY

That the atmosphere processor?

BURKE

Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,

all over the planet.  They're

completely automated.  We

manufacture them, by the way.

GORMAN

(to Ferro via mike)

Hold at forty.  Slow circle of

the complex.

RIPLEY

The structure seems intact.  They

have power.

GORMAN

(to Apone)

Okay, let's do it.

APONE

Awright!  I want a nice clean

dispersal this time.

VASQUEZ

You staying in here?

RIPLEY

You bet.

VASQUEZ

(turning away)

Figures.

GORMAN

(to Ferro via mike)

Set down sixty meters this side

of the telemetry mast.  Immediate

dust off on my 'clear,' then stay

on station.

APONE

Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

GORMAN

(voice over;

filtered)

First squad up, on line.  Hicks,

get yours in a cordon.  Watch the

rear.

APONE

Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

APONE

Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

APONE

First squad, assemble on me at

the main lock.

GORMAN

(voice over;

filtered)

Second team, move up.

Flanking positions.

GORMAN

Quarter and search by twos.  Second

team move inside.  Hicks, take the

upper level.  Use your motion

trackers.

HICKS

Nothing.  No movement.

BURKE

Looks like my room in college.

RIPLEY

Wait!  Tell him to...

(plugs in

headset jack)

...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.

There!

HICKS

(voice over;

filtered)

You seeing this okay?  Looks

melted.

BURKE

Hmm.  Acid for blood.

HICKS

(voice over;

filtered)

Looks like somebody bagged them

one of Ripley's bad guys here.

HUDSON

Hey, if you like that, you're gonna

love this...

APONE

Second squad?  What's your status?

HICKS

(voice over;

filtered)

Just finished our sweep.

Nobody home.

APONE

(to Gorman)

The place is dead, Sir.  Whatever

happened, we missed it.

GORMAN

All right, the area's secured.

Let's go in and see what their

computer can tell us.

(into mike)

First team head for operations.

Hudson, see if you can get their

CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at

the south lock by the up-link

tower...

GORMAN

(voice over)

...We're coming in.

HUDSON

(cupping his mike)

He's coming in.  I feel safer

already.

VASQUEZ

(sotto voice)

Pendejo jerkoff.

HUDSON

(voice over;

filtered)

Sir, the CPU is on-line.

GORMAN

Okay, stand by in operations.

(to those present)

Let's go.

RIPLEY

(shouting)

Burke!

WIERZBOWSKI

Scare you?

RIPLEY

Christ, Wierzbowski!

WIERZBOWSKI

Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an

eye on you.

GORMAN

(to Burke)

Looks like you company can write

off its share of this colony.

BURKE

(unconcerned)

It's insured.

FRONT

Sir, you should check this out...

FROST

Right ahead here...

WIERZBOWSKI

Last stand.

GORMAN

No bodies?

FROST

No, Sir.  Looks like it was a

helluva fight.

RIPLEY

(low)

Over there.

BURKE

Are these the same...?

RIPLEY

Watch it, Burke...

HICKS

(to Burke)

It likes you.

BURKE

These are dead.  There's just

the two alive.

RIPLEY

(reading)

Removed surgically before embryo

implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,

John L.   Died during procedure.

(looking up)

They killed him getting it off.

HICKS

Poor bastard.

HICKS

Behind us.

RIPLEY

One of us?

GORMAN

(into headset)

Apone...where are your people?

Anybody in D-Block?

APONE

(voice over; filtered)

Negative.  We're all in Operations.

HICKS

It's moving.

VASQUEZ

Which way?

VASQUEZ

You fuck!

RIPLEY

(soothingly)

Come on out.  It's all right...

HICKS

Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

RIPLEY

It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...

you're going to be all right now...

it's okay...you're safe...

you.

GORMAN

Total brain-lock.

DIETRICH

(shrugs)

Physically she's okay.

Borderline malnutrition, but

I don't think any permanent

damage.

GORMAN

Come on, we're wasting our

time.

RIPLEY

Here, try this.  A little

instant hot chocolate.

RIPLEY

(soothing)

Poor thing.  You don't talk

much do you?  That's okay by

me.  Most people do a lot of

talking and they wind up not

saying very much.

RIPLEY

Uh oh.  I made a clean spot

here.  Now I've done it.  Guess

I'll just have to do the whole

thing.

RIPLEY

Hard to believe...there's a

little girl under all this.

And a pretty one at that.

BURKE

(to Gorman)

What's he scanning for?

GORMAN

PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters.

Every adult colonist had one

surgically implanted.

HUDSON

If they're within twenty

klicks we'll read it out here,

but so far...zip.

RIPLEY

I don't know how you managed

to stay alive but you're one

brave kid, Rebecca.

NEWT

N-newt.

RIPLEY

What did you say?

NEWT

Newt.  My n-name's Newt.

Nobody calls me Rebecca except

my dork brother.

RIPLEY

Well, Newt it is then.  My

name's Ripley...and people

call me Ripley.

RIPLEY

Pleased to meet you.  And who

is this?  Does she have a

name?

NEWT

Casey.  She's my only friend.

RIPLEY

What about me?

NEWT

I don't want you for a friend.

RIPLEY

Why not?

NEWT

Because you'll be gone soon,

like the others.  Like

everybody.  You'll be dead

and you'll leave me alone.

RIPLEY

Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad

went away like that, didn't

they?

RIPLEY

(soothingly)

They'd be here if they could,

honey.  I know they would.

NEWT

(with cold certainty)

They're dead.

RIPLEY

Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I

won't leave you.  I promise.

NEWT

You promise?

RIPLEY

Cross my heart.

NEWT

And hope to die?

RIPLEY

(quietly)

And hope to die.

HUDSON

Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and

drop your linen!  Found 'em.

GORMAN

Alive?

HUDSON

Unknown.  But, it looks like

all of them.  Over at the

processing station...sublevel

'C' under the south tower.

HICKS

Looks like a Goddamn town

meeting.

GORMAN

Let's saddle up.

APONE

Awright, let's go girls, they

ain't payin' us by the hour.

NEWT

I was the best at the game.

I knew the whole maze.

RIPLEY

The 'maze'?  You mean the

air ducts?

NEWT

Yeah, you know.  In the walls,

under the floor.  I was the

ace.  I could hide better

than anybody.

RIPLEY

You're really something, ace.

GORMAN

(voice over; static)

Forty meters in.  Ramp on

axial two-two.  Access to

sublevels.

GORMAN

(voice over; static)

B-Level.  Next one down.

GORMAN

(to team)

We're not making that out too

well.  What is it?

HUDSON

(voice over; static)

You tell me.  I only work

here.

GORMAN

What is it?

RIPLEY

I don't know.

GORMAN

(to team)

Proceed inside.

RIPLEY

(low)

Oh God...

DIETRICH

(voice over; static)

Looks like some sort of secreted

resin.

GORMAN

They ripped apart the colony

for building materials.

RIPLEY

And the colonists...When they

were done with them.

(turning)

Newt, you better go sit up

front.  Go on.

FROST

Hotter'n hell in here.

HUDSON

Yeah...but it's a dry

heat.

RIPLEY

They're right under the

primary heat exchangers.

BURKE

Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like

the heat, that's why they built...

RIPLEY

That's not what I mean.  Gorman,

if your men have to use their

weapons in there, they'll rupture

the cooling system.

BURKE

(realizing)

She's right.

GORMAN

So.

RIPLEY

So...then the fusion

containment shuts down.

GORMAN

(impatient)

So?  So?

BURKE

We're talking thermonuclear

explosion.

GORMAN

Shit.

(into

mike)

Apone, collect magazines

from everybody.  We can't

have any firing in there.

WIERZBOWSKI

Is he fucking crazy?

HUDSON

What're we supposed to use,

man?  Harsh language?

GORMAN

(voice over; static)

Flame-units only.  I want

rifles slung.

APONE

Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

HICKS

(low,

to Hudson)

I always keep this handy.

For close encounter.

APONE

(o.s.)

Let's move.  Hicks, back

us up.

GORMAN

(voice over;

very faint)

Any movement?

HUDSON

Nothing.  Zip.

DIETRICH

Sir!

WOMAN

Please...God...kill me.

APONE

Flame thrower!  Move!

HUDSON

Movement!

APONE

Position?

HUDSON

Can't lock up...

APONE

(with an edge)

Talk to me, Hudson.

HUDSON

Uh, seems to be in front

and behind.

GORMAN

We can't see anything back

here, Apone.  What's going on?

RIPLEY

(low)

Pull you team out, Gorman.

APONE

Go to infrared.  Looks sharp

people!

HUDSON

Multiple signals.  All round.

Closing.

VASQUEZ

Let's rock.

GORMAN

(voice over; static)

Who's firing?  I ordered a

hold fire, dammit!

HUDSON

(voice over)

Let's get the fuck out of

here!

HICKS

(voice over)

Not that tunnel, the other

one!

CROWE

(voice over)

You sure?  Watch it...behind

you.  Fucking move, will you!

RIPLEY

(to Gorman)

GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO

IT NOW!

GORMAN

Shut up.  Just shut up!

GORMAN

Uh,...Apone, I want you to

lay down a suppressing fire

with the incinerators and

fall back by squads to the

APC, over.

APONE

(voice over;

heavy static)

Say again?  All after

incinerators?

GORMAN

I said...

GORMAN

(voice over;

static)

...lay down (garbled) ...by

squads to...(garbled)

APONE

Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound

off!  Wierzbowski?

HUDSON

(freaked)

We're getting juked!  We're

gonna die in here!

APONE

Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck

the heat exchanger!

GORMAN

(distantly)

I told them to fall back...

RIPLEY

(viciously)

They're but off!  Do something!

RIPLEY

(in passing)

Newt, put your seatbelt on!

GORMAN

Ripley, what the hell...?

GORMAN

(shrill)

What are you doing?  Turn

around!  That's an order!

VASQUEZ

Drake!  He's down!

HICKS

He's gone!  Forget it, he's

gone!

VASQUEZ

(irrational)

No.. No, he's not.  He's --

HICKS

(to Ripley)

Let's go!

HICKS

Get on the Goddamn door!

105

HICKS

It's okay...we're clear.  We're

clear.  Ease up.

HICKS

Sounds like a blown transaxle.

You're just grinding metal.

RIPLEY

Newt?  Where's Newt?

RIPLEY

You okay?

HUDSON

Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe

it.

HUDSON

(jerking away)

I'm all right, leave it!

HICKS

He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

VASQUEZ

He's fucking dead!

VASQUEZ

(to Gorman)

Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill

you, you useless fuck!

HICKS

Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right

now.

RIPLEY

Looks like it stung him.

HUDSON

Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and

Dietrich aren't dead, man.

HUDSON

They must be like Gorman.  Their

signs are real low but they ain't

dead!

RIPLEY

You can't help them.  Right now

they're being cocooned just like

the others.

HUDSON

(sagging)

Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't

happening.

SPUNKMEYER

Need anything else?

VASQUEZ

All right, we can't blow the fuck

out of them...why not roll some

canisters of CN-20 down there.

Nerve gas the whole nest?

HUDSON

Look, man, let's just bug out and

call it even, okay?

RIPLEY

(to Vasquez)

No good.  How do we know it'll

effect their biochemistry?  I say

we take off and nuke the entire

site from orbit.  It's the only

way to be sure.

BURKE

Now hold on a second.  I'm not

authorizing that action.

RIPLEY

Why not?

BURKE

Well, I mean...I know this is an

emotional moment, but let's not

make snap judgments.  Let's move

cautiously.  First, this physical

installation had a substantial

dollar value attached to it --

RIPLEY

They can bill me.  I got a tab

running.  What's second?

BURKE

This is clearly an important

species we're dealing with here.

We can't just arbitrarily

exterminate them --

RIPLEY

Bullshit!

VASQUEZ

Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

HUDSON

Maybe you haven't been keeping up

on current events, but we just got

out asses kicked, pal!

RIPLEY

Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

BURKE

I know, I know, but we're dealing

with changing scenarios here.  This

thing is major, Ripley.  I mean

really major.  You gotta go with

its energy.  Since you are the

representative of the company who

discovered this species your

percentage will naturally be

some serious, serious money.

RIPLEY

You son of a bitch.

BURKE

(hardening)

Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

RIPLEY

What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks

has authority here.

BURKE

Corporal Hicks!?

RIPLEY

This operation is under military

jurisdiction and Hicks is next in

chain of command.  Right?

HICKS

Looks that way.

BURKE

Look, this is a multimillion

dollar operation.  He can't make

that kind of decision.  He's just

a grunt!

(glances at Hicks)

No offense.

HICKS

(coolly)

None taken.

(into mike)

Ferro, you copying?

FERRO

(voice over; static)

Standing by.

HICKS

Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna

need an immediate evac.

(to Burke)

I think we'll take off and nuke

the site from orbit.  It's the

only way to be sure.

BURKE

This is absurd!  You don't have

the authority to --

RIPLEY

We're going home, honey.

FERRO

Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

FERRO

(turning)

Where the fu --

RIPLEY

Run!

HUDSON

(hysterical)

Well that's great!  That's just

fucking great, man.  Now what the

fuck are we supposed to do, man?

We're in some real pretty shit now!

HICKS

Are you finished?

(to Ripley)

You okay?

NEWT

I guess we're not leaving, right?

RIPLEY

I'm sorry, Newt.

NEWT

You don't have to be sorry.  It

wasn't your fault.

HUDSON

(kicking rocks)

Just tell me what the fuck we're

supposed to do now.  What're we

gonna do now?

BURKE

(annoyed)

May be could build a fire and

sing songs.

NEWT

We should get back, 'cause it'll

be dark soon.  They come mostly

at night.  Mostly.

HICKS

This is all we could salvage.  We've

got four pulse-rifles with about

fifty rounds each.  Not so good.

About fifteen M-40 grenades and

two flame throwers less than

half full...one damaged.  And

We've got four of these

robot-sentry units with scanners

and display intact.

RIPLEY

How long after we're declared

overdue can we expect a rescue?

HICKS

About seventeen days.

HUDSON

Man, we're not going to make it

seventeen hours!  Those things

are going to come in here, just

like they did before, man...

they're going to come in here

and get us, man, long before...

RIPLEY

She survived longer than that

with no weapons and no training.

RIPLEY

So you better just start dealing

with it.  Just deal with it,

Hudson...because we need you and

I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now

get on a terminal and call up some

kind of floor plan file.

Construction blueprints,

maintenance schematics, anything

that shows the layout of this

place.  I want to see air ducts,

electrical access tunnels,

subbasements.  Every possible way

into this wing.

HUDSON

Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

BISHOP

I'll be in medical.  I'd like to

continue my analysis.

RIPLEY

Fine.  You do that.

RIPLEY

This service tunnel is how they're

moving back and forth.

HUDSON

Yeah, right, it runs from the

processing station right into

the sublevel here.

RIPLEY

All right.  There's a fire door

at this end.  The first thing we

do is put a remote sentry in the

tunnel and seal that door.

HICKS

We gotta figure on them getting

into the complex.

RIPLEY

That's right.  So we put up

welded barricades at these

intersections...

(pointing)

...and seal these ducts here

and here.  Then they can only

come at us from these two

corridors and we create a free

field of fire for the other

two sentry units, here.

HICKS

Outstanding.  Then all we need's

a deck of cards.  All right, let's

move like we got a purpose.

HUDSON

Aye-firmative.

NEWT

(imitating Hudson)

Aye-firmative!

VASQUEZ

(shouting)

Testing!

HUDSON

Hudson here.  A and B

sentries are in place and

keyed.  We're sealing the

tunnel.

HICKS

(into mike)

Roger.

HICKS

Here, put this on.  Then

I can locate you anywhere

in the complex on this --

HICKS

Just a...precaution.  You

know.

RIPLEY

(strapping

it on)

Thanks.

HUDSON

Uh, what's next?

RIPLEY

Now you just lie here and

have a nap.  You're exhausted.

NEWT

I don't want to...I have

scary dreams.

RIPLEY

I'll bet Casey doesn't have

bad dreams.

RIPLEY

Nothing bad in here.  Maybe

you could just try to be like

her.

NEWT

Ripley...she doesn't have

bad dreams because she's just

a piece of plastic.

RIPLEY

Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

NEWT

My mommy always said there

were no monsters.  No real

ones.  But there are.

RIPLEY

(quietly)

Yes, there are, aren't there.

NEWT

Why do they tell little kids

that?

RIPLEY

Well, some kids can't handle

it like you can.

NEWT

Did one of those things grow

inside her?

RIPLEY

I don't know, Newt.  That's

the truth.

NEWT

Isn't that how babies come?

I mean people babies...they

grow inside you?

RIPLEY

No, it's different, honey.

NEWT

Did you ever have a baby?

RIPLEY

Yes.  A little girl.

NEWT

Where is she?

RIPLEY

(quietly)

Gone.

NEWT

You mean dead.

NEWT

Ripley, I was just thinking...

Maybe I could do you a favor and

fill in for her.  Just for a

while.  You can try it and if

you don't like it, it's okay.

I'll understand.  No big deal.

Whattya think?

RIPLEY

I think it's not the worst idea

I've heard all day.  Let's talk

about it later.

NEWT

Don't go!  Please.

RIPLEY

I'll be right in the other

room, Newt.  And look...I can

see you on that camera right

up there.

RIPLEY

Here.  Take is for luck.  Now

go to sleep...and don't dream.

RIPLEY

(voice over)

How is he?

BISHOP

I've isolated a neuro-muscular

toxin responsible for the

paralysis.  It seems to be

metabolizing.  He should wake

up soon.

RIPLEY

Now let me get this straight.

The aliens paralyzed the colonists,

carried them over there,

cocooned them to be hosts for

more of those...

RIPLEY

Which would mean lots of

those parasites, right?  One

for each person...over a hundred

at least.

BISHOP

Yes.  That follows.

RIPLEY

But these things come from

eggs...so where are all the

eggs coming from.

BISHOP

That is the question of the

hour.  We could assume a parallel

to certain insect forms who

have hivelike organization.

An ant of termite colony, for

example, is ruled by a single

female, a queen, which is the

source of new eggs.

RIPLEY

You're saying one of those things

lays all the eggs?

BISHOP

Well, the queen is always physically

larger then the others.  A

termite queen's abdomen is so

bloated with eggs that it can't

move at all.  It is fed and tended

by drone workers, defended by

the warriors.  She is the center

of their lives, quite literally

the  mother of their society.

RIPLEY

Could it be intelligent?

BISHOP

Hard to say.  It may have been

blind instinct...attraction to

the heat of whatever...but she

did choose to incubate her eggs

in the one spot where we couldn't

destroy her without destroying

ourselves.  That's if she exists,

of course.

RIPLEY

(rising)

I want those specimens destroyed

as soon as you're done with them.

You understand?

BISHOP

Mr. Burke have instructions

that they were to be kept alive

in stasis for return to the

company labs.  He was very specific.

RIPLEY

Burke!

BURKE

Those specimens are worth

millions to the bio-weapons

division.  Now, if you're smart

we can both come out of this

heroes.  Set up for life.

RIPLEY

You just try getting a dangerous

organism past ICC quarantine.

Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

BURKE

You've been doing your homework.

Look, they can't impound it if

they don't know about it.

RIPLEY

But they will know about it, Burke.

From me.  Just like they'll know

how you were responsible for the

deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven

colonists here --

BURKE

Now, wait a second --

RIPLEY

(stepping on him)

You sent them to that ship.  I

just checked the colony log...

directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.

Signed Burke, Carter J.

RIPLEY

You sent them out there and you

didn't even warn them, Burke.

Why didn't you warn them?

BURKE

Look, maybe the thing didn't even

exist, right?  And if I'd made it

a major security situation, the

Administration would've stepped

in.  Then no exclusive rights,

nothing.

BURKE

It was a bad call, that's all.

RIPLEY

Bad call?  These people are fucking

dead, Burke!  Well, they're going

to nail your hide to the shed...

and I'll be there when they do.

BURKE

(sadly)

I expected more of you, Ripley.

I thought you would be smarter

than this.

RIPLEY

Sorry to disappoint you.

HICKS

They're coming.  They're in

the tunnel.

HICKS

Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing

on multiple targets.

HUDSON

They must be wall to wall in

there.  Look  at those ammo counters

go.  It's a shooting gallery down

there.

HICKS

B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.

Ten.  Five.  That's it.

RIPLEY

They're at the fire door.

HUDSON

Man, listen to that.

BISHOP

(voice over)

Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have

some bad news.

HUDSON

Well, that's a switch.

BISHOP

That's it.  See it?  Emergency

venting.

RIPLEY

How long until it blows?

BISHOP

I'm projecting total systems

failure in a little under four

hours.  The blast radius will be

about thirty kilometers.  About

equal to ten megatons.

HICKS

We got problems.

HUDSON

I don't fucking believe this.

Do you believe this?

RIPLEY

And it's too late to shut it down?

BISHOP

I'm afraid so.  The crash did too

much damage.  The overload is

inevitable, at this point.

HUDSON

Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,

too!  Four more weeks and out.

Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'

rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

VASQUEZ

Hudson, give us a break.

RIPLEY

(to Hicks)

We need the other drop-ship.  The

on one the Sulaco.  We have to

bring it down on remote, somehow.

HUDSON

How?  The transmitter was on the

APC.  It's wasted.

RIPLEY

(pacing)

I don't care how!  Think of a

way.  Think of something.

HUDSON

Think of what?  We're fucked.

RIPLEY

What about the colony transmitter?

That up-link tower down at the

other end.  Why can't we use that?

BISHOP

I checked.  The hard wiring

between here and there was severed

in the fighting.

RIPLEY

Well then somebody's just going

to have to go out there.  Take a

portable terminal and go out there

and plug in manually.

HUDSON

Oh, right!  Right!  With those

things running around.  No way.

BISHOP

(quietly)

I'll go.

RIPLEY

What?

BISHOP

I'm really the only one qualified

to remote-pilot the ship anyway.

Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I

may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

RIPLEY

All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll

you need?

VASQUEZ

Listen.  It's stopped.

HICKS

Well, they're into the complex.

BISHOP

This duct runs almost to the

up-link assembly.  One hundred

eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes

to crawl down there.  One hour

to patch in and align the antenna.

Thirty minutes to prep the ship,

then about fifty minutes flight time.

RIPLEY

It's going to be closer.  You

better get going.

BISHOP

(cheerfully)

See you soon.

HICKS

(voice over)

They're in the approach corridor.

RIPLEY

(into mike)

On my way.

HICKS

Twenty meters and closing.

Fifteen.  C and D guns down

about fifty percent.

RIPLEY

Now many?

HICKS

Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's

down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

RIPLEY

They retreated.  The guns stopped

them.

HICKS

Yeah.  But look...

HICKS

Newt time then can walk right

up and knock.

RIPLEY

But they don't know that.  They're

probably looking for other ways

to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

HUDSON

Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

HICKS

(to Vasquez

and Hudson)

I want you two walking the perimeter.

I know we're all in strung out

shape but stay frosty and alert.

We've got to stop any entries before

they get out of hand.

HICKS

How long since you slept?

Twenty-four hours?

RIPLEY

(grimly)

They'll get us.

HICKS

Maybe.  Maybe not.

RIPLEY

Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like

those others.  You'll take care of

it won't you, it if comes to that?

HICKS

If it comes to that, I'll do us

both.  Let's see that it doesn't

Here, I'd like to introduce you to

a close personal friend of mine.

HICKS

M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and

under with a 30mm pump-action

grenade launcher.

RIPLEY

What do I do?

HICKS

Just pull it in real right.  It

will kick some.  When the counter

here heads zero, hit this...

HICKS

Just let it drop right out.  Get

the other one in quick.  Just

slap it in hard, it likes abuse.

Now, pull the bolt.

HICKS

You're ready again.

RIPLEY

What's this?

HICKS

Well, that's the grenade launcher

...you probably don't want to

mess with that.

RIPLEY

Look, you started this.  Now show

me everything.  I can handle myself.

HICKS

Yeah.  I've noticed.

RIPLEY

How do you feel?

GORMAN

All right, I guess.  One hell

of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...

I...

RIPLEY

Forget it.

GORMAN

You still want to kill me?

VASQUEZ

(turning away)

It won't be necessary.

RIPLEY

There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all

right.

BISHOP

(to himself)

Now, if I did it right...

FEMALE VOICE

Attention.  Attention.  Automatic

fueling operations have begun.

Please extinguish all smoking

materials.

RIPLEY

(whispers)

Newt.  Newt, wake up.

NEWT

Wah...?  Where are...?

RIPLEY

(whispers)

Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in

trouble.

RIPLEY

(shouting)

Hey...hey!

RIPLEY

Hicks!  Hicks!

HICKS

(into mike)

Roger.  Check back when you've

activated the ship.

(turning)

He's at the up-link tower.

BURKE

(calmly)

Excellent.

NEWT

Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

NEWT

Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm

scared.

RIPLEY

I know, honey.  Me too.

HICKS

Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in

medical!  We got a fire!

HICKS

The corner!  Ready?

HUDSON

Do it!

RIPLEY

(coughing)

Burke...it was Burke.

HUDSON

(intense)

I say we grease this rat-fuck

son of a bitch right now!

HICKS

(pacing)

I don't get it.  It doesn't

make any Goddamn sense.

RIPLEY

He wanted an alien, only he

couldn't get it back through

quarantine.  But if we were impregnated

...whatever you call it...and then

frozen for the trip back at just

the right time...then nobody would

know about the embryos we were carrying.

We and Newt.

HICKS

Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

RIPLEY

The only way it would work is if

he sabotaged certain freezers

on the trip back.  Then he could

jettison the bodies and make up

any story he liked.

HUDSON

Fuuuck!  He's dead.

(to Burke)

You're dogmeat, pal.

BURKE

This is total paranoid delusion.

It's pitiful.

RIPLEY

(wearily)

You know, Burke, I don't know

which species is worse.  You don't

see them screwing each other over

for a fucking percentage.

HICKS

(serious)

Let's waste him.

(to Burke)

No offense.

RIPLEY

Just find someplace to lock him

up until it's time to --

RIPLEY

They cut the power.

HUDSON

What do you mean, they cut the

power?  How could they cut the

power, man?  They're animals.

RIPLEY

Newt!  Stay close.

(to the others)

Let's get some trackers going.

Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch

Burke.

RIPLEY

(voice over)

Anything?

HUDSON

There's something.

HUDSON

It's inside the complex.

VASQUEZ

(voice over)

You're just reading me.

HUDSON

No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're

inside.  Inside the perimeter.

They're in here.

RIPLEY

Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

VASQUEZ

(cool)

Hudson may be right.

HICKS

(low)

It's game time.

RIPLEY

Get back here, both of you.  Fall

back to Operations.

HUDSON

This signal's weird...must be

some interference or something.

There's movement all over the

place...

RIPLEY

(voice over)

Just get back here!

HUDSON

Movement!  Signal's clean.

HUDSON

Range twenty meters.

RIPLEY

(to Vasquez)

Seal the door.

HUDSON

Seventeen meters.

HICKS

Let's get these things lit.

RIPLEY

They learned.  They cut the power

and avoided the guns.  They must

have found another way in, something

we missed.

HICKS

We didn't miss anything.

HUDSON

Fifteen meters.

RIPLEY

I don't know, an acid hole in

a duct.  Something under the

floors, not on the plans.

I don't know!

HUDSON

Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big

fucking signal.  Ten meters.

RIPLEY

They're right on us.  Vasquez,

how you doing?

HUDSON

Nine meters.  Eight.

RIPLEY

Can't be.  That's inside the room!

HUDSON

It's readin' right.  Look!

HICKS

Well you're not reading it right!

HUDSON

Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

RIPLEY

Medical!  Get to medical!

RIPLEY

Burke!  Open the door!

NEWT

Look!

HUDSON

(hysterical)

Let's go!  Let's go!

HICKS

Fuckin' A!

HICKS

(o.s.)

Hold you fire!

RIPLEY

(indicating door)

Locked.

HICKS

Stand back.

GORMAN

You can't use those in here!

VASQUEZ

Right.  Fire in the hole!

HICKS

(shouting at Vasquez)

Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

VASQUEZ

(shouting)

What?

CUT TO:

NEWT

Come on!  This way.

RIPLEY

Stay behind me.

NEWT

Come on.  Crawl faster.

RIPLEY

DO you know how to get to the

landing field from here?

NEWT

Sure.  Go left.

NEWT

Go right.

HICKS

(into headset)

Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

BISHOP

(voice over;

static)

Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

BISHOP

(yelling;

over enunciating)

The ship is on its way.  ETA

about sixteen minutes.  I've

got my hands full flying...

the weather's come up a bit.

HICKS

All right, stand by there.  We're

on out way.  Over.

RIPLEY

Back.  Go back!

VASQUEZ

(icy)

Losing fuel.

VASQUEZ

(hoarse whisper)

You always were an asshole, Gorman.

NEWT

This way.  Come on, we're almost

there!

RIPLEY

Newt, wait!

NEWT

Here!  Go up.

NEWT

Just up there --

NEWT

Riiiiipppleee --

RIPLEY

Newt!

NEWT

(o.s.)

Mommy...where are you?

NEWT

(o.s.)

Moooommeeee...

RIPLEY

(to her headset)

Hicks, get down here.  I need

that locator.

RIPLEY

(o.s.)

Newt!  Star wherever you are!

HICKS

This way.  We're close...

NEWT

Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

RIPLEY

Climb down, honey.  We have to

cut through this grate.

RIPLEY

Newt!  Newt!

RIPLEY

No!  Noooo!

HICKS

(intense)

She's gone!  Let's go!

RIPLEY

No!  No!  She's alive!  We

have to --

HICKS

All right!  She's alive.  I

believe it.  But we gotta get

moving!  Now!

RIPLEY

Come on, you can make it.

Almost there.

RIPLEY

HOW MUCH TIME?

BISHOP

PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

RIPLEY

WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

BISHOP

Ripley...

RIPLEY

She's alive.  They brought her

here and you know it.

BISHOP

In seventeen minutes this place

will be a cloud of vapor the

size of Nebraska.

RIPLEY

Hicks, don't let him leave.

HICKS

(grimacing with

pain)

We ain't going anywhere.

RIPLEY

See you, Hicks.

HICKS

Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

RIPLEY

Ellen.

HICKS

(nods with

satisfaction)

Don't be long, Ellen.

VOICE

Attention.  Emergency.  All

personnel must evacuate

immediately.  You now have

fourteen minutes to reach

minimum safe distance.

BURKE

Ripley...help me.  I can feel

it...inside.  Oh, God...it's

moving!  Oh gooood...

RIPLEY

Here.

VOICE

You now have eleven minutes to

reach minimum safe distance.

NEWT

(weakly)

I knew you'd come.

RIPLEY

Newt, I want you to hang on,

now.  Hang on tight.

179

VOICE

You now have two minutes

to reach minimum safe

distance.

183

RIPLEY

BISHOP!

RIPLEY

(hysterical)

BISHOP!

RIPLEY

(to Newt; low)

Close your eyes, baby.

VOICE

You now have thirty seconds to

reach...

187

RIPLEY

Punch it, Bishop!

RIPLEY

It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's

over.

BISHOP

I gave him a shot, for the pain.

We'll need to get a stretcher to

cart him up to medical.

BISHOP

I'm sorry if I gave you a scare

but that platform was just becoming

too unstable...

BISHOP

I had to circle and hope things

didn't get too rough to take you

off.

RIPLEY

You did okay, Bishop.

BISHOP

Well, thanks, I --

RIPLEY

(to Newt)

Go!

RIPLEY

Here!

RIPLEY

Get away from her, you bitch!

RIPLEY

(screaming)

Come on!

BISHOP

Not bad for a human.

NEWT

(weakly)

Mommy...Mommy?

RIPLEY

Right here, baby.  Right here.

NEWT

Are we going to sleep now?

RIPLEY

That's right.

NEWT

Can we dream?

RIPLEY

Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

FADE OUT

THE END
