"48 HRS." -- Unknown draft/writers

BRADY

Wonder what reservation they let

him off of...

GANZ

Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

BILLY

Say, buddy, my engine's

overheating and I got 30 miles

before the next station... Could

I get some water out of your

cooler?

GANZ

Maybe you shoulda stole a better

truck, Tonto.

BILLY

You got a real big mouth, convict.

BRADY

It's okay, chief.  He's just

joking...

BILLY

How about the water...

GANZ

Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what

you...

BRADY

Hey! Jesus Christ!

BRADY

That's a state prisoner,

asshole...! Back off...

GANZ

Come on...

OFFICER

APO 657, Unit 25 to APO 478t APO

657t Unit 25 to APO 478.

RADIO RESPONSE

Go ahead, Unit 25.

OFFICER

Escape in progress. Two officers

shot off rail crossing 31.

Prisoners escaping. Two men, one

six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an

Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,

five-ten...

BILLY

Get ready to duck.

GANZ

You know something? I'm having a

real good time.

CATES

Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....

And you're wanted.

ELAINE

What am I wanted for?

CATES

I don't answer questions, I ask

'em...

ELAINE

I don't think your gun's loaded...

CATES

This is a .44 Magnum, the most

powerful handgun in the world. You

gotta ask yourself just one

question. Are you feelin' lucky?

ELAINE

I still don't think it's loaded.

CATES

Hey, you're right.

ELAINE

You're hopeless.

CATES

That's the way I see it, too.

ELAINE

I'm all wet.

CATES

What's wrong with that?

ELAINE

A guy in the bar called me a dumb

bitch today.

CATES

What'd you do?

ELAINE

Irrigated his face with the shot

of J and B I'd just poured him.

Then I tried to deck the sucker.

CATES

I guess he got the message...

ELAINE

Then I sit back and I think, I

mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb

bitch.  I work in a bar, right?

I can't read a list of my academic

credentials to every booze-hound

that comes in the place... You are

what you do...

CATES

Positive self-image problem all

over again ... You are who you

decide you are unless you're the

type that lets assholes decide for

you.

ELAINE

Aren't you the one that thinks all

psychotherapy is bullshit?

CATES

I do think all psychotherapy is

bullshit. But just because I think

it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't

know something about it.

ELAINE

If this is your idea of

sympathetic interest in my

problems, I'll take brutal

indifference.

CATES

Hey, you know what I really think?

ELAINE

Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

CATES

I think you're ashamed to tend bar

which is sad because you look

great in that outfit they make you

wear... You pull down four bills

a week which is damn good, and you

mix the best Pina Coladas I've

ever had... I think that if you

need bigger and better things ...

then go for em.

ELAINE

You oversimplify every...

CATES

Some things are simple, right?

ELAINE

Right...

BILLY

You got somethin' for us, Henry?

GANZ

How hot are they?

HENRY

Hot?  Hey, they're not even room

temperature.

GANZ

How ya doin'?

HENRY

Can't complain.

GANZ

We got a lot to talk about.

HENRY

Yeah, old times.

GANZ

We'll follow you.  Take it

slow,okay?

HENRY

Sure, right.

GANZ

I want to drive awhile.

BILLY

I ain't tired yet.

GANZ

Maybe after we get done with him

I'm gonna buy us some girls.

BILLY

Whaddya mean, buy?

GANZ

Pros.

BILLY

Pay money?

GANZ

Yeah, dummy.  Money.

BILLY

I never paid for it in my life.

GANZ

It's better when you pay... they

let you do anything.

BILLY

They always let me do anything. I

don't want to pay for it.  I never

paid for it in my life.

GANZ

Just do what I say, okay? We'll

pay for the girls and have a good

time... Don't you trust me?

BILLY

Sure, I trust ya.

ELAINE

You know, if you let me come over

to your place once in a while, you

could put on a clean shirt in the

morning.

CATES

What makes you think I have any

clean shirts at my place?

ELAINE

You know, that's my toothbrush,

Jack.

CATES

Maybe you ought to buy me one.

ELAINE

Maybe I would if I knew when you

were coming back.

CATES

I'm here.  And I've been coming

back for quite awhile... Let's not

hassle, okay?  And can I have a

cup of coffee?  Please.

ELAINE

That's a fairly crummy way to

start a morning.

CATES

Maybe I got a fairly crummy day

ahead.

ELAINE

Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

CATES

Maybe you don't know what the hell

you're talking about.

ELAINE

When you start with that

attitude... it's like I don't know

who you are.

CATES

What do you want to know?  What

difference does it make?  I'm the

guy in your bed the last three

months.  I make you feel good. You

make me feel good.  What the hell

else do you want from a guy?

ELAINE

I wish you'd stop trying to make

me mad so I won't care for you...

I wish you'd give me a little more

of a chance.

CATES

I don't have time for this. I

gotta go to work.

CATES

(continuing)

Look, I'm glad I'm in your life...

and hell, with an ass like yours,

I figure anything might be

possible.

ELAINE

You know something, Jack, you

really are hopeless.

CATES

That's the way I see it, too.

ELAINE

Call me later.

CATES

You sure you want me to?

ELAINE

Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

CATES

Thanks for the coffee.

ELAINE

I think you forgot this. Hands him

his wallet and badge...

CATES

Guess people ought to know who I

am...

ELAINE

Jack, wait.  Here...

ELAINE

(continuing)

It's cold as hell out these

mornings, and you know what the

man said, the coldest winter I

ever spent was the summer I spent

in San Francisco...

CATES

Son of a bitch.

ROSALIE

I liked that carpet we saw.

LUTHER

We can't afford it.

ROSALIE

Don't remind me.

LUTHER

Whaddya want me to do, go out and

steal for the money?  I hated the

color anyway; the color sucked...

GANZ

Surprise, Luther.

LUTHER

Whaddya want?  I thought you were

locked up-

GANZ

I want the money, asshole, what do

you think?  The money that Reggie

hid...

LUTHER

I don't know what you're talkin'

about.

GANZ

You want that Indian to snap her

neck?

GANZ

(continuing)

Instead of worryin' about Reggie,

you better worry about me...

LUTHER

Don't give me this, we were

partners.

GANZ

Billy, go ahead, break it...

LUTHER

No! Don't kill her.  I can get you

the money.

GANZ

When?

LUTHER

I can't get it until Monday.

Honest.

GANZ

You chickenshit punk...

LUTHER

Honest. The place we stashed it

opens Monday morning. I can't get

it till then. Monday morning,

that's when it opens. After that,

I'll get the money to you right

away...

GANZ

I always liked you, Luther. You

were always a lotta fun to hang

out with...

GANZ

(continuing)

We're gonna keep her.

LUTHER

Come on, you can trust me. Please.

GANZ

You try to mess with us or go to

the cops, I promise you, I'll put

holes in her you wouldn't believe.

GANZ

Nice place, huh?

ROSALIE

What are you gonna do to me in

there?

GANZ

Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut

your throat.

BILLY

He's just kiddin', you just keep

doin' what I tell ya, you'll be

okay.

GANZ

We need some rooms for a couple of

nights...Okay?

FRIZZY

Sure.  We don't get many real

customers, ya know?  Most people

only stay an hour or two...

GANZ

I want her young.  And tall. Nice

legs. Legs are important. Then,

real thin.  Yeah.  NO jeans-A

dress? a nice summer dress.  You

know I want her fresh... I'll tell

you why, because I been hoein'

weeds and makin' license plates

for a couple of years... Yeah, I

know you don't get it...

BILLY

Hey, what about me?

GANZ

And I need one more for my pal.

Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not

a turban, you know, a squaw.

GANZ

Walden Hotel. Third near Broadway.

Tell them to ask for ... uh...

GANZ

(continuing)

G.P. Polson...P.O.L.S.O.N....Just

be a couple of hours.

FRIZZY

Number twenty-seven, Mr. Polson.

GANZ

Put them next door, okay.

FRIZZY

Sure, hey, you got the whole floor

to yourself...

GANZ

Keep your filthy ideas to

yourself, lady.

CATES

Hey, fellas, what's happening?

Radio said you guys had something

on...

ALGREN

Not much, Jack ... Salesman named

Polson had his credit cards

lifted...

ALGREN

(continuing)

One of Polson's cards rented that

green coupe.

VANZANT

Not too much for a big rough tough

gunfighter like you to do on this

one...

CATES

Suspect packed or is this a

laugher?

ALGREN

Five and dime stuff. Polson said

a kid with a switchblade mugged

him and drove off on a motorcyle.

CATES

Yeah, well, I guess you two are

experts at taking boy scout knives

away from teenagers...

VANZANT

Yeah, we are, that means you can

stay outta this one. We don't have

any big need for the artillery

CATES

Hey, I'm just offering to help

out... I like to watch real pros

work.

VANZANT

Help, huh?  Sometimes your kind of

help tends to leave the suspect in

bad shape.

ALGREN

Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna

come inside, fine... You can stake

out the lobby...

CATES

Fine, it's your show...

FRIZZY

Aw, you guys were in last week.

You better ask around.  I'm not

supposed to be hassled... I got

friends.

VANZANT

Hey, park the tongue for a second,

sweetpants, we just want to search

a room.

FRIZZY

Not unless you got a warrant.

CATES

Maybe you should of been a lawyer

instead of a dumb skirt workin'

behind a register.

FRIZZY

Aw, come on, what the shit is this?

ALGREN

We're looking for a guy going

under the name Polson...

FRIZZY

Okay, big deal.  Get it over with.

CATES

Mr. Polson, room 27...

ALGREN

Is he alone?

FRIZZY

Naw, his sister went up an hour

ago.

VANZANT

Okay, like we said, you stake out

the lobby.

CATES

Sure. Great. Whatever.

VANZANT

You're not missing out on

Dillinger. This punk just stole

some credit cards.

LISA

Hey...

GANZ

Shut up.

LISA

What the hell's wrong?  I didn't

do anything.

LISA

(continuing)

What do you want?  What's goin' on?

GANZ

Shut up.

GANZ

(continuing)

Now ask who it is.

GANZ

(continuing)

Come on, ask.

LISA

Who is it?

ALGREN

Police... open up.

GANZ

Stall.

LISA

What do you want?

VANZANT

Police business. Come on, open up.

GANZ

Keep stallin'.

LISA

Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

LISA

Just a second.

MEXICAN GIRL

Que paso? Que esta pasando? No

entiendo...

BILLY

Shut up.

BILLY

(continuing)

When I say jump, girl, you better

jump.

BILLY

(continuing)

GANZ

He'll blow her goddamn head off.

ROSALIE

No. No.

GANZ

You.  Drop it and we won't kill

her.

GANZ

(continuing)

Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn

piece.

ALGREN

Do it, Cates.

ALGREN

(continuing)

Do it, Cates.  Goddamn it, do it.

GANZ

Kick it over here.

GANZ

(continuing)

Get the car.

GANZ

(continuing)

Your gun's just like mine.

CATES

You lying son of a bitch...

GANZ

What are you talking about? We

didn't kill her ...

FAT COP

What happened?

CATES

Read the report.

OLD COP

Two cops blown away by a credit

card booster... that don't figure.

CATES

No shit.

FAT COP

They were good cops.

CATES

They were good cops who fucked up

and got careless.

YOUNG COP

That's what you say, Cates...

CATES

Yeah.

YOUNG COP

But that's what you say about all

of us all the tine ... we're

always the ones fucking up when

you tell it...

CATES

The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

OLD COP

It don't figure.

CATES

I need to borrow a piece.

YOUNG COP

Somebody steals your gun, you're

supposed to file a report.

CATES

Are you gonna tell me about police

procedure?  Do me a favor, don't

give me a bunch of crap.

YOUNG COP

I guess when two cops die on

account of your fuck up you want

to keep it as quiet as possible...

CATES

Just shut the fuck up.

HADEN

Cates, I'll need to see you in

five minutes, exactly five.

OLD COP

Best I can do.

HADEN

D'you read me, Cates...

CATES

Five minutes.  I heard you, your

voice carries...

RUTH

They're still wet.

RUTH

(continuing)

Lots of people getting shot with

.44's lately ... Last year, it was

Saturday Night Specials..now it's

heavy stuff. People must be

getting madder about something.

POLICEWOMAN

You're an accessory to Murder One,

so you're going to have to do a

whole lot better than what we got

down here, honey...

LISA

Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I

got there.  He was a trick just

like any other for all I knew.

That's all there is.  He didn't

feel like sitting and talking. He

was in a big hurry to get laid.

I was with him about an hour...

DETECTIVE

We got a print from the hotel

room.  Guy's real name is Ganz,

Albert Ganz.  A hitter from back

East but he worked out here a few

years back.  Armed robbery. Broke

out of prison two days ago and

capped two of the guards. A real

animal.  Wait'll you see this...

CATES

Did he give you a return match?

LISA

He wasn't interested.

CATES

Maybe he didn't like your

performance.

LISA

Fuck you.

CATES

I'll take a raincheck...

RUTH

This'll interest you, Jack...we've

got something here from your

gun... and these are from the

first weapon Ganz used...

CATES

I don't get it.

RUTH

Here.

CATES

RUTH

A perfect match for the markings

from the first gun he used... but

not from the Walden Hotel... fired

at least six hours earlier...at

point blank range... right between

the eyes.  Found him on a park

bench...

RUTH

(continuing)

Ya know, there are some very bad

people out there in the world.

CATES

Look at it this way, Ruth.  If

there weren't, what would there be

for us to do?

LISA

Anyway... so I got there and took

him down.  He started watching

television and then you

sensational people started banging

on the door... that's all...

except ... he's gonna give you

guys a hard time.

CATES

POLICEWOMAN

What makes you think so?

LISA

I think he liked shooting cops a

lot more than getting laid.

CATES

Is that what this guy Ganz had in

the hotel?

KEHOE

Every last bit of it.  The big

guy's room was empty.

CATES

I'll help you out.

KEHOE

This guy must have had a .44 like

yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

CATES

Shit.

KEHOE

This cat was real serious about

his artillery.

CATES

Billy Bear...

KEHOE

Backup man from the East Bay.

Worked with Ganz a few years ago

and sprung him from the road gang.

CATES

Who are all these?

KEHOE

They all pulled a bunch of jobs

with Ganz about four years ago.

CATES

Wait a minute, wait a minute...

who's this?

KEHOE

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was

in on the same job.

CATES

Tell me that's not the same guy.

KEHOE

Hey ... Dick Tracy.

RUTH

Did Ganz have a grudge against his

old friends?

HADEN

Get in here, Cates.

CATES

I think I wanna have a discussion

about it with any of the ones

still walking.  Can we find them?

KEHOE

Here's the file. Cates checks the

file.

CATES

One of  em's in the slam.

HADEN

Damn you, Cates ... Get in here.

CATES

I want to be left alone on this

one. Algren was killed with my gun.

HADEN

Yeah, I read the report...

CATES

Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I

want it back.

HADEN

Jack, come on, there is an

official department policy about

cop killings. Cop killers

represent a special priority

because any man crazy enough to

kill a cop is a greater threat to

an unarmed civilian... In other

words, we can't seen like we're in

the revenge business... I know, we

all know the truth's a little

different.

CATES

Yeah...

HADEN

Anthing botherin' you besides

losin' your gun?

CATES

Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get

hurt while I'm makin' a play. I

don't like it.

HADEN

You might be more of a team player

and a little less of a hot dog on

this one, Jack.

CATES

Being a hot dog's worked pretty

well for me so far... Besides, I

got a lead...

HADEN

Okay.  You're not a team player.

You gotta do things your own way.

Fine.  Nail this guy and make us

all look good.  But you better

watch your ass.  If you screw up,

I can promise you, you're goin'

down.

CATES

You really know how to send a guy

out with a great attitude. He

starts to go.

HADEN

Jack?

CATES

Yeah?

HADEN

Try not to get your ass shot to

pieces. We got enough dead cops on

this one.

CATES

I'll keep it in mind.

ELAINE

Great place for lunch.

CATES

Yeah, one of my favorites.

ELAINE

You made the front page.

CATES

Yeah, Guess it must have been a

slow news day...

ELAINE

Jack, are you okay?

CATES

Sure, okay, fine, no problem...

See, there's this kid in jail ...

First thing I got to do is go up

and see what he knows ...

ELAINE

I thought you might come over to

my place to recuperate.  I don't

have to go to work until the day

after tomorrow.

CATES

I got nothing to recuperate from.

There's a guy out there with my

gun, and I want it back.

ELAINE

Look, spare me the macho bullshit

about your gun...

CATES

Bullshit?  I'll tell you about

bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon

in the hands of a real maniac who

knows how to use it.  It isn't my

macho bullshit that's killing

people, my gun is ...

ELAINE

Look, Jack, if you make everything

your personal responsibility,

you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's

not a practical way to function...

CATES

I didn't get burned, two cops did.

Listen, I'll tell you about

personnel responsibility.  I like

to get the job done right.  And if

I don't get my job done right...

I'm for shit.

ELAINE

Here it comes again ... the sacred

job...

CATES

That's right.  I'm not like you.

I'm not gonna sit on my ass

wondering what's right and what's

wrong... There's a psycho out

there killing people with my gun

and I'm gonna get him.  Because

it's my job. And if you don't get

that...

ELAINE

I get that. The job first.

Everything else, especially me,

second. I get it. I don't like it.

CATES

No one asked you to like it... But

that's the way it is.

GUARD

Open Nine.

GUARD

Close Nine.

GUARD

(continuing)

It's Number Twenty-two... You want

company?

CATES

No, no thanks.

CATES

Hammond.

CATES

(continuing)

Hammond!

CATES

(continuing)

Hammond!

HAMMOND

You got a name, cop?

CATES

Try Cates.  And let's talk in

private, okay?

HAMMOND

Sure, anything you want.

CATES

Look, convict, I know all about

you. Single.  No fixed address. No

known relatives.

One previous conviction. Armed

robbery... six months to go on a

three-year sentence.

HAMMOND

You here to write my life story?

CATES

Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just

need some help.

HAMMOND

Henry Wong... My old pal.  He's

looked better...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Look, I got just six months before

gettin' out of here.  Six months

between me and freedom after bein'

here three years... And I'm not

gonna do anything to screw it up,

includin' pee in the prison yard,

knock up the Warden's daughter or

rat on my old partners...

CATES

Too bad, Reggie.  I thought maybe

you were a smart boy.  But I guess

if you were real smart you

wouldn't be a convict.

CATES

(continuing)

I can see a second-rater like you

wouldn't be any help at all goin'

up against a real hard case like

Ganz.

HAMMOND

Ganz?

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Ganz the one who shot Henry?

Cates, I asked you a question...

CATES

Yeah, I noticed...

HAMMOND

Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be

there two years after I'm on the

street.

CATES

Didn't work out that way.  He

busted out with a big Indian.

They capped two guards on a road

gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

HAMMOND

Cates, Come back here.

CATES

Yeah?

HAMMOND

I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta

get me outta here first.

CATES

You're crazy.

HAMMOND

I can help you, man, but you gotta

get me out.  I got to be on the

street.  Get me outta here.

CATES

What's the big deal about you

bein' on the street?

HAMMOND

I got a lot to protect.

CATES

Bullshit.

HAMMOND

It's the only way you're gonna get

Ganz.

CATES

I'll think about it.

CATES

Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

BOB

You going to use your own name?

CATES

Shit, no.

CANDY

BOB

Jack, just remember one thing. If

all this comes down, you don't

know me.  I'm not gonna burn for

you.  And I'll tell you something

else.  If it all comes down, your

ass is new-mown grass.

CATES

Right.  Hey, no sweat.

BOB

BOB You got him for 48 hours.

BOB

(continuing)

You got a big career as a forger

if you decide to go that way,

Jack...   I'll ring security.

GUARD

Prisoner G21355 ... Hammond.

SECOND GUARD

Okay.  Send him through.

GUARD

Gotta sign for him.

CATES

Sure thing...

CATES

(continuing)

This prison gives out $400 suits?

HAMMOND

What are you talkin' about?  This

suit's mine.  It cost $900.

CATES

We're supposed to be after a

killer, not a string of hookers...

HAMMOND

Listen, it may be a little out of

date. You know, I got a reputation

for lookingreal sharp with the

ladies...

GUARD

He's all yours.

HAMMOND

We could change this for something

good...Get you lookin' sharp for

pussy.

CATES

I don't need to hear your jive. I

already got that department taken

care of...

HAMMOND

You got a girl... shit... the

generosityof women never ceases to

amaze me.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Hey, no way.  Take off the

bracelets or no deal.

CATES

You just don't get it, do your

Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I

own your ass.

HAMMOND

No way to start a partnership.

CATES

Get this.  We ain't partners. We

ain't brothers.  We ain't friends.

I'm puttin' you down and keepin'

you down until Ganz is locked up

or dead.  And if Ganz gets away,

you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

HAMMOND

Shit.  I'm already sorry.

?

TRANSITION.

HAMMOND

This your car, man?

CATES

Yeah.

HAMMOND

It looks like you bought it off

one of the brothers.

CATES

Okay, let's get down to it.  I did

my part and got you out.  So now

you tell me where we're goin'?

HAMMOND

Don't worry, I got a move for ya.

An awesome move. A guy named

Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a

visit.  We go to him right away.

CATES

Luther was part of the gang?

HAMMOND

What gang you talkin' about, Jack?

CATES

I can read a police file,

shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

HAMMOND

Just an expression man, don't mean

nothin'.

CATES

I don't give a damn.  It happens

to be my name.

HAMMOND

Then what're you complainin'

about? At least nobody's calling

you shithead....

CATES

I may call you worse than that.

HAMMOND

Just up the street, the other

side, over there ... Now, don't

bother knockin' on the door.

Luther ain't the kind of guy that

looks for company.

CATES

Your pal nuts enough to take a

shot at me?

HAMMOND

Luther ain't the reliable type. I

don't want you shot yet, Cates ...

not before you been a help to me.

CATES

I'm helpin' you, huh?

HAMMOND

Yeah. Didn't you know that?

HAMMOND

Over there...232...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

You better let me borrow one of

those.

CATES

Sure thing, asshole.

CATES

(continuing)

You just hang on.  And hope this

big move of yours turns out to be

something. Opens the car door.

CATES

(continuing)

CATES

Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun.

HAMMOND

Quit playin' cop and undo this

cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this

man.

CATES

I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam

gun.

HAMMOND

I got a whole thing about people

pointin' guns at me.

CATES

Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

HAMMOND

Luther, I always told you the

physical side of life wasn't your

gig.  Look at you, all messed

up... Course you never were much

in the snappy dresser department,

were you?

CATES

Come on, talk to him.

HAMMOND

What's happening, Luther?

LUTHER

I thought you were inside...

HAMMOND

Meet my travel Agent.

LUTHER

A cop...

CATES

I sure ain't his fairy

godmother... now I'm looking for

Ganz...where is he?

LUTHER

Haven't seen him for years. That's

the truth.

CATES

You just took a shot at me,

asshole. I think you do know where

he is.

LUTHER

Who gives a fuck what you think?

CATES

Hey, this works pretty good.

HAMMOND

Thank you.

CATES

Want to try it again?

LUTHER

Ganz and Billy got my girl,

Rosalie.

CATES

I think I met her.  Now tell us

something we don't know, like

where they stashed her.

LUTHER

I don't know.

HAMMOND

I gotta tell you he's having a

ball with this car door, Luther...

You'd better think of somethin' to

tell him.

LUTHER

He ... he wants me to help him

skip town.

CATES

When? How?

LUTHER

I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

LUTHER

(continuing)

He's gonna call me on...Tuesday.

CATES

What do you think?

HAMMOND

I think you better put him on ice,

man.

CATES

He's gotta take that call ... if

there is one.

HAMMOND

If you let him run around till

Tuesday, he's gonna run right to

Ganz and warn him. Ain't you,

motherfucker?

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Luther, are you angry with me?

CATES

I don't know what the hell you're

smiling about, watermelon. Your

big move turned out to be shit.

CATES

Assault on a police officer with

a deadly weapon.  Carrying a

concealed weapon.  Resisting

arrest, Disturbing the peace.

Public nuisance...

CATES

(continuing)

I'll think up a few more and file

the report tomorrow.

CATES

(continuing)

Come on, I gotta make a phone call.

CATES

(continuing)

You stay with me.

CATES

(continuing)

This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

ELAINE

Just one.  Some lady called.  Said

she's a little hot-headed

sometimes... But she still wants

her occasional roommate. She'd

like to talk it over after she

gets off work tonight... if it's

humanly possible....

CATES

Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of

sone stuff right now... I'm not

gonna have time to come by. I

don't know when I can get there.

ELAINE

Come on, Jack ... you're making me

work too Goddamn hard at this...

CATES

Listen, Goddamn it if you think

I'm happy about it, you're nuts.

I just gotta take care of a few

things, okay?

ELAINE

This is not the way people who

care for each other are supposed

to behave.

HAMMOND

Excuse me, ladies, you seem to be

in need of assistance.

HOOKER TWO

Look, we got enough problems, we

don't need no tight-ass court-

appointed lawyer trying to

bullshit us!

HAMMOND

Sweetheart, I'm not trying to

bullshit you. I don't know whether

or not you ladies heard but the

city is coming down real hard on

people practicing unlawful carnal

knowledge.

HOOKER ONE

So what are you trying to say,

fella?

HAMMOND

I'm trying to say that you're not

just walk in that courtroom and

get gonna slapped with a $50 fine

and be back on the street turning

tricks tonight. You both are going

to do some time. About 30 days

each... Unless, of course,we talk

real business.

HOOKER TWO

So where do you want to do it,

honey? You wanna hop up on the

counter?

HAMMOND

No, we can go to the back room.

CATES

We're on the move. Let's go. As

they walk toward a corridor.

HAMMOND

Do you know how close I was to

getting some trim.  And you

fucked' it up.

CATES

Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you.

And I didn't get you out so you

could go on a Goddamn "trim"

hunt... stop moaning.

HAMMOND

Speakin' of moans my Stomach is

startin' to growl.

CATES

We eat when I say we eat.

HAMMOND

Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till

I get something to eat. You've

been treating me like shit ever

since I came out here.  If you

don't like it, you can take me

back to the penitentiary and kiss

my hungry black ass good-bye.  And

I want some food some place nice..

Some good people, nice music...

CATES

Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a

place. Let's go eat.

HAMMOND

Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers...

They move off down the corridor.

CATES

There's your God-damn dinner. Now,

let's go.

HAMMOND

Who'd you call on the phone back

at the booking station?

CATES

Just get in the car and keep your

mouth shut.

HAMMOND

Must of been your lady friend...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

You really do have onoe, huh,

Jack... what's her problem besides

you?

CATES

She's got the same complaint as

half the Goddamn population.  She

can't get the job she's trained

for and it pisses her off...

Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

HAMMOND

No, man, tell me about her.  In

jail they got me surrounded by

guys wearin' blue suits twenty-

four hours a day.  And I ain't

built for that. Really?  With the

clothes you got on you look like

you'd love it.

CATES

Now, where we goin', convict?

HAMMOND

Mission District.  Gonna find us

an Indian.

HAMMOND

Come on, Jack.  I want to hear

about your girl.  When were you

with her last ... You get what I

mean?

CATES

I don't give out the details.

HAMMOND

Last night, two nights ago, three?

CATES

Last night.

HAMMOND

You have a good time?

CATES

Sure.  Then we had a fight this

morning.

HAMMOND

At least you took care of business

and got the important part in

before she came down on you...Tell

me a little about her.  She got

great tits?

CATES

I get the feeling it's going to be

real long night.

CATES

Well?

HAMMOND

It's a long shot, but...Billy used

to tend bar here a few years back.

I heard him talk about it.

CATES

This part of town, they'll make us

for heat the second we walk in.

Just back me up like you've got a

piece...

HAMMOND

Back you up?  Now why would I

wanna do that?

CATES

If they kick my ass, they'll sure

as hell carve yours up...

HAMMOND

But you can handle it all right,

huh? Real amazin' how far a gun

and a badge can carry some cats...

CATES

Bullshit.  Attitude and experience

get you through...

HAMMOND

I been in a lot of bars where a

white cop rousted me and some of

the brothers. All those clowns

ever had going for 'em was a gun

and a badge...

CATES

You need five years training to

handle a joint like...

HAMMOND

Hey, you wanna bet?

CATES

I got two problems.  Number one,

I'm not playin' games.  Number

two, you got nothin' to bet with.

HAMMOND

If we come outta this joint with

Ganz' phone number, or a dead

Indian, or anything else useful,

then you could turn the other way

for half an hour while I get

laid...

CATES

Why?  Anybody that talks about

women as much as you do probably

can't get it up anyway.

HAMMOND

That's never been one of my

problems.

Now, stop stallin', man, or else

admit all this professional stuff

you're talkin' about is a crock of

shit.

CATES

I'll tell you what happens if you

lose... you tell the truth for

once.

HAMMOND

What are you talkin' about?

CATES

You tell me what Ganz busted out

for, he's after a lot more than

just gettin' out of jail.  And

whatever it is, you're part of it.

HAMMOND

I don't know what you're talking

about. I just wanna see Ganz

nailed.

CATES

The bet's off.

HAMMOND

Okay, if I lose, I'll tell you

anything you want to know...

CATES

I'm gonna enjoy this ... here,

I'll even loan you my badge.

HAMMOND

I thought you said bullshit and

experience are all it takes.

HAMMOND

This place don't seem real popular

with the brothers.

CATES

My kind of place. I always liked

country boys.

BARTENDER

Yeah.

HAMMOND

Vodka.

BARTENDER

Maybe you better have a Black

Russian.

HAMMOND

No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

HAMMOND

You know a big Indian named Billy

Bear?  He used to work here.

BARTENDER

Never heard of him.

HAMMOND

Now how's your memory doin'?

BARTENDER

Fuck off.  I don't know what the

hell you're talkin' about.

HAMMOND

Maybe I better ask around, see

what your pals think.

BARTENDER

I don't give a shit who you ask.

HAMMOND

Up against the wall, cowboy.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Now, I said get over there by that

wall ... You hear me,

motherfucker...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Move it, rednecks.  On your feet...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Over there...move your ass. Some

of you rednecks seem a little hard

of hearing, so I'll repeat it for

everybody... I need word on the

whereabouts of an Indian that goes

by the name of Billy Bear. It's a

police matter and you all look

like you'd just love to

cooperate...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

That wasn't necessary, buddy. I

got this under control.

CATES

Some of us citizens are with you

all the way, Officer.

HAMMOND

You're in trouble, big trouble, so

you better start talking. Where'd

a boy like you make a score like

this?

PUNK

It's mine, what the hell...

HAMMOND

You must a rolled somebody.  They

don't let punks like you take jobs

that pay this much ... you sure

you don't know a dangerous Indian,

because unless you start talkin'

I may just have to start looking

down your pants with a

flashlight...

PUNK

What kind of cop are you, anyway?

HAMMOND

I am your most terrible nightmare

... a bad nigger with a badge that

entitles him to kick your ass...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

One of them is under-age.  Another

attacked a police officer. And you

know I ain't found what I came

lookin' here for yet...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

The tall one had a weapon ... you

want me to keep on makin' a list,

or you got the picture yet?

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Looks like you're on your way to

bein' outta business, redneck...

Now, let's see what can we fuck

with next?

BARTENDER

Okay, okay.  The Indian hangs out

with a girl down the block. Right

where Chinatown starts.  She lives

on top of the hardware store.

HAMMOND

I don't give a damn about his

girl...

BARTENDER

Look, give me a break, you're

going to have to settle for her

place.  It's the only thing I know.

BARTENDER

(continuing)

I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all

I know.

HAMMOND

Try obeyin' the law once in

awhile, and I won't have to hassle

you...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

But remember this, cowboy, there's

a new sheriff in town.

CATES

I think you got something for me.

CATES

(continuing)

The gun you took off that redneck

in there.

HAMMOND

You made that move, huh?

CATES

While you're at it, You can give

me the switchblade, too.

CATES

(continuing)

Credit cards?

HAMMOND

You already got a gun and you owe

me a piece of ass.  I'll settle

for the gun you just took.

CATES

You did a real good job... Guess

you deserve a reward.

HAMMOND

Motherfucker.

CATES

I sure am. Now let's go get us an

Indian.

HAMMOND

What the shit is that?

CATES

There.

HAMMOND

Must be billy's girl.

CATES

Come on.

CATES

Police! Nobody move!

CATES

(continuing)

Stay where you are!

SALLY

You better drop it or he's gonna

get another one.

HAMMOND

Hey, talk to here jack.  I don't

feel like gettin' number two along

side of the head.

CATES

I said police.  Now drop the

goddamn gun.

CASEY

Don't give me that police shit.

You drop it.

CATES

Okay, look, don't shoot.  I'm just

reachin' for my badge.

CASEY

I don't like this bullshit. I've

seen fake badges before.

HAMMOND

I'll tell you something lady, this

guy is a real nervous cop - He's

just liable to pull the trigger.

CATES

Naw, I'm the calm type.  I know

you don't want me to shoot you,

and I know that you don't want to

shoot me.

CATES

(continuing)

Shooting a cop puts you away for

a long time.

CASEY

You assholes better be real.

SALLY

Just wait a Goddamn second here,

let's see your badge...

HAMMOND

Don't have one.

SALLY

I knew it.  Call the cops.

CATES

Tell them it's Cates, Detective

31st District.  Then put your

clothes on. If you don't answer

some questions I'm taking both

your asses in.

CATES

(continuing)

Now, let's cut out the crap, which

one of you sees Billy Bear?

SALLY

None of your business, cop.  The

son of a bitch isn't here, and he

isn't coming back.

CATES

You can do better than that.

CATES

(continuing)

How about it?

CASEY

I used to go with him...I don't

know where the hell he is.  I

haven't seen him for two weeks.

And I don't think I will.  He owes

me money...

SALLY

He's a Goddamn lowlife, the way he

treated her.

CATES

Sounds like a real stormy romance.

CASEY

I don't much care what it sounds

like to you, Cop. All I know is

that I went a few laps around the

track with him and I ended up with

nothin' but the short end of the

stick.

CATES

Let's go.

HAMMOND

Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies

would like to go a few laps with

us.  How about it? I been nearly

three years in prison and...

SALLY

Fuck off.

CATES

Come on...

CASEY

If you find that bastard, Billy,

tell him to stay out of my life.

I don't need any more of his macho

bullshit.

CATES

This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of

my gun and goes all over the

streets killing people with it.

So, instead of me being where I

oughta be, which is in bed giving

my girl the high, hard one, I'm

out here doing this shit, roaming

around with some overdressed,

charcoal-colored loser like you.

HAMMOND

You wanna leave, man?  Let me take

care of Ganz all by myself.

CATES

You?  Don't make me laugh.  You

can't take care of shit.  You've

been dicking me around since we

started on this turd-hunt.  All

you're good for is games... So

far, what I got outta you is

nothin'...

HAMMOND

I'm impressed with you too, Jack

you did a real good job of busting

up a couple of dykes bedded down

for the night.

CATES

Luther knew more than he told me

and so do you...Now you better

tell we what the fuck this is all

about.  I gave you 48 hours to

come up with something and the

clock's runnin' ...

HAMMOND

Maybe I don't like the way you ask.

CATES

Who gives a Goddamn what you

think? You're just a crook that's

got a weekendpass ... You're not

even a name anymore. Just a spear-

chucker with a Goddamn number

stenciled on the back of his

prison fatigues...

CATES

Okay, Reggie, I'm done playing

around. I want to know what's

going on and I'm going to beat the

living shit out of you until you

tell me.

HAMMOND

You beat the shit out of me?

Don't make me laugh, sucker.  You

don't know how I'd dance on your

face?  I'll hit you so hard, so

many times, you'll wish you'd

never been hatched.  I'll turn

your face into cottage cheese.

I'll make your girl think you been

takin' ugly pills.  She won't even

know who you are, sucker.

CATES

I guess the first thing I ought,

to explain to you, nigger, is I

fight dirty.

HAMMOND

So do I.

CATES

Now, you bastard, you going to

tell me what's going on...

CATES

(continuing)

... Do I have to kick the shit out

of you some more.

FIRST COP

All right, you two.  Don't move.

CATES

NO, no...it's okay...I'm police.

SECOND COP

Yeah, sure.  Get your hands above

your head.

CATES

My gun and badge are over there.

And I'm too fucking tired to raise

my hands...

FIRST COP

What the hell's going on here?

SECOND COP

I've got a burglary call.  Two

women say a couple of hoods broke

into their place posing as cops.

CATES

I was following a lead.  We

rousted them... Go up and sweet

talk 'em.  You can straighten it

out.

FIRST COP

Why don't you do it?  We got

better things to do than

straighten out your messes.

CATES

So do I. I'll file a report

tomorrow.

FIRST COP

I gotta file a..Report tonight

asshole...

CATES

Goes with the territory.

HAMMOND

Too bad we got interrupted when we

did.  I was getting ready to

finish you off.

CATES

Yeah, right.  You want to try

again?

HAMMOND

Naw, you'd just call your pals

back to bail you out one more time.

CATES

They saved your ass, convict.

HAMMOND

One thing's for sure, Jack.

That's how you'll tell the story.

CATES

I'll even put it in my report that

way.

HAMMOND

Motherfucker.

CATES

Wait a minute.

CATES

(continuing)

You come clean or we're going to

go again.  Right here, right now.

HAMMOND

I been waiting a long time for

some money.

CATES

How much?

HAMMOND

Half a million.

CATES

Jesus.

HAMMOND

How's that for a number to give

you heart failure? Guess you might

start to get the picture after

all. Mlaybe you're on the wrong

side of the old law and order

business..

CATES

Just tell me about the money.

HAMMOND

Me and my bunch hit a dealer in

the middle of a sale. It's the

kind of money nobody ever reports

stolen. I was sittin' pretty,

livin' in the high cotton, then

somebody fingered me for another

job. ... Some psycho who's out

there capping people with some

cop's gun.

CATES

He's after your money.

HAMMOND

You catch on real fast...Okay,

Jack, let's talk deal. How much of

my money you gonna let me keep?

HAMMOND

(continuing)

We split 50-50?

CATES

Not likely, convict.

HAMMOND

You gonna let me keep any of it?

CATES

Depends on how things work out. I

believe in the merit system. So

far you haven't built up any

points.

HAMMOND

Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be

real good, Jack.

CATES

Where's the money?

HAMMOND

In the trunk of a car.  A lot

better than under a mattress,

right?

CATES

Right, partner.

HAMMOND

Get this. We ain't partners. We

ain't brothers. We ain't friends.

If Ganz gets away with my money,

you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

CATES

Yeah.  Right.

CATES

(continuing)

Where's the goddamn car?

HAMMOND

You're a real case, you know that,

Jack?

HAMMOND

(continuing)

This'll show you how smart I am.

I got it parked.

CATES

...For three years?  Let's hope it

wasn't a tow-away zone.

HAMMOND

You just drove by it.

CATES

Okay, now what?

HAMMOND

Since you're wired on benniest you

get to stay up and stare at the

building. I'm  tired, so I'm going

to sleep. They take Sunday off.

Place opens at seven o'clock

Monday morning. Wake me up at a

quarter till...

CATES

You son of a bitch. You knew where

the money was all along and all we

had to do was come here and wait.

I almost got my ass blown off

twice tonight for nothing.

HAMMOND

I wasn't sure the money was still

there until we saw Luther. You

almost got your ass shot off for

nothing once, not twice, Jack.

CATES

Shit.

CATES

I don't want you sleeping on the

job.

HAMMOND

The place opens in five minutes.

Ganz ought to be here soon...

CATES

You took a big chance, leaving

this here all this time.

HAMMOND

Not really.  I figured Ganz was

put down for a long time.  And I

knew Luther would never job me on

his own.  He's too chickenshit.

CATES

Guess what?  Luther just got in

line.

HAMMOND

What?

CATES

Musta got some primo bondsman.

HAMMOND

Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace

The guy pulls a gun on a cop and

he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you

some of the courts these days are

just a fucking revolving door.

ATTENDANT

Yeah?

LUTHER

I want to pick up my car.

ATTENDANT

Name?

LUTHER

Hammond.

ATTENDANT

This is three years old.

LUTHER

Yeah, I've been busy.

ATTENDANT

We don't wash 'em, ya know.

LUTHER

How about chargin' the battery?

ATTENDANT

That we do. And we put air in the

tires. I'll even sell you some gas

if you need it.

LUTHER

Great, just great.

HAMMOND

Jesus Christ, look at all the dust

on my car...why in the hell don't

he take it to a car wash?

CATES

Didn't know you darker people went

in for foreign jobs.

HAMMOND

I had no choice. Some white

asshole bought the last piece of

shit skyblue Cadillac.

CATES

You'd think the guy'd be smart

enough to know he was being tailed.

HAMMOND

Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's

in another world.

CATES

If I was his size and had Ganz on

my ass, I'd  just leave town.

HAMMOND

I'm tellin' you the man's in

love... he wants to be a hero for

his girl.

CATES

Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make

you stupid?

CATES

I suppose you'd never be like

Luther and let a woman get to

you...

HAMMOND

I let women get to me.  The quest

for pussy is the meaning of life

... I got my own personal

philosophy about 'em.  Keep women

separate from guns, money and

business ... women are for

spending money.  They got nothing

to do with helping you make it.

CATES

That ain't philosophy.  That's

common sense.

HAMMOND

Say, do you always work people

over like you did Luther?

CATES

If they don't tell me what I need

to know...

HAMMOND

Doesn't it get... Tiring?

CATES

I'm not in this 'cause it's fun.

I'm not into hitting guys 'cause

it makes me feel good either... I

do it 'cause it works-...

HAMMOND

You got a very depressing view of

life, man... you gotta smile once

in awhile...

CATES

Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give

him a piece of your money...

HAMMOND

If he's hoping that then he's

dumber than I think he is, which

would be amazin', cause I already

think he's real dumb.

HAMMOND

A long time agb Luther must of got

the shit beat out of him so bad it

just rattled his brain ... that

would account for him making so

many wrong moves in a row...

CATES

Yeah, it doesn't look like he's

gonna make it as a dangerous tough

guy...

HAMMOND

You know, I'd be embarrassed if I

let my wheels go the way you've

done with this job.

CATES

What you don't understand is, I

don't give a damn about how this

thing looks.

HAMMOND

No class...

CATES

Class isn't somethin' you buy,

punk. Look at you, five hundred

dollar suit and you're still a

lowlife.

HAMMOND

We're getting too close ... Cates,

what's the matter, you been takin'

dumb pills?

CATES

Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb...

But since you're the one that

landed in jail what's that make

you?

CATES

That Goddamn suit is yours?

HAMMOND

That was in style a couple years

back, man.

CATES

Right. if you ever switch from

armed robbery to pimping, then

you're all set.

HAMMOND

That's the money, Jack.

PATROLMAN

Hey--you!

PATROLMAN

(continuing)

Put it down.

HAMMOND

Shoot the sons of bitches.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

You don't want to chance it, then

give me the gun...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Bullshit. Then i'm staying with

the money.

CATES

You stay with me...

HAMMOND

No way...

SECURITY OFFICER

Freeze!

CATES

No! No!  There they are!

SECURITY OFFICER

Just put it down real slow.

CATES

I'm a policeman, you asshole!

SECURITY OFFICER

Don't even try... now drop it

or - you're all done.

CATES

Shit.

HADEN

Cates.

HADEN

(continuing)

What the bell happened?

CATES

I lost them, that's what happened.

HADEN

How did they get away?

CATES

They ran.  As fast as they could.

Caught a train.

HADEN

Which one pulled the trigger?

CATES

The Indian.  I was about 30 yards

away.

HADEN

You couldn't get to him?

HADEN

(continuing)

What a screw-up.

CATES

Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked

up. I messed up.  Anybody could

have done better, especially you.

I bet you're real good at hitting

targets through crowds.

HADEN

Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why

didn't you call in for backup

instead of makin' a grandstand

play?

CATES

I didn't have the time.

HADEN

Too bad, it would've covered your

ass.  Now you're in the shit and

so's the department. In case you

haven't noticed, this wasn't our

finest hour... I told you everyone

was watchin' on this one. Maybe

you better start thinkin' about

writin' tickets off a three wheel

bike.

HAMMOND

How you doing, man?

SOSNA

Not bad, not bad.

SOSNA

(continuing)

You want to go outside?

HAMMOND

Naw, right here's okay.

SOSNA

You sure?

HAMMOND

I'm sure.  Everybody here's

looking at everybody else's ass.

SOSNA

I got some real nice merchandise.

All of it's clean.

HAMMOND

I like this one...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

How about some ammo?

SOSNA

It's loaded... I got some shells

in here.

HAMMOND

How much?

SOSNA

This is clean shit.  No serial

numbers and never been used...

HAMMOND

Don't mess with me. How much?

SOSNA

Five bills.

HAMMOND

Five.  On credit.

SOSNA

This ain't a credit business.

HAMMOND

Yeah, I know that, but this is me

and we're old friends. I haven't

got the money so what are you

gonna do about it?

SOSNA

Give it back.

HAMMOND

Try and take it.

SOSNA

Fuck you.  You got no right for

this kind of play.

HAMMOND

I'll got your money to you. No

sweat.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

Vodka. With a twist. And I want to

run a tab.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

My name's Reggie Hammond.

RITA

So what?

HAMMOND

Hi there. I'm Reggie Hammond.

ANGELA

I'm with somebody.

HAMMOND

This ain't my night.

KEHOE

You look awful.

CATES

So do you...been a long day.

KEHOE

Long night, too, from what I heard

... Word's going around that in

addition to losing Ganz for the

second time, and in addition to

Haden busting you back to

Patrolman, some jig beat the crap

out of you.

CATES

Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

KEHOE

Doesn't look like it.

CATES

Nothing came in for me yet?  No

calls?

KEHOE

Nothing.

KEHOE

(continuing)

Kehoe... Okay, hang on.

KEHOE

(continuing)

It's for you... Ordinance.

CATES

Hello... Yeah, okay.  I'll be in

tomorrow. That's right, you can

depend on it.  Okay?

CATES

(continuing)

Bullshit red tape.

KEHOE

I'm heading out. How about you?

CATES

I got to wait for a call.

KEHOE

Okay.  See you in the morning...

you know, you ought to get some

rest...

PLAINCLOTHESMAN

Yeah, he's here.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN

(continuing)

Cates... line twelve.

CATES

You motherfucker, where are you?

ELAINE

I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?

CATES

Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was

expecting somebody else... police

business.

ELAINE

No wonder you're so popular.

CATES

No, it's I'm just surprised you

called.

ELAINE

So am I.

ELAINE                        CATES

Jack, this afternoon...       Hey, look, when...

ELAINE

You first.

CATES

Look, I'm sorry about ... the way

things have been lately.  I know

I haven't been acting real great...

KEHOE

Hey, Cates...

KEHOE

(continuing)

I almost forgot.  That pal of

yours from the Vice Squad wants

you to call him.

CATES

What?

ELAINE

Jack, are you still there?

KEHOE

Yeah.  He said he rousted a bar

with you last night.

CATES

Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't

you tell me before?

KEHOE

I'm not paid to take your personal

calls.  He was in some bar. .. off

duty.

CATES

The number ... what's the Goddamn

number?

ELAINE

Jack?  What was that?

KEHOE

Find it yourself.  It's on my desk.

CATES

Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

ELAINE

Jack, wait...

CATES

Just a second, that's all!

CATES

(continuing)

Hammond... you son of a bitch,

where are you?

HAMMOND

Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took

you so long to call, man? I been

waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in

the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's...

'Course you don't hang out here;

it's for the brothers.

CATES

I'll be there in a minute. You

don't move your ass, right?

CATES

(continuing)

Oh, shit.

HAMMOND

My name's Reggie Hammond.

CANDY

I'm candy...

HAMMOND

Excuse me, baby, but if i don't

get some action tonight, I'm gonna

bust.  You interested?

CANDY

Hey, what kind of talk is that?

HAMMOND

Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

CANDY

No, I go to a school to learn how

to do hair. It's a government

program. But really I want to be

a model - and I am definitely not

sellin'.

HAMMOND

(humorously)

Goodbye.

CANDY

Hey, don't you think a hair

stylists got any interest in

gettin' it on?

HAMMOND

Here you go sweetheart, throw it

my way.

CANDY

You're in a hurry.

HAMMOND

Yeah, i been waiting three years.

CANDY

You just quit bein' a priest or

somethin'?

HAMMOND

No, baby, nothin' like that.

Look, there's a place across the

street. We can go right over

there...

CANDY

What's the matter with my place?

HAMMOND

No, it's gotta be here and now.

Believe me. Only I don't have the

damn money for a room...

CANDY

Yeah, well, even us non-pros

expect the guy to pay for the

room...

CATES

Where's luther?

HAMMOND

Be polite. Say hello.  This is

Candy.

CATES

Hello. And goodbye.

CANDY

Well, maybe I'll see you later ...

HAMMOND

Here's hoping, baby...

CATES

What about Luther?

HAMMOND

What about Ganz?

CATES

We missed.

HAMMOND

You missed ... Luther took a taxi

to the hotel across the street.

Made a phone call.

CATES

Maybe we should pay Luther a

visit.

HAMMOND

Let him get some sleep.  He's

going to need it.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

They must have set up a meeting

for the morning; Luther left an 8

am wake-up and put up the "Don't

Disturb" sign.  He's trading his

girl for the money.  All we have

to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

CATES

So you took the rest of the night

off...

HAMMOND

We don't have too many

cheerleaders in prison. I though

I might indulge myself in a little

trim.

CATES

Tell me something.  Why didn't you

just take the money off Luther and

split?

HAMMOND

Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as

you do and I got some other news

for you...

CATES

I don't know why, but I'm going to

let you keep it. Maybe because you

told me you had it, or maybe just

because I'm too tired to argue...

HAMMOND

You sure that's the reason?

CATES

Thanks for callin' in... and I

guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I

called you Watermellon nigger...

those kinds of things. I was just

leanin' on ya, doin' my job.

HAMMOND

Bein' good at your job don't

explain everything, Jack ...

CATES

Yeah. Guess not.

HAMMOND

As long as you're feeling like Abe

Lincoln, how about payin' me on

our bet?  We got time and all this

pussy around here's drivin' me

crazy. See that one over there,

the one I was with...

CATES

Yeah, I see her.

HAMMOND

I can just take her right across

the street to Luther's hotel.  All

I need is some money for the room.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

CANDY

Hello, again.

HAMMOND

I just struck it rich... I think

we can do a little business.  As

a matter of fact, I think we can

have a party.

CATES

Hurry back.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

It's for you.

ELAINE

Hello.

CATES

Hi, it's me...

ELAINE

Fuck you.

CANDY

So... what did you have in mind?

HAMMOND

Oh no, not now!

CATES

That was quick.

HAMMOND

When you been in prison three

years, it don't take long. Let's

go.

CATES

Why?

HAMMOND

Luther's on the move...

HAMMOND

(continuing)

I'll be back. Trust me.

GANZ

Open your coat. Both sides.

LUTHER

Let her go.

GANZ

First, the money.

GANZ

(continuing)

Just show me.

LUTHER

Rosalie, you okay?

GANZ

What are you talkin' about? I said

I wouldn't hurt her.

GANZ

(continuing)

I never break my word.

HAMMOND

Notice something funny about that

bus?

CATES

Yeah. It missed the last four

stops.

BILLY

Ganz!

CATES

Goddamn! Goddamn!  Goddamn!

HADEN

A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick

cop, you lost a stolen bus... We

got five deaths related to Ganz,

all of 'em law enforcement

related, and you blow it for a

lousy nigger convict...

HADEN

(continuing)

That's rights I called him a

nigger.  You bet I did ... I saw

the report on that little piece of

shit.  If he spent one legal day

in his whole life, it'd be a

record...This is it for you...

suspension, review board... you've

had it.  When it gets 'round you

protect a con rather than nail a

cop killer...

CATES

He's got more brains and more guts

in one corner of his asshole than

any cop I've worked with.

HADEN

Just cause you say it with

conviction don't mean shit to

me... How you gonna take to a pink

slip, huh?.

HADEN

(continuing)

Where the Christ do you think

you're going?

CATES

I'm taking my prisoner back to

jail.

HAMMOND

Goin' a little hard on him, aren't

you?

HADEN

Go fuck yourself convict.

HAMMOND

You know for a man, you have very

pretty brown eyes.

HAMMOND

Hey, how'd my car get here?

CATES

I had it impounded.  Come on,

we'll use it for haulin' you back

to the slam.

HAMMOND

Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz

got away. Got all my money. It

just don't seem right.

CATES

I don't know about you, but I

could use a drink... I'll buy you

one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

HAMMOND

Sorry we didn't do better, Jack.

I feel like I let you down.

CATES

Naw, you didn't let me down.  It

was a long shot all the way.  We

gave 'em a good run at it.

HAMMOND

Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

HAMMOND

It's late, they're closing...

CATES

Don't worry about it.

ELAINE

Hey, I don't believe it.

CATES

Hiya, kid.

ELAINE

I ought to have you and your

friend thrown out...

CATES

Don't.  We've had a hard night.

ELAINE

I can see that.  Pardon me for

saying so, but you look like

shit.  What happened?

CATES

We and my pal here have been

taking it on the chin for the last

few hours...

ELAINE

Who the hell are you?

HAMMOND

Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond.

I heard a lot about you. And any

friend of Jack's is a friend of

mine.

ELAINE

I'm not so sure I can say the same

thing...You don't look like a cop.

HAMMOND

Well, I been workin' the other

side of the street for the last

few years.  And you don't exactly

look like a shrink, wearin' that

dress...

ELAINE

Shrink major, not a shrink.

STRAGGLER

Hey, lady, a drink here.

ELAINE

We're closed.

STRAGGLER

Hey, what the hell?

ELAINE

Drink your drink, pay up and get

out.

STRAGGLER

You can't do this.  It's against...

ELAINE

Hey, just fuck off.  My friends

have guns.

ELAINE

(continuing)

You real down?

CATES

I've been better...Dead end.  No

Ganz, no Indian.

CATES

(continuing)

I gotta call the station.

CATES

(continuing)

Don't run off anywhere, okay?

I've already got enough to worry

about.

HAMMOND

Hard man to live with.

ELAINE

How would you know?

HAMMOND

Hey, two days with him is enough.

ELAINE

That's no bull.

CATES

Is there any report ... No ...

Just tell me... nothing..Yeah I

figured... Okay, sure.

CATES

Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No

sign of the Indian.  Airport's

clean.  Train station. Bus

station.  Docks... Shit...

ELAINE

Ganz is going to be hard to track.

Just a pure schizo ... wires all

crossed... totally without any

pattern... kill anybody... The

Indian... himself... anybody...

CATES

How do you know?

ELAINE

Jack, it's all over the papers.

He's an obvious type.  But this

Indian...

HAMMOND

He was the only one of my bunch

that was my friend... He was

loyal, went all the way for you...

ELAINE

In all due respect, he sounds kind

of pathetic to me.  The kind of

guy that runs home to his momma or

some girlfriend.  Have you two ace

detectives checked that out?

CATES

Yeah, well the only woman of the

Indian's we ran into was shacked

up with her dyke girlfriend.  I

guess she went with him before she

came outta the Closet ... They

both looked mad enough to kill

him...

HAMMOND

Yeah, too bad.  They were real

nice lookin' too...In bed

together, hardly any clothes one

watching TV...

ELAINE

What makes you think they were

lesbians, or as you so quaintly

put it, dykes?

CATES

Come on, they were a little old

for a slumber party.

ELAINE

It might pay to reexamine a few of

your more primitive notions.  I

was in bed with a girlfriend

watching TV last week, Jack, and

one thing we know about me is I

happen not to be a lesbian ...

Now, if this Indian's girlfriend

got upset when you came looking

for him, it could just be she's

still vulnerable to him.

CATES

So what?

ELAINE

When a guy hurts you, then comes

back bleeding on his hands and

knees, who knows, he might just be

irrestible.

CATES

Hey, Come on, shrink time's over.

They wouldn't go see some old

girlfriend.

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, well look where you came

when you were down and out.

HAMMOND

She's got a point there, Jack.

CATES

It's the only thing we got.

CATES

(continuing)

Whaddya think?

ELAINE

What do I know?  I'm just a

bartender.

CATES

Let's go, Reggie.

HAMMOND

Do I get to kiss her too?

CATES

If she's right, and if you don't

screw up.

HAMMOND

What if your girl's theory turns

out to be bullshit?  I mean, they

could be in Rio de Janeiro.

CATES

I've got to play it rough with

them. If they know anything, I'm

gonna know it.

HAMMOND

Hey, there she is...

CATES

Whatever play I maker just back me

up.

HAMMOND

If we run into Billy first, let me

try and talk him in.

CATES

Sure, I'll give you a shot at it,

but Ganz is mine.  You know, that

big Indian plays it for keeps...

HAMMOND

Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't

no sweetheart... I wouldn't like

it if this partnership ended

before it gets started.

CATES

Partnership?

HAMMOND

Well, you got to admit we come a

long way.

CATES

Let's just do it.

CATES

I hear you've got visitors.

CASEY

Would you guys...

CATES

No time for any of that crap any

more, lady... I'll rip your lungs

out if you don't answer fast.

HAMMOND

He means it...

CASEY

Don't kill him.  Please, just

don't kill him.

CATES

You and the other one, you're

still Billy's girls. You always

were his girls...

CASEY

Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love

with him, who wouldn't be...

CATES

You're gonna help us take him.

CASEY

No chance.

CATES

He can live or die ... You let us

in and he's got a chance to make

it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.

HAMMOND

If you help use he's got a chance,

lady.

CASEY

Billy's in the first room off the

hall ... With rosalie ... He's

makin' her happy tonight.  You

don't understand about the way it

is with him, do ya?

CATES

Where's ganz?

CASEY

In the back.  Down the other

corridor.

CATES

Looks like you're gonna get your

chance.

HAMMOND

Give it up, Billy.  You got no

shot at it.

ROSALIE

Don't let him hurt met Billy.

You're not gonna let 'em hurt me,

are ya?

BILLY

He won't hurt you.  He ain't gonna

do nothin' to you, he's just after

me.

HAMMOND

I'm tellin' ya, Billy, give it up.

BILLY

I never was much for bein'

rehabilitated.

GANZ

Drop it... you come up against me,

you're gonna lose...

GANZ

(continuing)

Hey, cop, come on...l got

something for ya... come on...

GANZ

After I get outta this, cop...I'm

gonna live forever...

CATES

I don't think you're gonna make it.

GANZ

Whaddya mean...I got your gun ...

I got his money... I got

everything...

HAMMOND

Give up.  He's crazy.  He'll kill

us both.

GANZ

He won't try it. He's a fucking

chickenshit cop. They're all

fucking wimps, right, Cates?

GANZ

(continuing)

Okay, cop ... give me your gun and

I'll let him live. Come on, Cates,

you're real good at giving up your

gun.

CATES

Sure...

HAMMOND

Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd

really do it. You are crazy.

GANZ

I got hit.  I can't believe it. I

got shot.

CATES

You're done.  End of story.

GANZ

I ain't gonna beg for my life. It

ain't cool.

HAMMOND

Yours?

CATES

Mine...

CATES

(continuing)

You okay?

HAMMOND

Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a

second.

CATES

You did pick a real strange time

to go and be brave all on your

own...

HAMMOND

Just tryin' to get the money,

Jack.  Just tryin' to build up a

few points on that merit system.

ELAINE

How'd they take it back at

headquarters?

CATES

Usual bullshit.  You make one

smart move and everybody wants to

be your friend... You know

somethin', shootin' guys sucks.

Especially compared to this.

ELAINE

I've been waiting a long time to

hear you say that.

CATES

Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the

time is a real drag, but it works.

CATES

(continuing)

Three more hours...

ELAINE

Where is he?

CATES

Promised I'd turn my back while

he... ah, never mind...

ELAINE

Tell me.

CATES

He's takin' care of the same

business I'll be takin' care of -

soon as I dry off.

ELAINE

You're impossible...

CATES

That's what I always say.

HAMMOND

Here you go, baby.

CANDY

Hey, don't do that.  I said I

wasn't a pro, remember?

HAMMOND

Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice.

Buy yourself something pretty.

I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got

this cop waitin' for me...

HAMMOND

I'll be back in six months...

Maybe I'll make an honest woman of

you.

HAMMOND

(continuing)

I'll buy ya the best dinner in San

Francisco...how'd that be? Then

we'll go dancin', okay?

CANDY

Now you're talkin'. See ya...

CATES

Okay, reggie, start bustin' my

chops... Tell me how great you

were with that chick.

HAMMOND

Hey, Jack, real men don't have to

go in for that macho bullshit ...

but I was fantastic.

As a riatter of fact, I was so

good, I may have my cock done in

bronze.

CATES

I guess this is what you want to

talk about...All the pretty money

that's inside here.

HAMMOND

Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been

waitin' three years for that.  I

don't think it's fair, man. What

about the merit system.? You were

gonnna give me a few thousand.

CATES

There's nothin' to talk about.

CATES

(continuing)

It's your money.  It'll be here in

six months when you get out.

HAMMOND

And you're tellin' me you don't

want any of this cash?

CATES

That's right. Not my style,

Reggie..

HAMMOND

You are an awesomely weird cop.

Sure wish there were more like you

runnin' around out here.

CATES

No, you don't. If I ever get word

of you steppin' over the line

again, I'm gonna ventilate that

suit of yours.

HAMMOND

Spare met Jack. I'm into legit

investments from here on in.

CATES

Thanks.

HAMMOND

No trouble, Jack. But, listen,

suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd

you get the idea that you could

catch me?

END.
