OVER BLACK:

KALE (V.O.)

(tense)

Do you think he sees us?

JEFF (V.O.)

No, he can't see us. But he feels

us watching.

FADE IN:

DEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME.

And there... a few feet beneath the surface... something

SHIMMERS in the sunlight. As ripples dissipate, we make out

the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for

its prey on the end of a 10-pound line.

We hold on this for another silent beat... then -- a huge

BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame, circling the bait!

ON KALE BRECHT (17) AND HIS DAD, JEFF BRECHT (45)

Both startle at the sight. Kale, a clean-cut all-American

kid, reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel.

KALE

Whoa, did you see that thing?

Kale anxiously winds the spool --

JEFF

Settle down, slow it down...

Jeff lightly puts his hand on Kale's, slowing the cranking

to a slight, steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing

near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER. We are...

1   EXT. BISHOP LAKE - DAY                                           1

The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as

we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t-

shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a

Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its

fins. Beneath it, the slogan: "Weapons of Bass Destruction."

The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single

word across the bottom: BASSCAR.

As Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away:

JEFF

You don't want to scare him off.

You've got his attention, now just

play with him. Tease him a little.

Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale

inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then --

The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous

SLOSH OF HIS TAIL!

KALE

Holy shit!

JEFF

It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!

Kale cranks fast and furious.    But this is one fish that's

going down fighting.

KALE

I need reinforcements!

Jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale.

JEFF

Heave, laddie!

They PULL.    The rod curls under the weight.

JEFF (CONT'D)

(pirate accent)

Give it all ya got, mate, or you're

gonna lose him!

KALE

(laughing; pulling;

struggling)

Dad, your pirate -- impersonation --

sucks!!

JEFF

How would ya know, have ya ever met

one? I doubt it --

The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few

feet from the boat!

KALE

He's freakin' pulling us in!

JEFF

(laughing)

Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a

fight -- to a fish!

The BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and

Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then --

(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso

1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                     1

All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing.

Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance

to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff

takes a seat in the captain's chair.

JEFF (CONT'D)

Throw me a --

Kale is already in the cooler. He throws Jeff a Coke.        Both

sit in silence for a beat. Then --

JEFF (CONT'D)

Hey, at least the weather's great...

we're spending quality time together.

KALE

(grabbing pole)

That fish is going down.

JEFF

(not missing a beat)

Let's nab the bastard.

They both cast their lines --

2   EXT. HIGHWAY 395 - NORTHERN SIERRA MOUNTAINS - EVENING                2

An amber glow sets the mountainside ablaze as Jeff's SUV

winds through the serpentine pass.

3   INT. SUV - EVENING - CONTINUOUS - MOVING                              3

Jeff drives.    Kale's on his cell:

KALE (cont'd)

(into phone as needed)

Hey mom, it's us. Listen, fire up

the grill 'cause the Bassmasters are

headed home!

Jeff slaps Kale five as he veers the SUV into the left lane,

passing a slow-moving PATHFINDER...

INTERCUT WITH:

4   INT. KALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS                        4

Kale's attractive mom, JULIE, 40, on cordless, preps dinner.

JULIE

You're kidding. So I can actually

put the burgers away this time?

KALE

Yes, be gone with the red meat!

(CONTINUED)      D.J. Caruso

4   CONTINUED:                                                          4

Julie smiles.    Jeff grabs the phone from Kale.

JEFF

(into phone as needed)

We're having fish for a week.

Kale smiles as a LINCOLN NAVIGATOR PICK-UP zooms past in the

right lane, swerves back in the left lane in front of them.

JEFF (CONT'D)

(over the above)

I'd say an hour. Love you, too.

Jeff flips the phone shut, tosses it to Kale. They exchange

smiles. A silent moment passes. They both turn to face the

road as --

THE NAVIGATOR PICK-UP

suddenly SWERVES back into the right lane, revealing a

STALLED MINI-VAN

directly in front of them!

KALE

DAD --

Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he

SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But

it's not in time. The

SUV

clips the mini-van's right rear bumper, SMASHING it into the

left lane concrete barricade. The SUV spins into the right

lane where that

SLOW-MOVING PATHFINDER

suddenly BROADSIDES IT with such FORCE that it FLIPS the SUV

up and over. It TUMBLES off the highway, barreling into...

5   EXT. VACANT CLIFFSIDE PULLOFF/VIEWING AREA - EVENING - CONT         5

A couple of final, METAL-CRUNCHING FLIPS send the SUV's

undercarriage CRASHING to a violent stop on top of a rickety

wood beam-mounted GUARDRAIL.

A silent beat.    Then -- steam billows from the hood...

6   INSIDE THE SUV                                                      6

Airbags deflate. Dust settles. Blood streams from Jeff's

hairline. His eyes flutter open.

(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso

5.

6   CONTINUED:                                                              6

He looks up to Kale, strapped in the passenger seat,

unconscious. A small gash on his forehead. We only see

blue sky through Kale's shattered passenger window.

JEFF

Kale?   -- Kale, are you okay?

Kale opens his eyes.       Jeff reaches up, touches Kale's face.

KALE

I think so.

Kale looks down at his dad -- his eyes widen in horror, not

only at the sight of Jeff, but of the ravine beneath them --

For this brief moment, we may have thought the SUV was stable.

But we CRANE BACK UP AND OUT KALE'S PASSENGER WINDOW to REVEAL

A MUCH GRIMMER REALITY: the SUV is PERCHED LENGTHWISE ON TOP

OF THE GUARDRAIL AT A 45-DEGREE DOWNWARD ANGLE.

The SUV's right front and rear tires precariously grip the

rail, keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the RAVINE below.

7   BACK INSIDE THE SUV                                                     7

KALE

Oh my God, dad --

-- Jeff's leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard.

JEFF

I'm fine. But you're gonna have to

climb out, Kale. Can you do that?

Kale's hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for

the seatbelt buckle. But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN

PLACE, preventing Kale from turning. He tugs it furiously.

KALE

I can't -- It won't give --

JEFF

That's okay, I've got it -- grab the

door, I don't need your ass falling

on my face --

Kale reaches up, grips the outside of the door as

JEFF'S HAND

shakily reaches to Kale's seatbelt buckle and presses. Kale's

belt SNAPS LOOSE. Kale's body DROPS, but he hangs on to the

window -- just as a

GUARDRAIL BEAM SNAPS LOOSE FROM ITS FOUNDATION!

(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso

7   CONTINUED:                                                               7

The SUV ROCKS VIOLENTLY as the guardrail starts to bend and

peel away from the cliffside under the SUV's weight.

8   INSIDE THE SUV - JEFF                                                    8

reaches up, grabs Kale's legs and pushes, helping Kale climb

out the window.

9   OUTSIDE THE SUV - KALE                                                   9

slowly slides down the outside of the door, then turns around

on his chest, reaches his hand back down to Jeff --

KALE

Dad, here --

Jeff reaches up as a

SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS

a few inches behind the SUV's rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE.

THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO!

KALE SCREAMS, hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and

SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE.

The guardrail is buckling fast. Another beam RIPS FREE of

its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the

door and right front fender allowing

HIS FEET

to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath.        Having

at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside --

KALE (CONT'D)

Dad, please, you can do it --

Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up. Kale summons his

strength, grabs Jeff's wrist, pulls him up and through the

passenger window just as the

SUV FALLS AWAY!

Jeff's weight pulls Kale down. Kale's feet SLIP off the

rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the

top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching

Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM

CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.

JEFF'S WRIST

slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but

he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows

it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.

Okay, Mr. Brecht...

You're six months shy of eighteen,

that means the assault-two charge

But losing a parent isn't easy.

PARKER (CONT'D)

He's like a modem. He gets a constant

signal from Mr. Bracelet that he

sends through your phone line to the

monitoring station downtown. So

they know where you are, where you've

been and what you're thinkin' 25/7.

JULIE

What if he accidentally goes beyond --

PARKER

(anticipating; re:

Red light flashes. Means you've got

about ten seconds to get your butt

back to green, or else --

KALE

The execution squad shows up?

PARKER

And they don't bring blindfolds.

It's also tamper proof and waterproof.

So don't try sticking your foot in a

bucket of water and hopping across

the line. It won't work, and you'll

look stupid. Now, I'll be checking

up on you a lot. Here's my card --

You're set up to pay his incarceration

fee, Ms. Brecht?

JULIE

Automatic withdrawal.

(to Kale)

Twelve bucks every day.

PARKER

(re: a booklet)

Everything else is in the manual.

(making her way out)

Oh, except this -- House arrest might

sound like a breeze, but trust me,

I've seen all kinds of folks get a

bit loopy before too long, some after

just a day or two. So make sure you

find lots of constructive things to

keep yourself busy.

Dad put those security bolts on --

My fault.

No, it wasn't. You saved my life.

Sure, absolutely. Even though I've

never stepped foot in Texas --

Me neither. Had a lot of friends

who went there. I stayed in Minnesota

till I moved here.

KALE

Huh.

GILES

So when you say you "popped" your

teacher --

KALE

Just a black eye.

GILES

Phew, just making sure I wasn't living

next to some psycho killer. Listen,

I get it though. I had plenty of

teachers I wanted to just... kill.

he sending you a "sinister message?"

Are you messing with me?

Maybe a little. Did you even notice

my hair?

So you think it's all a coincidence.

We've got the car --

to death --

it's ready? Listen, did they have

to replace the whole tire -- they

patched it? Is there any way to

tell if it was slashed or -- But a

nail usually acts like its own plug

for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's

a really slow leak, it can't flatten

a tire in twenty minutes.

So what is it, Kale?   Huh?   What

else have you seen?

What else have I seen?

ASHLEY

Yeah.   What else?

KALE

Okay -- I've seen how you always

pull your kleenex from the box in

groups of three. Not two, not four,

always three. I've seen you're the

only one in the world who eats pizza-

flavored Pringles. And you never

stuff the chips in, you savor each

one by dividing it into four precise

bites. I didn't know that was even

possible. You're also the first

girl I've ever seen who spends more

time on her roof than in her own

house. And what do you do out there?

You don't talk on the phone, you

don't paint your nails, you read

books. Now one would think with the

whole numbers thing you've got going

on that you'd put them on your shelf

alphabetically, but you don't. Your

system's much more perfect. The

ones you like go on the bottom, the

ones you love go in the middle, and

the ones you need, the ones you keep

going back to... well they go straight

to the top next to the dream

encyclopedia. You know what all

this tells me? You know how things

should be. The world according to

Ashley. And guess what? It's a

very entertaining and beautiful

thing. Even when it takes a hit.

When you end up in a place like

this... when your parents dump their

baggage on you, or just... when it

seems like those curveballs are never

gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so

you know -- I get it.

But I've also seen those designer

window shades of yours, and guess

what? They always go up the next

day -- no matter what. And even if

no one else has, I've noticed that.

I'll even consider apologizing for

is... not dropping the binoculars

and telling you this a lot sooner.

That was either the creepiest... or

the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

There's like a month-old order of

Nachos Bell Grande under the seat.

Okay, I found it.

Okay, case closed.

RONNIE

Try telling Inspector Clouseau that.

Now he thinks he needs her license

number.

ASHLEY

Why, Kale?   It's over.

KALE

"Yeah, he seemed like such a normal

guy. Sure he kept to himself, but

he was always nice to me." That's

what they all say. That's what all

the neighbors always say -- after

the fact. Only after they've caught

the guy, after he's killed thirty

people --

ASHLEY

Okay, I think we all just need to

take a breath.

KALE

(heading out)

Fine, but what about the bumper

sticker, there's still a girl missing,

just... what's in the bag?

Can anyone tell me that?

Yeah, for a small fee --

Kale, what are you doing?

KALE

Trying to get to the bottom of this.

ASHLEY

(delicately)

Kale, right now, it doesn't look

that way.

KALE

What's it look like?

ASHLEY

Like you're determined to turn Giles

KALE

Not who I think.

are seeing right now. I see a guy

who looks like he hasn't slept in

days.

(peers at dad's book

I'm seeing you sitting at your dad's

desk --

ASHLEY (CONT'D)

-- Because you lost him before

maybe... you ever really knew him.

Before the world according to Kale

took a hit from that same stuff you

were telling me about, remember?

All those curveballs? But it's like --

it's like you're still trying to

dodge them by forcing pieces together

that are never gonna fit... by getting

all wrapped up in...

Obsessing's not gonna "protect you,"

Kale. It's not gonna make the hurt

I want to.

You're right, I'll find it later.

Giles sits on Kale's bed. Eyes the book on serial killers.

He picks it up, flips through it.

GILES (CONT'D)

It's funny, I hear a lot of authors

say their first books were easy,

it's the second one that's really

hard. Wonder if your dad thought

that.

(off Kale's glare)

See with me, it's the opposite. The

very first one was...

(sickly reminiscing)

...Very difficult... she was very

beautiful... fragile... a lot of

promise... the others in Texas were

flings, low class... Patty Walsh had

potential, but so did Amy. You saw

her, right? When you were watching

me? You should feel good, Kale, you

guys saved her life. I was headed

in to kill her when your girlfriend

showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale.

Savor the moment.

(tosses the book)

You have Microsoft Word?

(off Kale's questioning

look; re: computer)

Turn it on.

Kale doesn't move.    Giles raises the bat:

GILES (CONT'D)

I can type, you know.

Kale turns to the computer, lifts his taped wrists to the

keyboard.

GILES (CONT'D)

"Dear Ashley... I killed Ronnie and

my mom because...

(re: Kale not typing)

What's wrong? Hey, you're the one

who couldn't leave me alone.

Truthfully, I'm sick of covering my

tracks. You think I like spending

my spare time looking over my shoulder

for people like you? Word of advice,

if you ever need to hurt someone,

think everything through. Because

you do get a taste for it, don't

you?

GILES (CONT'D)

But damned if people aren't just

waiting to stand in your way... cops,

reporters, determined relatives,

nosy fucking neighbors... next thing

you know, you're on tilt, you can't

think straight, you're clocking your

teacher in front of the whole class,

me... I'm hitting a damned deer...

Man, that was some shitty luck.

(then)

Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've

gotta clean this up. The irony is,

you've done all the hard stuff.

Whaddaya think: "Troubled youth

finally snapped." Maybe because he

was jealous of his girlfriend, or

maybe he just couldn't deal with the

guilt from not saving daddy.

(off Kale)

Hey, you Googled me.

Giles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly

does SNAP. He leans forward, grabs the LCD computer monitor

with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and HURLS it

at GILES, SMACKING HIM on the side of his head -- a one in a

hundred shot! Giles goes down.

But the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his

taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. Kale falls to

the floor, scrambles for the BASEBALL BAT just inches away --

GILES

staggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat,

rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE

CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the

bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back

to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings

it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward,

and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face! Kale staggers back, but

somehow keeps his balance and the bat. He spins around,

hops to the door into...

104   INT. 2ND FL HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            104

Kale rounds the corner and runs smack into ASHLEY.   The

collision sends Kale back to the floor.

ASHLEY

KALE --

Ashley leans down to Kale. Kale gestures with his eyes and

head: BEHIND YOU! Ashley gets the message, whirls around

just as Giles GRABS HER. Ashley SCREAMS and knees Giles.

He drops her to the floor. Ashley scrambles for Kale, helps

him to his feet, pulls Kale back down the hall to...

105   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            105

Ashley shoves Kale inside as she spins back, SLAMS the office

door in Giles' face, locks it. Giles BANGS on the door.

Ashley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth.   Kale

SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone.

KALE

It's dead.

Ashley grabs a pair of scissors off dad's desk, cuts Kale's

ankles and hands free. Kale reaches down to the ankle

bracelet, furiously tugs at it.

ASHLEY

Let me try --

Ashley moves in, tries to cut it loose with the scissors as

Giles suddenly SLAMS SOMETHING against the door, trying to

break it down!

ASHLEY (CONT'D)

Where's your mom --

KALE

(tugging on bracelet)

Living room -- tied up -- he got

Ronnie -- in the kitchen --

(then; re: bracelet)

GODDAMN YOU!!

ASHLEY

(giving up with

scissors)

Okay, just -- I'll get your mom, you

figure out a way to call the cops --

KALE

No, I've gotta get her --

ASHLEY

Kale, you've gotta get outside, get

over the boundary -- do you hear me?

KALE

(beat; then; an idea

sparking)

Okay, but -- just follow my lead --

we're gonna need stuff --

(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso

Ashley and Kale glance around for weapons. Ashley pockets

the scissors, grabs a letter opener off dad's desk. Kale

finds his racketball racket and the ball. Pockets the ball,

slips the racket in the back of his shorts, then grabs the

baseball bat as he heads for the bookshelves near the door

that leads to the outside porch. He reaches up, runs his

fingers to the third book on the middle shelf, pulls it out,

flips it open to reveal a KEY that drops in his hand.

KALE (CONT'D)

Once I have his attention, you go

get her.

Ashley nods. Kale takes the key, heads to the porch door,

unlocks it with a quiet CLICK. He swings the door open,

steps out onto...

106   EXT. 2ND FL PORCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                             106

Kale raises the bat, swings it at the 2nd floor hallway window

that separates the interior of the house from the porch.

The window SHATTERS. Kale tosses the bat back to Ashley.

KALE

(to Giles O.S.)

We're out here, asshole!

There's a lull in the thunder. All becomes eerily quiet for

a beat as Kale waits for Giles to appear at the window. He

glances back at Ashley who ducks behind the wall inside dad's

office -- she glances to the office door. No more BANGING.

She shrugs to Kale: "where is he?"

Another beat, then suddenly -- a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals

GILES

Standing in the other porch doorway BEHIND KALE!

ASHLEY

Kale!

Kale whirls around just as Giles reaches out, grabs him by

the throat, pulls him off his feet and HURLS KALE through

the shattered window into the hallway!

ASHLEY (CONT'D)

NO!   You son of a --

Ashley charges out onto the porch with the bat. Swings it

at Giles who promptly RIPS it from her hand and hurls it off

the porch. Ashley whips out the letter opener, spins around,

about to stab Giles, but he backhands her. Ashley falls,

SMACKS her head on the porch railing.

She drops to the floor, half conscious as Giles picks up the

letter opener, turns his attention back to the 2nd floor

hallway window --

HIS POV - THE HALLWAY - KALE'S GONE.

WHIP PAN to behind Giles -- REVEAL KALE - CHARGING OUT the

same porch door Giles just came out! Kale uses his FULL

BODY WEIGHT to SHOVE Giles back through the SAME BROKEN WINDOW

and into the hallway!

KALE

Ashley!   Are you okay?

ASHLEY

I wanna kill him --

KALE

Stick to the plan --

Over this, Kale pulls Ashley to her feet. They share a smile

as Ashley ducks into the porch door leading to Kale's room.

Kale turns back --

KALE'S POV - A BLOODY GILES

Gets to his feet and heads toward the window.   Kale turns

for the ladder, starts climbing up.

Giles pursues, steps out the window as we see Ashley, in the

b.g., appear from Kale's bedroom and race for the stairs!

107   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                      107

Kale reaches the top of the ladder, steps onto the roof, but

Giles, from below, HEAVES THE LADDER UPWARD, tripping Kale.

Kale SLAMS down on the roof, smacks the back of his head.

KALE'S BLURRY POV - against a fury of lightning flashes,

Giles races up the ladder and steps onto the roof. Stalks

toward Kale.

Kale gets to his feet, draws the racketball racket from his

shorts, takes out the ball, assumes a professional looking

serving position and WHAM! Kale beams the ball at Giles --

and misses completely.

KALE

That was a warning!

Giles rushes Kale who wails on him with the racket. Giles

ducks, spins around, brings his fist up and punches Kale in

the chest.

Kale drops the racket. It slides away down the roof as Kale

doubles over. But Giles grabs Kale before he can fall. He

pulls Kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his

face. Kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and

HEADBUTTS GILES.

Giles stumbles back, pulling Kale with him. Giles SLAMS

down on the roof. He and Kale roll down the incline and

stop just short of the edge --

Kale looks over, spots his STEREO SPEAKER a few feet away.

108   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 108

Ashley rounds the corner, heads to Julie.

ASHLEY

Hi, Mrs. Brecht, I'm Ashley --

(re: duct tape)

It's gonna hurt.

Julie nods as Ashley RIPS the tape off Julie's mouth.

JULIE

(not flinching)

Where's Kale?

109   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                        109

Kale HURLS the speaker at Giles', SMACKING him hard.        Giles

shakes it off, grabs the speaker wire --

WITH KALE - he gets to his feet, heads back up the roof as

Giles suddenly whips out the letter opener and hurls it like

a THROWING KNIFE at Kale.

The letter opener embeds itself in the back of Kale's thigh.

Kale screams, falls to his knees.

CU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind

him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls.

Kale grabs for it as Giles chokes the life out of him. Kale

only has one chance. He reaches behind his leg, grabs the

embedded letter opener, RIPS it away, twirls it in his hand

and shoves it back into Giles' stomach!

Giles recoils as Kale flings himself away from the choke-

hold, falls back to the roof, rolls down and PLUMMETS to --

110   EXT. GARAGE ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 110

Kale hits HARD, the wind knocked out of him. He looks over,

sees his racketball racket lying there. He grabs it, looks

back up.

KALE'S POV - Giles stands on the upper roof, smiles as he

brings up the letter opener.

Kale's eyes widen. He pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms

the racket up at Giles. The racket spins through the air

like a boomerang and miraculously smacks Giles in the hand,

knocking the letter opener away!

WITH KALE - he whirls around, races toward the edge of the

roof... and JUMPS.

ANGLE: FOLLOWING BEHIND KALE IN MID AIR, WE CRANE UP AND

OVER HIM PEERING DOWN TO REVEAL ASHLEY'S POOL!

ON THE ANKLE BRACELET - it FLASHES RED.

EXT. ASHLEY'S BACK YARD/SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Kale drops into the pool with a tremendous SPLASH!    He pulls

himself to the surface, peers up --

KALE'S POV - the roof -- Giles is gone.

Kale frantically swims to the edge, pulls himself out --

111   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER                                 111

The kitchen door slowly pushes open. After a beat, Kale

quietly steps in, heavily armed with a swimming pool LEAF-

SKIMMING NET.

Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates the kitchen. Kale

cautiously rounds the island, glances down: Ronnie's gone.

He glances to the block of butcher knives -- empty.

Kale grabs a couple of table knives from the kitchen drawer,

opts to keep the leaf-skimming net as he makes his way out

of the kitchen and into...

112   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 112

Breathing hard, Kale glances around, up the stairs --    No

sign of Giles. He rounds the corner into...

113   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                113

Julie's GONE. Kale's eyes widen. He turns around     as ASHLEY

suddenly jumps up from behind the sofa brandishing   a BUTCHER

KNIFE! She exhales in relief at the sight of Kale    who rounds

the back of the couch, sees Ronnie's body lying on   the floor

next to the entire set of butcher knives.

KALE

Where's my mom?

ASHLEY

She went upstairs for you -- where's

Giles?

KALE

I don't know -- the cops should be

here any sec --

The doorbell RINGS. Kale and Ashley whip their heads to the

door. Kale throws a troubled glance out the window --

ASHLEY

What's wrong?

KALE

No flashing lights -- stay here --

Kale trades Ashley the net for the butcher knife.     We then

FOLLOW KALE into...

114   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                114

Still no sign of Giles -- Kale turns back to Ashley, then

heads to the front door --

PEEPHOLE POV - Parker.

Kale swings the door open.

PARKER

Kale, what's going on now?

KALE

Parker, where's the cavalry?!

PARKER

I told 'em don't bother, you were my

responsibility --

KALE

Parker, you need to get them here

right now -- Giles is --

GILES (O.S.)

Evening.

Parker turns to see Giles casually walking up the front steps.

KALE

PARKER LOOK OUT, HE'S THE --

As Parker turns, Giles suddenly GRABS HER, spins her around

and TWISTS HER NECK. Parker drops forward into the entry

hall.

Kale stumbles back inside the door, tries to SLAM it closed,

but Giles overpowers Kale, shoves the door open, knocking

Kale to the floor. The butcher knife slides away under a

table.

Giles enters, kicks Parker's body out of the way and closes

the door. He steps toward Kale as Ashley, from O.S. suddenly

drops the LEAF-SKIMMING NET OVER HIS HEAD and furiously YANKS

Giles back to the floor!

Kale gets to his feet, grabs a vase off the entry hall table

and SMASHES it over Giles' head. Giles rolls away, only to

be KICKED HARD in the face by Ashley.

Kale and Ashley TAG TEAM Giles. But Giles finds an opening

and elbows both Ashley and Kale back to the floor. Kale

scrambles for the butcher knife back down the entry hall.

Giles gets to his feet, pounds after Kale who slides the

butcher knife out from under the table. But Giles suddenly

STOMPS down on Kale's hand.

Giles lifts his foot up. Kale pulls his hand away. Giles

kicks the knife away, grabs Kale up, SLAMS him against the

staircase banister, splintering it.

Kale drops back to the floor. Giles leans down to pick him

up when the BUTT OF A SHOTGUN suddenly SLAMS into the back

of Giles' head! Giles tumbles forward, spins around to see

JULIE

standing on the staircase with a 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN -- KABOOM!

Julie BLOWS GILES BACK INTO THE WALL!   -- And THAT'S WHERE

HE STAYS.

Julie races down to Kale, hugs him tight. Ashley comes to,

slowly makes her way over and joins the huddle...
