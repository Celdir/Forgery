1   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY                              1

A GIRL'S FACE

fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty.

Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair

worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though

no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little

frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively.

She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting:

institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining

the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the

SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The

shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive,

scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then -

A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her

eyes cut down to -

HER CELLPHONE

skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final

exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:

2   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY               2

Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a

big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates

sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock.

BACK TO:

OUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right

off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display.

INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY -

u done?!

BACK TO SCENE

Our girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod

to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply.

INTERCUT: CELL PHONE DISPLAY / OUR GIRL

She looks down as her friend text-messages:

how r u getting home?

Typing.

bus

She sends the message, a moment later the reply appears:

sux 4 U

She glances up, sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look.

PROCTOR (O.S.)

That's it, people! Wrap it up!

There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred

panicked asses twisting in their seats.

Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text

message from her friend:

y don't u check the ride board?

A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around

her students rise and begin stampeding out.

PROCTOR (O.S.) (cont'd)

(shouting to be heard)

Test results will be posted on the

Philosophy Department's web site in

two weeks... Enjoy your break and

have a Happy New Year.

She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the

stairs when -

GIRL

Hey!

- she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her.

She hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits.

3   EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               3

Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for

the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty,

the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie.

Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted

with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She

passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,

on her way to...

4   EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY                                    4

She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with

dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye-

catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads:

RIDE BOARD.

She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn

hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a

handwritten message:

NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23?

Call 607-154-9835

A gust of wind riffles the notice.

TITLE CARD ON BLACK:

DECEMBER 23, 3:12 P.M.

5   EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY                     5

Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking

lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the

sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes

swirl in their sickbed glow.

We follow her to...

A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the

lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the

only vehicle here for some time.

An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the

Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has

the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun

much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions:

books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc.

She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake.

He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.

GIRL

Do you think you could have parked

any further from the entrance?

The sight of her quickly snaps him awake.   He scrambles out.

GUY

(still a little groggy)

There were still cars when I got

here. I thought we were going to

get an early start to stay ahead of

the snow?

GIRL

What time is it?

GUY

Quarter past three.

GIRL

I'm two hours late?! Shit. Sorry.

You should've just left without me.

That's what I would've done. Hurry

up and pop the trunk so I can stow

my shit.

He does.

She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity

with more of his things: CLOTHES, a bag of GROCERIES, etc.

GIRL (cont'd)

(calling to him)

Jesus, I'm just going home for

Christmas. What are you doing?

Pulling up stakes and movin' your

Oakie family to Californey?

She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.

GUY

I'm kinda getting kicked out of my

apartment. I didn't have time to

find someplace new before exams.

She takes out some of his things.   Puts them on the ground.

GUY (cont'd)

Here, let me help you with that-

GIRL

Why don't you just get the engine

started and put the heat on? I can

handle this.

He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed.

GIRL (cont'd)

(smiling)

Well? What are you waiting for? I

thought you wanted to stay ahead of

the snow?

He hurries back to the driver's seat.   Starts the engine.

She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk.

Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door

handle.

Stuck.

Now it's her turn to look impatient. She jerks on the handle

again, until he leans over to open the door from the inside.

GUY

Sorry... it sticks.

She rolls her eyes, climbs in.

6        INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY                                           6

She climbs in, tries to power her window all the way to the

top. It keeps getting stuck, leaving a half-inch gap.

She shoots him a look: "What the hell?"

GUY

That's as far as it goes.   Sorry.

She rolls her eyes, never once interrupting her phone

conversation.

He puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour

roadtrip.

As they drive off, reveal: a forgotten bag of GROCERIES,

still sitting on the ground.

They leave campus.   He eavesdrops as she rattles on.

GIRL

(on her cell)

Where are you?

No, we're just rolling out...

... Believe me, I tried, but I

couldn't get a flight. It's my own

This isn't cool. If I have to

Because that's where I went. Saint

GIRL

Okay, fine...

GUY

We had a class together, you know.

GIRL

Huh?

GUY

Intro to Modern Philosophy.

You aren't majoring in philosophy?

No. Why?

I don't know. I just assumed...

Why would you assume anything about

me? We just met.

GUY

(a little defensive)

I don't know... I guess you just...

look like a philosophy major.

GIRL

Try engineering.

GIRL (cont'd)

I only took Philosophy because I

need a humanities credit. I heard

it was an easy `A.'

(then)

Hey, that reminds me. What'd you

put for the extra credit question

on the final?

GUY

Nietzsche's theory of eternal

recurrence.

GIRL

Which is basically reincarnation,

right?

No, they're not really the same

thing. Reincarnation is when you

come back as something different

and eternal recurrence is when you

That phrase. `Keeping your eyes

Huh. Actually, yeah, it is sorta.

... Speaking of peeling eyeballs.

Did you know that's how they do

that corrective eye surgery?

GIRL

They use a laser.

GUY

Well, yeah, they do... But there's

definitely peeling involved too. I

saw it on Discovery Health. If more

Laser.

Right, laser.

Whistling along with the song that always accompanies him.

Suddenly the dashboard air vents all OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.

The instant she sets foot outside she stops dead, the blood

rushing from her face and her eyes going wide in disbelief.

PAN 360-DEGREES to reveal a landscape she knows all-too-well:

The stranded `88 Oldsmobile.

The telephone pole she climbed.

They haven't gone anywhere.

No time to puzzle it out. The sound of the snowplow driver

making his way down the embankment O.S. stirs her to action.

101   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                                       101

She starts down the steep snowy embankment after the snowplow

driver, who is now far enough below to be out of sight.

GIRL

(calling down)

Wait! Don't go down there! Stop!

Suddenly the snowy leaves gives way under her and she SLIPS.

Lands hard and SLIDES the rest of the way down on her ass.

102   EXT. BOTTOM OF RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                             102

She comes to a stop thirty feet below at the bottom of the

ravine beside the surprised SNOWPLOW DRIVER.

And the HIGHWAY PATROL CAR.

It's resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the

ravine, wheels in the air. It looks like an overturned

beetle.

Something moves in its front seat.

The snowplow driver calls to the TRAPPED HIGHWAY PATROLMAN.

SNOWPLOW DRIVER

Hang on, officer! We'll get you

out!

She catches his arm to stop him.

Smoke rises from the car's gas tank, a small FIRE burning.

GIRL

Doesn't matter! He's already dead!

SNOWPLOW DRIVER

What the hell are you talking

about?

Inside the overturned car the trapped HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

struggles. His hat has fallen off and floats in the icy

water flooding the car, threatening to short the radio.

Which is playing the same song as Christmas Eve fifty-seven

years earlier. "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries

sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament.

We realize he's been drinking.

As he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the

direction of the snowplow driver and our girl.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Should've known you vultures would

turn up...

SNOWPLOW DRIVER

Try not to move, officer, you might

have a neck injury.

But the cop continues to struggle, pain sobering him.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

What are you waiting for, a letter

from the Bishop?

Suddenly it dawns on our girl that he isn't talking to them.

Also that they aren't alone.

Widen to reveal -

A DOZEN ELDERLY PRIESTS in black winter coats and fedoras are

standing all around them on the snowy embankment, faces grim.

The residents of St. Christopher's Home for Retired Clergy.

Suddenly there's a WHOOSH as the engine fire spreads across

the car's undercarriage, moving toward the FUEL TANK.

The priests exchange a look, reaching some silent decision.

The LEADER of the elderly priests comes forward.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)

Hurry it up, I smell gas...

The snowplow driver stands there, confused by what he's

witnessing.

The old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window

past the trapped highway patrolman.

Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord.

The cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes

the priests aren't going to help him. Are in fact condemning

him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)

(struggling)

Oh no you don't! You bastards have

no right to sit in judgement of me.

I know what you're thinking but I

had nothing to do with that drunk

girl's disappearance. I saw her

home safely. Just ask the County

investigators. And anything else

you think you saw? All of it was

lawfully done!

He sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above.

Another WHOOSH, blue flames spreading out from the fuel line.

The cop smells smoke, a pleading note entering his voice now.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)

Please, father... For the love of

Christ have mercy on a poor sinner!

There's a SMALL EXPLOSION, and the inside of the car starts

filling with FLAMES and black smoke.

The trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive, cursing.

Goddamn you filthy bastards! You

Flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered

here to bear mute witness. They watch the burning patrol car

for a moment longer, then one by one climb the embankment.

GIRL

Come on. We can go now. It's over.

The snowplow driver, stunned, speechless, can only stand

there and nod.

Suddenly -

The COP launches himself out of the window of the overturned

car at them.

Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks,

dragging his paralyzed lower body after them.

The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in

place, unable to move.

She grabs him by the arm, pulls him away.

He comes to his senses, staggers up the embankment after her.

He loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling.

As the cop seizes him around the legs, and starts crawling up

the length of his body.

We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading

with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he

shrieks in agony.

Until even his shriek is FROZEN IN HIS LUNGS.

ANGLE ON OUR GIRL

As she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the

horror below.

Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on

her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below.

She whimpers, fingers clutching at anything.

Finally she succeeds, manages to haul herself up the steep

embankment, climbing with everything she's got left in her

until she reaches the road.

glory, grinning at her.

Then the smile curdles. He reaches through the shattered

window. Grabbing for her.

She scrabbles just out of reach.    Pins herself against the

opposite door. Cornered.

Suddenly -

And OUR GUY'S GHOST appears out of the gloom.

He swings a CROWBAR into the cop's skull.

She's back inside the STRANDED OLDSMOBILE, seated beside the

body of our guy.

Her panicked breathing turns into hyperventilation as she

realizes all efforts to escape the road are futile.

Suddenly she spots something through the windshield that

causes her breath to catch -

OUR GUY'S GHOST

She gasps.    Starts sobbing.

Suddenly -

A familiar SONG begins to chime on her cellphone RINGTONE:

Ding-da-da DING, da-DING da-DING...

Her eyes widen in terror. She fumbles out the cellphone.

Stabs the "off" button with her thumb.

She instinctively starts back to the stranded Oldsmobile -

Stops -

Looks at the ghost.

And in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow

him.

She takes off down the road.

We follow as she hurries to catch up with our guy's ghost.

But it's no use. She stops trying to keep up and pauses

briefly, devastated, catching her breath. Then she pushes on

in the direction he went.

TIME DISSOLVE:

It's almost light out now, and SHE'S ALONE, staggering along

the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows. It's like

running in a dream, never fast enough to outdistance an

unseen pursuer.

But then she hears it -

THE HIGHWAY.

She can't believe she's made it back to civilization.

FADE TO BLACK.

of trucks backing up, the BLEET of arriving ambulances, the

constant CHATTER of two-way radios.

OUR GIRL is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a

blanket draped around her shoulders, allowing EMTs to treat

her frostbite.

She watches ATTENDANTS from the county morgue zip the bodies

of our guy and the snowplow driver into BODYBAGS.
