VOICE

Bleichert! Bleichert!

VOICE OVER

I already knew him by reputation, had our

respective records down pat: Lee

Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,

formerly a regular attraction at the

Hollywood Legion Stadium.

LEE BLANCHARD

Code three, Bleichert!

VOICE OVER

And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-

heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring

magazine in 1937 fighting no-name

opponents in no-man's-land division.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

In our first year at Central we'd never

spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions

about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard

fight, and who would win.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by

early KO; Bleichert by decision;

Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but

Bleichert by knockout.

LEE

To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.

LEE (cont'd)

(re the Zooter)

Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos

Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive

warrant for manslaughter committed during

the commission of a Class B Felony.

Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she

keeled of a heart attack.

BUCKY

You come all the way down here to roust--

LEE

(smiling)

I came all the way down here same as you

did.

(jerks a finger to the riots)

Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see

those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--

(nudging Dos Santos)

Habla Ingles, Tomas?

LEE (cont'd)

He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas

chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's

about six weeks away from the Big Adios.

Been better off getting a couple cracked

ribs from our Privates First Class back

there.

LEE (cont'd)

We'll never get him booked tonight.

CUT TO:

LEE

Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the

month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In

three years I'll be working Central

Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there

wets his pants for fighters. Promised me

the next spot he can wangle.

BUCKY

(not impressed)

Impressive.

LEE

(not impressed either)

Wanna hear something more impressive? My

first twenty fights were stumblebums

handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend

saw you fight a couple times over at the

Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.

BUCKY

Whatta we do about the Mex?

LEE

We'll take 'em in the morning.

BUCKY

You'll take him.

LEE

He's half yours, partner.

BUCKY

He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

LEE

(without turning)

Someday.

DISSOLVE TO:

ROOKIE

Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.

Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk

fights over three-dollar skank tail...

ROOKIE

...fights over three-dollar skank tail...

BUCKY

Somethin' up, Tommy?

TOM

You, that's what.

(off Bucky's look)

You know Lee Blanchard over at Central

Warrants?

TOM

His partner's toppin' his twenty and

goin' for early retirement. Word is the

felony D.A.'s lookin' for a bright boy to

fill the spot. Christ knows why but it's

down to you and Johnny Vogel for the

spot.

BUCKY

His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick.

TOM

(chucking Bucky on the chin)

But who'd look better when they bring back

the boxing team, eh Buckaroo?

VOICE OVER

Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.

Warrants was plainclothes without a coat

and tie, romance and a mileage per diem

on your civilian car. Warrants was going

after the real bad guys and not rousting

winos and wienie waggers in front of the

Midnight Mission.

VOICE OVER

I told myself I didn't care.

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

Officer Bleichert.

LEE

(getting to his feet)

Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief

Thad Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.

CHIEF GREEN

Read this aloud, Officer. It's running in

Sunday's Times.

BUCKY

"Before the war, the City of the Angels

was graced with two local fighters, born

and raised a scant five miles apart,

pugilists with styles as different as

fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a

bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

CHIEF GREEN

Skip down to the fire and ice part.

BUCKY

(searching, finding)

"Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each

other, but a sense of duty brought them

together in spirit, and both joined the

Los Angeles Police Department." Blanchard

cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens

bank robbery case in 1939 and captured

thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert

served with distinction during the '43

Zoot Suit Wars--"

CHIEF GREEN

Skip to the end.

BUCKY

"Both men made great sacrifices to serve

their city, and on Election Day, voters

are going to be asked to do the same

thing--vote on a five million dollar bond

proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment

and provide for an eight percent pay

raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the

examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote

"Yes" on Proposition B."

CHIEF GREEN

Whattya think?

BUCKY

Subtle.

ELLIS LOEW

Prop. B's looking like a loser right now.

But if we can drum up some publicity we

may he able to get it passed in the '47

Special. We need to build up morale in

the department.

Impress voters with the quality of our

men. Wholesome white boxers are a big

draw, Bleichert. You know that.

LEE

Fire and Ice.

LOEW

Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks

from now. Right before the election. All

the gate to charity. After that, we bring

back the interdivisional boxing team.

Wholesome fighters.

LEE

Wholesome.

CHIEF GREEN

Are you in, Bucky?

LEE

It's not like you'll last the ten rounds

anyway.

BUCKY

I'm in.

LOEW

I'm betting on great things from you,

Bleichert. And if I don't miss my bet we

may be colleagues soon.

BUCKY

Uh, yes sir.

LEE

Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

BUCKY

Hello.

FAY

I saw you fight a couple times. You won.

BUCKY

I always won. You a fight fan?

KAY

Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme

art classes so I'd sketch the boxers.

LEE

Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't

want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."

BUCKY

I'll try not to hurt you.

LEE

Sure make Loew happy.

BUCKY

He's got money on me, I gather?

LEE

Seems that way.

BUCKY

And if I win I get Warrants?

LEE

Seems that way.

BUCKY

What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?

KAY

For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets

ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.

For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.

And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both

look good with your shirts off.

BUCKY

Luck short of winning.

LEE

You, too.

KAY

Luck, Dwight.

VOICE OVER

The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as

official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an

early 3 to 1 favorite...

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

...while the real bookie line had Mr.

Fire favored by knockout at 2 1/2 to 1,

and decision by 5 to 3.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Even the dicks in Ad Vice had suspended

bookie shakedowns because Mickey Cohen

was raking ten grand a day and kickin'

back five percent to the advertising

agency promoting the bond issue.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

I was a local celebrity again.

BUCKY

Papa?

DOLPH

Guten tag, Dwight.

BUCKY

Speak English, papa.

DOLPH

Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!

BUCKY

Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me

how you can fuck this place up so bad in

one month.

DOLPH

Du, Dwight? Du?

BUCKY

Speak...English. Papa, please.

BUCKY

...He's had another stroke. If you could

just come by and clean the place up and

keep an eye on him for week or so...a

hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten

days. I promise. I do. Thank you.

VOICE OVER

He was better than I thought. It made

what came next easier.

PETE

So...I'm surprised but I'm not so

surprised. I hear you been lookin' good.

Better'n people think.

PETE (cont'd)

I guess what I hear is correct. Then

you'll be wantin' to place this with

Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard

2 to 1--

BUCKY

I'm not bettin' on me, Pete.

PETE

(a beat)

Oh.

(another beat)

Then as a friend I feel it's my duty to

tell you this: you better make it look

good.

BUCKY

Knockout between rounds eight and ten.

PETE

Dragna's got a guy really sold on you.

Even money. Best you're gonna get.

BUCKY

Thanks, Pete.

PETE

Luck.

BUCKY

Short of winning?

PETE

Luck.

VOICE OVER

I'd almost finished the Police Academy

when the background check turned up my

father's German-American Bund membership.

Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my

patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam

Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in

order to secure my LAPD appointment.

VOICE OVER

The old fuck never knew any better. Never

knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd

died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the

snitch's jacket and with a little

alteration I slipped easily into the

whole suit.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

I had traded Warrants for a close-out on

bad old debts, the eight grand I was

gonna clear enough to maintain the old

man in a good clean rest home for three

years; the late round tank job enough to

convince myself I wasn't a complete

coward.

KAY

At least he looks good with his shirt

off.

BUCKY

Where's your sketch pad?

KAY

I was never very good. Ended up with a

degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight

money paid for it.

BUCKY

Education's an expensive habit to kick.

(beat)

He shouldn't have quit fighting.

KAY

I asked him to. Besides, catching

animals gave him a sense of order. You

have a girlfriend, Dwight?

BUCKY

Saving myself for Rita Hayworth.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Quits fighting for you. Puts you through

school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

KAY

(flirting)

We're not getting married if that's what

you're wondering.

BUCKY

Why not? Shacking's against the regs.

Probably cost him a stripe.

KAY

I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow

night.

BUCKY

You didn't answer my question--

KAY

(a throwaway)

Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight.

VOICE OVER

With no lead on the two escaped men, the

heist quickly went from page one to page

five. Two weeks later...

VOICE OVER

One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby

DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard

long rap, as the brains behind the bank

job.

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

DeWitt howled frame-up the entire trial,

never ID'ing the driver or coughing up

the dough, even after damning character

testimony from some of his employees,

including one Katherine Lake, formerly of

Sioux Falls, South Dakota and looking to

go straight.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

DeWitt got ten to life at San Quentin;

Lee got Kay, or maybe the other way

around.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

They both got a few weeks in the gossip

pages before Kay dove into her college

education and Lee down the hero's road

ending in Warrants and a shack job with a

woman he loved but wouldn't touch...

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

You come off a winning fight. Sweat-

drenched, tasting blood, still wanting to

go. The handbooks who made money on you

bring you a girl. A pro, a semi-pro. You

do it in the dressing room, or a hallway.

The eleventh round of a ten round fight.

And when you go back to an ordinary life,

it's just weakness, a loss.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

To a fighter, sex tastes like blood and

resin and suture scrub. I wondered if

some day that would ever be different.

CUT TO:

PETE

Well?

BUCKY

He'll catch on soon enough.

VOICE OVER

Hey. Canvasback!

LEE

You gonna hide in there another week?

Ain't you bored yet?

BUCKY

Gettin' there.

LEE

Wanna work Warrants with me?

BUCKY

What?

LEE

Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You

been hibernating--

BUCKY

But I lost. Loew's deal--

LEE

Don't you read the papers? The bond issue

passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?

VOICE OVER

Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the

snitch.

CUT TO:

TIERNEY

(as introduction)

Officer Bleichert, the men of Central

Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et

cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and

Lee are the white men of the hour, so I

hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't

get another one until you retire.

TIERNEY (cont'd)

Enough horseshit. This is the felony

summary for the week ending November 14,

1946. First, three liquor store

stickups...

TIERNEY (cont'd)

And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack

to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have

you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill

burglaries?

TIERNEY (cont'd)

Set of latents at the last break-in ID's

one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A

surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got

four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's

our boy, maybe not. But between that and

the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high

priority lamster right now. There's a

list of his known associates on the

bulletin board. Let's all take a look...

RUSS MILLARD

(introducing himself)

Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids

thank you for the raise, Officer.

RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)

(re the other man)

My partner, Harry Sears.

HARRY

(stuttering)

Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-

Bleichert.

ELLIS LOEW

Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central

Warrants--

ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)

You shouldn't have slugged with him. You

were ahead on all three cards.

BUCKY

The proposition passed, sir.

ELLIS LOEW

Yes but some of your patron's lost money.

Play things smarter here. Don't blow this

like you blew the fight.

LEE

Ready to roll, canvasback?

BUCKY

Why'd you really quit fighting?

LEE

(matter of fact)

Benny Siegel bought out my contract,

scared off my manager. Said he'd get me a

shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives

for him. I said no, joined the Department

'cuz Jew syndicate boys won't kill cops.

Anything else?

BUCKY

(as they exit the car)

One more. What are we doin' here?

LEE

While you were dancing with Ellis at

muster I checked Maynard Coleman's KA's

on the bulletin and recognized the name

of a fence. Think he tends bar here...

LEE

Bruno Albanese?

BRUNO

Who wants to know?

LEE

Police officers, Bruno. Let's make this

fast so I don't have to watch you eat.

LEE (cont'd)

We know he sells to you and we don't

care. Where is he?

BRUNO

Never seen 'em before.

BRUNO

Versailles apartments. Sixth and St.

Andrews.

BUCKY

Right there!

BUCKY

Police officer. You're under arrest.

VOICE OVER

Let go of him! Let go of him!

BOY

Let go a my daddy! Daddy!

LEE

They got here fast.

(off Bucky's look)

The confession.

LEE (cont'd)

(re the two meatheads)

Play nice. They've got juice with Loew.

KOENIG

(stupid and proud)

He confessed. Kiddie porks and the

burglaries. Fritzie says we're all

getting commendations.

VOGEL

Ellis loves the kid angle.

LEE

You talk to Ellis?

VOGEL

He's only "Ellis" to lieutenants on up,

Blanchard.

LEE

Least I don't call him "kike".

VOGEL

(flushing)

C'mon, Billy.

BUCKY

Play nice. Hm.

LEE

Shitbirds.

HARRY

Russ says good collar today.

HARRY (cont'd)

And Lee--I heard something you oughta

know--I was over at County Parole--Bobby

DeWitt got an "A" number. He'll be

released to LA around mid-January.

LEE

You like pot roast?

LEE

Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.

It'll upset her.

BUCKY

You takin' bribes, partner?

LEE

Fight stash.

KAY

Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.

FAY

Fairy tale come true, isn't it?

BUCKY

Hm?

FAY

The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy

tale.

BUCKY

Can't say I believe in fairy tales.

KAY

Then you've never really had to. Lucky

man. (beat) Lee! Dinner!

LEE

A toast...To Proposition B!

BUCKY

To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch!

Bigger than Louis/Schmeling!

KAY

To fairy tales!

BUCKY

(abruptly, drunk)

To...us!

LEE

Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a

quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear

is fear itself."

ELLIS LOEW

Here's the man to fear.

BUCKY

Give us the good news. He's in LA and

actin' uppity?

ELLIS LOEW

Witnesses made him at a stickup near

Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol-

whipped an old lady. She died about an

hour ago.

RUSS MILLARD

Anything common in the sex beefs?

ELLIS LOEW

Negro girls. Young ones. All the

complainants have been colored.

LEE

Seeya in Leimert Park.

ELLIS LOEW

Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the

man. I'd like to do it in court.

VOICE OVER

From November through the New Year, Lee

and I captured a total of eleven hard

felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and

three parole and probation absconders...

VOICE OVER

After tours of duty, Lee and I would go

to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she

made dinner for us, other times the three

of us would go dancing, or see a flick.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Always she'd be there, never in between

us, but always in the middle. It was the

best time of my life.

LEE

This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm

callin' in some favors.

LEE

Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's

shacking with some poon in a crib near

Slauson and Hoover.

BUCKY

It's all colored down there--

LEE

We fuckin' roll.

CUT TO:

LEE

Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address

or a name.

WHITE HOPHEAD

What the---Blanchard?

LEE

Shut up, shitbird.

BUCKY

Partner!

LEE

Bucky duck!

DETECTIVE

Thank you for your time, Officer. And

your police work, as well.

DETECTIVE (cont'd)

Your partner's taking this hard.

BUCKY

He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch.

Busted him once for loitering. Sort of

liked the guy.

KAY

Oh baby. Oh babe.

LEE

Leave me alone! You'll never fucking

understand--

BUCKY

He knew one of the guys.

BUCKY (cont'd)

It was them or us.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--

KAY

Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.

We're on edge. He swore at the trial he

was going to kill Lee.

BUCKY

We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.

KAY

Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.

BUCKY

I know as much as I need to know.

LEE

Rise and shine partner!

BUCKY

Lee? You okay?

LEE

Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and

ten. Played house with Kay all day

yesterday. Feel like doing some police

work?

BUCKY

Keep going.

LEE

Junior Nash's got a fuck pad on Norton

and Coliseum.

LEE

Okie trash.

BUCKY

Lee.

LEE

Is that Millard and Sears?

RUSS MILLARD

Before this gets out of hand let's put

the kibosh on something. If this gets a

lot of publicity we're going to get a lot

of confessions. So we keep some things

quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You

keep this information to yourselves. Not

your wives, not your girlfriends, no

other officers.

RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)

No reporters view the body. You photo

men, take your pictures now. Coroner's

men, you put a sheet on the body as soon

as they're done. Set up a perimeter six

feet back. Any reporter crosses it,

arrest him.

(noticing Bucky)

Bleichert. What are you doing here?

Where's Blanchard?

BUCKY

Nash is renting a room in that building

over there.

RUSS MILLARD

Blood on the premises?

BUCKY

No. This isn't him.

RUSS MILLARD

The lab'll be the judge of that.

BUCKY

Hey. Junior Nash, remember?

LEE

He didn't do this.

BUCKY

No. He beat an old woman to death. That's

why he's our priority warrantee.

LEE

Not anymore.

BUCKY

This ain't ours, partner--

LEE

(on edge)

It is now, partner.

CUT TO:

OFFICER

(to an old woman)

Have you heard female screams...

BUCKY

(to an off-duty serviceman)

...anyone discarding women's clothing?

LEE

(to a little kid)

...seen anyone in the lot on 39th...

BUCKY

(to a housewife)

...and what about this man?

(holds out a photo of Junior

Nash)

BUCKY

You were supposed to meet me at the

fights tonight, remember?

LEE

Priority. Remember.

BUCKY

Priority for the Bureau. Not for us.

LEE

Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show

the voters they did the right thing

passing the bond issue. It's a showcase.

It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.

BUCKY

We've had enough headlines for the week.

LEE

With or without you, partner.

LEE (cont'd)

With or without you.

BUCKY

I heard you.

OFFICER

Confessors.

KOENIG

He didn't do it.

BUCKY

(to another cop)

Blanchard?

OFFICER

In with Loew.(beat) And reporters.

CUT TO:

ELLIS LOEW

...and the heinous nature of this killing

makes it imperative to catch this fiend

as soon as possible. A number of

specially trained officers, including Mr.

Fire and his partner Mr. Ice...

BUCKY

You got us detached?

LEE

Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a

memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction--

BUCKY

You did what?

LEE

It's all right. The APB still stands.

We've got the pad staked. He's covered.

LEE (cont'd)

One week. Just one week. After that, it's

back to Junior. I promise.

LEE (cont'd)

Copacetic.

CUT TO:

LEE

Jesus, Bucky.

CORONER

On gross pathology, we have a female

Caucasian between sixteen and thirty.

Cadaver is presented in two halves with

bisection level with the umbilicus.

CORONER (cont'd)

...Through-and through laceration from

both mouth corners...no visible signs of

neck bruises...massive depressed skull

fractures...Inspection of upper half

abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing

blood. Intestines, stomach, liver and

spleen removed.

RUSS MILLARD

Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?

CORONER

She's not going to mind.

CORONER (cont'd)

Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal

of reproductive organs...Both legs broken

at the knee, and healing, light lash

marks on the upper back and shoulders...

LEE

(reading)

Bingo.

CORONER

Questions?

RUSS MILLARD

What's your best guess?

CORONER

Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped,

she wasn't pregnant, dried semen

indicates voluntary intercourse within

the last week...She took what I'd call a

gentle whipping in the last ten days...In

terms of the nitty-gritty...She was

probably tortured with a knife for thirty-

six to forty-eight hours before death.

The cause of which is either the mouth

wound or more likely she was beaten to

death with something like a baseball bat.

LEE

What about her insides?

CORONER

They came out after death. Then I'd say

he drained the blood from the body and

washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.

LEE

Did the guy know anything about medicine

or anatomy?

CORONER

Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but

that doesn't rule out veterinary

training, biological training, or my

Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA.

Has she got a name yet?

RUSS MILLARD

Elizabeth Short.

CORONER

(saluting heaven)

God love you, Elizabeth.

(to Millard)

Russell, when you get the son of a bitch

who did this to her, give him a kick in

the balls and tell him it's from

Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you

get out of here, I've got a date with a

jumper suicide in ten minutes.

CAPTAIN JACK

Cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.

Underage drinking. Other than that she's

clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced.

Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some

old portrait photos of her to the Herald.

RUSS MILLARD

How many confessions so far?

CAPTAIN JACK

Eighteen.

RUSS MILLARD

Double that by morning. More if Loew got

the press excited with his purple prose.

LOEW

(he's been eavesdropping)

I'd say my prose fits the crime,

Lieutenant.

RUSS MILLARD

Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis.

If you were a policeman you'd know that.

ELLIS LOEW

(to Tierney)

Captain have you sent men to talk to the

victim's father?

CAPTAIN JACK

Not yet, Ellis.

ELLIS LOEW

How about Vogel and Koenig?

CAPTAIN JACK

Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should

send?

CUT TO:

CLEO SHORT

Cops, huh?

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

I've got an alibi, just in case you think

I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and

that is air tight.

BUCKY

I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This

is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to

express our condolences for the loss of

your daughter.

CLEO SHORT

I know who you are. Neither of you'da

lasted a round with Gentleman Jim

Jeffries.

(beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She

called the tune, she paid the piper.

(beat) You wanna hear my alibi?

LEE

Since you're so anxious to tell it.

CLEO SHORT

Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-

seven straight hours. Refrigerator

repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the

last seventeen overtime. Call my boss.

He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn

fart, and that's air tight.

BUCKY

When was the last time you saw your

daughter?

CLEO SHORT

Betty came west in '43 with stars in her

eyes. I promised her three squares and a

five-spot if she kept the house tidy.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Gave her the boot in July. She moved to

Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple

weeks later. Some soldier beat her up

bad. Last I heard from her.

BUCKY

Was that soldier her boyfriend?

CLEO SHORT

They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly

and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong

there. Betty believed in quantity before

quality.

LEE

You calling your own daughter a tramp?

CLEO SHORT

Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't

so bad.

BUCKY

Any names, Mr. Short?

CLEO SHORT

Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.

(he drifts for a moment)

Said she was looking for movie work

but...just paraded the Boulevard in those

black get-ups of hers.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Who wouldn't get herself killed doin'

that? Who? Who wouldn't?

LEE

Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire

U.S. Armed forces as suspects.

BUCKY

Flip to see who writes it up?

LEE

I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See

if we get any strange drive-bys at the

murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in

on Kay. She's worried about me.

BUCKY

She's a smart woman.

KAY

Hi, Dwight.

BUCKY

How'd you know it was me?

KAY

Lee stomps, you tread lightly.

BUCKY

Lee's--

KAY

Let me guess...Lee's up all night--

probably on Benzedrine again--working

that poor girl's murder--

KAY

You're worried about him. And he's

worried about me.

(beat)

But who's worried about you? Is that left

for me?

BUCKY

No need for that.

KAY

For such a cautious man you're quite a

hardcase.

BUCKY

It's just...He's done a lot for me.

KAY (cont'd)

Good night.

RUSS MILLARD (O.S.)

(re trunk)

Found it in storage down at the railway.

Carbons of mash notes to sailors.

Hundreds of 'em.

RUSS MILLARD

Thank our friend Bevo Means at the

Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her

black dress like some actress in that

Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should

triple our confessions.

BUCKY

Great.

RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)

Hollywood will fuck you when no else

will. What do you think?

BUCKY

I think I want to go back to Warrants.

RUSS MILLARD

No dice. You're a bright penny and I want

you here.

(hands him a piece of paper)

Betty's last known residences and KA's.

Go to University Station and pick up Bill

Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a

tight leash, and you write the report

because Billy's practically illiterate.

BUCKY

Lieutenant--

RUSS MILLARD

Call me Russ and get out of here.

BUCKY

How do you want to play this, Sarge?

KOENIG

Fritzie usually does the talking and I

stand back up.

(re a leather sap in his belt)

Muscle job?

BUCKY

Let's try talk job.

BUCKY

Miss Saddon?

SHERYL

You the driver from RKO?

BUCKY

Police.

SHERYL

If this is about those jaywalking--

BUCKY

It's about Elizabeth Short.

SHERYL

I did all this on the phone this morning.

Nine thousand questions about Betty's

nine thousand boyfriends and I don't

remember any of the names. Can I go now?

The extras truck is due any minute.

BUCKY

How about you sit dawn and answer my

questions or I bust you for the reefer

you flushed.

BUCKY (cont'd)

First question. Does a...

(re to his paper)

Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live

here?

SHERYL

That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and

Orange.

BUCKY

She moved around quite a bit. You know

why? Was somebody threatening her?

SHERYL

Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was

too many friends.

BUCKY

I've gathered that. Let's change the

subject.

SHERYL

How 'bout "the world of high finance"?

BUCKY (cont'd)

How about movies? You girls are all

tryin' to break in, right?

SHERYL

(re her extras costume)

I'm in mister.

BUCKY

Congratulations. What about Betty?

SHERYL

Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round

Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about

gettin' her big break...Had one of those

viewfinders around her neck? But who

knows where she really got it. Betty had

a tendency to--

BUCKY

...stretch the truth?

SHERYL

Lie.

BUCKY

Your ride's here--

KOENIG

What'd the cooze say 'bout me?

KOENIG

I'm bored.

BUCKY

This'll just take a minute.

KOENIG

I'm gonna take those two guys outside.

Maybe they knew the cooze--

BUCKY

I'll handle 'em Sarge--

KOENIG

No! I'm gonna do it! (beat) Now what do I

roust 'em about?

BUCKY

I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if

Betty ever engaged in prostitution...

MARJORIE

...Betty had this gift, you see. She was

so sweet and eager to please...a bit

dumb, maybe. But she'd do anything to be

liked, become whatever you wanted her to

be. She'd walk like you, or talk like

you...but she wasn't...she was still her.

BUCKY

Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?

Sometime around November?

MARJORIE

Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed

it around to all the guys. Said it was

from the director. A co-starring role.

BUCKY

Did she say what it was?

MARJORIE

Once she said it was for Fox. Another

time Paramount. I think she was just

fibbing. You know, for the boys.

BUCKY

Do you remember the names of any of the

guys?

MARJORIE

Don and Harold--sitting outside. She

dated both of 'em once or twice. Other

than that...I just...didn't really pay

attention to who she was with.

BUCKY

What is it? You can tell me.

MARJORIE

Well...Right before she moved out...l saw

her and Linda...

BUCKY

Linda Martin?

MARJORIE

Yeah. Her and Linda Martin--talking to

this older woman up on the Boulevard. She

had a man's suit and short hair like a

man...Only that one time...

BUCKY

Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?

KOENIG

Them guys talked. Said the stiff peddled

her twat when she got strapped bad. I

called it in. Mr. Loew said to keep it

zipped cuz it don't look as good.

BUCKY

Take their statements, Bill. I've got a

little more here.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Linda Martin's room?

MARJORIE

That's her. God...She's only fifteen.

BUCKY

(re card)

Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska.

Runaway. When'd you see her last?

MARJORIE

This morning. I told her I'd called the

police to come talk to us about Betty.

Was that the wrong thing to do?

BUCKY

You couldn't have known.

KOENIG

(re the men)

They didn't do it.

BUCKY

No shit Sherlock.

MAN (O.S.)

Your name please?

ELIZABETH SHORT

Elizabeth Short. Betty. Beth...Elizabeth.

MAN (O.S)

Relax, Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH SHORT

Sorry. Can we try it again?

MAN (O.S.)

We haven't even started yet.

ELIZABETH SHORT

Oh.

VOICE OVER

I used a Warrant cops special prerogative

and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka

Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report,

omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the

old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew

quashing it along with the skinny on

Betty as the part-time prostie.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed

on Betty Short's low-rent last months on

earth and decided to kiss off the rest of

the day and head to Lee and Kay's for a

sandwich.

CUT TO:

KAY

Hi, Dwight.

LEE

(wired)

It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who

did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the

whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you

took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?

KAY

Lee, Dwight's here.

LEE

Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay.

Babe's got ideas. Good stuff--

KAY

This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but

I'll give you a theory if you'll eat

something to calm yourself down.

LEE

Theory on, teach.

KAY

Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were

two killers. Because the torture cuts are

crude, while the bisection and the cut on

the abdomen are neat and clean...

VOICE OVER

Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA.

Three days since we killed four men.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too

much.

BUCKY

Administrative Vice Squad?

DISSOLVE TO:

BARTENDER

Beverage Control?

BUCKY

(downing the whiskey)

LAPD Homicide.

BARTENDER

Who got snuffed?

BUCKY

Seen either of 'em?

BARTENDER

Huh. The Dahlia's a sister?

BUCKY

You tell me.

BARTENDER

Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And

the little schoolgirl twist I've never

seen. We don't truck with underaged

stuff. Capice?

BUCKY

Capice when your girls tell me that.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BUCKY

Black Dahlia.

BARTENDER

No shit.

BUCKY

What about this girl?

BARTENDER

Never seen her.

BUCKY

Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's

fifteen fucking years old. So you come

clean or I slap a contributing beef on

you, and you spend the next five years

servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in

Tehachapi.

BARTENDER

A couple times. Two, three months ago.

Just to cadge drinks off the sisters,

though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not

the Dahlia. Never.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNOUNCER

We interrupt our regular broadcast to

bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in

the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the

raven-haired beauty known as the Black

Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a

Huntington Park hardware salesman and one

of the last men to be seen with the

Dahlia, was captured early this morning.

Currently being held at Hollenback

Station--

CUT TO:

LEE

Dahlia left San Diego six days before we

found her. Dago cops got a witness puts

her in a tan Dodge with a partial plate

ident. Finally got a cross-check that

matched on Red here.

MILLARD

Like I said, Robert. We're doing this

because you didn't come forward.

RED MANLEY

I've told it three times now. I didn't

want my wife to know I was chipping her.

MILLARD

But you said you didn't chip on her.

Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason

to hide from the police.

RED MANLEY

I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced

with her. It's the same thing as

chipping.

MILLARD

And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

RED MANLEY

I wanted...to test my loyalty to my wife.

MILLARD

Come on, son!

RED MANLEY

I wanted to fuck her. Yes.

MILLARD

But she cock-teased you.

RED MANLEY

She said she had her period--

RED MANLEY

Said the father of her child would be a

combat veteran--

MILLARD

And you were in the Army band. You get

angry?

RED MANLEY

I told you. I didn't kill her.

MILLARD

You drove her back to LA with you

on...December tenth? And dropped her at

the Biltmore Hotel?

RED MANLEY

I've told it how many ways? How many more

ways do you went to hear it?

BUCKY

Welcome back to earth, partner.

LEE

Your fault, really. After you left Kay

slipped me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen

hours.

BUCKY

Your fault for buying her all those

chemistry classes.

LEE

Learn anything interesting?

BUCKY

No.

LEE

(re the interrogation)

Now you'll see why Russ keeps Harry

around.

LEE

(re the sap)

Russ's only rule. No actual hitting.

HARRY SEARS

You wanted some fresh gash, and you

thought Betty was easy. You came on

strong and that didn't work. You offered

her money. She told you she was on the

rag, and that was the final straw. You

wanted to make her bleed for real--

RED MANLEY

No no no. Not Betty--

HARRY SEARS

You plied Betty with drinks, got her to

talk about her old boyfriends and came on

like a pal, like the nice little corporal

willing to leave Betty to the real men,

the men who saw combat--

RED MANLEY

No--

HARRY SEARS

You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of

those abandoned warehouses out by the old

Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some

twine and lots of cutting tools lying

around, and you got a hard-on...

RED MANLEY

No no no--

HARRY SEARS

Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every

girl who said "I don't suck", every time

your mommy spanked you, every evil eye

you got from real soldiers when you

played your trombone in the army band.

RED MANLEY

No--

HARRY SEARS (cont'd)

Goldbrick, needle-nick, pussy-whipped--

RED MANLEY

No--

HARRY SEARS

That's what Betty had to pay for wasn't

it?

RED MANLEY

No, please! God as my witness!

HARRY SEARS

God hates liars!

HARRY SEARS (cont'd)

Tell me, Red! Tell Betty! Tell God!

RED MANLEY

I didn't hurt her--

HARRY SEARS

Tell God!

RED MANLEY

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

want...

RUSS MILLARD

Good report yesterday, Bleichert.

BUCKY

Thanks.

RUSS MILLARD

What next?

BUCKY

You send me back to Warrants?

RUSS MILLARD

Wrong again. But keep going.

BUCKY

Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red

dropped her off there on the tenth maybe

we can start reconstructing the last days

before she got snatched.

RUSS MILLARD

Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky.

Run with the ball.

BUCKY

All I know is you should keep an eye on

Loew and his boys.

I didn't put it in my report, but Betty

sold it outright when she needed money

bad enough, and Loew's been trying to

keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if

he ever takes it to trial.

RUSS MILLARD

(smiles)

You calling your boss an evidence

suppressor?

BUCKY

And a grandstanding son of a bitch.

RUSS MILLARD

You're a brighter penny than I thought.

(hands him a sheet of paper)

Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I

need smart pennies to eliminate the

phonies from the tip sheet.

BUCKY

What are you gonna do?

MILLARD

Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor

son of a bitch and his minions to make

sure they don't try to coerce a

confession out of that innocent man in

the holding tank.

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I

listened the more they talked about

themselves, interweaving their sad tales

with the Black Dahlia, who they actually

believed to be a glamorous siren headed

for Hollywood stardom...

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

It was as if they would have traded their

own lives for a juicy front-page death.

I decided my report would consist of two

words: "All bullshit".

BUCKY

Oh Jesus.

KAY

It's sick and it's insane! After

everything...And all that might happen--

LEE

I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent

a room for the stuff but--

(noticing Bucky)

You tell her Bucky. Reason with her.

BUCKY

She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least

three misdemeanors here. It's out of

control--

BUCKY (cont'd)

(to Kay)

I promised him a week on it. Four more

days and it's over.

KAY

Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.

BUCKY

Slumming, Miss Sprague?

MADELEINE

I am now. Daddy spying on me again?

MADELEINE (cont'd)

Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin'

in such unsuitable places--

BUCKY

I'm a policeman.

MADELEINE

Well that's a new one--

BUCKY

Homicide.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Here or downtown? I know you knew her so

don't jerk me off on that or it's

downtown and a whole lot of publicity.

MADELEINE

(gathering herself)

This is all a fluke. I met them at

LaVerne's last fall.

Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple.

She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal

off a sister.

BUCKY

You sleep with either of them?

MADELEINE

No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat.

BUCKY

Are you lez?

MADELEINE

(Scotchman's burr)

Ye might say I take it where I can find

it, laddie.

BUCKY

Why'd you rabbit last night?

MADELEINE

(exasperated)

Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The

Emmett Sprague. He built half of

Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he

didn't build he bought. Imagine the

headlines. "Tycoon's Daughter Questioned

in Black Dahlia Case--Played Footsie with

Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub". Get the

picture?

BUCKY

In Technicolor. (beat) What did you talk

about?

MADELEINE

Linda talked about her boring boy back in

Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty

talked about the latest issue of Screen

World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine

yards.

BUCKY

Betty ever tell you about a movie she

did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything

specific?

MADELEINE

On a conversational level they were right

down there with you, only they were

better looking.

BUCKY

You're cute.

MADELEINE

You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to

hear my alibi so I can end this farce and

go home?

BUCKY

That's all anyone ever wants to

volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead.

MADELEINE

My family and I were at our house in

Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along

with our live-in servants. If you want

verification, call Daddy. But be discreet

about where we met.

MADELEINE (cont'd)

Don't suppose I can convince you to keep

my name out of the papers?

BUCKY

I don't need your cash if that's what

you're saying.

MADELEINE

Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying...

BUCKY

Convince me.

MADELEINE

Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address

is 482 So. Muirfield.

BUCKY

I know the address.

MADELEINE

Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a

gentleman.

MADELEINE (cont'd)

One more thing--What's your name?

BUCKY

Bucky Bleichert.

MADELEINE

I'll try to remember.

LEE

Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and

Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red

Manley. Yes that would be more

efficient...

LEE (cont'd)

I love tip duty.

BUCKY

So...You smooth things with Kay?

LEE

Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at

the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week.

Chump change if it makes her feel good.

BUCKY

De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was

thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get

Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--

BUCKY (cont'd)

Lee--

LEE

Blanchard. Homicide.

BUCKY

Bleichert. Homicide.

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

I logged forty-six phone tips, about half

of which were reasonably coherent. Lee

left early, dodging any talk about De

Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up

the summary report, most of which

concerned the numerous dead end leads,

bogus confessions and three hundred new

Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut

certain of one thing:

CUT TO:

MAN #2 (O.S.)

Where are you from?

ELIZABETH SHORT

Boston. Massachusetts.

MAN #2

How long have you lived here?

ELIZABETH SHORT

Two years.

MAN #2

You've lost your accent.

ELIZABETH SHORT

Well, you know, when in Rome...

(looks nervously into camera)

Why? Do you want a girl with an accent?

MADELEINE

Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has

heard about you. He insisted you stay for

dinner. I told him we met at that art

exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if

you have to pump everybody for my alibi,

be subtle. All right?

BUCKY

Sure.

MADELEINE

(re the dog)

That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times

for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in

the paper when Daddy's accountant told

him he'd made his first million. Daddy

wanted to consecrate the moment so he

shot him. Here we go--

MADELEINE

Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.

My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My

father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha

McConville Sprague.

BUCKY

A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the

pants off him. Another Billy Conn you

were.

BUCKY

Thanks.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Mondo gave a good show. What ever

happened to him?

BUCKY

Died of a heroin overdose.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat)

Speaking of families--

RAMONA

(trace of a slur)

Madeleine says nice things about you.

MADELEINE

Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to

catch a nine-thirty show.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty

people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates.

MARTHA

I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

You're in for a cruel caricaturing,

Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but

Martha's my certified genius.

EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)

What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch?

BUCKY

German.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a

bit excessive, but mark my words that

someday we'll regret not joining forces

with him to fight the Reds. I killed a

lot of your countrymen during the war.

MARTHA

Did you meet Balto out in the hallway?

BUCKY

Very realistic.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

An old friend stuffed him. We were in the

Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden.

He wanted to work in the flickers.

BUCKY

So when did you come here?

EMMETT SPRAGUE

1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but

the silent flickers was booming. Georgie

got work as a lighting man, and me

building houses.

Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett

and I helped him build that housing

project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--

underneath that godawful sign.

BUCKY

I always loved the Keystone Kops.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar

dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting

as laborers and vice versa. I used to

drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after

twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker

and put in another six hours by

torchlight. Even gave me as assistant

director credit a couple times, so

grateful he was for the way I squeezed

his slaves--

EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)

Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you

like to contribute to the conversation?

RAMONA

Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona

Boulevard was named after me?

BUCKY

No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.

RAMONA

When Emmett married me for my father's

money he promised my family that he would

use his influence with the City Zoning

Board to have a street named after me.

But all he could manage was a dead-end

block in a red light district in Lincoln

Heights. Are you familiar with the

neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?

BUCKY

I grew up there.

RAMONA

Then you know that the Mexican

prostitutes expose themselves out of

windows to attract customers. I hear many

of them know Mr. Sprague by name--

RAMONA (cont'd)

I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron

comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's

male whores. A common policeman. My God,

Emmett. How little you think of me.

MADELEINE

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

MARTHA

(cheery)

Mr. Bleichert?

CUT TO:

MADELEINE

I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family--

don't--they're not so bad--

BUCKY

Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.

BUCKY

Well. I think you kept your name out of

the papers.

MADELEINE

Until we announce the wedding?

BUCKY

Your mother would love that.

MADELEINE

She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the

doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead.

You know how Daddy really made his money?

BUCKY

How?

MADELEINE

He bought rotten lumber and abandoned

movie facades from Mack Sennett and built

houses out of them. He's got firetraps

all over LA registered to phony

corporations...His "good friend" George?

Disfigured in a car crash while running

Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him

scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental

property--

BUCKY

You don't have to tell me this--

MADELEINE

I want to. I like you Bucky.

BUCKY

I like you, too.

MADELEINE

Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty

Short.

BUCKY

Jesus--

MADELEINE

Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just

don't want to lie to you.

BUCKY

What is it?

MADELEINE

Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.

Straight bars. I heard about a girl who

looked like me. I got curious and left

notes at a couple places: "Your lookalike

wants to meet you", things like that. I

left my number. She called. That's how I

met her at LaVerne's with Linda.

BUCKY

And that's all of it?

MADELEINE

Yes. That's all of it.

BUCKY

Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty

cops out there combing every bar in town

looking for Dahlia info. You could be

headed for the papers no matter what.

MADELEINE

Serve my family right.

BUCKY

You don't mean that.

MADELEINE

No. I don't.

BUCKY

Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet

Betty Short?

MADELEINE

I've worked pretty hard to be loose and

free. But the way people described Betty.

It sounded like she was a natural.

BUCKY

How do you mean?

MADELEINE

Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from

nothing...But then she carried nothing

with her, either. I don't know...when

you're rich sometimes you romanticize the

poor...

BUCKY

I wouldn't know.

LINDA MARTIN

I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch

me without a matron present I'll sue you!

LINDA MARTIN

(near tears)

Please, mister...My...my parents.

RUSS MILLARD

...and you don't recall any of the names

Betty went out with last fall?

LINDA MARTIN

They were just pickups.

RUSS MILLARD

No one who would do her harm?

BUCKY

You made the casting rounds together.

Ever get any movie work?

LINDA MARTIN

No.

BUCKY

So what about the film can?

LINDA MARTIN

It's...a movie.

BUCKY

A dirty movie?

RUSS MILLARD

You have to tell us the whole thing,

sweetheart. So think it through.

LINDA MARTIN

I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This

Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something

- starting talking to me.

I thought I was pregnant, and I was

desperate wicked bad for money. He said

he'd give me two hundred dollars to act

in a nudie film.

LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)

He said he needed another girl so I asked

Betty. The three of us drove down to

Tijuana and we made the movie at this big

house outside of town. (beat) Then he

drove us back to LA.

BUCKY

Was this around Thanksgiving?

BUCKY (cont'd)

Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder?

BUCKY (cont'd)

Did he seem particularly interested in

Betty? Did she see him again?

BUCKY (cont'd)

But you saw him again, didn't you? How

else could you have gotten a copy?

LINDA MARTIN

After Betty...After I read about

Betty...I went looking for him in

Gardena. He was about to go back to

Mexico and I conned him out of a print.

RUSS MILLARD

Where was that?

LINDA MARTIN

I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere.

RUSS MILLARD

Why would you do that?

LINDA MARTIN

A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I

could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It

was...a collector's item.

RUSS MILLARD

And he willingly gave you a copy of the

film? For nothing?

LINDA MARTIN

No. Not for nothing.

LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)

You'll let me have it back, won't you?

You won't let people look at it?

RUSS MILLARD

Whattya think?

BUCKY

I think she's covering on the Mex angle.

Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him

taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The

TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg

Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play

cellmate for a day.

RUSS MILLARD

Bleichert you are a very bright penny

today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue

movie night at City Hall.

LEE

(raggedy)

Gettin' any?

CHIEF HORRALL

Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to

do with the girl's murder--

RUSS MILLARD

Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed

down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play

as the killer. But maybe he showed it to

someone--

LEE

Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her!

I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room

for less than this!

LEE

Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

BUCKY

Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

ELLIS LOEW

Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants.

You're my man, and you made me look like

a fool in front of the two most powerful

men in the Department. If you weren't

Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty

already. You've gotten personally

involved in the Short case--

BUCKY

(holding up the newspaper)

Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--

ELLIS LOEW

Shut up, Bleichert.

(back to Lee)

You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow.

Report to me at 0800 with letters of

apology for Green and Horrall. For the

sake of your pension I'd suggest you

grovel.

LEE

I want to go to TJ--

ELLIS LOEW

Blanchard!

ELLIS LOEW

You've been skating around all morning,

Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to

Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to

check out a radio car and get out there.

BUCKY

Yes, sir.

ELLIS LOEW

And if you see that phantom partner of

yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost

him three days pay.

MADELEINE (VO)

Hello.

BUCKY

It's me. You want to get together?

MADELEINE (VO)

When?

BUCKY

I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes.

MADELEINE (VO)

Not at the house. Daddy's having a

business soiree. The Red Arrow.

BUCKY

I have an apartment, you know.

MADELEINE (VO)

Room 11. Forty-five minutes.

MADELEINE

Smile at me. Look soft and sweet.

BUCK

They picked up Linda Martin yesterday.

She had a stag film of her and Betty

Short playing lez. Spooky stuff.

MADELEINE

Did she mention me?

BUCKY

No. And I checked through the case file.

There's no mention of that note-leaving

number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm

withholding evidence for you. It's a fair

trade for what I'm getting, but it still

shakes me. Is there anything you haven't

told me about Betty and Linda?

MADELEINE

Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that

one time we met last summer. I just did

it to see what it would be like to do it

with someone who looked like me and--

BUCKY

Jesus Christ.

MADELEINE

Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay--

MADELEINE (cont'd)

Stay sugar stay--

RADIO DISPATCHER

Code four all units at Crenshaw and

Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond

Douglas Nash, warrant number--

BUCKY

Blanchard!

LEE

I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

BUCKY

Not good enough.

VOICE OVER

Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard

fight got me local celebrity, Warrants,

and close to nine grand in cash;

winning the rematch got me a sprained

wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the

rest of the day off. Whoever said winning

isn't everything got that part right.

KAY

(eyes red from crying)

We're famous, Dwight.

BUCKY

Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?

KAY

I haven't seen him since you beat him up.

KAY (cont'd)

I don't blame you.

BUCKY

He's in trouble, you know.

BUCKY (cont'd)

De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee

doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over

to stay with you.

KAY

I don't want you coming over here just to

sleep an the couch again.

BUCKY

Kay. Lee--

KAY

You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To

most people--that's the scary stuff. Not

everything else.

KAY (cont'd)

Luck.

BUCKY

Short of winning?

KAY

Luck.

BUCKY

Thank you very much.

BUCKY (cont'd)

What happened in TJ?

HARRY SEARS

Checked for the smut pad. Goose egg.

Peddlers--double goose egg--

RUSS MILLARD

Bucky. Blanchard's in Tijuana. A border

cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch

of rough-looking Rurales last night.

RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)

What is it?

BUCKY

(re his phone call)

That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt

bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa

depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer

Tijuana.

VOICE OVER

Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her

"Mex" was actually a local named Walter

Wellington, who copped to making the film

but quickly provided the cops his alibi

for the Dahlia's missing days.

VOICE OVER

Not that this stopped Loew and his boys

from rousting spics all over town for a

possible Dahlia frame-up. The circus was

becoming a farce.

ELLIS LOEW

We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney

he made the pic--

ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)

Bleichert.

BUCKY

Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt.

ELLIS LOEW

Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended.

VOGEL

You know what, kid? I got a soft spot in

my heart for light heavyweights.

(chucks his chin)

You promise not to hit Billy and I'll

help you look for your partner.

(re Bucky's ragged appearance)

I'll drive. You look like shit.

CUT TO:

DEWITT

Cops, huh? Well at least you're American.

Never thought I'l be glad to see you

guys.

VOGEL

Why start now?

CUT TO:

VOGEL

Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came

here flush out of Big Q. That's a

goddamned strange coincidence and I don't

like it. I don't like you and I don't

like being down in this rat-infested

country when I could be home with my

family.

VOGEL (cont'd)

Did you know Blanchard was in TJ?

DEWITT

Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin'

trial.

VOGEL

Do not use profanity with me, and address

me as sir.

VOGEL (cont'd)

Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why?

DEWITT

Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee

beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of

how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I

know is what I read in the papers. Maybe

I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin'

trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty

killed them niggers--

VOGEL

Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant

Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and

I will not have syphilitic scum like you

defaming him. Now you risked a parole

violation for a trip down here.

VOGEL (cont'd)

Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me.

DEWITT

(a beaten dog)

I came down to cop some heroin and move

it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix

Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please.

Don't hurt me no more. Please.

VOGEL

(heading out of the cell)

I'm gonna call Ellis.

BUCKY

Finish up with you and Blanchard.

DEWITT

Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard

is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake--

BUCKY

How long--

VOGEL

I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him

to his pal. But he blew his tail while

you were catching up on your beauty

sleep, which is too bad for him.

CUT TO:

VOGEL

The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope

trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum,

maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let

our Mexican colleagues handle their own

dirty laundry and we go back to LA and

find the son of a bitch who sliced the

Dahlia.

KAY

I spent the morning with Internal

Affairs. I told them...everything I knew.

I gave them so much...and in the end it

didn't seem like anything at all.

BUCKY

He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it.

KAY

You don't know anything, Dwight. But

that's what I like about you.

BUCKY

Kay--

KAY

I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth

grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone

now--

BUCKY

He's coming back.

CUT TO:

BUCKY

Lee.

DISSOLVE TO:

AGENT

...okay, yeah. So I got her name from a

producer friend of mine. Met her in a

bar...

VOICE OVER

I wanted to believe it was all about Lee.

Tracking Lee through her...through the

files he had collected.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

Strangers' recollections of a girl's last

days leading me to a partner...

DISSOLVE TO:

HOOKER

...the other girls and me, we helped her

out once in a while. Throw her a trick if

she needed dough...But she was no pro.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

But the deeper into her I got, the more I

understood the detective's old saw: any

dick worth his suit always takes a side:

the perp or the vic.

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

Most cops'll tell ya...one day you wake

up and you're in the head of the

killer...Angry. Powerful. In control.

You're the perp.

DISSOLVE TO:

BETTY SHORT

No...Please...

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

Few cops'll admit to walking the harder

path...fear...pain...loss...Few will

admit to waking up in the head of the

vic.

ELIZABETH SHORT

(reading stiffly)

Don't just walk out on me, Richard. Say

something. Say you care say you--

MAN #3 (O.S.)

I'm sorry. There's a pause there.

MAN #3 (cont'd)

Maybe with a little more sadness. Can you

give me a little more sadness?

BUCKY

I wasn't on the transfer list.

RUSS MILLARD

I asked Jack to keep you on.

BUCKY

Why?

RUSS MILLARD

Because you're getting to be a damn good

Detective, Bleichert. And Harry's

retiring in two years. Need I spell it

out?

BUCKY

No.

RUSS MILLARD

You been working this case pretty hard.

Or is it the other way around?

RUSS MILLARD

It's not as much fun once it moves to the

back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I

hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez

for the Bobby De Witt murder.

BUCKY

I heard that, too.

RUSS MILLARD

You must be relieved.

BUCKY

They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he

doesn't show up in thirty days he's out.

RUSS MILLARD

He'll be found if he wants to be found.

BUCKY

Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?

VOGEL

Boyo! Glad you could make it.

ELLIS LOEW

I called this little meeting for a couple

reasons, Bucky.

We'd both like to see the Short case

closed out and get back to normal

business.

ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)

We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants

you for his partner when he gets his

lieutenancy, and--

BUCKY

Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.

VOGEL

You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is

a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

BUCKY

What do you want, Ellis?

ELLIS LOEW

Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There

are four confessors still being held at

City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't

coherent when they were first questioned,

and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-

mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.

It's a muscle job.

VOGEL

I wanted Bill Koenig--

ELLIS LOEW

But Bill's a bit too enamored with

violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no?

Because if it's yes, I'll make sure

you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an

inside track to some stripes. If not,

it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard

gets tired of you. We both know that Russ

is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight.

That could be a long time. Yes or no?

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

On my way over I played out their rap

sheets in my head, trying to work up a

head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time

Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated

sexual assault on minors. Between prison

jolts he confessed to all the big sex

crimes.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and

a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums

with some good combos. He took two

Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught

masturbating at the scene of his last

torch.

VOICE OVER

Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career

confessor specializing in copping to

hooker homicides. His three procuring

beefs had netted him a year county jail

time, his phony confessions two ninety

day observation stints at the Camarillo

nut farm.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller,

male prostitute, and a former San

Bernardino County deputy sheriff.

VOGEL

You all confessed to killing the Dahlia.

We can't prove you did, so you're gonna

have to convince us... Query on, Bucko.

BUCKY

Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd

you kill her?

VOGEL

Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made

little boys suck his hog.

BUCKY

Come clean, pop.

BIDWELL

I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a

ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and

a cot, that's all. Please, mister.

BUCKY

Tell me about it, Cecil.

DURKIN

(laughing)

You get that line from Dick Tracy or

Gangbusters?

BUCKY

One more time, shitbird. Tell me about

you and Betty Short.

DURKIN

I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your

mama! I'm your fucking daddy!

DURKIN (cont'd)

You think you clever, don't you. You the

bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older

than vaudeville.

BUCKY

I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in

mind.

ISSLER

(sincere)

Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know

why I do these things, and I apologize.

So please don't let that man hurt me.

BUCKY

Convince me.

ISSLER

I...can't. I just can't.

BUCKY

You're a pimp. You know Betty Short?

ISSLER

No.

BUCKY

Why'd you confess to her murder?

ISSLER

She looked so...sweet and pretty and I

felt so bad. I always confess to the

pretty ones.

BUCKY

You feel guilty Charlie? You hit your

girls, get 'em high on hop?

ISSLER

I do such nasty things I don't know why--

VOGEL

This kid glove routine's gettin' old--

VOGEL (cont'd)

Jack roller! Nigger! Baby fucker!

VOGEL (cont'd)

Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days

you whoremonger! Tell me!

ISSLER

I...don't...know...anything!

VOGEL

Tell me what you know!

ISSLER

I knew you at Ad Vice!

VOGEL

Tell me what your girls tell you!

VOGEL (cont'd)

For your cutting pleasure, Jane Doe

number forty-three. You're all going to

slice her, and the best slicer buys the

ticket!

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.

Blood banks, liquor stores selling half

pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty-

cent-a-night flophouses and derelict

missions...

VOICE OVER

Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to

try my word against a twenty-two year man

and the city's future District Attorney.

I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and

determined to spend my shifts trying to

be the worst foot hack in history.

VOICE OVER

A month passed. The Dahlia leads dwindled

to zero and every officer except Russ and

Harry were returned to their regular

assignments. As for me, I'd been able to

contain my Dahlia interests within the

walls of the El Nido.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Still, I remembered what Madeleine said

when I told her we were through...

MADELEINE

You'll be back. (beat) I look like her.

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

But sometimes Betty came to me...

BETTY SHORT

Bucky! No! Stop him!

(crying)

I'll do whatever you want...

ISSLER

I'll be okay....Liz...

MILLARD (VO)

Bucky. What is it?

RUSS MILLARD

Bucky.

BUCKY

You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as

Liz? Anyone at all?

RUSS MILLARD

Nope.

BUCKY

Issler did.

RUSS MILLARD

The pimp? I thought he said he'd never

heard of her.

BUCKY

You know what else he said?

VOGEL

What did you know about the Dahlia's

missing days?

ISSLER

I knew you at Ad Vice--

HARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE)

N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone.

BUCKY

Fritzie didn't give a damn about those

other three. It was all about Issler.

Never occurred to me before.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Meet me back here. Late.

RUSS MILLARD

Bright penny--

BUCKY

Hello, Charlie. Get lost?

RUSS MILLARD

So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down

crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before

a roust.

BUCKY

I want him nailed.

RUSS MILLARD

Easy, penny. They'd have to testify

against him first. And that's not likely

after he burns those carbons. But this

Issler business--why hide the Issler-

Betty connection?

BUCKY

(finding a file)

Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to

somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know

about...

FRITZIE

Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's

missing days--

BUCKY

I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of

her phantom servicemen boyfriends:

(reading aloud)

"...had drinks with a great girl, Sally

Stinson, who thinks she way be able to

help me get a job cocktailing..."

RUSS MILLARD

Cocktailing.

BUCKY

Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick

with me...What next, padre?

RUSS MILLARD

You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me

and Harry'll poke around.

BUCKY

(displeased)

I want him.

RUSS MILLARD

You'll get him, too. But you've got to

cool your temper. It's all patience with

the big fish or they wriggle off.

VOICE OVER

What kept me up that night wasn't the

idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals,

or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp

to see if Betty had told him something

about one of her johns...maybe even

Vogel, himself...No...

VOICE OVER

...what kept me up was this thought: if

Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I

would have overheard. Fritz was confident

he could keep me quiet.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

And that was an underestimation I would

bleed him for.

BUCKY (VO)

Hello?

RUSS MILLARD

We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North

Havenhurst in half an hour.

SALLY

I do a lot a cops, you know. Comes with

the territory. Charlie used to say it was

my union dues. Keep my operator's license.

BUCK

Ma'am. Please get to it.

SALLY

Anyway. It was a full-day job. C-Note and

a half. Kept talkin' about givin' me "The

Big Schnitzel"...more like a cocktail

frank once we got down to it...Well, we

screw the whole afternoon...Go down to

the lobby for some dinner and there's

Liz, sittin' by herself.

BUCKY

You'd hooked with her before?

SALLY

Three or four times. Conventioneers. And

lemme tell you something, I'm pretty good

at faking it. But Liz, she was good. A

virtuoso, Academy Award kind of stuff--

BUCKY

--She do dyke?

RUSS MILLARD

Bucky--

SALLY

No. Nothing like that.

BUCKY

Any porn?

SALLY

No. But I bet she'd be gooood...

RUSS MILLARD

Ma'am.

SALLY (cont'd)

Anyway, we all get to talking...Schnitzel

takes a liking to her and Liz tells me

she needs the dough. So I set up a trick

within a trick...I take a breather and

they go at it in the bedroom. A couple

hours later Liz left.

BUCKY

Did anything unusual happen?

SALLY

I think it got a little kinky. He'd

brought a couple toys...He may

have...whipped her a bit.

BUCKY

Did Vogel say anything about Liz? Was he

gonna see her again? Anything?

SALLY

He said...she liked the Big Schnitzel.

RUSS MILLARD

Anything else, Miss Stinson?

SALLY

Two days...after...Liz got in all the

papers...

BUCKY

(helping her out)

Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses?

SALLY

(composing herself)

Yeah. Bad habit. Anyways, Fritzie V.

shows up and shakes me hard about

Charlie, whether he'd say anything about

Liz to the caps. Beat me bad. Real bad.

BUCKY

One last time to be sure.

(pointing to Fritzie's picture)

You are sure this is the man that you

tricked with? And tricked with Liz Short?

SALLY

No mister you got it all wrong.

BUCKY

But you said--

SALLY

Fritz just beat me. It was Sonny me and

Liz did. Sonny.

SALLY (cont'd)

I'd recognize that lousy fuck anywhere.

RUSS MILLARD

What's your name, son?

JOHNNY

(slurring)

You know me, loot.

RUSS MILLARD

Answer me anyway.

JOHNNY

Vogel, John G.

RUSS MILLARD

What's sixteen and fifty-two?

JOHNNY

Uhmmm. Sixty-eight. Why'd you hit me

Bleichert? I didn't do you no dirt.

RUSS MILLARD

Focus on January, Johnny. Your father--

JOHNNY

Friedrich Vogel. Fritzie.

RUSS MILLARD

Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your

cherry. He bought you a woman for two

days. Is that right?

JOHNNY

Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer.

RUSS MILLARD

This was at the Biltmore?

JOHNNY

Daddy got a good rate on the room. He

knew the house dick...This ain't right...

RUSS MILLARD

We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz

Short at the Biltmore, too?

JOHNNY

What's her name introduced me...the

hooer.

RUSS MILLARD

And what did you and Liz do?

JOHNNY

We...played horse and rider. Gave her the

Big Schnitz.

RUSS MILLARD

Did you whip her?

JOHNNY

Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider.

RUSS MILLARD

Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?

JOHNNY

No no no no! I didn't kill her!

RUSS MILLARD

Easy son--

JOHNNY

I didn't slice her!

RUSS MILLARD

It's all right...Do you know who did?

JOHNNY

No! No!

RUSS MILLARD

When your Daddy found out you'd been with

her, he tried to fix things didn't he?

RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)

He found out Charlie Issler had been

picked up and he knew Charlie had this

confessing problem, right?

JOHNNY

Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy.

Wanted to get Charlie released...but the

Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue

friend owed him a favor and got this DOA

cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis

Jewboy said take Bleichert.

(looking right at Bucky)

Daddy said you'd do it cuz without

Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a

sob sister, weak sister...

RUSS MILLARD

(to Bucky)

I think you should go outside.

RUSS MILLARD

His statement. Signed.

RUSS MILLARD

We should sit on this for a little bit.

Until I can talk to a legal officer.

JOHNNY

Daddy...

RUSS MILLARD

(to Bucky)

It's the shithouse until you retire, you

know that.

BUCKY

I owe her this one.

BUCKY

No comment...No comment...

(whispering in Johnny's ear)

Tell your Daddy I know everything.

Including his extortion deal. Tell him

I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow.

DESK SERGEANT

What the hell is this?

BUCKY

I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is

Officer John Vogel.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Book him.

INTERCOM

Officer Bleichert, go to the watch

commander's office immediately.

JASTROW

You're on two weeks vacation leave as of

now. When you return to duty, report to

Chief Green. He'll reassign you to

another division.

BUCKY

Why?

JASTROW

Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out.

That's why.

MAN #4 (O.S.)

Are you all right, Miss Short?

MAN #4 (cont'd)

Why don't you just...talk.

ELIZABETH SHORT

What do you mean?

MAN #4

Put the sides down. Just...talk to me.

ELIZABETH SHORT

What would you like to talk about?

MAN #4

I don't know...Anything...Do you have a

boyfriend?

KAY

I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to

Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San

Francisco...

BUCKY

Kay.

FAY

You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know

you won't believe me. But you've more

than repaid him already.

KAY (cont'd)

When?

BUCKY

First thing.

KAY

You're a fool, Dwight.

VOICE OVER

I closed out my glory days the only way I

knew how--I chased the gone man.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and

a strange series of tales that rang true.

One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the

shit out of three jack rollers, then

buying off the cops with double-saws

peeled from a large roll.

Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a

leper ministry priest and then driving to

Ensenada.

VOICE OVER

I decided it would be wise to check in

with the law before going out to question

the Ensenada citizenry.

CAPTAIN VASQUEZ

Officer Bleichert. Come in, please. I'm

Captain Vasquez. How can I help you?

BUCKY

This man's LAPD. He's been missing in

Mexico since January. He was last seen

headed here.

CAPTAIN VASQUEZ

No. I'm afraid not. I'll ask my men,

however. Staying the night?

BUCKY

At least.

VASQUEZ

Are you here alone?

BUCKY

I have two partners waiting for me in

Tijuana.

BUCKY (cont'd)

If you don't mind I'll check back in the

morning.

CAPTAIN VASQUEZ

Please.

OLD MAN

Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then

Is he still in town?

OLD MAN

Don't think so. I own this place. He

ain't been back. You lookin' for a

BUCKY

I'm looking to get him out of a shitload

of trouble.

OLD MAN

Well. I'll tell ya the little I know.

Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club

Satan, had to bribe his way out big with

Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook.

Tell him I said to be kosher with you.

BUCKY

Thank you.

You ain't been in there.

You his friend?

BUCKY

He's my best friend.

ERNIE

Your friend drink fourteen shots of my

best Mescal, a house record. That I like.

He make toasts to dead women. That I don't

mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey

show, and that I don't take.

BUCKY

What happened?

ERNIE

Four of my guys he take, the fifth he

don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it

off.

BUCKY

That's it?

ERNIE

Finito.

MAN

Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend--

MAN (cont'd)

Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and

a licensed private dick. I got seventy

bucks in there but that money's jackshit

compared to what Blanchard was holding.

You go partners with me and it's easy

street--

BUCKY

You tell me all of it and you watch what

you say about my partner, or it's a B&E

roust and the Ensenada jail.

DOLPHINE

You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew

to follow you? He's got a vested interest

in you not finding out about Blanchard.

BUCKY

Does he know I'm staying here?

DOLPHINE

No.

BUCKY

So. Let's hear it.

DOLPHINE

About a month ago this Mexican woman

shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby,

ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the

nines. Offers me five hundred to find

Blanchard. Just like you I track him here

where he's playing the rich gringo--

DOLPHINE

I even see him beat up two spics who

insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by

and do nothing. So I know he's paying

protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I

hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale

to snuff a coupla guys in TJ--

DOLPHINE

I leave a message in Dago for the woman

tellin' her what I know...

BUCKY

What's her name?

DOLPHINE

Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a

phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos

and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge

on Blanchard for offin' Felix.

BUCKY

Go on.

DOLPHINE

I come back to Ensenada on my own,

thinking about all that cash he was

flashing.

DOLPHINE (cont'd)

You wanna hear this?

BUCKY

Go on.

DOLPHINE

Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza.

(beat) Rumor is they never found any

money.

DOLPHINE (cont'd)

Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or

friends of hers. Who knows? I figured

Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like

you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a

line on where the cash was. You knew

Blanchard, maybe we can--

DOLPHINE (cont'd)

Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't

hit me again--

BUCKY

Prove it to me. Prove it!

DOLPHINE

The locals keep the damn thing lit up.

They got a lotta missing relatives.

BUCKY

You got a shovel?

DOLPHINE

Gardening tools--

BUCKY

Good enough.

DOLPHINE

Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.

CUT TO:

DOLPHINE

Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because

their shack job was against department

regs, but because the ghosts of their

past had forced them to choose between

love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy

tale" only a band-aid for a fractured

life.

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE OVER

Our true vows were made in private; bury

the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay

said, "bury that fucking girl"...

DETECTIVE

Bleichert? You got those prints for me?

DETECTIVE (cont'd)

Thanks. We gotta hot one I think.

ANNOUNCER

...results in the 1948 Republican primary

are final...John Dougdale trouncing D.A.

Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county

primaries...

KAY

That reminds me of something, Dwight.

BUCKY

What?

KAY

Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think

you could fix it?

BUCKY

(relieved)

Sure, babe.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Hello...Hey Vic...

BUCKY (cont'd)

Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot

suicide.

KAY

Sounds lovely. Where is it?

BUCKY

Hancock Park.

WOMAN

Yes?

BUCKY

I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express

my condolences, Mrs.--

WOMAN

Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.

You're the lab man?

JANE CHAMBERS

It's the study in back of the dining

room. You'll see the police rope. If

you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.

CUT TO:

JANE CHAMBERS

The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?

BUCKY

Like their mother. How old are they?

JANE CHAMBERS

Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you

finished in the study?

BUCKY

Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use

pure ammonia...

(looking at the two girls)

Mrs. Chambers--

JANE CHAMBERS

Jane.

BUCKY

Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha

Sprague? The next block over?

JANE CHAMBERS

(snorts)

Those girls and that family. How do you

know them?

BUCKY

I did a little work for them once.

JANE CHAMBERS

Consider it lucky if it was a brief

encounter.

BUCKY

How do you mean?

JANE CHAMBERS

Back to condolences. Thank you for being

so nice, Mr.--

BUCKY

Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

JANE CHAMBERS

Good-bye.

VIC

You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?

BUCKY

Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about

the husband?

VIC

Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was

depressed, failing health. The terrible

burden of all that money'll get you every

time.

BUCKY

Wonder how he made it?

VIC

No mystery there. Real estate.

BUCKY

Oh really?

ELIZABETH SHORT

...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand.

He was in a tank battalion. A Commander.

He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the

deep water you see from a fishing boat...

KAY

(getting out)

What're you doing?

BUCKY

I'm...looking for the hammer.

KAY

Dwight?

KAY (cont'd)

Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it.

BUCKY

Were you ever going to tell me?

KAY

He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel.

(beat) He wanted to give me a home.

LEE

...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if

I'd take two dives for him. I said no...

BUCKY

Were you ever going to tell me?

KAY

He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How

he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to

his friends...

KAY

...Bobby know nothing about the bank job.

He and Lee, they never even met. After

Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured

framing Bobby'd give me a way out...

KAY

Then last year...the fourth man--the

driver--he heard Bobby was getting

paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt

that Lee framed him. He wanted money we

didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.

BUCKY

Ever. Were you ever...?

KAY

Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.

Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't

matter anymore. Not to us.

BUCKY

Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell

me!

KAY

Baxter Fitch.

BAXTER FITCH

Blanchard?

KAY (cont'd)

He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him

everything else. But don't forgive him

for that. Ever.

VOICE OVER

Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.

Bank robber and his best friend the

bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge.

Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I

thought I'd forgive Kay her role in

keeping it from me. But the basic rule of

Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried

forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays

buried forever. Nothing.

JANE CHAMBERS

So. What brings you around again?

Considering a courtin' the old rich

widow?

BUCKY

You're not that old. And you're not very

widowed.

JANE CHAMBERS

You either are or you aren't.

BUCKY

You seem to be doing all right.

JANE CHAMBERS

Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.

We weren't that close anymore...You married?

BUCKY

Little over a year.

JANE CHAMBERS

God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?

JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)

Sorry.

BUCKY

So how well do you know the Spragues?

JANE CHAMBERS

Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They

served on the California real estate

board together. But Emmett was a bit of a

crook. My husband got him kicked off the

board for building dangerous buildings

under phony corporations.

BUCKY

Your husband sounds like a good man.

JANE CHAMBERS

He had his moments. Most of it was out of

guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.

When he learned he had cancer, he really

started feeling guilty. He voted

Democratic last year. Even went in and

had meetings with the City Council. I'm

sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

BUCKY

I read an article in the paper.

JANE CHAMBERS

Same day Eldridge killed himself.

Apropos, I guess.

BUCKY

Maybe your husband--

JANE CHAMBERS

My husband was rich and did a mean

Charleston. I loved him until I found out

he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting

to love him again. How strange.

BUCKY

It's not so strange.

JANE CHAMBERS

You're very accepting of other people's

frailties. You're young. You should have

illusions.

BUCKY

I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard

issue.

JANE CHAMBERS

So how'd a cop get mixed up with

Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I

assume?

BUCKY

I stopped her at a red light. One thing

led to another. Why do you assume it was

Madeleine?

JANE CHAMBERS

Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a

roundheels. Always has been.

BUCKY

Jane. Don't be catty.

JANE CHAMBERS

I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.

She probably inherited it from her

mother.

JANE CHAMBERS

You figure out the rest, officer.

BUCKY

God that is spooky.

JANE CHAMBERS

Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my

birthday a couple years ago. I hate it.

Want to take it with you?

BUCKY

No thanks.

JANE CHAMBERS

Thank you, then. You were my best

condoler.

BUCKY

And you mine.

KAY

Dwight--

KAY (cont'd)

Dwight--

THAD GREEN

SID's not a bad beat, Bucky. At the time

it was better than you deserved.

THAD GREEN (cont'd)

The blues hate you, Bucky. Vogel was

their pal. I do this for you, you better

be fucking supercop.

VOICE OVER

Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks

carried metal-studded saps; squadroom

dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with

unregulation dum-dums.

VOICE OVER

Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For one

month I escaped them all.

VOICE OVER

A fucking supercop.

VOICE OVER

I escaped them all. Almost.

OLD DRUNK

Pleease!

BUCKY

It's me.

VOICE OVER

It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old

rutters who knew they'd never have it as

good with anyone else...

Afterwards we'd talk through the night.

The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...

VOICE OVER

Mostly, though we'd talk about Betty. Her

utter malleability, a chameleon eager to

please anybody...and the disrupter of

every life close to me...It would last a

month.

MADELEINE

What?

BUCKY

Nothing.

BUCKY (cont'd)

I thought the family came back from

Laguna this week.

MADELEINE

(her Scottish brogue)

You miss 'em, laddie? Mother's insults?

Martha's pornography...

BUCKY

Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories?

VOICE OVER

In the scheme of things it wasn't much.

Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

But combine it with banging Madeleine in

all twenty-two rooms of their mansion, it

was good enough for me.

BUCKY

(to the van driver)

Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!

KAY

I didn't touch your things. You can have

the furniture.

BUCKY

Babe--

KAY

Did you think I'd let my husband

disappear for three weeks and do nothing

about it? I've had detectives following

you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like

that fucking dead girl, so you can have

her--not me.

BUCKY

Babe. Goddammit.

KAY

Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.

VOICE OVER

It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye

Bleichert at the bus stop, adios

shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool

pigeon harness bull.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

You traded a good woman for skunk pussy,

you've turned everything that's been

handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your

"I will's" amount to the eighth round at

the Academy gym when you stepped into a

Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into

clover that you turned into horse dung.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were

a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't

meet before 39th and Norton, it just

might have worked. Maybe us would've been

the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up

past redemption...

GIRL

(Boston accent)

Can I help you? (no response). Great.

Take a hike you big sicko--

BUCKY

Wait--

CLEO SHORT

It's all right, dear. I know this pug.

CLEO SHORT

Came into a little change a while back,

managed to trade in that shit shack out

back for these digs. (beat) And I don't

give a fuck what you think, you and your

partner ain't much to look at now. I read

the papers.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

My youngest, Christine.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook

a damn, though.

Got her sister's star-eyes for the

pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's

gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield.

Get out of here, Chrissie...

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know.

Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to

snap a shot of the goddamn garage back

there. Thought maybe they'd find one of

Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals.

BUCKY

You didn't move far.

CLEO SHORT

Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat)

Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't

smart enough to solve the case, and you

ain't dumb enough to still think I did

it...I had an alibi.

BUCKY

Tighter'n a popcorn fart.

CLEO SHORT

And that's air tight, mug. Air tight.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha.

That's a plug nickel you can't spend,

ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that

to a fella. Especially someone like you.

(off Bucky's look)

Like I said, I know you mug.

BUCKY

I just thought...Maybe after all this

time...There's something you might have

forgot...Anything she might have said...

CLEO SHORT

She was a terrible actress. I'm sure

folks've told you that. She'd practice in

front of the john mirror.

Once or twice she got me in on

it...Reading parts with her for some

audition. She stunk. Even a parent could

tell. What Beth was good at was writing.

All her teachers used to say that. Not

that a grease like me'd know the

difference. Maybe she coulda written for

the pictures. But she wanted to be an

actress like every other silly girl.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Your folks still alive?

BUCKY

My father.

CLEO SHORT

(poking)

He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or

maybe he thought you'd end up champ?

CLEO SHORT

Your momma?

BUCKY

She killed herself a long time ago.

CLEO SHORT

Probably better off then.

BUCKY

Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--

CLEO SHORT

Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all

away. Dreamin'll kill ya.

(to Christine)

You, too. Get me a sandwich.

CLEO SHORT (cont'd)

Clean up some dog shit with this for me,

willya?

CUT TO:

VOICE OVER

I tried to keep calm. I told myself that

just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack

Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't

mean he had anything to do with a smut

film twenty-five years later.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Duke Wellington had admitted making it.

Linda Martin had said it was shot in

Mexico.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Mack Sennett? Helped him build that

housing project he was putting up--

Hollywoodland--

RUSS MILLARD

I got your message, Bucky.

BUCKY

Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--

RUSS MILLARD

It?

BUCKY

Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's

just...

RUSS MILLARD

Calm down, son. Tell me.

VOICE OVER

I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,

the Spragues. Withholding evidence for

her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of

it he only had one thing to say:

RUSS MILLARD

All right, then. It's your ball. What do

you wanna do?

BUCKY

I want to search every fucking inch of

every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague

property if it takes the rest of my

shitty career. And I know exactly where

we start.

VOICE OVER

Between my time with Madeleine and the

local boom baron expose in the papers, I

was practically an expert on Emmett

Sprague's land deals...

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

For the first time since the beginning of

the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to

figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.

Instead, I focused on where.

VOICE OVER

And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't

have to look any further than one of

Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One

that was isolated...abandoned...

VOICE OVER

...and most importantly, close to a water

source...where one could drain a body of

its blood.

RUSS MILLARD

Bucky.

RUSS MILLARD

God help her.

BUCKY

(throwing Russ gloves)

Box up the books and papers. Maybe light

that lantern.

RUSS MILLARD

You all right?

BUCKY

Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's

another set of latents up there on the

doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad

I can't transfer 'em.

CUT TO:

BUCKY

We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All

of her.

(gesturing around the room)

All right here.

RUSS MILLARD

Are you sure you don't want to came home?

Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch.

BUCKY

No. Thanks. I'll stay here.

(re the doorjamb piece)

I want to get up early and confirm these

prints.

RUSS MILLARD

You're a very very bright penny, Officer.

BUCKY (cont'd)

That night I pictured myself the way I

wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her

knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit

harness bull who cracked the biggest

unsolved homicide in California history.

A war hero, a heavyweight champion.

BUCKY (cont'd)

I stayed with her that night and dreamed

of all the bullshit that would never

happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at

all. Because there was no way for me to

make the arrest without admitting that

I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The

case would always be open.

And so while it killed me to wait 'til

morning, in some ways...this was our last

night together.

EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.)

...besides, one of my foremen said the

goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll

be hell to pay. It's about time I showed

the three of you good ol' Scotland.

MADELEINE

I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're

always talking about how dreadful and

provincial it is.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

...they've got what you need, lassie.

BUCKY

And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?

Direct line to the straight dope? Or is

that what you needed?

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Aaah, laddie.

BUCKY

George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and

the two of you covered it up.

BUCKY (cont'd)

(to Madeleine)

You helped Linda Martin and Betty make

that stag film. Where was the set? In one

of Daddy's old buildings?

MADELEINE

Georgie was always...sneaking around

Daddy's properties. He saw them make

it...He...got crazy about Betty.

BUCKY

Of course. She looked like his daughter.

BUCKY (cont'd)

He fucked your wife. But I don't think

you cared about that. But he's her daddy.

And that must have made you crazy. He was

a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't

think he was disfigured in a car wreck.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet

the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him,

it did. He was...hmm...disturbed. I think

Ramona found him...a good way to strike

back at me.

BUCKY

How'd it all go down?

BUCKY (cont'd)

So many pretty things here...

MADELEINE

It was Sunday I remember...Betty

called...short of cash as usual.

I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty

money to date a nice man he knew.

Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy,

wanting to get with Betty ever since the

movie. Threatening to tell people he was

my father. But we thought Georgie just

wanted her for sex.

BUCKY

He was a sick fuck and you knew it!

EMMETT SPRAGUE

He was passive. He liked to touch dead

things. His father was a surgeon, did you

know that? Famous in Scotland.

BUCKY

What did you tell Betty? What did you

tell her?

MADELEINE

We said he was a war hero. Because we

didn't want her to feel like a whore.

BUCKY

Then?

MADELEINE

You know the rest.

BUCKY

Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.

MADELEINE

I went looking for Linda Martin, and I

found her at a motel in the Valley. I

gave her money and told her to say the

stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican

crew.

BUCKY

And then what? I come along? Daddy tell

you to fuck me or was that your idea?

MADELEINE

Bucky--

BUCKY (cont'd)

The whole family have a good laugh at

dinner that night? Pumping me for info

about the case? Throwing me Georgie

stories to see if I'd bite? A little

hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't

check out your alibi--

MADELEINE

Bucky--

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Ramona didn't know a thing. Martha--

BUCKY

What about sweet little Martha?

MADELEINE

Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that

was all. But she's a demon, you know. She

even called the cops with a tip on La

Verne's--just hoping I'd get smeared in

the papers. I scratched her good for

that.

BUCKY

Martha tell you this?

BUCKY

Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no

one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's.

MADELEINE

Figures.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

What are you gonna do?

BUCKY

Passports. All four.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

Don't insult me, lad.

MADELEINE

We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you

go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what?

Some little slut--

EMMETT SPRAGUE

You know, laddie. The rich don't

necessarily own art just for themselves;

we safekeep it for future generations.

BUCKY

I need to see it.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

It?

BUCKY

Just to be sure. I need to see it.

EMMETT SPRAGUE

I'm not sure I know...

BUCKY

I need to see his grave, you tightass

kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you

bury George Tilden?

VOICE OVER

When I'd pulled George's print card that

morning, I'd already laid fifty down with

Russ that he was our guy. Amateur

taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop

39th and Norton woulda been right in the

middle of his beat...

VOICE OVER

But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't

wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving

him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.

VOICE OVER

Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or

probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists

would've given way to a full load of .45

in the chest.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Sprague said they found him croaked in a

parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks

from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just

croaked. Natural causes, if anything

about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped

the evil ate him from the inside out,

filling him with blackness like the

sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)

JANE CHAMBERS

...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure

that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not

my dog and those sure as hell aren't my

shoes!

JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)

It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of

course you've been staking out the

Sprague house. Four nights in a row.

(off his surprise)

I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost

as nosy as you.

BUCKY

(covering)

Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.

JANE CHAMBERS

(re the painting)

I'd been thinking about giving it to

charity, but it's too valuable. I found

Eldridge's receipt...

JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)

It's a Frederick Yannantuono original,

inspired by an old classic novel--The

Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo.

JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)

The clown in the painting is the book's

main character, Gwynplain. When he was a

child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear

and then sold to the 16th century Spanish

aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)

Are you all right, Bucky?

BUCKY

Yes, I'm fine.

BUCKY (cont'd)

Where'd Eldridge get the painting?

JANE CHAMBERS

You'll appreciate the coincidence--

JANE CHAMBERS

What is it--

RAMONA

I'm in here, officer.

BUCKY

I know what you did, Ramona. You and

Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold

it the day of the murder. You know I've

got the book. And now I've got you.

RAMONA

We see you out there, you know. Every

night. We see you. You don't fool us. You

didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt

Madeleine. And as much as I wish you

would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a

voyeur. That's all the lesser classes

have. Pressing their nose up against the

glass.

BUCKY

So tell me. Let me see.

RAMONA

Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you

know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked

just like Georgie. When he got out of the

hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a

present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid

of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely

spoke.

BUCKY

Tell me about Betty Short.

RAMONA (cont'd)

(with venom)

It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become

obsessed with her...That filthy film.

BUCKY

Your husband bought her for George.

RAMONA

Emmett never stopped hating me.

BUCKY

For George--

RAMONA

For being richer than he was.

RAMONA (cont'd)

I followed them to the bungalow. There

was a baseball bat under...under a

tree...She tried to run from me...but she

was drunk. The first swing knocked her

out. I made Georgie tie her to the

mattress....The second swing woke her up.

BUCKY

You tortured her.

RAMONA (cont'd)

She looked so much like my Maddy. It

was...the cruelest of jokes.

RAMONA (cont'd)

Martha mustn't know. She's all that's

left of this family that isn't dying. You

consider her when you decide whether

we're worth it.

RAMONA (cont'd)

Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought

Martha was going to bring the whole

family down around her by chance. Her

little stunt about tipping the police to

LaVerne's--

BUCKY

She lied about that. To get Madeleine's

goat.

RAMONA

Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is

worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is

on you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KAY

Dwight?

BUCKY

How much of the hundred grand did Lee let

you keep?

BUCKY

He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew

about Laverne's Hideaway.

BUCKY (VO)

He blackmailed Sprague--

MADELEINE (VO)

--Don't come over. Daddy's having a

business soiree--

LEE

--Penance for Junior Nash--

BUCKY

And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He

took that hundred thousand and split to

Mexico and you let him go!

KAY

You are so, so good at some things.

KAY

He was going to leave no matter what. I

didn't know if I was ever going to see

him again, and I wanted him to be

comfortable if such a thing was possible.

Dwight, he knew I was in love with you,

and he wanted us to be together.

BUCKY

He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the

bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt.

He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and

fucking ran away! This whole time. You

both knew everything--

KAY

Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl!

I don't give a damn about that girl. She

ruined our lives!

KAY (cont'd)

He loved us. Don't take that away from

him. And I love you. And if you hadn't

seen so much of yourself in her you'd

realize how much you loved me. (beat) So

if you're aware of something more

important than that...I'd like to hear

what it is.

BUCKY

(quoting Lee)

Adios yourself back to the Halls of

Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business

with the lady.

BUCKY

I've been pointing my gun at a lot of

people this week. But I haven't had much

of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya

think?

MADELEINE

I think you'd rather fuck me than kill

me. But you don't have the guts to do

either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.

BUCKY

(Scotchman's burr)

Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short

to the very end, eh?

BUCKY (cont'd)

It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.

But then again you've got an ear for

accents. Accents, dressing up in

costumes...

BUCKY (cont'd)

Do another one for me. Play someone else.

Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's

girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do

another.

MADELEINE

I don't know what you're talking about--

BUCKY

How 'bout the Mexican accent you used

when you hired the private dick to track

down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.

Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,

that you wore when you chased after poor

daddy's money. Tell me something--you

shoot Lee yourself?

BUCKY (cont'd)

Did you at least have the guts to shoot

him yourself?

MADELEINE

You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I

look like her.

VOICE OVER

We took the fall together.

VOICE OVER

Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine

Sprague confessed to killing Lee by

concocting a love triangle from the three

of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch

fought over her hand, with Lee beating

Emmett and demanding he "hand over" his

daughter when she preferred me.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing

him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague

honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia

murder case at all.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Her story's enough to get her a psych tag

as a delusional schizophrenic and ten

years at Atascadero State Hospital.

VOICE OVER

So the brass girl took the fall for the

whole family. And I took the fall for me.

IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a

cop's code make-good for Blanchard's

snuff.

VOICE OVER (cont'd)

Afterwards I was fired from the Los

Angeles Police Department on grounds of

moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an

officer. I thought of turning over Ramona

in hopes of pulling a grandstander's

turnabout...

VOICE OVER

...but I had people to protect...People

who already knew that, for the briefest

of times, and in the darkest of places, I

had been so, so, good at some things.

VOICE OVER

Thank you Elizabeth.
