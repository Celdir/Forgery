Full Pink Draft

KEOUGH (O.S.)

And they pay you for this?  To tag

beaver?

WALT (O.S.)

Imagine.

KEOUGH

Ask me, what an animal does in the

wild is his own business so long as

he doesn't do it to man.  I think

Mark Twain said that.

WALT

(dry)

I think he didn't.  But since

you've said it, I guess we're

covered.

KEVIN

Kelly.

KELLY

(warmly)

Kevin, hey.

KEVIN

Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a

second?

KELLY

(great idea)

Absolutely.

KEVIN

I had a great time last night.

Again.

KELLY

Me too.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(deducing)

That's not what you came to say.

KEVIN

You work for me.  I'm not

comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

KELLY

I was working for you when "us"

started, what's--

KEVIN

I know and I thought I could handle

it but work and pleasure along with

somebody else, it's a dangerous

mix.

KELLY

Kevin, as long as we...

(suddenly)

What was that last part?

KEVIN

(sheepish)

The somebody else part?

KELLY

Yeah, that part.  There's...

somebody who's um...

KEVIN

(feels terrible)

Else.

KELLY

(covering)

Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This

uh... this probably wasn't meant to

be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I

gotta be ten years younger and you,

you... you're y'know...

KEVIN

(reading her mind)

A jerk.

KELLY

(you have no idea)

Oh...

(then)

No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm

just thrown, I'm...

(checks her watch)

I actually have an early lunch,

so...

KEVIN

It's ten after nine.

KELLY

Yes, well...

(smiling)

famished.

CUT TO:

WALT

Sheriff!!

KEOUGH

Hey!

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

(going into shock)

Jesus Christ.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELLY

What do you expect, mugging me from

behind?

OKUBO

I tapped you.

KELLY

Well you shouldn't have.  How did

you even know where I was.

OKUBO

(sarcastic)

Wild guess.

KELLY

I don't like to be scared, Myra, I

have a thing about fright, don't

ever scare me.

OKUBO

Kevin told me you were upset.

KELLY

Really?  I never realized he was so

psychic, how could he detect that,

did he tell you there's somebody

else?

OKUBO

(sheepish)

Well... he didn't have to tell me

that part.

KELLY

You?

OKUBO

It started before you, Kelly, I

never would've--

KELLY

You?

OKUBO

It was just a quick thing which we

thought was over, and and...

KELLY

You and Kevin.

OKUBO

It wasn't suppose to happen, I

don't know what to say...

KELLY

You don't know what to say, lucky

for you action speaks louder than

words.

OKUBO

Kelly--

KELLY

I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just

never thought of you as a y'know...

OKUBO

Backstabber?

KELLY

(don't be silly)

No.

OKUBO

Liar?

KELLY

(c'mon)

Myra.

OKUBO

Shitbutt?

KELLY

I really... I should get back.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(to the pedestrian)

Don't fuck with me!

CUT TO:

JACK

What did this?

CUT TO:

KEVIN

Hey.

KELLY

Kevin.  How's it going, what's

happenin', family good, great, nice

to catch up, get out.

KEVIN

This is business.

(then)

There was an accident in Maine,

some guy got killed by something in

a lake.  Probably a bear, but...

they found a tooth.

KELLY

A tooth?

KEVIN

A tooth they say couldn't have come

from any bear.  They say it looks

prehistoric.  Like maybe a

dinosaur.

KELLY

(without looking up)

Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,

he got killed by a dinosaur,

anything else?

KEVIN

I want you to go there.

KELLY

Sorry?

KEVIN

I'm sure it's nothing, but you're

a paleontologist, this is what we

do, I--

KELLY

This is what we do?

KEVIN

I'd like you to check out this

lake.  See--

KELLY

Are you on drugs?

KEVIN

Kelly--

KELLY

I'm not going to Maine, I won't

even go west of Forty-third Street--

KEVIN

Part of our research--

KELLY

I'm not even a field person.

KEVIN

Well on this one I'd like you to

be.

KELLY

This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?

Get me out of the office for a few

days, until--

KEVIN

It has nothing to do with--

KELLY

I never do field work and even if

I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of

a dinosaur who bit somebody,

couldn't you dream up something--

KEVIN

Kelly--

KELLY

I am not going to Maine.  That's

ridiculous.

CUT TO:

KEOUGH

He just came up screaming.

KELLY

Did he say anything?

KEOUGH

He just kinda gurgled.  He was

pretty much dead.

KELLY

And you didn't see anything?

KEOUGH

The lake was dead calm until up he

came.  The tooth is in there.

KELLY

(seeing)

There?  That's the morgue.

KEOUGH

Yes.

KELLY

Is the dead guy in there?

KEOUGH

That's where they keep them.

(then)

You want me to bring the tooth out

here?

KELLY

Um.

(bravado)

No, no.  Let's go.

KELLY

I need to get a microscopic look at

it.

DANIELS

Fine.

(indicating)

There you go.

KELLY

Maybe I should see...

(the body)

KEOUGH

(reading her)

I wouldn't.

KELLY

I'm fine, thank you.

KEOUGH

Have you ever seen a dead body

before, Ms. Scott?

KELLY

Well.

(admits)

At wakes.

KEOUGH

This is a little different.

KELLY

I can look at dead things.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Wait.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Okay.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(fighting off nausea)

This... how long did this attack go

on for?

KEOUGH

Seconds.  Three, four.

KELLY

And this is how he came to the

boat?

KEOUGH

Yes.

KELLY

Okay.

(then)

And is there a place nearby I could

go to vomit?

CUT TO:

KEOUGH

Nobody lives within twenty-five

miles, 'cept some old couple who

live right on the lake.  Teenagers

trek in every once in a while, none

have disappeared, and none have

spotted anything unusual.

KELLY

You talk to the married couple?

KEOUGH

Not yet.

KELLY

What kind of backup do we have?

KEOUGH

We?

KELLY

(defensive)

What?

KEOUGH

Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear

as to why the Museum of Natural

History would send somebody here.

KELLY

You have a thing against museums?

KEOUGH

I got nothing against--

KELLY

Ever even been in one?

KELLY

What is that?

KEOUGH

Lightweight Forward Area air device

unit.  Whatever's out there, one

shot with this and he's dead.

KELLY

(incredulous)

And you stock these things for

what, to fend off Russia?

KEOUGH

You're sort of a rude person.

KELLY

It's just that--

KELLY (CONT'D)

Mosquitos.  I have a thing about

mosquitos.

JACK

We set?

KEOUGH

Ready.

(re Kelly; dry)

A museum in New York sent us some

additional back up.

KELLY

Kelly Scott.

JACK

Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?

KELLY

Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

JACK

Did you make anything of the tooth?

KELLY

Yes, it did seem prehistoric but

I'm sure he just carried the thing

for luck.  Not that it worked,

obviously.  It probably somehow got

lodged into his body.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Why are you staring at me?

(to Keough)

Do I have a smudge on my face, it

would be so you not to have told

me.

KEOUGH

(to Jack)

I'm ready when you are.

JACK

Let's go.

KELLY

Excuse me.  One other thing, it's

a small point, but... I have a

thing about being humored, and I'm

feeling humored, more by him, but

you seemed quick to join in.

JACK

Ma'am, your first impression isn't

going well.

JANINE

Excuse me?  Is it true you're going

to look for some kind of monster in

Black Lake?

KEOUGH

We're just going to investigate an

accident.  There's no monster.

JANINE

We heard a man got bit in half.

KEOUGH

There was an accident, that's all.

Nothing to worry about.

KELLY

Please.

CUT TO:

BICKERMAN

Oh, my husband passed away almost

two years ago.

KEOUGH

My department doesn't have any

record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.

BICKERMAN

(with some attitude)

Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't

realize you keep such a firm track

of the dead.

KELLY

(gently)

What was the cause of your

husband's death, Ma'am, do you

know?

KELLY (CONT'D)

We don't mean to invade your

privacy but... was he ill, was he

sick?

KEOUGH

Was he swallowed?

KELLY

(reprimanding)

Sheriff.

JACK

Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're

up here... a man was fatally

attacked yesterday by some animal

in this lake.  Do you know how your

husband died?

BICKERMAN

(brightly)

Oh yes.  I killed him.

JACK

You killed him.

BICKERMAN

(happily)

Oh, yes.

KEOUGH

And how would you have accomplished

this, Ma'am?

BICKERMAN

(rattling it off quickly,

simply)

Well, he was very ill and he

refused to go see a doctor and

well... I think he had Alzheimer's,

he would be coherent one day,

incoherent the next and one

coherent day, he asked me to end

his suffering.  I wouldn't do it

but he kept insisting and insisting

and deteriorating till the point

the only cognitive thing he could

really do was that I finish him

off.  Finally I just gave in and

hit him on the head with a skillet

then buried him under the bulkhead.

BICKERMAN (CONT'D)

(to Keough)

Dig him up if you don't believe me,

Javert.

CUT TO:

KEOUGH

Half mile up, there's a clearing.

JACK

You gonna dig up that lady's

husband?

KEOUGH

I'll call the coroner.

KELLY

(looking around)

What is with this lake?  It looks

black and... there are no waves or

anything.

KEOUGH

They wanted to call it Lake Placid.

But somebody said that name was

taken.

KELLY

(to Jack)

Gee.

KEOUGH

The tents were sent ahead, they

should already be set-up.

KELLY

(what?)

We're staying in tents?

KEOUGH

I told you.  Two days, we'd have to

camp.

KELLY

Yes, camp, I thought that meant

Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents",

will there be toilets?

KEOUGH

(seeing something)

What the hell?

KELLY

What?

KEOUGH

(slowing the boat)

I thought I saw...

KELLY

It looks like a branch.

KEOUGH

Hey!!

KELLY

You threw it at me!!

KEOUGH

(denying)

I just let go of it.

KELLY                       JACK

You threw it at me!!       Alright.

(to Jack)

Did you see that?

KEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D)

Stop hitting me!           Ma'am!

KELLY

Don't throw heads at me,

(to Jack)

and stop calling me "Ma'am"!

JACK

What is going on here?

KELLY

How big do the bears get?

JACK

Big but... a bear couldn't do that

to a moose or man in water.  On

land maybe.  But...

KELLY

And they're sure he didn't get

tangled under the outboard somehow?

JACK

Hank says he's sure.

KELLY

It really is beautiful, isn't it?

JACK

Never been to Maine before?

KELLY

I was told they discriminate

against people with hygiene.

(off Jack)

I never believed it.

JACK

Why are you here?  Really.

KELLY

I told you.

JACK

The Museum of Natural History

doesn't send out investigators to--

KELLY

How would you know, what--

JACK

And even if they did, I doubt he or

she would have problems with tents.

KELLY

So I don't like tents, why--

JACK

You don't like tents, mosquitos,

look at your fingernails, you have

about as much business being in the

woods--

KELLY                      JACK (CONT'D)

What's wrong with my       --as Emily Post, it doesn't

fingernails these are      make sense--

perfectly good--

JACK (CONT'D)

(overriding)

They sent you out to examine a tooth,

why are you out here on the on the lake?

KELLY

I am a paleontologist.

(throwing it out)

I also was dating my boss he turned

out to be involved with a co-worker

who was also my friend and for the

sake of comfort, theirs, I was

shipped off to Maine.

(then)

I don't feel like going back yet.

KELLY (CONT'D)

I'm not making it up.

JACK

Well.  You don't have to stay out

here, why don't--

KELLY

I've come, I'm here, I'm staying.

Unless there are ticks.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Oh my God.

JACK

What?

KELLY

If this is who I think it is.

(as it gets closer)

It is.

JACK

Who?

KELLY

Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook

mythology professor.  He's done

some work with our museum.  He also

treks the world to swim with

crocodiles.

KEOUGH

(arriving)

With what?

KELLY

Crocodiles.  He's an expert on

them.  And if he's here... then he

must think that's what's in this

lake.

JACK

In Maine?

KELLY

There have been Northern sightings.

But not this North.

HECTOR

(spotting Kelly;

disappointed)

You beat me.  Balls.

(then)

I need some of you to help me

unpack.

(to Burke and Stevens)

You and you.

(to Keough)

Not you.

(to Kelly)

Who do we have from Fish And Game?

KEOUGH                      JACK

(to Kelly)                 Me.

Who is this man?

HECTOR

(rapid fire)

I could see the algae blooms just

coming in, how long has this lake

been stagnant?

(extending his hand to

Keough)

Hi, Hector Cyr.  The Earth is round

and so should you be.

KEOUGH

(to Kelly)

--Who is he?

HECTOR

I'll need any and all topographic

studies.

KEOUGH

Wait just a second.  You don't just

fly in here and start barking

orders.

HECTOR

I apologize, I just don't want to

lose the light, we've got time for

a quick scout,

(to Kelly)

you've had work done.

KELLY                KEOUGH

(flaring)             (frustrated)

I have not.           Who is this man?

HECTOR

Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me

know when it sinks in,

(to Kelly)

have you seen it?

KELLY                      KEOUGH (CONT'D)

No.                        Mister...

KELLY (CONT'D)

It couldn't be a crocodile.

HECTOR

They've been migrating north,

Kelly, this lake connects to the

ocean,--

KEOUGH

(frustrated)

Mr. Cyr!

HECTOR

C'mon, we're losing light,

(to Kelly)

why does the big one heckle me?

KELLY

(sotto)

Hector.  The big one has no sense

of humor.  And since he's the one

who decides whether you get to

play, try not to be your obnoxious

self.

HECTOR

That hurt my feelings.

JACK

(arriving)

If we're gonna go we better go.

CUT TO:

HECTOR

If he's here, I'll find him.

(to Jack, re Kelly)

Did she tell you we had sex

together?

KELLY

I never had sex with you!

HECTOR

Even so, you're allowed to boast.

You look thin by the way, I've

mentally undressed you, I can see

your ribcage.

KEOUGH

I really don't mean to be

discourteous.

(patronizing)

But how is it a person could come

to believe that a crocodile is in

New England?

HECTOR

They have saltwater glands, they

can swim across oceans, it's only

a matter of time.

KEOUGH

And what would he do come winter?

HECTOR

They can survive winter.  As long

as their nostrils don't freeze,

they survive,

(to Kelly)

am I foolish to explain things, he

had such trouble with my name?

KELLY                    KEOUGH

(scolding)          Hey.

Hector.

HECTOR

(to Keough)

Is this where it happened?

KEOUGH

Around here.  Yeah.

HECTOR

(knows his crocodiles)

If he's eaten in the area, he

shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang

around the food source.

KELLY

But they're nighttime hunters,

Hector, he'd probably be on land

now anyway.

HECTOR

'Cept he wasn't before, was he?

(then to Keough)

You know, when friends or family

members say things, they tend not

to register so sometimes it helps

to hear it from a total stranger.

You're fat.

KELLY

Hector.

JACK

What's that?

KEOUGH

White perch.

JACK

Are they feeding?

KEOUGH

Doesn't look like it.

JACK

They look like they're jumping.

KELLY

They look scared.

KELLY (CONT'D)

My hair.

CUT TO:

KELLY

(into her phone)

None of us actually saw anything.

(then)

I realize this Sir, but something

flipped us over, I doubt very much

it was a mink.

HECTOR

What's going on?

KEOUGH

They don't believe her.

KELLY

(still into phone)

Thank you, it's so rewarding to

imagine my tax dollar finding its

way to you, you Fucker.

(she clicks off)

HECTOR

Such the flirt.

KELLY

U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody

without a confirmation.

JACK

Same thing from Fish And Game.

KELLY

Something's in that water.

JACK

Well until we see it, we're not

gonna be convincing too many

people.

GARE (O.S.)

(calling)

Sheriff.

GARE

(pointing to the ground)

You might want to see this.

KELLY (O.S.)

Oh God, worms.  I got a thing about

worms.

GARE

It's a human toe.

HECTOR

Some decomposition, little acidic,

it has been swallowed.

(to Keough; holding the

toe)

Is this the man who was killed?

KEOUGH

We'd only just met.

HECTOR

Well, you've got a croc alright,

they're keystone species.

KEOUGH

Keystone what?

HECTOR

Species, keystones affect the

entire ecosystem, that could

explain all these worms, the water.

You've got a crocodile.

(proffering the toe)

Bury your friend.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

Baby crocs?

KELLY

Adult males will charge hatchlings.

If there's one out there...

JACK

If one could be out there... why

does Fish And Game tell me it's

impossible?

KELLY

Because they just consult their

little indigenous charts.

JACK

Listen... if you really do know

crocs, you should know how stealth

like they are.  I wouldn't be

standing a foot from the water.

JACK (CONT'D)

He could be right there and you

wouldn't see him.

KELLY

(still looking at the

water)

I'd be able to see something.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(realizing)

Oh that's funny.  That was real

funny.

CUT TO:

BURKE

(shrugs)

He paid us.  Five hundred.

HECTOR

You're a beautiful woman.

GARE

Thank you.

HECTOR

And law enforcement, such dangerous

work.  The idea that you could die

suddenly with no offspring,

disconcerting, let's mate, commit

your genes to perpetuity.

KEOUGH

Hey.

KEOUGH

We are here on official business.

HECTOR

Cocktail?

KEOUGH

No!!

(then)

What's with digging the holes?

HECTOR

They come on land and they're

brazen.  They're also attracted to

noise, you can see I make a lot of

it.

KEOUGH

Everybody out, back to your tents,

now!

HECTOR

(re Gare)

Could she stay, we've tentatively

scheduled intercourse.

KEOUGH

No!!  Out!

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

(to Hector)

You listen to me.  The only reason

I'm letting you be part of this is

'cause you got the helicopter and

the radar--

HECTOR

And you like me.

KEOUGH

I do not like you.

HECTOR

Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing

fond of you and it's liberating to

say so.

KEOUGH

You're a whacko.

HECTOR (O.S.)

That hurt my feelings.

CUT TO:

JACK

What are you doing?

KELLY

Skipping stones.  Look how flat

that water is, you can get ten

skips on a good one.

JACK

Listen, uh... Hank and I think it

best if you stay on shore.

KELLY

I beg your pardon?

JACK

Whatever's out there did flip over

a canoe--

KELLY

I am not staying on shore.

JACK

It's too dangerous for--

KELLY

I didn't fly up here to roast

marshmallows--

JACK

You flew up here because your boss--

KELLY

I am going out on that boat and why

are you picking on me, is this some

kind of--

KELLY (CONT'D)                  JACK

hazing, new fingernails    I'm not picking--

in the woods?

JACK (CONT'D)

(overriding)

I'm beginning to see why you were

shipped off.

KELLY

(wounded; quietly)

That was an awful thing to say to

me.

JACK

(feels bad now)

I'm sorry but you're...

KELLY

(genuine)

I do know crocodiles and I won't

get in your way.

(then)

I really do want to be a part of

this.

JACK

Okay.

(then)

We're up at six.

KELLY

Good.

JACK

(a beat)

'Night.

DISSOLVE TO:

HECTOR

Jesus Christ!!

KEOUGH

What the hell are you doing?!!

HECTOR

What are you doing?!

KEOUGH

You're crawling around like a--

HECTOR

I'm laying a spring trap!

KEOUGH

A spring trap!

HECTOR

I keep telling you, they can come

on land, I don't wanna wake up in

the middle of the night--

KEOUGH

I coulda shot you, you--

HECTOR

This could end up saving your life,--

HECTOR (CONT'D)                  KEOUGH

You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, I'm sure you

shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your

tongue massaging my          class but I think you need

hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber

running off to get your      room, where you can play with

sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles.

probably already call mom.

KELLY

(arriving)

Hey!  What is going on?

HECTOR                    KEOUGH

This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around--

to pee!

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

(escalating)

This is an official investigation,

and this cuckoo bird is a civilian.

I don't care how much money he's

got, he's a total mental.

KELLY

You hurt his feelings.  I think you

should go apologize.

KEOUGH

Apologize?

KELLY                   KEOUGH (CONT'D)

We're a team here.  It     He's a fruitcake!

won't kill you to get

along.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Look.  The thing about Hector... he

takes this crocodile business

very...

(how to say it)

he thinks they're Godly.

JACK

He thinks they're what?

KELLY

In his defense, every primitive

culture known to man deified them.

He's a mythology professor, he

thinks crocs are divine conduits.

KEOUGH

Is this 'spose to make me take him

more serious?

KELLY

It's to make you understand him,

with understanding comes tolerance.

Too bad they don't put proverbs in

Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

KEOUGH

(befuddled)

Why does everybody insult my

intelligence, I have intelligence,

intelligent people eat Twinkies.

KELLY

I'm sorry.

JACK

Let's just all get some sleep.

KEOUGH

I'm an intelligent person.

KEOUGH (O.S.)

(calmly)

I shall kill him.

DISSOLVE TO:

KEOUGH

Again, I don't mean to be annoying

with my questions.  But if it is a

crocodile which I don't think it

is.  And if they do charge these

baby hatchling sounds...

(to Jack)

why exactly would you want to be

underwater at the time?

(to Hector)

With you it makes sense.

HECTOR

They don't really attack underwater

and--

KEOUGH

That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

HECTOR

No crocodile has ever--

KELLY

(to Hector)

You should take a flax pole.

HECTOR

And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He

drowns.  You think about that?

KELLY

I'm just saying last resort.

KEOUGH

Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do

we have a problem with it dying?

HECTOR

Crocodiles don't sever with their

teeth, their molars are blunt.

KEOUGH

Is this a trick?

HECTOR

What I'm saying is if it's a

crocodile that cut a man in half he

would have to be over twenty feet

which would make him well over a

hundred years old, it would be

unthinkable to destroy him.

JACK

(to Burke)

Alright, let's just drop here.

KELLY

They respond pretty quick.  I'll

wait till you get down before I

turn it on.

JACK

Good.

(climbing over)

See ya soon.

KELLY

Good luck.

HECTOR

(to Kelly)

Two years married, divorced, used

to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still

waiting on his sperm count.

KELLY

What?

(off Hector's look)

Oh as if I'm interested.

HECTOR

As if.

(as he's about to go

overboard; to Keough)

Will you miss me?

KEOUGH

(to Hector)

I brought a pork chop, maybe we

could hang it around your neck for

luck.

HECTOR

No thank you, but maybe later you

can chew the bark off my big fat

log.

KEOUGH

(to Kelly)

Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

KELLY

(strict)

I asked you to be nice to him.

CUT TO:

KELLY

He may be a kook but he's also been

all over the world with them.  He

even swam in the Grimetti with

killer Niles all around him, he

never got nipped.

KEOUGH

And that's why he thinks they're

Godly?

KELLY

He said he knew it when he looked

into their eyes.

KEOUGH

(simple)

You like Jack?

KELLY

(thrown)

What?  I don't even know the guy.

KEOUGH

Hector thinks you like him.

KELLY

Well Hector's a giant cracker.

KEOUGH

You think Jack's handsome?

KELLY

What is this?

KEOUGH

I'm just curious.  I can never tell

what women think is handsome.  Is

he handsome?

KELLY

Well.  He's probably rugged

handsome I guess.  Yeah.

KEOUGH

Am I?

DISSOLVE TO:

KELLY

It shouldn't be taking so long.

KEOUGH

(into headset)

Hector, Jack, we show you with

about twelve minutes of oxygen

left, and you're on the last tank.

Time to go home.

KELLY

That was a bust.

KELLY (CONT'D)

What was that?

KEOUGH

I don't know.  It was like a tug.

Something tugged us.

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

Hey!

BURKE

Something's got the anchor line!

KEOUGH

Kelly!!

KEOUGH

(into headset)

Jack!!  Hector!  We're being

dragged!!

(as he starts the motor; to

Burke)

Cut the line!  Cut the fucking

line!

KEOUGH

Cut the Goddamn rope!

BURKE

(working away)

I'm trying!

KELLY

Hurry up!!

KELLY (CONT'D)

Shit!!  Hank!!

BURKE

(screaming)

Look out!!

KEOUGH

(back to Kelly)

Are you alright?

KELLY

I think.  My hair.

(then)

Where's Hector?!

(to Jack)

Where is he?

JACK

We went in different directions.

That water is thick, you can't see

through it!

CUT TO:

KEOUGH

(into headset)

Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off

position, when you surface, you

gotta yell.

KELLY

(pointing)

There's bubbles over there!  Look!

KELLY (CONT'D)

There he is.  Here he comes!

CUT TO:

KEOUGH

(giving a statement)

Nobody actually saw it.  It

happened sudden.

JACK

You okay?

(nothing)

Kelly?

KELLY

Yeah.

(then)

Nobody saw anything?

JACK

No.

(then)

U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

KELLY

That's probably good.

JACK

Police want to keep it quiet, if

the press gets word... lake

monster.  They just want us to sit

tight.

JACK

Are you okay?

KELLY

Um... y'know...

(swallows)

Yeah.

JACK

A man died.  You don't have to be

so tough.

KELLY

I'm fine.  I uh... I'm fine.

HECTOR

(genuine)

I'm sorry.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

Was he a good man?

KEOUGH

Yup.

HECTOR

Whenever somebody dies I consider

it such a waste that I didn't know

him better.

KEOUGH

(fighting off disbelief;

shock maybe)

His head was just... bitten off.

HECTOR

(sadly)

I used to have this recurring

nightmare that I was headless.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

(quietly rattling it off)

I'd be on the ground looking up at

my body, no head, walking around

bumping into everything.  And my

parents wouldn't let me in the

house 'cause they'd just bought all

these new antique lamps and they

were afraid I'd knock them over,

made sense, and meanwhile, the

neighborhood bullies would see my

round little head on the ground

looking like a ball, and they'd

come rushing over to start up a

game of soccer.  I'd actually feel

grateful just for being allowed

into the contest, that's esteem for

you, what are your thoughts?

KEOUGH

(a powder keg)

You know, Hector, I'm sure you're

a fine person in your own mental

way.  But I think it would be best

if you and I didn't speak.

HECTOR

This is a setback.

KEOUGH

You don't want to cut me down.

'Cause I'll kill you.

CUT TO:

KELLY

Hard to believe there could be a

monster under such peacefulness.

JACK

I thought I might track the

shoreline tomorrow, look for

prints.

JACK (CONT'D)

You know they say the brain

confuses fear for passion.

KELLY

Excuse me?

JACK

When you get scared, the brain

releases a chemical, same chemical

it releases when somebody's...

(a beat)

in high school, the thing to do was

to take the girl to a scary movie.

KELLY

What are you talking about?

JACK

I'm saying between the moonlight,

a beautiful lake and a monster that

bites heads off... you look good.

KELLY

Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm

all moist.

JACK

Forgive me for trying to be nice.

KELLY

Nice?  Nice would be "you look

pretty," nice is not some man-

eating monster has tricked my brain

into making you look good.

JACK

I didn't say it like that.

KELLY

You did, you--

JACK

I was trying to pay you a

compliment, I was guising it as

science 'cause I know you're

comfortable in that arena.

Science.

KELLY

A man just died, you're hitting on

me with science.

JACK

Just forget it.

HECTOR

(arriving)

Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but

Hank seems to have gotten himself

stuck in a tree.

HECTOR

I probably could've accomplished

freeing him myself but he had a

look of mayhem on his upside down

face.

KELLY

Hank?

KEOUGH

(calmly)

Yes.

KELLY

Are you okay?

KEOUGH

(calmly; almost sweet)

Other than feeling slightly

embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.

(then)

Could you cut me down?

HECTOR

Promise you won't kill me, first.

KEOUGH

(calmly)

I have no interest in ever looking

at you, Hector.

(again)

Could you please cut me down?

JACK

You cut, we'll hold him.

KEOUGH

(calm)

Thank you.

(then)

I lied.

KEOUGH

(admitting)

Okay.  It's a crocodile.  I'll

admit it.

KELLY

(to Jack)

You're cut.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(to Hector)

He was an Indo-pacific.

HECTOR

(daunted)

Are you sure?

KELLY

Scales were oval.  It was an Asian

crocodile.

KEOUGH

Asia?  How... how could he get

here?

HECTOR

Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong

flushed him down a toilet.

KELLY

He had to be thirty feet long.

JACK

(charged)

Hank.  The little cannon you

brought, get it.  Guard the

shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done.

We made the I.D., our job is

finished.

KEOUGH

Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I

wanna know why that monster is

here.  You got a theory?

KELLY

Why he's that big, I don't know.

Why he's here... the wetlands are

being developed, crocodiles are

moving.  Australia, Fiji, the

things have started to cross

oceans.

JACK

But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs

are social, why's this guy on the

move by himself?

HECTOR

Maybe he doesn't play well with

others.

KEOUGH

Is everything a big fucking joke to

you?

HECTOR

(re his groin)

Bite my bishop.

KEOUGH

I'm sick of him!

JACK                       HECTOR

(interceding)        Let him go!  I'm sick of you

C'mon.                   too, let him go.

(then)

Thing about being rich, Sheriff,

my parents had the added luxury of

being able to ditch me off at Karate

school, I'm a brown belt.  So go

ahead.  Take your best shot.

KELLY

Hank!

KEOUGH

(who knew?)

He said he knew Karate!

HECTOR

(shaken)

At school they'd always say "go"

first.

JACK

(to Keough)

Get your big gun and guard the

shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.

HECTOR

(muttering as he goes)

He never said "go".

JACK

(to Keough)

Get the gun.

KEOUGH

(muttering as he goes)

If I fall into a hole or get

hoisted into a tree...

JACK

(re Keough and Hector)

Like little children.

(then)

You okay?

KELLY

Yeah.  I got some stuff for your

cut.

JACK

I couldn't believe... did you see

the size of that thing's mouth?

KELLY

I wonder if he's some kind of

mutant.

(then)

That bear had to be surprised.

JACK

(taking her arm; ushering)

Let's get away from the shore.

JACK (CONT'D)

Sorry.

KELLY

It's okay.

TOM (O.S.)

Told you I could make it.

TOM

There it is.

STEVE

(stripping)

Last one in's a dead man.

CUT TO:

JACK

Ow.  Shit.

KELLY

Just gotta pull it a little

tighter.

JACK

Who taught you be be a nurse?

KELLY

Father's a surgeon.  I can even

stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a

bad idea here.

JACK

No thanks.

KELLY

Keep it dry.  No swimming.

JACK

(dry)

Thank you.

JACK (CONT'D)

You're having the best time of your

life, aren't you?

KELLY

(caught)

What?  Why... people have been

killed, I hardly think I'm having

a good time, why would...

(off his look; copping)

Does it show?

KELLY (CONT'D)

This is the first time I've

actually... y'know been in the

middle of anything.  I've never

really even gotten dirty before,

with me showers have always been

preventative.

JACK

That's why you're here.  To get in

the middle of something?

KELLY

Maybe.  I've always read about

what's happened.  I've never... I

know it sounds silly but, it's nice

to be someplace while something is

actually... y'know... happening.

KELLY (CONT'D)

We should probably go to bed.

(quickly)

Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our

separate beds, get some rest.

JACK

Thanks for the... bandaid.

KELLY

(please don't go)

Night.

CUT TO:

JANINE

Here I come.  Ready or not.

STEVE

All or nothing, Tom.

TOM

From the jaws of defeat...

STEVE

Ha ha.

JANINE

(still in the water)

Tommy?

(then)

This isn't funny, Tommy.

STEVE

Tommy?

DANNY

C'mon,  Tommy.

JANINE

Where is he?

DANNY

(yelling)

This isn't funny!!

CUT TO:

HECTOR

What's that?

KEOUGH

It came from across the lake.

JACK

(to Keough)

You said nobody came in here!

KEOUGH

Obviously I was wrong!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JANINE

He just took him in his jaws.

KEOUGH

He was in his mouth?!

JANINE

Yes.

JACK

(stunned; to Tommy)

You're okay?

TOMMY

(in shock)

I think; just cuts.

DANNY

The thing just came up out of the

water and kind of spit him at us.

JANINE

You should have signs posted, for

God's sake!

JACK

(examining him)

You're really okay?

TOMMY

I might need a Tetanus.

HECTOR

Just spit him back out.  Some shall

live, some shall die, arbitrarily,

sound like any higher power we

know?

KEOUGH

(dismissive)

He didn't eat the kid cause he'd

just swallowed a bear.

HECTOR

Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest

God--

KEOUGH

I'm tired, Hector.  I know this

because you're beginning to not bug

me.

HECTOR

That sounds good but underneath

it's hurtful.

(then)

Nightcap?

KEOUGH

Raincheck.

JACK

Well.  Goodnight.

KELLY

We seem to say goodnight a lot.

JACK

We could not say it and...

(suddenly a coward)

Well, that thing is ambulatory if

you want somebody in your tent

to...

KELLY

Night.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

JACK

Get back from the shore.  We know

how fast he can leap out.

KEOUGH

We shouldn't even really be doing

this.

JACK

They won't be here till at least

noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

KEOUGH

So does he.

KELLY

(obsessing)

I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it.

They're drawn to me.  I got a thing

about ticks.

JACK

(quickly)

Ssssh!

KELLY

What?

JACK

I heard something.

KELLY

(trying to gather herself)

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

KEOUGH

(suddenly)

Look.

JACK

(to Keough)

Guard the water.

JACK (CONT'D)

That's pretty big.

GARE

It seems like we're getting lower.

HECTOR

It happens when I land.

GARE

Why are we landing?

HECTOR

'Cause this is the cove he

obviously lives in.

GARE

(alarmed)

So why are we landing?

(then)

Hector.

KELLY

Thing we can lift it?

JACK

Maybe.  Don't mush it.

KELLY

(annoyed)

I'm not mushing it.

JACK

You're mushing it a little around

the--

KELLY

I'm not mushing it.

JACK

(holding her)

Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

KELLY

That is it!!

JACK

Really--

KELLY

No.  I keep getting hit with heads!

JACK

(holding her shoulders)

Calm down.

KELLY

You calm down!

JACK

Calm down.

KELLY

I'm being very calm.  I'm composed.

This is the second time I've been

hit with a severed head, I'm

entitled to complain.

STEVENS

(re the head)

Is that uh...

KEOUGH

I can't recognize him from the

back.  It looks like him.

KEOUGH

That's him.

(re something)

What the...?

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

Now I'm gonna puke.

JACK

(seeing something)

You gotta be kidding.

KELLY

What?

JACK

(pointing)

Look.

KELLY

What is she doing now?

(then)

Mother of God.

KEOUGH

What?

KELLY

Look ten feet into the water.

BICKERMAN

Come and get it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BICKERMAN

(indignant)

I haven't broken any laws.

KEOUGH

(bordering on

condescension)

Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied

to us, that could be obstruction of

justice.  A man's been killed in

part 'cause of your silence, I

could make out a charge of reckless

endangerment and I'm sure PETA

would be annoyed at how you treat

your cows.

BICKERMAN

The reason I lied is if I'd told

you the truth, you'd just hunt it

down and kill it which seems to be

exactly what you're doing.

KELLY

How long have you been feeding this

thing?

BICKERMAN

About six years.  He first appeared

in May of nineteen-ninety-one.

Bernie was out fishing and it

followed him home.  So we threw him

some scraps and well... he didn't

seem to bother anybody.  He became

kind of like a pet who lived in the

wild.

JACK

He just appeared.  You have no idea

how he arrived in this lake?

BICKERMAN

No.  Do you?

KEOUGH

Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You

didn't, by any chance, lead him to

the lake blindfolded?

BICKERMAN

(offended)

No, I did not.

(then)

The crocodile did kill him, though.

But it was all... it was a mistake.

KELLY

A mistake.

BICKERMAN

One of our horses got loose two

years ago, went to the lake to

drink and... well the crocodile

started coming in, Bernie went to

intercede and... it was all a

terrible misunderstanding.

(then)

If I reported it, they would've

sent people to kill it.

KEOUGH

Ma'am, how could you not report

this?  He puts human life at risk

and--

BICKERMAN

Nobody lives on this lake.  it's

really his lake now.

GARE

(getting panicked)

C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy

but you can't--

HECTOR

I need to see his habitat.

GARE

Please.  I'll have sex with you,

anything, but get out of the water.

HECTOR

He's not gonna hurt me.

CUT TO:

BICKERMAN

Murders and rapes in the cities.

People bomb planes... can the

police stop them?  No.  But feed

one little cow to a crocodile...

KEOUGH

You're to wait right here until the

police show, you're under full

house arrest.

BICKERMAN

Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.

GARE (O.S.)

(through walkie-talkie)

Hank!  We got a problem with

Hector.

KEOUGH

(into walkie-talkie)

What problem?

GARE (O.S.)

(through walkie-talkie)

He went swimming.

CUT TO:

HECTOR

(weakly)

Oh.... my.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

I suddenly feel a bit foolish.

(then)

You're different from the others.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

(terrified; trying to

convince himself)

Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost.

(swallows)

Holy shit.

CUT TO:

GARE

Hector!!

HECTOR

(to Gare; forced calm)

Just turn the ignition, it's fuel

injected.

GARE

Come on.

HECTOR

I know under the circumstances,

biting off my head might seem

viable.  It would cheapen you.

GARE

I might get a shot.

HECTOR

(fear in his voice)

No.  If you don't kill him

instantly, I'm dead and you'll only

kill him instantly if you get his

brain, which is about the size of

a cherry.  And even if you were on

target, a bullet might not

penetrate his hide.

GARE

(re the croc)

Jesus.

(to Hector)

About twelve more yards.  Keep

coming just like that.

GARE

(weakly)

Oh my God.

HECTOR

Move over!!

GARE

Go!!

GARE (CONT'D)

(screaming)

Go!!!

HECTOR

I'm trying!!!

CUT TO:

JACK

(livid)

This time, I'm gonna kick your

ass.

HECTOR

Bastard bit my chopper.

JACK

Hey!!

JACK (CONT'D)

You wanna kill yourself, that it,

you looking to commit some kind of

divine suicide?

KELLY

Alright, Jack!

JACK

No!

(back to Hector)

You might think they're Godly, you

might get some spiritual lift

backstrokin' with dragons but you

just put a deputy at risk and--

HECTOR

(flaring)

Let's not overlook he didn't eat

me, maybe--

JACK

'Cause he just ate a cow, you

stupid--

KELLY

Jack!

HECTOR

I'm a civilian!  You don't have any

authority--

KEOUGH

I can arrest you!!

HECTOR

Then do it!!

KEOUGH

You probably do want to be killed

by it, that was you trying to meet

your maker.

HECTOR

So profound and fat.

KELLY

(softly)

Did you want to be killed by it?

HECTOR

You think I'm that nuts?

KELLY

(softly)

Hector.

(then)

What you just did... there was at

least some sort of a death wish

going on.

HECTOR

Nothing's real.

KELLY

Excuse me?

HECTOR

Nothing's real.

(escalating)

I'm rich, people are automatically

my friends, sycophants ooze out

like oil slicks and and and--

HECTOR (CONT'D)

With crocodiles... everything's

even.

KELLY

I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would

think there have to be better

places to look for autonomy, than--

HECTOR

(pained)

I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has

robbed me of the dream in life, I

sit here broken, a hollow sack--

KELLY

Oh, bullshit.

HECTOR

Didn't even sound good?

KELLY

No.

HECTOR

(worth a try)

Eh.  Fuck it.

KELLY

Can I tell them you won't go back

in the water?

HECTOR

Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I

don't know...

KELLY

What?

HECTOR

Could we have intercourse?

CUT TO:

JACK

Just heard from Wildlife and

Florida Fish And Game.  They should

be here by four.

KELLY

Okay.

JACK

We might as well pack.

KELLY

Good idea.

HECTOR (O.S.)

They'll kill him.

HECTOR

They're not going to be able to

snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in

water, he drowns.

KELLY

They could try to tranq him on

land.

HECTOR

(knowing)

They won't.  He's taken human life,

the mission will be to put him

down.

KEOUGH

Gee, that would really disappoint

me.

HECTOR

Forget about him being God, he's

thirty feet long, he is a miracle

of nature, who somehow made his way

to Maine.  This is a grand beast.

A grand dragon.  An attempt should

at least be made to capture him

alive.

JACK

Well, you can try talking them into

that, if--

HECTOR

I have enough flaxedil with me to

put him out.  And I think I know a

way to--

JACK

Forget it.

HECTOR

Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when

they come, they will kill it.  They

have to, politically, he's too

dangerous, if something were to go

wrong... the odds are he will be

destroyed,--

KEOUGH                    HECTOR (CONT'D)

Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish

what...                 I'm having a sane moment, this

is a window.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

If he were neutralized when they

got here... they might consider

saving him.

KELLY

And how would we neutralize him?

HECTOR

We lure him on land and pump him

with the drugs.

JACK

No way.

HECTOR

Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's

probably a hundred and fifty years

old, he's bigger than an elephant.

JACK

So maybe Wildlife will try to save

him, they're more equipped to--

HECTOR

We both know what they'll do.

JACK

Even if we could tranq him-- how

would we get him on land.

KEOUGH

Other than to eat us?

HECTOR

He follows anything that moves.

You guys can be in the trucks with

tranq guns.  If he charges, drive

off, plus Hank you've got your hand-

held cannon.  We could do this with

no safety risk.  If it works, we

save a beast that should be saved.

JACK

And again.  How would you get him

on land?

HECTOR

That's actually the easy part.

CUT TO:

BICKERMAN

(to Keough)

I'll sue you.

KEOUGH

Go ahead.

BICKERMAN

(to Jack)

You can't take a cow by eminent

domain.

JACK

We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

BICKERMAN

You're all fuckers.  Vicious little

fuckers.

JACK

Are we crazy?

KELLY

Well...

JACK

We've got a cow hanging from a

helicopter.

KEOUGH

Let's get back to camp.

CUT TO:

HECTOR

Not much drag.  As long as I can

keep him from swinging, we're okay.

JACK

(into headset)

Keep enough tension to hold him up,

Hector, we don't know if he can

swim.

HECTOR (O.S.)

(through headset)

Right.

JACK

The more he thrashes, the better.

HECTOR (O.S.)

(through headset)

You ready on shore?

JACK

We're ready.

JACK (O.S.)

(through headset)

If he tires, lift him out.

JACK

It can't work.

KELLY

He has been going after everything.

It could work.

(then)

But this is not a happy cow.

JACK

He looks like a giant tea bag.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

(looking through

binoculars)

He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is

he swimming?

KELLY

(looking through

binoculars)

He's floating.  Take it home.

JACK

(into headset)

Hector.

HECTOR (O.S.)

Hold on!

HECTOR

I got something on the screen.

JACK (O.S.)

You do?

HECTOR

He's coming.

JACK

(into walkie-talkie; now

adrenalized)

Where?  Where?

HECTOR (O.S.)

(through walkie talkie)

Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow,

but straight toward Elsie.

JACK

Can you confirm visually or just

radar?

HECTOR (O.S.)

(through walkie talkie)

Radar, he's underwater.  But he's

definitely coming.

JACK

Okay.  Lead him in.

(to the others; barking)

Okay, everybody up on the trucks.

We aim for the stomach or side...

there's little chance the darts

will pierce his hide.  Everybody up

on the trucks.

HECTOR

(charged)

On our way.  There, he's surfacing,

there's the snout.  You little

sucker.

KELLY

(into walkie-talkie)

If he gets close, you go up,

Hector, don't you endanger that

cow.

KEOUGH

She's worried about the cow now.

HECTOR (O.S.)

(through walkie-talkie)

He's following.  Here we come.

JACK

(to Hector)

Nice and slow.

(to the others)

Let's get ready.

KELLY

He's mooing.

JACK

You wouldn't?

KEOUGH

They're coming right in.

KELLY

Such a simple idea and it's

working.  What does that tell you?

KEOUGH

That it's about to go wrong.

JACK

(into walkie talkie)

Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget

to lift up the cow.

HECTOR (O.S.)

(sarcastic, through walkie

talkie)

Thank you, Jack.

JACK

(to the team)

You shoot on my order.  If he

charges, I'll be yelling "go" which

means drivers take off.  And drive

fast, they can move on land.

(to Keough)

You set?

KEOUGH

Don't worry about me.

HECTOR

We're in about four feet of water

now.

JACK

Little closer.  Three, two, one...

JACK (CONT'D)

Fire!!

HECTOR

Oh, shit.

KELLY

(screaming)

Watch out!!

JACK

Keep firing!

HECTOR

Motherfucker.

JACK

Shit!!

KELLY

Hector!!

JACK

(to Keough)

Take him.

KEOUGH

I can't.  I'll get Hector!!

JACK

Where is he?!

KELLY

We gotta get to Hector!!

JACK

(to the driver)

Back us in a little, we need to get

a shot!

HECTOR

Where is he?

JACK

(to the Deputies)

Tranq guns down, rifles up!

JACK (CONT'D)

(yelling to Hector)

Do not go in that water!

(to the driver)

Back us in!!

JACK (CONT'D)

(to Keough)

If you get a safe shot...

KEOUGH

I'll take it!

JACK

Hector.  Do not move.

JACK (CONT'D)

(to Gare)

You see anything?

GARE

(looking through binocs)

Nothing.  Maybe he swam out.

JACK

Go!!  Drive!!

JACK (CONT'D)

Take him!!

KELLY

Did you get him?

KEOUGH

I don't know.

(to the Driver)

Back the truck--

ALL

No!!!

JACK

Hector, you see anything?

HECTOR

No!

KEOUGH

(sarcastic)

I just have this feeling

everything's totally safe.

HECTOR

(yelling)

I see blood.  Maybe you got him,

Hank.

HECTOR (CONT'D)

I can't see him, but this is

definitely blood.  Maybe you got

him.

KEOUGH

Where is he?!

HECTOR

I don't know!

KEOUGH

Hector!!

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

(taking aim)

Alright.  Game over.

KEOUGH (CONT'D)

(to Kelly)

Should I?

KELLY

Wait.

KELLY

I think the drugs are kicking in.

JACK

I don't think we really want to

wait for him to catch his breath.

KELLY

He's through fighting.  Look at

him.

JACK

I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

HECTOR

No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.

JACK

Yeah and every time we think

there's no more danger--

HECTOR

I'm okay.

KELLY

You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

JACK

Get him onto shore.

KELLY

He heeds a tourniquet.

KELLY (CONT'D)

You're gonna be okay.

HECTOR

Guess I finally got bit.

KELLY

Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix

it.

KEOUGH

(quietly; re the big croc)

He's done.  He's dying.

JACK

Don't count on it.

(then)

We better take him out.

HECTOR

(quiet)

Flax him under his tail.  Two

hundred cc's.  Under the tail,

that'll put him to sleep.

JACK

Thank God.

KELLY

We need to get it some medical

help.

(re Hector)

And him too.

KEOUGH

(explaining)

We trapped him with our chopper.

DISSOLVE TO:

PARAMEDIC

We're gonna airvac him to Portland.

KELLY

Okay.

(to Hector)

That's where they're taking the

croc, Hector, they've got some big

tank there.

HECTOR

He's gonna live?

KELLY

Yeah.  Thanks to you.

HECTOR

And Hank.

(to Keough)

I know you weren't really trying to

hit him.

KEOUGH

(gently)

I was aiming for you.

HECTOR

Thanks for the rescue.

JACK

You take care.

HECTOR

You talk to Bickerman?

JACK

She didn't tell us about the other

croc 'cause she was afraid we'd

blow it's head off.

HECTOR

Women's intuition.  Are there

anymore?

JACK

Just those two.

PARAMEDIC

We gotta take him.

JACK

Okay.

PARAMEDIC

We got room for one.

JACK

Well... I got stuff to pack up

and...

KEOUGH

(grudging)

I'll go.

KEOUGH

Thanks for your help.

JACK

You too.

KELLY

I'm sure this would offend you on

principal but... could we keep in

touch?

KEOUGH

I guess.

KELLY

Well...

JACK

You wanna ride in my truck?

GARE

(arriving)

Your truck is jammed.  Should we

take some stuff out?

KELLY

No, no, I'll be a while anyway.

I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.

JACK

You sure?  I don't mind...

KELLY

No, I actually want to stay for a

little while.

KELLY (CONT'D)

I'll miss you most of all

scarecrow.

JACK

If I'm ever in New York...

KELLY

Yeah.

JACK

Y'know, if we didn't live in

separate worlds and...

(a beat)

KELLY

But we do.

(then)

Hey, we'll always have Maine.

JACK

It was... something meeting you.

KELLY

Likewise.

DISSOLVE TO:

JACK

I thought I should say goodbye to

the lake too.

KELLY

(weakly)

Different worlds, Jack.

JACK

Yeah, I thought about that as I was

driving... and... I haven't found

somebody in my world.  You found

anyone in yours?

KELLY

No.

JACK

So I was thinking... maybe if I met

anybody in my world who was good

for you and if you know somebody in

New York good for me, we could fix

each other up.

KELLY

You think?

JACK

Worth a try.  We don't wanna be

alone forever, do we?

KELLY

Probably not.

JACK

That was... y'know if the guy asks

me can she kiss, now I'll be able

to tell him if you can.

KELLY

Good thinking.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BICKERMAN

Cute little Buttons.  Mommy loves

you.  Come eat your supper little

buttons.  Nibble Mommy's toes.

FADE OUT.
