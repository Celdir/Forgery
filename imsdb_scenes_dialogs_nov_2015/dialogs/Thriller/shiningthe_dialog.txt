THE INTERVIEW.

CUT TO:

2.

JACK

Hi, I've got an appointment with Mr.

Ullman.  My name is Jack Torrance.

RECEPTIONIST

His office is the first door on the

left.

JACK

Thank you.

JACK

Mr. Ullman?

ULLMAN

Yes?

JACK

I'm Jack Torrance.

ULLMAN

Oh, well - come on in Jack.

ULLMAN

Very nice to meet you.

JACK

Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.

ULLMAN

This is my secretary, Susie.

SECRETARY

Hallo.

JACK

Susie, how do you do?

3.

ULLMAN

Have any trouble finding us?

JACK

Oh, no problem at all.  I made the

trip in three and a half hours.

ULLMAN

Well, that's very good time, very

good.  Please sit down a minute.

ULLMAN

JAck, just make yourself at home.

Would you like some coffee?

JACK

Well, if you are going to have

some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.

ULLMAN

Susie.

SECRETARY

Sure.

ULLMAN

Oh, and would you ask Bill Watson

to join us?

SECRETARY

Yes, I will.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

DANNY

Mom...

4.

WENDY

Yeah.

DANNY

Do you really want to go and live

in that hotel for the winter?

WENDY

Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.

DANNY

Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's

hardly anybody to play with around

here.

WENDY

Yeah, I know.  It always takes a

little time to make new friends.

CUT TO:

DANNY

Yeah, I guess so.

CUT TO:

WENDY

What about Tony?  He's looking

forward to the hotel, I bet.

CUT TO:

TONY

NO, I ain't Mrs. Torrance.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Oh come on, Tony.  Don't be silly.

CUT TO:

5.

TONY

I don't want to go there, Mrs.

Torrance.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Well, how come you don't want to go?

CUT TO:

TONY

I just don't.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Well, let's just wait and see.

We're all gonna have a real good

time.

DISSOLVE TO:

ULLMAN

Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack

Torrance.

WATSON

How do you do?

JACK

Bill, how do you do?

WATSON

Pleased to meet you.

JACK

Pleasure to meet you.

ULLMAN

Grab a chair Bill, and join in.

6.

ULLMAN

Jack is going to take care of the

Overlook for this winter.  I would

like you to take him around the

place as soon as we are through.

WATSON

Fine.

ULLMAN

Jack is a schoolteacher.

CUT TO:

JACK

Eh - formerly a school-teacher.

WATSON (OFF)

What line of work are you in now?

JACK

I'm a writer um... Teaching has

been more or less a way of making

ends meet.

CUT TO:

WATSON

Well this ought to be quite a

change for you.

CUT TO:

JACK

Well, I'm looking for a change.

ULLMAN (OFF)

Our people in Denver recommended

Jack very highly, and, for once, I

agree with them.

CUT TO:

7.

ULLMAN

Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I

was about to explain that eh... our

season here runs from oh May 15th

to October 30th and then we close

down completely until the following

May.

CUT TO:

JACK

Do you mind if I ask why you do

that?  It seems to me that the

skiing up here would be fantastic.

ULLMAN (OFF)

Oh, it sure would be

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

but the problem is the enormous

cost it would be to keep the road

to the Sidewinder open.  It's a...

It's a 25 mile stretch of road -

gets an average of 20 feet of snow

during the winter, and there's just

no way to make it economically

feasible to keep it clear.  When

the place was built in 1907, there

was very little interest in winter

sports, and this site was chosen

for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

CUT TO:

JACK

Well, it's certainly got plenty of

that.

ULLMAN

That's right.  And did they give

you any idea in Denver about what

the job entails?

8.

JACK

Only in a very general way.

ULLMAN

Well...

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

...the winters can be fantastically

cruel, and the basic idea is

to...to cope with the very costly

damage and depreciation which can

occur.  And this consists mainly of

running the boiler, heating

different parts of the hotel on a

daily rotating basis, repairing

damage as it occurs and doing

repairs, so that the elements can't

get a foothold.

CUT TO:

JACK

Well, that sounds fine to me.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Physically, it's not a very

demanding job.  The only thing that

can get a bit trying up here during

the winter is eh... the tremendous

sense of isolation.

CUT TO:

JACK

Well, that just happens to be

exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm

eh... I'm outlining a new writing

project, and eh...

(MORE)

9.

JACK (CONT'D)

five months of peace is just what I

want.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

That's very good Jack, because eh...

for some people eh solitude and

isolation...

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)

can of itself be a problem.

JACK

Not for me.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

How about your wife and son?  How

do you think they'll take to it?

CUT TO:

JACK

They'll love it.

ULLMAN (OFF)

Great...

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Well, before I turn you over to

Bill, there is one other thing I

think we should talk about.  I

don't want to sound melodramatic,

but it is something that's...

(MORE)

10.

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

been known to give a few people

second thoughts about the job.

CUT TO:

JACK

I'm intrigued.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

I don't suppose they eh told you

anything in Denver about the

tragedy we had up here during the

winter of 1970?

CUT TO:

JACK

I don't believe they did.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (OFF)

Well, my predecessor in this job

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

hired a man named Charles Grady, as

the winter caretaker.  He came up

here with his wife and two little

girls of about eight or ten.  And

he had a good employment record,

good references and from what I've

been told, I mean, he seemed like a

completely normal individual.  But

at some point during the winter, he

must have suffered some kind of a

complete mental breakdown.

(MORE)

11.

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

He ran amok and eh... killed his

family with an axe,

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)

stacked them neatly in one of the

rooms in the West Wing, and then he

um... then he put eh both barrels

of his shotgun in his mouth.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

The police eh... they thought that

it was what the old-timers used to

call cabin-fever, a kind of

claustrophobic reaction which can

occur when people are

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)

shut in together over long periods

of time.

JACK

Well, that is eh quite a story.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Yes, it is.  Oh, it's still hard

for me to believe that it actually

happened here, but it did and eh...

I think you can appreciate why I

wanted to tell you about it.

CUT TO:

12.

JACK

Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I

also understand why your people in

Denver left it for you to tell me.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Well, obviously some people can be

CUT TO:

ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)

put off by the idea of staying

alone in a place where something

like that actually happened.

JACK

Well, you can rest assured Mr.

Ullman, that's not going to happen

with me, and eg as far as my wife

is concerned, I am sure she'll be

absolutely fascinated when I tell

her about it.  She's a confirmed

ghost story and horror film addict.

DISSOLVE TO:

DANNY

Tony, do you think Daddy will get

the job?

TONY (OFF)

Yeah, he did.  He's gonna phone

Wendy up in a few minutes to tell

her.

CUT TO:

13.

WENDY

(into phone)

Hello.

CUT TO:

JACK

(into phone)

Hi, babe.

WENDY

(over phone)

Hi, hon.  How's it going?

JACK

(into phone)

Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and

I still have an awful lot to go

through.  I don't think I can get

home before nine or ten.

CUT TO:

WENDY

(into phone)

Sounds like you got the job?

CUT TO:

JACK

(into phone)

Right it's a beautiful place.  You

and Danny are gonna love it.

14.

DANNY

Tony, why don't you want to go to

the hotel?

TONY (OFF)

I don't know.

DANNY

You do too know, now come on tell me.

TONY (OFF)

I don't want to.

DANNY

Please...

TONY (OFF)

No.

DANNY

Now Tony, tell me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

15.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR (OFF)

Now hold your eyes still so that I

can see.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

That's good, now the other one.

Good boy.

DOCTOR

Now Danny, when you were brushing

your teeth, do you remember if you

smelled anything funny, or saw any

bright flashing lights, or anything

at all strange?

CUT TO:

DANNY

No.

DOCTOR (OFF)

Do you remember when you were

brushing your teeth?

DANNY

Yes.

CUT TO:

16.

DOCTOR

What's the next thing you remember

after you were brushing your teeth?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up,

wake up Danny, wake up.'

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Now Danny, can you remember what

you were doing just before you

started brushing your teeth?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Talking to Tony.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Is Tony one of your animals?

CUT TO:

DANNY

No.  It's the little boy that lives

in my mouth.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Tony is his imaginary friend.

17.

DOCTOR (OFF)

Oh,

CUT TO:

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

if you were to open your mouth now,

could I see Tony?

CUT TO:

DANNY

No.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Why not?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Because he hides.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Where does he go?

CUT TO:

DANNY

To my stomach.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Does Tony ever tell you to do things?

18.

DANNY

I don't want to talk about Tony

anymore.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Okay.  That's fine.  All right Danny.

DOCTOR

Now I'm going to ask you to do me a

favor, and stay quietly in bed for

the rest of the day.  Okay?

DANNY

Do I have to?

DOCTOR

Yes, I'd like you to.

WENDY

We're just going to go into one of

the other rooms for a few minutes

and talk - then I'll come back and

check on you, okay?

DANNY

Okay.

DOCTOR

Goodbye.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Shall we go into the living room?

DOCTOR

Yes.

19.

WENDY

Please...

DOCTOR

Thank you.

DOCTOR

Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you

have anything to worry about.  I'm

quite sure there is nothing

physically wrong with Danny.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems

absolutely fine now, but you should

have seen him.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Oh I know.  Kids can scare you to

death, but believe me these episodes

are not at all uncommon, and they

look much worse than they are.

CUT TO:

WENDY

But eh what was the matter with him?

DOCTOR

Mrs. Torrance, most of the time

these episodes with kids are never

explained.  They are brought on by

emotional factors, and they rarely

occur again.

CUT TO:

20.

DOCTOR

They're more akin to auto-hypnosis,

a kind of self induced trance.  If

it re-occurs which I doubt

CUT TO:

DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)

you can always think about having

some tests done.

DOCTOR (OFF)

No thank you.

WENDY

Oh, I'm...I'm sure you're right.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs.

Torrance?

CUT TO:

WENDY

Only about three months.  Eh we're

from Vermont.  My husband was

teaching school there.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Did the appearance of Danny's

imaginary friend...?

CUT TO:

21.

WENDY

Tony.

DOCTOR

Did Tony's first appearance happen

to coincide with your arrival here?

CUT TO:

WENDY

No, um let's see I guess Danny

started talkin to Tony about the

time we put him into nursery school.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Did he adjust well to school?

CUT TO:

WENDY

No.  He didn't like it too much at

first, and then he had an injury,

so we kept him out for a while,

and, yeah, I...I guess that's about

the time when I first noticed that

he was talking to Tony.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

What sort of injury did he have?

CUT TO:

WENDY

Ah he dislocated his shoulder.

22.

DOCTOR (OFF)

How did he manage to do that?

WENDY

Well it's just one of those things.

You know... purely an accident, um.

My husband had oh... been drinking,

and he came home about three hours

late, so he wasn't exactly in the

greatest mood that night.  And well

Danny had scattered some of his

school papers all over the room...

and my husband grabbed his arm, you

know, and pulled him away from them.

It's...it's just the sort of thing

you do a hundred times with a

child - you know, in a park or on

the streets - but on this particular

occasion my husband just... used

too much strength and he injured

Danny's arm.

CUT TO:

WENDY (OFF) (CONT'D)

Anyway, something good did come out

of it all because he said:

CUT TO:

WENDY (CONT'D)

"Wendy, I'm never gonna touch

another drop and if I do you can

leave me", and he didn't and he

hasn't had any alcohol in eh five

months.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

23.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Boy, we must be really high up.

The air feels so different.

JACK

Uh...huh.

DANNY

Dad?

JACK

Yes?

DANNY

I'm hungry.

JACK

Well you should have eaten your

breakfast.

WENDY

We'll get something as soon as we

get to the hotel, okay?

DANNY

Okay, Mom.

WENDY

Hey, wasn't it around here that the

Donner party got snowbound?

JACK

I think that was farther west in

the Sierras.

DANNY

What was the Donner party?

24.

JACK

There were a party of settlers in

the covered wagon times.  They got

snowbound one winter in the

mountains.  They had to resort to

cannabilism in order to stay alive.

DANNY

You mean they ate each other up?

JACK

They had to, in order to survive.

WENDY

Jack...

DANNY

Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about

cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.

JACK

See, it's okay.  He saw it all on

the television.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

What time does the plane leave?

WATSON

Eight thirty.

ULLMAN

Well, that still gives up plenty of

time to go over everything first.

25.

GIRLS

Goodbye Mr. Ullman.

ULLMAN

Goodbye.

ULLMAN

Good morning Jack.  I hope you

haven't been waiting too long.

JACK

No problem.  In fact we had time to

grab a bite to eat.

ULLMAN

Good.  Glad you made it before they

shut down the kitchen.  Is your

family having a look around?

JACK

No, my son's discovered the games

room.

ULLMAN

Oh... Has your luggage been brought

in?

JACK

Right there.

ULLMAN

Oh fine.  Well in view of all the

ground that we to cover today, I

suggest we go and have a quick look

at your apartment and then get

started straight away.

ULLMAN

Bill, would you have the Torrances'

things brought in their apartment.

WATSON

Fine.

26.

JACK

I'd better collect my family first.

ULLMAN

Oh...

DISSOLVE TO:

ULLMAN

This is our Colorado Lounge.

WENDY

Oh, it's beautiful.

(to Jack)

My God, this place is fantastic,

isn't it hon?

JACK

Sure is.

WENDY

God, I've never seen anything like

this before.  Are all of these

Indian designs authentic?

ULLMAN

Yes, I believe they are based

mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

WENDY

Oh well they're really gorgeous.

As a matter of fact this is probably

the most gorgeous hotel I've ever

seen.

ULLMAN

Oh this old place has had an

illustrious past.  In its heyday it

was one of the stopping places for

the jet set,

27.

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

even before anybody knew what a jet

set was.  We've had four presidents

who stayed here, lots of movie stars.

WENDY

Royalty?

ULLMAN

All the best people.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

This is the staff wing of the hotel.

None of the other bedrooms are

heated during the winter.

WENDY

Oh!

28.

GIRLS

Goodbye Mr. Ullman.

ULLMAN

Goodbye girls.

ULLMAN

And here are your quarters.

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Living Room, bedroom, bathroom, and

a small bedroom for your son.

JACK

Perfect for a child.

WENDY

Yeah.

ULLMAN

Yes.

ULLMAN (OFF)

Well the place is very nicely self-

contained, easy to keep.

JACK

Cosy.

29.

ULLMAN (OFF)

Yes, very cosy for a family, and if

you feel like spreading out you

have the rest of the hotel to move

around in.

JACK

Well, it's very... homely.

WENDY

Yeah.

DISSOLVE TO:

ULLMAN

This is our famous hedge maze.

It's quite an attraction around

here.  The walls are thirteen feet

high and the hedges are about as

old as the hotel itself.  It's a

lot of fun,

ULLMAN (CONT'D)

but I wouldn't go in there unless I

had an hour to spare to find my way

out.

WENDY

When was the Overlook built?

CUT TO:

ULLMAN

Ah... construction started in 1907.

It was finished in 1909.  The site

is supposed to be located on an

Indian burial ground, and I believe

they actually had to repel a few

Indian attacks as they were building

it.

30.

ULLMAN

That's our Snowcat.  Can you both

drive a car?

JACK & WENDY

(together)

Yes.

ULLMAN

That's fine because basically the

Snowcat operates very much like a

car and it won't take you long to

get the hang of it.

DISSOLVE TO:

ULLMAN

As a matter of fact we eh...

brought a decorator in from Chicago

just last year to refurbish this

part of the hotel.

WENDY

Oh well he sure did a beautiful job.

Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

ULLMAN

Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.

WENDY

Oh, I'll say.

ULLMAN

We can accommodate up to three

hundred people here very comfortably.

WENDY

Boy, I bet you we could really have

a good party in this room, huh hon?

31.

ULLMAN

I'm afraid you're not going to do

too well here unless you've brought

your own supplies.  We always

remove all the booze from the

premises when we shut down:

ULLMAN

that reduces the insurance that we

normally have to carry.

JACK

We don't drink.

ULLMAN

Well then, you're in luck.

ULLMAN

Oh Dick, come on over and say hello

to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

HALLORAN

Sure.

ULLMAN

This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.

JACK

Mr. Halloran, I'm Jack, and this is

my wife, Winifred.

HALLORAN

Glad to meet you, Jack.

HALLORAN

Glad to meet you, Winifred.

WENDY

Nice to meet you.

32.

ULLMAN

The Torrances are going to take

care of the Overlook for us this

winter.

HALLORAN

Oh, that's just great.  How do you

folks like our hotel so far?

WENDY

Oh it's just wonderful.

WENDY

Hi Danny!

CUT TO:

SUSIE

I found him outside looking for you.

JACK

(OFF)

Danny, did you get tired

(IN SHOT)

of bombing the universe?

DANNY

Yeah.

WENDY

Danny, come on over here.

WENDY

Thanks.

ULLMAN

Thank you, Susie.

33.

ULLMAN

Dick, if you're ready to do it now,

I think it would be a good idea if

you could show Mrs. Torrance the

kitchen, while I continue on with

Jack.

HALLORAN

It will be a pleasure.  Right this

way Mrs. Torrance.

WENDY

Great.  See you later, hon.

JACK

Bye darling.

DISSOLVE TO:

HALLORAN

Mrs. Torrance, your husband

introduced you as Winifred.  Now

are you a Winnie or a Freddie?

WENDY

I'm a Wendy.

HALLORAN

Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the

prettiest.

WENDY

God.  This is the kitchen, huh?

HALLORAN

Yeah, this is it.  How do you like

it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?

DANNY

Yeah, it's the biggest place I've

ever seen.

34.

WENDY

Yeah.  This whole place is such an

enormous maze, I feel I'll have to

leave a trail of breadcrumbs every

time I come in.

HALLORAN

Don't let it get you down Mrs.

Torrance - it's big but it still

ain't nothing but a kitchen... a

lot of the stuff you'll never have

to touch.

WENDY

I wouldn't know what to do with it

if I did.

HALLORAN

Well one thing for sure, you don't

have to worry about food because

you folks could eat up here a whole

year and never have the same menu

twice.

HALLORAN

Now right here is our walk-in

freezer.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Now this is where we keep all of

out meat.  You got fifteen rib

roasts - thirty ten pound bags of

hamburgers.  You got twelve-

turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and

twenty legs of lamb.

(to Danny)

Do you like lamb, Doc?

DANNY

No.

35.

HALLORAN

You don't?  Well what's your

favorite food then?

DANNY

French Fries and Ketchup.

HALLORAN

Well I think we can manage that

too, Doc.  Come along now.  Watch

your step.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Mr. Halloran,

WENDY (CONT'D)

how did you know we called him 'Doc'?

HALLORAN

Beg pardon?

WENDY

Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice

just now.

HALLORAN

I did?

WENDY

Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes,

you know, like in the Bugs Bunny

cartoons.  But how did you know that?

HALLORAN

Well I guess I probably heard you

call him that.

36.

WENDY

Well, it's possible, but I honestly

don't remember calling him that

since we've been with you.

HALLORAN

Well anyway, he looks like a Doc,

doesn't he?

HALLORAN

(clicks his tongue)

Me ah - what's up, Doc?

HALLORAN

Now this is the storeroom.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

In here, Mrs. Torrance, is where we

keep all the dried goods and the

canned goods.  We got canned fruits

and vegetables; canned fish and

meats; hot and cold cereals.

HALLORAN

Post Toasties, Cornflakes, Sugar

Puffs, Rice Krispies, Oatmeal,

Wheatina and Cream of Wheat.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN (OFF)

We got a dozen jugs of black

molasses, we got sixty boxes of

dried milk, thirty twelve pound

bags of sugar.

CUT TO:

37.

HALLORAN

(thought transfer)

How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

CUT TO:

HALLORAN (OFF)

sociables, finger rolls and seven

kinds of what-have-you.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Now we got dried peaches, dried

apricots, dried raisins and dried

prunes.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

You know, Mrs. Torrance, you gotta

keep regular, if you want to be

happy.

ULLMAN

Hi.

WENDY

Hi.

ULLMAN

How're you getting on?

HALLORAN & WENDY

Just fine.

38.

ULLMAN

Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance

for a few minutes?  We're on our

way through to the basement - I

promise we won't keep her very long.

HALLORAN

No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just

getting to the ice cream.

HALLORAN

Do you like ice cream, Doc?

DANNY

Yeah.

HALLORAN

I thought you did.

HALLORAN

You folks don't mind if I give

Danny some ice cream, while we're

waiting for you?

JACK

Not at all.

WENDY

No, we don't mind.

HALLORAN

Good.

WENDY

Sound good to you, Danny?

DANNY

Yeah.

WENDY

Okay.  You behave yourself.

HALLORAN

Now what kind of ice cream do you

like Doc?

39.

DANNY

Chocolate.

HALLORAN

Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.

DISSOLVE TO:

WENDY

It's amazing how much activity is

going on today.

ULLMAN

Yes, well the guests and some of

the staff left yesterday, but the

last day is always very hectic -

everybody wants to be on their way

as early as possible.

ULLMAN

By five o'clock tonight, you'll

never know anybody was ever here.

WENDY

Just like a ghost ship, huh?

ULLMAN

Yes.

DISSOLVE TO:

HALLORAN

Do you know how I knew your name

was Doc?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

40.

HALLORAN

You know what I'm talking about,

don't you?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

I can remember when I was a little

boy, my grandmother and I could

hold conversations entirely without

ever opening our mouths.  She

called it shining,

CUT TO:

HALLORAN (OFF)(CONT'D)

and for a long time I thought it

was just the two of us that had the

shine to us.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Just like you probably thought you

was the only one.  But there are

other folks, though mostly they

don't know it, or don't believe it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

How long have you been able to do it?

CUT TO:

41.

HALLORAN

Why don't you want to talk about it?

CUT TO:

DANNY

I'm not supposed to.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Who says you ain't supposed to?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Tony.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Who's Tony?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Tony's the little boy who lives in

my mouth.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Is Tony the one that tells you

things?

CUT TO:

42.

DANNY

Yes.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

How does he tell you things?

CUT TO:

DANNY

It's like I go to sleep, and he

shows me things but when I wake up,

I can't remember everything.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Does your Mum and Dad know about

Tony?

CUT TO:

DANNY

Yes.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Do they know he tell you things?

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Has Tony ever told you anything

about this place?  About the

Overlook Hotel?

CUT TO:

43.

DANNY

I don't know.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.

CUT TO:

DANNY

Maybe he showed me something.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Try to think what it was.

CUT TO:

DANNY

Mr. Halloran, are you scared of

this place?

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

No, I'm scared of nothing here.

It's just that you know some places

are like people, some shine and

some don't.  I guess you could say

the Overlook Hotel here has

something about it that's like

shining.

DANNY

Is there something bad here?

CUT TO:

44.

HALLORAN

Well, you know Doc, when something

happens it can leave a trace of

itself behind... say like is

someone burns toast.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN (OFF)

Well, maybe things that happened...

leave other kinds of traces behind.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Not things that anyone can notice,

but things that people who shine

can see.  Just like they can see

things that haven't happened yet.

Well, sometimes they can see things

that happened a long time ago... I

think a lot of things happened

right here in this particular

hotel - over the years, and not all

of them was good.

CUT TO:

DANNY

What about Room 237?

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Room 237?

CUT TO:

DANNY

You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?

CUT TO:

45.

HALLORAN

No I ain't.

CUT TO:

DANNY

Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Nothing.  There ain't nothing in

Room 237, but you ain't got no

business going in there anyway, so

stay out!  You understand, stay out!

Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast

What time is it?

WENDY

It's about eleven thirty.

Eleven thirty - Jesus!

WENDY

I guess we've been staying up too

late.

JACK

I know it.

WENDY

I made 'em just the way you like

'em, sunny side up.

JACK

Hmm, nice.

47.

WENDY

It's really pretty outside.  How

about taking me for a walk after

you've finished your breakfast?

JACK

Oh I suppose I oughta try to do

some writing first.

WENDY

Any ideas yet?

JACK

Lots of ideas.  No good ones.

WENDY

Well, something'll come.  It's just

a matter of settling back into the

habit of writing every day.

JACK

Yeah... that's all it is.

WENDY

It's really nice up here, isn't it?

JACK

I love it.  I really do.  I've

never been this happy, or

comfortable anywhere.

CUT TO:

WENDY

Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you

get used to such a big place.  I

tell you, when we first came up

here, I thought it was kinda scarey.

CUT TO:

48.

JACK

I fell in love with it right away.

When I came up here from my

interview, it was as though I had

been here before.  We...we all have

moments of deja vu, but this was

ridiculous.  It was almost as

though I knew what was going to be

around every corner.  Ooohhhhh...

WENDY

The loser has to keep American

clean, how's that?

DANNY

Look out - I'm coming in close.

All right?

DANNY (OFF)

You'll have to keep America clean.

WENDY

Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take

Okay...oh!

Okay.  I understand.  I'll come

you'll let me read something then.

CUT TO:

JACK

Wendy,

(clears throat)

let me explain something to you.

Whenever you come in here and

interrupt me, you're breaking my

concentration.

JACK (CONT'D)

you're distracting me,

JACK (CONT'D)

and it will then take me time to

get back to where I was, understand?

Fine.  Now we're going to make a

and you hear me typing,

JACK (CONT'D)

or whether you don't hear me

typing, whatever the fuck you hear

me doing in here, when I am in here

that means that I am working - that

means don't come in.  Now do you

think you can handle that?

CUT TO:

WENDY

Yes.

Fine.  Why don't you start right

Now I'm awfully glad you asked me

that, Lloyd, because I just happen

to have two twenties and two tens

right here in my wallet.  I was

afraid they were going to be there

until next April.  So here's what:

you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a

glass and some ice.  You can do

that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not

to busy, are you?

No, sir.  I'm not busy at all.

I did hurt him once, okay?  It was

an accident, complete unintentional.

It could have happened to anybody.

JACK

And it was three goddam years ago.

The little fucker had thrown all my

papers all over the floor.  All I

tried to do was to pull him up.  A

momentary loss of muscular

coordination.  I mean... A few

extra foot pounds of energy, per

Are you out of your fucking mind?

CUT TO:

No.  It's the truth, really.  I

forecasters predict more snow and

heavy winds tonight and tomorrow,

I'm the kind of man likes to know

It's not a matter that concerns

you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at

this point.

JACK

Anything you say, Lloyd.  Anything

GRADY

Oh!

GRADY

Oh dear, oh dear.  I'm so sorry,

sir.  Oh!

GRADY

Oh dear oh dear... I've made an

awful mess of your jacket, sir.

JACK

Oh eh that's all right.  I've got

plenty of jackets.

GRADY

I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It

tends to stain.

JACK

Advocaat is it?

GRADY

Yes sir.  Look um... I think the

best thing is to come along to the

gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...

GRADY

we'll get some water to it, sir.

JACK

Looks as though you might have got

a spot of it on yourself there,

Jeevesy old boy.

GRADY

That doesn't matter, sir.  You're

the important one.

JACK

Awfully nice of you to say.  Of

course I intend to change my jacket

this evening before the fish and

goose soiree.

91.

GRADY

Very wise, sir.  Very wise.

JACK (OFF)

Here, I'll just, eh...

CUT TO:

JACK

hold this for you there, Jeevesy.

GRADY

Thank you, sir.  Thank you.

GRADY

Now let's see if we can improve

this with a little water, sir.

JACK

Right, I'll just set my bourbon and

advocaat down right there.

GRADY

Won't keep you a moment, sir.

JACK

Fine.

JACK

What do they call you around here,

Jeevesy?

92.

GRADY

Grady, sir.  Delbert Grady.

CUT TO:

JACK

Grady?

GRADY

Yes, sir.

JACK

Delbert Grady.

GRADY

That's right, sir.

JACK

Eh, Mr. Grady...

JACK (CONT'D)

haven't I seen you somewhere before?

GRADY

Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.

GRADY

Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.

JACK

Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once

the caretaker here?

GRADY

Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.

JACK

You er a married man, are you, Mr.

Grady?

93.

GRADY

Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two

daughters, sir.

JACK

And, er... where are they now?

GRADY

Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm

not quite sure at the moment, sir.

JACK

Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker

here.  I recognize you.  I saw your

picture in the newspapers.  You

eh... chopped your wife and

daughters up into little bits, and

eh... and you blew your brains out.

CUT TO:

GRADY

That's strange, sir.  I don't have

any recollection of that at all.

Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker

here.

CUT TO:

GRADY

I'm sorry to differ with you, sir,

but you are the caretaker.  You

have always been the caretaker, I

should know, sir.  I've always been

here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

94.

GRADY

Did you know, Mr. Torrance, that

your son... is attempting to bring

an outside party into this situation?

Did you know that?

CUT TO:

JACK

No.

CUT TO:

GRADY

He is, Mr. Torrance.

CUT TO:

JACK

Who?

CUT TO:

GRADY

A nigger.

CUT TO:

JACK

A nigger!

CUT TO:

GRADY

A nigger cook.

CUT TO:

95.

JACK

How?

CUT TO:

GRADY

Your son has a very great talent.

I don't think you are aware how

great it is, but he is attempting

to use that very talent against

your will.

CUT TO:

JACK

Well, he is a very willful boy.

CUT TO:

GRADY

Indeed, he is, Mr. Torrance.  A

very willful boy.  A rather naughty

boy, if I may be so bold, sir.

CUT TO:

JACK

It's his mother.

JACK

She eh... interferes.

CUT TO:

GRADY

Perhaps they need a good talking

to, if you don't mind my saying so.

Perhaps a bit more.

CUT TO:

96.

GRADY (OFF)

My girls, sir, they didn't care for

the Overlook at first.  One of them

actually stole a packet of matches

CUT TO:

GRADY (CONT'D)

and tried to burn it down.  But I

corrected them, sir.  And when my

wife tried to prevent me from doing

my duty I corrected her.

WENDY

(to herself)

We have the Snowcat.  If the

weather breaks, we might just be

able to get down the mountain in

that.

WENDY

(to herself)

I could call the Forest Rangers

first and then tell them that we're

coming so that they could start

searching for us, in case we didn't

make it.

97.

WENDY

(to herself)

If Jack won't come with us, we'll

just have to tell him that we are

going by ourselves.  That's all

there is to it.

CUT TO:

DURKIN

(into phone)

Well, the snow ploughs are keeping

things moving in town, but the

mountain roads are completely

blocked.

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

That means I'm going to need a

Can you fix me up with one?

What's the big deal about getting

up there today, especially in this

CUT TO:

HALLORAN

Larry, just between you and me,

we've got a very serious problem

with the people who are taking care

of the place.  They've turned out

to be completely unreliable assholes.

Ullman phoned me last night, and

I'm supposed to go up there and

find out if they have to be replaced.

CUT TO:

DURKIN

How long is it going to take you to

get up here?

storms like this, I guess the

entire airport will probably be

closed within the hour.  Yeah,

they're just not prepared.  The

storm will continue throughout the

day, and the national weather

service... has declared a stopmans
