CHAIRMAN

I think we can begin... First parole

request Carter "Doc" McCoy... is legal

counsel present?

LAWYER

Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr.

McCoy.

DOC

watching... taking it all in.

CHAIRMAN

(his voice a bored drone)

Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence

for armed robbery, first offense in the

State of Texas, wanted by the State of

Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and

armed robbery...

LAWYER

The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction,

Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr.

McCoy in connection with that case.

CHAIRMAN

(adjusting his papers)

That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has

served four years of his sentence. Prison

record satisfactory. Applied for parole

on September 5th of this year...

CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Remarks?

(CONTINUED)

3.

LAWYER

We would only again like to call the

committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's

satisfactory behavior as a prisoner.

CHAIRMAN

Notice is taken.

CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)

(continuing)

The Board met in closed chambers last

week... have you reached a decision

regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

DOC

His face is taut.

SECOND MAN

(seated near Beynon)

Request for parole is denied. The

prisoner may re-apply in one calendar

year.

DOC

lowers his eyes, then looks up at his

lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance.,

he shuffles the papers in front of him,

begins stuffing them into his briefcase.

CHAIRMAN

(still totally without emotion)

Very well. The next request for parole is

from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?

VOICE (O.S.)

Yes.

CHAIRMAN

Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years

for embezzlement of corporate funds.

CAROL

(big smile, she wants the

moment to be an upper)

Hello, Doc.

CAROL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.

CAROL (CONT'D)

It's been raining a lot the last few

days.

CAROL (CONT'D)

We'll try again.

DOC

No way. I've got to get out now.

DOC (CONT'D)

Do it now.

6.

AFTER A MOMENT:

CAROL

I want to see Jack Beynon.

SECRETARY

Go right in, Mrs. McCoy.

CULLY

SWAIN

No. Doc McCoy's old lady.

(CONTINUED)

CULLY

Jesus. Carol Ainsley?

SWAIN

The very same.

CULLY

The Doctor took out McGovern for her.

SWAIN

She only rides winning - Class easy

class.

ACCOUNTANT

Shut up.

BEYNON

How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

CAROL

Ready to talk about my husband, Mr.

Beynon.

BEYNON

So the good Doctor comes up again.

(then)

Please sit down.

CAROL

He's asked me to come and see you.

BEYNON

(handing her a drink)

Why? Can I help?

(CONTINUED)

8.

CAROL

Yes, I think you can.

ACCOUNTANT

Mr. Beynon will see you the day after

tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk.

DISSOLVE TO:

CAROL

Hello, Doc.

DOC

Hi.

CAROL

You okay?

DOC

(big smile)

I'm a lot better off than I was an hour

ago.

CAROL

You want to drive?

DOC

My license expired, let's get out of

here.

CAROL

Sure...

CAROL

I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair

done... the girl was slow.

DOC

It looks fine.

CAROL

Feel good?

(CONTINUED)

10.

DOC

Yeah.

CAROL

Where do you want to go?

DOC

I want to take a walk.

(CONTINUED)

11.

DOC

(pointing to the poster)

It doesn't look like that.

CAROL

What do you mean? You've never been

there.

DOC

I've been there every day for the last

four years.

DOC (CONT'D)

What's Beynon got set up?

CAROL

Small town, small bank, big money.

DOC

Where did you get those?

CAROL

I've been doing my homework.

DOC

Just like old times?

CAROL

Better than old times.

DOC

I hope so. I am not looking forward to

another stretch.

CAROL

I made a mistake. I'll never make another

one.

DOC

(after a moment)

Where did you get them developed?

(CONTINUED)

12.

CAROL

Assumed name... Houston.

DOC

Good.

CAROL

Half a million.

DOC

That Beynon's got a long arm.

CAROL

(after a moment)

What do you want for dinner?

DOC

Whisky and a peach.

CAROL

(as Doc eats a peach with a

sharp knife)

How does it taste?

DOC

Just the way I remembered.

DOC (CONT'D)

You been okay?

CAROL

Pretty good... Made a quick trip to

Oregon, saw my brother and the kids.

Figured it would be my last chance,

unless they wanted to travel.

DOC

How's Estelle?

CAROL

Fatter... some things never change.

(CONTINUED)

13.

DOC

Boring.

CAROL

Nothing's been boring since you found me.

DOC

(carefully)

That's not all of it.

CAROL

No. It's been a long time.

DOC

You go out much?

CAROL

After four years and now the question

comes up.

DOC

Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.

CAROL

(with warmth and a smile)

I'm still here, Doc.

DOC

(he is very tight)

Oh Christ...

(CONTINUED)

14.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

I guess I'm kind of...

CAROL

It's all right.

DOC

(explaining the obvious)

It's just been a while.

CAROL

We've got time. We've got a lot of time.

I can help you.

DOC

Wait... give me a minute.

CAROL

Sure.

DOC

I'll be okay.

CAROL

Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

DOC

Really?

CAROL

Really.

CAROL (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

DISSOLVE TO:

15.

CAROL

How was it?

DOC

Better than I remembered.

CAROL

I was going to fix you breakfast.

DOC

You were asleep.

CAROL

I bought you a lot of new things.

DOC

Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what

I've got.

CAROL

Suit yourself.

DOC

How much does Beynon get?

CAROL

$250,000 right off the top.

DOC

Is he straight?

CAROL

You got the parole, didn't you?

(CONTINUED)

16.

DOC

Thanks again.

(then)

I 'm glad you waited.

CAROL

(simply)

I couldn't have... much longer.

DOC

Yeah... I know.

CAROL

But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did

it. I got you out.

DOC

Why are you laughing?

CAROL

I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just

thinking of you made me laugh. I had a

lot of that. And other times that wasn't

enough. I had a lot of that too. I know

you find it hard to believe, I'm happy

just loving you.

DOC

That doesn't hurt.

CAROL

But sometimes I cried a lot too.

DOC

(trying to smile)

I didn't. I just waited.

CAROL

(deeply moved)

Want to cry now?

17.

DOC

You gotta be kidding.

BEYNON

Not at all, just a pleasant way to have

lunch.

BEYNON (CONT'D)

Glad to see you in civilian clothes.

DOC

All it takes is a long arm.

BEYNON

Hard to judge how these things happen.

The Parole Board almost never reverses

their decisions.

DOC

(sarcastic)

I guess it was because I was a model

prisoner.

BEYNON

This is the only time you and I meet in

public. Any business with me, handle it

with him...

BEYNON (CONT'D)

(continuing)

You're back with your own people now. Got

you some professionals.

DOC

(flat, hard)

I get my own help.

(CONTINUED)

18.

BEYNON

(quiet strength)

You run the job, but I run the show. You

got two weeks to set it up.

DOC

(nods to Cully, Swain and

Hayhoe)

What about them?

BEYNON

They're mine. The one with the moustache

is my brother. They stay out of it. We

stay clean.

BEYNON (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...

DOC

(to Rudy)

I heard about you. You work with Miller.

RUDY

You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.

DOC

Where?

RUDY

Chicago.

DOC

You were with him?

RUDY

Yeah. I got out.

(CONTINUED)

19.

DOC

(to Jackson)

What about you?

JACKSON

I was backup man on a payroll job.

(as Doc looks hard at him)

I hit some liquor stores... I drive good.

RUDY

I drive.

DOC

Sure,

(to Beynon)

You're working on the passports...

(as Beynon nods)

... and visas?

BEYNON

They will be ready. You guys do your job.

DOC

(irritated)

I'll take care of my end.

BEYNON

(big smile)

Stay clean.

20.

CAROL

I'd like an application for a checking

account.

DOC

(with a smile)

Could I get change for this fifty please?

21.

DOC

... Bank President, three tellers and one

guard...

CAROL

(cutting in)

Usually on the right side as you go in.

DOC

Nail him first, be careful he doesn't

panic and want to shoot somebody. Local

police have one car, a rover, shouldn't

be in the vicinity at the time we hit

unless it's answering an emergency

call... if the cop car shows up remember

it doesn't have any automatic weapons.

Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard.

Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of

range at forty yards. Then they're down

to their side guns.

CAROL

For exits off Main Street.

DOC

Should be light traffic that time of

day... the Bank Guard carries a .38.

These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.

(CONTINUED)

22.

DOC (CONT'D)

Just in case someone gets a shot off.

RUDY

I worked ten years without one, I don't

need one now.

DOC

Suit yourself.

RUDY

Okay. How many bank exits?

DOC

Two.

RUDY

What about the vault?

DOC

Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20

minutes before they start doing

business...

RUDY

Wire pull over?

DOC

One-inch stuff on a three-number

combination.

RUDY

I'm good at that.

DOC

I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back

up all the way...

RUDY

(smile)

Whatever you need.

DOC

Keep going over these. I don't want

anybody getting lost.

(CONTINUED)

23.

CAROL

(holding two passports and four

visas held together by a

rubber band)

If we are clean Gollie will take us over

at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to

try Laughlin at El Paso.

DOC

I'll hang on to these. We don't need them

till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any

questions?

RUDY

Aren't we going a little hard?

DOC

What do you have in mind?

RUDY

It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have

to be Dillinger for this one.

DOC

(a long look at Rudy)

Dillinger got killed.

DOC (CONT'D)

(to Accountant)

Tell Beynon I want no mistakes.

ACCOUNTANT

I understand.

DOC

Beynon has to be alone at the drop ...

one car at the ranch and that's it. I

won't have the money... she won't know

where it is until I'm sure it's clear.

ACCOUNTANT

He understands.

DOC

Make sure everybody does.

24.

CAROL

You know how I feel?

DOC

My mind's not on guessing games.

CAROL

Promise you won't laugh.

DOC

(shakes his head; smiles)

If it's funny I'm going to laugh.

CAROL

I feel like the night before the first

day of school.

DOC

That bad?

DOC (CONT'D)

You promised not to laugh.

CAROL

It will be such a relief not to have to

think about it any more.

DOC

Waiting's hard. You never learn how.

CAROL

You know I've actually gotten tired

waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.

DOC

At least you were outside.

CAROL

It doesn!t make much difference where you

are, if you're waiting, Doc.

(CONTINUED)

25.

DOC

Bullshit.

CAROL

I mean it.

DOC

I know you do. But it is different.

(before she can interrupt

suddenly up a notch)

It's different.

(quieting down)

We'll be all right tomorrow.

CAROL

We are always going to be all right

tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few

todays.

DOC

We're going to have a lot of those,

(easy, embracing her tightly)

We're just going to get the money and

then go all the way.

CAROL

(smiling at him)

... and live happily ever after.

ANGLES

DOC IS BEHIND CAROL, AT THE BACK OF THE

VAN. He wears a jacket and watch cap. Doc

is squatted down, quickly activating

another timing mechanism, checking the

clock-face on the bomb against his

wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous

movement, he places a bomb into the two

large grocery bags at his feet. After

burying the explosives within each sack,

he covers the bombs with crumpled

wastepaper.

not looking at Rudy)

Where's Jackson?

(CONTINUED)

38.

RUDY

(pointing his gun lazily at

Doc, supremely confident)

He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't

either.

CAROL

How did you know?

CAROL

What about the bank?

DOC

(after a moment)

Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.

(CONTINUED)

CAROL

Oh, Christ.

DOC

We got between four and five.

CAROL

(now noticing the road)

(flat)

I see it...

DOC (CONT'D)

They're looking for three men...

remember?

(big smile)

What's the problem?

ACCOUNTANT

I 'm here.

CULLY

Yeah.

HAYHOE

Yeah.

DOC

They checked in.

CAROL

Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave

his cut here --

(CONTINUED)

42.

DOC

Why?

CAROL

There are three men dead.

DOC

So what. I've got to give him his money.

That was our end of the deal.

CAROL

He might be ready to chop us up.

DOC

Do it my way.

DOC

Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

CAROL

I've never "been there... When we met it

was in his office.

CAROL (CONT'D)

(continuing; hesitant)

Do you trust him?

DOC

I just figure the percentages. He

wouldn't try a cross until he's got the

money.

CAROL

Let's send his cut back -- Just keep

going.

DOC

If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You

make a deal, you're always better keeping

your end up.

CAROL

I don't want to go there.

(CONTINUED)

43.

DOC

Do it my way.

DOC

You can wait here... I'll wrap it up

fast.

44.

BEYNON

Hello, McCoy.

DOC

Beynon.

BEYNON

(swishing the drink)

News said two persons killed.

DOC

Three... Rudy got ambitious.

BEYNON

And you got him...

DOC

That's right.

BEYNON

What about your wife?

DOC

What about her?

(moving right to the business

at hand)

Let's c ut up the money, I want to get

North.

45.

BEYNON

Your wife told me no one would be killed.

DOC

You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.

BEYNON

They may nail me into this now, McCoy.

DOC

That's your problem.

BEYNON

(smiles)

You know, you and I may be two of a kind.

DOC

No way. I always do my own work.

BEYNON

Here. I understand the way you feel. As a

matter of fact, you and I might share a

great many feelings...

DOC

(snaps the words)

I'm in a hurry.

BEYNON

You still don't get the picture do you?

I've always heard what a smart ass

operator you are.

DOC

No applause!

(CONTINUED)

46.

BEYNON

Let's examine the situation. One, an

extremely attractive woman. Then, there's

the woman's husband, a skillful bank

robber serving a long sentence in prison.

Three, a man with political influence, a

man who can easily get a parole for a

convict... why should he?

BEYNON (CONT'D)

(continuing)

A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious

reason. To rob a bank.

DOC

I knew that life didn't add up to the

obvious when I was 8.

BEYNON

(cautiously)

What do you add up to here?

DOC

One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000.

We only got a half a million.

BEYNON

A little more was taken out before.

(a beat)

My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr.

McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.

DOC

So we did that crackerbox... to cover for

you.

BEYNON

(smiles., nodding)

The obvious.

(as his smile fades)

But we are both not interested in that

right now.

DOC

No.

(a long beat)

My old lady must have made a lot of

promises.

(CONTINUED)

47.

BEYNON

Close... but it takes a hell of a lot

more than promises to pull the kind of

strings I pulled.

DOC

I bet.

BEYNON

You wouldn't have come here when you were

eight3 Mr. McCoy.

BEYNON (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Don't think too badly of her... After

all, you were in jail a long time and she

is a healthy young woman.

DOC

(riding over Beynon's words)

Get it over with...

48.

DISSOLVE TO:

DOC

Stupid.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Why didn't you tell me?

CAROL

There wasn't any way to explain it.

DOC

Yeah.

CAROL

You sent me to him.

DOC

When I got out, why didn't you tell me

where it was?

(CONTINUED)

49.

CAROL

What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler

Moore?

DOC

Who's she?

CAROL

She's on TV.

DOC

If you don't start telling the truth...

(breaks off)

CAROL

What do we do?

DOC

(quietly)

We keep going.

ACCOUNTANT

Let's go.

Kind of tricky, isn't it?

CAROL

Thank you.

DAPPER MAN

(toothy grin)

No trouble lady.

52.

RUDY

(to Harold)

What's the damage?

HAROLD

Collar bone is broken. No infection

yet... the bandages should be changed

twice a day.

RUDY

I got a nurse in mind.

HAROLD

(going along, oblivious to the

implication)

The glucose will begin working in half an

hour. You'll feel better then...

RUDY

(flashing a grin despite the

pain)

The three of us are going to do some

traveling. We're going to take your car

to El Paso.

HAROLD

That's not possible. We can't leave

here... we've got all this.

(CONTINUED)

53.

RUDY

Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

FRAN

(scared, but trying to be

friendly)

Just... tell us what you want.

RUDY

What kind of car do you have, Harold?

FRAN

(cutting in)

A Ford... We have a Ford.

RUDY

That's good. That's very good. Now

Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,

check the oil and tires, we don't want

any problems on the road. One more

thing... If anybody but you comes back...

RUDY (CONT'D)

(continuing)

She gets her clock fixed right away...

You understand that, Harold?

FRAN

You do what he says, Harold.

RUDY

After you come back I'll listen while you

make some phone calls, tell a few friends

you've got to leave for a week or two...

You have to call another Vet about the

animals. You tell him to come over and

take good care of them starting

tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got

to be looked after...

HAROLD

We really don't have too many friends.

(CONTINUED)

54.

FRAN

They don't think he married well.

RUDY

(smiling)

That makes things a little easier for us

then, doesn't it?

SOLDIER

Beer.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)

obvious)

Guess you have to catch a train?

THE SOLDIER

pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to

shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one

years old, not good-looking (his best

feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not

a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.

CAROL

(not too patronizing)

That's right.

SOLDIER

Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough

and I'm goin' home.

CAROL

Where's home?

SOLDIER

Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem,

right near Salt Lake ... Say, you

wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would

you?

(CONTINUED)

55.

CAROL

(chuckles)

No, I'm not.

SOLDIER

Me, neither. There's about twelve people

in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm

one of them.

CAROL

That certainly makes you kind of

special...

SOLDIER

(awkward)

Yeah... I guess it does.

SOLDIER (CONT'D)

(c ont inuing)

You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt

Lake, would you?

CAROL

(smiles across to him)

No, I'm afraid not.

SOLDIER

I never have any luck.

I really hope you have a nice trip.

Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

Where's the suitcase?

CAROL

A man helped me open it...

Two years.

I will...

RUDY

Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like

it, and when I tell you to come over here

you move fast. You and I are going to get

along because I've known a lot of people

like you, so don't tell me about it

CAROL

You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you,

Doc?

(rising tone)

If I was caught, wouldn't you?

CAROL (CONT'D)

(continuing - quietly)

When we had trouble before it was

different.

DOC

You don't like the way things are, I

don't like the way things

Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the

money with you.

No... I don't want to leave.

out tomorrow and buy yourself some new

clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some

food now, paper bag it, we eat in the

room.

CAROL

(cutting in)

You've got all the answers. What about

when they find the body on the train?

DOC

When they find it, they find it.

CAROL

You've got it all figured.

DOC

(looking at Carol and thinking

about Beynon)

No... there's a couple of things I'm

still working on.

CAROL

Like what?

(CONTINUED)

69.

CUT TO:

DOC

There may be a hunting party.

CAROL

Why, there's nothing on the news?

DOC

I didn't mean police.

CAROL

Tell me about it.

DOC

(calmly)

Loredo is out. I've been thinking about

Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay.

If Beynon bought him out...

CAROL

What?

(CONTINUED)

70.

DOC

If Beynon bought him out, and he talked

then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting

for us in El Paso.

CAROL

You're full of ifs.

DOC

I think you liked it with him.

CAROL

Maybe. At least I got to him.

Where do we go from here?

CAROL

And that could be all for you., baby.

DOC (CONT'D)

CAROL

If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would

have.

73.

DOC

I trust...

Want to see what I trust... In God we

trust...

(he pulls out a bill and points

at it)

The word's on every bill!!!

CAROL

(slamming the suitcase closed)

You keep it up and it won't matter how

far we get away, because it's going to be

all over between you and me. Do you

understand that? There won't be anything

left.

76.

RUDY

Have a bone, baby.

FRAN

That's okay, honey. Two cheeseburgers;

two coffees and a milkshake.

GIRL

Okay?

CAROL

I think so... I don't know.

DOC

It's not deep.

(CONTINUED)

88.

CAROL

No scars?

DOC

No scars.

DOC (CONT'D)

Don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an

infection.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Do what I tell you, it's not a game.

CAROL

It's all a game, don't bother me.

DOC

We better stick here till tonight.

CAROL

(down)

Yeah.

DOC

We're going to make it.

CAROL

(further down)

Sure...

DOC

I want to say something.

(CONTINUED)

89.

CAROL

(quiet defeat)

I don't want to hear it.

DOC

(softly)

Listen to me. It's hard enough.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Look, what you said yesterday... I guess

that was right. It isn't worth anything

if we don't make it together.

CAROL

I don't think we can any more... If we

ever get out of here, maybe I should take

off...

DOC

We got this far.

CAROL

We've come a lot of miles. But we're not

close to anything.

DOC

I guess you're right.

CAROL

I always thought jails make people hard.

Not you. You're just not tough enough to

forget about Beynon. I chose you, not

him.

DOC

Either we pick it up or else we leave it

right here. We got to go one way or

another.

CAROL

(setting the condition)

No more about Beynon.

DOC

Whatever happens it's over.

(CONTINUED)

90.

CAROL

(not trusting his mouth)

Sounds good.

DOC

You want to try with me?

CAROL

(smiling)

Things can't get much worse can they?

DOC

I don't see how.

CAROL

(finally talcing Doc's arm)

Okay.

DOC

(slow smile)

You and me.

CAROL

Can we make it?

DOC

We get to Mexico, we can have a life.

CAROL

That's all I want... It's the only thing

I have ever wanted.

DOC

I'm going to try and get it for you.

RUDY

(calling softly)

Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out

of there.

91.

LAUGHLIN

It's hard to figure. There's something

about the composition of the track at

Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any

speed horse, take a second off any other

track in the country.

92.

LAUGHLIN

(continuing)

... but a speed horse is the only thing

that consistently holds form. They got to

let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try

to rate 'em, just breaks their heart.

RUDY

Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live

or die.

RUDY (CONT'D)

Do what I tell you, you not only get to

live, but maybe you'll pick up some

money.

LAUGHLIN

(still breathless)

Just tell me.

RUDY

First things first. Main thing, you work

for me, otherwise I get you. If I don't,

six months from now one of my friends

will.

ACCOUNTANT

El Paso. Laughlin's. Rudy's arrived.

93.

LAUGHLIN

Sure, Doc. I can do it. Just like old

times... Yeah, it's a nervous way to

live.

DOC

Jimmy. How's it going?

LAUGHLIN

(shaking hands, laughing)

Good to see you, Doc.

(handing him a paper)

It's all there, departure, arrival -

everything except the $500.

DOC

How's Mama and the kids?

LAUGHLIN

Growing -- all of them - every day.

(then)

318, you'll be the only ones on the

floor.

DOC

My lady'11 come in in about five minutes.

Have some food sent up in half an hour.

LAUGHLIN

Just sandwiches...

DOC

Right.

(CONTINUED)

94.

DOC (CONT'D)

When she gets here, have that kid of

yours help her with the suitcase.

LAUGHLIN

He took the day off.

DOC

Then you do it.

LAUGHLIN

Can't leave the desk.

RUDY

Okay, Grunt, pick it up.

95.

DOC

We've got some food coming, should be

here any minute.

CAROL

Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.

DOC

Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across

at four A.M.

CAROL

(mild complaint)

Oh, Jesus... how?

(CONTINUED)

96.

DOC

Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen

miles east. He takes us to the Mexican

side, drops us off at the airfield by

breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock

flight.

CAROL

(smiles)

I'll be ready.

DOC

(down)

Yeah.

CAROL

What's wrong?

DOC

(shrugs)

I don't know.

CAROL

Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.

DOC

(smile)

Whatever you say.

97.

DOC

Get upI Carol's eyes snap open.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

We're moving now!

CAROL

What is it?

DOC

Laughlin. He's always got his family

around... that wife and kid of his have

to stand by his side to make sure he

stays off the juice and horses.

CAROL

So what?

DOC

If they are not here, he must have sent

them away.

CAROL

You're crazy.

DOC

(hard)

Get your clothes on, move your butt.

CAROL

Sorry. Look, I'm clean. I want to get

some rest.

(CONTINUED)

98.

CAROL (CONT'D)

(continuing; now at doorway)

Who is it?

FRAN

It's your food, I brought up your

sandwiches...

INSIDE 318

Carol standing near the door., looks at

Doc. He mouths and half-whispers:

DOC

Stall.

CAROL

Just leave it outside the door... I'm not

dressed right now.

FRAN

I can't do that, ma'am. You have to pay

now so I can pay back the boy that went

out and got the food...

CAROL

All right. You'll have to hold on a

minute, my husband's in the shower...

(CONTINUED)

99.

DOC

Open it up, it's me.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Come on, come on.

CAROL

Who was it?

DOC

Just get your clothes on...

100.

CULLY

Just tell us the room number.

CULLY

Now you want to tell me?

LAUGHLIN

McCoy's in 318., the other guy's in 420.

CULLY

Sure about that?

CAROL

Doc !

ACCOUNTANT

(calmly to his men)

Out here.

(CONTINUED)

101.

ACCOUNTANT

Just have her set it down.

DOC

You want it? Come and take it.

Get him.

106.

DOC

(.45 in hand, pointing)

SLIM

Suit yourself.

SLIM (CONT'D)

(grinning)

How was that?

DOC

(smiling in spite of himself)

Just fine.

SLIM

Where we go in1?

DOC

Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to

cross.

SLIM

Why not?

DOC

You okay?

CAROL

(nodding)

Where do we go from here?

DOC

I don't know, airport I guess.

(CONTINUED)

107.

CAROL

They will have our description before we

can get a plane.

DOC

(way down)

Yeah.

SLIM

I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are

you?

DOC

I kinda doubt it.

SLIM

That's good... I'll cooperate, don't

worry about that... yes sir, I've had

some trouble with the law myself.

SLIM (CONT'D)

Three years ago I dynamited some fish at

the reservoir.

CAROL

(beginning to laugh)

Oh my God.

SLIM

That little job cost me a hundred

dollars... didn't even get to keep the

fish.

DOC

(resigned to the insanity of

the moment)

Let's just get to the border.

SLIM

Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up.

'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.

DOC

Not now.

CAROL

How long before this car's hot?

DOC

(after a moment)

Pull over.

DOC (CONT'D)

(continuing)

Listen... how much money did you make

this year?

SLIM

(slightly offended)

What's it to you?

DOC

(patient)

Come on. How much?

SLIM

'Bout five thousand.

(CONTINUED)

109.

DOC

How about if I buy your car for ten

grand?

SLIM

You serious?

DOC

Sure am.

SLIM

And I keep my mouth shut?

DOC

That's what I want.

SLIM

I don't report the car and I don't know

either of you?

DOC

You got it.

SLIM

How about twenty thousand?

-DOC

How about thirty?

SLIM

(delighted)

Done, by God.

I can afford it, you know.

(CONTINUED)

110.

SLIM (CONT'D)

(continuing, leaning through

the window)

Hope you get to where you're going.

CAROL

Thanks. Hope you do too.

SLIM

By the way, you're getting a hell of a

car there, mister.

DOC

(laughs)

Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for

God's sake keep your mouth shut.

SLIM

(his pride hurt)

Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim

Canfield's lips are sealed, they're

sealed.

DOC

(smiles)

Go with God.

SLIM

One thing though... how do I explain this

to my wife?

CAROL

Tell her you robbed a bank...

Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it

a run.

way.

Why don't you try the news?

CAROL

No more news, from now on we're just

going to listen to music.

CAROL
