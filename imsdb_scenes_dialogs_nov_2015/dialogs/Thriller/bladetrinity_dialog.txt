BLADE : TRINITY

Over darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

Italo Calvino once said that myth is the

hidden part of every story, the buried

part, the region that is still unexplored

because there are as yet no words to

enable us to get there.

(beat)

But I was there for the end.  I took part

in it.  And I think my words can help shed

light on what happened.  My name is

Abigail.  This is our story.

SIX MONTHS AGO

MALE FIGURE

That's great. We've got dick.

(turning to the others)

Is there any reason we had to embark on

this cluster-fuck during the day?

DANICA

Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You

know that.

GRIMWOOD

What is this chicken-scratch?

DANICA

Cuneiform. Dates back about four

thousand years.

GRIMWOOD

So why here?

DANICA

Because this was the cradle of

civilization.  He would've been

comfortable here.

ASHER

I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another

dead-end.

WOLFE

I'm not so sure --

WOLFE

There's something beneath us.

ASHER

Is that a body --?

GRIMWOOD

What the fuck --?!

ASHER

Radio back-up.  See if they can open it

from the other --

WOLFE (0.S.)

Guys?

CUT TO:

DANICA

What's he been doing?

ASHER

Nothing.  Just sitting there since we

brought him here.

HENDRIX

(nervously)

Do you think we've got enough security?

DANICA

Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there -

there isn't an army in the world that

could keep us safe.  We didn't capture

him.  He allowed us to take him in.  You

understand?

(nodding to the door)

Now open up.

VOICE (O.S.)

Why have you woken me?

DANICA

Your people need you, Sire.

VOICE (0.S.)

(mocking)

"My people".  You think I'm your messiah?

Your Savior?

VOICE

What makes you think I wanted to be

brought back?

DANICA

Times have changed.  Science has made

great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament

you provide -- it can set us free now.

VOICE

I see.  And the one I killed earlier?  He

was vampire?

(off her nod)

You must forgive me.  It had been

centuries since I last fed.

DANICA

I understand.

VOICE

Then offer yourself to me, child --

(lifting her chin)

-- and let me quench my thirst again.

ASKER

Danica!  Are you alright --?!

DANICA

Let him out -- he wants to see what's

become of his world.

CUT TO:

LARRY

Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic

psychiatrist and author of the New York

Times best seller "Human Health: The Whole

Being Breakthrough".  Also with us is

Martin Vreede, Chief of Police.  They're

here for an hour and they'll take your

calls.  Next on Larry King Live.

LARRY

Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a

biochemist, isn't that right?

VANCE

Yes.  I've long believed that in order to

achieve true health, we have to reconcile

the body and the mind.  Of course that

also requires letting go of a lot of our

old notions and superstitions, which is

what my work is all about.

LARRY

Let's talk about that.  How do you account

for the fascination with things that go

bump in the night?  Movies, books,

videogames -- seems like we can't get

enough of our boogeymen?

VANCE

Monsters provide a means for us to

transfer our more primal and darker urges

into something external.  In the case of

vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues

like predatory rage and sexual sadism.

These are scary subjects for people to own

up to.

LARRY

So we pass the buck to someone else?

VANCE

Exactly.  Historically, people suffering

from medical conditions have always been

our psychological scapegoats.  In the

Middle Ages schizophrenia was often

attributed to demonic possession.

LARRY

And vampires?

VANCE

Well, there's a hereditary blood disease

known as porphyria that has symptoms

remarkably similar to the classic vampiric

traits.  People suffering from this

disease are anemic, they become sensitive

to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic --

LARRY

Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me

that's good for the heart.

(turning to Chief Vreede)

Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the

recent rumors we've been hearing about

vampires?

VREEDE

The only vampires I'm worried about are

the ones passing the bar exam.

(laughing)

Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you

think we'd be on to them by now?  The

truth is, our streets have never been

safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent

crime is down across the board.  If people

want to be concerned, they should focus on

criminals like Blade.

LARRY

Now who's this?  Tell me about him.

VREEDE

He's a sociopath we've been pursuing.

VANCE

Blade is a very disturbed individual.

Even the name he's chosen for himself is

troubling.  According to witnesses, he

operates under the belief that a vast

conspiracy of vampires live amongst us.

You have to look at the psychiatric

underpinnings here.  What does a person

like Blade really want?

Odds are, he's really trying to work out

some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's

slaying monsters, but he's really trying

to murder aspects of himself.

CUT TO:

ELLINGSON (O.S.)

No more bullets, Blade?  Guess it's time

for you to fall down and go boom.

BLADE

Whistler!  I'm on the Stonebridge

overpass at Clemons --

WHISTLER'S VOICE

Got it!  Heading eastbound, I'm just

beneath you --

WHISTLER'S VOICE

-- GO!!!

OLD WOMAN

I hope that wasn't a dog.

BLADE

Staked you with silver.  Why aren't you

ash?

GEDGE

Why aren't you smarter?  Not a vampire,

dumbshit -- set your sorry ass up --

WHISTLER (O.S.)

What the fuck happened tonight?

BLADE

How should I know?  He was human.

WHISTLER

You've been getting careless, Blade.  You

kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any

proof of their existence.  But something

like this, a human corpse, it's messy --

(shaking his head)

-- you better hope nobody IDed you.

WOMAN'S VOICE

It was horrible.  The one car crashed, and

then the guy in the coat was shooting the

other guy --

REPORTER

(on-screen)

That was just a taste of the mayhem that

occurred during tonight's brazen shoot-out

that left at least four people dead.  Now

apparently an anonymous citizen captured

the whole event on video --

HALE (O.S.)

Ray!  Heard we've got a lead!

CUMBERLAND

Book us a flight, Hale.  Time to take

these cowboys down.

WHISTLER (0.S.)

Pack of Reds and some matches.

WHISTLER

I'll take this too.

FBI AGENT

Subject is heading West.

CUMBERLAND

Got him.

WHISTLER (0.S.)

Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just

what we needed.

WHISTLER

Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all

over the papers, the television.  Media's

eating it up.

BLADE

Like I care?

WHISTLER

You should.  Something like this --

(gesturing to the tabloid)

-- taking out a human, even one working

for the vampires -- far as the rest of the

world's concerned, you're public enemy

number one.

BLADE

Didn't realize this was a popularity

contest.

WHISTLER

Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's

happening?!  The fuckers are finally

getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn

PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires

we have to worry about, we're gonna have

to take on the rest of the world too.

(beat, adamant)

They've got us on the run.  These last few

months we've barely been staying ahead of

the curve.

BLADE

You worry too much, old man.

WHISTLER

I've been doing this since before you were

born, Blade.  The moment you stop

worrying, you're dead.

WHISTLER

Since the day I found you, you've been

like a son to me.  I taught you everything

I know.

(beat)

But I'm tired.  You understand?

EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT

VOICE (O.S)

How about that one?

SECOND VOICE (O.S.)

No fatties.  They taste like Cheetos.

THIRD VOICE (O.S.)

What about that shrunken apple-head

beeyatch-a-saurus over there?

VOICE (O.S.)

Fucking blow me, man!

DINGO

C'mon, just pick one.

PROOF

Once you buy a prize, it's yours and

yours to keep.

FLICK

Got it, got it!  Baby on board!

DINGO

Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal.

DINGO

Hey, pretty lady.

PROOF

Sophisticated mama.

DINGO

Scream if this hurts, chica!

FLICK

--aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!

ABIGAIL

Scream if this hurts, chica.

WHISTLER

What is it?

BLADE

What you've been worrying about.

AGENT

On the floor!  ON THE FLOOR!

CUMBERLAND

Lock it down!  Keep them contained!

Some kind of self-destruct program!

They're fragging their hard drives!

CUMBERLAND

AGENT

Move a finger and you're dead.

WHISTLER

(flipping them off)

How 'bout this one?

AGENT #2

He's got something in his--

BLADE

WHISTLER!!!

CUMBERLAND (O.S.)

Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

BLADE

Who --?

CUMBERLAND

Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson

Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a

long time.

BLADE

Whistler --

HALE

Dead.  Just like all of your victims.

CUMBERLAND

How many people have you killed?  Thirty?

Forty?  A hundred?

BLADE

Those were familiars -- people who worked

for them --

CUMBERLAND

And by "them" you mean vampires, right?

I suppose next you'll be telling us that

Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So

what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy?

Maybe you can give us some pointers.

(counting on his ringers)

You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's

sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson?

Do those still work?

HALE

I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's

Jewish?

CUMBERLAND

That's a good point.  And does garlic work

on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need

saffron or something?

CUMBERLAND

You can keep doing your song and dance as

long as you want, Blade, but it's not

going to play.  You're a stone-cold

killer.  And you're sick as fuck.

VANCE (O.S.)

Let's leave the diagnosis to the

professionals.

VANCE

Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance.

I'm with the Department of Mental Health.

I've been charged with conducting a

psychiatric evaluation of you.

(to Cumberland and Hale)

Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few

moments alone?

VANCE

I imagine this must be very frightening

for you.  But I want you to know that I'm

here to help.  In order to do that,

however, I need to ask you some questions.

(beat)

Now.  Can you tell me what day it is?

VANCE

What about the President?  Do you know

who's in the White House at the moment?

BLADE

An ass-hole.

VANCE

(sighing)

Alright then, let's talk about vampires --

what can you tell me about that?

BLADE

There's nothing to tell.  They exist.

VANCE

And are you one of them?

VANCE

What about blood?   When you drink it, do

you find yourself sexually aroused?

VANCE

You see, it strikes me that this business

of vampirism has strong connotations of

sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being

exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have

to ask where that comes from.  I'm

wondering, for instance, what your

relationship was like with your mother.

Were the two of you close?

VREEDE

What's your assessment, Doctor?

VANCE

He's psychotic, with paranoid features,

possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy.

He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He

obviously doesn't have a properly formed

conscience --

(spreading his hands)

For his safety and the public's, I'm

recommending that he be transferred to

County Psychiatric for further treatment.

CUMBERLAND

That's unacceptable.  This man's wanted in

connection with a laundry list of federal

crimes.  I need him on a plane to the

Detention Center in Washington tonight.

VANCE

Agent Cumberland, that man is in no

condition to undergo prosecution.

HALE

Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant

here that clearly supersedes --

VREEDE

I don't care about your warrant.  We're in

my jurisdiction now.  You've got an issue

with that, you take it up with the local

magistrate.

VANCE

I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has

already been made.  A team from the

hospital should be here momentarily to

oversee the transfer.

DANICA

Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to

County General?

VANCE

(speaking softly now)

Just a little something to keep you

compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe

three hundred milligrams.  But for a

strapping young hybrid like yourself --

VANCE

-- I think we'll kick it up to a couple

thousand.

VANCE

There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?

(smiling)

You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your

serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human

like myself could overpower you?

BLADE

(realizing)

You're with them -- a familiar --

VANCE

Going on five years now.

VANCE

It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans

are finally coming to fruition.  So just

sit back and enjoy the show.

BLADE

He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working

for them!

CUMBERLAND

Just hold it right there --

DANICA

Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.

DANICA

We moved the humans around like, pawns,

Blade.  Used them to flush you out.

GRIMWOOD

Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we

get you out of here, you'll get a chance

to play.

DANICA

Don't make this any harder than it has to

be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can

help you now.

KING

Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?

KING

He kept biting his own lip.

DANICA

King!

KING

Let's FLY, kemosabe!

CUMBERLAND

He's getting away!

KING

Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!

KING

Whistler!  We need that serum NOW!

KING

Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake?

BLADE

Call me that again and I'll give you

fucking brain damage.

KING

We're pinned down!

(to Blade)

Can't you do something?!

BLADE

I can't shoot around corners!

ABIGAIL

I can.

BLADE

(as King and Abigail

freeze)

My sword.  They still have it.

KING

(apoplectic)

Are you insane?!  We're practically home

free!  We can't go hunting for your

fucking butter-knife now!

KING

Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is

supposed to be a rescue!

ABIGAIL

Forget it, King.  Let's move.

BLADE

Now we can go.

KING

(nudging Abigail)

Is he epic or what?

DEX

My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your

ass this evening.

DEX

We have him.  We'll be there soon.

KING

(to Blade)

So my entrance back there -- what do you

think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money?

BLADE

Who are you people?

KING

My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter,

like you.

(re: Abigail)

And this little hellion is Abigail

Whistler.

KING

That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing

things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You

see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part

of Whistler's "contingency plan".

KING

Juicyfruit?

BLADE

I thought the vampires murdered

Whistler's family.

ABIGAIL

They did.  I'm the product of an earlier

fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock.

After the murders happened, he kept me

hidden.  He wanted me safe.  Away from all

of this --

(gesturing around them)

-- but I guess hunting just runs in our

blood.

ABIGAIL

When I came of age, I tracked my Dad

down, told him I wanted in.

(beat, shrugging)

Been doing it ever since.

KING

Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

BLADE

(looking around)

How do you bankroll this place?

KING

Internet porn.  See, we're using cock

suckers to pay for the blood-suckers.

(off Blade's look)

Joke.  Come on, man.  This isn't some

piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade.

We take our jobs very seriously.

KING

You met Dex.  This is Hedges, Sommerfield--

KING

(nodding back)

The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's

daughter, Zoe.  We call ourselves the

Nightstalkers.

BLADE

You sound like rejects from a Saturday

morning cartoon.

KING

We were gonna call ourselves the Super

Friends, but that was taken.

ABIGAIL

Tiller needs adjustment.

HEDGES

I'll run it through the bow press.

BLADE

How many of you are there total?

KING

Enough.  We operate in sleeper cells.

When one goes down, a new cell activates

to pick up the slack.  Consider us your

reinforcements.

BLADE

Sorry.  Never been much of a team player.

SOMMERFIELD

I don't think you understand, Blade.

Whistler meant for us to help you.  When

he died, he activated an emergency

protocol.  All his knowledge --

SOMMERFIELD

--was transferred to our servers here.

BLADE

And what makes you think you know so much

about killing vampires?

KING

Well for starters, I used to be one.

(in a sinister tone)

Do I pass the audition?

CUT TO:

DANICA (O.S.)

Fucking Hannibal King!

DANICA

I should've ripped his ripped his

bleeding heart out when I had the chance!

(pointing at Asher)

And don't you dare tell me "I told you

so"!

ASHER

You through remodeling?

DANICA

Blow me.

ASHER

Face it, Dan.  We got caught with our

pants down.  We underestimated the

Nightstalkers.

GRIMWOOD

Pants down?!  They practically fucking

ass-raped us!

ASHER

Has he been told yet?

VOICE (O.S.)

About your failure?

MAN

Yes, I've been told.

MAN

Perhaps it's time I entered the fray.

CUT TO:

KING

You know the kind of woman that just

screams trouble? You see her and every

warning bell in your brain starts going

off but you still ask for her number?

Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But

this betty blew 'em all away in the

shitstorm sweepstakes.

KING

Her name's Danica Talos.  You met her

earlier.  The man on her left is Asher,

her brother.

KING

The neanderthal behind them is Jarko

Grimwood.

KING

I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one

night stand with her -- then spent the

next five years playing step-and-fetch-it

as her little vampire cabana boy.

(beat)

Eventually Abigail found me.  Sommerfield

here managed to treat me with a cure.  Now

I kill them.

(beat)

That's called turning a frown upside

down.

ABIGAIL

We need to pool our resources, Blade.

BLADE

Why?

ABIGAIL

Because He's come back.

BLADE

You gotta be kidding me.

KING

He's real, Blade.  Dig beneath all the

movies and myths.  All the layers of

bullshit that've cluttered our culture for

the last five hundred years and eventually

you'll strike the truth.

BLADE

(incredulous)

So the movies are true?

KING

(shaking his head)

The movies are just a comforting

fairytale compared to the real deal.

There's no happy ending with this guy.

Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the

last second and save the day with a cross

and some holy water.

(re: the comicbook)

See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a

nice yarn.  But the events he described in

1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic.

The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much

earlier than that.

BLADE

How early?

ABIGAIL

Try six or seven thousand years.

CUT TO:

KING (V.0.)

Dracula's only one of the names he's gone

by.  Now they call him Drake.  If you

believe the legends, he was born in

ancient Sumeria.

KING

Nobody really knows the specifics of his

origin.  But we do know this:  he was the

first of his kind.  The patriarch of the

hominus nocturna.

KING (V.0.)

Every single vampire -- every single

monster that's walked the earth since then

-- owes their existence to Him.

KING

He's like the Patient Zero of evil.  The

original Serpent in the Garden of Eden.

And just like the Great White shark, he's

never had to evolve.  This guy was born

perfect.  Scour the history books --

KING (V.0.)

-- read between the lines --

KING (V.0.)

-- you'll find countless references to

Him.  Always mentioned, never named.

KING (V.0.)

He's been there --

KING (V.0.)

-- moving behind the scenes --

KING (V.0.)

-- cutting a bloody path through the Ages

until suddenly --

KING (V.0.)

-- just like that --

KING

-- he up and disappeared.  About a century

ago the trail went cold.  Then we heard a

rumor.  The vampires were searching for

him -- trying to find the place where he'd

retreated.  According to our information,

they found him in Iraq about six months

ago.

(beat)

And he was pissed.

DRAKE

In the window -- you sell vampire

merchandise?

GOTH GUY

Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a

few things.

GOTH VIXEN

We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you

see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez

dispensers.  We've got just about

anything --

(selecting a vampire-

shaped vibrator, playful)

-- even vampire vibrators.

GOTH VIXEN

Here, check this out --

GOTH VIXEN

"Dracola".  Makes you want to cry,

doesn't it?

GOTH VIXEN

Was there something special you needed?

GOTH-GUY

Hey, guy, she's talking to you.

CUT TO:

BLADE

Why wake up Drake now?

ABIGAIL

That's what we've been trying to figure

out.

KING

When I was under the fang there used to be

talk about some kind of vampire 'Final

Solution'.  But I could never figure out

why they'd want to destroy their food

source.  I mean, seems stupid, right?

They've always had plans for the human

race.  Seems likely that whatever they're

cooking up, Drake's return is a part of

it.

KING (CONT'D)

Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a

losing battle.

So we kill a few hundred of them a year.

Big deal.  There are thousands of them out

there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need

a new tactic.

BLADE

Like what?

SOMMERFIELD

A biological weapon.

SOMMERFIELD (CONT' D)

For the last year I've been~working with

synthesized DNA in order to create an

artificial virus targeted specifically at

vampires.  We're calling it DayStar.

KING

Think about it, Blade.  We could wipe

them all out in a single move.

BLADE

So what's been holding you back?

SOMMERFIELD

(sighing)

We've tried it on a number of captive

subjects.  We've got the disease vector

worked out fine -- it's easily

transmittable.  But the lethality in

vampires is still spotty.

ABIGAIL

Bottom line is, we need a better DNA

sample to work with.

(beat)

We need Dracula's blood.

SOMMERFIELD

Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different

genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless

junk DNA.  Because Dracula's the

progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is

still pure.  It hasn't been diluted by a

hundred generations of selective mutation.

It still has all the necessary cellular

compounds for the virus to code to.  We

get his blood, we can boost Daystar's

viral efficacy to a hundred percent.

KING

So.  You want to join our club?  Can we

sign you up for a Nightstalkers secret

decoder ring?

CUT TO:

DRAKE

This world sickens me.  The humans have

soiled it with their filth.

DANICA

We can raze their cities to the ground.

We can bring the old world back.

DRAKE

Come closer.

DANICA

(re: light)

I can't.

DRAKE

And do you know why?

(off Danica's silence)

Once, all of my kind could brave the day.

We were true predators.  The world was

ours.  And then, somewhere along the way,

the purity of our bloodline became

diluted.  Polluted with human DNA.

DANICA

That's impossible --

DRAKE

Is it?

DRAKE

You are bastard children.  No longer as

pure as you pride yourselves on being.

DRAKE

My people.  How far you have fallen.

CUT TO:

HEDGES

We've got a wide assortment of ass-

kickery for your viewing pleasure --

(hefting a pistol)

Electronic pistol.  Comes with a built-in

fingerprint security system.  Fires a

three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second.

Bullets can also be triggered remotely.

BLADE

Explosive rounds?

KING

But with a concentrated burst of UV light

instead of your standard hollow-points.  I

call 'em sun dogs.

(to Hedges)

Hedges -- super-size me, baby!

KING

This little mamacita -- a modified

version of the Army's Objective

Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your

poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking

mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard,

this puppy will pump out.

(gesturing to Blade's

sword, sarcastic)

Of course it doesn't have the range of a

sword but --

HEDGES

We call this the UV arc --

HEDGES

You hold the arc in the center, curved

away from you.  Connecting the tips is a

powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its

high focus, the laser cuts through vampire

flesh like a knife through butter.

KING

We're still trying to sort out fact from

fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning

into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general

shape-shifting?  Maybe.

HEDGES

(off Blade's look)

Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like

that.  But another human, someone with the

same approximate body mass -- given enough

practice it might be possible.

BLADE

How?

HEDGES

He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal

structure.  Probably something more like a

snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the

place of a normal array.  Commensurate

with this would be an exquisite control of

electrical potential across his tissues,

resulting in an ability to effectively

change shape at will --

KING

(raising his hand)

Question.  Have you ever been laid,

Hedges?

BLADE

Time to apply some pressure.  The weak

link in the vampire chain of command has

always been their familiars.  Vampires

can't go out in the day, so they get

humans to do their dirty work for them

Blood-running, safe house maintenance,

whatever --

(climbing in the Cruiser)

We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll

lead us to the real thing.

KING

She's making playlists.  Likes to listen

to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal

soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip

hop, whatever kids these days are

listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G

VANCE

This is Dr. Vance.  Did someone page me?

CUT TO:

KING

Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite

Mick Jagger?

(off Blade's look)

Cause you can't get blood from a Stone.

KING (CONT'D)

Hey, they can't all be gems!

EDGAR VANCE, M.D.

PRESIDENT, VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING

NARRATOR

(on monitors)

Regain control of your life.   Wake to a

new dawn.  At the Vance Institute for

Whole Being we believe in an integrated

approach to human health.

VANCE

I'm Dr. Vance.  Welcome to our facility.

As a member of the medical profession I

want to assure you that I will do

everything in my power ro provide you with

the care and compassion that you deserve.

SECURITY GUARD

Excuse me, can I help y--

VANCE

What does it mean to be human?  Since the

dawn of creation our ancestors have asked

ourselves that question.

VANCE

The modern world today is filled with

countless challenges.  In every direction

we look, toxic stressors are impacting

upon our happiness.  We think we're

healthy, but the truth is, our immune

systems are engaged in a life or death

struggle to maintain our well being.

EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

I'm sorry but you can't --

VANCE

Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain

how a series of remarkable new

breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the

quality of your life

VANCE

What --?

BLADE

Payback, Vance.

KING

Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake!

BLADE FOLLOWS,

jumping onto the hood of another car. More

HORNS sound.

WOMAN

My baby

DRAKE (O.S.)

So you're the hunter they all fear.

DRAKE

(re: infant)

Just so we understand each other,

Daywalker.

BLADE

Why did you kill Vance?

DRAKE

He'd outlived his purpose.  He'd become a

liabi1ity.

DRAKE

Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before.

Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter

who carried it was an accomplished

fighter.

DRAKE

He was honorable, in his own way.  He

died a good death.

BLADE

I wouldn't know about that.

DRAKE

You lie.  You're part of a grand

tradition, Blade.  You hunters have

plagued my people since the day we first

walked the earth.  And I have vanquished

them.  One by one.

BLADE

How can you exist in the daylight?

DRAKE

I've always been able to.  Haven't you

read Mr. Stoker's fable?  I was the first

of the vampires.  I am unique.

BLADE

(realizing)

That's why they brought you back.

DRAKE

Yes.  My children seek to isolate the

properties in my blood that make me immune

to sunlight.  Through me, they believe

they can all become Daywalkers.

DRAKE

The world's changed much since I went to

sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at

them down there.  Lives brief as

fireflies.  Do you think they can ever

grasp what it means to be immortal like

us?

BLADE

You're not immortal.  I must've heard a

hundred of you people make the same claim.

And every one of them's seen the end of my

sword.

DRAKE

Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think

it's more likely that you will fall before

mine.

(beat)

Catch.

KING (O.S.)

Shit!

KING

Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire

again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?!

We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna

fucking lose.

BLADE

What's that?

ABIGAIL

Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic

protein.  Help me spread the wound open.

The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in

his body cavity from within --

KING

Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian

vampire say to the other?

ABIGAIL

Shut up, King.

KING

-- see you in twenty-eight days --

KING

Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say

we wipe the vampires out.  What happens

then?  You ever ask yourself that?

(weakly)

Somehow I don't picture you parked on a

porch with a jigsaw puzzle.

HEDGES

So basically we're in an arms race.

They're using Drake's DNA to build

themselves a better vampire --

BLADE

(noddin)

-- and we need his blood to kill them.

(to Sommerfield)

How's this weapon of yours coming along?

SODDERFIELD

We're almost there --

SOMMERFIELD

The virus is harmless to humans.  So we

decided to go after the vampires' food

source.  The one thing we know for sure

about vampires is that they have to drink

blood.

If we manage to pull this off, we'll be

able to contaminate every blood source on

the planet.  They won't have anyone left

to feed on.

ABIGAIL

Doesn't do us any good if we don't have

time to finish it.  We can't just sit

here.  We need to take the battle to them.

SOMMERFIELD

If the vampires are trying to isolate the

hereditary factor in Drake that makes him

immune to sunlight, they'll require

certain kinds of laboratory equipment and

provisions.  For instance, there's an

enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there

are only a limited number of suppliers.

(beat)

Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't

hunt us up some leads.

CUT TO:

DRAKE

Why do you wear that -- symbol?

DANICA

(defensive)

Old habits --

DANICA

I was a good Catholic school girl	Once.

DRAKE

I was there when they crucified him.  He

died -- for their sins, not mine.

DANICA

(playful1y)

And what are your sins?  Would you care

to confess them?

DRAKE

(shaking his head)

Too numerous to remember.

(nodding at the crucifix)

Take it off.

DANICA

Why?

DRAKE

I'll make you a better one.

DRAKE

There's an old saying --

DRAKE

Kill one man, you're a murderer. Kill a

million, a king.

(smiling)

Kill them all, a God.

CUT TO:

ZOE

Why do you do that?

BLADE

There's something bad inside of me.  This

keeps it from getting out.

ZOE

Why can't you just be nice?

BLADE

Good question.

SOMMERFIELD (0.S.)

I think I've got a lead.

SOMMERFIELD

Biomedica Enterprises.  They've been

buying up all sorts of supplies -- Taq

polymerase, bone marrow growth supplement,

genetic sequencing enzymes.

BLADE

We'll check it out.

CUT TO:

BLADE

Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

BLADE

C'mere.  We need to talk.

BLADE

Now spill it, bite-boy.

HENDRIX

(wiping a bloody nose)

You know what we're doing.  Drake has come

back to us.  Soon we'll all be Daywalkers.

And when that day comes, the world will

truly be ours.

BLADE

What's back there?

BLADE

(dryly)

Thanks.

BLADE

What's behind Door Number One?

VREEDE

They'll kill me --

BLADE

(an evil grin)

So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more.

ABIGAIL

God in Heaven --

BLADE

What was this place?

VREEDE

It's a blood farming facility.

(elaborating)

They decided that hunting humans on a

piece-meal basis was too inefficient.

Why kill your prey when you can keep them

alive?  Productive.  Under optimal

conditions a donor can generate anywhere

from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a

year.

ABIGAIL

(sickened)

But where did you get all these people?

VREEDE

The streets.  In any given year you've got

two to three million homeless people

wandering around America --

(shrugging)

No one cares about them.  We're doing the

country a service, really.

BLADE

The vampire Final Solution.

ABIGAIL

Are they aware?  Do they feel anything?

VREEDE

(shaking his head)

They're in a chemical-induced coma.

They're brain-dead, vegetables.

BLADE

Look at this!  Is this the future you

want?  You think there's a place for you

in their world?

VREEDE

We don't have a choice!  They're going to

win, don't you see that?!  He's come back!

There's nothing stopping them now!

BLADE

There's me.

BLADE

Go.  You've got thirty seconds.

BLADE (CONT'D)

(feeling a heavy weight)

Let's go.

What the fuck?!  WHAT THE FUCK?!?

His name's Beau.  We've been experimenting

KING

You made a goddamn vampire dog?!

GRIMWOOD

Yeah.  Cool, huh?

DANICA

Poor little King.  You look so

distraught.

DANICA

You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not

getting enough fatty acids in your diet?

Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout?

KING

How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck

off the end of my dick?

DANICA

Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later,

believe me.  But for now, we need to have

a little talk.

(beat)

Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been

building.

KING

I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And

shit.  And diddly just left the building.

GRINWOOD

Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

KING

Okay, here's the deal with the weapon -

(coughing)

It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice

the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories.

Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay --

DANICA

You're brave, King, I'll give you that.

But underneath all your swagger --

DANICA

-- I know what you really fear.   What

would hurt you more than anything else.

DANICA

You don't want to go back to being one of

us --

(her lips grazing his)

-- do you?

DANICA

I'm going to bite you again, King.  And

then I'm going to leave you here while you

turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after

day, while the Thirst keeps building and

building.  And then, when you can't stand

it anymore --

DANICA

-- I'm going to bring the little girl

for you to feed on.  Would you like that,

King?  Would you enjoy taking her life?

DANICA

Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

CUT TO:

BLADE

You alright?

ABIGAIL

(brusque)

I'll be fine.

BLADE

Don't let it turn inward.

ABIGAIL

It already has.  Since I can remember

I've had this knife of sadness in my

heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm

strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment

I pull it out --

(turning back to him)

-- I'll die.

ARIGAIL

I'm ready to go.

CAULDER

My name is Caulder.  And I'll be your

driver this evening.

BLADE

Where are you taking us?

CAULDER

Another safehouse.

ABIGAIL

We told you, Blade.  We operate in sleeper

cells.  When one goes down, a new cell

activates to pick up the slack.

CAULDER

Sommerfield left a video message for you.

SOMMERFIELD

(on video)

If you're watching this, I'm already dead.

If Zoe's still alive, I want you to

promise you'll take care of her.  I've

been reading her The Oz books every night.

We just started The Emerald City of Oz,

the one with the Nome King --

SOMMERFIELD

I think I've managed to cultivate a

workable strain of the Daystar virus.  As

a precaution, I transmitted the genetic

sequence to Caulder, in case our main

stock was destroyed.  In order for it to

achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to

interfuse it with Drake's blood.  If it

works, any vampires in the immediate

vicinity should die almost instantly.

After that, it should take only a few

weeks for the virus to spread throughout

the rest of the world.

SOMMERFIELD

There's one other thing, Blade.  You need

to know that there's a chance the virus

could destroy you too.  Because you're a

hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune

system will be able tolerate it.

(beat)

I'm sorry.  We didn't have enough time to

properly test it.

CAULDER

Take a look at the plague arrow.

CAULDER

I only had time to fabricate a small batch

of Daystar.  I outfitted it with a

compressed gas projectile, so you should

be able to fire it from one of the

fourbarrel rifles or a bow.

(beat)

Just make sure the shot counts, cause we

don't have enough for a second try.

CUT TO:

DRAKE

Do you know who I am?

ZOE

You're the Nome King.

DRAKE

The Nome King.  I like that.

(leaning closer)

Tell me, child.  Do you want to die?

ZOE

I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven.

DRAKE

There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels.

No happy ending for good little girls.

The only thing you have to look forward to

is nothingness.

DRAKE

But what if you could change that?  What

if you could remain a child forever?

DRAKE

What if you could keep this little doll-

like face of yours until the sun itself

cooled to a cold, hard rock?

(beat)

Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you

accept that gift?

ZOE

My friends are coming to kill you.

KING

-- gonna be sorry you did that --

ASHER

Nobody's coming for you, King.

KING

Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital

bread crumbs --

DANICA

Excuse me?

KING

One thing you need to know about us

Nightstalkers.  When you join our club,

you get this nifty little tracking node

surgically implanted in your body --

GRIMWOOD

Bullshit.

KING

Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the

others just dial up the satellite and

presto, instant cavalry.

AS HER

He's bluffing.

DANICA

(smiling, playing along)

Okay, King, where did they put this

tracking node of yours?

KING

It's in my left ass-cheek --

KING

Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass-

cheek --

KING

No, seriously --

(gasping)

-- it's in the meat of my butt, right

below my Bart Simpson tattoo --

KING

-- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for

yourself.

DANICA

ENOUGH!  It's not funny anymore!

KING

No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch --

(wincing as he breathes)

-- but it will be a few seconds from now.

DANICA

(coughing)

And what happens then, lover?

KING

Hammer time.

(beat)

See, that tickle in your throat you're

feeling right now?

KING

That's atomized colloidal silver.

It's being pumped into the building's air

conditioning system.

KING

Yeah, but here's the beauty --

ABIGAIL

Blade!

ABIGAIL

BLADE!!!

BLADE'S POV

We drop away from Abigail and King -- like

we're falling down

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

It didn't take long for the authorities

to arrive.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

When they got there, all of Drake's

people were dead.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

In the weeks that followed, the rest of

the world's vampires also perished.

(beat)

We'd finally won.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

And Blade?  Cumberland and Hale finally

got their body --

ABIGAIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)

-- but it wasn't the one they were banking

on.

ABIGAIL (V.O.)

The virus didn't kill Blade.  But the

authorities very well could have.  So in

the end, realizing that own his people

were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a

gift.

ABIGAIL (CONT AaD)

By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade

enough time to escape.  Offering Blade a

second chance at life - -

DISSOLVE TO:

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

And so Blade took it.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

We never saw him again.

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

He disappeared completely.

But that's what heroes do.  They simply

fade out.  And in this way --

ABIGAIL (V.0.)

-- they become legends.

FADE TO BLACK.

Evening Lucius.

LUCIUS

King, what the hell are you doing here?

KING

Just a little sport hunting.

LUCIUS

Ain't no vampires left, King.  So who do

you have to hunt?

KING

That's an interesting question, my friend.

And I've got a question for you in return.

KING

What do you get when you cross a vampire

with a werewolf?

KING

(raising his four-barrel)

A fur coat that sticks to your neck.

KING

Don't you know fur is murder?
