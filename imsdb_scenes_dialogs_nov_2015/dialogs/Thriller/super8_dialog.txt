FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

December 16, 2010

CHARLES' MOTHER

I'm so worried for that boy.

CHARLES' FATHER

Joe's gonna be okay.

2.

CHARLES' MOTHER

...she was everything to him.

CHARLES' FATHER

Jack's gonna step up. He's a good

man.

CHARLES' MOTHER

But he was never really a

father...I don't think he

ever...understood Joe.

CHARLES' FATHER

(maybe a little concerned

HIMSELF)

Joe's gonna be okay.

CARY

What do you think was in the

coffin?

MARTIN

Jesus, shut up.

CARY

I mean cause of how she died.

CARY (CONT'D)

... you weren't wondering that?

PRESTON

No, I'm eating macaroni salad.

CHARLES

I was thinking that, about the

coffin.

MARTIN

I don't know how you guys can eat.

3.

CHARLES

Try a Goddamn turkey roll and

you'll discover how. They're

delicious.

CARY

Either nothing was in there, or

like whatever they scraped up--

MARTIN

Jesus -- guys--

CHARLES MARTIN

DOWN--

PRESTON CHARLES

would not be eating right

now. Despite the turkey

rolls.

JACK (O.S.)

Hey-- Lucy.

CHARLES

Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my

movie anymore.

CARY

Why?

CHARLES

Why do you think why? The story.

It's about the living dead.

PRESTON

His mother's not a zombie.

CHARLES

But she's dead, shithead.

CARY

Those turkey rolls are pretty good.

4.

CHARLES

Told you.

THAN COMFORTING:

JACK

I'll be home soon.

5.

CHARLES

That was the longest day ever--

here.

JOE

What's this?

CHARLES

New scene, check it out. Let's hit

the 7.

JOE

(as he reads)

You hear Martin barfed in the hall?

CHARLES

I know, does that guy ever not

barf? Keep reading.

JOE CHARLES

is important.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

I think it might help make my movie

better. I need two things: a better

story and production value.

CARY CHARLES

CARY CHARLES

6.

JOE

Who's gonna play the wife, Jen?

CHARLES

No way -- did I tell you what she

did with my top hat?

JOE

Oh yeah, that was bad.

CARY

What wife?

CHARLES

Alice Dainard.

CHARLES

I was returning that book on codes

and ciphers-- she was in the silent

reading section -- I thought,

"Screw it." So I asked her if she'd

play Hathaway's wife.

JOE

You talked to Alice Dainard really?

CARY

You're not supposed to talk at all

in the silent reading section--

CHARLES CARY

CHARLES

She said yes, we're filming tonight

and she's driving.

JOE

-- driving where?

7.

CHARLES JOE

she old enough? Whose car are

we taking? Are you making

this up?

CHARLES

Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to

drive and I accepted--

CARY

(takes scene pages)

Can I see --?

JOE

-- was she nice? Why is she doing

this? I don't understand, we don't

even know her--

CHARLES

Maybe she just wants to be in a

good movie, y'ever think of that?

JOE

I don't think that's what it is--

CHARLES

I've been working on this movie for

months. I'm just trying to make it

good.

CARY

(reading, disapproving)

Hathaway's married now? Really?

JOE

What was she reading?

CHARLES

... what?

JOE

In the silent reading section, what

was Alice reading?

CHARLES

Who gives a rat's ass what she was

reading-- the festival deadline's

in one week -- my movie's gotta be

great!

8.

JACK

That was a good zombie murder.

CHARLES

Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you

for that-- it's not a story yet.

(MORE)

9.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Older kids enter this film festival

-- I'm competing with fifteen- and

sixteen-year-olds, who have better

stories and cars and production

value, I've got nothing!

CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)

Charles! Dinner!

CHARLES

I'm coming!

(TO JOE)

There's a whole article in there

about stories, you should read it,

it explains everything.

JOE

(looks at magazine)

I don't understand how the wife

makes it a story--

CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)

JOE (CONT'D)

I just can't believe you talked to

Alice Dainard.

CHARLES

You're impossible.

CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)

CHARLES!

CHARLES

GOD, MOM! I'M COMING!

(opens the door, whispers)

Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.

10.

JOE

I won't forget.

CHARLES

Read this.

JEN

Mom, it's not fair that I can't go

to Wendy's. Every single person is

going except me!

CHARLES' MOTHER

Then every single person can tell

you how it was --

CHARLES' FATHER

Move the puzzle, get the napkins.

JEN

MOM---

CHARLES' MOTHER

It's your turn to babysit.

JEN

So...

PEG

Get off that thing.

JEN

Mom, why can't I switch with

Charles?

CHARLES

Because you crushed Charles' top

hat, you ever think of that?

JEN

Oh, really, guess what? We're

switching.

11.

CHARLES

Guess what, no we're not.

CHARLES' MOTHER

Charles take these to the table!

Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,

JOE--

JOE

Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--

CHARLES' MOTHER

Grab a seat, we have lots of food.

JOE

Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.

(to Charles, loaded)

"See you tomorrow."

CHARLES

Later days.

CHARLES' FATHER

There's always a place for you

here, you know that--

JOE

Oh, yessir. Thank you.

12.

JACK

Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--

JACK

It's a six-week program, hands-on

training with college coaches.

(BEAT)

You'll like it. I know I did.

JOE

I thought I was going to have the

summer for myself--

JACK

Things have obviously changed for

us. And it'd be good for you to

spend some time with kids who don't

run around with-- cameras and

MONSTER MAKE-UP--

JOE

I gotta help Charles finish his

movie.

JACK

I have nothing against your

friends. I like your friends.

(MORE)

13.

JACK (CONT'D)

Except Cary, who can't stop

lighting things on fire. You'll

like it there.

(FINALLY)

It's what we both need.

CHARLES (V.O.)

Okay, it's time -- don't get

caught, over.

JOE

I won't. Over.

CHARLES (V.O.)

Wanna hear something gross?

CARY (V.O.)

I do.

MARTIN (V.O.)

No please, if you're really asking.

14.

CHARLES

I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit

my pants.

(THEY MOAN)

I debated telling you.

JOE

Thanks.

PRESTON

That's called a "sharteeze" by the

way.

CHARLES CARY

talking about: the world is

crazy, there's a name for

everything...

CHARLES

Twizzler me.

MARTIN

So... people are turning into

zombies because of the chemical

factory, right?

CHARLES

Martin? I don't see how the guy

playing Detective Hathaway can ask

where the zombies are coming from.

CARY

Another classic from Smartin.

MARTIN

I told you, I don't like it when

you call me that.

CARY

I'm sorry, Smartin.

MARTIN

Shut up.

JOE

GUYS--

15.

ALICE

Joe Lamb?!

JOE

-- yeah?

ALICE

What the hell's he doing here?

CHARLES

Make-up, sound and special effects.

ALICE

He's the deputy's kid!

CHARLES JOE

-- you knew that?

ALICE (CONT'D)

Charles, I don't have a license. I

can't drive with him!

CHARLES

You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?

ALICE

It's too late! He's seeing me in

this car right now.

JOE

You can trust me. My dad'll never

know. I won't tell him anything.

ALICE

Get in.

16.

PRESTON (V.O.)

(TERRIFIED)

You're driving very well. I'm

impressed.

CHARLES

So I wrote a couple new lines, can

I show you?

ALICE

What?

MARTIN

New lines? Charles-- what, I have

new lines?

CHARLES

Shut up. There aren't a lot--

ALICE

I'm sorta trying to drive--

CHARLES

What would be great is: could you

cry during the scene? Can you do

that?

ALICE

... no...?!

ALICE (CONT'D)

Stop.

CARY

You know the first place I'm gonna

drive when I get my license?

JOE

(offering to Alice)

Want one?

17.

CARY

New Castle, Pennsylvania. Fireworks

capital of America.

MARTIN

So I don't have any new lines,

right? Because I just learned

these.

CHARLES

Shut up.

PRESTON

I have never been a passenger in a

vehicle without an adult driving.

I'm unresolved as to how I feel

about it.

CHARLES

Guys, there's an electrical socket

up here.

MARTIN

Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have

more lines?

CHARLES

No. But you can pick up some stuff.

18.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Guys, this is going to be great.

Get the lights and camera on that

end, we'll shoot this direction

first, like we talked about! Joe,

get the mike plugged in-- make sure

the new batteries are in the camera

before you do the make-up!

JOE

Okay.

MARTIN

"-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I

have no choice." "That's nothing

you need to worry about..." "What

am I suppose to go to Michigan with

you..."

MARTIN (CONT'D)

No, no, no. Cary.

CARY

I took apart two packs of cherry

bombs and made my own M-80.

PRESTON

Your obsession with fireworks --

and I'm saying this as a friend --

concerns me. And my mother.

CARY

Well you're a pussy. And your mom

has one.

19.

MARTIN

Bogus, Cary.

CHARLES

Martin, I have a new line for you.

JOE

You mind?

ALICE

My dad works at the mill.

JOE

Close you eyes. Please.

CHARLES (O.S.)

So this is very emotional.

20.

CHARLES

Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't

want her husband to keep investiga--

ALICE

I know, we read it, we get it.

CHARLES

Okay, I'm just directing. Martin

get on your mark. Martin, you're

going to have to reassure her. Do

you know what "reassure her" means?

MARTIN

Yeah, I think so.

CHARLES

Okay-- we're starting on Alice's

side first-- Preston: a couple

seconds after "action" walk to the

pay phone, make it look like this

place is busy--

PRESTON

I know what that looks like.

CHARLES

Asshole, could you stop blowing

shit up for two seconds and deal

with the camera?

CARY

Sorry man.

CHARLES

Let's rehearse this -- save your

real performances for when we're

filming, though.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Ready? Here we go... action!

21.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I'm going to stay here and

investigate. I think it would be

safer if you leave town.

MRS. HATHAWAY

John. I don't like it. This case.

These murders.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

What am I supposed to do, go to

Michigan with you?

MRS. HATHAWAY

Mackinac Island's beautiful this

time of year.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

Sweetheart. This is my job.

MRS. HATHAWAY

The dead, coming back to life...? I

think you're in danger--

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I have no choice--

MRS. HATHAWAY

You do have a choice. We all do...

MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)

John, I've never asked you to stop.

I've never asked you to give up or

walk away.

MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)

But I'm asking you now-- please.

For me. Don't go back. Don't leave

me.

(MORE)

22.

MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)

I need to know this isn't the last

time I'll see you.

(BEAT)

I just love you so much.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

... I... I love you too...

ALICE

Was that okay? Or... not really?

CHARLES

-- uh, that was... I'm... that--

yeah, good. Just like that.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film

in the camera?!

CARY

-- I didn't put it in--

CHARLES

PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get

the mike ready. Go, go, Preston,

get in position. Costume, costume.

Martin, get that tripod set up.

Joe, help her with her costume.

Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't

miss the train. Preston, get in

position! Martin, you know you

lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE

CAMERA YET?!

ALICE

I love how calm he is.

JOE

Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.

23.

CHARLES

Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud

when the train passes by! Oh God, I

hope it stops! You ready?!

CHARLES (CONT'D)

And... ACTION!

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I'm going to stay here and

investigate. I think it would be

safer if you left town for a couple

of days.

MRS. HATHAWAY

John. I don't like it. This case.

These murders.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

What am I supposed to do, go to

Michigan with you?

MRS. HATHAWAY

Mackinac Island's beautiful this

time of year.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

Sweetheart. This is my job.

GROWING DIN:

MRS. HATHAWAY

THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I

THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I HAVE NO CHOICE!!!

24.

MRS. HATHAWAY

YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!!

John, I've never asked you to stop.

I've never asked you to give up or

walk away.

MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)

But I'm asking you now-- please.

For me. Don't go back. Don't leave

me. I need to know this isn't the

last time I'll see you.

(BEAT)

I just love you so much.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I love you too!!

JOE CHARLES

JOE

Run!

JOE (CONT'D)

Alice!

CHARLES

Joe, we have to go.

25.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!

JOE (O.S.)

Guys?!

JOE (CONT'D)

Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is

that you?

PRESTON

I'm okay! Though I think I'm having

a heart attack! And I have a

scrape!

26.

CARY

Guys, did you see those explosions?

That was awesome.

JOE

Has anyone seen Alice?!

CHARLES (O.S.)

I'm alive! Is anyone dead?

CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON

MARTIN CARY

ALICE (O.S.)

-- what's all that blood?

ALICE (CONT'D)

What's the blood? -- did someone

get hurt--?

KIDS (AD LIB)

Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't

touch -- what are you-- careful!

JOE

It's my fake blood. It's fake!

CHARLES

What is this stuff?

27.

PRESTON

Guys, what are these things?

MARTIN

Hey, don't touch it, what are you

doing?

CHARLES

They look like white Rubik's cubes

or something. They're heavy like

metal or something. There's like a

billion of them.

CARY

Guys, get up here. You can see

everything from up here.

CHARLES CARY

PRESTON

According to my Uncle Seth, an

accident like this is exceptionally

rare.

JOE

It wasn't an accident.

(turns away, eyes on the

FIELD)

There was a truck. On the tracks.

CHARLES

What? Driving on the tracks?

JOE

There.

28.

MARTIN

How can a pick-up truck derail a

train? That's impossible.

PRESTON

Obviously it isn't.

CARY

... holy shit...

CHARLES

-- is that him?

ALICE

(covers her mouth))

-- yeah, it's him--

MARTIN

-- who?

PRESTON CHARLES

MARTIN (CONT'D)

What? Who is that?

ALICE

Dr. Woodward...?

MARTIN

That's Dr. Woodward? The science

guy?

PRESTON

Biology.

CARY

Honors biology.

29.

MARTIN

Wow... I'm not in his class.

CARY

We know.

MARTIN

Shut up, Cary.

CHARLES

Remember when Old Man Woodward took

your Electronic Football?

CARY

Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon,"

never gave it back...

MARTIN

The dungeon?

PRESTON

That trailer Woodward keeps in the

school parking lot.

ALICE

... Dr. Woodward?

PRESTON JOE

ALICE (CONT'D) CHARLES

JOE

It's a schedule for the train.

DR. WOODWARD

-- who-- who are you?

30.

CHARLES

Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!

From fourth period! You've been in

an accident!

DR. WOODWARD

They will kill you. Do not speak of

this -- or you -- and your parents -

- will die.

JOE

-- guys, look --

ALICE

(SCARED)

-- we shouldn't be here--

DR. WOODWARD

GOOOOOOOOO!!!

PRESTON CHARLES

ALICE

MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!

JOE

GET IN THE CAR!!!

31.

CHARLES PRESTON

physical gun!

CARY CHARLES

PRESTON

My heart is pounding! That train

could of killed us.

JOE

(TO ALICE)

Are you okay?

CHARLES

Oh shit, all the glass just fell

out!

MARTIN

I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A

GUN AT ME!

ALICE

It's hard enough to drive without

everyone yelling!

32.

JOE

Guys, keep it down!

CARY JOE

MARTIN

I'm never taking a train again.

PRESTON

"You'll die, your parents will

die," guys, that is not good

information.

CHARLES

Great, the focus ring just fell

off!

CARY

No one cares about your CAMERA!

MARTIN

Am I the only one shaking?! I'm

also crying --

ALICE

We can't tell anyone we were there -

- we can't say a thing about it --

my dad cannot find out I took his

car, do you guys hear me?!

JOE

It's okay-- no one's saying

anything. None of us.

(to his friends)

Guys -- we're not gonna say

anything -- are we?!

JOE (CONT'D)

See? No one's gonna know.

33.

ALICE

Joe, this is yours.

JOE

-- oh, thanks,

ALICE

I should never have done this.

JACK JOE

JACK JOE

34.

SHORTS):

JEN

Mom, come on!

CHARLES' MOTHER

No. You're not wearing that. No one

in this house is wearing that.

JEN

Compared to Debbie's these are

long.

CHARLES' FATHER

Just listen to your mother.

JEN

I can't wear these or go to Wendy's

party? This is not fair.

CHARLES' MOTHER

Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.

JEN

Mom's racist.

PEG

Are there anymore English muffins?

CHARLES' MOTHER

I don't know, go check.

CHARLES' FATHER

Peg, tell the twins to stop.

PEG

They don't listen to me.

35.

CHARLES' FATHER

Hi, Joe.

JOE

Morning, Mr. Kaznyk--

CHARLES' MOTHER

Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the

train accident?

JOE

Uh... no.

CHARLES' MOTHER

It's on the news.

CHARLES

Can you believe this?

JOE

No.

CHARLES

It's on the news. That means it's

real.

NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)

Meanwhile, local science teacher

Thomas Woodward is still being

treated by Air Force medical

personnel after last night's train

derailment. Woodward apparently

fell asleep at the wheel of his

pick-up truck, which was hit by the

speeding train at approximately one

AM. Eighty-two train cars were

thrown from the tracks in the

derailment, the largest such

accident in Ohio's history. The

condition of Woodward, who has

taught at Lillian Middle School for

the past six years, remains

unknown.

36.

JOE

... Looks like a disaster movie,

doesn't it...?

INSPIRED:

CHARLES

(WHISPERS)

... oh my God, Joe... that's

AWESOME--

JOE

-- what?

CHARLES

We can use this -- we can film it --

JOE

(starts to smile)

-- you wanna go back?!

CHARLES JOE

(turns to him) --okay--

CHARLES

If any of the footage from last

night is usable, that means we need

Alice to play the wife again.

JOE

Yeah, I thought she was good.

CHARLES

She was mint, but she's never gonna

do it.

JOE

I think she will.

37.

CHARLES

There's no way. You heard what she

said.

JOE

But that was before the new pages,

right?

CHARLES

You honestly think she cares about

the scenes?

CHARLES

Man, did you hear what she said

last night? "I never should have

done this!" Dude, she was totally

wigged!

JOE

Yes, she was, we all were.

CHARLES

Did you see her face?

JOE

Yeah, I saw her face.

CHARLES

Man, what's wrong with you?

JOE

Nothing. I think she's going to do

it.

38.

CHARLES

Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke.

(BEAT)

Ya think it's fixable?

DONNY

I think it's cheaper to buy a new

one.

CHARLES

(TO JOE)

We're screwed, man, it's over!

JOE ALICE (V.O.)

JOE

Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb.

ALICE (V.O.)

Hi...

JOE

So we have some new scenes. For the

movie. We were hoping you'd be in

`em.

ALICE (V.O.)

Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that.

JOE

Really? `Cause these are really

good scenes.

CHARLES

We need this developed as soon as

possible -- can you do overnight?

39.

DONNY

Asshole, no one can do overnight.

You wanna buy some pot?

CHARLES

... no, thank you.

DONNY

You guys are weak.

ALICE (V.O.)

I'm watching the crash on the news.

JOE

Yeah, I know, I saw it.

(CONCERNED)

Are you okay?

CHARLES

Well, what's the fastest you can

do?

DONNY

I can make it a rush, you get the

film back in three days-- what's

your sister up to? The hot one, not

the other one.

CHARLES

I don't know.

ALICE (V.O.)

I should go.

JOE ALICE (V.O.)

ALICE

I don't care what Charles wants-- I

said no on the phone.

40.

JOE

You totally did, that's true, I

know, but--

ALICE

And now you're at my house.

JOE

I am, which-- under normal

conditions I would nev--

ALICE

It's too weird after last night-- I

don't understand how you guys can

keep working on your stupid movie,

I really don't.

JOE

We have to-- while the crash is

still there.

(waits, anxious, then,

VERY SOFTLY:)

... please...?

ALICE

(she considers, then:)

No.

ALICE (CONT'D)

You should go.

LOUIS

What's this?

ALICE

He was just inviting me to a party.

LOUIS

She's not going to your party.

JOE

Yessir.

41.

LOUIS

You know better than this.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

You get outta her. You go home and

don't come back, I don't wanna see

you.

ALIE

I'll do it.

JOE

-- what?

CHARLES

CUT! That was mint! So good! And it

looked huge with the train! Wow!

Joe: go reload the cap gun!

JOE

OKAY --

CHARLES

We'll get the other direction next -

- Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go

a little faster next time.

42.

MARTIN

I'll try, but I'm still crying

about last night, I feel like I'm

crazy.

CARY

Did it really look good? My death?

ALICE

... what do you think happened...?

JOE

You mean why he crashed the train?

ALICE

I just got a horrible feeling.

MARTIN

Anyone else still shaking from the

crash?

PRESTON

I got in my parents' bed last

night. Haven't done that since I

was eleven.

PRESTON (CONT'D)

... did I just insult him?

CHARLES

-- dude, what are you doing?

43.

JOE

That whole thing's an Air Force

train.

ALICE

-- what?

JOE

I make models-- plastic ones-- you

know, glue `em, paint `em--

PRESTON

And he's not embarrassed by that.

CARY

Looks who's talking, Math Camp.

CHARLES

Thanks, could I have a coffee,

please? Cream on the side?

WAITRESS

(really?)

Sure.

CARY

He is so sophisticated.

CHARLES CARY

ALICE

Keep going.

JOE

Air Force trains -- even models --

have these hooks...

PRESTON

Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for

when their train cars are put on

transport ships.

44.

JOE

Every car in that crash had hooks,

every one...

CHARLES

Joe: stop talking about it.

MARTIN

Am I the only one who doesn't

understand what this all means?

CARY

Probably, Smartin.

MARTIN

Shut up, I don't like that--

JOE PRESTON

CHARLES

Please shut up, all of you.

CARY

I say he was just sick of being old

and wanted to kill himself.

JOE

He had a gun, why not use that?

PRESTON

There are infinitely more effective

ways to commit suicide: pills,

HANGING--

CARY CHARLES

PRESTON (CONT'D)

You could jump from a building.

MARTIN

Fall down stairs.

PRESTON

Well, that's not really effective.

45.

ALICE

So, if it's Air Force, what would

the Air Force have on a train?

CHARLES

(WHISPER YELLING)

SHHHHJESUS! You heard what the Old

Man said, we can't talk about this!

(to waitress, with coffee)

-- thank you, very much.

PRESTON

Drowning, hari kari, also known as

seppuku--?

CARY

Excuse me, could we please get

another order of fries because my

friend here is fat?

CHARLES

Funny, Chompers, at least I don't

use a booster seat.

MARTIN

What was your teacher even talking

about? Who are we supposed to be

afraid of anyway?

CHARLES

I don't wanna find out -- guys, we

gotta forget we were there. Joe,

seriously... you really wanna take

a chance that something could

happen to your dad, too?

NELEC

Yes, I understand, this crash has

caused a whole mess of confusion.

46.

JACK

As you can expect, the local

authorities are trying to figure

out just what happened here as well

as how to help you out.

NELEC

It's under control. It'll be a very

fast clean-up.

JACK

Colonel, there isn't anything I

should know, is there?

NELEC

Not that I can think of, Deputy. I

understand you have concerns about

our cargo.

JACK

I'd like to see that manifest, yes.

NELEC

That's not going to be possible.

JACK

Colonel, I've got a lot of people

in my town that are gonna want to

know what's taking place.

NELEC

-- what town is that?

JACK

... Lillian.

NELEC

Deputy, if you're asking me if we

had any dangerous property on board

this train, I can assure you the

answer's no.

OVERMYER

Colonel.

NELEC

Excuse me.

47.

JACK

They gave me the run around for two

hours before I was allowed to talk

to anyone.

PRUITT

I'd say they have their hands full,

wouldn't you?

JACK

Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to

show me their manifest, said they

were carrying mostly airplane parts-

PRUITT

It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane

parts sorta make sense.

JACK

Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's

something else going on -- they're

taking molds of tire tracks -- now

why would they be doing that? Who

are they looking for? And they're

packing these weird little cubes

into crates and they're--

PRUITT

Weird little cubes?

JACK

--yeah, into these red trucks,

dozens of these trucks -- and I'm

telling you, they're scrambling to

get the hell outta there--

PRUITT

I'd say that's a good thing,

wouldn't you?

JACK

Sheriff, I think you need to go

check it out.

PRESTON

And I think you need a break.

(BEAT)

Jack, I've been telling you this

since Elizabeth.

(MORE)

48.

PRESTON (CONT'D)

You're a good deputy. But you need

to take a vacation.

(BEAT)

Go home. Take off your uniform. Go

fishing. And give your son a hug.

SHERIFF PRUITT

Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's

paying you to listen to the radio.

SHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D)

Breen.

BREEN

Hey, Sheriff.

SHERIFF PRUITT

What's that?

BREEN

Walkman. It's like a stereo, play

your own cassette tapes.

(OFFERS HEADPHONES)

You wanna try it?

SHERIFF PRUITT

(pays for the candy bars)

I don't think so. Kids walking

around with their own stereos. Just

what we need. It's a slippery

slope.

BREEN

... yessir.

49.

CONFOUNDING --

50.

ALICE

Where'd you learn how to do this?

JOE

Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make-

up Handbook.

CHARLES

Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots

of the train crash, obviously-- you

know that train model you made? Can

we blow it up and film it?

JOE

... sure.

CHARLES CARY

JOE (CONT'D)

I don't care, they can blow it up.

I can show you the train, it's

nothing, it's stupid.

(BEAT)

(MORE)

51.

JOE (CONT'D)

You wanna see it? Later? The...

train? My train model? The train I

made?

CHARLES MARTIN

ALICE

So how am I supposed to be a

zombie?

JOE

Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul.

Someone with no soul, dead eyes.

Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?

ALICE

For English? Yeah--

JOE

-- like her. But hungry, like

hungry for human flesh. To make

them turn into zombies, because

that's what zombies do.

JOE (CONT'D)

Oh my God. That's really good...

JOE (CONT'D)

... not bad.

52.

EDIE

-- Careful, there was a gas spill.

I don't even know how much fuel

I've lost.

MR. BLAKELY

-- You don't seem to be asking a

lot of questions.

EDIE

-- Give this man some time, Mr.

Blakely.

MR. BLAKELY

He's just the Deputy, he's not the

Sheriff...

MR. BLAKELY (CONT'D)

I think this is most likely a bear

attack.

EDIE

Remember when I said you talk too

much? Well, this is the time.

JACK

Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt

this morning?

VOICE (V.O.)

Negative, still no word.

JACK

Vicky, I need you to have Dayton

send a CS unit out to Edie's. You

put out an APB on the Sheriff and

Breen Haskell -- send units to

their houses immediately. You copy

all of that?

VOICE (V.O.)

... copy. And Jack, we're getting a

lot of unusual calls.

JACK

... what kind of unusual calls...?

53.

IZZY

Never seen this kinda thing before.

IZZY (CONT'D)

What the hell am I supposed to do?

Insurance company thought I was

joking with him. Look at my

Bonneville here-- look at this. I

got a call about this car

yesterday. What am I going to tell

the customer?

JACK

Having trouble with anyone lately,

Izzy?

IZZY

I was thinking, you should talk to

Louis Dainard. I didn't help him

out with financing last year,

wouldn't be surprised if this was--

some sorta sick retribution.

RESIDENTS JACK

you, I'll handle it myself.

54.

JOE

Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!

JOE

Lucy! ... Lucy!

OFFICER MIKE

We need more help around here.

OFFICER GORDON

We've got four men on the Pruitt

case alone. We've called into

Dayton, they'll be out in the

MORNING----

55.

JACK

That's not enough. People don't

feel safe here -- and you know why?

`Cause they're not--

JACK (CONT'D)

-- the Air Force isn't answering a

damn question: they've got trucks

at Woodward's house, looking for

SOMETHING --

OFFICER

They've got trucks all over town.

OFFICER JAY

I saw a guy riding shotgun in one

of those trucks -- had some kind of

scanner in his hand --

DEPUTY TALLY

--like a Geiger counter or

SOMETHING--

JACK

I know. They're saying it's just

clean-up at the train crash, but

they're taking molds of tire

tracks. Which means they're looking

for someone-- now what's that

about?

JOE

-- have you... seen Lucy?

JACK

I'm sure she's around. I put a

couple of slices in the fridge for

you there.

DEPUTY TALLY

-- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--

JOE

That's... okay, I'll find a--

56.

JACK

Vicky, you got power at the

station?

DISPATCH (V.O.)

On and off. Brook County's in the

dark.

JACK

Get water and power out there now.

JOE

So the Air Force is looking for a

car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're

taking tire prints from the crash

site. Over.

CHARLES

I don't wanna hear about it. They

could be monitoring us right now!

Jesus, shut up. Over!

JOE

(VERY CONCERNED)

And the military's at Woodward's

house. Looking for his research.

Whatever that means?

CHARLES

Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME

AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come

help me tomorrow or not? I need you

to make Alice a zombie again.

JOE

Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.

57.

ROONEY

This is Rooney at Mary-10, was

there re-routing on this line?

VOICE (V.O.)

Negative, but the grid through

Liberty is dark.

ROONEY

... yeah, `cause there's no

overhead lines on these poles.

VOICE (V.O.)

-- come again?

ROONEY

No power, no comm cables. Stand by.

ROONEY

We got over a half mile of copper

missing.

VOICE (V.O.)

-- that-- doesn't sound possible.

ROONEY

Lines are back up at M-38.

58.

MRS. BABBIT (V.O.)

I wanna know who took `em.

59.

MRS. BABBIT

Twenty microwave ovens: gone from

my inventory. Brook County's

without power -- this feels to me

like a Russian invasion.

JACK

Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the

Russians have anything to do with

what's happening in town-- but I'm

calling the curfew because w--

MRS. BABBIT

Until you can tell me who's messing

with us, I say it's the Soviets and

we're at war. I like you, Jack, but

we need Sheriff Pruitt back.

JACK

We have good people working on

that. Mr. McCandless.

MR. MCCANDLESS

Since Wednesday morning, my Ham

radio's been a mess -- all sorts of

frequencies I like to scan. Some

kind of buzz modulation-- have you

found that?

JACK

Mr. McCandless, can I speak with

you for a moment, privately?

MCCANDLESS:

MR. MCCANDLESS JACK

frequencies off-hand, do you?

15015 TO 15048--

60.

WOMAN

Jack, all the tools in the garage

are gone.

JACK

Patty, get in touch with Vicky.

David, have you seen Milner?

DAVID

No, sir, I haven't seen him.

MAN

There's a sink hole in my garage.

It almost sank a foot.

JACK

Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?

TOM

Have you tried his office?

JACK

Check his office.

MAN

The powers been out for days

JACK

--Rosko, I need you to get every

radio we have and you tune to these

frequencies -- understand?

ROSKO

No. What?

JACK

Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner

with a descrambler don't you?

DANNY

Voice inverter, yeah.

61.

JACK

Whatever, get it down and set it up

for me.

ROSKO

What is this?

JACK

I think the Air Force is using

UNASSIGNED CHANNELS--

LOUIS

Hey -- he was at my house yesterday

morning, are you aware of that?

OFFICER ROSKO

(quiet to Jack)

We brought him in about the car lot

and other things -- he's clean.

LOUIS

I'd appreciate it if you would

inform your son that my house if

off-limits. And so it my daughter.

JOE

Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.

ALICE

-- you made all these?

62.

JOE

Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre

Dame. I watched that one on TV.

HERE---

JOE (CONT'D)

This is the train they wanna

destroy.

ALICE

... it looks real.

(beat, studies)

It looks so old...

JOE

That's dry brush technique.

(off her look)

After you've painted the base

color, you take something like...

(grabs up Testors bottle)

Euro Gray.

ALICE

Euro Gray...

JOE

There are so many different grays,

it's crazy. And you pour a little

onto like a paper plate. Then you

take a dry brush and you just dip

it in, then you brush on the paper,

so the paint's barely on the brush.

Then you make small brush strokes

on the model. Little ones, like

where the wear and tear would be.

Around the wheels. Or where the

doors would slide. Then you do it

again, like with Camouflage Gray--

or here, I used Insignia Red to

make it look like there was another

coat of paint on there before. Like

they painted over it, but you could

see it scratched off.

63.

ALICE

What was that necklace?

(off his awkward stare)

The one you were holding at the

train crash. Was it your mom's?

JOE

My dad gave it to her the day I was

born. She wears it all the time.

Used to.

(BEAT)

It was bad, how she-- died and

stuff, but they got the necklace

back. So.

CHARLES

Guys, what the hell?! No one knew

where you were.

JOE

We're sitting right here.

CHARLES

You gotta be the soldier.

JOE

I thought you were calling Evan.

CHARLES

Evan blew us off, he's a pussy.

(TO ALICE)

Excuse me.

ALICE

It's okay.

CHARLES

You gotta do it. You're the only

one.

JACK

The hell do you mean you "found my

dog in Brookville?" That's a

DIFFERENT COUNTY--

64.

OFFICER TALLY

Lucy-- that's where she is. We've

gotten nearly thirty calls from

people who have found local dogs.

Thing is, the calls coming in

aren't local.

OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D)

It's like they all just... ran

away, every direction...

YOUNG WOMAN

It's not her. She never's

disappeared before.

OFFICER ROSKO

Alright. Now what does she look

like?

YOUNG WOMAN

She's got dark hair, it was in

rollers. Do you know what rollers

are?

OFFICER ROSKO

Yes, I know what rollers are.

YOUNG WOMAN

She went to her car--

OFFICER ROSKO

EXCUSE ME--

65.

MALE VOICE (V.O.) OFFICERS

they're not Air Force.

ROSKO

What's he say? Operation what?

CLOSE ON--JACK:

JACK

Walking Distance.

SOLDIER:

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

I came as soon as I could, what's

happening here?

OFFICER JOE

Military police investigation. It

was a suicide.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

Suicide? Who was it?

OFFICER JOE

A former Air Force officer. He

called me last night, said he had a

secret that he couldn't keep any

longer.

66.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

What's this?

OFFICER JOE

He worked at Romero Chemical. He

found out some things the company's

been doing. After what you told me

at the bar, I thought you should

know.

CARY

(QUIETLY)

Are we gonna get in trouble here--?

CHARLES

(WHISPER-YELL)

Shhhh! Production value! It's for

the movie!

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

This proves it. They knew, the

company knew. Thank you so much for

the information.

OFFICER JOE

We just made the discovery

ourselves. You understand this is

top secret.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

Of course.

OFFICER JOE

I would never have given you this

information if you and I hadn't

served together in Vietnam.

OVERMYER

Nothing so far--

67.

NELEC

How much more is there?

OVERMYER

Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe

more.

NELEC

What, more tax returns?

OVERMYER

It's here somewhere. If we can't

find it, Woodward'll tell us where

it is.

NELEC

... the hell's that?

OVERMYER

... looks like kids making a

movie...

CHARLES

Joe.

(TO JACK)

Hey, Mr. Lamb!

JACK

Get in the car.

CHARLES

Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,

but technically, that's my film--

68.

NELEC

I would like to help you out

deputy. I really would. But we

operate on a need to know basis.

JACK

Why are your trucks sweeping the

town?

NELEC

We'll be out of your way shortly.

JACK

Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me

contacting DC. Talk to some friends

about "Walking Distance."

JACK (CONT'D)

All right. We'll do it that way.

NELEC

Deputy.

(JACK TURNS)

Let's talk. Just not here.

69.

JACK

This is new. All this. For the both

of us. Dealing with-- all this,

just us. So I'm going to make this

as clear and simple as I can:

You're not friends with Alice

Dainard. When I say no, I don't

mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I

mean no. I've known Louis Dainard

for alotta years-- he's been

nothing but trouble. Your mother

used to say he's not a bad guy, he

just needs a chance, he's just sad -

- well I tried to be good to him,

but I can't. Not anymore. I will

not allow him or his daughter in

this house. I will not allow you

spending time with her, doing

projects or whatever it is that

you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope

we're clear.

JOE

We're not clear.

JACK

What'd you say?

JOE

We're not clear. You and I aren't

clear about anything. We couldn't

be less clear.

JACK

Joseph Francis Lamb--

JOE

(ERUPTING)

Just `cause mom died doesn't mean

you know anything about me!!! You

don't. You don't know about Alice

either -- she's kind!

70.

JACK

I'm not having this discussion with

you--!

JOE

She's NICE to me!

JACK

I don't care what she is! Her

father is a selfish, irresponsible

son-of-a-bitch!

JACK (CONT'D)

You listen to me, I've got twelve

thousand people in this town that

are scared out of their minds--

they've got one person they can

rely on -- it used to be someone

else, but now it's just me.

71.

JACK

Hello--?

VOICE (V.O.)

Drop your weapons. Put your hands

on the car.

JACK

--I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He

told me to meet him here.

VOICE (V.O.)

You're under military arrest. Drop

your weapons.

JACK

WHERE'S NELEC?

NELEC

I don't want any more trouble. Do

you?

NELEC (CONT'D)

We've been going through your

belongings, looking for evidence.

Of what you knew, how you knew

it... and who else might know.

(BEAT)

I remember you. In the lab. And I

recall we didn't see eye to eye,

but that's no excuse for doing what

you did here.

72.

NELEC (CONT'D)

So in the spirit of moving forward

and avoiding more trouble, tell us

where you put your research. I know

you had someone document the crash

that night. Tell me who that was

and I'll help you, I swear to God.

On my mother's life -- if you help

us now, we will take care of you.

DR. WOODWARD

I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,

when you take care of people.

NELEC

--I'm going to bait him. I'm going

to catch him.

DR. WOODWARD

He's in me, you know. As I am in

him. So when you see him next, as

I'm sure you will... I'll be

watching you, too.

ALIE

-- are you-- were you sleeping?

JOE

Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?

ALICE

Yeah.

JOE

(BEAT)

Oh, you wanna come in?

73.

ALICE

Power's still out.

JOE

Room's still messy.

ALICE

I was in bed, couldn't sleep.

(BEAT)

Thinking. I wanted to tell you

something, before tomorrow -- Don't

let Charles blow up your train.

ALICE (CONT'D)

I don't think it's right, do you? I

know he's your friend, but he's so

BOSSY--

JOE

He can be sorta li-- I've known him

since Kindergarten, though--

ALICE

He shouldn't always get what he

wants. I mean, who always gets what

they want? -- I know I don't know

you at all. Even though... it sort

of feels like I do.

(BEAT)

Do you not... feel like that?

JOE

-- no, I totally do, I'm just...

sort of in shock at this whole

CONVERSATION--

ALICE

-- no, keep it-- please --

ALICE (CONT'D)

... is that her?

74.

JOE

... yeah...

JOE (CONT'D)

... it's so weird watching her like

this, like she's still here...

(beat, lost in it)

... she used to look at me, this

way... like really look. And I

just... knew I was there. That I

existed.

ALICE

He drank that morning. My dad.

(BEAT)

He missed his shift.

(beat, hard)

Your mom took it for him. The day

of the accident.

ALICE (CONT'D)

... I know he wishes it was him.

Instead of her.

(HARD BEAT)

... and sometimes I wish it was,

too.

JOE

Don't say that.

(BEAT)

He's your dad.

ALICE JOE

75.

LOUIS (O.S.)

Morning.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

You wanna tell me where you were?

Or you want me to tell you.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

Sit down.

ALICE

I should go to bed.

LOUIS

I wanna talk to you. I said sit

down.

ALICE

I don't want to sit down.

LOUIS

Then go. Be just like your mother

and leave.

LOUIS (CONT'D)

GO AHEAD, GO!

76.

LOUIS

ALICE!!! WAIT!!!

LOUIS

ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!

77.

LOUIS

-- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!

LOUIS

ALICE!!!

VOICE

Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation

Walking Distance is in effect. T-

minus four hours until evacuation.

Evacuation is T-minus four hours.

78.

JOE (V.O.)

Why are you not reacting?

JOE

(EMPHATIC WHISPER)

That thing went through my wall.

CHARLES

I told you not to pick it up in the

first place.

JOE

What are you so angry about? That

I'm not going to let you blow up my

train?

CHARLES

That's part of it! Juts a part!

DONNY

Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's

broke up with Karen, that shit

ended a week ago.

JOE

What's your problem?

CHARLES

My whole movie's a disaster `cause

of you!

JOE

I know, my dad's being a turkey.

79.

CHARLES

Whatever.

JOE

We're still gonna finish your

movie!

CHARLES

It's not about the movie.

JOE

What are you talking about? Of

course it is.

CHARLES

Just forget it.

JOE

Why?

CHARLES

There's nothing wrong--

JOE

I'll get the camera back, I know

where my dad put it -- We can still

make the festival.

CHARLES

It's not about the movie.

JOE

Then what is it about?

CHARLES

Jesus, you don't even get it do

you? It's obvious.

JOE

What's obvious?

CHARLES

Gawd, you're a dumb ass.

80.

CHARLES

That night of the crash, you

started getting all weird.

JOE

-- what?

CHARLES

Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.

JOE

Your movie was over! That's what

you said! You were upset. I gave

you a camera! I helped you!

CHARLES

Don't pretend like you did it for

me! You didn't do it for me and you

know it!

JOE

What's your problem?

CHARLES

It was never about me! It was

always about Alice!

MRS. HATHAWAY

John. I don't like it. This case.

These murders.

DETECTIVE HATHAWAY

What am I supposed to do, go to

Michigan with you?

JOE

Well, you're the one who wanted the

wife in the movie!

81.

CHARLES

Not so you could fall in love with

her!

JOE

What do you even care what I think

about Alice?!

CHARLES

Because I like her! That's why!

That's why I asked her in the first

place! So I could get to know her,

not YOU!

JOE

-- wait, you like Alice Dainard?

CHARLES

You're such an idiot.

JOE

(from Charles' movie)

Guys, look out!

CHARLES

SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We

can't use any of this. And you

won't even let me blow up your

train. Everything's bogus.

JOE

We can make another train and blow

that one up.

JOE (CONT'D)

I do like her. Sorry about that.

CJAR

Shut up. It's okay.

(BEAT)

That's not even what bothers me.

(beat, finally, sad)

It's that she likes you too. That

really bothers me. I dunno...

82.

JOE

... Charles...

CHARLES

I know it's stupid. What would she

ever like me? I haven't leaned out

yet, which the doctor says is gonna

HAP--

CHARLES (CONT'D)

-- Joe, what the hell--?!

HARKIN:

JOE

Mr. Harkin. What's going on?

MR. HARKIN

Evacuation! The fire!

83.

PA VOICE (O.S.)

-- Due to a wildfire that is raging

out of control and threatening to

reach the Lillian Chemical Plant--

PA VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

-- an evacuation has been called

for your safety. Please remain calm

and as you board the bus...

JOE CHARLES

84.

CHARLES' MOTHER

Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are

you okay? I went back to the house

and you were gone.

CHARLES

They made us get on the bus.

CHARLES' MOTHER

Hi, Joe.

JOE

Hi.

(TO CHARLES)

I'm gonna find my dad.

CHARLES

You gonna tell him about that

thing?

JOE

Yeah.

CHARLES' MOTHER

Come back if you can't find him.

ARGUING MAN ARGUING SOLDIER

85.

JOE

Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know

you don't like me sir, and I'm

sorry about that-- but I'm looking

for my dad--

LOUIS

It took her.

JOE

(long beat, sotto)

... what?

LOUIS

It took her. I saw it. It was...

something... so... big, like

nothing -- it was-- and no one...

no one believes me...

(CRYING)

... no one believes me-- they just

keep giving me pills. It took

her... Joe, it took Alice... no one

believes me.

JOE

... I believe you.

JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It took Alice.

CHARLES CARY

JOE (CONT'D)

Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

CHARLES PRESTON

JOE (CONT'D)

Back to town -- to find Alice -- we

have to find her--

86.

MARTIN JOE

PRESTON

Wait a minute -- first of all, I

want to live. Okay?

JOE

I'm going whether you come or not--

which I really hope you do.

CARY

(pats his backpack)

I've got six tons of explosives in

here, let's find that thing and

blow it to shit.

JEN

As if I'm gonna help you.

CHARLES

Do this for me and I'll babysit the

twins next week so you can go to

Wendy's stupid party.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

I am not shitting you. You can't

ask me any questions though. You

can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No

one.

JEN

... does it have to be him?

CHARLES

Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm

about to rescind the offer.

87.

JEN

This whole evacuation thing's

freaking me out. Making me rethink

my priorities. Saw you over here

and thought maybe we could kick

back.

DONNY

-- we totally could.

JEN

I asked Charles about you, and he

said you're a great guy--

DONNY

I totally am.

JEN

Will you hate me if I start our

relationship by asking a favor?

DONNY

So there are rules to being in my

car, okay?

CARY

Where the hell are we going anyway?

JOE

We're going to the school to open

the trailer Woodward had in the

parking lot. I bet that's where he

keeps his research.

CARY

What research?

JOE

We're gonna learn everything we can

about that thing so we can find it.

And that's how we're gonna save

Alice.

88.

DONNY

Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery

and no one touches the CB, gottit?

CHARLES

You think Woodward's got

information about that thing in the

dungeon?

JOE

Why else are there padlocks on the

door?

(TO DONNY)

We're going to the school.

DONNY

When did this one get so bossy?

JACK

Hey! I gotta take a leak! What am I

supposed to do, piss in here?!

JACK (CONT'D)

Thanks for the hospitality.

JACK

So am I going in alone or are y--?

89.

RIFLE --

MARTIN

Well, so guys, if the Air Force has

already searches Woodward's house,

wouldn't they've already searched

the classroom too?

CARY

Hay Donny, this car is gnarly.

90.

CHARLES

I was thinking about that too.

JOE

Maybe the classroom, but not the

dungeon.

CHARLES

Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of

weird stuff in the dungeon.

MARTIN

Where's the dungeon?

DONNY

Shut up. What kind of music does

she like? Your sister.

CHARLES

I don't care. Disco I guess?

DONNY

I could get back into disco.

JOE

We shouldn't take River Road, they

had a roadblock.

DONNY

Dork. I saw it. Observe.

DONNY

So what, I wait here like a douche?

JOE

Yes. Thank you very much. Do you

have a tire iron?

91.

CHARLES

Joe, let me try -- let me try.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Joe, this is impossible, man.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

--I loosened it for you.

JOE

GUYS--

MARTIN CHARLES

CHARLES

I cannot believe we're breaking

into school, who does that? No one

does that-- idiots do that--

JOE

Dr. Woodward was dishonorably

discharged from Nellis Air Base in

1963 because of "subversive

conduct," whatever that is.

92.

MARIN

Dude, check it out. Old Man

Woodward.

CHARLES

Back when he was like Middle-Aged

Man Woodward.

MARTIN

-- He's been tracking this thing

since like 1958.

JOE

(to the movie)

What is this?

CHARLES

I don't know. It says April 8th,

1963 incident. I dunno.

JOE

Cary, we got to find this thing.

CARY

Sorry.

DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) JOE

IS PREDOMINANTLY

DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)

-- I explained that all he wants is

to rebuild his ship.

(MORE)

93.

DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A craft made up of those cubes of a

complex, shape-shifting element--

remarkable material that we'll

never fully understand. He has been

desperate to reconstitute his ship

since it crashed here in `58, but

instead of giving him the help he

needs, we've held him as a

prisoner. He's been restrained and

experimented upon -- Through pain

and lack of compassion, we have

taught him to hate us all. We've

turned him into an enemy.

CARY

Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look.

CHARLES MARTIN

DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)

I told them I knew these things

because he made contact with me.

That he makes a psychic connection

by touch. The moment we made

contact, I understood him and he,

me. What I know is that if we don't

change this and start helping him,

we will all pay the price. But

Nelec won't listen--

JOE

Woodward wasn't trying to kill it.

94.

CHARLES

He was trying to help it escape.

MARTIN

Did you hear that?

CHARLES COMMANDO

CHARLES

-- oh shit!

NELEC

Search them.

CARY

I rolled those M-80's myself,

that's right.

NELEC

(eyes flick to Joe)

You're the Deputy's boy.

JOE

-- hey, no--

95.

NELEC

(TO OVERMYER)

Move out.

DONNY

... oh shit...

DONNY (CONT'D)

Breaker breaker, requesting police

backup, over?! Breaker breaker, is

this the police channel?

SOLDIER

Staff Sergeant.

JACK

Hi, how are you doing?

YOUNG KID

Hi, Mr. Lamb.

JACK

Shhhh.

JACK (CONT'D)

Rosko!

OFFICER ROSKO

Where the hell you been? What are

YOU WEARING--

96.

JACK

--come here. The Air Force set that

fire, they want the town empty for

some reason. The whole military

operation, the evacuation,

everything is all bad.

OFFICER ROSKO

Did you hear about Joe? Dispatch

just got a call on citizen's band:

Joe and some friends were grabbed

by military personnel at the middle

school.

JACK

Tell me everything, right now, and

I won't throw you in jail.

PRESTON

-- yessir --

(holds the SUPER 8 FILM)

But you should look at this first.

VOICE (V.O.)

(FILTERED)

Base Fortress requests ETA.

NEWS REPORTER

is twenty minutes out.

VOICE (V.O.)

Roger.

97.

CHARLES

... what... what's gonna happen?

CARY

I think we're gonna die.

MARTIN

No. They'd never do that.

JOE

-- guys-- I forced you to come with

me... I'm... I'm so sorry.

(looks to Charles)

I'm so sorry...

CARY

I think they're gonna kill us.

CHARLES

(UNCONVINCING)

Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You

know why?

JOE

... why--?

98.

DRIVER

CHARLES

Congratulations!

They're coming, man! I think we

JOE

We need to get back to town!

DONNY

Hop in, man! But you should know: I

am massively stoned right now.

JOE

You want me to drive?

105.

CHARLES

Joe, where are we going?

JOE

I saw something at the cemetery.

Woodward said it's subterranean-- I

think I know where it--

CARY

What's that? What are those sounds?

MARTIN

Guys, that sounds like guns!

CARY

(points to a tank)

What the hell is that?!

CHARLES

TURN THE CAR AROUND!

JOE

We gotta go by foot--!

CHARLES

We have to get out of here!

He's too stoned!

MARTIN

Drugs are so bad!

106.

SOLDIER

Sir, the weapons are misfiring!

Surface to air, radar -- all of

them! It's a mess out here, sir.

CARY

You guys see those explosions? They

were huge.

MARTIN

Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.

MARTIN

Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.

Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!

CARY

Where we going?

JOE

To the cemetery--

MARTIN

What happened to my leg? It hurts.

CHARLES

Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone

sticking out of your leg!

CARY

There's a hole in the house!

CHARLES

Joe, gimme that thing on the

curtains!

JOE

I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have

to stay with Martin.

CHARLES

JOE

(a meaningful beat)

... yeah.

108.

CARY

I'm not staying with the girls!

CHARLES

God, Cary. Shut up!

CARY

Calm down.

MARTIN

Oh, my leg hurts!

JOE

Come on, Cary, we gotta go.

CHARLES

This is going to hurt.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

I haven't even done it yet.

CARY

So what are we doing here?

JOE

Just follow me.

CARY

I've been following you for the

last five blocks. What are we doing

here?

109.

JOE

Help me!

CARY

Help you with what?

JOE

We need to get inside.

CARY

For what? What's in these windows?

JOE

It's dirt. Why is there dirt in

these windows?

JOE

Help me, on three.

JOE/CARY

CARY

Whoa. This is scary.

JOE

You got any sparklers in there?

CARY

Are you kidding me?

110.

JOE

LOUIS

I came to your house that day. To

tell you that I never meant to hurt

anyone. Swear to God.

(beat, respectful tears)

I'm sorry, Jack. About what

happened to your wife.

JACK

... It was an accident. It was an

accident.

CARY

Joe, I don't understand--

111.

JOE

Shhh. This way.

CARY

It's Sheriff Pruitt.

JOE

I know. Cary look.

CARY

What is this?

JOE

We're under the water tower.

112.

CARY

It's eating a person.

JOE

She's here. We're going to use your

firecrackers.

CARY

I don't think it's going to hurt

it, Joe.

JOE

There are other tunnels.

CARY

So?

JOE

I need you to make noise. Lots of

it, right here, in two minutes.

Make it loud and make it last--

gimme some sparklers.

CARY

(goes through his bag)

-- why-- what are you gonna do--?

JOE

(takes SPARKLERS and a

LIGHTER from Cary)

Make sure you're gone by the time

it blows: you can't be here, you

gotta run.

CARY

Where are you going?

113.

CARY

here?!

JOE

I'm just-- doing the best I can to

save you.

ALICE

How did you know?

JOE

Your dad. He told me. He was

worried. And flipping out.

ALICE

Really?

JOE

-- we need to move--

TINA (O.S.)

Excuse me?

TINA (CONT'D)

Where are we?

TINA

I left my bag in my car. Then I

went to my car to get my bag--

ALICE

It's been experimented on for

years. It's terrified and exhausted

and hungry, it just wants to go

home. When it touched me, I knew --

116.

JOE

Alice, help me get the sheriff

down.

TIME CUT:

SHERIFF PRUITT

Follow me. I can get us out of

here.

JOE

Sheriff, we came that way.

SHERIFF PRUITT

Don't argue with me.

TINA

Come on, kids, let's go with the

sheriff.

JOE

Sheriff, I really think we're going

the wrong way.

PRUITT

We'll talk about it when we get up

top.

CARY (O.S.)

Joe!

JOE

I told you to get out!

CARY

I thought this was the way out. I

tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--

PRUITT

Kids, come on, we gotta go.

117.

JOE

GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!

CARY

Joe, what are you doing?

JOE

WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD

IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS

HORRIBLE!

CARY

Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!

JOE

YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!

JOE (CONT'D)

-- I know bad things happen-- bad

things happen, but you can still

live. You can still live, you can

still live, you're gonna be okay--

118.

CARY

Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!

CARY

JOE

... he's making a model.
