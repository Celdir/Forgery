BUTCH'S VOICE

(through walkie-talkie)

...oil all over the street.  Cracked

water and gas mains.  Four companies

coming in...

FRANK

(re: rain)

Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in

Baltimore tomorrow.

GIBSON

Baltimore?

FRANK

The game, Graham.  The Series?

GIBSON

Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.

FRANK

Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with

me.  This is what we do.

GIBSON

(still tapping his watch)

I seem nervous, huh?

FRANK

It's 5:30, Gib.

BUTCH'S VOICE

(through walkie talkie)

...two Con Ed men trapped in an

underground electrical conductor vault.

BUTCH

(deep irony)

A fun one.

FRANK

Yep.

COMMANDER

We got high voltage cables ripped loose

in the underground.  They hit water, that

fault's gonna arc.

FRANK

Why haven't they killed the juice?

SUPERVISOR

Switches are shorted out.

FRANK

You're shitting me!

SUPERVISOR

Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system

down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna

take awhile.

FRANK

We gotta go underground.  Get those guys

out, now.

SUPERVISOR

We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut.

Won't budge.

COMMANDER

The block is being evacuated.  I don't

want anybody... including our

boys...within fifty yards of that

tanker...it's a fucking bomb.

FRANK

This is the Fire Department.  Frank

Sullivan.  You guys okay?

CON ED WORKER #1'S VOICE

Please man, you gotta get us out of

here...

FRANK

That's exactly what we're gonna do.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(yells to Con Ed Supervisor)

How do we get to the vault door?

SUPERVISOR

There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.

BUTCH'S VOICE

Forget it, Frank.  No way you reach those

men in time.

FRANK

(yelling back)

I can do it, Butch.  Me and my 'tank man'

here.

COMMANDER O'CONNELL

(to all, and into walkie)

Start spraying down the street.  Let me

know when we are fully evacuated.

BUTCH

(via walkie)

Frank, you hear me?  Frank?

FRANK

(into walkie)

Yeah, Butch?

BUTCH

(via walkie)

The gas level is getting serious.

The underground's combustible - it could

flashover.  I want you to abort!  Now!

Get the hell out of there!

GIBSON

(into walkie)

Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...

FRANK

(calling back to him)

Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.

GIBSON

(charging after him)

I should'a been a fucking mailman.

BUTCH

(via walkie)

Frank, where are you?

FRANK

(into walkie)

We're in, Butch.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Time to go home, fellas.

CON ED WORKER #1

Careful.  If the hot end of those cables

hits you, it'll conduct to the water and

we're all fired.

FRANK

Go, Gibby!  Everybody move it.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(to Gibson)

Haul ass, that claw ain't gonna hold for

long...

(into walkie)

Take cover -- she's gonna flash!

FRANK

You did good, Gib.  Real good.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Elvis has left the building.

JULIA

(singing to song)

...show me 'round the smokey mountains

way down south...

FRANK

Hey, bud.

JULIA

Hey, bud.

FRANK

Looks like two weeks worth of allowance,

Chief.

JOHNNY

I know.  Sorry, Dad.

FRANK

Glad to hear that.

FRANK

(calling to Julia)

How about a little of the King?

JULIA (O.S.)

(from kitchen)

Well, why not a little of the King?

JULIA

Damn.

FRANK (O.S.)

You alright?

JULIA

I think I ruined the sauce...again.

FRANK

What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble

workin' an eight hour shift, watching the

kid and whipping up a little bolognese?

JULIA

You didn't marry Donna Reed.

FRANK

I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over

her any time.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(singing lyrics)

Caught in a trap, I can't walk out,

because I love you too much b-b-baby.

JULIA

How was your tour?

FRANK

The usual.

JULIA

(loaded)

Butch called.

FRANK

Did he?

JULIA

He did.

FRANK

It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just

getting tight in his old age.

JULIA

Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long

as you get there.

FRANK

Okay, start pedaling.

JOHNNY

Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna

fall.

FRANK

Don't think about falling, just keep

pedaling.

JOHNNY

Daddy, I'm scared.

FRANK

C'mon, Chief, show some guts.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'm gonna let go!

FRANK (CONT'D)

Don't quit on me now, Chief.

JULIA

Don't be so tough on him Frank, he's six

years old.

(softer)

He just needs to know you're right there

behind him.

JOHN

So, that's it, Sam?  You're just walking

out?

SAMANTHA

I've been walking out for the last six

months.  You didn't notice...or care.

JOHN

Fine, go ahead and save the whole world,

Sam.

(sipping his beer)

You don't gotta worry about me.

SAMANTHA

Damn you.  I tried.  But you wouldn't

help me.

JOHN

You're right.  We should've quit a long

time ago.

JOHN (CONT'D)

It's not your fault.  It's mine.  I can't

change.  Wish I could, Sam.  But I can't.

SAMANTHA

That's not true and you know it.

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Goodbye, Chief.

JOHN

What?  It don't matter, Lady.  Why?...

Cause I don't got no friends or family.

ANNOUNCER

Batting next.  Johnny Sullivan.

ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Sullivan's safe at first.  Batting for

Johnny's father is...Coach Newman.

GORDY JR.

Hi, Uncle John.

JOHN

I'm not your uncle, kid.

(yelling into kitchen)

Gordo, what are you doing here?

GORDO (O.S.)

Sully!  Is that you?

GORDO

Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.

JOHN

What the hell is that smell?

GORDO

Can you believe Ellen still won't let me

cook in the house?  I melt one lousy

frying pan, y'know?

GORDY JR.

John, guess what?  Dad's taking me

fishing.  Wanna come?

JOHN

Wish I could, Gordy.  But you bring me

back a big one.

GORDO

Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?

JOHN

I think it's somewhere in the closet...

if you can find it.

GORDO

So Yahoo went up another two points.

Man, did we miss the boat on that one.

JOHN

Coulda, woulda, shoulda, pal.

GORDO

Sam called Ellen.

GORDO (CONT'D)

Why don't you come with us?  Three days

of fresh air and barbecue would do you

some good, man.

GORDY JR. (O.S.)

Dad, John, c'mere...

GORDO

Hey, Gordy, what 'ya doing?

GORDY JR.

Dad, check it out.  Fire Department!  Can

I open it up?

GORDY JR. (CONT'D)

Wow.

GORDO

Hey!  Gimmie that!

GORDY JR.

What's this, Dad?

GORDO

John, that's your Dad's old ham radio.

Remember?  Remember how we used to beg

him to let us talk on that thing?

JOHN/GORDO

This is not a toy.

GORDY JR.

Can we try it Dad, can we try it?

JOHN

What the hell.

GORDY JR.

So this was what people used before the

Net, huh?

GORDO

Man, do I feel old.

JOHN

It's junk, kid.  Nobody uses those things

anymore.

ELLEN

Gordo, do you know what time it is?

(a beat)

Hi, John.

JOHN

Ellen.

ELLEN

C'mon Gordy, let's go.

GORDY JR.

Oh, mom...

ELLEN

You all right, John?

JOHN

Oh, yeah.

JULIA

(answering machine voice)

Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a

message after the tone.

JOHN

Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably

at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow

night.  Love you.

LARRY KING

Is this anomaly connected to the space

storm and the NASA satellite that

disappeared in 1969?

HAWKING

We don't know.  But given the

similarities of their location and

appearance, this is a question that

merits further investigation.

FRANK

(over radio)

CQ 15, here is WB2YXB, by for call.

FRANK (O.S.)

CQ 15, come in 15.

JOHN

Uh, hello?

FRANK (O.S.)

WB2YKXB, who've I got?

JOHN

(slightly slurred)

Name's John.

FRANK

Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?

JOHN

Look, I don't really remember how this

thing works.

FRANK

Listen, you can't broadcast without a

license.  Unless this is an emergency,

you gotta get off the band.

JOHN

(chuckling)

Pal, my whole life's an emergency.

FRANK

Where are you transmitting from?

JOHN

Queens, New York.

FRANK

Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and

raised.

JOHN

I thought these things were for talkin'

around the world.

FRANK

15-band closes down at night.  During the

day you can chew the band with China if

you want.

JOHN

I can't believe people are still using

these things.

FRANK

Can you hold on a second?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched

for the Series?

JOHN

(taking a swig)

I don't really follow baseball anymore.

FRANK

What?

JOHN

I got fed up with all the bullshit.

FRANK

Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a

1000 years, when school kids study

America, they're gonna learn about three

things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll,

and Baseball.

FRANK (CONT'D)

How can you live in Queens and not love

the Amazin's?

JOHN

If you're talking The Amazin' Mets, well,

that's different.  You know people talk

about Seaver, but I'll love Ron Swoboda

til the day I die.

FRANK

(through static)

I'm right with you, man.  He's got the

heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the

first game of the Series?

JOHN

Yeah.  It was all over after Buford

nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the

park.

FRANK

No way, brother.  Ain't gonna happen.

JOHN

Who the hell was that?

FRANK

Hello, Queens.  You there?

JULIA

Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.

FRANK

(a little distracted)

Sure.

FRANK

(lullaby-like)

Take me out to the ballgame, take me out

with the crowd.  Buy me some peanuts and

cracker jack...

JOHN

...I don't care if I never get back.

FADE TO BLACK.

SATCH

Lucky throw, fire boy.

FRANK

(jogging in)

Luck, my ass.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(to Johnny)

See that, kid.  Practice.  Practice.

SATCH

(as they walk)

Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You

ain't ever gonna catch another one like

that.

JOHN

She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is

gonna change it.

SATCH

Nothing you're willing to do.

JOHN

What's the story?

UNIFORM

Survey crew found a body.  Actually a

skeleton.  Over here.

SATCH

Be real careful when pulling it out.  And

get the dirt around it.

JOHN

I think I'll visit the neighbor.

JOHN

Thanks.

MR. SHEPARD

Used to get breakfast there all the time

back from the boat.  Them Greeks were

good people.  Once that McDonalds opened

up on Dyckman, they lost all their

business.

JOHN

Your son on the job?

MR. SHEPARD

Was.  Carl died in the line of duty.

October '69.

JOHN

I'm sorry.

MR. SHEPARD

My boy lived and bled blue.

JULIA

(calling out)

I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.

JOHN (O.S.)

Sounds good.

JULIA

(walking into the other room)

I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.

JOHN

(lying badly)

Yeah, those grad school applications are

driving her crazy.

JULIA

I'm sure everything'll work out.

(beat)

She really loves you...

JOHN

(changing the subject)

So how are things at the hospital?

JULIA

Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last

month?

JOHN

No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!

JULIA

Close.

JOHN

So how'd you like LION KING?

JULIA

Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.

JOHN

I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.

JULIA

You work too hard, John.

JOHN

Look who's talking.

JULIA

29-years tomorrow.

JOHN

I wish I could remember him better.

Truth is, most of the stuff I know is

from the stories you used to tell.  But

they're not mine.  They're not my

memories.  They're yours.

JULIA

You would have liked him, John.  And he

would have liked you.

FRANK

...WB2YXB calling unidentified station,

Queens.  CQ 15.

JOHN (O.S.)

(over radio, sounds like he's

had a few drinks)

Hello?

FRANK

I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell

did you do it?

JOHN (O.S.)

Huh?

FRANK

The World Series.  You called Buford's

homer.

JOHN (O.S.)

Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened

almost thirty years ago.

FRANK

What are you talking about?  I'm talking

about this afternoon.

JOHN (O.S.)

This afternoon?

JOHNNY

Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.

FRANK

(to Johnny)

I'll be up soon, Little Chief.

FRANK (O.S.)

Sorry 'bout that.

JOHN

What'd you just say?

FRANK (O.S.)

Oh, that was my kid.

JOHN

You call your son Little Chief?

FRANK (O.S.)

Uh huh...

JOHN

What'd you say your name was?

FRANK

Frank...Frank Sullivan.

JOHN

Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that

you?  Are you fucking with me?

FRANK (O.S.)

Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...

JOHN

You're telling me your name is Frank

Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just

saw the first game of the '69

Series...live?

FRANK (O.S.)

Right...and I'm asking how you called the

game.

JOHN

Gordo, if this is you, so help me...

FRANK (O.S.)

What the hell does Gordy have to do with

it?

JOHN

What'd you say your station...uh, your

call letters were?

FRANK (O.S.)

W...B...2...YXB.

JOHN

Now you listen to me.  My name is John

Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st,

where I've lived my whole life.  And I

saw the first game of the '69 Series at

my Uncle Butch's house with my father...

FRANK (O.S.)

What?

JOHN

29-years ago.

CUT TO:

FRANK

29 years...?

JOHN

My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan,

he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets

fan.  And every night when I went to bed

he sang to me...

(softly, almost singing)

Take me out to the ball game, take me out

with the crowd...

FRANK (O.S.)

What the hell...

JOHN

I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a

dream.

FRANK (O.S.)

I'm not dreaming.

JOHN

So you're Frank Sullivan, huh?  It's 1969

and you're sitting at your desk in the

study, just chewin' the rag?

FRANK

Christ!

JOHN (O.S.)

What's going on?

FRANK

(lying)

Nothing...I just spilled something.

CUT TO:

JOHN

Oh my god.

FRANK (O.S.)

What?

JOHN

You just burned the desk.

FRANK (O.S.)

What's happening?

JOHN

You burnt the desk...I can see it.

FRANK

That's impossible.

JOHN (O.S.)

What if it's not...

JOHN (CONT'D)

Dad...?

FRANK (O.S.)

Johnny...?

FRANK (CONT'D)

How could this be happening?

JOHN

I don't know.

FRANK

We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun

spot of all time.

JOHN

Sun spot?

FRANK

Yeah, that's how Hams work.

JOHN

Wait a sec...there was something on the

news.  Something about this space

anomaly.  I think they said it was

connected to some storm in '69.

FRANK

You sound...ground up...?

JOHN

I'm thirty-five years old.

FRANK

Thirty-five?  That would make it...

JOHN

1998.

FRANK

1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you?

Why are you doing this?

JOHN

I'm not doing anything.

(beat)

Look, I don't know what's going on.  But

I swear on my life, I"m here at your old

desk, on your Ham, in our house, right

now...in 1998.

FRANK

It's really you, isn't it?

JOHN

Yeah...I think so.

FRANK

Thirty-five?  Jesus, you're almost as old

as I am...

(long beat)

What's your life like?  You married?  Got

kids?

JOHN

No, not yet.

FRANK

Too busy playin' ball, huh?

JOHN

Nah, I gave it up.

FRANK

You happy?

FRANK (CONT'D)

You're still my Little Chief, right?

JOHN

I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.

(pausing)

It's good to hear your voice.

(quiet beat)

I missed you...so much.

JOHN (CONT'D)

(re: static)

What's that?

FRANK

I think I'm losing you.

JOHN

No wait, don't go!

FRANK

It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.

JOHN

But you're not...you're not still here.

FRANK

What are you talking about?

JOHN

I lost you.

FRANK

What?

JOHN

I never knew you, Dad.

FRANK

Why?

JOHN

Fire.

FRANK

On the job?

JOHN

It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by

lightening.

(beat)

Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn.

Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with

the training, with your instincts.

(beat)

If you'd just gone left instead of right,

you would've made it.

FRANK

That can't be...that's not gonna happen.

JOHN

It did, Pop.  It did.

FRANK

When?

JOHN

October 12, 1969.

FRANK

But that's tomorrow.

JOHN

(fully realizing)

Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened.

It doesn't have to happen.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...

FRANK

I don't understand.

GORDO

(sliding open window)

Sull!  What the hell!

JOHN

I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my

Dad.

GORDO

C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over.

We'll play some Nintendo.

JOHN

No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he

doesn't go in.

GORDO

Go in where?

JOHN

The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's

tomorrow.

GORDO

I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine

years tomorrow.

GIBSON

Oh, man. Robinson is gonna nail it and

we're gonna be dead.

BUTCH

Let's move it, gentlemen...three alarm.

Lit up abandoned warehouse.  West 49th.

GIBSON

Sully, you cool?

GIBSON (CONT'D)

Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?

FRANK

I'm alright, Gibby.

GORDO

How you feeling?

JOHN

Better.

SATCH

You get your roof fixed?

GORDO

Can you believe it, Yahoo goes up another

point today...

GIBSON

Bastard's moving fast.

BUTCH

Thank God it's abandoned.

(to the men)

Surround and drown...nobody goes in.

FRANK

Hear that?

BUTCH

What?

GIRL

Help!  Help!  Oh, god.  Help.  She's up

there.  She's trapped!  Please!

FRANK

Hey, hey.  It's gonna be okay.  We're

gonna help.  Okay?   Okay.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Now tell me, who's up there?

GIRL

My girlfriend, Molly.

FRANK

Where?

GIRL

In a room...an office...or something.  We

live there.  Top floor.  Something fell

on her.  I couldn't help her.  Please,

you gotta...gotta...

GORDO

You realize that if you'd bought a

thousand dollars worth of Yahoo in '96,

it'd be worth fifty-grand today?

SATCH

You doin' okay, John?

JOHN

Tough day, you know.

GORDO & SATCH

To your dad.

JOHN

To my dad.

FRANK

It looks open on the other side.

GIBSON

Don't know what's behind it.

FRANK

One way to find out.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(screaming over fire)

Get out...while you still can...

FRANK (CONT'D)

(soft)

...it's not your time.

GIBSON (O.S.)

(over walkie)

Gotta be another way up, Frank.

FRANK

(into walkie)

Then fuckin' find it.

(heading in)

I'm going for the girl.

BUTCH (O.S.)

(over walkie)

Billy, you better get up top.

ROOF MAN

This is Billy, Frank. I'm on my way.

South side.

FRANK

(reaching 6th floor)

Glad to hear it.  See you on top.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(into walkie)

I've found the girl.

FRANK

(into walkie)

It's real hot in here, Billy.  I'm coming

out quick.

ROOF MAN

I'm jammed up here, Frank!

FRANK

Oh mother...

BUTCH

What the fuck, GINO!  Tell me!

LADDER OPERATOR/GINO

Gear box cracked, Butch.  We're fucked.

BUTCH

(into walkie)

Frank!  Frank!

FRANK

I know, Butch.  I know.

JOHN (V.O.)

...one wrong turn...

(beat)

If you'd just gone left.

GORDO

...principal calls us in 'cause Gordy

hacked into the school system - sent out

a little X-rated e-mail.

(nervous laughter)

Scary, huh?  Eight-years old.

SATCH

Just keep him away from girls.

SATCH (CONT'D)

(repeat)

Just keep him away from girls.

GIBSON

You okay, man?

FRANK

(starting to giggle)

Elvis has left the building.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(soft)

Little Chief.

GORDO

John.  John, you all right?

JOHN

(a whisper)

Longbranch...?

GORDO

What?

SATCH

You're not looking too good.

JOHN

Whoa, I just...I just...

GORDO

What is it?

JOHN

My father didn't die in a fire?

GORDO

Huh?

JOHN

My father didn't die in a fire?

GORDO

Fire?  What are you talking about?  He

had cancer, John.

JOHN

Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right?

The cigarettes?

GORDO

Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.

SATCH

Maybe you outta lay off a little...

JOHN

Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to

him, it was real.

GORDO

Huh?

JOHN

The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't

die in the fire.

FRANK

(into radio mic)

Johnny?  Johnny?  You there?  C'mon,

Chief, answer me...

FRANK (CONT'D)

Chief?

(louder)

Chief, are you there?

JOHNNY (O.S.)

I'm right here, Daddy.

FRANK

It's okay, Chief.

(beat)

C'mere.

FRANK

Okay, partner, whatta you say we tame

this bronco.

JOHNNY

I'm scared.

FRANK

Don't be scared.  This time I'm right

behind you if you fall.

JOHNNY

Daddy, Daddy, I can't.

FRANK

No, but we can.  We can do it together.

Spirit and guts, Chief.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Take your time.  I'm not gonna let go

'til you say okay.

FRANK (CONT'D)

You ready?

JOHNNY

Wait...

FRANK

I'm right here behind you...

JOHNNY

Okay!

FRANK

(clapping)

Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it!

Way to go, Chief!

JOHNNY

I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!

FRANK

(under his breath)

Atta boy.

JOHN

Oh my God...

FRANK (O.S.)

(through radio)

...can you hear me?

CUT TO:

JOHN (O.S.)

(through radio)

Dad...?

FRANK

Chief?!  Is that you?

JOHN

Yeah, it's me.

FRANK

You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If

you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever

made it.

JOHN

Dad, you there?  You okay?

FRANK

Yeah.  I'm okay.

(beat)

What about you?  I want to know.  About

you.  And your mom.

JOHN

We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing

good.

FRANK

Tell me.

JOHN

It's hard to explain.  Something happened

today.  It was like a dream.  And when I

woke up I had all these new memories.

Good times.  Times we never had before.

FRANK

I'm glad.

JOHN

Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you

should know.  Cause I still remember.

FRANK

What, Johnny?  What is it?

JOHN

What it was like when you died in the

fire...

JOHN (cont'd)

We needed you.  I needed you.  So many

times...I wished for you.  But you

weren't there for me.

(beat)

Mom tried.  But she was hurting.  I used

to hear her, every night, for years,

crying herself to sleep.

FRANK

I didn't think...

JOHN

Well, you think about it.  And you

remember, cause I don't wanna lose you

again.  I don't ever want Mom...

FRANK

(over static)

You won't.  I swear to God you won't.  I

love you, son.

JULIA'S VOICE

(through answering machine)

Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a

message after the tone.

JOHN

Ma, it's me.  Call me.  We gotta talk.

JULIA

Frank...what's wrong?

FRANK

Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.

FRANK (cont'd)

(whisper)

I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules.  For the

rest of your life.

JULIA

Frankie, what is it?

JULIA (cont'd)

I got a bad feeling today...I was

worried.

FRANK

I'm here.  Bruised but not broken.

JULIA

Where's Johnny?

FRANK

I tucked him in at Gordo's.

JULIA

You give him his drops?

FRANK

One in each ear.

(beat)

What would you do without me?

JULIA

Probably marry some rich doctor and never

have to work...

JULIA (cont'd)

What's he doing?  Frank, I gotta...

JULIA

Excuse me doctor, is that Benazepril?

INTERN

Yes.

JULIA

I gave this patient 50 mills of Benedryal

on admittance.

(unhooking I.V. bag)

Mix them and he's dead.

INTERN

Why wasn't I made aware?

JULIA

It's in his chart.

FRANK

(mouthing to words)

I love you, Bud.

JULIA

(mouthing back)

I love you more.

CASHIER (V.O.)

Noah's Deli.  Can you hold?

CASHIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Noah's Deli.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

Can I help you?

JOHN

(relaxed)

I'm looking for Julia Sullivan.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

I think you have the wrong apartment.

JOHN

But this is her place.  910 Riverside.

Apartment 3C.

JAMAICAN WOMAN

I'm sorry, but no one by that name lives

here.

JOHN

What?

SATCH

Another rough night, huh?  That it?

JOHN

Yeah.  That's it.

SATCH

Do not disrespect me.  Disrespect

yourself all you want.  But not me.  Or

anybody else around here.  You got that?

SATCH (CONT'D)

This is getting real old, John.  And I'm

tired up to here with it...

JOHN

I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...

SATCH

And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't

need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can

count on.

(pause; softens)

I care about you.  Not cause of me and

your old man.  Not cause of your mom.

But because of you.

SATCH (CONT'D)

We got the preliminary forensics on that

skeleton.

(opening door to the squad)

Your gonna want to look at it.

SATCH

Bad memories...

(re: photo)

You imagine the odds...us diggin' up a

Nightingale Murder?

SATCH (CONT'D)

She makes ten.

JOHN

Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three.

He killed three women.

SATCH

What're you talking'?  You know better

than anybody, John.  You've read this

file a thousand times.

JOHN

No.

FRANK & JOHNNY

(very soft)

Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack...I

don't care if I never get back...

JULIA

Boy is he excited about the game

tomorrow.

FRANK

He ain't the only one.

JULIA

I'm off.

FRANK

(turning to her)

Wish you weren't.

JULIA

(stepping to him)

Do you know how much I love you?

FRANK

Yeah, actually I do.

SAMANTHA

John, are you all right?

JOHN

What are you doing here?

SAMANTHA

Ellen said you were working.  I just

wanted to pick up the rest...

JOHN

Dad, you there?  Can you here me?

(silence)

Dad?  I need you to be there.

FRANK (O.S.)

(through radio)

Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last

night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.

JOHN

Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...

FRANK

Are you alright"?

JOHN

(sipping Bushmills)

Something happened, something...

FRANK

What?  Johnny, what's wrong?

JOHN

It's Mom.

FRANK

What?  What is it?

JOHN

She's not here.

FRANK

Whatta you mean she's not here?

JOHN

She...she died.  It's like it just

happened.

FRANK

She just died, your mother just died?

JOHN

No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a

long time ago for me.

FRANK

When?

JOHN

October 22, 1969.

FRANK

Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from

now.

(beat)

How?

FRANK (CONT'D)

Johnny, I gotta know.

JOHN

She was murdered.

FRANK

Murdered?  Why?

JOHN

There was this case.  A serial.  He

murdered three women, all nurses, between

'68 and '69.  The papers called them the

Nightingale Murders.  They never caught

him.  But the killings just stopped.

FRANK

What kinda twisted animal.

JOHN

Dad, we did something.  Something to make

it worse.

FRANK

Whatta you mean...

JOHN

He didn't just kill three women anymore.

He killed ten.

FRANK

What are you talking about?

JOHN

Something we did changed the

case...changed history.

(beat)

Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you

didn't die in the fire something must

have happened.  And this guy, this

Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it

was like a spree...seven more women.

FRANK

I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna

take your mother away.  He can't hurt her

if I take her away.

JOHN

I don't know...

(beat)

What about the other women?

FRANK

I'll warn them.

JOHN

That'll never work.  They'll just think

you're crazy.

FRANK

What can we do?  You don't even know who

this guy is.

JOHN

No.  Nobody got...

(realizing)

Wait a minute.  I might not know who he

is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I

got the case file.  We know what he's

gonna do before he does it.

FRANK

So what should I do?  Call the police?

You think they'll believe me?

JOHN

They will if they catch him in the act.

You can make that happen, Dad.  You can

tail the victim and call it in at just

the right moment.

FRANK

I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter.

This is...this is different.

JOHN

I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I

do.

JOHN (CONT'D)

You ever talk to a victim's family?  The

one's left behind?  They don't act like

what you'd think.  There's panic and

fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this

logic problem.  And if they could only

solve it, everything would be okay.

(a breath)

But if you look real close - look at

their eyes - you can see it.  Just a

glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They

know their world is never gonna be the

same.

FRANK

What if the radio stops working?  Christ,

what if I can't reach you again?

JOHN

Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad,

those other women weren't supposed to

die.  We don't try to stop this guy,

we're gonna live with that for the rest

of our lives.

FRANK

What do I gotta do?

JOHN

The next victim was Karen Reynolds...It

happens tomorrow.

(reading)

Case file says she left St. Vincents at

six.  Show'd up at Cozy's Bar around six

thirty.  She walked outta that bar around

seven-thirty.  They found her dead in an

empty lot behind the place at eight

o'clock.

FRANK

Why not just get the cops to watch the

bar?

JOHN

They'll question her.  Whatever they tell

her could change what happens.

(beat)

No, I want you to follow her.  See if

anybody's watching her, hittin' on her.

I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta

that bar with her.  When they do, you

call the cops.

FRANK (V.O.)

What do I tell them?

JOHN (V.O.)

Tell 'em there's a homicide in

progress... cause by the time they show

up there will be.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Hey, Chuck.

BARTENDER

Hey, Karen.

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Is that really how you got the Son of

Sam?  Parking tickets?

SATCH

Any word on our bones?

YOUNG DETECTIVE

But how'd you think of it?

SATCH

You're pulling over with a .44 bulldog

tucked in your pants getting ready to

blow somebody's brains out...I  figure

the last thing you're thinking about is

alternate side of the street parking.

JOHN

That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky

break.

SATCH

That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was

smarts and ten plus on the job.

BARTENDER

From the girls, pal.  All of 'em.

FRANK

I was, uh, I'm not really...

YOUNG WOMAN #1

(noting Frank's jacket)

Fireman, huh?

FRANK

(noting wedding ring)

A married fireman.

YOUNG WOMAN #3

Oh, what the hell.  Have a seat.  What's

your name, fireman?

FRANK

Frank.

KAREN

Do I know you?

FRANK

I don't think so.

KAREN

(puts it together)

From the Korean market up the street.

(laughing)

Mr. Lee make you pay for those veggies.

YOUNG WOMAN #1

You following her, Frank?  You're not

some kind of stalker or something?

FRANK

I follow fires, nothing else.

JOHN

(grabbing the phone)

Sullivan.

(beat)

You're kiddin'...

(grabbing pen; scribbling)

JOHN (CONT'D)

Mario, you are the best...right, right,

right.  Spell it out for me.

FRANK

Yeah, it was a close call, but...

KAREN

Close!  The news said it was a miracle

you guys got out alive!

FRANK

Close is just close if you're still alive

to talk about it, y'know/

JOHN

Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental.

Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16,

1968.

SATCH

(looking at corkboard)

April 16...?  That means she was the

first.

JOHN

Which means he probably knew her.

SATCH

This case just got hot.  We pull on this

string...

JOHN

(whisper)

Dad...

JULIA

(a stretch and a yawn)

I think I'm gonna head up, take a shower.

(slight smile)

You wanna tuck the monster in and join

me?

JULIA (CONT'D)

What's the matter?

FRANK

There's something I gotta take care of.

Something I need to tell you about.

JULIA

Okay...

FRANK

I've been talking to this...guy...this

cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...

JULIA

Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.

FRANK

I've been talking to Johnny...on the

radio.

JULIA

I know.  He loves that thing.

FRANK

No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's

Johnny...but not now...in the future.

JULIA

Sounds like fun.

JULIA (CONT'D)

I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.

FRANK

I'm serious.

JULIA (O.S.)

So am I.

JOHN'S VOICE

(over static)

Karen Reynolds is alive and well.  We did

it, Dad.

FRANK (O.S.)

(over the HAM)

I'll be damned.

JOHN

Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?

FRANK

No.  I just kept talking to her.

(beat)

There was a lot of guys in that bar -

could'a been any of 'em.

JOHN

It's okay.  This is working.  This is

gonna work.

FRANK

Whatta we do now?

JOHN

(consults file)

Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment

3C.  Tomorrow.

(skimming file)

She's a nursing student.  Paying her way

as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint

Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A

M...killed in her apartment, between two

thirty and five.

FRANK

Got it.

JOHN

Dad, I think I may be able to get you

enough information to make sure the DA

can nail this bastard.

FRANK

How?

JOHN

Coupla days ago they dug up a body in

Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl

disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was

his first kill.  Which means he probably

knew her.  Most serials know their first

victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see

if I can put any of this together...

FRANK

All right, I'm with you.

(beat)

I just hope we know what the hell we're

doing.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me

about the future.

JOHN

(lighting up a Marlboro)

Well they found out cigarettes give you

lung cancer.

FRANK

What else, John.  It must be different,

huh?  Are people living on the moon?

JOHN

Didn't happen, we got enough problems

down here.

FRANK

What are we like in...1998?

JOHN

(lying)

We're okay...we're good, Dad.

FRANK

(groping for good news)

Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull

it off?

JOHN

You really wanna know?

FRANK

Yeah, you betcha.

JOHN

Well, game five was the big one.  It

turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were

down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the

foot - left a scuff mark on the ball.

Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2

2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis

slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie.

Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We

won, Pop.

FRANK

Wow.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Hang on a sec, John.

JOHN

(over the HAM)

You there?

FRANK

Jules, I want you to say hello to

somebody...

(re: radio)

I'm on with John - that guy I told you

about.

JULIA

The future guy?

FRANK

Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good

guy, a real good guy...

FRANK (CONT'D)

John, say hello to my wife...Julia.

JOHN

H-hi.

JULIA

Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a

cop?

JOHN

Yeah, that's right.

JULIA

My six year-old here keeps telling me he

wants to be a policeman.  Right after he

retires from the majors.  We just gave

him a badge and a whistle for his

birthday.

JOHN

Yeah...I remember.

(smiling)

I used to play cops and robbers but y--

...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.

JULIA

You're mom sounds like she's got some

smarts.

JOHN

She's pretty special.

JULIA

Are you a good cop, John?

JOHN

I try to be.

JULIA

Then I'll bet she's real proud of you,

huh?

JOHN

Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud

I was of her.

JULIA

I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...

(beat)

But she knew, John.  A mother knows

what's in her son's heart.

JULIA (CONT'D)

I better go.  It's been good talking with

you.

GORDO

I wanna talk on the radio.

GORDO (CONT'D)

This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an

intergalactic traveler from the

Federation planet earth.

JOHN

Gordo?

GORDO

How'd you know my name, mister?

JOHN

Hey, Gordo.  My name is Santa Clause.

And I'm gonna give you the biggest

Christmas present you ever had.

GORDO

I better give you my address then.

JOHN

Oh don't worry kid, I know where you

live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and

write this down, buy Yahoo.

You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o.

It's a magic word and I never want you to

forget it.

GORDO

You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.

FRANK

John, you still there?

JOHN

I'm right here, Dad.

FRANK

You all right?

JOHN

Yeah, I think so...

FRANK

Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let

anything happen to her...no matter what.

JOHN'S VOICE

Can I keep these for a little while?

FINELLI

Detectives' been through that stuff

already back then.

FINELLI (CONT'D)

You'll bring them back soon?

JOHN

Promise.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Do you know this?

FINELLI

Mary volunteered over at St. Vincents'

after school.  She loved it...was going

to become a doctor.

FINELLI (CONT'D)

Her room...I just couldn't...it should

only be her room...you know?

FINELLI (CONT'D)

I'm happy you found her, Detective.  It

makes it easier...now, to know for sure.

You know?

JOHN

Okay, lemme walk you through it.

SATCH

Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can

concentrate better.

JOHN

Three guys show up in both the yearbook

and diary.

JOHN

The third one is Daryl Adams.

JOHN (CONT'D)

I ran him through BCI...got a hit.

Busted for sexual assault: March 22,

1970.  Eight days after the last

Nightingale murder.

SATCH

So you figure the murders stop 'cause

he's off the street.  Then by the time he

gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to

control himself?

JOHN

Not the first time that's been true.  I'm

telling you, I got a feeling about this

guy.  This is the guy, Satch.

SATCH

Uh, huh.

JOHN

What?

SATCH

I'm just trying to figure what interests

me more: the possibility that Daryl is

the guy, or you making him absolutely the

guy.

DARYL

That was over thirty years ago.  I paid

for that and then some.

JOHN

You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?

DARYL

Yeah.

JOHN

You remember Mary Finelli?

DARYL

(mentally steps back)

What are you saying?

JOHN

You know what I'm saying.

DARYL

No, I don't.

JOHN

Well, I think you do.

SISSY

Give me a couple Bloodys, Gus, and a

Dewars on the rocks.

SISSY (CONT'D)

How ya doin' there?

FRANK

Just fine.  You?

SISSY

Right now, just fine.  Ask me later,

fireman.

JOHN

Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But

you got lucky, right?  You got away with

something else.  Something you figured

nobody knows about.

DARYL

What I know is what I told you.

JOHN

Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You

went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You

lived five blocks from her.  You liked

her.  But she ain't interested.  That

must've hurt, huh?

DARYL

So what?

JOHN

So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?

DARYL

Nothing.

BARTENDER

You spare a smoke?

FRANK

I'm trying to quite.  Turns out those

things'll kill you.

DARYL

Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you

showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS!

Get those away from me!

JOHN

Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli.

These names mean anything to you,

asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean

anything?  She means something to me!

WOMAN

You fight fires, honey?

FRANK

Yep.  That's what I do.

WOMAN

I bet you do.

BARTENDER

Last call.

SATCH

I gotta take a leak.

(to Daryl)

You need to use the head?  You can,

y'know.  If you want to.

SISSY

See you, Fireman.  Don't talk so much

next time.

JOHN

You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all

the training we cops go through. Despite

all that we are taught about right and

wrong.  Despite all that we would like to

honor in ourselves, we can come to a

place where we don't give a fuck.  Know

what I mean?

JOHN (CONT'D)

You are going to tell me what I need to

know, Daryl.

SATCH

John.

SATCH (CONT'D)

Got a minute?

JOHN

Yeah.  Sure.

SATCH

He ain't our guy, John.

JOHN

Just cause he didn't want to look at the

photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer.

Not everyone fits the profile.

SATCH

If he was gonna give something up he

would'a done it already.

KILLER

You following me?

KILLER (CONT'D)

I asked you a question, asshole.

FRANK

(barely able to speak)

Mary Finelli...

KILLER

Who the fuck are you?

STONED MAN #1

Whoa, dude.  Is he okay?

KILLER

Yeah.  He just needs a little time

kissing the porcelain.

FRANK

OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR...ah...ummm...THIS

IS THE POLICE.

FRANK (CONT'D)

It's okay, Ma'am.  I'm the police.

FRANK

He killed her John.  He killed her and I

didn't do a thing to stop it.

JOHN

It's not your fault, Dad.

FRANK

Yes it is...we did this.  We changed

everything.

(pausing)

I've been having bad dreams, Johnny.

Dreams where I die...in the fire.

(soft)

I was supposed to die in that warehouse.

JOHN

No.

FRANK

This is wrong...it's like we cheated...

JOHN

I know...

(beat)

But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't

die in that fire.  And no matter what you

do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all

we can do is deal with this...and try to

make it right.

FRANK

I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I

can't.   I can't stop this guy.

JOHN

But we can, we can do it together.

Spirit and guts, remember?

FRANK

Johnny, I know, but...

JOHN

I need you to believe in me.  To believe

that we can do this.

FRANK

John, he's got my driver's license.

JOHN

What?

FRANK

He took my driver's license, John, he

knows where we live.

JOHN

He took your wallet?

FRANK

No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the

license.

JOHN

He touched your wallet!  Where's your

wallet?

FRANK

In my pocket.

JOHN

We got him!  Dad you got him!

FRANK

What?

JOHN

His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll

run them through criminal index.  You

gotta get me that wallet.

FRANK

How the hell am I gonna do that?

JOHN

(thinks)

Listen to me, very carefully, take your

wallet out, just touch it on the corners.

FRANK

What...

JOHN

Please, Dad, just do it.

FRANK

Okay, okay...

FRANK (CONT'D)

I got it.

JOHN

Right, now I need you to tape it up on

the outside, where he touched it, so the

prints keep.

FRANK

Huh?

JULIA

Then you gotta hide it somewhere.

Somewhere where nobody's gonna find

it...for 29 years!

(looking around the room)

Put it under the loose floorboard by the

window!

FRANK

(getting it now)

I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!

JOHN

It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop

him.

FRANK

Hang on.

FRANK (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(over the HAM)

Okay.

JOHN

We're in business.  Just sit tight...and

don't worry.

JOHN

What the hell?

JOHN (CONT'D)

The old neighbor's son...the cop.  But

he's dead.

HECTOR

What are you talkin' about?  I know this

prick.  He worked outta Brooklyn North.

JOHN

(realizing)

He never died...

JOHN

Just came by to wrap up over there.

Thought I'd say "hello."

SHEPARD

Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup

of coffee?

JOHN

(beat)

Wife around?

SHEPARD

(a startled half-laugh)

No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart.

Been dead 29 years.

JOHN

Oh.  Sorry.  How so?

MR. SHEPARD

Well, she, Eve was murdered, Detective.

An ugly one to tell you the truth.

MR. SHEPARD (CONT'D)

The mother of a cop, and they never found

the bastard who did it.

JOHN

Happens that way sometimes.

(beat)

Son still on the job?

MR. SHEPARD

Nah.  Doin' P.I. work now.  Got caught up

in them Knapp Hearings.  Set up by some

dirty cops who needed a fall guy.  Hurt

him bad.  Would've broken his mother's

heart.

JOHN

You used to be on the job?

SHEPARD

Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?

JOHN

I look familiar?

SHEPARD

(looking him over)

No.  What house you work?

JOHN

The 2-3.  Homicide.

SHEPARD

A hot shot, huh?

JOHN

Nah, just working the job.

SHEPARD

I hear that.

JOHN

As a matter of fact, I caught a case that

goes back to your day...one of the

Nightingale murders.

SHEPARD

No kiddin'?

JOHN

No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared

thirty years ago.  Found her bones last

week.  Buried behind some old diner, up

by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.

SHEPARD

Huh.

JOHN

(sipping drink)

Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody

finding that girl, thirty years later.

And then the chances of hitting a

dental...forget about it.  Bets part is

she's the first victim.  She knew the

doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna

do a lot of talking.

JOHN (CONT'D)

The past is a funny thing.  We've all got

skeletons in the closet.  You just never

know when they're gonna pop up and bite

you in the ass, Carl.

SHEPARD

Who are you?

JOHN

I'm the train wreck you didn't see

coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life

away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You

just don't know it yet.

FRANK

You're telling me this maniac is a cop?

What the hell am I supposed to do with

that one?

JOHN

Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't

give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em

that it was Shepard who killed Finelli

and Clark and the others.  That he's the

Nightingale.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Tell them where Finelli's body is buried.

They'll be able to connect him to her.

Same high school.  Same class.  I'm

betting they search his place they find

some souvenirs.

FRANK

Okay, I'm on it.

(sees Satch)

Hey.

SATCH

Hello, Frank.

FRANK

What are you doing here, Satch?  You off

today?

JOHN (O.S.)

(over the HAM)

Dad, you there?

SATCH

Frank, we need to talk...

FRANK

(into radio)

John, hold on a second.

(to Satch)

I'm in the middle of something important

here.  You mind if...

FRANK (CONT'D)

Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is

here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.

SATCH

I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come

outside.

JOHN (O.S.)

(over the HAM)

Dad, what the hell is going on?

FRANK

(into mic)

Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go

away.

FRANK (CONT'D)

What is going on here, Satch?  What are

those guys doing out there?

SATCH

I think you know, Frank.

FRANK

No, I don't.

SATCH

Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do

that.

FRANK

About what?

SATCH

Let's go.  Do us both a favor.

FRANK

Okay.

(to Julia)

It's okay, Bud.  I'll be right back.

(into radio)

Stay there, John.

SATCH

Where were you last night, Frank?

FRANK

What do you mean?

SATCH

Do you know where I found this?

SATCH (CONT'D)

415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body

of a murdered woman.

FRANK

No.  This isn't what you think.

SATCH

I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go

to the precinct and talk about it.

FRANK

Okay, okay.  I need to go say something

to Julia and finish up with the guy on

the radio.

SATCH

You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.

FRANK

Trust me, Bud.  Do that for me.

FRANK

John, you there?

JOHN (O.S.)

(over the HAM)

Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?

FRANK

Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's

murder.  John...

SATCH (O.S.)

Frank.

FRANK

...you gotta help me, Chief.

SATCH

That's not the deal, Frank.  Don't do

this to your family.

JOHN (O.S.)

Dad!  Dad!  What's going on?  Satch?!

SMASH CUT TO:

FRANK

Carl Shepard.  Detective out of the 15th

precinct.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I swear, Satch.

SATCH

Uh, huh...

(beat)

Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy

you were talking to on the radio when I

came in?

FRANK

As nuts as that sounds, yes.

SATCH

Uh, huh.

FRANK

Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just

you and me.  Can I talk to you here,

alone?

SATCH

Give me a little time with this guy.

SATCH (CONT'D)

Frank, this is not the time to be worried

about covering up if you had a thing with

this girl.

FRANK

He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna

keep on...

SATCH

Are you listening to me?  You're in a

world of shit.  An eye witness has you

outside the dead girl's apartment.  We

got your prints all over the place.  Plus

the fucking driver's license, Frank.

(beat)

You gotta give me something here.

Something I can believe.

FRANK

What if I could prove it to you, Satch?

SATCH

How's that?

FRANK

What if I told you that in the bottom of

the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And

Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot.

It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the

ball.

SATCH

Frank, please...

FRANK

The next batter, Clendenon, hits one

outta the park.

SATCH

Frank, this is insane...

FRANK

In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna

hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda

are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are

gonna win 5-3.

(beat)

Go watch the game, Satch.

SATCH

Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking

game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for

Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the

Nightingale's profile.  You understand

what that means?

PHIL

His wife is here.  She wants to talk to

you.

SATCH

Whatta you want me to tell her?

FRANK

She's in harm's way.  He's gonna be

coming for her.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Promise me, as a friend.  October 22,

don't let her out of your sight.

SATCH

(after a beat)

Let's walk, get a cup of coffee.

SHEPARD

You got a collar in here for the

Nightingale murders?

DESK SGT.

Yeah.

SHEPARD

I'm working with one of the victims outta

Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot

at him?

DESK SGT.

That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.

SHEPARD

They around?

DESK SGT.

Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the

squad.

SHEPARD

Where's the collar, in the cells?

DESK SGT.

No, I think he's up in interrogation.

SHEPARD

I'll go find Hayes.

SHEPARD

On your feet.

SHEPARD (CONT'D)

Now turn around, face the wall.

SHEPARD (CONT'D)

How did you know?

FRANK

(facing the wall)

You twisted animal...

SHEPARD

Evidence says you're the animal.

(snapping garrote tight)

That's why you hung yourself.

FRANK

You try putting that thing around my neck

and I'll rip your throat out.  You want

me dead, use the gun.

SHEPARD

Let me draw you a picture.  You live at

1060 41st Ave.  You have a wife who works

at New York Hospital.  And a six-year old

at P.S. 130.

PHIL

What the hell is going on here?

FRANK

You got to help me.  He's trying to kill

me.

SHEPARD

Mind if we take it outside?

SHEPARD (CONT'D)

(to Frank)

I'll be right back.

SHEPARD

...didn't mean t step on your toes.  They

sent me up from downstairs, I thought

you'd be in there with him.

PHIL

What are you looking at him for?

PHIL

Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the

game or on the street.  It's gonna be a

riot if they pull it off.

SHEPARD

(glancing down the hall - in

direction of sound of TV)

What's the score?

TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Cleon Jones thinks he's hit.  I think the

ball hit him in the foot...

TV ANNOUNCER

Hadges is coming outta the dug out.  He's

calling for the ball.  Can we get a shot

of the ball?

SATCH

Can you excuse me for a second?

TV ANNOUNCER

There's a scuff mark on the ball!  The

umpire has reversed his decision.  He's

sending Jones to first base!

SHEPARD

(yelling over the noise)

You mind I go back at teh fire boy for a

while?  I won't lay a hand on him, just

want to see what he's got?

PHIL

Go ahead, knock yourself out.

JULIA

What's going on, Satch?

SATCH

(dumbfounded)

I don't know.

SATCH

(yelling over the madness)

He was right!  Everything he said.  He

was telling the truth.

JULIA

Then you believe him?

SATCH

Yeah I do.  You bet your life I do.

SATCH (CONT'D)

I'm on my way...

SATCH (CONT'D)

(to Julia)

Wait here, I'll send a uniform.

FRANK

(little smile)

Elvis has left the building.

SHEPARD

(over phone)

Hell-

JOHN

You have the right to remain silent.  If

you give up that right...

SHEPARD

Who the fuck is this?

JOHN

Anything you say can and will be used

against you in a court of law.

SHEPARD

Sullivan?

JOHN

You have the right to speak to an att --

SHEPARD

Fuck you, asshole.

JOHN

It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna

find you.  Real soon.

DESK SGT.

(over phone)

17th Precinct.

FRANK

Detective Deleon.

DESK SGT.

(over phone)

Hold on.

SATCH

Deleon.

FRANK

Satch, you gotta listen to me...

SATCH

Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.

FRANK

No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th

and CPW.  Come get me.

JULIA

(over phone)

Hello?

SATCH

You missed a hell of a game, Frank.

FRANK

Next time lets put some money on it.

SATCH

(to the uniform driver)

Get him home safe.

FRANK

Hey, bud.

JULIA

Frank...

FRANK (O.S.)

(over the HAM)

John, John?  You there?  Johnny?

JOHN

I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.

FRANK

We did it, John.  We stopped him.

JOHN

Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...

FRANK

What's wrong?

JOHN

I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?

JOHN

Dad?  Dad?  What's...

SHEPARD

My turn to steal your life.

SHEPARD

You're a clever fuck, fireboy.

SHEPARD

Time to meet the family.

FRANK

(struggling to breathe)

This is between you and me.

SHEPARD

Not any more.

JULIA

Hey, Bud.  Want to join me?

SHEPARD

Sure do.

SHEPARD

Nice.

FRANK

Get your fucking hands off my wife.

SHEPARD

Don't.  Don't do it, Frank.  You're not a

killer.

SHEPARD

You were the kid.  I remember now.

SHEPARD (CONT'D)

But this time, no Daddy.

FRANK

I'm still here, Chief.

GIBSON

(to pitcher)

Take it easy on him son, he's older than

Moses.

FRANK

Bring me home, son!  Bring me home!

JOHN

Hey there, Chief.

FRANK JR.

Elvis has left the building...
