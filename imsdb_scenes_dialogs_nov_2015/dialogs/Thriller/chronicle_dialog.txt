FROM ANDREW'S FIRST CAMERA.

CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on

its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around

off screen.

The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.

Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.

Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks

with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.

ANDREW (O.S.)

What do you want, I'm getting ready

for school-

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

Why is the door locked, unlock this

fucking door right now.

The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.

MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I said unlock this door. UNLOCK

THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You're drunk-

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M

DRUNK, OR-

ANDREW (O.S.)

It's seven thirty. In the AM.

You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

What're you doing in there.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm filming this.

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

What?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I bought a camera. I'm filming all

your shit from now on.

2.

There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away

from the door.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM

Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in

bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking

in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Mom? Will you say hi to the

camera?

SANDRA DETMER

Who's the audience?

ANDREW (O.S.)

The millions of people watching at

home.

SANDRA DETMER

Hello world. Do I look awful?

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, you look great.

SANDRA DETMER

I've been looking a little better,

yeah?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh yeah, definitely.

SANDRA DETMER

It's a nice camera.

EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the

street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew

carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into

the passenger side of a car.

In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.

He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the

reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school

intellectual.

MATT

I got you egg salad.

3.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh, yeah, thanks.

CUT.

They're driving.

MATT

So...Should I ask about the camera,

or-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm filming things now. I'm

filming everything.

MATT

You're filming everything.

ANDREW (O.S.)

For my mom. I'm trying to get

custody of her from my dad. She's

getting worse, and he's

not...helping, and this way, in

case something goes down-

MATT

He gets violent or whatever-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Right, it'd be evidence.

MATT

Evidence. But you're not with him

right now, but you're filming this.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Well, yeah, to add context.

MATT

Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird

dude.

CUT.

MATT (CONT'D)

Did you ever read any Auguste

Comte?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What is that?

MATT

He's this philosopher I'm reading.

4.

ANDREW (O.S.)

For school?

MATT

He's just like- his whole thing is

about being positive and like,

taking up for yourself. You should

read him, maybe, it might make you

feel- you know, improve your

outlook.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah, right.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Are you not coming in?

MATT

I'm gonna blaze a little first,

yeah?

ANDREW (O.S.)

You're going to miss first period-

ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Okay, okay.

ANDREW (O.S.)

This is my school, I guess.   This

is the hallway-

GIRL

Vote "Kaz!"

GIRL (CONT'D)

Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior

class president!

5.

ANDREW (O.S.)

...yeah-

GIRL

Every vote counts.

BRYCE (O.S.)

Yo this camera is a piece of shit.

It's like from 2004 or some shit.

WAYNE

Hey, how do I look?

(starts muscle posing)

Like this? Ooh, that's good.   Like

this? That's sexy, right?

ANDREW

Bryce, gimme my camera back-

BRYCE (O.S.)

Fuck you Andrew, shut up.   This

camera's a piece of shit.

WAYNE

You got me, let's go.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-

ANDREW (CONT'D)

(quietly, sad)

Oh come on...

6.

ANDREW (O.S.)

This is where I eat lunch, out here

on the bleachers.

CUT.   LATER.

CHEERLEADER

Hi.

ANDREW

Hey-

CHEERLEADER

Could you not videotape us, please?

It's really fucking creepy.

ANDREW

I wasn't, videotaping you, so much

as I was just-

CHEERLEADER                           ANDREW

during the-

CHEERLEADER

Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll

call security. We see you watching

us, we're not stupid, and it's

sketchy, so back off.

ANDREW

...okay.

CHEERLEADER

Is it on right now?

ANDREW

Yes.

CHEERLEADER

Turn it off.

7.

MATT

There's a party tonight.    A barn

party at Haven Hills.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I thought Haven Hills was closed.

MATT

It's abandoned, yeah. That's why

it's a good place for a party. Two

kegs.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Why are you telling me?

MATT

You wanna go? I don't wanna go

alone.

ANDREW (O.S.)

...Nah...

MATT

When was the last time you went to

a party?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't like parties.

MATT

You're a senior.     Just come, you'll

have fun.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'll think about it.

MATT

Okay, right. Andrew, can I give

you like, a pro tip?

ANDREW

Yeah?

MATT

Keep the camera at home.    It's

weird.

ANDREW

It has a purpose-

8.

MATT

I'm trying to be a good cousin,

here. This is me being your

friend, yeah? Okay?

HOWARD (O.S.)

Hey, what you doing?

COSTLY (O.S.)

Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your

fuckin camera!

HOWARD

Hey don't film me nigga, don't film

me.

COSTLY

Hey fuck off, you better run to

your house, bitch. Run to your

house and lock the door.

HOWARD

The fuck, fuck you faggot-

ANDREW

I'm uploading what I shot

today...you have to keep a back-up,

you know.

9.

MR. DETMER

When I say open this door, you open

this fucking door.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Are you sure it's here?

(beat)

Are you sure it's here, this all

looks closed-

MATT

It's here, calm down.    Listen.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh yeah.

MATT

Hey dude, don't follow me around

all night.

ANDREW (O.S.)

What?

MATT

Don't follow me around all night,

okay?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What am I supposed to do? I

thought you said you didn't want to

go alone-

10.

MATT

Talk to people?   Have a beer, I

don't know.

MONTAGED

FOOTAGE...

CASEY

Hey, what are you filming for?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh, I don't- just filming.

CASEY

What?   I'm filming for my blog!

ANDREW (O.S.)

What?

CASEY

I have a video blog!   Why are you

filming?

AUSTIN

Hey, were you filming my

girlfriend? Yes or no, were you

filming my girlfriend?

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, I wasn't filming anyone

specific, just filming the party.

AUSTIN

(beat)

Okay, good, because I don't wanna

have to beat your ass.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Okay.

AUSTIN

Don't talk back to me. Don't get

smart, okay, I'm being nice here.

I'm being nice to you.

(MORE)

11.

AUSTIN (CONT'D)

(beat)

Say okay.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Okay-

AUSTIN

Cause I know you were filming my

girlfriend dancing. I should break

your fucking nose, you know that?

You know that, I should beat your

ass right now, but I'm trying to be

nice. Fuck you.

STEVE (O.S.)

(loud, sudden)

Are you Andrew?

ANDREW (O.S.)

(startled)

What-

STEVE

Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?

(beat)

Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a

camera?

STEVE (CONT'D)

Dude, are you okay?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm Andrew.

12.

STEVE

I'm Steve Kazinsky-

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, I know.

STEVE

...yeah?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Everybody knows who you are.

STEVE

Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,

come on, bring the camera.

ANDREW (O.S.)

What?   I don't-

STEVE

Come on.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't-

STEVE

Dude, come on, we found something.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Look, I don't think we're supposed

to-

STEVE

Is there a light on that?   On your

camera?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-

STEVE

Awesome.

CUT.

13.

ANDREW (O.S.)

What were you guys doing out here?

This is way out-

STEVE

Me and your cousin were blazing a

little.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Matt's out here?

STEVE

A bunch of people were out here,

but I think they've all gone back,

now, cause we're like, obsessed

with the thing.

ANDREW (O.S.)

The what?

CUT.

STEVE

Andrew Detmer, that's right.   I

remember you from homeroom,

Freshman year.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You remember that?

STEVE

Yeah, I have a memory for faces.

I'm gonna go into politics, which

is ironic because I'm soooo fucking

high right now- probably shouldn't

be letting you videotape this-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm gonna be so rich when you're

president, you have no idea-

STEVE

Yeah, video footage of me luring

you into the woods for gay sex-

wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?

14.

MATT (O.S.)

Down here!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Matt?

STEVE

There we go. There it is.

CUT.

STEVE (V.O.)

Where is everybody?

MATT

They all left.

ANDREW (O.S.)

We're not supposed to be out here.

STEVE

Is it still making the sound?

MATT

Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?

STEVE

Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-

MATT

Here, listen.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Guys-

STEVE

You've got to get really close to

hear it.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Guys, just don't like- don't push

me, or do anything like that-

15.

STEVE (O.S.)

You've got to go closer.     Like

almost inside it.

MATT

We're not going to push you, we

just wanna get it on tape.

STEVE (O.S.)

Do you hear it?

ANDREW (O.S.)

...It's like, whispering?

STEVE (O.S.)

Listen.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Singing?

MATT (O.S.)                       STEVE (O.S.)

ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

What is that?

STEVE

We didn't dig the hole, man.

MATT

Is the sound on the camera?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't know, probably...I mean,

it's- it's kinda loud, right?

STEVE

Do you guys wanna go in and have a

look, or what-

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-

STEVE

Hold your nose.

16.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hey, wait-

STEVE (FROM THE DARK)

(faintly)

Come on!

MATT

Steve, come on, we don't know if

it's stable in there- It's probably

just the wind, we should-

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Andrew, hey, come on!

Don't...shit.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hello-

STEVE                        ANDREW (O.S.)

(suddenly appearing)           Aah!

ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Does it go down much deeper, or-

STEVE

Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,

it's like a tunnel- do you hear how

loud that's getting?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Do you think it could be like wind,

or-

STEVE

Come on, man. Come on.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Then what do you think it is?

17.

STEVE

Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in

ghosts.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Who said anything about ghosts.

CUT.

MATT

-shouldn't have come in here.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Steve's up ahead-

MATT

At first I thought this was a

solutional cave, but now...I dunno,

it's like a lava tube, or

something.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't know what you're talking

about.

MATT

Look at the walls. Look at how

smooth they are. It's just

straight shot down, I mean, we

must've already gone forty or fifty

feet-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Don't talk about it, you're making

me nervous.

MATT

You ever hear of Plato's allegory

of the cave?

ANDREW (O.S.)

No.

MATT

Nevermind.

CUT.

18.

CUT.

STEVE (O.S.)

Can you believe this, this is NUTS-

MATT

Is that, is that showing up on the

camera?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't wanna film it, it's messing

with the camera-

STEVE

Touch one!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...

CUT.

19.

MATT

-changes color, see? It must be

reacting to the heat, some kind of

exothermic reaction-

ANDREW (O.S.)

WHAT? I can't hear you over the-

you know-

STEVE

Make it change again!    This is

awesome!

STEVE (CONT'D)

AGHHHHH!

CRACK.   DIGITAL

CODE.

BLACK SCREEN.

HOLD ON BLACK.

20.

MATT

Ready?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Rolling, yeah.

MATT

Okay, ball test.   Take one.

MATT (CONT'D)

OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!

UNDERHAND!

STEVE

I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-

CUT.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Go.

STEVE (CONT'D)

AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!

MATT

WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-

CUT.

21.

ANDREW

Ah, shit.

CUT.

MATT

Is-

STEVE

`In the- penis- the penis-

MATT

I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH

WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?

ANDREW

The trick is to pretend like it's

on a plate. You get it on the

plate and then you wrap the plate

around it, and you can move it

however you want.

STEVE

Mhm.

MATT

I've been pretending I was like,

holding it in a fist, like a

floating hand.

22.

ANDREW

Yeah?   Plate's easier for me.

STEVE

Guys, check it out.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Ha!

(notices his bloody nose)

Shit, shit-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Try to imagine that your squeezing

the entire piece in your hand.

MATT

That's what I'm doing, it's just,

it's hard. You're better at this

than me, you do it.

ANDREW

(mocking)

Really?

MATT

(wowed, laughing)

Dude, holy shit!

CUT.

STEVE

Guys, listen, listen.   Samantha.

23.

SAMANTHA (ON PHONE)

I know you're over at that guy

Matt's house right now, okay, cause

they said you didn't show up for

soccer practice, but you said the

only reason you couldn't come see

Bound By Love with me was because

of soccer practice, so...You know,

I just, I don't know what to think.

I feel like we never hang out

anymore, you've just been hanging

out with those two guys for the

last like three weeks, and I...ugh,

call me back.

STEVE

What would you suggest, as like, a

course of action for me, here?

MATT

Why are you asking US for advice on

girls?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Because we're his mistress.

STEVE

-new camera's working out for you,

that's good.

CUT.

STEVE (CONT'D)

I have to admit, though, I don't

understand the filming thing.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I told you, it's just my thing for

right now.

STEVE

You don't feel like it's a little

weird? Like it puts a barrier

between you and everything?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Maybe I want a barrier.

24.

STEVE

Okay.   I respect that.

CUT.

ANDREW (O.S.)

My dad is actually a fireman, or

was, I don't know. He got injured

like two years ago, and now they

just pay him out of, like,

insurance. He doesn't do anything,

I mean he goes out during the day,

but I don't know where. He drinks

a lot.

STEVE

So how do you pay for your shit?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I do computer repair, and stuff.     I

actually make a lot of money...

STEVE

What about your mom.

ANDREW (O.S.)

My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-

she can't work or anything, and the

insurance doesn't cover all of her

medicine, so a lot of my money has

to go into that. I figure if I get

enough on camera, maybe I can, I

dunno, get custody of her or

something.

CUT.

STEVE

I've actually been having some

problems with my parents, too.

ANDREW (V.O.)

Yeah?

STEVE

Nothing like yours, though.   Not-

Never mind.

25.

STEVE (CONT'D)

They've just been fighting a lot.

I think my mom is cheating on my

dad.

ANDREW (O.S.)

...That's intense.

STEVE

Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah,

I'm sure my mom is cheating on my

dad.

ANDREW (O.S.)

How-

STEVE

I just, you know, I saw some stuff.

It's weird, you don't think about

your parents as like...people, or

whatever. I don't know.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Don't tell anybody about that-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Haha no of course, no way.

STEVE

Good.

MATT

See last night, alone, I got my

whole bed off the ground. No

nosebleed.

STEVE

Yeah, I was doing weights, too.

26.

MATT

Weights, like-

STEVE

Free-weights, a barbell. I got up

to two hundred pounds before I

bled.

MATT

So it's, yeah, this is my theory-

it's like a vagina. Like it's

elastic, but if you stretch it too

far too quick it'll tear-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Ew-

MATT

And that's why we're getting

better. We're loosening up.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Couldn't that metaphor just be for

any muscle in the human body, like

working out or-

STEVE

No, I like braingina.   Braingina is

the shiiiiit.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I think it's time we took this out

of the backyard.

STEVE

If anyone criticizes you, just call

them a hater. It's like calling

someone a racist, they'll just drop

whatever they're complaining about

and be like "I'M NOT A HATER."

Nobody wants to be a hater.

27.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Just stay back a little ways, yeah-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I got it.

STEVE (O.S.)

That girl, with the cart.

MATT (O.S.)

She's chasing- she's chasing it-

CUT.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I got this.

STEVE (O.S.)

Oh my god Andrew, look-

CUT.

28.

MATT (O.S.)

See that guy chewing gum?

ANDREW (O.S.)

Umm...

(camera finds the guy)

Got him.

MATT

I'm gonna get the gum right out of

his mouth- watch this.

STEVE

(laughing)

GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We

don't need to run, we don't need to

run!

MATT

That was a good one, you got that

one far.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hey Matt.

(beat)

Do you like me?

MATT

What?

(beat)

Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't,

always-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Why not?

MATT

Don't get mad, I mean, I like you

now, I like you a lot. You're

just, you're not super easy to talk

to. You've got a lot of-

29.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You're an asshole.

MATT

See, that's what I'm saying.

You're hostile, man.

ANDREW (O.S.)

(beat)

You know, you...If you hadn't

invited me to that party, none of

this would've happened.

MATT

Yeah.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Thanks.

STEVE (O.S.)

I just always feel like I miss

stuff.

MATT (O.S.)

We were just sitting around

throwing rocks, it was nothing.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah, until all those chicks showed

up.

STEVE (O.S.)

What?   Shut up.

MATT (O.S.)

Okay, here we go, here we go.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Are you sure there's no one around-

MATT (O.S.)

There's no one, I just looked, just

go, ready?

(beat)

Ready?

(MORE)

30.

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Okay, Andrew, remember, get under

it, you're the strongest, Steve get

the sides, I'll get the front and

back, we gotta do this quick.

Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO.

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Steve Steve Steve-

STEVE (O.S.)

Got it, got it.

STEVE (CONT'D)                  MATT (O.S.)

blood-

MATT

(beat)

My braingina is having like

a...face period.

STEVE

Yeah, you got some from your ears,

too. You've gotta start working it

out more, Matt.

MATT

Yeah man, in between my yoga.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You just need focus, Matt.

MATT

Ha.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You're lucky you got the kleenex,

I'm stuck with the taco bell

wrapper.

31.

MATT

That's like, at least twice as much

blood as I usually see on a taco

bell wrapper.

STEVE

Guys, guys. Look.

STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Ignore us!

MATT (O.S.)

We're

(beat)

Mormons!

MATT

-sfucking insane, we just changed

her life. We did-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Her face, I can't get her face out

of my head.

STEVE

That was fucking great. I mean,

this just gives me so many ideas,

already, stuff we could do-

MATT

Oh come on, what is this?

32.

STEVE

He's like right on your bumper,

too.

MATT

Can you fucking believe this guy?

STEVE

He's just some asshole redneck,

look at him. He's fucking with us.

MATT

I don't know what to do, what

should I-

ANDREW (O.S.)

(laughing)

Here, take the camera, take the

camera.

ANDREW (CONT'D)

Abracadabra.

STEVE (O.S.)

...I...what...

MATT (O.S.)

What the fuck did you do, man, what

the fuck-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I didn't mean to, I didn't-

33.

MATT (O.S.)

Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with

you, look at this, fuck!

STEVE (O.S.)

Is he still in there? If he's in

there we have to get him out-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry,

okay-

STEVE (O.S.)

Fuck that, take your fucking

camera.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You don't have to- I mean I can-

MATT

Andrew, just stop, just stop doing

things.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Are you mad?

MATT

Stop, just stop.

CUT.

34.

REDNECK ASSHOLE

-what happened, cause...I don't

know....my truck, my truck...

ANDREW (O.S.)

Is he okay?

MATT

Yes, just past White Crescent

bridge. Down by the- yes-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Is that the cops, are you calling

the cops?

MATT

(ignoring him)

Yeah, just come- no, I don't know.

I don't know, maybe internal

bleeding, or-

CUT.

LOCAL OFFICER

-looks like he'll be okay. Lucky

you guys were here. Is that on?

You can go ahead and turn that off.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't see how you guys can be so

angry-

MATT

You don't see how we can be angry?

You put a man in the hospital for

fucksakes. You put a man in the

hospital, you hurt somebody-

35.

ANDREW (O.S.)

He was being an asshole- he- I

didn't mean to-

MATT

Which part of that do you mean, do

you mean he was being an asshole,

or was it an accident? Was it an

accident, Andrew, cause you're the

strongest. Listen, with this, we

can't fuck around, ever.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Then what've we been doing, we've

been fucking around-

MATT

NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you

can't use it on people, or hurt

people like- Steve, help me out.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I-

MATT

We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you

can't use it on living things.

Rule #2, you can't use it when

you're angry-

ANDREW (O.S.)

You can't just declare rules,

you're not-

MATT

I will fucking declare rules, okay?

If we keep going, and getting

stronger, we need rules. We need

rules.

(beat)

Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-

SNAP TO BLACK.

CUT.   LATER.

36.

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

(from downstairs)

Andrew! Answer the fucking phone!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Did he say what it was about?   When

he called, what did he say?

ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Are you still mad at me?

MATT

I'm not mad.

ANDREW (O.S.)

(beat)

You seem mad.

MATT

...Power corrupts, is all I'm

saying, man.

ANDREW

What does that even mean?

MATT

I just mean that we have to think

about things more now, okay? We

can't just DO things, we have to

think first.

ANDREW

...I understand.

37.

MATT

It's just- nah, nevermind, we're

here.

STEVE (O.S.)

Hey kids.

MATT

Steve?   Where are you?

CUT.

STEVE

Just try it, it's easy.

ANDREW (O.S.)

That doesn't look easy.

STEVE

You throw yourself at the ground.

You just fall, and catch yourself,

and then it's easy, I swear. Don't

try to jump or you'll flip

yourself.

CUT.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Let me try-

MATT

Yeah.    I'm done for now.

CUT.

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

No cars, no cars, go.

HOLY SHIT! HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY

SH-

STEVE (O.S.)

Hey Matt, you're finally good at

something!

MATT

(loud)

What? The wind!

STEVE (O.S.)

I said you're an idiot!

39.

MATT

It's about aerodynamics! If I put

a barrier just in front of me, I

can go way faster, cause it cuts

wind resistance!

STEVE (O.S.)

I can't hear a damn thing you're

saying!

MATT

Yeah!   Definitely!

CUT.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Guys, do you hear that?

ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)

What?   I can't hear you!

STEVE

WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA

What the hell, what the hell-

CUT.

STEVE

This is what people have wanted

forever, since like caveman times!

Do you understand, I mean do you-

Everything is fucking great! I CAN

FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!

MATT

STEVE

Shout it out man!

MATT

I CAN FLY!

ANDREW (O.S.)

I CAN FLY!

STEVE

FUCK.   YES.

CUT.

CUT.

MATT

But how does she not notice?

STEVE

Well, I mean, she notices that it's

gotten better, definitely. You

just have to be subtle.

ANDREW (O.S.)

That's so cool. Doesn't that count

as breaking rule #1 though?

STEVE

Pfff, technicalities.

MATT

Man, I haven't had sex since

like...a year.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I haven't had sex since ever.

STEVE

Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so

cool?

MATT

Liquid nitrogen.

CUT.

43.

MATT (CONT'D)

Hey guys, are you up?

STEVE

Yeah.

ANDREW (O.S.)

YO.

MATT

Today was like...the best day of my

life. Like I was thinking and I

can't think of any day I liked

better than today.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah.

STEVE

Unanimous.     Yes.

MATT

Okay...good.

STEVE

Well that answers that.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I feel stupid now that I was scared

to come back.

MATT

Nah man, we were all- I mean, I

was, definitely, yeah.

POLICE OFFICER

Hey, you kids can't be here, okay?

You gotta move on out.

44.

MATT

What?

POLICE OFFICER

The ground is unstable, we're

cordoning the whole place off.

STEVE (O.S.)

I'm live on scene here with Matt

and Andrew, boys, can you tell us

what's happening?

ANDREW

Well, uh, it would appear that a

Virgin Mary has appeared in the

maple syrup on a young local man's

pancake.

MATT

In a second it will, wait...

STEVE (O.S.)

That is, that is some very uh,

definitely supernatural shit, going

on there.

CUT.

MATT

Well, when I was really little, I

wanted to be police officer.

STEVE (O.S.)

Oh, no shit?

ANDREW

Fuck you, pig.

MATT

No, I just really got into on the

idea of altruism, you know?

ANDREW

What's that mean?

45.

MATT

Like making things better for

everyone.

ANDREW

So what, you wanna do like, a

charity? That's lame.

STEVE (O.S.)

Why is that lame?

ANDREW

I dunno.

MATT

I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't

matter, you know. I'm never gonna

get out of this piece of shit town.

You know, we're all just little

pieces. One person can't really

make a difference. I used to think-

I don't know. I don't know.

STEVE

AAH!   DOUCHEBAG!

CUT.

MATT (O.S.)

So what's it feel like to be good

at everything?

STEVE

I'm not good at everything-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Name something you're bad at.

STEVE

I'm not GOOD at everything, I just

do my best at everything. That's

what it's about. I mean you talk

about philosophy and shit all the

time, but you never really do

anything. Have you even applied to

colleges yet?

MATT

I'll get to it-

46.

STEVE

You could use some of that, man,

I'm just saying.

MATT (O.S.)

Oh yeah? Well you could use some

shut the fuck up.

STEVE

You lack initiative.

MATT

You lack...a dick.

MATT

Shit man, I got my mom's birthday,

I gotta go.

ANDREW

Say hi for me.

STEVE

Later dude.

STEVE (CONT'D)

What're you doing, where are you

going now?

ANDREW

Well I don't wanna go home yet.

You wanna go into the city?

STEVE

Ah, dude, it's rush hour.

ANDREW

So?

STEVE

Hell yeah, dude.

47.

STEVE

I wish I could bring Samantha up

here. She'd love this.

ANDREW (O.S.)

You still haven't told her?

STEVE

Nah, no way. She'd freak out.

CUT.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Mom's like, never home anymore. I

mean, you saw how my dad is, he's

just quiet. Sits around. I don't

know. And talking to him about it

is just pointless. He's got

nothing to say.

CUT.

ANDREW (O.S.)

And it's bad, because her pain gets

real bad, you know, and we can't

afford the good meds anymore. When

I was little it wasn't as bad, but

even then dad was still, you know,

the way he is. I don't know. I

don't know anymore. I don't know

how to feel.

CUT.

STEVE

It'll be fine, dude.    You'll figure

it out.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I hope so.

STEVE

Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter

break's coming up...You wanna do

the talent show with me? Get you

out there, you know, meet some new

people.

48.

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm

really shy, and I don't have any

talents, or-

STEVE

Yes you do, you have a talent, you

have a talent.

ANDREW (O.S.)

(getting it)

...Oh, no way. No way-

SANDRA DETMER

You look handsome.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's

gonna do my hair.

SANDRA DETMER

I'm glad you are spending so much

time with your friends.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oh yeah, me too.

CUT.

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

-getting to school?

ANDREW

I don't know what you mean-

MR. DETMER (O.S.)

Don't bullshit me idiot. Matt

doesn't come, he don't drive up.

You leave the house, and who the

fuck is giving you rides to school?

ANDREW

Matt.

49.

MR. DETMER

No, wrong. Something's fucking

going on with you, you can't hide

it. Think you can slink around,

sneaking- sneaking around the

house, smiling, I know your shit.

And we ain't got no more fucking

money for your mother's pain

medication, either.

ANDREW

...I'm sorry, I'll try to-

MR. DETMER

Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up!

You're a fuck up. You fuck

everything up. Put that fucking

camera away-

MATT (O.S.)

(grumbling)

Fuck...the stupid...

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

...s'fuckin awesome...

CUT.

50.

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Yes!   Fuck yes!

CUT.

CUT.

CUT.

MATT

Just amazing dude-

ANDREW (O.S.)

You really think so-

MATT

Are you fucking kidding, I've never

seen a reaction like that in the

auditorium, you guys- it was

fucking like- it shook the

building. You guys are rockstars.

51.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah, it did- it did feel like

that. All the girls screaming-

MATT

Ah, see, here's the first stage of

your downfall, hubris.

ANDREW (O.S.)

What's that?

MATT

What?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What's "hubris?"

MATT

Seriously?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What "seriously," fuck you

seriously!

MATT

(laughing)

I'm sorry, I'm sorry-

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hey Matt.

(beat)

What's "seriously" mean?

SAMANTHA

AAAH ANDREW!

SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

Hi Matt!

MATT

Hi Samantha!

52.

SAMANTHA

Everybody's freaking out, you've

gotta come in here-

CUT.

MONICA

Just fucking amazing. Magic is so

hot. Do you know, me and my mom,

in Vegas, went to a magic show, but

they didn't have anything like

that.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time

practicing-

MONICA

Do you not remember me, at all?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What?

MONICA

We took American History together.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was

different; it was blue, right?

MONICA

Yeah!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Monica, yeah-

MONICA

Yeah!   Hiiii!

CUT.

And now, you get a special treat,

I'm gonna film myself taking a

piss.

CUT.

CUT.

STEVE

Matt, you have the camera yeah?

You have the camera, cause, don't

let him forget the camera, okay?

That's Andrew's camera.

MATT (O.S.)

Right on.

CUT.

STONER

Hey Matt, wanna blaze?

MATT (O.S.)

(beat)

No, I'm good. I'm just filming for

Andrew.

STONER

Andrew? He's upstairs in the

bedroom hooking up with that,

whatshername, hair girl.

MATT (O.S.)

Yeah, I'm a little drunk though.

Movies! Makin movies.

MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I'm making an experimental film.

54.

MATT

Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing

this. Congratulations, sir. I'm

drunk, sorry. I was really worried

about you, like, before everything,

but I do feel like...

(beat)

I feel like this will get better

for you, man. I'm sorry I haven't

been there for you as much, you

know, when we were growing up,

because, I know you could be an

angry...be an angry dude. But I

love you, you know. Detmer-Garrety

extended family for liffffeeeeee.

(beat)

But listen when did I become the

one who's...who's out alone filming

myself, with the camera-

CASEY

Hey Matt.

CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

What were you filming?

MATT (O.S.)

Just a thing, it's nothing like-

you know, Eye Of The Storm or

anything-

CASEY (O.S.)

You watch my blog?

MATT (O.S.)

I- yeah, a lot of people do. I've

actually been stalking you since

like, sophomore year- sorry, use of

the word stalking-

CASEY

Stockings are why I love Christmas.

You wanna get outta here? This

place is too loud for me.

55.

MATT

Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop

off the cam-

BLACK SCREEN.

HOLD ON BLACK.

ANDREW (O.S.)

(faintly)

Mom, it's going to be okay, okay?

Just try to get through, it's going

to be okay.

MR. DETMER

-think you can fucking use me,

you're abusive, you're a fucking

user little piece of shit. I went

through your camera.

ANDREW

What'd you...You- what'd you see?

MR. DETMER

Just you fucking being a drunk

mess, spending my money, drinking

with your fucking friends-

56.

ANDREW

I didn't spend any of your money,

RICHARD-

MR. DETMER

Cause I don't have any fucking

money to spend, it all goes to

school for you, for medication for

your mother-

ANDREW

School doesn't cost any money, I go

to public school you idiot-

MR. DETMER

-now we can't afford your mother's

pain meds anymore, up there

screaming- did you just- what THE

FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME? CALL ME

A FUCKING IDIOT?

ANDREW

(clutching his face)

You asshole, you fucking crazy

asshole-

MR. DETMER

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU'RE DONE

LIVING HERE, GET OUT!

MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

I can't- can't move-

ANDREW                        MR. DETMER

57.

STEVE (O.S.)

HEY!   HEY ASSHOLE!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Where's Matt?

STEVE

We have to get down from here right

now, Andrew! This isn't safe!

ANDREW (O.S.)

Where's Matt?

STEVE

Hung over, dude! You should be

too! Let's just-

ANDREW (O.S.)

No!

STEVE

What the fuck are you doing?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm filming the storm, no one's

ever filmed a storm like this up

close bef-

STEVE

No, we're getting the fuck down,

now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew-

what- what happened to your face?

ANDREW (O.S.)

...My dad-

STEVE

Your dad fucking beat the shit out

you! Come on, we'll go to the

cops, let's get out of here. He

can't do that Andrew.

(MORE)

58.

STEVE (CONT'D)

This is not the way you handle it,

we'll go together, let's go, he

can't do that-

ANDREW (O.S.)

You don't give a shit, stop acting

like you care!

STEVE

I don't fucking care!?    You're my

best friend, idiot!

ANDREW

...What?

STEVE

I hang out with you and Matt

practically every fucking day! You

think I talk to anyone else about

my parents, or my feelings on shit,

are you that fucking insecure?

ANDREW

(long beat)

I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh

god, I'm sorry-

STEVE

Dude, it's okay.     You just need

help, okay?

ANDREW

Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm

doing-

STEVE

It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do

DISTORTION TO

BLACK.

59.

CUT.

MATT (O.S.)

What are you doing? Filming

graves, I don't get it.

MATT (CONT'D)

You're not returning my calls, why

aren't you returning my calls.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I've been busy.

MATT

No you haven't. Why aren't you

returning my calls. Turn off the

camera.

ANDREW (O.S.)

...No.

MATT

Turn off the camera.

MATT (CONT'D)

I had a missed call from you, that

morning. And from Steve. I

listened to your voicemail. No

voicemail from Steve.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I was upset.

60.

MATT

(long beat)

How do you get struck by lightning

during a storm with no recorded

lightning strikes?

(waits, nothing)

You can look that up online, you

know, they keep track of it. I

looked it up. Zero. And they find

him out in a field, why would Steve

go out in the middle of a field

during a lightning storm?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't know-

MATT

What?

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't know-

MATT

No, no, you do know, you do know, I

think you do know.

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't.

MATT

What happened, Andrew. Just stop,

stop lying to me, and tell me-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm not lying, I don't know what

happened-

MATT

I don't believe you, okay! I don't

believe you, I want you to- put the

fucking camera down.

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, why-

MATT

Because I want to talk to you. Put

it down- put it down, Andrew,

please- put it down, turn it off,

put the fucking-

61.

MATT (CONT'D)

(breaking down a little)

What did you do, Andrew? What am I

supposed to do? Who am I supposed

to tell, about this, man? Who do I

tell? I mean- I don't, I don't

know how I'm supposed to- Why won't

you just tell me what happened?

ANDREW

(addressing the camera)

-wanted to show you what I was

talking about.

ANDREW (CONT'D)

See, it's- I put a little sheet

between myself and the knife, and

the barrier, the sheet, is too

strong. The knife can't cut it. I

mean like, what I'm saying is if I

concentrate, I can't be hurt. I

can't be injured. Because of the

little sheet.

62.

ANDREW (O.S.)

Hey Wayne!

WAYNE

What, you got a probl-

ANDREW (O.S.)

See, this one, I got clean, cause I

did a little lasso around the root,

but these two, they're broken cause

I think I pulled them from the

middle. Matt was always better at

the little, the intricate stuff, he

got good at that. See how broken

it is, ugh, sloppy.

FERNANDEZ

Could you put the camera away?

ANDREW (O.S.)

No, I'm filming this. I film

everything.

63.

FERNANDEZ

I understand that things have been

very hard for you recently, Andrew,

but the camera kind of- it

alienates a little, you know?

ANDREW (O.S.)

What did you want to talk about?

FERNANDEZ

(beat)

There's concern for your grades,

Andrew. And as far as I know

you've yet to apply to any

colleges, so-

ANDREW (O.S.)

It's not doable. Financially,

they're not- I mean, my dad didn't

go to college either.

FERNANDEZ

Well, yes, but I still think it's

worth thinking about. There are

three different community colleges

locally that offer great programs

for-

ANDREW (O.S.)

I don't need college, Mr.

Fernandez.

FERNANDEZ

(beat)

I think that's a very close-minded

attitude, Andrew. I know that you

come from a difficult background,

and I know how horrible the pain

can be when you lose a friend. But

I don't think you should let this

make you lose hope. I mean, this

is your future. You don't want to

compromise your future.

(long beat)

Andrew?

64.

SANDRA DETMER

Richard is that you? Richard, you

have to let me have my medicine, I

can't...Andrew? Who is that?

Look, please come in here, I need

help to turn over. It hurts,

please, Andrew, you have to tell

your father...tell your father to

get my medicine...

SANDRA DETMER (CONT'D)

Andrew...thank you Andrew...was

that you? Did you-

CUT.

CUT.

65.

ANDREW

I've been doing a lot of reading,

like you know, online, about

evolution, and the way it works,

and you know, natural selection.

The uh...

(cut)

The strongest animals will always

survive, and they're the ones that

you know, will prosper, or grow,

and survive, by feeding on the

smaller animals. And as humans we-

see, there's...uh-

(cut)

There's this thing called an Apex

Predator, and basically what that

is the most powerful predator in an

ecosystem. And humans, you know,

we're the apex predator, because

there's nothing that preys on us,

cause of weapons and stuff. But if

something could, I bet it would.

I...

(cut)

I mean, what I'm trying to say is,

a lion doesn't feel guilty when it

kills a gazelle. You don't feel

guilty when you squash a fly, you

know- I think that means

something. I think it really means

something.

CUT.

66.

CASEY (O.S.)

AHHHH!

CASEY (O.S.)

How'd the interviews go?

MATT

I told you how the interviews went.

CASEY (O.S.)

But now we do it for the camera.

MATT                         CASEY (O.S.)

MATT

UCONN not so good, Columbia was

good, University of Miami was

really good, Arizona State was

okay.

CASEY (O.S.)

Who ended up paying for all of the

airfare? Did your parents-

MATT

Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't.

CASEY (O.S.)

Did you pay?

MATT

Nope. Nobody. I flew myself.      I

needed the exercise.

CASEY (O.S.)

(beat)

You are a man of mystery.

67.

CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

God, how do you always cook so many

things-

CASEY (CONT'D)

(running away)

AAH! AHH OH MY GOD MATT AAAHHH!

CUT.

CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

You have to do at least one of your

tricks for the camera, though.

MATT

I am so sick of being filmed, you

have no idea, Casey-

CASEY (O.S.)

No I know, but I'm not going to use

any of this. I just want you to do

a trick, one of your good ones.

MATT

When do your parents get back from

Spain?

CASEY

A week.

MATT

(beat)

Okay, if you don't film me for one

week-

CASEY (O.S.)

Ahhhh-

MATT

One week, I'll show you my new

trick. I guarantee you will shit

bricks. Yeah?

CASEY

...Ughhhh.

68.

CASEY (O.S.)

(whispering)

I'm filming you and you don't know.

I'm terrible. I'm gonna show you

this later and you're gonna be like

"whaaaaaaaaaat!"

CASEY (O.S.)

You ready?

MATT

I'm ready!

CASEY (O.S.)

Are you sure-

MATT

Let's do it! Woo!

CASEY (O.S.)

(awed)

Holy shit, Matt.

MATT

COME ON!   BRING IT ON!

CASEY (O.S.)

(laughing, awed)

Matt, oh my god, oh my god!

69.

CASEY (O.S.)

What happened?

MATT

Ughhhh camera...I had that dream

again.

CASEY (O.S.)

Tell me.

MATT

It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm

something else. And I'm out in

this...out in space. And stars are

all around me, and I'm zooming past

them; everything is really like

three-D, I can see the shape of the

stars. I'm looking for somewhere

to sleep, or something, and I see

earth, and I go down to earth. And

then...I don't know, just the main

part is that I'm out and there are

the stars and they just look like

millions of little points of

light...And Steve is there.

CASEY (O.S.)

Steve is there?

MATT

Yeah but he feels like he's not

part of it. Like he's there

separately, inside my head. Andrew

is there too. I don't know. I'm

worried about Andrew.

(beat, slyly)

Why don't you put the camera away?

CASEY (O.S.)

Oh yeah? What's gonna happen to me

if I put the camera away-

MATT

Oh I think you know. I think you

know what's going down.

CASEY (O.S.)

We could leave the camera on.

You arrrrreeee...C'mere.

MATT

You haven't been returning my

calls, so I thought I'd just...you

know, ambush.

ANDREW (O.S.)

That's rude.

I just- I've been getting, you

City officials blame the

malfunctions on the terrorist

bombing that occurred at the dam's

control center last March.-

Botched evacuation has left

thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's

residents trapped, with only one

major roadway leading in or out. A

roadway that has not been repaired

in over ten years- Again, the scale

here is just unprecedented. Our

hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee

tonight.
