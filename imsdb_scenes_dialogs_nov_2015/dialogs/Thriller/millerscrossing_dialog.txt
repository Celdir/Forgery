MILLER'S CROSSING -- by Joel and Ethan Coen

Miller's Crossing

An Original Screenplay By

Joel Coen

and

Ethan Coen

1.   FADE IN:

Man  (off)

I'm talkin' about friendship.  I'm talkin' about

character.  I'm talkin' about--hell, Leo, I ain't

embarassed to use the word--I'm talkin' about

ethics.

. . . You know I'm a sporting man.  I like to

make the occasional bet.  But I ain't

that

sporting.

Caspar (cont'd)

When I fix a fight, say--if I pay a three-to-one

favorite to throw a goddamn fight--I figure I got

a right to expect that fight to go off at three-

to-one.  But every time I lay a bet with this

sonofabitch Bernie Bernheim, before I know it the

odds is even up--or worse, I'm betting the short

money. . .

. . . The sheeny knows I like sure things.  He's

selling the information I fixed the fight.  Out-

of-town money comes pourin' in.  The odds go

straight to hell.  I don't know who he's sellin'

it to, maybe the Los Angeles combine, I don't

know.  The point is, Bernie ain't satisfied with

the honest dollar he can make off the vig.  He

ain't satisfied with the business I do on his

book.  He's sellin' tips on how I bet, and that

means part of the payoff that should be ridin' on

my hip is ridin' on someone else's.  So back we

go to these questions--friendship, character,

ethics.

Caspar

. . . So its clear what I'm sayin'?

Leo

Clear as mud.

Caspar

It's a wrong situation.  It's gettin' so a

businessman can't expect no return from a fixed

fight.  Now if you can't trust a fix, what

can

you trust?  For a good return you gotta go

bettin' on chance, and then you're back with

anarchy.  Right back inna jungle.  On account of

the breakdown of ethics.  That's why ethics is

important.  It's the grease makes us get along,

what separates us from the animals, beasts a

burden, beasts a prey.  Ethics.  Whereas Bernie

Bernheim is a horse of a different color ethics-

wise.  As in, he ain't got any.  He's stealin'

from me plain and simple.

Leo

You sure it's Bernie, selling you out?

Bluepoint

It ain't elves.

Leo

Nobody else knows about the fix?

Caspar

No one that ain't got ethics.

Leo

What about the fighters you pay to tank out?

Bluepoint

We only pick fighters we can put the fear of God

in.

Leo

Any other bookies know?  You play anyone else's

book?

Caspar

I lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie.

Bluepoint

But it ain't Mink, I'll vouch for that.

Leo

How do you know?

Caspar

It ain't Mink.  Mink is Bluepoint's boy.

Leo

Mm.  And of course, Bluepoint always knows about

the fix.

Bluepoint

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

Leo

Let it drift.  All it means is a lot of people

know.

Caspar

I guess you ain't been listening.  Sure other

people know.  That's why we gotta go to this

question of character, determine just who exactly

is chiseling in an my fix.  And that's how we

know it's Bernie Bernheim.  The Motzah Kid.

'Cause ethically, he's kinda shaky.

Leo

You know Bernie's chiseling you because he's a

chiseler.  And you know he's a chiseler because

he's chiseling you.

Caspar

Sometimes you just know.

Leo

. . . So you wanna kill him.

Bluepoint

For starters.

Leo

. . . Sorry, Caspar.  Bernie pays me for protec-

tion.

Caspar

. . . Listen, Leo, I ain't askin, for permission.

I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.  I need to do this

thing, so it's gonna get done.

Leo

Then I'm telling you as a courtesy that you'll

have trouble.  You came here to see if I'd kick

if you killed Bernie.  Well there's your answer.

Caspar

Listen Leo, I pay off to you every month like a

greengrocer--a lot more than the Motzah--and I'm

sick a gettin' the high hat--

Leo

You pay off for protection, just like everyone

else.  Far as I know--and what I don't know in

this town ain't worth knowing--the cops haven't

closed any of your dives and the O.A. hasn't

touched any of your rackets.  You haven't bought

any license to kill bookies and today I ain't

selling any.  Now take your flunky and dangle.

Caspar

Ya know I'm tryin'. . . I'm tryin not to raise my

voice in anga.  I've always gone along to get

along.  But you make me lay off the Matzoh and

you're givin' me the needle.  I told you the

sheeny was robbin' me blind, I told you I wanna

put him in the ground and I'm telling you now I'm

sick a the high hat.

. . . You think I'm some guinea fresh off the

boat and you think you can kick me.  But I'm too

big for that now.

I'm sick-of takin' the strap from you, Leo.  I'm

sick a marchin' down to this goddamn office to

kiss your Irish ass and I'M SICK A THE HIGH HAT!

Caspar

. . . Youse fuckin' fancy-pants, all of ya.

Leo

(softly)

Johnny.  You're exactly as big as I let you be

and no bigger and don't forget it.  Ever.

Caspar

Ats right, Leo, you're the big-shot around here.

. . . And I'm just some schnook likes to get

slapped around.

Leo

Twist a pig's ear.  Watch him squeal.

Tom

. . . Bad play, Leo.

Leo

Got up on the wrong side, huh?

Tom

Same side as always.

Leo

That's what I mean.  Still owe money to--who's

your bookie?  Lazarre?

Tom

Mm.

Leo

I could put it right for you.

Tom

Thanxs Leo, I don't need it.

Leo

In a pig's eye.  You haven't played a winner in

six weeks.  People'll speak ill of me if I let

him break your legs.

Tom

People'll say I had it coming.

Leo

And they'll be right, but that ain't the point.

Call me a big-hearted slob, but I'm gonna square

it for ya.

. . . Yeah, I think I'll do that, this very same

night.  Looking at you moping around takes away

all my . . . What did you call it?  Joy de veever.

Tom

Joi de vivre.

Leo

Well look, if your gonna laugh at me, the hell

with you.

Tom

And with you.  I'll square myself with Lazarre if

you don't mind.  Thats why God invented cards.

. . . There is something you can do for me.

Leo

Name it.

Tom

Think about what protecting Bernie gets us.

Think about what offending Caspar loses us.

Leo

Come on, Tommy, you know I don't like to think.

Tom

Yeah.  Well, think about whether you should start.

2.   FADE IN:

3.   FADE IN:

Voice

Wake up, Tommy.

Tom

I'm awake.

Voice

You're eyes were shut.

Tom

Who're you gonna believe?

Tom

. . . How'd I do?

Voice

What do you think.  You're a millionaire.  You

gonna remember your friends?

Tom

. . . Where's my hat?

Voice

You bet it, ya moron.  Good thing the game broke

up before you bet your shorts.

Tom's Voice

. . . Who left with my hat?

Tony

Verna.  Verna and Mink.

Tom

. . . Who?

Tony

Mink and Verna.

Tom

. . . Thunderclap running tonight?

Tony

Yeah.

Tom

What's she leave at?

Tony

Three-to-one, more'n likely.  Lay off, Tom.  You

shouldn't go deeper in the hole.

Tom

Tell Lazarre I want five hundred on the nose.

Tony

You would have it.

Tom

. . . Somebody hit me?

Tony

Yeah.  Mink hit you.

Tom

. . . Whyzat?

Tony

You asked him to.

4.   CUT TO:

Tom

(still slightly woozy)

Miss me?

Verna

You again.  What now?

Tom

I want my hat.

Verna

. . . Is that all you came for?

Tom

Yeah.  I want my hat.

Verna

I won it.  It's mine.

Tom

What're

you

gonna do with it?

Verna

Drop dead.

Tom

I need a drink.

Verna

Why didn't you say so.

5.   CUT TO:

6.   LIVING ROOM

Leo

'Lo, Tommy.  Sorry about the hour.

Tom

I'll live.  What's the rumpus?

Leo

Can i come in?

Tom

Sure.

. . . Drink?

Leo

I wouldn't mind. . . I tried calling earlier.

Tom

I got home late.

Leo

Well. . . Sorry about the hour.

Tom

Uh-huh.

Leo

. . . Not bad. . .

Tom

Better than the paint we sell at the club.

Leo

That it is. . . That it is. . .

Tom

Thought about cutting Bernie loose?

Leo

Can't do it, Tommy, can't do it. . . That's sort

of why I'm. . . Tommy. . . I don't know where

Verna is.

Tom

Uh-huh.

Leo

I know what you're thinking:  What else is new?

But the situation now, I'm worried. . .

Tom

Verna can take care of herself.  Maybe better

than you can.

Leo

What does that mean?

Tom

Want another?

Leo

No.  What does that mean?

Tom

How far has she got her hooks into you?

Leo

That's a hell of a question.

Tom

It's a grift, Leo.  If she didn't need you to

protect her brother from Johnny Caspar, d'you

think she'd still go with you on slow carriage

rides through the park?  That is the deal, isn't

it?  You keep Bernie under wraps 'till Caspar

cools down?

Leo

Jesus but you're a prickly pear.  What's wrong

with her wanting her brother taken care of?

Tom

Not a thing.  I don't blame

her

.  She sees the

angle--which is you--and she plays it.  She's a

grifter, just like her brother.  They probably

had grifter parents and grifter grandparents and

someday they'll each spawn little grifter kids--

Leo

Stop it, Tommy.  I don't like to hear my friends

run down.  Even by other friends.

Tom

Friendship's got nothing to do with it.

Leo

The hell you say.  You do anything to help your

friends.  Just like you do anything to kick your

enemies.

Tom

Wrong, Leo.  You do things for a reason.

Leo

Okay, Tom, you know the angles--Christ, better

than anybody.  But you're wrong about this.  You

don't know what's in Verna's heart. . .

Tom

Leo, throw her down.  And her brother, too. Dump

her.

Leo

Jesus, Tom. . . Verna's okay. . .

She's a little wild, but she's okay.  I

like her.

Tom

Yeah, you like her.  Like the Kaiser likes

cabbage.  You're dizzy for her.

Leo

What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit

by that bug?

Tom

Leo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking

for her at four in the morning?

Leo

I put a tail on her this afternoon.

Tom

Hah!

Leo

Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around--

just, you know, just to keep her out of trouble.

Tom

And to tell you what trouble she was managing to

whip up herself.

Leo

It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  After that

meeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too

careful.

Tom

Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you that has you

scurrying over here?

Leo

That's just it.  Nothing.  He's disappeared.

Tom

So you've lost your ladyfriend

and

the tail you

put an her.

Leo

I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . .

. . . Help me out, Tom.  I wouldn't know where to

start looking.  You know Rug's crowd, you know

the people Verna runs with.  I'm just worried

now, with things the way they are between me and

Caspar--

Tom

You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's

what I've been trying to tell you.  You can't

trade body blows with him.  He's gotten too

strong.

Leo

I reckon I can still trade body blows with any

man in this town. . .

. . . Except you, Tom.

Tom

And Verna.

Leo

Okay, give me the needle.  I

am

a sap, I deserve

it. . .

. . . Thanks for the drink.  Let me know if you

hear anything. . .

7.   INT  BEDROOM

Woman

(sleepily)

Who was that?

Tom

Leo. . .

. . . He's looking for you.

Verna

Did you tell him I was here?

Tom

No.

Verna

Did you put in a good word for my brother?

Tom

No.

Verna

You said you would.

Tom

. . . I said I'd think about it.

Verna

What

did

you tell him?

Tom

. . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night?

Verna

No.  What did you tell Leo?

Tom

. . . I told him you were a tramp and he should

dump you.

Verna

You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

7.   EXT  ALLEYWAY   EARLY MORNING

9.   FADE IN:

10.  CUT TO:

11.  INT   THE CLUB   NIGHT

Tom

Hello, Beryl--

Check Girl (off)

Ain't you got a conscience?

. . . It's a little voice inside that tells you

when you been a heel!

Tom

Mine's been mum lately--what'd I do?

Beryl

Stood me up is all.  Made me wait an hour and a

half is all?  Or maybe you don't remember sayin'

you'd pick me up after work last night.  I seen

heels in my time, sure, plenty of 'em!  But none

so low as couldn't tell me to my face when they

was sick of me! . . .

. . . You know where you can stick it!

12.  CUT TO:

Mink

'Lo Tom.  What's the rumpus?

Tom

Mink.

Mink

. . . I see you got your hat back.

Tom

Yeah, what of it.

Mink

Not a thing, Tommy.  I got not a thing to say.

Listen, Bernie wants to see you.  It's important.

Tom

Well I'm right here, and I'm not made of glass.

Mink

Yeah, but he's nervous walkin' around in public.

He's a right guy, but he's nervous, Tommy!  He's

very nervous!  Who wouldn't be?!

Tom

Mink--

Mink

The spot he's in, who wouldn't be!  He asked me

to ask you to ask Leo to take care of him.  You

know, put in a good word with Leo.  Leo listens

to you.  Not that Leo wouldn't help the Motzoh

anyway!  A guy like Bernie?  A square gee like

the Motzah!  A straight shooter like him?

Tom

I don't get it, Mink--

Mink

What's to get?!  It's as plain as the nose--

Tom

I thought you were Bluepoint's sycophant.

Mink

Yeah Tom, that's right.  But a guy can have more

than one friend, can't he?  Not that I'd want

Bluepoint to know about it, but a square gee like

the Motzah?  He's a right guy, Tom!  He's a

straight shooter!  I know he's got a mixed

reputation, but for a sheeny he's got a lot a

good qualities!

Tom

Why should I care what happens to Bernie?

Mink

C'mon Tom, you like Bernie dontcha?

Tom

I don't like anybody, Mink, you know that.

Mink

Well, you like his sister.

Tom

What's that supposed to mean?

Mink

Nothing, Tom.  If it ain't my business I got not

a thing to say.

Tom

What's going an between you and Bernie?

Mink

Nothin, Tom!  We're just friends--you know,

amigos?

Tom

You're a fickle boy, Mink.  If Bluepoint found

out you had another "amigo"--well, I don't peg

him for the understanding type.

Mink

Find out!?  How would he find out?!  Damnit Tom,

me and you ain't even been talking!  Jesus Tom,

damnit, Jesus!

13.  INT   LEO'S OFFICE

Leo (off)

'Lo, Tom.  You know O'Gar. . .

Leo

. . . and the mayor.

Tom

I ought to.  I voted for him six times last May.

Levander

And that ain't the record, either.

Leo

Verna turned up.  She's downstairs.

Tom

. . . She say where she'd been?

Leo

No, I uh. . . didn't want to press her.  Hear

about Rug?

Tom

Yeah, R.I.P.

Leo

They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus that's strange.

Why would they do that?

Tom

Maybe it was Injuns.

Leo

Eye-ties, more like it.  Giovanni Casparro.

Tom

So you figure it was Caspar bumped Rug?

Leo

. . . Well it's pretty obvious ain't it?

Tom

Mm. . . So what's the plan?

Leo

Jump on the guinea hard.  With both feet.

. . . Give him the low-down, Dale.

Mayor

Yes, well. . . Leo here has just reminded us that

Mr. Caspar operates several clubs in our city

wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at

games of chance.

O'Gar

And we're sunnosed to stop the party.

Tom

Uh-huh. . .

. . . They don't seem too happy about it, Leo.

O'Gar

Naw, it ain't that, Tom.

Mayor

Jesus, Tom!  We do as we're told!

Tom

Maybe they're right not to like it.  Stirring up

this hornets' nest won't be good for anyone.  And

it'll mean killing.

Leo

Well I'm not thrilled about it either, but I

can't just lay down to Caspar.

Tom

You could do worse.  You might not like it, but

giving up Bernie Bernheim is a pretty small price

to pay for peace.  Business is business and a

war's going to hurt everybody.  Bernie plays with

fire, he's got to deal with the consequences--

even if that means he gets bumped off.

Leo

Sweet Jesus, Tom, that ain't even the point

anymore.  Caspar pooped Rug.  The day I back down

from a fight, Caspar is welcome to the rackets,

this town, and my place at the table.  I didn't

start this thing, but--

Tom

You

did

start it--you and Verna--

Mayor

We can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer.

Leo

Siddown Dale, we're all friends here.

Tom

--and Caspar hasn't broken the rules, Bernie has-

-and you too, by helping him.  And if that isn't

enough, consider that if you make it a war, you

have more to lose than Caspar.

Leo

Okay, but more to beat him with.  Jesus, Tom, the

two of us've faced worse odds.

Tom

But never without reason.  It helps to have one.

. . . Well, it's your call.

. . . My opinion use to count for something

around here, but it's always yours to take or

leave.

Leo

Aw, c'mon Tommy.  Its not like that. . .

. . . Goddamnit.  Goddamn kid is just like a

twist.

14.  CUT TO:

Tom

Gimme a stiff one.

Tony

No small talk, huh?  They shoot vour nag?

Tom

If there's any justice.  Verna around?

Tony

She stepped into the ladies, room.  You got

Lazarre's five hundred?

Tom

He'll have to carry me for a few days.

Tony

He ain't gonna like that.  Couldn't, you get it

from Leo?

Tom

It's not Leo's debt.  I'll pay my own way.

Tony

I admire a man of principle.  Does this go on the

tab?

15.  INT   LADIES' LOUNGE

Tom

Close your eyes, ladies, I'm coming through.

Tom

Who's the warpaint for?

Verna

Go home and dry out.

Tom

You don't need it for Leo, believe me.  He

already thinks you're the original Miss Jesus.

Verna

. . . What the hell's the matter with you?

Tom

What's the matter with you?  Afraid people might

get the right idea?

Verna

Leo's got the right idea.  I like him, he's

honest and he's got a heart.

Tom

Then its true what they say.  Opposites attract.

Verna

Do me a favor and mind your own business.

Tom

This is my business.  Intimidating helpless women is

part of what I do.

Verna

Then find one and intimidate her.

Tom

Leo's upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in

the foot on your account.

Verna

I don't know what you're talking about.

Tom

He's gonna go to the mat for your brother.  And

it's gonna hurt him.

Verna

I don't know Leo's business, but he's a big boy.

Tom

He used to be.

Verna

Look.  What do you want, Tom?  You want me to

pretend I don't care what happens to Bernie?

Well I do.  He's my brother and I don't want him

to get hurt.  If Leo wants to help him out I'll

step out with him, show him a good time in

return.  There's no harm in that.

Tom

There's a name for that kind of business arrange-

ment.

Verna

I'll do what I have to for Bernie and there's no

reason for you to try and queer that.  Regardless

of what you think of me, Bernie's a decent guy.

Tom

A straight shooter, huh?  A square gee?

Verna

Yeah, sneer at him like everyone else.  Just

because he's different.  People think he's a

degenerate.  People think he's scum.  Well he's

not.

Tom

Poor misunderstood Bernie.

Verna

. . . What is this about?  You want me to stop

seeing Leo . . . Why don't you just say so?

Tom

I want you to quit spinning Leo in circles and

pointing him where to go.

Verna

I forgot--that's

your

job, isn't it?

Tom

I'll

do what I have to to protect Leo.  I'm

asking you--politely, for me--to leave him alone.

I don't

have

to ask.  If I told him about our

little dance last night, your pull would dry up

pretty fast.

Verna

So would yours.  I don't like being threatened.

Tom

I don't like being played for a sucker.  That

game might work with Leo but it won't work with

me.

Verna

You think last night was just more campaigning

for my brother?

Tom

I can see the angles. . .

. . . And I know if there was a market for little

old ladies, you'd have Grandma Bernheim first on

line.

Verna

(struggling to get out of his grasp)

You're a pathetic rumhead.

Tom

And I love you, Angel.

Verna.

. . . I suppose you think you've raised hell.

Tom

Sister, when T've raised hell you'll know it.

16.  CUT TO:

Tom

Yeah. . .

. . . I need a couple days. . . Because I don't

have it now. . .

. . . Because I say so. . . What would be good

enough?. . . Well, if it'll make him feel any

better, tell Lazarre he can send someone by to

break my legs.  I won't squawk.

. . . 'Lo, Bernie.

Bernie

'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus?

Tom

C'mon in, make yourself at home.

Bernie

Yeah, you weren't here so I thought I'd do that.

Didn't wanna answer the phone, though.  Figured

it wasn't for me.

Tom

Uh-huh.

Bernie

. . . I get it, get to the point, huh?  Okay.

The point is: I'm a good guy.

Tom

I've heard that from a lot of people today.

Bernie

Good guy, lot of friends--that's the way it

works.  Maybe if you appreciated me a little

more, you wouldn't be making waves with Leo.

It's a bad time to be doing that.  I mean, right

now we're both in a jam.  I hear you're on a bad

streak, short of funds, and I've got that

psychotic guinea mad at me.  Don't ask me why;

I'm just a small-timer trying to get by, like

everyone else.  I need help from my friends.

Like Leo.  And you.

Tom

Leo gets your sister, what're you selling me?

Bernie

C'mon Tom, its not like that at all.  Wasn't

my idea.  She'll sleep with anyone, you know

that.  She's even tried to teach me a thing or

two about bed artistry.  Can you believe that--my

own sister!  Some crackpot idea about saving me

from my friends. . .

She's a sick twist all right.  I guess some

guys like that.

Tom

She speaks highly of you.

Bernie

Yeah, well, you stick by your family.  The point

is, I can help you with your debts if that would

make us friends.  My motto is, a guy can't have

too many.  Big payday Saturday, Tom.  You could

be in on it.

Tom

Another fix?  Which fight?

Bernie

Well that's confidential at the moment.  But it

doesn't have to stay that way.

Tom

How d'you know about it?  Caspar isn't laying any

more bets with you.

Bernie

Mm.

Tom

. . . You must really have Mink jumping through

hoops.

Bernie

Like I say, you can't have too many.

. . . We got a deal?

Tom

. . . I'll think about it.

Bernie

I wouldn't want it any other way.

17.  STREET   DAY

Tom

Cud. . .

. . . My credit still good with you?

. . . Give me a hundred across on Tailor Maid in

the third tonight.

Cud

Lazarre won't like it.

Tom

Try fifty across.

Cud

I'll try.  That'll make another one-fifty you owe

him.

Tom

Only if I lose, Cud.

Cud

Tommy, the way you're goin'--horses got knees?

Tom

I dunno.  Fetlocks.

Cud

Well the way you're goin', if I was a horse I'd

be down on my fetlocks prayin' you don't bet on

me.

Frankie

Drift, small guy.

Cud

Drop dead, ape.

Frankie

C'mon Tom, my boss wants to see you.  He didn't

have time to engrave nothin' formal.

Cud

I'll see you later, Tommy.  I gotta go spit.

18.  INT   ROOM

Caspar

Whaddya mean he's eatin' too much?  Whadduz the

goddamn doctor know?

. . . What you eat for lunch?

Johnny Jr.

A hot dog.

Caspar

Just a hot dog?

Johnny Jr.

A hot dog and mustard.

Caspar

A hot dog with mustard!  A hot dog with mustard!

You hear that, Bluepoint!  The kids as smart as a

whip!  Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks that's funny.

. . . Whadduz the goddamn doctor know!

. . . G'head, which hand is the penny in?

. . . Choose again.

. . . Okay, here ya go.  Take the penny.  Shiny

new penny.

. . . Take the kid.  Wait in the car.  Give'm

a penny, boys.

Frankie

I ain't got a penny, boss.

Caspar

Ah, well, that's a penny ya owe him.  'Lo Tom,

what's the rumpus?  You like kids?

Tom

No.

Caspar

Uh-huh.  Have a seat.  G'ahead.

. . . Well, you're missin' out on a complete

life.  I know, kids, big deal, but still, I'm

tellin' ya.

. . . Anyway. . . Thanks for comin' by.  I just

wrote this check out to your bookmaker, Lazarre.

It's for an even fifteen hundred, which is more

than I hear you owe him but I figure you can

always use some money on the cuff, a high roller

such as yaself whaddya say?

Tom

. . . Thanks.

Caspar

Always the yapper, huh?  Well, you're welcome.

You wanna know why I'm putting you square with

Lazarre?

Tom

Not particularly.

Caspar

Bad feeling.  It ain't a good thing.  It's a

poison, kid.  I want everybody to be friends.  I

do this, you're friends with Lazarre, he's

friends with you, and you're friends with me.

And all you gotta do, show you're a friend, is to

give me Bernie Bernheim.  You know it's the right

thing anyway; I can't keep any discipline if I

can't punish the people I need to punish.  The

Motzah steals from me, I can't have Leo givin'

him a shiny new penny. . .  You find some way to

make Leo understand that.

Tom

So the deal is, I give you the Motzah, smooth it

over with Leo, and you bail me out with Lazarre.

Caspar

Yeah, then we're all friends again: You, me,

Leo, Bluepoint.

Bluepoint

We can maybe have tea sometime.

Caspar

C'mon, Bluepoint.  Friends is a mental state.

Wuddya say, kid?

Tom

. . . I'll think about it.

Caspar

He'll think about it.  Hear that, Bluepoint?

That's terrific.  The kid's a thinker.

Bluepoint

Does he want a pillow for his head?

Caspar

Okay kid, think about it.  It's a mental state.

But make it quick, my family's waitin'.

Tom

I'll think about it and tell you later.

Bluepoint

He needs to think in the thinking room.

Caspar

Kid, if it'll help you think, you should know

that if you don't do this you won't be in any

shape to walk outa here.

Tom

. . . Would that be physically, or just a mental

state?

Caspar

. . . That ain't friendly, kid.  I make you a

nice offer, I get the high hat.

Bluepoint

Too bad for you, smart guy.

Tom

Hold it.

Frankie

. . . Jesus, Tom.

Frankie

Just in the nick of time, huh?

19.  FADE IN:

Cop

No harm done.  Unless your friend broke his foot.

Tom

. . . Wuzzit. . . How long. . . What day is it?

Cop

Friday, 12th of September, 1929.  Same as when

you left us, about ten seconds ago. . .

Second Cop

. . . 'Lo, Tom.  Care to skin a knuckle an your

playmate here?

Tom

No. . . thanks, Delahanty. . .

Second Cop

Well if you change your mind, we'll be inter-

rogatin' for a while. . .

First Cop

What was that party about, anyway?

Tom

We do this every weekend.

Tom

Jesus. . .

. . . What the hell is the matter with you

people?

First Cop

Well, they said make it hurt. . . So we make it

hurt.

22.  EXT   THE BUILDING

Tom

Drink, O'Gar?

O'Gar

I'm an duty.

Tom

To Volstead. . .

. . . Any news on Rug?

O'Gar

Still dead, far as I know.

Tom

Get a slug out of him?

O'Gar

Yeah, a .22.  Listen, Tom, I'm just the chief

around here, so don't bother telling me if you

don't happen to feel like it, but what the hell

is Leo doing?

Tom

Ours is not to reason why, friend.

O'Gar

Balls.  Look at this mess.  Make him listen to

you, Tom.  It ain't right, all this fuss over one

sheeny.  Let Caspar have Bernie--Jesus, what's

one Hebrew more or less?

. . . We're burning our mealticket here.

Tom

Leo'll do what suits him, and you'll do what he

tells you.  Last I heard Leo's still running this

town.

O'Gar

He won't be for long if this keeps up.  It's no

good for anyone--you said as much yourself.

Tom

First off, O'Gar, I can say what I please to Leo

and about him. . .

. . . You can't.  Second, once Leo decides--

that's that.  And if that sticks going down,

there are plenty of other coppers wouldn't mind

being chief, and could swallow it clean.

O'Gar

Jesus, Tom, I was just speculatin' about a

hypothesis.  I know I don't know nothin'.  It's

just a damn mess is all--

. . . a goddamn mess.

23.  HALLWAY

Tom

Thanks, don't mind if I do.

24.  INT   APARTMENT

Verna

Hello, officer, I'd like to report an intruder at

346 West--

Tom

Who's this?. . . 'Lo, Shad, Tom Duchaisne here.

We won't be needing any today. . . That's right,

my mother.  She didn't recognize me.  Lemme talk

to Mulvaney.

. . . Miss me?

Verna

Drop dead.

Tom

. . . 'Lo Sean, tell O'Car to send a car over to

Leo's tonight.  If we're going to be banging away

at Caspar we ought to be ready for him to bang

back. . . Yeah.

Verna

What do you want?

Tom

I was in the neighborhood, feeling a little

daffy.  Thought I'd drop in for an apperitif.

. . . Rug Daniels is dead.

Verna

Gee, that's tough.

Tom

Don't get hysterical.  I've had enough excitement

for one nigit without a dame going all weepy on

me.

Verna

I barely knew the gentleman.

Tom

Rug?  Bit of a shakedown artist.  Not above the

occasional grift, but you'd understand that.  All

in all not a bad guy, if looks, brains and

personality don't count.

Verna

You

better hope they don't.

Tom

. . . Yeah well, we're none of us the saint I

hear your brother is.

Verna

Who killed him?

Tom

Leo thinks Caspar did.

Verna

But you know better.

Tom

I do now.  Caspar just tried to buy me into

settling his tiff with Leo, which held hardly do

if he was waging war.  So I figure you killed

him, Angel.  You or Saint Bernard.

Verna

Why would I--or my brother--kill Rug Daniels or

anybody else?

Tom

Rug was following you.  He knew about you and me.

That wouldn't help your play with Leo, would it?

Verna

You think I murdered someone.  Come on, Tom, you

know me a little.

Tom

Nobody knows anybody--not that well.

Verna

You know or you wouldn't be here.

Tom

Not at all, sugar.  I came to hear your side of

the story--how horrible Rug was, how he goaded

you into it, how he tried to shake you down--

Verna

That's not why you came either.

Tom

Tell me why I came.

Verna

The oldest reason there is.

Tom

There are friendlier places to drink.

Verna

Why can't you admit it?

Tom

Admit what?

Verna

Admit you don't like me seeing Lee because you're

jealous.  Admit it isn't all cool calculation

with you--that you've got a heart--even if it's

small and feeble and you can't remember the last

time you used it.

Tom

If I'd known we were going to cast our feelings

into words I'd have memorized the Song of

Solomon.

Verna

. . . Maybe that's why I like you, Tom.  I've

never met anyone made being a sonofabitch such a

point of pride.

. . . Though one day you'll pay a crice for it.

Tom

Okay, Verna.  But until then, let's get stinko.

Verna

. . . Let's do something else first.

Tom  (off)

Yeah.  Let's do plenty.

Tom

Who's winning?

Terry

We are, for the nonce.

Tom

What's the disposish?

Terry

Last night?  Four to one.  Dana Cudahy went up

with the house.

Tom

And theirs?

Terry

One burned.

Tom

The other three?

Terry

Lead.

Tom

Whose?

Terry

Leo's.

. . . The old man's still an artist with a

thompson.

32.  INT   LEO'S OFFICE

Leo

--well find him, goddamnit!  Go see if he fell in

the john!  And get him, over here!

. . . Sonofabitch!  No chief!  Who's running the

goddamned store?

Tom

Can't raise O'Gar?

Leo

No, nor the mayor either.

Tom

Hmm.

. . . That's not good.  They're running.

Leo

They wouldn't dare.

Tom

I don't know, Leo.  I warned you not to hit

Caspar's club--

Leo

I'm still here, ain't I?

Tom

Caspar's play hurt you anyway.

Leo

Hah!  That sorry sonofabitch just slit his own

throat.  He just made me decide to step on him--

Tom

Listen to me Leo.  Last night made you look

vulnerable.  You don't hold elected office in

this town.  You run it because people think you

run it.  Once they stop thinking it, you stop

running it.

Leo

Jesus, Tom, sounds like a bad break for me I

wasn't killed.

Tom

I mean it, Leo.  Start taking Caspar seriously.

Leo

Don't sing me the blues again, Tommy.  I need

your help.  He shoots, we gotta answer--

Tom

That's what got you in this mess.

Leo

I know, I know.  Retreat to win.  Give up Bernie.

That'll solve all our problems.

Tom

It won't anymore, I'll grant that.  Now its

either you or Caspar.  But going toe-to-toe with

a psychopath'll get you nowhere.  It'll force

everyone to choose sides just when you're looking

shaky.

Leo

The hell I do!

Tom

Then where's the mayor?  Why aren't there any

police here?  Why weren't there police at your

place last night?

Leo

I didn't ask for any.

Tom

I did.

Leo

Mother hen, huh?  What's the matter, Tommy, you

think I can't take care of myself?

Tom

I

know

you can't.  Here's the smart play, Leo:

you lay back, give up Bernie, let Caspar think

he's made his point.  Wait for him to show you a

weakness--

Leo

Please, Tom. . .

Tom

You're sticking on Bernie.  Sticking your neck

out for a guy who'd chop

you

off at the heels if

there was two bits in it.

Leo

. . . Tom, it ain't all as clear-cut as you make

it. . . Bernie's--Well hell, you know about me

and Verna. . . Things now are--not that I haven't

been a gentleman, but. . . I, uh. . . I plan to

ask her to marry me, Tom.

. . . I guess you think that's a bonehead play.

Tom

Do you think she wants you to?

Leo

How the hell do I know, Tom?. . .  I think she

does. . . Yeah, 'course she does.  I know, I

know, you think different but--well, we just

differ on that.

Tom

Leo.

. . . Caspar didn't kill Rug.

Leo

Course he did.

Tom

No.  Think about it.  Just this one time.  Who

was Rug following?

Leo

. . . Huh?

Tom

It needn't have been that sinister.  A strange

man, following her down a dark alley, late at

night. . . I've told you, Leo, she can take care

of herself.

Leo

. . . Tom, why're you saying that?  Christ, Tom.

I just told you, I plan to. . .

Tom

They pulled a .22 slug out of him.  A pop gun,

Leo--a woman's gun.

Leo

. . . That's a whiskey dream.  Verna wouldn't

panic--shoot someone--just because he was

following her.

. . . No. . . It wouldn't have happened that way

in the first place, and if it had she would have

told me. . . I know you don't like her, Tom, but

I trust Verna as much as I trust you.

Tom

On her account you'll burn the town down.

Leo

Don't worry, Tom.  We'll still be standing when

the smoke clears.

Tom

Okay Leo.  Then maybe it wasn't that innocent.

Maybe Rug knew something she didn't like him

knowing, and wouldn't want you to know.  He was

following her.  He knew who she was seeing.  He

knew where she was sleeping, and who with. . .

Leo

Maybes don't make it so.

Tom

They're more than maybes.  You've trusted me

before, and never lost anything by it.  Trust me

on this.

Leo

This is too important.

Tom

I don't ask much, and I don't ask often.  Trist

me on this.

Leo

Tommy--

Tom

Trust me on this or the hell with you.

Leo

You don't mean that.

Tom

. . . She was at my place.  The night Rug was

following her; the night you dropped by.

33.  HALLWAY

34.  This blow sends Tom rolling down the staircase, still

Tony

Okay, Leo.  I'll throw him out.

Leo

. . . Yeah.  Do that. . . It's the kiss-off.  If

I never see him again it'll be soon enough.

35.  CUT TO:

Tom

. . .'Lo Frankie its Tom, how's the flunky

business?. . . I've had worse; your ventilator

healing up?

. . . Tell Caspar its already forgotten.  I'd

like to see him. . .

. . . All right, do what you have to do and let

me know.

Verna

. . . It worked, whatever you did; Leo told me

we're quits.  But you know I didn't have anything

to do with Rug.

Tom

Maybe not. . . Anyway, that isn't what soured him

on you.

Verna

Oh, you and me, huh?  You always take the long

way around to get what you want, don't you Tom.

. . . You could have just asked.

Tom

. . . What did I want?

Verna

Me.

36.  FADE IN:

Tom

Yeah?

. . . Yeah yeah, when?. . . Okay.

Verna

. . . You're still up?

Tom

Yeah.

Verna

. . . What're you chewing over?

Tom

. . . Remembering something. . .

Verna

What was it?

Tom

Just a dream.  I was walking in the woods, don't

know why. . . The wind came up and blew my hat

off. . .

Verna

And you chased it, right?  You ran and ran and

finally you caught up to it and picked it up but

it wasn't a hat anymore.  It had changed into

something else--something wonderful.

Tom

No. It stayed a hat.  And no I didn't chase it.

I watched it blow away. . .

. . . Nothing more foolish than a man chasing his

hat.

Verna

Where're you going?

Tom

Out.

Verna

. . . Don't let on more than you have to.

Tom

Just have to do a few things.

Verna

You and Leo might still be able to patch

things up.

Tom

Me and Leo are finished.  Nothing's going to

change that.

Verna

You never know.  He's got a big heart.

Tom

We're quits--as far as I'm concerned, never mind

him.  And if Leo

did

want me back he's an even

bigger sap than I thought.

Verna

. . . Then why don't we just pick up and leave

town?  There's nothing keeping you here.  I know

there's nothing keeping me.

Tom

What about Bernie?

Verna

He could come with us.

Tom

You, me and Bernie.  Where would we go, Verna?

Niagara Falls?

Verna

Why do you hate him?

Tom

I don't hate anyone.

Verna

Or like anyone.

Tom

Whatever.  Where

is

Bernie?

Verna

Why?

Tom

Leo can't protect him anymore.  I ought to tell

him to skip.

Verna

The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.

. . . I guess we both double-crossed Leo, there's

no getting around that.  I guess he's well rid of

both of us.

Tom

Mm.

Verna

The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve

each other.

Tom

Are we?

Verna

We're a couple of heels, Tom.  Yes we are.

37.  PULLING TOM

Caspar (off)

'Lo, Kid.  You know O'Gar. . .

Caspar

. . . and the mayor.

Tom

'Lo, boys.

Mayor

Tom's a big booster.  Always has been.

Caspar

S'fine, s'fine.  Well, Tom and me's got the

proverbial fat to chew--

Mayor

Well, let us know if you need anything. . .

Caspar

Yeah, happy days.  Have a seat, kid. . .

. . . So you had enough time to think about it?

Tom

Yeah, well, circumstances have changed.

Caspar

Don't I know it.  Last night, I know Bluepoint

was disappointed the bulls showed up before

Frankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears

back, but I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a

feeling about this kid.  Take the long view.  The

kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o.  If the kid ain't

ready yet, well, he soon will be.  Matter of

time.  I said, the kid's too smart for Leo.

That's what I said.  Like a psychic.  Ask

Bluepoint if I didn't.  Like a goddamn psychic.

G'ahead.  Ask him.

Tom

You vouch for this psychic business?

Bluepoint

That's right, smart guy.

Caspar

I know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb

idea.  I know you been wise to all of Leo's dumb

ideas lately.  Only a matter of time.  Bust-o.

. . . That's why last night we didn't put the arm

on you.  Only Leo.

Tom

Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo, I can

be only so grateful.

Bluepoint

That's brave, coming from Little Miss Punching

Bag.

Caspar

C'mon Bluepoint.  Friends now, huh?

Bluepoint

Nuts.

Caspar

So we get a little jingle.  And I figure you know

Leo's on his way out.  It's only a matter of time

before we get him.  Am I right, kid?

Tom

Maybe.

Caspar

What maybe.  You know or you wouldn't be bust-o.

So I guess you're looking for a job?

Tom

I might be.

Caspar

You got references?  You been to college, kid?

We only take yeggs what's been to college.  Ain't

that right, Bluepoint?

. . . I'm jokin', of course.  We all know you can

be useful to us, a smart kid such as yaself, the

man who walks behind the man and whispers in his

ear.  I guess you could be useful, in spades.

Tom

Yeah.  I can do plenty for you.  But the fact is

that right now Leo's still got all his vital

signs and once he hears about this he'll be more

anxious to get to me than to either of you.

Caspar

I'm tellin' ya not to worry about Leo.  We got

plans for him.

Tom

Yeah?  What?

Bluepoint

Not so fast there, Kaputnik.

Caspar

. . . I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say

is, there'll be time to talk about that.  That

can be tabled for a later date.  See, the last

time we jawed you gave-me the high hat.  So I

guess I'm sayin', maybe we want your confidence

before we give you ours.  You gotta put somethin'

on the table.  Ante up.

Tom

Fair enough.  Where shall we start.

Caspar

Hear that, Bluepoint?  All business!  I told you

he was a good kid!  Where shall we start!  All

business!. . .

. . . Well, we could start for instance with the

Motzah. . . Like where's the Motzah?  You could

maybe tell us that. . .

Tom

The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.  You might find

Mink with him.

Bluepoint

The hell you say.

Tom

Sure, Bernie and Mink are as cozy as lice.

. . . And it ain't just business.

Bluepoint

This guy's lying.

Tom

Why would I?

Bluepoint

This guy's wrong.  This guy's all wrong.  Mink is

clean and this clown is a smart guy.

Caspar

Easy enough to find out, ain't it?  You find

Mink, bring him back here.

. . . You go down to the car.  I'll send Frankie

and Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.  If Bernie's

there, Frankie and Tic-Tac'll take care of him.

Bluepoint

And if he's not there?

Tom

I'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat.

38.  CUT TO:

Bernie

Frankie, let me go, I'm prayin' to ya, Jesus God-

-Tom!  Jesus!

Bernie

. . . Are you part of this?!  You can't be part

of this!  I think these guys're gonna whack me!

You gotta talk to 'em, Tommy!

Frankie

You gimme a headache, you little sheeny.

To Tom:

Tic-Tac

Okay, we're going to Miller's Crossing.

Frankie

. . . Lets go!

Bernie

You're not part of this!  Tom!  Help me!  These

guys are gonna whack me!

Tic-Tac

Whack you inna mouth you don't shut up.

39.  MILLER'S CROSSING   WIDE

Tic-Tac

I don't want you runnin' anywhere.

Tic-Tac

Okay.  Take him in the woods and whack him.

Tom

Huh?  I don't. . .

Tic-Tac

Yeah, that's right, the boss wants you to do it.

Make sure you're with the good guys.

Tic-Tac

You know how to do this, right?  You gotta

remember to put one in his brain.  Your first

shot puts him down, then you put one in his

brain.  Then he's dead, then we go home.

Frankie

Get up.

Bernie

I can't get up!  I can't get up!

Frankie

Get up and walk, you chiselin' little yid.

40.  TRACK

Bernie

. . . Tommy, you can't do this.  You don't bump

guys.  You're not like those animals back there.

. .

. . . It's not right, Tom.  They can't make us do

this.  It's a wrong situation.  They can't make

us different people than we are.  We're not

muscle, Tom.  I never killed anybody.  I used a

little information for a chisel, that's all.  I

couldn't help it, Tom, it's my nature.  Somebody

hands me an angle, I play it.  I don't deserve to

die for that!  D'you think I do?  I'm just a

grifter!  Huh, Tom?

. . . But I'll tell you what, I never crossed a

friend.  Huh, Tom?  Never killed anybody, never

crossed a friend.  Nor you, I'll bet.  We're not

like those animals.  You can't

do

this!  You're

not like those animals.  This is not us!  This is

some hop dream!

. . . It's a dream!  Tommy!  I'm praying to you!

I can't die!  I

can't

die!  Out here in the

woods!  Like a dumb animal!  I can't die!

. . . You can't kill me.  I'm praying to you!

look in your heart!  I'm praying to you!  Look in

your heart!

. . . I'm praying to you!  Look in your heart!

. . . Look in your heart!  Look in your--

Bernie

. . . Tommy.

Tom

Shutup.  You're dead, get me?

Bernie

I understand.  I'm dead.  God bless you--

Tom

Shutup.  You have to disappear.  You have to

blow, for good.  Nobody can see you, nobody can

know.

Bernie

God bless you--

Tom

Go somewhere no one knows you.  Anyone sees you,

you really are dead, I don't care, you're not my

problem any more.

Bernie

Of course not.  Of course not.  You've done your

share.  Thank you.  Don't worry, I understand.

Thank you--

Tom

Shutup. Just get the hell out, before I change

my mind.

41.  WIDE   THE ROAD

Frankie

Put one in his brain?

Tom

. . . Yeah.

Frankie

Attaboy.

42.  FADE IN

Tom

Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where've you been?. . .

. . . Well you're lucky, Bluepoint's been looking

for you.  Bernie's dead--Stop wailing and listen

to me.  Caspar knows you were in on selling out

his fix. . . I guess

I

gave him that idea.  Sorry

Mink, we were chatting and it just slipped out.--

Shutup and let me talk.  You've gotta make

yourself missing, but let me know where you hole

up.  You're gonna say some things for me. . .

Some stories.  About Bluepoint, to Caspar--don't

worry, I'll let you know.  For now just dis-

appear. . . Yeah, I got you into it.  Just

remember, Mink, I'm the only one who can get you

out.

Tom

'Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote?

Terry

Message from Leo.  Leo says, if you're smart

you'll sit this one out--not that he cares one

way or the other.  Leo says if you're on the

wrong side you take your chances, like anyone

else.  Leo says he gives no special favors.

That's all.

Tom

Mm. . .

. . . Tell Leo he's not God on the throne, he's

just a cheap mick political boss with no brains

and an office that looks like a French whore-

house.

Terry

One more thing. . .

Tom

Leo say that too. . . ?

Terry

No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next time I'll

say plenty.

Caspar

When you're right you're right, but you never say

I told you so.

43.  FADE IN

Tom

So what'm I right about?

Caspar

Well, I'll tell ya, but first you gotta promise

not to say I told you so.

Tom

I never say that.  And I don't like people who

do.

Caspar

Mink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah.

Tom

. . . What convinced you of that?

Caspar

Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't find him.

Bluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal-

ly, I think you were right.  I think Mink and

Bernie was in it together.  I think Mink heard

you'd bumped the Motzah, and lit out.  The lousy

sonofabitch.

Tom

. . . I told you so.

Caspar

Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all right.  I

don't generally care for it, but that's all

right. . . You were a good sport to bump the

Motzah.  I just like to make sure my friends is

my friends.  So.

. . . Friends, right?

Tom

How d'you know Mink skipped?

Caspar

Bluepoint can't find him.

Tom

So he says.

Caspar

Meanin' what, exactly?

Tom

Maybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought

until now, since a guy will say pretty much

anything when he knows his number is up, but just

before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that

Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up.  That

they were the ones that were selling out your

fix.

Caspar

'Zat so. . .

. . . Like you say, a guy'll say anything.

Tom

. . . Uh-huh.  So why isn't Bluepoint here?

Caspar

Well. . .

. . . He don't care for you, kid.  Maybe it's

only fair to tell you. . .  After you left us, he

tried to sell me on a double-cross.  He says to

me, why don't we double-cross you and give you

the bump once we get the Motzah.  But I figure a

deals a deal, you're square with me, you bump the

Motzah, I'll hold up my end.  Question of ethics.

Everything above board, that's how I like it, so

everybody knows who's a friend and who's an

enemy. . .  But Bluepoint wouldn't cross

me

.  We

go back.

Tom

Uh-huh. . . Course, there's always that wild card

when love is involved. . .

Caspar

. . . I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still

don't make it that way.

Tom

Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to worry about.

Caspar

Yeah. . .

Johnny Jr.

Poppa!  Poppa!  I got a prize from the--

Caspar

Just a minute.

. . . Course, there's no reason not to be

careful--

Johnny Jr.

Poppa!  Poppa!  The sisters gave me a--unnnh!

Caspar

Shaddap!  You take a page outta this guy's book.

A little less you talk and a little more you

think!

. . . Kids.  Ya gotta be firm.  Anyways.  You

know what I'm sayin'.  No reason to worry but no

reason not to investigate, neither.  If Mink is

around I want you to find him.  He can tell us

what's what. . .

(to Johnny Jr.:)

. . . What's a matter, somebody hit you, what's a

matter, we ain't friends anymore?. . .

. . . If you find him, I wanna talk to him alone.

That's how you get the straight dope.  Man-to-

man.  Just me, Mink. . .

. . . and my friend roscoe.  Y'understand what

I'm sayin'?

Tom

. . . It ain't complicated.

44.  CUT TO:

Tom

You should leave town for a few days; things are

going to heat up here.  Go out to the Pallisades;

I'll join you once I'm done.

Verna

. . . I can't find Bernie.  Did you find him?

Tom

. . . Yeah.

Verna

Is he leaving?

Tom

He left.

Verna

Where to?

Tom

. . . He didn't say.  You should--

Verna

Thanks.

What's he up to?

I dunno.

Bluepoint

That's Bernie's sister, isn't it?

Voice

I dunno.

Bluepoint

What's he seeing her for?

I dunno, maybe he's--

Bluepoint

Shutup.  Get outta the car.  Stick with the

bighead.

46.  CUT TO:

Voice (off)

C'mon, get up.  I just wanna talk.

Another Voice (off)

Yeah, get up.  He ain't gonna hurt ya.

Round Man

He already hurt me!  He broke my goddamn nose!

Whisper

So what?  I had my nose broke once.

Round Man

I already paid Leo's men.

Bert

You still pay Leo for protection?  Is he protec-

tin' you?

Whisper

We's protectin' you.  Johnny Caspar's runnin'

things or maybe you ain't heard.

Tom

So Bluepoint hasn't got a line on Leo yet?

Bert

Not that I know about.  He's been lookin', but I

guess Leo's been movin' around and--hoist this

over the bar, will ya?--and thingslve been kinda

hectic.

Tom

Do me a favor--let me know if he finds anything.

Bert

Yeah, okay--

Whisper

I'm gonna put this one to sleep, wuddya think

Bert?

Bert

Yeah, okay.

Tom

If you kill him he won't be able to think things

over.

Whisper

He don't seem like such a hot thinker.

Tom

You'll think about what you've learned here,

won't you Louie?

Round Man

You bet, Tom, I'll think plenty!

Bert

Ah, what the hell. . .

Bert

. . . If we can't trust a dago, the whole thing's

hopeless anyway.

47.  EXT   SPEAKEASY

Tom

So, are we winning?

Bert

It's tough.  Leo's still got some teeth left.

His men bushwhacked Tony Campisi last night, slit

his throat.

Whisper

Yeah?  He die?

Bert

I said, they slit his throat.

Whisper

So what, genius?  I had my t'roat slit once.

Tom

Sure Whisper, but normal people's brains need

oxygen--

Bert

Get the car, will ya Whisper?

Tom

Don't tell Bluepoint I was asking about him.

Bert

Yeah yeah.

Tom

Caspar just wanted me to check up, make sure he's

doing everything he can--

Bert

Leo's man!  Up there!

Bert

. . . Up there!  Leo's--

Sergeant

'Lo, Tom.  Chalk one up for the good guys, huh?

Tom

Yeah, Caspar'll be thrilled.  You just shot one

of his apes.

Sergeant

Bullshit!

Sergeant (off)

I'm tellin' you that's Two-Toe Jackson!  He's

Leo's!

Tom

It's Bert Sachetti, Caspar's bang-man.

Sergeant

Bullshit!  Take his shoes off.  Count his goddamn

toes!

48.  INT   DINER

Tom

'Lo, Terry.  You weren't aiming at me, were you?

Terry

In the first place, I don't know what you're

talking about.  In the second place, if I

had

been aiming at you I'd've hit you.  In the third

place, I don't know what you're talking about in

the first place.

. . . I'd like to have, believe me.  Leo won't

let me--yet.  But I'll bring him around.

. . . I won't give you the satisfaction.

49.  CUT TO:

Bluepoint

Know who I am?

Verna

Yeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow.  Did he stay in bed

today?

Bluepoint

Jesus.  I open my mouth, the whole world turns

smart. . .

. . . What business d'you have with Tom Duchaisne?

Verna

None.

Bluepoint

You're Leo's twist, right?

Verna

Me and Leo are through.

Bluepoint

Yeah?  So you're sluttin' around with Tom now,

huh?

Verna

Get outta here.

Bluepoint

Okay, see ya later. . .

. . . Before I go, what's your boyfriend up to?

Verna

Nothing I know about.

Bluepoint

Yeah?  It doesn't figure for me, your dumping

Leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother.

. . . Didn't tell you, huh?

Man In Hall

. . . Let her go, Bluepoint, there's nothing you

can do.  Leave by the fire escape.  There's more

of us on the way--

Bluepoint

. . . You Leo's?

Man

Yeah.  He wanted her looked out for.

Bluepoint

Well you did a bang-up job; I'll be sure to tell

him.  Where

is

Leo?

Man

. . . If I tell you, how do know you won't kill

me?

Bluepoint

Because if you told me, and I killed you, and you

were lying, then I wouldn't get to kill you then.

Where's Leo?

Man

. . . He's--he's moving around.  But tomorrow

night he's getting his mob together at Whiskey

Nick's.

Bluepoint

You sure?

Man

Check it.  It's gold.

Bluepeint

You know something, yegg?  I believe you.

Bluepoint

Go ahead and run, sweetie . . .

Bluepoint

. . . I'll track down all a you whores.

51.  HIS POV

Tom

'Lo, Bernie.  Come on in, make yourself at home.

Bernie

'Lo, Tom.  Thought I'd do that, since you didn't

seem to be in.  Figured it was a bad idea to wait

in the hall, seeing as I'm supposed to be dead.

Tom

Mm.

Bernie

How'd you know it was me?

Tom

You're the only person I know'd knock and break

in.

Bernie

Your other friends wouldn't break in, huh?

Tom

My other friends wanna kill me, so they wouldn't

knock.

. . . What's on your mind, Bernie?

Bernie

Things. . . I guess you must be kind of angry.

I'm supposed to be gone, far away.  I guess it

seems sort of irresponsible, my being here. . .

. . . And I was

gonna

leave.  Honest I was.  But

then I started thinking.  If I stuck around, that

would not be good for you.  And then I started

thinking that. . .

that

might not be bad for me.

. . . I guess you didn't see the play you gave

me.  I mean what'm I gonna do?  If I leave, I got

nothing--no money, no friends, nothing.  If I

stay, I got you.  Anyone finds out I'm alive--

you're dead, so. . . I got you, Tommy.

. . . What's the matter, you got nothin' to crack

wise about?  Bernie ain't so funny anymore?

. . . I guess I made kinda a fool a myself out

there. . . I was shittin' myself, Tommy. . .

you didn't tell anyone about that.

Tom

No.

Bernie

'Course

you

know about it. . . its . . . It's a

painful memory.  And I can't help remembering

that you put the finger on me, and you took me

out there to whack me. . . I know you didn't. .

. I know you didn't shoot me. . . but. . . but--

Tom

But what have I done for you lately?

Bernie

Don't smart me.

. . . See, I wanna watch you squirm.  I wanna see

you sweat a little.  And when you smart me, it

ruins it.

. . . There's one other thing I want.  I wanna

see Johnny Caspar cold and stiff.  That's what

you'll do for your friend Bernie. . .

. . . In the meantime I'll stay outa sight.  But

if Caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days I start

eating in restaurants.

Tony

We're managing to squeak by without you.  Got

Lazarre's money?

Tom

No.

Tony

Well, you're not supposed to be here since you

turned rat.

Tom

Relax, Tony, Leo's not around, is he?

Tony

Maybe Leo's not the only one doesn't care for you

here.

Tom

. . . Fickle, huh Tony?  You could almost be a

dame.

Tony

Pal, you read my mind, you sneak my thoughts.

Jesus, I hope you know what you're doing.

Tom

No more than usual.  The last couple days, you

booked any heavy bets on a long shot at Satur-

day's fights?

Tony

Why the hell should I tell you?

Tom

The truth is Tony, there's no reason on earth.

Tony

. . . Saturday's fights.  Yeah.  Drop Johnson

parked two yards on one yesterday.  On Sailor

Reese, an undercard bum.

Tom

Drop Johnson?  He play your book much?

Tony

You kidding?  I didn't even know he could count.

Tony

Oh Jesus. . . You bring them with you?

Tom

No.

Tom

'Lo, Brian.  Still fighting the good fight?

'Lo, O'Gar.  You don't look happy.

O'Gar

Look at this mess.  Gutting the golden calf

again.

. . . I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

Tom

Yeah, it's awful confusing.  You know a yegg

named Drop Johnson?

O'Gar

We've spanked him a couple times.

Tom

Where does he flop?

O'Gar

The Terminal Hotel on Bay Street, whenever he's

broke--which is one hundred percent of always.

Jesus . . .

. . . Don't nobody ask me, since I'm only the

chief around here, but I'll tell you my opinion:

Caspar's just as crazy as Leo.  And an eye-tie

into the bargain.

Tom

What's the matter, O'Gar, doesn't anything ever

suit you?

Old war wound.  Acts up around morons.

Bluepoint

Very smart.  What were you doing at the club?

Talking things over with Leo?

Tom

Don't think so hard, Bluepoint, you might sprain

something.

Bluepoint

You're so goddamn smart.  Except you ain't.  I

get you, smart guy, I know what you are.

Straight as a corkscrew.  Mr. Inside-Outsky.

Like a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders

from Yegg Central.  You think you're so goddamn

smart.

You joined up with Caspar.  You bumped Bernie

Bernheim.  Down is up.  Black is white.  Well I

think you're half-smart.  I think you were

straight with your frail and queer with Johnny

Caspar.  And I think you'd sooner join the

Ladies' League then gun a guy down.

. . . Then I hear that these two geniuses never

even saw this rub-out take place.

Tic-Tac

The boss just said have him do it, he didn't say

nothing about--

Bluepoint

Shutup, or maybe you still got too many teeth.

Hey Tic-Tac, ever notice how the snappy dialogue

dries up once a guy starts soiling his union

suit?

Uh-oh, hankie time!

he was shown across?

Drop

No.

Tom

. . . Seen him since?

Tom

One last question, Drop.  I hear you've got a lot

of money on tomorrow's fight.  Is that your bet,

or did you place it for a friend?

Drop

No, uh. . . it's my bet.  I just. . . I have a

good feeling about that fight. . .

Tom

A good feeling, huh.  When did the feeling return

to your head?

Drop

. . . Huh?

Tom

You've outgrown that one.  Must be all the

I can't do it, Johnny!  I'll look ridiculous!

For a mayor, you don't hear so hot!  I said

head

!

Head of the assessor's office!

Mayor

But there's two of 'em!

Caspar

I can count!  Co-heads!

Mayor

Johnny, needless to say, this office will do

anything in its power to assist you and your

cousins.  We did it for Leo, of course, on

countless occasions--

Caspar

Damn right--had every potato eater from County

Cork an the public tit--

Mayor

But there's a way we do things, hallowed by usage

and consecrated by time!  When we put people on

the pad, when Leo was running things, we--

Caspar

Leo ain't running things!  I ain't innarested in

ancient history!  I'm running things now!

Mayor

Johnny, no one appreciates that more than I!  I

can give them jobs!  I can give them

good

jobs!

I can even give them jobs where thev won't have

to perform any work, where their lack of English

will be no impediment!  But I cant--

Caspar

What is this, the high hat?!

Mayor

Tom, can you explain it to him?  I can put them

in public works but I can't--

Tom

You can do whatever the hell Caspar tells you.  I

don't remember all this double-talk when Leo gave

you an order.

Mayor

Tom!  Jesus!

Tom

Stop whimpering and do as you're told.

Caspar

You can start by gettin' outta here.

Mayor

But Johnny, it's my office!

Caspar

Get outta here!  Take it on the heel and toe,

before I whack you one!. . .

. . . You too, beat it!

Yeah, go keep the mayor company.  I'll take care

of ya's later.

. . . Runnin' things.  It ain't all gravy.

Tom

What's the fireworks?

Caspar

Knockin' over one of Leo's clubs.  Sonofabitch

just won't go belly-up. . . I'm sorry, kid.  I

heard about your little ride this morning.

Tom

Yeah, well sorry don't fix things.  We could just

as easily've missed Bernie's corpse as stumbled

over it, and I'd be dead now.

Caspar

I know, I know.  But it don't mean Bluepoint's up

to anything.  So he heard some rumor Bernie ain't

dead, those stories pop up, people seen Dillinger

in eight states last week.  So he hears a story,

and he don't like you much anyway, so he decides

to check it out--

Tom

Any stories about Bernie being alive, Bluepoint's

made up himself.

Caspar

Aw, you don't know that.  It don't even make

sense--why would he?

Tom

. . . There could be a damn good reason. . .

. . . If you've got a fixed fight coming up.  Do

you?

Caspar

. . . Maybe.  Okay, yeah, sure.  Tomorrow night,

the fix is in.  What of it?

Tom

Bluepoint knows about it?

Caspar

Yeah. . .

. . . Okay, I get it.

Tom

If Bluepoint's been selling you out on these

fights, and means to again, he'll have to be able

to point the finger at someone else--

Caspar

Yeah, yeah, I get it.

Tom

--but with Bernie dead there ain't a hell of a

lot of people he can point to.

Caspar

Yeah.  Bluepoint sells me out.  Makes pretend

Bernie's still doin' it.  Ats real pretty.

Bernie leaked the fix, and you take the fall for

supposedly not killing him. . . .

. . . But I dunno, why would Bluepoint cross me

like that?  Money, okay, everybody likes money.

But somehow it don't seem like him.  And I know

the Bluepoint.

Tom

Nobody knows anybody.  Not that well.

Caspar

Money don't mean that much to him.

Tom

Then it's not just money he's after.  He's got a

wart on his fanny.

Caspar

. . . Huh?

Tom

A wart.  On his fanny.  Giving him the fidgets.

Maybe he's sick of sitting on the couch and maybe

behind your desk don't look like a bad place to

move to.  Maybe he figures the money can help

move him there.

Caspar

. . . Kid, you got a lip on ya.

. . . I don't generally care for it.  But you're

honest, and that's something we can't get enough

of in this business. . . I'll admit, since last

we jawed, my stomach's been seazin' up on me.

Bluepoint saying we should double-cross you; you

double-cross once, where's it all end?  An

innaresting ethical question.  I'll find Blue-

point, talk to him, straighten it out--

Tom

Sure, talk to him.  Have a chat.  Ask him whether

he's selling you out.  Don't take care of him

before he makes his next move, just sit back and

let him make it.  You're swimmin' in it.

. . . Johnny, my chin's hanging out right along

side yours.

Caspar

Yeah.

Tom

. . . I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were

worrying enough.

Caspar

. . . But I am, kid. . . Christ. . . running

things. . .

68.  CUT TO:

Tom

Yeah?

Voice

I got your message.

Tom

'Lo, Bernie, I had a dream about you the other

day.

Bernie

. . . Yeah?  A nightmare?

Tom

On the contrary; very sweet.  I dreamt you were

lying out at Miller's Crossing with your face

blown off.

Bernie

. . . You get a kick out of that?

Tom

I was in stitches.  It's Mink, isn't it?

Bernie

I came back and he wasn't happy to see me.  Can

you beat that, Tom?  All he could taik about was

how he had to skip, and how much trouble he'd be

in if anyone found me at his place.

Tom

Some friend.

Bernie

Yeah.  And you know what a nervous boy he was.  I

figured, hell, you're a friend.  Maybe you could

use some insurance.

Tom

That's you to the gills, Bernie: thoughtful.  You

didn't happen to keep his gun, did you?

. . . Didn't Mink have a .22?

Bernie

Held already ditched it.  Why?

Tom

. . . After Rug?

Bernie

Yeah. . . How did you know?

Tom

Doesn't matter.  Listen, Bernie, I've been

thinking about our little deal and I've decided

you can stick it in your ear.

Bernie

. . . Huh?

Tom

I figure you don't have anything on me that I

don't have on you.  As a matter of fact, less,

since I've decided to leave town. So I'm calling

your bluff.

Bernie

Wait a minute--

Tom

Shutup and let me talk.  I'm pulling out of here,

tomorrow morning.  The only thing for you to

decide is whether or not I leave behind a message

for Caspar that you're still around.  If you want

me to keep my mouth shut, it'll cost you some

dough.

Bernie

You can't--

Tom

I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable.  So I

want two thousand.

Bernie

In a pig's eye--

Tom

This isn't a debate, it's instructions.  I'm

going out for a while; I'll be back here at four

this morning.  Bring me the money.  If you're not

at my place, four o'clock, with the dough,

Caspar'll be looking for you tomorrow.

Tom

I got news.

Caspar

Yeah, news at this end too.  My stomach's been

seazin' up on me.

Tom

Mink just told me that he--

Caspar

You talked to Mink?!

Tom

Yeah, on the phone.  Bluepoint wants you to think

he's dissappeared, so you can't talk to him, but

he's been right here in town.

Caspar

You're sure it was Mink?

Tom

See for yourself; he's coming to my place, four

o'clock this morning.

. . . He's afraid of a cross from Bluepoint.  He

told me about the fix.  Says he'll sing for a

couple grand skip money, tell us everyone

involved. . .

71.  Caspar opens one of the double doors, and we continue

. . . But you better take care of Bluepoint right

away.  Mink says if he comes after us its going

to be tonight.

Caspar

Leo's holed up at Whiskey Nick's dump.

Tom

. . . How d'you know?

Bluepoint

That ain't all we know, smart guy.

. . . Recognize your playmate?

. . . Yeah.  You thought I'd quit.

Huh-uh.  I followed you this afternoon.  And I

wondered why Einstein would want to talk to a

gorilla. . .

. . . So I grabbed the gorilla. . . And I beat it

out of him.

. . . Give me a big guy, every time.  They crack

easy.  Not like you.

Tom

Is there a point?  Or are you just brushing up on

your small talk?

Bluepoint

I like that.  Cool under fire.  I'm impressed.

. . . The gorilla didn't know whose stiff we

found, but I can fill that in.  You killed Mink,

you sonofabitch.

. . . Come here, bum.  I'm gonna send you to a

deep dark place.  And I'm gonna have fun doing

it.

. . . It was Mink, and by God I'll hear you say

it!

Tom

Is this how you taught Drop his story?

Bluepoint

I like the way you think.  Maybe when you're dead

I'll cut your head off, put it on my mantle--

Caspar

Sonafabitch. . .

. . . If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a

double-cross artist.  I had a feeling 'bout this

sonofabitch--

. . . Shut it, you sonofabitch!

. . . I'll give you something to holler about!

Tom

Johnny.  It's okay.  Bluepoint made him.  It's

okay.  It's not important.

Caspar

Then have him shut it!

. . . And we do the same to Mink!  This very same

night!

Tom

. . . Johnny.  We can't double-cross him.  He

wants to spill the whole set-up--

Caspar

I've never let a sonofabitch walk!

Tom

You've never crossed anyone . . .

Tom

. . . Four o'clock, my place.  Mink's coming in

on his own hook so I promised him the money.

Don't make me out a liar--

Caspar

. . . Lookit this, kid.

. . . Something I try and teach all my boys. . .

. . . Always put one inna brain!

72.  A CLOCK

73.  EXT   DINER

Tom

'Lo, Verna.  What's the rumpus.

Verna

I was just in the neighborhood, feeling a little

daffy.  What're you doing?

Tom

. . . Walking.

Verna

Don't let on more than you have to.

Tom

In the rain.

. . . What're you doing out?

Verna

Bernie's dead, isn't he?

Tom

. . . What makes you think that?

Verna

That's no answer.

Tom

I can't tell you anything yet.

Verna

Nobody cares, do they?  His friends didn't really

like him.

Tom

He didn't like his friends.

Verna

You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  You're someone to

talk.  You got me to tell you where he was and

then you killed him.

. . . Tell me why.  What was in it for you?

Tom

Nothing for me.

Verna

Then why?

Tom

. . . Giving up Bernie was the only way I could

see to straighten things out for Leo.

Verna

You said you didn't care about Leo.

Tom

I said we were through.  It's not the same thing.

Verna

I don't understand.  I don't care.  I don't

care what reason you had or thought you had.

Tom

. . . He's still alive.

Verna

You expect me to  believe you?

Tom

. . . No.

Verna

That's you all over, Tom.  A lie and no heart.

Tom

. . . It isn't easy, is it Verna?

. . . Are you all right?

Verna

. . . I don't know how you did it.

74.  CUT TO:

Caspar

Ya put the razor in cold water, not hot--'cause

metal does what in cold?

Driver

I dunno, Johnny.

. . . 'Ats what I'm tellin' ya. It contracts.

'At way you get a first class shave.

Driver

Okay, Johnny.

Tom's Voice:

'Lo, Sal.  You can dangle.

Driver

'Lo, Tom.  You sure?  You don't look so hot.

Tom

I'm okay.  Go ahead, I'll drive him home.

75.  OVER TOM'S SHOULDER

Voice

Mr. Duchaisne. . .

. . . There were shots.

Tom

Go down to the drugstore.  Call the police.

Mrs. Zarpas

Yes, Mr. Duchaisne.

Tom

You better stay there til the officers arrive.

Mrs. Zarpas

Yes . . .

. . . Will the cats be all right here?

Tom

. . . They'll be fine.

Bernie

I get it.  You set me up.

Bernie

. . . Anything to avoid a little dirty work

yourself, huh?

. . . How'd you know held get it and not me?  Or

didn't you care?

Tom

I figured you'd come early, and be looking for

blood.  He wouldn't, so you'd likely have the

drop on him.

Bernie

You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  I like the way you

think.  You're right, the bonehead never knew

what hit him.

. . . But if you knew I'd come looking to kill

you, how do you know I won't still?

Tom

Nothing in it for you, now.  With him dead we got

nothing on each other.  Let me have the gun.

Bernie

Why?

Tom

Pin this on Bluepoint.  Neither of us wants him

walking around after this.

Bernie

The cops'll be Leo's now.  They won't care what

they hang Bluepoint for.

Tom

I guess that's so.  If you don't mind keeping the

gun that killed Caspar.  And Mink.

. . . Why

did

Mink shoot Rug, anyway?

Bernie

I dunno, it was just a mix-up.  Here.

. . . So you're gonna say Bluepoint did this?

Tom

Mink thought Rug was tailing him?

Bernie

Yeah yeah, you know Mink.  Hysterical.  Skin full

of hop, head full of bogeymen.  Comes home crying

one day, said he had to pop a guy, one of

Bluepoint's spies.

Tom

Rug was following Verna, not Mink.  Mink just

happened to be with her.

Bernie

Yeah.  Funny, ain't it?  But you know, Mink was

terrified Bluepoint'd find out me and him were

jungled up together.

Tom

And I'll bet you'd kept him plenty worried about

that, to keep him under your thumb.

Bernie

Yeah, so what . . .

. . . Scratch, huh?  A  little bonus?

Tom

Why did Mink take Rug's hair?

Bernie

Beats me, the kid was dizzy.  Fifty-fifty on the

dough?  Or maybe I should get a little more,

since I did the deed.

. . . Okay, you keep it.  I want you to have it.

Tom

Bernie. . .

. . . We can't hang this on Bluepoint.

Bernie

Huh?  Why not?

Tom

Bluepoint's already dead, halfway 'cross town.

Bernie

What the hell are you talking about?

Tom

Bluepoint's dead.  It's gotta be you.  I mean

hell, it's your gun.

Bernie

What is this!  What the hell are you talking

about! . . .

. . . You

took

my gun!  Just your word against

mine!

Tom

Not necessarily.

Bernie

Are you crazy!  We're square!  You said it

yourself!  We got nothing on each other!

Tom

Yup.

Bernie

So what's in it for you?!  There's no angle!  You

can't just shoot me, like that!

. . . Jesus Christ!  It don't make sense!  Tommy!

Look in your heart!

Tom

What heart.

Tom

. . . Tony?  Tom.  Tell Lazarre I've got his

money. . . Yeah, all of it.  And I want to place

a bet on tonight's fight. . .

76.  CUT TO:

Terry

They set you up downstairs?

Tom

How's that?

Terry

Hootch?  Whatever?

. . . Well thanks for coming, Tom.  Leo's real

anxious to see you. . .

Tom

Yeah.  I happened to be near.

Terry

Actually. . . this might not be the best time. . .

Tom

. . . Who's he got in there?

Terry

O'Gar and the mayor.

Tom

I'll try again.

Terry

I'll tell him you stopped by.

77.  DOWNSTATRS

Tom

'Lo, Verna.

Verna

See Leo?

Tom

He was busy.

Verna

You should see him.  He has something to tell

you.

Tom

Maybe I'll run into him.

Verna

Bernie's funeral is tomorrow.  You could stop by.

Tom

Maybe.

Verna

. . . Leo has something to tell you.

Tom

So you said.

Verna

. . . Tell me something, Tom.  Why didn't you

tell me what was going on?  I thought he was

dead, and you never--

Tom

There was no point in telling you.  It could only

have queered things if it had gotten out--

Verna

Jesus, Tom!  You don't just talk to people for

the play it gives you or doesn't give you!  I

suffered, you no-heart son of a bitch!

. . . I'm sorry.  It's just that things might've

been different.  With us.  If I'd known that you

hadn't. . . done anything to him. . .

Tom

You know now.

Verna

What happened that night?

Tom

I went to a bar.  Passed out.  When I got back to

my place they were both dead.

Verna

. . . Passed out, huh?

Tom

Yeah.

Verna

It's funny. . . I've never even seen you sleep--

though you told me once about a dream you had.

Tom

Maybe I lied.

Verna

You've never been straight with me about any-

thing!  You

are

a sonofabitch!

78.  CEMETARY

Tom

Big turnout.

Verna

Drop dead.

Leo

. . . She's under a lot of strain.

Tom

Well, at least she didn't hit me.

Leo

Tommy, I'm glad you came. . .

Tom

She's taking the car.

Leo

Huh?

. . . I guess we're walking.

Tom

I guess we are.

Leo

. . . We're getting married.

Tom

. . . Congratulations, Leo.

Leo

The funny thing is. . .

She

asked

me

.  To tie the

knot.  I guess you're not supposed to say that.

Tom

It doesn't matter.  Congratulations.

Leo

Thanks. . . Hell, Tom!  Why didn't you tell me

what you were up to?!  I thought you'd really

gone over--not that I didn't deserve it.  But you

could have told me.

Tom

Telling you could only've queered things if it

had. . .

. . . There just wasn't any point.

Leo

I can see that.  Well.  It was a smart play, all

around.  I guess you know I'm grateful.

Tom

No need.

Leo

I guess you picked that fight with me just to

tuck yourself in with Caspar.

Tom

I dunno.  Do you always know why you do things,

Leo?

Leo

Course I do.

. . . It was a smart play.

Tom

You'll do fine.

Leo

. . . Jesus, Tom!  I'd give anything if you'd

work for me again!  I know I've made some

bonehead plays!  I know I can be pig-headed but,

damnit, so can you!  I need your help, and things

can be like they were, I know it!  I just know

it!  As for you and Verna--well I understand,

you're both young, and--well, damnit, Tom, I

forgive you!

Tom

I didn't ask for that and I don't want it.

. . . Goodbye, Leo.
