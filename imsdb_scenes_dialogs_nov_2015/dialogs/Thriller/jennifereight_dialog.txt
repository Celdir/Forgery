BENNY

.. after my third recovery my wife made

me swear I'd never bring another bottle

into the house.  And I never did. I bur-

ied it under the lawn.  Cut out a turf &

stood it upright with a piece of tin-

foil instead of a cork. So here we are

out in the yard, and she's happy because

I'm getting healthy in a pair of swim-

ing shorts & no way near no booze. She

decides to prune the roses. Meanwhile,

I'm laying there with a straw stuck in-

to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..

That's how crazy I was - I was sick for

half a life till I finally found my san-

ity again in these rooms. Don't take that

drink - And for the one or two new faces

I see here, I say this: just do it by the

day. You gotta do it by the day - Don't

take that drink. And keep coming to these

meetings. Because here is where it works ..

CHAIR

Thank you, Benny .. We have a few more

minutes .. Anyone else like to share? ..

BERLIN

My name's John .. and I'm an alcoholic ..

ALL

Hi, John.

BERLIN

I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of

fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting ..

But I wanna say a couple of things I hope

may be of use, particularly as Benny says,

to the new faces here. I first came into

this fellowship ten months ago. I came to

a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my

last - how could a buncha drunks help me? -

Then someone got up, I think it was Micky,

and described himself as "the shit around

which the universe revolved." I don't know

if that was original to him - it doesn't

matter, it was the first time I'd heard it,

and I still can't think of a better way to

describe how I felt - We all have our own

place in the darkness, and I was in such a

mess I could hardly fucken see - I'd lost

someone very dear to me - she hadn't died -

I had - I don't know whether she left coza

the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew

she was gonna leave - either way, the booze

won - I replaced her with alcohol & anger -

I was angry with her, myself, everyone and

everything - Where I was I wanted to be

someplace else - any place but here - any

moment but now - But here I am, and it is

now, and there's a big change about to hap-

pen in my life - and I'm going for it coz

this time I know I'm not running away - I'm

actually two miles into a 600 mile journey,

and I feel good about myself going there -

So I stopped off to share that with you -

and to thank everyone of you, and everyone

in this fellowship for letting me walk out

of here, free ..

TRAVIS

You can drive down there, Sir ..

ROSS

I'm already walking. Where is it?

TRAVIS

On the infill. The guy from

L.A.'s just gone down there ..

ROSS

He has? .. What's he doing here?

TRAVIS

He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait-

ed a good while. Said he'd go down

and take a look. I hope that's O.K.

ROSS

Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of

luck I'm goin home. What we got?

TRAVIS

A derelict.

TRIMBLE

They cut his throat ..

ROSS

Who are you?

TRIMBLE

Trimble.

ROSS

Where do you fit in, Trimble?

TRAVIS

His father's the manager, Sir.

The kid was up there shooting

vermin, and he found the body.

TRIMBLE

Get ready for it, coz I'm tell-

ing ya, you're in for a shock ..

They slit him from "ear to ear."

Ya want me to make a statement?

ROSS

Not right now. No. Thank you.

ROSS

Did you bring it with you?

BERLIN

I hope I'm not intruding?

ROSS

Be my guest. What you got?

BERLIN

Old guy, offed himself with a

knife. I can't find the knife.

TRIMBLE

They cut his throat.

ROSS

Would you get outside the tape.

And tell your dad to put that

fire out ... that ain't legal ...

TRAVIS

I wonder what would make

him do a thing like that?

ROSS

Don't annoy me, Travis.

TRAVIS

No, Sir.

ROSS

So where's the knife?

BERLIN

I dunno .. Guess the dozer

musta shifted him? You need

some hands up here to look ..

ROSS

You heard. Look for the knife.

You, too .. Move that ass ..

You done the pockets?

BERLIN

No, Sir. I haven't started

till Monday. I'm a "tourist."

ROSS

"Welcome to Eureka."

How long's he been feeling like this?

BERLIN

Week or two.  Musta been on the ker-

osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.

BLATTIS

Fucken noddle's hanging off ..

ROSS

Mr Blattis, of our local news-

paper. You sure it's a suicide?

BERLIN

Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..

BLATTIS

What does that mean, Sergeant?

BERLIN

Cut your own throat, you're ner-

vous about it, tend to hesitate.

He's got three trial cuts, lower

left side of the neck, before he

works up courage for the big one.

BLATTIS

You think Popeye would know that?

ROSS

I don't think Popeye would be here.

VENABLES (V.O.)

Dead dog over here, Sir ...

ROSS

Find the knife. And Venab-

les, is the coroner called?

VENABLES

Yes, Sir .. He's delayed ..

BLATTIS

Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna

leave you. I got a couple of

questions for the paper, Serg-

eant? Mind if I swing by later,

wring out a tea-bag with you?

BERLIN

My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?

BLATTIS

Your predecessor. He did-

n't like to get outta bed.

Catch you later, Freddy T ..

BERLIN

So what happened to the

barbecues, and fishing?

ROSS

Watch my lips, coz you're not

gonna believe this - this is

a rare occurrence. We haven't

had a body in eighteen months.

How does anyone dead

as this lose a knife?

BERLIN

What about that kid, Ross?

ROSS

Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.

(Stands to shout)

Travis. Find that kid and get

the knife off him. He's gonna

lie to you - but he's got it -

so get it. Well, go on, get on

with it. Whatta you staring at?

TRAVIS

I think I found some-

thing horrible, Sir

ROSS

Whatta you mean, "horrible?"

TRAVIS

I think I've found a hand.

BERLIN

Looks like a woman's hand?

ROSS

What do you think?

BERLIN

I think you're here all day.

ROSS

How much longer we here? We're

not gonna find nothing else .. ?

BERLIN

We give it one more hour. Did

the photographer do the dogs?

ROSS

The dogs?

BERLIN

Two dogs. He should do the dogs.

VENABLES

Sergeant - we got a brassiere over

here. Looks like it could be blood.

ROSS

Oh, shit.

BERLIN

Alright, I'm coming ..

Another intrusion from the radio. TRAVIS repeats the question.

TRAVIS

The coroner wants to know if

we can release the derelict?

ROSS

Ask him.

BERLIN

Yeah, he can go ...

ROSS

Think I'll lay down with him.

Only way I'll get outta here.

BERLIN

It's good to be with you, Ross.

ROSS

Glad you finally made it, Bro ...

BLATTIS

You want some umbrella?

BERLIN

Is this normal?

BLATTIS

Average rainfall, 48 inches.

Pisses down, October to June.

Better in the summer.  You

get to fucka few tourists ..

BLATTIS [BERLIN]

Not married are you, Sergeant? [No.]

That's good, you get to fuck a few

more. So how long you known Freddy?

BERLIN

Freddy? Forever - he was my serg-

eant when I was a kid - don't get

to see a lot of each other - but

we been buddies two hundred years ..

BLATTIS

Did he get you the job?

BERLIN

I think he would have if he could

have - been trying to get me up

here long enough - I think he may

have bribed the old guy to retire ..

BLATTIS

Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.

CITRINE

Sergeants Serato, and Taylor.

Mr Travis, I think you know ..

BERLIN

Do me a favor, Travis?  Bring in

the resta the stuff from my car?

BLATTIS

Did you find the knife, Sergeant?

BERLIN

No .. But we have a theory ..

BLATTIS

Kid told me he didn't take it?

BERLIN

Maybe he's lying to you?

BLATTIS

Is it true you found a hand?

Is that it?

CITRINE (O.S.)

Interview over, Blattis ...

BLATTIS

C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive,

tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..

CITRINE

.. we got a body part. We don't

know what it is - probably some

kind of hospital debris - we're

gonna try and check it out. O.K.

Now you know as much as we do ..

BLATTIS

Grateful for your candor, Sir.

CITRINE

Then do me a favor, and keep

this outta the newspaper - that

dump serves a dozen different

communities, we don't even know

if it's ours? Till we do I don't

want no one worrying about ..

BLATTIS

Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?

CITRINE

Come on, Michael, outta here, the

guys trying to move in. I told you

what we know, something else, you-

'll be the first to hear about it ..

BERLIN

Why did he ask if it was frozen?

CITRINE

That, I couldn't tell you .. And

don't worry about anya this crap,

by the time you're back it's gone ..

BERLIN (Phone)

Listen, my time isn't good - but two

things - really important - the bras-

siere I sent you? - I need to know if

those stains are human blood - and if

they are, do they match the blood in

the sample? - C'mon, gimme a break, I

don't know anyone up here, it would

take two weeks - C'mon, Ronny, I'm ask-

ing nice? I really need to know wheth-

er I'm interested in that brassiere? ..

You're my favourite man - raining -

I gotta go - Ronny - I gotta go - I

got a house fulla removal men and a

date at the morgue - And, Ron, Con-

gratulations - you're my first call ..

PATHOLOGIST

.. if the knife hadn't killed

him, the booze would .. I nev-

er seen such a bad cirrhosis ..

BERLIN

You say the cut's left to right?

(He does)

Isn't that unusual? He's left handed?

PATHOLOGIST

I guess he was so drunk, he did-

n't know which hand he was using.

(Re box)

What are you gonna do with it?

BERLIN

Depends how healthy it is. If it's

any good, I'll try and get a print ..

Oh, Ross, that newspaper guy at the

station, asked me if the hand was

"frozen?" Why would he ask me that?

ROSS

Frozen? .. I've no idea ..

A few beers wouldn't do

that to you, would they?

PATHOLOGIST

No, Freddy .. Not a few ..

ROSS

You do a rush on three pizzas?

MARGIE

I'm not giving him Pizza. I

haven't seem him for a year?

I'm gonna cook him a dinner.

ROSS

Dinner's another night, darlin ..

This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..

MARGIE

Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?

ROSS

Friday night at City Hall. Got a

great chance to frighten the fat.

MARGIE

Freddy's new obsession ..

BERLIN

Who is who?

ROSS

A professional, whining, con-person

bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..

She's an accounts-manager, very pal-

ly with our mayor, up to her elbows

in fraud, and I just can't prove it ..

MARGIE

So tonight she confesses?

ROSS

Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..

BERLIN

Not for me ..

ROSS

What d'you mean, I just opened it

for you? This is French champagne.

MARGIE

No it isn't .. It's Californian ..

ROSS

Even better.

BERLIN

Not today .. I'm on a diet to-

day .. I'll take a diet soda ..

ROSS

Since when did you drink diet soda?

MARGIE

Stop nagging him.  If he doesn't

want it, he doesn't want it. You-

're quacking like an old duck ..

Here you go, Honey .. You're

looking wonderful, John .. I

can't believe we got you here ..

ROSS

How's the new residence?

BERLIN

O.K.

ROSS

What does that mean?

BERLIN

Not too good in daylight ..

ROSS

C'mon, just shut your eyes until

it's painted.  You're gonna love

it. This is "God's Country," John.

BERLIN

Would you drop these off for me?

You know something strange about

that hand? I think it was frozen?

VENABLES

Frozen?

BERLIN

Yeah. What does that mean to you?

C'mon, Venables, you're a policeman.

And policemen always have an answer?

VENABLES

Well, Sir ..

BERLIN

Well, what?

VENABLES

Well, we had a very bad murder

here, coupla years ago. Not act-

ually in our county, but south

of here. Girl with no head, no

hands. You didn't read about it?

(He didn't)

It was big shit. They had forty,

fifty detective working it. Nev-

er identified her.  Never found

the head, never found the hands ..

So it could be that some crazy's

stored her hand in a freezer, and

only now decided to get rid of it?

BERLIN

Where do I find the file on that?

VENABLES

In there if we got anything? I

believe the code was "Jennifer."

Was it really frozen, Sergeant?

BERLIN

No. Been dead two weeks.

BERLIN

What time is it?

ROSS

Seven thirty-five .. Here,

"Town Gets Top Cop." I was

gonna pin it to your wall.

BERLIN

Why so coy about the word "frozen"?

ROSS

Because, don't get into it ...

BERLIN

There's nothing in the files?

ROSS

Watch my lips .. Don't get into it ..

It wasn't our case, wasn't our coun-

ty, and got nothing to do with that.

BERLIN

Look - 1 - 2 - 3/4 - 5 - 6  - 7 ..

I count eleven scars on this hand,

and four that might be? .. Now I

count em on my hand? Five. I'm 42

years old.  This girl's about 18?

How come she's got so many scars?

So tell me about "Jennifer?"

You know I'm gonna find out.

ROSS

It's an "unsolved." They spent 500

thousand dollars & bought emselves

a dead end - You might wanna check

it with Taylor, he worked the case.

BERLIN

I already did. What's his problem?

ROSS

He thinks you stole his promotion.

(Re cigarettes)

What exactly you doin there, John?

BERLIN

It's a method for quitting smoking.

ROSS

That's an interesting method?

Must help beat the withdrawal?

BERLIN

It's a technique I read about.

If you smoke 60 a day, you buy

three packs, throw one cigar-

ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2,

you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..

ROSS

Why don't you throw them

all away, and smoke none?

BERLIN

Because it's a ritual you gotta

go through with. I'm down to 10.

ROSS

You want my advice?

BERLIN

Maybe?

ROSS

Find yourself a farmer's daughter

with nice big fucking tits, and

shake that "bye-bye." Send it to

Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..

MARGIE

You're all done except the floor.

BERLIN

You're a saint, Margie, thanks ..

MARGIE

Don't forget the wagon, Darlin?

ROSS

You gotta stop smoking ..

BERLIN

I am stopping smoking ...

ROSS

I don't mean this "system" shit

that keeps you sucking, I mean

stop .. I was exactly like you

are .. I used to wake in the

night - heart going so hard

I coulda made love with my left

tit .. If I can stop, you can ..

BERLIN

How'd you do it, old man?

ROSS

Someone bet me a dollar ..

BERLIN

A dollar? .. Not worth

giving up for a dollar ..

ROSS

Alright. I'll bet you fifty?

BERLIN

Fifty dollars?  You got a bet.

ROSS

What are you gonna do, Soldier?

BERLIN

I'm gonna dig up "Jennifer."

ROSS

Chief, I gotta talk to

ya about this fat lady?

CITRINE

What about her?

ROSS

She's making my life a

misery .. I wanna give

her a lie-detector test?

CITRINE (O.S.)

What is that?

BERLIN

Laser enhancement of the finger-

tip .. it's really bothering me ..

See these striations right here?

(Green on the screen)

It's like she's always worrying

the end of her finger? Rubbing it

with a thumb nail, or something?

She's almost identical to Jennifer.

Slim - White - same age - bra size

is even the same. Nicely made lady.

CITRINE

How do you know her hair's black?

BERLIN

Hair on her hand. Plus Jen-

nifer had raven black hair.

CITRINE

What is all this Jennifer stuff?

These cases aren't connected, John?

BERLIN

Yes, Sir, I think they maybe.

I think "Jennifer," and this

lady got hit by the same guy?

CITRINE

I don't see that at all ..

BERLIN

I got four points of posit-

ive comparison on the cut ..

CITRINE

Yeah, that's all very inter-

esting, but where's the body?

I don't know nothing about this "Jenn-

ifer" girl, cept what some of the guys

told me - but principal feature of the

case was a gruesome displayal of the

body. He wanted it found. So if this is

the same guy, why's he hidden this one?

BISLEY

Just wondered if you had time to

get around to my pharmacy stuff?

BERLIN

You'll have it in the morning ..

BISLEY

Alright, I'll try again tomorrow.

CITRINE

Probably making him feel a bit

antsy seein it back on the wall.

He worked a lotta time on this.

BERLIN

I thought it was Taylor's case?

CITRINE

Sucked in officers from all over

the county. And it was the worst

six months this station ever had.

BERLIN

What do you want me to do, Chief?

CITRINE

I'm not telling you what to do.

What I will say, is right now,

that child's tricycle there is

more important to me than this ..

Why don't you give it a minute, &

stop by my office. We should talk.

ROSS

.. what does he think it is?

BERLIN [ROSS]

Everything it isn't [make a left].

He even tried a "self-inflicted."

ROSS

It's possible.

BERLIN

C'mon, Ross, the bra and hand were

in different bags a 100 feet apart ..

What's she gonna do?  Dump her bra

in one bag, her hand in the other,

and wander off whistling Hey Jude?

ROSS

It's the garage on the far corner.

You can't stop it, can you?

BERLIN

What do you mean?

ROSS

Worrying - clicking - picking - You

may as well be back in Los Angeles.

BERLIN

What do you mean, Ross?

ROSS

Why don't you dump it? Mail it off.

Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?

BERLIN

Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"

ROSS

Because I dislike her too much ..

BERLIN

O.K. and I'm not in love with this

fukker? That's how I feel about him.

ROSS

No you don't. That's how you think

you feel about him. That's how you

feel about yourself. You won't give

yourself one-fucking-minute for you.

Wait for me. It might not be ready.

BERLIN

I just had this insane idea - if

I'm wrong, I'll take a week off

and redecorate your entire house ..

She's blind, Ross - that's why all

the scars - hear that traffic light?

That noise is to help blind people -

that's why the marks on her finger-

tips? - this lady reads in Braille ..

ANN

Shasta-Trinity Institute. Line one.

BERLIN (New call)

Hello .. Yes .. This is Sergeant

Berlin .. Yes, that's right .. I

believe my assistant explained? ..

How long ago was that? .. Uh-huh.

O.K. .. Who is who? .. Whass his

name? Goodridge? O.K. I'll hold ..

ROSS

Pig Woman agreed to take a test.

BERLIN

I think I got something - twenty

two years old, dark hair - study-

ing mathematics - (Yes, yes, I'm

holding) - Last seen 5 weeks ago ..

GOODRIDGE

As recent as we have .. What ex-

actly is your interest in Amber?

BERLIN

I'm afraid I can't give you an ans-

wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex-

plained to your secretary, we're do-

ing a lotta looking, but we're not

even sure it's her we're lookin for ..

GOODRIDGE

Then what are you hoping I'm gon-

na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?

BERLIN

I was hopin since we spoke that you

might have remembered something that

would give us an idea where she is?

GOODRIDGE

Then you could have saved yourself

a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I

said on the phone's the same as I'm

saying now. I got no idea where Amb-

er is, or who it was took her there.

ROSS

A blind girl can just walk out of

here, and you don't know who with?

GOODRIDGE

You find something curious in that?

ROSS

Yeah, I guess I do.

GOODRIDGE

Then let me put your mind at ease ..

Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she

has some useful vision - and second,

this isn't a prison, it's a college

of higher education - a severe vis-

ual disability doesn't mean my stud-

ents don't value their independence

as much as anybody else - and Amber

was a very independent young woman -

She decided to leave - so she left ..

ROSS

And you got no idea with who?

GOODRIDGE

No, Sergeant, I got no idea with who.

And I might add, that in another six

weeks, a hundred and fifty students

will be leaving here, & driving away

for their Christmas holidays with pe-

ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..

You have an appointment with Miss

Robertson?

BERLIN

Yes, Sir.

GOODRIDGE

As she's a member of my staff,

may I ask what this is about?

BERLIN

Well, apparently, she saw Amber the

weekend she left, & was briefly in

the room with the guy she left with.

GOODRIDGE

I see .. Well, she's teaching an-

other class at four .. I'd apprec-

iate it if you don't detain her ..

ROSS

Where is everyone?

BERLIN

I dunno .. I guess this is

staff side of the building?

HELENA

What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?

BERLIN

I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right

here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna

take a few notes, if that's O.K.?

(She nods)

O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me

in what ever way you want, what

you can remember about the time

you spent with Amber on the aft-

ernoon she left? Take your time,

and nothing's too trivial, O.K.

HELENA

Well, I think I told you on the

phone .. I went up to her room

to say good-bye, and we just sat

on the bed and chatted a while,

while her friend was coming in

and out collecting her things ..

BERLIN

What kind of friend? Was he a boy

friend? An old friend? New friend?

That's O.K. Can you give me any

idea what this fellow was like?

(Headshake)

Well, d'you know how old he was?

(Headshake)

Alright, let me put it this way?

How old d'you think I am? Twenty-

six? Thirty-nine? Or fifty-three?

HELENA

Fifty-three.

BERLIN

You must have some idea about him.

HELENA

When we spoke on the phone,

did you know I was blonde?

BERLIN

No.

HELENA

Why not? You heard my voice?

We don't have some kind of

sixth-sense, you know. Ex-

cept in ridiculous novels ..

He used a breath freshener ...

And I think his name was John?

BERLIN

John? .. You never said that

on the phone? .. What makes

you think his name was John?

HELENA

I don't know. I guess she must

have called him John? I'm mak-

ing tea. Would you like some?

BERLIN

This looks promising .. I

think this one could be it?

ROSS

Thank Christ we got a witness.

BERLIN

Let me just keep going a while.

She might remember something?

ROSS

What? She's blind, Bro. You

may as well ask one of these

Beethoven guys on the piano?

We're better off having another

pop at old Abe Lincoln down the-

re? Get angry with the prick. Get

some of his "useful visions" in?

Someone must have seen something?

This is fucken crazy. Two hours

here, two hours back, and the

only word I've written is John ..

HELENA

Well, he just said, come on,

hurry up, will you, because

it's starting to snow again.

And I remember, he was a lit-

tle breathless from carrying

the cases because the elevat-

or had gone out that weekend.

BERLIN

The elevator wasn't working?

HELENA

No, it has a mind of its own.

BERLIN

Can I see your hands?

HELENA

My hands?

I have a class.  I have to go.

BERLIN

Is there anything else you can

tell me? Anything about him or

her? Doesn't matter how small?

HELENA

No. Except he smoked. Like you.

BERLIN

Me?

HELENA

Yes, I could smell it on his

breath, like I can on your's.

I'm late .. I really have to go ..

BERLIN

D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?

HELENA

No.

BERLIN

Lotta scratch-marks on your door?

HELENA

Sometimes I look after friends dogs,

if they go to dances, or something?

ROSS

Could I just refer you to

this memo here, Sergeant?

BERLIN

Did Amber have a dog?

HELENA

Yes.

BERLIN

What color was it?

HELENA

I don't know.

BERLIN

.. if she writes, or calls, or any-

thing at all, you let me know, O.K.

I'll leave a number with the office ..

What exactly do you teach, Helena?

HELENA

Music composition .. and cello ..

ROSS

Fifty of em. And I want em now.

BERLIN

Had a seeing Eye Dog since she

was eighteen .. didn't I tell

you those dogs meant something ..

ROSS

No, you didn't.

BERLIN

Alright, I didn't, but I nearly

did, and if I had I'd have been

right .. I knew there was some-

thing about that Labrador, that

dog was too good to be dead ..

We gotta get back up that dump ..

ROSS

No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not

going up there again. Might find

someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.

BERLIN

We're going.

ROSS

Forget it. They got stringent hyg-

iene rules. He's long gone in lime.

BERLIN

Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..

ROSS

So am I. But where's my money?

BERLIN

Don't start again. If you win a

bet, you can't keep winning it ..

ROSS

Pay me, and I shut up.

BERLIN

I haven't got it.

ROSS

Then give me that Zippo.

BERLIN

Why?

ROSS

I need some security. I

don't trust you anymore.

BERLIN

I had one puff on a pipe.

ROSS

I don't want excuses, I want that

weird-looking stuff called "cash."

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do?

I'm gonna do you a big favor ..

Forget the 50 and I'll keep this.

BERLIN

What do you want it for?

ROSS

To throw out of the window.

BERLIN

What are you doing, Ross?

I've had that 15 years! ..

ROSS

It's not your friend. It

keeps you sucking. Remem-

ber the old Bum's lungs?

BERLIN

I remember the old bastard's

liver! I don't believe you

did that. I had a great sent-

imental attachment to that.

ROSS

You want me to stop the car?

BERLIN

No! Get me to that garbage dump!

I'm gonna find that fucking dog!

BERLIN

You didn't shoot him did you?

TRIMBLE

Me .. I love dogs .. Ask him?

BERLIN (Phone)

Berlin .. yeah .. that's nice of

you, Helena, but I already found

out .. black, yes .. No, no, of

course not, good of you to call ..

You heard a what? .. A hollow car?

Yes, I'm still here .. Why didn't

you mention that? .. I see .. Al-

right, we should talk again .. No,

I'm just south of my eye-lids in

it right now .. How about Sunday?

BERLIN

.. I put the slug in for a ballis-

tics report, the man tells me, for

get it. Soft lead, it's worthless ..

I think, fuck it. And fuck Citrine.

I call a friend of mine in Los Ang-

eles, and he runs our whole damned

show through a main-frame looking

for anything similar to our ladies

shot with a twenty-two - you don't

believe what he finds in San Diego ..

Would you shut it down a min-

ute, Ross? This is important.

ROSS

Alright, let's take a walk around

the block .. I gotta buy a gasket ..

BERLIN

Six girls over a period of 18

months, and give or take a head

or two, the M.O.'s exactly the

same. Dark hair. No hands. All

shot with a high velocity twen-

ty-two in the back of the head.

ROSS

How come the F.B.I. don't put

anya this together? They work-

ed over "Jennifer" for months?

BERLIN

They possibly did - but they nev-

er had a head, so they never had

a bullet - and they never got an

I.D. - not on any of em - never

bust a homicide unless you know

who your victim is - we're the

first to get a positive identity.

ROSS

Identity of whom? You got a girl,

doesn't even have a driver's lic-

ense? .. She's untraceable, John ..

You need fifty detectives on this.

BERLIN

That's what I'm here for. I want

you to come and see Citrine with

me?  He's not gonna here it from

me but I know he'd listen to you.

ROSS

Listen to me saying what?

BERLIN

I wanna take that fucking Blind In-

stitute to pieces .. Every address

book, every phone call, everyone in

and outta there in the last 5 years ..

ROSS

For a dead dog?

BERLIN

We've fused into a major series,

Ross. This girl isn't the second

victim. This is "Jennifer Eight."

That old Wino on the heap wasn't

a suicide. He stumbled into some-

thing, saw something, and whoever

took him out knew how to fake it.

ROSS

That isn't what you said before.

BERLIN

I was wrong.

I'm going in to see Citrine this

afternoon. Will you come with me?

ROSS

You're not .. He's in hospital ..

He was trying out a new pair of

skis in his hallway. The phone

rings, and he goes for it, and

falls off. He must be the only

skier in Northern California to

break a leg in his living room.

BERLIN

You believe me, don't you?

ROSS

What does it matter what I bel-

ieve? .. What you gotta worry

about is what Citrine believes ..

But I can't help you with this. We

can't go through the door with two

contentious issues, you with a mass

murderer, and me with the Mayor's

best friend. Do that, we lose both.

I'm sorry, Bro, you're on your own.

HELENA

Have you been here long?

BERLIN

No, just a minute or two .. I

knocked on your door - no one

home, so I followed the music ..

HELENA

I'm sorry. I'll get my things.

BERLIN

No problem. I'm not in a hurry.

Matter of fact, I saw a little

restaurant place down the road.

Looked kinda pretty? I thought

maybe we could have some lunch?

Alright, whatever .. Was some-

one in here with you? When I

came in the door was flapping?

HELENA

I don't think so .. No one

comes here at the weekends ..

HELENA (O.S.)

I suppose I'm the worst

witness you've ever had?

BERLIN (O.S.)

I gotta admit, you're one of

them. Just wish I knew what

you meant by a "hollow car?"

HELENA (O.S.)

Well, some cars sound fat and

some cars sound thin, and this

kind of car sounded "hollow" ..

Maybe it was a foreign car?

Our kinda cars sound "fat."

Are you sure you wanna see it?

It's another three floors up?

Oh, all the time. They keep

threatening to have it re-

placed, but they never will.

HELENA

If I came to the diner with

you, would you bring me back?

BERLIN

Of course I would ..

What are you staring at, Hel-

ena? .. I mean .. I'm sorry ..

HELENA

That's alright. You suddenly

reminded me of him .. He was

standing right where you are,

kind of breathless, like you.

I'll get my coat, wait

for you downstairs ..

BERLIN

I'm sorry, someone slammed the

door on me. I couldn't get out.

HELENA

It was probably the wind.

BERLIN

What are you reading?

HELENA

Hamlet. Have you read it?

BERLIN

No.

HELENA

You should. It's wonderful.

47:  INT.  RESTAURANT/DINER.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.

BERLIN

.. I'll tell you what, if I prom-

ise to stop being a cop, will you

promise to stop being a witness?

I mean, we don't havta sit here

waiting for me to ask the next

question? You could ask one, too?

HELENA

Are you wearing a uniform?

BERLIN

No.

HELENA

Oh.

BERLIN

Well, I'm glad we got the conver-

sational side of lunch over with.

HELENA

I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting

in the middle of a restaurant .. I

feel like everyone's looking at me ..

BERLIN

There's no one "looking at you" ..

There's hardly anyone in here. The

only person looking at you, is me.

HELENA

Are you married?

BERLIN

Was. But I don't like to talk about it.

HELENA

You just asked me to ask you questions.

BERLIN

I know, but you pick on the one time

in my life I like not to remember. I

was in the bad lands. Really not well.

It's something that happens to a lota

cops. We don't wanna talk about that.

HELENA

"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."

BERLIN

Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"

HELENA

No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?

BERLIN

I don't know, I haven't read much. I

don't think poetry's my kinda thing?

HELENA

Do you pray?

BERLIN

Pray?

HELENA

You said, you were in the bad lands?

BERLIN

No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once,

about God, just around the time I was

getting well .. He was a nasty lookin

little guy, moved into the apartment

right on topa me .. I said, don't you

listen to people's prayers?  He said,

prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.

BERLIN

.. I got really sick of the street ..

so I went to school and became a

Scientific Services Officer, which

is basically a Scene of Crime Off-

icer. Then this came up, and I got

what they call a Lateral Transfer ..

I couldn't take another minute of

Los Angeles .. Felt like I'd said

sorry in every street in the city ..

HELENA

Sorry?

BERLIN

.. sorry your father, mother sis-

ter, whatever .. I couldn't take

another day of it .. Come on, I'm

gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..

HELENA

Coz I wanted to feel the snow

on my face .. I think that's

when I heard her call him John?

Is it snowing now?

BERLIN

No. Getting dark though.

You think you'd know this man? If

he was in the room with you again?

HELENA

You've already asked me that ..

Amber's dead, isn't she?

BERLIN

Yes. I'm sorry.

CITRINE

You're pushing this too hard. It's

like you want me to say stop? You

must know that's the way this is

going, John? There's other work to

do, why don't ya ease off a little?

BERLIN

Coz this is a major & we're closer to

this bastard than anyone's ever been.

CITRINE

Then where's the body? .. Where's

the body, and why's he hidden it?

BERLIN

He hasn't hidden it. He never made

a hit this far north before, and

he never read a weather forecast ..

She's probably fifteen feet from

the highway, three feet under snow.

CITRINE

Have you got a match on the bullet?

BERLIN

No.

CITRINE

Have you got a print from the hand?

BERLIN

No, Sir.

CITRINE

It could be anyone's hand. Illeg-

ally disposed of hospital debris ..

BERLIN

It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog.

Her dog's shot. And she's missing.

CITRINE

She's not "missing." Did she shout?

Did she scream? Did he coerce her?

No. She left of her own free will ..

And if she gets on a plane and goes

to Peru with the prick, she's still

not missing. You got no case, John.

BERLIN

If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..

CITRINE

I have heard you. You just don't like

hearing me. You got this whole damned

thing outta proportion. I don't know

what you gotten used to in Los Angeles,

but I don't believe there's a Police

Chief, in this country, would put a

task force together for a body part ..

BERLIN

We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..

CITRINE

We have a body part in suspicious

circumstances - a tailor's dummy

wearing a brassiere - and a bill

for seventeen dollars for its wig!

ROSS

Did he shut you down?

BERLIN

All but .. How you doing?

ROSS

I dunno, I daren't go in there -

just about get her wired up, and

the fucking mayor walks in - mad

as hell - what are we doing fuck-

ing with his staff? We should be

out chasing major violators ..

BERLIN

I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.

He thinks the kid shot the dog ..

He didn't.

ROSS

Did I say he did?

BERLIN

You looked like you did?

ROSS

No, I think you'll find I looked like

he could have? By accident even? He's

up here spraying the scenery all day.

BERLIN

He didn't shoot it, Ross. And

no way by accident. There's a

flash-burn. It was point-blank.

SERATO

Flying colors ...

ROSS

Say you didn't say that, Angelo?

SERATO

I said it.

ROSS

Oh my God Mother's shit. Are we in it?

EXPERT

This is the important one. She

gets a dead straight line, and

that's an exceptional reading ..

SERATO

.. this is the stupidest thing

we ever done. Fucking Citrine's

gonna fire one of us for this ..

ROSS

I can't believe it. I just

know she someway busted it.

EXPERT

This is an honest girl. She

couldn't lie if she tried ..

BERLIN

Is she lying, Ross?

ROSS

Yes.

BERLIN

My name's Sergeant John Berlin.

I been a policeman 17 years: 16

years 9 months of which with the

L.A.P.D. I witnessed literally

hundreds of lie-detector tests,

and I never seen one like this?

EMERSON

What d'ya mean, Sergeant?

BERLIN

Well, look at it. Look at this

line? That's the important one.

Dead straight down the page. No-

body gets a dead straight down

the page. Even our expert says

a dead straight's "exceptional."

Thought you might wanna comment?

EMERSON

I wasn't actually lying, Officer.

BERLIN

You busted the box, lady! You flunk-

ed it .. You lied about things you

didn't need to lie about .. The only

truthful statement you made's your

name .. Your name is Carol Emerson?

You tell one more lie, you're go-

ing in a cell. Sergeant Ross is

coming in to take your statement.

MARGIE

Such a shame .. She's

a really sweet kid ..

ROSS

She's a doll. But I wish he

hadn't brought her out here.

Bobby, what happened to that

beer? Rule one, is you don't

diddle around with a witness.

MARGIE

He's happy, darlin ..

ROSS

I'm sure he is. But gettin in-

to the "element" is a bad idea.

Tell em I'm going up the coast

a way, get out of this weather.

MARGIE (O.S.)

Except for the hair color,

she looks just like Suzanne?

ROSS (O.S.)

Well, that's who she is.

Cept she can't run away.

MARGIE

You want something, darling?

ROSS

I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.

How much longer you on that diet?

BERLIN

I'm doing it by the day ...

How's your little sister?

MARGIE

She's in Europe ..

BERLIN

Working?

ROSS

She married some English prick.

MARGIE

He's not that bad of a guy ..?

ROSS

Got a handshake like a

partially excited penis.

MARGIE

Her loss, darlin ..

Anyway, you're doing O.

K. She's a sweet heart.

ROSS

Why's she blind, Bro?

BERLIN

Car accident.

Whole family wiped out.

ROSS

No shit.

Strap me in. Here comes another.

Worst day's fishing I ever had ..

BERLIN

It's been a great day.

ROSS

You just go easy, Brother ...

(Looks at fish)

Alright, we're all goin home.

HELENA (V.O.)

I really liked Margie ..

What does she do?

BERLIN (V.O.)

She runs a kind of hair dress-

ing and you know, beauty salon ..

HELENA (V.O.)

Have you known her long?

BERLIN (V.O.)

I was married to her sister ..

You don't ask what I'm like?

HELENA

I know what you're like ..

BERLIN

How d'you know what I'm like?

HELENA

Ross told me.

BERLIN

Really? What did he say?

HELENA

He said you're quite chubby.

And you have a nervous tick.

BERLIN

He said that? What else did

he say?

HELENA

Just your age.

BERLIN

Which is what?

HELENA

Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..

BERLIN

You wanna drive? C'mon we're

in a car park, miles from any-

where .. There's nothing arou-

nd but nothing and sand dunes ..

C'mon it'll be fun. You can

drive me around in circles ..

We're going along a little track.

It's O.K. It's not a public road.

It's alright, I'm sorry. It was

my fault, it wasn't a good idea.

HELENA

That was the "Hollow Car," John.

BERLIN

A Volkswagen van? Are you sure?

BERLIN [Phone]

.. [is it a two door, slide door, a

what?] I don't know [Well, you gotta

get closer than just a V.W. van. You-

're talking maybe 10/15 thousand veh-

icles?] What happens if you just run

the name "John" against all of them?

[Frankly, that isn't gonna do you any

good. You'll be knocking on doors all

over the state. You gotta request tho-

se "Jennifer" files - maybe something

in them, give us some kinda reference?]

I can't request anything right now ..

push one more inch, I lose the lot ..

[Well, listen, I'll run the Bay Area

for you. But if you want a print-out

of every John in California with a V.

W. van, that's gotta be official. I'm

sorry] .. That's O.K. Thank you, Dan ..

CITRINE

I'm shutting you down on

this "blind thing," John.

BERLIN

Is that my punishment for

embarrassing Mr Heineman?

CITRINE

Don't underestimate me .. the

Mayor's pissed - but that's

nothing to do with this - sit

down - How many times have you

been up at that institute?

BERLIN

Three or four.

CITRINE

I'm talking, outside the girl?

BERLIN

Once.

CITRINE

Got a letter from this Goodridge guy?

Says, you're upsetting his students?

BERLIN

That's bullshit,

CITRINE

He says, you freaked one of em out?

(Reading the letter)

"Asking a newly blind kid if he can

'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..

BERLIN

I never asked if he could "see." I

just asked one or two of the stud-

ents if they remembered anything?

CITRINE

And did they?

BERLIN

No.

CITRINE

I'm not a nasty man, John, I'm a nice

man .. I get a lot of Christmas cards

(a lot of cards on the wall)

.. and I'm getting a lot of complaints.

The guy you replaced was something you-

're not - a lazy sonovabitch - but the

reality is, I was getting a faster ser-

vice outta Popeye than I am outta you ..

I can't allow this to continue, John ..

I don't want you up at that institute

again .. and I'm flat-out about that ..

I'm sorry, I know it means something

to you - you can go tell your witness

if you feel you must - but as far as

you're concerned, the case is closed ..

BERLIN

God, it pisses me off, Ross.

ROSS

No God, Brother. If there was

a God, asses wouldn't be at

the perfect height for kicking.

VENABLES

Can I buy you a beer, Sergeant?

ROSS

Don't try and ingratiate your-

self with me, Venables. But just

this once I'll have a Heineken ..

and John here will have one, too.

(Look at those Amazingly Bos-

oms) You wanna beer, King Jay?

TAYLOR

No, I gotta go .. I'm nights ..

BLATTIS

Gimme a ride?

TAYLOR

Sure ..

How's that hand-job comin along, John?

ROSS

Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.

TAYLOR

No one's gonna make that Gent. Six

months investigation, & the nearest

we got, we thought he was a sailor.

BERLIN

A sailor?

TAYLOR

Yeah, in and outta Frisco on

the big boats .. Every lead

we had went right out to sea ..

Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..

BERLIN

How come he's suddenly so forth-

coming? I'd like to kick him right

in the ass. If he'd discussed it

with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..

ROSS

Stop it.

BERLIN

I never knew about the sailor the-

ory, Ross. He might have that one

little thing I need in his files?

ROSS

John, stop it. The case is on its ass,

you're closed. (Reaches for a menu.)

C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a

drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..

Alright .. Let's have some wine ..

ROSS

You gotta stop calling Los Angeles ..

You're dragging L.A. around with you

like an addiction.  Look at the shit

you're putting yourself through? For

what? For nothing, I know it, I been

there. Remember me? Up to my asshole

in anger, living off the vitamins in

cigarettes?  If there's a body under

the snow, fuck it. Let somebody else

worry about it. You gotta accept you

stopped living in that world, & try

and give yourself a break in this ..

BERLIN

Just makes to so God damned mad ..

ROSS

You're a fucking great policeman, but

give yourself a break. You're here 5

minutes, you find yourself a fucking

homicide? .. Not many people could do

that in a place like this .. And you

gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky

areas in this case? .. I mean, stop

me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..

How d'you know this girl isn't lying

to you .. Not lying as such, but mak-

ing up stuff to keep you coming back?

BERLIN

She wasn't lying about the van.

ROSS

Alright, she wasn't lying about the

van. But it could have been any van?

Any little foreign diesel? .. She's

blind, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro-

bably lonely, and you're a nice guy

to have around .. But you're getting

far too far into the element, Brother ..

BERLIN

Sure.

ROSS

You don't need me to tell you what hap-

pens when you get emotionally involved?

BERLIN

Alright, enough, Ross. You'll

bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...

BERLIN

.. feel like I'm getting close to

this guy .. and all the time, feel

like I'm sharpening a pencil with

a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..

TAYLOR

What are you looking for?

BERLIN

Vehicle references.

TAYLOR

Wrong cabinet.

I'm gonna get some coffee. When you

finish in here, maybe you'll let me

know? .. I got a report to type up ..

HELENA

I wanted it to be a surprise.

BERLIN

I have to talk to you, Helena.

HELENA

I know.

BERLIN

You know? How do you know?

HELENA

Coz you hardly said a word

since you got here. But you been

thinking pretty loud ..

I'll make some more coffee.

BERLIN

Got your driver's license?

I noticed you coming outta the

institute. You up there a lot?

WOMAN

Oh, it was you that

nearly ran into me?

BERLIN

No, it was you that nearly ran

into me .. You up there a lot?

WOMAN

I guess, more than usual this

time of the year. My mother & I

run an Arts & Crafts center, we

buy a lot from the institutes ..

BERLIN

Where's your store, Amanda?

WOMAN

Oakland.

BERLIN

Next pit-stop, you make sure your

doors are locked.  Merry Christmas.

TAYLOR

Just easy on the words you're

putting in my face, Sergeant ..

ROSS

Whass going on here?

TAYLOR

His blind friend got "attacked."

Angelo went up there, and some-

how, it got itself in the paper.

BERLIN

You put it in there.

TAYLOR

I may have said some-

thing. I don't recall.

BERLIN

Don't lie, Taylor. I just had

this Blattis guy on the phone

asking me for a comment - you

gave him the whole damned case!

TAYLOR

Alright, I gave him the case? ..

So the case is closed, so what?

BERLIN

So read it! You just hung

a target around her neck!

TAYLOR

Bullshit.

BERLIN

Don't you know nothing about this

guy? He reads the newspapers. Col-

lects the cuttings. When are they

gonna find her? Now he's reading

Helena Robertson's name, phrased

like she's a fucking witness. You

couldn't have done anything more

stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..

TAYLOR

Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's

all line up and hear the expert.

BERLIN

Just walk away from me, Taylor ..

TAYLOR

You think you're the only guy

ever worked a homicide? I was

a big-city cop too. And I bust-

ed the clock on fucken Jennifer.

I know more about this man than

you'll over know - and that's

how I know it ain't him - you-

're investigating a soap-opera ..

ROSS

Alright, guys. We stop this now.

TAYLOR

He tells her, "bye-bye," and she

gets "attacked." Well, give me a

fucking break! There is no "Ser-

ial Killer." Stick her name up in

neon, there's still no Serial kil-

ler! And I ain't the only one say-

ing it. Everyone in this building

is saying it. And I mean everyone.

ROSS

Shut up, King Jay ..

TAYLOR

No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this

out & over. You know what everyone

thinks? They think you're making a

case coz you found yourself a nice

piece of ass. And no one's blaming

you for it, I hear she's worth the

flowers. But don't come in here get-

ting holy over us. Sure I put it in

the paper. Coz I wanted to stop this

bullshit. I don't want you drunk out-

ta your head searching my office ag-

ain. it's pissing me, & everyone off.

BERLIN

You don't know what you done, Taylor.

TAYLOR

If, your friend from San Diego was

up here, and thought for one out of

two fucken seconds, she was a danger

to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..

Why don't you get yourself a dict-

ionary? Look up the word "witness?"

BERLIN

I know what a "witness" is.

TAYLOR

Well, her, it ain't. That bitch

is blind as a blonde fucken bat.

BERLIN

I'm gonna do something you never

did, Taylor. I'm gonna catch this

bastard. And when I do, he's gon-

na find out just how good a "wit-

ness" she is .. Meanwhile, you be

aware of me - coz I wish you ill ..

BERLIN

Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear

right now. So save yourself saying it.

ROSS

I'm not in here to apologize, John.

I told you what was gonna happen &

it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess,"

& the same night she gets attacked?

That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?

BERLIN

I'm already familiar with Taylor's

opinion.

ROSS

You don't really believe this?

BERLIN

One hundred fucking per cent! ..

And you know why? Coz I never

told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that

good enough for the "committee?"

ROSS

Well .. I didn't know that ..

BERLIN

No .. You didn't know that ..

Here. You left your booze in here.

ROSS

Who d'you think it was?

You think it was him?

BERLIN

That's a very stupid question, Ross.

ROSS

I'm asking it.

BERLIN

How the hell do I know who? Some

jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.

.. but definitely not him. This

guy's in the trade. He's not gon-

na stand there looking at her ass,

if he's in the room, she's dead ..

ROSS

Ease off, John ..

BERLIN

I'm sick of this toy town shit.

ROSS

Everything you say sounds reason-

able. But there's also a reason-

able explanation for the opposite.

BERLIN

Don't give me that! Not another

word! When you had the Fat Lady

in there, and I asked you if she

was lying, you looked me right

in the eyes and said yes. So as

far as I was concerned, she's ly-

ing. And if the King of fucking

England had walked in & told me

different, I wouldn't have bel-

ieved him - because you told me ..

And now I'm telling you. I'm looking

you right in the eyes and telling ya,

there's a "bad man" out there, and I

don't know if he's in the next room,

or the next state: and I don't know

what his trigger is? But if he reads

her name in the newspaper, I believe

he'll be inclined to do something ab-

out it. I've got a bad feeling. And I

been doing this too long to be wrong.

ROSS

I dunno what I can do to help you?

BERLIN

I dunno what I'd do with your help.

I've gotta take her out of there ..

ROSS

What about Citrine?

BERLIN

Screw Citrine. He can fire me.

HELENA (Phone)

Mr Goodridge? ..  I can't find it ..

No .. there's no one here to read

it right now .. Well, yes, I know ..

of course I will ..  yes, promise ..

I'll get it and call you tomorrow ..

I feel really bad about it, coz

they invited me for Christmas ..

BERLIN

Has he got your aunt's address?

HELENA

I don't think so .. He said the

police had been calling .. want-

ed to ask me some more questions ..

BERLIN

Who?

(She doesn't know)

Probably Angelo .. I'll take

care of it .. Don't worry, we-

're gonna find this guy, and

everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?

BERLIN

You're looking worried again, Helena?

HELENA

No I'm not.

BERLIN

You're looking more worried now than

when you "decided to stop worrying"?

HELENA

Alright, I'm worried about Christmas.

I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..

BERLIN

He'll get over it. I'll roast

us a chicken, O.K.  With cand-

les around it. How about that?

HELENA

Wouldn't it be better if I cook

it? You said, you can only boil?

BERLIN

Can't thank you enough, Ross ..

ROSS

Don't thank me. Thank Margie.

It's her invitation. And as

far as Citrine in concerned,

better we keep it like that.

There's an old desperado in

one of the cells. Why don't

you give him this, and tell

him happy Christmas from me?

MARGIE

Not "you" blue. This isn't you.

HELENA

When did John divorce?

MARGIE

Two or three years ago.

HELENA

What was she like?

MARGIE

Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi-

professional model. But a policeman's

wife she wasn't. So one day, she just

packed it and left. And his whole life

went straight down the nearest toilet.

HELENA

What does that mean?

MARGIE

You know, he crashed. He just couldn't

come to terms with it .. John hates to

lose, and he hated losing her .. Every

spare minute, he's driving down to San

Diego, having a terrible time with her,

getting drunk, and driving back .. you

just don't believe the amount he drank ..

Wait a minute, I just had

the most brilliant idea ..

HELENA

You think he still loves her?

MARGIE

Think he still thinks about her. But

not like then. Then was an obsession.

Here .. try these .. if these

fit, we got the perfect dress ..

HELENA

I haven't worn heels since I was 16.

I don't think I could walk in these?

MARGIE

Sure you can. Anyway, parties

are all about standing still ..

I'll go get the dress .. It's kinda

sultry .. I only wore it once, coz

in reality, I can't get away with it ..

HELENA

You think John would like it?

MARGIE

I think John, would love it ...

ROSS

Let's do one of these right now,

then we'll hide the sonovabitch.

SERATO

Duty Sergeant fucked up .. can

you believe it, I'm on tonight ..

Did you get my message?

BERLIN

No.

SERATO

I left a message on your machine.

It wasn't me calling. Sam around?

ROSS

Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit-

chen .. We got a so-called prof-

essional cook out there having a

nervous breakdown over a turkey ..

BERLIN

Are you sure you didn't call?

SERATO

I spoke to old whass-his-name

a couple of times. But not to

her, and I never asked for her ..

ROSS

Her who?

BERLIN

Someone's calling the institute

to talk to Helena. Says he wants

to ask her some more questions ..

SERATO

Not guilty ..

BERLIN

You got a quiet phone somewhere?

ROSS

Hey, John, don't start getting

antsy over this tonight. It may

well have been the local cops?

BERLIN

That's just what I wanna find out.

MARGIE

How you doing on those shoes?

HELENA

Don't mix very well with beer.

MARGIE

Girl like you should be drinking

chill white wine. Press. All done.

BOBBY

That woman in the kitchen says

if she doesn't get help within

10 seconds, she's gonna resign.

MARGIE

That woman is a disaster ...

Alright, tell her I'm coming. No,

wait a minute, honey. Take Helena

for me, and find John? And don't

let go of her hand until you do ..

BOBBY

I'll just go see if he's in the

kitchen .. you stay right here ..

VENABLES

Hey, Popeye!

POPEYE

Hey, Fat Guy! Gimme 2 minutes. I'm

about to ask this lady for a dance?

If I told you I'd driven all the way

from Oakland would you dance with me?

What's so special about the other guy?

You like cops, don't you .. I'm a cop ..

.. let me ask you a question? How do

you know the difference between one

guy and another? .. Maybe you don't ..

Maybe you only know the "difference"

when you're dancing? (he laughs) If

you knew what I looked like, you'd

dance with me. I look like John Wayne ..

HELENA

I know what you look like. Excuse me.

FLESHY VOICE

Happy Christmas, Max ...

MAX

I normally get socks ...

MARGIE

She wants to go back

to the institute ..

You better go talk to her ..

ROSS

I know .. ain't it a shame ..

HELENA

I can't walk in these shoes ..

ROSS (O.S.)

You can't get in there ..

That's "Comanche Proof."

BERLIN

Jesus. What are you doin?

ROSS

I spose I'm drinking myself to

sleep. It's Helena's Christmas

songs .. they're really pretty ..

BERLIN

Have you got any Glasers?

(Ross does)

Twenty fives?

ROSS

What exactly you doing, John?

BERLIN

I'm going up to the institute.

ROSS

Now?

BERLIN

This "cop" that's calling, thinks

she gonna be there over Christmas.

I checked with the locals and our

station, no one's called. Whoever

it is, isn't the police.  I think

this bastard's getting worried ab-

out something? .. and I think the-

re's just a chance he'll turn up.

ROSS

Well, let's hope he does ..

And if he does, I'm gonna

drop a bomb on the fukker.

BERLIN

Listen, you don't havta come?

ROSS

Hey ..

Watch my lips. I'm your partner.

ROSS

Where's your watch?

BERLIN

I guess by the bed.

ROSS

It's twenty of three.

A little young for you, Bro?

(Gets his eyes)

You think if she could see,

she'd be hanging around with

an old dog like you? You got

a stomach growing around to

meet itself behind your back.

BERLIN

Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..

ROSS

Bits.

BERLIN

What d'you mean, "bits."

ROSS

Policemen's bodies age at diff-

erent rates. Look at me. Gut in

its fifties. Balls in their six-

ties. And feet in their eighties ..

BERLIN

Hit those wipers, Ross.

ROSS

What if we need a back up?

BERLIN

We're not here. I don't

want the desk to hear us ..

BERLIN

Alright. I'll start at

the top, and work down.

ROSS

You ain't going in alone?

BERLIN

That's a liability, Ross. I

don't want you hanging on to

my shirt. Anyone but me comes

down these stairs, take em out

but try and keep him alive. I

want this bastard living ..

ROSS [BERLIN]

[I'm on Helena's floor .. I'm

just gonna take a look at her

apartment .. You O.K.] Fucken

flashlight's kaput .. [Door's

locked .. shit] What's happen-

ing, Brother? [I can hear some-

thing? .. Something upstairs?]

[John? John? Are you al-

right? .. Come in, John?]

[You hear me? Just be care-

ful now, coz I'm coming up]

Is that you, John? .. Ans-

wer. NOW .. Or I blow this

fucken staircase to pieces.

BERLIN [?]

Me, Freddy.

ROSS

What the hell's going on up there,

Brother? I been calling 10 minutes.

Hey, c'mon, John .. Talk to me ...

Jesus Christ .. What are you doing?

What the fuck are you doing? - It's

me - Holy shit! - John - John - Not

you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard!

MYOPIC

Gimme the police. Quickly.

BERLIN

Where's Margie?

SERATO

Taken Bobby to her sister's ..

They were going there anyway.

BERLIN

Does he know?

SERATO

Thinks his dad's in hospital.

Why'd you go up there, John?

BERLIN

I want you to go to your Aunt's.

HELENA

Why can't I stay with you?

BERLIN

It's not possible right now.

HELENA

Why?

BERLIN

Please don't ask no quest-

ions now .. Not right now ..

HELENA

Is that Margie?

MARGIE

I'm here, honey. I'm right here.

Don't cry darlin .. he was a big

old cop and he didn't like tears ..

Feels like every second in my life,

was just the moment leading to this.

BERLIN

Margie ..

MARGIE

Don't.

Don't.

What's gonna happen now, John?

BERLIN

She has an aunt, in Vermont.

I'll take her there tonight.

HELENA

I'm going back to the institute.

BERLIN

No .. not now ..

MARGIE

Helena can stay here if she'd like

to .. I'd like her to .. I'll look

after her .. and she can look after

me .. I'm tired now .. I must sleep ..

(ROSS)

You want me to make a predict-

ion? This guy ain't turning up.

(BERLIN)

Maybe not .. What time is it?

(ROSS)

Twenty-six minutes past two ..

(BERLIN)

You shouldn't have come, Ross.

(ROSS)

Don't worry .. You take your

time .. I just wanna be back

in time for Bobby's presents ..

BERLIN

What are you doing, Travis?

TRAVIS

I been told to take your car in, Sir.

BERLIN

Why?

TRAVIS

I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

I'm sorry, Sergeant. I did knock a

couple times. Didn't get any reply.

BERLIN

You got a warrant for this?

TRAVIS

Yes, Sir.

BERLIN

Who sought the warrant?

TRAVIS

The man from the F.B.I.

BERLIN

I want a 24 hour protection

of Margie's house. Otherwise

I'm not saying nothing. You

give me that, or read me my

rights, and talk to a lawyer.

CITRINE

Alright, you got it. And I'll be

putting an Observer in with you.

BERLIN

I want Serato ..

(Negative)

Why can't I have Serato?

CITRINE

Coz I'm short of men & Ang-

elo won't do it .. Who ever

I got free first - you get ..

[Always figured I'd like to retire

to a little town like this - maybe

buy a boat even, do some fishing?]

St ANNE

You fish, John?

BERLIN

I have done ..

St ANNE

Alright, let's not beat about the

bush, what ever that may mean, and

get down on it. You were specific-

ally instructed by your chief, not

to go anywhere near the blind inst-

itute? So why did you go up there?

BERLIN

Because of a feeling. I had a bad

feeling this man was gonna turn up.

St ANNE

Which man is that?

BERLIN

The man I detail in my report, Sir.

Is this an interview, or an

interrogation?

St ANNE

It's an enquiry ...

BERLIN

I'm not prepared to be interrog-

ated. I'll be interviewed as an

officer, who may be expected to

cooperate with the investigator.

St ANNE

Well, that's fine by me, John. And

I'm sure that's fine by your Chief.

So you thought your man might show?

BERLIN

Yes.

St ANNE

Bit of a long-shot, wasn't it?

BERLIN

It was the only shot I had ..

St ANNE

So the one night you decide to

go up there, he goes up there?

BERLIN

That's right. Except I'd decid-

ed to go up there every night ..

St ANNE

Despite the wishes of your Chief?

BERLIN

Yes.

St ANNE

You were prepared to fal-

sify your reports to him?

BERLIN

I had very good reasons for do....

St ANNE

Just a second, John. I knew

there was something missing.

You don't mind if I jump around a

little this morning, do you? Just

while I'm easing my way into this?

BERLIN

You're asking the questions, Sir ..

St ANNE

You had an argument with Ross? Ass-

aulted one of the officers, right?

BERLIN

I wouldn't use the word "assault."

St ANNE

You got a "racy temper," Sergeant?

BERLIN

Not especially.

St ANNE

Just something they did, on this

occasion, made you lose your rag?

BERLIN

Not they. He. Taylor put a piece

in the newspaper, which in my op-

inion put my witness in jeopardy.

St ANNE

From whom?

BERLIN

From the man I detail in my rep-

ort. A crazy man, who to my cert-

ain knowledge has killed at least

eight girls. Six in San Diego, one

someplace else, and one up here ..

St ANNE

Not a lotta support for that

"scenario" though, is there?

BERLIN

Not a lot.

St ANNE

Not even from Ross?

BERLIN

No.

St ANNE

Is that why you lost your temper with

him? Frustration? No one believing you?

So what can you tell me about you man?

BERLIN

What do you mean, Sir?

St ANNE

I mean, who is he?

BERLIN

I don't know who he is. Who's

"Jack The Ripper?" He's Jack

The Ripper with an automobile.

St ANNE

You didn't run a profile?

BERLIN

No, Sir .. I didn't have the res-

ources, and it isn't my expertise.

St ANNE

This crazy man? What makes you think

he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson?

BERLIN

You read my report, Sir.

St ANNE

I'm asking a question ..

BERLIN

Because he reads I'm investigating

the disappearance of her friend, &

Miss Robertson becomes the focus of

his anxiety. How good of a "witness"

is she? He's crazy, but not stupid,

he's intelligent. Got a flexible M.

O., and he doesn't wanna get caught.

St ANNE

Just like "Jack The Ripper?"

Alright, we'll have plenty of time

to discuss your "Mystery Man," and

his "flexibility" later, Right now,

I'd like to talk about the "event."

St ANNE [BERLIN]

Alright, the door comes back and

hits you? Knocks you down? Knocks

you out? For how long? [I don't

know] Approximately, you figure?

A minute? [O.K.] O.K. then what

happened? Immediately you get up?

BERLIN

I realized the flashlight was

at the bottom of the stairs

St ANNE

Did you check your weapon?

BERLIN

Maybe. It would have been

instinctive. All I know was

I was in possession of it ..

St ANNE

You didn't check it?

BERLIN

Not that I specifically remember.

St ANNE

Why not?

BERLIN

I don't know. I wasn't think-

ing about it .. I was dazed ..

St ANNE

You were woozy? Confused?

BERLIN

I was unconscious 10 seconds ago.

St ANNE

I understand. Then?

BERLIN

Then I picked up the flashlight,

tried to get Ross on the radio ..

Nothing. Static. I got blood on

my hand, realized my eye was cut.

St ANNE

Could you see out of it?

BERLIN

Yeah, I could see. Then I ran.

Climbed out of the window, ran

down the fire escape, and right

at the bottom, I found Ross ..

St ANNE

Were you breathless?

BERLIN

Sure I was breathless ...

St ANNE

When did you realize you were no

longer in possession of the .25?

BERLIN

Not until I was in the hospital.

St ANNE

You figure you lost it in the

hospital? Or on the way there?

BERLIN

No, I thought it must have

fallen down the stairwell.

St ANNE [BERLIN]

Like the flashlight? [Yeah] Had

you been drinking that night?

BERLIN

It was Christmas Eve.

St ANNE

That wasn't my question?

BERLIN

Yes.

St ANNE [BERLIN]

How about Ross? [Sure] Were

you drinking in the car? [?]

There was a bottle in the car?

BERLIN

I think Ross had a mouthful?

St ANNE

But not you?

BERLIN

I may have had a nip?

St ANNE

To keep out the cold? .. Very cold

that night, very windy, wasn't it?

Which hand was the flashlight in?

BERLIN

My left hand.

St ANNE

And the Walther was in your right?

BERLIN

The Beretta was in my right hand ..

St ANNE

You said you didn't check it? So how

d'you know which gun you're holding?

You said you figured it had fallen

down the stairs with the flashlight?

You said you were confused? You pick

up the flashlight in confusion, how

d'you know you didn't pick up the 25?

BERLIN

Let's not start playing games, Mr St Anne.

St ANNE

Games?

BERLIN

I told you, I'd lost the Walther ..

St ANNE

You told me you didn't know you'd

lost it until you were in the hos-

pital? So, if you didn't know till

then, it coulda been either weapon?

BERLIN

The gun in my hand was a Beretta.

And for the record, I want that

note corrected. Now, please, Sir.

St ANNE

O.K. I'm corrected. I'm

sorry, I made a mistake.

BERLIN

With respect, Sir, you didn't make

a mistake. I know who you are, and

you're far too experienced for mis-

takes. Now if you have doubts over

the content, or veracity of my rep-

ort, I wanna be made aware of them?

St ANNE

Sure.

BERLIN

I wanna be made aware of them now.

St ANNE

Do you want a lawyer, Sergeant?

BERLIN

There you go again? "Do I want

a lawyer, Sergeant?" It's a game

question. What do I want a law-

yer for? I got nothing to hide ..

St ANNE

You don't?

BERLIN

You know I don't. So let's quit

the bullshit and get down to it.

What's your "angle," Mr St Anne?

St ANNE

Where's the little gun, Sergeant?

BERLIN

I've no idea.

St ANNE

You don't?

BERLIN

If it isn't in the institute,

the man who shot Ross took it.

St ANNE

The man who shot Ross, used it ..

And you don't know where that little

twenty-five calibre Walther's gone?

O.K. Sergeant, here it is. I intend to

produce evidence, that will prove you

shot Frederick Ross with malice afore-

thought. My angle therefore, is to pre-

pare a case on behalf of your Chief, to

prosecute you for first degree murder.

St ANNE

You go home, John, get some sleep.

I don't wanna talk any more today.

BERLIN

Aren't you gonna arrest me?

St ANNE

You know better than that ...

I arrest you, you'll get bail, and

be walking outta here anyway - and

I'll have no one to talk to - Your

Chief said he'd make you available

to me. If you go to the store, call

in, and let your duty officer know.

MARGIE

Your Daddy would have wanted

you to be strong .. We gotta

be strong for Daddy, darling ..

BOBBY

I don't want her in this house ..

I want my Dad. Why did she have

to come here .. I want my Daddy ..

St ANNE

.. there was a gale that night .. all

the doors are swinging .. so this door

swings back and clips you .. and down

you go .. within 35 seconds of uncon-

sciousness, you're back on the fire es-

cape, and you're confused, really con-

fused .. you don't know if Tuesdays

come in two's or happen once a week ..

You see a figure coming up the stairs.

Ross ain't meant to be on the stairs?

He challenges you .. and this ain't a

piece of wood with a nail through it ..

this guy's got a 12 gauge Winchester

up your nose .. and he's drunk .. and

you're dizzy .. and your eye's fulla

blood .. you ain't thinking good, and

you're seeing worse .. Wow! .. it just

went off! .. You just put him down? ..

and you get hit by a Glaser, you stay

down .. But he ain't dead .. Now, you

realize you shot your partner .. "Oh,

Suzanna, how do I get outta this?" I

know .. The "Serial Killer" shot him ..

And here comes the malice, John .. 17

seconds later, you put another one in

his throat .. Isn't that what happened?

BERLIN

No.

St ANNE

Tell us what happened, then?

BERLIN

I already told you what happened ..

You're looking for an inconsisten-

cy, and you're not gonna find one,

because I'm telling you the truth.

St ANNE

Tell me the truth again.

St ANNE

You have? .. How about the booze? ..

Too much booze can be very dangerous ..

memory black outs .. stuff like that ..

"The Man Takes a Drink, Then the Drink

Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes

the Man?" .. Something like that, isn't

it? .. Anyway .. why did you give up?

BERLIN

I guess I was drinking too much.

St ANNE

I was talking about "cigarettes?"

(Score: 10 outta 10)

Find yourself getting breathless?

BERLIN

Sure.

St ANNE

Specially if you're running? Which

floor did the elevator run up to?

BERLIN

Five.

St ANNE

You ran up to the fifth? You must

have been real breathless by then?

We're gonna get our "observer" in

here this afternoon. Keep an eye

on us? (He smiles) Notorious for

withholding information, the F.B.I.

Were you aware there was a janit-

or in the institute that night?

BERLIN

No.

St ANNE

You didn't check?

BERLIN

There wasn't time ...

St ANNE

That wasn't my question?

BERLIN

No, Sir, I didn't check.

St ANNE

I'm really catching cold up

here? Must be all this fog?

BERLIN

What's the relevance of the janitor?

St ANNE

The janitor? Let me just ask you

a question - before I forget - do

you take any medication for that?

BERLIN

For what?

St ANNE

Breathlessness?

BERLIN

No.

St ANNE

Alright, let me answer your question?

"What's the relevance of the janitor?"

Why don't I take you through it, from

where I'm sitting .. At some time bet-

ween 2 & 2:30 a.m. the janitor thought

he heard a vehicle approaching through

the woods. He looks out, and sees noth-

ing, no lights, nothing. Figures it must

be hunters. Some time later, he thought

he heard something else, like a door, or

a window slam? He gets up, and between

half past two and a quarter of three, he

makes a search - with a flashlight - of

the top 3 floors. Finds nothing untoward,

& goes back to his apartment in the roof.

The flashlight you saw, was his. The

"footsteps" you heard, were his. The

elevator you were chasing up and down

after was empty, and is prone to such

activity, due to an electrical fault ..

Apparently it happens frequently dur-

ing gales. The gale that was swinging

the door. That knocked you down. That

confused you so much? And here we are,

back to where I'm sitting. You wanna

tell me what really went on that night?

BERLIN

Two people know I didn't kill

him, Mr St Anne. One's me, and

the other's the man that did.

St ANNE

What man?

We just dealt with "the man?"

BERLIN

How d'you know the Jan-

itor didn't shoot him?

You're telling me it's his

flashlight I saw, O.K., he

sees my flashlight? And I'm

coming up the stairs with a

Beretta in my hand. And he's

frightened. He hits the door

on me. Picks up my gun. He's

running. He runs into Ross,

and in panic, he shoots him.

St ANNE

Not unless he had a gun in one

hand, and a phone in the other,

he didn't. Ross was shot at ex-

actly two fifty-seven a.m. The

janitor put a call through to

the local police, at 2:57 a.m.

You obviously realize how I can

get so accurate with my timing?

Ross switched into channel 8, &

we got a recording of the whole

incident. I was gonna play it to

you, but I got a meeting, we'll

have to do it after lunch. It's

one, let's make it back by three?

INTRUDER

Got really fucken lucky, didn't ya?

I was getting kinda concerned about

you Jenny. Like, how blind are you?

Blind as your friend? Or less blind?

Coz she could see, you know. Had a

view outta one of em. But you don't

see nothing do you? Nothing at all?

Can you see this, blind girl?

Gimme your hand.

Gimme your fucken hand.

You like it?

I cut your friend's

head off with that ..

You say something, Jenny?

I'd like to cut you. I'd like to

cut you so bad .. But ain't life

strange? You're my little buddy

now .. I guess we all got lucky?

SERATO

She's in love with him,

Chief, and try anything?

CITRINE

Are you going up there?

SERATO

No, I just sent Travis.

I've got a call to make.

CITRINE

What about the man? .. Has he

seen this? .. [No he hasn't] ..

Alright, make your call, and

get up there ... Bullshit or

not, I wanna proper statement ..

ASSISTANT

No, Sir, they just got back.

CITRINE

Would you ask Mr St Anne

to come in here a moment?

BISLEY

I hear I've been nominated

as an official "observer?"

CITRINE

It's either you, or Taylor?

BISLEY

He don't wanna do it either.

CITRINE

I'll toss a coin for you. But

one of you is going in today ..

What do you wanna do with it?

St ANNE

Let him have it .. I don't

mind putting a little salt

at the edge of his plate ..

BERLIN

I need a friend, Angelo.

SERATO

You got one.

She's a bad witness, John.

But a fucking lousy alibi.

BERLIN (O.S.)

.. I know why you did it darlin,

but you're not helping me. Every-

thing they're hearing they think

is a lie. Now here comes the man

I'm desperate to prove exists, &

whadda-ya-know, he turns up at my

house, and has a "chat" with you?

No one in the State of California

is gonna believe that. They got the

man in there - an A/1 F.B.I. inter-

rogator, and he's taking me to pie-

ces - doesn't believe a word comes

outta my head - not a word - no one

believes me - I don't believe me ..

HELENA

Don't say that. Don't you dare

say that .. I believe you  ..

BERLIN

I know you're trying to help

me, but you don't understand.

HELENA

Then explain it to me. I got

enough darkness, don't I?

BERLIN

The man who killed Amber is a

psychopath. He was up at the in-

stitute to kill you - he don't

wanna kill Rose - he was there

to kill you - that's the truth -

and I didn't wanna tell it to

you - but that's the reason I

want you to stay at Margie's -

coz I can't protect you here ..

HELENA

Why does he want to kill me?

BERLIN

Coz he thinks you're a witness.

HELENA

I can't identify him ..

BERLIN

He don't know that. I didn't.

HELENA

Then why didn't he kill me?

Why didn't he kill me, John?

BERLIN

Will you fucken stop it. I'm not

Serato .. He didn't kill you coz

he wasn't here .. he isn't in the

room with you, and lets you live ..

HELENA

Kiss me, John .. Kiss me [he does]

I love you, kiss me again [he does]

I love you .. Are my lips lying to

you? Kiss my mouth [he does] Is my

mouth lying to you?  He. Was. Here.

HELENA (O.S.)

I just remembered something ..

He used a breath freshener.

BERLIN

A "breath freshener?"

HELENA

I heard it hiss, twice.

BERLIN

... he's either here to take

something .. or leave some-

thing .. I don't find nothing ..

HELENA

You gotta stop drinking, darling.

He's glad you're drinking. Every

drink you take you're helping him.

BERLIN

He doesn't need my help.

HELENA

I know about alcohol, John.

BERLIN

You do?

HELENA

I'm blind because my father drank.

I lost everyone I ever loved .. I

lost my hopes .. my future .. I'm

in love with you, John .. I don't

want them to take you away from me ..

St ANNE

He humiliated you. In front of every

one .. In front of a bunch of secret-

aries? .. Well, that would piss any-

one off? ... That would piss me off ..

I'd be real mad if a guy did that to

me, & called himself a friend .. Coz

that ain't a friendly thing to do? ..

You side with "friends" .. You don't

go bitchin on them behind their back?

He wasn't much of a "friend" at all?

BERLIN

Ross was my best friend.

St ANNE

Did you shoot your "best friend?"

BERLIN

No.

St ANNE

The next time I ask you that quest-

ion, you're gonna tell me the truth.

[TAPE]

.. "Just be careful now, coz I'm coming

up." .. [Footsteps on cast iron stairs]

"Is that you, John? .. Answer .. Now ..

or I blow this fucken staircase to pie-

ces." [Sound of someone breathing hard]

"Me, Freddy." .. [Just the gale] "What

the hell's going on up there, Brother?

I been calling ton minutes." .. [Lungs

heave for air) "Hey, c'mon, John, talk

to me?" [Just the sound of breathless-

ness] "Jesus Christ .. What are you do-

ing? What the fuck are you doing? It's

me - Holy shit - John - John - Not you -

Don't shoot you crazy bastard! [2 shots]

St ANNE

That's second degree - you wanna stop

at that? Will you give me that, John?

TAYLOR

He's offerin you a deal?

Why don't you take it ..

BERLIN

He ain't offerin me shit.

You're letting it show, King Jay.

TAYLOR

I don't like you. But don't kid

yourself .. I don't take no ple-

asure sitting in on another cop ..

Your an alcoholic, aren't you?

(BERLIN stares)

It's written in your file ..

They want you to look in the mirror.

MYOPIC

Well .. I dunno .. it could be?

St ANNE

Alright, thank you, Mr Dawson ..

CITRINE

What's all this "deal" business?

St ANNE

I can have him out of here on a sec-

ond degree this afternoon. I own him,

and he knows it. And, Chief, I'm still

waiting for that warrant on his house?

BERLIN

You don't wanna sit here

any more, sweetheart ..

HELENA

I wanna be near you ...

BERLIN

I think they're gonna arrest me.

HELENA

I don't want them to arrest you.

BERLIN

It's not as bad as it sounds ..

They can't refuse me bail. Raise

bail of my own cognizance & find

the best damned lawyer there is ..

HELENA

Oh, John, I'd do anything,

anything, to get you free.

St ANNE

.. and that one's with malice ..

that one's first degree .. why

don't you stop lying to me?

(Clicks Sony off)

C'mon, John, I can help you? Why

don't you tell me the truth?

BERLIN

I've told you the truth. It

isn't me .. I've never call-

ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..

TAYLOR

I've heard you call him Freddy.

BERLIN

You haven't. And you got no voice

in here, Taylor, so keep it shut.

St ANNE

Tell a lotta lies, don't you? Some-

thing that comes naturally to you?

BERLIN

I don't lie.

St ANNE

Prepared to lie to your Chief?

BERLIN

Under exceptional circumstances.

St ANNE

What were the circumstances that

caused you to lie to Freddy Ross?

BERLIN

I never lied to Ross ..

St ANNE

You didn't?

Well, he thought you did? .. Wrote

it down in his book? "John Berlin

is a liar." Right here, underlined.

Dated the day you got your first

"break" with your "Mystery Man?"

You don't know why he wrote that?

(He doesn't)

Maybe he thought there was no "Myst-

ery Man?" That the investigation was

bullshit? That you were making it up?

Coz you wanted to be "Top Cop?" Isn't

that why you went running up that gar-

bage dump, so everyone could stand in

awe of the "Top Cop?" Isn't that why

you came up here? Coz you couldn't make

it in L.A.? Get yourself a pissy lit-

tle degree, come up here, and be "Top

Guy?" But Ross was "Top Guy", wasn't he?

Always would be Top Guy? And you know

what? He did it without even trying ..

Everybody loved him. He had everything

you wanted, didn't he? - Great woman -

Great kid? - Everything you couldn't

have? - And you wanted it to go away?

Coz your life was lousy, wasn't it? -

A lousy life, with a lousy wife, who

was fucking everyone, wasn't she? Is

that why you pick on a little Blind

Girl? - coz you can control her? - Is

that it? - Control who she's fucking?

You wanna lose your temper with me?

C'mon, John, lose your fucken temper?

You're good at losing your temper?..

BERLIN

No way, Mr St Anne.

St ANNE

Lost your temper with Ross, didn't

you? C'mon, tell me the truth. Is

that what happened? You had an arg-

ument in the car? Lost your temper

with him? Stood over him, blew his

fucking larynx out with a Glaser? -

Where were you aiming, John? Going

for his face? Blow his fucking face

away, because you hated him so much.

BERLIN

I loved that guy .. & the hard-

est thing to take in here .. is

knowing he thought I killed him ..

St ANNE

Well, that he did .. And

that do I, Sergeant Berlin ..

What do you take for that

breathlessness, Sergeant?

How about Aminophylline?

BERLIN

I don't know what that is.

St ANNE

You don't? It's ant anti-asthma medic-

ation, prescribed for breathlessness?

Came out of the ashtray of your car?

But you "don't know" what it is?

You don't know how it got there?

You don't use it for breathlessness?

I'm running outta questions, John, and

you're running out of lies? I'm offer-

ing you one last chance, and you better

take it, or the U.S. Attorney is gonna

put you in the God-damned gas chamber ..

BERLIN

I need .. some time .. to think Sir ..

St ANNE

Alright. Think about it. But don't

you make a fool of me. You come in

here with one more lie, and I bull-

shit you not, I'm gonna press for

the maximum penalty there is. And

that's the death penalty, Sergeant.

BERLIN

We got a break - isn't much, but it's

a break .. the man that murdered Ross

gets asthma - it's not a breath fresh-

ner, darling - it's an asthma inhaler ..

BERLIN

This capsule came out of a V.W. van -

I didn't even think about it - stuck

it in the ashtray - if I'd been smok-

ing, ita been thrown away weeks ago ..

(Phone)

No, Amanda - it's definitely Amanda ..

I had the van - this guy drove that

van takes his medication and loses

one .. (Phone) - Dan - Hearing - Are

you sure? - Would you try Frisco for

me? - I'll try and get a second name ..

No Amanda with a white Volkswagen ..

You don't have a Yellow Pages for

Oakland, do you? (She don't) I got-

ta get down there, find that store ..

BERLIN

You be careful .. This man's close ..

MARGIE

If you find him, John. I want you

to call me. I wanna know his name.

BERLIN (Phone)

She's not there? - Let me just make

sure I got the right Amanda - lotta

freckles, right? .. Right .. That's

right, that's her .. Well, eh, what

time d'you expect her? .. O.K. I'll

eh, try and pop over this afternoon.

BERLIN

I'm sorry to trouble you, but eh ..

Wait a minute, don't I know you?

You're Amanda? Remember, you near-

ly ran into me? Way up in Trinity?

AMANDA

As I said, Sergeant, you nearly

ran into me? What's the problem?

BERLIN

I'm afraid it's the "van" again.

AMANDA

The van?

BERLIN

Is it your vehicle?

AMANDA

No, my mother's .. You better stop

in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.

BERLIN

I'm sorry to worry you with this, but

we had a real serious robbery, and we-

're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy

came up an the computer, so as a matt-

er of routine we have to check. Could

you tell me who's driven it recently?

AMANDA

Only me and Mom ..

BERLIN

How about any guys on your staff?

AMANDA

We only got one .. He doesn't drive.

BERLIN [AMANDA]

Would he have lent it to anyone? [No]

How bout your Dad? Husband? Boyfriend?

AMANDA

He is my boyfriend. My fath-

er's dead, and I'm divorced.

BERLIN

I see ...

Would you mind if I took a look at it?

AMANDA

I thought this was "routine?"

The only man that has driven it in

the last 6 months is my uncle. And

no way is he involved in a robbery.

BERLIN

Could I have his name? Just so

I can officially eliminate him?

AMANDA

Could I see your badge again?

Then you better go and get it. I

feel uncomfortable without an I.D.

TAYLOR

We're not gonna find nothin here.

MALE REPORTER

Detectives spent several hours this

morning at Sergeant Berlin's home ..

various property was removed for ex-

amination. Later in the morning, May-

or Heineman arrived for a meeting with

police officers from Shasta Valley ..

HEINEMAN (T.V.)

Jim unable to say anything right now,

except, this is a very sad and tragic

day. John Berlin lied to us all. Lied

to me, and much worse, lied to every

man, woman, & child in this community ..

WOMAN REPORTER (T.V.)

Where was Mr Berlin arrested, Sir?

HEINEMAN (T.V.)

Near the Ross residence .. six a.m. ..

MALE REPORTER (T.V.)

Who made the arrest?

HEINEMAN (T.V.)

Sergeant John Taylor. Assist-

ed by Sergeant Angelo Serato ..

You'll have to put that question

to the Chief. I've nothing to add.

BERLIN

I'll sign anything you want. Please.

Bring here her .. I want Helena here ..

CITRINE

You ain't talking to no

one, till you calm down.

BERLIN

I am calm .. I am calm ..

Get St Anne .. I want St Anne ..

MARGIE

Jesus. What are you doing here?

TAYLOR

Been trying to call, your line's

down .. I just wanna let you know

we're taking the guard off today.

Is she going somewhere?

MARGIE

I'm taking her back to the Instit-

ute. Her new term starts tomorrow.

TAYLOR

Not gonna try and bail him are you?

I really wouldn't bother, Margie ..

You want me to drive her? ..

I'm through with my shift ..

MARGIE

No .. I'll drive her ..

BERLIN

I'll sign anything you like - you

write it, I'll sign it. But I want

her and Margie here. I want an opp-

ortunity to talk to them - that's

all I'm asking? - That's my deal? ..

St ANNE

O.K. I'll put it to your Chief?

BERLIN

Well, you'd better put it to him

pretty dammed quick, Mr St Anne,

because if you don't, she's dead.

St ANNE

Didn't push her down stairs on

their previous meeting, did he?

BERLIN

He was up there to plant the gun.

St ANNE

Did Taylor plant this, too?

Is it yours?

We found "Jennifer Eight." At least,

we've found a headless and handless

girl. A couple of hunters found her.

About 4 miles south of the institute,

less than 50 feet from the road. This

was less than 100 feet from the body.

Is it yours? - (no answer) - I know

it's yours? - You know it's yours?

The only prints on it are Freddy's?

You wanna tell me how it got there?

TRAVIS

Margie Ross put up your bond, Sir.

BERLIN

Are you getting in the way of it?

St ANNE

I don't make the law.

BOBBY

There's no one here.

BERLIN

Where are they?

BOBBY

Mom took her back to the institute.

I dunno. How come they let you out?

BERLIN

Is Margie with her? Is she with her?

BOBBY

No, she came back and went out ag-

ain .. gone to see Auntie Charles ..

They're my Dad's guns.

BERLIN

Come on, Bobby, for God's sake. I

wanna get the man that killed him.

BOBBY

I hate you .. I really hate you ..

BERLIN (V.O.)

Go take a look in his office. It's

fulla rattan - that's the connect-

ion, that's the "link" - that's why

they never got an I.D. - He kills

blind girls - put their picture in

the newspaper, and 99 percent of

the people who know them are blind ..

St ANNE (V.O.)

Havta be a real dope to kill her

now, wouldn't he? I mean, we're

talking real, full-blown, insane?

BERLIN (V.O.)

He is insane. His fucken brain's

upside down. But he's also very

cunning. He's not going after her

with a "Pearl Handled Colt," he-

'll just push her down the stairs ..

TAYLOR

Say night, night, dead girl.
