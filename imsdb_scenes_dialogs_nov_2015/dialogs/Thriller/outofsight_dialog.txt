LOOKING FOR MONEY?

YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

TELLER/LORETTA

How can I help you, sir?

FOLEY

Loretta, you see that guy talking to

your manager, has his case open?

LORETTA

That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant

managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,

but he's not in today.

FOLEY

But you see the guy with the attache

case?

LORETTA

(looks again)

Yes.

FOLEY

That's my partner.  He has a gun in

there.  And if you don't do exactly

what I tell you, or you give me any

kind of a problem, I'll look over at

my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.

Guindon between the eyes.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Now take one of those big envelopes

and put as many hundreds, fifties and

twenties as you can pack into it.

Nothing with bank straps or rubber

bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I

don't want any bait money.  Start with

the second drawer and then the one

over there, under the computer.  Come

on, Loretta, the key's right there

next to you.  No bills off the bottom

of the drawer.

(as she works)

First time being robbed?

(she nods)

You're doing great.  Just smile,

Loretta, so you won't look like you're

being held up.

(she smiles awkwardly)

That's the way, you're doing fine.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put

'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had

to give my partner a sign; that's good.

Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds

till after I'm out the door, make sure

you haven't set off the alarm.  If you

have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon

between the eyes.  Okay?  I think

that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,

and have a nice day.

LORETTA

You, too.

FOLEY

She's cute, isn't she?

MAN

Uh, yeah, I guess so.

MAN (CONT'D)

(to Mr. Guindon)

Who was that?

FOLEY

Come on...

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Fuck!

COP

I think you flooded it.

SECOND COP

Get out've the car, sir.

FOLEY

Wanna hear a funny story?

SECOND COP

Shut up and get out've the car.

"GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,

PUP

You want something, Foley?

FOLEY

Some people are going out of here.

What if I told you where and when?

PUP

How many?

FOLEY

I expect you to look out for me, Pup,

let me run off work details.

PUP

Okay.  How many going out?

FOLEY

I hear six.

PUP

When?

FOLEY

Looks like tonight.

PUP

You know who they are?

FOLEY

I do, but I won't tell you just yet.

Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,

right before lock-down.

FOLEY (OS)

Today's the day, huh?

FOLEY

You excited?

CHINO

I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

FOLEY

Yeah, but I see you moved it up.

CHINO

(beat)

Why you think is today?

FOLEY

You were out running this morning,

sticking to your routine, anybody

happened to notice.  But you only did

a couple of miles instead of your usual

five.  Saving yourself for the main

event.  Then I see you inside eating

ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates

for endurance.

CHINO

You want, I tole you you can come.

You all right, Foley.  I like you.

FOLEY

You told me I can come 'cause I caught

you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you

and Lulu coming out of the bushes,

thought maybe you two were making out.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

So what, you finish ahead of schedule?

CHINO

You see what they doing, those posts

out there?  Putting up another fence,

five metres on the other side of the

one that's there.  We wait until Super

Bowl Sunday, they could have the second

fence built and we have to dig another

nine, ten days.  So we going soon as

it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --

you can still come.

FOLEY

I appreciate the offer.  And it's

tempting.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

But, man, it's a long run to

civilization.  A hundred miles to Miami?

I'm too old to start acting crazy, try

a stunt like that.  You make it out,

send me a postcard.

ADELE

Hello?

(then, sighs)

Yeah, I accept.

FOLEY'S VOICE

Hey, Adele, how you doing?

ADELE

Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?

Next time, leave the engine running.

FOLEY

That's funny, Adele.  How many more

times you gonna gimme that one?

ADELE

Till it's not funny any more.  What do

you want, Jack?

FOLEY

You know that Super Bowl party?  They

changed the date.  It's on

tonight

,

eight-thirty.

ADELE

Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't

monitored?

FOLEY

I said not as a rule.

ADELE

So why don't you come right out and

tell me what you're talking about?

FOLEY

Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there

in the free world.

ADELE

What's free about it?  I'm looking for

work.

FOLEY

What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

ADELE

Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired

me and hired another girl, a redhead.

I'm working on a new business card,

pass out to the cafes.  How's this

sound--

FOLEY

(cuts her off)

Listen, Adele, the reason I called,

that party is today instead of Sunday.

About eight-thirty, like only a few

hours from now.  So you'll have to get

hold of Buddy, whatever he might be

doing...

ADELE

And the one driving the other car?

FOLEY

What're you talking about?

ADELE

Well, seeing as you have so much luck

with cars, Buddy thought it might be

better to bring two.  He got this guy

he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn

something.

FOLEY

Glenn Michaels.

ADELE

Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn

thinks you guys are real cool.

FOLEY

He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see

Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step

on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off

first.

MARSHALL

Happy birthday.

KAREN

You fit another Chanel suit in here?

MARSHALL

Something better.  Open it.

KAREN

(opens the box)

Oh my God...

KAREN (CONT'D)

It's beautiful.

MARSHALL

It's a --

KAREN

--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Thanks, Dad.

MARSHALL

Happy birthday, kid.

(then)

You want another Coke?

KAREN

(checks her watch)

Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades,

then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

MARSHALL

Which one is that?  The ATF guy?

KAREN

He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now,

he switched over.

MARSHALL

He's still married though, huh?

KAREN

Technically.  They're separated.

MARSHALL

Oh, he's moved out?

KAREN

He's about to.

MARSHALL

Then they're not separated, are they?

KAREN

Can we change the subject?

MARSHALL

What're you doing at Glades?

KAREN

Serving process, a Summons and

Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory

life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

He files suit, says he has no choice

in what they serve and it violates his

civil rights.

MARSHALL

You know you can always step in, work

with me full-time as one of my

investigators.

KAREN

No thanks.

MARSHALL

You used to like it.

KAREN

Dad...

MARSHALL

You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing

wrong with them necessarily if they're

divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy

cop who drinks too much and cheats on

his wife?  That's the way those hotshots

are, all of 'em.

KAREN

I really gotta go.

MARSHALL

We don't get to talk much any more.

KAREN

How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch

the Super Bowl with you?

MARSHALL

I'd like that.

KAREN

Thanks for the gun, Dad.

LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.  LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.

TWO YEARS AGO

.

BUDDY

Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's

gonna send this guy out in a body bag.

FOLEY

Anyone ever tell you why they call him

Snoopy?

FOLEY (CONT'D)

He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back

when he was pro.  Now you pet him, he

goes down.

BUDDY

I don't believe it.

BUDDY

Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.

Fuckin' pathetic.

FOLEY

It's Richard Ripley.

BUDDY

(looking now)

The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I

didn't recognize him without his rug.

FOLEY

Dick the Ripper they called him, on

account of all the people he ripped

off.

BUDDY

What's he doin' here?

GLENN (OS)

Three years.

GLENN

He got three years and fined fifty

million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking

check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed

his name.

(struggles with the

bar)

Whoa-- little help here!

FOLEY

Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or

Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those

shades on.

GLENN

You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

FOLEY

I guess the bright glare out here made

it hard to see the numbers on the

weights.

GLENN

I'll take the shades off.  Just get

this fuckin' thing off me.

BUDDY

How do you know he wrote a check?

GLENN

He told me.  He works the laundry with

me.  The guy loves to talk.

FOLEY

Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.  I hear he

rolled over on all the snitches he was

doing business with and got 'em all

brought up.

GLENN

Hey, anybody that can write a check

for fifty mil, he says

any

thing I'm

all fucking ears.  Like the other day,

he tells me how he's got all this money

in foreign banks, plus around five mil

in uncut diamonds at his house.  He

said, quote, "Where I can put my hands

on it anytime."

BUDDY

Cool.  Where's the guy live?

GLENN

Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut

diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

FOLEY

Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?

They look like plain old rocks.

GLENN

So.  What's your point?

FOLEY

My point is, that's probably what you're

gonna end up with.

GLENN

You think he's lying?

FOLEY

Use your head.  The guys got five

million lying around his house, you

really think he's gonna tell some

motormouth he just met in prison about

it?

BUDDY

(watching Snoopy)

Here it comes.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,

even if it's on purpose.

FOLEY

You don't wanna be standing there, the

hacks start asking questions you don't

wanna answer.

RIPLEY

Oh, uh, right, thanks...

DISSOLVE TO:

BUDDY

Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

WOMAN

I didn't ask for your help, so don't

expect a tip.

BUDDY

That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take

your car.

FOLEY

They're right underneath you, Pup.

They dug a tunnel.

PUP

I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel

come out?

FOLEY

Second fence post from the tower out

there.  Go on, take a look.

PUP

I don't see nothing there.

FOLEY

You will directly.  Keep watching.

KAREN

Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.

(beat)

He's not?  Could you tell him that...

never mind.  I'll call back.

PUP

There some car headlights out there...

(then)

Jesus Christ...

PUP (CONT'D)

Man outside the fence!  By tower six!

(responds to radio)

This is Officer Pupko...

(then)

I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!

coming out of the ground

.  On

this

side of the fence.

BUDDY

What's she doing?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Uh-oh.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Uh

-

oh

.

KAREN

Get your hands in the air!

BUDDY

It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

KAREN

What're you doing here?

FOLEY

I bet that's all the hacks they send

out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind

the store.

BUDDY

Why don't we talk about it later?

FOLEY

Why you're just a girl.  What do you

do for a living you pack a shotgun?

KAREN

I'm a federal marshal and you're under

arrest, both of you guys.

FOLEY

I bet I smell, don't I?

(then)

Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll

get out of here.

FOLEY (VO)

You comfy?

KAREN (VO)

If I could have a little more room.

FOLEY (VO)

There isn't any.  All this shit you

got in here.  What is all this stuff

anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's

this can?

KAREN (VO)

For your breath.  You could use it.

Squirt some in your mouth.

FOLEY (VO)

You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've

you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor

unfortunate offenders.

FOLEY (VO)

Where's your gun, your pistol?

KAREN

In my bag, in the car.

KAREN (CONT'D)

You know you don't have a chance of

making it.  Guards are out here already,

they'll stop the car.

FOLEY

They're off in the cane by now chasing

Cubans.  I timed it to slip between

the cracks, you might say.

FOLEY

Boy, it stunk in there.

KAREN

I believe it.  You've ruined a nine-

hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

FOLEY

Yeah, went real nice with that twelve

gauge, too.

(then)

Tell me, why in the world would someone

like you ever become a federal marshall?

KAREN

The idea of going after guys like you

appealed to me.

FOLEY

Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even

though I've been celibate lately, I'm

not gonna force myself on you.  I've

never done that in my life.

KAREN

You wouldn't have time anyway.  We

come to a roadblock, they'll run the

car, find out in five seconds who it

belongs to.

FOLEY

If they get set up in time, which I

doubt.  And even if they do they'll be

looking for a buncha little Latin

fellas, not a big black guy driving a

Ford.

KAREN

Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass

like this.

FOLEY

Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.

Back when we jailed together, he'd

call his sister every week without

fail.  She's a born-again Christian,

does bookkeeping for a televangelist.

Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,

tells her about whatever bank he

happened to rob.

KAREN

Buddy.  That's his given name?

FOLEY

(woops, beat)

One I gave him, yeah.

(mouths)

Fuck...

KAREN

So, what's

your

name?  It'll be in the

paper tomorrow anyway.

FOLEY

Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of

me.

KAREN

Why, are you famous?

FOLEY

Time I was convicted in California?

FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than

anyone in the computer.

KAREN

How many was that?

FOLEY

Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I

started when I was eighteen, driving

for my Uncle Cully and his partner,

Gus.  They go into a bank this one

time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter

to get the tellers and breaks his leg.

All three of us ended up in Angola.

KAREN

That's funny.

FOLEY

I thought so, too.

KAREN

It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on

the floor.

FOLEY

I believe you would have.  Another fall,

I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I

don't mean the place next door where

some of Nixon's people went.

KAREN

I know the difference.  You were in

Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.

I've delivered people there.  So

basically you've spent half your life

in prison.

FOLEY

(beat)

Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I

do a full thirty years, no time off.

Can you imagine looking at that?

KAREN

I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

FOLEY

You don't seem all that scared.

KAREN

Of course I am.

FOLEY

You don't act like it.

KAREN

What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I

don't think it would help much.

(then)

I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,

and wait for you to screw up.

FOLEY

Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.

KAREN

You were married?  All those falls,

I'm surprised you had time.

FOLEY

It was just a year, give or take a few

days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't

get along or anything.  We had fun, we

just didn't have that... that thing,

you know?  That spark, you know what I

mean?  You gotta have that.

KAREN

(thinking)

Uh-huh.

FOLEY

We still talk, though.

KAREN

Sure.

KAREN

You know, this isn't gonna end well,

these things never do.

FOLEY

Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot

like a dog, it'll be in the street,

not off a goddamn fence.

KAREN

You must see yourself as some kind of

Clyde Barrow.

FOLEY

Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm.

You ever see pictures of him, the way

he wore his hat?  You could tell he

had that don't-give-a-shit air about

him.

KAREN

I don't recall his hat, but I've seen

pictures of him lying dead, shot by

Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't

have his shoes on?

FOLEY

Is that right?

KAREN

They put a hundred and eighty-seven

bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker

and the car they were driving.  Bonnie

was eating a sandwich.

FOLEY

You're full of interesting facts, aren't

you?

KAREN

It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,

Louisiana.

FOLEY

That part in the movie where they get

shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't

think of her name.

KAREN

Faye Dunaway.

FOLEY

Yeah, I liked her in that movie about

TV...

KAREN

Network

.  Yeah, she was good.

FOLEY

And the guy saying he wasn't gonna

take any more shit from anybody...

KAREN

Peter Finch.

FOLEY

Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where

Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get

shot?  I remember thinking at the time

it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you

have to.

KAREN

Bleeding on a country road.

FOLEY

It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you

were in that car -- eating a sandwich --

you wouldn't have known what hit you.

FOLEY

You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder --

say we met under different circumstances

and got to talking, say you were in a

bar and I came up to you -- I wonder

what would happen.

KAREN

Nothing.

FOLEY

I mean if you didn't know who I was.

KAREN

You'd probably tell me.

FOLEY

I'm just saying I think if we met under

different circumstances...

KAREN

You have to be kidding.

FOLEY

Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked,

Three Days of the Condor

.

KAREN

With Robert Redford, when he was young.

FOLEY

Yeah...

KAREN

I never thought it made sense, though,

the way they got together so quick.

FOLEY

Really.

KAREN

I mean, romantically.

FOLEY

Uh-huh.

(then)

Well, but if --

BUDDY (OS)

You still alive in there?

FOLEY (OS)

Where in the hell are we?

BUDDY

That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's

waiting with the other car.

FOLEY

Okay, honey, come on out of there.

KAREN

Get your hands up and turn around.

Now

.

FOLEY

Shit...

BUDDY

We may as well leave her, we're leaving

the car and we gotta leave her some place

anyway, what's the difference where?

FOLEY

She's coming with us.

BUDDY

Jesus Christ, what were you doing in

there?

FOLEY

Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd

like to know who she is.

BUDDY

I already looked.  Her name is Karen

Sisco.  Like the Cisco Kid only spelled

different, S-i-s-c-o.

FOLEY

Karen?  Be a good girl now, you hear?

Now, I'm gonna open the--

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You're putting holes in your car!

FOLEY (CONT'D)

We're not leaving you.  I'm gonna open

the trunk enough for you to throw the

gun out.  Okay?  You shoot -- Buddy's

got your shotgun, says he'll shoot

back if you do and I can't stop him.

So it's up to you.

VOICE

Hey!

VOICE (CONT'D)

It's me, Glenn.

GLENN

Hey, Jack, good to see you, man.  The

fuck're you guys shooting at?

FOLEY

Do we need him?

BUDDY

The green-and-whites saw us.  One of

'em starts thinking, what's that car

doing there?  Ties it to the break and

turns around...

FOLEY

Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were

somebody else.

GLENN

Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since

Lompoc.  What's going on?

FOLEY

Oh, nuthin'.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You coming out?

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You hear that?

KAREN

You win, Jack.

FOLEY

Have your clothes cleaned and send me

the bill.

KAREN

I'll send it to you at Glades.

GLENN

Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a

sewer?

FOLEY

Take your sunglasses off.

GLENN

I see better with them on.

FOLEY

You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw

'em off the overpass while they're

still on your head.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Wait in the car.

GLENN

You're in civilization now, man, ease

up.

FOLEY

I'd like you to go wait in the car.

How's that?  Take her with you and put

her in back.

GLENN

In the trunk?

FOLEY

The backseat.

GLENN

Come on.  I have to do what I'm told.

FOLEY

Wait a minute.  Let me have your

raincoat.

(looks at Buddy)

Somebody forgot to bring me clean

clothes.

BUDDY

I brought 'em, they're back at Glades

in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take

her car.

KAREN

You can blame me if you want.  I don't

mind.

GLENN

Here you are, sir.

BUDDY

What's wrong with you?

FOLEY

Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll

never know.

BUDDY

How 'bout the score was his idea to

begin with?

FOLEY

His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's

got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you

and me figured the whole thing out.

BUDDY

You're pulling at it.  Here...

FOLEY

I don't know why, but every time he

opens his mouth I want to punch him

out.

BUDDY

He ain't the problem, Jack.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

You wanna pull your head outta your

ass and tell me why we're bringing

her

with us?

GLENN

...if he thinks he can talk to me like

this.  Shit, I don't even know what I

need them for.

GLENN (CONT'D)

I got a big score lined up up north.

They wouldn't even know about it, it

wasn't for me.  I could do it right

now myself, except it's so fucking

cold up there in January--

KAREN

Glenn?

KAREN (CONT'D)

You don't remember me, do you?

GLENN

(beat)

It couldn't have been out at Glades,

if that's what you're thinking.  I was

never out there.

KAREN

No, that's not what I'm thinking.

GLENN

But you're sure we've met, huh?

KAREN

Last fall, I drove you from the Palm

Beach county jail to the federal

courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn

Michaels.

(then)

I never forget anyone I've cuffed and

shackled.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if

we can work this out...

KAREN (CONT'D)

Do we have a gun in the car?

GLENN

I remember you now.  Shit.

KAREN

Foley's not going to make it.  And if

he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Look, I can understand if you and Foley

are close.

GLENN

We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

KAREN

Wait.

Have

you helped him, Glenn?  At

this point, technically, I doubt you

could be charged with aiding a fugitive.

So you still have a choice.  You can

help him and risk going down again,

get cuffed and shackled, hope to God

you pull a reasonable judge, not some

hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it

another way...

GLENN

Like how?

BUDDY

You want to take her to my place and

get cleaned up?  You come out of the

bathroom with your after-shave on and

she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?

FOLEY

I want to talk to her again, that's

all.  See what would happen under, you

know, normal circumstances.

BUDDY

You're too late, Jack.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

He wants to get out of here and I don't

blame him.

MAURICE

Dick.  My man.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

I got your fishies for you.

RIPLEY

(reaches for them)

Thank you...

MAURICE

(pulls them back)

Not so fast, Dick.

(off Ripley's look)

Starting now, there's gonna be an across

the board cost a living increase.

RIPLEY

What?

MAURICE

Year ago, I come in here on credit

card fraud, but after I shanked that

loudmouth pussy on the yard the other

day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone

way the fuck up.

RIPLEY

I think it's Dunn &

Brad

street.  But

then, I could be wrong...

MAURICE

Whoever.  The point is, prices are

goin' up, too.  Better get your little

black book out, Richard.  We got some

business to talk about.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Let's start with the fish.  They was

two grand, but now they's three.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you

asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

RIPLEY

(writing)

Well, I need that...

MAURICE

...and that extra pillow's gonna be an

even three c's.

VOICE

Hey.

FOLEY

Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't

you guys read?

MAURICE

(beat)

There a problem, Foley?

FOLEY

Yeah.

FOLEY

Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the

dumbest fucking shakedown in the history

of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred

bucks for a pillow?

MAURICE

That's right.

RIPLEY

Sounds high, doesn't it?

FOLEY

Must be a real soft pillow.

MAURICE

Faux goose down.

RIPLEY

Still...

FOLEY

How much for your company at chow?

MAURICE

Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

FOLEY

I bet.  How much?

MAURICE

Another C.

FOLEY

You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this

guy to fuck off.

RIPLEY

Really?  Well, I uhhh...

FOLEY

First of all, if he kills you, he's

not gonna get any more money out of

you.

MAURICE

Man doesn't have to get killed.  He

could accidentally fall on something

sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

FOLEY

You stick

anything

in this guy, Snoop,

they transfer his ass outta here

faster'n you can throw a fight, and

you still end up with nothing.

MAURICE

This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why

don't you go on out to the yard, have

yourself a smoke?

FOLEY

I don't smoke.

HIMEY

(slowly rising)

You heard the man.  Go on outta here.

MAURICE

Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.

He's ranked number thirty-two in the

federal prison system.

FOLEY

(looking at Himey)

Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

GUARD

What's going on here?

MAURICE

Oh, you know, reading's funnamental

an' shit, we just excited.

GUARD

Clear outta here.

RIPLEY

Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the

fish thing?

MAURICE

(looks at Foley)

Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

RIPLEY

That's how you do it.

RIPLEY

Thanks for your help.

FOLEY

Any time.

MAURICE

Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab.

A frisbee whizzes past the television

.  We hear A DOG YELP OS.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Hey!  Watch that shit!

MOSELLE

(calls OS)

Tuffy.  C'mere, boy...

MAURICE

You gonna answer the phone?

MOSELLE

What for?  It's not for me.

MOSELLE (CONT'D)

Bad dog.

MAURICE

(scoops up the dog)

Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my

little Tuffy?

MOSELLE

I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a

Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra

money.

MAURICE

That's the dumbest thing I heard in my

life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't

pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig,

it's gotta be for one of the big three:

Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit

for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin

phone.

MOSELLE

Hello?

(hands it to Maurice)

For you.

MAURICE

(takes it)

This is me.

GLENN

Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.

MAURICE

Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a

them psychic friends.  I was just

thinkin' about you.

GLENN

Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to

Detroit and need a place to crash.

MAURICE

You crazy, come up

here

?  It's fuckin

one degree outside.

GLENN

I wanna talk to you about a job.

MAURICE

Uh-huh.

GLENN

I can't really go into it right now.

I'll just tell you it's someone big.

MAURICE

Some

one

?  Gimme a hint.

GLENN

It's a guy you know.

MAURICE

Gimme another hint.

GLENN

It's Richard Ripley.

GLENN (CONT'D)

You there?

MAURICE

Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here.

Question is, why aren't

you

here?

FOLEY

I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

BUDDY

Cause she had her hand on her gun the

whole time, waiting to make her move.

FOLEY

You're just jealous it was me in the

trunk with her and not you.

BUDDY

You're right.

FOLEY

First thing I'm gonna do is get all

this mud off me.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

I've been dreaming about a hot bath

for the last six months.  Soak the prison

off me.

BUDDY

There's some lilac oil, you want some,

a vanilla candle under the sink.

FOLEY

Oh, man.

BUDDY

There's something about a nice hot

bath, transforms a person.  It's not

just about opening up your pores, know

what I mean?  There's just something

about the heat and the wet that's

calming you know?  Settles me in a way

that I really can't articulate.

FOLEY

I know exactly what you mean.  It's

just a feeling.

(beat)

You know, I could go for some wine

tonight.

BUDDY

There's a store around the corner,

I'll be right back.

FOLEY

Sounds great.

FOLEY

Hey.

MARSHALL SISCO (VO)

Karen...?

KAREN

What?

MARSHALL

You were talking in your sleep.

KAREN

(beat)

What'd I say?

MARSHALL

"Hey, yourself."

KAREN

Huh.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Hello, Daniel.

BURDON

(to Marshall)

Daniel Burdon, FBI.

MARSHALL

Marshall Sisco.  Karen's dad.

BURDON

You mind please waiting outside.  We

have some business to do here.

MARSHALL

I need to go to the john anyway.

KAREN

I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

BURDON

That's nice of you to offer, Karen,

but I got all the help I can use right

now.  Instead, let's talk about how

you got the bump on your head.

KAREN

(indicates file)

Isn't that my report you're holding

onto?

BURDON

Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.

Starting with when you tried to grab

the wheel -- where was this?

KAREN

Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

KAREN

Take the next exit.

GLENN

What am I supposed to do

now

?

KAREN

Glenn, take the exit.

GLENN

No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna

turn myself in.

GLENN (CONT'D)

The fuck are you doing?!

KAREN

The next thing I knew, the paramedics

were taking me out the car.

BURDON

There's a couple of points I keep

wondering about have to do with the

two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is

it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I

swear the man must've robbed two hundred

banks in his time.

KAREN

Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't

remember how many he robbed.

BURDON

You talked to him?

KAREN

In the trunk, yeah?

BURDON

What'd you talk about?

KAREN

Oh... different things, prison, movies.

BURDON

This fella holds you hostage, you talk

about movies?

KAREN

It was an unusual experience.

BURDON

Foley made me think of that fella Carl

Tillman, the one you were seeing, it

turns out the same time he was doing

banks.  You recall that?

KAREN

When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't

know he robbed banks.

BURDON

Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe

he did, and I told you.  So you had to

at least suspect him.

KAREN

And what happened to Carl?

BURDON

The time came, you shot him.  But you

didn't shoot Foley or the guy with

him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun

and you let them throw you in the trunk.

Okay, now you got your Sig in your

hand.  You say in the report you

couldn't turn around, he had you pinned

down.  But when the trunk opened, how

come you didn't cap the two guys then?

KAREN

Is that what you would've done?

BURDON

You say in the report Glenn didn't

have a gun, but you let him get away,

too.

KAREN

Daniel, what do you work on most of

the time, fraud?  Go after crooked

bookkeepers.

BURDON

Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen

years, on all kinds of investigations.

KAREN

Have you ever shot a man?  How many

times have you been primary through

the door?

BURDON

I have to qualify, is that it?

KAREN

You have to know what you're talking

about.

BURDON

We'll talk another time, Karen.  All

right?  I'd like to know why Foley put

you in that second car when he didn't

need you any more.

KAREN

You'll have to ask him.

BURDON

Sounds to me like he liked having you

around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr.

Sisco.

MARSHALL

Agent Burdon.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

The white man's Burdon.  That's what

everybody calls him in Miami.  The

Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for

pissing people off.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

What are you thinking about?

KAREN

The Sig Sauer you got me for my

birthday.

MARSHALL

Tell you what, you're a good girl, you

might get another one for Christmas.

KAREN

I'll get it back when I get Foley.

OLD WOMAN

Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen?

BUDDY

Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry.

KAREN

You win, Jack.

BUDDY

You made the front page.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

They pass this picture around you can

go anywhere you want, nobody'll know

you.

FOLEY

I wasn't feeling my best that day.

I'd just drawn thirty to life.

BUDDY

Maybe this'll make you feel better.

FOLEY

Thanks.

BUDDY

Paper says there's ten grand each on

you, Chino and Lulu.

FOLEY

Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?

BUDDY

Just that she got away.

FOLEY

Yeah, but what happened after she drove

off with Glenn?

BUDDY

You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most

likely, he's on his way to Detroit,

where we should be.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

You realize what you're doing?  Worrying

about a person that works in law

enforcement.  You want to sit down and

have cocktails with a girl that tried

to shoot you.  You hear what I'm saying?

FOLEY

Think this old guy is her boyfriend?

It's the only picture she carries.

BUDDY

Am I going to Detroit by myself?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Longer we hang around down here, Jack,

better chance there is either Glenn's

gonna fuck up the whole score, or we

gonna get busted, or both.

FOLEY

We'll leave first thing in the morning.

MARSHALL (VO)

Is

this

Foley?

KAREN

He doesn't even look like that.

MARSHALL

No?

KAREN

No, he looks a lot...

KAREN (CONT'D)

Different.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Hi, Ray.

RAY

You look great.  Your dad taking good

care of you?

KAREN

He took the week off so we'd have time

together.  So far he's worked on his

boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

RAY

I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.

MARSHALL

Likewise.

KAREN

Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force,

working on the prison break.

MARSHALL

(eyeing his T-shirt)

I see that.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

In case no one knows what he does.

Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,

"Undercover"?

RAY

No.  Course not.

KAREN

(changing the subject)

How's it going?

RAY

Great.  We got one of 'em.

KAREN

Was it Foley?

MARSHALL

(before he can answer)

Off a tip?

RAY

Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in

this hobo camp out by the airport,

called the number--

MARSHALL

I knew it, soon as I saw they were

offering a reward.

KAREN

Was it Foley?

RAY

Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the

Cubans.  Linares.

KAREN

Oh...

RAY

We went out there, full SWAT, two

choppers, the whole bit, but Linares

started shooting anyway.  We put him

down, but somehow Chirino got away.

MARSHALL

Did you pay the guy the reward?

RAY

Yeah, as soon as we got back.

KAREN

Foley hadn't been there?

RAY

This place was strictly Cuban.  If

Foley had a ride he must have his own

agenda. He seems to be the only one

knows what he's doing.

MARSHALL

Hello?

(beat)

Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.

(hands her the phone)

For you.

KAREN

Hello?

Vogue

while Buddy

FOLEY

Hi.

FOLEY

You know who this is?

KAREN

Yes.

FOLEY

I just wanted to see if you're okay,

make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,

you know, anything.

MARSHALL

Something I've been wondering, Ray...

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

It says in the headline, "I slept with

a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."

She lives in Little Havana, her

husband's out of town working when one

of the escapees shows up at her door...

KAREN

How'd you get this number?

FOLEY

Who was it answered the phone?

KAREN

None of your business.

FOLEY

I'm just worried maybe I'm not old

enough for you.

KAREN

That's my dad.

FOLEY

Really.  He has a cop's face.

KAREN

How do you know?  Wait-- you have my

wallet.

FOLEY

And your gun.

KAREN

Think I could have them back?

FOLEY

How do we do that?

KAREN

Let's see.  You could come on by my

dad's place, drop 'em off.

FOLEY

Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the

S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

Defiance

perfume.

KAREN

There's a guy here on the task force

right now.  Maybe I should put him on

the phone, let you two work it out.

FOLEY

You won't do that.

KAREN

Why not?

FOLEY

Because you're having too much fun.

MARSHALL

...She fixes him pork chops and rice,

the next thing you know they're making

love on the sofa.  She says he was

very gentle.

RAY

I spoke to her.  The guy told her he

missed his little girl and she felt

sorry for him.

MARSHALL

That's how you score now?

KAREN

My dad's retired.  He was a Private

Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to

work for him.

FOLEY

I can just picture that, a cute girl

like you following slip-and-fall and

whiplash cheaters.

KAREN

Something I've been wondering, what

ever happened to your Uncle Cully?

FOLEY

Why?  You think he might tell you where

I am?

KAREN

Unless you wanna tell me.

FOLEY

He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years

before he came out and died not too

long after in Charity Hospital, I think

trying to make up for all the good

times he'd missed.

(then)

That's not gonna be me.

KAREN

One last score, that the idea?  Move

to some island.

FOLEY

I'm partial to mountains myself.  But

if you like islands, we'll make it an

island.

KAREN

Whatta you mean

we'll

make it an island?

FOLEY

I just thought maybe you and me could--

BUDDY

Who you talking to?

KAREN

Is that Buddy?

FOLEY

What?!

BUDDY

You better come see this.

RAY

The woman also said he stole her

husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,

and some of his clothes.

MARSHALL

So the woman's married.  She goes to

bed with this prison escapee because

he misses his little girl and then

tells the world about it.  But you

don't reveal her name, you protect

her.  It sounds like you're saying

it's okay as long as her husband doesn't

find out about it.  Like the guy who

cheats on his wife, saying what she

doesn't know won't hurt her.

KAREN

Dad.

MARSHALL

What?

FOLEY

Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

BUDDY

He's running for his life, he doesn't

give a shit about you.

FOLEY

He's gotta know by now that I gave him

up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna

try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele,

see what she knows.

BUDDY

He knows where she lives?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Jack?

FOLEY

We were talking one time, drinking

rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how

she worked for a magician.  Chino got

interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How

does he saw the woman in half?  He

wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at

her if she ever came to visit.

BUDDY

So call her up.  Tell her don't talk

to any Cubans.

FOLEY

Her phone's probably tapped.

BUDDY

And you know they're gonna have some

people watching the hotel.

FOLEY

Shit.

MARSHALL

Remember, pay attention to how she

talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it

right, she'll tell you things she

wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you

think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell

her about being in the trunk with him,

in the dark for half an hour, and see

how she takes it.  If she's in on it,

what does she get for all the

aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I

bet nothing.  So she still likes him

enough to stick her neck out.  You

think that's possible?  What kind of

guy is he?

KAREN

He's pretty laid back, confident.

MARSHALL

He remind you of that guy, Tillman?

KAREN

Not at all.

MARSHALL

But you know he's dirty and you still

wanna see him again.

KAREN

I want to bust his ass, put him in

shackles.

MARSHALL

Maybe.  But you're also curious about

the man.  Twice last night you asked

your married boyfriend Nicolet about

him.  You were concerned, but you didn't

want to show it.

KAREN

My married boyfriend - setting him up

with that news story so you could talk

about infidelity.  I couldn't believe

it.

MARSHALL

You like the wild ones, don't you?

Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You

know, I've always said there's a thin

line between the cowboy cops and the

armed robbers, all those guys that

love to pack.

KAREN

Foley

kid

napped me.

MARSHALL

Yeah, but you talked all the way from

GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more

like a first date than a kidnapping.

MARSHALL (CONT'D)

Go talk to the ex-wife.

ADELE

Hi, this is Adele speaking.

CHINO

Oh, is this Adele?

ADELE (PHONE)

Yes, it is.

CHINO

Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

BUDDY

Nice disguise.

FOLEY

I'm a tourist.

BUDDY

You at least bring the gun?

FOLEY

(lifts straw bag)

In here with my suntan lotion and beach

towel.

(points)

That's her place.

BUDDY

There.  You see the guy sitting on the

porch?  The old ladies and one guy?

You know they'll have a couple more in

a car somewhere.

FOLEY

(watching something

else)

Uh-huh...

BUDDY

Oh, my.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Okay, you saw her.  That's all you

get.

FOLEY

I guess Adele's in good hands.

BUDDY

Sure looks that way.

FOLEY

(finally)

Let's go to Detroit.

BUDDY

Now you're talkin'.

ADELE

You were

both

in the trunk?  Together?

KAREN

From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I

left with Glenn.

KAREN

The FBI didn't tell you I was with

them?

ADELE

They didn't

tell

me anything, they

asked questions.

KAREN

But you know what I'm talking about,

don't you?  About Glenn, don't you,

and the second car?

ADELE

I know a Glenn.

ADELE (CONT'D)

I'm getting ready to go out.  You can

come in if you want, sit down for a

minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?

KAREN

No, thanks.

ADELE

Those are cute shoes.  The kind of

jobs I get, I have to wear these killer

spikes, they ruin your feet.

ADELE (CONT'D)

When you were in the trunk with Jack...

ADELE (CONT'D)

He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

KAREN

You mean, did he try to jump me?  No,

but he was kind of talkative.

ADELE

He gets that way when he's nervous

sometimes.

KAREN

You didn't visit him in prison.

ADELE

He didn't want me to.

KAREN

Why not?

ADELE

I don't know.  He was different after

he was sentenced, looking at thirty

years.  Said it depressed him every

time the younger cons called him an

old timer.

KAREN

But you spoke to him on the phone.

ADELE

He'd call every once in a while.

KAREN

He called the day he escaped.

ADELE

He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say

about me?  In the trunk?

KAREN

(beat, lies)

He said he wished the two of you could

start over, live a normal life.

ADELE

Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a

normal life is robbing banks.  It's

all he's ever done.

KAREN

Did you know that when you married

him?

ADELE

He said he was a card player.  I could

live with that.  I never knew he robbed

banks till he got busted with that car

that caught fire -- if you can imagine

something like that happening, comes

out of the bank and the car's on fire.

I did go see him in jail to tell him I

was filing for divorce.  He said,

"Okay."  Jack's so easy going.

(then)

He was fun, but never what you'd call

a real husband.

ADELE (CONT'D)

I'll say one thing for Jack, he was

never ugly or mean, or drank too much.

He was very considerate, lights on or

off, if you know what I mean.

KAREN

Really.

(looking at the picture)

Hm.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get

caught.  I'd like to get him before he

does something else, makes it worse on

himself.

ADELE

Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him

out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience.

Always has been.

(chuckles)

He tell you how they met?

ADELE (CONT'D)

Jack came out of a bank he just robbed

in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen

car to start.  Battery was dead.  He

looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a

burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers

him a thousand dollars for a jump.

Turns out, Buddy was casing the same

bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy

says, I'll take the thousand, but we're

leaving in my car, not that piece of

shit you come in.

(then)

They musta robbed fifty banks together.

KAREN

Till they got busted.

ADELE

That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that

was on account of Buddy, for some

reason, decided to call his sister and

confess to a job

before

they'd done it

instead of after.  She called the FBI

and they both went down, ended up at

Lompoc.

(then)

I think Buddy felt kinda bad about

that.

KAREN

Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or

Glenn?

CHINO'S VOICE

Adele?  You in there?

ADELE

Yes.

CHINO

I want to speak with you, please.

ADELE

Who is it?

CHINO'S VOICE

I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.

He tole me your number and where you

live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant

and would like to speak to you.

ADELE

Oh.  Uh-huh.

CHINO'S VOICE

You did work for Emil, right?

ADELE

Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost

four years.

CHINO'S VOICE

You were his what, his box?

ADELE

His assistant.

something

...

ADELE (CONT'D)

You say you perform in the Miami area?

CHINO'S VOICE

Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in

Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the

Mayishan was my name.

CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Can you open the door?

ADELE

I'm not dressed.

CHINO'S VOICE

Listen to me.

(lowers his voice)

I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

KAREN

Ask him his name.

ADELE

Who are you?

CHINO'S VOICE

(beat)

Jose Chirino.

CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me

Chino.  I'm the same person.

KAREN

(soft)

Tell him to wait in the hall, you have

to get dressed.  Say it loud.

ADELE

Wait in the hall!  I have to get

dressed!

CHINO'S VOICE

Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't

bother you no more.

ADELE

I don't know where he is.

CHINO'S VOICE

Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape

from prison.  He tole me, I can't find

him to see you.  So why don't you open

this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can

speak.

ADELE

(staring at Karen)

Go away, or I'll call the police.

CHINO'S VOICE

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm

leaving.

(then)

I'm going now.  I see you maybe some

time, okay?  Bye bye.

KAREN

(low)

Go in the bedroom and --

KAREN (CONT'D)

Leave it where it is.

CHINO

(frowning)

Wait.  You not Adele?

KAREN

I'm a federal marshal and you're under

arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I

mean, now.

CHINO

Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

KAREN

Put it down or I'll shoot.

CHINO

You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

KAREN

What do you want to bet?

CHINO

(beat)

I could walk out of here.

KAREN

If you move, if you look at her again,

you're dead.

KAREN (CONT'D)

You can live or die, it's up to you.

CHINO

Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot

me?  Nice girl like you?

(smiles)

I don't think so.

KAREN

You don't, huh?

ADELE (CONT'D)

On your knees.

ADELE (CONT'D)

Lie face down on the floor.

CHINO

(hurting)

What?!

CHINO (CONT'D)

(to Adele)

Excuse me...

KAREN

Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.

CHINO

Excuse me, Adele?

ADELE

Yes.

CHINO

You do the sawing of the box in half

trick with you inside?

ADELE

(beat)

Yes.

CHINO

Tell me, how do you do that?

KAREN

Shut up.

BURDON (PHONE)

Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying

to get a hold of you.

KAREN

Daniel.  Listen --

BURDON (PHONE)

Where are you?  I been trying to reach

you.

KAREN

I'm at Adele Delisi's.

BURDON (PHONE)

What-- we already talked to her.  That's

a dead end.

KAREN

(looking at Chino)

Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving.

Why were you trying to reach me?

BURDON (PHONE)

There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around

the same time Foley was there.  We got

an address for him at the Adams Hotel

in Hallandale.  I want you to go there,

see if you can get the manager to i.d.

him as the other guy.  If he does, you

call me right away...

KAREN

All right, but...

BURDON (PHONE)

But don't you

do

anything.  You just

have a seat, wait for me to get there.

KAREN

Sure, Daniel.

BURDON (PHONE)

Now.  What is it you wanted to tell

me?

KAREN

Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to

bring in Chirino, would you put me on

the task force?

BURDON (PHONE)

(impatient)

What?  Is that what you're calling me

about?

KAREN

Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will

you let me go after Foley?

BURDON (PHONE)

Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in

Chirino, you can be on the task

force.

KAREN

That's all I wanted to know.

BURDON (PHONE)

Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife

and get over to the Adams Hotel.

ADELE

You're good.

KAREN

Thank you.

FOLEY

First thing we do, we get to Detroit,

we find Glenn, then we find a window

to throw him out of.

BUDDY

I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was

up there to take down the Ripper, where

would I go?

FOLEY

Well, first off, if you were Glenn,

you wouldn't be thinking.

BUDDY

Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal

from Lompoc?

FOLEY

Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be

brain dead by now.

BUDDY

He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told

me the Snoop's been managing some guys

up there now, works out at the Kronk.

BURDON

You get the key?

KAREN

They're in 7D.

BURDON

I want two men outside, front and back.

Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,

cover both ends of the hall.

BURDON (CONT'D)

You're primary, you're secondary, you're

point man.

KAREN

You're gonna use a ram?

BURDON

Yeah, why?

KAREN

The manager's door is metal.

KAREN (CONT'D)

You know what I mean?  They might all be.

And a ram on a metal door makes an awful

lot of noise for what good it does.

FOURTH MAN

I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun

oughta do the trick.

BURDON

Fine.  Whatever.

BURDON (CONT'D)

Fuck it.  Let's take the stairs.

Karen...

BURDON (CONT'D)

Take the radio, stay down here in the

lobby, watch the elevator.

KAREN

What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

BURDON

You can go wait out in the car, you

want to.

BURDON (CONT'D)

Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg

come in behind us, whatta you do?

KAREN

(pissed)

Call and tell you.

BURDON

And you let them come up.  You don't

try to make the bust yourself.  You

understand?

OLD WOMAN

Are you delivering the oxygen?

BUDDY

Is this your floor, mother?

OLD LADY

Oh.  Yes, it is.

OLD GENT

Like to play some gin?

KAREN

No, thank you.

BURDON (RADIO)

Karen.  They're not up here.  Keep

your eyes open.

OLD GENT

Going up?

waves as the door closes

.

OLD GENT

Shit, I wanted to go up.

BUDDY

Let's just hope there's no one in the

garage.

FOLEY

She looked right at me.  She didn't

yell or get excited.  She didn't move.

BUDDY

They know where I live, I guess they

know what I drive, so maybe we should

pick up another car on the way.

FOLEY

She just sat there, looking right at

me.

BURDON (ON THE RADIO)

Karen.  Report.  You see anything?

Karen?  You there?  Karen...?

MARSHALL

He waved to you?

KAREN

I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty

sure he did.

MARSHALL

You wave back?

KAREN

I didn't have time.

MARSHALL

I imagine you would've though.

KAREN

Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got

two calls from Buddy up in Detroit

this morning, called Burdon.  She's

also the one gave Burdon Buddy's

address.

MARSHALL

So?

KAREN

So what I want to know is why Buddy

still calls his sister every week even

after she turned him in.

MARSHALL

He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.

(then)

What

I

want to know is why, they got

such a big score up north, did Foley

hang around Miami for so long?

(looks at her)

Any thoughts on that one?

KAREN

None I'd like to share.

KAREN (CONT'D)

I'll call soon as I get in.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAURICE (VO)

I don't just manage fighters, or deal

product any more...

MAURICE

I've diversified since the last time

you saw me.  I've vertically integrated

and now I'm into home invasions and

the occasional grand larceny.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my

bodyguard when I feel I need one, and

my driver.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Watch the road, boy.

(then)

I like this Town Car.  We can cruise

the man's neighbourhood without getting

the police or private security people

on our ass.

GLENN

Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving

around a black guy wearing shades and

a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they

won't think anything of it.

MAURICE

It's lilac, man, the color, and the

style's made known by Deion and other

defensive backs in the pros.  I could

be one of them living out here with

doctors of my race and basketball

players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's

house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick

wall.  There's his drive, right there.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming

up here, do this themself?

GLENN

If they're not busted now, they're

gonna be.

(then)

It's wide open.

GLENN

So you still haven't said, how you

wanna do it?

MAURICE

I'll show you, soon as I get one more

guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,

Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

GLENN

What?

MAURICE

You get everything?

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told

you about, Glenn.

KENNETH

The one gonna help us rip off the rich

guy?

MAURICE

That's right.

GLENN

Help

you

...

GLENN (CONT'D)

Wait a minute.  I'm letting

you

in on

this, not all your friends.

MAURICE

You just ask me how we gonna do it.

That's what I'm here for, tell you

how.  We the experts.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Thing I'm worried about is you.

GLENN

Me?

MAURICE

Yeah.  If you can step up and actually

do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just

talking the talk.

GLENN

Can I do what?

MAURICE

Walk in a house with me, do this cross-

dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I

used to sell to been dealin' on his

own.

GLENN

What-- when?

MAURICE

Right now, son.

GLENN

I don't have to prove shit to you.

The Ripley job is

my

job.  You're either

in or you're not.  You wanna pop some

crack dealer pissed you off, that's

your problem, not mine.

MAURICE

Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you

don't have to give me no tone of voice,

okay?  You don't like what I'm saying,

you can get out anywhere along here

you want.

GLENN

I think you're forgetting, this is my

car.  I drove it up here.

MAURICE

Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this

car, man, it's mine.  You go get

yourself another one.  I say I'm in on

Ripley?  I'm in, with or without

your

ass.  I say I want you to come along

on another job, see if you for real or

not, guess what you gonna do?

WHITE BOY BOB

We're here.

MAURICE

Let's go see Eddie.

RIPLEY (V.O.)

Must take balls, do what you do.

RIPLEY

Tell me something.  What's it like,

walk in a bank with a gun, stick it

up?

FOLEY

I don't know.  I never used a gun.

RIPLEY

Really?

FOLEY

You'd be surprised what all you can

get, you ask for it the right way.

RIPLEY

(smiles)

You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep

all my money in banks.

FOLEY

No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?

(Ripley smiles)

I'm talking about all those uncut

diamonds you told Glenn about.

RIPLEY

(still smiling)

I know what you're talking about.

FOLEY

You're the one with balls, Dick, say

something like that to someone like

Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where

you were for a minute.

RIPLEY

Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?

I mean, do

you

believe Glenn?

FOLEY

Of course not.

RIPLEY

Plus, even it was true, he'd still

have to figure out where I keep 'em.

FOLEY

Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You

told

him you keep 'em at your house.

RIPLEY

(shrugs, big smile)

It's a big house.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

Tell me something, Jack, how much longer

you in here?

FOLEY

Twenty-two months, three days, two

hours.  Why?

RIPLEY

I was just thinking that I could use a

guy like you, someone knows how to ask

for things the right way.  I'm talkin'

about when you're outta here.  I mean,

you can't rob banks for ever.

FOLEY

It's a little late for me.

RIPLEY

Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make

my first million until I was forty-

two.  Forty-two.  You really

want

to

change, it's never too late.

FOLEY

I don't know.  I'm not exactly the

nine-to-five type.

RIPLEY

Who is?  But then you gotta look at a

job as more than just work.  You gotta

look at it as peace of mind.  As

security

, you know what I mean?  I got

offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,

take your pick.

FOLEY

My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down

there.

RIPLEY

No need to decide now.  Be like the

fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

FOLEY

The fish?

RIPLEY

Yeah, fish live in the present.  They

don't dwell on yesterday and they don't

worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big

fish attacks a little fish, there's no

neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward.

No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.

They just do it.  They accept.

FOLEY

I can't say that I've paid that much

attention to 'em before.

RIPLEY

The fish saved my life.  Two years

ago, I found out I had high blood

pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me

to go get an aquarium, look at the

fish every time I felt myself stressing

out.

FOLEY

And the guy sent you a bill for this?

RIPLEY

It works.  You should try it sometime.

FOLEY

The next time I walk into a bank.

RIPLEY

Think about my offer, Jack.

BUDDY (V.O.)

Hey, Jack...

FOLEY

What?

BUDDY

You see this one...

BUDDY (CONT'D)

"Fight over tuna casserole may have

spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's

live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,

complained about her tuna noodle

casserole and she shot him in the face

with a twelve-gauge.  Police found

noodles in the woman's hair and think

the guy dumped the casserole dish on

her before she shot him.  They'd been

together ten years.

FOLEY

Love is funny.

BUDDY

Hey--

MAURICE

Was a time you see a gold Mercedes

over in the parking lot has a license

plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy

Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would

get our juices flowing.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

You already got your juices flowing,

huh?  Pissed your pants back there at

Eddie's house, didn't you?

MAURICE (CONT'D)

That was some shit, huh?

GLENN

(indicates Kenneth)

Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

MAURICE

Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that

to that poor girl.

KENNETH

(smiles)

Do what?

MAURICE

Just wait till we get inside Ripley's

house.

GLENN

It's all right with you, I'll just

hang in the car.

MAURICE

(beat)

No.  You gonna stay close to me from

now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

GLENN

Why would I do that?

MAURICE

Was worse than you imagined, wasn't

it?

(then, smiles)

Baby, you with the bad boys now.

BUDDY

Whatta you think?

FOLEY

I think Glenn opened his big mouth and

now we got us another partner.

BUDDY

Or two.

MAURICE

Stick and jab!

VOICE

Hey, Studs, how you doing?

GLENN

Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing

here?

FOLEY

Weren't you expecting us?

GLENN

That broad you picked up -- did you

know she was a US Marshal, for Christ

sake?

GLENN (CONT'D)

She

knew

me from some bullshit dope

bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice.

You know what she said, we're in the

car on the turnpike?  "I never forget

anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

FOLEY

Yeah?  She said that to you?

FOLEY (CONT'D)

What happened to your shades?  Someone

finally step on 'em?

GLENN

(touches his head)

I don't know...

FOLEY

Whose blood you got all over you?

GLENN

These guys, man, they're crazy.

(looks off)

Shit.

FOLEY

Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo

rag?

BUDDY

What's he do now, tell fortunes?

WHITE BOY BOB

We have a problem here?

MAURICE

(walking over)

Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

FOLEY

Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

MAURICE

It seems to me I been reading about

you in the newspaper.  Busted out of

some joint in Florida, huh?

FOLEY

Low class of people there, Snoop.

WHITE BOY BOB

You call him that again I'll put your

head through the wall.

BUDDY

What?  You mean Snoop?

MAURICE

Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,

is what White Boy's trying to say.

He's a little crude, you understand.

No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

BUDDY

But you call this bozo White Boy?

GLENN

White Boy Bob.

(baiting)

White Boy used to be a fighter.

BUDDY

What's he do now outside of shoot his

mouth off?

FOLEY

Like being back in the yard, huh?

MAURICE

Just like it.  Nobody backing down.

You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what

you and Buddy doing up here in the

cold?

FOLEY

Glenn didn't tell you?

GLENN

I thought you guys were busted.

FOLEY

Why?  Just because you left us standing

on the side of the road?

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn

promised you or what you think you're

gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy

get half of whatever we take from

Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn

cut up the rest is up to you.

MAURICE

Let's go outside and talk.

FOLEY

What's the matter with right here?

It's nice and warm.

MAURICE

Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees

in here, sometimes a hundred -- the

way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd

sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy

Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any

business in here.  To me this is holy

ground, man.  You understand?  I got

to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to

talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,

we'll sit down and look at it good.

The State Theater.

FOLEY

We'll see you tomorrow then.

MAURICE

White Boy, how much is the reward on

the man again?

WHITE BOY BOB

Ten gees.

MAURICE

Uh-huh.

(then)

You recall, did it say dead or alive?

KAREN

I'm looking for Ray Cruz.

COP

He's inside.

(pissed)

With everybody else.

VOICE

Called themselves the Youngboys.

CRUZ

Ironic, isn't it?

KAREN

How are you, Raymond?

CRUZ

Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

KAREN

Quite a mess.

CRUZ

Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked

Eddie.

KAREN

Who?

CRUZ

Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,

used to buy scag off a corner till he

kicked it and found his happiness with

crack and then started dealing himself.

Word on the street was he was saving

up for an operation.

KAREN

What is it with crack and transsexuals?

CRUZ

Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had

these girls cooked the rocks he called

the Rockettes.

KAREN

Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.

CRUZ

Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped

her, shot her, then threw her out the

window.

(shakes his head)

Fuckin' animals.

CRUZ (CONT'D)

Let's get some air.

CRUZ

Other than we had so much fun the last

time we worked together.  You gonna

tell me why you're comin' to me instead

of the FBI?

KAREN

I report to the FBI, first thing they're

gonna do is ask me to go get some

coffee.

CRUZ

You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

KAREN

No, I didn't know that.

CRUZ

Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and

property now, also sex crimes and child

abuse.

KAREN

Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

CRUZ

Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions

are big, too.

KAREN

Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had

this guy Glenn Michaels on possession

with intent but couldn't make it stick.

In his statement, Glenn said he went

up to Detroit to visit a friend and

look into job opportunities -- if you

can believe that.

CRUZ

Who was the friend?

KAREN

Guy named Maurice Miller, also known

as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

CRUZ

Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a

fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray

Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other

Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

KAREN

I'll need a last known address.

CRUZ

That's fine, but I don't want you to

talk to Miller alone.

KAREN

Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,

I'm armed.

CRUZ

Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow

with the address.

BUDDY (PHONE)

You have the paper?

FOLEY

It's a terrific shot of her.

BUDDY

Outside of that.

FOLEY

Doesn't say what she's doing up here,

but I don't think it has anything to

do with us.

BUDDY

She came up here on her vacation, 'cause

she likes shitty weather.

FOLEY

I think she's after Glenn.  The girl

still with you?

BUDDY

They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less

you pay for it.

FOLEY

You tell your sister about it?

BUDDY

Just hung up.

FOLEY

How long you talk to her?

BUDDY

Two hours.

FOLEY

How long were you with the girl?

BUDDY

Forty-five minutes.

FOLEY

You didn't tell your sister about

Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna

go through that again.

BUDDY

Forget about my sister.  If Karen

Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

Tomorrow night at the fights we all

get picked up.

FOLEY

Let's drive by where we're meeting and

have a look.  Maybe take a look at

Ripley's place while we're at it.

RIPLEY (V.O.)

I guess next time I see you, you'll be

wearing a suit and tie...

FOLEY

I still haven't made up my mind yet.

RIPLEY

What's to think about?

FOLEY

You goin' right back to work?

RIPLEY

First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,

study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...

then come back, maybe take some tennis

lessons.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

Here...

(hands it to Foley)

Something to remember me by.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

It's not the real thing, but it's still

nice to look at.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

See you on the outside, Jack.

FOLEY

(smiles)

Hi!  I just broke outta jail!

VOICE (PHONE)

Atheneum Hotel.

FOLEY

Karen Sisco, please.

VOICE

(pause, then)

I'm sorry, but there's no one by that

name registered.

FOLEY

Thank you.

VOICE

Best Western...

KAREN

Moselle Miller?

MOSELLE

What do you want?

KAREN

I'm looking for Maurice.

MOSELLE

You find him, tell him the dog got run

over and I'm out of grocery money.

MALE VOICE

Moselle.  Who you talking to?

MOSELLE

Lady looking for Maurice.

MALE VOICE

What's she want?

MOSELLE

Hasn't said.

KAREN

That's not Maurice?

MOSELLE

That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's

talking on the phone.

MALE VOICE

Ask what she want with him?

MOSELLE

You ask her.  Maurice's business is

none of

my

business.

MALE VOICE

How do I know?

KENNETH

The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

MOSELLE

You like to sit down?

KAREN

Thanks.

KAREN (CONT'D)

I'm looking for a friend of mine I think

Maurice knows.

MOSELLE

You not with probation, one of those?

KAREN

No.

MOSELLE

You a lawyer?

KAREN

(smiles)

No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him.

Glenn Michaels?

MOSELLE

Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

KAREN

He said he stayed here last November.

MOSELLE

Here?  In this house?

KAREN

He said he stayed with Maurice.

MOSELLE

Well,

he

ain't even here that much.  I

like to know where he goes, but at the

same time I don't

want

to know, you

understand?

KAREN

(beat)

Your dog was killed?

MOSELLE

Got run over by a car.

KAREN

What did you call it?

MOSELLE

Was a she, name Tuffy.

KAREN

(nods, then)

Where do you think I might find Maurice?

MOSELLE

I don't know -- the gym, the fights.

I

know

he don't miss the fights.  Having

some tomorrow night at the State

Theater.  He use to take me.

KAREN

The State Theater?

VOICE

What you want with Maurice?

MOSELLE

She looking for a man name of Glenn.

KENNETH

Did I ask you?  Go on out of here.  Do

something with yourself.

KAREN

You're a fighter?

KENNETH

How you know that?

KAREN

I can tell.

KENNETH

I

was

...

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Till I got my retina detached two time.

KAREN

What'd you fight, middleweight?

KENNETH

Light to super-middleweight, as my

body developed.  You go about what,

bantam?

KAREN

Flyweight.

KENNETH

You know your divisions.  You like the

fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah,

I bet you do.

(moves closer)

Like to get down and tussle a little

bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she

got run over, we use to get down on

the floor and tussle.  I say to her,

"You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat

for you."  And I give Tuffy what every

dog love best.  You know what that is?

A bone.

(real close)

I can give you a bone, too, girl.

KAREN

You're not my type.

KENNETH

Don't matter.  I let the monster out,

you gonna do what it wants.

KAREN

Just a minute.

KENNETH

Bring your own rubbers with you?

KENNETHN (CONT'D)

What else you have in there, mace?

Have a whistle, different kinds of

female-protection shit?

KAREN

I have to go, Kenneth.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

KENNETH

We gonna tussle first.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

God

damn

...

KENNETH (CONT'D)

What's wrong with you?

KAREN

You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

KAREN (CONT'D)

I wrote my hotel number on there -- in

case you run into Glenn.

BUDDY

Now that's a really big house.

FOLEY

Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost

looks like a prison.

BUDDY

No doubt the man's got some big-ass

security system.

FOLEY

Time comes, we knock on the door.  See

if he wants to talk about old times.

Go in the easy way.

BUDDY

Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we

got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole

with us?

FOLEY

Who says anybody's gonna be with us?

I say we go to the fights tomorrow,

find out what the Snoop's big plan is,

then go in ahead of those guys --

alone

.

BUDDY

Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while

we're off livin' the good life.

FOLEY

Tell me something, Buddy.  You know

anyone who's actually done one last

big score and gone to live the good

life?  Cause it occurred to me that

everyone

talks

about doing it, but I

don't know anyone who's actually gone

and

done

it.  Do you?

BUDDY

(beat)

What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

I mean, they don't know for sure he's

dead.

(then)

Look, there's always a chance we'll

walk out've there with nothing.  I say

let fate decide.

FOLEY

Let fate decide?  What're you, the

fuckin' Dali Lama now?

BUDDY

My sister believes in fate, but not

hell.  That's why she stopped praying

for the lost souls since you don't

hear that much about purgatory anymore.

But every day she asks her boss to

pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think,

you think there's a hell, Jack?

FOLEY

Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional

Institution and I'm sure as shit not

going back there or any place like it.

BUDDY

You might not have a choice.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

They put a gun on you, you'll go back.

FOLEY

They put a gun on you, you still have

a choice, don't you?

MR. HEARN (VO)

I think you're gonna fit right in...

MR. HEARN

Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long

discussion about your role in the

company and it was his feeling that

you would be happiest working down

here in Miami.  How's that sound to

you?

FOLEY

Great.

MR. HEARN

You're about a 42 long, right?

FOLEY

What?

MR. HEARN

Okay.  Let's see how she fits.

FOLEY

What is this?

MR. HEARN

Your uniform.

FOLEY

My what?

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Are you kidding me?

RECEPTIONIST (OS)

Sir, you can't go in there...

RIPLEY

Jack?  Whoa-- what's the problem?

Take it easy, let's talk...

FOLEY

A security guard?  Are you fucking

kidding me?

RIPLEY

You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.

But I was pretty sure that, if you

did, you'd throw the job in my face.

(then)

Understand something, Jack.  Up to

this point, everything you've done

with your life means absolutely nothing

in the real world.  Less than nothing.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

You're a bank robber.  This is not a

marketable skill.  There are no old

bank robbers out in the world living

on pensions.  You know this.  That's

why you're here right now.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at

a lousy wage.  You think you're better

than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me

that you're really willing to change

and we'll talk about something better.

A lot better.  But first, Jack, you

gotta earn it.

FOLEY

How, Dick?  The way

you

earned it?  By

marrying some rich broad owns the

company, selling it off a piece at a

time, then divorcing her?  What is

this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by

the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in

prison, guy like you, place like that,

you were ice cream for freaks.  You

were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and

a dozen other guys coulda bled you

till you had nothing.  Till you

were

nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll

pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a

fuckin stool all day saying "sign in

here please" or "hey, pal, you can't

park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do

it.

RIPLEY

Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I

misjudged you.

FOLEY

Hey, what job he promise

you

guys?

GUARD

There's two ways we can do this.

FOLEY

Yeah?  What are they?

RIPLEY

Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down

now.  Haven't we, Jack?

FOLEY

Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally

"relaxed..."

The one from the opening

.  Foley looks at it a moment, then

CUT TO:

FOLEY

Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,

few other things before tomorrow.  Why

don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,

we'll hook up later?

BUDDY

Yeah, and I better call my sister.

KAREN

Jack Daniel's, please, water on the

side.

EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE

Celeste, do us again, please, and put

the lady's drink on our bill.

KAREN

Thanks anyway.

WAITRESS

(drifting over)

They want to buy you a drink.

KAREN

I get that.  Tell them I'd rather pay

for my own.

EXECUTIVE GUY

Excuse me.  My associates and I made a

bet on what you do for a living.

EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)

And I won.  Hi, I'm Philip.

KAREN

If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd

like to just have a quiet drink and

leave.  Okay?

PHILIP

Don't you want to know what I guessed?

How I know what you do for a living?

KAREN

Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly

curious.  Really, I don't want to be

rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left

alone.

EXECUTIVE GUY #2

I think I know why you're depressed --

if I may offer an observation.

EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)

I have a hunch you're the new sales

rep and your customer isn't exactly

knocked out by the idea of a young

lady, even one as stunning as you,

handling the account.  Am I close?

Hi, I'm Andy.

ANDY

We're ad guys.  We flew in from New

York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker

Distillery, present this test-market

campaign for their new margarita mix.

What we do, we show this guy who looks

like a Mexican bandido, you know, with

the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

KAREN

Andy?  Really.  Who gives a shit?

ANDY

Want to tell me what happened?

KAREN

Beat it, will you?

VOICE

Can I buy you a drink?

KAREN

(beat)

Yeah, I'd love one.

(then)

Would you like to sit down?

FOLEY

I'm Gary.

KAREN

I'm Celeste.

KAREN (CONT'D)

It takes hours to get a drink around

here.  There's only one waitress.

FOLEY

I can go to the bar.

KAREN

Don't leave me.

FOLEY

Those guys bother you?

KAREN

No, they're all right.  I meant, you

just got here.

KAREN (CONT'D)

Help yourself.

FOLEY

You like bourbon?

KAREN

Love it.

FOLEY

(passes the glass

back)

Well, we got that out of the way.

(then)

Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for

a living?

KAREN

I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call

on a customer and they gave me a hard

time because I'm a girl.

FOLEY

Is that how you think of yourself?

KAREN

What, as a sales rep?

FOLEY

A girl.

KAREN

I don't have a problem with it.

FOLEY

I like your hair.  And that suit.

KAREN

I had one just like it -- well, it was

the same idea, but I had to get rid of

it.

FOLEY

You did?

KAREN

It smelled.

FOLEY

Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

KAREN

No.

(then)

What do you do for a living, Gary?

FOLEY

(beat)

How far do we go with this?

KAREN

Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?

FOLEY

I don't think it works if we're somebody

else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and

Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about

anything?

KAREN

It's your game.  I've never played

this before.

FOLEY

It's not a game.  Something you play.

KAREN

Well, does it make sense to you?

FOLEY

It doesn't have to, it's something

that happens.  It's like seeing a person

you never saw before -- you could be

passing on the street -- you look at

each other and for a few seconds,

there's a kind of recognition.  Like

you both know something.  But then the

next moment the person's gone, and

it's too late to do anything about it,

but you remember it because it was

right there and you let it go, and you

think, "What if I had stopped and said

something?"  It might happen only a

few times in your life.

KAREN

Or once.

FOLEY

Why don't we get out of here.

KAREN

How'd you find me?

KAREN (CONT'D)

Oh, God...

FOLEY

I called your room from downstairs.

KAREN

If I had answered, what were you gonna

say?

FOLEY

Well, I'd say who I was and do you

remember me and ask if you'd like to

meet for a drink.

KAREN

If I remembered you.  I came looking

for you.  I would've said sure, let's

do it.  But for all you knew I could

show up with a SWAT team.  Why would

you trust me?

FOLEY

It would be worth the risk.

KAREN

You like taking risks.

FOLEY

So do you.

KAREN

What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to

be somewhere?

KAREN (CONT'D)

Sooner or later...

KAREN (CONT'D)

You really wear that suit.

FOLEY

That's not what you were about to say.

KAREN

Remember how talkative you were?  In

the trunk?  Adele said you do that

when you're nervous.

FOLEY

She did, huh.

KAREN

You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

FOLEY

Yeah, but in a nice way.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

(unbuttoning)

I might've smelled like a sewer, but

you could tell I was a gentleman.

They say John Dillinger was a pretty

nice guy.

KAREN

He killed a police officer.

FOLEY

I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop

fell as Dillinger was aiming at his

leg and got him through the heart.

KAREN

You believe that?

FOLEY

Why not?

KAREN

You know that Sig .380 you took was my

favourite.  My father gave it to me.

KAREN (CONT'D)

What were you gonna do with me?

FOLEY

I don't know.  I hadn't worked that

part out yet.  All I knew was that I

liked you, and I didn't want to leave

you there, never see you again.

KAREN

You waved to me in the elevator.

FOLEY

I wasn't sure you caught that.

KAREN

I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking

of you by then, a lot, wondering what

it would be like if we did meet.  Like

if we could take a time-out...

FOLEY

Really?  I was thinking the same thing.

If we could call time and get together

for a while.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You know I saw you on the street.

KAREN

Where?

FOLEY

Outside Adele's.

KAREN

You were going to see her?

FOLEY

To warn her about Chino.

KAREN

So she did help you?

FOLEY

I don't think we should get into that.

KAREN

No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't

ask if he's with you or what you're

doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've

run into Glenn Michaels yet.

FOLEY

Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare

me.

KAREN

Come on.

KAREN

Are you gonna leave your tie on?

FOLEY

My God, look at you.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You having fun?

FOLEY

You coming back?

KAREN

I'm just going to the bathroom.

KAREN

I want you to know something.  I wasn't

looking for just a fuck, if that's

what you're thinking.

FOLEY

Why are you mad?

KAREN

Or I did it for some kind of kinky

thrill.  Score with a bank robber the

way some women go for rough trade.

FOLEY

What about

my

motive?  Now I can say I

fucked a US Marshal.  You think I

will?

KAREN

I don't know.

FOLEY

I know of a guy he goes in the bank

holding a bottle he says is

nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash

off a teller, he's on his way out when

he drops the bottle.  It shatters on

the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,

cracks his head and they've got him.

The nitro was canola oil.  I know more

fucked-up bank robbers than ones that

know what they're doing.  I doubt one

in ten can tell a dye pack when he

sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking

morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber

for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd

have to be as dumb as they are.  I

know you're not dumb, so why would I

think that?  Why would

you

think I

might think that?

KAREN

You're not dumb.

FOLEY

I don't know about that.  You can't do

three falls and think you have much of

a brain.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

You getting serious on me now?

KAREN

I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know

what's gonna happen.

FOLEY

(beat)

You know.

KAREN

Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

BUDDY

It took you, what, seven hours to buy

a pair of shoes?

FOLEY

I saw Karen Sisco.

BUDDY

And she saw you?

FOLEY

Yes, she did.

BUDDY

So how's that work, a wanted felon

socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

FOLEY

You know how I felt about her.

BUDDY

Did you give her a jump?  If you did I

might begin to understand where your

head's at.

FOLEY

It wasn't about getting laid.  I just

wanted to know what might've happened

if things were different.

BUDDY

You find out?

FOLEY

Yeah, I did.

BUDDY

So what's that mean?  That you're

disappointed by what you found or you're

sorry you robbed all those banks?

FOLEY

I don't know.

MAURICE

Stick and jab, stick and jab!

WHITE BOY BOB

You drink like a girl.

GLENN

I got to go take a piss.

WHITE BOY BOB

What're you telling us for?  You want

somebody to hold your little pecker?

KAREN

Glenn, are you trying to steal this

car?

GLENN

Jesus, I don't believe it.

KAREN

Another one of those days, huh, nothing

seems to go right?

GLEN

I don't have the keys.

KAREN

I see that.

GLENN

I mean I'm not stealing the fucking

car.

KAREN

You're not?

GLENN

I already stole it.  Last week or

whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't

be stealing it again, can I?

KAREN

The two guys you were with -- that

one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?

I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that

didn't look like him.

GLENN

Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

KAREN

Glenn, I know your life history, who

your friends are, where you've been

and now, it looks like, where you're

going.  Put your hands on the wheel.

GLENN

You're gonna bust me for picking up a

car?

KAREN

For the car, for aiding and abetting a

prison escape, and conspiring to do

whatever you came here for.

GLENN

Listen, these guys, they're gonna be

out here any minute looking for me.

They're fucking animals.

KAREN

What's going on, Glenn?

GLENN

Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck

outta here.

KAREN

But I thought the whole thing was your

idea?

GLENN

Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but

these guys, man, they're into shit I

can't handle.

KAREN

Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?

GLENN

Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at

his office tomorrow, take him out to

his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I

don't give a shit what they do.

KAREN

And is Foley a part of this?

GLENN

He's supposed to be, but he hasn't

shown up yet, which is a good thing

for him.

KAREN

Why's that?

GLENN

Maurice is gonna kill him, try and

collect the reward.

KAREN

(beat)

But you say he hasn't shown up, you

think he backed out?

GLENN

I don't know-- he doesn't exactly

confide in me.

KAREN

Gee, I wonder why not.

GLENN

I'm freezing my ass off.

KAREN

You want to get out of here, run, it'll

warm you up.

GLENN

Really?

KAREN

But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to

me...

GLENN

I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I

believe it.  I keep thinking if you

hadn't driven me to federal court last

summer, you wouldn't even know who I

am.

KAREN

If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow

you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it

that way.  Go on.

MAURICE

Where you been?  You miss the big boys,

come in time for the walkout fights.

Well, shit, you may as well pull up a

chair.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and

this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.

FOLEY

Who's sitting here?

MAURICE

Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he

went to the men's about a while ago

and never came back.

WHITE BOY BOB

I think he must've fell in.

MAURICE

I sent these two looking for him, they

come back shaking their heads.

FOLEY

Well, if he left his coat and he's

been gone a while.

WHITE BOY BOB

The car's still there.  I looked.

MAURICE

(to the ring)

Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push

him off.

FOLEY

We're leaving.

MAURICE

The fuck you talking about?

FOLEY

Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn

is...

MAURICE

Look, what you worried about Glenn

for?  What's he know?

FOLEY

I thought everything.

MAURICE

Glenn knows everything we suppose to

do

tomorrow

.  Glenn could tell somebody

that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.

You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't

know I changed the plan.

(then)

It's happening tonight.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and

pick up what we need and go do it.

FOLEY

(beat)

Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

MAURICE

You got two minutes, that's all.  Make

up your mind.

FOLEY

I wasn't asking permission.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

They want to go tonight, before Glenn

gets in any trouble, opens his big

mouth.

BUDDY

Whatta you wanna do?

BUDDY (CONT'D)

You know they gonna set us up.

FOLEY

I get that feeling, yeah.

BUDDY

But you still think you can get the

diamonds fore they do?

FOLEY

I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here.

Right now.  I'll do the job with the

Snoop, meet you wherever you want and

give you half.

BUDDY

Half for doing what?

FOLEY

Getting me out of Glades for starters.

BUDDY

And who watches your back?

MAURICE

Man has all that reward on his head

and still talks like a con in the yard.

You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a

man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well,

what I say to Jack Foley is buuull

shit

.

FOLEY

That what they're wearing these days

to break and enter?

MAURICE

Break and enter, shit.  Take it and

git, how it's done.  Don't waste any

time.  That's how you do it.

FOLEY

So you've done this before, huh?

MAURICE

Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted

for it.

(then)

White Boy, tell these boys the reason

you went down on that burglary that

time.

WHITE BOY BOB

I left my wallet in the house I robbed.

MAURICE

Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit

and leaves his wallet on the floor.

FOLEY

That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm

very excited about tonight.

MAURICE

Hey.  You learn from doing.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

You know how to use one a these?

FOLEY

I've seen 'em used on TV.

BUDDY

Slow down.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Get ready to grab the wheel when I

shoot this asshole.

MAURICE

Do like he says, man.  Slow down.

KAREN

Shit --

MAURICE

"An army .45 will stop all jive."

Huey P. said that.

BUDDY

You think he was talking about walking

into people's houses when he said it?

MAURICE

(pulls his mask down)

Get ready to go skiing.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Here we go.

FOLEY

Go on in the house before you get hurt.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

There's still time, take me up on my

offer.

BUDDY

I'm not leaving you alone with these

assholes.

WOMAN

I work here.  I'm the maid.

WOMAN/MAID

Fuck off.

KENNETH

Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party.

MAURICE

Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?

MAID

I told you, he isn't here.

MAURICE

Out for the evening?

MAID

He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.

MAURICE

(beat)

When's he due back?

FOLEY

Jesus Christ, what difference does it

make?  You want to wait for him?

MAID

Mr. Ripley's down for the season.

Christmas to Easter.

MAURICE

You here all by yourself?

MAID

(beat)

That's right, just me.

MAURICE

Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his

valuables in.

MAID

I don't have any idea.

MAURICE

Let's go upstairs, have a look at the

man's bedroom.  All right now, you and

Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.

Look at the wall behind any pictures

hanging on it.  Look at the walls in

the closets.  The man has a safe, it's

gonna be up there somewhere.

FOLEY

How about his place in Florida?  If

you'd called, we could've checked his

walls down there before we left.  That

is, if you'd checked to see where he

was.  You follow me?

MAURICE

You set off any kind of alarm and you're

a dead Hazel.  Understand?

KENNETH

What's you name, mama?

MAURICE

First money, then pussy.

FOLEY

You ever wear one of these?

BUDDY

I don't ski.

FOLEY

Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a

look around.

RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE)

I'll send a unit over there, see if

there's anything going on.

KAREN

Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll

meet them there.

CRUZ (PHONE)

Karen, you gonna promise me you're not

gonna go in, do anything stupid till I

get there...

WHITE BOY BOB

Hey--

WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)

I found a rubber.

MAURICE

White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no

diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Where's Foley?

BUDDY

Checkin' the other rooms, like you

said.

MAURICE

(to White Boy)

Go keep an eye on him.

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.

KENNETH

(looking them over)

I don't recognize none of these bands.

MAURICE

Just pick one, put it on.

WHITE BOY BOB

Uh, Foley?

WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)

Cool.

FOLEY

They cut the lines, Richard.

RIPLEY

Foley?  That you?

FOLEY

How are you, Richard?

RIPLEY

Jesus Christ, what the hell are you

doing here?  What's going on?  Who's

upstairs?

FOLEY

Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

RIPLEY

Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

RIPLEY (CONT'D)

Have they got Midge up there?

FOLEY

What kinda man lets a woman answer the

door, this time a night?

RIPLEY

We thought it might be her husband.

Sometimes he comes and checks up on

her.  She told him I was down in

Florida.

FOLEY

A minute or two, you're gonna wish you

were.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Why don't you come on over here, sit

down, Richard, have a look at your

fish.

MAURICE

How do I look, mama?

MAID

Like a fag.

KENNETH

I think she like to tussle with me.

Get boned a way she gonna remember.

MAURICE (OS)

Motherfucker!

MAURICE (CONT'D)

I found the safe.

MAURICE

White Boy!  Get your ass up here!

RIPLEY

What do you want from me, Jack?  Name

it.  You want money?

FOLEY

You gonna write me a check?

RIPLEY

We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a

withdrawal.

BUDDY

They found the safe.

FOLEY

You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?

BUDDY

Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

RIPLEY

Thank you.

MAURICE

We gonna open up this fucker...

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Jesus...!

RIPLEY

(gets up)

Good God... they're shooting Midge!

FOLEY

(pushes him down)

Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open

the safe, not your maid.

MAURICE

A'ight, this time we gotta get the

motherfuckin' trajectory right...

(pause)

Okay, on three:  One... Two...

MAID

The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

MAID (CONT'D)

Richard's birthday.

MAURICE

...the fuck is this...

WHITE BOY BOB

Are they dead?

MAURICE

Go find Foley.  NOW!

RIPLEY

I can't believe you're still angry

with me, Jack, after all this time.

FOLEY

I'm not angry, Richard.

(staring at the tank)

In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing

is, I can't tell if it's the fish

that're cooling me out or all those

uncut diamonds on the bottom of the

tank there.

BUDDY

Damn--

FOLEY

Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about

five million worth in there, wouldn't

you say, Richard?

RIPLEY

Five point two.

BUDDY

They look like plain old rocks.

FOLEY

They sure do.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

Go get a bag.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

I were you, I'd get up and run.

RIPLEY

I'm not leaving Midge.

FOLEY

Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're

gonna kill you.

RIPLEY

If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not

leaving.

(then)

I love her, Jack.

BUDDY

C'mon.

FOLEY

Good luck, Richard.

MAURICE (OS)

Someone down here?

MAURICE (CONT'D)

Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.

RIPLEY

Are those

my

suits?

MAURICE

Where you been hiding, Dick?

BUDDY

Okay.

BUDDY (CONT'D)

Come

on

.

FOLEY

Shit.

BUDDY

What?

FOLEY

They're gonna rape the maid, aren't

they.

BUDDY

From the looks of those boys, the

Ripper too.

FOLEY

And then they'll kill 'em.

BUDDY

At least.

FOLEY

We made it, didn't we?

BUDDY

All you gotta do is get in.

FOLEY

I'm going back inside.

BUDDY

I'll go with you.

FOLEY

No, you dump the van, meet me at the

airport.

I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

BUDDY

Jack --

FOLEY

Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about

to go down, you'll be on the phone

with your sister for a month.  Let me

do this part alone.

FOLEY (CONT'D)

I'm saying this isn't your problem.

Far as I'm concerned, we're square.

BUDDY

Hey...

FOLEY

Now get outta here.

RIPLEY

(hears the scream)

Midge.

MAURICE

Forget about her.  Tell me where the

money's at.

RIPLEY

Foley's got it.

MAURICE

Where the fuck is Foley?

FOLEY

Midge?

RIPLEY

Midge!

MAURICE

(to WBB)

You take the front stairs, I'll take

the back.

MAID

(cold)

Where's Dick?

FOLEY

Downstairs.

(then)

But wait here.  There's two more.

WHITE BOY BOB

Hold it, asshole!

WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)

Drop the gun.

WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)

Now stay right there.  Don't move.

WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)

Maurice!  I got Foley!

WHITE BOY BOB

Maurice!  Up here!

FOLEY

(finally)

You learn from doing.

MAURICE

Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?

FOLEY

Not until recently.

MAURICE

(still coming)

Nervous?

FOLEY

A little.

MAURICE

(getting close)

This kind of setup, you don't have any

idea what the fuck you're doing -- do

you?

FOLEY

You're right.  So why take a chance--

mano a mano

, now using

KAREN

Hello?

CRUZ (PHONE)

We're a few minutes away.  Just sit

tight, stay outta the house till we

get there, understand?

KAREN

Oh-kay...

FOLEY

Shit...

MIDGE (O.S.)

This what you want?

MIDGE (CONT'D)

It's empty.

KAREN (OS)

Maurice--

KAREN (OS)

Jack?

KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)

I know you're up there.

KAREN

Come on, Jack -- don't.

FOLEY

Pretend I'm somebody else.

KAREN

You think I'd shoot you?

FOLEY

If you don't, one of those guys will.

KAREN

What're you now, a desperado?  Put the

guns down.

FOLEY

I told you, I'm not going back.

KAREN

Don't do this.  Please.

FOLEY

No more time outs.

KAREN

You win, Jack.

CRUZ

Karen, I told you not to--

KAREN

Wait, I know him --okay?

KAREN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot

you.

FOLEY

You just did, for Christ sake.

KAREN

You know what I mean.

KAREN (CONT'D)

I wish things were different.  I'm

sorry, Jack.

MIDGE

Richard!

RIPLEY

(sympathetic)

Listen, Jack...

(but then)

What'd you do with my diamonds?

BUDDY

The airport.

DISSOLVE TO:

KAREN (VO)

They don't know yet if they want to

bring him up on the homicides.

KAREN

I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's

put a detainer on him, so when they're

through with him here he'll go back to

Florida.

MARSHALL

You gonna go get him?

KAREN

It's possible.  Why?

MARSHALL

I was just thinking... you could have

a nice time with him on the plane --

like picking up where your interlude,

or whatever you call it, left off.

And then throw him in the can.

KAREN

He knew what he was doing.  Nobody

forced him to rob banks.

MARSHALL

My little girl, the tough babe.

VOICE

Foley.

FEDERAL MARSHAL

Have a nice trip.

(looks OS)

I'll get the other one.

KAREN (OS)

Jack?

KAREN

I got you a present, something for the

road.

KAREN (CONT'D)

I have to take it away, though, soon

as the ride's over.

FEDERAL MARSHAL

Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.

FOLEY

Hejira?

What kinda name is that?

HEJIRA

Islamic.

FOLEY

What's it mean, "No Hair"?

HEJIRA

The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed

from Mecca in 622.

FOLEY

The flight?

HEJIRA

The brothers in Leavenworth gave me

the name.

FOLEY

You were at Leavenworth, huh?

HEJIRA

For a time.

FOLEY

Meaning?

HEJIRA

Meaning time came, I left.

FOLEY

You busted out?

HEJIRA

I prefer to call it an exodus from an

undesirable place.

FOLEY

(interested now)

And how long was it before they caught

up with you?

HEJIRA

That time?

FOLEY

There were others.

HEJIRA

Yeah.  That was the ninth.

FOLEY

(really interested)

The

ninth

?

HEJIRA

Ten, you count the prison hospital in

Ohio I walked away from.

FOLEY

You must be some kinda walker, Henry.

HEJIRA

Hejira.

FOLEY

And so now you're off to Glades.

HEJIRA

Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to

leave last night with the lady marshal,

but for some reason she wanted to wait.

FOLEY

(looks at Karen)

She did, huh.

HEJIRA

Cheaper I guess, take us both down in

one van.

FOLEY

Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought

we'd have a lot to talk about.

HEJIRA

Like what?

FOLEY

I don't know.

(then)

It's a long way down to Florida.
