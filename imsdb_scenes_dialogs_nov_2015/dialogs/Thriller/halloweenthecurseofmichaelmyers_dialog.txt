Danny ...

WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)

Kill for him!

KARA

Danny!

KARA

(continuing)

Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?

DANNY

The voice man!  He's here!

KARA

Danny, no one's there.

JOHN

Some of us have to get some sleep around

here.  What's with that kid?

DEBRA

Let me take him for you, Kara.

KARA

It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.

KARA

Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away

from Danny.  You jerks know the rules.

(crossing to Danny's bed)

Better?

DANNY

Mommy, when can we go home?

KARA

Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new

house.  At least while I'm in college.

Remember our deal.

DANNY

The kids at school said this is a haunted

house -- that a bad man used to live here.

KARA

They did, did they?  Since when did we start

listening to the kids at school?

DANNY

But I've seen him!

KARA

You've been watching too much TV.

DANNY

He says things.  Bad things.

KARA

Like what?

KARA

(continuing)

If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes,

ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll

come around ... Let the bad things you hear

slide right off your back.

DANNY

(sitting up; panicked)

No, Mom -- keep it on!

KARA

Okay ... But just for tonight.

KARA

(continuing)

Good-night, Danny.

WOMAN (V.O.)

I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love

him.  I write to him every week. I think I

even want to have his child --

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're

saying that not only does this guy get you

sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his

offspring?!

WOMAN (V.O.)

Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just

needs someone to understand him.  Someone to

love him.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

You're talking about one of this nation's most

notorious serial killers like he belongs in

some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have

you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been

dead for six years!

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Now we've got someone who claims he's actually

seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller

have a name?

TOMMY

My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old

when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Sounds like you're a candidate for

electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me

after all this time you still believe Myers is

alive?!

TOMMY

Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.

Now it's just a matter of time before he comes

home to kill again.  But this time I'll be

ready.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)

Jamie?  Jamie?!

MARY

Come with me if you want to save your baby.

JAMIE

Oh, God ... He's coming!

MARY

We've got to move.  Now!

MARY

There!  It's that way!

JAMIE

No --

MARY

Save your baby -- go now!

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble

excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"

MOTORIST

Shit!

DWAYNE (V.O.)

I'd just like to say that I listen to your

show every night, Harry.  I think you're the

best.  I can't tell you how excited we are

that you'll be paying a visit to our little

town tomorrow night.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or

should I just keep practicing my wrist

exercises?

DWAYNE

(chortles)

Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say

that I understand how things have changed in

the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your

husband's do- jigger, become a national hero.

But I just can't see any sense in bringing

Halloween back to Haddonfield.

JAMIE

Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!

MOTORIST

Hey, what do you think you're --

MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)

You're coming here for this Halloween fair --

it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for

you, isn't it Harry?  These kids -- they're

not old enough to remember what Myers did

here. They look up to you.  Now you're just

asking for trouble.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

You people really get me.  What are they

putting in the water in that town?

CUT TO:

MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)

All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd

personally like to thank whoever did the

masked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of

money in the long run.

FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)

Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.

It's about time they had a Halloween revival

in this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me

crazy!

MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)

What happened to that psychiatrist of his?

Loomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old

quack was dead.

LOOMIS

Not dead.  Just very much retired.

LOOMIS

(sudden recognition)

What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!

WYNN

Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a

sign for five miles on that road!

LOOMIS

That's the whole idea of living in the

country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

WYNN (O.S.)

Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of

Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his

golden years.  I don't buy it for a single

second, Dr. Loomis.

LOOMIS

And in all these years, I've never known you

to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at

this hour ...

WYNN

Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not

to second-guess the motives of my fellow man.

Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar

is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink

is just a drink.

LOOMIS

I hope you didn't come all the way out here in

this storm just to quote Freud.

WYNN

As always, your keen powers of perception

astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to

celebrate.

(raising his glass)

After thirty-two years as Psychiatric

Administrator, guess who has been named

Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.

LOOMIS

But surely Rogers isn't --

WYNN

Retiring.

LOOMIS

Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one

better suited for the position.

WYNN

Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone

who can bring new life -- and some old blood,

if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our

program ...

WYNN

(continuing)

We need you, Dr. Loomis.

LOOMIS

You should know that it's not wise to play

Halloween pranks on me.

WYNN

You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things

haven't been the same since you left.  I'm

recruiting the best psychiatric team in the

country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change

to finally make a difference.

LOOMIS

Even after my stroke six years ago they

practically had to hold a gun to my head to

get me to retire.  Now things have changed.

I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried.

Why on earth would I want to dig them up

again?

WYNN

Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's

still lurking in your closet.

SHOCK CUT TO:

JAMIE

God ... Help us, please ...

VOICE (V.O.)

You have reached Haddonfield Emergency

Services.  Due to severe weather conditions,

all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is

not an emergency, please dial directly ...

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is

Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the

love of your loins -- and I want to hear from

more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So

give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274.

That's 1-800-URTRASH!

WYNN

But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone,

you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.

LOOMIS

Please try to understand, Terence. I've already

made up my mind.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

So they're trying to kill you and your baby.

Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be

Rosemary.

JAMIE (V.O.)

(intense whisper)

No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming

for me and my baby.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's

coming?

JAMIE (V.O.)

It's ... Michael ...

(releasing)

... Michael Myers!

JAMIE (V.O.)

Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out

there?  Can you hear me?

TALL MAN

Are you all right, young lady?

JAMIE

No!!!

JAMIE

No -- NO!!!

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

JOHN

You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the

hell off my property!  One, two --

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the

Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place

to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So

come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders,

and bogey the night away with me.

MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)

Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest

costume!  Guess who I'm dressed as.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

Your mother?

MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)

No, man -- You!!!

LOOMIS

It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was

Jamie.  Calling for me.

WYNN

You don't know that for sure.  It could have

been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.

LOOMIS

It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew

she would one day.  And whatever has brought

her back has brought Michael back as well.

WYNN

After six years?  Sam, she died with him in

that explosion after the --

LOOMIS

That's what someone wants us to believe, but I

tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I

sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did

all those years as I watched him.  Sitting

behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing

stronger.

(off Wynn's silence)

As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't

go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your

help to stop him.

WYNN

Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis

anything he needs -- files, tests, records of

every treatment ever administered to a former

patient of ours -- Michael Myers.

DAWN

(stunned)

Michael Myers?

WYNN

That's right.  We think there's a very good

chance he might still be alive.

WYNN

(continuing)

Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on

our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We

go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.

(beat)

If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.

LOOMIS

Or what's left of him.

CUT TO:

TIM

Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city.

Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got

everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at

the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.

JOHN

Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed

them ...

DEBRA

Relax, John.  They were just kids.

JOHN

Kids are what's ruining this country.

Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn

respect.

JOHN

(continuing)

See what I'm talkin' about?

DEBRA

You'll never pass that exam on an empty

stomach, Kara.

DEBRA

(continuing; reading)

Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?

What are they teaching in college these days?

The art of going crazy?

KARA

(indignant)

It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this

house is what's driving me crazy.

JOHN

Who the hell told you to come live here in the

first place?

KARA

I'd better get Danny to school.

JOHN

She don't show her face for five years, then

expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You

think going to college is gonna make up for

your mistakes, girl?

DEBRA

John, please don't --

TIM

Yo', just lay off her, Dad.

JOHN

What the fuck --

KARA

Let's go, Danny.

DEBRA

Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit

down?  Try to be a family for once?

KARA

I'm sorry, Mom.

JOHN

That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.

While you're at it, why don't you just give her

all our goddamn money?!

KARA

Stay away from her, you bastard.

JOHN

(re Danny)

I only see one bastard in this house.

TIM

Dad!  Let her go!

DEBRA

John!  Stop it!  Stop it!

WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...

JOHN

You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill

you, you understand?

BETH

Make way for the Hardin County Express.

(following them across the yard)

Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over

the list of events for tonight --

BETH

(continuing)

He do that to you?

KARA

Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the

Strode house.

BETH

Pig.  What the hell happened this time?

BETH

(continuing)

Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.

TIM

Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to

organnize this friggin' fair? It's only

Halloween.

BETH

How many times o I have to tell you? It's not

about Halloween.  It's about being political.

There are too many people with corn-cobs up

their ass in this town telling us what we can

and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us

to set an example.

JOHN

I want her and that kid out of here tonight.

DEBRA

I thought inheriting your father's house ...

the business ... moving out here might change

things.  But you're still the same, John.

(with finality)

Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let

you turn her away again.

TIM

Whatever happened to women in back?

BETH

Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

BETH

(continuing)

See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!

KARA

Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall

from you?

BETH

Why?  You interested?

KARA

No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window.

Watching me.

BETH

You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale

he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary

shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed

up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably

just lonely.

TIM

Or horny.

KARA

Tim, do you always have to act like such an

asshole?

TIM

Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey,

chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.

BETH

Speed kills, asshole!

KARA

Who is that ...

BETH

(bravely)

I've got my pepper spray.

TIM

(relieved)

Happy fuckin' Halloween.

BETH

Someone's trying to scare us out of having this

fair ... and it's not gonna work.

HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)

So they're trying to kill you and your baby.

Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be

Rosemary.

Can you tell me if a bus arrived from

Russellville last night?

ATTENDANT

Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin'

Thank you.

Okay, little guy.  You're okay.

SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)

Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a

visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of

Haddonfield.

WYNN

(pointing)

What is that?

LOOMIS

It's a sign.  He's come home.

DEPUTY

Sir, you'll have to step back.

LOOMIS

Please.  I need to see the sheriff.

WYNN

Official business.

DEPUTY

Wait here.

LOOMIS

(extends his hand)

You must be Sheriff Holdt.

HOLDT

As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it

you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.

LOOMIS

I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the

Chief of Staff at --

HOLDT

Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming.

Now I suggest you fly right on back to your

crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in

my town.

LOOMIS

Michael Myers is my business.

HOLDT

I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis.

Things have been quiet for six years and that's

the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we

need is you spouting off your ghost stories.

LOOMIS

I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A

ghost who called the radio station last night.

Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right

now.

DEPUTY

Sheriff!  She's alive!

LOOMIS

Dear God ... Jamie!

CUT TO:

TIM

Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all

night just to see Harry.

You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?

KARA

I can't find my term paper.

So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time.

Works primo.

BETH

Give us victory or give us death.  See you

tonight, Kara!

KARA

Thorn ...

SHOCK CUT TO:

PARAMEDIC

Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood

loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative

night!

DR. BONHAM

How can this girl still be alive?! Type and

cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT

scan and move her into surgery.

(re Loomis and Wynn)

And get them out of here!

WYNN

Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.

LOOMIS

I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live.

You have to.

TOMMY

I need to see a doctor.

NURSE

What seems to be the problem?

TOMMY

I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been

an accident.

NURSE

What kind of an accident?

TOMMY

(explodes)

Just get me a doctor right now!

WYNN

There's nothing more you can do for her.

WYNN

(continuing)

I'll be right back.

TOMMY (O.S.)

Dr. Loomis!

LOOMIS

Yes?

TOMMY

Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard

her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.

LOOMIS

I'm sorry, but do I know you --

TOMMY

I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode --

Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me

that night --

LOOMIS

Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?

TOMMY

Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael

Myers come home?

LOOMIS

What do you know about Michael?

TOMMY

I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they

want us to believe he's dead.  But I know.

I've always known.

LOOMIS

Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie

Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She

is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --

TOMMY

(gravely)

No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.

TOMMY

(continuing; startled realization)

Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're

living in the Myers house!

TOMMY

(continuing)

I gotta go.

LOOMIS

Tommy, wait!

WYNN

There you are.  Who was that boy?

LOOMIS

An old friend.

CUT TO:

DEBRA

Great.

LOOMIS

I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

LOOMIS

(continuing)

I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is

everything all right in here?

DEBRA

(defensively)

Who are you?

LOOMIS

I've come to help your family.

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name?

Yeah, I think it suits you.

TOMMY

(continuing)

This is worse for me than it is for you.

TOMMY

It's okay, big guy.  Don't you worry. I'm gonna

take care of you.

CUT TO:

LOOMIS

Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he

stabbed his sister to death in 1963.  Here in

this house.  For the next fifteen years, I

became obsessed with finding out what was

living inside of him.  He was my lift's work

and my ultimate failure.  I knew what he was

but I never knew why.

CUT TO:

LOOMIS (V.O.)

There's a living force inside of him. Driving

him.  And I fear that somehow it has been

unleashed again.

CUT TO:

IAN

Who's my next victim?

CUT TO:

LOOMIS

He crept up these stairs and made his way into

this room.  His sister's room. Right here.

Where it all began.

DEBRA

(near tears)

What makes you think he'll come here again?

LOOMIS

This house is sacred to him.  It's the source

of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I

beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same

fast as Laurie and her daughter.

DEBRA

Jamie?  But I thought she was --

LOOMIS

Found this morning.  In a field outside

Haddonfield.  Stabbed.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

IAN

Double or nothing.

IAN

Look how he sits there.  Little freak. Just

like the bogeyman who used to live in his

house.  Are you the bogeyman, Danny?

WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

Kill him, Danny ... Kill him now ...

CUT TO:

LOOMIS (V.O.)

This force which drives him, which keeps him

alive, comes from something more powerful --

more deadly than we can possibly imagine.  The

embodiment of all that is evil.

IAN

You crazy little freak!!!

CUT TO:

DEBRA

What should I do?

LOOMIS

Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your

family as far away from Haddonfield as

possible.

DEBRA

God ... this can't be true.

LOOMIS

Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his

family.  And he won't stop until you are all

destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you

before he did.

DEBRA

John, it's me.  Something terrible has

happened.

JOHN

What is it this time?

DEBRA

A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the

name of Loomis.

DEBRA

He told me about the terrible things that

happened here.  In our house.

JOHN

What the fuck are you doing letting strangers

in without --

DEBRA

John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning!

Someone tried to kill her!

JOHN

What in God's name are you talking about,

woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to

those damned talk shows?

DEBRA

I'm getting the children out of here. At least

until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I

want you to come with us.

I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --

(filtered)

There's more people moving eastbound down Old

Reservoir Road past the elementary school.

LOOMIS

(into walkie-talkie)

Any word on the location of the Strodes?

WYNN (V.O.)

No one's home.  Checked it out myself.

LOOMIS

Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on

that house.

HOLDT

I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way.

You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was

sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge

now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch

you turn this night into some kind of sadistic

witch hunt.

WYNN (V.O.)

Sam, I just got word from the hospital. You'd

better get over there right away.

LOOMIS

(into walkie-talkie)

What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?

WYNN (V.O.)

I'll meet you over there.

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?

KARA

(indignantly; to Tommy)

Do you mind telling me what this is all about?

Tim and Beth are waiting for us.

DANNY

Mom, I want to go to the fair ...

KARA

(to Tommy)

You can't expect us to stay here --

TOMMY

I want you to watch your house.  You can see

everything from this window.

KARA

Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I

supposed to be looking for?

TOMMY

Him.

DANNY

Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun

stuff!

KARA

(snapping)

Danny, you're just going to have to wait!

TOMMY

Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one

more --

(the microwave BEEPS)

-- second.  There you go, big guy.

TOMMY

God, what's wrong with him?

KARA

Here.  Let me try.

KARA

(continuing; fawning)

There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.

TOMMY

Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know.

Now I'm afraid he could be next.

KARA

Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?

TOMMY

Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.

(reaching toward Kyle)

Here.  Look at this.

TOMMY

(continuing)

It was there when I found him this morning.  It

looks like some kind of letter or number or --

KARA

It's a rune ... Thorn.

CUT TO:

LOOMIS

Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should

have left you.

LOOMIS

(continuing)

Now will you do something?!  How many more

innocent people have to die?!

WYNN

Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go.

Come on.

DR. BONHAM

Dr. Loomis?

WYNN

What is it?

DR. BONHAM

I'm very sorry ...

LOOMIS

You let it get to her.  How could you?

DR. BONHAM

Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should

know.  During surgery, we discovered that

Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found

this.

(displays a small vital)

It's placental fluid.

LOOMIS

God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --

DR. BONHAM

I estimate she gave birth no more than a few

hours before the attack.

WYNN

Then where's her baby?

LOOMIS

I think I may already know ...

CUT TO:

KARA

Runes were a kind of early alphabet that

originated in Northern Europe thousands of

years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of

stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes,

Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults

used them in blood rituals to portend future

events and invoke magic.

TOMMY

Black magic ...

(reads)

'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause

sickness, famine and death. Translated

literally, it was the name of a demon spirit

that delivered human sacrifices ... on the

Celtic celebration of Samhain.'

KARA

Halloween.

TOMMY

'When applied directly to another person, Thorn

could be used to call upon them confusion and

destruction -- to literally visit them with the

Devil.'

KARA

(terrified)

Where are you going?

TOMMY

To find the rest of your family before Michael

Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling

him.

KARA

Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the

hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out

right behind her.

KARA

Danny?!  Danny!

TOMMY

Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy

who came in with me and --

KARA

(grabs him)

Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me

where you're going!

MRS. BLANKENSHIP

The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the

other little boy who used to live in that

house.

TOMMY

Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait

for me.

(beat)

And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to

your house.

JOHN

... Pretty woman, walking down the street ...

Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.

JOHN

Damn kid ... this is my house ...

JOHN

(continuing)

What the fuck ...

(yelling inside)

... Debra, open this goddamn door before I

break it down!  You got to three ...

(no response)

... One ... Two ...

(still no response)

... Two and a half ...

JOHN

Debra -- I'm home!

JOHN

(continuing; mutters)

Work all day and not even any supper ...

JOHN

All right ... You can all come out now ...

JOHN

What is this shit?

JOHN

So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go

ahead.  Keep it up all night ...

JOHN

Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!

JOHN

(continuing)

When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna

wish you were never born!

JOHN

(continuing)

Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.

JOHN

What the hell --

CUT TO:

HARRY SIMMS

(into mike)

I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of

tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing

you've finally pulled Halloween out of the

closet?

TIM

(into mike)

Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here

with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the

ultimate juice!

HARRY SIMMS

I'll remember that the next time my wife tells

me I didn't make her climax.

BETH

(impassioned)

What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand

against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield,

but for every town in the nation.  Our

generation will not let the powers-that-be

control our minds, dictate what clothes we

wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays

we celebrate.

HARRY

(off-handedly)

Have you ever considered running for public

office?

CUT TO:

KARA

Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the

little boy who used to live across the street?

KARA

(continuing; insistent)

Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!

MRS. BLANKENSHIP

He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.

KARA

What voice?  What are you talking about?

MRS. BLANKENSHIP

The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one

that told him to kill his family.

WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Stop that man!  Stop him!!!

HOLDT

Throw down the gun!  Now!!!

TOMMY

Stop that man!  He's the one!

TIM

Who's gettin' busted?

BETH

Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.

TIM

Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my

sister?

BETH

(worried)

Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd

better go home and check on them. There's

nothing else for us to do here.

TIM

But they're gonna light the tree in a few

minutes --

BETH

(suggestively)

We can light our own tree at home.

CUT TO:

MRS. BLANKENSHIP

I was baby-sitting for him that night. Little

Mikey Myers from across the street.  That's

when the voice told him what to do.  Same as

his great- grandfather.

KARA

His what?!

MRS. BLANKENSHIP

Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to

this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his

family in that very same house.  Then the

townspeople burned him alive.  Our mother

always told us when we were children, 'Don't go

near the Myers house.'  We never did.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOOMIS

Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.

HOLDT

What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?

LOOMIS

Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.

SHOCK CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

HOLDT

You'd better as fuck have an explanation for

this, Doctor.

TOMMY

Dr. Loomis, there's something you should

know --

LOOMIS

I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth

and take me to that baby.

TOMMY

Oh my God --

LOOMIS

Tommy!

TOMMY

Get them out of there!  Get out!!!

TOMMY

Oh, God -- Kara!!!

CUT TO:

DANNY

Mommy, I'm scared.

KARA

There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another

storm.  Try to get some sleep.

DANNY

I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.

KARA

No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.

DANNY

Promise?

KARA

(kisses him)

I promise.

KARA

Beth, are you in there?

BETH

(coming up for air)

Guess they -- went to the fair after all.

TIM

(hot and heavy)

Guess so ...

BETH

What if your parents come home?

TIM

Then they can watch.

BETH

Aren't you gonna answer that?

TIM

Answer what?

BETH

(fends him off)

What if it's Kara?

TIM

Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a

rope.

BETH

(into phone)

Hello?

KARA

(into phone)

Mom -- Who is this?

BETH (V.O.)

Kara? ... No, this is Beth.

KARA

What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?

BETH

We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if

you were --

KARA (V.O.)

Is Tim there?

BETH

He's in the bathroom.

KARA

I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to

listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right

now.

WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

BETH

Kara, what the hell is going on?

KARA

Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right

behind you!

KARA

Danny, no!!!

KARA

(the faintest whisper)

Danny?

KARA

(intense whisper)

Come on ... Danny, please.

KARA

Danny, run!!!

KARA

Danny, come to Mommy.

DANNY

Mommy!!!

KARA

Danny, help me!

WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)

Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

KARA

Danny!!!

KARA

Please!  Open the door!

TOMMY

The baby -- where's the baby?!

KARA

Please!  Somebody help us!

KARA

Help us please!!!

LOOMIS

Get them upstairs.  Now!

KARA

Where's the baby?!

TOMMY

He's gone.

TOMMY

(continuing)

Who else knew I had the baby?!

LOOMIS

No one.

TOMMY

No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!

LOOMIS

Only me --

(dark realization)

-- and Dr. Wynn.

LOOMIS

(continuing)

Wynn!!!

LOOMIS

(continuing)

Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!

TOMMY

No!!!

DANNY

Mommy!  Please help me!

KARA

Danny!  Danny, where are you?!

TOMMY

Kara, no!

KARA

Danny, no ... please ...

KARA

Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

DAWN

Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting

inside.

WYNN

What is this all about?  Remove those!

LOOMIS

Where's the child?

WYNN

Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday

happily retired, today right back in the thick of things.

Somehow I knew you still had it in you.

WYNN

(continuing)

Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know

how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your

upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I

felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.

(gestures to his staff)

After all, you're the only one around here who's still in

the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell

you, but you've really given me no other choice.

LOOMIS

This is madness, Wynn.

WYNN

Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way

things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by

your own reality to see.

(beat)

But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in

many ways.

(smiles)

You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.

Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his

work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last

time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible

time we had getting him out of that jail cell.

LOOMIS

It was you.

WYNN

(lights a cigarette)

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

LOOMIS

Why did you take Jamie?

WYNN

She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her

veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I

incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has

served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.

LOOMIS

Jamie's baby ...

WYNN

There you go trying to make sense again.

(grimly entranced)

It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations.

As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

LOOMIS

Samhain.

WYNN

And I'm its deliverer.

(slams his key card on the desk)

Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it.

Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

WYNN

(continuing)

I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so

much more for you to try to make sense of.

WYNN

Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I

tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.

WYNN

(continuing)

Michael -- Rise.

WYNN

(continuing)

Michael -- Pain.

WYNN

(continuing)

Michael -- Kill.

LOOMIS

You've created a monster.

WYNN

Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

WYNN

(continuing)

We're not the only ones, you know. There are many

believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be

amazed to know how far it reaches.

TOMMY

Holy shit ...

WYNN

(prophetically)

Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of

the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our

great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.

WYNN

Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this

ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of

Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and

show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of

Innocent Blood.

KARA

Danny!!!

WYNN

Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon

thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy

Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.

WYNN

(continuing)

Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.

KARA

Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember,

don't you?

KARA

(continuing)

Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told

you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice

forever.

WYNN

Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!

KARA

Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!

WYNN

Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!

LOOMIS

No!!!

WYNN

Stay away, Sam.

LOOMIS

Leave the boy.  Take me.

WYNN

(smiles trenchantly)

Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.

DANNY

Mommy!!!

KARA

Danny!!!

LOOMIS

Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!

TOMMY

This way!

KARA

What now?!

TOMMY

(realization)

Wait a minute ...

KARA

Come on!

TOMMY

(tries it again)

It's not working!

TOMMY

(continuing)

Someone's controlling it!

KARA

How will we ever find him?

FADE OUT.
