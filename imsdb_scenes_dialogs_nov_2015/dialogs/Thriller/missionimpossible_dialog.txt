FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

16TH AUGUST 1995

KIEV

ANATOLY

Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called

us.

KASIMOV

(sobbing)

I don't remember what happened!  We were

at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having

fun.

KASIMOV

I don't even know how I got here.

I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I

didn't lay a finger on her.

ANATOLY

Kasimov.  Don't flounder.

JACK

Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come

on, come on!

KASIMOV

You're the only one who can help me.

ANATOLY

C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.

KASIMOV

They'll kill me.

ANATOLY

You asked for my help.  You

asked

for

my

help...come on...

KASIMOV

You're right, of course.

JACK

The name pal...give us the name.

KASIMOV

The contact in Minsk..the contact in

Minsk..works in a travel agency.

JACK

Come on!

ANATOLY

Come on!

KASIMOV

His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.

ANATOLY

Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...

JACK

Got him.

ANATOLY

Now, we drink.

ANATOLY (CONT'D)

To friends.

KASIMOV

Yes, Anatoly, yes.

JACK

Cheers.

ETHAN

(in English now)

Get rid of this scum.

CLAIRE

Did we get it?

ETHAN

We got it.  On your feet.

CLAIRE

I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.

ETHAN

Walk, just walk.  Start walking.

CLAIRE

I'm walking.

ETHAN

Talking's good, walking's better.

CLAIRE

Sleeping's better.

CLAIRE

Are

you

all right Ethan.  What's wrong

with you?

ETHAN

If you're gonna do this again Claire,

It's not gonna be on my watch.

CLAIRE

Oh yeah?

JACK

Claire.

ETHAN

Jack.

ETHAN

IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT

OUT OF HERE YET?!

JACK

Just waiting for you, tubs.

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off

at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight

thousand feet-and we should be arriving

in Prague right on schedule.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

(CONT'D)

Would you like to watch a movie Mr

Phelps?

PHELPS

No, I prefer the theatre.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you consider the cinema of the

Ukraine?

PHELPS

Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

KITTRIDGE

(on the tape)

Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're

about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn --

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

-- a former KGB Line X officer now

working the international black market

selling intelligence.  This morning, we

learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half

of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non-

official cover agents working in Eastern

Europe.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

For security reasons, the NOC list is

divided into two encoded halves.

Golitsyn already has the cryptonym

portion, which contains agent code names

and targeting areas.  This portion is

useless unless combined with the second

half -- the true name list that is kept

in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the

true name list at an Embassy function

tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you

decide to accept it, is to obtain

photographic proof of the theft, apprehend

those involved, and return the stolen

list.  I don't have to stress the

importance of this matter, Jim.  We're

keeping it internally black. Because of

its urgency, I've already sent to Prague

a team selected from your usual group.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Ethan Hunt will of course be your point

man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're

getting word to him now.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

As always, should you or any member of

your IM force be caught or killed, the

Secretary will disavow all knowledge of

your actions.  This tape will self-

destruct in five seconds.  Good luck,

Jim!

CUT TO:

PRAGUE

JACK

Look to your right, then back to me.

There's a camera built right into the

bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and

transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

SARAH

Of course I can hear you.

JACK

No, in your...ear piece. You have a

lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me

now?

SARAH

Loud and clear.

JACK

What's going on?

SARAH

I don't know.

JACK

Why don't you take a look?

SARAH

Jack...that's spying.

JACK

That's what we do isn't it?

SARAH

Jack you're so wicked.

JACK

Too wicked to have a drink later?

SARAH

I think I might just take that look.

ETHAN

Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more

than ninety days leave coming.

PHELPS

A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is.

Take it all, if you want.

After

this one.

ETHAN

I thought I'd take some now.

PHELPS

(quietly, to Ethan)

What the hell's made you decide to take

your leave at the worst possible time?

Claire's in a weird mood too.

ETHAN

Oh?  What's the problem?

PHELPS

I don't know, I had to go to Chicago

again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.

ETHAN

Tell you what?

PHELPS

When you started noticing your short term

memory loss.  What

the problem was

you

and Claire had in Kiev?

ETHAN

What problem?

PHELPS

(laughs)

Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking

burnout here?

ETHAN

I guess.

PHELPS

Ethan, you

can't

burn out.

ETHAN

Why not?

PHELPS

Because I can't afford it. And because

you'd burn up before you'd burn out.

ETHAN

How was Chicago?

PHELPS

Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto

dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the

one about the astronaut who comes back

from the first manned flight to Mars

after two years?  His wife's got a year

old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was

it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,

it was my friend Sammy."  She says it

wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my

friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter,

don't you think I have any friends of my

own?!"

PHELPS (CONT'D)

Boy, you really are grim. Come here,

take a look.

PHELPS (CONT'D)

Beyond Charles Bridge there is our

Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if

anything goes wrong, this guy will steal

the names of our agents in every country

all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to

the highest bidders -- third world

terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords --

any and everybody who'd love to get rid

of long term coverts like us, and some

very dear friends among them.  If they're

exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over

here.  Take a lock at this.

SENATOR WALTZER

I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA

and all its shadow organizations have

become irrelevant at best and

unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we

throw a little light on the whole concept

of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These

covert agency subgroups have confidential

funding, they report to no one --

who are

these people

?!  We

were

living in a

democracy the last time I checked.

ETHAN

You're going to use Walter?

PHELPS

He's our guy.

ETHAN

Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?

PHELPS

Not this week. This week he's flyfishing

at the Oughterard Slough in County

Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.

ETHAN

He won't be back in a hurry?

PHELPS

No, not in a hurry.  What do you think?

You think the plot'll work?

ETHAN

Sure.  If the main character does.

PHELPS

If you were me, Ethan, who would

you

trust to make him believable?

JACK

Sorry, am I interrupting?

ETHAN

Always.

JACK

Stick of gum. If you come up against a

lock you can't pick --

JACK (CONT'D)

Red light.  Green light.  Mash them

together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on

you -- you have five seconds.

PHELPS

Are you gonna take it?

ETHAN

(relenting)

Give me the God damn gum.

JACK

Just don't chew it.

PHELPS

Thank you.

CUT TO:

a gray metal box

, protruding from the wall one floor up.

PHELPS

Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by

twenty-three hundred.

DIPLOMAT

How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman,

the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just

steer you through the reception line here

--

DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)

Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the

director of the National Gallery -- Petr

Brandl, the mayor of Prague --

SARAH

I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator?

SENATOR WALTZER

Of course I do.  How are you, Miss

Norman?

SARAH

He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me.

PHELPS

Sarah, mark the package and go to two.

SARAH

Your advance team mentioned you'd want a

tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead

and set that up for you --

SENATOR WALTZER

Terrific.  Let's get going.

(to the Diplomat)

Will you excuse us?

DIPLOMAT

Uh, sir?

JACK

Great.  Come on.

PHELPS

Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go.

HANNAH

En route.

PHELPS (O/S)

Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to

night vision).

JACK

Governor's in position.  We have the elevator.

GUARD

Excuse me, can I help you?

SARAH

-- which leads directly to the Denied

Area, the only limited access area in the

whole facility.

SARAH (CONT'D)

As you can see. this area has both a

Marine guard and video surveillance, and

is strictly monitored at all times.

SARAH (CONT'D)

(covering)

Senator, don't you have a young man on

your staff named

JACK

?

ETHAN

Jack

?  I believe we did have a young man

named

Jack

.  Not a reliable man, as I

recall.  Constantly late or behind in his

work.

GUARD

Excuse me, let me see that ID again!

PHELPS (O.S.)

Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a

second.  Keep dancing.

ETHAN (O.S.)

(with the Senator's southern accent)

We were forced to tie him to my best

stallion and drag him around the barn a

few times.

JACK

Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on

it.

IDENTITY CONFIRMED

GUARD

Oh. Sorry, sir.

JACK

The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely

off.

PHELPS

(a touch of impatience)

Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah.

HANNAH

He's heading to the denied area.

ETHAN

(to Sarah)

Higher.  Higher.

SARAH

Higher.

ETHAN

Right, right.  Good.

PHELPS

Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you.

ETHAN

Jack we're in position.

ETHAN

Jack.  Jack.

JACK

I didn't touch it.

PHELPS

(tension rising)

He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box!

ETHAN

OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open

the doors.

SARAH

What about my coat?  I'll freeze.

JACK (O.S.)

I don't have it.

PHELPS

Opening the doors.  Go under.

ETHAN

He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.

JACK (O.S.)

Give me a break, Pops.

SARAH

Such a nice ass.

JACK (O.S.)

And a lonely ass.

ETHAN

Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport

in five minutes.

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Roger that.

ETHAN

In position.  Jack open the door, let the

package roll.

JACK (O.S.)

Roger that.  Opening doors now.

ETHAN

Stairway, youire wrapped, go to

transport.

HANNAH

En route.

JACK

Hey.

PHELPS

Jack, what are you doing?!

JACK

Iim not doing anything!  (I donit have it

either).

PHELPS

I donit have it --

I donit have

control

!

JACK

Uh -- then I have a problem.

ETHAN

Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do

you hear me.

ETHAN (O.S.)

Come on, Jack, come on.

ETHAN

Jim.  Jim.  Heis in the open.

PHELPS (O.S.)

ETHAN

Can you lose him?

PHELPS (O.S.)

No.  Abort.

ETHAN

Jim we canit.

PHELPS (O.S.)

Abort.  Thatis an order.

ETHAN

PHELPS (O.S.)

No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!

ETHAN

Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iim

coming to you.

SARAH

Jim gave an abort, we should walk

away.

ETHAN

No, weire going to recover the disk,

understand?!  Now move!

PHELPS (O.S.)

Where are you?

ETHAN

About two hundred yards from the bridge.

PHELPS (O.S.)

Theyire covering this frequency, Ethan.

Go ahead.

ETHAN

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Whois dead?

ETHAN

My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -

- Hannah, maybe, I -- donit know

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Are you damaged?

ETHAN

They knew we were coming.  Golitsynis

dead too.  The disk is gone.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Are you intact

?

ETHAN

Do you read me?

The list is in the open

!

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Let's just bring you in safely, and then

we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you

followed?

ETHAN

I donit think so.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Donit

think

, be

sure

.  Are you clean?

ETHAN

Yes.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Location green.  One hour.  Iill be there

myself.

ETHAN

Youire in Prague?

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donit

disappoint me.

ETHAN

No sir.

KITTRIDGE (O.S.)

One hour.

KITTRIDGE

I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know

how much Jim in particular meant to you,

Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.

ETHAN

Yeah.

KITTRIDGE

Passport, visas - you know the drill.

We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada,

debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague

police a bone, you know toss them a few

suspects.  Follow me?

ETHAN

Yeah.  I follow you.

KITTRIDGE

We've lost enough agents for one night.

ETHAN

You mean

I've

lost enough agents for one

night.

KITTRIDGE

You seem hell bent on blaming yourself,

Ethan.

ETHAN

Who else is left?

KITTRIDGE

Yes.  I see your point.

ETHAN

Why was there another team?

KITTRIDGE

What?

ETHAN

Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.

KITTRIDGE

I don't quite follow you.

ETHAN

Let's see if you can follow me around

this room.

(eyes moving around the room)

The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7

and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing

around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11.

The waiter behind Hannah at the top of

the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The

other IMF team.  You're worried about me.

Why

?

KITTRIDGE

(a tight little smile)

You're right.  Maybe this'll save some

time.

KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)

For a little over two years now we've

been spotting serious blowback in IMF

operations.  We have a penetration.  The

other day we decoded a message on the

Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

ETHAN

The arms dealer.

KITTRIDGE

That's right.  Max, it seems, has two

unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity

and for corrupting susceptible agents.

This time he's gotten to someone on the

inside - he's put himself in a position

to buy our NOC list. An operation he

referred to as "Job 314".  The job he

thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.

ETHAN

But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

KITTRIDGE

Correct the actual list is safe at

Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod,

one of ours.

ETHAN

This whole operation was a molehunt.

KITTRIDGE

Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like

you said.  You survived.

KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)

I want to show you something, Ethan.

KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)

Since your father's death, your family's

farm has been in sub-chapter S and now,

suddenly, they're flush with over a

hundred and twenty grand in the bank.

Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped

out the bank account -- dying slowly in

America after all, can be a very

expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why

don't we go quietly out of here onto the

plane...

ETHAN

How about if we just go quietly into the

bathroom and I wash your mouth out with

soap - you pathetic button down

bureaucratic asshole.

KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)

Ethan, I can understand you're very

upset.

ETHAN

Kitteridge, you've never seen me very

upset.

ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While

KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand.

KITTRIDGE

All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've

bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on

intimate loyalties to get away with it.

You're determined to shake hands with the

devil and I'm going to make sure you do

it in hell.

Ethan, what are you doing?

PHELPS (CONT'D)

I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the

bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan?

Ethan?

CLAIRE

.

ETHAN

What are you doing here?!

CLAIRE

(carefully)

Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire.

Ethan what's wrong with you?

ETHAN

Don't move.

ETHAN

You were in the car!

CLAIRE

I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in

trouble on the radio.  He said someone

was...

ETHAN

Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the

car.

CLAIRE

No, I got out of the car and I ran to the

bridge.

ETHAN

Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.

CLAIRE

What happened to Jim?

ETHAN

There was nobody on the bridge.

CLAIRE

What happened to Jim?

ETHAN

Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire!

Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all

dead!

CLAIRE

(mumbling)

They're dead.  Jim's dead.

ETHAN

Take off your coat.

CLAIRE

What?

ETHAN

Take off your God damn coat!

ETHAN (CONT'D)

Where were you?

CLAIRE

I walked away.  He said abort.  He was

gone so I walked away.

ETHAN

That was four hours ago!  Who sent you?

Did they send you here?

CLAIRE

(slowly)

Who is "they?"

ETHAN

Did they send you...Did they send you?

CLAIRE

Who is they, who is they?

ETHAN grabs her by the wrists.

ETHAN

Who sent you?!  Who sent you?

CLAIRE

(screaming)

No one sent me!  We're supposed to be

back here at four o'clock, four o'clock,

if we abort, we don't return here until

four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am,

four o'clock --!

CLAIRE

Why haven't they brought us in yet?

ETHAN

I've been disavowed.  They think I killed

Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred

thousand dollars found its way into my

parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes

I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've

been in the employ of an arms dealer,

Max, for the last two years, to get him

our NOC list.

CLAIRE

What are you going to do?

ETHAN

I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the

mole is, I think goes by the name of Job,

at least part of the time. 1 can't find

him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list,

he'll find me.

CLAIRE

Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me

go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going

to tell him you had nothing to do...

ETHAN

Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not

dead, he's going to assume you're with

me.

?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M.

CLAIRE

The message is for Job.

ETHAN

I'm going to answer it.

ETHAN

Excuse me, could I trouble you for a

match?

MATTHIAS

Would you remove your hat please?

ETHAN

Why?

MATTHIAS

You wish to meet Max?  This is the price

of admission.

ETHAN

I thought I was going to see Max.

MATTHIAS

You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.

ETHAN

Then what am I doing here?

MATTHIAS

Allowing Max to see you and hear what

you've got to say.

ETHAN

I don't communicate very well through a

shroud.

MATTHIAS

If Max doesn't like what you have to say,

you'll be wearing that shroud

indefinitely.

ETHAN

I'm willing to take the chance.

MATTHIAS

Very well.

MAX

Who are you and what are you doing here?

ETHAN

I need one hundred thousand dollars.

MAX

Really?  And you thought if you simply

showed up I might give it to you?

ETHAN

Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and

twenty five thousand.

MAX

The penny drops.

You

are

not

Job.  Yes,

Job is not given to quoting Scripture in

his communications. And there was its

tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is

not playful.  So you're something of a

paradox.

ETHAN

That depends.

MAX

On what?

ETHAN

Whether you like a paradox.  I want a

hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

MAX

It's quite out of the question.

ETHAN

The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's

bait, part of an internal molehunt.

MAX

And how might you know that?  Are you

another Company man?

ETHAN

Like Job?

MAX

Ah, but, we're asking about you.

ETHAN

I'm NOC.  Was.

Now

disavowed.

MAX

Why, may I ask?

ETHAN

That's the question I want to ask Job.

MAX

I don't know Job any more than he knows

me.

ETHAN

Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an

introduction.

MAX

Why should I?

ETHAN

Because I can deliver the actual NOC

list.  The one you have is not only

worthless, it's certain to be equipped

with a homing device to pinpoint your

exact location.

MAX

It's easy to say the disk is worthless

when you say I can't look at the

information and

see

if it's worthless.

Not a tenable position, sir.

ETHAN

Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from

thirty seconds to ten minutes you're

gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping

around you like jackrabbits.

MAX

(Pause.)

Mm - Hmmm...

ETHAN

Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner

you used in the car?

MAX

Very good.

ETHAN

Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up

first.

MATTHIAS

Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so

good.

MAX

That's not so good for you, my friend.

MATTHIAS

Thirty-two and change.

MAX

(to Ethan)

Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just

be the hard drive heating up.

MATTHIAS

Forty-four.  Forty-five.

ETHAN

I'd say you've got about two minutes.

MATTHIAS

Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine.

FEMALE IMF

(in czech)

Switch it on.  Keep cleaning.

KITTRIDGE

GOD D-

MAX

Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use

one of his apartments again.

(turns to Ethan)

Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy.

You're a good sport.  Do accept the

compliment.

ETHAN

Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?

MAX

I don't have to tell you what a comfort

anonymity can be in my profession -- like

a warm blanket.

(abruptly)

My deal with Job was subject to a

successful boot scan.  Obviously it

didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.

ETHAN

What was your deal with Job?

MAX

Six million dollars.  I'll give you the

same.  But I want the complete list now,

not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this

piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want

the

entire

list, the true name of every

non-official cover agent throughout the

world.

ETHAN

Ten

million.  Ten million in negotiable

U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer

form, coupons attached.  And one more

thing -- your personal assurance that Job

will be at the exchange.

MAX

Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want

it by the end of the week.

ETHAN

How will you make sure Job will be there?

MAX

How will you make sure I'll have the list

in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now

where can I drop you dear boy?

ETHAN

I'm not being dropped anywhere without my

money.

MAX

I'm going to have to front you

personally.  Don't lose that money

KITTRIDGE

What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the

airport?  How many identities do you

think Hunt has?  How many times has he

slipped past custom, in how many

countries?  These guys are trained to be

ghosts.

We

taught them how to do it, for

Christ's sake!

BARNES

So what do you suggest?

KITTRIDGE

Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make

him come to us.  Everybodyis got pressure

important to him personally and you

If we're going to Virginia, why don't we

ETHAN

Luther, I guess you're all out of

I can't just hack my way inside.  There's

no modem access to the mainframe, it's in

a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically

at the terminal.

ETHAN

Luther, relax, it's worse than you think.

The terminal's in black vault lock-down.

ETHAN (V.O.)

They missed nothing in that room.  Even

the vents have laser nets over them.

ETHAN (V.O.)

Inside, there are three countermeasure

systems that can only be deactivated by

authorized entry.  Which we won't have.

ETHAN (V.O.)

The first system is sound-sensitive,

anything above a whisper sets it off.

The second system is on the floor and

pressure-sensitive --

ETHAN (V.O.)

--and the third detects any increase in

temperature.  Even the body heat of an

unauthorized person in the room will

trigger it.

ETHAN (V.O.)

All three systems are state of the art.

LUTHER

And you really think we can do this.

It's cash. And a second passport. If

anything goes wrong when we're inside, if

you sense even the slightest deviation

You didn't have to.........

ANCHOR

The unlikely setting...a farm in the

heartland of America...the State of

Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to

have broken the brain trust behind an

international drug ring.  For a report we

go live now to CNN correspondent (Joe

Jones) in the state capitol, Madison.

(Joe)...?

REPORTER

Authorities have identified the couple as

Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt.

REPORTER

Here they are now.

REPORTER

They were apprehended this morning by the

DEA in a major sting operation for the

illegal manufacture of the drug

methcathinone, known on the street as

"cat".

VOICE (O.S.)

Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen

by officials as one of the most powerful

and dangerous drugs in the world.  Some

thirty-four cat labs have been seized so

far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt

and her brother-in-law are believed to be

involved in a global drug distribution

network.

REPORTER

Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment

please.

PUBLIC OFFICIAL

I think it's sad, really.  Farmers,

unless they're a conglomerate, are always

operating on a paper-thin margin.  I'm

afraid what we have here is a case of a

naive and lonely widow with a lot of

financial problems who chose to make

money through illegal means.

REPORTER

That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in

charge of this investigation.  Officials

tell me that international law

enforcement agents are expected to arrive

here later today to question the Hunts.

This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison,

Wisconsin.

ETHAN VO

No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah

himself.

ETHAN

Why, Jim?

Why?

..when you think about it, Ethan, it was

inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more

secrets you keep from everyone but

yourself, operations you answer to no one

but yourself.  Then one morning you wake

up and find out the President of the

United States is running the country -

can.  Not til this is over.  Thereis too

much at stake, Ethan.

But, he didnit know about you.  In all

fairness, Ethan, Claire was never

convinced her charms would work with you.

But I was supremely confident - having

tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet

thy Neighbouris wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan

is in love with you, Claire, make no

mistake about it.  And like all the

worldis lovers, heis tortured by the

same, one pathetic question - "does she

feel the same way I do?"

exploiting his feelings or returning

them?

CLAIRE

It was me.  I did it.

PHELPS

Satisfied?

CLAIRE

All ten million.

PHELPS

Fold it.  Fold it tight.

ETHAN

Arenit you going to thank me Jim.  Ten

million is better than six.

PHELPS

Donit flatter yourself - six was for

Eastern Europe

.  You made a lousy deal -

ten for the world?  What is that?  But I

needed you for the transfer with Max.  I

got a little extra change;  and you got a

little extra too.

pay, give me a promotion, check out my

office at Langley and

then

, maybe, talk

about it.

ETHAN

(laughing)

It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?

LUTHER

Why don't you come back with me?

ETHAN

Just don't know why I'd be doing it.

LUTHER

You really liked Phelps, didn't you?

ETHAN

He was a good guy for a long, long time.

Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta

catch my flight..(rising)

So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen

again?

LUTHER

Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss

being disreputable.

ETHAN

Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any

better I'll always think of you that way.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you like to watch a movie, Miss

Clarke?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to

watch a movie.

ETHAN

No, thank you.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Would you consider the cinema of the

Caribbean?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Aruba, perhaps?
