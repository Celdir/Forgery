1   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Day breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of

adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel

and a large bundle wrapped in cloth.

He walks past a corral made out of branches, where several

goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.

2   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Abdullah (40), opens.

HASSAN

(In Arabic)

Good morning Abdullah... I brought

you this...

He holds up the bundle.

3   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Abdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a

small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting

some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her

daughters.

Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting

on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-

conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.

HASSAN

(To Abdullah)

It's almost new.

He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

Three hundred cartridges...

He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

The hunter who gave it to me said

you can hit up to three kilometers

away.

ABDULLAH

How much do you want for everything?

HASSAN

One thousand dirhams.

2.

ABDULLAH

One thousand dirhams? I'll give you

one thousand and a goat.

Abdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles.

4   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY

Hassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan

stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards

away and he turns toward Abdullah.

HASSAN

With this rifle, your sons will be

able to kill plenty of jackals.

He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding

the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to

fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks

and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far

wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.

Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

Let one of your sons shoot.

Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.

ABDULLAH

Let Yussef shoot.

When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts

him off, upset.

AHMED

I want to shoot first.

Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without

realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy

grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.

HASSAN

Look, load it like this.

Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes

it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

This is the safety. Push it in when

you're ready.

Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,

almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far

from the rock. His sisters laugh.

3.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

If he doesn't hit the jackals, at

least he'll scare the shit out of

them.

Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to

Yussef enthusiastically.

ABDULLAH

Your turn.

Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts

the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems

innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet

hits just below the rock.

Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot

better than you.

5   EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATER

Yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and

gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches

and gives Abdullah a bag.

YASIRA

Your lunch.

Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.

ABDULLAH

You better kill at least three

jackals.

HASSAN

And make sure no one sees you with

the rifle, hide it if you see someone

approach you.

Ahmed nods.   Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.

6   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER

Yasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some

goatskins stretched out on some branches.

Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate

and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.

AHMED

Yussef, Yussef...

4.

7    EXT. SIDE WALL, YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

8    INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

AHMED (O.S.)

Yussef...

9    EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY

AHMED

What are you doing?

AHMED (CONT'D)

I told you not to spy on her again.

AHMED (CONT'D)

I said don't spy on her.

YUSSEF

What the hell do you care?

AHMED

Come on, let's go.

10   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

AHMED

Five to two.

5.

YUSSEF

There's a jackal over there.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

Over there.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

What are you doing, you idiot?

11   EXT. DESERT -- LATER

YUSSEF

Zora doesn't mind.

AHMED

She doesn't, but I do.

YUSSEF

This is between her and me.

AHMED

You're both pigs. Next time I'm

going to tell my dad.

YUSSEF

Stay out of this.

AHMED

If you want me to stay out of it,

don't do it.

12   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

6.

When he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and

startles him. He quickly pulls his pants up and another

shot rings out. Yussef gets up to see what his brother is

doing.

Ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards

away. He fires a third time.

Yussef runs up to him.

YUSSEF

What are you doing?

Ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the

distance.

AHMED

Hassan said that it could hit things

three kilometers away, but it can't

even reach that rock over there.

YUSSEF

That's because you don't know how to

shoot. Give me the rifle.

Ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle

over. Yussef aims and fires. The shot echoes through the

vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.

AHMED

See, it can't reach it.

YUSSEF

Give me another bullet.

Yussef aims and fires. The bullet hits the rock and kicks

up a lot of whitish dust.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

See.

AHMED

Yeah, but that's not three kilometers.

Ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the

top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a

moment and then calls his brother.

AHMED (CONT'D)

Yussef, come here.

Yussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the

distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out

a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.

7.

AHMED (CONT'D)

I bet you the bullet can't hit that

far away.

Ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.    He fires and

nothing.

AHMED (CONT'D)

These fucking bullets aren't any

good.

YUSSEF

You're not aiming right.

Yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

What'll you give me if I hit that

car?

AHMED

I'll shoot.

Ahmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He

fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle.

AHMED (CONT'D)

You see?    Nothing happens.

YUSSEF

Let me shoot.

He also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and

shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing.

AHMED

I told you.    Hassan's a liar.

A bus approaches.    Ahmed points at it.

AHMED (CONT'D)

Shoot at that one...

Yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,

raises the weapon, aims and fires.

The bus drives on.    Ahmed turns to his brother.

AHMED (CONT'D)

See: nothing.

The bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly

stops in the middle of the road.

Mrs. Susan?... No sir, don't worry...

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Your dad is calling.

MIKE

Hi dad... dad, guess what? Today, at

school, they brought some baby

chickens...I held one in my hand. He

was really little and he was all

warm...

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Did you brush your teeth?

MIKE

Will you tell us a story?

AMELIA

One and then you're going to sleep.

9.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(Her entire story in

Spanish)

Once there was a hawk who wanted to

fly higher than everyone else. He

trained every day and hunted little

birds so he could eat them and be

strong.

MIKE

Pajaritos?     Little birds?

AMELIA

Of course, that's what hawks eat.

So, one day the hawk flew so, so

high that it crashed into an airplane.

It fainted and started to fall. And

when it was about to hit the ground,

all the birds flew toward him and

saved him.

DEBBIE

They saved him?

AMELIA

Yes, and when the hawk was healthy

again he went to talk to the birds

and said: I want to thank you for

saving me, but I can't change and

I'm going to keep hunting you. The

little birds answered: we don't care

that you hunt us, because that's who

you are. But we will always save

you, because that's who we are.

The children are silent.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In English)

Did you like it?

DEBBIE

No.

Amelia moves to turn out the light.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Leave it on.

Amelia stands still beside the switch.

AMELIA

Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con

la luz apagada.

DEBBIE

But I'm scared.

10.

AMELIA

No pasa nada.

DEBBIE

I'm scared that what happened to Pat

is gonna happen to me.

AMELIA

A ti no te va a pasar eso...

DEBBIE

Pat died while she was sleeping.

AMELIA

That only happens to some babies

when they're really little.

MIKE

Then why did daddy get so angry at

mommy?

AMELIA

He wasn't angry, he was just very

sad.

DEBBIE

He left.

AMELIA

Go to sleep. I'll sit here with you,

but you can't talk anymore.

in Morocco than we expected and Rachel

wasn't able to find anyone to take

care of the kids.

AMELIA

Your sister-in-law promised me to

find someone.

RICHARD (O.S.)

Amelia, this is very serious.

AMELIA

It's because... I told Mrs. Jones

three months ago that today is my

son's wedding.

RICHARD (O.S.)

Amelia, this is an emergency. Cancel

your son's wedding. I'll pay for

another one.

AMELIA

Sir, everything is ready. Can't anyone

come take care of the kids? It's

just one day.

RICHARD (O.S.)

AMELIA

None, because he started to like

quesadillas.

DEBBIE

Is the bus here?

AMELIA

school.

AMELIA

They're good kids.

SANTIAGO

Everything is delicious.

16.

Susan reads the menu again.

SUSAN

I'll have the fried eggplant and a

diet Coke.

WAITER

We don't have diet Coke.

SUSAN

Then a regular Coke.

The waiter smiles and goes to place the order. Susan takes

out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands

and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly.

Richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of

binoculars. He spots a hawk flying over the plains.

RICHARD

Look, look: a hawk.

Richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds

and then puts them down.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

This country is incredible.

Susan remains silent and then turns to look at him.

SUSAN

Richard, why did we come here?

RICHARD

What d'you mean why? I thought you

would like it.

SUSAN

Really: why are we here?

Richard knows that Susan's answer implies something else.

RICHARD

To forget everything, to be alone.

Susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with

her chin.

SUSAN

Alone?

Richard sighs in disappointment. The waiter arrives with

the Cokes and the food, which does not look particularly

appetizing. He leaves everything on the table and goes.

Richard is about to pour his drink when Susan stops him.

17.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Throw out the ice.

RICHARD

The Coke is warm.

SUSAN

Yeah, but you don't know what kind

of water is in there.

RICHARD

Why can't you ever relax.    You're

always stressed.

SUSAN

You're the one stressing me out.

You're why I can't relax.

RICHARD

You could if you tried.

SUSAN

Tried? Don't you think I tried?

RICHARD

You're never going to forgive me,

are you?

SUSAN

Do you even know what I'm talking

about?

RICHARD

Susan, please; we didn't come all

this way just to argue.

SUSAN

Oh, we didn't? Then when are we

supposed to "argue"? Or are you

planning on running away again?

ANWAR

About an hour and a half. It's coming

RICHARD

That much? Isn't there anyone here

who could take her?

Anwar shakes his head.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

We've got to get her out of here.

There's no one to tend to her.

ANWAR

My brother already called a doctor,

he's coming.

Richard is going to say something, but holds back.   His

despair and confusion are evident.

ANWAR (CONT'D)

Trust my grandmother; she knows a

lot about remedies.

The grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table.

She takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and

she tosses them into the basin. She stirs it and pulls out

a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of

cloth.

Susan looks horrified at the dirt. The grandmother leans

over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened

rags. Susan resists.

ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER

(In Arabic)

I have to clean you.

ANWAR

(To Susan)

Miss, my grandmother is going to

help you.

The grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths

and grabs the clump of mud. She tries to put it on the wound,

but Susan flinches.

SUSAN

No, not that.

ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER

No, no... not that...

He says the federal police are already

in charge, that they are going to

send the ambulance.

AMELIA

How many pots of rice did you make?

DAUGHTER 1

I made two.

Amelia looks out the window and sees the vast amount of guests

that have arrived and which have transformed the hamlet into

a large parking lot of trucks, horses, carts, etc.

AMELIA

Too many people have come, that's

not going to be enough. Make two

more pots.

She turns to another of her daughters.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

And you Maria Eugenia, warm up more

tortillas.

She sees Santiago walk past the window.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Santiago... please go kill another

six chickens, or there won't be enough

wire mesh and mesquite posts. Santiago opens the door to

the coop and lets the kids in, Mike and Debbie among them.

Once inside, Santiago tells them to catch the chickens.

SANTIAGO

(In Spanish)

I'll give ten pesos to the first one

of you who catches a chicken.

The kids start chasing the chickens, which scamper as soon

as they feel hands trying to grab them.

At first, Mike and Debbie don't know what to do, but they

are soon amused and run to catch them. After a while, Debbie

catches one and holds it up.

Santiago applauds her.

SANTIAGO (CONT'D)

Debbie is the winner. Now we need

another five.

The kids get back to their game of catching chickens.

she's coming.

105   EXT. CHICKEN COOP -- DAY

Santiago has several chickens tied up. One of the kids

catches the last one and hands it to Santiago.

SANTIAGO

Ready. Now who's going to help me?

Several children raise their hands. Mike and Debbie raise

theirs as well, excited. Santiago picks Mike.

SANTIAGO (CONT'D)

Let's see, Mike, you can help me.

Proud, Mike walks toward Santiago and stands next to him.

Santiago unties a chicken and gives it to Mike.

SANTIAGO (CONT'D)

Hold it tight, like this.

He shows him how to hold it. Mike grabs it and holds it

between his arms, smiling, oblivious to what will happen.

Santiago grabs the chicken by the head and pulls it off.

The chicken starts to shake, spurting blood everywhere.

Mike, stunned, lets the animal fall to the ground and the

chicken starts its mad race.

The Mexican kids start screaming excitedly, chasing the

headless chicken. Nobody notices that Debbie and Mike,

completely shocked, are about to cry.

Why?

MIKE

It's not good to kill animals.

Santiago smiles to himself.

SANTIAGO

(In English)

Have you ever been to Kentucky Fried

Chicken?

They both nod.

SANTIAGO (CONT'D)

What? Did you think that Colonel

Sanders kept them as pets?

He hands Mike a headless chicken, and he slowly starts to

pluck it.

My belly's been hard since the

There's no way the baby's coming;

she's only six months pregnant.

PATRICIA

But my belly feels hard, really hard.

AMELIA

D'you want to get married?

around the pool of blood under her neck. Richard, worried,

strokes her hair.

The grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and

sets them on the floor beside them.

RICHARD

Thank you.

The grandmother goes to sit in a chair. Mohammed walks in

and whispers something to him. Anwar turns to Richard.

63.

ANWAR

The doctor's here.

113   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

The doctor walks across the patio, through the tumult of

children and before the scrutiny of two police officers.

114   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

The doctor enters the room.

DOCTOR

(In Arabic)

Allah be with you.

ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER

(In Arabic)

Allah be with you.

Richard just bows his head slightly. The doctor walks over

to Susan, shoos the flies away and examines the wound. She

looks at him, anxious.

DOCTOR

(In Arabic)

The bullet didn't hit her spine or

split her jugular. But it did shatter

her clavicle and she could bleed to

death.

Anwar looks worried.

RICHARD

What did he say?

ANWAR

He says she will be fine.

RICHARD

Stop lying to me god damn it, and

tell me what the fuck he said!

The doctor addresses Richard in terrible English.

DOCTOR

Hospital... need hospital...

RICHARD

Yes, we know that. What can you do

in the meantime?

DOCTOR

(In Arabic, to Anwar)

Tell him I have to stitch up the

wound to stop the bleeding.

64.

Anwar draws close to Richard and whispers.

ANWAR

He has to sew up her wounds.

Susan turns to look at them, suspicious.

SUSAN

What did he say?

Richard gets nervous.

RICHARD

You need some stitches.

SUSAN

What do you mean stitches?

The doctor opens his kit and takes out a rudimentary needle

and thread. He gets ready to sew. Richard questions him,

also in whispers.

RICHARD

You're not going to give her any

anesthetic?

The doctor and Anwar exchange a look.

ANWAR

(To Richard)

No, he doesn't use anesthetic.

RICHARD

What kind of doctor is he?

Anwar answers naively, in a low voice.

ANWAR

He's a veterinarian, but he is good.

Richard looks at him, surprised and angry.

RICHARD

He can't take care of her.

SUSAN

Richard, he might infect the wound...

Richard can't answer as he focuses on what the doctor says.

DOCTOR

(In Arabic)

Tell him that if I don't stitch up

her wound she may bleed to death.

65.

ANWAR

If he doesn't sew up the wound, she

may bleed to death.

DOCTOR

(In Arabic, to Anwar)

And tell him her clavicle is broken.

We have to fasten a splint to it.

ANWAR

He says she has a broken bone and he

has to put a splint on it.

Richard remains pensive for a moment. He looks at Susan,

then at the doctor and assents tentatively.

DOCTOR

(In Arabic)

We're going to have to hold her down.

He mimes holding her down with his hands. Richard leans over

Susan, who weakly languishes on the rug.

RICHARD

Honey, this is going to hurt a little.

She stares at him. Richard turns to Anwar and signals that

he can begin. Anwar holds her hands. Susan, stupefied, to

Richard.

SUSAN

Richard, don't let him...

The doctor lifts Susan's neck and starts to stitch.    She

howls in pain and tries to move away.

Anwar and Richard hold Susan down.    The doctor sticks the

needle in again.

Susan shakes her head from side to side trying to pull away.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Don't let him, don't let him.

RICHARD

Calm down... calm down... Susan,

they have to sew you up... relax...

Richard holds her head to keep her still. She resists.

SUSAN

No, no...no..

RICHARD

Honey, please try to relax...

66.

The doctor rubs alcohol on the wound and starts to stitch.

She moans in pain. Richard puts a rag in her mouth, on which

she bites down.

115   EXT. TINY SHOP -- DAY

Mohammed sits outside with three friends drinking coffee.

From where they are we see the bus and the American tourists.

A battery powered radio plays Moroccan music and commercials

in the background.

MOHAMMED

I don't understand why Anwar brought

them here.

FRIEND 1

Well he spends all his time with

them, what do you expect.

FRIEND 2

The woman is hurt, he had to help

her.

MOHAMMED

Yeah?   And when have they helped us?

FRIEND 1

I liked one of those tourists.

FRIEND 2

Really?   They're all skin and bones.

Suddenly Mohammed focuses on the radio.

MOHAMMED

Shh... sh... listen.

The friends are quiet.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Today, near Tazarine, there was an

incident where an American was shot...

One of the friends interrupts.

FRIEND 3

Hey look, it's the story.

FRIEND 2

They said Tazarine, did you hear?

We were on the radio...

MOHAMMED

Shh, shut up.

67.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Although authorities say it could

have been a foiled robbery, the

American government claims they are

certain it was a terrorist attack.

Minister Hassef Hazal has said that

in our country, terrorist cells have

been eradicated, that Morocco is a

peaceful country and that one act of

vulgar banditry followed by

superficial evaluations such as the

U.S. intends to place upon it cannot

ruin the image, the economy and the

pacifist reputation of our country.

American Ambassador Ken Jones,

however, insists that it was a

terrorist attack on American citizens,

that it merits a full investigation,

and that the guilty should be

punished. So far, the attack has not

been attributed to any known terrorist

organizations...

Mohammed shouts.

MOHAMMED

I fucking told Anwar, I told him he

was only going to get us in trouble...

he never comes and when he does he

always brings trouble...god damn

it...

FRIEND 1

Are the Americans going to invade

our country?

MOHAMMED

I don't know.

116   INT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Susan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and

a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some

dirty bandages. She moans in pain and mumbles curses.

SUSAN

I hate you... I hate you...

She tries to stand, but the doctor impedes it.

DOCTOR

(To Anwar in Arabic)

Tell her not to move; the bullet's

still inside.

68.

ANWAR

(To Susan)

Don't move, miss. The bullet is still

inside you.

SUSAN

I don't give a shit...

RICHARD

My love, don't move.

SUSAN

I want to call the kids.

RICHARD

You can't move, calm down.

SUSAN

I want to talk to them.

RICHARD

You can't; there's only one phone in

town. I'll call them later.

She seems obsessed by the idea.

SUSAN

I want to talk to them...

She tries to stand again. As they struggle, the grandmother

takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it. She gives

it two drags and squats next to Susan.

She shows her how to smoke it and hands it over. The old

woman's serenity is such that Susan acquiesces. She takes

four drags and slowly starts to relax.

Susan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her

eyes. The old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts

to spread it on Susan's neck. Susan does not protest.

Richard watches the scene in awe.

117   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

The bus is still parked outside Anwar's house. Some of the

passengers sit leaning against the wall, scrutinized by some

of the town's children and women who have offered them tea

and dates.

118   INT. BUS -- DAY

The driver sits in the driver's seat and stares out at the

desolate landscape through the windshield.

Several of the tourists nap in their seats. One of them, a

French tourist, Robert (70), starts to breathe with

difficulty. Jane (65), his wife, is alarmed.

69.

JANE

(In French)

Are you ok?

Robert nods, but it is clear that he is not.    Jane shouts at

the driver.

JANE (CONT'D)

(In French)

Could you please turn on the air

conditioning?

The driver shakes his head regretfully.

DRIVER

(In broken French)

No air condition, no gasoline near.

I'm sorry.

Robert inhales, he can barely breathe.

JANE

(In French)

My husband is feeling ill.     You have

to turn it on.

DRIVER

(In French)

No possible. No gasoline near.      I'm

sorry.

LILLY

(In French)

Please, it's too hot.   We can get

dehydrated.

DRIVER

(In French)

I'm really sorry, forgive me, but

gasoline finish with air conditioner.

Tom turns to Jane.

TOM

What is he saying?

JANE

That he can't turn on the air

conditioning, that it's not possible.

Tom stands up and goes to yell at the driver.

TOM

Fuck you.   We're gettin' out of here.

70.

119   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Tom resolutely walks up the stairs followed by James.

120   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Richard is looking out the window while Susan, relaxed,

sleeps. Tom and James walk in making noise.

TOM

We've gotta talk to you.

Richard, with his index finger, signals for him to shut up

and points at Susan. He gestures for them to leave the room.

121   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Tom, James and others are gathered by the door.

TOM

We're leaving.

RICHARD

You can't leave us like this.

TOM

There are old people here and the

heat is getting to them.

RICHARD

At least wait until an ambulance

comes.

TOM

One man almost fainted in the bus

and there's a woman who needs to get

back in time to take her medication.

Richard turns to Anwar.

RICHARD

Is there anyone around here who can

take them in?

TOM

It's not about that.

LILLY

Sir, we can't wait anymore.

Walter an English man, one of the older men,    defends him.

WALTER

We can't leave him here alone.

TOM

Well let him come, then.

71.

DOUGLAS

His wife is in no condition to ride

a bus.

TOM

And lots of other people aren't in

any condition to keep waiting, can't

you see?

RICHARD

Just wait, the ambulance should be

here any minute now.

TOM

We're giving you an hour... one

hour...

Richard breathes, relieved.

122   EXT. STREET, TOKYO -- DAY

Chieko walks down the street with Mitsu. They are good-

looking and attract attention. They know this and look back

out of the corners of their eyes.

123   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- DAY

They arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see-saws,

slides. Several of their deaf-mute volleyball friends are

there.

With them are two young men with hair dyed blond. One of

them, Takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, Haruki

(19), has several tattoos.

Mitsu and Chieko greet them in sign language.    Chieko asks

the slightly chubby Kumiko who they are.

KUMIKO

They're my cousins.

Chieko turns to look at them, curious. Haruki, the guy with

tattoos, exchanges a look with her. Chieko suddenly feels

intimidated and looks down.

CHIEKO

Is he deaf-mute like us?

KUMIKO

No, but he understands some.

Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in

to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both

laugh.

Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so

she can read his lips.

72.

HARUKI

What's your name?

Chieko and her friend smile.    Chieko takes out her notebook

and pen and writes her name.    Haruki reads it out loud.

HARUKI (CONT'D)

Chieko?

Chieko nods.

HARUKI (CONT'D)

My name's Haruki.

Chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. Haruki takes

out a flask and holds it out to her. Chieko opens it and

smells it. Haruki stands in front of her.

HARUKI (CONT'D)

It's whisky.

Chieko smiles and gives a long swig.       Mitsu asks for some

and also gives it a long drink.

HARUKI (CONT'D)

Do the cops come around here?

MITSU

(Gutturally)

Sometimes.

Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu

and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp

of whisky.

124   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- LATER

Half-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends,

and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.

They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the

see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her

bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more

so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in

the air.

Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with

Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object

of their attention.

Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's

friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.

TAKESHI

Why- don't- we- go- to- Montana?

73.

125   INT. TAXI, TOKYO -- EVENING

Night begins to fall. Haruki sits between Mitsu and Chieko.

He strokes Chieko's knee with his hand; she seems turned on.

126   EXT. NIGHTCLUB STRIP, TOKYO -- NIGHT

The taxi parks outside the Montana. Chieko, Mitsu and Haruki

get out of the car and meet with the others at the door.

127   INT. HALLWAY, NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

They enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost

hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement

and chaos.

She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki

grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and

starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm

and follows. She slowly manages to follow.

The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,

lost in the sea of lights and people.

For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She

dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.

When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,

is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.

Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory.

She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly

interrupted by the surrounding crowd.

The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit

ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki

by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what

to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.

Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club,

motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and

Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated

by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the

corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and

walks away from her friends as they dance.

128   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.

DOORMAN

Good evening, how may I help you?

Chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse

and writes a note. She gives it to the doorman together

with Kenji's card. He reads it carefully, and when he's

done he turns to her.

74.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

Very well miss, I'll call him now.

The doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?

There is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the

lieutenant will answer in a moment.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the

deaf-mute girl you saw in the

afternoon, and she asked me to call

you... Yes, her... She says she needs

to talk to you, alone... about her

father... If it's possible, in her

apartment, tonight.

Chieko watches attentively.

129   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY

Yussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.

Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding.

Abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters

watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef.

ABDULLAH

Why did you do this?

They don't answer.   Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Answer me, god damn it!

Ahmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again.

YUSSEF

We were testing the rifle.

Abdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he

endures with silent dignity.

ABDULLAH

Are you idiots? You killed a woman,

(He turns to Zora)

And you, you got naked so your brother

would see you?

AHMED

Yes, she got naked lots of times.    I

saw how Yussef spied on her.

75.

ZORA

That's not true.

Abdullah turns to Yussef.

ABDULLAH

Is it true or not?

Yussef is silent. Abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps

Zora. He looks furious, scared, indignant.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Why did you do this to us?

He can barely hold in his tears. Zora brings her hand to

her face tearily. Abdullah turns to Ahmed.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Where's the rifle?

130   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY

A cop interrogates Hassan. His face is badly bruised and

his hands are cuffed behind his back.

COP

What organization gave you the weapon?

HASSAN

I've told you it wasn't an

organization; I got it from a hunter.

COP

What hunter?

HASSAN

A Japanese hunter gave it to me many

years ago. I've got a picture inside.

She can get it.

He turns to look at his wife. She has also been beaten and

is guarded by two cops. The interrogating cop authorizes

her. She walks in and comes out with a photograph of Hassan

with Yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. He hands

it over and the cop examines it.

HASSAN (CONT'D)

He's holding the rifle he gave me.

131   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Yussef and Ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front

of their parents and sisters.

Abdullah grabs the rifle, dusts it off and puts the bullets

in his bag. He turns to Yasira.

76.

ABDULLAH

We're going to hide out at Naguib's

house. If the cops come, tell them

we went south.

With the rifle in hand, Abdullah runs off, followed by Yussef

and Ahmed. The women watch them get lost on the horizon.

132   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAY

Alarid's truck parks in front of Hassan's house again. Hassan

is still cuffed and being interrogated. Furious, Alarid gets

out of the truck and goes toward him.

ALARID

This Abdullah doesn't live where you

said he did.

He walks over to kick him. The wife intervenes from where

she is, some ten yards away.

WIFE

They live where he said they do.

Alarid turns to her.

ALARID

You're going to take us.

With a gesture, he orders his subordinates to put her in the

truck. She obeys, docile.

ALARID (CONT'D)

And if they're not there, I'll cut

your tongue out and I'll kill your

husband.

133   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

The Moroccan police trucks drive down the dusty roads.    The

landscape is harsh and barren.

134   INT. POLICE TRUCK -- DAY

Hassan's wife gives directions.

WIFE

Make a right here.

Alarid, with his hand, signals the driver to follow her

directions.

Suddenly, in the distance, over the hills, she signals three

tiny dots running up a slope.

WIFE (CONT'D)

That's them.

77.

ALARID

(To the driver)

Stop...

The trucks stop and Alarid takes out his binoculars.

135   P.O.V. ALARID'S BINOCULARS -- CONTINUOUS

In the distance, we can still see Abdullah, Yussef and Ahmed

run across the hills. Abdullah is clearly carrying the rifle.

136   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Alarid quickly gets out.

ALARID

There they are.

All the cops get out with their high powered rifles.

137   EXT. DESERT HILLS -- DAY

Abdullah and his sons run full speed.   Yussef sees the trucks

in the distance.

YUSSEF

The police, the police...

They run up a hill to try to lose them, but shots start to

ring out.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

They're shooting at us.

Abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a

sign of surrender. The shots cease for a few seconds, but

they suddenly start again.

ABDULLAH

Get down.   Run.

The three shepherds run, huddling as low as they can. More

shots. They desperately climb between the rocks. Bullets

whiz past everywhere.

Abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender. He lifts up

the rifle again, sets it on the ground and backs away. But

the gesture is in vain, as the bullets still rush past.

They begin to run again when Ahmed is hit in one of his

calves. He collapses and rolls downhill. Abdullah hurries

to rescue him and drags him behind a rock.

Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.

AHMED

They shot me, they shot me...

78.

Yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the

rocks. He gets the rifle, loads it and aims at the trucks.

He shoots without hitting anything.    Abdullah turns to him.

ABDULLAH

Don't shoot, don't shoot!

Yussef doesn't pay attention.    He loads again and aims.

138   P.O.V. RIFLE SIGHTS -- DAY

Yussef aims carefully. He picks out one of the cops who has

been shooting barely protected by one of the trucks' fenders.

Yussef shoots and the policeman collapses.

139   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- LATER

The religious ceremony has ended and everyone throws rice at

the bride and groom. Debbie and Mike enjoy doing it.

Several cowboys, among them Santiago, have gone to their

trucks and are loudly honking their horns.

Music begins to blare.

140   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- DAY

The band plays various Norteno songs. Everyone waits for

the music to start. After a while a couple starts to timidly

dance. Then another, and another, until the dance floor

becomes a sway of heads moving to the same rhythm.

Amelia dances with Mike and Debbie with Santiago; both Amelia

and Santiago show them a few steps.

SANTIAGO

(To Debbie, in Spanish)

Like this, look...

He kicks his heel back, then forward. Debbie watches,

entertained. Jacinto (55), overweight and with a good-natured

face, moves closer to Amelia and watches her dance for a

while, she notices and stops, embarrassed.

JACINTO

(Both in Spanish)

Amelia, will you let me dance with

you?

Amelia remains unperturbed, without answering him.

JACINTO (CONT'D)

I've been asking you for a dance for

30 years. Does it really cost you

that much?

79.

Amelia stares at him.

AMELIA

I don't think your wife would have

liked that.

JACINTO

C'mon Amelia, she's been dead for 10

years.

Amelia looks around and then turns to him.

AMELIA

Okay, just one.

Jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin

to dance. Santiago watches them, amused, and continues to

dance with Mike and Debbie.

Jacinto draws Amelia closer and they kiss gently.

141   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- NIGHT

Beer starts to flow and some of the guests get overbearing.

There is a small scuffle at the edge of the dance floor, but

order is soon restored.

The guitarist in the band stops the music.

GUITAR PLAYER

(All in Spanish)

Now, Luis and Patricia, come forward.

Everyone makes way for the bride and groom.

GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)

We-want-cake, we-want-cake...

The audience and the band sing the little cake song. A giant,

tacky wedding cake, covered in cream, arrives. The bride

grabs the knife and gets ready to cut it.

GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)

Take- a- bite, take- a- bite...

The bride gives into the ritual. She tries to take a bite

out of the cake without using her hands and someone pushes

her face into the cream. Debbie and Mike laugh.

A cowboy pulls out a gun and, festively, fires.   Debbie is

frightened and goes to hide behind Amelia.

AMELIA

Don't worry, it's ok.

The man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor

as if nothing had happened.

80.

Luis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he

takes the microphone.

LUIS

Good evening everyone... Hey... I

want to say something. Love came

today, it came here all pretty...

(he taps his heart)

It's kind of like a little mouse is

crawling inside of me. Because that's

what love is, it's like your insides

get all twisted into knots... and

that, baby, is what you've taught

me. And because you've shown me, I

want to tell everyone that hopefully

love will get inside them

too...because it feels so good,

really...Thanks a lot and keep havin'

a good time...

Everybody applauds and Luis steps down from the dais, proud

of his speech. He goes to Amelia and gives her a very long

and loving hug.

142   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- NIGHT

Night has fallen. The music plays full blast. Everyone

dances, people start to make out, the drunk collapse.

Patricia breathes regularly with her hands on her belly.

Luis drinks beer beside her while he watches the guests dance.

Debbie falls asleep on Amelia's lap while Mike watches the

party, overwhelmed.

MIKE

When are my parents getting back?

The question catches Amelia off guard.

AMELIA

Pronto...muy pronto...

MIKE

They told me they were coming back

today.

AMELIA

Se quedaron mas rato.

The answer seem to makes Mike anxious.

MIKE

My dad's coming back with my mom.

AMELIA

Yes. Yes he is.

81.

MIKE

I don't want him to leave again.

AMELIA

He won't.

He starts crying.

MIKE

I miss Pat.

Amelia embraces him and kisses his head.

AMELIA

Yo tambien hijito, yo tambien.

The boy, tired and sleepy, leans his head on Amelia.

143   EXT. HAMLET "LOS LOBOS" -- NIGHT

Santiago, a little bit drunk, and Amelia, carrying Debbie

who has passed out, say goodbye to Luis and Patricia. Sleepy,

Mike leans on the hood of the car.

LUIS

(All in Spanish)

Stay the night.

AMELIA

I can't. I have to take these kids

home and it's almost dawn.

LUIS

But Santiago's pretty drunk.

SANTIAGO

Drunk my ass. I'm fine. I'll go

and come back in an hour.

PATRICIA

Stay for another while, the party's

just getting started.

AMELIA

I wish, but these kids have to go to

school.

Santiago opens the door for Amelia, who carefully sets Debbie

on the back seat. Mike gets in and as soon as he does he

nestles in to go to sleep.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

See you soon, son.

Luis and Amelia hug each other.    Then Amelia hugs her daughter-

in-law.

82.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Congratulations, dear.

(She points at her

belly)

Take care of my grandson 'cause I'm

dying to be a grandmother.

She gives her a kiss and gets in the car.   Luis turns to

Santiago.

LUIS

You sure you're not too drunk?

SANTIAGO

Drunk my ass. I'm fine.     I'll be

back soon.

Santiago stumbles to the driver's side and opens the door.

144   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

The night spreads over the highway that cuts across the

desert. Santiago's car drives along, illuminating the cacti.

145   INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

Santiago drives the car, nodding off every now and then. In

the back, Debbie and Mike have surrendered to sleep. Santiago

jerks the wheel.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Hey... be careful...

Santiago corrects the vehicles trajectory and goes back to

his careless driving.

146   EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- NIGHT

Santiago decides to cross through Mesa de Otay. Since it's

nighttime, there are very few cars. They drive across the

bridge and stop before the immigration officer.

147   EXT. IMMIGRATION STALL, BORDER CROSSING -- CONTINUOUS

The officer walks up to the window.

OFFICER

Your papers...

Santiago and Amelia take out their passports and their Green

cards. The officer compares the documents to their faces

again and again.

OFFICER (CONT'D)

Where you comin' from?

83.

SANTIAGO

(In bad English)

From a wedding.

The officer looks through the window and sees Debbie and

Mike sleeping in the back.

OFFICER

Who are they?

Santiago rushes to answer.

SANTIAGO

They're her nephews.

Amelia freezes at Santiago's answer.    The officer won't stop

looking at the children.

OFFICER

They don't look like you.

AMELIA

(bewildered)

I'm in charge of them.

OFFICER

Do you have their passports?

Amelia takes out their American passports and shows them to

the cop. He looks them over very carefully. Santiago starts

to get nervous.

SANTIAGO

Is there a problem?

The officer turns to look at them suspiciously.    He obviously

smells the alcohol.

OFFICER

Should there be one?

Santiago shakes his head.    Debbie wakes up and looks at the

officer sleepily.

DEBBIE

Hi.

OFFICER

Hey there, sweetie.

Debbie rubs her eyes.

OFFICER (CONT'D)

Tell me, is this lady your aunty?

Debbie innocently shakes her head.

84.

DEBBIE

No, she's not my aunty.

The officer stares at them harshly. He says something

incomprehensible over his radio and asks Santiago.

OFFICER

Are you drunk?

SANTIAGO

Me, sir?   No.

OFFICER

Get out of the car.

SANTIAGO

Why, officer?

OFFICER

I'm countin' to three...

He brings his hand to his gun.

148   INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

Nervous, Santiago glances ahead and looks at the border

crossing through his rear-view mirror. He puts the car in

reverse and accelerates, trying to escape back to Mexico,

but he crashes into an arriving car.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

What are you doing?

149   EXT. IMMIGRATION DESK, BORDER CROSSING -- NIGHT

The immigration officers take out their guns and run to stop

him. Santiago sees that the road ahead is clear and he drives

away full speed, barely swerving around some customs officers

who are searching another vehicle.

The officer shouts urgently.

OFFICER

They've kidnapped some kids...

He starts a police chase.

150   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

Santiago's car drives full speed down the highway.   He

sometimes looks as if he is going to lose control.

151   INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

Santiago drives madly. Frightened, Amelia holds onto the

dashboard. Debbie and Mike start to cry.

85.

SANTIAGO

(In Spanish)

See, I told you you shouldn't have

brought them. I told you. I told

you..

A trailer drives slowly. Santiago decides to drive around

it blindly, and almost drives off the other side of the road.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Santiago, stop acting crazy and stop

the car... Santiago, stop...

Santiago ignores her, concentrated on his driving. He looks

through the rear-view mirror. There is nobody behind him,

only the dark highway. Santiago steps on the gas.

Amelia tries to comfort the kids.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In English)

Everything's all right sweeties...

The children won't stop crying, terrified by the speed.

Through one of his mirrors, Santiago sees two patrol cars

following him with their turrets flashing.

SANTIAGO

(In Spanish)

Fucking asshole gringo mother-fuckers,

here they come...

Santiago accelerates. The car seems to be out of control.

The children scream. Amelia tries to stop Santiago.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Stop... Stop...

Santiago reaches a path and heads toward it.

152   EXT. DESERT PATH -- NIGHT

The car drives quickly down the path, raising up a cloud of

dust. The patrol cars are no longer visible.

The car drives on for a mile and then stops.

153   INT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

Santiago turns to Amelia.

SANTIAGO

(Their entire dialogue

in Spanish)

Get out...

86.

Amelia looks at the dark desert surrounding them.

AMELIA

Are you crazy? Where?

SANTIAGO

Get out. I'll lose these bastards

and then I'll come back for you.

AMELIA

Santiago, calm down...

SANTIAGO

Aunt Amelia, they're going to get

us, get out god damn it...

154   EXT. SANTIAGO'S CAR -- NIGHT

Amelia gets out and opens the door for the kids.

AMELIA

(In English)

Come with me, dears.

The kids get out and Amelia holds their hand.   Santiago closes

the doors and drives off in a cloud of dust.

They start to walk through the darkness. Amelia leads the

way, avoiding cacti and thorny branches. The go on like

this for a long stretch. The children are quiet and scared.

Amelia goes toward the highway and realizes the patrol cars

have turned into the path. She runs into the desert with

the kids. She can barely see with the light of the early

dawn. The three frequently trip on thorny plants.

DEBBIE

I want to go home now.

MIKE

Me too.

Both of them, scared, start to cry.

AMELIA

(In English)

Don't cry. We're going home now.

She looks back worried at where the patrol cars were; they

are approaching quickly. Then she turns to where Santiago

ran. The headlights are soon lost on the horizon.

Amelia holds them by the hand and pulls them as she runs.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In Spanish)

Let's go.

87.

She leads them further and further away from the path, snaking

through the brush. The patrol cars come even closer. Amelia

ducks and hides behind one of the bushes.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Get down.

The children hide with her. The patrol cars tear past her,

some five hundred yards away, chasing after Santiago.

We suddenly hear sirens. Then, the sound of doors slamming

and unintelligible voices over a loudspeaker.

POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)

Do not get out of the car...don't

get out...wait...stop...stop...don't

run...

After a few seconds, we hear distant gunshots, three, four.

Amelia listens, frozen.

155   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Dusk. Susan sleeps and Richard looks at the vast desert

through the window. Anwar, sitting on a chair, with a fan

clears away the flies hovering around Susan. We can hear the

call to prayer and Anwar prostrates himself toward Mecca.

Richard observes Anwar's prayer and then looks at Susan who

moans in her sleep.

156   INT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Richard and Anwar are sitting in silence while Susan lies

unconsciously on the floor.

Yamile (9), a beautiful girl with large brown eyes, enters

carrying a tray with cookies and tea. She greets Richard

with a nod and offers him tea.

Richard takes the tea.

RICHARD

Thank you.

The girl gets up to offer tea to Anwar, who takes it.

ANWAR

(In Arabic)

Thank you, Yamile.

Yamile smiles and leaves the room.

RICHARD

Is that your daughter?

88.

ANWAR

The fourth of eight.

RICHARD

Eight?

Anwar affirms, smiling.

ANWAR

Do you have kids?

Richard takes out his wallet and pulls out a photo of him,

Susan, Mike and Debbie. He shows it to him.

Anwar takes it and looks at it.

ANWAR (CONT'D)

Just two?

RICHARD

Three...

(He remains pensive)

Yes, just two.

ANWAR

You should have more.

Anwar returns the photo. Richard looks at it for a moment

before putting it back into his wallet.

RICHARD

What about you? How many wives do

you have?

ANWAR

(Smiling)

I can only afford one.

RICHARD

And is this where you live?

ANWAR

No, this is where my family lives. I

live in Marrakesh. But I come whenever

I can...

They exchange a look. We hear a car engine.

157   EXT. STREET, HAMLET -- AFTERNOON

An old, run-down Peugeot driven by a policeman pulls up in

front of the house. The policeman gets out. The tourists,

leaning on the wall, get up to see what's happening.

Mohammed comes out to talk to him.

89.

MOHAMMED

(in Arabic)

What happened?

POLICEMAN

(In Arabic)

I need to talk to the American.

Tom interrogates Mohammed.

TOM

What did he say?

MOHAMMED

No English...

158   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

The policeman, Anwar and Richard are chatting in the patio.

RICHARD

(To Anwar)

When did he find out?

ANWAR

(In Arabic)

When did you know?

POLICEMAN

(In Arabic)

A while ago... they said the ambulance

isn't coming anymore.

ANWAR

A while ago... he says the ambulance

broke down.

RICHARD

What? Tell him to call another one.

He has to get another one.

ANWAR

(In Arabic, to the

Policeman)

He wants you to call another

ambulance.

POLICEMAN

(In Arabic)

You know there isn't another one.

ANWAR

(To Richard)

There isn't another ambulance.

90.

RICHARD

What the hell do you mean there isn't

another ambulance? You've got to get

her out of here...

He faces the police officer.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

She can't stay here or she'll die.

Call another fucking ambulance...

The policeman cannot understand and remains expressionless.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

Come on, move... call another

ambulance...

ANWAR

(In Arabic)

He asks how we're going to get the

woman out of here.

POLICEMAN

(In Arabic)

Tell him that they told me that his

embassy is going to deal with it.

ANWAR

He says your embassy will deal with

the matter.

Richard now shouts at Anwar.

RICHARD

How the fuck are they going to deal

with it? It's your shitty fucking

country's responsibility.

POLICEMAN

(In Arabic)

The Americans want to send one of

their helicopters but I think there

are some problems.

Anwar mulls over his answer.   He seems to want to lie again.

ANWAR

They're going to try to send a

helicopter.

RICHARD

(incredulous)

A helicopter?... Let's get out of

here...

He starts walking. Anwar catches up to him.

91.

ANWAR

Where?

Richard turns to him, desperate.

RICHARD

I need to make a phone call.

They turn towards the exit leaving the cop behind, who doesn't

seem to understand. Tom and James take advantage of the

situation to go talk to Richard.

TOM

We can't stay here any longer. It's

going to get dark soon. Lots of

people aren't feeling well and its

dangerous to stay here.

Richard explodes and pushes Tom.

RICHARD

Stop fucking with me.

TOM

Don't you dare push me.

RICHARD

Oh no?

He pushes him again, angrily.

TOM

What are you doing, you stupid fuck?

RICHARD

Leave asshole.

Tom shoves him.

TOM

Fuck you.

Richard becomes furious and loses it, hitting him over and

over again. Some of the tourists get involved. James manages

to grab him with Anwar.

JAMES

Hey, take it easy.

RICHARD

I'm fed up with that asshole.

James pulls him away while other tourists pull Tom away.

JAMES

Try to calm down.

92.

RICHARD

Calm down? My wife is dying up there.

JAMES

Come with us.

RICHARD

Where the fuck do you want me to

take her?

JAMES

Try to understand, many of them can't

go on. Tell me, honestly, is there

any point in us staying?

Richard threatens him.

RICHARD

You leave and I'll kill you...

James is going to say something, but Richard turns around

and walks away as he is about to say something. Anwar follows.

159   INT. GENERAL STORE -- EVENING

Richard is in the phone booth with telephone in hand. A

woman's voice answers.

RACHEL (O.S.)

Hello...

RICHARD

Rachel... What's going on? Nobody's

come... Who have you talked to... we

need help...she's dying...

RACHEL (O.S.)

What d'you mean dying?

RICHARD

She's very weak, please, you've got

to do something.

RACHEL (O.S.)

Mark, your business partner, already

called someone in the Secretary of

State, they're going to help you...

RICHARD

You can't just make these stupid

fucking calls, you've got to do

something...

RACHEL (O.S.)

Richard calm down, we're doing

everything we can.

93.

RICHARD

How the fuck do you expect me to

calm down? Susan is dying...

RACHEL (O.S.)

I'm flying over there tonight.

RICHARD

There's no time. I need to get Susan

out of here now! Put Mark on the

phone...

RACHEL (O.S.)

I don't know if I can find him.

RICHARD

God damn it, connect the fucking

call.

A few seconds go by. Desperate, Richard looks at the town as

it goes about its daily business, oblivious to his tragedy.

MARK (O.S.)

Richard, it's Mark.

RICHARD

Mark, help me... Susan is dying and

there are no ambulances, there's no

hospital, there's nothing.

MARK (O.S.)

Richard, the news is all over the

place. They're going to go help you,

soon, but there have been some

political problems that are being

resolved.

RICHARD

I don't give a shit about political

problems... Do something, now,

please...

Through the window, Richard, astonished, watches the bus

drive away, kicking up dust as it disappears in the distance.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

Son of a bitch...

He throws the phone away and runs after the bus. We hear

Mark's desperate voice over the receiver.

MARK (O.S.)

Richard... what happened? Richard,

answer me...

94.

160   EXT. HAMLET -- EVENING

Richard runs after the bus as it drives away down the side

streets.

RICHARD

Stop... Stop... Stop you mother-

fuckers stop...

The bus vanishes into the distance. Richard picks up a stone

and hurls it impotently.

161   INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Chieko is in her room, sitting on her bed, staring into space.

The doorbell light goes on. She remains motionless for a

few moments. The light goes on again. Chieko breathes in

and goes to open the door.

162   INT. ENTRANCE TO CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Chieko opens the door and runs into Kenji, who greets her as

if she were just anybody.

KENJI

Hello.

She bows.

KENJI (CONT'D)

They told me you wanted to talk to

me.

Chieko, who has been unable to read his lips, asks him with

her hands that he speak slowly and face her. Kenji is

embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more

considerate.

KENJI (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. Is there something you

wanted to tell me?

Chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off

his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to

the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything

to drink.

KENJI (CONT'D)

Do you have tea?

Chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over

the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a

strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A

small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.

Chieko gestures for him to sit down.     Kenji and Chieko sit

across from each other.

95.

Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down

and hands it over to Kenji. Kenji reads, seems surprised

and reads again slowly.

KENJI (CONT'D)

"My father had nothing to do with my

mother's death," what's this?

Chieko is disconcerted at the question. She takes her

notebook and starts writing. Kenji reads and turns to her.

KENJI (CONT'D)

Your father was asleep when she jumped

off the balcony?

She nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks

toward the balcony.

163   EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

She opens the door to the balcony and points at the void:

it's over twelve floors. Kenji looks over; the distance is

dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the

piece of paper.

KENJI

You saw her jump?

She nods and writes again.    She looks perturbed.

KENJI (CONT'D)

You've already told the other

officers?

She nods again.   Kenji holds her by her arms.

KENJI (CONT'D)

I don't know what you're talking

about.

Chieko remains motionless for a few seconds. She scrawls in

her notebook "Then why do you want to talk to my father?"

Kenji reads and then turns to her.

KENJI (CONT'D)

It's about a hunting rifle in his

name.

The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. Chieko spots it

from the balcony and signals to Kenji that she has to go to

the kitchen. She runs off.

164   INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Kenji stands and looks at the photographs of Yasujiro hunting

all over the world: with a kudu in Africa, a black bear in

Kamchatka, Hassan and the Oryx in Morocco.

96.

Chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea.

KENJI

Does your father still hunt?

She shakes her head.   She writes something and hands it over.

KENJI (CONT'D)

There was an incident with a rifle

in your father's name. That's why

we want to talk to him.

The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of

Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its

voices.

Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony

doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back

to the living room and sits down, dejected.

Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.

He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.

She picks up the notebook and writes.    Kenji reads.

KENJI (CONT'D)

No, your father isn't going to jail.

We just need to talk to him.

There is a long silence. Chieko seems immersed in a remote,

inaccessible world. Kenji turns his face to hers so that

she can read his lips.

KENJI (CONT'D)

I have to go now. Thank you.

Chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head, urging him to stay.

They exchange a look for an instant and Kenji insists.

KENJI (CONT'D)

I have to go.

He gets up to leave. Chieko signals for him to wait for a

moment and goes to her room.

Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting.    Chieko

comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.

She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is

disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She

walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take

another step, he holds her back with both hands.

KENJI (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

97.

She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches

away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her

hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile,

without taking his eyes off Chieko's.

She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji

strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs

it again and puts it back on.

KENJI (CONT'D)

No, no, no... this is wrong.

Kenji looks turned on and confused: Chieko is beautiful, but

he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.

KENJI (CONT'D)

No, I can't.     You're just a girl.

She walks up to his face and licks it.    He is confused.

KENJI (CONT'D)

Enough, please.

He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the

sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and

suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.

Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing

Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his

shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.

165   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. The police have

stopped firing and run for cover. Yussef loads the rifle

again and aims carefully. He shoots and, in the distance,

we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.

Abdullah shouts at Yussef desperately.

ABDULLAH

Yussef, stop shooting!

Furious, Yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at

the cops. Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. Confused,

Abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son

or stop the enraged Yussef.

In the distance, the cops reorganize.    We hear the faraway

shots of Alarid giving orders.

ALARID

Move that truck... god damn it...

One of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.

Yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well

covered. Abdullah drags himself all the way to Yussef.

98.

ABDULLAH

Give me that rifle...

Yussef turns to his father.

YUSSEF

They're going to kill us.

ABDULLAH

Give me that rifle.

He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle

and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to

snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two

barely have time to hide.

The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,

terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very

close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.

Ahmed won't stop complaining.    Abdullah shouts at him.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Ahmed, don't move.

The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,

Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on

the rocks with bullet in his back.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Ahmed!   Ahmed!

Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.

Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt

grows bloodier.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Ahmed!   Ahmed!

He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah

cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.

Abdullah laments nervously.

ABDULLAH (CONT'D)

Don't die, don't die.

Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands

up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,

he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that

he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.

When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks

toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through

a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.

ALARID

What's happening?

99.

POLICE OFFICER

A boy is walking this way.

ALARID

Is he armed?

The officer takes a careful look.

POLICE OFFICER

It doesn't look like it.

ALARID

What are the others doing?

The officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son.

POLICE OFFICER

A man is holding somebody injured.

ALARID

Is the other one still walking this

way?

POLICE OFFICER

Yes.

Alarid turns to the other officers.

ALARID

Aim.

The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps

walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying

softly, keeping his arms open.

Yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and

he kneels with his arms open.

YUSSEF

I killed the American, I was the

only one who shot at you...

Cautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds

with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his

pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

They did nothing... nothing...

He turns to his father and his brother and points at them.

YUSSEF (CONT'D)

Kill me, but save my brother, he did

nothing... nothing...

Alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    Behind him are

five other cops, also ready to shoot.

100.

ALARID

On the ground...

Yussef does not obey.

YUSSEF

Save my brother...

ALARID

On the ground...

Yussef turns his face toward Alarid looks him in the eye.

YUSSEF

Save my brother... please...

He lies on the floor, crying. Alarid puts his gun down and

looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. Then he

looks up at Abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. He

turns to one of his subordinates.

ALARID

Go help them.

One of the officers goes to help Abdullah and Ahmed.     Yussef

lies on the floor, crying.

166   EXT. DESERT -- NIGHT

The sun rises.   Amelia and the children keep walking.    They

sweat.

MIKE

I can't walk anymore.

AMELIA

We have to keep walking.

MIKE

Why is the air so hot?

Amelia stops and tries to distract them.

AMELIA

(the entire dialogue

in English)

Because coyotes and snakes and quails

have already breathed that air.

Mike remains pensive.

MIKE

We're breathing the same air animals

breathe?

AMELIA

Yes.

101.

MIKE

And it doesn't rot?

AMELIA

No, it doesn't rot.   We all breathe

this air.

167   EXT. DESERT -- MORNING

Dawn. The three walk through the desert.      Debbie walks

mechanically, tired and exhausted.

DEBBIE

I can't anymore. I'm thirsty.

MIKE

So am I.

Amelia looks around her: no sign of civilization.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Just a little further and we'll go

look for water.

168   EXT. DESERT -- LATER

Amelia lumbers heavily, carrying Debbie asleep on her arm.

Mike drags his feet a few yards behind.

They walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until

they reach a small mound where a leafy mesquite grows.

Amelia lays a limp Debbie down on the ground and sits on the

mound of earth.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

We're going to rest here for a while.

MIKE

What if there are snakes?

AMELIA

No, there aren't any.   Come, lie

down.

The boy, exhausted and docile, obeys and lies on her chest.

Amelia leans against the trunk with Debbie on her legs. The

children sleep while Amelia, nodding off, tries to keep watch.

169   EXT. DESERT -- LATER

It is well into the morning. Amelia and the children sleep

deeply. There is a noise and Amelia opens her eyes. She

sees a border patrol truck driving around near them.

102.

Looking through the branches, she spies on the truck and

watches another one join it. Mike awakes and sits up.

MIKE

What happening?

Amelia ducks and lays Mike face down.    The two trucks slowly

approach.

AMELIA

(To Mike, in a low

voice, in Spanish)

Stay still.

A truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes.

The other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets

lost in the desert.

Amelia gets up and shakes off the dust. She looks out of

place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. She

makes sure the trucks are leaving.

MIKE

Why are we hiding if we didn't do

anything wrong?

AMELIA

(In English)

Because they think we did something

wrong.

MIKE

That's not true: you're bad.

Amelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words.

AMELIA

No, sweetie, I'm not bad.     I just

did something stupid.

She pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In Spanish)

I love you very much, sweetie.

Amelia turns and tries to wake Debbie.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In English)

Debbie, we've got to go.

The girl opens her eyes, but doesn't answer.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Debbie, sweetheart, wake up.

103.

She closes her eyes again. Amelia notices her lips are dry

and her breath is irregular: she is visibly dehydrated.

Upon seeing that she doesn't react, Amelia looks for the

trucks: they're far away.

170   EXT. DESERT -- LATER

Amelia carries Debbie in her arms under the burning sun,

following a cattle trail. Mike walk behind, pale, sweaty.

Amelia looks to the horizon: there is no sign of the trucks.

171   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

They are still walking. Amelia can barely go on. She stops

to rest. She is sweating copiously. Mike also looks weak.

172   EXT. DESERT -- LATER

The heat is strong and Amelia is beaten. She looks for the

shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays Debbie down. Then

she turns to Mike.

AMELIA

Sweetie, I'm going to go look for

help. Stay here and don't move.

MIKE

I'm not staying here alone.

AMELIA

Honey, you have to take care of

Debbie.

MIKE

I'm going with you.

Mike looks at her with imploring eyes.   Amelia caresses him.

AMELIA

I won't be long. I promise.

173   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Amelia desperately looks through the desert.   She also looks

dehydrated. She drifts.

174   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Amelia drags her feet as she walks.   She can go no further.

175   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

Amelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty.

She surveys the environs from the top. In the distance she

sees a Border Patrol truck driving down a path.

104.

With great effort, Amelia runs down the hill.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Stop, stop...

The truck doesn't stop. Amelia keeps running, flailing her

arms and screaming wildly.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Sir... sir... stop...

The truck stops and backs up.   Amelia keeps going, tripping

over stones.

John (29), a thoroughly Mexican officer, gets out and she

runs up, panting, to him.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Please help me.

John stares at her suspiciously.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

I have to go get two kids I left

behind in the desert.

John looks at her suspiciously.

JOHN

(In Spanish, with a

terrible accent)

Are they illegal immigrants?

AMELIA

No, they're American.

JOHN

When did you cross?

AMELIA

(In English)

I didn't cross, I live here.   Please,

help me find these kids.

John keeps staring at her.   He points to a mesquite.

JOHN

Stand there and don't move.

Amelia obeys. John goes back to the vehicle, opens the door

and sits down and grabs the radio.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Attention base, I have a 4533...I

have the suspect.

105.

Amelia doesn't manage to hear what the radio says. She looks

attentively at what the agent is doing. John stops and runs

back to her.

JOHN (CONT'D)

You're under arrest. Turn around

and put your hands behind your head.

Amelia despairs.

AMELIA

I left those kids in the desert, I

swear.

John pushes her forcefully against the truck.

JOHN

Turn around, now.

She turns around with her hands over her head.    John handcuffs

her and leads her to the vehicle.

176   INT. BORDER PATROL VEHICLE -- DAY

Amelia, cuffed, and John, drive down a path in the desert.

JOHN

Which way are they?

Amelia studies the terrain.    She points at some mesquites in

the distance.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Over there.

177   EXT. DESERT -- DAY

The truck parks and they both get out.

JOHN

Where are they?

Amelia explores the landscape, anguished.

AMELIA

They must be around here.

Another border patrol truck arrives and pulls up next to

them. Eliseo (34), looks out the window.

ELISEO

What happened?

JOHN

This lady said they were here, but

there's nobody.

106.

ELISEO

(In Spanish)

Ma'am, you're not lying to us, are

you?

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

I swear they're around here somewhere.

She sees another cluster of mesquites and points toward them.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

They must be over that way.

178   EXT. CLUSTER OF MESQUITES -- DAY

They arrive at the cluster. The two trucks park and the

three get out. She is still cuffed. A helicopter hovers

above them.

They walk around: nothing.

JOHN

There's nobody here.

AMELIA

(To Eliseo, in Spanish)

I left them about a kilometer in

from the road.

ELISEO

(In Spanish)

Which road?

She doesn't know what to say.    John grabs her by the arm and

drags her toward the vehicle.

JOHN

I don't believe you.

Amelia looks at him desperately.

AMELIA

(In English)

I swear they're around here.

John is not affected.   He keeps pulling her.

ELISEO

(In English)

John, wait, maybe she's telling the

truth.

JOHN

Maybe she's not, let's go.

107.

AMELIA

Please sir, believe me.

John pays no attention.   She turns to Eliseo.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In Spanish)

I swear, they're lost, they're going

to die. I have to find them.

John keeps pulling her. He puts her in the truck and closes

the door before Eliseo's passive gaze.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

(In English)

Please no... please...

179   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

Night begins to fall. From the window we can hear the noises

of the town: voices, goats bleating, camels moaning, music

from a radio.

Susan wakes from her slumber and turns to Richard, who is

leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.

SUSAN

Richard.

RICHARD

What do you need?

SUSAN

Richard... if I die, take care of

the kids. Especially Mike, he really

needs you.

RICHARD

You're not going to die. You can't

die. You just can't.

SUSAN

Don't ever leave them again.

RICHARD

No, I'm not going to leave them and

don't you even think about leaving

me, because I'll kill you like

nobody's killed you before.

She smiles.   He caresses her.

SUSAN

I peed my pants.

RICHARD

What?

108.

SUSAN

I couldn't hold it in and I peed.

Richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture.

RICHARD

I'm going to tell Mike on you, so

you never scold him again.

They both laugh.   She grimaces in pain when she does.

SUSAN

I need to pee again.

RICHARD

(To Anwar)

Do you have a pot I can borrow?

Anwar looks in a corner and hands it over.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(To Anwar)

Can you leave us alone for a moment?

The grandmother and Anwar exit.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

Come, try it like this.

He lifts up her dress, pulls down her underpants and sets

the basin under her. She puts her arm around him to pull

herself up, but can't move her right arm.

SUSAN

I can't.

They laugh.   He kisses her.   We start to hear the stream.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

Now I can.

While she pees, they kiss painfully.    She starts to cry.

RICHARD

Forgive me my love. When Pat died I

didn't know what to do, the pain

drove me crazy... I was scared, that's

why I left... forgive me.

SUSAN

I was scared too... when I saw Pat

lying still in his crib...

Her voice breaks up and she can barely go on.

109.

SUSAN (CONT'D)

It wasn't my fault, it wasn't... I

couldn't do anything for him...

RICHARD

No, it wasn't your fault. I was

wrong...

He strokes her head.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

Shhh... it wasn't your fault my love,

it wasn't anybody's fault... Pat

just left...

(A beat)

Forgive me, please.

SUSAN

Forgive me for not forgiving you.

Richard hugs her and starts to laugh.

RICHARD

You missed; you got my leg.

They both laugh, and as they do, the blanket covering Susan's

wound slips off. Richard sees her swollen, bruised arm. He

touches it.

RICHARD (CONT'D)

Does it hurt?

SUSAN

So much... so much...

Richard looks worried and leaves the room.

180   EXT. STAIRS, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

He walks out onto the stairs and calls Anwar.

RICHARD

Anwar...Anwar...

Anwar runs into the room.

ANWAR

What happened?

RICHARD

We've got to get her out of here.

Where's the clinic?

ANWAR

In Alnif, an hour and a half away

from here.

110.

RICHARD

Can you get us a car we can take her

in?

Anwar remains pensive for a moment and then nods.

181   INT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Richard is squatting next to Susan.

RICHARD

My love... I'm going to get you out

of here.   We're going to try to

take you to a clinic an hour and a

half away from here. Do you think

you can make it?

She thinks for a moment and then nods.

SUSAN

Yeah.

RICHARD

I need you to be strong. Really

strong.

Susan sighs: the effort required seems as if it will be too

much, but she nods again. Richard hugs and kisses her.

182   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

Richard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow. It is

very difficult to move her. She is clearly in pain and groans

quietly.

Outside the house is the policeman with his Peugeot. Anwar

is talking to him.

Richard and the vet carry Susan all the way to the car.

Richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier.

RICHARD

Thank you for lending us the car.

Anwar translates.

ANWAR

(In Arabic)

He thanks you for lending us the

car.

The policeman nods kindly.

Dozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene.

Gingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car

and softly lay her on the back seat.

111.

Even so, she screams in pain.

SUSAN

Ahhh... Ahhh...

Richard holds her hand and squeezes it.

RICHARD

Sweetie, you've got to hold on.

Richard gets into the car, and as they're about to drive

off, the shopkeeper runs up to them.

TENDERO

(In Arabic)

Stop... Stop...

The shopkeeper catches up to them.

TENDERO (CONT'D)

(In Arabic)

They're calling from the American

Embassy.

183   INT. GENERAL STORE -- AFTERNOON

Richard walks into the cubicle.    The phone is off the hook

and Richard answers.

RICHARD

Hello...

SECRETARY (O.S.)

Just a moment, I'm going to put you

through to ambassador Ken Clifford.

Richard awaits. In the corner of the room, he sees a goat's

head covered with flies.

KEN

Hello, Richard Jones?

RICHARD

Yes, speaking.

KEN (O.S.)

I'm very sorry about what happened

to your wife, but you can be sure

that the culprits will be punished.

RICHARD

My wife is dying. She's in urgent

need of medical attention.

KEN (O.S.)

We're working on it...

112.

Richard interrupts angrily.

RICHARD

We've been here for five hours.

What the fuck are you waiting for?

KEN (O.S.)

The Moroccan government won't let us

use their airspace. They refused to

acknowledge that this was an act of

terrorism...

RICHARD

I can't wait anymore... I'm taking

my wife to a clinic in Tinerhir right

now...

KEN (O.S.)

Stay put... we've settled the matter.

A helicopter should arrive soon...

RICHARD

We can't wait any longer.

KEN (O.S.)

The helicopter is on its way. Don't

move.

RICHARD

My wife is in critical condition.

How long is the chopper going to

take?

KEN (O.S.)

Soon... it'll be there soon... Be

patient, it won't be long.

184   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- EVENING

Amelia sits in a room painted white. An American, his hair

slicked back, dressed in a shirt and tie, sits before her.

POLICE OFFICER

(In Spanish)

Is your full name Amelia Gloria Jordan

Susilla?

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Yes sir.

POLICE OFFICER

Do you understand English?

AMELIA

(In English)

Yes sir.

113.

POLICE OFFICER

(In English)

Ma'am, it was a miracle that we found

those kids. I don't know how you

could leave them alone in the desert.

AMELIA

I had to look for help.

POLICE OFFICER

Your reckless behavior endangered

their lives.

Amelia stops arguing.   She looks worried.

AMELIA

How are they?

POLICE OFFICER

That's none of your business, ma'am.

The man's words hurt Amelia, who looks away to avoid crying.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

You've committed serious crimes.

AMELIA

I just took the kids to my son's

wedding.

POLICE OFFICER

No ma'am, you did not just do that.

You took them to another country

without their parents' permission

and you put them in danger.

AMELIA

Sir, I raised these kids since they

were born. I take care of them day

and night. I feed them breakfast,

lunch and dinner. I play with them.

Mike and Debbie are like my own

children.

POLICE OFFICER

(sternly)

But they are not your kids, ma'am.

AMELIA

What about my nephew, Santiago?

POLICE OFFICER

I don't have any information on him.

Amelia looks destitute.

114.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

We located the parents in Morocco.

They're very angry, but they've

decided not to raise charges.

Amelia exhales, relieved.   The policeman leans toward her.

POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

Nevertheless, the government of the

United States has deemed you were

seriously breaking the law and has

decided to immediately and

definitively deport you.

Amelia loses her breath.

AMELIA

I've been living here for fifteen

years. My things are here, I rent a

house, I made my life here.

POLICE OFFICER

You should've thought of that

beforehand.

AMELIA

I want to talk to a lawyer.

POLICE OFFICER

If you attempt to take this to court,

I assure you you will end up in jail.

If you want my advice, accept the

deportation and never come back.

185   EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- EVENING

A bus parks in front of the border. Several border patrol

agents have formed a wall for the illegal immigrants to pass

directly through.

The illegal immigrants get out and walk toward Mexico.   As

Amelia crosses, she keeps looking back.

186   EXT. BORDER CROSSING, MEXICO -- EVENING

The illegal immigrants cross into Mexico, where they disband

into small groups. Amelia walks alone. Before she walks

away she turns to one of the other deported Mexicans.

AMELIA

(In Spanish)

Do you have a cigarette?

He acquiesces. He rummages through his pant pockets and

pulls out a pack of cigarettes. He offers one to Amelia, who

takes it. He also pulls out some matches and lights one.

115.

AMELIA (CONT'D)

Thank you.

187   EXT. STREET, TIJUANA -- EVENING

Amelia smokes, drifting. After a while she sits on a sidewalk

and leans on a post. She looks into the street at the people

passing by and starts crying softly.

A dusty and battered pick up truck arrives. Inside are her

son and her comadre. Her son steps down and hugs her in

silence as she cries. Her comadre observes them from a

distance.

188   EXT. HAMLET -- EVENING

The truck is parked in front of Anwar's house. Richard and

Susan wait in the back while the boy, Anwar and the vet lean

on the hood.

Suddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them

and goes to land in an empty lot.

Anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The

helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze

of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some

starving dogs bark at it.

189   EXT. TOWN -- EVENING

They carry Susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. They

load her in carefully. Richard follows her through the wind

generated by the helicopter. Anwar catches up to them to say

goodbye.

ANWAR

Good luck, mister...

RICHARD

Thank you for everything.

Richard gives Anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately.

Richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred-

dollar bills, which Anwar rejects.

ANWAR

No sir, no... Allah be with you.

They look each other in the eye and then Richard gets into

the chopper. It takes off.

190   EXT. DESERT -- EVENING

The helicopter silently flies over the Moroccan desert.

116.

191   EXT. PARKING LOT, MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- EVENING

The hospital's perimeter is guarded by dozens of soldiers.

The security is impressive. A group of doctors and nurses

with a stretcher wait in the parking lot. Several journalists

and cameras observe.

Ken and his entourage await the helicopter's landing. The

helicopter approaches. The cameramen hurry to position

themselves for a better shot.

A reporter speaks to the camera.

REPORTER

In this helicopter is Susan Jones,

an American mother of two who was

seriously injured in a terrorist

attack. It appears fundamentalist

organizations planned the attack...

The helicopter settles softly in the parking lot. It is

immediately surrounded by several Moroccan soldiers. The

doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher.

Ken walks hurriedly toward the chopper, guarding himself

from the wind.

Susan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly

taken to the emergency room. Richard follows close behind

until his is intercepted by Ken.

KEN

Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford,

Ambassador to the United States.

Richard keeps running behind the stretcher.   Ken stops him.

KEN (CONT'D)

A first rate medical team is going

to tend to her, but if you want we

can take her to a hospital in Italy

as soon as she's stable...

RICHARD

Thank you...

KEN

There are lots of reporters waiting.

Is there anything you want to say to

the press? A statement against

terrorism?

Richard looks at him as if he doesn't know what he's talking

about.

117.

RICHARD

The last thing I'm worried about

right now is the fucking press.

He pulls away from Ken and follows Susan toward the E.R.

192   INT. HALLWAY, E.R., MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Several Moroccan doctors are examining Susan.    Richard

observes worriedly from a window.

One of the doctors comes out.

MOROCCAN DOCTOR

(In good English)

We're going to have to operate

immediately.

RICHARD

Is she going to be ok?

MOROCCAN DOCTOR

It's probable. We're going to try to

save her arm.   She's been bleeding

internally, and there's been some

clotting so there's a high risk of

gangrene.

RICHARD

(insistently, as if

he hadn't heard the

doctor)

But she's going to be ok?

The Moroccan doctor puts his hand on Richard's shoulder and

thinks about his answer.

MOROCCAN DOCTOR

Yes, she's going to be ok.

The doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his

wife through the glass.

The doctors are still prepping her.   Richard walks in.

193   INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

He stands next to Susan, who is unconscious. He looks at a

doctor and she moves to one side. Richard leans over and

kisses her.

He walks away and the nurses start to wheel her to the O.R.

194   INT. HALLWAY, MOROCCAN HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Richard is talking on the phone from an office.

118.

RICHARD

Amelia?

AMELIA (O.S.)

Yes sir.

RICHARD

How is everything?

AMELIA (O.S.)

Ok sir, Mrs. Rachel told me. I'm

very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?

RICHARD

They're going to operate now...

Amelia... take good care of the kids,

and don't tell them anything...

AMELIA (O.S.)

No sir, don't worry.

RICHARD

Put Mike on please.

A few seconds pass and Mike answers.   This is the phone call

from the beginning.

MIKE (O.S.)

Hi dad.

RICHARD

Hey sweetie, how are you?

MIKE (O.S.)

Dad, guess what? Today, at school,

they brought some baby chickens.

RICHARD

Oh really?

MIKE (O.S.)

I held one in my hand. He was really

little and he was all warm.

Richard starts to cry for the first time.

MIKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Dad, are you ok?

Richard tries to hold back his sobbing.

RICHARD

Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine.

The boy keeps talking while Richard cries.

119.

MIKE (O.S.)

And Mariana wanted to take one home,

but the teacher didn't let her...

195   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the

remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her

nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.

For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return

from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him.

Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.

They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her

notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.

Kenji reads them and looks at her.

KENJI

You don't have to apologize for

anything.

She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for

a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a

moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it

back in its place.

She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It

takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because

of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.

Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji.

Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes

it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast

pocket. She signals for him to read it later.

Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness

contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say

goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks

past her as she watches.

Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at

Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall.

He bows his head again and leaves.

Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.

196   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT

Kenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain

his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out.

197   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Kenji walks past the doorman.

120.

KENJI

Good night.

He keeps walking. On the other end of the lobby, at the

parking lot entrance, Yasujiro walks in.

The doorman calls Kenji as he is about to leave.

DOORMAN

Officer... officer...

Kenji stops.   Beside him is Yasujiro.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

This is the man you were looking

for.

Kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away

to leave them alone in the lobby.

KENJI

Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya.

YASUJIRO

Good evening, how can I help you?

KENJI

Sir, there was an incident and...

Yasujiro looks at him attentively. Kenji, still moved by

Chieko, looks distracted, confused.

KENJI (CONT'D)

I don't mean to bother you, but...

(a beat)

Do you own a .270 caliber Winchester

70 rifle with the registration

number...

Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook

and looks up the missing number.

KENJI (CONT'D)

UK-9023?

YASUJIRO

I don't remember the license, but I

did have a rifle like the one you

described.

KENJI

Is it true that you gave it to a Mr.

Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern

Morocco?

YASUJIRO

Hassan Ibrahim?

121.

KENJI

He says he was your guide in a hunt.

YASUJIRO

Hassan? Of course. He was a very

good guide and I gave him the rifle.

Hassan is a very kind man. Did

anything happen?

KENJI

There was an attempted murder with

that rifle, and the Moroccan police

want to confirm it's not off the

black market.

YASUJIRO

No, I gave it to him.

(a beat)

Is Hassan ok?

KENJI

I don't know.

Yasujiro remains silent for a moment.

YASUJIRO

Am I legally involved?

KENJI

Not for the moment. You may have to

go testify for your friend.

YASUJIRO

Can I leave now?

KENJI

Good night.

They both bow to say goodbye. Yasujiro walks toward the

elevator. Kenji calls out to him.

KENJI (CONT'D)

Excuse me.

Kenji approaches and Yasujiro awaits, expectant.

KENJI (CONT'D)

Your daughter told me about your

wife on the balcony. I'm very sorry.

YASUJIRO

What balcony?

KENJI

About how your wife killed herself

by jumping off the balcony.

122.

YASUJIRO

My wife never jumped off a balcony.

She shot herself in the head. My

daughter was the first to find her.

Kenji is left speechless.

YASUJIRO (CONT'D)

I've explained it to the police

several times. Don't bother us with

that anymore, please.

KENJI

I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother

you anymore. Good night.

He turns around and leaves the building.

198   EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- NIGHT

Kenji walks down the streets immersed in his thoughts.

199   INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Kenji sits in a half-empty bar.   He turns to the bartender.

KENJI

Another whisky.

The T.V. has been turned on to a Japanese newscast. Kenji

takes out Chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done,

closes his eyes. He looks around. Everybody seems to be

immersed in a world far from his own.

A reporter appears on T.V.

REPORTER

Susan Jones, the American woman

wounded in an attack in Morocco ten

days ago, left the hospital today,

heading to the United States...

Susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male

nurse and followed by Richard.

The bartender leans over to Kenji.

BARTENDER

Do you want something to eat?    I

could make you a sandwich.

KENJI

No thank you.

When he looks back at the news, the story has changed.   Kenji

drinks his whisky parsimoniously.

123.

200   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT

Yasujiro rides the elevator up, lost in thought.

201   EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

From the balcony, naked, Chieko observes the city stretching

before her.

Yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely

naked. There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.

Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this,

but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks

hurt, but whole.

Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko

holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks

at the city and then looks at her father's eyes.

He strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with

the massive city sprawling under them.
