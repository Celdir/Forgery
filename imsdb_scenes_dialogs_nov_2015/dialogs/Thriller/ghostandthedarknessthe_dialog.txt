MALE VOICE (over)

This is the most famous true story

of Africa. It happened a hundred

years ago, but even now, when

children ask about it, you do not

tell them at night.

(The FIGURE continues

to grow)

It began with the race to build a

railroad across Africa.

(beat)

But this is not about building a

railroad- it is about Patterson.

MALE VOICE (over)

Patterson was thirty. A brilliant

engineer. A fine man, but do not

become attached to him- there are

many fine men in this story but do

not become attached to any of them.

(beat)

So many of them die.

MALE VOICE (over)

And remember this: only the

impossible parts of what follows

really happened...

(Now the door opens

and we-)

BEAUMONT

(The great smile flashes)

John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm

Robert Beaumont.

(They shake hands)

Firm- I like that, tells me a lot

about you-

(beat)

-now why don't you tell me about me?

To get you started, many people find

me handsome, with a wonderful smile.

I'm sure you agree.

(Surprised, uncomfortable,

Patterson nods)

Winning personality, heaps of charm?

PATTERSON

My wife is the game player in the

family, sir.

BEAUMONT

Games?

(staring dead at Patterson)

Look at me closely, Patterson: I am

a monster. My only pleasure is

tormenting people who work for me,

such as yourself.

(again the smile - only

now it's chilling)

One mistake and I promise you this:

I'll make you hate me.

BEAUMONT

(pointing along the line)

We are building this railroad

across Africa for the glorious

purpose of saving Africa from the

Africans. And, of course, to end

slavery. The Germans and French

are our competition. We are ahead,

and we will stay ahead providing

you do what I hired you to do-

BEAUMONT

-build the bridge over the Tsavo

river. And be finished in four

months time. Can you do that?

PATTERSON

I'm sure you've examined my record.

So you know I've never yet been

late on a bridge.

BEAUMONT

You've never built in Africa.

PATTERSON

But I have in India- every country

presents problems.

BEAUMONT

You'll need your confidence, I

promise you.

PATTERSON

I've got a reason far beyond

confidence: my wife is having our

firstborn in five months and I

promised I'd be with her when the

baby comes.

BEAUMONT

Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched

you confided in me.

(beat)

But I don't really give a shit about

your upcoming litter. I've made you

with this assignment-

(the smile)

-don't make me break you.

PATTERSON

(smiling right back)

You won't have the chance.

(glancing at his watch)

Any further words of encouragement?

(silence)

Then I've a train to catch.

HELENA

I tried to be late, John- it would

have been easier if you'd gone.

PATTERSON

(They are nutty about

each other - he nods)

We're not much good at goodbyes,

Helena.

HELENA

(brightly)

Tell me about Beaumont- does he

understand how brilliant you are,

how lucky he is to have you?

PATTERSON

It was embarrassing- the man showered

me with compliments.

HELENA

Oh dear-

(beat)

-you're geting that downtrodden look

again-

PATTERSON

-well, it's just...

(beat)

...other men don't abandon their wives

at such a time-

HELENA

(not unkindly)

-oh please- if I'd been against your

taking this, you would have abandoned

me. You've been desperate to see Africa

your whole life.

PATTERSON

What if there are complications?-

HELENA

-not "what if"- there will be, there

always are. Which only means that our

"son" and I- note my confidence- will

have an excuse to come visit.

HELENA

Go, now.

(He kisses her hand)

Such a gentleman.

(Now he holds her)

PATTERSON

I am desperate to see Africa- but I

hate the leaving.

HELENA

You build bridges, John-

(beat)

-you've got to go where the rivers are.

STARLING

(as Patterson helps

him aboard)

Many thanks.

(squints)

You're Patterson, yes?

(Patterson nods)

Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you

at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must

have told you that.

PATTERSON

He just gave me his "monster" speech.

STARLING

That. I know Robert seems dreadful,

but when you truly get to know the man,

well, he's much worse.

(beat)

And I'm one of his defenders.

(Patterson smiles)

Forget him for now- it's your first

ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it

breathtaking.

(And on that word-)

PATTERSON

(shouting toward Starling)

"Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it

justice.

(As Starling starts to

laugh, his mouth opens

and sand flies in, and

his coughing fit returns

and)

STARLING

Aren't they amazing?

PATTERSON

You know the most amazing thing

about them?- they only sleep five

minutes a day.

(Starling glances at him-

clearly, he didn't know that)

STARLING

Don't much like them.

PATTERSON

(nods)

The females are bigger- only animal

here like that- have to be or they

wouldn't survive because the males

eat the young.

STARLING

Anything special about them?

PATTERSON

Just that they fart through their

mouths.

(beat)

Must make kissing something of a

gamble.

STARLING

(laughs)

I've lived in Africa a year and I

don't know what you know. How long

have you been here?

PATTERSON

(looks at his watch)

Almost three hours.

(beat)

But I've been getting ready all my

life.

(Now, from them-)

STARLING

(suddenly touched)

Every time I see something like that,

I know we're right to be here- to

bring Christianity into their lives,

enrich their souls.

PATTERSON

Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

STARLING

(shrugs)

We all have our reasons. Mine is

simply to make them understand

happiness, accept salvation, know the

serenity that comes-

(interrupts himself)

-best I stop. One of the by-products

of my belief is that I can become

amazingly boring. But I know God smiles

on me.

PATTERSON

(They really like each other)

Have you got that in writing?

(Starling, amazingly good

natured, laughs. And now-)

STARLING (over)

Welcome to Tsavo.

(on the word)

STARLING

(indicating Samuel,

who is approaching)

Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely

indispensable- the only man here

everyone trusts.

PATTERSON

(softly)

Does he speak English?

SAMUEL

(not softly enough)

And very poor French.

STARLING

(introducing)

Samuel- John Patterson.

SAMUEL

(as they shake)

The bridgebuilder-

(gesturing to the

working men)

-we have been getting ready for

you.

PATTERSON

Excellent. Could I see the bridge

site?

(Samuel nods)

STARLING

I've got medical supplies to

deliver. Come along to the hospital

when you're done.

(starting off)

SAMUEL

I will bring him, Nigel.

PATTERSON

Why do the workers look unhappy?

SAMUEL

Because they are here.

(beat)

Because Tsavo is the worst place in

the world.

(He points ahead)

Come, John- to the bridge.

(And on that-)

PATTERSON

(as they pass the INDIAN

tent area where prayer is

starting)

It's all wonderfully under control,

Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

SAMUEL

Thank you. The truth is this: you

have to work at it constantly.

PATTERSON

The workers don't get on?

SAMUEL

Get on? They detest each other.

Obviously the Africans hate the

Indians. But the Indians also hate

the other Indians. Some of them

worship cows, while others eat them.

(As they move on)

SAMUEL

(to the far side)

Railhead is across there.

SAMUEL

Three thousand men laying track- when

the bridge is done, it all joins up.

SAMUEL

Did it look like this in your mind?

PATTERSON

(shakes his head)

This is more difficult-

PATTERSON

(eyes bright)

-but how wonderful that it's

difficult, it should be difficult-

what better job in all the world

than build a bridge?- make things

connect- bring worlds together- and

get it right!

(Now from Patterson-)

STARLING

Finish your tour?

PATTERSON

(nods)

And anxious to get started.

(indicating the hospital)

What is this, mostly malaria?

STARLING

Yes- but their suffering is only

transitory- once they except God

into their hearts, He will vanquish

all pain.

MAN'S VOICE (over)

That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the

poor bastards will relapse if you keep

on that way.

(As they turn-)

HAWTHORNE

(to Patterson)

I'm David Hawthorne, this is my

hospital. And my advice to you is,

"don't get sick in front of it."

(beat)

That was meant to be charming,

sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

STARLING

You never had it.

HAWTHORNE

Nigel and I don't like each other much.

SAMUEL

(breaking the tension)

I am also liaison between these two.

PATTERSON

(to Hawthorne)

Clearly you don't agree about building

the railroad?

HAWTHORNE

This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?

It's only being built to control the

ivory trade, make men richer.

PATTERSON

Then why do you stay?

HAWTHORNE

Who else would hire me?

(to Starling)

Beat you to it, didn't I?

(beat)

Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a

little welcoming gift.

(Now he gestures and we-)

HAWTHORNE

This is Karim, one of my orderlies-

attacked by a man-eater earlier

today- first incident of that kind

here.

STARLING

(incredulous)

A man-eater attacks and you're such

a buffoon you almost forget to mention

it?

HAWTHORNE

Well, he got away, didn't he?

(to Patterson)

Riding a donkey not far from here

when the lion sprang on them- donkey

took the brunt of it- then suddenly

the lion ran off.

HAWTHORNE

I know it's your first day and of

course you must be tired from the

journey-

(beat)

-but what are you going to do about

it?

PATTERSON

(a long pause, then evenly-)

Karim will have to show me where it

happened. And of course, I'll need

the donkey.

(beat)

With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.

(And he walks out, leaving

an astonished Starling

staring after him)

STARLING

I couldn't believe it when you said

"sort it out." As if it were the most

normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum,

what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a

killer beast this evening, nothing

much else going on anyway."

PATTERSON

Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?

But that's all right- after all, I'm

responsible for everything that happens

here. And it certainly won't do much

for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

STARLING

(calling out)

You said "of course" you'd need the

donkey. Why "of course"?

PATTERSON

(taking a rifle,

moving outside)

We know three things about man-eaters.

First, they always return to where

they've attacked before. Second, they're

always old- they can't catch other

animals so they turn to us. And third,

they're always alone- they've been cast

out by their pride because they can't

keep up.

STARLING

I don't suppose I could watch.

PATTERSON

(delighted)

Might be exciting for you.

STARLING

I've never been all that adventurous.

I wouldn't be in the way?

PATTERSON

I'd love the company. And I've hunted

all my life.

STARLING

(gathering courage)

Well, why not? You seem so calm and

experienced.

(standing, teacup in hand)

Why not, indeed!

(Now from that-)

STARLING

(embarrassed)

I hate to be a bother, John, but the

cramp's getting worse.

(Pulls up his trousers-

his leg is knotted)

The pain is actually quite unbearable

now.

PATTERSON

Shhh.

STARLING

I'm sure you mean that to be comforting,

but-

PATTERSON

(interrupting)

-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

STARLING

That is precisely my plan- but back in

my tent.

(And he begins to climb down)

PATTERSON

They own the night- nobody moves when

there's a man-eater out there.

STARLING

John? I know this isn't the time to ask,

but-

PATTERSON

What?

STARLING

Since you'd only been here three hours

when we met, are you sure this is how

you hunt lions?

PATTERSON

Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse

than you think- I've never even seen one.

STARLING

(amazed)

...one shot...

PATTERSON

(even more amazed)

So that's what a lion looks like.

(Now from the tree-)

SAMUEL (over)

One shot- one-

SAMUEL

Patterson has made the nights safe

again.

SAMUEL

(mimes shooting)

BOOM!

(Now as the crowd

continues to grow-)

PATTERSON

(gesturing)

All right, I'd like to start the

embankments today-

(to Singh)

-sufficient supplies on hand?

SINGH

(nods)

More than.

STARLING

With much more on the way-

(loses balance, falls)

-John- we could have had this chat on

flatter ground-

PATTERSON

-true enough- but without the comedy

relief.

(Starling, amazingly good

natured, smiles, gets

back up)

PATTERSON

How lucky we are.

STARLING

Aren't we full of ourselves today?

(beat)

I think it's because of the lion.

PATTERSON

Possibly.

SINGH

(soft)

You know, I too have killed a lion.

STARLING

How many shots did you need?

SINGH

I used my hands.

PATTERSON

All right- thee second embankment

will go there.

(He gestures toward

the river)

STARLING

You do plan to mark it a bit more

precisely than just-

(imitating Patterson)

-"there."

PATTERSON

(smiling)

In your honor, Nigel. And you and

Singh will be in charge of building

them- and you'll also build the

roadbeds and the three foundation

pillars- and you'll be finished in

eight thrilling weeks.

STARLING

(very dubious)

John, it will not be easy.

PATTERSON

Nigel, you'll just have to use your

hands-

(And he smiles, repeating

Singh's gesture, both

palms out)

PATTERSON

What are they looking at?

SAMUEL

You- they cannot believe you're

still here.

PATTERSON

Nonsense.

SAMUEL

You don't know what Tsavo means, do

you?

(Patterson doesn't)

It means "slaughter"...

HAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)

What the lion must have done, once

he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin

off so he could drink his blood-

HAWTHORNE

-then he feasted on him, starting

with his feet-

STARLING

(evenb more upset)

-please- you needn't be so graphic-

HAWTHORNE

You intend "sorting this out" tonight?

PATTERSON

I'll try- but this feels so different-

that old lion I killed could never

carry off a man Singh's size.

STARLING

(maybe a little alarmed)

But you said they were always old.

PATTERSON

That's what the books say...

(Now from that-)

PATTERSON

You were contracted to work-

ABDULLAH

(gesturing around)

-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

PATTERSON

Let me see the sick.

ABDULLAH

(not backing off)

Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

PATTERSON

There is no reason for fear.

ABDULLAH

On that I choose to remain dubious.

(beat)

Two are dead now in two nights.

(And on that news-)

PATTERSON

(to Starling)

Second death? Where?-

STARLING

(gesturing)

-far end of camp- man wandering alone

at night. Hawthorne's examining the

body now.

(beat)

There's even less of him than of Singh.

PATTERSON

(just shakes his head)

But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be

that hungry this soon.

(getting control- he

looks to Samuel)

Samuel?

SAMUEL

We should construct thorn fences

around every tent area. Fires burning

at night.

PATTERSON

Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-

no one allowed out at night.

(to Abdullah)

Send half your men to the bridge, the

rest with these two.

(Abdullah nods)

And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But

I repeat- there is no reason for fear.

I will kill the lion and I will build

the bridge.

ABDULLAH

Of course you will, you are white, you

can do anything...

(They look at each

other. They are not

friends. Now-)

STARLING

Not good enough- look, it's got to

be tighter. Tighter.

STARLING

What a good week.

PATTERSON

You mean nobody died?

STARLING

(shakes his head)

We all worked together. Worthy deeds

were accomplished. I liked the labor.

(beat)

My mother insisted on piano lessons-

broke the dear woman's heart when I

turned out to be tone deaf- but she

still was always at me about being

careful with my hands.

(looks at them)

I like the blood, is that strange?

SAMUEL

Oh yes, I think so.

(Starling smiles, starts

to speak)

PATTERSON

Look out, Samuel, here it comes.

STARLING

Even you two must admit that it is a

glorious thing, what Man can

accomplish. When there is a common

splendid goal, there are no limits.

Think what we will accomplish when we

all have God's warmth in our hearts.

(Samuel's eyes have

closed; he begins to snore.

Patterson can't help

laughing)

STARLING

I am immune to your disdain.

(He looks at them now)

When I came here, I had but one small

goal: to convert the entire continent

of Africa.

(shakes his head)

Now I've decided to move on to

something really difficult: I will not

rest until both of you are safely in

the fold.

SAMUEL

I've had four wives, good luck.

STARLING

The struggle is the glory...

(HOLD ON the three friends)

SAMUEL

For you.

PATTERSON

(taking it)

Thank you, Samuel.

SAMUEL

(watching as Patterson

opens it)

Good news?

PATTERSON

(glancing at the letter)

I expect so- it's from my wife.

SAMUEL

Do you love her?

PATTERSON

I do, actually; very much.

SAMUEL

(his wonderful smile)

You give me hope, John.

(As he walks away-)

HELENA (over)

Darling one- the big excitement

yesterday was when some school-

children spotted a whale-

(pause)

-they were looking at me, John-

HELENA

That was an attempt at humor but I

don't feel very funny these days. I

miss you terribly and after our son-

I still have total confidence- well,

after he's born I think travel might

be broadening. As he kicks me at

night I'm quite sure he's telling me

he definitely wants to come to Africa.

(pause)

Thought you might need reminding.

PATTERSON

(dazed)

Jesus, two of them...

PATTERSON

(shouting over the noise

of the approaching train)

-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-

(gesturing toward the men

who stand by the train

tracks)

-there's nothing wrong with your men

so stop telling me there is-

ABDULLAH

(advancing on Patterson now)

-you do not call me a liar- you know

nothing of their health- consider

yourself fortunate I persuaded so

many to stay- consider yourself

fortunate I have decided to stay-

PATTERSON

(losing it)

You think you matter?

(gesturing toward the

train which is close to

stopping now)

-Beaumont is on that train- he

matters-

PATTERSON

He sees this chaos, he'll replace

you all.

ABDULLAH

He'll replace you, too- that's all

you really care about.

PATTERSON

You think so? Fine.

(finished arguing)

It's best you get out. Go. Tell all

your people to go, run home where

they'll be safe under the covers and

when the bridge is built and the

railroad is done, they can tell their

women that out of all the thousands

who worked here, they were the only

ones to flee-

(And he wheels around,

starts to walk away as we-)

PATTERSON

Pleasant journey?

BEAUMONT

(stepping off the train)

How could it be? I hate Africa.

BEAUMONT

Lovely sound- they seem happy.

PATTERSON

Don't they, though?

BEAUMONT

So work must be going well?

PATTERSON

(delicately)

Truthfully?

(beat)

There has been the occasional odd

hiccup- but then, as you so wisely

told me, I'd never built in Africa.

BEAUMONT

But overall, you're pleased?

SAMUEL

(moving in)

I have never experienced anything

like it.

BEAUMONT

I almost feel like getting right

back on.

(glances at his watch)

BEAUMONT

(a sigh)

I suppose it would be a dereliction

of duty not to at least look around.

PATTERSON

(waving)

Morning, friend, glorious day.

ABDULLAH

As are they all.

BEAUMONT

I do need to see Starling.

PATTERSON

(dully)

Starling?

BEAUMONT

Awhile back he ordered some bibles-

(indicating the box)

-I've brought them.

(looking around)

Is he here?

PATTERSON

(beat)

Yes he is.

BEAUMONT

Well, I need to speak to him.

SAMUEL

(helpfully)

Let me deliver the bibles.

BEAUMONT

Excellent show.

(voice low)

Where is Starling?

PATTERSON

Here he comes now.

(And on that-)

BEAUMONT

What in hell is going on?

SAMUEL

The Ghost and The Darkness have come.

BEAUMONT

(snapping)

In English.

PATTERSON

It's what the natives are calling

the lions-

(beat)

-two lions have been causing trouble-

BEAUMONT

-what's the surprise in that, this is

Africa?

PATTERSON

It hasn't been that simple so far.

BEAUMONT

What have they done besides kill

Starling?

(beat)

How many have they killed?

(Patterson nods for

Hawthorne to answer)

HAWTHORNE

Well, of course, I can't supply a

totally accurate answer because

there are those that are actually

authenticated and there are those

that we once thought were workers

killing each other or deserting

from camp so any number I give is

subject to error-

BEAUMONT

(cutting through)

How many?

HAWTHORNE

Thirty, I should think.

BEAUMONT

(stunned)

Christ!

(whirling on Patterson)

What are you doing about it?

(Now from there-)

BEAUMONT

This is supposed to be salvation?

(staring at Patterson)

What kind of idiocy are we dealing

with here?

PATTERSON

(keeping control)

I'm calling it my "contraption"-

we're going to surround it with a

boma- a fence, to you- and we're

going to leave a small opening

opposite that door.

PATTERSON

In that half will be bait- human

bait- I'll start things off-

(points to the open

doorway)

-a sliding door will fit above that

and a trip wire will run across

the floor.

BEAUMONT

(The smile is back)

Genius- the beast will enter,

tripping the wire, the door will

slide down, trapping him, you, safe

behind the bars, will have him at

your mercy and will shoot him.

BEAUMONT

Are you running a high fever, man?

How could you expect something as

lunatic as this to succeed? How

could you even conceive of it?

PATTERSON

I didn't conceive of it for the

lions- I built one in India when

there was trouble with a tiger.

BEAUMONT

(incredulous)

And it worked?

PATTERSON

(He hates to say this)

In point of fact, it didn't.

(hurrying on)

But I'm convinced the theory is

sound.

PATTERSON

What?

BEAUMONT

I made a mistake hiring you-

you're simply not up to the job.

(Silence. Then-)

PATTERSON

You genuinely enjoy trying to

terrify people, don't you? Well,

fine-

(lashing back)

-except there isn't a higher rated

engineer and we both know that. And

since time is so important to you,

how long do you think it would take

to find someone else qualified and

bring him here?

BEAUMONT

Let me explain about time- you've

been here three months and already

two months behind. And the Germans

and the French are gearing up. And

I don't care about you and I don't

care about the thirty dead- I care

about my knighthood and if this

railroad finishes on schedule, I'll

get my knighthood and I want it.

(glancing around as

Samuel appears, goes to

the workers)

Professional hunters may be the answer.

PATTERSON

All they'll bring is more chaos and

we've plenty of that already- and if

they come in, word will get out- and

what happens to your knighthood then?

BEAUMONT

I'm going to try and locate Redbeard-

I assume you've heard of him.

PATTERSON

Every man who's ever fired a rifle has

heard of him- by the time you find him,

the lions will be dead.

BEAUMONT

(long pause)

Very well, the job's still yours, I'll

go. But if I have to return, you're

finished. And I will then do everything

I can to destroy your reputation. Am I

not fair?

(The great smile flashes)

Told you you'd hate me.

(And he turns, walks off)

PATTERSON

(staring after Beaumont)

I do hate him.

(takes the bag from

Samuel, pulls out flares)

I want you to distribute one bag of

flares to every tent area-

(takes out a flare)

-tell the men to light them if

there's trouble-

(beat)

-make it two bags.

(HOLD briefly, then-)

PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)

"Dearest...

...peace and tranquility continue to

abound here- the workers report each

day with a smile- except for your

absence, this whole adventunre is

providing me nothing but pleasure..."

PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)

Fire.

PATTERSON

(impressed)

Very good indeed.

MIDDLE COOLIE

(he wears glasses)

We have hunted since childhood.

PATTERSON

All right- you'll spend your nights

inside.

(He indicates the railroad

car. The Coolies nod)

You'll have plenty of ammunition.

You're totally protected, you have

really nothing to fear.

MIDDLE COOLIE

That is correct.

(beat)

Nothing.

PATTERSON

Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-

MIDDLE COOLIE

-I would never make excuses- but a

fire broke out- the light was bad- he

kept moving-

PATTERSON

-well, of course he kept moving- but

he couldn't have been more than ten

feet away from the three of you- surely

you must have wounded the thing-

MIDDLE COOLIE

I assure you we came close many times-

MIDDLE COOLIE

-the next time we will do better.

(Patterson makes no

reaction; moves outside)

ABDULLAH

The next time will be as this time-

The Devil has come to Tsavo-

PATTERSON

(not in a mood for this)

-that's ridiculous talk and you can't

seriously believe it-

ABDULLAH

(moving in- tension rising

as others crowd behind him)

-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I

don't think so-

PATTERSON

I wasn't and you know it and don't

push it- just listen- we have a

problem in Tsavo-

ABDULLAH

(cutting in)

-at last you're right- we do- you are

the problem in Tsavo-

PATTERSON

-careful, Abdullah-

ABDULLAH

You do not tell me "careful"- you do

not tell me anything- you listen

while I talk-

(Now suddenly a shadow

seems to cross-)

MAN'S VOICE (over)

-change in plan- you listen while

I talk- because you have a question

that needs answering.

(beat)

Will I pull the trigger?

SAMUEL (over)

It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill

you.

REDBEARD

(not looking around)

No hints, Samuel.

ABDULLAH

(The name has registered)

You don't know all that has happened

here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

REDBEARD

You're right. The Devil has come. Look

at me. I am the Devil.

ABDULLAH

(louder)

I am a man of peace.

REDBEARD

Am I to take it you want to live?

ABDULLAH

Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

REDBEARD

Excellent decision.

(Now he suddenly reaches

out, shakes Abdullah's hand)

Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll

meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid

morning.

ABDULLAH

(dazed- leaving)

I think it's been a pleasure.

REDBEARD

(three words)

You got old.

(Now he releases Samuel,

turns to Patterson)

I'm sure you're John Patterson.

(before Patterson can reply)

Stay out of my way.

(And without another word,

he's gone)

PATTERSON

(as Redbeard approaches)

I didn't have a chance to thank you.

REDBEARD

(preoccupied)

What did I do?

PATTERSON

Got me out of trouble.

REDBEARD

(matter of fact)

Nonsense- Samuel would have done

something.

(starts to move on)

PATTERSON

We need to talk.

REDBEARD

Let me save time- (1) you are the

engineer; (2) you are in charge;

(3) you're sorry I'm here. Right

so far?

(Patterson nods)

Good- because (1) I am not an

engineer, (2) I don't want to be

in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than

you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo.

So I will help you by killing the

lions and leaving, and you will help

me by doing what I tell you so I

can leave. See any problems?

PATTERSON

Actually, no.

REDBEARD

All right- let's go into battle.

(suddenly taking

Patterson's hand)

I'm Redbeard.

(as they shake)

PATTERSON

Somehow I guessed.

(As they move outside-)

REDBEARD

Starting now, we attack them.

ABDULLAH

How; we don't know where they are?

REDBEARD

We'll have to make them come to us,

won't we? And since there are two of

them, we're going to set two plans

in motion.

(to Hawthorne)

First: we must move the entire

hospital by tomorrow night.

HAWTHORNE

(appalled)

That's a terrible idea-

REDBEARD

(backtracking)

-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of

course, you're the doctor, you

should know.

HAWTHORNE

Silliest thing I ever heard of- why

in the world should we go through

all that?

REDBEARD

(charming now)

I suppose I could answer you. I

suppose I could explain that the

place is so inviting, what with the

smell of blood and flesh, that they

have to strike. It's even possible

that I tell you I found some fresh

paw marks around back which means

they're already contemplating

feasting here.

(Turning on Hawthorne

now- his voice building)

But I don't want to answer you

because when you question me you are

really saying that I don't have the

least idea what I am doing, that I am

nothing but an incompetent, that I am

a fool.

(big)

Anyone who finds me a fool, please

say so now.

HAWTHORNE

(The words burst out)

I have been desperate for Patterson

to let me move the hospital since the

day he arrived.

REDBEARD

(nice smile)

Then we agree.

(And on that-)

SAMUEL

Soon.

(Redbeard nods)

PATTERSON

(to Redbeard)

I have to ask- why do you need me?

REDBEARD

I don't really. But understand

something- even though it may take

me two or three days to sort this

out-

(Patterson has to smile

at the phrase)

-when I'm gone, you'll still have

to build the bridge. And I don't

want the men to have lost respect

for you.

PATTERSON

(kind of surprised)

That's very considerate.

REDBEARD

I'm always considerate- my mother

taught me that.

REDBEARD

Why do you laugh?- you don't

believe she taught me?

SAMUEL

I don't believe you had a mother.

(And as Redbeard

laughs too-)

PATTERSON

You like him, don't you?

SAMUEL

Oh yes. But it takes time.

PATTERSON

You've known him long?

SAMUEL

(He has)

Since his beard was red.

SAMUEL

How many cattle?

REDBEARD

Four should do it.

SAMUEL

They will want a lot of money.

PATTERSON

(to Redbeard)

Have you got it?

REDBEARD

No, but you do-

(beat)

-see, you were needed after all.

(to Samuel)

And fifty warriors at the camp

before dawn.

SAMUEL

(Samuel explains. The

Masai Chief replies.

Translating)

Why so many?

REDBEARD

Because I have two plans to kill

the lions- one involving the cattle,

the other the men.

SAMUEL

(translating)

The Ghost and the Darkness have

come... and we can do nothing...

but if you anger them... they will

stay in Tsavo... and life will

become more unberable, that I know...

REDBEARD

(beat)

Two lions are all that have come...

they're only lions, that I know.

(beat)

And I will kill them both tomorrow.

(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)

REDBEARD VOICE (over)

I'll need you by me in the morning.

SAMUEL VOICE (over)

Whatever you wish.

HAWTHORNE

(terribly tense)

You're certain about tomorrow?

(Redbeard is)

But you don't seem excited.

(Redbeard isn't)

PATTERSON

You don't enjoy killing, do you?

(Redbeard doesn't)

HAWTHORNE

Then why do it?

REDBEARD

I have a gift.

HAWTHORNE

Strange man.

(to Samuel)

Has he always been this way?

SAMUEL

Much gentler now.

HAWTHORNE

(shakes his head on that)

John?-

(He holds out his

beautiful rifle)

Change guns with me- mine's much

more powerful. I'll be finishing

the hospital tomorrow so I won't

be with you- but if you'll use

this...

(beat)

...then I will.

PATTERSON

Thank you.

(He turns to Samuel)

Why does he need you by him?

SAMUEL

He doesn't. He needs nobody. But

we have hunted many times...

(beat)

...he knows I am afraid of lions...

REDBEARD

(whispered)

I spotted one of them-

(gesturing toward

the thicket)

-in there.

REDBEARD

The best way to ensure the kill

when you're using trackers is for

one to shoot while the other uses

the trackers to force the lion

toward the shooter. Have you ever

led trackers?

PATTERSON

(He hasn't)

I can try.

REDBEARD

(no good)

Samuel says you killed a lion.

PATTERSON

It was probably luck- I'd rather

you did the shooting.

REDBEARD

You'd never force the lion to me-

and nobody ever got a lion with

one shot by luck.

(points- hand out

straight)

Around there's a clearing- you'll

know it from the anthills- get

there and hide and listen to the

sounds- I'll make the lion come

directly to you.

(He gestures for

Patterson to take

off and as he does-)

REDBEARD

(as Samuel translates)

-all of you- spread the width of

the clearing- no gaps- go-

(claps his hands once)

REDBEARD

Shoot for chrissakes!-

SAMUEL

Did you ever see a lion that size?

REDBEARD

Not even close.

(Now he moves to

Patterson)

What happened?

PATTERSON

(a whisper)

...misfire... it jammed...

REDBEARD

Has it ever done that before?

PATTERSON

...don't know...

SAMUEL

It's Hawthorne's.

REDBEARD

You exchanged weapons?

(Patterson nods)

You went into battle with an

untried gun?

(Patterson nods)

REDBEARD

They have an expression in

prizefighting: "everyone has a plan

until they're hit."

(beat)

You've just been hit...

(beat)

...the getting up is up to you...

(And he turns, moves

off and)

REDBEARD

(to the Orderlies)

Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell

at all here, and little blood. When

we leave, close the gate securely,

don't open it til morning and keep

your fires high. Any questions, ask

them now.

(They understand- now

to Samuel and Hawthorne)

You two will sleep beautifully in

your tents.

(beat)

And stay there.

SAMUEL

And where will you sleep beautifully?

REDBEARD

(smile)

Patterson and I will be in the old

hospital- where the enticing smell

of sickness still lingers-

(beat)

-and by the time we're done, I

promise you, the odor of blood will

be irresistible.

(And on that-)

REDBEARD

Think about something else.

PATTERSON

Have you ever failed?

REDBEARD

(sad smile)

Only in life...

(He walks away.

Patterson watches.)

PATTERSON

Goddammit!

REDBEARD

It's all right. Stay ready.

(indicates the blood)

They know it's there.

REDBEARD

(going to him)

Meant to ask you- the railroad car

trap. Your idea?

(Patterson nods)

Excellent notion- I used the same

device myself once.

PATTERSON

But of course yours worked.

REDBEARD

In point of fact it didn't- but I'm

convinced the idea is sound.

REDBEARD

(out of the blue)

It would have been a beautiful

bridge, John. I never noticed

before, occupied with other

business, I	suppose...

(He's rambling)

...never really pay much attention

to that kind of thing but I've had

the time today, nothing else on,

and this... it's graceful and the

placement couldn't be prettier...

and...

(He goes silent now,

stares off)

PATTERSON

You just got hit.

(Redbeard nods)

The getting up is up to you- but

they're only lions-

(beat)

-and I'm going after them crack

of dawn...

(And on that-)

REDBEARD

In my town, when I was little,

there was a brute, a bully who

terrorized the place.

(beat)

But he was not the problem. He

had a brother who was worse than

he. But the brother was not the

problem.

(beat)

One or the other of them was

usually in jail. The problem came

when they were both free togther.

The two became different from

either alone.

(beat)

Alone they were only brutes.

Together they became lethal,

together they killed.

PATTERSON

What happened to them?

REDBEARD

(pause)

I got big.

(They move on)

REDBEARD

Dear God-

(And on those words-)

PATTERSON

Their den?

(Redbeard nods)

Have you ever seen anything like

this?

REDBEARD

Nobody's seen anything like this.

Lions don't have caves like this-

(beat)

-they're doing it for pleasure.

REDBEARD

One of my chief attributes is that

I'm always calm.

PATTERSON

(The words pour out)

Where could it have gone? How

could it get across the water?

(looks at Redbeard)

They're only lions, yes?

REDBEARD

(shakes his head; he

doesn't know)

Don't they have to be?...

SAMUEL

(pointing)

Both of them over there.

PATTERSON

Ever have to use a machan?

(Redbeard hasn't)

I did once. In India. We will

tonight.

(Now from that-)

PATTERSON

They're used to people in trees,

not in a clearing.

(indicating the plank)

It may be tight.

REDBEARD

Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's

your idea, you go up there.

(to Samuel)

Take the others to the water tower

for the night.

PATTERSON

I'll be bait alone?

REDBEARD

Yes. And I'll be in some distant

tree where I can provide no

assistance whatsoever.

(beat)

Can you control your fear?

PATTERSON

I'll have to.

REDBEARD

I can't control mine- I'd be lost

without the shame factor driving me.

PATTERSON

Was that supposed to make me feel

better?

(Redbeard doesn't

reply. Now-)

REDBEARD

(glancing around)

It's certainly the best chance

they've had to kill you.

PATTERSON

You think they'll come then?

(Redbeard does)

Why?

REDBEARD

(not answering)

Good luck.

PATTERSON

Why?

REDBEARD

(beat)

Because I think they're after you.

PATTERSON

How many do you think they've

killed?

REDBEARD

(reluctantly)

The most of any lions... a

hundred...?

(beat)

Probably more.

(Now Redbeard looks

up at the younger man)

Johnny...?

REDBEARD

Don't fuck up.

(And he turns, never

looks back, just goes)

BEAUMONT

I think another for posterity-

this is an important moment in

my life.

BEAUMONT

Understand, I had help-

PATTERSON

-not a time for modesty, Bob-

REDBEARD

-undeniably your triumph.

BEAUMONT

Oh surely there's enough credit

for us all- let's not forget, you

did the actual shooting. Of course,

I hired you, I was the general who

put the team together. And generals

are the ones who tend to be

remembered.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Perhaps you might put your head in

its mouth, sir- could be a corker.

BEAUMONT

Clever idea, I like it.

PATTERSON

(drunk)

I never thought I'd say this, but

I'm glad you came.

REDBEARD

(drunk)

Understood- you realize now you

could never have done it without

me.

PATTERSON

Actually, I could have done it

much more easily without you, but

for whatever reason, I'm glad you

came.

(They toast each other)

SAMUEL

(drunk)

Where do you go next?

REDBEARD

Some Russian princes want to hunt

the Himalayas. You?

SAMUEL

Help finish the railroad.

PATTERSON

I want to meet my son- he must be

what, two months old?

SAMUEL

Three years I've worked for the

railroad. Now I don't know why. It

seemed a good idea once.

PATTERSON

I feel the same about the bridge.

This country certainly didn't ask

for it, doesn't need it.

REDBEARD

Too soon to tell.

REDBEARD

My life was shaped because someone

invented gunpowder. Our lives have

crossed because two lions went mad.

But what if in the future the three

of us do something grand for

humanity? Was that worth all the

lives? Too soon to tell.

SAMUEL

(drinks)

Some mysteries should not have

solutions.

REDBEARD

(finishes his bottle,

rises, looks at Patterson)

Hold your son high.

(And he turns, goes

to his tent)

PATTERSON

(beat- quietly)

He has children?

SAMUEL

(beat- quietly)

Once...

(HOLD on the two

in the firelight. Then-)

FEMALE VOICE (over)

I'd like to see John Patterson,

please.

(As he looks up-)

HELENA

Could you tell him that his wife-

(catches herself, smiles)

-that his family has come to see him.

(On that-)

PATTERSON

You're positive lions hate baboons?

(Samuel is)

Pebbles?

(Samuel holds up a bag)

Let's get it over with.

PATTERSON

Where is it?

SAMUEL

(pointing down)

Underneath.

(beat)

Somewhere.

SAMUEL

(embarrassed)

Afraid of lions.

PATTERSON

It's all right, Samuel- we all

get hit-

(Now he shuts up

fast and-)

PATTERSON

Samuel!

(And he gestures for

the rifle and the

instant he does-)

SAMUEL VOICE (over)

Here we still wonder about them.

How did they escape for nine months?

And kill 135 men? And stop the

railroad?

(beat)

And were they only lions?

(beat)

If you want to decide for yourself,

you must go to America. They are at

the Field Museum in Chicago, and

even now, after they have been dead

a century, if you dare to lock eyes

with them...

(beat)

...you will be afraid.

SAMUEL VOICE (over)

Sleep well.
