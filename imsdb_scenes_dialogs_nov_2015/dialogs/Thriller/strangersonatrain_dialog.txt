MAN'S VOICE (over scene)

Oh, excuse Me!

BRUNO

(smiling with sudden

recognition)

I beg your pardon, but aren't you

Guy Haines.

BRUNO

(snapping his finger)

Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right

off the court in South Orange last

season. What a backhand! Made the

semi-finals, didn't you?

BRUNO

(with open admiration)

I certainly admire people who do

things.

(smiling and

introducing himself)

I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy

looks up. Bruno indicates his gold

tie pin which bears his name in cut-

out letters. Guy looks at it with

the faintest expression of disdain.

I suppose you think it's corny. But

my mother gave it to me so of course

I wear it to please her.

GUY

(patiently)(a faint

smile)

How do you do.

BRUNO

(with an apologetic

grin)

I don't usually talk so much.   Go

Ahead and read.

GUY

(wryly)

Thanks.

BRUNO

It must be pretty exciting to be so

important.

GUY

(fidgeting slightly)

A tennis player isn't so important.

BRUNO

People who do things are important.

I never seem to do anything.

BRUNO

(still insistent on

being friendly)

I suppose you're going to Southampton --

for the doubles.

GUY

(politely)

You are a tennis fan.

BRUNO

Wish I could see you play. But I've

got to be back in Washington tomorrow.

I live in Arlington, you know.

BRUNO

Cigarette?

GUY

Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much.

BRUNO

I smoke too much.

BRUNO

Thanks.

(he stares at the

lighter, impressed)

Elegant.

BRUNO'S VOICE

(reading)

To G from A. Bet I can guess who A

is.

GUY

(coldly)

Yes?

BRUNO

Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the

sport page and look at the society

news. And the pictures. She's very

beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.

GUY

You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.

BRUNO

Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from

today's stock reports to Li'l Abner,

and I got the answer.

BRUNO (CONT'D)

Even news about people I don't know.

Like who'd like to marry whom when

his wife gets her divorce.

GUY

(sharply)

Perhaps you read too much.

BRUNO

(contritely)

There I go again. Too friendly. I

meet someone I' like and open my yap

too wide. I'm sorry...

GUY

That's all right. Forget it.    I

guess I'm pretty jumpy.

BRUNO

There's a new cure for that.

(to waiter)

Scotch and plain water. A pair.

Double.

(to Guy with a chuckle)

Only kind of doubles I play.

GUY

You'll have to drink both of them.

BRUNO

(grinning)

And I can do it.

(moving in)

When's the wedding?

GUY

What?

BRUNO

The wedding. You and Anne Burton.

(a gesture of

explanation)

It was in the papers.

GUY

It shouldn't have been. Unless

they've legalized bigamy overnight.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             6.

BRUNO

I have a theory about that. I'd

like to tell you about it some time.

But right now I suppose divorce Is

still the simplest operation.

GUY

(as if he needs it)

I guess I will.

BRUNO

(happily)

This is wonderful -- having your

company all the way to New York.

GUY

(forced to explain)

As a matter of fact, I'm not going

direct. I'm stopping off. At

Metcalf.

BRUNO

Metcalf? What would anybody want to

go there for?

GUY

It's my home town.

BRUNO

Oh, I get it! A little talk with

your wife to about the divorce! I

suppose she was the girl next door.

Held her hand in high school and

before you knew it -- hooked!

(proud of his

perspicacity)

Am I right?

GUY

(laconically)

Close enough.

BRUNO

(raises his glass)

Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up --

then we'll have some lunch sent to

my compartment.

GUY

Thanks very much. But I think I'll

go to the dining car.

(he hails a waiter

who is passing through

with a food-laden

tray)

Do you know if there are any vacant

seats in the dining car now?

WAITER

Not for about twenty minutes I'm

afraid, Sir.

BRUNO

(pleased)

See? You'll have to lunch with me.

(motions the waiter

back)

Say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops

and French fries and chocolate ice

cream, Compartment D, Car 121.

(turns to Guy)

What'll you have, Guy?

GUY

Thanks just the same, but I really

don't think --

BRUNO

Oh, go on and order.

GUY

Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and

a cup of coffee.

BRUNO

(delighted, lifts his

glass in another

toast)

To the next Mrs. Haines.

BRUNO

Sure, I went to college. Three of

them. Every time they kicked me out

my father threw me back in.

(bitterly)

He finally gave up. He thinks I'm

awfully small fry, not worth the

bait.

(wistfully)

You my friend, Guy?

GUY

Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.

BRUNO

(a little woozy)

No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm

anything special. Only my mother.

(empties the bottle

into his glass)

My father hates me.

GUY

You must be imagining things.

BRUNO

(hitting the bottom

of the bottle for

the last drop)

And I hate him. He thinks   I ought

to catch the eight-five bus  every

morning, punch a timeclock  and work

my way up selling paint or  something.

Him -- with all his money!

GUY

(amused by Bruno)

Well, what do you want to do?

BRUNO

You mean before or after I kill him?

GUY

(chuckling)

Before, of course.

BRUNO

(leaning forward

eagerly)

I want to do everything. I got a

theory you're supposed to do

everything before you die. Have you

ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a

hundred and fifty miles an hour?

GUY

Not lately.

BRUNO

I did. I flew in a jet plans too.

(his hand traces a

swift streak through

the air, and he adds

sound effects)

Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill!

Almost blow the sawdust out of my

head. I'm going to make a reservation

on the first rocket to the moon...

GUY

(amused and curious)

What are you trying prove?

BRUNO

I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.

You're smart. Marrying the boss's

daughter is a nice short cut to a

career, isn't it?

GUY

(quickly)

Marrying the senator's daughter has

nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow

look past a tennis not without being

a goldbricker?

BRUNO

Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend,

remember? I'd do anything for you.

GUY

(humoring Bruno)

Sure, Bruno, sure.

(MORE)

GUY (CONT'D)

(glancing at his watch)

We'll be pulling in soon. I've got

to change trains.

BRUNO

What'd you say her name was -- your

wife's?

GUY

Miriam.

BRUNO

That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines.

Played around a lot, I suppose?

GUY

Let's not talk about it any more.

BRUNO

(almost hopefully)

Maybe she'll make more trouble for

you.

GUY

I don't think so.

BRUNO

You mean you got enough on her to

get your divorce no matter what?

GUY

Let's change subject, Bruno, can't

we?

BRUNO

Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one

of my ideas for murdering my father?

GUY

(indicating the

detective novels)

You've been reading too many of these.

BRUNO

(going right on)

You want to hear about the busted

light socket in the bathroom, or the

carbon monoxide in the garage?

GUY

No. I may be old fashioned, but I

thought murder was against the law.

BRUNO

But not against the law of nature.

My theory is that everybody is a

potential murderer. Didn't you ever

want to kill somebody? Say one of

those useless fellows Miriam was

running around with?

GUY

You can't go around killing people

just because you think they're

useless.

BRUNO

Oh, what's a life or two? Some people

are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --

wife and my father, for instance.

It reminds me of a wonderful idea

had once. I used to put myself to

sleep at night -- figuring it out.

Now, let's say you want to get rid

of your wife.

GUY

Why?

BRUNO

Let's say she refuses to give you a

divorce --

(raises a finger and

stops Guy's protest)

Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill

her because you'd get caught. And

what would trip you up? Motive.

Now here's the plan...

GUY

I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.

BRUNO

(ignoring the remark)

It's so simple, too. A couple of

fellows meet accidentally, like you

and me. No connection between them

at all. Never saw each other before.

Each of them has somebody he'd like

to get rid of, but he can't murder

the person he wants to get rid of.

He'll get caught. So they swap

murders.

GUY

Swap murders?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               12.

BRUNO

Each fellow does the other fellow's

murder. Then there is nothing to

connect them. The one who had the

motive isn't there. Each fellow

murders a total stranger. Like you

do my murder and I do yours.

GUY

(with relief)

We're coming into my station.

BRUNO

For example, your wife, my father.

Criss-cross.

GUY

(sharply)

What?

BRUNO

(with a smile)

We do talk the same language -- don't

we, Guy?

GUY

(preparing to leave)

Sure, we talk the same language.

Thanks for the lunch.

BRUNO

(beaming)

I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought

the lamb chops were a little overdone

myself.

GUY

Nice meeting you, Bruno.

BRUNO

(detaining him at the

door)

You think my theory is okay, Guy?

You like it?

GUY

Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay.

goodbye and hurries

away)

off)

Well -- hello, Guy.

GUY

You're looking well, Miriam.

MIRIAM

So are you. You've got a nice tan,

playing tennis with all your rich

friends.

What time do we meet your lawyer?

What's your hurry?

GUY

My hurry? That's funny, coming from

you! You're the one who's in a hurry,

aren't you?

MIRIAM

(coyly)

When you wouldn't give me the divorce

right away, I sort of hoped it was

because you were a little bit jealous.

GUY

(biting)

I got over being jealous, a long

time ago Miriam.

MIRIAM

(indicating empty

glass cubicle)

Let's talk in there.

MIRIAM

(intimately)

Now this is cosier. Sort of like

old times, isn't it, Guy?

GUY

(coldly)

Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty

late to start flirting with a

discarded husband. Especially when

you're going to have another man's

baby.

MIRIAM

Do you know, I think you're handsomer

than ever?

GUY

Let's see your lawyer and get this

over with.

MIRIAM

Did you bring the money, Guy?   Lawyers

are expensive.

GUY

(taking money from

his wallet)

Here it is.

MIRIAM

(taking the money

greedily)

If I'd known what all that tennis

nonsense of yours was going to lead

to, I wouldn't have run out on you.

GUY

What are you trying to say, Miriam?

Come out with it.

MIRIAM

(tucking the bills

away)

I'm not getting a divorce.

GUY

(tense and angry)

Why, you little doublecrosser. I

didn't want this divorce, you did.

That's what you've been harping about

for the past year.

MIRIAM

It's a woman's privilege to change

her mind... Now I can shop for some

pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you

to be ashamed of me in Washington

when we go to all those dinners and

swanky parties.

GUY

And what do you mean by that?

MIRIAM

(Coyly)

Don't look so mad, Guy. You always

smile when your picture is being

taken for the papers.

So, it's really serious between you

two? Well, you can throw your dreams

about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm

coming to Washington.

GUY

What for?

MIRIAM

To have my baby and be with you.

GUY

Why me?   It's not my baby.

MIRIAM

But people don't know that, Guy, do

they? It would make a pretty story,

wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter

involved with a married man who's

about to become a father.

GUY

(furiously)

You black conniving little liar!

MIRIAM

Keep your voice down.

GUY

What happened? Did he run out on

you?

MIRIAM

No man runs out on me.   Not even

you.

GUY

You're a liar and a  cheat,   Miriam.

enough and now I'll  go you   one better --

again.

calmly)

Yes, I know how you must feel.

But you sound so savage.

GUY

Sure I sound savage. I feel savage.

I'd like to break her neck!

poisonous, useless little neck!

You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But

Sit down, Barbara.

SENATOR

(finding it difficult

There seems to be no way of

diplomatically breaking tragic news.

I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to

tell you. It concerns your wife.

She's been murdered.

BARBARA

The police have been using everything

but radar to locate you.

SENATOR

You're to call Headquarters at

Metcalf.

GUY

Miriam...murdered.

ANNE

(with inner tension)

She was...strangled.

SENATOR

(wrylt, to Guy)

It happened on an island in an

amusement park. It was sort of a

lovers lane, I believe. A rather

sordid atmosphere.

BARBARA

(quickly, to Guy)

Miriam went there with two boys.

They were the ones who found her.

So they're not suspects. But you

probably will be.

SENATOR

Young lady, we can't overlook the

fact that murder is at our doorsteps.

But I forbid you to drag it into the

living room!

BARBARA

(wide-eyed)

Let's not fool ourselves. The police

will say Guy wanted Miriam out of

the way so he could marry Anne. In

a crime of this sort the police first

go after the husband, and Guy had

every motive.

SENATOR

(aghast)

Motive?

GUY

She's right. Whichever way you look

at it...I'm in a spot.

DETECTIVE

Mr. Turley! Mr. Turley!

(indicating boatman)

He says this isn't the man we want.

(with a nod in Guy's

direction)

It's the other one -- the one he was

fighting with.

TURLEY

(stops to give his

full attention to

this unexpected bit

of information)

What   do you mean, this isn't the --

(turns to Guy, not

quite taking it in)

Not   Haines?

(back to boatman)

But   you said he was. You pointed

him   out.

BOATMAN

No, I didn't, sir. I've never seen

this man before in my life. I meant

the other one.

TURLEY

What is this all about, Haines?        Did

you know he killed your wife?

GUY

(nods)

He has my cigarette   lighter and wanted

to plant it there on   the island to

pin the whole thing   on me.

(urgently)

Let me talk to him.      Let me show

you. Where is he?

ANOTHER DETECTIVE

Over here.

POLICEMAN

This one's in a pretty bad way, Mr.

Turley.

GUY

(looking down at Bruno)

Can't you get that stuff off him?

POLICEMAN

No, they've done everything they can

until the crane comes.

BRUNO

Hello, Guy.

BRUNO

(weakly nodding at

Turley)

Who's that?

GUY

This is Mr. Turley, Chief of Police.

BRUNO

(with a half smile)

So they got you at last, eh, Guy?

GUY

(rather gently)

Can you talk a little? Can you tell

the chief you have my lighter?

BRUNO

(with a faint,

quizzical smile)

I haven't got it. It's still on the

island where you left it.

DETECTIVE

(looking down at Bruno)

I think he's going.

DETECTIVE'S VOICE

He's finished.

TURLEY

Is this your lighter, Haines?

TURLEY

Well, you were right.

(sticks the lighter

into his own pocket)

I'd better keep this for the time

being.

(in a friendly tone)

We can clear the whole thing out the

morning. How about staying in town

over night, Haines? I imagine you

have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock,

all right?

GUY

(nods)

Okay, Mr. Turley.   Thanks.

GUY

Can you tell me where there's a

telephone?

BOATMAN

(indicating)

There's one up near the entrance.

(with a look back to

the dead Bruno)

Who was he, Bud?

GUY

Bruno. Bruno Antony.

(reminiscently and a

little

compassionately,

remembering what

Bruno had said of

himself)

A very clever fellow.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNE

(into phone)

Hello...

(impatiently)

Yes, operator, yes!

(waits a moment, then

eagerly:)

Guy?

ANNE (CONT'D)

(a pause, then she

closes her eyes with

heartfelt relief.

Another pause, then:)

Yes, darling, yes. Of course I'll

be there...Goodbye.

ANNE

Guy'll be back tomorrow.

(overcome with emotion

she has difficulty

in speaking)

He wants me to take him some things.

ANNE

He says he looks silly in his tennis

clothes.

SENATOR

I presume from all those tears that

you have had good news.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLERIC

I beg your pardon, but aren't you

Guy Haines?

GUY

(uncomfortably)

Yes.

FADE OUT.
