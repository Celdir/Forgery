SILENCE-

REST:

MISSION CONTROL

(On radio, faint)

Explorer, please verify that the P1

ATA removal on replacement cap part 1

and 2 are complete.

EXPLORER CAP

(On radio, faint)

DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.

MISSION CONTROL

(On radio, faint)

Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston,

requesting status update...

RYAN

Installation ninety-five percent

complete. Running level one

diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and

power. Standby.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Standing by. Looks like we're on

schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is

concerned about your ECG readings.

RYAN

I'm fine Houston.

MISSION CONTROL

(RADIO)

Well, medical doesn't agree doctor.

Are you feeling nauseous?

RYAN

Not any more than usual, Houston.

Diagnostics are green. Linking to

communications card. Ready for data

reception. If this works, when we

touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all

you guys a round of drinks.

MISSION CONTROL

(RADIO)

That's a date, doctor. Just remember,

Houston is partial to Margaritas.

RYAN

OK, here we go... Booting comm card

now. Please confirm link.

(BEAT)

Houston, please confirm reception of

data.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Negative. We're not seeing any data.

RYAN

Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot

the comm card.

MISSION CONTROL

(RADIO)

Standing by.

ASTRONAUT

Houston, I have a bad feeling about

this mission.

MISSION CONTROL

Please expand.

MATT

Okay, let me tell you a story. It was

'96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every

time I passed over Texas, I'd look

down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky,

was looking up, thinking of me. Six

weeks I'm blowing kisses to that

woman. Then we land at Edwards and I

find out she'd run off with a lawyer

before I was off the launch pad, so I

packed my car and I headed to...

MISSION CONTROL

Tijuana. You've told this story,

Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she

took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering

requests fuel status on the jet pack

prototype.

MATT

Five hours off the reservation and I

show 30% drain. My compliments to

Engineering. Except for a slight

malfunction on the nulling of the roll

axis, this jetpack is one prime piece

of thrust.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Engineering says thank you.

MATT

Tell them I still prefer my '67

Corvette though. Speaking of which did

I ever tell you the--

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

We know the Corvette story, Matt.

MATT

Even Engineering?

MISSION CONTROL

Especially engineering. We're going

to miss you, Matt.

RYAN

Comm card reboot in progress.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your

status?

SHARIFF

Nearly there. Replacing battery module

A1 and C.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Could you be more specific?

Indeterminate estimates make Houston

anxious.

SHARIFF

No... no... no Houston, don't be

anxious. Anxiety is not good for the

heart... The system is ready to re-

activate.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade

fully functional. That applause you

hear is for you, Shariff.

Congratulations. Kick back, take the

rest of the day off.

SHARIFF

(SINGING)

Woohoo... Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana

Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Matt, please advise as to Mission

Specialist Shariff's current activity.

MATT

He appears to be doing the Macarena of

some sort. Though that would merely be

a best guess scenario on my part.

MISSION CONTROL

Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have

you with a temperature drop to 35.9

and heart rate rise to 70.

How are you doing?

RYAN

Houston, I'm fine, it's just...

(SHE SWALLOWS)

...Keeping your lunch down in zero G

is harder than it looks.

MISSION CONTROL

Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you

want to return to Explorer?

RYAN

No, we've been here for a week

Houston, let's just finish this.

RYAN (CONT'D (CONT'D)

Card is up.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

That's a negative. I'm afraid we're

getting nothing on this end, doctor.

RYAN

Try again.

MISSION CONTROL

(a beat, then...)

Still nothing.

RYAN

Houston, could you please turn that

music off?

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Kowalsky?

MATT

Not a problem.

RYAN

Thank you, Kowalsky.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Now, Houston?

MISSION CONTROL

Negative.

RYAN

Could Houston be misinterpreting the

data--?

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

We're not receiving any data.

Engineering is recommending a vis-

check for component damage.

RYAN

Mmmm. Let me see what's going on.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(MUMBLES)

What have you got here?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Visual examination doesn't reveal any

damaged components. The problem must

be originating in the comms panel.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

That seems to be the case. Engineering

admits that you warned us that this

could happen. That's as close to an

apology as you're going to get from

them. We should've listened to you

doc.

TELESCOPE-

RYAN

I'm on it.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Copy that. How long do you think it'll

take you?

RYAN

An hour.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Outstanding. We appreciate your

patience, Doctor. Installing your

system in the Hubble is the main

purpose of this mission.

MISSION CONTROL (CONT'D)

Houston trusts Mission Commander

Kowalsky realizes that this delay is

not of sufficient duration to enable

him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's

spacewalking record, as most recent

calculations indicate that he will be

left...

MATT

Seventy-five minutes shy. Never

crossed my mind.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Matt, It's been a privilege.

MATT

Right back atcha, Houston.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Enjoy your last walk...

MATT

Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in

removing the panel?

RYAN

Assistance appreciated.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Permission granted.

MATT

Thank you, Houston.

(TO RYAN)

Mind if I join the fun?

RYAN

Certainly.

MATT

How are you feeling?

RYAN

Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble

dried.

MATT

It's been a rough week. If it makes

you feel any better, I puked up

everything but my kidneys on my first

ride.

COMES OFF-

RYAN

Whoa...! AWOL!

RYAN (CONT'D)

Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab

things usually fall to the floor.

MATT

Hey -- you're the genius up here. I

just drive this bus.

RYAN

Call me a genius if I can get this

board initialized in the next hour.

MISSION CONTROL

Explorer, this is Houston.

EXPLORER CAP

Go ahead Houston.

MISSION CONTROL

NORAD reports a satellite has incurred

a missile strike. The impact has

created a cloud of debris orbiting at

20,000 miles per hour. Current debris

orbit does not overlap with your

trajectory. We'll keep you posted on

any developments.

RYAN

Should we be worried?

MATT

Let the boys down there worry for us.

RYAN

Explorer, engage arm and pivot to

cargo bay.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Standby for arm maneuver.

MATT

So doc, now that you work for NASA,

how do you like it?

SHARIFF

Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't

it?

RYAN

I was just happy that they didn't cut

the funding to my research.

MATT

How long was your training?

RYAN

Six months.

SHARIFF

Including holidays?

MATT

So, what is this scanning system?

SHARIFF

Nothing rad, it's just a new set of

eyes to scan the universe.

RYAN

Assuming it works, it's just for

hospital use. This one is a prototype.

EXPLORER CAP

Standby for marking.

MATT

Listen, they don't bankroll

prototypes, even for your pretty blue

eyes.

RYAN

My eyes are brown.

MATT

Right now your eyes are blood shut.

SHARIFF

Kowalsky!

SHARIFF (CONT'D)

Is this great or what?!

TENSES AND-

MATT

(for Ryan's benefit)

And to think he went to Harvard.

MATT (CONT'D)

You gotta admit one thing. You can't

beat the view....

RYAN

Mm-hm.

MATT

"Mmm?" So what do you like about being

up here?

RYAN

The silence.

(BEAT)

I could get used to it.

COMPLICATED--

MATT

Hmmmm. Terrific.

RYAN

Houston, from first inspection comms

panel appears to be dead. Am I a go

to cut link to auxiliary?

MISSION CONTROL

You're the expert, doctor. It's your

call.

MATT

Houston, I have a bad feeling about

this mission.

MISSION CONTROL

Please elaborate.

MATT

It's the same feeling I had at Mardi

Gras in 1987...?

MISSION CONTROL

That is affirmative. Surprisingly,

control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras

story. Please proceed.

MATT

Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my

way down Bourbon Street looking for

the sister of a friend of mine. The

streets are swimming with people, I'm

thinking there's no way I'm finding

this girl...

RYAN

Proceeding to over ride.

MATT

Then all of a sudden I look up and --

there she is.

(MORE)

MATT (CONT'D)

I am about to yell out when I notice

she's holding hands with a short hairy

guy in board shorts and a

Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I

realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's

friend is holding hands with a--

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

ISS, this is Houston.

SPACE STATION CAP

(ON RADIO)

Zlotze Houston.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Explorer, this is Houston.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Go ahead Houston.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort.

Initiate emergency disconnect from

Hubble.

MISSION CONTROL (CONT'D)

(ON RADIO)

Begin re-entry procedure. Start

Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS,

initiate emergency evacuation.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Copy all Houston, and in work.

Matt, immediate return to Explorer.

Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.

MATT

Roger. Explorer, prep airlock!

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Airlock engaged--ready to receive.

MATT

Houston. Elaborate.

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)

Debris from the impact has caused a

chain reaction, hitting other

satellites in its path and creating

new debris. Norad reports that orbital

and ballistic effects are driving the

cloud of debris up toward your

altitude. How copy?

MATT

Copy all Houston.

(TO RYAN)

Put a bow on it Dr. Stone.

RYAN

I can't. If I turn it off now we'll

lose the whole system.

MATT

I'm not going to ask you again.

RYAN

ONE SECOND--

MATT

Not one second. Now! Shut it down!

THAT'S AN ORDER!!!

RYAN

Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Kowalsky, initiate emergency

disconnect from the Hubble.

MATT

Alright Shariff, let's do this.

SHARIFF

Roger.

MATT

Houston. Update.

MISSION CONTROL

We have a full on chain reaction. It's

been confirmed that it is the

unintentional side effect of the

Russians striking one of their own

satellites.

SHARIFF

They shot down their own satellite?

MATT

Right of disposal. Most likely a spy

sat gone bad. Now it's space junk.

MATT (CONT'D)

Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

Locks releasing in three... two...

one...

MISSION CONTROL

Explorer, new data coming through.

MATT

What's the blowback, Houston?

MISSION CONTROL

It's not good. Most of our systems are

going down. Debris chain reaction is

out of control and rapidly expanding.

Multiple sats are now down and they

keep on falling.

MATT

Define "multiple" sats.

MISSION CONTROL

Most of them. Telecomunications

systems are gone. Expect a

communication blackout at any moment.

RYAN

Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine

o'clock.

MATT

Half of North America just lost their

Facebook.

MISSION CONTROL

You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're

a go for TH1138 procedure.

EXPLORER CAP

Copy that Houston.

MATT

Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming

visual contact with debris. Debris is

from a BSE sat. To repeat--

SHARIFF

Heads up!

MATT

To repeat I have-

RYAN

Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster

transport.

MATT

We have to go. Go, go! Go!

MISSION CONTROL

Attention. New data suggests immediate

evacuation absolu...

RYAN

Dr. Stone requesting faster transport

to the bay area. Explorer get me down.

MATT

Explorer permission to retrieve Dr.

Stone.

EXPLORER CAP

(ON RADIO)

You are a go, Kowalsky.

We lost Houston!

MATT

Unstrap! You can't tune out the world

up here.

RYAN

I'm trying...

MATT

Try releasing the safety clip.

SHARIFF

Need some help there Matt?

MATT

No, don't wait for us. Get inside.

RYAN

It's stuck!

MATT

Man down! Man down!

MATT (CONT'D)

(TO RYAN)

Disengage!!!

MATT (CONT'D)

Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you

read? Explorer, over. Explorer--

MATT (CONT'D)

Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is

off structure!

MATT (CONT'D)

(ON RADIO)

Dr. Stone, detach!

RYAN

Nooooo!

MATT

(ON RADIO)

You must detach!

RYAN

No.

MATT

If you don't detach that arm is going

to carry you too far!

RYAN

(FROZEN)

I can't!

MATT

(a brief beat, then)

Listen to my voice. You need to focus.

I'm losing visual of you. In a few

seconds I won't be able to track you.

RYAN

(She pulls herself together)

Ok. Ok.

MATT

You need to detach. I can't see you

anymore.

RYAN

I'm trying. I'm trying.

MATT

Do it. Now!

RYAN

Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck,

Hold on.

MATT

Houston, I've lost visual of Dr.

Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of

Dr. Stone.

MATT (CONT'D)

Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do

you copy?

RYAN

Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached!

MATT

...Give me your position!

RYAN

I don't know. I don't know! I'm

spinning. I can't. I can't.

MATT

Report your position.

RYAN

GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I

can't.

MATT

Give me a visual.

RYAN

I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!

MATT

Do you have a visual of Explorer?

RYAN

NO--

MATT

Do you have a visual of ISS?

RYAN

NO--

MATT

I need you to focus. Give me a

visual... anything.

RYAN

It's too fast.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I can't breathe. I can't...breathe...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm

drifting but I have a visual of

Explorer.

RYAN (CONT'D)

With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle

is at the center of the dial.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I can see the Chinese station. No, no,

no, it's the International Space

Station.

RYAN (CONT'D)

ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Explorer, do you copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Houston, do you copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Houston, this is Mission Specialist

Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm

drifting.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Do you copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

... Stone. Do you copy?

RYAN

(almost to herself)

Lieutenant Kowalsky?...

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Repeat. Do you copy?

RYAN

YES! YES! I copy! I'm here!

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Flash your light.

RYAN

My light?

MATT

(ON RADIO)

So I can see you.

RYAN

Here! Here!

MATT

(ON RADIO)

There you are. Hang tight. Report

your status.

RYAN

I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Your status! Give me your readings?

RYAN

3.6 psi, I think.

MATT

Your O2. Give me your O2.

RYAN

Steady at eight percent...no seven...

MATT

(ON RADIO)

You're breathing too fast. You're

burning oxygen. We don't want to do

that. We want to relax. Copy.

RYAN

Copy.

MATT

Nearly there.

RYAN

Please hurry.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.

RYAN

Oh. Sorry.

MATT

Gotcha.

RYAN

Arghh!

MATT

Now, I'm going to tether you to me.

MATT (CONT'D)

I know. You never realized how

devastatingly good-looking I am.

MATT (CONT'D)

But I need you to stop staring and

help me with the tether. Okay?

RYAN

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it.

MATT

Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm

going to give you a little push, just

so you're clear of the jets--

RYAN

NO--

MATT

Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.

RYAN

No... No... No... Wait... Don't.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!!

MATT

See? Where you go, I go.

MATT (CONT'D)

Better. Let's get out of here.

RYAN

Ahh Dammit!

MATT

I know what you mean.

RYAN

Ahhh Dammit.

MATT

You're burning oxygen, we're going to

go back to the shuttle. How's that for

a plan. Copy?

RYAN

FUCK

MATT

Right copy that.

MATT (CONT"D) (CONT'D)

Houston in the blind, this is

Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making

our way to base, please prepare

Airlock for arrival. Copy?

MATT (CONT'D)

Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you

copy?

RYAN

Why aren't they answering?

MATT

It seems like communications are lost.

RYAN

Can they hear us on an alternate

frequency?

MATT

We don't know. That's why we keep

talking. If someone is listening they

might just save your life. Set your

watch for ninety minutes.

RYAN

Why ninety?

MATT

Houston clocked that debris at fifty

thousand miles per hour. Factoring in

our current orbit, I reckon we've got

90 minutes before we play duck and

cover again.

RYAN

02 down to six percent.

MATT

Okay. Pretty scary shit being

untethered up here, isn't it?

RYAN

Yeah. Pretty scary shit.

MATT

(after a beat)

You did all right.

MATT (CONT'D)

(to the Shuttle)

Houston, in the blind. This is

Kowalsky. Our current location is

approximately 900 meters out from the

Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like

to retrieve the body of Mission

Specialist Shariff and return it to

Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?

MATT (CONT'D)

Roger that.

RYAN

Where is he? Where is he?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

MATT

Grab him!

RYAN

I'm trying. I'm trying.

MATT

Quick. You're pulling me away.

RYAN

I got him. I got him.

MATT

Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I

can't gauge my thrust with you two yo-

yoing around.

MATT

(under his breath)

Jesus...

MATT (CONT'D)

(GRIMLY)

Here's hoping you've got one monster

insurance policy, Houston. Damages to

Explorer are... it's totaled. Will

commence search for survivors.

RYAN

02 down to five percent.

MATT

All right, here we go. Careful of the

edges.

MATT (CONT'D)

Houston, in the blind. To confirm.

Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and

myself, Mission Commander Matthew

Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of

STS-157.

RYAN

I apologize for not complying. I

should've stopped working as soon as

you instructed me to.

MATT

We were going to be hit no matter

what. There was nothing you could've

done to change that.

MATT (CONT'D)

Hey.

RYAN

Yes?

MATT

Alright... We have to get ourselves to

the Space Station. There.

MATT (CONT'D)

It's a bit of a hike, but it's our

only...

(CATCHING HIMSELF)

It's our best option. Agreed?

MATT (CONT'D)

Dr. Stone...

(as she turns)

Agreed?

RYAN

Agreed.

MATT

Alright. After you.

MATT (CONT'D)

Houston in the blind, this is

Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have

determined to proceed to ISS and use

one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS

if copy, please send rescue mission.

Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.

RYAN

02 down to two percent.

MATT

We're getting there.

MATT (CONT'D)

Beautiful, don't you think?

RYAN

What?

MATT

The sunrise. That's what I'm going to

miss the most.

MATT (CONT'D)

So, where's home, Dr. Stone?

DISTRACT HER-

MATT (CONT'D)

Ryan. Where's home?

RYAN

Home?

MATT

Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where

do you pitch your tent?

RYAN

Lake Zurich.

MATT

Where the hell is that?

RYAN

Illinois.

MATT

Illinois. Central time zone. That

makes it roughly... 8pm right now.

What are the good people of Lake

Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the

evening?

RYAN

I don't know...

MATT

What would you be doing?

MATT (CONT'D)

Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just

clocked out of the hospital after

putting in your customary 18-hour

shift. You're driving home...

RYAN

The radio. I listen to the radio...

MATT

There we go. Let me guess. NPR?

Classical. Top for--

RYAN

Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as

they don't talk. I just drive...

MATT

What do you miss down there?

MATT (CONT'D)

Is there a Mr. Stone?

RYAN

No...

MATT

Nobody special? Someone down there,

looking up, thinking of you?

RYAN

I had a daughter.

MATT

What was her name?

RYAN

Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing-

a school trip to the swimming pool.

She was playing tag- she slipped, hit

her head, and that was it... She loved

tag. I'm sure she was laughing.

RYAN (CONT'D)

When I received the call I was driving

and ever since that's what I do. I

wake up, I go to work and then I just

drive.

RYAN (CONT'D)

02 down to one percent.

MATT

Well, well, what d'you know. I have

good news and bad news.

RYAN

Uhuh?

MATT

The good news is we're five minutes

from the ISS and I know where

the Russians stash their vodka... and

that's a good thing cus I'm running

out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be

ten minutes short of......breaking

Anatoly's record.

RYAN

Mmm...Mmmm.

MATT

What?

RYAN

I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure

is low...

MATT

The tank may be empty but there's

still oxygen in your suit, so sip,

Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer.

Sip. We'll get you there.

MATT (CONT'D)

Let's go.

MATT (CONT'D)

Houston in the blind we have visual of

the ISS. Station must have been

evacuated because first Soyuz is

missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface

damage and chute has deployed. It's

use as escape pod for re-entry to

Earth is impossible.

RYAN

Shouldn't we be turning? We're

DRIFTING AGAIN--

MATT

Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We

want to drift. I wasn't kidding about

those fumes. This can has one or two

good thrusts left. If we're lucky....

MATT (CONT'D)

Steady...

MATT (CONT'D)

Ready... aim...

MATT (CONT'D)

...fire.

RYAN

Break... You have to break.

MATT

I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in

fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab

onto anything you can and hold tight!

AND-

RYAN

I got it. I got it.

RYAN (CONT'D)

The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm

I'm detached.

MATT

Grab a hold. Grab anything.

SEES-

MATT (CONT'D)

(AN EDGE)

Give me... give me five here, Ryan.

RYAN

I've got you. I've got you--

MATT

Shit... shit...

RYAN

No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you.

Don't. Don't. NO

AND-

RYAN (CONT'D)

Gotcha!

MATT

You have to let me go.

RYAN

What? No--

MATT

You have to.

RYAN

No!

MATT

Those ropes are too loose,

I'm pulling you with me. You have to

let me go or we both die--

RYAN

I'm not letting you go! We're fine.

HAPPENS:

MATT

Ryan!

RYAN

You're not going anywhere, you're not

GOING ANYWHERE--

MATT

It's not up to you.

RYAN

Please don't do this.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Please don't do this. Please don't do

this.

MATT

You're going to make it Ryan.

RYAN (O.S.)

No!

RYAN (CONT'D)

I had you! I had you.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?

RYAN

My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm

went off.

MATT

You need to board the station. Can you

see the airlock?

MAT

Do you copy?

(P.O.V shot - beginning to blur)

RYAN

Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Good. That's where you want to go.

You're losing focus, right?

RYAN

Yes.

MATT

That's because you're breathing CO2

and you're losing consciousness. You

need to board the Station.

MATT (CONT'D)

(ON RADIO)

Move!

RYAN

Ok.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is

too damaged for re-entry,

but it's perfectly fine for a little

Sunday drive.

RYAN

Sunday drive...?

MATT

(ON RADIO)

Look to the west... You see that dot

in the distance? That is the Chinese

Station. You're going to take the

Soyuz and cruise over there. The

Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.

RYAN

I've never flown a Shenzhou--

MATT

(ON RADIO)

That doesn't matter. Its re-entry

protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--

RYAN

Ok.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

You've never flown a Soyuz either.

RYAN

Only on a simulator.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

So then you know.

RYAN

I crashed it. I--

MATT

(ON RADIO)

It's a Simulator. That's what it's

designed for.

RYAN

Every time. I crashed the Simulator

every time.

MATT

(ON RADIO)

It's not rocket science. Just point

the damn thing at earth and

by this time tomorrow you'll be back

in Lake Zurich with one hell of a

story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You

copy?

RYAN

I'm going to take the Soyuz and come

get you.

MATT

No you're not. . I have too much of a

head start. That ship already sailed.

RYAN

No. I'm coming to get you.

MATT

Ryan, you're going to have to learn to

let go.

RYAN

But... I...

MATT

(ON RADIO)

I want to hear you say you're going to

make it.

MATT (CONT'D)

(ON RADIO)

Ryan! Say it!

RYAN

I'm... I'm going to make it.

MATT

Alright. Keep going

MATT (CONT'D)

What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?

RYAN

Dad wanted a boy.

MATT

Are you close to the airlock?

RYAN

Not yet.

MATT

Keep going.

MATT (CONT'D)

So, now that we have some distance

between us- you're attracted to me,

aren't you?

RYAN

What?

MATT

Well, people say I have beautiful blue

eyes.

RYAN

You... you have beautiful... you have

beautiful blue eyes.

MATT

I have brown eyes... that hurts.

MATT (CONT'D)

(ON RADIO)

You wanna know the good news?

RYAN

What?

MATT

(ON RADIO)

I'm going to break Anatoly's record,

and I think mine's going to stand for

a long, long time.

RYAN

No... I'm coming to get you.

MATT

You know, Ryan is a nice name for a

girl. Wow, you should see the sun on

the Ganges. It's amazing.

RYAN

(in a daze)

Matt...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Matt!

SILENCE

MATT-

RYAN (CONT'D)

the Station... Do you copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Come on Matt. Talk to me.

(NOTHING)

Tell me where you are.

(NOTHING)

Give me your position...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where are you? Give me a visual...

tell me what you see.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh, come on. You've been yammering

nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral,

and now you decide to shut up?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Come on Matt, talk to me!

RYAN (CONT'D)

Say something... Anything.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me

about the hairy guy. What happened?

RESIGNED-

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Houston in the blind.

RYAN (CONT'D)

This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

reporting from the ISS... All

communication with Mission Commander

Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio

transmission is absent. Visual is

nonexistent.

(A BEAT)

To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole

survivor of STS-157.

RYAN (CONT'D)

What now?

AND THEN-

UNITY NODE-

ZARYA MODULE-

DOCKING MODULE-

THE-

RYAN

OK... where was it?... where was it?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where is the power?... Here you are.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Good... good... just like training...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Undocking... undocking... Yes...

red...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ok... Ok... I remember this...

undocking...

RYAN (CONT'D)

We don't have four minutes to spare.

We're going manual...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay. Arming the system...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Firing the pyros...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Rezerv rasstyk!

RYAN

I engaged manual control- R O A K and

RYD are activated.

THE PERISCOPE-

THE PORTHOLE-

RYAN

Oh, no. No, no, no.

WHEN-

THE PORTHOLE-

THE PORTHOLE-

RYAN

Great. Fantastic. Perfect.

SILENCE

RYAN

Clear skies but with a chance of

satellite debris.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay. We detach this and we go home.

Piece of cake.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh shit.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Shit!

RYAN (CONT'D)

No... no... no..

RYAN (CONT'D)

I hate space.

RYAN

Shut up!

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ok.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Alright. That's good.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay, let's stabilise you.

THE PERISCOPE-

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station.

Houston in the blind, Tiangong is

approximately 100km... to the west and I

am off it's course by about 3 degrees.

I will correct trajectory.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ok.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five...

four... three

RYAN (CONT'D)

two... one...

RYAN

One...

RYAN (CONT'D)

One... one...

RYAN

Come on. Come on!

RYAN

You gotta be kidding me.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where's your backup?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where's your goddamn backup?!

RYAN (CONT'D)

FU--

RYAN

This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear

me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can

you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is

Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?

RYAN

Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you

hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan

Stone, can you hear me? Copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Houston. Houston! This is Mission

Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy!

RYAN (CONT'D)

(into the mouthpiece)

Houston, you're coming in over the AM

frequency. Please confirm identity.

TRANSMISSION

Han... ni... ts...

RYAN

Repeat. This is Mission Specialist

Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy?

TRANSMISSION

Hannik ya itc... pini.

RYAN

Is this the Chinese Station? Is this

Tiangong? Copy?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Do you speak English?

TRANSMISSION

Hannic ya itcitem pini!

RYAN

S.O.S. Do you understand?

TRANSMISSION

Uumaruq taigaa!

RYAN

Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday!

TRANSMISSION

Mayday!

RYAN

Yes! Mayday! Mayday!

TRANSMISSION

Mayday! Aningang!

RYAN

Aningang?

TRANSMISSION

Mayday, Aningang! Aningang, Mayday!

RYAN

(TO HERSELF)

Aningang...?

(then, realizing:)

Is that your name? Aningang is your

name?!

TRANSMISSION

Aningang! Mayday! Suli, suli!

RYAN

No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone,

Dr. Ryan Stone-- I need help.

TRANSMISSION

Mayday! Ieukpalliktuq uumaruq taigaa

naabuqtuq.

RYAN

(SOFTLY)

Dogs...

(INTO HEADSET)

Are those dogs? Those are dogs! Are

you calling from Earth?!

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun

out? Are there birds? Are there trees?

Can you smell the ocean?

TRANSMISSION

Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq.

RYAN

Is it beautiful where you are? Here

it's colder than hell and lonelier

than shit, but it's beautiful

Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly

beautiful.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Make your dogs bark again, Aningang.

Will you? Please...

TRANSMISSION

Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq...?

RYAN

Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof.

TRANSMISSION

Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu.

Auuu.

RYAN

Woof. Woof.

TRANSMISSION

Auuu... Auuu...

RYAN AND TRANSMISSION

Auuu. Auuu. Woof. Woof.

RYAN

I'm going to die, Aningang.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I mean, we're all going to die.

Everyone knows that. But I'm going to

die today...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Funny that. To know.

RYAN (CONT'D)

And you know what Aningang... I don't

care. I don't care if I die. I don't

have anything... not anymore.

RYAN (CONT'D)

But the thing is... I'm still scared.

I'm really scared...

RYAN (CONT'D)

No one will mourn me. No one will pray

for my soul. Will you mourn me,

Aningang? Is it too late to say a

prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I

have never prayed in my life... no one

ever taught me how...

RYAN (CONT'D)

No one ever taught me how...

RYAN (CONT'D)

A baby. There's a baby with you.

TRANSMISSION

Ieukpalliktuq upatimi...

RYAN

You are singing to your baby? Is that

a lullaby? That's so sweet!

RYAN (CONT'D)

I used to sing to my baby too.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I hope I see her soon.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(growing ever drowsier)

That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang,

just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll

sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me,

Aningang... sing...sing....

THE PORTHOLE-

RYAN (CONT'D)

No... no.. don't.

MATT

Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13

hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell

him he's been bumped.

MATT (CONT'D)

Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little

light?

RYAN

How did you?

MATT

Trust me, it's a hell of a story.

RYAN

But how did you?

MATT

That's better.

RYAN

How?

MATT

I found a little extra battery power.

I'm just happy you're still alive. To

be honest, I thought your chances were

slim to none. By the way, did you find

the vodka?

RYAN

You never told me where.

MATT

Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.

RYAN

No.

MATT

No? Right, let's get out of here.

MATT (CONT'D)

We're `bout a hundred miles to the

Chinese Station. A little Sunday

drive.

RYAN

We can't.

MATT

Course we can.

RYAN

There's no fuel. I tried everything.

MATT

Well, there's always something we can

do.

RYAN

I tried everything.

MATT

Did you try the soft landing jets?

RYAN

They're for landing so.

MATT

Well landing is launching it's the

same thing, didn't you learn about

that in training?

RYAN

I never got to land the simulator, I

told you.

MATT

But you know about it.

RYAN

And I crashed it every time.

MATT

Listen you want to go back or do you

want to stay here? I get it, it's nice

up here, you can just shut down all

the systems turn out all the lights,

and just close your eyes and tune out

everybody.

MATT (CONT'D)

There's nobody up here who can hurt

you, it's safe. Then what's the point

in going on, what's the point of

living?

MATT (CONT'D)

Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher

than that, but still it's a

matter of what you do now. If you

decide to go that you've gotta just

get on with it, sit back enjoy the

ride. You have to start living life,

Ryan.

RYAN

How did you get here?

MATT

Ryan, you have to learn to let go ...

Hey?

RYAN

What?

MATT

It's time to go home.

RYAN

Landing, landing. Landing is

launching.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay, landing, landing, landing is

green.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay, okay landing, alright.

A DIAGRAM-

RYAN (CONT'D)

Soft landing jets trigger

automatically at three meters before

landing. ... you're a clever son of a

bitch Matt. So to land I need to get

rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Listen to me Matt. You're going to see

a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah,

her hair is probably a mess. That's

okay, she doesn't like to brush it.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She

was so upset about that shoe Matt, but

tell her it was right under the bed.

RYAN (CONT'D)

You give her a big hug and a kiss for

me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell

her she's my little angel and that she

makes me so proud, so so so proud, and

that I promise I'll try and make her

proud too. You tell her that I'm not

quitting, that I'm going to keep

fighting. You tell her I love her

Matt... I love her so much.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Tri module separation, go...

RYAN

Okay Houston, here comes the tricky

part, the Soyuz has to think we're

only three meters above the earth.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Let's reset you then.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay. I only have one shot at this.

One shot...

RYAN(CONT'D)

What's the point if we don't try?

THE PERISCOPE-

RYAN

Wow... you were right Matt... it's

magnificent....

THE PERISCOPE-

RYAN (CONT'D)

You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You

keep dropping and you're going to kiss

the atmosphere. But not before I get

to you. You have my last ride home.

THE PORTHOLE-

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay, I'm done with just driving.

Let's get go home.

OUTSIDE-

IS-

TRIGGERS A-

SPRAY-

RYAN GIVES-

ANOTHER SPRAY-

SEE THAT-

ANOTHER SPRAY-

THE STATION-

THE STATION-

RYAN SEES-

RYAN

Come on. Come on.

Ah, ok ah undocking,

RYAN

Ok. That doesn't sound good....

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay....okay...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Good...good...There. And this should

be...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay... Houston in the blind...

RYAN (CONT'D)

This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about

to undock from the Tiangong and I have

a bad feeling about this mission.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Reminds me of a story, Houston--

RYAN (CONT'D)

Okay, you know what, Houston? Never

mind the story...

RYAN (CONT'D)

It's getting hotter in here.

RYAN (CONT'D)

The way I figure it, there's only two

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES--

RYAN (CONT'D)

I either make it down in one piece and

I'll have one hell of a story to

tell...

RYAN (CONT'D)

...Or I burn up in the next ten

minutes.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Whichever way it goes, no harm no

foul.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Because either way--

RYAN (CONT'D)

It'll be one hell of a ride.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I'm ready.

RYAN

Yeehaaa!

SHE STRETCHES

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ahhhhhhhh!

THE PORTHOLE-

LOOKS AT-

ITS SURFACE-

UNDERWATER

POD AS-

Ahhhhh!!!
