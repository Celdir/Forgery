TICKER

Written by

Paul B. Margolis

Original Draft: 11/10/97

Hot summer night. The flesh district - hookers working the

sidewalks, stopping cars.

MIKE REILLY, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for

action ... wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers,

heat-seeking weary eyes. He flashes a wad of bills in an

effort to get some attention... no one notices.

Across the street, BILL RICE, 50's, a ragged transient,

strolls over.

RICE

Know what the problem is, kid?   You're too

ugly to get propositioned.

REILLY

Look who's talking, old man.

RICE

C'mon, it's a quiet night.

Rice starts away.   Reilly pauses, then trudges after him.

Rice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk

with their mouths full as they walk.

RICE

Next week we work the park.

REILLY

I gotta get back on top.   Get off the sleaze

detail.

RICE

You will, one day at a time.   I'll be old and

grey when it happens...

11/10/97   2.

BAG LADY

A small gift, sir, for the Queen ...

BAG LADY (cont.)

I keep a record, see? They don't

pay, I don't forget.

RICE

Here you go, your Highness.

BAG LADY

Thank you, officer.

REILLY

So what'll you do? After they give you the

gold watch.

RICE

Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't

work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing

pole, or something useful.

REILLY

You don't fish.

RICE

How hard can it be? The grand kids been

buggin' me about taking them camping.

11/10/97     3.

REILLY

You outta the city... that's a fish out of

water. What's with all this family talk

lately, anyway?

RICE

One of these days you're gonna get tired of

fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll

wish you had family.

REILLY

No thanks.   I got close but it never woulda

worked.

They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the

alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel.

Cluttered with debris - clothes, boxes, personal items.

Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and sputters,

finally turns over.

RICE

Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of

its misery?

REILLY

What are you talking about, it's purring like

a kitty.

RICE

I thought you said what's-her-name's brother

was going to fix it.

REILLY

She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.

RICE

What was it this time?

REILLY

She wanted to cook me breakfast.

11/10/97    4.

The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly

deserted building's garage.

Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights

come on in the building. They don't.

Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the

building briefly, then disappear. They hear a brief heated

argument, that is cut short abruptly. Then silence.

REILLY (cont.)

C'mon, let's check it out.

RICE

We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers

in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd

best call it in for some back-up.

REILLY

Nah, let's just take a look-see.

Reilly jumps out and heads for the building.   Rice rolls his

eyes, follows.

A huge, old, battered machine shop. Spooky darkness, dead

quiet. Moonlight filters in through dirt-smeared windows.

The door CREAKS as Reilly and Rice slip in, stop, eyes scan.

Nothing.   Just rows of glistening machines.

Rice gestures for Reilly to spread out. They head in,

footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them.

Still nothing...deeper, deeper... then, glancing over, Reilly

sees a shape hiding behind a machine. He steps towards it.

The shape whirls - a beautiful spitfire of a GIRL with

piercing blue eyes.

She tries to bolt. Reilly grabs her. She struggles, pulls a

knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat.

11/10/97   5.

REILLY

Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch.

RICE

You okay?

REILLY

Yeah, just a nick ...

RICE

Freeze!   Police!

11/10/97   6.

REILLY

(to gunmen)

Drop it!

SWAN

Let her go.

SWAN (cont.)

No, the girl!

EARRING

(to Swan)

We gotta get outta here!

REILLY

(to Swan)

Tell them to drop it - now!

11/10/97   7.

SWAN

You have no idea how sorry you're going to be.

(to The Girl)

Don't worry.

RICE

Mike...

REILLY

Don't talk.

RICE

Take your time... one day at a time, kid...

RICE (cont.)

It's all I got... it's yours.

REILLY

It don't work-

RICE

(grinning)

Ain't that a shit--

11/10/97    8.

Looking numb, out of place, Rice's blood still on his

trenchcoat, Reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of

ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked.

Cops look up, whisper about him.

Turning a corner, Reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop,

HARRY, hustling The Girl out of a booking room. She's got a

shiner where Reilly hit her.

The Girl and Reilly make eye contact, intimate somehow, a

flash of vulnerability and fear in The Girl's face...

HARRY

Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking

for you.

Reilly snaps out of it, continues on.    Reilly nods as Harry

hustles the girl away.

Behind his desk, a work-weary captain, WINTERS, 50s, sucks

coffee as he grills ARTIE PLUCHINSKY, 40s, a slick suit-and-

tie homicide detective.

WINTERS

Prints?

PLUCHINSKY

Nothing so far.

WINTERS

What about the ballistics report?

PLUCHINSKY

Lab's backed up, we're still waiting

for it.

Reilly walks in.

11/10/97   9.

REILLY

Captain...

WINTERS

Reilly, what the hell happened out there?   Why

didn't you call for back-up?

REILLY

(at a loss, sad)

Sir, I--

WINTERS (contid)

(softening)

Dammit, Rice was a good man,

REILLY

I want to work this.

PLUCHINSKY

You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't

have the experience and you're too personally

involved.

REILLY

But sir--

WINTERS

You know the rules. You're off the street

`til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go

home and clean yourself up, get some rest...

HARRY

She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D.,

nothing...

11/10/97       10.

PLUCHINSKY

What's that?

HARRY

Bracelet she was wearing.

REILLY

Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to

blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.

PLUCHINSKY

Maybe she knows your old man.

Reilly sears into Pluchinsky.

WINTERS

Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-

REILLY

I'll do it.

Winters eyes him for a beat, relents...

WINTERS

Okay, kid.    Run this down to the Cave.

Reilly spins and exits quickly.

Emerging from a dingy back staircase, Reilly enters a hallway

and moves to a door a door marked "BOMB SQUAD."

Reilly enters into another world - a dungeon cluttered with

bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping-

pong table, Sheryl Crow pin-up, Chicago Bears posters, Yassir

Arafat dartboard, a photo-shrine to dead Bomb Squaders.

A plain, fresh-faced assistant, BEV, 30s, looks up from her

computer station.

11/10/97       11.

BEV

May I help you?

REILLY

I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.

BEV

They're not here.

REILLY

Where are they?

BEV

And you are...?

REILLY

Officer Reilly, vice.

BEV

There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-

REILLY

-Where?

BEV

2600 block of Lakefront.   A limousine.   But, I-

REILLY

Thanks.

Reilly sprints out.   Bev tries to finish but he's gone.

The Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic.

A young, uniformed police OFFICER stops Reilly in front of a

cordoned-off section of the street.

11/10/97   12.

REILLY

(flashes badge)

Bomb Squad.

POOCH

Smell anything, Schnoz?    Me, neither.

POOCH (contid) (cont.)

Schnoz, come here, boy.

T.J.

Shhh, I hear something....

GLASS

Who the heck're you?

11/10/97   13.

REILLY

You the Bomb Squad?

T.J.

No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.

GLASS

We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you

a statement in a few minutes if we're still

alive.

REILLY

(flashes badge)

Reilly, Vice. I-

T.J.

Quiet!

T.J. (cont.)

Ticker.

POOCH

Schnoz says it's loaded.    Good boy,

Schnozzie.

GLASS

Alright boys, look close.   Let's assess.

11/10/97        14.

Reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works

together - Glass in charge - a psychic connection between

them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.

POOCH

Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?

Glass puts on magnifying spectacles -- precise, organized, a

detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for

wires, sensors.

As the others watch, Glass rubs his fingertips

ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box.

He reaches in...   Grabs something...   Slowly pulls it out ...

It's a Mickey Mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit

firecrackers taped between Mickey's legs.

The Bomb Squaders whoop and howl - all except Pooch who pulls

out a pack of Tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.

GLASS

It's a "girl" !

They all crack up, hysterical.   Reilly stares in disbelief --

these guys are nuts!

In the b.g., the Officers finish getting a statement from the

Businessman as the still-worried Chauffeur inspects the limo.

T.J. and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass

fills out paperwork.

T.J.

That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to

play a trick like that.

11/10/97   15.

POOCH

No shit.   I better send Meg flowers just in

case.

REILLY

Who's in charge here?

POOCH

He is!

REILLY

Look, it's important.

T.J.

Make an appointment.

REILLY

It's about this.

GLASS

Where did you get this?

REILLY

Off a girl's wrist.    A suspect...

T.J.

P.E.T.N ...

REILLY

What?

GLASS

High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's

got strange taste in jewelry or she's into

serious demolition.

11/10/97   16.

REILLY

What do you mean?

POOCH

Fire in the hole!

GLASS

Sorry about that.

(to Reilly)

That's an inch of the stuff, imagine

what the whole thing'd do.

REILLY

Thanks.

GLASS

Hey wait a minute-

T.J.

Vice... Jesus.

POOCH

That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his

hands on.

11/10/97       17.

Thin crowd of day-time drinkers. Earring walks in, moves to

a booth where Swan and Beard are eating. Earring pulls out a

Gallois (French) cigarette, lights up from a book of matches.

EARRING

They're holding her downtown.

SWAN

What about the cop?

Earring shrugs.

BEARD

If you'd let me waste him.

EARRING

What if she talks?

SWAN

She won't.

BEARD

I say we split town. Come back to this job

when things cool. We've got other contracts -

Denver, Seattle...

Swan slams his fist down, spilling food.     No one in bar even

looks up from their drink.

SWAN

I want her back and we do the job.

BEARD

I thought we agreed, the personal can't

interfere with the professional.

EARRING

Besides, we're on a schedule and the cops

won't let her go.

11/10/97        18.

SWAN

Unless we make them.

EARRING

Hey...

Earring stares uneasily. Swan and Beard look up, freeze.     A

pair of PATROL COPS are heading directly towards them.

Earring reaches under his jacket...   Swan grabs Earring's

arm, calming him.

The Cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left

and slide into a booth.

Swan nods, they get up and casually slip outside.

Reilly hurries in, interrupts Winters and Pluchinsky talking

over Pluchinsky's desk.

REILLY

Captain-

An OFFICER shouts from across the room, holding up a phone.

OFFICER

Captain, line one!

WINTERS

(to Reilly)

I thought I told you--

OFFICER

He says it's important, something

about the Rice shooting.

Winters snatches up the nearest phone.

WINTERS

Winters.

11/10/97   19.

WINTERS (cont.)

What...?

SWAN'S VOICE

I said release the girl or alot of

people are going to die.

SWAN'S VOICE (contid) (cont.)

It's exactly two o'clock. If she's not

released in one hour, people die.

WINTERS

Wait, what do you mean--?

WINTERS (cont.)

Shit!

PLUCHINSKY

What the hell was that?

REILLY

A ticking bomb...

WINTERS

What?

REILLY

(holds up bracelet)

It's detonation cord, for a bomb.

11/10/97     20.

PLUCHINSKY

It's a bluff. The guy's full of

crap.

WINTERS

We can't take the chance. Ring down to the

Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.

REILLY

I'll do it.

WINTERS

Goddamit, Reilly--

REILLY

Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.

WINTERS

I know you're anxious to get back but... just

stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you

classifying fingerprints, understand?

REILLY

Yes, sir.

Reilly takes off, Pluchinsky glares.

T.J. is hunched over a twisted mess of wires, untangling

them.   Pooch taste-tests dog biscuits for Schnoz, then feeds

them to him, as he talks to his wife on the phone.

Glass is dissecting the Mickey Mouse clock.

POOCH

No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're

welcome. You deserve flowers more often.

Bev glances longingly at T.J. as she gives Glass a neck rub.

GLASS

Bev, you're the greatest...

11/10/97   21.

T.J.

Hey, I'm next.

BEV

Hey, that's the guy-

REILLY

We just got a bomb threat upstairs.

REILLY (cont.)

A cop was killed last night interrupting a

robbery. One of the gang was grabbed, a girl.

The one I told you about with the detonation

cord. Well, her friends just called in,

they're threatening to waste people unless

she's released in the next hour.

GLASS

Alright, let's check it out.

REILLY

We can start in the area where the robbery

occurred.

T.J.

Vice cop on a homicide?

REILLY

Captain assigned me to assist you.

POOCH

Assist?   What the hell you know about tickers

anyway?

GLASS

Easy, guys.

(to Reilly)

(MORE)

11/10/97   22.

GLASS (cont.)

Look, nothing personal, but you can't just

waltz in here and expect to join the team.

REILLY

What're you talking about?

GLASS

When you need us, you love us, when you don't,

we're shunned by the rest of the department.

REILLY

We've got one hour.     Are you coming

or not?

REILLY (cont.)

Okay, fuck you.

T.J.

Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so

pent up.

POOCH

(to Glass)

What do you think?

GLASS

Call upstairs, see what you can find out.

POOCH

Right.

GLASS

(re: bracelet)

T.J., run a trace on this, see if

you can pin down where it came from. Whoever

these people are, let's hope they're all talk.

11/10/97       23.

Reilly's Studebaker is parked next to the machine shop

building.

Reilly enters and slowly re-walks his steps from the shoot-

out, pausing over the chalk outline of Rice's body.

Two FORENSICS OFFICERS silently comb over the crime scene.

Reilly pauses, sadness overwhelming him. One of the Officers

nods at him, he has to turn away as the emotions come.

Sophisticated detonation equipment and weapons cover the

beds. Beard scowls, Earring sweats as Swan puts the

finishing touches on a computerized briefcase bomb.

SWAN

What time is it?

EARRING

Twenty after.

BEARD

Swan, it's no use. Look, we can

still make Houston--

SWAN

Shut up!

He sets a timer, closes the briefcase, smiles.

Sleazy area. Briefcase in hand, Earring slips out and blends

into pedestrian traffic.

11/10/97        24.

Earring walks on, just a man with a briefcase.

Earring slows and passes a bus stop where a group of giggly

TEENAGE GIRLS are waiting.

He notices a raven-haired KNOCKOUT going into the pub up

ahead. He grins and follows her in.

A trendy Irish Pub, a sparse lunch crowd. Earring enters,

spots the Knockout ordering a drink at the bar, slides onto a

stool next to her, and deposits the briefcase on the floor.

EARRING

Hey, beautiful, can I buy you some bangers and

mash? Pint of Guiness?

She gives him a once-over, turns up her nose, nods a `thanks'

to the Bartender delivering her white wine. Earring's smile

doesn't change.

EARRING (cont.)

Last chance. You know, even the smallest

choices in life could change everything.

KNOCKOUT

Fuck off, pal.

Earring grins and shrugs an `oh well'. He slides off the

stool, steps back, and exits... leaving the briefcase behind.

EXT.   BAR - DAY

Earring walks out and strolls off. He checks his watch,

picks up the pace. He disappears around a corner.

Cars pass.   People stroll by.   Nothing happens.

11/10/97    25.

An ordinary scene on an ordinary day.     The silence is

screaming.

Suddenly - the bar EXPLODES. A FIREBALL BURSTS OUT the front

window, showering the street with wood and BROKEN GLASS.

Chaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red

lights. Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up,

Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the

charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances.

A black-and-white tears up. Capt. Winters leaps out, pushes

through to a dirt-covered FIRE CHIEF.

FIRE CHIEF

Eight dead, so far.

Winters looks grim.

Reilly SCREECHES up in his Studebaker, jumps out, pushes

through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone.

He stops as he sees a bloody FEMALE VICTIM being loaded into

an ambulance. Suddenly a voice snaps him out of it.

PLUCHINSKY

What're you doing here?

Reilly faces him.

PLUCHINSKY (cont.)

You're offsides. Beat it.

Reilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins.    Pluchinsky

shoves him back.

PLUCHINSKY (cont.)

I said get the fuck outta here.

11/10/97   26.

REILLY

You touch me again and--

PLUCHINSKY

And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake

me for one of your partners, I'd like to make

retirement in one piece.

WINTERS

What the hell's going on?

PLUCHINSKY

Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...   This fuck-up is

interfering with-

WINTERS

Reilly, what're you doing here?

REILLY

Sir...

WINTERS

I thought I told you--

GLASS (O.C.)

He's with us.

GLASS (cont.)

We asked him to come.

11/10/97   27.

T.J.

Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on

this thing.

GLASS

Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us

catch these guys that much sooner.

(to Reilly)

Coming?

WINTERS

Go ahead, kid.

PLUCHINSKY

I'm filing charges against that mother-

WINTERS

Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up

your nose.

REILLY

What was-?   Why...?

GLASS

That cop who bought it... you didn't

tell us he was your partner.

T.J.

We've lost brothers too, we know

what that's like.

11/10/97      28.

GLASS

Let's get something straight. We're doing you

a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want

around explosives.

REILLY

What?

GLASS

This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery.

You wanna work with us, you do it our way,

understand?

REILLY

Now wait just a fucking-

GLASS

Be cool around my men, they don't trust

strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's

unattractive.

Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad

van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage.

Smoky hell. Two Firemen drag out a fire hose. Glass, T.J.

and Reilly approach a taped-off area where Pooch is on his

hands and knees, wet and dirty as he searchs for clues.

Schnoz sits nearby, red ball in his mouth.

GLASS

By the way, I'm Glass.   This is T.J., and

Pooch.

REILLY

Mike Reilly.

T.J.

(offering dirty hand)

Uh-huh...

Reilly avoids the hand.

11/10/97   29.

POOCH

That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb

sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie.

T.J.

Flame racer, partial P.C.L. See this wave

pattern? Definitely self-contained.

POOCH

Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable

oil ...

REILLY

What kind of bomb was it?

T.J.

Device.

REILLY

Huh?

GLASS

We don't use the b-word.      Bad luck.

REILLY

So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse

"devices"?

GLASS

Treat.    We treat devices.

REILLY

(amused)

Anything else I should know?

GLASS

Don't push it, slick.

11/10/97   30.

T.J.

Pooch, can you move it?

POOCH

I don't know...

T.J.

Yes, baby, yes ...

POOCH

Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.

T.J.

Scorch marks... looks like they used

silly putty.

GLASS

C4, plastic explosive.

T.J.

Helluva fuck factor.

T.J. (cont.)

Don't worry, you'll pick it

up.

11/10/97    31.

POOCH

Hey, check this out?

Something glitters in the ashes. Pooch picks it up with

tweezers. A tiny chip. The guys stare at it, puzzled.

GLASS

Lemme see that.

Glass takes it, puts on his magnifying spectacles, holds it

up to the light, frowns.

GLASS (cont.)

Hardware.

T.J.

Computer device?

GLASS

Unlikely. Probably, cash register or

something.

Pooch and T.J. go back to searching.

GLASS (cont.)

What can you tell us about the girl with the

exploding jewelry?

Glass turns to see Reilly on his way out.

REILLY

I'll get back to you.

Phones are ringing off the hook. Reilly bursts in, notices

Winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated

tracing equipment.

WINTERS

Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he

calls again.

11/10/97   32.

PLUCHINSKY

You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said

to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm

watching you.

REILLY

I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my

type.

OFFICER

Captain, it's him!

WINTERS

Winters here.

SWAN'S VOICE

Don't make me send another.

WINTERS

Look, we're prepared to talk, what

do you want--?

WINTERS (cont.)

Hello?   Hello?

WINTERS (cont.)

Section commanders, in my office, now.

11/10/97      33.

As the room erupts, Reilly turns to the BOOKING OFFICER.

REILLY

Where's the girl? The one I brought in.

BOOKING OFFICER

Upstairs, interrogation.

Reilly takes off.

Wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder, a BORED COP

flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one-way

mirror. Through it can be seen a bare interrogation room

where The Girl sits stubbornly at a table across from Harry.

Stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray, Harry rubs the

back of his neck, gets up and goes through a door, into the

viewing booth. The Bored Cop looks up, shuts off the tape

recorder.

BORED COP

Three hours. She's tough.

HARRY

Tough? Tough is "Fuck you, where's

my lawyer?". This chick doesn't

say boo.

The outer door opens, Reilly walks in.

REILLY

Any luck?

HARRY

Bupkiss.    Sorry about Rice.

Reilly nods, accepts the condolence.

REILLY

Captain said I could give it a crack.

11/10/97      34.

HARRY

She ain't no hooker.   This is a murder

investigation.

REILLY

She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky.

But, if you got a problem with that, talk to

the Captain.

HARRY

I'll be in the can.

Harry exits. The Bored Cop eyes Reilly suspiciously as

Reilly crosses to the other door, yanks it open.

As Reilly enters, The Girl stiffens at the sight of him.

REILLY

You remember me.

Reilly shuts the door, she doesn't respond. The Girl catches

a glimpse of his 9mm under his trenchcoat, she's unfazed. He

paces, circling her.

REILLY (cont.)

You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten

year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean

off.

The Girl puts up a good front but we can see she's listening.

REILLY (cont.)

You're scared. You're just caught in the

middle. But, we've got a guy out there

wasting people just to get you back. Why? It

can't be because of your looks. So, I'll be

honest with you -

Reilly goes to the table, flicks off the mic.

11/10/97       35.

The Bored Cop doesn't notice, he's engrossed in his comic.

Reilly sits, the Girl eyes him like a trapped prey. They're

enemies, yet there's a strange chemistry between them.

REILLY

Let me be very clear about this. The police

won't let you go. When your boyfriend

realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of

innocent people are going to die. Kids,

families. I know you don't want that to

happen.

She stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all.

A flicker of fear, indecision. Her lips part, fighting it,

then she looks away, letting the fear win. Reilly flushes

with anger, frustration.

Glass squints through a microscope. Pooch sniffs and fumbles

dirt samples. T.J. rocks to a Walkman as he inspects the

charred briefcase handle fragment. Bev is at her computer

searching luggage websites on the Net.

Reilly comes in, still frustrated.

POOCH

We missed you, where'd you go?

Before Reilly can answer, T.J. rips off his headphones.

T.J.

Fuckin A, I think I got two partial

prints here!

POOCH

Awright!   How bout you, Glass, how's that chip

shaking?

11/10/97   36.

T.J.

Glass, what is it?

GLASS

I was wrong... this didn't come from

any cash register.

POOCH

Whadaya mean?

GLASS

It's from an IRA.

POOCH

Oh shit...

REILLY

A what?

T.J.

IRA - instant retirement account.

GLASS

I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in

existence. Computerized, multiple sensors,

booby traps, the works. First showed up in a

series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple

years ago. One of their boys tripped it on

himself and they went back to a less

complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?

REILLY

She's not talking. But, she could be. So,

obviously, you've seen one of these devices

before?

GLASS

Only once, at Redstone.

REILLY

Where...?

11/10/97   37.

T.J.

That's one more time than any of

the rest of us have seen it.

POOCH

Shit.   We're fucked.

GLASS

Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker,

it's not personal.

T.J.

Let's face it, we all knew it would happen

sooner or later. The guy who can build a

mousetrap that's better than we are ...

BEV

Stop it...

T.J.

(points to Reilly)

And what's he doing to help?

POOCH

Shut up, T.J.!

BEV

Be nice Pooch!

REILLY

All of you, shut the fuck up!

REILLY (cont.)

No wonder the rest of the department doesn't

want to work with you. You're nothing but a

bunch of... punks.

11/10/97    38.

Reilly walks out.

Reilly goes to his Studebaker, climbs in.

As he starts it up, the passenger door rips open.        Glass

jumps in, slams the door, furious.

GLASS

Nice performance back there. Where'd you

learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?

REILLY

Hey, look--

GLASS

No you look, mister! First, you don't go

calling my men names. It's bad for morale.

Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of

alot more about police work than any vice cop

ever did.

REILLY

Oh yeah?     Prove it.

GLASS

(beat)

Drive.

Glass glares, a challenge.         Glaring back, Reilly guns the

engine, screeches away.

The Studebaker rumbles up to the machine shop, parks in the

same haunting spot as the night before.

Glass and Reilly climb out of the car, flashlights in hand.

Reilly glances around, bad memories stirring up.

11/10/97     39.

REILLY

The place has already be combed. Forensics

pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.

GLASS

Then let's go see what they missed.

Pulling out a tool kit, Glass quickly picks the door lock,

yanks open the door, ducks inside. Reilly follows.

Nearly pitch dark inside, shafts of late afternoon sunlight

glistens on the battered machines. Shadows wash over Reilly

and Glass as they retrace the path Reilly and Rice took the

night before, Glass searching intensely, Reilly getting more

and more uncomfortable.

GLASS

So what were they doing here?

REILLY

I don't know. You tell me?

GLASS

An abandoned machine shop... nice place to

build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and

Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

REILLY

You mentioned something called Redstone.

GLASS

Redstone's the army training center in Alabama

where they send the cream of the crop to learn

about tickers.

REILLY

Cream of the crop, huh?   You?

11/10/97   40.

GLASS

(nods)

Top of my class at West Point, thank you very

much. Then off to Redstone. First half of

the course we learned how to build devices...

second half, we'd take them apart. Everything

from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.

REILLY

Sounds like terrorist heaven.

GLASS

There were a few guys in my class with names

like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up

ahead in the hall, call their name, but they

wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing,

they'd always disappear after the first half

of the course.

REILLY

Just how easy is it to build a... device?

GLASS

With a little training, you could go into a

house and just from stuff in the bathroom and

kitchen make something that'd finish off that

alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever

watch MacGyver?

GLASS (cont.)

So this is where it happened.

REILLY

Girl was here. The guy in charge was over

there with one of his men, the other one was

back there.

11/10/97   41.

REILLY (cont.)

Bombers, what kettle of fish are

they?

GLASS

Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies

that're afraid to confront their victims.

They like scaring people. That's why they

call in their threats. Same mentality as

obscene phone callers.

REILLY

Except they'll blow you up if you

don't play along.

GLASS

No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of

baloney. They're into the power trip, not the

damage. What scares me is that this guy is so

sophisticated he could blow up whatever he

wants, then disappear. The worst of the

bunch, they love the challenge of creating the

wildest device ever... and they love the

carnage.

GLASS (cont.)

Hello.

GLASS (cont.)

French. Doubt somebody who worked

here smoked it. Only half gone, put it out in

a hurry.

(glances around)

(MORE)

11/10/97       42.

GLASS (cont.)

Figuring the length, assuming it was one of

these guys, odds are... it was lit outside.

Glass takes off.   Reilly follows.

Glass and Reilly search the area.    Glass moves on his knees,

aiming the flashlight.

GLASS

This is where the van was parked.

REILLY

Yep.

GLASS

Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...

REILLY

Look, it's a longshot...

GLASS

Bingo!

Glass pinches something with his tweezers, holds it up

triumphantly... a used match.

CLOSE UP - MATCH UNDER MICROSCOPE

A jungle of giant fibers teeming with strange molecules.

T.J. (O.C.)

No question, it was definitely the one used to

l-light the butt. Finger pressure suggests a

male, average build, height... no prints,

trace of nylon fiber... he wore a glove.

T.J. punches keys on a computer, peers through the microscope

as Glass, Reilly, Pooch and Bev stand by.

11/10/97   43.

T.J.

This is strange.

T.J. (cont.)

(reading info)

Three foreign particles ... vulcanized

rubber ... resin ... nitro-cellulose.

REILLY

Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some

kind of explosive?

GLASS

Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of

these things could lead in several directions,

but together ...

POOCH

Ka-Boooom.

BEV

They make bowling balls out of vulcanized

rubber ...

POOCH

Resin...

T.J.

Lane oil...

GLASS

(beat, proud of his team)

A bowling alley.

11/10/97     44.

T.J.

Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.

REILLY

(amazed)

You mean you just--? ... You keep a record

of... matches?

GLASS

Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line

of work.

POOCH

(smirks at Reilly)

"Punks", huh?

GLASS

Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling

alleys they supply in this area.

BEV

Right!

GLASS

Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at

Langley and on the other side of the pond,

see if any IRAs been popping up lately?

POOCH

You got it.

GLASS

(to Reilly)

We work fast enough for you?

Reilly mouth is opened, duly impressed.

The Studebaker and Harley swerve up to a run-down, windowless

bowling alley, park in a red zone.

Reilly and T.J, climb out of the clunker, Glass off his bike.

11/10/97      45.

T.J. checks his hair in the side mirror, sniffs his

underarms.

REILLY

T.J., what're you doing?

T.J.

My first undercover assignment.

I gotta look good, right?

Reilly and Glass exchange a grin, they drag T.J. inside.

A busy Saturday afternoon crowd. Rock music blasts,

reverberating with the echo of crashing balls and pins. The

lanes are teeming with sweating bodies. Sexy waitresses in

skimpy outfits deliver drinks.

T.J. ogles women as they wander through.

T.J.

So what're we looking for?

REILLY

Someone who smokes French cigarettes.

T.J.

In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros,

Camels, and maybe a few Kools.

Reilly and Glass nod, knowing it's a longshot.

Reilly directs Glass and T.J. to split up to case the place.

They move through the rowdy crowd, eyes catching every

smoker.

The music is more redneck-rock, the crowd as well.

11/10/97   46.

GLASS

How long are we going to stay?

REILLY

`Til we get a better lead.

POOCH

Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston,

New York, Philadelphia... but no real match

REILLY

Insurance?

GLASS

Political.

POOCH

Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the

targets can actually be linked to government,

political or special interest concerns. They

seem to be just unrelated industrial

companies.   Some insured, some not.

(MORE)

11/10/97   47.

POOCH (cont.)

But there's traces of C4 and assorted

inflammatory additives found in each case.

The only common denominator is the detonators

all had circuitry consistent with our micro-

chip.

GLASS

Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?

REILLY

What not bad. You've got a series of bombs,

devices, that may or may not be connected, set

by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be

linked.

GLASS

Right.

REILLY

Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.

POOCH

I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's

gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy

who would know if any of the rightwingers are

circulating over here. Bev's following up on

the briefcase manufacturers, too.

T.J.

Pooch, you're up.    Rack `em.

T.J. (cont.)

Boss, you're buying the next round.

POOCH

How're you guys doing?

11/10/97   48.

REILLY

Still waiting for a miracle.   Go ahead.

REILLY (cont.)

Quite a team you've got, where'd you find

them?

GLASS

It's a small fraternity, everyone knows

everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex-

D.O.D., military expert... claymores,

grenades. He played linebacker at Boston

College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to

the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers,

we try to keep him away from the tickers.

T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M

engineering degree. Found him in a Militia

chat room - turns out we were both monitoring

the same groups. Bev is the natural born

hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had

the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in

two months. Captain has no idea how much

hardware she's "found" for us.

REILLY

You guys seem pretty tight.

GLASS

We've gotta be. In this business, you don't

exactly make alot of outside commitments.

REILLY

Why do you do it?

GLASS

I don't know, it's strange... it's not the

best career path, but when you get the bug,

there's nothing you can do about it.   See,

when you beat one of these things...

(MORE)

11/10/97   49.

GLASS (cont.)

there's that one second when you realize you

saw something you weren't supposed to see...

this beautiful naked woman... Death... and

then the rush comes, the high, cuz you realize

you got away with it.

T.J.

Lesbians.

REILLY

Looks like Pooch's doing okay.

T.J.

He's married, he don't even know what a

lesbian is.

REILLY

There he goes. He was here the whole time.

11/10/97       50.

Reilly pushes his way through the crowd with Glass on his

heels. T.J. rushes over and grabs Pooch away from the Girls

at the pool table.

Reilly runs into a pair of enormous Rednecks, spilling their

beer on them.

The Rednecks grab him by the collar and prepare to fight as

Pooch arrives and body-blocks the Rednecks away from Reilly.

Reilly is released and he continues after Earring as Pooch

and the Rednecks mix it up.

A brawl breaks out with Pooch and T.J. in the middle as

Reilly and Glass make it to the exit door. Reilly flies out-

but Glass FREEZES dead in his tracks. He spins back to look

at the corner booth.

THE SHOPPING BAG sits on the floor under the table.

Glass tenses.

The fight escalates quickly, but Pooch employs his linebacker

skills and cuts down his assailant... and T.J. a natural

streetfighting-rabbit-puncher. They quickly dispatch the

Rednecks, leaving them bruised and bloodied... they rush for

Glass and the doorway--then lock on Glass' reaction and stop.

Reilly runs out into the middle of the street.

At the end of the block, Earring is rushing for the corner.

Reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian--and fires.

Earring is blown off his feet...

He hits the pavement hard...

11/10/97       51.

Reilly enters and sees Glass, TJ and Pooch gathered around

the booth in back.

REILLY

Say, thanks for the back up--

The bomb squad ignores Reilly, who now realizes something is

wrong. He pushes his way through the bar patrons to the

booth.

Glass glances up at Reilly.

GLASS

He set one, the son-of-a...

TJ and Pooch exchange looks--they've never heard Glass so

close to swearing before.

T.J. notices a small crowd starting to gather around the

booth.

T.J.

(calmly)

Clear the area, please.

Nobody moves.

REILLY

(loudly)

You heard him, get the fuck away,

it's a bomb!

That does it, the crowds shriek and scatter.

Rolling eyes at each other, the Bomb Squaders turn their

attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor.

GLASS

Alright.   Let's assess.

The team eyes the package for a moment...

11/10/97   52.

TJ

IRA.

POOCH

Oh shit...

T.J.

Fuck factor ten.

GLASS

Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe.

GLASS (cont.)

Altimeter... choking coil... mercury switch...

GLASS (cont.)

Triple V.O.M... brilliant... this guy's a

master...

11/10/97   53.

GLASS (cont.)

It's one of these wires.

REILLY

So cut both.

GLASS

One shuts it down, one turns arms it.

REILLY

Which one's which?

GLASS

I don't know. There's an old saying, when in

doubt, cut the yellow wire.

GLASS (cont.)

You can go back to the van if you like.

REILLY

No, I'm with you.

11/10/97       54.

The counter stops on 4 - no explosion.

Pooch and T.J. whoop and hug like drunk madmen.   Glass steps

away, stone-faced. Reilly follows him, wobbly.

REILLY (cont.)

You okay?

GLASS

(smiles)

Is this a great job or what?

Two squad cars have appeared, Officers cordon off the crime

scene.

Glass watches Reilly kneeling over Earring's body digging

through Earring's pockets, finding nothing but cash,

cigarettes and matches.

REILLY

(at Glass)

Nothing. Nothing traceable.

INT BAR

Pooch and T.J. have the device on the ground a few feet away

from the Earring's body. They delicately continue to take it

apart so it can be transported safely. Schnoz sits nearby,

watching. Pooch is on the phone with his wife...

POOCH

I don't know, honey. I'll see. No,

everything's fine, it was nothing.

As he says this, he lifts a chunk of C4 and sets it aside.

Pooch hangs up his phone.

EXT STREET

Pooch and TJ exit the bar, moving to Glass and Reilly.

11/10/97     55.

POOCH (cont.)

You guys hungry? The wife's got a heap of

lasagna leftover.

T.J.

(at Reilly)

What do ay say?

GLASS

Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly.      C'mon.

Glass notes Reilly's hands.

GLASS (cont.)

Good meal would go a long way to steady your

system.

REILLY

Got work to do, don't we?

Pooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the

device's shopping bag, hands it to Reilly, offering a smile.

POOCH

In case you change your mind.

Reilly looks at it awkwardly, then walks away as a News van

arrives on the scene...

Reilly cruises into the bowels of downtown.    Makes a few

turns and parks.

In the shadows of a burned out building, Reilly observes

several JUNKIES getting a fix from their CONNECTION.

Reilly watches with scared, tempted eyes.

He looks at his hands... they're trembling... catches his

reflection in the rear view mirror. Checks Rice's watches on

his wrist, taps it. Still not ticking. Ashamed, he

screeches away.

11/10/97     56.

A quiet Squad Room. Reilly bangs out something on a computer

terminal. He blazes away, typing as fast as he can. He

holds out his hands. Almost steady. He takes a drink from a

Protein Shake, returns to typing.

A weary Winters looks up from coffee and paperwork as Reilly

knocks, walks in. Reilly drops a sheaf of papers on his

desk.

WINTERS

What's this?

REILLY

Report on the case so far.

WINTERS

You know after a shooting I would normally

take your badge and weapon, but Glass called

in already and confirmed it was clean.

REILLY

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

But from now on, any leads on this case go to

Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you

are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad...

you and your new friends are not to be playing

detective any more. Got it?

Reilly nods, accepting.

WINTERS (cont.)

I imagine as soon as they find out one of

their's is dead, we'll be getting another

call. So get some sleep, alright.

Reilly nods, turns and exits.

11/10/97    57.

TIGHT on a TV - a pretty Reporter reports live from the

scene...

REPORTER

To recap, a gunman carrying what police

described as a phony bomb was shot and killed

less than an hour ago.

THE ROOM

Swan watches the TV report with Beard, eyes narrowing as he

sees Reilly in the crowd behind the Reporter.

REPORTER (cont.)

While the man's motives and identity remain a

mystery, police are denying the incident is

related to the explosion that ripped through a

bar earlier today, killing 15 and wounding

more than 30...

Swan kicks in the TV, destroying it.

BEARD

She talked.

Swan flips open a suitcase full of bomb-making materials and

begins to sort through...

Quiet, cozy, middle class. The Harley and the Bomb Squad van

are parked out front. Also the Studebaker.

Reilly exits the bathroom, returns to the dining room where

the Bomb Squad is laughing, hoeing and haying over dessert.

Pooch's faithful wife, MEG, pours coffee. TOMMY and JANIE,

Pooch's kids, sit on Pooch's and T.J.'s knees, in their

pajamas.

11/10/97   58.

MEG

More coffee, T.J.?

T.J.

No thanks, Meg. Hawed Pooch ever get so

lucky?

MEG

Mr. Reilly?

REILLY

Mike.   No thanks, I'm fine.

POOCH

Time for bed, kiddos.   Say goodnight.

TOMMY

Can Uncle Teej tuck us in?

T.J.

C'mon, champ, I'll even give you

a piggyback.

JANIE

(to Glass, Reilly)

Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle Mike.

REILLY

`Night...

GLASS

How long were you hooked?

REILLY

What?

11/10/97   59.

GLASS

You don't have to talk about it.

REILLY

Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no

back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.

GLASS

Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess,

if only for a second.

REILLY

I know. I was working a drug ring, deep

cover. Played the part too well. When they

pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My

fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I

was out here on the street, doped up,

auditioning for the morgue when this tough old

vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a

second chance. He promised Captain Winters

he'd look out for me.

GLASS

Your partner?

REILLY

(nods sadly)

I guess I didn't realize how much I needed

him. He kept me straight. It's been tough

every second since.

REILLY (cont.)

This was his. Doesn't work for shit, but it's

keeping me straight.

GLASS

Let me see.

11/10/97       60.

Reilly gives him the watch. Glass pulls out a mini tool kit,

pries off the back of the watch examines the works.

GLASS (cont.)

Main spring's stuck. All you have to do is

free the palate and realign the balance wheel.

Here, you try.

REILLY

I terrible with mechanical things.

GLASS

No you're not, you just don't understand them.

Here, do what I tell you.

He holds out the mini-kit. Reilly takes it uncertainly, but

follows Glass' instructions.

GLASS (cont.)

Okay, first push the pin back with this.

Good. Now while you keep it there, stick this

in here and turn it slowly. Easy, that's it.

Now let the pin go and line up the wheel.

That should do it.

Reilly gives it a tweak, looks at the watch, surprised.

REILLY

It's working.

GLASS

Congratulations, you just built your

first ticker.

Reilly throws Glass a surprised look.

Sunrise breaking. Reilly and Glass have their heads under

the hood of the Studebaker, covered in grease, tools

everywhere. T.J. sits behind the wheel. Pooch and Schnoz

stumble out of the house to watch.

11/10/97        61.

REILLY

Okay, hit it.

T.J. guns the engine, the Studebaker purrs like a tiger.

GLASS

Alright!

T.J.

We've created a monster.

Glass glances at Pooch.

GLASS

Any word?

POOCH

Nothing.    Maybe they gave up, split town.

REILLY

Don't bet on it.

Bustling activity...

Reilly enters to find Glass, Bev, T.J. and Pooch busy at work

at each of their work stations. Glass moves over to watch

Bev's computer screen.

REILLY

How's the print coming?

BEV

One partial from the handle matches the

suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor.

Long record of arson, assault, the works. The

other print - we got nothing from our data

base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for

Interpol.

11/10/97        62.

REILLY

Damn.

Bev enters another command... the computer goes to work as

she turns to Reilly.

BEV

Coffee, Mike?

REILLY

No thanks, Bev.

She smiles warmly. He smiles back, T.J. eyes them, slightly

jealous of the moment.

A phone rings.   Bev answers it...

BEV

Yes, sir.   He's here.   I'll tell him.

Bev hangs up the phone.

BEV (cont.)

Mike, Captain wants to see you

right away.

Reilly heads for the door.

A strange, uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as

Reilly weaves past cops smoking, drinking coffee, waiting.

They all stare at him. Especially Pluchinsky.

Reilly walks in. Winters gestures for him to take a seat as

he talks on the phone.

WINTERS

Yes ... no, of course not but ... yes,

sir, I understand.

11/10/97   63.

WINTERS (cont.)

I got a call from upstairs. They say you

questioned the girl.

REILLY

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

She's refused to say a word to anyone. What

made you think you could get her to talk?

REILLY

I didn't.     But I had to try.

WINTER

Reilly, I think I've shown that I'm a patient

man. Rice was your biggest fan and I've tried

to honor him by giving you some slack. But

you are very close to running out of slack.

REILLY

Yes, sir.

WINTERS

I read your report. Impressive. I'd say it's

got detective written all over it. But... you

cross the line one more time... you're gone.

Are we clear?

WINTERS (cont.)

Now, that out of the way. The girl wants to

talk to you, alone.

WINTERS (cont.)

So get going, let's close this thing.

11/10/97    64.

REILLY

Yes, sir.

Reilly bolts off.

Reilly enters to find Harry and the Girl waiting for him.

Harry looks the Girl over, nods at Reilly.

HARRY

I'll be outside.

Reilly nods, Harry exits.     Reilly sits down at the table

opposite her.

THE GIRL

Hello.

REILLY

Hello.

THE GIRL (MARY)

My name is Mary Jordan. We were hired to take

out some industrial sites. Insurance.

REILLY

But they weren't all insured.

MARY

Cover.

(slowly, ashamed)

It was suppose to be abandoned buildings,

y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The

night you busted us...We were checking to make

sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare

them away.

REILLY

Who is he?

11/10/97        65.

MARY

Alex Swan. My brother.

The other two are called Taylor and

Leveau.

REILLY

Taylor's dead.

She seems relieved.

REILLY (cont.)

Where are they, Mary?

Mary takes a deep breath, eyes welling.

MARY

There is a motel downtown, near the Machine

Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.

REILLY

Thank you.

MARY

He's my brother...

Reilly rises and moves to her.   Their eyes linger a moment, a

bond between them.

REILLY

Then why tell me?

MARY

People are dying.

Reilly nods and touches her shoulder, a light squeeze.   He

turns and exits.

An army of cops and squad cars out front, Pluchinsky silently

directs a SWAT team to the door. Reilly and the Bomb Squad

watch from a distance as they break down the door.

11/10/97   66.

GLASS

Ex-girlfriend?

REILLY

Be right back.

REILLY (cont.)

Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were

staying at the hotel over there - one has a

beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't

happen to have seen them, would you?

BAG LADY

No.

REILLY

No, of course not... well, thanks

anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.

11/10/97    67.

BAG LADY

On second thought, maybe I did.

He turns back. The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an

entry with her finger.

BAG LADY

Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this

morning. Very disrespectful. He used to

drive a van, but he got a new car. You want

the license number?

She tears off the page, holds it out.

REILLY

You're beautiful!

Reilly gives her a big kiss, races back to the Bomb Squad

who've been watching.

REILLY

We're back in business!

They all look at him like he's nuts.

Buzzing with action.   Harry and Pluchinsky attack Winters

with printouts.

HARRY

Ran the license plate - car was rented early

this morning from a Hertz office downtown.

PLUCHINSKY

Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at

Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the

middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no

criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is

French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in

half a dozen countries.

11/10/97      68.

WINTERS

Get out an APB, now!

Harry moves off to the DISPATCHER as a fax machine comes to

life on the desk next to PLUCHINSKY. A fax spews out...

"WINTERS.   LET HER GO NOW... OR A BOMB'S COMING CLOSE TO

HOME."

WINTERS (cont.)

Jesus. Pluchinsky, get four squad cars out to

my house, get my family out of there, tell my

wife I'm on my way.

PLUCHINSKY

Yes, sir.

Cops race to their cars. An armada of black-and-whites

scream out of the parking lot. Winters appears and jumps

into his Ford Sedan and tears out.

DISPATCHER (V.0)

... suspects driving a dark green

Ford Grenada, license number one

Two Eight Michael Vincent Edward ...

Squad cars roar up and down the streets.

Two cars are parked out in front of one house in particular.

In the squad room, Pluchinsky and some men wait anxiously by

phones, computer-consoles, radio switchboard.

11/10/97     69.

Reilly idles in his Studebaker. T.J. and Pooch come out of

the parking lot in the Bomb Squad Van, Glass motors along

side Reilly. He guns the bike and takes the lead, followed

by Reilly, then the van.

They pull out into traffic and head towards the suburbs.

Beard drives, Swan rides shotgun.   A briefcase lies on the

seat between them.

As he makes a left, Beard notices the Bomb Squad Van coming

the other direction.

BEARD

We've got company.

Swan whirls, pulls a gun as Glass and Reilly pass them.

Reilly double-takes...

Reilly grabs his radio mic, yells into it...

REILLY

Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front

of you, you got `em, you got `em.

Reilly SKIDS to a dead stop. Glass, up ahead tries to

maneuver around slowing cars as...

The Grenada speeds down a street right in front of the Bomb

Squad Van.

Pooch cranks into a turn and gives chase. Reilly and Glass

are pinned in by other cars. They both finally squeeze out

of their jams in different directions...

11/10/97        70.

An excited T.J. jumps on the radio.

T.J.

Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad. Suspects

sighted on Fern Street, two blocks from HQ.

In pursuit.

DISPATCHER (O.C.)

Roger that.   All available units...

Beard speeds around another corner, the lumbering Van has

difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the Grenada for a

moment.

The Grenada speeds up, heading towards the Police Station up

ahead.

The Bomb Squad Van appears and speeds up.

ON THE SIDEWALK

Swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as...

ON THE STREET

Beard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station -

on collision course. At the last second, Beard dives from the

moving car, hits the pavements and rolls.

The Grenada CRASHES into the Squad Car... but no explosion.

The Bomb Squad Van SKIDS to a stop as two uniformed Officers

rush out of the Station.

Beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down

the street.

11/10/97   71.

T.J.

Police, freeze!

11/10/97      72.

POOCH

Oh... damn.

KA-BOOOOOM!!!

The Grenada explodes in a massive FIRE-BALL, throwing nearby

Glass off his feet. Everyone else drops back to the ground,

covering their heads.

DOWN THE STREET - AT THE PHONE BOOTH

Swan grins and walks away down an alley.

We can hear the CRY of Schnoz, WAILING from the front seat of

Van.

Reilly stares off into space. Surreal silence, like a

dream... Reilly looks at his watch, keeps his eyes low as he

steals a glance at Glass in the other chair, face wracked

with pain, loss.

They both look through the glass office at the squad room

outside, the sounds of reality fade in... phones ringing,

voices shouting... a tense, chaotic emergency atmosphere.

Reilly and Glass rise as Winters walks in, closes the door.

He sits behind his desk, lights a cigarette.

WINTERS

Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man.

We don't have time to give you a break right

now, we're going ahead and-

REILLY

My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?

WINTERS

(ignoring Reilly)

Glass, you're to stand by with your team.

11/10/97     73.

REILLY

I promised her she'd be safe.

WINTERS

It's our only option.

REILLY

It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...

WINTERS

Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell

were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad

Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-

REILLY

I know.

WINTERS

You've been at the center of two suspect

fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities.

I'll need your badge and your weapon.

Reilly looks at Glass, there'll be no stepping in this time.

He glares at Winters, reaches into his jacket, pulls out the

badge and tosses it on Winter's desk. He pulls out his 9mm,

pops out the clip and open the chamber, sets it down.

Reilly and Glass trudge out, both profoundly disturbed as

they head across the squad room. Glass veers off.

REILLY

Glass--!

Reilly stares, eyes wet, watching him disappear.

Glancing over, he notices Bev and T.J. sitting with Meg down

the hall, Tommy and Janie asleep in her lap. Schnoz walks up

to Meg, whimpering.   Bev wraps her arm around her. T.J.

puts his hand on Bev's shoulder.

11/10/97      74.

Pluchinsky brushes roughly past Reilly, snapping him out of

it. He turns, walks dejectedly out.

DISSOLVE TO:

An armored van screeches up. Doors fly open. Metro SWAT

Team jumps out with equipment, helmets, rush into the

building.

Thundering silence. Winters and his men wait by phones.

Their watches tick. So does the clock on the wall. Nothing.

SWAT Team Captain BENSON, huddles with his men.

A phone rings, shattering the quiet.   Harry answers it, holds

it up urgently.

HARRY

It's him!

Winters takes it. A new high-tech TRACER flicks on a new

piece of equipment.

WINTERS

Winters here.

Swan's voice comes over the squawk box, growling low.

SWAN'S VOICE

You motherfuckers, you don't learn,

do you?!

WINTERS

We're prepared to talk-

SWAN'S VOICE

Shut up!    Shut up!

The Tracer homes in on the signal.

11/10/97    75.

TRACER

15...

SWAN'S VOICE

You have exactly thirty minutes to release the

girl where you found her.

TRACER

Twelve ...

SWAN'S VOICE

Thirty minutes.

TRACER

Nine ...

WINTERS

How do we know you'll keep your word?

Click, dial tone.

Winters flashes a look at the Tracer.   The Tracer yanks off

his headphones in utter frustration.

WINTERS

(to his men)

Okay, let's move!

The room erupts into action. Benson and the SWAT Team are

the first ones out the door...

Hauntingly familiar. An unmarked police car pulls up and

stops behind the machine shop.

Harry sits behind the wheel.    Mary sits in the back,

handcuffed to Pluchinsky.

Pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs.   Mary's eyes flare

11/10/97        76.

PLUCHINSKY

Get out and go to the machine shop -

Mary steps out of the car. She glances around--then heads in

the opposite direction of the Machine Shop. Pluchinsky

curses. He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better

clear the area. He peals out.

Undercover Men in various disguises track her from cars, and

on foot, communicating by hidden mics. A WINO eyes her

carefully, lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers...

WINO

She's out of the bag.

Mary exits the alley onto the street, searching where to go.

She turns down the street and moves fast, eyes darting about.

The SWAT van is tucked into an alley...

INSIDE THE SWAT VAN

Winters, Benson and Team monitor the radio communication.

WINO (O.C.)

(on the radio)

Position Four. Turning on Elm.

Mary crosses the street, a Camero nearly clips her. She

makes it safely to the sidewalk and passes a TRUCK DRIVER

eating a hot dog. After she moves off...

TRUCK DRIVER

(speaks into sleave)

Six.   She's crossing to Main.

11/10/97      77.

Mary looks around quickly, blends into a crowd coming out of

a store and ducks inside.

TRUCK DRIVER (cont.)

She just went into a department store.    She's

out of sight.

Winters grabs the mic...

WINTERS

Seal the building!

(to Benson)

Let's move.

The SWAT van RUMBLES to life.

Mary bolts through the store, ducks through a service door.

Mary bursts out, runs like a spooked horse.

As she dashes to the mouth of the the alley, she runs smack

into the Camaro that almost hit her. It SCREECHES to a stop.

The passenger door flies open.

Mary leans down and looks in, flushes. It's Swan.    He

reaches over and yanks her inside, TEARS away.

The Truck Driver runs into the other end of the alley.

He starts to give chase as Swan tosses a small package out of

the car. The Truck Driver dives for cover as...

KA-BOOOOM!!!   A dumpster EXPLODES.   The Truck Driver jumps to

his feet...

11/10/97        78.

TRUCK DRIVER

(into sleave)

We have contact. Black Camaro-

The Van SPEEDS up as we hear...

TRUCK DRIVER (O.C.)

-license number HQW-256.

From every direction, unmarked cars, squad units and the SWAT

Van converge on the area.

Swan drives with deadly confidence, glances at Mary tenderly.

SWAN

You okay?

MARY

Alex-

SWAN

I know.   I warned them.

He swerves left, then right, pulling a transmitter out of his

pocket.

MARY

What is that?

SWAN

Security.

He sets a dial to 10, pushes a button.

The transmitter counts down... 9, 8, 7...

11/10/97     79.

The Camaro tears down a one-way alley going the wrong way.

INTERCUT WITH TRANSMITTER COUNTDOWN - 6, 5, 4...

Undercover vehicles race after the Camero, seconds behind.

5, 4, 3 ...

They swerve into the alley.

Then just as Swan whooshes out, a charge EXPLODES a stack of

55 gallon drums. They fall down into the path of the

pursuers who crash into the FLAMING DRUMS.

The lead car EXPLODES...

Mary looks back in horror as she's whisked away.

Dark, filthy, last stop to nowhere.

Drunk, dejected, looking like shit, Reilly waits for a fix

with a couple other JUNKIES. The TV in the bar drones in the

background.

The Dealer appears and gestures to Reilly.

DEALER

C'mon, cowboy, you're next.

Reilly trudges over.

DEALER

Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White,

Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl...

11/10/97      80.

Reilly looks up sharply as he hears the TV, visible through

the doorway.

REPORTER ON TV

We're coming to you live near the scene of

that latest, explosion that ripped through a

downtown alley less than half an hour ago.

Something clears behind Reilly' eyes.

DEALER

(impatient)

Hey, asshole ...

REPORTER ON TV

Despite growing fears and talk of a coverup,

police have sealed off the area and are

refusing to comment about fatalities, or the

rumor that terrorists may be involved.

Reilly's eyes shift, mind racing.

DEALER

Hey, I'm talking to you--

Suddenly himself again, Reilly bolts up, sending the Dealer

and his equipment scattering, and streaks off. He bursts out

of the front door of the bar into the glare of sunlight... we

can hear SIRENS not too far off.

Driving like a maniac as usual, Reilly grabs the radio mike

with one hand, pulls his back-up .357 out of the glove-box.

He listens out the window for the SIRENS, he looks up at the

sound of approaching HELICOPTERS.

In the service bay, a MECHANIC raises the black Camaro on a

hydraulic lift, out of sight from the street.

11/10/97    81.

Out front, Swan pays an ATTENDANT, climbs into an orange U-

Haul truck with Mary, drives off.

A beat, a squad car and an unmarked speed past the Gas

Station.

Swan brushes Mary's hair from her face.

SWAN

You hungry?     We could get something to eat.

Mary shakes her head, scared.

SWAN

What's the matter?

MARY

Nothing... just tired.

She forces a smile. Swan frowns suspiciously as he turns

down a service road, pulls into...

Swan pulls up to the loading dock of the warehouse.

INSIDE THE TRUCK CAB

MARY

Why are we stopping here?

SWAN

We're moving' on. I have to pick up the

supplies. Just two little boxes.

Mary turns white.

MARY

No...   No more killing.

SWAN

Stay here.

11/10/97   82.

MARY

Alex, please.

SWAN

Stay in the truck.

OPERATOR (O.C.)

Operator.

MARY

Get me the police!

OPERATOR (O.C.)

Is this an emergency?

MARY

Yes! Please, hurry!

SERGEANT'S VOICE

Police, Sergeant Doyle speaking.

MARY

Please, I need help, my name is--

SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE

Whoa, slow down, lady. Now what's

that again?

11/10/97   83.

SWAN

Who are you calling, sis?

MARY

What?    Nobody, I-

MARY

Alex, please-

SWAN

Shut up!

(into phone)

Who is this?

SERGEANT DOYLE'S VOICE

Sergeant Doyle, Metro P.D. Look, what's going

on--?

MARY

Help!

BOY

Hey--?

11/10/97     84.

Caught in traffic, map spread out in his lap, Reilly slams on

his horn.

REILLY

C'mon, move it.

His police radio crackles.

DISPATCHER VOICE

All units, 211 reported at 8th and Sycamore.

Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an

automatic weapon, last seen heading east with

female hostage in a U-Haul truck ...

Reilly perks up, checks his map.

Jamming the wheel, he crashes out of traffic, ripping the

bumper off the car in front of him, and rockets away.

He grabs his mic, thinks, disguises his voice.

REILLY

Dispatch, this is Reilly.

DISPATCHER VOICE

Go ahead.

REILLY

Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.

DISPATCHER VOICE

Aren't you on suspension?

REILLY

Just do it.

DISPATCHER VOICE

Hang on.

Reilly runs a red.

11/10/97    85.

T.J.'S VOICE

T.J. here.

REILLY

T.J., it's Reilly, put Glass on!

T.J. is in the passenger seat, Bev sits in the back with

Schnoz, Glass drives. Glass takes the mic.

GLASS

What's up?

INTERCUT WITH REILLY

REILLY

Where you guys at?

GLASS

Driving in circles, waiting for-

REILLY

Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.

GLASS

How do you know?

REILLY

Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.

GLASS

Should we head for the Interstate?

REILLY

Would you?

GLASS

No, I'd slip out past the hotel district,

behind Greyhound...

REILLY

Me, too.

11/10/97    86.

Reilly hangs up, fishtails around a corner, map blowing out

the window.

Patrol cars, unmarked and the SWAT Van criss-cross the

streets in confusion...

T.J. speeds by in the Bomb Squad van.

Reilly swerves onto 8th Street, eyes searching desperately.

Rounding the rear of a huge glass luxury hotel, Reilly

catches a glimpse of orange disappear around a corner.

Reilly bangs a hard right to go around the block.

REILLY

(into mic)

Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand

Hotel. Cut him off.

GLASS (0.C.)

(on radio)

You got it.

The Bomb Squad accelerates...

Reilly changes channels on the radio...

REILLY

(into mic)

All units, suspect spotted heading down alley

behind Grand Hotel.

(MORE)

11/10/97        87.

REILLY (cont.)

(beat)

We need back-up, now.

Winters is shocked at the sound of Reilly's voice.

WINTERS

(into mic)

Reilly, what the hell are you-?

REILLY (O.C.)

(on radio)

Fire me later. Close in and we got the

bastard.

WINTERS

Pull back.   You're only an observer.

Reilly throws down his mic, aims at the alley ahead and

speeds up, then cranks into the alley, SCREECHES to a stop.

The U-Haul barrels down the alley. Swan sees Reilly up ahead

get out of his car and aim his .357

Swan SLAMS on the brakes. Throws the vehicle into reverse.

Checks his mirror to see the Bomb Squad Van appear at the end

of the alley. He's completely pinned in.

Glass and T.J. jump out, they are in bullet-proof vest,

aiming shotguns, using the van as a shield. Bev jumps out

with Schnoz and slips behind the van entirely.

AT THE STUDEBAKER

Reilly's radio CRACKLES...

WINTERS (O.C.)

Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly!

Do not engage. We're five minutes-

11/10/97   88.

REILLY

(into mic)

We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!

T.J.

Jesus...

GLASS

Reilly!    He's loaded!

REILLY

(yelling)

Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!

SWAN

I want out, right now.      Or the whole city

block is gone.

11/10/97   89.

GLASS

Reilly, he's got enough to do it.

GLASS (cont.)

Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch.

He releases it, we're done for.

SWAN

Drop it.

MARY

(to Reilly)

Take him!

11/10/97   90.

GLASS

Hold on to that thing tight.

GLASS (cont.)

Jesus Fucking H. Christ...

REILLY

Fuck factor?

GLASS

Off the scale.

REILLY

What do we do?

GLASS

Can you hold it?

REILLY

Talk to me.     Let's assess.

GLASS

Right.

11/10/97   91.

REILLY

C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!

GLASS

He has a timer going as back-up, in case we

got a hold of the remote.

(beat)

Okay... first, run your fingers along

the edges, feel for a sensor.

GLASS

Good, now the other side.

REILLY

Nothing.

GLASS

Okay, let's go in.

GLASS (cont.)

Not enough time ... gotta go for the

blasting cap. Only one chance... hand

entry.

REILLY

Keep talking.

GLASS

Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.   Tell

me everything you feel.

11/10/97   92.

REILLY

Wires... metal, cold... something soft...

GLASS

Don't touch that.

REILLY

More metal... sharp edge...

GLASS

Stay to your left.

T.J.

Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're

chilling a device.

11/10/97   93.

REILLY

Something round, two wires ...

GLASS

That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now

grab it by the base and pull it straight up.

No, Wait...

REILLY

What's wrong?

GLASS

Too easy. There's gotta be something else in

there, another cap maybe.

REILLY

Make up your mind, trigger.

GLASS

Ease your thumb over to the right - feel

anything?

REILLY

Yeah, another round thing.

GLASS

Okay, one of the caps turns it on,

the other shuts it down.

REILLY

Which one's which?

GLASS

I don't know.

REILLY

What... ?

11/10/97   94.

GLASS

When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

REILLY

How the hell do you feel yellow?

GLASS

No excuses, just do it!

GLASS (cont.)

Not bad, for a rookie.

REILLY

Thanks.

11/10/97      95.

Glass looks up to see T.J. and Bev peeking from around their

van.

GLASS

All clear, but we need an ambulance!

Bev jumps into the van to make the call as T.J. starts

limping towards the U-Haul. Schnoz yelps and drops from the

van and runs for the U-Haul.

Reilly cradles Mary in his lap as Glass kneels and removes

the remote - the red light stops flashing, then turns off.

T.J. arrives and looks down at Reilly and Mary, then at the

device in the U-Haul.

T.J.

Nice work.

DISSOLVE TO:

The room is back to its usual bustling activity.

Winters is going through reports on his desk as Reilly

enters. Reilly is cleaned up, shaven, haircut, new suit... a

new man.

Winters look up, impressed with the change.

WINTERS

Mayor loves a hero.

Winters hands Reilly an envelope and a new badge.

WINTERS (cont.)

Just want you wanted. Your promotion, and

transfer.

11/10/97      96.

REILLY

Thank you, Captain.

Winters nods and goes back to his paperwork.

T.J. and Bev work closely together on a mock-device. T.J. is

teaching her the job. They smile warmly at each other.

Glass is on the computer.

Reilly enters.

BEV

Hey, you look great.

T.J. flinches, but she winks at him to calm him down.    T.J.

smiles... no longer threatened.

Glass doesn't look up from his computer.

GLASS

You're late.

Glass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb

Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen.

Reilly smiles and he sits next to Glass, hands him the

transfer papers envelope.

GLASS (cont.)

(softening)

Welcome to the family.

Glass accepts the papers and shakes Reilly's hand.

REILLY

Nice to be here.

T.J.

That feeling won't last long.

11/10/97   97.

FADE OUT.
