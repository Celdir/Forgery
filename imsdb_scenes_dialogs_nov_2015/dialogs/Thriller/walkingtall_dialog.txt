SHERIFF WATKINS

How ya doin'?

CHRIS

Ok. When'd the mill close?

SHERIFF WATKINS

Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin

for work you might wanna try Aberdeen,

that's the closest mill work you're

gonna find around here.

CHRIS

That's too bad.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Nah just simple economics. Y'know we

have a really nice casino here, the

wild cherry. You wanna make some money

maybe you wanna go on down there and

try your luck at the blackjack tables.

CHRIS

Nah I don't think so. Thanks.

SHERIFF WATKINS

You're Chris Vaughn?

SHERIFF WATKINS

Well hell, I know all about you Chris.

I know your folks, I'm sheriff Stan

Watkins.

CHRIS

How ya doin.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Ralston get outta the car, you're lookin

at a real soldier here pay some respect.

RALSTON

Welcome home soldier.

CHRIS

Thanks.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Here Chris, (opens the back door) We'll

give ya a ride up to your folks.

CHRIS

Nah I'm fine thank you.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I insist.

CHRIS

I'll walk.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Hey it's my pleasure.

CHRIS

It's ok.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I won't take no for an answer (jokingly

reaches for his gun). HEY! Get in the

car.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Did I scare ya with that one?

CHRIS

Lil bit.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Ya. Let's go.

SHERIFF WATKINS

You were gone a while huh?

CHRIS

8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months

back he fell asleep at the wheel and

uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man

and a good sheriff.

CHRIS

Thanks for the ride.

SHERIFF WATKINS

No problem, and uh Chris (hands him

a piece of paper). It's election month...

I'm your man.

MICHELLE

Can I help you?

MICHELLE

Lil' brother.. You come over here and

gimme a hug.

MICHELLE

You look great.

CHRIS

What is this?

MICHELLE

Hey, I couldn't let you be the only

one looking good in uniform. Hey ma!

Chris is here!

CHRIS

What's with the tent? (points to a tent

set up on the lawn).

MICHELLE

Oh, that's for Pete.

CONNIE

Look at you!

CHRIS

How ya doin!

CONNIE

How long do we have ya for?

CHRIS

For good. I'm home.

CONNIE

Really? You're not kiddin.

CHRIS

No.

CHRIS

Hey dad.

DAD

Welcome back.

CONNIE

I wish you would have told me you were

coming I would've cooked.

CHRIS

This is great.

MICHELLE

So what are you gonna do now that you're

home?

CHRIS

Well I was planning on working at the

mill, your letters never mentioned that

it was closed.

CONNIE

We didn't wanna bother you with our

problems when your father got laid off.

DAD

I got my business, you saw the furniture

outside.

CONNIE

I substitute at the elementary school,

Michelle pitches in. We try to keep

things simple.

MICHELLE

Pete! This is your Uncle Chris.

CHRIS

Hey Pete.

MICHELLE

Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw

you you were barely walking.

PETE

And now I'm camping.

MICHELLE

I said you could sleep on the couch.

It was Chris' room first.

CHRIS

Your tent's gonna take on water. I could

show ya how to rig it.

PETE

Doesn't look like it's gonna rain to

me Colonel.

MICHELLE

Pete, cmon sit down, have somethin to

eat.

CHRIS

First of all I was a sergeant. I worked

for a living.

PETE

Did you ever smoke anybody?

CONNIE

Pete!

MICHELLE

Pete!

PETE

Y'know, Papa's still got your gun locked

up in the garage. Think you could teach

me how to shoot?

CHRIS

I figured that'd be scrap metal by now

dad.

DAD

No, I'm still hoping that you'll melt

that thing down on your own.

CHRIS

Sorry Pete.

PETE

Whatever. I'm outta here Mom.

MICHELLE

Okay, be back by ten.

PETE

Ten thirty (as he walks out)

MICHELLE

Ten!

DAD

Remind you of anyone?

PETE

Ok it rained. Happy?

CHRIS

No. Why dontcha crash on the floor?

CHRIS

Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash

on the bed.

PETE

uh uh. (starts walking out)

CHRIS

Pete. (hands him a towel). Keep ya dry.

PETE

Did you really kill people?

CHRIS

Ray Ray! Ahaaa.

RAY

Hello puddin'.

CHRIS

How ya doin?

RAY

I'm alright.

CHRIS

What is that? (points to the van)

RAY

That's the lovemachine.

CHRIS

Girls actually get in there?

CHRIS

How ya been?

RAY

Good. Clean livin.

CHRIS

Wanna beer?

RAY

No. Believe it or not I quit drinkin.

I'll take a soda though.

CHRIS

Here.

RAY

Thanks man.

CHRIS

Whoah. (spots a tattoo of a guitar on

Ray's arm).

RAY

Ya like that? When you left town it

gave me the idea that I should do something

with my life too so uhh I went down

to Seattle, got a guitar and became

all about music. And then pretty soon

I was about music and drugs, n pretty

soon I was basically just about drugs.

Ended up doin 2 years for B+E.

CHRIS

I'm sorry.

RAY

Nahh, look at me now though right? I

been clean and sober for 14 months,

doing construction and renewing those

supportive and healthy friendships from

my past. Matter of fact I talked to

the bastards, told em you were back

and they asked me to politely remind

you that kick off's in twenty minutes.

CHRIS

Playin ball?

ALL

Let's play ball!

JIMMY

Ray go deep go deep! (as Ray runs off

he throws the ball into Ray's back).

CHRIS

(Spotting a sign that reads 'HAMILTON

FIELD') When did that happen?

JIMMY

His parents hadn't left him the mill

more than 2 minutes before he shut it

down.

CHRIS

Why?

JAY

Cause I opened my Casino.

CHRIS

Still got a gut huh Jay?

JAY

Still got your reflexes. What, you get

tired of being all that you can be?

CHRIS

I'm still all I can be.

JAY

Really? I'll just have to see about

that. What brings you home?

CHRIS

I just wanna relax, catch my breath.

JAY

You? Relax?

JAY

Not today.

RAY

If we score here we win right?

CHRIS

Alright boys, last play. We need to

put this to rest.

RAY

Just give me the ball.

CHRIS

You got it. On the first hut!

JAY

Ok Vaughn, last chance.

JAY

That's game!

OPPONENT

(to Chris) Sorry about that.

CHRIS

That's cool man.

JAY

Welcome home.

CHRIS

Good to be back.

JAY

See ya round. Hey, if you're not doing

anythin later on you could come by the

casino. I'll introduce ya to some nice

girls, drinks are on me. Whaddya say?

CHRIS

See ya tonight.

JAY

Cool.

PETE

Hey Sarge, good game. Maybe next time.

CHRIS

Hold up. Maybe next time I won't see

you with the bleachers smoking weed.

RAY

Welcome home buddy.

CHRIS

Don't you have to be native american

to own a casino?

JIMMY

Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man

now.

FRIEND 2

Just so you guys know, I'm gonna triple

my money tonight.

FRIEND 3

Yea, like last time. Wound up selling

your body for bus fare.

FRIEND 4

He had to walk!

CHRIS

Nobody's gonna have any problems finding

this place.

RAY

It's the subtle attention to aesthetics

that I find most impressive, blends

in with the mountains SO nicely.

FRIEND

Not bad huh?

CHRIS

Not bad.

RAY

Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling

needs under one great big roof. You

got your ATM machine, tellers to cash

your paycheck, and when you're here

you don't gotta worry about those lil

things like child support, rent, the

laws of mathematical probability.

WORKER

Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to

invite you to the VIP lounge.

RAY

Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton.

JAY

Heyyy, the dream team!

CHRIS

Nice place.

JAY

Yeah well. Welcome to my world. Look

tonight, all the drinks are on the house.

If you need a line of credit, say how

much. And if you need a lil female companionship...

done. Alright? Have a good time.

CHRIS

Where you goin?

JAY

Don't you worry about me, I've got a

few things to do. Enjoy.

RAY

Just remember, nothin in here's free.

C'mon, this place is nothin but fake

boobs and real assholes if ya ask me.

Just water for me.

FRIENDS

Here's to you Chris.

FRIEND

Don't say we never did nothin' for ya!

FRIEND 2

Don't worry, everybody's a lil scared

the first time. Get in there, sit back

and enjoy.

FRIEND 2

If you're not back by morning we'll

send a search party for you.

CHRIS

Bye! No drinking.

STRIPPER

So you from here or just visiting.

CHRIS

Lil of both, I grew up here.

STRIPPER

So you've seen all the old faces.

CHRIS

Could say that.

STRIPPER

Your voice sounds very familiar.

STRIPPER

Chris...

CHRIS

Deni..

FRIEND 1

Look who's back.

FRIEND 2

So, good surprise?

FRIEND 1

Told you it was better than gambling.

You met Candy? (A girl is dancing on

their table)

CHRIS

Hey Candy. (to the guys) Let's go.

CROUPIER

6! Easy 6 for a win!

JIMMY

(To some girls) We can do a 6.

JIMMY

(To Chris) We're gettin killed out here.

I need you to put 200 down for the bet.

CHRIS

No, hell no.

FRIEND 3

Look at them (Nods to girls).

CHRIS

Ok.

CROUPIER

Five hundred on 6?

JIMMY

Yes, I'm in. Boom! Gimme some dice.

CROUPIER

Lookin' for a 6.

CHRIS

Jimmy. Don't roll. Gimme the dice.

CROUPIER

Lookin' for a 6. Ohhhhh.

CHRIS

(To the croupier) You're good, but I

saw it.

CROUPIER

Saw what?

CHRIS

I saw the switch.

CROUPIER

Hey this is a clean game asshole.

CHRIS

Yea?

CROUPIER

Yea.

CHRIS

Let's see about that.

CHRIS

Bet you I'll roll a seven.

CROUPIER

It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not

your roll. Call security.

CHRIS

Put your bets down on the pass line.

These dice are comin up seven.

JIMMY

Chris, why don't we just let it go?

CHRIS

No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The

dice are comin up seven.

CROUPIER

It's not your roll sir.

COMMISSIONER

No folks, no payout.

CHRIS

(To croupier) Why don't you just take

care of that bet and we're even.

CROUPIER

Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate

bet, you're not the shooter. It's not

your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.

SECURITY GUY

Is there a problem?

CHRIS

Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded.

Does your boss know about this? Just

gimme my money.

JIMMY

Come on, let's go! let's go!

BAD GUY 1

(Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special

forces? I'll take that.

BAD GUY 2

What are you doin?

BAD GUY 1

(Has a scalpel in his hand) Special

forces... special treatment.

BAD GUY 2

This guy knows Hamilton!

DOCHRIS

(To Chris' family) Folks, he's pretty

banged up, inside and out. Whoever did

this left him for dead. A lesser man

wouldn't have survived.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I'm gonna need a statement from him

Doctor.

DOCHRIS

He's in no condition to give you one.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I'll also need a copy of your write-up

along with toxicoloy, blood alcohol

level and so on.

MICHELLE

What are you talkin about Stan?

SHERIFF WATKINS

I'm just tryin to get some facts here.

MICHELLE

Oh come on you need to be out arresting

whoever tried to kill my brother not

testing his BLOOD.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok?

I understand how you feel. But we still

don't know yet who started all of this.

CONNIE

Well it wasn't Chris.

DAD

Just find out who did this to him Stan.

SHERIFF WATKINS

I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really

will. In the meantime I have to file

a full report. You lemme know when I

can talk to him.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Thank you.

DOCHRIS

He's gonna be fine Michelle.

MICHELLE

Thanks.

NURSE

BEAUTIFUL flowers!

RAY

Thank you, they're for my best friend.

RAY

Hey sarge, so much for our VIP... status.

Don't they teach you any fighting skills

in the army.

CHRIS

How did you do?

RAY

Not good. But I tell you, that guy was

feelin me this morning.

RAY

You okay?

CHRIS

Some homecoming hey.

RAY

I don't know if you've noticed but this

aint exactly home any more.

PETE

There's some old crutches in the garage.

DAD

Changed the plugs a while back.

CHRIS

Appreciate that Dad.

DAD

I might've had serious issues with your

career choice but just didn't seem fair

to take it out on an innocent truck.

Where you headin?

CHRIS

I was goin into town to get some supplies.

Wanna come?

DAD

Let's go.

DAD

Ya whole life, all you wanted to do

was get outta here. What made you come

back.

CHRIS

You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking

about the mill. When I was a kid goin

to visit you at work, the smell of that

fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.

DAD

Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before

the mill closed.

CHRIS

When did they go outta business? (Nods

to a closed supply store).

DAD

Closed about six months ago. There's

a home depot about fifteen minutes up

the road.

CHRIS

And that? (Nods to an adult XXX shop)

DAD

Don't ask.

JAY

Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks.

CHRIS

For what?

JAY

He's been fired, and his gaming permit's

been pulled. I don't know how my security

cameras didn't catch that.

CHRIS

They miss a lot at your place don't

they Jay.

JAY

Look Chris I hate seein ya like this.

CHRIS

Your boys did it.

JAY

Wait wait... so they got a little rough,

they were a bit edgy. Understandably.

You don't know what kind of assholes

they have to put up with on a daily

basis. Look, they've been reprimanded.

They say you went nuts man. I'm sorry.

I know the proper term vets use is post

traumatic stress.

CHRIS

What the fuck are you talking about?

JAY

Whatever it was, you tore my place apart

and it wasn't easy for me to get my

guys agree not to press charges. Look

Chris, if you had a problem... shouldn't

you have come to me? Look, I wanna bring

you inside. Chris I wanna make you head

of security. Whaddya say?

CHRIS

No.

JAY

Ah well. I guess you probably need time

to think about it. This is for you.

It's a little something to help you

get... Y'know..

JAY

Come on man, don't be like that. I came

all the way out here to your house just

to see you get back on your feet.

CHRIS

I'm goin to the sheriff.

JAY

I'm sorry you feel that way. I'll see

ya round Chris.

CHRIS

Excuse me.

CHRIS

Excuse me.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and

about, you're lookin spiffy.

CHRIS

I'm here to press charges.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Well this isn't about that incident

at the casino a while back is it?

CHRIS

Yea, it is.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Cause that matter's closed.

CHRIS

Did you look into it?

SHERIFF WATKINS

They did an internal investigation.

That's good enough for me.

CHRIS

An internal investigation.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Chris, I know you're familiar with the

term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's

what the casino is. Since the mill closed

down that casino is the main source

of revenue in this town. So, case closed

basically. I'll see ya.

CHRIS

I'm not gonna let this stand.

SHERIFF WATKINS

Excuse me? What did you say to me?

CHRIS

I said I'm not gonna let this stand.

SHERIFF WATKINS

You're lucky to be alive right now,

that's all you need to be concentrating

on. This is my town ok, I'm the sheriff

here. I'll tell you what will stand,

not the other way around. Now please

get out of my building.

DENI

Hey.

CHRIS

Hey.

DENI

This belongs to you.

CHRIS

I appreciate that, I thought this was

history.

DENI

Coulda left it in the trash but I...

CONNIE

Deni? Nice to see you dear.

DENI

Hi Mrs Vaughn.

CHRIS

Can I talk to you outside for a second.

Mom I'll be right back.

DENI

How you been?

CHRIS

Been better.

DENI

Talked to the sheriff yet?

CHRIS

Well I went down to the police station

and I talked to somebody with a badge.

Sure as hell didn't seem like much of

a sheriff.

DENI

He's up for re-election you know. Maybe

you could take his job.

CHRIS

Somebody ought to. How about you?

DENI

Sunshine and pine trees. Been readin

these books, teach you how to cultivate

happiness. Books on the future, go with

the flow, that sorta thing.

CHRIS

Is it workin?

DENI

I have my moments.

CHRIS

So the casino huh?

DENI

Yep. Been there almost a year.

CHRIS

Treatin you good?

DENI

Lot better than it treated you.

CHRIS

I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well

for himself hasn't he.

DENI

Yea, he's a real go-getter that one.

CHRIS

Must be. I heard he got you.

DENI

Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long

time ago.

CHRIS

You still work for him though.

DENI

Rent's gotta be paid Chris.

CHRIS

Suppose so.

DENI

Hope to see you around.

CHRIS

Do you?

CHRIS

Thanks for the jacket.

CONNIE

And where is he?

MICHELLE

It's ok mom he's stabilised. (To Chris)

It was close. Crystal Meth.

PETE

I'm sorry. I never did it before.

KID

It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him

into it.

CHRIS

Where'd you get the drugs?

KID

I'm not really sure...

CHRIS

Stop. Where?

KID

From the security guys workin at the

casino.

CONNIE

Chris, wait. Call the police.

CHRIS

No, that won't do any good.

DAD

Is Pete ok?

CHRIS

He'll be fine.

DAD

What are you doin?

DAD

Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen

to me. If you go outta here with that

gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!

JAY

Guess that changes our relationship

a bit huh?

SHERIFF WATKINS

You should NOT have come looking for

trouble. Keep your hands up, get out

of the vehicle now Chris! NOW!

LAWYER

I advise you to give this offer more

than a little serious thought. If you

go to trial you stand to do 18 years.

This is a sweet plea, normally they

wouldn't even put it on the table but

your military record can't be ignored.

Three months home arrest, some community

service. Pretty generous offer Chris.

CHRIS

But I'd have to plead guilty.

LAWYER

Look at it from the other side. There's

over a dozen witnesses, none of em are

gonna paint a very flattering picture.

WORKER

He started bustin up the machines...

GIRL

There was a gunshot..

WORKER

Went crazy...

GIRL

Complete psychopath.

CHRIS

They're only offering me this deal just

to keep me quiet.

LAWYER

Well I still say you should take it.

CHRIS

I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

CASINO GUARD

Our job is to keep order. But there

was no chance of that. Me and my men

we were just tryin to control him. He

was highly trained, violent, very dangerous

person.

PROSECUTOR

So dangerous, so violent, so highly

trained that he despatched six of the

casino staff single handedly. His weapon

of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which

in his hand became a devastating force

with one aim, to hurt people, destroy

property.

WORKER

He went directly for everything. He

just came in and took over the place.

PROSECUTOR

You said he broke your arm.

WORKER

Yea that's correct, my right forearm.

Both bones with a single shot. It was

crazy.

CASINO GUARD 2

You know, toss out a coupla drunks now

and then. Guys try to grope the girls,

but ah nothing with this sort of violence.

PROSECUTOR

Did he give you any kind of advanced

warning? A chance to defend yourself.

CASINO GUARD 2

We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was

on a mission. Besides, he seemed to

be too busy enjoying himself from what

I could see.

PROSECUTOR

So from what you saw, it seemed like

he had some kinda purpose?

CASINO GUARD 2

I think he had a point to prove yeah.

WORKER

I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh

came in and started swingin.

GIRL

I was tryin to get outta there.

JUDGE

Mr Crow, you may present your client's

case.

CHRIS

(To his lawyer) You're fired.

CHRIS

Your honor, I'd like to plead my own

case.

JUDGE

Order, order. Mr Vaughn, if you choose

to represent yourself and not be represented

by legal counsel you realise that you

can't then claim a mistrial on that

basis.

CHRIS

Yes I do.

JUDGE

Very well Mr Vaughn.

CHRIS

I don't deny anything that was said

here today.

JUDGE

Does that mean you're changing your

plea to guilty?

CHRIS

I'm not guilty of anything. Except standing

up for myself when the law wouldn't.

OPPOSITION

Objection. He's trying to introduce

prior events your honor.

JUDGE

Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point.

CHRIS

I grew up in this town. People used

to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't

have traded the mill for a crooked casino.

JUDGE

Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to

civic speeches.

CHRIS

And they wouldn't have stood around

while drugs were being sold to kids.

OPPOSITION

Objection.

JUDGE

Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to

being held in contempt.

CHRIS

I was justified in what I did, and if

you acquit me of these charges I'm gonna

run for sheriff. And if elected, I'm

gonna fix this town.

JUDGE

Order, order. Mr Vaughn you are now

charged with contempt.

CHRIS

And I will make sure that THIS (He opens

his shirt revealing huge scarring) never

happens to anyone again without punishing

those who did it.

JUDGE

I order the jury to ignore what they

have just seen. Mr Vaughn take your

seat. Order! Order!

JUDGE

Mr Forman, has the jury reached a verdict?

FORMAN

We have your honor.

JUDGE

Will the defendant please rise.

FORMAN

We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not

guilty.

CHRIS

This is mine.

WATKINS

Sheriff.

CHRIS

Watkins.

WATKINS

Well you won the election, congratulations.

We do have a tradition of professional

courtesy up here, and I can personally

vouch for each and every one of these

men. They're good deputies.

CHRIS

You're all fired.

JAY

Hey Chris.

CHRIS

License and registration please.

JAY

You're joking right?

CHRIS

License and registration.

JAY

What's the problem sheriff?

CHRIS

You. And the drugs you're pedalling

out of your casino.

JAY

Oh. Only thing that's going on in my

casino right now is reconstruction.

You took care of that.

CHRIS

Yea that's right and I plan on taking

care of everything else too.

JAY

If you can, try to think this through.

A casino is a license to print money.

Why would I jeopardise that by selling

drugs?

CHRIS

Cause you owned the town Jay. It's changed

now.

JAY

Really? See the only thing that I think

has changed around here is that every

morning you get to wake up and put on

that nifty lil badge. But underneath

that badge is the same guy that couldn't

make it playing college football, apparently

couldn't make it in the army and not

gonna make it as a cop.

CHRIS

Is that right?

JAY

Yea, and if you push too hard you're

gonna be a man who doesn't live to see

40. License please.

JAY

Thanks sheriff.

CHRIS

Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's

your last warning.

JAY

What's wrong with my tail lights?

CHRIS

They're broken.

RAY

Mornin sheriff.

CHRIS

Mornin deputy.

RAY

No, nope, no. Come on man you know I

hate cops. You been sheriff 2 minutes

and I'm already startin to hate you.

I'm a convicted felon.

CHRIS

I got a lil pull around here.

RAY

Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours

for friends. That's how it starts. See

next thing you know you'll be taking

bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking

dudes crotches.

CHRIS

Are you done? Ray I need your help.

RAY

Oh don't do that.

CHRIS

I need you to take me to drugs school.

RAY

I get to wear a uniform?

CHRIS

You're SURE you're not carrying anything.

BOOTH

I don't have shit.

CHRIS

Officer.

RAY

Yeah.

CHRIS

Search him.

RAY

Oh. Spread your legs, arms down. Been

workin out? Nothin there. Ohhhh somebody

needs a BATH!

BOOTH

Now you read me my rights and take me

in. And I call my lawyer.

RAY

K. I have a hunch there may be somethin

else in here (Pats the dealer's truck).

CHRIS

Could be.

RAY

He's clean. Guess we gotta move to plan

B.

BOOTH

Screw you, I do have a bit of information

for you. It's not just me actually,

there's a whole lotta people in on this

one.

CHRIS

Spit it out.

BOOTH

You're gonna get hurt.

DAD

Why does it always have to be your fight?

CHRIS

You might need this.

DAD

No. I put my guns down a long time ago.

CHRIS

You're just being stubborn.

DAD

You and me both boy. Chris, listen.

You be careful.

CHRIS

I will.

RAY

Please step away from the vehicle. Now

Mr Booth are you still upset over that

body cavity search? WOOOOOOOO! I forgot,

you got no vehicle. Please disperse,

there is nothing to s...

CHRIS

Can I talk to you?

RAY

Yeah.

CHRIS

Over here?

RAY

Sure.

CHRIS

I'm gonna stay with him tonight. I need

you to take care of my parent's place.

RAY

You think they're gonna take it that

far?

RAY

I'm with you man, I'll check in later.

CHRIS

Kay.

DENI

Don't shoot.

CHRIS

Hey

DENI

Hi. How's the food around here? Brought

you special treats. Salmon, Fried Chicken,

Potato Salad. You got cups?

CHRIS
