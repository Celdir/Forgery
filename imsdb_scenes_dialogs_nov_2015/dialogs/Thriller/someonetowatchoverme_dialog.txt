MIKE

(calling to his

wife, for a family

portrait)

Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!

SCOTTY

(to Mike)

No joke?  You're being transferred

to the 19th as your first

assignment?  Who the hell loves your

ass downtown?

ROOKIE

(naively)

What's the 21st?

SCOTTY

What d'you care?  You'll never know.

BROOKLYN

Manhattan.  The Upper East Side,

East 59th to 96th.

SCOTTY

(to the others)

Remember Curran from the Sixteenth?

He posted a coupla months there on a

floater outside the French embassy.

He met Jackie Kennedy.

BROOKLYN

Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He

probably wrote her up for letting

her dog dump on Rockefeller's

doorstep.

HELEN

Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so

proud of you!  What the hell took

you so long?

MIKE

Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who

put in the good word.

MIKE

If T.J. didn't push for me, I never

would've made it.

BROOKLYN

Bet your ass... I give you six weeks

before you're back on the beat,

Keegan, they got no room for hero

cops...

MIKE

Appreciate, that vote of confidence,

Brook.

BROOKLYN

Hey, am I supportive, or what?

HELEN

He left Elaine for that?

WIFE #1

And what about little Scotty?

HELEN

(still staring)

I'd like to tie her tits together.

ELLIE

That wouldn't be too difficult.

MIKE

(overhearing)

I bet you think she doesn't have a

brain in her head.  I bet you think

the only thing he sees in her is one

incredible, dynamite body...

HELEN

I love your husband, Ellie, but he's

a real dork.

ELLIE

Yeah, but he's my dork.

DISSOLVE TO:

T.J.

We're goin'.  Get some sleep,

Detective Keegan.  You got a new job

tomorrow.

CUT TO:

MIKE

(a whisper)

Think I should put the skateboard in

bed with him?

ELLIE

Too kinky.

MIKE

Ellie, you know I think it's about

time we got outa this place, get us

a house of our own.  We can afford

it now.

ELLIE

Amen to that.  The supermarket's

full of assholes.

MIKE

Take my advice, don't buy any...

ELLIE

Mike?

MIKE

(aware of her change

in tone)

What?

ELLIE

My ass if falling.

MIKE

Your what...?

ELLIE

My ass is falling.  It is.

MIKE

(a laugh)

What are you talking about?

ELLIE

(appears in the door;

stricken)

I just saw it in the mirror, it

doesn't look like my ass anymore.

MIKE

Get in bed.

ELLIE

What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the

exercises on TV in the morning...

gravity...

MIKE

You got a great ass!  I love your

ass -- now get that falling ass into

bed before it hits the floor.

ELLIE

(a declaration)

Tomorrow, I start looking for our

house... You love me?

MIKE

(deeply)

You got no idea...

ELLIE

Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.

WIN

Hi... nice to see you... thank

you... my pleasure...

A MET BENEFACTRESS

(effusively)

Thank you so much for agreeing to

host us tonight.  It's really

extraordinary!

WIN

Glad I could be of help.

WIN

Claire!

CLAIRE

Hello, Win.

CLAIRE

(introducing her

companion)

You know Neil Steinhart?

WIN

Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why

is it Claire always connects with

the richest men this side of Saudi?

NEIL

(to Win; meaning the

club)

This gives new meaning to the word

nightlife.

WIN

C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow

rag trade...

(smiles, cutting

Neil out)

You don't mind, do you?

MANAGER

(a dilemma)

I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...

WIN

Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them

since that shitty pasta dinner on

the cape.

CLAIRE

They've got two monsters now.  Both

boys.

WIN

And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it

serious?

CLAIRE

You didn't like him?

WIN

Looks a little constipated to me.

CLAIRE

(needling him)

It's called "solid"... Nice to find

someone you can count on, Win.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WIN

The main floor stays public.  The

side rooms we try to keep available

for special functions like tonight.

CLAIRE

It's terrific Win.

WIN

You still writing the occasional

magazine article?

CLAIRE

Occasionally.

WIN

Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in

the basement, you're going to get a

privileged peek.

VOICE (O.S.)

Claire!

WIN

(to Claire, quietly)

Just press the button all the way

down when you're ready, okay?

NEIL

Where's she go?

WIN

Probably found somebody nicer...

Kidding.  You're great.

WIN

You're in overtime, Freddy.

CLAIRE

I will... I promise...

VENZA

(bear, icily)

You need money, you come to me.

VENZA

(approaching,

soundlessly)

Who the fuck do you think you are,

raising cash without coming to me?

WIN

(calmer)

Your ex-partner... I'm buying you

out, Joey.  Read the contract.

There's ample provision.

VENZA

Fuck the contract!

VENZA

(stares, wildly)

Two years ago you were begging me

for the money.  Nobody would've

touched you...

WIN

You're making an eighty percent

return.  Which is what you wanted.

VENZA

Don't turn away when I'm talking to

you.

WIN

(beat with

deliberation)

Grease and water still don't mix,

Joey.

WIN

(stunned)

Jesus Christ... are you crazy?

WIN

Joey!

WIN

(staggering back)

Jesus...!

MIKE

T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you

kidding me?

(listening, not

liking what he

hears)

Give me 20 minutes.

ELLIE

(mumbling from under

the covers)

Switch the light off on your way

out.

CUT TO:

T.J.

(grinning)

Hey Mike, out of the bag into the

bureau, huh... How do you like it so

far?

MIKE

(giving a half smile)

Right behind you, T.J.

CUT TO:

GARBER

Did you ever hear the chatter.

They're worse than fuckin' four-

year-olds... Miller, let's clear

this path here, all right?

GARBER

(to them, on the

move)

Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of

this place is dead.  And I got a

witness, and a suspect... Joey

Venza.

T.J.

Where's Venza?

GARBER

Nice question.  I like questions

like that.

MIKE

(to T.J.)

Who's Joey Venza?

T.J.

Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families

dropped him when they found they had

a fruitcake on their hands.  But he

knows where a lot of bodies are

buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if

he could bring him in.

GARBER

(returning, re: the

crowd)

Okay, let's find out what we know.

Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody

know more than gossip about the

deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to

them myself.  Go.

T.J.

Okay, will all the beautiful people

shut the fuck up, before it starts

gettin' real ugly here!

GARBER

(to Mike, the "new

boy")

Keegan, go baby-sit the witness.

Just sit and look impressive.  Make

her feel protected.  And if you can

get her boyfriend outa my hair, I'll

promote you to fuckin' Joint

Chiefs...

CUT TO:

COP

Quit playing with yourself, Keegan.

I know who you are.

MIKE

(grinning)

A Detective's supposed to identify

himself.

CUT TO:

NEIL

(upset)

Are you in charge here?

MIKE

No, sir...

NEIL

I asked for the man in charge...

MIKE

That would be Lieutenant Garber, and

he's very busy upstairs...

NEIL

Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked

for an ambulance for this woman

and...

MIKE

Is she injured?

CLAIRE

(softly)

No.

NEIL

(to Claire)

You're not going to talk to anyone

without a lawyer.

MIKE

She's not a suspect, sir, she's a

witness.  Could I ask you to step

outside, please.

NEIL

No, I will not step outside.

MIKE

Sir, I am just trying to do my job,

it's standard procedure to question

the witness alone.  Help me out

here, could you please leave.

NEIL

(icily)

I don't really see what that has to

do with...

CLAIRE

(deadened; to Neil)

Neil, do what he says.

CLAIRE

(quietly)

Please.

NEIL

I'll be right outside.

MIKE

Can I get you a cup of coffee or

something?

CLAIRE

(lost)

I've never seen anyone killed

before.

MIKE

It's okay... I've never been a

detective before either...

MIKE

We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get

through it together.

CUT TO:

GARBER

I don't know how you did it, but

whatever it was, keep doing it.

MIKE

(puzzled)

I just sat and listened.

GARBER

Safe and secure is how we want her.

Until she I.D.'s Venza.

GARBER

Venza's either going to skip or try

to get to her and Venza likes it

here.  I want her ass covered, 24

hour protection, but I don't want

her to know there is any real

danger.

T.J.

I don't like what I'm hearing...

MIKE

(to Garber)

I don't understand.  If there's any

danger, why not just level with

her...

GARBER

(with mock tolerance)

T.J. your friend's a little dense.

When she realizes there's a killer

tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on

the next plane for Tahiti... somehow

I think my way is better.

MIKE

Chief?

MIKE

Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as

good a job.

GARBER

When I want your advise, Keegan,

I'll make an appointment.

MIKE

(disappointed)

Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first

detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!

(turning to T.J.)

I got a 'choice' at all.

T.J.

Do it, or look for another

profession.  That's a choice I

guess.

MIKE

You in this with me?

T.J.

Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.

MIKE

(yelling)

Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these

skateboards off the goddamn kitchen

floor!

TOMMY

What're we having?

MIKE

My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

TOMMY

(frowns dubiously)

Scrambled eggs surprise?

ELLIE

So how'd it go?

MIKE

Not great.  I've got a babysitting

job for a material witness on a

homicide.

ELLIE

For how long?

MIKE

'Til they pick up the perp.

(he sits)

Seniority gets day shift... You know

what that means.

ELLIE

Well, I'll live with it, I've lived

with it all my life.  My Dad was a

cop, he said, "whatever you do,

honey, never go out with a cop".

So, what did I do?  I got a job with

the cops.  Then I married a cop.  I

probably gave birth to a cop.

(shouting)

Tommy!  Come over here and eat, it's

hot.

MIKE

Maybe you and Tommy should stay with

my Mom.

MIKE

Don't start... The only reason is

that the neighborhood's shi...

(realizing that

Tommy is listening)

... crummy.  I just don't like the

idea of leaving you alone here at

night.

ELLIE

I can still use a gun.

MIKE

Just keep it someplace safe, but

handy.

TOMMY

(zooming in)

Keep what handy?

ELLIE

Nothing.

TOMMY

The gun?  It's in the upstairs

closet.

MIKE

How do you know where the gun is?

TOMMY

I know where everything is.

MIKE

Except the goddamn skateboards,

which are everywhere!  I'd like to

kill the guy who invented those

things.

TOMMY

Lay back, Mack.

MIKE

Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay

back, Mack?"

(to Ellie)

Where does he get this?

ELLIE

Keep the weekends for us, huh?  Get

a replacement for Saturday nights.

That'll give us the weekends

together.

TOMMY

God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?!

These are pickles...!  God!

MIKE

Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

CUT TO:

GARBER

(approaching Mike)

You remember Detective Keegan?

NEIL

(expressionless)

I do.

NEIL

I want to make sure that everyone

respects the privacy of Miss

Gregory's household.  You're limited

to the outer vestibule, so you can

watch the elevator, the kitchen, so

you can get something to eat, and

the washroom.

T.J.

(under his breath to

Mike)

So you can take a shit.

MIKE

(reacting; to T.J.)

Not Koontz.

T.J.

Be happy.  He's good at this.

GARBER

(to Neil)

We'd like to, just once, get a look

at the entire layout, so we can

evaluate security.

CLAIRE

This really isn't necessary.  The

security in this building is about

the best in the city.

GARBER

(ever the diplomat)

I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory,

but I'd consider it a favor if you'd

let us look around.

CLAIRE

Be my guest.

GARBER

(to his troops)

Guys.

MIKE

(to Garber)

What about when she goes out?

GARBER

Discourage it.  But stay with her if

you can't.  Call it in first so we

can have a car on tail.  She's

agreed to travel only with her own

driver and limousine... okay, let's

check it out.

MIKE

(re: the "door")

Pretty good.

NEIL

Why an I reminded of the Three

Stooges?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MARY

(officiously)

You a vegetarian?  Miss Gregory's a

vegetarian, so I'm gonna put food

for you people in a separate fridge.

You know how to use a microwave?

(before he can

answer)

Just about everything you'd want

will heat up by turning this to

ninety seconds.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

(under his breath)

Fuckin' A.

CLAIRE

Excuse me.

CLAIRE

This is my dressing room, and these

are my clothes.

(holding herself

firm)

I understand your responsibilities...

but I'd appreciate you staying out

of here at all times.

MIKE

Sorry.  Just checking.

CLAIRE

Straight ahead.

MIKE

Hard to find doors in this place.

CLAIRE

... Detective Keegan, I hope you

understand how upsetting this is?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NEIL (O.S.)

(barely audible)

... just saying you should think

twice about it...

CLAIRE (O.S.)

... I don't want to talk about it...

CLAIRE

... You know, and I know, that the

only thing standing between a life

sentence for Venza and his freedom

is my testimony at his trial...

NEIL

Claire...

CLAIRE

... He killed Win... he enjoyed

it...

NEIL

Win made his choices, Claire.  We

all do --

CLAIRE

And I'm making mine.

NEIL

(gently)

You're dealing with a psychopath.

He gets out of jail in ten years, or

five... or ninety days, and you'll

be looking over your shoulder for

the rest of your life...

CLAIRE

What am I supposed to do?!  I saw

one of my oldest friends get killed!

And I saw who did it!

(through tears)

I can't just -- "let it go away"!!

NEIL

(gently)

Claire...

MIKE

(chagrined)

I like 'em toasty.

MARY

Good night, Mr. Keegan.

NEIL

You're here 'til what time?

MIKE

I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

NEIL

When you're through with it, put it

back, please, exactly where you

found it, and don't use the library

again.  I have to leave town for a

few days.  Let's do everything we

can to make this less of a trial for

her, shall we?

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to

my car?

ELLIE

Changing the sparks.  They showed it

on TV.  What d'you think?

MIKE

I think television's a dangerous

thing.

ELLIE

It's twenty bucks in the bank.

ELLIE

Enough, Tommy!  C'mon.  Get out of

there!

MIKE

Hey.  The neighbors.

ELLIE

Let 'em eat their hearts out.

ELLIE

I read the article.  You didn't tell

me she was so beautiful.

MIKE

(Mister Honest)

Well, actually, she looks better

than that.

MIKE

I've got to go.

MIKE

See you Tommy.

MIKE

Okay?

ELLIE

Unbelievably handsome.  You look

fantastic in a suit.

TOMMY

Nice threads Dad.

MIKE

Yeah, I think so.

MIKE

(brilliant)

Hi.

CLAIRE

I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this

works.  I have to go out... is that

all right?

MIKE

(unprepared)

Uh...

CLAIRE

I have to pick something up before

Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a

reception just a few blocks away.

MIKE

(faltering)

I think, maybe, that isn't such a

great idea...

CLAIRE

Lieutenant Garber said that in all

likelihood there was no real danger,

is that true?

MIKE

Right.  That's true.

CLAIRE

Can we go then?

MIKE

I'm supposed to call in.

CLAIRE

There's a phone in the car.

CLAIRE

Do you have another tie?  Something

more conservative?

MIKE

(confused, then

realizing)

Oh... Yes... I don't have it with

me.  It's at home.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

What's the number?

CUT TO:

GARBER

Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic.

Fucking shopping.

(he thinks)

I don't see that we have much

choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her

she's a fucking lunatic.

CLAIRE

What did he say?

MIKE

He thinks you're being a little

careless.  He made the point several

times.

CLAIRE

You live in Manhattan?

MIKE

Queens... You know Queens?

CLAIRE

My father founded a music school

there.  The Milton Gregory School.

CLAIRE

I'm supposed to speak at their tenth

anniversary.

MIKE

Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have

an aperitif...

MIKE

Maybe not.

CUT TO:

MIKE

(to the driver)

Don't move it.

PERFUME LADY

Hello, Miss Gregory.

DARK-SUITED MAN

I'm sorry... I thought this was

down...

CLAIRE

Are you nervous?

MIKE

No, Ma'am.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Would you wrap it for me, I'll be

back in a moment.

CLAIRE

Could you come with me please.

CLAIRE

Would you pick one out, please?

MIKE

Beg pardon?

CLAIRE

Since you're going to be my escort,

you'll need a new tie.

SALESPERSON

Perfect.

CLAIRE

Put it on my account, please.

MIKE

I got money.

CLAIRE

If we had more time we'd work on the

suit too.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

You look quite elegant, actually.

MIKE

My wife likes this suit.

CUT TO:

TRAFFIC COP

(re: Claire's limo)

Bring it in, close.

COP

Jesus Christ.

MIKE

I'm on duty.

COP

What kind of work?  Gigolo?

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

You can touch me, I won't bite.

MIKE

Not too sure about that.

MARGE

(pushing through)

CLAIRE!  Claire!  Darling!  Are you

all right?

MARGE

My God!  I couldn't believe... my

poor darling... and Win Hockings...!

Antonia'll be so happy you're here,

she says a "Lifetime Achievement

Award" is like being invited to your

own funeral while you're still

alive...

ANTONIA

Claire...!

CLAIRE

I wouldn't have missed it, Tony.

ANTONIA

You look so beautiful...

CLAIRE

This is Mike Keegan, the policeman

assigned to protect me.  Antonia

Bolt...

MARGE

(change of tone)

Hello.

CLAIRE

(introducing)

Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is

Mike Keegan...

MIKE

(ultra respectful)

Hello...

(a deferential nod

to Antonia)

... Ma'am.

ANTONIA

(liking him; to

Claire)

He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle.

(re: Mike's

embarrassed

reaction)

And he blushes.  I like that.  Take

good care of her.

PRETTY YOUNG THING

I hear you're a policeman.

MIKE

Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

PRETTY YOUNG THING

Ever shot anyone?

MIKE

Yes.

PRETTY YOUNG THING

Does it make you... hard?

MIKE

... Hard?

PRETTY YOUNG THING

Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd

heard that it gives you a boner, to

shoot a man.

MIKE

Would you excuse me, please?

MIKE

Would you consider leaving here

pretty soon?

CLAIRE

People think I'm stepping out on

Neil.  We're causing quite a

scandal.

MIKE

(confidential)

Hey!  There are crazy people here.

CLAIRE

Let's get a drink.

MIKE

Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.

CLAIRE

I'll have a spritzer, order

something soft for yourself... I

must go for a pee.

MIKE

I'll come with you.

CLAIRE

I think I can probably do that on my

own.

MIKE

(irritated)

Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka

martini.

MIKE

Make it a double.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PRETTY YOUNG THING

You know what?  I don't think you're

a policeman at all.  I think you're

just some schmuck who uses that

"policeman" line as a come-on.

CUT TO:

VENZA

Christ, you're one beautiful woman.

I could kill you right now, but I'm

not gonna... 'cause you're gonna

help me.  You're gonna see me in a

police line-up and say it wasn't me.

And if you don't do that, someone

will come after you.  They're gonna

find you dead, with your face

missing -- understood... Good...

Because otherwise, it'd be this

easy.

VENZA

Now walk outta here.  And if you

ever see me again... you never saw

me before.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Take care of her!

CUT TO:

MIKE

Venza!

CUT TO:

MIKE

(protesting)

But I got him!  He's in jail!

Wasn't that the point...?!

GARBER

You apprehended him after he gave

himself up --

MIKE

It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave

himself up because he knew I was

gonna nab him.

GARBER

Anyone who turns himself in makes a

good case for bail.

MIKE

Even Joey Venza?!

GARBER

He's got a good lawyer, and he made

a smart move.  We've got a scared

witness and a suspect who proved

"good will" by turning himself in.

MIKE

(protesting)

What about when she identifies him?!

GARBER

If she identifies him.

(turns, unloading on

him)

Where the fuck were you anyway,

cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked

right past you, and now we're the

ones playing catch-up!  You better

hope she identifies him.

T.J.

Wasn't your fault.

MIKE

(exasperated)

It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

CUT TO:

ELLIE

The real estate lady left, she

couldn't wait anymore.  What took

you?

MIKE

(upset)

Oh, some shit.

ELLIE

What shit, honey?

MIKE

You don't want to hear about it.

ELLIE

... Look at the fireplace.  You

don't get workmanship like that

anymore.

ELLIE

Ninety-seven five.  What do you

think?

ELLIE

Honey.  You got him.

MIKE

I don't know that Ellie.  He might

get out.  Garber's not bein'

straight with the witness, she could

be in deep shit if she identifies

him, and it's my job to convince her

she won't be.

ELLIE

(the voice of

sanity)

She's got to identify him.

MIKE

Why?

ELLIE

(taken aback)

Because the the only way to stop

crime is to identify criminals.  I

can't believe you're talking this

way Mister Detective -- I think

she's got a lot of guts.

MIKE

I think -- she's crazy.

ELLIE

I'd identify him.

MIKE

I might stop you.

ELLIE

Oh I can see you've had a bad day.

We'll see the house another time,

okay?

MIKE

(trying to recover)

No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven

five right?

ELLIE

Where'd you get the tie?

MIKE

(distracted)

Bought it.

ELLIE

It's not your taste.

MIKE

What did she say the down payment

was?

MIKE

She didn't like the other one, so

she picked this one.

ELLIE

She took you shopping for a tie?

MIKE

I had to follow her to a store.

ELLIE

What's wrong with your paisley tie?

MIKE

Ellie, it was a formal party...

ELLIE

Excuse me!  You went to a party with

her?

MIKE

I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

ELLIE

I know you're her bodyguard.  Did

she buy it or did you?

MIKE

She bought it.

ELLIE

Why?

MIKE

I don't know why she bought me a

tie! -- She's a generous person --

and she's a nice person -- and I

could be settin' her up to be

killed... you want the fuckin' tie?

ELLIE

(joking)

No, I don't want the 'fuckin'" tie

-- I'm sorry --

(conciliatory)

I'm glad she bought you a tie.  You

needed one.  You look good in that

tie.

(a beat)

Next time you two go shopping, maybe

you could tell her we need a new

Maytag stackable, double-decker

washer and dryer set.

ELLIE

You want to see the bedroom.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Hi.  Just checking to see if you're

here.

MIKE

I came on at 8:00.

MIKE

You all right?

CLAIRE

Yeah.

MIKE

I'm sorry about what happened.

CLAIRE

Listen, that was my fault.

MIKE

(disagreeing)

I shouldn't have listened to you, I

should've followed you right into

the "can" the way he did.

CLAIRE

If I had known I was going to have

company, he was right next to me.  I

think he heard me peeing!  I hate

that, I am glad he's in jail.

CLAIRE

Lieutenant Garber says when I

identify him, they're going to lock

him up and throw away the key.

CLAIRE

I guess I'm supposed to do it in the

morning.  Identify him.

MIKE

(uneasy)

Sooner, the better.

CLAIRE

He said he'd kill me.

MIKE

Big talk... Desperate guy.

CLAIRE

Right.  How could he do that if he's

in jail and they've thrown away the

key...?

MIKE

It's the right thing to do.

Identifying him.

MIKE

Claire?

CLAIRE

Hmm...

MIKE

(holds up a book)

You wouldn't happen to know what

language they speak in India, do

you?

CLAIRE

Urdu and Hindi.

MIKE

(amazed)

Yeah, what a woman.

CLAIRE

Didn't do very well, did you?

MIKE

(a laugh)

Nope... never finished one yet.  I

hate these things.

CLAIRE

You were reading my Renoir.

MIKE

How did you know?

CLAIRE

You put it back in the wrong

place... Do you like Renoir?

MIKE

(thoughtful)

They're kind of fuzzy.

CLAIRE

You know why they're like that...?

He was myopic... going blind.

MIKE

No kidding.

CLAIRE

So, this could be your last night,

huh?

MIKE

Could be, I guess.

CLAIRE

(a thought)

Want to go out for a drink?

(re: his surprised

expression)

I mean, we're both sitting here, and

Joey Venza's in jail...

MIKE

(a beat)

Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I

follow.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

(laughing)

You mean to tell me, a mugger would

stay away from someone because they

walked a certain way?

MIKE

Absolutely.  Look at this.

CLAIRE

That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!

MIKE

(indignant)

No, no seriously!  There's a study

done on this, you walk this way, the

muggers are gonna single you out.

CLAIRE

And die laughing, because you're

walking so stupid!

MIKE

(mock anger)

Hey.  This is my business.  Do I

tell you your business.

CLAIRE

Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger

gets me.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MIKE

... It was like... the minute I saw

her... I knew.  She looked so damn

adorable in a cop's uniform...

puttin' on a big, tough act...

CLAIRE

So it was "love".

MIKE

Yeah.  It was.

CLAIRE

And "is"...?

MIKE

(confirming it)

Yeah.

CLAIRE

That's nice.  And you live in

Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?

MIKE

No dog.

CLAIRE

I saw you with a dog, in my mind.

MIKE

No dog.

CLAIRE

But "nice".

MIKE

Very nice.

MIKE

What about Neil?

CLAIRE

You don't like him, do you?

MIKE

(a pause)

What's to like?

CLAIRE

(amused)

Tell it like it is.

MIKE

You asked.

CLAIRE

He's very caring, in his way.  You

haven't seen him at his best.

MIKE

You could do better.

CLAIRE

(laughs)

I'll miss you, Mike...

CLAIRE

It was nice having you "watch over

me"...

MIKE

Yeah.  I liked being around you

too... Claire.

MIKE

Let's go home.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Good night, Mike.

MIKE

Sleep good.

NEIL

It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

Where the hell have you been?

CUT TO:

COP #1

Hey, Mike, tough night.

KOONTZ

I guess it happens, you know?  A

chick gives you a ride in her

limousine, the next thing she wants

is to wear your clothes...

(a beat)

... I heard he had her underpants on

his head.

COP #1

Ease up, Mike.  Ain't nobody gonna

tell the old lady.

KOONTZ

Ain't the first time the taxpayers

paid for a blow-job neither.

CUT TO:

GARBER

(steamed)

Don't tell me it was "no big deal,"

it was out of line, it makes you

look like an asshole, and it makes

me look like an asshole.  She's

coming in, in a few minutes to I.D.

Venza.  If Steinhart's with her, I

want you to apologize.

(in motion)

Let's get this over with...

KOONTZ

Okay, we're gonna have a line-up

here...

CUT TO:

GARBER

Good morning, Miss Gregory.

CLAIRE

It was my fault not Detective

Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the

fuss.

GARBER

(to Claire)

You all ready?

NEIL

(playing the

protector role)

Will this take long?

GARBER

We'll see.

CUT TO:

GARBER

They can't hear you, they can't see

you...

(introducing pro

forma)

Mr. Venza's attorney, Mr. Neuman;

arresting officer Keegan...

(to Claire)

Good luck.

KOONTZ

Okay, take a seat... you, put a

couple phone books under your

rear...

KOONTZ (V.O.) (OVER SPEAKER)

Will everyone except number three

please take one step back?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLIE

Coming to bed?

MIKE

Few minutes.  Want to catch the

news.

ELLIE

(hesitant)

Should I wait up?  We've got to get

up early for the beach tomorrow.

MIKE

I'll be right up.

CUT TO:

NEIL

They need me back in Miami, but I'd

really like it if you could join me.

The marlin fishing's supposed to be

great off the Keys...

NEIL

The change would do you a world of

good.

TV NEWSMAN

Denied bail, Joey Venza will remain

behind bars at least until the time

of the trial --

NEIL

Hallelujah.

NEIL

At least now we can get on with our

own lives.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Hey, not yet!  How many times...

ELLIE

God, it's freezin' out there.

MIKE

(wincing)

Ah!

TOMMY

(a beat)

Wait a sec.

ELLIE

Hello.

(a beat)

Yes, just a second.

(hands it to Mike)

It's the Whip.

MIKE

(into phone)

Hey Lieutenant, how are you...?

What?!

(to Ellie)

Venza's out.

(back to phone;

pissed)

Why didn't the I.D. unit or the

D.A.'s office know about his sheet?

(a beat)

Ah shit... Yeah, yeah, okay I'm on

my way in.

ELLIE

What?

MIKE

Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi

driver in the Bronx, thirteen months

ago.  It's coming to court and the

judge let him walk because of the

pending case law.

ELLIE

Mike, take it easy...

MIKE

Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw

it coming.

ELLIE

It's not your fault.  Mike, please

get off the case.

MIKE

(distraught)

It is my fault!  I'm responsible for

her!

ELLIE

Did you hear what I said?

MIKE

Did you hear what I said?!!

MIKE

(to Ellie, with

finality)

I'm due on at seven.

TOMMY

(dismally)

We're not going to the game, are we

Mom?

ELLIE

(pulling herself

together)

Sure we are, let's go!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KOONTZ

She's a little upset.  You're going

to have to piss in a bottle.

KOONTZ

(packs it under his

arm)

Sorry, I don't have any extras.

Have a nice night.

MIKE (O.S.)

Claire?

CLAIRE

(frightened)

What do you want?

MIKE (O.S.)

Open the door, will you?

CLAIRE

I can't open it.

MIKE (O.S.)

It's just me.  I want to talk to

you.  Let me in...

CLAIRE

You put me life in danger.

MIKE

No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna

pick him up again...

CLAIRE

And then what?  I'll never be safe.

I'll have to leave the country!  You

can't protect me, and you can't keep

him in jail!  And you knew that all

the goddamn time!

MIKE

(searching for her)

Claire...?

MIKE

What are you doing?

CLAIRE

You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for

a walk in the park.

MIKE

Claire, will you calm down?

CLAIRE

I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal

human being.  I'm going for a walk

in the park.

MIKE

Claire...!

CUT TO:

MIKE

Stop, will you?!

CLAIRE

(struggling)

Let go!

MIKE

Stop being nuts!

CLAIRE

(hysterical)

I trusted you!  I thought you cared

about me?!

MIKE

I do care about you!

CLAIRE

More bullshit!  More bullshit!

(struggling)

What kind of odds are they giving

me?  There must be some kind of

office pool.  One month?  A couple

of days?

MIKE

(handling her close)

Easy... easy... I'm not gonna leave

you alone like this...

MIKE

I'm not gonna let anything happen to

you...

CUT TO:

TOMMY

(hushed)

There's somebody outside...

CUT TO:

T.J.

We're gonna need snow boots.

CUT TO:

SCOTTY

Calm down, everything is okay.

Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably

one of those peepers who've been

making this neighborhood such a

pleasure...

SCOTTY

We all look like hell.

BROOKLYN

(rising)

Well, there you are...

(to Ellie,

unconcerned)

I'll come 'round in the car from

time to time so you can get some

sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled.

BROOKLYN

Thanks for the coffee.

ELLIE

(to both)

Thanks.  You're terrific.

ELLIE

(sheepishly)

I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises...

the detective's wife...

MIKE

(tensely)

I want you and Tommy to stay with my

mother.

ELLIE

Don't be ridiculous... That's all I

need, rubbing up against your mother

and grandmother every day... I can

take care of myself...

(gently, to him)

C'mon, let's go to bed... we all

need some sleep...

CUT TO:

ELLIE

C'mon, don't make an issue of it.

Do you want the fucking meatloaf or

not?

MIKE

D'you have to say "fucking" every

other word?

ELLIE

What was that?

MIKE

You heard me.

ELLIE

Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding

you a line of crap.

MIKE

What're you talking about --

ELLIE

I'm talking about I've been talking

this way for sixteen years and now,

out of the blue, it's vulgar!

MIKE

Fuck.  What's happening?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Is everything all right?

MIKE

Yeah.

CLAIRE

They called here after you left...

MIKE

(sharply)

She's okay.  Everything's okay...

MIKE

(anguished)

I don't know you...

CLAIRE

This is me, Mike.  There's nothing

else...

MIKE

You don't wash your clothes at the

Boulevard Laundromat... you don't

pick up your kids from some crummy

public school... what is this?  A

fuckin' joke?

CLAIRE

(beat; sustaining)

Okay, then let's make it easy.  It

was a mistake.  Don't make me feel

guilty now that it's over, let's

forget about it.

CLAIRE

Don't you think I know what this is

doing.  I know you have a wife.  I

know you have a family... I'm not

asking for anything.  I don't want

anything... Just please hold me I'm

scared...

CUT TO:

T.J.

Mike...?

T.J.

Oh, man.  I don't believe you.

MIKE

(beat)

All fucked up, T.J.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ELLIE

You gotta get another tour.  We're

gettin' too old for this.

MIKE

I'm sorry.

ELLIE

I'm not saying it's your fault.

MIKE

What did you do tonight?

ELLIE

I watched TV.

MIKE

What did you watch?

ELLIE

I don't remember Michael, go to

sleep.  You don't have to make

conversation with me.

ELLIE

I'll make a reservation tomorrow for

early dinner.  You can sleep till

noon.

CUT TO:

ELLIE

Hey, we qualify for the Senior

Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did

you see Tommy today?  He misses

you...

MIKE

Well.  This'll be over soon.

Venza's such a nut job, we're bound

to pick him up soon.

ELLIE

(carefully)

I'd like you to switch to the day

shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner.

Helen insists that T.J. be home for

dinner... That's why he's on the

morning shift.

MIKE

Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and

all.

(evasive)

I'll talk to Garber about it.

ELLIE

(girds herself)

I already did.  I mean, I talked to

his wife, and she talked to him...

MIKE

(stopped)

You talked to his wife?

MIKE

My wife talks to his wife about what

shift I'm gonna take?

ELLIE

What's the difference?

ELLIE

Unless there's some particular

reason why it feels better to be

around her at night.

ELLIE

Is there, Mike?

ELLIE

What, what is it?  Is it serious or

what...?  Quit looking at me like

that!  What's with this ridiculous

silence?!

ELLIE

Goddamn.  I never thought this

would happen to me... you fuckin'

sonofabitch...

ELLIE

I just want you off the case.  Get

off it, or don't come home.

(her voice trembling)

And I want you to remember... when

we're old... that when this awful

thing happened... I behaved like a

lady.

(embittered)

The kind of "lady" you apparently

prefer.

WAITER

(approaching)

We got some specials.

MIKE

(to the waiter)

We'll be right back.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Let me drive...

ELLIE

Get away from me... get away!  She

means that much to you, you stay

with her.  But you come back, you

come back for me.  Not for Tommy,

not for your mother, or your fucking

job, but for me.

MIKE

(tortured)

El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.

(with difficulty)

And you are a lady.  I have so much

respect...

ELLIE

(through her tears;

screaming)

You fucker!  Don't tell me how much

respect you have!  You dumb mother

fucking FUCKER!  Now get off this

case or don't come home!!

CUT TO:

MIKE

Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a

huge favor from you, man.  I know

Helen doesn't like you to miss

dinner, but I need you to switch

shifts with me tonight.

(a beat)

Just "personal".  I don't know what

the hell I'm doin', I need some time

to think.

(angered)

Look, do it or don't do it, but

spare me the fuckin' lecture, all

right?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DOORMAN

I know sweetheart... we have enough

flowers here.

DOORMAN

No, no, sweetheart... not here...

get going... Okay.

VIETNAMESE GIRL

(sweetly, to Doorman)

Have a nice day.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

T.J.

Detective Keegan is... Mike...

"Michael" asked me to tell you he's

under the weather.

T.J.

He'll probably take the morning

shift.

CLAIRE

He's okay?

T.J.

Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know.

CLAIRE

Oh.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

T.J.

(fatigued)

Tell me I'm dreamin'.

MIKE

I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

MIKE

T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He

knows about us.

MIKE

(a beat; with

difficulty)

So does Ellie.

CLAIRE

You told her?

MIKE

Not exactly.

CLAIRE

What do you want to do?

MIKE

I don't know.

CLAIRE

You're tired.

(smiles, gently)

Let me watch over you tonight...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

Put it down!

(beat)

Think about it!

MIKE

(entering, to Claire)

Get on the floor!  There may be

more!

MIKE

(desperate)

T.J.!

MIKE

(sobs)

T.J...!

MIKE

Live, T.J.  Please...!

MIKE

(to her)

Get security on the phone!

Emergency!

MIKE

(his voice cracking)

Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a

heartbeat...!

CUT TO:

MIKE

(softly)

They're operating on him.  He's

still alive.

GARBER

(grim)

I heard.

GARBER

I heard a lot... Anything you want

to deny, Mike?

MIKE

(almost inaudibly)

It should've been me...

GARBER

Then it would've been her, too.

(beat)

I don't know... but I gotta protect

the Precinct, too.  You're on

suspension, pending Disciplinary

Hearings.  Don't hold your breath.

And you're not to go near that woman

until she's no longer under Police

protection and this case is closed.

GARBER

Is it "love," Mike?  I hope so.  I

want it to be worth it, for your

sake.

ELLIE

I'm going to visit my sister for a

few days.  I'd like you to get your

stuff out.

MIKE

What about Tommy?

ELLIE

He'll live through it.  They all

live through it.

(bitter)

What a world, huh?

ELLIE

Was it Venza?  Did you get him?

MIKE

No.

ELLIE

(her voice giving

out)

What a shame.

CUT TO:

SCOTTY

You see a couple of the parties that

go on at this place, you'll realize

that marriage is an institution

whose time has come and gone.

SCOTTY

Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays,

and every other weekend.  And know

what?  Our relationship's never been

better.

SCOTTY

Make it home, Mike...

CUT TO:

NEIL

(frustrated)

I'm no saint, Claire, but I do love

you.  I can understand the pressure

of the circumstances... but what

about when it's over?  Are you going

to feel the same way about him?  Is

he going to move in here and do

shift work at the 21st if they'll

have him back.  Think this through

Claire.

(with feeling)

This is the rest of your life we're

talking about.

CLAIRE

I have thought it through, Neil.

NEIL

Call me if anything changes.  I love

you, Claire.

CUT TO:

KOONTZ

Unbelievable, man, the fuckin'

jogger... they found him in Atlantic

City, totally drugged out and still

jogging...

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Hello?

(relieved)

Mike.  Where have you been?

CUT TO:

MIKE

You don't want to know.

CLAIRE (V.O.)

Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to

reach you at the precinct.

MIKE

I've moved into Scotty's... Good

news about T.J., though.  Looks like

that tough son of a gun is gonna

pull through.

CLAIRE (V.O.)

Oh God, that's great!

MIKE

(gently)

Are you okay?

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

(trying to brighten)

Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you

with quite an entourage.  It's a

regular "marching band".  You should

see me on the street, you'd think I

was the First Lady --

CLAIRE

I'm taking them all out to Queens,

as a matter of fact, right in your

neighborhood.  There's an event at

my Father's school... an

anniversary... I thought maybe you

could come...

MIKE (V.O.)

Oh that thing in Queens.

CLAIRE

(faltering)

I'm going away after that, the next

morning.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Where?

CLAIRE (V.O.)

Pretty far.  I'm told not to say

anything about it on the phone, in

case it's tapped... they think it's

best, safer, if I go away, at least

till Venza's found.

MIKE

When can I see you?

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

I don't know.  Garber's left orders

here not to let you in the building.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in

Queens.

CUT TO:

CLAIRE

Tomorrow night.  Can you come?

MIKE (V.O.)

(torn)

I don't know.  It wouldn't be very

smart.

CLAIRE

Listen, you're right.  Don't do it.

I'll just... send you an address,

okay?

MIKE (V.O.)

Claire...

CLAIRE

No really, it's okay, I've gotta go.

I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be

fine, really.

MIKE (V.O.)

I'll think about Wednesday.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Tommy!

MIKE

How are things going, pal?

TOMMY

Okay, I guess.

MIKE

How about dinner tonight?

TOMMY

(evasive)

Mom and I got plans.

MIKE

What "plans?"  You and Mom got

"plans?"

TOMMY

(after a long pause)

She's taking singing lessons.

MIKE

(incredulous)

She's what?

TOMMY

She met some friend of Aunt Millie's

who works for a record company.  He

thinks she's got a great voice.

MIKE

(outraged)

What!  What kind of pathetic line is

that?

TOMMY

(pointing)

We're gonna pass the street.

TOMMY

You coming in?

MIKE

No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd

rather go to a "singing lesson" than

have dinner with your father...

TOMMY

We're not going to a singing lesson,

she's just gonna start taking

singing lessons.

MIKE

So, what are you doing tonight?

TOMMY

Shooting.

MIKE

Shooting?

TOMMY

Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to

being alone in this neighborhood.

(a long beat;

observing his

father)

'Bye, Dad.

MIKE

Tommy!

(a parting shot)

The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't

sing.

TOMMY

(turning back,

smiling)

I don't think she can sing, either.

MIKE

Take care, pal.

CUT TO:

TOMMY

Aren't you supposed to aim at the

head?

CUT TO:

TOMMY

(thoughtful)

Mom, what's going to happen with you

and Dad?

ELLIE

I don't know Tommy.

TOMMY

Hey, can we go to McDonald's?

ELLIE

Absolutely.

CUT TO:

GIDDINGS

Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary

that you came.

CLAIRE

It was something my father always

liked me to do.

GIDDINGS

(apprehensive)

You're planning to speak?

CLAIRE

Not if you don't want me to.

GIDDINGS

(a brief hesitation)

Well, of course, we'd be...

honored...

CLAIRE

(understands; gamely)

Just putting in an appearance then.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

KOONTZ

(as he passes)

Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but

you're out of your mind.

CLAIRE

(overwhelmed)

What a memory.

MIKE

Do you dance?

CLAIRE

Do you?

MIKE

Pretty bad.

CLAIRE

Let's do it.

MIKE

They guys treatin' you all right?

CLAIRE

(too emotional to

really talk)

Yeah.

MIKE

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

CLAIRE

(a pause)

I know.

MIKE

It wouldn't work.

CLAIRE

I know.

MIKE

I'd miss my life...

CLAIRE

... Don't explain.

MIKE

How long you going away for?

CLAIRE

Long enough.

MIKE

"For"...?

CLAIRE

"To"... Forget about you.

CLAIRE

I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.

MIKE

(choked up)

Yeah...

KOONTZ

Brook's patching a call through to

you.  He thought he'd find you here.

It sounds urgent.

KOONTZ

He says it's your son.

CUT TO:

KOONTZ

(pointing)

The office down the hall.

CUT TO:

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #2

He's crying.

MIKE

(grabbing the phone)

Tommy?  What...?

(frightened)

What?!  Hello?

(listening; stunned)

Who is this?

(trying to be calm)

Yeah.  I'm listening.

(quick)

No.  Nobody but me.

CUT TO:

VENZA

I'm glad you're where I expected you

to be, Detective Keegan, 'cause

you're got two minutes to get home

or I take your family out.

CUT TO:

MIKE

(desperate)

I heard you.  I'll do it.  Just

don't touch them.

(a beat)

I...

(a pause)

Lemme talk to my son.

(suddenly)

Hello?

MIKE

(stunned)

They got my family.

(to Koontz)

I need you guys.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1

Who...

MIKE

Venza.

MIKE

At my house...!

KOONTZ

(shouting to others)

Call a cruiser!

CLAIRE

... Mike.

MIKE

(to Claire)

It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for

Ellie and Tommy.

KOONTZ

(to Claire)

Let's go.

(to others; urgent)

We're takin' her home!

(swinging into

crisis mode)

Move it!  Get the cars!

MIKE

(pleading)

Koontz!  I need you guys!

KOONTZ

We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the

locals.

(re: another cops's

radio)

Throw it!

MIKE

(pleading)

No, I need'm now!

CLAIRE

(to Koontz)

Go with him!

KOONTZ

My job is to protect you!

(into radio)

This is Koontz --

MIKE

(near hysteria)

No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it

up!  He told me not to tell anybody,

to bring Claire and come alone!  He

won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes

away!  Koontz, please!

KOONTZ

I can't do it, you know that... He's

not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No

way is he gonna let anybody walk out

of that house alive, who can finger

him.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1

(calling after her)

Hey...!

CLAIRE

Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make

them come with you!

MIKE

They can't, they're assigned to

you!  I'd do the same thing!

KOONTZ

(re: Claire)

Go get her.

KOONTZ

(reconsidering)

Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us.

Let's go.

CUT TO:

MIKE

(into his car)

Go!  Get outta here!

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1

Hey!

MIKE

Get OUT!

CLAIRE

They're assigned to me, they'll have

to go if I come with you!

CLAIRE

(screaming)

I'm not getting out!  GO!

KOONTZ

(calling to him,

emerging)

Adams...!  C'mon, move it!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

Turn off the siren...!

MIKE

(breathless)

We get there, you get down, stay out

of sight.  Don't get near that

house.  Understand me?  Venza's not

to know you're there!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

Tommy?  Ellie...?

MIKE

(calling out)

I'm not armed!  I'm the only one in

here!  I can help you get away if

you listen to what I say!

MIKE

I'm comin' in the kitchen!  If you

fuckin' shoot me, they'll come in

here, and we're all dead!  You hear

me, Venza?!

VENZA

You made a terrible mistake, Keegan.

You didn't do what I said.

MIKE

(his voice shaking)

That's right, you're gonna do what I

say.

(desperate)

Joey.  I want to help you out of

this.

VENZA

You should'a brought the girl.

MIKE

I brought the girl.  She's outside.

VENZA

Hold it...!

MIKE

I'll prove it!

MIKE

Claire!

CLAIRE (V.O.)

Mike...?

CUT TO:

KOONTZ

(a hiss of warning)

Not another word until I tell you.

CUT TO:

VENZA

How do I know that's her?

MIKE

I'll bring her in.  You let them go,

and I'll bring her in.

VENZA

(wary)

Why should she come in?

MIKE

She trusts me.  She'll do what I

say.

VENZA

Bullshit!  Prove it.

MIKE

(calls out the

window)

Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire!

It's pitch dark in here!

(his words are

carefully chosen)

You're gonna have trouble seeing

anything, so just come in, and

straight down a long hall.  Then

stand at the door so we can see you.

We want to see your face and we

won't be able to until you get to

the kitchen door!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MIKE

I want your guarantee they'll be

turned loose when she opens the

front door.

VENZA

I get my hostage first.  No one's

turned loose until I say so.

MIKE

Let my kid go.

VENZA

I'm not lettin' no one go.

MIKE

Get that gun away from his head, or

I'll keep her from coming in!  Put

the gun on me, he can't hurt you!

He's tied up!  Put him under the

table!

VENZA

Don't you fuckin' give orders to

me...

MIKE

Put him under the table or I'll stop

her from coming in.

VENZA

(to Tommy, an order)

Under the table.

MIKE

I'll take his place, all right?  Put

the gun to my head.

ELLIE

Be careful, Tommy.

MIKE

(frantic)

Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your

step.  Come slowly.

MIKE

Watch your step!

VENZA

(rising)

What the fuck you doin'?!

MIKE

There's a skateboard in the door!

ELLIE

(to Tommy)

Stay down!

MIKE

Turn around, fuck!

ELLIE

(desperate)

Tommy...!

TOMMY

I'm all right.

MIKE

Ellie...

ELLIE

I'm all right.

KOONTZ

(emphatic)

Fuckin' miracle, man.

KOONTZ

(re: the sirens)

Told you they'd be here in a few

minutes.

CLAIRE

Everyone's all right...?

MIKE

Yeah.  It's all over.

CUT TO:

MIKE

So.

CLAIRE

So.

MIKE

You still going away?

CLAIRE

I don't know...

MIKE

You don't have to, now.

CLAIRE

I think it's probably still a good

idea.

MIKE

Yeah...

CLAIRE

(heartfelt)

I'll miss you, Mike.

MIKE

Listen, I'll... see you again.

CLAIRE

(barely able to

speak)

Say goodbye.

MIKE

I like your coat.

CLAIRE

(half-laugh, half-cry)

You have a weakness for Lady Cops.

MIKE

I do.

CLAIRE

Say goodbye, Mike.

MIKE

(thick voiced)

You take care.

MIKE

(finally)

What do you think?

(a beat)

Any chance?  There's nothin' else

I'm any good at, but this.

GARBER

(noncommittal)

Call me next week.  We'll talk about

it.

MIKE

Good police work, kiddo.

ELLIE

(re: Tommy)

He doesn't want to sleep here.

(a long beat)

Neither do I.  It's not my house

anymore.

MIKE

Me neither.

MIKE

Let's find some place to start over.

MIKE (V.O.)

(to Ellie)

What this crap about singing

lessons?

FADE OUT.

THE END
