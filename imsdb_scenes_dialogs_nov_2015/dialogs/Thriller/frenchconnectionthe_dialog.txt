THE FRENCH CONNECTION

by

ERNEST TIDYMAN and WILLIAM FRIEDKIN

2.

DOYLE

(as RUSSO passes him)

The guy in the brown coat.

3.

RUSSO

Son of a bitch!

DOYLE

What's your name, asshole?

BLACK PUSHER

Fuck you, Santa Claus!

4.

RUSSO

Your name is Willie Craven.

DOYLE

Who's your connection, Willie?

What's his name?

RUSSO

Who killed the old Jew in the

laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER

I don't...

DOYLE

Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

BLACK PUSHER

What?

DOYLE

Did you ever pick your feet in

Poughkeepsie?

BLACK PUSHER

I don't know what you're talkin'

about.

DOYLE

Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

BLACK PUSHER

No... yeah...

DOYLE

Did you ever sit on the edge of the

bed, take off your socks and stick

your fingers between your toes?

BLACK PUSHER

Man, I'm clean.

DOYLE

You made three sales to your

roaches back there.  We had to

chase you through all this shit and

you tell me you're clean?

5.

RUSSO

Who stuck up the laundromat?

DOYLE

How about that time you were

picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

RUSSO

(in pain)

You better give me the guy who got

the old Jew or you better give me

something or you're just a memory

in this town.

BLACK PUSHER

That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do

nothin'.

DOYLE

You put a shiv in my partner.  Know

what that means?  All winter I

gotta listen to him gripe about his

bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust

your ass for those three bags -

then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'

your feet in Poughkeepsie.

DOYLE

Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb

guinea.

RUSSO

How'd I know he had a knife.

DOYLE

Never trust a nigger.

RUSSO

He coulda been white.

6.

DOYLE

Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

RUSSO

Not a chance.

DOYLE

Let's popeye around the Chez for a

half hour, catch the end of the

show and a couple drinks.

RUSSO

Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE

Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you

say?

RUSSO

Drink this.

DOYLE

Whip it out.

THE FRENCH CONNECTION

7.

DOYLE

I make at least two junk connections

at that table in the corner.  The

guy is the stripe combo, I know him

too.

RUSSO

Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

DOYLE

Who is that guy?

RUSSO

Policy man in Queens.

DOYLE

What about the last of the big-time

spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO

No, you?

DOYLE

Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He

spreads it like the Russians are in

Jersey.

RUSSO

He probably sells insurance.  Owns

a chicken farm in Hackensack.

8.

DOYLE

Dig who's just come over.  The

creep on the end.

RUSSO (VO)

Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He

don't look the same without a

number across his chest.

DOYLE

Whatta you say we wait and give him

a tail?

RUSSO

Give who a tail?

DOYLE

The greaser with the blonde.

RUSSO

What for -- you wanna play Hide the

Salami with his old lady?

DOYLE

Come on -- just for fun --

9.

DOYLE

Monica?  Who's Monica?

RUSSO

(handing him a cigarette)

A and A, that's all you're

interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

DOYLE

Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us

to Little Italy.

RUSSO

I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a

bagel mine in the Bronx.

10.

DOYLE

It's a drop!

11.

DOYLE

It's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my

man is cookin'...

12.

CUT TO:

CHARNIER

En prolongeant les quais d'une

trentaine de metres on pourra

recevoir des unites d'une cargaison

de 500 tonnes.

FOREMAN MARCEL

Et combien d'hommes supplementaires?

CHARNIER

Ca fera environ 10 hommes de plus

par equipe.

MARCEL

Le Syndicat exigera un minimum de 12.

CHARNIER

Quelle importance.  Ce qui compte

pour moi c'est d'avoir un chantier

qui puisse recevoir les plus grands

bateaux du monde.

MARCEL

Dis moi vieille branche?  Comment

fais tu pour rester si jeune avec

la vie que tu menes?

CHARNIER

Quelle vie Marcel?  J'ai plus rien

foutu depuis que je suis descendu

de ces cabines.

13.

CHARNIER

Bonjour cherie.

CHARNIER

Tu sais j'ai reflechi longuement a

ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai

choisi moi-meme.  Tiens.

MARIE

Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?

CHARNIER

Si tu veux.

14.

MARIE

(opening the gift)

Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu

me gates.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je

vais te montrer moi aussi ce que

j'ai achete.

CHARNIER

Encore du sho ping!

MARIE

Regarde mon pecheur de baleine...

hiver.

CHARNIER

Avec ca tu pourras le supporter.

MARIE

Mais non, c'est pour toi.

CHARNIER

Pour moi?

MARIE

Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!

CHARNIER

Formidable!  Sans toi je

m'habillerais encore en docker.

(then, taking off coat)

Je suis passe voir Francoise.

MARIE

Comment va-t-elle?

CHARNIER

Je n'ai jamais vu tant de serenite.

Elle m'a demande de tes nouvelles

et si nous etions heureux.

15.

MARIE

Le sommes nous?

CHARNIER

(he kisses her)

Non!

CHARNIER

Ca a marche?

16.

NICOLI

Au poil.

CHARNIER

Sale boulot.

NICOLI

Il fallait le faire.

CHARNIER

Il est en retard.

NICOLI

Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de

le prendre avec nous.

CHARNIER

Une erreur!  C'est genial.  C'est

une vedette a la television.  Il

peut aller partout sans etre

soupconne... En plus il a besoin de

fric.

NICOLI

J'ai pas confiance en lui.

CHARNIER

Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait

jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler

a la television.

CHARNIER

Henri c'est gentil d'etre venu.  Je

vous presente mon associe, Pierre

Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.

DEVEREAUX

Enchante.

(they shake hands)

Alain, j'ai reflechi a votre

proposition et j'ai decide

d'accepter.

17.

RUSSO (V.O.)

Our friend's name is SALVATORE BOCA.

They call him SAL.  He's a

sweetheart.  He once was picked up

on suspicion of armed robbery.

Tried to hold up Tiffany's on Fifth

Avenue!  In broad daylight!  Could

have got two-and-a-half to five,

but they wouldn't prosecute.  Also

downtown they're sure he pulled off

a contract on a guy named DeMarco.

DOYLE (V.O.)

His old lady?

18.

RUSSO (V.O.)

Her name's Angie... Fast filly...

she drew a suspended for shoplifting

a year ago... only a kid, nineteen

according to the marriage license.

DOYLE (V.O.)

Yeah, nineteen goin' on fifty.

What else?

RUSSO (V.O.)

He's had the store a year an'a

half... takes in a fast seven grand

a year.

DOYLE (V.O.)

So what's he doin' with two cars

and hundred dollar tabs at the Chez?

RUSSO (V.O.)

The Merc's in his wife's name.

Dodge belongs to his brother.

RUSSO (V.O.)

Lou... he's a trainee at the

Sanitation School on Ward's Island.

Served time a couple of years ago,

on assault and robbery raps.

19.

DOYLE

If that's not a drop or a pickup,

I'll open a charge for you at

Bloomingdale's.

RUSSO

Make it Alexander's, I like the toy

department.

DOYLE

Toy wit' this will ya.

RUSSO

There's about a hundred years'

parole time in there night or day.

DOYLE

They treat our boy like a king.

Wonder why he don't bring his old

lady?

RUSSO

There's your answer...

DOYLE

Who's the greaser?

RUSSO

It's his father.

20.

DOYLE

I think we oughta burn him on

suspicion.

RUSSO

Suspicion of what?

DOYLE

Makin' wine in the basement.

(pause)

He looks like that wop stooge used

to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

RUSSO

Lay off with that wop stuff, will

you?

DOYLE

That's the third time he come here

this week.  You got anything on the

building?

RUSSO

The building's clean.  I checked

the tenant list -- Don Ameche, the

actor lives there -- oh, and

somebody else.  Do the name Joel

Weinstock ring a bell?

DOYLE

You're kiddin'

RUSSO

No sir -- this is where Joel lives.

DOYLE

He was the bank on that shipment

outta Mexico three years ago.

21.

RUSSO

So I've heard.

DOYLE

Whatta you know -- he's takin' his

wife out for a change.

DOYLE

(at leather printing machine)

Got a job for me when this is over,

Mrs. Levene?

MRS. LEVENE

What are you fellows looking for?

What do you want from that nice

candy store?

DOYLE

We have reason to believe it's a

front for the biggest counterfeiting

operation in the country.

MRS. LEVENE

What?

DOYLE

That's right.  They're trying to

steal the formula for Hershey

bars --

22.

DOYLE

What the hell am I drivin' for?

I'm a first grade Detective.

You're a second grade guinea.

RUSSO

I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

DOYLE

(at the wheel)

What?

RUSSO

He's goin' to Ward's Island.  We'll

get spotted.  What the hell's he

goin' there?

DOYLE

Maybe he's goin' to see his brother.

DOYLE

Or could be another drop.  I guess

he gets a free ride.

23.

DOYLE

Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

DOYLE

What's my name?

1ST MAN

Doyle.

DOYLE

What?

1ST MAN

Mr. Doyle.

DOYLE

Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

1ST MAN

What?

24.

DOYLE

Milk shake anyone?

DOYLE

Move ass when I tell you.

DOYLE

Put it on the bar.

DOYLE

(collecting the works)

All right, you three clowns step

into those phone booths, you're

goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there

till I'm ready for you.

DOYLE

Everybody goes when the whistle

blows.

RUSSO

What's your story?

DANCER

Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in

show business.

25.

RUSSO

You're in show business.

DANCER

S'right.

DOYLE

What do you do in show business?

DANCER

I'm a dancer.

RUSSO

All right, get up on that bar and

dance.

DANCER

What?

RUSSO

Get up on the bar and show me how

you work.  If I like it you don't

have to go in.

DANCER

You're for real?

JERRY LEON

Hey man, why don't you let the

fella alone.

RUSSO

(a shout)

Am I talkin' to you -

JERRY LEON

No, but I'm talkin' to you.

RUSSO

I'm tellin' you to shut up and

stand over there.

RUSSO

(to Dancer)

Get up there.

DANCER

I got no music!

RUSSO

Fake it.

26.

DOYLE

All right, that's enough, you're

under arrest.

DOYLE

What about you?  Can you stand a

toss?

2ND MAN

I'm clean.

DOYLE

You don't use shit?

2ND MAN

No.

(he goes for his wallet)

DOYLE

Did I say you could move that

hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?

2ND MAN

No - no.

DOYLE

Cause if I do.

DOYLE

Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else

you got.

(to RUSSO)

- Buddy!

27.

RUSSO

If I see any shit on the floor,

it's yours, so keep your eye on

your neighbor.

DOYLE

How's everything?

2ND MAN

Everything is everything.

DOYLE

How come there's nothing out there?

That stuff is all milk.

2ND MAN

There's nothing around.  Nobody's

holding.

DOYLE

I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

2ND MAN

Boca?

DOYLE

B.O.C.A.

2ND MAN

Doesn't register.

DOYLE

Got a wife named Angie.

2ND MAN

No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

DOYLE

What?

2ND MAN

Coming in this week, week after.

Everybody going to get well.

DOYLE

Who brings it?

28.

2ND MAN

Who knows?

DOYLE

Where do you want it?

2ND MAN

This side.

DOYLE

I'm goin' check on this address in

the Bronx, if you're bullshitting

me, it's your ass.

RUSSO

Tell everybody we'll be back in an

hour.

DOYLE

(to all)

We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

REPORTER 1

How long will you be here?

DEVEREAUX

Not long enough.  Two... perhaps

three... weeks at most.

GIRL TV REPORTER

Why did you come by ship, Mr.

Devereaux?

29.

DEVEREAUX

The next several weeks will be very

difficult and the middle of the

ocean is the only place where the

telephone isn't ringing all the time.

REPORTER

What will be the viewpoint of your

documentary.

DEVEREAUX

To make a Frenchman feel what it is

like to be a New Yorker.

LA VALLE

That's enough now, ladies and

gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at

his hotel in half an hour.

SIMONSON

(with coffee cup)

All that is great -- but you guys

work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed

to be in Ridgewood.

30.

DOYLE

Detach us.  Let us have a shot at

it, at least until we see if

there's anything here or not.

Everybody wants Weinstock, right?

So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve

it.

SIMONSON

You couldn't burn a three-time

loser with what you're bringing in

here.  You know you stiffs could

run yourselves an entrapment rap.

The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn

is full of Candy Store guys with

two cars who like to go to

nightclubs.

RUSSO

Put this little candy hustler

together with Joel Weinstock and it

could be we stumbled into a big

score.

SIMONSON

(moves to window)

Big score!  He's dealin' a few bags

here and there on the side.

DOYLE

Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing

on your coffee break if I thought

he was a nickel and dimer.

SIMONSON

Your hunches have backfired before,

Doyle.

SIMONSON

(moves back to stand

at desk)

Jimmy, what the hell's happening

with you lately?

(pause)

You got more collars than any Narc

in the bureau.  What was it.  Over

100 last year?  Terrific.  But who?

(MORE)

31.

SIMONSON (CONT'D)

You stop and shake down a bellboy

because he's got three joints in

his sock.  You hit a high school

kid in short pants who looks like

he's got a twitch.

RUSSO

(moves in to desk)

We got information that there's no

shit in the street -- it's like a

desert full of junkies with a big

score coming in to make everybody

well.

DOYLE

This could be it, Walter.  This

Candy Store guy, putting on a big

show in a fancy nightclub with

known connections all over him.

Then on our own, after working the

whole day and night, we tail him

out to Brooklyn and sit on him for

a week practically, and who do we

come up with?  Joel Weinstock.

(he leans forward)

You gotta let us have it.

SIMONSON

(pause, he turns to RUSSO)

You really believe all this crap?

RUSSO

I go with my partner.

SIMONSON

What'll it take?

RUSSO

First a wire.

DOYLE

Two wires.  One on the store and

one on his house.

32.

SIMONSON

You know I have to get a court

order for wiretaps.

RUSSO

Try... okay?

DOYLE

We know you can do it, Walter.

SIMONSON

Popeye...

SIMONSON

You still pickin' your feet in

Poughkeepsie?

33.

SAL (V.O.)                     RUSSO

What's this crap.  I just          (He raps on table

spoke to my wife and she           with a coffee cup.

says you're raisin' me a           Doyle gets up.)

halfa cent on the cups.        C'mere and lissen to your

big connection.

WHOLESALER                (DOYLE comes over)

(V.O.)                He's fightin' with somebody

Yeah, well you know I          about a halfa cent.

shoulda raised this here a

long time ago.  We got a                DOYLE

inflation period...            How we gonna keep Simonson

from hearin' this?

SAL (V.O.)

I got your inflation.  I can            RUSSO

get the same cups on Delancey  If he does, we'll be back in

Street for what I been         Bed-Stuyvesant tomorrow.

payin' you for the last

year -- That's all I gotta

do with you guys -- next

time it'll be two cents on

the cones, then two cents on

the seltzer --

WHOLESALER

(V.O.)

C'mon Sal, I got my orders,

too --

SAL (V.O.)

Well, if you can't do better

than that, you can stick the

cups.

LA VALLE

There are four auto graveyards like

this one in the other boroughs,

handling about a thousand vehicles

a month.  Those that aren't claimed

are auctioned here once a month.

MARIE

Just for mistakes of parking?

34.

LA VALLE

No.  Many are involved in crimes

and confiscated... or just abandoned.

This is, as you know, your prime

source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

MARIE

(off camera)

Darling, may I have this one?

MARIE

It looks so lonesome here.

CHARNIER

It would look even more lonesome in

our garage.

AUCTIONEER

Every car sold today must be

removed at the purchaser's own

expense.  We have no keys or

anything to start the vehicles with.

You buy 'em as you see 'em and

where you see 'em.  All right, the

first car offered is Number 24398.

A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear

fifteen dollars?

AUCTIONEER

We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station

wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars?

LA VALLE

(aside to CHARNIER)

Notice he will never mention the

year of the car.

35.

AUCTIONEER

I got a fifteen dollar bid going...

Do I hear anymore...

Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen?

Twenty...

Twenty-three...

Anymore...

Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once --

Do I hear twenty-eight...

All right, last call for twenty-

five...

CHARNIER

(aside of LA VALLE)

And these are the cars we're buying

for shipment?

LA VALLE

Yes, sir.  That man in the dark

jacket is our buyer.

ANGIE (V.O.)

(sleepy)

Where are you?

SAL (V.O.)

Takin' care o' business, honey.

ANGIE (V.O.)

Takin' care o' business -- it's

after midnight.

SAL (V.O.)

You know I hadda meet some people

tonight --

36.

ANGIE (V.O.)

-- Well finish all your meetin'

people and get back here now -- and

bring a pizza with you.

SAL (V.O.)

Where'm I goinna get a pizza this

time o' night?

ANGIE (V.O.)

Well try, okay?

SAL (V.O.)

I don't know where I'm gonna find a

pizza joint open.

ANGIE (V.O.)

Sal --

SAL (V.O.)

Yeah?

ANGIE (V.O.)

Don't forget anchovies.

(she hangs up)

SAL (V.O.)

This broad's crazy!

CHARNIER (V.O.)

It's beautiful.

LA VALLE (V.O.)

It was built in 1917 - and was one

of the two heaviest bridges in the

world.  The arch is still the

largest in the world.

CHARNIER

Who financed it?

37.

LA VALLE

Two railroads as part of a

connecting railway which provided

passage from New England to the

South.  It was actually the first

railroad through New York City.

MARIE

Why is it called Hellgate?

LA VALLE

The river at this point is the most

dangerous on the East Coast.  Years

ago, hundreds of ships went down

here.

CHARNIER

If this bridge were in Europe, it

would be on every tourist's sight-

seeing list.

LA VALLE

Most New Yorkers never notice it -

most Americans have never heard of

it.

CHARNIER

Look how gracefully they conceived

that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It

was built from both ends.  With no

support in the middle.  Beautiful.

LA VALLE

Mmm.

MARIE

Alain is the only man I know who

can become as enthusiastic about a

bridge as he can about a woman.

CHARNIER

Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

38.

LA VALLE

I'm afraid the rest of Ward's

Island isn't nearly as romantic - a

pollution plant, a hospital, a

training school for garbage men and

that area over there, where the old

cars are kept, prior to being

processed for shipment to, among

other places, The Charnier Shipping

Company, of Marseilles, France.

MARIE

What is that old building?

LA VALLE

Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

MARIE

What was it?

LA VALLE

It was a crematorium.

MARIE

For garbage?

LA VALLE

For dead bodies.

CHARNIER (V.O.)

Allo... Salvatore...

SAL (V.O.)

Who's this --

CHARNIER (V.O.)

... Salvatore?...

39.

SAL (V.O.)                     RUSSO

... Oh... yes... yeah...       Who is it?

hello... this is Sal... How

are ya?                                 DOYLE

Sounds like a foreigner...

CHARNIER (V.O.)

Very well... you meet me                RUSSO

Wednesday at the hotel...          (listening at the

Okay?                              other phone)

French... It's a Frenchman...

SAL (V.O.)

Good... good... great!                  DOYLE

This is what we been waitin'

CHARNIER (V.O.)       for -- the stuff is here!

Will I expect you?             It's here!

SAL (V.O.)

What time?

CHARNIER (V.O.)

Twelve o'clock... yes...

SAL (V.O.)

Yes --

40.

WHIP GIRL

You're Fifty Dollars short.

WHIP GIRL

M'sieru - the tab for this scene is

a hundred and a half.

(he moves to door)

Hey Frenchie - if you don't come up

with the scratch, you're gonna run

into my man downstairs.

WHIP GIRL

Don't hit me.  Don't.  Please.

WHIP GIRL

You filthy faggot sonofabitch.

DEVEREAUX

This is the new American religion,

professional football.  It is where

everybody goes instead of church on

Sunday to express that peculiar

American taste for bloodshed and

violence.

41.

DEVEREAUX

These men, playing a "game" - make

more money each year than many

important business leaders, artists

or government officials.

(zoom out)

It tells us something about this

country and how its men live, or go

to war with a smile, and sometimes

die without a cause.

EDITOR

It's for you - Alain Charnier.

JESUS

Hey, Bo.

DOYLE

Hiya, Jesus.

JESUS

Can you use a new suit for

Christmans?

DOYLE

Whatta you got?

JESUS

Whatta you?... a 44... 46?

42.

DOYLE

Where'd you get this fag shit?

JESUS

This is what the tough guys are

wearin'.  You know I only steal

from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.

DOYLE

Pass.

JESUS

Forty dollars -- was $250.

DOYLE

Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and

burned.

MUTCHIE

A big man could alluz beat a little

man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain

could murder Jim Brown if they ever

fought.

BAD EDDIE

No chance.  Brown'd kill him.

MUTCHIE

Chamberlain's seven foot tall,

right?  He's got a twelve-foot

reach.  It's geophysics.  He's

punchin' down on you with leverage.

He cave your chest in.

BAD EDDIE

Best I ever seen was The Rock.  He

was the calmest and the meanest.

Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before

a fight.  Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'.

Marciano was calm like he was goin'

to church.  What about the night he

fought LaStarza?  He hit him so

hard he broke the blood vessels in

LaStarza's arms.  He was the

strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

PUGGY

Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.

43.

MUTCHIE

Blackjack Burns coulds been the

greatest ever --

PUGGY

-- He was a stone tanker.

MUTCHIE

That's right, he couldn't fight

legit.  One night at the Garden

about 1950, '51 -- he fought either

Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I

think it was -- he took one o'

those cream puff punches in the

sixth -- the laziest left you ever

seen -- missed him entirely.  Down

goes Blackjack without even workin'

up a sweat and the whole Garden

gets up in its feet and I swear to

Christ, everybody starts singin'

"Dance With Me Henry."

LEE

I fought a guy in Cleveland once.

I knew he was a dirty fighter so I

stick a crowbar in my crotch.

Right here.  Second round he gives

me a shot -- Boom -- he breaks his

hand, the fight's over.

PUGGY

Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin,

that's my game.

MUTCHIE

What about you, Doyle?  Who's the

best fighter you ever seen?

DOYLE

(a few drinks behind him)

Willie Mays.

BAD EDDIE & LEE

Willie Mays?!

DOYLE

With a baseball bat!  One swing!

Knock your fuckin' head off.

44.

MUTCHIE

What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin'

from the cops?

DOYLE

I hear the health department is

going to close this joint for

selling dirty beer.  I come by to

help you carry out your money.

MUTCHIE

They'll close you down if they ever

get a look at those busted-valise

broads you run with.

DOYLE

You want some eggs.

MUTCHIE

Why not?

DOYLE

(looking around for bacon)

Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

MUTCHIE

Yeah!

DOYLE

(rattling pans,

looking around)

Where the hell is it?

MUTCHIE

Where the hell do you think it is,

potato head?

MUTCHIE

No wonder there's so many Mafia

around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto

Rican in Spanish Harlem.

45.

MUTCHIE

I got this little chick I'm tryin'

to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I

take her to Jilly's last night and

she's tellin' me about how she

wants to settle down one day, get

married... I says, "Hey, this is

1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old

man lookin' to score with some

pussy."

DOYLE

Strike out, eh?

MUTCHIE

Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya

look like a night's sleep wouldn't

kill ya.

DOYLE

A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.

MUTCHIE

When ya go back on?

DOYLE

Morning.  Sometime.

MUTCHIE

Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool

table for a couple hours.  The kid

comes in at six will wake ya.  A

couple eggs and a beer is cheaper

than keepin' a dog around the joint.

46.

DOYLE

You got a pedaller's license?

GIRL

What?

DOYLE

You're under arrest.

MULDERIG

Whatta you got -- four more years,

Walter?

SIMONSON

Three.

MULDERIG

Christ, by the time you get out all

this shit'll be legal.

SIMONSON

(rises, to RUSSO)

The judge gave you ten days on

these.  Klein and Mulderig will be

sitting in for the Federals.  Tell

Doyle they'll make all the buys,

and that they're to be kept informed

of everything that goes down.

SIMONSON

You know Doyle, don't you Bill?

47.

MULDERIG

(rises)

Sure, I know Popeye.  The Master of

undercover, whose brilliant idea of

disguise is to limp into a room on

his left foot and limp out on his

right.  Whose brilliant hunches

cost the death of a good officer --

RUSSO

If that's how you're coming in, why

not stay home and save us all a lot

of grief.

MULDERIG

That's just my opinion.

RUSSO

Whyn't you shove it up your ass!

RUSSO

Popeye.

RUSSO

Popeye.

DOYLE

(off, weakly)

Yeah.

RUSSO

It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

DOYLE

(off)

I can't.

48.

RUSSO

Why not?

DOYLE

(off)

Let yourself in.

RUSSO

(behind door)

What the hell you got holding the

door?

RUSSO

What happened to you?

DOYLE

(sleepy)

The crazy kid handcuffed me to the

bed.  With my own cuffs.

BIKE GIRL

Oh!

49.

RUSSO

(looking at scrapbook

on dresser)

You oughta get plastic covers for

this stuff like I did - your

scrapbook's a mess like everything

else in your life.

DOYLE

Gimme my pants.

DOYLE

You got the warrant?

RUSSO

(sitting)

We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil

Klein.

DOYLE

What do we need those pricks for?

RUSSO

Because by actual count our bureau

has exactly nine hundred eighteen

dollars and fifty-four cents to

make buys and Mulderig's Feds can

get all of Uncle Sam's money he

wants by just asking.

DOYLE

Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?

How good are the warrants?

RUSSO

(on the move down

hall, at bathroom door)

Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

50.

RUSSO

Hi!

RUSSO

Drive carefully!

MULDERIG

Strictly small potatoes.

MULDERIG

You really know how to pick 'em,

Doyle.

MULDERIG

Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

MULDERIG

Somebody told me the reason you did

that was so's when you met a chick

and rubbed against her she wouldn't

know you were a cop.

MULDERIG

I said that was bullshit.  It must

be some kind of fast-draw gimmick

or something.

51.

RUSSO

Knock it off, Bill.

MULDERIG

He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're

gonna lose him.

RUSSO

Phil -- it's Cloudy -- we lost

him --

RUSSO (V.O.)

He just got off the Bridge - He's

all yours if you can find him.

Sonofabitch!

52.

CHARNIER

Excuse me.

53.

RUSSO

(he is moving through

the jam they form on

the stairs)

Excuse me.

DOYLE

You take Sal.  I'll stick with the

beard if they split.

54.

55.

RUSSO

You want the red or the white?

DOYLE

Pour it in your ear.

DESK CLERK

Yes sir?

56.

DOYLE

That guy just walked in.  What's

his name?

DESK CLERK

I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

DOYLE

(showing badge)

He got off on six.

DESK CLERK

We have four rooms and six suites

on six.  There's a man in almost

every one of them.

DOYLE

Little shorter than me.  Well-

dressed.  About forty-five or fifty

with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.

DESK CLERK

There's nobody like that on six.

DESK CLERK

Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

DOYLE

No, I figure he stays here.  Where's

your registration?

DESK CLERK

There may be two... no, three who

could fit it.

DOYLE

Names.

57.

DESK CLERK

A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here

alone.

DOYLE

Where from?

DESK CLERK

Des Moines.

DOYLE

What's he do?

DESK CLERK

Businessman.  Owns a department

store in Des Moines, I think.

DESK CLERK

Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would

be another.  He's in shipping.

DOYLE

Yeh?  Who else?

DESK CLERK

And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I

don't know what he does.

DOYLE

This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

DESK CLERK

I think so.  But they're in Room

408.  On the fourth floor.

DOYLE

Where's he from?

DESK CLERK

Marseilles.

DOYLE

(gives him a dumb look)

58.

DESK CLERK

That's in France.

DOYLE

Yeah, I know.

MULDERIG

You about ready for a break?

DOYLE

The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure.

Also he made me.  Stayin' on four

but went up to six -- cute.

RUSSO

The other guy's a frog too.  Checked

in at the Edison.  Had a hooker

sent up.

MULDERIG

Christ you should o' collared him

right there.

DOYLE

Who's on him?

RUSSO

Phil Klein.

59.

DOYLE

What about Sal?

RUSSO

We put him to bed for the night.

MULDERIG

Why don't you do the same, Doyle?

You look like shit.

DOYLE

(to MULDERIG)

Look.  My partner and I found this

case and I don't want no Feds

screwing it up.

MULDERIG

Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn

thing.

DOYLE

Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off

and I'll knock you into the middle

of next week.

RUSSO

Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin'

down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's

while you can.

60.

CHEMIST

Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof!

Best I've ever seen!  If the rest

is like this, you'll be dealing for

two years on this load.

WEINSTOCK

Retail is not my end of the business.

Are you telling me it's worth the

half million?

CHEMIST

How many kilos?

SAL

Sixty.

61.

CHEMIST

Six kilos at eight big ones a

kilo...

(he nods)

I'd say it should be able to take a

seven to one hit in the street.

SAL

By the time it gets down to nickel

bags it's at least thirty-two

million!

WEINSTOCK

Thank you, Howard.  Take what's

left there with you and goodnight.

SAL

I guess we got a deal, eh?

WEINSTOCK

We got a test.  A deal for half a

million dollars, maybe.

SAL

Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He

wants the bread and he wants to go

back to France.  He ain't gonna

hang around and play games.  He's

one o' the shrewdest cats I ever

run across.

WEINSTOCK

What am I, a shmuck?  What's the

hurry?  He could see a couple of

shows and visit the top of the

Empire State Building.

SAL

Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot

o' time settin' this one up.

62.

WEINSTOCK

So whatta you want a badge?  It's

your first major league game Sal.

One thing I learned, move calmly,

move cautiously.  You'll never be

sorry.

SAL

I been damn careful up to now.

WEINSTOCK

Which is why your phone lines are

tapped and the Feds are crawlin'

all over you like flies.

SAL

I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't

got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin'

you, he'll take the deal somewhere

else.

WEINSTOCK

He could go someplace else with his

sixty kilos of heroin and see how

easy it is to pull together a half

million cash.  He wouldn't find

there was any hurry to do this kind

of business.

SAL

Look, the stuff is here.  We could

set up the switch in an hour.  I'm

tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll

split if we don't move.  This guy

is everything they say he is.

WEINSTOCK

What about you, Sal?  Are you

everything they say you are?

63.

DOYLE

You own that lamppost?

HOOKER

No.

DOYLE

Then how come you're leaning on it.

DOYLE

I ever bust you?

HOOKER

I never seen you before.

DOYLE

Get your ass in the car.

DOYLE

You gonna wait on me or am I gonna

sit here all day?

64.

DOYLE

Hey!

DOYLE

(off camera)

C'mere... C'mere!

DOYLE

Can you stand a toss, Hector?

KID

What you mean?

DOYLE

You still dealin' shit?

KID

Jesus, no, Doyle.  I'm clean.  I'm

working twelve hours a day here.

DOYLE

When they going to make you chairman

of the board?

DOYLE

You clean your fingernails with this.

KID

Rather be caught with it than

without it.

65.

DOYLE

Yeah, I guess so.

66.

67.

DOYLE

I'm sittin' on Frog One.

MULDERIG

Yeah, we got the Westbury covered

like a tent.

DOYLE

The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him

down at the subway at Times Square.

What the hell's goin' on?  I make

him coming right out of the hotel

free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

DOYLE

I don't care how many bartenders

are sick.  I don't work in that

joint.  What the hell kind of a

union are you running down there?

68.

69.

OFFICER

(to SIMONSON)

This belonged to the kid who was

drivin' the sports car.  17 years

old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the

car.  We found this set of works in

her arm.

DOYLE

(to MULDERIG)

Where the hell was the surveillance?

"Go to bed." That's all you could

say.  You couldn't keep track of a

bleeding elephant in a snowbank.

SIMONSON

Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore.

If there was a deal it must have

gone down by now.  We blew it!  We

blew our cover and we blew the

warrants --

MULDERIG

Charnier and his wife checked out

of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked

out of the Edison --

RUSSO

This fella Nicoli's got a record in

France, Walter.  He's wanted for

questioning in the murder of a

French cop.

DOYLE

I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

MULDERIG

That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in

the subway and you blew our cover.

If they haven't moved already

they're not gonna move now.

DOYLE

Walter, I can make this case if the

Feds will get the hell out of my way.

70.

MULDERIG

With pleasure -- it's all yours.

Walter, if anything develops outta

this charade give me a call.

RUSSO

(to MULDERIG)

My ass.  The only reason you're in

this is because you've got a big

expense account for buying junk and

you like to see your picture in the

papers.

DOYLE

(to SIMONSON)

This is my case.  Get these guys

off my back and let me handle it.

SIMONSON

For chrissake, will you come off

that "my case" bullshit.  This has

been a whore's dream from the start.

DOYLE

The deal hasn't gone down yet

Walter -- I know it, I can feel it.

MULDERIG

The last time you were dead certain

we ended up with a dead cop.

SIMONSON

(roaring)

That's enough.  Get the hell out of

here.

71.

SIMONSON

(on way up hill,

turning back)

Jimmy, you wasted two months - no

collars are comin' in while you two

been out jerkin' off.  Now go back

to work, you're off Special

Assignment.

CHARNIER

It has been highly informative and

a personal pleasure to see you again.

UNDERSECRETARY

I only hope we cut through to some

meaningful proposals in the next

month or so.  The pleasure was

mine, Mr. Charnier.  When will we

see you again?

CHARNIER

Soon, probably in the Spring.

72.

CHARNIER

Goodbye.

UNDERSECRETARY

(off camera)

Goodbye.  Good trip home.

SAL

Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I

will need a few more days though,

the boys think we oughta cool it

for awhile -- make sure there's no

heat.

CHARNIER

(manner outwardly pleasant)

You must take me for an imbecile.

Why do you think I asked you to

meet me in Washington?  I haven't

spent five minutes in New York City

without the company of a gendarme.

SAL

Look, I'll level with you -- I need

a little more time -- I got to

shift gears.

CHARNIER

Are you having trouble raising the

half million?

SAL

Hell no -- my end is covered -- my

associates just feel we ought to

wait for a more opportune time to

make the switch.

73.

CHARNIER

It has to be by the end of this week.

SAL

Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be

reasonable.

CHARNIER

It's your problem.

SAL

It's yours too!

CHARNIER

So nice to have seen you again.

MARIE

Look, darling, they sell these at

the Smithsonian.

CHARNIER

Are you sure it is dead?

MARIE

I'm going to put them on the cat.

CHARNIER

That's a relief.

74.

CHARNIER

You did find something for yourself,

of course.

MARIE

Of course.  But I am not going to

tell you what it is until we are

back in Marseilles.

CHARNIER

Excuse me a moment, darling.

CHARNIER

I'm afraid they've become a bit...

over-cautious.  Our American friends.

NICOLI

What happens to the schedule?

CHARNIER

We must follow it.

NICOLI

But will they?

CHARNIER

I don't know.  Boca is scared.

He's not strong enough.  He sees

policemen in his soup.

NICOLI

He is not wrong.

CHARNIER

Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed

me on the subway, he's the eager one.

75.

NICOLI

Let me take him out.

CHARNIER

There'll be someone else.

NICOLI

What difference does it make?

We'll be out of the country Friday.

DOYLE

(yelling)

Everybody, down!  Get down on the

ground!

DOYLE

Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down!

76.

DOYLE

Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the

police!

77.

DOYLE

Where's the next stop?  Going into

the city?

TOKEN ATTENDANT

(glancing out in

direction the train

was hurtling)

25th Avenue.

DOYLE

Police!

DRIVER

What the hell?

DOYLE

(diving behind the wheel)

Police!  Emergency!

78.

TRUCK DRIVER

Blind sonofabitch!

NICOLI

Don't stop!  Continue on to the

next station!

MOTORMAN

I got to stop.

NICOLI

Touch the brake and I'll blow you

in half.

MOTORMAN

The signal lights are automatic.

If I go through a red I'll be

automatically braked.

79.

VOICES

Didn't stop.

Went right through there...

Hey, man, that's my station...

Where the hell's he going?

Hey, stop the car...

VOICES

He's got a gun...

The motorman's gone crazy...

Oh my God!

NICOLI

Get back.

CONDUCTOR

Hey, you can't...

80.

MOTORMAN

(gasping)

I can't breathe.

VOICES

We'll crash.

Won't somebody please help me.

Murder

He's a killer.

Crash.  We'll crash!

Stop.  Stop the train.

81.

82.

RUSSO

Hey, Mac, have you seen...?

RUSSO

...the guy who runs this joint?

SAL

Yeh.  He's over getting my car.

83.

ATTENDANT

Can I help you...?

RUSSO

He's in the brown Lincoln - foreign

plates.

DOYLE

Timezit?

RUSSO

Four.

84.

DOYLE

(softly)

Same car.

RUSSO

Third time around.

DOYLE

(to car radio)

Let's him 'em.

VOICES

Police!  Don't move... get you...

hands up... you're under arrest...

85.

DOYLE

Up!  Up, you sonofabitch!

DOYLE

Of all the goddam cars they had to

pick to steal hubcaps.

DOYLE

(looking up and around)

A bunch of lousy little spic car

thieves.

MULDERIG

Nothing in there except a New York

street map.

DOYLE

Tumble it.  One end to the other.

86.

MECHANIC

Nobody's been under there with

anything but a grease gun since if

came off the line.

DOYLE

I don't buy it.  The stuff is on

this car.

MECHANIC

Then you find it.  I can't.

LA VALLE

The car was lost sometime this

evening.  First they send us to

Pier One -- then they send us

here --

DESK SERGEANT

I don't understand why you had it

parked on the waterfront.  You're

staying at the Doral and you lose

your car somewhere out by the

Brooklyn Bridge.

LA VALLE

In point of fact, M. Devereaux is

scouting locations for a film for

French Television.  He left the car

to look at some point of interest.

DEVEREAUX

(moving, excitable)

We were told by the Police

Commissioner's office that the car

was brought to this garage.  I

demand its immediate return.

87.

DESK SERGEANT

If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.

DEVEREAUX

(moving)

I have been patient enough.  There

is no reason I should have to waste

time with this red tape.

LA VALLE

Mr. Devereaux is an extremely

important guest of this country.

He is working with the absolute

cooperation and participation of

your government.  Here are his

credentials from the French

Consulate.

(showing them)

Unless you wish to see this episode

portrayed in his film I suggest you

locate his car immediately.

MECHANIC

What are you looking for?  Is it as

big as an orange or an elephant's

ass?  I've been over every inch --

top to bottom.  If you could give

me a club -- to the size...

RUSSO

(doing rough figures

on a piece of scratch paper)

What was the weight of the car when

you got it, Irv?

MECHANIC

(consulting his notes)

4,839 pounds.

RUSSO

(consulting Lincoln

Specification Book)

You're sure?

(he does quick addition)

The manufacturer's spec says it

should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This

one's carrying roughly 120 extra

pounds somewhere.

88.

RUSSO

When it was booked in at Marseilles

it weighed the same.  120 pounds

overweight.  Jimmy has to be right.

MECHANIC

I ripped everything out except the

Rocker panels.

DEVEREAUX

What's that?

RUSSO

Got it for you, Randy -- it just

came in from downtown.  Who's

Devereaux?

LA VALLE

This is M. Devereaux.

RUSSO

I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we

get reports on a couple hundred

vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a

little tough to keep track.

DEVEREAUX

You mean the car's here now?

RUSSO

Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not

even a scratch.  You're all set.

(handing DEVEREAUX keys)

89.

RUSSO

Someone stole it right off the

street, huh?  You're gonna have to

pay the tow away charge.

DEVEREAUX

I was told these things happen in

New York -- but one never expects it.

RUSSO

Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape.

You must lead a charming life.

CHARNIER

Henri...

CHARNIER

Did you pick up the car?

DEVEREAUX

It is waiting for you in the garage.

CHARNIER

Did they follow you?

DEVEREAUX

I wasn't looking.

CHARNIER

Henri... I need one more favor from

you.  I know I am imposing...

DEVEREAUX

My friend, I am not sure about what

is going on -- but for me, I am

finished.

CHARNIER

Not quite -- you are in it whether

you like it or not.  The police

know you brought the car into the

country.  This makes you an

accomplice.

90.

DEVEREAUX

An accomplice to what?!  What have

you gotten me into, Alain?  You

asked me to do you a favor -- and I

did what you asked -- but you've

taken advantage of me.  I have my

reputation --

CHARNIER

Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust

me -- this is an extremely

complicated situation to which

there is a simple solution if you

do exactly what I tell you.  It's

worth more money to you.

DEVEREAUX

Goodbye.

91.

BOCA

Keep going.  Right in there.

FIRST MECHANIC

Over there.  On the right.

SECOND MECHANIC

The clear spot.

92.

SAL

(shouting)

Bulls!

93.

RUSSO

Phil, you take that side, Bill, go

around the other way.

RUSSO

Jimmy?

RUSSO

Jimmy?

94.

DOYLE

(a whisper)

Cover the other side -- Frog Number

One is down there.

RUSSO

(leaning over the body)

He's gone, Jimmy.  Bill is dead.

DOYLE

The sonofabitch is in here somewhere.

I saw him -- I'm gonna get him.

THE END
