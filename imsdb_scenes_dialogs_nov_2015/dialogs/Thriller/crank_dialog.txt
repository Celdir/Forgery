FADE IN:

VIDEO SCREEN

1

EXTREME CU: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a yellow

ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it's lo-res glory.

The camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor,

gobbling dots.

EXTREME CU: A RED GHOST follows, in hot pursuit.

CUT TO:

EXTREME CU: PACMAN gives it the slip, cuts down and gobbles a

big dot.

CUT TO:

EXTREME CU: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST, changes

direction and runs. PACMAN chases ...

P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms

back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely

escapes.

CUT TO:

PACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another

ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to

reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes

E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original

on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in.

The sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ...

CUT TO BLACK.

SOUND: A HEART BEATS SLOWLY IN THE DARK.

FADE IN:

INT CHEV'S BEDROOM, MORNING                                        2

This scene plays out as a continuous POV shot, right up

until CHEV's face is revealed for the first time.)

CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL

PHONE, groggy, vision doubled ...

feel right, don't want to move right.

(CONTINUED)

2.

CONTINUED:

The CELL PHONE, coming from some other room, plays the PACMAN

theme in beeps: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM ...

He tries to get out of bed, HITS THE GROUND. Plush rug,

ultra modern bed frame, night stand, high tech stereo, the

works.

He crawls/stumbles into ...

INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS

... the living room, decked out by Kostabi paintings and

glass furniture then into...

INT CHELIOS KITCHEN, CONTINUOUS                                    4

... the kitchen, with a black marble island and hanging

copper.

He jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water.

He steadies himself against the matching black marble

counter, staring at his hands ...

.. tries to lift them and BANG!    He's back on the floor,

stunned...

All the while we hear the faint sound of his HEARTBEAT...

... slow: LUBDUB... LUBDUB... LUBDUB.

He begins crawling back into...

5

INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS

... the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a

plain black VHS tape propped up in front of a plasma screen

TV with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like

a present.

CHELIOS

(barely comprehensible)

Whathufuck?

He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the

VCR and pushes PLAY.

INT.   TV SCREEN

It's RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young, irritatingly slick

EASTERN EURO ... little to no accent - fast talking,

sarcastic, a complete dick ...

(CONTINUED)

3.

CONTINUED:

We see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the

frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight

filters in through the blinds.   There are HOODS loitering

around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before.

(

The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally

increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue -

the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.)

VERONA

What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd

give you the heads up. You're dead.

On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA.

VERONA (CONT'D)

Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ...

if you're watching this tape it means

that I somehow resisted the urge to

dismember you and shove the pieces down

the garbage disposal ... opting instead

to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you

heard me...

We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around

the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND

FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.

VERONA (CONT'D)

... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep.

How sick is that?... for the satisfaction

of watching you squirm out your last

minutes knowing it was me that did it to

you, and there's nothing you can do about

it...

Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5

on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still

don't see his face clearly.

VERONA (CONT'D)

... that's right, you're on candid

camera, try not to embarrass yourself...

Cut back to CHEV'S POV. He holds his head down over the               5

carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, GAGGING.

VERONA (CONT'D)

Let me guess, you're trying to puke the

shit out, right? Right? Don't bother...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

4.

CONTINUED: (2)      VERONA(CONT'D)

the shit I gave you is some fucking high

tech sci-fi Chinese synthetic shit that

even I don't know exactly what the fuck

it is. All I know is once it binds with

your blood cells, you're fucked, baby...

and believe me, it's done binded. By now

you'll be feeling your joints stiffen

up... hard to breath...

CHEV puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his

heart. The BEATS of the heart grow louder still, but the

rhythm falters, begins to slow ...

VERONA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

... your heartbeat is slowing down like

there's rust in your veins... you're like

the Tin Man in the Wizard of freaking

Oz...

One of the THUGS, ALEX, contributes from offscreen.

LEX

(amused by his own wit,

singing)

"If he only had a brain."

ERONA

(irritated)

Scarecrow. Whatever. You get the point.

You're fucked. You got maybe an hour,

max, tough guy ... baby ... sexy ...

The THUGS are into it; VERONA is rolling. One of them comes

up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on CHEV'S unconscious

head.

VERONA (CONT'D)

Hey, it's been real. Probably should've

thought twice before you whacked Don Kim.

Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I

thought so. Have a nice death...

Finally the CAMERA reverses to reveal CHEV'S slack-jawed          6

face, staring at the TV. CHEV is in his late 20s, handsome

in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the

HEARTBEAT, the CELL PHONE - cuts to dead silence... and

through the silence, a SINGLE WORD:

VERONA (CONT'D)

... asshole.

(A driving SOUNDTRACK kicks in.   The OPENING TITLES play over

the following:)

(CONTINUED)

5.

CONTINUED: (3)

Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips

the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF

THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with

a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.

He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on

it and heads out of the room.

ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the

apartment and down the hall.

By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it:

his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just

as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door

and is out.

INT CHEV'S APARTMENT BUILDING, CONTINUOUS

ROLLER DOLLY stays with him through the door and down the

hall, as a businesswoman peaks her head out the door - then

SLAMS IT SHUT, terrified - and then down the stairs to the

garage door.

INT CHEV'S APARTMENT BUILDING, GARAGE, CONTINUOUS

ROLLER DOLLY still on CHEV. He jumps up on the hood of a

moving RED SPORTSCAR as it backs out of it's parking spot,

walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock

button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI

pops open ... he gets in.

RED SPORTSCAR GUY is the sort of classic intolerable LA

ASSHOLE we love to hate: platinum hair, suspenders, designer

shades, programming his Blackberry while driving, etc.

SPORTSCAR GUY

This is a eighty thousand dollar ride,

cockwipe!

CHEV backs out, runs him right over. CH-KUNK, CH-KUNK.

CHEV'S AUDI blasts out of the garage and down the street.

SPORTSCAR GUY holds his backwards leg in agony.

SPORTSCAR GUY (CONT'D)

(screaming like a girl)

You're a dead man!

CUT TO:

INT CHEV'S AUDI, MOMENTS LATER

The ever-present HEARTBEAT is pounding.     CHEV whips out his

cell phone and dials. A HORN BLASTS.

(CONTINUED)

6.

CONTINUED:

CHEV quickly looks up and yanks his steering wheel to swerve

around oncoming traffic.

CHEV

JESUS!

The CAMERA ZOOMS in on CHEV'S CHEST: it becomes JUST SLIGHTLY

TRANSPARENT... we see the movement of his beating HEART SPEED

UP with the near miss.

he HEARTBEAT SOUND is amplified as we MOVE IN CLOSER.

CUT TO:

INT EVE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS

We see an old school tape answering machine pick up at her

place:

OMAN (V.O.)

Hey, this is Eve...

This is apparently typical - she's an answering machine girl

in a cell phone world. He holds back his frustration as the

message plays.

EVE

I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.

Can you leave me a message? Unless

you're trying to sell something, because

I'm absolutely not interested. But if

you're not ...

EXT CHEV'S AUDI, SAME TIME

CHEV begins to POUND HIS HEAD against the steering wheel.

EVE

... then just ... oh, wait ... time's up -

INT EVE'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME

SOUND: beeep!

CHEV (O.S.)

GET A CELL PHONE!!!

We hear CHEV'S car SQUEAL again...

CUT TO:

INT CHEV'S AUDI, SAME TIME

hit!

He clicks off the cell.       His eyes try to focus on the road.

OTE: Through it all, the low beating of the heart - from

slow to fast - sometimes barely audible, sometimes mixed way

out front - clues us into the state of his adrenaline.

He grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial.

CHEV (CONT'D)

Come on ...

ANSWERING SERVICE (O.S.)

Doctor Miles' office, may I help you?

CHEV

Let me talk to him.

SPLIT SCREEN WITH:

INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS

CHOCOLATE, a too-skinny, cracked-out BLACK CHICK, sits in

front of a multi-line phone in a broken down apartment.

She's wearing a headset. She takes a long drag off her

cigarette.

HOCOLATE

(a generic imitation of

politeness)

I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office

at this time, may I take -

CHEV

Where is he?

CHOCOLATE

I beg your pardon sir?

CHEV

Where - thefuck - is - he?

In more SCREENS WITHIN SCREENS we see a 'WELCOME TO LAS

VEGAS' sign, then DOCTOR MILES reclining on a massage table

with a bunch of HOOKERS.)

CHOCOLATE

I don't know sir, this is his answering

service, would you like me to have him

paged?

(CONTINUED)

CHEV

(exasperated)

Fine, yes, please let the doctor know

that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he

can't call me back within the hour... got

that?     C

HOCOLATE

Can you spell that for me sir?

CHEV

D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it?

CHOCOLATE

Yes sir...

Thank you.

HEV hangs up.

INT KAYLO'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled

back curly hair. The room is unkempt. A woman in a robe

shuffles by vaguely in the background, possibly his mother?

K

AYLO

h, what's up Chev?

CHEV (O.S.)

I said, where were you last night?

IN A SCREEN WITHIN A SCREEN WE SEE HIM DRESSING UP IN DRAG,

PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME

FREAKY CLUB, ETC.

KAYLO (O.S.)

I ... uhh ...

HEV

Yeah, yeah.     You wanna know what I was

doing?

KAYLO

What?

CHEV

GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT!

KAYLO

What?

HEV

What? What? You heard me.      That son of

a bitch Ricky Verona.

AYLO

Ricky Verona ...

CHEV

(more to himself)

Who would've thought that little bastard

had the stones to come whack me in my own

crib... it's inconceivable... and yet,

here we are.

KAYLO

Where are we?

Silence.

CONTINUED:

CHEV

I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen:

you put the word out I'm looking for

Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call

me.

KAYLO puts his hands up in the air, dumbfounded.

CHEV (CONT'D)

I'm going to get that little son of a

bitch if it's the last thing I do... it

may actually be the last thing I do,

understand that? Copy me on that?

KAYLO

Ricky Verona?

CHEV

Find him!

Arriving at his destination CHEV clicks off, simultaneously

closing KAYLO'S SCREEN IN A SCREEN, and shoves the phone into

his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk.

CUT TO:

EXT STREET, NEAR BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

run down street in Inglewood. The BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE

is a low lying pool hall/bar with a crude hand-painted sign

reading BEER POOL DARTS. Motorcycles are parked out front.

OLLER DOLLY from alongside CHEV'S car at high speed, break

off and follow inside as CHEV parks haphazardly, rushes out

and busts into the joint ...

INT. BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, CONTINUOUS

The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS

GOING. Eight or ten BROTHERS, some wearing motorcycle

leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick,

drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his

coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better

dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of

BADASSES.

efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO

ORLANDO'S FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place into

the bathroom. Everyone scatters and takes cover at the site

of the GLOK; firearms appear.

(CONTINUED)

11.

CHEV

(out of his mind)

Where's Verona!!

ORLANDO

(flipping out)

It's cool it's cool it's cool!

CHEV

Talk!!

ORLANDO

I'm talking! What are we talking about?

CHEV

Don't fuck with me!!

ORLANDO

OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm

down ...

CHEV

DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER!

BIKER (O.S.)

O-land-o! What's up!

ORLANDO

(calling back)

There's a white man with a gun in here, I

would prefer that he not cap my ass, so

please refrain from any sudden ass

bullshit!

(

to CHEV)

Now you see that? I'm trying to help you

here.

HEV starts to chill out.

CHEV

Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ...

ORLANDO

Why would I know where ... ?

(CONTINUED)

12.

CHEV

... right, I know, you don't know where

he is, but you're going to tell me where

he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS

INTO THAT TOILET!!

otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed

ORLANDO

THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS

COOL!

ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

(calmly)

Can we all just get along?   Can we?

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

Now Chevy here has something he would

like to discuss. So we are going to

discuss it. In a civilized manner.

Chevy? I believe you had a question, or

some point you were trying to make?

CHEV

Where's Verona.

ORLANDO

OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky

Verona.

CHEV

(starting to lose it again)

You pulled the Anselmo job together,

don't try to bullshit me ...

(CONTINUED)

13.

ORLANDO

Easy ... easy ... now things are

beginning to clarify ... you see how that

works? How discussion can lead to

clarity?

HEV is running out of patience.

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

Clearly you are operating under a false

pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did

not "pull the Anselmo job together." In

fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the

Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes

me seventy five hunna dollars.

CHEV

That's not how I heard it.

ORLANDO

But that's the way it is. That's the way

it is. So you see, I don't know where

Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where

he is, I would probably be there right

now, beating his Gucci ass down.

tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying

hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's

CHEV

Alright.

ORLANDO

Thank you. That's what I'm talking

about. That resembles civility.

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

Shit dude, what's the matter with you?

(CONTINUED)

14.

CHEV

Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky

Verona, that little bitch ...

ORLANDO

I understand that. You've made that

point abundantly clear to all of us.

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

Now what can I do to help you?

CHEV

Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You

got any coke?

ORLANDO

OK, now you're insulting me.

CHEV

Come on, man, I know you got coke.

ORLANDO

You think every brother is carrying, is

that it?

CHEV

Come on, I don't have time for this, just

give me something ... I'm really dying

here ...

ORLANDO

I can see that.

CHEV

No. You don't understand, I'm really

fucking dying ... if I don't ...

(losing it again)

May I just have some coke, please?

ORLANDO

So this is medicinal use coke, that's

what you're telling me.

CHEV

That's right.

OK, that's good.    That's good.

RLANDO

Oh that's good, right?

Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY

O...kay...

ORLANDO (CONT'D)

Whoa, Chelios. You good, man?

CHEV

his shit's not working.

ORLANDO

Beg your pardon?

HEV

I think I know what I have to do.

ORLANDO

(shrugging)

Well, a man's got to do what a man's got

do?

Got to kick... some black... ass.

CONTINUED: (7)

ORLANDO

What?

CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the

room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then,

without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S

face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all

the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins.

O

RLANDO (CONT'D)

There he goes again.

CHEV has a pool cue in his hands.   He moves out into the

hallway, eyes wild.

OUND: CHEV's HEARTBEAT starts to rev up.

CHEV

Alright ... who wants white meat?

All hell breaks loose.

A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it,

single door closed.

SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of

the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been

thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a

cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk.

A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is

tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a

jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The

BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down.

STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22

HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE

STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A

JACKHAMMER.

Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating

hard, panting with adrenaline.

You motherfucker!

VERONA

ude, aren't you dead yet?    What the hell

are you doing out there?

CHEV

I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me.

VERONA

eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd

like to know that I'm all about hooking

up with that mystery girl you've been

banging as soon as your ass is

underground ... I forgot to say so on

that gay James Bond tape I left for

you...

CHEV

Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my

grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you

think Carlito is going to think when he

finds out what you did? Your whole crew

is history.

CHEV checks the rearview mirror.

CHEV (CONT'D)

(under his breath)

Great.

Throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, 23B

more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up

behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to

"PULL OVER" out of its intercom.

HEV goes evasive, leading the cop on a HIGH SPEED CHASE.

VERONA

Woah!

You've got to do something for me, it

feels so crazy, like it's in my blood ...

CONTINUED:

CHEV swerves wildly. Throughout the conversation we are

tight on CHEV and DOC - the only idea we have about the chase

occurring outside the car comes from CHEV'S wild steering,

the sound of BURNING RUBBER AND SIRENS, and the few details

flashing by in the background and reflected in the glass.

DOC MILES

Alright, slow down. You say you've been

poisoned. Can you describe the symptoms?

CHEV

It's like... it's like... like I'm

Yeah.

Listen, Chev - you have to keep moving.

CHEV

Explain.

DOC MILES

If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing

Cocktail... very nasty ... works on your

adrenal gland, blocking your receptors.

The only way to slow it down is to keep

the flow of adrenaline constant.

CHEV CRASHES HIS CAR INTO THE ESCALATOR.

e hops out with cell phone to his ear and takes a ride to

the second floor, RIDING THE SMASHED CAR UP THE ESCALATOR.

DOC MILES (CONT'D)

Meaning: if you stop, you die.

CHEV

What's that?

DOC MILES

If you stop, you die.

INT. FOX HILLS MALL - DAY

CHEV jumps off of the car and starts booking through the

second level, huffing it, barking into the phone the whole

time.

CHEV

That's what I'm trying to do... just keep

moving... keep the blood pumping... every

time I slow down it's like my veins start

to rust...

points at the CABBIE and starts screaming ...

ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they

want no part of this. CHEV is nowhere to be seen.

LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of

caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life -

drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes.

He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous

BUTCHER KNIFE.

Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly

closed. He advances.

The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings

the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and

tries to peer around it into the alley.

Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the

BUTCHER KNIFE.

efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and

neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun

and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and

into the alley.

ALEX crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in

front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that

comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the

out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes

him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him.

CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look

inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over,

trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray,

tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering.

He rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are

at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S

direction. They look up toward him.

He ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and

slips in.

INT HOSPITAL ROOM, MOMENTS LATER

The room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an

OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly

at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He

watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ...

CUT TO:

EXT STORE WINDOW, DAY

ut DOC MILES is already a distant memory ... CHEV lets the

phone drop from his ear without hanging up ...

.. as he comes up on a department store window where a crowd

has gathered to watch a wall of TV's, all playing the same

thing ...

.. he slows to a stop, joining the crowd ...

he face on the TV is his - more or less - an exaggerated

black and white POLICE SKETCH, simian browed and thick

lipped. He looks like a serial rapist.

ANCHOR (V.O.)

Police have declined to release the name

of the West Hollywood man they say is

still at large on a citywide rampage that

has left one man dead, dozens injured and

hundreds of thousands of dollars of

property damage in its smoking, bloody

wake.

NCHOR (V.O.)

However, Eyewitness News has learned that

the suspect is a professional killer with

ties to organized crime and an extensive

police record. He is considered armed

and highly dangerous.

A GUY standing next to CHEV glances sidelong at him. CHEV

turns to meet his eyes. The GUY regards him in a stupor,

then looks down: CHEV's hospital johnnie is sticking straight

out in front, ass hanging out the back, a gun in his left

hand, cell phone in his right.

he GUY looks back up at CHEV'S poker face, gulps, and turns

back to the wall of screens.

The broadcast cuts from tape back to the live ANCHOR.

ANCHOR (CONT'D)

We want to get you back to our regularly

scheduled programming, but keep it tuned

right here to ABC for continuing coverage

of this bizarre story as it unfolds.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

(over network graphic)

We now return you to "Dr. Phil" ...

The TV cuts to a talk show in progress. Rather than

disperse, the small crowd stays hypnotically glued to the

tube. We see in their eyes that everyone is going into that

TV alpha state thing ...

CHEV shakes his head, snaps out of it. His HEARTBEAT, barely

audible during the broadcast, swells back to full volume,

beating like a jackrabbit's.

H

e looks around and spots a COP on a motorcycle, waiting at a

stoplight.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TV STORE

With a last look at the TV drones he breaks from the crowd

and goes into stealth mode, darting from car to car in an

exaggerated ninja crouch, trying to sneak up on the COP.

He comes up behind him, transfers his gun and cell phone to

one hand, and - heart POUNDING - reaches stealthily for the

COP'S holster with the other.

CAR HORNS BLARE as motorists attempt to warn the COP, who

flinches and whips around at the noise - but it's too late:

CHEV has the gun.

He begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the COP, as

everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic

snarl, SLAMMING INTO FENDERS, driving up onto the sidewalk,

etc.

CHEV

(tossing the gun up and

catching it)

You want it? You want this?

he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but

jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up

like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40

feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain.

he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV

dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He

kicks up the stand and REVS IT.

COP

You son of a bitch!

The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as

the bike jerks forward.

HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on,

dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like

buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,

kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then

jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,

dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails

out.

From the rear pegs at about 30 mph he JUMPS UP TO THE GAS

TANK, feet first, STANDS STRAIGHT UP ON THE MOVING BIKE and

puts his hands out to his sides in a Jesus Christ pose,

flashing a silhouette in the sun. His HEART POUNDS as he

flies by crowds of astonished bystanders ...

.. and CRASHES straight into a patio restaurant full of

people.

CHEV flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of

overturned tables and busted dishes. A table spins like a

coin at his feet.

Stunned silence hangs in the air; a few food-covered people

wander around in dazed shock. CHEV'S arm, hand still

clutching his cell phone, sticks out from under a table. The

phone starts to ring:

BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM.

From under the table we see CHEV'S eyes blink as he comes to

his senses.

He shakes off the debris, struggles to his feet and clicks to

answer the phone.

Yeah.

some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons

It's CHEV. He's dressed in a blue Adidas JOGGING SUIT - long

sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the

works. He couldn't look more out of place in EVE'S mellow

She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a

huff.

HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the

window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better

look.

A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split

up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each

up some unintelligible stacato nonsense.

the BRIDGE OF THE NOSE - dropping him instantly.

blood rushing from his nose. CHEV glances quickly around for

witnesses - then backs into the hallway, letting the door

swing shut behind him.

bins line the brick wall, ready for pick up. CHEV and EVE are

leaving when CHEV sees the other HOOD coming around the

raffic flashes by at high speed then cuts to slo mo: The

A LITTLE BOY who could be younger version of CHEV himself

rides in the back seat. They make eye contact as the cars

cross paths.

CHEV finds himself drifting into a dream state.

CABBIE. The CABBIE digs for change.

CHEV

It's all you, man.    Keep it.

at the building.

Where's he going?

CUT TO:

EXT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME

CHEV comes up on a loading platform. Korean workers are

loading boxes out of the building into the backs of trucks in

the sweltering heat.

He walks by them into the building without making eye contact

with anyone. They barely notice.

He skirts the packing floor and heads to a dilapidated

freight elevator, gets on, starts up.

INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR, SAME TIME

The front and ceiling of the ELEVATOR are open, exposing the

shaft, the cables and the passing floors; he reaches the 4TH

FLOOR, heading up ... hundreds of Koreans sitting at sewing

machines, all running at once, a mind numbing din ... windows

painted over black, chipped and cracked in places with shards

of light slicing through ... slow turning ceiling fans and

long rows of fluorescent light beating down on the tables ...

HEV hops off and lets the elevator keep going.

INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 4TH FLOOR, SECONDS LATER

THE CAMERA follows CHEV through the room, along the humming

rows of sewing machines. He crosses from one side of the

room to another, where a single open window leading out to

the fire escape streams sunlight. A SUPERVISOR, Korean,

skinny, mid-thirties, stringy mustache, is dozed off in a

chair by the window.

CHEV walks right by, out the window and onto the fire escape.

The CAMERA stays with him.

EXT FIRE ESCAPE, CONTINUOUS

CHEV beats his head into the brick wall, climbs up the fire

escape, skips the next floor up, gets onto the roof.

EXT ROOF, SECONDS LATER

CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's,

stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the

opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV -

holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and

gun sit on the ledge beside him.

We recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the

men loitering around the pool.

CHEV sneaks up.

HOOD #2

How the hell should I know? He went in

where they load the boxes. Alright,

alright ...

H

e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S

gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh

under his chin.

CHEV

(sarcastically)

Hey, what a coincidence, you like this

spot too?

HOOD #2

Chevy!   Shit!

HEV

What the fuck is this, you working for

the Chinese now?

HOOD #2

The Chinese... are you crazy?

CHEV

Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo?

HOOD #2

Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ...

CHEV

(losing his patience)

OK, ding, time's up ...

In one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs,

hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE

BUILDING, then turns and heads for the roof access door ...

The 5TH FLOOR is a little used storage level - stacked boxes,

dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with

harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. We

recognize this as the room KAYLO called from ... more so

because his LIMP BODY is still duct taped to the rolling

office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the

room.

A

half dozen more HOODS are gathered in front of the freight

elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by

surprise.

e's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded

purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE.

CHEV

Alright, where is that motherfucker?

The HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away

from CHEV, spreading out.

OOD #3

Uh ... hey, Chev.

The HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows

each other.

CHEV

What the fuck is this?

OOD #1

Chevy, baby, take it easy.

CHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their

guns at him.

HEV

Verona got nothing to do with this.

CHEV

What?

Don Carlos wants you off the street.

CHEV

Carlito?

HOOD #1

You've totally lost your shit, dude ...

you're all over the TV ... destroying

property, making unauthorized hits ...

you're causing the organization a great

deal of embarrassment.

CHEV

Carlito ordered this?

HOOD #1

(ignoring it)

Look, forget about Verona. We'll take

care of him. The best thing for you to

do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place

and just ... die.

CHEV

Just die.

HOOD #1

Yeah.   Just ... die.

Right ... so ... let's all die ...

HOOD #1

Eh?

CHEV brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead

on HOOD #1 and is about to set off a SHOOTING GALLERY, when

the ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES and the door SLIDES OPEN.

EVE WALKS IN... looks around, and FREEZES.

They all turn to look.

HOOD #1 (CONT'D)

What the...?

CHEV affords himself about a second and a half of BUG-EYED

SHOCK before snapping out of it and DROPPING HOOD #1

INSTANTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE HEAD.

HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start

blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward

the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft,

grabbing EVE as he goes.

AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits,

finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on

the run, nailing him right between the eyes.

HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make

a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE

ASS.

CHEV

OW!

He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck.

EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft.

The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs

EVE, then the cable... they jump for it.

CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a

CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all

in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've

obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around,

shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in

Korean to keep working.

The SUPERVISOR, all of five feet, walks right up to CHEV and

EVE, and starts screaming at them in broken English.

SUPERVISOR

You!    Assholes! What you want!

EVE completely FLIPS OUT and starts SHOUTING DOWN the little

man.

EVE

DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!! MY BOYFRIEND

KILLS PEOPLE!!!

CHEV

Nice.

The door on the far end of the room BUSTS OPEN and HOODS pour

in from the stairwell. They spot him.

CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of

machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play

cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans

while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and

forcing the workers back into their chairs.

CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily...

... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the

HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at

least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older.

THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE

SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE.

HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape.

EXT FIRE ESCAPE, SECONDS LATER

They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by

gunfire from above.

CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all.

EVE

I had to see if you were telling the

truth... oh, and you have my purse.

CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off

and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks

cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire

escape.

He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that

his left leg has TURNED GREY.

He's HALF DEAD.

Stay.

They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE.

CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the

traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in.

EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then

pulls herself together and gets out.

She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic.

TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store

in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks

through them and INSIDE.

EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers,

following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS.

A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back.

She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in

the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in

one hand...

busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN.

walks past the valets into the RETRO-MOD LOBBY.

and opens his coat - we see a PAGER-SIZED device clipped to

his belt - a green LED is illuminated.

shiny with perspiration.

He pulls out his shirt tails ... we see that a small tube

runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of

HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep

breaths and leaves the stall.

of the DUDES, who were about to go in. They let him pass,

No, this was the best way for a guy like

Who the hell are you, anyway?

Don't you know?

I think I'm starting to figure it out.

Yeah, well, better late than never.

Yeah, maybe.

HEV glances at the lit floor number display, then back.

The JAPANESE MAN stares back at him, blank.

CHEV (CONT'D)

Some pills, Doc.

The JAPANESE MAN ignores him. When the doors open, he

hustles off ... past two GOONS, who are waiting there for

CHEV.

They each take an arm.

CHEV (CONT'D)

Easy ...

GOON

This way.

INT RESTAURANT, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark

corridor.

They frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder

holster, yank it out and push him into a SMOKING LOUNGE.

INT SMOKING LOUNGE, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An

iced bucket of champagne, good cigars. GOONS chill in the

corners. The whole floor has been cleared out - they've got

the place all to themselves.

Looks like everyone's here.

Basically.

What the fuck is insulin?

We'll see what kind of a bitch you are

when Carlito hires you for half what he

used to pay me... and you take it.

CARLITO

That's enough.

CHEV

You'll probably throw boss a nice little

reach-around just to show what a good

bitch you are.

VERONA

I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me?

He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!

CARLITO

I said that's enough.

(calmly)

It's been a long day. But in the end, you

must agree, it all works out quite

nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks

to you...

ARLITO (CONT'D)

Police have surrounded the hotel and are pouring into the

Lobby in teams. Squad cars, CHERRY TOPS FLASHING, SWAT vans

A

CUT TO:

EXT. STANDARD HOTEL, POOL AREA - SIMULTANEOUS

CHEV staggers out into the daylight as the windows to the

restaurant shatter - and is met by a SWIRLING RUSH OF WIND as

the HELICOPTER attempts to set down amidst the chaise lounges

and futuristic plastic cabanas.

CARLITO is climbing in as CHEV clambers up and GRABS HIM FROM

BEHIND. CARLITO spins; CHEV shoves the gun in his face.

CHEV

Present from Kaylo.

But just as he's about to pull the trigger, he FREEZES...

face TWITCHING... knees BUCKLING...

... and we see that VERONA has come up behind him and JAMMED

VERONA grabs the gun out of CHEV'S hand and points it at

CARLITO.

VERONA

WHO'S THE BITCH NOW?

He blows CARLITO away with three shots.

The PILOT starts to lift off in a blue panic. VERONA shoves

CHEV aside and hops into the back seat, pointing his gun at

the PILOT'S head.

VERONA (CONT'D)

That's right, motherfucker!   FLY!

VERONA whips the gun around as the bird rises, intending to

.

finish CHEV off from the air ...

.. and has the gun removed from his hand by CHEV, who has

climbed onto the landing skids, hooking his dead arm inside

the passenger space, going up with them.

DON KIM watches the HELICOPTER rise as his MEN finish off the

last of CARLITO'S GOONS...

EXT THE SKY ABOVE LOS ANGELES, SECONDS LATER

CHEV'S HEARTBEAT IS SLAMMING as the bird rises high above the

rooftop and the surrounding streets. He wrestles his way up

out.

CHEV has VERONA locked up; both men are fighting with just

one hand ... VERONA manages to work his up to CHEV'S

shoulder, where the steel needle still pokes through. He

slides it out and stabs at CHEV'S face ... CHEV catches his

wrist in time to hold him off, but his grip is slipping ...

The spaces between CHEV'S HEARTBEATS have grown longer and

longer ... he's obviously having a massive coronary ...

VERONA

You're dead, you're dead, you're dead!

HEV swoons; his eyes roll back in his head ... he starts to

go limp, fall backwards ...

Then, with a final rush of adrenaline, he grabs VERONA by the

neck and pulls him along.

The two men FALL FROM THE HELICOPTER.

CHEV continues to strangle VERONA in midair.

CHEV

I told you I'd kill you, you son of a

bitch!

VERONA'S eyes bulge in disbelief. CHEV continues to strangle

him until VERONA goes limp, glassy eyed ... CHEV finally lets

go ... VERONA'S body drifts away ...

There.

Now he's alone, free falling ... it's almost peaceful up
