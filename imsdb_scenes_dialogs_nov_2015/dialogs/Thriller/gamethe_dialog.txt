The Game

by

John Brancato & Michael Ferris

REVISED

October 19, 1995

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Van Orton... Yes, it is my

birthday, Bob, is that why you

called...?  Ah... No, I'm not

carrying Alan Baer another inch,

fuck him, BG Lumber is history...

SCHUYLER (on carphone)

Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know

me, of course I'm behind Baer-

Grace a hundred per cent... great,

see you at the shareholders'

meeting next month...

SCHUYLER (on cellphone)

I've got buyers for the BG paper mill,

goose the lawyers, final papers in

three weeks... sure it's sad, but an

old dog loses its teeth and pisses

itself, you put it to sleep...

MARIA

Carol from the museum called.

She's sending architect's sketches

of the wing...

MARIA

That Business Week reporter called again--

SCHUYLER

Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely.

MARIA

(awkwardly)

--and, um, somebody who identified

himself as, um, P.P. Willy.

MARIA

Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but

he swore you'd know who he was.  He

wanted to meet you for lunch, I told

him you had appointments all--

SCHUYLER

Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon.

MARIA

But you--

SCHUYLER

Do it.  Did he leave a number?

MARIA

No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's

in the Haight.  At noon.

SCHUYLER

That's all, Maria.

CUT TO:

CHRISTINE

Can I take your order?

SCHUYLER

I haven't seen the menu.

CHRISTINE

Oh, right.  Here, see ya.

SCHUYLER

An iced tea, please--

DAVID

Yo, Sky.  Happy birthday.

SCHUYLER

(rubs his head, annoyed)

Thanks, "Pee-pee."  I never get

tired of that.

SCHUYLER

Well... long time.

DAVID

Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five

years? So how you been?

SCHUYLER

Business as usual...

DAVID

How's Elizabeth?  Any kids?

SCHUYLER

A little girl.

DAVID

Congrat--

SCHUYLER

It's not mine, she married a

pediatrician in Sausalito.

DAVID

You're divorced...

(off Schuyler's nod)

Too bad, she was actually interesting.

SCHUYLER

She stopped drinking, I guess

getting rid of me was the 13th step.

DAVID

So you're all alone in the House of Pain.

SCHUYLER

I redecorated.  Where have

you

been?

DAVID

All over.  Nowhere in particular.

Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep

you informed of my every movement?

SCHUYLER

I called them off two years ago,

David.  You'd kicked the heroin, you'd

left the ashram, you were windsurfing

somewhere in Central America...

DAVID

It's gorgeous down there... you

should go sometime.

SCHUYLER

Look, are you in trouble, is there

anything you need?  You can't have

gone through the trust fund...

DAVID

(looks at him, hurt)

That's not why I'm here, Sky, I

just wanted to see you... I even

brought a gift, for a change.

SCHUYLER

You didn't bake me a cake, did you?

DAVID

You can't still be mad about the

hash brownies...

DAVID

Happy birthday, bro.

SCHUYLER

What is this.

DAVID

It's a bomb.  Open it!

SCHUYLER

Consumer Recreation Services.  OK...

DAVID

I can't tell you very much about it,

that'd ruin the surprise.  Just

promise me you'll give 'em a call.

SCHUYLER

I don't get it.

DAVID

Just call 'em.  OK look, it's simple,

really.  They entertain you.

SCHUYLER

Is this an escort service?

DAVID

No, it's nothing like that.

They're a business, they're for

real... They guarantee just one

thing-- you won't be bored.

DAVID

They make your life fun.

SCHUYLER

Fun.

DAVID

You've heard of it.

CHRISTINE

Sorry.

SCHUYLER

Just a cheesebur... how'd you find

this place?

DAVID

Old connection used to meet me

here.  So you gonna call 'em?

SCHUYLER

(a sigh, carefully)

You know, David, this is sweet, but

it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the

midst of a delicate liquidation--

DAVID

(mimicking him bitterly)

"A delicate liquidation," God, you

would do this...

SCHUYLER

David--

DAVID

We can't get together once without

you making me feel like shit.  That's

important to you, isn't it?

SCHUYLER

What are you talking about?

DAVID

Forget about it, don't bother.

SCHUYLER

Are you still on medication...?

CHRISTINE

You guys know what you want?

DAVID

Go away.

DAVID

I just thought you'd like it.  I did,

it was a blast, best thing that ever

happened to me.  And for your

information, I'm not on anything

anymore, I'm not even seeing a

shrink, I'm in a better place than

I've ever been, I'm even

happy

-- but

that's something else I wouldn't be

able to explain to you.

SCHUYLER

OK, OK, I'll give them a call...

DAVID

Whatever.

SCHUYLER

Look, take a pill.  Just be normal

for thirty seconds and tell me what

this is.  I hate surprises.

DAVID

I know.

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

Van Orton.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

Hello, Schuyler.

SCHUYLER

Eleven forty, you almost didn't

make it.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

I always call on your birthday.

How was it?

SCHUYLER

Oh, the usual, big party, circus

clowns, naked lady in a cake...

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

(slight chuckle; serious)

How are

you

, Sky?

SCHUYLER

I'm just fine.  How are you?

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

It wasn't a trick question.

Thirty-eight, I thought that might

be a-- a difficult year for you...

SCHUYLER

Hm?  Just another birthday,

another year closer to death.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

I meant-- because of your father.

SCHUYLER

Oh that's right, I guess he

was

38,

wasn't he?  I hadn't thought about

it, to tell the truth, but thank you

for the reminder.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

Why do I call you...

SCHUYLER

I honestly don't know, but it's a

nice change of pace from talking

to your attorneys.  So, still

working at the hospice?

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

Mm-hmm, couple days a week...

SCHUYLER

Great, that's great.  Well, give my

regards to Dr. Mel and the baby--

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

She has a little brother on the

way... we just did the ultrasound.

SCHUYLER

Really.  Congratulations-- two

kids, an official nuclear family,

you must be very happy.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

We are, Sky.  Very happy.

SCHUYLER

Well, you deserved someone who

wanted the same things you did--

ELIZABETH

Are

you

?  Happy?

SCHUYLER

Speaking of little brothers, I saw

David today.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

Really?

SCHUYLER

He asked about you.  He's on a new

kick, some personal improvement cult.

I'm gonna check it out, I'm sure he's

getting fleeced again.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

Who knows, maybe it'll be good for

you.  Send David my love.

SCHUYLER

Right.  Well, thanks again for

calling, Elizabeth, take care.

ELIZABETH (on speaker)

You too, Schuyler-- I mean that--

SCHUYLER

Mm, good luck, bye.

CUT TO:

BERNARD SHAW (TV)

--for the residents of the

Crescent Heights project, a truly

tragic day is over at last--

SCHUYLER

I'll drink to that.

BERNARD SHAW (TV)

--up next, the latest in sports.

For all of us here at CNN, thank

you for watching--

CUT TO:

RECEPTIONIST

Can I help you?

SCHUYLER

Is this Consumer Recreation

Services?  I have an appointment,

the name's Van Orton.

RECEPTIONIST

Hm... I don't seem to--

SCHUYLER

Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week.

FEINGOLD

Problem?

RECEPTIONIST

This gentlemen says he has an

appointment, but...

FEINGOLD

Van Orton, huh?  I'll take him.

(shakes his hand)

Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of

engineering and data analysis.

FEINGOLD

Sorry about the chaos, we're still

in the process of moving...

follow me, I've got an office

around here someplace.

CUT TO:

FEINGOLD

I can't remember the last time I ate

in a restaurant, all I do is work...

SCHUYLER

I know what you mean.  Look-- what

is all this?

FEINGOLD

Application, MMPI and TAT tests,

financial statement...

(indicating food)

Want some?  Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...

(as Schuyler shakes his head)

The tests serve a threefold purpose.

First off, are you right for us?

Are we right for you?  Unfortunately,

there's a limited number of slots--

SCHUYLER

Let's back up here--

FEINGOLD

(over him)

B, we need an idea of your abilities

and limitations, what turns you on,

and off.  Numero tres, our insurance

company requires it.

(a beat, studying Schuyler)

You're familiar with our service,

aren't you?

SCHUYLER

Not at all.  What

are

you selling?

FEINGOLD

Well... it's a game.

SCHUYLER

A game.

FEINGOLD

Recharges the batteries, gets you

off the treadmill, it's an

experience.  Sort of a-- vacation

for the guy who's been everywhere.

SCHUYLER

This really doesn't sound like my

sort of--

SCHUYLER

What's so amusing?

FEINGOLD

Nothing.  I know who you are.

You're David Van Orton's brother,

he got you in here.

SCHUYLER

So.

FEINGOLD

(remembering fondly)

David was-- impressive, one of the

better I've seen.  But frankly, I

can see you're not the type.

SCHUYLER

The type.

FEINGOLD

You know, a player.

SCHUYLER

I'm not a player.

FEINGOLD

I don't mean anything personal by it--

I know you're an important guy,

powerful guy, you're used to being on

top.  It's just, this isn't for

everyone.  Not everyone can handle it.

SCHUYLER

(nearly losing it)

What kind of fu-- game is this?

FEINGOLD

The ultimate fucking game.  I wish I

could tell you more, but it's

different every time.

(rising)

Thanks for coming in--

SCHUYLER

(doesn't move)

I'm not an idiot.  I see what you're

doing.  First the vague yet intriguing

pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like

my manhood's in question because I'm

not up for, what, some motivational

role-playing fantasy nonsense--

FEINGOLD

Interesting, you don't know the first

thing about it but you've already

decided what it is... Listen, I

don't wanna waste any more--

SCHUYLER

Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get

shit.  I've got the afternoon

free, I'll take your silly tests.

FEINGOLD

Ms. Nelson, are you busy?  We need

someone to run Mr. Van Orton.

MS. NELSON

This way, sir...

FEINGOLD

I'll catch up with you after the physical.

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

David, you suck.

FEINGOLD

Sorry to keep you waiting,

a client's head exploded...

(grins)

You can get dressed, we're done.

FEINGOLD

Looks promising at this point.

You test well, you're in decent

shape for someone in your tax

bracket... Hm, some resistance to

the psych questions, but we got

the general idea...

FEINGOLD

We design the game around your

schedule, you're free to give it

as much or as little time as you

wish.  And of course, you can call

it quits at any point.

SCHUYLER

This was actually a gift.  Did my

brother pay in advance?

FEINGOLD

You'd have to ask our billing

department... the price varies.  But

our service comes with a guarantee.

If you're not satisfied, there's no

charge.  And we've never had an

unsatisfied customer...

SCHUYLER

You mean dissatisfied.

FEINGOLD

(looking at a form)

Mm, that's right-- you're a left-

brain word fetishist.

SCHUYLER

I get that all the time.

SCHUYLER

So I'm supposed to sign up for a

game when I don't know the rules,

I don't know the object, I don't

know how much it costs...

FEINGOLD

It's a leap of faith.  But at this

stage, there's no commitment-- we

just need to process your

application.  And if you qualify,

you're in for the ride of your

life.  What have you got to lose?

FEINGOLD

Initials-- initials-- sign here.

FEINGOLD

In blood.

(a WINK)

---Just kidding.

FEINGOLD

Very good, Mr. Van Orton.  Please,

keep the pen.

SCHUYLER

When can I expect to hear--

FEINGOLD

We'll be in touch.

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER (V. O.)

David, where the hell are you, we

were supposed to meet at the club--

DAVID (V. O.)

Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced--

next Tuesday?

SCHUYLER (V. O.)

I'll be in Seattle.

DAVID (V. O.)

Buy you lunch soon as you get

back, I swear...

SCHUYLER (V. O.)

I checked out CRS by the way--

DAVID (V. O.)

Hey, great, you gonna go for it?

SCHUYLER (V. O.)

Haven't decided yet...

JOHN

--like fuckin' wildfire, just

opened an office in Frisco here--

PETE

I played my game in New York...

What do you think John, will CRS

ever go public?

JOHN

(laughs)

Not likely, would you?

SCHUYLER

New members?

BARTENDER

I believe so.

SCHUYLER

This round's on me.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETE

...last time I played Pebble, I swore

I'd never pick up a club again...

SCHUYLER

Great thing about golf, the way it

takes you out of your life...

Speaking of games-- I take it you

two are familiar with CRS...?

JOHN

Uh-oh.  Time to piss...

PETE

Why do you ask, Schuyler?

SCHUYLER

I couldn't help overhearing--

PETE

We don't usually talk about it.

SCHUYLER

I only bring it up because, well,

I recently tested for it.

PETE

Did you?  Kudos.

SCHUYLER

I just wasn't sure if they're for

real, whether it's worth it--

PETE

Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did

save my fucking life...

SCHUYLER

Sorry?

PETE

Look, I don't know you, you don't know

me, but... I hit a certain point,

nothing meant anything.  My work, the

wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was

sick of it all, y'know?  But CRS... they

changed everything.  "Are they for

real?"  Who cares, maybe nothing is.

(raises his glass)

To reality.

JOHN

C'mon Pete.

PETE

(winks at Schuyler)

Good luck, pal.  You'll need it.

CUT TO:

PLYMPTON

Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Postponing

the Baer-Grace meeting is out of

the question.  Schuyler gets on a

plane for Washington tomorrow

morning at seven with every

contract, every side agreement,

the complete closing package!

LAWYER

But there's simply no--

SCHUYLER

No is not an option.  If you fail

to recognize that, I'll find ten

other law firms in the yellow

pages that can get the job done--

SCHUYLER

(impatient)

Yes.

CYNTHIA (filter)

Mr. Van Orton?

SCHUYLER

Yes, who

is

this?

CYNTHIA (filter)

This is Cynthia at CRS...

SCHUYLER

What?!  How did you get this number?

CYNTHIA (filter)

I'm just calling to inform you

that we've finished processing

your application--

SCHUYLER

I'm in a meeting--

CYNTHIA (filter)

--and I'm afraid you didn't qualify.

SCHUYLER

--so I don't have time for--

(beat, then quickly)

Excuse me, what was that?

CYNTHIA (filter)

Well... your application was rejected.

SCHUYLER

...Why?

CYNTHIA (filter)

Oh, I'm afraid I don't have that

information, but-- many applicants

don't meet the criteria.  We

apologize, we hope it hasn't

caused you any inconvenience--

SCHUYLER

This is absurd--

CYNTHIA (filter)

Thank you for thinking of CRS.

PLYMPTON

Bad news, Sky?

SCHUYLER

No, nothing.  Sorry, Bob.

(loudly, to boardroom)

So were there any more questions, or

may I assume it's under control...

CUT TO:

FLASH CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

SCHUYLER

Hello!  What are you doing here?

SCHUYLER

Wonderful.  You OK?  You dead?

SCHUYLER

Shit, shit, shit...

CUT TO:

BERNARD SHAW (on TV)

...the bill goes before the House

next week, where it's expected to

meet stiff opposition--

(beat, touches his ear)

Wait, this just in...

BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)

The U. S. geological service has

detected a massive disturbance in the

earth's crust deep beneath the northern

segment of the San Andreas fault...

BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)

...they have issued a warning that a

major earthquake of magnitude eight

or greater is likely to hit the San

Francisco Bay area within...

(a beat)

Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes--

BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)

There is no time for an evacuation.

The federal government has issued

the following instructions for all

residents of central and northern

California...

BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)

Locate emergency shut-offs for all

power and gas--

BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)

Wait, there's no time for that-- just

stay away from windows and doors--

BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)

Find a heavy piece of furniture such as

a desk or table and get under it--

BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)

If no such furniture is immediately

available, go to a window or doorway--

BERNARD sHAW (cant., on TV)

But first turn off all power and gas.

Crouch in a comfortable position, put

your head between your knees and cover

it with your arms--

BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)

Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE!

BERNARD SHAW (on TV)

Howdy Sky.

CYBERSHAW (on TV)

Que pasa?

CYBERSHAW (on TV)

Welcome to the Game!

Congratulations on your decision

to let Consumer Recreation

Services entertain you.

SCHUYLER

Fuckers!

CYBERSHAW (on TV)

This might be a good time to lay out

a few ground rules, help you enjoy

your adventure.  You've received the

first key.  There will be others.

Pay attention-- you never know where

you'll find 'em, you never know when

you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with

you at all times...

CYBERSHAW (on TV)

You might want to write this number

down, it's the CRS hotline, operators

are standing by to assist... but

please don't call to ask what the

object of the game is-- figuring that

out is the object of the game...

BERNARD SHAW (on TV)

--reaction on wall Street was muted

following the Fed's announcement of...

OPERATOR VOICE (filter)

You've reached CRS...

SCHUYLER

Yeah, this is pretty impressive

but listen--

OPERATOR VOICE (filter)

Our office is closed.  Please call

back during business hours.

(BEEP)

SCHUYLER

My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my

game just started.  Look, this is a

bad time, I'm about to leave town--

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

I'm expecting a package with some

documents.  Did it arrive?

RASTA MAN

Ay mon, got sometin' fo you mon.

DRIVER

(to the rasta)

Get lost, pal.

RASTA MAN

No can do.

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Bob, it's Sky, what the hell is

going on?  No, the papers aren't

here, you'll have to fax signature

copies straight to the BG offices

now.  Yeah I'll hold.

RASTA MAN

You want what I got, mon.

SCHUYLER

(hand over the phone)

No thank you.

RASTA MAN

Dere are many paths to

enlightenment, but you must choose

one and stay on it-- or you will

surely die in the darkness--

SCHUYLER

I'll take my chances.

SCHUYLER (on phone)

What?!  Fire their asses, that's it.

RASTA MAN

Jah Love mon, dat's the key, dat's the key...

SCHUYLER

Alan!  What's wrong with a car--

BAER

I'm giving you an overview of our

little operation!  You gotta see the

new breed of high yield saplings...

BAER

How was your flight?

SCHUYLER

Fine.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BAER

You've been planning this for months,

haven't you?  Sandbagging me like

this, selling us for scrap...

SCHUYLER

BG lumber is not profitable and

hasn't been for years, my duty is to

salvage what I can.  These are the

closing papers, in ten minutes I'm

going to present the sale terms to

the shareholders and elect my new

management team.

BAER

I was friends with your father, you

bastard, I watched you grow up, and

now you kick me in the balls--

BAER (O.S.)

That's not how you play the game.

BAER

You could've fucking

told

me!

SCHUYLER

What game?

SCHUYLER

Never mind... we'll just have to

go with the earlier draft.

BAER

Can't find your keys?

SCHUYLER

Where are they.

BAER

Up your ass?

SCHUYLER

Up my ass, very funny...

SCHUYLER

I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS...

SCHUYLER

So the game, it's just a screen, to

blow this deal...

BAER

I'm not following you.

SCHUYLER

Like hell you aren't.  How did you

get my brother involved, that's

unforgivable.

ASSISTANT

Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've

been having some trouble with this

fax, so they re-sent the material.

It's all OK now.

ASSISTANT

Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these

yours?  The pilot found 'em on the

floor of the chopper...

SCHUYLER

Everything seems to be in order.

Please disregard my last comments.

The shareholders meeting is about

to get underway... Shall we?

CUT TO:

P. A. VOICE (filter)

Flight 177 to San Francisco is now

boarding at Gate 14...

RASTA MAN

Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention.

SCHUYLER

Listen, I quit.

RASTA MAN

Free at last... you won't be

needin' this, then.

SCHUYLER

No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game.

RASTA MAN

Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you.

SCHUYLER

I said I-- shit!

RASTA MAN

Help, help!  The mon is crazy!

SCHUYLER

Where is it?

RASTA MAN

Got something better.

SCHUYLER

I realize you're just some bit

player, but I'd like you to get a

message to your employers.  This

bullshit is interfering with my

work, it's breaking my concentration

and I can't allow that to happen--

SCHUYLER

If I take that stupid key, will you

give me back my briefcase and go away?

SCHUYLER

What the fuck am I

doing

?!

RASTA MAN

Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit.

RASTA MAN

So try looking at it through rose-

colored glasses... here.

SCHUYLER

I told you, this is over!  I quit!

RASTA MAN

They all say that at first.

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

I was supposed to meet someone

here, a David Van Orton-- I was

wondering if he'd left a message.

RONNIE

'Fraid not, sorry.

CHRISTINE

Fuck me!

SCHUYLER

Oh this is cute.  Very cute.

RONNIE

What happened here, you OK?

CHRISTINE

It was an accident--

SCHUYLER

No it wasn't.

SCHUYLER

What's next, a giant banana peel?

CHRISTINE

Huh?  Oh I get it-- you're nuts.

RONNIE

Chrissy, just apologize...

CHRISTINE

Dickhead here was on the

phone

, he

walked right into me!

SCHUYLER

Drop the act, you've been waiting

all day for this moment.

CHRISTINE

Shut the fuck up.

RONNIE

Go home, you're fired.

CHRISTINE

What?...

RONNIE

You heard me.

CHRISTINE

Fuck you too.

SCHUYLER

Let's get this over with... Where's

the next key?  Does she have it?

SCHUYLER

I wish you people could be a

little more subtle.

CHRISTINE

Asshole, just send me the goddamn

dry-cleaning bill.  Could you--?

SCHUYLER

Don't you have something for me?

CHRISTINE

Uh-huh sure, here you go.

SCHUYLER

Wait, you really work here--

CHRISTINE

Not anymore, thanks to you.

SCHUYLER

Slow down-- you don't understand, I

thought it was a gag.

CHRISTINE

No, you don't understand.  I carry

mace and I know how to use it.

SCHUYLER

I was only trying to apologize.

CHRISTINE

Shit, it's in here somewhere--

SCHUYLER

Fine.

CHRISTINE

Shit--

CHRISTINE

You got a fucking phone, call an

ambulance!

SCHUYLER

This is just too weird-- it can't

be real--

CHRISTINE

You really are insane!

CHRISTINE

We need an ambulance, guy's having a

heart attack near the MUNI station at

5th and Market--

(to Schuyler)

What's the number on this thing?!

SCHUYLER

I don't give it out--

(off her horrified look)

731-5723--

CHRISTINE

731-5723-- yeah, thanks--

SCHUYLER

Is there anything I can do?

PARAMEDIC #1

(to Schuyler)

Could you come with us, help us

fill out a few forms--

SCHUYLER

No!  I have work to do--

CHRISTINE

I'll go.

SCHUYLER

Wait a minute, you've got my phone--

CHRISTINE

Chill, will you?!

SCHUYLER

I don't want to be here.

CHRISTINE

Neither do I, now siddown, get

outta their way!

SCHUYLER

I'd like my phone back please.

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

Oh, this day keeps getting better.

CHRISTINE

What is your problem, you think

the whole fucking world revolves

around you?

SCHUYLER

As a matter of fact...

CHRISTINE

What the fuck is going on?!

SCHUYLER

It's a little hard to explain...

CHRISTINE

Try!

SCHUYLER

I seem to be playing a game.  This

is supposed to be funny--

CHRISTINE

I don't get it.

SCHUYLER

--a challenge, a puzzle.

CHRISTINE

OK, I'm puzzled.  Where

are

we?

SCHUYLER

Damn it, no signal.

CHRISTINE

Here's a lightswitch--

SCHUYLER

I wouldn't--

SCHUYLER

I don't know the rules, if there are

any, but it seems the obvious move

usually backfires...

CHRISTINE

Of course.  I have no idea what

you're talking about.

CHRISTINE

Son of a bitch.

SCHUYLER

I think I have a key.

SCHUYLER

Damn it...

(a beat, thoughtful)

Wrong key...

CHRISTINE

Last match.

CHRISTINE

Too bright for you, is it?

SCHUYLER

I can see now.  Grab my arm.

CHRISTINE

No way!  You're crazy!

SCHUYLER

Stay on the path!

SCHUYLER

Christine, don't move!

CHRISTINE

Leave me alone!

CHRISTINE

Help!

CHRISTINE

Aaggh!  BUGS!!

SCHUYLER

Where are the glasses?!

CHRISTINE

Fuck the glasses!

SCHUYLER

We can't get out of here without them!

SCHUYLER

They're rubber.  Hold onto me,

I'll get us out of here.

CHRISTINE

Ha!

SCHUYLER

Fine, stay.

CHRISTINE

No!

SCHUYLER

What's your favorite color?

CHRISTINE

...Blue?

CHRISTINE

Wow... OK, this is kinda cool.  Hey!

SCHUYLER

Sorry, it's my game.  But we'll

take blue.

CHRISTINE

Talk about the blind leading the

blind... what's your name anyway?

SCHUYLER

Sky Van Orton.

CHRISTINE

Sky?  Were your folks hippies or

something?

SCHUYLER

Far from it.

CHRISTINE

I'm Christine Kaminsky.

SCHUYLER

Nice to meet you.

SCHUYLER

It's a company called Consumer

Recreation Services, CRS.  I never

know what's gonna happen next.

CHRISTINE

Well, who does.

SCHUYLER

Until recently, I had a pretty

good idea... Duck.

CHRISTINE

So are you like a serious masochist,

or just really, really bored?

SCHUYLER

I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been

dragged into this.

CHRISTINE

Well... I have to tell you

something.  Some guy came into

Leo's yesterday, showed me your

picture, offered me 250 bucks to

spill that food on you.

SCHUYLER

Ah.

CHRISTINE

Said it was a practical joke.  I

figured what the hell, I can use

the money-- I got him up to 500.

I hated that fucking job anyway--

SCHUYLER

Wait, so the heart attack, you

knew that was a joke too--

CHRISTINE

No!  It scared the shit out of me--

SCHUYLER

But that CPR routine--

CHRISTINE

I used to be a lifeguard.

SCHUYLER

(points)

We're getting somewhere...

CHRISTINE

How do we get up there?

CHRISTINE

Well, that was pointless... but

different... kind of fun...

SCHUYLER

Mm, a different kind of fun.

What's your middle name?

CHRISTINE

Louise... why?

SCHUYLER

You're supposed to be here... they

picked you for a reason.

CHRISTINE

But-- why?

SCHUYLER

Probably knew you'd play Good

Samaritan for that guy, drag me

along-- but they could have hired an

actor for that, less of a risk...

CHRISTINE

This is really sick.  I think

they're trying to fix us up.

SCHUYLER

Maybe you can't play alone--

CHRISTINE

Who says I want to play?

(a sigh)

OK, what the fuck are you doing in

the dumpster.

SCHUYLER

There's something in here I need.

CHRISTINE

What's that for?

SCHUYLER

I imagine I'll find out.

CHRISTINE

What are

you

looking at?

SCHUYLER

This is their offices.  We must

have been in their garage... my

office is just a few blocks from

here, we can get cleaned up there.

CUT TO:

CHRISTINE

Your turn.

SCHUYLER

(moving past her)

Find everything you need?

CHRISTINE

You're outta conditioner.

SCHUYLER

My apologies, I'll have it taken care

of.  Help yourself to the fridge.

CHRISTINE (O. S.)

So um... how rich are you anyway?

SCHUYLER

(amused)

Rich enough.  Bit forward, aren't you?

CHRISTINE (O. S.)

Well, what exactly do you do?

SCHUYLER

Manage investments, some venture

capital, I'm on the board of a number

of publicly traded companies...

CHRISTINE (O. S.)

So you just like, move money around?

SCHUYLER

Basically.  Beats working, huh?

CHRISTINE

You don't look so bad, without the tie.

SCHUYLER

Look, I hope you haven't been too

put out... I could probably get

you another job, I have a stake in

a couple of restaurants--

CHRISTINE

I'm not much of a waitress, really.

Y'know, today's been kind of--

SCHUYLER

Can you type?

CHRISTINE

Kind of a turn-on, you know?

(getting no response)

I didn't mean-- just, the danger...

Like fucking in a graveyard.

SCHUYLER

Mm.  So where do you live?

CHRISTINE

Out in Concord, with my folks,

unfortunately.  They're never

gonna believe that I've been

hanging out with a guy like you.

SCHUYLER

What do you mean?

CHRISTINE

Nothing, just-- most of the guys I

see have tats, y'know?

(off his confused look)

Tattoos...

SCHUYLER

Of course.  We'd better head

downstairs, the limo's waiting.

CUT TO:

CHRISTINE

Mind if I smoke in here?

SCHUYLER

Yes.

(leaning forward)

Up here on the left.

CHRISTINE

So what's our next move?  I mean, in

the game.  Obviously we need to figure

out what that crank thing is for--

SCHUYLER

I'm not playing anymore.

CHRISTINE

(disappointed)

Why not?

SCHUYLER

I have a life.  Jack'll take you

home, or wherever you want to go.

CHRISTINE

Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little

ballroom dancing before bed--

CHRISTINE

Wait, what about your clothes?

SCHUYLER

Forget it.

CHRISTINE

C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.

SCHUYLER

No, it's not-- just-- back from

the cleaners.

CHRISTINE

(throatily)

You dry clean your sweatshirts...

CHRISTINE

See ya.

SCHUYLER

Good night.

DAVID

Drive.  Anywhere.

SCHUYLER

Jesus, David, you scared the shit

out of me--

DAVID

I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please--

SCHUYLER

Where were you today?

DAVID

I almost didn't make it at all.  I

been in the bar for hours, waiting

for you to come back to your car--

Jesus, I can't believe I did this to

you, I'm so sorry--

SCHUYLER

Slow down, take a breath-- what

are you talking about?

DAVID

The game!  It just doesn't stop!

I thought I'd finished playing a

long time ago, I paid the bill,

then it started all over again,

they won't leave me alone--

SCHUYLER

(slowly, evenly)

Calm down.  What are they doing to you?

DAVID

Everything.  It just doesn't stop.

SCHUYLER

Look.  That's crazy.  Yes, it's a

pain in the ass, but why would they

keep playing once you paid them?

DAVID

I don't know!  I paid them MORE to

make it stop, God help me I even

gave you to them... but they won't

leave me alone!

DAVID

What's this?

SCHUYLER

It was on my windshield--

DAVID

Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be

following us--

DAVID

They're shooting at us!

SCHUYLER

David, get a grip, it's just a

flat tire!

SCHUYLER

Damn it, the phone's not working--

DAVID

Of course not.

SCHUYLER

(climbing out)

Fine, I'll change the fucking

thing myself.

DAVID

Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk.

SCHUYLER

No, you can't do it from--

SCHUYLER

What the fuck are those--

DAVID

(whirling on him)

Like you don't know.  Sonofabitch,

they got to you first, didn't they?

SCHUYLER

Um, David-- hello?

DAVID

It's more than that isn't it?  You're

part of it, you're one of them!  Of

course, it makes perfect sense!

SCHUYLER

They planted those keys!  I don't

know what the hell they're for--

DAVID

You're behind the whole thing aren't

you?  You and your sick fucking

friends set it up--

SCHUYLER

What?!  What friends?  Get a grip,

David-- why would I do that?

DAVID

I don't know, out of boredom, to

get back at me--

SCHUYLER

For what?!

DAVID

For being a weirdo, for trying to

be happy?  Well, congratulations,

you win.  Now make it stop!

SCHUYLER

(grabbing him)

I can't!  Listen to me--

DAVID

Fuck you!

SCHUYLER (on phone)

What have you done to my brother,

you bastards?!  This is over, I'm

not playing anymore--

(beat)

Hello, is anyone there--

PHONE VOICE

If you'd like to make a call,

please hang up and dial again-- if

you need help--

SCHUYLER

Six three six Mission, please.

SCHUYLER

You're heading the wrong way.

CABBIE (filter)

Relax, pal, you'll get where

you're going.

SCHUYLER

Why are you doing this--

CABBIE/RASTA (filter)

We do it all for you!  We're the best

friends you got, no one ever worked

so hard to make you feel alive... but

you gotta let it happen...

SCHUYLER

What the fuck is this--

CABBIE/RASTA

Have a nice day...

GIRL

Mister-- are you all right?!

SCHUYLER

Thank you... I'm very grateful.

GIRL

Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you

could get hepatitis.

SCHUYLER

I have to get in touch with the police.

GIRL

You're freezing, I got some dry

clothes below.

GIRL

Do you need any help?

SCHUYLER

Uh, no.  I'm fine.  These fit...

(buttoning his pants)

...perfectly.

GIRL

Sure I can't do something for you?

SCHUYLER

I am finished playing.

GIRL

OW!  Let go!

SCHUYLER

This has got to fucking STOP!

GIRL

You're hurting me!

SCHUYLER

Who are you!?

GIRL

I just got hired to show you a good

time!  C'mon please get off me...

GIRL

I am not into this kinda shit!

SCHUYLER

Who hired you.

GIRL

I don't know, the service set it up.

SCHUYLER

The service?

GIRL

Y'know, Fantasy Girls.  They said

you had this wild fantasy, I

should just wait in the boat...

GIRL

Doncha want your thing?  I'm supposed

to give you this, this key thingie...

SCHUYLER

A key.

GIRL

They said you'd figure out what to

do with it.

SCHUYLER

I'm supposed to carry a fucking

hatchet around...?  Relax.  I

don't want it.

CUT TO:

PLYMPTON

Thank you for your promptness,

officers.  I'm Robert Plympton,

Mr. Van Orton's attorney--

SCHUYLER

Let's go.  Seventh floor.

CUT TO:

BARNETT

Management company for the building

said this floor hasn't been rented.  We

checked with the Secretary of State and

the county recorder, there's no listing

of a "consumer research service."

PLYMPTON

Recreation service.

BARNETT

Right.  No sign of the boat or the

girl.  Divers got the cab's vehicle

ID, the company junked it a month ago.

GALLO

The numbers you gave us are

disconnected, sir, this was the only

address the phone company had.  And

we found your car-- it's in impound.

BARNETT

I'm a little confused as to motive

here.  You said your brother sent you

to these people...

SCHUYLER

It's not his fault, he's unstable,

he didn't know what he was doing--

BARNETT

And they were supposed to show you

a, a good time?

GALLO

(a cautioning look at Barnett)

My guess is this Feingold guy's

using an alias... is there anything

else you can tell us about him?

SCHUYLER

He likes Chinese food...

BARNETT

Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll

get these jokers.

CUT TO:

PLYMPTON

There's clearly a civil case once

we locate the defendant...

SCHUYLER

Whatever.

PLYMPTON

Y'know, Sky, things are quiet

since the closing-- you could take

some time off.

SCHUYLER

Oh, God--

ACTION HERO (on TV)

Don't touch that dial, Sky!

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Boy oh boy, you fucked up big-time!

Bringing in the cops-- real mistake!

SCHUYLER

No no no--

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Oh you're always so negative...

SCHUYLER

You people are insane...

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Hey, look who's talking to their

TV set.

SCHUYLER

How did you do this, how did you

get in here?

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Simple, we duped your keys the day you

came in for your physical, wired the

whole house while you were at work.

You rich people all have alarms, but

you never set 'em, do you?

SCHUYLER

Look, at least leave my brother

alone, he's fragile enough as it is--

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Don't worry about him, he's just

playing his own game-- at a more

advanced level, you might say...

SCHUYLER

You can't just fuck with people

like this, you don't know who

you're dealing with!

CRS-MAN (on TV)

(LAUGHS)

We know

exactly

who we're dealing

with, that's the whole idea!  For

a guy with your test scores,

you're pretty slow on the uptake.

SCHUYLER

What the fuck do you want from me?!

CRS-MAN (on TV)

Sky, I just came to say good-

bye... Too bad it didn't work

out, better luck next time.  Uh,

there might be a few loose ends

for you to tie up, but remember--

it's not whether you win or lose

that counts, it's how you play the

game... ya big loser you...

CRS-MAN (filter)

Ouch!  Take it easy, my hot-headed friend!

CRS-MAN (filter)

Holy smoke, this was an expensive TV--

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Now what?!

MANAGER (filter)

(beat)

Is this Schuyler Van Orton?

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Yeah, who's this?

MANAGER (filter)

I'm calling from the Claremont

Hotel in Berkeley... we have your

American Express card, you left it

at the check-in desk...

SCHUYLER (on phone)

What?  That's impossible, I've

never stayed there--

MANAGER (filter)

Are you sure, sir?

SCHUYLER

Son of a bitch.

CUT TO:

BELLHOP

Hello, Mr. Van Orton.

DESK CLERK

Mr. Van Orton.  Here's your credit

card... and the maid found this

under the bed...

SCHUYLER

That isn't mine.

DESK CLERK

It has your initials on it, sir.

DESK CLERK

We'd just as soon you took it with

you, in any event... and in the

future, you might consider

choosing another hotel for your...

SCHUYLER

I've never been here before in my life!

SCHUYLER

Jack... the woman you took home

the other night, where did you go?

JACK

(puzzled)

Out to Concord...

SCHUYLER

I know, what was the address?

JACK

Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I

think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but

didn't you-- never mind.

SCHUYLER

What?

JACK

Just-- I thought you followed us

there.  There was a black 500SE behind

us the whole way, I just assumed...

SCHUYLER

Shit.  Shit!  It wasn't me, Jack.

JACK

Of course, sir.  It was a white

house, I remember... big tree in

the front... with one of those,

you know, tire swings...

SCHUYLER

Jack, I'm serious.  It wasn't me.

JACK

It wasn't you, sir.

CUT TO:

IMPOUND WORKER

Triple A changed your tire... bad

blow-out was it?  Anyone hurt?

IMPOUND WORKER

Oh.  Just... we were a little curious

about the mess in the back...

SCHUYLER

A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a

car, I drove him to the vet...

(as the cop nods slowly)

Golden retriever, beautiful animal.

IMPOUND WORKER

(handing Sky a receipt)

He OK?

SCHUYLER

Too early to say.

CUT TO:

MR. KAMINSKY

Yes?

SCHUYLER

Mr. Kaminsky?  Schuyler Van Orton--

MR. KAMINSKY

Is that a name?  Look, I'm kinda busy.

(starts to close the door)

SCHUYLER

You have a daughter named

Christine?  I'm afraid she might

be in danger.

CHRISTINE (O. S.)

Daddy?  Who is it?

CHRISTINE

Sky?  Hi, Sky.

DAD

Well, I'm gonna get back to that

carburetor... nice meeting you.

CHRISTINE

I didn't think I'd-- what are you

doing here?

SCHUYLER

Last night, when Jack dropped you

off-- did anything happen?

CHRISTINE

No... unfortunately.

SCHUYLER

I thought-- eh, you don't wanna know.

CHRISTINE

Come on--

SCHUYLER

I thought they kidnapped you,

tortured you--

CHRISTINE

What?  Who?

SCHUYLER

CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a

tattoo on her shoulder like yours--

CHRISTINE

(touches her shoulder)

Ssh, my folks don't know about

that yet.  So, what-- they wanted

ransom from you or something?

SCHUYLER

No, I thought they were trying to

frame me, they planted evidence...

CHRISTINE

Why would they do that?

SCHUYLER

I have no idea, nothing they do makes any

sense.  Forget it, it's just a game.

CHRISTINE

So that's the only reason you came

out here to East Hell, your stupid

goddamn game.

SCHUYLER

I was worried about you.  I wanted to

see you again.

CHRISTINE

(thinks for a beat)

If you pretend to mean that, I'll

pretend to believe it.  Well, looks like

your pals are trying to keep us

together.  Buy me dinner at least?

SCHUYLER

Sure, why not.

CHRISTINE

(rises)

I look like a slob, let me change.

CHRISTINE

Can you get us into Chez Panisse?  I

always wanted to eat there--

SCHUYLER

Is that you?

CHRISTINE

(quick glance)

Mm-hmm, First Communion.

(touches his hair)

What's the matter, you look a

little green around the gills--

SCHUYLER

Don't touch me.

CHRISTINE

Don't be stupid.  Don't say anything,

not here, they're watching.

SCHUYLER

(sickened; to himself)

God damn it...

CHRISTINE

(back in character, accented)

OK, I know a good place we could

go and like, be alone...

CHRISTINE

It's a beautiful night, isn't it?

CHRISTINE

There's four of them in the van,

they're armed.  Just play along,

I'll get us out of here--

SCHUYLER

Fuck you.

(to surveillance camera)

OK, that's it, game over--

SCHUYLER (FILTER)

--you can come out now, assholes--

RASTA MAN'S VOICE

We're blown, let's do it--

CHRISTINE

You idiot!  Come on!

SCHUYLER

No, enough already.  I've had it.

SCHUYLER

Now what.

CHRISTINE

Get away from there!!

SCHUYLER

(steps toward her)

Oh, now I suppose they're going to--

SCHUYLER

Holy shit!!

SCHUYLER

What

is

this!?

CHRISTINE

God, wake up, it's a con game!

CHRISTINE

Watch out!!

CHRISTINE

OK, we lost 'em--

CHRISTINE

What are you doing!?

SCHUYLER

Get out of my car.

CHRISTINE

I coulda handed you to them!  They

find me now I'm dead--

CHRISTINE

Listen to me you bastard-- I know

what's going on!  No one else is

gonna tell you!

SCHUYLER

Get in.

SCHUYLER

You can talk while I drive to the

police station.

CHRISTINE

No cops, I got an outstanding warrant.

(off his look)

Mail fraud.  I'll get nailed, but

you'll never be able to prove a thing.

Just drive.

CUT TO:

CHRISTINE

Heard about this big swindle and--

I needed the money.  You wouldn't

know what that's like.

SCHUYLER

Spare me the snide comments.  And

please don't do that in here--

CHRISTINE

Second-hand smoke is the least of

your problems.

(blows it in his face)

Shit, they really screwed up, I can't

believe they didn't take the time to

get the house right.

SCHUYLER

Wait, how did-- before the game,

you

were

working in that bar--

CHRISTINE

They planted me in advance, your

brother set you up.

SCHUYLER

Oh God, David's in on it...?

CHRISTINE

It's not his fault, he thought it was

the only way out... just another victim.

SCHUYLER

How the hell did they think they

were gonna get my money?

CHRISTINE

Honey, they already got it.

CHRISTINE

You don't believe me, check your

bank accounts.  Listen, that night

in your office, remember?  I

downloaded files off your computer

while you were in the shower...

DISSOLVE TO:

CHRISTINE (V. O.)

I stuck in a code-breaking program

to glve CRS remote access to Van

Orton Group files...

CHRISTINE (V. O.)

--you'd already given them everything

else they needed.  Your handwriting,

voice samples, personal information, all

the tests you took... they used the data

to generate your passwords.

CHRISTINE (V. O.)

From there they just had to break into

the financial networks, transfer your

holdings into some dummy accounts--

CHRISTINE (V. O.)

Remember Jim Feingold, guy who

signed you up?  He's one of the

original hackers, did a five-year

stretch for zapping Citibank.

CHRISTINE (V. O.)

He's not some dweeb flunkie, he runs

the whole show.

CHRISTINE

I'm sorry.  They already did your

brother, I guess they figured you

for a family of suckers...

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Overseas operator?  Please dial the

number for Allgemeine Bank in Zurich...

CHRISTINE

Bet you haven't really been taking

care of business the past few days,

huh?  This "game," the psych shit

about your dad going sui...

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch...

CHRISTINE

All of it was just to buy time,

keep you from paying attention...

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I

consent to voice-print... My name

is Schuyler Van Orton.  I'd like

to know my balance, please... that

account is closed?!

CHRISTINE (nervously)

I think maybe you should pull over...

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Bob, listen carefully, this is an

emergency.  Feingold and his people,

I've called all my banks, they've

drained the accounts, personal and

corporate, everything-- tell the cops

I've got one of them with me, we'll

make her testify.  They're trying to

kill us, I'm heading for the island

in Oregon, if I can still find it.

Bob-- call when you get this message

and-- be extremely careful...

CLERK

They say I gotta confiscate your card...

CHRISTINE

I think I have some cash.

CHRISTINE

Money isn't everything, right?

SCHUYLER

It might be best if you didn't

speak.  I very nearly crushed your

skull just now.

CHRISTINE

C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a

couple hundred G's?  Chump change for a

guy like you, chalk it up to experience.

SCHUYLER

(quietly, restraining himself)

Just under a billion dollars.

CHRISTINE

A bil--?

(nervous laugh)

You're kidding, right?

SCHUYLER

Do I look like I'm kidding?

This is about more than my

personal lifestyle-- your pals

raided pension plans, charitable

foundations, company payrolls...

CHRISTINE

Oh my God--

SCHUYLER

I don't know what kind of jerk-off

con games you've played in the

past, but now you're in the big

leagues, hon.  You just helped

sabotage a small portion of the

national economy-- and destroy a

whole lotta lives.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

You're not having any?

CHRISTINE

Never drink it.  Makes my tits hurt.

SCHUYLER

Hold still.

SCHUYLER

Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned

in a while.  My dad built it himself,

spent a lot of time here alone.

(regards a LEAK)

Rotten carpenter...

CHRISTINE

Thank you.

CHRISTINE

What's so funny?

SCHUYLER

Just-- private joke...

CHRISTINE

Tell me.

SCHUYLER

Well... I always told myself I

wasn't gonna end up like him.  And

now here I am, running his

corporation, living in his house,

hiding in the cabin where he went

to hide right before he... I even

look like the bastard.

CHRISTINE

Not that much.

SCHUYLER

Mm, plus I'm a helluva lot more

gullible than he ever was...

SCHUYLER

Yes.

PLYMPTON (filter)

(careful, worried)

It's me, Schuyler... I got your message...

I'll admlt, I was very disturbed...

SCHUYLER

(hand over phone)

My, lawyer.

(to Plympton)

So.  What's our next move?

PLYMPTON (filter)

I've been on the phone all morning... your

funds are intact, nothing's changed,

there's been no activity whatsoever...

SCHUYLER

Wait-- that's not true--

PLYMPTON (filter)

(firmly)

It is true, no one is after your

money, no one is trying to hurt you--

CHRISTINE

He's in on it.

SCHUYLER

Oh, God...

PLYMPTON (filter)

Listen to me, Sky!

SCHUYLER

What are they paying you, Robert?

Piece of the action?

PLYMPTON (filter)

Schuyler!  Look, you've done the

right thing going up there, maybe

it's best if you just sit tight for

a while, forget about everything,

it's all under control--

SCHUYLER

We have to get out of here!

SCHUYLER

Well, that was stupid.

SCHUYLER

OK, they've gotten to him.  OK.

Is there anyone I can trust?

CHRISTINE

Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.

SCHUYLER

(a beat)

What do you mean?

CHRISTINE

It's out of your hands.

SCHUYLER

Christine!!

CHRISTINE

That's not my name.

SCHUYLER

Why...

CHRISTINE

We needed you to call your banks.

Cellular calls can be intercepted,

rerouted, y'know.

CHRISTINE

All those calls to Switzerland and

Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to

our people.  See, we were still

missing a lotta pieces-- access

codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton

didn't have-- but now we have

I everything.  I guess you are pretty

fucking stupid-- but thanks.

CHRISTINE

It's over.  Just let go...

CUT TO BLACK

SCHUYLER

What?

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

Where am I?!

SCHUYLER

Please, help me, I'm an American!

I'm lost!  Please!!

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

Hello.  Where am I?

DESK SERGEANT

Tegucigalpa.

(off Schuyler's blank look)

Tegucigalpa.  Tegucigalpa?

SCHUYLER

That's gibberish!

DESK SERGEANT

(annoyed)

It is the capital of Honduras.

SCHUYLER

Right.

DESK SERGEANT

So-- you have become, lost from,

from your father...?

SCHUYLER

My father's dead, God damn it.  I have

to get to the United States embassy.

DESK SERGEANT

Do you know what this says?

CUT TO:

WORKER

"I am an American.  I am an idiot.

My father is very rich.  If I

become lost, please take me to the

police.  There is a reward."

WORKER

Mr. Van Orton... is this a joke of

some sort?  What are you doing here?

SCHUYLER

I don't know.

WORKER

(a beat)

Well, without any identification it

will take at least a week to get you

a temporary visa--

SCHUYLER

(rising)

A week?!  Christ knows what they

can do in a week-- and what the

hell am I supposed to, to live

on?!  What day is it anyway?

(squints at his watch, thinks)

Where's the nearest pawn shop?

CUT TO:

PAWN SHOP OWNER

This will buy you a plane ticket.

SCHUYLER

Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my

passport...

SCHUYLER

Huh, close enough...

PAWN SHOP OWNER

I throw them in.

This man says he can help you...

DISSOLVE TO:

NURSE

The medication seems to be helping.

Unfortunately we're going to have to

transfer your brother to a public

institution in a few days, his funds

are entirely exhausted-- unless you're

prepared to take responsibility...

SCHUYLER

David...

DAVID

Hello Sky...

SCHUYLER

What are you doing here?

DAVID

Sorry, I was just eating...  I'm

much better.  Really.

SCHUYLER

Thank God... Listen, I know you put

them onto me-- but I understand,

we're both victims of this thing...

They've stolen everything we ever

had, they're trying to drive us both

crazy-- but we won't let them.

We'll find a way.  There's gotta be

a way to beat these bastards!  We're

in it together...

DAVID

In what together?

SCHUYLER

The game.

DAVID

Oh, Schuyler, there is no game.  It

was just a fantasy of mine, a self-

aggrandizing delusion... I can't

believe you took that shit seriously.

SCHUYLER

(clutching his hand)

No, David-- please...

DAVID

(pulling away)

Oh, man, stop fucking with me!

You know the game doesn't exist...

it never did!  It never did...

DAVID

Can you see?

CUT TO:

BARNETT

So the waitress was in on it--

SCHUYLER

She isn't really a waitress.

BARNETT

--and now you're brother's been

institutionalized... is there a history

of mental illness in your family?

BARNETT

'Scuse me.

BARNETT

Whatcha reading?

SCHUYLER

Nothing.

GALLO

I just spoke with his lawyer

Plympton, he thinks Van Orton's

having a nervous breakdown, we

should probably hold onto him till

his people can get down here...

ALARM MONITOR

Probably just your keys, sir--

BARNETT

Yo, Schuyler, wait up--

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

PUNK

End of the line, man.

SCHUYLER

Are the tattoos supposed to mean

something?

PUNK

(momentarily thrown)

Yeah, they mean you're dead, you

don't gimme what you got.

SCHUYLER

(touches the punk's arm)

OK, there's the C...

PUNK

Give me the fucking bag!

SCHUYLER

(cold, deadly)

Come on, you're not going to put

me through all this shit and then

kill me on a fucking train, it

won't look like a suicide...

TRANSIT COP

Freeze assholes!

PUNK

Psycho pulled a knife on me!

SCHUYLER

What do you think you're doing,

this guy attacked me!

TRANSIT COP

Wait here--

RADIO VOICE #1

--can't let him get away with this,

he's outta control!  The next thing

you know, he'll push the wrong

button and we'll all be dead--

RADIO VOICE #2

--Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a

moron, sure, but he doesn't have the

balls to end the world!  Anyway I'm

sicka talking politics, let's get back

to the business of nipple piercing--

RADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN)

Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is

the Howard Stern show...

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

Hello Elizabeth...

SCHUYLER

I'm sorry, I shouldn't be

bothering you-- you're a genuinely

good person, your work is

important, it's real, nothing that

happens to me is real anymore--

ELIZABETH

What has happened to you, Sky?

SCHUYLER

I need your help, you're the only

one left, the only one I can trust--

not that I deserve your help, God

how could you have even married me,

I was a shit to you--

ELIZABETH

No you weren't--

SCHUYLER

Yes I was.  Sometimes I think I'm

being punished for my sins, I

mean, there has to be a reason...

HIT."

SCHUYLER

This is one of their devices, I

pulled it off their assassin in

the subway.  It's how they

communicate with each other.

ELIZABETH

It's... a radio...

SCHUYLER

I can't find the right channel...

Listen, I may not make it through

this-- if anything happens, get that

notebook to, to, the press, or the

FBI or something.  Someone you can

trust, I don't know, assuming you can

trust

anyone

.  I just want you to

know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill

myself, no matter what they say--

SCHUYLER

Has this been opened?

BARMAID

No sir.  Just like you said.

SCHUYLER

I don't think coffee is safe.

ELIZABETH

Schuyler, try and listen to me.  I

love you, I always have, I always

will.  And maybe this is... good.

Maybe this a point you had to

reach, before--

SCHUYLER

(staring at her)

Before what?

ELIZABETH

Before-- I'm just glad you came to

me for help.  I don't know if I'm

strong enough to, to handle this

on my own but I know a lot of

excellent crisis people--

SCHUYLER

Crisis people.  Crisis people?

ELIZABETH

Hello?  Hi, hon, I'm OK... um,

could I call you back...?

SCHUYLER

You bastard!  You fucking bastard!

How did you find me here!?

FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)

Ooof-- my head is killing me!

SCHUYLER

Fuck you!

SCHUYLER

Who are

you

?

ACTRESS (ON TV, filter)

Honey, have you taken anything?

FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)

Sure, some aspirin--

SCHUYLER

He's an actor...

ELIZABETH

Of course he's an actor, it's a commercial.

SCHUYLER

(a revelation)

He's just a fucking actor...

FEINGOLD (ON TV, filter)

My head feels great!  Thanks to

Ambutol, I'll never use

aspirin

again!

ELIZABETH

Have you taken something?

SCHUYLER

What?

ELIZABETH

Are you on drugs?

ELIZABETH

Schuyler, I'm calling a friend

right now, I want you to wait here

with me until--

SCHUYLER

Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry,

I'II be alright, it's just been a

hard day... Listen, I gotta use

the restroom, be right back--

CUT TO:

SCHUYLER

He's an actor, does TV

commercials, I know he's ordered

from you, he had food delivered to

an office building on Mission--

CHINESE WOMAN

Many customers, very busy, I don't

know, I don't know--

SCHUYLER

Damn it!

CHINESE WOMAN

Stop that, what you doing?!

SCHUYLER (on phone)

Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's

short notice but we were hoping

your husband could come in for an

audition today, he's perfect...

SCHUYLER

Isn't there any way we can get in

touch with him now...?  I see...

SCHUYLER

Bill Fisher, hi!  I really admire

your work...

FEINGOLD

Oh please... I got my kids here...

SCHUYLER

Get rid of them.

FEINGOLD

(to the kids)

Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty!

Snack time!

FEINGOLD

Look, buddy, it was just a job--

nothing personal, y'know?  I play

my part, improvise a little,

that's what I'm good at, I still

do a little stand-up--

SCHUYLER

I've seen your resume.  I'm sick

of foot soldiers, I've gotta get

to whoever's in charge.

FEINGOLD

Of CRS?  Christ, nobody knows, nobody

gets the big picture--

(looking away)

Jason, Tommy, cut it out!

FEINGOLD

Goddammit, why do they do that.

SCHUYLER

How do I find them!?  Their

offices were abandoned--

FEINGOLD

They own the whole building, they

just move from floor to floor.

SCHUYLER

OK... They know you, you've worked for

them.  You're going to get me inside.

FEINGOLD

(shaking his head)

Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but--

SCHUYLER

Tell them anything, tell them the cops

are after you, you've gotta talk to

someone or you'll blow the whistle.

FEINGOLD

No way, it's too dangerous.

SCHUYLER

You don't seem to understand.  Right

here, right now--

I'm

the danger.

DISSOLVE TO:

FEINGOLD

We're here, Sky.  They said they're on

the twelfth floor.

SCHUYLER

Drive in, then.

FEINGOLD

Look-- what are you gonna do?  Really?

SCHUYLER

Really-- I don't know.  Improvise.  Go!

GATE GUARD

You're not authorized to be here.

GATE GUARD

Yo!

SECURITY MAN

You're a dead man.

CHRISTINE

What are you

doing

here?

SCHUYLER

I'm back from the dead.

CHRISTINE

Listen, everything's OK, nobody

touched your money, nobody stole a

thing, that's impossible--

SCHUYLER

I don't give a fuck about the money,

I wanna know who's behind this, who

did this to me, how, why--

CHRISTINE

It's just a game!

SCHUYLER

You're not going anywhere.

Feingold, or or Fisher, was that

just a game too?

CHRISTINE

What are you talking about?

SCHUYLER

I watched him die...

SCHUYLER

Seemed like a nice guy, actually,

father of three--

CHRISTINE

Well, look, I'm sure it's just

another stunt-- that can't be

real, taste it.

SCHUYLER

You taste it, you fucking vampire.

GATE GUARD

Could you come with us, please?

You're not authorized to be here.

SCHUYLER

Back off.  Everybody back off.

SCHUYLER

Shit, how do we get out--

CHRISTINE

Wait a minute.  What's that?

SCHUYLER

It's my gun...

CHRISTINE

We didn't give it to you?  Where did

it come from?

SCHUYLER

A gun store.

CHRISTINE

We searched your house!

SCHUYLER

Guess you fucked up again.

CHRISTINE

He's armed, he's got a real gun.

Real Situation, real--

SCHUYLER

Yeah, it's real all right.

CHRISTINE

Schuyler this is all

fake

, tricks,

it's all part of the game--

SCHUYLER

Stop it.  Every word out of your

mouth is a lie--

CHRISTINE

The key!!  They, we gave you a key

to the elevator!  Why would we do

that?!  We wanted you to come up--

SCHUYLER

Of course you did.  So you could kill

me or, or frame me for murder--

CHRISTINE

No, no, it's THE GAME!!  Blanks,

squibs, high-tech special effects,

none of it's real!  Just open that

door and I'll show you!

SCHUYLER

I open the door and I die.

SCHUYLER

You move again I swear I'll kill

you, you bitch.

CHRISTINE

THINK ABOUT IT!!  They followed you

every step of the way, the cab, in

the trunk, we had a diver--

SCHUYLER

They?  We?

CHRISTINE

--the guy in Honduras, the cop on

the train, there was always a

safety net, always--

SCHUYLER

Shut up, shut the fuck up!!

RADIO VOICE (filter)

--just hang in there, keep talking

him down, we're on our way--

CHRISTINE

We've been trying to end it since

you got back, our people came to

your house, they tried to bring

you in from the subway, you kept

running, you weren't supposed to

keep getting lost--

SCHUYLER

You just said you wanted me to

come here-- you're making this up

as you go along!

CHRISTINE

Please Sky, please.  Take a breath

and think about it!

SCHUYLER

Stop.  Fucking.  With my head!

CHRISTINE

You're all right, it's OK, just relax...

RADIO VOICE (filter)

Are you there?  How's he doing?

CHRISTINE

Please... when you open the door, the

game ends... just open the door... Bill

Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody

got hurt.  Why would we do the crazy

things we did, if it wasn't part of a

game?  We thought you

knew

that...

RADIO VOICE (filter)

--we're at the North entrance,

Number 2, just a few more seconds

and we'll nail him--

CHRISTINE

Oh God.  I blew it... we blew it...

FEINGOLD

You

shot

her!?  No!

(looking toward David)

Qh God no...

FEINGOLD

He fucking

shot

them!!

RASTA

I'll call an ambulance.

SCHUYLER

David, David, no, no--

DAVID

Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I

don't wanna die, I don't wanna--

SCHUYLER

You're not gonna die.  I'm here,

you're not gonna die...

FEINGOLD

Hang on, just hang on, you're

gonna make it--

CHRISTINE

That stupid...

FEINGOLD

Oh God.  I thought you could

handle it.  All the tests... they

said you could handle it...

CHRISTINE

You fucking psycho, you piece of

shit, how could you--

FEINGOLD

God, why-- there was no point.  It was

supposed to be fun...

SCHUYLER

Fun...

DAVID

SKY, NOOOO!!

DAVID

Hey, bro, how you doin'?

DAVID

Admit it, you weren't bored...

DAVID

Jesus.  Sky, c'mon Sky--

CUT TO:

DAVID

You've been wanting to do that for

a long, long time, haven't you?

DAVID

Like they'd really leave a loaded gun

lying around.  They went over the

whole place with a metal detector,

then packed that thing with blanks.

JOHN

Good one, buddy, really had you

going, didn't we?

PETE

Wait'll you try level two...

(a wink)

Joke.

RASTA

That look on your face up there?

Shit, man, I almost lost it.

RECEPTIONIST

Awesome game-- best I've seen.

FEINGOLD

Sure glad you jumped, compadre.

Otherwise I was supposed to throw

you off.

(whispering)

It's not strictly legal, so don't

tell anyone...

(a beat, off Schuyler's look)

The cigar.  It's a Monte Cristo,

straight from Havana.

CHRISTINE

Hey... you all right?

SCHUYLER

(nods slowly)

I think so.  You?

CHRISTINE

Little shook.  I'm pretty much a

method actress, y'know?

SCHUYLER

What's your name?

CHRISTINE

Susan.  Susan Waters.

SCHUYLER

Nice to meet you, Susan...

CHRISTINE

Can I have a puff?

SCHUYLER

Look, I have to know.  Who's

really in charge?

CHRISTINE

God?

PLYMPTON

What is this, Sky?  We got a call

from your brother, said there was

a surprise party...

ELIZABETH

Kind of late for your birthday,

isn't it?

ELIZABETH

If you wanted to borrow my car,

you could've just asked--

SCHUYLER

I know, Liz, I've been an idiot,

and I'm sorry...

PLYMPTON

You OK?

SCHUYLER

Yeah-- I'm good, really.  Happy to

be alive... Listen, it's great to

see all of you, thanks for coming--

but there's something I have to do.

Excuse me.

DAVID

So what's the object of the game?

SCHUYLER

(a beat)

What game?

DAVID

Very good...

SCHUYLER

(rinsing his hands)

Is it always like this?

DAVID

Mine was a little weirder.  Tell

you about it sometime.

DAVID

The bill.  It's itemized.  Don't

bother opening it now...

SCHUYLER

(opening it)

I thought it was a gift.

DAVID

Well, no, the

card

was the gift,

the rest was up to you.

SCHUYLER

What?  Where are we going?

CHRISTINE

Does it matter?

CUT TO BLACK
