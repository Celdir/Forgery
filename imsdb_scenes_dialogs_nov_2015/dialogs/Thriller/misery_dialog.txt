DISSOLVE TO:

SINDELL (O.S.)

What's that?

CUT TO:

PAUL

An old friend. I was rummaging through

a closet and it was just sitting

there. Like it was waiting for me.

CUT TO:

SINDELL

(searching for a

compliment)

It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got...

character.

CUT TO:

PAUL

When I wrote my first book, I used

to carry it around in this while I

was looking for a publisher. That

was a good book, Marcia. I was a

writer then.

SINDELL

You're still a writer.

PAUL

I haven't been a writer since I got

into the Misery business--

SINDELL

(holding up the cover

art of MISERY'S CHILD)

Not a bad business. This thing would

still be growing, too. The first

printing order on Misery's Child was

the most ever--over a million.

PAUL

Marcia, please.

SINDELL

No, no. Misery Chastain put braces

on your daughter's teeth and is

putting her through college, bought

you two houses and floor seats to

the Knick games and what thanks does

she get? You go and kill her.

PAUL

Marcia, you know I started "Misery"

on a lark. Do I look like a guy who

writes romance novels? Do I sound

like Danielle Steel? It was a one-

time shot and we got lucky. I never

meant it to become my life. And if I

hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd

have ended up writing her forever.

(touches his briefcase)

For the first time in fifteen years,

I think I'm really onto something

here.

SINDELL

I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really

am. But you have to know--when your

fans find out that you killed off

their favorite heroine, they're not

going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon

can finally write what we've always

wanted: An esoteric, semi-

autobiographical character study.

PAUL

(passionately)

Marcia, why are you doing this to

me? Don't you know I'm scared enough?

Don't you think I remember how nobody

gave a shit about my first books?

You think I'm dying to go back to

shouting in the wilderness?

(beat)

I'm doing this because I have to.

(Marcia is stopped)

Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try

to finish this and I want your good

thoughts--because if I can make it

work ...

(beat)

I might just have something that I

want on my tombstone.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(Their lips touch

again. Then--)

You hear me--Breathe! I said

breathe!!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

PAUL

(hardly able to whisper)

...where... am I...?

ANNIE

(so gently)

Shhh... we're just outside Silver

Creek.

PAUL

How long...?

ANNIE

You've been here two days. You're

gonna be okay.

(relieved)

My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--

PAUL

--my number one fan.

ANNIE

That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here.

(Now, as she brings

the pills close)

Take these.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Here.

PAUL

What are they...?

ANNIE

They're called Novril--they're for

your pain.

(helps him take them)

PAUL

Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

ANNIE

The  blizzard was too strong. I

couldn't risk trying to get you there.

I tried calling, but the phone lines

are down.

ANNIE

(Gently, her fingers

go to his eyelids,

close them)

Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've

got to rest, you almost died.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE (O.S.)

Open wide.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Your legs just sing grand opera when

you move, don't they?

(Paul says nothing,

but his pain is clear)

It's not going to hurt forever, Paul,

I promise you.

PAUL

Will I be able to walk?

ANNIE

Of course you will. And your arm

will be fine, too. Your shoulder was

dislocated pretty badly, but I finally

popped it back in there.

(proudly)

But what I'm most proud of is the

work I did on those legs. Considering

what I had around the house, I don't

think there's a doctor who could

have done any better.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

It's not nearly as bad as it looks.

You have a compound fracture of the

tibia in both legs, and the fibula

in the left leg is fractured too. I

could hear the bones moving, so it's

best for your legs to remain immobile.

And as soon as the roads open, I'll

take you to a hospital.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

In the meantime, you've got a lot of

recovering to do, and I consider it

an honor that you'll do it in my

home.

CUT TO:

SINDELL

This is Marcia Sindell calling from

New York City. I'd like to speak to

the Silver Creek Chief of Police or

the Sheriff.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Which one do you want?

SINDELL

Whichever one's not busy.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

I'm pretty sure they 're both not

busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're

both me. I also happen to be President

of the Policeman's Benefit

Association, Chairman of the

Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if

you need a good fishing guide, you

could do a lot worse; call me Buster,

everybody does, what can I do for

you?

CUT TO:

SINDELL

I'm a literary agent, and I feel

like a fool calling you, but I think

one of my clients, Paul Sheldon,

might be in some kind of trouble.

BUSTER

Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon

the writer?

SINDELL

Yes.

BUSTER

He's your client, huh?

SINDELL

Yes, he is.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

People sure like those Misery books.

SINDELL

I'm sure you know Paul's been going

to the Silver Creek Lodge for years

to finish his books.

BUSTER

Yeah, I understand he's been up here

the last six weeks.

SINDELL

Not quite. I just called, and they

said he checked out five days ago.

Isn't that a little strange?

BUSTER

I don't know. Does he always phone

you when he checks out of hotels?

CUT TO:

SINDELL

No, no, of course not. It's just

that his daughter hasn't heard from

him, and when he's got a book coming

out, he usually keeps in touch. So

when there was no word from him...

BUSTER

You think he might be missing?

SINDELL

(shakes her head)

I hate that I made this call--tell

me I'm being silly.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Just a little over-protective, maybe.

(beat)

Tell you what--nothing's been reported

out here--

(he puts Paul Sheldon's

name with a ? on a 3

x 5 CARD)

--but I'll put his name through our

system.

(he tacks the card to

a bulletin board)

And if anything turns up, I'll call

you right away.

CUT TO:

SINDELL

I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

G'bye, Ms. Sindell.

VIRGINIA

We actually got a phone call. Busy

morning.

BUSTER

(smiles)

Work, work, work.

(gives her a hug)

Virginia? When was that blizzard?

VIRGINIA

Four or five days ago. Why?

CUT TO:

BUSTER

(a beat)

...no reason...

CUT TO:

PAUL'S VOICE

(soft)

I guess it was kind of a miracle...

you finding me...

ANNIE

No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in

a way, I was following you.

PAUL

Following me?

ANNIE

(explaining, normally)

Well, it wasn't any secret to me

that you were staying at the Silver

Creek, seeing as how I'm your number-

one fan and all. Some nights I'd

just tool on down there, sit outside

and look up at the light in your

cabin--

(gently moves his

head back, exposing

his neck; this next

is said with total

sincerity, almost

awe)

and I'd try to imagine what was going

on in the room of the world's greatest

writer.

PAUL

Say that last part again, I didn't

quite hear--

ANNIE

(smiles)

Don't move now--wouldn't want to

hurt this neck--

(shaving away)

Well, the other afternoon I was on

my way home, and there you were,

leaving the Lodge, and I wondered

why a literary genius would go for a

drive when there was a big storm

coming.

PAUL

I didn't know it was going to be a

big storm.

ANNIE

Lucky for you, I did.

(pauses)

Lucky for me too. Because now you're

alive and you can write more books.

Oh, Paul, I've read everything of

Yours, but the Misery novels...

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I know them all by heart, Paul, all

eight of them. I love them so.

CUT TO:

PAUL

You're very kind...

ANNIE

And you're very brilliant, and you

must be a good man, or you could

never have created such a wondrous,

loving creature as Misery Chastain.

(runs her fingers

over his cheek)

Like a baby.

(smiles)

All done.

(starts to dab away

the last bits of

soap)

PAUL

When do you think the phone lines'll

be back up? I have to call my

daughter, and I should call New York

and let my agent know I'm breathing.

ANNIE

It shouldn't be too much longer.

(gently)

Once the roads are open, the lines'll

be up in no time. If you give me

their numbers, I'll keep trying them

for you.

(suddenly almost

embarrassed)

Could I ask you a favor?

(Paul nods)

I noticed in your case there was a

new Paul Sheldon book and...

(hesitant)

and I wondered if maybe...

(her voice trails off)

PAUL

You want to read it?

ANNIE

(quietly)

If you wouldn't mind.

PAUL

I have a hard and fast rule about

who can read my stuff at this early

stage--only my editor, my agent, and

anyone who saves me from freezing to

death in a car wreck.

ANNIE

(genuinely thrilled)

You'll never realize what a rare

treat you've given me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Boy, it's like clockwork, the way

your pain comes--I'll get you your

Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling

away and making you feel all oogy.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

What's your new book called?

PAUL

I don't have a title yet.

ANNIE

What's it about?

PAUL

(fast)

It's crazy, but I don't really know,

I mean I haven't written anything

but "Misery" for so long that--you

read it you can tell me what you

think it's about. Maybe you can come

up with a title.

ANNIE

(in the doorway)

Oh, like I could do that?

CUT TO:

LIBBY

Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's

leaving, Buster--you can tell by the

champagne.

BUSTER

Maybe you can, Libby.

LIBBY

No, see, he always ordered a bottle

of Dom Perignon when he was ready to

go. Then he'd pay up and be out the

door.

BUSTER

No long-distance phone calls, Federal

Express packages--anything at all

out of the ordinary?

LIBBY

(head shake)

I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for

things to be out of the ordinary.

Considering who he is and all, famous

and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives

the same car out from New York each

time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him

think. He was always a good guest,

never made a noise, never bothered a

soul. Sure hope nothing happened to

him.

BUSTER

So do I...

LIBBY

I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling

into New York right now.

BUSTER

I'm sure you're right.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(almost shy about

this)

I know I'm only forty pages into

your book, but...

PAUL

But what?

ANNIE

Nothing.

PAUL

No, what is it?

ANNIE

Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to

make a criticism to someone like

you?

PAUL

I can take it, go ahead.

ANNIE

Well, it's brilliantly written, but

then everything you write is

brilliant.

PAUL

Pretty rough so far.

ANNIE

(a burst)

The swearing, Paul.

(beat)

There, I said it.

PAUL

The profanity bothers you?

ANNIE

It has no nobility.

PAUL

Well, these are slum kids, I was a

slum kid, everybody talks like that.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

They do not. What do you think I say

when I go to the feed store in town?

"Now, Wally, give me a bag of that

effing pigfeed and ten pounds of

that bitchly cow-corn"--

CUT TO:

ANNIE

--and in the bank do I tell Mrs.

Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard

of a check, give me some of your

Christing money."

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(seeing the spill,

suddenly upset)

There! Look there! See what you made

me do!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Oh, Paul, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Sometimes I get so worked up. Can

you ever forgive me? Here...

ANNIE

I love you, Paul.

(more embarrassed

than ever)

Your mind. Your creativity--that's

all I meant.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

This sure is fun.

BUSTER

(removing it)

Virginia, when you're in this car,

you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

VIRGINIA

Well, this deputy would rather be

home under the covers with the

Sheriff.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUSTER

(suddenly)

Stop--stop right here.

VIRGINIA

What? What is it?

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Look at that broken branch there...

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

Could be the weight of the snow.

BUSTER

Could be--or a rotten branch or a

mountain lion could have landed on

it. Could be a lot of things.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

Anything down there?

BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah. An enormous amount of snow.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

(they move to the car)

You really think Sheldon's out there?

BUSTER

Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's

go to the newspaper office.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake

you.

PAUL

It's fine.

ANNIE

They had it at the store, Paul, there

was a whole batch of them there. As

soon as I saw it, I slammed my money

down. I got the first copy.

PAUL

Then the roads are open...

ANNIE

The one to town is, but that's about

it. I called the hospital and talked

to the head orthopedic surgeon. I

told him who you were and what had

happened. He said as long as there's

no infection, you're not in any

danger, and as soon as the road to

the hospital is open, they'll send

an ambulance for you.

PAUL

The phones are working?

ANNIE

Well, mine's still out. But the ones

in town were working just fine. I

called that agent of yours.

(soft now)

Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very

beginning.

(looks at him)

What a wonderful first page--just to

read the name Misery Chastain...

PAUL

My daughter must be going nuts.

ANNIE

...it's like a visit from my oldest,

dearest friend.

PAUL

I was supposed to be home for her

birthday three days ago.

ANNIE

Your agent said she would tell her

you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll

have to wait until tomorrow if you

want to speak to her yourself.

ANNIE

(She looks at him now

with almost a look

of amazement)

Oh, Paul, what a poet you are...

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNIE

I made you my speciality--scrambled

eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page

75.

PAUL

I guess that means it's okay.

ANNIE

No. No, it isn't, it's--

(halts)

--oh pooh, I can't think of any words.

Would "great" be insulting?

PAUL

I can live with "great."

ANNIE

(as she turns, goes)

No, it's not just great, it's perfect,

a perfect, perfect thing.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I'm up to page 185. I always get sad

when I pass the halfway point. Will

you do me a favor? I'd love it if

you would autograph my copy. I already

have your autograph on a picture,

but it would mean so much to me to

get it in person. I know you're right-

handed, so don't worry if it's not

so legible. I'll cherish it anyway.

ANNIE

I don't mean to pry, but I've read

in two magazines now where you were

seeing this model who does those

disgusting jeans commercials. And I

said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon

would never waste his time with a

trampy woman like that.

PAUL

Well, you can't believe everything

you read in magazines.

ANNIE

I knew it. I knew it wasn't true.

Boy, how do they get away with

printing stuff like that?

PAUL

You'd be amazed at what some people

will believe.

ANNIE

Thank you so much.

PAUL

My pleasure.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I thought it was time you two should

meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite

beast in all the world, my sow,

Misery.

PAUL

Misery?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Yes. I told you I was your number-

one fan.

PAUL

I'm getting to believe you.

ANNIE

This farm was getting kind of dreary,

what with just the few cows and

chickens and me--

(happy)

But when I got Misery here, everything

Changed--she just makes me smile so.

PAUL

She's a fine... uh... pig is what

she is...

ANNIE

(scooping up the pig,

holding it tight as

she stands by Paul)

I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul,

and it's better than perfect--it's

divine. What's the ceiling that dago

painted?

PAUL

The Sistine Chapel?

ANNIE

Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those

are the only two divine things ever

in this world...

ANNIE

Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

When my husband left me... I wasn't

prepared, it wasn't an easy time...

ANNIE

For a while I thought I might go

crazy.

PAUL

I know how that can be.

ANNIE

I don't know about you, but what I

did to get through it was I dove

into work--days, nights--night shifts

can be lonely at a hospital. I did a

lot of reading. That was hen I first

discovered Misery. She made me so

happy. She made me forget all my

problems.

(She smiles now)

'Course, I suppose you had a little

something to do with that too.

PAUL

Yeah, well...

ANNIE

(She isn't)

I just kept reading them over and

over. I know when I finish this one--

and I've only got two chapters to go--

I'll just turn right to the front

page and start reading it again.

PAUL

I'm...

ANNIE

(She turns around,

moves to the bed)

Done?

PAUL

Yeah, thanks.

ANNIE

No problem.

ANNIE

Don't get me wrong. I'm not against

marriage per se. But it would take a

pretty special guy to make me want

to go down the aisle again.

PAUL

Well, it's not something you should

enter into lightly.

ANNIE

It boils down to respect. People

just don't respect the institution

of marriage any more. They have no

sense of real commitment.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I'd love to stay here and chat, but

I'm right at the end and I gotta

find out what happens.

PAUL

Well, I hope you like it.

ANNIE

Of course I'll like it. Misery's

about to have her child. What's it

gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't

tell me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

You...you dirty bird. She can't be

dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead!

How could you?

PAUL

Annie, in 1871, women often died in

childbirth, but her spirit is the

important thing, and Misery's spirit

is still alive--

ANNIE

(screaming)

I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER!

And you MURDERED her!

PAUL

I DIDN'T...

ANNIE

Then who did?

PAUL

No one--she just died--she slipped

away, that's all.

ANNIE

(screaming)

She slipped away? She slipped away?

She didn't just slip away. You did

it. You did it. You did it. You did

it. You murdered my Misery.

ANNIE

I thought you were good, Paul, but

you're not good, you're just another

lying old dirty birdie and I don't

think I better be around you for

awhile.

(she crosses to the

door, then stops)

And don't even think about anybody

coming for you, not the doctors, not

your agent, not your family--because

I never called them. Nobody knows

you're here. And you better hope

nothing happens to me because if I

die, you die.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

BUSTER

No, Ms. Sindell, there's no point in

coming up here now. Everything that

can be done is... Yes, we're working

closely with the state police, and

the FBI has been informed. Right...

Right... As soon as we know anything

we'll let you know. No, it's no

bother. Call anytime. Bye, Ms.

Sindell.

VIRGINIA

Here's the list of all Sheldon's

credit charges. Nothing after the

Silver Creek.

(With a glance at his

dour face, she

indicates the photo)

Any calls?

BUSTER

Just from his agent.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

What are you doing on the floor?

(crossing to the bed)

It's my fault. If I'd had a proper

hospital bed, this never would have

happened. Here, let me help you back

in.

(She lifts him back

into the bed, which

causes considerable

pain)

I know this hurts, but it'll only

take a few seconds. There you go.

Comfy?

PAUL

(in pain)

Perfect.

ANNIE

You're such a kidder. I have a big

surprise for you. But first there's

something you must do.

PAUL

I don't suppose I could have a little

snack while I wait for the

surprise?

ANNIE

I'll get you everything you want,

but you must listen first. Sometimes

my thinking is a little muddy, I

accept that. It's why I couldn't

remember all those things they were

asking me on the witness stand in

Denver.

ANNIE

But this time I thought clearly. I

asked God about you and God said "I

delivered him unto you so that you

may show him the way."

PAUL

Show me the way?

ANNIE

Yes.

CUT TO:

PAUL

When I mentioned a snack, I was

thinking more along the lines of a

cheese and crackers kind of thing.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Paul, this is no time for jokes. You

must rid the world of this filth.

PAUL

You want me to burn my book?

ANNIE

(she nods)

Yes.

PAUL

You want me to burn my book?

ANNIE

I know this may be difficult for

you, but it's for the best.

PAUL

This isn't difficult, my agent's

made dozens of copies. There's gonna

be an auction on this, and every

publishing house in New York is

reading it now. So if you want me to

burn it, fine. You're not ridding

the world of anything.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(quietly)

Then light the match, Paul.

PAUL

No big deal.

ANNIE

So you've indicated. Do it.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I know this is the only copy, Paul.

When you were twenty-four you wrote

your first book and you didn't make

a copy, because you didn't think

anybody would take it seriously. But

they did. And ever since you've never

made any copies because you're

superstitious--it's why you always

come back to the Silver Creek Lodge.

You told that story to Merv Griffin

eleven years ago.

PAUL

You know, Annie, this book never

would have survived without you.

When it gets to new York, there will

be a big auction, and whatever it

brings we can split.

(pause)

God knows you're entitled to it.

ANNIE

Oh, Paul. This isn't about money.

It's about decency and purity. It's

about God's values.

PAUL

You're right. You're right. I don't

know what I was thinking. I'll tell

you what. It doesn't have to be

published. Nobody ever has to see

it. I'll just keep it for myself. No

one will ever have to know it exists.

ANNIE

As long as it does exist, your mind

won't ever be free. I think you should

light the match, Paul.

ANNIE

Can't you see it's what God wants?

ANNIE

You're so brilliant. I would think

you'd certainly be able to see that.

(More drops fall on

the bed)

We're put on this earth to help

people, Paul. Like I'm trying to

help you.

ANNIE

Please let me help you.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

You're doing the right thing, Paul.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(crying out)

Goodness!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUSTER

(pointing out)

That's the Steadman place up there.

(The pilot nods. Buster

points again)

The only other place up here is the

Wilkes farm.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing

else out this way--circle on back.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I do believe the winters are getting

shorter and shorter every year. People

say it has something to do with the

ozone layer. What do you think?

PAUL

I don't know.

ANNIE

Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's

your Novril.

(she wheels the

barbecue to the door;

Great. I've always wanted to visit

the other side of the room.

ANNIE

And look what I've got for you. An

electric razor so you can shave

yourself now.

PAUL

If I knew this was gonna be the

surprise, you could've gotten me to

burn all my books.

ANNIE

(She hands him some

Novril)

Now don't josh. This is a very big

day for you, Paul. Here. You just

sit tight, and I'll set everything

up.

CUT TO:

PAUL

Set what up?

ANNIE

That's the big surprise. Your new

studio--after all, writers do need a

place to work.

PAUL

Work? You mean write? What in the

world do you think I'd write?

ANNIE

Oh, but Paul!

(flushed)

I don't think, I know! Now that you've

gotten rid of that nasty manuscript,

you can go back to doing what you're

great at--

(beat)

--you're going to write a new novel--

your greatest achievement ever--

Misery's Return.

CUT TO:

PAUL

(after a beat)

Misery's Return?

ANNIE

I know you didn't mean it when you

killed her, and now you'll make it

right.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Yes. It will be a book in my honor.

For saving your life and nursing you

back to health. I'll be the first

one to read it.

(beat)

Oh, Paul, you're going to make me

the envy of the whole world...

CUT TO:

PAUL

You just expect me to whip something

off, that it?

ANNIE

(nods)

I expect nothing less than your

masterpiece.

PAUL

You do understand that this isn't

the ordinary way books get written--

I mean, some people might actually

consider this an oddball situation.

ANNIE

I have total confidence in your

brilliance--besides, the view will

inspire you.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

You just inhale that. I'll be right

back.

CUT TO:

PAUL

(calling out)

I guess you don't get bothered by

neighbors much.

ANNIE

Don't worry about that. You'll have

total solitude so you can concentrate

on your work.

PAUL

Great.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I got you this expensive paper to

type on.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(putting the rest of

the paper on the

table)

And I got a great deal on this fifty-

pound clunker--on account of it's

missing an "n." I told the saleslady

"n" was one of the letters in my

favorite writer's name.

PAUL

It's two of the letters in my favorite

nurse's name, Annie.

ANNIE

(embarrassed, blushing)

You--fooler...!

(turns, grabs up pens,

pencils, paper)

Did I do good?

PAUL

(gesturing to the box

of paper)

You did great, except there's just

one little thing--I can't work with

this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it

smudges. Maybe you could go back

into town and bring me some white,

long-grained mimeo.

ANNIE

But mine cost the most so I don't

see how it could smudge.

PAUL

(quickly taking a

sheet of paper, making

a pencil mark on it)

C'mere, I'll show you.

ANNIE

(looking at it)

Well, it does smudge after all--isn't

that fascinating?

PAUL

I thought you'd be interested. I'd

like you to be in on everything,

Annie. Not just the finished book,

but how it's written.

ANNIE

Thank you for thinking of me.

(She can be so charming

when she wants)

Anything else I can get while I'm in

town? Any other crucial requirements

that need satisfying? Would you like

a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a

handmade set of writing slippers?

PAUL

No, just the paper will be fine.

ANNIE

(suddenly very agitated)

Are you sure? 'Cause if you want,

I'll bring back the whole store for

you.

PAUL

Annie, what's the matter?

ANNIE

What's the matter? I'll tell you

what's the matter. I go out of my

way for you. I do everything to try

and make you happy. I feed you, I

clean you, I dress you. And what

thanks do I get? "You bought the

wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on

this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get

your stupid paper, but you just better

start showing me a little more

appreciation around here, Mister

Man.

ANNIE

Paul, you're dripping with

PAUL

You know goddamn well what I've been

doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE

SUFFERING. I need my pills.

ANNIE

(tenderly, as she

starts toward him)

Poor dear... Let's get you back in

bed and I'll get them for you.

PAUL

(exploding--a real

child's tantrum)

I want my pills NOW!

ANNIE

It'll only take a second.

PAUL

I want my pain to go 'way, Annie--

make it go 'way, please Annie--

(She looks at him--

you can't tell if

she's buying it or

not)

--please...

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(upset)

It just breaks my heart to see you

like this...

ANNIE (O.S.)

(coming closer)

I've done a lot of thinking on the

drive...

CUT TO:

ANNIE

...and I'm absolutely convinced that

the main reason I've never been more

popular is because of my temper. You

must be so mad at me. The truth now.

PAUL

Well, I don't  hold grudges. After

all, who doesn't let off a little

steam once in a while.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

My genius needs his rest before he

writes.

ANNIE

Here, in case you think of any ideas.

PAUL

Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too

much.

ANNIE

Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant.

Think of me as your inspiration.

STATE POLICE CHIEF

The presumption must now be that

Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he

somehow crawled out of his car. But

we have been unable to locate his

body in the vicinity of the crash.

We also know if anyone had found

him, they would have taken him to an

area hospital. His body is undoubtedly

out there buried somewhere in the

snow. We'll find him after the first

thaw--unless the animals have gotten

to him first.

(beat)

I'll take questions.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

You don't think he's dead, do you?

BUSTER

He might well be. But not the way

they say. He didn't crawl out of

that car by himself. You saw those

dents on the door--someone pulled

him out.

VIRGINIA

It was an old car--those dents could

have been there forever.

BUSTER

There's two kinds of people that

drive around in old cars: the ones

that can't afford new ones, and the

ones who wouldn't give 'em up for

anything in the world. That second

bunch don't drive around with twenty-

five-year-old dents.

What? What happened to "I'll treasure

ANNIE

Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw

it all out except for the part of

naming that gravedigger after me.

You can leave that in.

PAUL

I really value your criticism, but

maybe you're being a little hasty

here.

ANNIE

Paul, what you've written just isn't

fair.

PAUL

--not fair?

ANNIE

That's right--when I was growing up

in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in

all the world was to go to the movies

on Saturday afternoons for the chapter

plays...

PAUL

(it just comes out)

--cliff-hangers--

ANNIE

(suddenly angry)

I know that, Mister Man--they also

call them serials. I'm not stupid,

you know.

(and she's a child

again)

Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man,

and once it was a no-brakes chapter,

the bad guys stuck him in a car on a

mountain road and knocked him out

and welded the doors shut and tore

out the brakes and started him to

his death and he woke up and tried

to steer and tried to get out, but

the car went off a cliff before he

could escape and it crashed and burned

and--I was so upset and excited and

the next week you better believe I

was first in line and they always

start with the end of the last week

and there was Rocket Man trying to

get out, and here came the cliff and

JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped

free and all the kids cheered--

(standing up now)

--but I didn't cheer, I stood right

up and started shouting, "This isn't

what happened last week--have you

all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED

US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"

ANNIE

"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE

CAR!"

PAUL

They always cheated like that in

cliff--

(stops himself)

--chapter plays.

ANNIE

But not you. Not with my Misery.

Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary

at the end of the last book, but his

horse fell jumping that fence and

Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs

and lay there all night in the ditch

so he never reached the doctor, so

there couldn't have been any

"experimental blood transfusion"

that saved her life. Misery was buried

in the ground at the end, Paul, so

you'll have to start there.

PAUL

Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden

for an editor, here.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

What's the matter, Paul? You haven't

written a word.

PAUL

I can't write this anymore.

ANNIE

Don't be silly. Of course you can.

PAUL

I'm telling you, I can't.

ANNIE

You can--you have the "gotta"--

PAUL

The what?

ANNIE

The "gotta." Remember, you talked

about it in Playboy magazine. You

said there's a million things you

can't do in this world; you can't

hit a curve ball, you can't fix a

leaky faucet or make a marriage work--

but there's one thing you always

have, and that's the power of the

"gotta."

PAUL

I said that?

ANNIE

You said you can make it so they

gotta turn the page. You know, "I

'gotta' know will she live," "I

'gotta' know will he catch the

killer." "I gotta see how this chapter

ends." You said it. I don't usually

buy that magazine. I only got it,

'cause they were interviewing you.

CUT TO:

PAUL

(quietly)

What about a bee...?

ANNIE

What?

PAUL

Nothing.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL

Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?

ANNIE

You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian

realized that the reason they'd buried

Misery alive was because the bee

sting had put her in that temporary

coma--

CUT TO:

ANNIE

--and when Gravedigger Wilkes

remembered how thirty years earlier,

the same thing had happened to Lady

Evelyn-Hyde--

(hands clasped)

--and then old Dr. Cleary deduced

that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's

long-lost daughter because of the

rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart

just leapt.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I've known from the very first book

that Misery had to be born of nobility

and I was right!

PAUL

(mumbling  to himself)

Yeah, yeah...

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter

when you finish? I can fill in the

"n"s.

(Paul nods, and she's

off again)

Will she be her old self, now that

Ian has dug her out, or will she

have amnesia...?

PAUL

...have to wait.

ANNIE

Will she still love him with that

special perfect love?

PAUL

Have to wait.

ANNIE

(plead ing)

Not even a hint?

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh,

it's so romantic--this whole house

is going to be filled with romance.

I'm going to put on my Liberace

records--

(Stops, looks at Paul)

--you do like Liberace, don't you?

PAUL

(quickly)

Whenever he played Radio City, who

do you think was right there in the

front row?

ANNIE

I'm going to play my records all day

LONG

--to inspire you--he's my all-time

favorite.

PAUL

Annie?

PAUL

Would you have dinner with me tonight?

PAUL

To celebrate Misery's return. I

couldn't have done it without you.

ANNIE

Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.

PAUL

Jesus Christ.

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA

(into phone)

No, he's not here. I don't know where

he went. He never tells me anything

anymore. He's probably out having an

affair somewhere. Wait a minute. I

think I hear him coming.

VIRGINIA

(to Buster)

It's Jim Taylor. He wants to know

who you've been having an affair

with.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh-

huh... Jim, we've been over this. If

you're gonna have benches in front

of your store, people are gonna sit

on them. I don't like him either,

but I'm not going to come over there

and tell him to move. Give my best

to Denise. Bye.

VIRGINIA

(looking through the

books; all paperback

Misery novels)

Well, whoever she is, she sure likes

to read a lot.

BUSTER

Virginia, I'm flattered you think I

got that much energy. I just figured

if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at

least I can find out what he wrote

about.

VIRGINIA

What do you expect to find? A story

about a guy who drove his car off a

cliff in a snowstorm?

BUSTER

Now, you see, it's that kind of

sarcasm that's given our marriage

real spice.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I hope you like it.

PAUL

It looks wonderful. And so do you.

ANNIE

Oh...

PAUL

I've never had meatloaf this good,

what do you do to it?

ANNIE

My secret is I only use fresh

tomatoes, never canned. And to give

it that little extra zip, I mix in

some Spam with the ground beef.

PAUL

Oh.

(pause)

You can't get this in a restaurant

in New York.

PAUL

Annie, I think we should have a toast.

ANNIE

A toast?

PAUL

Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some

more wine.

ANNIE

To Misery.

PAUL

Wait, let's do this right. Do you

have any candles?

ANNIE

Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll

go look.

PAUL

Did you study decorating, or do you

just have a flair?

ANNIE

Oh, you. I just picked things up

over the years.

PAUL

Well, it certainly says you.

ANNIE

You really think so?

PAUL

Absolutely. Listen, if you can't

find any, it's okay. I just thought

it might be nice.

ANNIE

Are you kidding? If anyone ever told

me that one day I'd be having a

candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon

in my own house, I woulda checked

both legs to see which one was being

pulled. Will this do?

PAUL

It's perfect.

PAUL

To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who

brought her back to life.

ANNIE

Oh, Paul, every time I think about

it, I get goosebumps.

ANNIE

(wiping up the spilled

wine with her napkin)

Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so

sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful

toast. Will you ever forgive me?

Here, let me pour another one.

(she does)

Can we pretend this never happened?

To Misery?

PAUL

To Misery.

But now I know I love the rest of

him too. As much as Misery loves

Ian.

(beat)

I know you don't love me--don't say

you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant,

famous man of the world; and I'm...not

a movie star type. You'll never know

the fear of losing someone like you

if you're someone like me.

PAUL

Why would you lose me?

ANNIE

The book is almost finished. Your

legs are getting better. Soon you'll

be able to walk. You'll be wanting

to leave.

PAUL

Why would I want to leave? I like it

here.

ANNIE

That's very kind of you, but I'll

bet it's not altogether true.

It is.

Paul, my little ceramic penguin in

PAUL

I don't know what you're talking

about.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Is this what you're looking for? I

know you've been out twice, Paul. At

first, I couldn't figure out how you

did it, but last night I found your

key.

(She holds up the

bobby pin)

I know I left  my scrapbook out, and

I can imagine what you might be

thinking of me. But you see, Paul,

it's all okay.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Last night it came so clear. I realize

you just need more time. Eventually,

you'll come to accept the idea of

being here. Paul, do you know about

the early days at the Kimberly Diamond

Mine? Do you know what they did to

the native workers who stole diamonds?

Don't worry, they didn't kill them.

That would be like junking a Mercedes

just because it had a broken spring--

no, if they caught them they had to

make sure they could go on working,

but they also had to make sure they

could never run away. The operation

was called hobbling.

PAUL

Annie, whatever you're thinking about,

don't do it.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Now don't fuss, Paul.

PAUL

Why would I run away? I'm a writer,

Annie--it's all I am--and I've never

written this well--even you said

that this is my best, didn't you?

PAUL

Didn't you? Why would I leave a place

where I'm doing my best work? It

doesn't make any sense.

Shh, darling, trust me--

PETE

We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three

BUSTER

You wouldn't happen to remember if

Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

PETE

Are you kidding? Every time that

Paul, don't you think it's time for

you to start writing again? It's

I don't know, it's weird, but a couple

of broken bones hasn't done a lot

for my creative juices. Get the fuck

out of here.

ANNIE

Don't talk to me like that.

Why, what are you going to do?

wide)

Kill me? Take your best shot.

Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be-

Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner,

Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.

Guess you can tell from my reaction,

I'm not all that used to visitors

out here. What can I do for you?

BUSTER

I was just wondering if you happen

to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

ANNIE

(stammering)

What do you want to know?

BUSTER

Anything you can tell me might help.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Well, he was born in Worcester,

Massachusetts, forty-two years ago,

the only child of Franklin and Helene

Sheldon, mediocre student, majored

in history...

CUT TO:

BUSTER

(cutting in)

Excuse me, that's not exactly the

kind of information I was after. You

see, he's been missing for quite

some time now, and...

ANNIE

I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his

number-one fan...I've got all his

books, every sentence he ever put

down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon

collection...

(stops suddenly, almost

embarrassed)

...here I am, prattling on and my

manners have just flown away. I

haven't invited you in. Please.

BUSTER

Thank you.

ANNIE

'Course you must know about that

horrible accident.

ANNIE

Almost killed me, too. I prayed when

I heard the news. I got down on my

knees and begged for it not to be

true.

ANNIE

You're going to laugh at what I'm

about to say, but go ahead, I don't

care...

(beat)

...when I was praying, God told me

to get ready.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Get ready for what?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

To try and be his replacement--he

gave so much pleasure to so many

people and there's a shortage of

pleasure on this planet these days,

in case you hadn't noticed.

ANNIE

God told me, since I was his number-

one fan, that I should make up new

stories as if I was Paul Sheldon.

So, went to town. And I bought a

typewriter. And paper to type on.

The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And

I turned the guest bedroom into a

writing studio. Would you like to

see it?

BUSTER

Sure.

ANNIE

It's right this way.

ANNIE

It's right here. I knew how he wrote,

the kinds of words he used, the

wonderful stories he told--

(moved)

--I've spent the last four weeks

trying to write like Paul Sheldon.

(sad shake of the

head)

But I can't do it right. I try and I

try and I know all the words--

(eyes closed in despair)

--but it's just not the same.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Well...

(long pause)

...maybe it takes time to get the

hang of it.

ANNIE

(holding up pages

from the manuscript)

I could give you a couple of hundred

pages of mine, and you could tell me

what you think.

BUSTER

I'm not much of a critic.

ANNIE

Well, I just thought--oh, look at

me. You'd think I'd never had a house

guest before. Would you like something

to drink?

BUSTER

Sure.

ANNIE

How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

BUSTER

Sounds good.

ANNIE

There's some already made.

BUSTER

Must get lonely, living out here all

by yourself.

ANNIE

I always say if you can't enjoy your

own company, you're not fit company

for anyone else.

BUSTER

You got a point there...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Here you are.

BUSTER

Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want

to take up any more of your time. I

best be going.

ANNIE

But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

BUSTER

I'm sure it's wonderful, but really

should be getting back.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUSTER

If you don't mind, perhaps I could

pay you another visit sometime.

ANNIE

I'd be delighted. Now that you know

the way...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

BUSTER

Miz Wilkes?

CUT TO:

PAUL

(weakly)

Here. I'm down here. Down here.

CUT TO:

BUSTER

Mr. Sheldon?

ANNIE

Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to

happen. I've been waiting for this

sign.

ANNIE

I've known for some time why I was

chosen to save you. You and I were

meant to be together forever. But

now our time in this world must end.

But don't worry, Paul. I've already

prepared for what must be done. I

put two bullets in my gun, one for

you and one for me. Oh, darling, it

will be so beautiful.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Now don't be afraid. I love you.

PAUL

I know you do. I love you too, Annie.

(this stops her)

And you're right. We are meant to be

together. And I know we must die.

But it must be so that Misery can

live. We have the power to give Misery

eternal life. We must finish the

book.

ANNIE

But the time is now. Soon others

will come.

PAUL

It's almost done. By dawn we'll be

able to give Misery back to the world.

ANNIE

Here, Paul. I'll fix you something

to eat.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.

PAUL

Three more chapters to go.

ANNIE

The stranger staying at the Inn, is

he someone from Misery's past?

PAUL

Maybe.

ANNIE

This is so exciting. It's Windthorne,

her first love, right?

PAUL

Maybe. Are you ready for the next

chapter?

ANNIE

(brimming with

enthusiasm)

Oh you!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

(more excited now

than the last time)

It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what

does that do to her love for Ian?--

(thinks)

--of course, if she hadn't thought

Windthorne was murdered she never

would have fallen in love with Ian

in the first place.

(Paul glares at her,

she turns to the

door)

Sorry, it's just that this is so

wonderful.

PAUL

I'm glad you like it.

ANNIE

Paul, this will be our legacy.

PAUL

It will.

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind

up with Ian or Windthorne? You have

to tell me.

PAUL

You'll know very soon. I'm starting

the last chapter. And when I finish,

I want everything to be perfect.

I'll require three things.

ANNIE

What things?

PAUL

You don't know?

ANNIE

(smiling)

I was fooling, silly.

(ticking them off)

You need a cigarette, because you

used to smoke but you quit except

when you finish a book, and you just

have one, and the match is to light

it. And you need one glass of

champagne.

(thinks)

Dome Pear-igg-non.

PAUL

Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PAUL

(calling out)

Annie! Annie!

ANNIE

Yes, Paul.

PAUL

I'm almost done.

ANNIE

Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian

and Windthorne dueling for the right

to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh,

don't me. It's Windthorne, right?

PAUL

You'll know everything in a minute.

Get the champagne.

ANNIE

(dying from the

suspense)

Ahh!!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Did I do good?

PAUL

You did perfect. Except for one thing.

This time we need two glasses.

ANNIE

Oh, Paul.

CUT TO:

PAUL

It's all right here, Annie. Remember

how for all those years no one ever

knew who Misery's real father was,

or if they'd ever be reunited? It's

all right here. Will Misery finally

lead her countrymen to freedom? Does

she finally marry Ian or will it be

Windthorne? It's all right here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

Paul, you can't.

CUT TO:

PAUL

Why not? I learned it from you...

CUT TO:

ANNIE

No, no, NOT MISERY--NOT MY MISERY...!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANNIE

I'm going to kill you, you lying

cocksucker...

PAUL

Here. Here. You want it? You want

it? You can eat it--eat it--eat it

till you fucking CHOKE--you sick,

twisted fuck.

CUT TO:

YOUNGER COP

It's the writer--the dead one--

PAUL

(trying to keep himself

together)

--right! I'm the dead one--

OLDER COP

Where's Sheriff McCain?

PAUL

He's in the cellar. She killed him.

OLDER COP

Annie Wilkes?

PAUL

Yeah. She's in there.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

OLDER COP

Mr. Sheldon? There's no one in there.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

PAUL

Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball

game went into overtime. If anybody

ever told me I'd have a daughter

who'd get a triple double, I'd...

SINDELL

Did they win?

PAUL

Yeah. They're in the semis.

SINDELL

Here it is.

(big moment)

Very first copy.

CUT TO:

SINDELL

The word I'm getting is the Times

review is gonna be a love letter.

PAUL

That'd be a first.

SINDELL

And my contacts at Time and Newsweek

tell me they're both raves. And don't

laugh--for the first time, I think

you've got a shot at some prizes.

PAUL

(flatly)

Great.

SINDELL

I thought you'd be thrilled. You're

being taken seriously.

PAUL

I'm delighted the critics are liking

it, and I hope the people like it,

too. But it's not why I wrote the

book.

CUT TO:

PAUL

I like it. Remember how you once

said I live my whole life as if I'm

in danger of being found out? Well,

I believe I've managed to get that

guy down on paper.

(He touches the book.

Beat.)

Don't think I'm completely nuts, but

in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole

experience, helped me.

SINDELL

Paul, since you brought her up, I

have to ask you this, or I'd be

drummed out of the agents' union--

what about a non-fiction book? The

truth about what went on in that

house.

PAUL

Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you

better, I'd think you were suggesting

I dredge up the worst horror of my

life just so we could make a few

bucks.

SINDELL

Now you've hurt me, Paul.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SINDELL

I thought you were over it.

PAUL

I am. Well, maybe not completely--

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PAUL

I don't know if you can ever be

totally over something like that--I

just don't think about it as much

anymore, and when I do, it's not so

terrifying.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PAUL

I mean, once they found her body, my

nightmares stopped.

CUT TO:

WAITRESS

Would you care for anything?

PAUL

(smiles)

Cut me something sinful...

CUT TO:

FINAL FADE OUT:

THE END
