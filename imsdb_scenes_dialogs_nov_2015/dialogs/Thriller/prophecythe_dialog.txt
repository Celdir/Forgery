SHOOTING DRAFT

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

GARGOYLE

Where is it?

SIMON

Leave me alone.

GARGOYLE

You've found it, haven't you?

SIMON

Fuck you.

DISSOLVE TO:

THOMAS DAGGET

Hey.

BURROWS

Hey.

DAGGETT

(looks up at sky)

Thought those clouds this morning

spelled rain for sure, but it's turned

into a beautiful day, wouldn't you

say, Sergeant Burrows?

BURROWS

I warned you about that cheerful

shit.

DAGGETT

Sorry. I'm working on it.

DAGGETT

What's the word?

BURROWS

Friend here did a half-gainer with a

firebird tuck from the third floor.

DAGGETT

Jumper?

BURROWS

Not unless he decided not to bother

opening the window first.

DAGGETT

Drugs? Alcohol?

BURROWS

Well, he wasn't exactly in a condition

to walk a chalk line when we got

here. You're welcome to try and smell

his breath if you like, that is if

you can find the mouth.

DAGGETT

Ghouls been by?

BURROWS

On their way. Willie promises a white

paper tomorrow. Or Wednesday,

depending on his golf game.

DAGGETT

Firebird driver?

BURROWS

Mr. Jiminez. Was taking a short cut

to his job at a packing plant on San

Pedro. First thing he remembers about

the deceased is several vital organs

bouncing off his windshield.

DAGGETT

Have you had him walk a chalk line?

BURROWS

He's straight. Shook up some.

DAGGETT

(looking at gargoyle)

Anything on him?

BURROWS

No wallet, license, nothing. He is

missing one or two things, though.

DAGGETT

Like?

BURROWS

His eyes.

DAGGETT

(looking at tangled

mess)

Along with everything else.

BURROWS

We've found everything else -- and

what fun that was, let me tell you --

but the eyes are still AWOL. Might

just be stuck in the radiator grill.

Little weird though.

DAGGETT

What?

BURROWS

Both popping out together like that.

Worth a page in my scrapbook.

DAGGETT

Who's the room registered under?

BURROWS

John Smith.

DAGGETT

Anything interesting inside?

BURROWS

There are, what an intelligent,

experienced detective like yourself

could possibly construe as signs of

a struggle.

BURROWS

Naturally nobody saw or heard

anything.

DAGGETT

In such a fine establishment as this?

BURROWS

Ku San's on fourteenth is still open

for another hour. Whatd'ya say we

pull out the 'ol "SUICIDE" rubber

stamp and get some lunch. Rancid

chow mein and watered beer for under

three bucks.

DAGGETT

(looking at floor)

There's glass in the carpet.

BURROWS

That usually happens when you break

a window.

DAGGETT

It's on the inside.

DAGGETT

Where's Chimney Rock?

BURROWS

Arizona desert, I think. Which is

exactly where I'm going to be in two

years, three months.

DAGGETT

And give up all this?

BURROWS

You're breaking my heart.

DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

SIMON

Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...

KATHERINE

Hey bright eyes, what's the deal

being out here all alone without a

coat?

MARY

Someone's here.

KATHERINE

Where?

MARY

Pig out on all the cake?

KATHERINE

Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny

piece left, but you're gonna have to

race me for it.

MARY

What's that?

MARY

Ha!

KATHERINE

You little sneak!

DISSOLVE TO:

LT.

How's it going?

DAGGETT

I was just looking for my "SUICIDE"

rubber stamp.

LT.

Sorry about leaving you without a

partner. Everything's up in the air

till the commission settles their

manpower budget.

DAGGETT

I'm okay.

(his phone rings)

Dagget... It's done already?

(smiles)

Must have rained over the golf course

this morning. I'll be right over.

DAGGETT

Hey, Willie, sorry to hear about the

weather.

DAGGETT

Should I bother sitting?

CORONER

Sit.

CORONER

Where would you like me to start?

DAGGETT

I think we can skip the cause of

death.

CORONER

All right. To begin with, your man

has no eyes.

DAGGETT

Weren't stuck in the radiator grill?

CORONER

No, he never had any eyes. We checked

the sockets. There's no optic nerve,

muscle pores, loose viscus, nothing.

DAGGETT

Huh.

CORONER

We also did a toxicology on his blood:

High sodium, elevated selenium, no

floating cholesterol platelets, trace

ammonia.

DAGGETT

Something wrong with that?

CORONER

No, it's actually pretty common --

for an aborted fetus.

DAGGETT

(rubs eyes)

I should have listened to Burrows...

CORONER

We also did a bone section. Wasn't

that much trouble since most of them

were sticking out of his chest anyway.

DAGGETT

And?

CORONER

When babies grow up their bones get

larger by adding calcium layers over

the interior haversham canals. Child

growth isn't uniform though, comes

in spurts that always leave growth

rings in the bone. Everybody has

them -- except your man. That would,

to a hasty observer, seem to indicate

he had never been a child.

DAGGETT

I assume you, a cautious and learned

observer, of course have an

explanation.

CORONER

Not even remotely. Want to hear the

last one?

DAGGETT

Not even remotely.

CORONER

He's a hermaphrodite.

(Thomas stares at him)

-- Has both male and female sex

organs.

DAGGETT

Think of the possibilities.

CORONER

Yeah, you can be impotent and frigid

all at the same time -- they don't

normally work.

DAGGETT

Well, I'd love to say thank you, but --

CORONER

Oh, I also have a bonus prize for

you.

CORONER

Found this sealed in his coat lining.

DAGGETT

It's a bible.

CORONER

A pretty old one, I think.

CORONER

We checked it out inside. Thought

there might be a name or fingerprint

somewhere. All we found was a curled

page marking the fourteenth chapter

of St. John's Revelations.

DAGGETT

There is no fourteenth chapter to

Revelations.

CORONER

Maybe this is the teacher's edition.

DAGGETT

Can I keep this awhile?

CORONER

Sure.

DAGGETT

(beat)

Can you sit on all this a few days,

Willie? Not circulate the file? I

need some time before all the

questions start.

CORONER

Oooh, are we breaking the rules again?

DAGGETT

So what else is new?

DISSOLVE TO:

KATHERINE

In a minute, in a minute...

JOHN

You could save my life with some

coffee.

KATHERINE

Tough night?

JOHN

You don't want to hear about it.

(peeks out hopefully)

Or maybe you do.

KATHERINE

No thanks.

JOHN

Just checking.

KATHERINE

Shouldn't they be getting to school?

JOHN

Impromptu field trip. I'm broadening

their minds. And sparing them the

sight of their beloved chauffeur

barfing his guts out.

JOHN

I hate horses. How was the canyon?

Honey-suckle out yet?

KATHERINE

Didn't see any.

JOHN

I hate that canyon. I hate this this

whole plateau. Too many goddamn

ghosts. Leave it to them I say. San

Diego, that's where I'm going. Or

Oxnard. I like the sound of that. Ox-

nard.

KATHERINE

I'm happy here.

JOHN

Oh lord protect us, another romantic

pale face in love with the desert.

KATHERINE

Just got to give it a chance.

JOHN

Try growing up here.

(tries word out on

tongue)

Ox-nard.

(sticks out coffee

cup)

Uno mas, see-boo-play.

(she pours)

Speaking of romantic pale faces, the

rumor mill is in high gear again.

KATHERINE

Who this time?

JOHN

That funny looking guy from Window

Rock. The BIA lawyer.

KATHERINE

(non-committal)

Huh.

JOHN

No! Say it isn't so!

KATHERINE

It isn't so.

JOHN

Thank you.

JOHN

Thanks for the joe.

KATHERINE

No prob.

JOHN

You're a credit to the community.

JOHN

All right children, looks sharp!

This is a school day! And no talking

loud!

DISSOLVE TO:

KATHERINE

This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus

was a herbavore, which meant he only

ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly

to himself and never bothered anyone.

KATHERINE

This is a leg fragment that belongs

to the killer of the plateau,

Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious

carnivore, which meant he'd eat

anything that moved, especially nice,

juicy Camposaurs.

KATHERINE

Both these guys lived together right

here on the White Rock plateau eighty

million years ago, when this area

used to be on the banks of a huge,

shallow sea. Remember how we talked

about how sedimentation fossilizes

bones? That's also what made the

hills out behind our town and put

the copper in the ground.

HIGH SCHOOL KID

Lot of good that did us.

BOY

It's radioactive! Like Godzilla!

KATHERINE

Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know

why? Uranium, that's the rock they

use in nuclear power plants --

BOY

And bombs!

KATHERINE

And bombs Alex, yes, is all through

these hills naturally. Millions of

years ago the dinosaurs here ate

plants and drank water which had

uranium in it that became concentrated

in their bones, which is exactly

how, with Mr. Geiger counter here,

we're going to find some.

KATHERINE

(coming between them)

-- Hey. Come on. What's the deal,

Brian?

BRIAN

She...

KATHERINE

Yes?

BRIAN

...She, she called me a "Dick Head".

KATHERINE

Sandra?

SANDRA

Well, he is.

KATHERINE

All right, Brian. You get one free

insult. Make it good.

PAUL

You... You're a... Cow Demon!

KATHERINE

(beat)

Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied?

(looks at Brian)

Cow Demon?

MARY

I got one! I got one!

KATHERINE

Easy... Easy... Don't break it.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BOY

I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss

Henley.

KATHERINE

Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.

BOY

(looking at book over

her shoulder)

Find out what it is, yet?

KATHERINE

Well, it's either a 44 million year

old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr.

Sorenson lost last winter.

KATHERINE

Go eat your lunch, Jason.

BOY

Sure, Miss Henley. Thanks. See ya.

MARY

Hi.

SIMON

Hi.

MARY

What's your name?

SIMON

Simon.

MARY

You don't look so good, Simon.

SIMON

No, I don't.

MARY

I'm Mary.

SIMON

Hello Mary.

MARY

Does Miss Henley know you're here?

SIMON

No one does, Mary. Can we keep it

just our secret. For a little while?

MARY

Okay.

MARY

I have to go.

SIMON

It was nice meeting you, Mary.

MARY

Are you hungry? I could bring

something.

SIMON

That would be very nice.

MARY

Okay. Bye.

DISSOLVE TO:

GABRIEL

Gee Jerry, you look like shit.

JERRY

Leave me alone, Gabriel.

GABRIEL

Soon, pal. Soon.

GABRIEL

Come here.

JERRY

Go away.

GABRIEL

(sing-song, like to a

baby)

Come here...

GABRIEL

Hmmm. Still a little life left in

you. Barely.

JERRY

Fuck you.

GABRIEL

There's something I want you to do

for me.

JERRY

What a surprise.

GABRIEL

Don't be that way.

JERRY

I just want to... Why won't you let

me...

GABRIEL

I will, I will. Promise.

GABRIEL

You need some new clothes, son.

GABRIEL

Aw come on, don't start. You know

how I hate that...

JERRY

I'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired.

GABRIEL

Watch the profanity. -- Just one

more favor. Honest.

JERRY

(deep sigh)

What?

GABRIEL

I want you to get something for me.

A few personal effects the cops ripped

off from the lovely Allenwood Arms

on Seventh Street. It'll be sitting

in their property room down on San

Julian.

JERRY

I'm supposed to just go in there?

Like this?

GABRIEL

Give you a bath, put on some decent

clothes,

(beat)

Maybe a very large brim hat, you'll

be fine. Just go in between five and

five-ten, it's a shift change and

nobody'll notice you.

JERRY

How do you know?

GABRIEL

(cocks an eye)

C'mon.

(tosses yellow ID

card onto table)

This should be more or less up to

date.

JERRY

Got a name this stuff is under?

GABRIEL

John Doe.

JERRY

Why doesn't that surprise me.

GABRIEL

I'll see you tonight.

(flips him silver

dollar)

Here's some bus fare.

CUT TO:

PLAYER

Cover me! Cover me!

DAGGETT

Pop it up!

DAGGETT

Thanks a lot.

PLAYER #2

You're missing the point of the game,

Thomas. You must absolutely trust no

one. Form alliances, but break them.

Lure another to trust you, then betray

him! You play with too much honor.

Sink to the gutter. Use people. Lie

and double-cross them.

PLAYER #2

Come on Thomas, let's take out Sam

together!

PLAYER #2

Magnificent decadence.

PLAYER #1

The important thing, Tom, is seeing

the game for what it is.

PLAYER #2

A sickening, hopeless, giant sucking

hole of depravity.

PRIEST #1

See ya guys next Tuesday, huh?

BILL

So how's work?

DAGGETT

Okay. Y'now.

BILL

Life on the dark side.

DAGGETT

(beat)

Can I ask you about something?

BILL

Sure.

DAGGETT

It has to stay between us. I need

your word on it.

BILL

As a racquetball player or a priest?

DAGGETT

I'll take the priest for the moment.

BILL

What's on your mind?

DAGGETT

It's a case. We found this guy. He

was... different. But he had on him

an old bible.

BILL

It's a Vichini.

DAGGETT

Worth a little?

BILL

More than a little. They're the best.

Sixth century. Hand illuminated.

Vichini only did twenty, each pocket

size for a king to carry into battle

beside his heart. Some consider them

the finest bibles ever made. I thought

they'd all be in museums. What are

you doing with it?

DAGGETT

This one's a bit special.

BILL

How?

DAGGETT

It's has a bonus chapter to St, John's

Revelations.

BILL

Really? What does it say?

DAGGETT

(reading from slip of

paper)

"And as in the first war, the angels

so fought over the nature of their

God, and there was much vanity and

destruction in heaven. For some angels

called their Lord the son of God,

and others called Him the begotten

father of Jesus Christ." What do you

think?

BILL

I've never heard that quote before.

Theologically, The "first war"

obviously refers to the war in heaven

where Michael the archangel threw

out Satan and his gang. Old time

bible stuff. But this implies there

was a second war. That's news to me.

DAGGETT

And the rest of it?

BILL

Oh, it's a fairly common theological

debate. Or was. The idea that if

Christ is God's son, does that make

him less than God or are they the

same being in different forms. That

very argument almost tore the early

Christian church apart in the 4th

Century. That was the good old days

when people actually worried about

theology. Anyway, it was settled

when the bishops of the world got to

together at the Council of Nicene in

325 and hashed out the various

interpretations of scripture into a

uniform dogma of belief. The result

was the Nicene Creed, which basically

said that Christ was in fact the

same as God and was owed the same

power and respect as the Father.

That they were the same.

(smiles)

But it's not exactly the sort of

thing angels would fight over.

DAGGETT

Why?

BILL

Well, they could just ask God, right?

DAGGETT

Do you think it's possible that John

might have written that extra chapter?

BILL

Who knows? Vichini was the greatest

biblical scholar of the age, some

claimed he made his own translations

from the original writings. Maybe he

did find some unknown writings by

John. It's possible I suppose. John

always was a little negative about

angels. All this actually has

something to do with an LAPD murder?

DAGGETT

I don't know yet. Maybe. Probably

not.

BILL

I hate to break it you, but that

particular family spat has been

settled for 1,600 years. Nobody loses

sleep over it anymore. Honest.

DAGGETT

What did John have against angels?

BILL

Oh, he didn't trust them much. All

that running around smiting and

killing in the name of the Lord.

God's wild bunch. He thought it made

them fickle and vain. One click above

ghosts. Satan didn't help the image

much either.

DAGGETT

Satan?

BILL

Well, he did start as an angel.

BILL

So when are you going to get a real

job?

DAGGETT

You mean with the Church?

BILL

You almost did it once. I never saw

a seminary student more called to

the collar than you. Why didn't you

ever become ordained?

DAGGETT

It's a long story.

BILL

You'll have to tell it to me sometime.

DAGGETT

Sometime.

GUARD

Need a pass, friend.

GABRIEL

I'll just be a second.

GUARD

C'mon...

GABRIEL

Sorry.

DISSOLVE TO:

KATHERINE

Brian, have you seen Mary?

BRIAN

I think she's out back somewhere.

KATHERINE

(to girl)

Allison?

ALLISON

We haven't seen her since lunch.

KATHERINE

We're you guys up in the...

KATHERINE

Okay everybody, get started on today's

reading. Quietly. I'll be right back.

KATHERINE

I mean quiet.

KATHERINE

(calls out)

Mary...

KATHERINE

Mary...

(to herself)

Shit.

KATHERINE

Mary?

KATHERINE

Mary, come here.

MARY

But Simon and I were --

KATHERINE

Come here.

KATHERINE

Go back to class.

MARY

But --

KATHERINE

Go.

SIMON

She wasn't doing any harm.

KATHERINE

It's not her I'm worried about.

SIMON

Of course.

KATHERINE

What are you doing here?

SIMON

Small job. Mostly done now. Just

passing through.

KATHERINE

This is school property, you can't

sleep here.

SIMON

It wasn't part of the plan. Honest.

KATHERINE

(notices blood stains)

Are you all right?

SIMON

No. Not really.

KATHERINE

I'll have to call the police.

SIMON

I wish you wouldn't, but I understand.

KATHERINE

They'll help you.

SIMON

Oh, I rather doubt that.

MARY

Hi.

SIMON

Hello. I thought you'd left.

MARY

I hid. I'm very clever.

SIMON

I'm sure you are.

(beat)

You were nice to give me the food.

MARY

I know.

SIMON

I haven't much time, Mary. And since

you've been so nice to me, there's

something I'd very much like to give

to you.

MARY

What?

SIMON

Just for a little while. Something

very special. Can you keep it a

secret? The biggest secret ever?

MARY

Yes. What is it?

SIMON

Come here, Mary.

SIMON

Closer...

CUT TO:

MARY

I don't feel good...

KATHERINE

What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you

eat something?

(concerned beat)

Did he give you something?

MARY

Can I go home now?

KATHERINE

Sure, hon. Let's go.

KATHERINE

I'll have the school send over a

doctor.

KATHERINE

(on the phone)

...He's was just laying up there. I

thought, with the kids and

everything...

VOICE

Most of my boys are up the highway

on a tanker spill at the moment.

They may be a while. These people

are rarely any problem. I'll have a

deputy come by tonight or tomorrow

and shoo him out.

KATHERINE

He looked hurt.

VOICE

They all do, ma'am. Inside or out,

they're all damaged goods.

DISSOLVE TO:

DAGGETT

Yeah.

VOICE

It's your friendly coroner.

DAGGETT

Why is my friendly coroner, after a

long day at work, calling me at home?

VOICE

I have something you'll want to see.

DAGGETT

I doubt it.

VOICE

No, you'll definitely want to see

this.

CORONER

They also took the autopsy file.

DAGGETT

"They"?

CORONER

He, she, it. They took it. They also

lifted all the physical evidence

from the San Julian impound.

DAGGETT

Where was everyone?

CORONER

The cop at the desk is in the hospital

as we speak with a broken collarbone.

Everyone else was down the hall

watching the basketball playoffs.

DAGGETT

Who won?

CORONER

Temple.

DAGGETT

Lucky.

CORONER

Yeah. Foul on the buzzer.

DAGGETT

Looks like the snow angels we used

to make as kids. Lie down in a clean

bank. Move your arms up and down...

CORONER

You know what this means. Our friend's

cleaned out all the evidence on this

guy. Everything.

DAGGETT

Did the cop get a look at who nailed

him?

CORONER

Tall. Smiled a lot.

DAGGETT

Anything else?

CORONER

He wore sunglasses.

CORONER

You gonna figure this one out, Tom?

DAGGETT

I'm going to try.

CORONER

When you do, give me a call. Tell me

I'm not crazy.

GABRIEL

You like the desert, Jerry?

JERRY

You promised. You promised that --

GABRIEL

-- Soon. Honest. Don't be a pest

about it.

JERRY

(sighs)

Never trust a fucking angel.

GABRIEL

Excellent advice.

LT. PAUL

Do you ever have one of those

afternoons where you feel no one's

giving you a straight answer about

anything?

DAGGETT

Oh, maybe five or six times a week.

LT. PAUL

(reading sheet)

It says here somebody got into the

property warehouse and cleaned

everything out of your evidence box.

No, he did leave one thing. A

footprint. 11-D.

DAGGETT

Mud on his shoes?

LT. PAUL

Spinal fluid.

LT. PAUL

I'm not going to get a straight answer

out of you either, am I?

DAGGETT

Not yet.

DAGGETT

I need to go to Arizona.

LT. PAUL

For your health?

DAGGETT

So I can give you a straight answer.

LT. PAUL

Sure, why not? Take the kids. See

the Grand Canyon. Send me a fucking

postcard.

DAGGETT

Sorry.

LT. PAUL

I've got a headache, Tom, and I hate

my life. If you have to go, go.

DISSOLVE TO:

JERRY

Why do you need me? I can hardly

walk now.

GABRIEL

Some things are human work, son.

Live or dead, human work. Besides, I

like you.

JERRY

Lucky moi.

GABRIEL

I can always smell a graveyard.

JERRY

I hope you're enjoying this.

GABRIEL

I always enjoy watching you work,

Jerry.

JERRY

How did I ever get you in my life?

GABRIEL

Come on, you didn't really want to

kill yourself.

JERRY

But I did it, didn't I? I did kill

myself.

GABRIEL

Well, yes. Technically.

JERRY

And you're just keeping me alive.

GABRIEL

Letting you die slower.

JERRY

I'm so in your debt.

GABRIEL

Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.

JERRY

Not much to look at.

GABRIEL

Ah, but it's not what's on the outside

that matters --

GABRIEL

-- It's what's on the inside.

GABRIEL

(upset)

It's not here.

GABRIEL

It's not here!

JERRY

Oooh, bad news for the war effort.

GABRIEL

(spins wildly on him)

Shut up!!

GABRIEL

Now, if you were a soul, where would

you hide?

JERRY

The hell away from you.

CUT TO:

FEMALE VOICE

Hey little brother.

DAGGETT

(smiles)

Hey. How's the world?

VOICE

The world's the usual. Except for a

guppy. the world's minus one guppy

this morning.

DAGGETT

And Jamie and Mac?

VOICE

They keep asking for Uncle Tommy.

The only man that can make stuffed

bears talk.

DAGGETT

My one true calling. What's up?

VOICE

What do you mean?

DAGGETT

It's five-thirty in the morning.

VOICE

(beat)

I just thought I should call.

DAGGETT

You always were telepathic.

VOICE

Don't go.

DAGGETT

It's my job, Jan. I go places

sometimes.

VOICE

I just had this terrible feeling

about it. What's happening, Tom?

DAGGETT

I don't know.

VOICE

I miss you. Even when you're here. I

miss you. I miss my brother. It's

been four years, Tom, since...

DAGGETT

I know.

VOICE

We're the only blood family we have

left, you and me. I worry about you.

DAGGETT

I'll be okay.

VOICE

Sorry about the dawn-attack call. I

love you.

DAGGETT

I love you too, Jan.

GABRIEL

Boy, what a dump, huh?

GABRIEL

Why can't this shit ever go down in

Miami? Or Bora Bora? I feel like

I've spent my whole damn stay in gin

swills like this.

JERRY

Life's a bitch.

GABRIEL

Well well...

GABRIEL

Hi, Simon.

SIMON

Gabriel.

JERRY

Don't mind me. Just along for the

ride.

GABRIEL

So, what shall we talk about?

Theology?

SIMON

I'm a little talked out on theology.

GABRIEL

Fair enough...

GABRIEL

You know why I'm here.

SIMON

Oh yes.

GABRIEL

Don't happen to have it on you by

chance?

SIMON

No.

GABRIEL

That would have been too easy.

GABRIEL

Please, Simon. Get serious.

GABRIEL

Now. Where's the soul?

(beat)

You know. So high. Used to reside in

the recently departed General

Hawthorne.

GABRIEL

Have it your way, big guy.

SIMON

I do have one question.

GABRIEL

Shoot.

SIMON

Do you even remember what this war's

about?

GABRIEL

That's hardly the point, is it?

SIMON

I guess I never did get the point.

GABRIEL

Happens.

SIMON

How do you do it, Gabriel? How do

you go on and on in this place?

GABRIEL

I like it here, Simon. I always have.

SIMON

I'm so tired...

GABRIEL

Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene

Council. We were here first.

SIMON

I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even

know why anymore, but I can't.

GABRIEL

You know the routine.

SIMON

(swallows hard)

Yes.

GABRIEL

Not yet.

GABRIEL

I can do this for five months,

Simon...

DISSOLVE TO:

GABRIEL

This is getting boring, Simon.

JERRY

Amen.

GABRIEL

Where is it!

I'm just about out of tricks here.

You're a tough one, friend. Old

KATHERINE

Mary...

KATHERINE

(to grandmother)

How is she?

GRANDMOTHER

Same.

KATHERINE

Did the doctor come by?

GRANDMOTHER

He found nothing. But something is

in her. I know. Something the

Belagaana doctor can't see. The night

people have been around two days

now. It is a warning.

(nods to Navaho man)

So we have called the hand trembler.

To find if she must have an Enemy

Ghost Way.

SHERIFF

And to what do I owe the thrill of a

visit from a So Cal homicide cop?

DAGGETT

Run of of the mill psycho killer

body dismemberment on our end. The

usual.

SHERIFF

Lovely place, Los Angeles.

DAGGETT

Got a lead I wanted to run down

Chimney Rock way. Thought I'd do the

courtesy of telling you first.

SHERIFF

Big of you.

DAGGETT

You're welcome to put a babysitter

on me if you like.

SHERIFF

Son, this is the third biggest county

in the country, not even counting

the 25,000 square mile Indian

reservation right next door, and

I've got fewer men than just one of

your little palm tree precincts to

cover all of it. 'Fraid the only

help you're gonna get from me, short

of another shoot out at the OK Corral,

is that cup of coffee in your hand.

A middle-aged secretary enters with

a stack of paper.

SECRETARY

Here's the last week's watch reports.

SECRETARY

Bobby just called this in from Chimney

Rock.

SHERIFF

(to Thomas)

Sent a car up there this morning.

Teacher complained some vagrant was

sleeping in her schoolhouse.

SHERIFF

(to secretary)

Damn it, get Bobby on the phone,

Clarice. What the hell is this suppose

to be?

DAGGETT

(re report)

May I?

DAGGETT

Thanks for the coffee.

SHERIFF

(as Thomas turns to

leave)

Small piece of advice, Lt. Dagget,

that I give free of charge to all

visiting big city policemen: It's

wild country up there. Always has

been, always will be. You come across

anything that snarls, you call me

first, hear?

DAGGETT

I never turn down advice, Sheriff.

Especially when it's free.

GRAVE KEEPER

Nothin' on the outside.

DAGGETT

Hello.

KATHERINE

(suspicious)

Can I help you with something?

DAGGETT

Tom Dagget. I'm with the police.

KATHERINE

About the guy upstairs?

DAGGETT

I'd like to ask you a few questions.

KATHERINE

I've kinda got my hands full right

now.

DAGGETT

I'll just tag along.

KATHERINE

Here, make yourself useful.

KATHERINE

Okay, everbody stays on the courts

today.

(kids groan)

-- I mean it.

DAGGETT

What grade is this?

KATHERINE

All of 'em.

DAGGETT

Town doesn't look that small.

KATHERINE

Nearly all ghosts now. When the copper

mine closed it took most of the town

with it. We just teach out of this

one corner of the schoolhouse now.

Rest of it's been abandoned for years.

DAGGETT

You're the only teacher.

KATHERINE

Yup. Just me.

(to kid threatening

another)

-- Randy...

RANDY

But he --

KATHERINE

Do it again and I'll put your head

in the door and slam it.

(to Thomas)

Love and understanding are important

tools in education.

DAGGETT

Clearly.

DAGGETT

The man upstairs, did you talk to

him?

KATHERINE

I wanted to know what the hell he

was doing there.

DAGGETT

What did he say?

KATHERINE

That it wasn't part of the plan. He

looked hurt. Bloody. Like someone

had cut him. That happens here.

(beat)

Was that... stuff... on the floor

really him?

DAGGETT

Did any of the children talk to him?

KATHERINE

Yes.

DAGGETT

Who?

KATHERINE

(protective)

She's home sick from school today.

DAGGETT

Can I speak with her parents?

KATHERINE

They're dead. She lives with her

grandmother. I'll have to ask her.

DAGGETT

All right.

(stands, hands her

slip of paper)

This is my number at the hotel.

DAGGETT

Did you know Arnold Hawthorne?

KATHERINE

The General? Saw him here and there.

It's a small town.

DAGGETT

Military man?

KATHERINE

About a million years ago. His

interests lately were more like

gardening and herbal tea.

DAGGETT

Did you go to the funeral?

KATHERINE

Everyone did. He lived here.

DAGGETT

No dark hidden secrets?

KATHERINE

There are no secrets in small towns,

Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise.

GABRIEL'S VOICE

It's unusual to see someone of your

age in church on a weekday.

GABRIEL

Don't get me wrong. I think it's an

excellent sign of character.

GABRIEL

Never mind him. He shouldn't even be

in here. Least not standing.

GABRIEL

You're not from here.

DAGGETT

Either are you.

GABRIEL

I'm looking for something.

DAGGETT

Have you found it?

GABRIEL

I will. Have you found what you're

looking for?

DAGGETT

I will.

GABRIEL

I don't doubt it.

MICROPHONE VOICE

John, this is Mr. Dagget. Says he's

No, you're not, are you?

KATHERINE

Let me lead.

JOHN

So how's our star pupil feeling today?

KATHERINE

Mary? The school doctor came by.

Declared it "Non-specific

gastrointestinal disorder".

JOHN

Latin for "I don't have the slightest

fucking idea".

DAGGETT

Will she be able to talk with me?

KATHERINE

That's up to her.

(to John)

Mary's grandmother called a hand

trembler.

JOHN

Uh oh. Hocus pocus time.

DAGGETT

Is that serious?

JOHN

Depends what the hand trembler says.

People call them in when they think

a witch or a Yei is trying to sprinkle

corpse sickness in their hogan, or

if the Night People have been hanging

around too much. Night people screw

around a lot, but they're good at

warning of evil ghosts.

DAGGETT

Who are the Night People?

JOHN

They come as coyotes.

DAGGETT

Beautiful stars out here.

JOHN

Too much fucking sky in the desert.

It pushes on you.

(sighs)

Sometimes I wonder if anyone in heaven

even knows this place is here...

KATHERINE

Where do you keep the coffee in this

joint?

JOHN

Above the stove.

DAGGETT

What happens if the hand trembler

says a ghost has been...

JOHN

-- Messing with Mary? If you're smart

you say thank you very much and forget

about it. But if you're heavy

traditional, and Mary's people are

serious traditional, you have an

Enemy Ghost Way.

DAGGETT

What's that?

JOHN

Goddamn expensive. It's a Sing to

purify and drive off the corpse

sickness. Two days of dancing and

ceremony and feeding the whole damn

village. Not even to mention hiring

the yataallii, if you can even find

one these days. And you can bet they

don't come cheap. But every clan

does it a bit different. Especially

Mary's.

DAGGETT

You know them?

JOHN

The Bitter Sky Clan. Hard core

reservation. No lights, no running

water, no HBO. Their village is out

on the edge of Old Woman Butte.

Million miles from anything. Witch

country. Settled right there in the

Dead People Land where no one else

would, right on top of the old Anasazi

village. They're a dying clan. Just

the old ones now. All alone out there

in the middle of nothing.

(drinks)

They can keep it.

DAGGETT

Do people really still believe in it

all? Ghosts, Sings, corpse sickness?

JOHN

Depends, I guess. Sometimes you go

along because it's a village thing,

or you don't want to disappoint

grandma. But sometimes, when you're

alone out there, far from town, and

the wind kicks up and sneaks into

your hogan... I don't know.

DAGGETT

I think John's out for the evening.

KATHERINE

Saturday night in Chimney Rock.

DAGGETT

So how does a person like you end up

teaching here?

KATHERINE

When I was younger I used to believe

that no matter how much you mucked

around in your life, one day, if you

listened hard enough, a voice would

tell you what you were really cut

out to do. And when it didn't show

up on schedule I decided to go look

for it. And I looked in a lot of

places, believe me. I drove that

road out there so far that the end

became the beginning again. And it

was when I got here that I realized

there never was going to be a voice.

So I stopped looking and took the

first job they offered me. That make

any sense to you?

DAGGETT

Oh, I know all about voices. Problem

is not all of them are very nice.

KATHERINE

How did you end up a cop?

DAGGETT

It was the evil of two lessers.

KATHERINE

Are you always this cryptic?

DAGGETT

No. When you get to know me I can be

down right evasive.

DAGGETT

Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at

noon? At the little girl's house?

KATHERINE

First trailer on the highway past

town.

KATHERINE

I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you

don't seem very like a police officer

to me.

DAGGETT

That's what my bosses keep saying.

KATHERINE

I meant it as a compliment.

DAGGETT

So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley.

KATHERINE

Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles.

CUT TO:

KATHERINE

How are you feeling, pumpkin?

MARY

Better.

KATHERINE

This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like

to ask you some questions. You don't

have to answer if you don't want to.

MARY

It's okay.

DAGGETT

Mary, when you talked to man up in

the building --

MARY

-- Simon.

DAGGETT

Yes, Simon. What did Simon say?

MARY

(smiles)

That's funny. "Simon says".

DAGGETT

Right. Like the game.

MARY

I'm good at it. I'm very clever.

DAGGETT

We'll have to play together sometime.

MARY

Simon even said so. He also asked if

I could keep a secret.

DAGGETT

And what was that?

MARY

Something he gave me.

KATHERINE

What, pumpkin?

MARY

Then it wouldn't be a secret.

DAGGETT

You're a good friend not to tell,

Mary. But I'm a friend of Simon's

too. So if you ever want to tell,

you can to me. Okay?

MARY

It's a secret...

MARY

...But sometimes it hurts.

MARY

Have you ever killed a chinaman?

DAGGETT

No Mary, I haven't.

MARY

They don't bleed. Not the way you

and I do. Or maybe it was just the

cold...

MARY

I've killed them, you know. Lots.

You could always tell when they were

coming. There'd be the trumpets first.

Every note flat. Then those songs...

After that they'd charge. Right down

through the snow. The guns would

freeze and it would be just knives...

It was so cold and there were so

many of them. But I was smarter than

they were. Even at Chosin, I was

smarter...

MARY

It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate

it. Please, make it stop!

MARY

Make it stop!

KATHERINE

(rocking her)

It's okay... It's okay...

KATHERINE

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

GRANDMOTHER

It's all right, Miss Henley. We know

you love Mary...

KATHERINE

What are we going to do?

GRANDMOTHER

She's going to have the Enemy Ghost

Way. We leave this afternoon.

DAGGETT

Where will they do the ceremony?

KATHERINE

In the home village. The Hand Trembler

must have found corpse sickness...

DAGGETT

They're taking her away? Shouldn't

she see a doctor?

KATHERINE

She's already seen a doctor.

(then, under her breath)

That son of a bitch...

DAGGETT

Who?

KATHERINE

Gabriel the children called him. The

little shit was hanging around my

kids this morning asking about Mary.

He and his buddy make a real pair.

DAGGETT

Maybe it's time I checked out Mr.

Gabriel.

KATHERINE

I know where he parks his car.

KATHERINE

Chinamen? Chosin? I've never heard

her talk like that before.

DAGGETT

Chosin Reservoir was a Korean war

battle the Marines had against the

Chinese, supposedly the bloodiest

hand-to-hand fighting of the century.

Someone been teaching that to your

class?

KATHERINE

Sure, right next to Jack 'N Jill.

DAGGETT

Where would she have heard it?

KATHERINE

Nobody I can think of.

(beat)

Maybe one.

DAGGETT

Who?

KATHERINE

General Hawthorne.

DAGGETT

Did she know him?

KATHERINE

He didn't like children.

DAGGETT

You couldn't and tell a story like

that to one.

KATHERINE

It was there earlier.

DAGGETT

If I was smart I'd call the Sheriff

or somebody in town who knows this

place. Then again, there is one thing

worse than getting killed.

KATHERINE

What?

DAGGETT

Looking like an idiot if it's nothing.

KATHERINE

I'll come along.

DAGGETT

No, if someone has to fall a hundred

feet down a black pit, he should at

least be on official duty.

DAGGETT

Then again, it is kind of spooky in

there. Here, you can hold the

flashlight.

KATHERINE

It's cold...

DAGGETT

Shit.

DAGGETT

You okay?

KATHERINE

Yeah... Sorry.

DAGGETT

Well, I've seen enough.

DAGGETT

Wonderful.

KATHERINE

What is that?

DAGGETT

I don't know. Maybe a bum or

something.

KATHERINE

Do you feel it?

DAGGETT

...Yes.

KATHERINE

What is it?

DAGGETT

Oh no... Oh God no...

DAGGETT

No!

KATHERINE

What... What was that? Hell?

DAGGETT

...No. The voices. They were screaming

and fighting over... theology. They

don't sweat much about that in hell.

But they do in... heaven.

DAGGETT

The son of a bitch. He carries it

around with him like a photo album.

A big, greasy cloud wherever he goes.

They all do.

KATHERINE

How can that be heaven? Jesus Christ.

How? I don't even believe in heaven.

KATHERINE

You dumb fucking assholes! How could

you have done that!

DAGGETT

That extra chapter by St. John was

right. It's a war... Just like the

first one. Just like when the angel

Michael beat Lucifer and cast him

out. Only now they've turned on each

other... Turned on each other in a

civil war over theology.

DAGGETT

Oh sweet God, theology.

(sighs)

"God's wild bunch".

(shouts)

God's morons!

KATHERINE

How do you know know so much about

that?

DAGGETT

I just know.

(shakes his head)

Yes folks, the good news is that

there's life after death in heaven.

The bad news is that it's as screwed

up as here.

KATHERINE

They were like us.

DAGGETT

They are us. Aborted children. And

they need us. They need our corrupt,

dark souls for their fight. They

need...

KATHERINE

...Mary.

DAGGETT

What are you doing?

KATHERINE

I don't know what this is. I don't

know what I believe. I don't know if

my sanity is lying back in that cave

flopping around waiting for me. But

I know one thing. Those... Those

things aren't taking her!

KATHERINE

In those... visions... did you ever

see... God?

DAGGETT

No.

KATHERINE

Me either.

KATHERINE

Mary?

DAGGETT

Get away from her.

GABRIEL

You know. Son of a bitch, the priest

wanna-be actually figured it out.

That's a rare club, son. At least

down here.

DAGGETT

Back away from the kid, man. Now.

GABRIEL

She won't feel anything, honest.

I'll have to tear her apart of course --

just the way it goes -- but it'll be

all right in the end. A good catholic

boy like you, Mr. Daggett, you should

be on my side.

DAGGETT

Goddamn it --

GABRIEL

You're gonna have to watch that

profanity.

GABRIEL

It'll only be a moment...

JERRY

Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're

a sport.

GABRIEL

You little pest, do you have any

idea how hard it is to get one of

those?

KATHERINE

You son of a bitch, why? Why do this?

GABRIEL

Because I'm an angel, you miserable

wretch! I kill first borns while

their mothers watch! I turn whole

cities into salt! I even, when I

feel like it, rip the souls from

little girls! And from now until

eternity, the only thing you'll be

able to count on in your pathetic

little existence is never knowing

why!

(deep breath)

I'm wasting my time here.

C'mon petunia, let's get on with

DEPUTY

I think you're going to the hospital

DAGGETT

DEPUTY

Cuff him. We'll take him to the

You'll never hold him.

Take off his sunglasses... Jesus

Christ, just take off his

sunglasses...

I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go

I am here, before you, in a form to

Good job.

I rarely do this in person. I am,

perhaps, somewhat out of touch.

KATHERINE

Are you one of them?

FIGURE

No.

KATHERINE

You're not an angel?

FIGURE

Oh, I am an angel. A very special

one. The first. The oldest. The naive

eagle scout, he once loved me above

all others, and I him. It was the

only true love for either of us, but

like all true love, it couldn't

possibly last.

FIGURE

The winged party boys will come,

Katherine. They'll come to feed on

the guts of your little Mary.

KATHERINE

What do you care?

FIGURE

I have my interests...

FIGURE

The naive eagle scout, he has his

interests too. He even has a place

for them, as I do for mine. Big,

shiny place. You'd like it. Only

it's been empty for a long time.

Can't open till after the

resurrection. The problem's with the

hired help. Always had problems with

the hired help. They're arrogant,

boastful little pricks. Not like me.

What I did I did for love. But they,

the winged party boys, even before

the park could open for its first

customer, they started fighting over

the popcorn stand.

FIGURE

You see, Katherine, heaven can't

start accepting guests till this

fight is settled. And without people,

there is no heaven. All those good

and true souls left mouldering in

the ground clutching their H-tickets

and waiting and waiting and waiting...

Some, lying down there with the worms

century after century, they start to

get doubts about the whole program.

That's when, out of sheer boredom,

some of them come to me. Because I'm

always open for business. 24 hours a

day, seven days a week. Even on

Christmas.

FIGURE

Some of the angels cheat. They sneak

a few souls in to help with the fight.

The really dark ones. And now one of

them has found a special soul so

wonderfully sick that it might just

win it for them. And if one side

wins, even the wrong one, then there's

no fight. And if there's no fight,

there can be a heaven.

KATHERINE

And if there's a heaven?

I'd be very unhappy.

invading yei ghost.

DAGGETT

Will it work on a general's soul?

KATHERINE

We'll see.

(beat)

How's the head?

DAGGETT

Still attached. Barely.

KATHERINE

Here, I'll change the bandage.

KATHERINE

Does that hurt?

DAGGETT

No.

KATHERINE

Then I must be doing it wrong.

KATHERINE

I saw the devil tonight.

DAGGETT

How nice. Which one?

KATHERINE

The main one. Satan. Lucifer. The

dark angel. You know.

DAGGETT

What did he have to say?

KATHERINE

That he did it all for love. That

and I have a choice. Mary's life or

a billion souls waiting in the

pipeline for heavenland to open.

DAGGETT

You're not kidding, are you?

KATHERINE

No sir.

DAGGETT

Satan? You're sure?

KATHERINE

You had to be there.

DAGGETT

Why wasn't I!

KATHERINE

We can double date next time if it's

that important to you.

DAGGETT

You don't understand, I've spent my

whole life...

(looks upward)

I don't suppose it would occur to

anyone in authority to fill me in on

what's going on every once in awhile,

huh? Shit!

DAGGETT

Did he say anything about the Nicene

Council? About the rank of Jesus

Christ in the holy Trinity?

KATHERINE

It didn't seem important to him.

KATHERINE

Are you a priest?

DAGGETT

A near miss.

KATHERINE

Why?

DAGGETT

It's a long story.

KATHERINE

This may be your last chance to tell

it.

DAGGETT

The other night, you were talking

about waiting for a voice to call

you to something. Well, let me tell

you, the worst thing that can happen

to you is to be called to something.

Since I can remember a voice from

somewhere deep in the Church called

me. So loud and so often that by

thirteen I knew I was going to be a

priest. You know what that's like?

My parents, friends, all of them

thought I was crazy. But see, I had

this voice. The voice that kept

coaxing me along, telling me there

was a reason. So I entered the

seminary and was half way to my

starched white collar when my mother,

father, and my little brother were

wiped out in a car crash.

DAGGETT

I had never asked anything of the

voice. Not when the neighborhood

kids made fun of me, not when my

father looked down at me like some

knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned

a damn thing. But on the morning I

spent looking down at three parallel

graves, I asked it one question.

Why. Why were these people taken

from me? And the voice, that same

voice that would wrench me out of my

sleep some nights with its jabbering,

it was suddenly stone silent. It was

the only question I ever asked of it

and it just left me hanging in the

fucking wind...

DAGGETT

So after that I traded in priest

school for homicide school. Because

if God wouldn't talk to me the devil

sure as hell would, and his ways

were a lot easier to understand.

KATHERINE

We've never seen God, have we? Not

in any of this.

DAGGETT

Yeah, He's certainly a shy son of a

bitch, I'll give Him that.

KATHERINE

Maybe we're not supposed to. Maybe

that's faith.

DAGGETT

Do you still have faith in anything,

Katherine?

KATHERINE

I have faith in Mary. And that I'm

going to save that little girl from

those creeping things out there.

From all of them.

DAGGETT

Maybe you were called to something

after all.

KATHERINE

Maybe we both were.

DISSOLVE TO:

GABRIEL

Heavy sleeper, John.

JOHN

Don't -- Don't hurt me, man. My

wallet's in the dresser.

GABRIEL

Don't be such a materialist, John.

(sees empty bourbon

bottle on dresser,

sighs)

No end to your bad habits.

JOHN

What do you want?

GABRIEL

A moment of your time.

JOHN

You ought to have that nose looked

at, man.

GABRIEL

Where are they, John? Katherine and

Mary? Where would they go?

JOHN

What? Mary? I don't know.

GABRIEL

Sure you do. Think hard.

JOHN

No, really. I don't know. The school

maybe.

GABRIEL

Now you're not even trying, John.

You're Katherine's best friend. She

tells you everything.

JOHN

I'm just the driver, y'know?

GABRIEL

I can help you remember, John...

CUT TO:

NURSE

Can I help you?

GABRIEL

Someone's going to die here soon.

I'll just be a minute.

NURSE

There's no visitors allowed in ICU.

GABRIEL

The timing's important. I can smell

these things, you know.

GABRIEL

Go to sleep.

GABRIEL

Recovering... Recovering... Stable...

(finally settles on

one)

Deteriorating critical.

GABRIEL

Whoa, not just yet. Come on back.

That's it...

GABRIEL

Hi.

WOMAN

No, no...

GABRIEL

Hey, c'mon, don't start...

(looks at chart)

-- Rachael. Here...

(hands her kleenex)

It's only for a short time.

(grins)

Promise.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARY

Hi, Miss Henley.

KATHERINE

Hi, pumpkin. Good morning.

KATHERINE

How's the head?

DAGGETT

Shitty. Coffee?

KATHERINE

What are we going to do if he comes?

DAGGETT

You mean when, right?

KATHERINE

When he comes.

DAGGETT

There's no phone here? Radio?

(she just looks at

him)

Stupid question.

(beat)

If we were smart we'd leave. Get to

a town. A sheriff station.

KATHERINE

Mary's ceremony isn't over yet. The

Enemy Ghost Way. The alien spirit

hasn't been driven out.

DAGGETT

Do you really believe in the ceremony?

KATHERINE

Would you have believed in any of

this three days ago?

DAGGETT

(nods)

So we stay and dump the General's

soul.

KATHERINE

You have the gun?

DAGGETT

With one shot left. The spares --

(sniffs his shirt)

-- And a change of clothing, are all

still at the hotel.

(sighs)

We're going to have to come up with

something.

KATHERINE

We could always ask him.

LUCIFER

I always forget how cold it gets in

the desert.

LUCIFER

Mr. Daggett, I presume. How's the

faith?

LUCIFER

Come come, must you be so wishy-washy

about everything? With the absent-

minded eagle scout, I can see that.

But you're looking at the devil man,

say something.

DAGGETT

Fuck you.

LUCIFER

Much better. Can I have some coffee?

DAGGETT

Keep it.

LUCIFER

I have come to remind you that the

winged party boys are just that:

spoiled boys. You are armed, however

pathetically, with the one thing

they never really understood:

theology. It's not much, but that's

life.

DAGGETT

Is this supposed to be our "win one

for The Ripper" speech?

LUCIFER

Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett.

LUCIFER

Go and get ready, Thomas.

LUCIFER

Have you ever considered Katherine,

that the great absentee landlord,

the soft-eyed eagle scout your

childhood prayers are for, is just

using you? That you're only the

exterminator to get rid of his pests?

LUCIFER

God's junkies are coming, Katherine.

And when they do, all hell is going

to break loose...

CUT TO:

GABRIEL

Say, Ma'am, any idea where I can

find Old Woman Butte?

MADGE

It's on the reservation.

GABRIEL

I don't suppose you could be just a

tad more specific. Madge.

MADGE

Isn't your friend hungry?

GABRIEL

Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest

thing.

MADGE

Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut-

off. First dirt road go left. Twenty,

twenty-five miles you'll see it.

Big, black and all alone.

GABRIEL

I doubt we'll meet again.

MADGE

Suits me.

DAGGETT

You could always lend a hand.

DISSOLVE TO:

KATHERINE

He's coming.

DAGGETT

Is there any way to speed this up?

VILLAGER

No.

DAGGETT

Lock the door.

DAGGETT

Stay inside. It's only one round, so

make it count.

GABRIEL

You'll like this, Rachael.

GABRIEL

(breathless)

Nice move.

GABRIEL

You ought to come work for us.

Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian

in now and then, you know. You'd

like it. Nobody tells you when to go

to bed, can eat all the ice cream

you want. And you get to kill. All

day and all night. Just like an angel.

GABRIEL

Save yourself, friend. Why go to the

wall with the bitch and her rug rat?

It'll all turn out the same anyway.

Here or in heaven, we're still gonna

tear the kid apart.

DAGGETT

I'm not an angel, heaven or hell.

I'm a man you eyeless puke, which

means I have one thing you never

will. A soul. And though I may,

somewhere inside, believe in a God,

I will never, never, believe in you.

GABRIEL

A little speechy today, aren't we?

(sighs)

Okay pal, have it your way.

GABRIEL

This is going to really, really hurt.

DAGGETT

...You -- your war...

GABRIEL

C'mon, son, out with it. Make this

one count.

DAGGETT

Your war's a lie!

GABRIEL

(pauses)

What?

DAGGETT

Running around acting like this is

really about whether Christ is just

the son of God or if he is God.

Bullshit! That's not what this is

about at all, is it?

GABRIEL

You're wrong.

DAGGETT

Then prove it to me, Gabriel. I

studied three fucking years of

theology before I picked up a gun.

C'mon, you're chief goddamn angel,

I'm just a little man. Prove to me

Christ is just a son and less than

God. Prove it!

GABRIEL

I don't have to.

DAGGETT

Because you can't! Because this war

isn't about some obscure medieval

hangup. You're just jealous.

GABRIEL

You're wrong!

DAGGETT

Try me, Gabriel. Go on. Prove to me

the temporal nature of the Trinity.

Show me through logic how the Son of

the Word can be separated from the

Father. Fight me with philosophy,

Gabriel!

GABRIEL

No!

DAGGETT

Because you and your army are wrong!

And you know it. You knew it sixteen

centuries ago.

GABRIEL

We don't have to listen to him! He's

just a son!

DAGGETT

That's it. You're jealous. Jealous

He could love something more than

you...

GABRIEL

(hisses)

Shut up...

DAGGETT

If you wanted to know so badly,

Gabriel, why didn't you just ask

Him? Why didn't you just ask God?

GABRIEL

Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!

GABRIEL

Relax folks, it's just a soul.

GABRIEL

I'm getting real tired of you.

KATHERINE

Go to hell.

GABRIEL

Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least

get the zip code right.

KATHERINE

It's all the same, isn't it?

GABRIEL

No. In heaven we believe in love.

KATHERINE

And what do you love, Gabriel?

GABRIEL

-- Cracking your skull.

KATHERINE

That's all it is for you anymore,

Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing

and the burning. You don't work for

God anymore. You don't fight for

love.

GABRIEL

Shut up!

GABRIEL

God loves you, Mary!

KATHERINE

Finish it.

KATHERINE

Finish it!

KATHERINE

Go home.

LUCIFER

No.

LUCIFER

Please. Go on.

GABRIEL

Oh man, this just isn't my day.

LUCIFER

Long time.

GABRIEL

The world's young, man.

LUCIFER

And full of ambition.

GABRIEL

This isn't your war.

LUCIFER

But I remember the last one. Michael's

war.

GABRIEL

You lost.

LUCIFER

But lots of angels were with me.

every one followed their leader out

of heaven.

GABRIEL

Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?

LUCIFER

Except one. Oh, he was with me all

right. He hated the Eagle Scout.

Envied the power He gave to His Son.

But this angel never came out front

during the war. And when it ended he

thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout

didn't notice. So he laid low and

towed the company line till he could

start his own war. It was all just

jealousy.

GABRIEL

You're dreaming.

LUCIFER

But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's

why I'm here.

GABRIEL

-- Stay away from me.

LUCIFER

You've always been a part of me,

Gabriel. And now it's time to come

home.

GABRIEL

Fuck you!

GREY HORSE

The enemy spirit is gone.

DAGGETT

(weak, faint)

Where?

DAGGETT

More will come... To look for the

soul...

KATHERINE

And they won't find it. Not in Mary.

KATHERINE

Can you help him?

VILLAGER

We have some bandages.

KATHERINE

Are you all right, pumpkin?

MARY

I'm okay.

KATHERINE

It's going to be okay... We're all

going to be okay...

KATHERINE

I can't quite bring myself to say

thank you.

LUCIFER

I understand.

KATHERINE

Then this is done.

LUCIFER

Not necessarily. Maybe I like you.

Maybe I want you to come with me.

LUCIFER

You owe me, Katherine. And you're

going to ask me to take you home.

KATHERINE

(clutching Mary)

No.

LUCIFER

You will. You will because any other

way is going to be more awful than

you can imagine.

KATHERINE

Are you threatening me?

KATHERINE

Then you've picked the wrong person

this time. I've just about had it up

to here with ghosts. So you can put

away the horror movie sneer and the

K-Mart halloween eyes, because we

know you now. We know you all. And

if you want to force the issue then

go ahead because you're just another

angel to me. Take a look at your

buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do

you really, really want to fuck with

us?

LUCIFER

Perhaps another time.

KATHERINE

I'm holding my breath.

LUCIFER

Goodbye, Katherine. For now.

MARY

Is he coming back?

KATHERINE

I don't think so, honey... I don't

think so...

DISSOLVE TO:

SHERIFF

(to deputy bandaging

Thomas)

Is he going to live?

DEPUTY

With any luck.

SHERIFF

(to Thomas)

I thought I told you to give me a

call if anything snarled.

DAGGETT

There wasn't a phone.

SHERIFF

Hmmm.

SHERIFF

This fella, Gabriel...

DAGGETT

Yeah.

SHERIFF

Gabriel what?

DAGGETT

Just Gabriel.

SHERIFF

Pretty violent guy, Gabriel. Even

for out here.

DAGGETT

Yeah.

SHERIFF

Caught up with him at the village?

DAGGETT

He caught up with me.

SHERIFF

What were you doing way up here?

DAGGETT

Enemy Ghost Way for Mary Tsosie.

SHERIFF

Indian stuff.

DAGGETT

Yeah. Indian stuff.

SHERIFF

Did you kill this Gabriel?

DAGGETT

Maybe. I think so.

SHERIFF

Don't have any idea where the body

is I suppose.

DAGGETT

No.

SHERIFF

Well, if he's alive he won't get far

out there. Us or the coyotes, it'll

be the same.

(beat)

I rang your office in LA. They don't

have a warrant out for a Gabriel. Or

anybody else in Arizona.

DAGGETT

I hadn't gotten around to it.

SHERIFF

Sort of an out of pocket thing.

DAGGETT

Yes.

SHERIFF

That woman lying at the bottom of

the arroyo, the one still in her

hospital gown, know anything about

that?

DAGGETT

No.

SHERIFF

Really.

DAGGETT

Really.

SHERIFF

This Gabriel was sure one busy dude.

DAGGETT

Yes, he was.

SHERIFF

You'll be going back to Los Angeles

now?

DAGGETT

Yeah.

SHERIFF

Don't hurry back.

DEPUTY

Don't do much but breathe the next

few days. And get to a hospital.

You're going to need some serious

stitches.

DAGGETT

Thanks.

DEPUTY

Say hi to Hollywood for me.

MARY

You look bad.

DAGGETT

Thank you. I feel worse.

(to Katherine re Navaho

cops)

They lean on you much?

KATHERINE

Not really. I think they might have

even understood. One of them's related

to this clan. He'll give us a ride

back if we want.

DAGGETT

Good. I think I've about run out of

hospitality with the sheriff's

department.

KATHERINE

Do you think it's really over?

DAGGETT

Till we die.

KATHERINE

When I die, I want you with me.

DAGGETT

I want that too.

DISSOLVE TO:

THE END
