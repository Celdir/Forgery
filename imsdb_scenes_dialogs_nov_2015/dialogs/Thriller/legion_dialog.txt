PSALM 34:11

WOMAN'S VOICE

When I was a little girl, my mother

would remind me each night before

bed to be sure to open my heart to

God, for he was kind, merciful and

just. Things changed after my

father left a few years later,

leaving her to raise me and my

brothers alone in a little place

out on the edge of the Mojave

Desert. She never talked about a

kind and merciful God again.

Instead she spoke of a prophecy.

Of a time when all the world would

be covered in darkness and the fate

of Mankind would be decided. One

night I finally got up the courage

to ask my mother why God had

changed, why was he mad at his

children. "I don't know," she

said, tucking the covers around me,

"I guess he just got tired of all

the bullshit."

BURTON

Goddamn' animals. Nights like this

I wish I could take a match to this

city just so I could watch all

these motherfuckers burn.

ESTEVEZ

(LAUGHS)

A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?

BURTON

A fresh start. That's what this

place needs.

BURTON

Pow!   Pow!     Pow!

ESTEVEZ

Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so

happy we get to share beautiful

moments like this. They really

brighten my da--

5.

ESTEVEZ (O.S.)

Freeze!

ESTEVEZ

Drop the bags! Hands on your head!

MICHAEL

(sensing their unease:)

It's starting. There isn't much

time.

BURTON

Shut the fuck up and drop the bags

now!

ESTEVEZ

Hands on your head!    On your head!

BURTON

Turn around! Turn the fuck around!

BURTON

Let `em go!

6.

ESTEVEZ

Take the shot, Burton!

BURTON

I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--

ESTEVEZ

Burton!?

BURTON

What are you doing, Michael?   These

weren't your orders.

ESTEVEZ

What did you say?

MICHAEL

I'm following my own orders now.

BURTON

Then you will die along with the

child.

ESTEVEZ

Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!

7.

SMASH CUT TO:

CHARLIE (O.S.)

You okay, Jeep?

8.

JEEP

Sorry to wake you, Charlie.

CHARLIE

(stepping out of the

trailer, hands on her

BELLY)

Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a

storm all night. Must know

somethin' I don't.

CHARLIE

Another bad dream?

CHARLIE

It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.

You do too much worryin'. About

this place. About your dad.

(BEAT)

About me...

JEEP

You're the only thing I like

worrying about.

CHARLIE

See what I mean? You're worried

about a girl eight months pregnant

and it isn't even your baby. Now

that's enough to give anybody

nightmares.

JEEP

Go ahead, make fun of me.

Everybody else does.

CHARLIE

(turns him back around)

C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You

know how much I appreciate

everything you and Bob are doing

for me, but a month from now, this

baby'll have a new family and I'll

have to start thinkin' about what

the hell I'm doin' with my life.

9.

JEEP

So you're still going through with

it...?

CHARLIE

Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.

Christ, I can barely take care of

myself as it is.

JEEP

I could help you. We could do it

together, you know? I want to.

CHARLIE

You gotta stop carryin' the weight

of the world on your shoulders.

CHARLIE

(rubbing her arms)

Now can we go back in? I'm

freezing my ass off out here.

JEEP

Go on.   I'll be right there.

JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)

I don't know whether I like it very

much being seen around with an

angel without any wings.

CUT TO:

CLARENCE (ON TV)

Oh, I've got to earn them and

you'll help me, won't you?

10.

PERCY

Lord as my witness, Bob, one of

these days that thing's gonna hit

you back.

BOB

Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We

got a special relationship here.

PERCY

Yeah, they got names for that kind

a relationship.

SANDRA (O.S.)

It's disgusting.

11.

HOWARD (O.S.)

You're right. It is disgusting.

SANDRA

Really, how can she go out in

public wearing that?

HOWARD

I don't know. Why don't we just

ask her?

SANDRA

Howard, don't. You'll embarrass

me.

HOWARD

(shouting across the

DINER)

Audrey, honey? Your mother was

wondering if you got dressed this

morning with the specific intention

of showing your ass off to the

entire world?

AUDREY

Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping

to get double teamed by a couple of

meth head truckers in the bathroom

of some desert shithole.

(BEAT)

Good thing we stopped here.

HOWARD

I feel satisfied with that answer.

I really do.

SANDRA

I'm being punished for something, I

know it.

12.

CUT TO:

KYLE

Shit...

13.

KYLE

Darren, your fuckin' directions

suck, man.

KYLE

Hey...

KYLE

You know that shit right there

ain't good for the baby.

CHARLIE

Guess I should think `bout quittin'

then.

KYLE

Now hold on, girl, let me bum one

before you do.

CHARLIE

You can buy a whole pack inside.

KYLE

Tell ya what. You let me have one

of yours, and I'll give you two

from the new pack you're gonna sell

me.

KYLE

Am I in the right place?

CHARLIE

(peers at the map)

Only if nowhere's right, `cause

that's where you are.

14.

KYLE

Sonuvabitch. There another phone

around here? You know, one that

works?

CHARLIE

Bob'll probably let you use the

diner phone if you ask him real

nice...And pay `im somethin'.

KYLE

I can handle that.   You got

pancakes here?

CHARLIE

Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for

three seventy-five. We also got

french toast for four dollars if

you're into that. I personally

like the pancakes though.

JEEP (O.S.)

You okay, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just

lost.

KYLE

Three seventy-five, huh?

15.

CHARLIE

I hope Salem Lights are okay,

`cause that's all we got left.

KYLE

If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.

BOB (O.S.)

Where ya been, Charlie?

BOB

This ain't a resort you know.    I

got orders stacking up here.

BOB

(sees the two cigarettes

Kyle's handing her)

You best not be smokin' again.    Not

in your condition.

CHARLIE

(gestures to the diner)

Bob, do you see where am I right

now? Can my condition really get

any worse? `Sides, you ain't one

to talk.

BOB

What?   I quit two years ago.

CHARLIE

Yeah, so why you still carryin'

that fancy lighter `round for?

BOB

It was a gift from my ex-wife,

alright? I'm sentimental. I don't

wanna forget how much I hate her

guts.

KYLE

Hey man?

KYLE

Can I use your phone? My cell

doesn't get a signal out here and

the pay phone outside is busted.

16.

HOWARD (O.S.)

Excuse me...?

HOWARD

Any news about when our truck might

be fixed? You said your boy would

have us on the road two hours ago.

The rate we're going, we'll be

lucky to make it to Scottsdale by

Christmas.

BOB

Goddamn it. Where the hell is

Jeep?

CUT TO:

BOB (O.S.)

Hey, Leonardo...!

BOB

The fact that this truck's hood's

up mean anything to you?

JEEP

Yeah...

BOB

(approaches, peering past

him to the crib)

(MORE)

17.

BOB (cont'd)

Whaddya workin' on that's so

goddamn important you're not doin'

your job?

JEEP

Nothin'...

JEEP

Found it under a bunch of stuff in

the storage shed. I know you never

like to throw anything away...

BOB

Whaddya doin'?

JEEP

What...?

BOB

Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I

think it's real good of you to lend

her a helping hand, but she is not

your responsibility.

JEEP

(heard this before, pushes

past him)

Oh whatever, leave me alone.

BOB

Don't walk away from me while I'm

talkin' to you!

BOB

How long you gonna follow her

around like a puppy dog? Cleanin'

up the messes she makes while she

steps out with every guy around

here other than you?!

JEEP

Don't say that about her!     She's

not like that!

18.

BOB

You really think she's gonna stick

around here after that baby's born

and off her hands?

JEEP

Look, I know it doesn't make any

sense to you, but it's just

something I have to do.

BOB

(points up at the PARADISE

FALLS sign)

See that up there? Your mother

thought I was crazy for wanting to

buy this place, middle of

nowhere...But I just knew this was

what I was supposed to do. Told

your mom, "just wait." Told her

when they finally ran the freeway

through here like they were

plannin' on, this place would be

like Grand Central Station.

(BEAT)

But I was wrong. The freeway never

came and now the only people who

ever stop here are the ones who are

lost.

(BEAT)

And your mom? Well she got tired

of waitin'.

JEEP

C'mon Dad. You can't blame

yourself for what she did--

BOB

Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're

about to make the same damn mistake

I made, believing in something

that's never gonna happen...Or

someone.

(BEAT)

It's time for you to move on from

this place, Jeep. I don't wanna

see you wake up one morning old and

pissed off, realizing you're lost

just like everybody else who stops

here.

19.

BOB

Now get to work on that truck. I

wanna have these people on the road

by nightfall.

BOB

(holding up a silencing

HAND)

Yeah, wait a minute.

BOB

What's wrong with you today?

PERCY

I told you to get the satellite TV.

But you don't wanna listen.

BOB

What the hell do I need that crap

for?

PERCY

History Channel, man!

20.

BOB

I got all the history I can take.

CHARLIE

That's for sure.

BOB

What's your problem now?

CHARLIE

Where do I start?

BOB

You know this was the top-of-the-

line model when I bought it.

CHARLIE

Yeah, in the Fifties.

BOB

You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.

(rubs his hands together)

Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.

BOB

See?   Clear as day.

PERCY

Nice work, Bob. What the hell's

that?

BOB

It's just one of those test things.

CHARLIE

Don't look like a test.

21.

KYLE

Yo, am I the Invisible

motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you

have a phone or not?

BOB

In the back past the kitchen.   Make

it fast.

SANDRA

If there's a real emergency aren't

they supposed to give us some

information about what to do?

HOWARD

I'm sure it's a mistake.

BOB

Hey, Percy, give that old radio of

yours a shot. Maybe they got some

news about the TV.

KYLE (V.O.)

Let me talk to him...

22.

KYLE (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Cuz a father should be able to talk

to his son, that's why. Now put

`im on the phone.

(a beat then a smile)

Is that my little man...? Yeah,

well I'm working hard, so that I

can be with you. You bein' good?

(strange STATIC can be

HEARD)

Wait... You're breakin' up.

Hello...?

(hangs up in frustration)

Shit!

KYLE

What the hell...

HOWARD (V.O.)

Maybe there was an earthquake?

HOWARD

They keep sayin' we're overdue for

a big one.

PERCY

Lot a folks could be hurt.

BOB

Not if it was centered in the

desert.

HOWARD

Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry

about.

SANDRA

So then why's the TV out?

HOWARD

Maybe it just hit the relay

stations. Aren't those usually in

remote areas?

23.

BOB

Yeah, `cause of the radiation they

give off.

PERCY

There ain't no radiation comin'

from those things. Plus that don't

explain the radio being out too.

Some of those stations broadcast

over hundreds of miles. Any quake

that big and we would a felt it.

CHARLIE

Percy's right. I didn't feel

nothing.

AUDREY

Maybe it's a terrorist attack or

something...?

SANDRA

(covers her mouth)

Oh god...

BOB

Well, for cryin' out loud. There's

no use in speculating. I'll just

call my brother up in Needles. He

must a heard something.

KYLE (O.S.)

I don't think so.

BOB

Whaddya talkin' about?

KYLE

Phone's dead. Just tried to make a

call.

BOB

You're shittin' me.

SANDRA

Oh, this is just great.

BOB

Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to

get excited about. Probably just

working on the lines.

(MORE)

24.

BOB (cont'd)

Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your

truck fixed up quick as can be, and

then you'll be on your way.

JEEP

Damn it!

CHARLIE

Have a seat wherever you want,

Ma'am. Specials are on the board.

OLD WOMAN

Thank you, dear.

OLD WOMAN

Oh, I already know what I want.

CHARLIE

Okay, what'll it be?

25.

OLD WOMAN

I'll have the steak, please.

CHARLIE

And how'd you like that cooked?

OLD WOMAN

Rare if you would. And water, no

ice.

CHARLIE

Coming right up.

OLD WOMAN

Charlie, is it?

CHARLIE

Yeah.

OLD WOMAN

What an unusual name for a girl.

CHARLIE

So they say. I'll be right back

with your water.

OLD WOMAN

Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.

SANDRA

Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm

Sandra and this is my husband

Howard.

GLADYS

What a nice young couple you are.

What brings you out to these parts?

SANDRA

We're moving out to Scottsdale.

But our truck broke down, and so

we're stuck here while it's being

fixed.

GLADYS

Oh, what a nuisance.

SANDRA

Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are

down around here. The phone and

TV, you know?

(MORE)

26.

SANDRA (cont'd)

And I just was wondering if you

might have heard something on your

way up? You know, about what's

going on?

GLADYS

Oh, don't worry yourself about

that, sweetheart. It'll all be

over soon.

JEEP

The carburetor's shot.    Don't know

why. Looks brand new.

BOB

(glances over at the

ANDERSONS)

Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.

JEEP

I could try to rebuild it, but it'd

take a while, and I don't think we

have all the parts. If we call

right now, we might be able to get

a new one down here tomorrow

morning.

BOB

That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn

phone's out.

JEEP

What?

GLADYS

Thank you, dear. How far along are

you?

27.

CHARLIE

Just about there.

GLADYS

The father must be very proud.

CHARLIE

I wouldn't know.

GLADYS

You mean he's...

CHARLIE

Out of sight. Out of mind.

GLADYS

Oh, I see.     So you're not married,

I take it?

CHARLIE

Nope.

GLADYS

That's too bad.

CHARLIE

No, I prefer it that way. I don't

a need a man tellin' me what to do.

GLADYS

But what about the baby?

CHARLIE

I've got it under control.

GLADYS

Yeah, but it's gonna burn.

CHARLIE

What did you just say?

28.

GLADYS

(all smiles)

I said your fucking baby's gonna

burn.

CHARLIE

Go to hell, lady.

BOB

What happened?

CHARLIE

Total fucking Jesus freak.

GLADYS

All those babies.    They're gonna

burn.

SANDRA

Gladys, please. There's no reason

to --

GLADYS

Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!

All you do is complain! Complain!

Complain!

SANDRA

Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to

her!

HOWARD

Who the hell do you think you are,

lady?! Now, I'd like you to

apologize to my --

29.

GLADYS

You're all going to fucking die!

BOB

Don't move!

BOB

(struggles to cock the

GUN)

Fuck!

PERCY

Shoot her, Jeep!

30.

GLADYS

(a sickly sweet smile)

You'll never save her.

PERCY

SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!

SANDRA (O.S.)

Somebody help me!

KYLE

Press your hands over the hole!

KYLE

Don't look at me like that, lady!

I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!

Now put your goddamn hands over the

hole before your husband bleeds to

death!

31.

BOB

The fuck was that?!   What the fuck

was that!?

KYLE

How far to the hospital?

PERCY

Seventy, maybe eighty miles.

AUDREY

What's that on the road?

32.

KYLE

They're fuckin' clouds!   What the

fuck do they look like?

AUDREY

Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.

BOB

I don't understand how she was

still standin' after Percy hit `er

with that goddamn fryin' pan.

Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it.

I swear I did.

(BEAT)

And did you see that kid's gun?

The hell's he doin' with a gun like

that?

BOB

It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay.

JEEP

I couldn't pull the trigger. I

froze. I saw what I needed to do,

but I was afraid...

(breaks down)

She could've killed you!

(MORE)

33.

JEEP (cont'd)

Or Charlie...She would've killed me

if it wasn't for...

BOB

There's nothin' to be ashamed of,

Jeep.

(BEAT)

Not everybody can play the hero.

BOB

(catching Percy by the

ARM)

Where you going?!

PERCY

To get my bible!

BOB

The hell you need that for?!

PERCY

Well somebody's gotta start

prayin'...

CUT TO:

34.

PERCY

(raises a bottle of

ALCOHOL)

Okay, hold `em steady.

CHARLIE

(nods, peakish, to

HERSELF)

Oh god, please don't throw up.

BOB

She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.

If I hadn't just seen her walk in

here, I'd say the old bag's been

dead for hours.

KYLE

Well, I don't care how long she's

been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'

in here with us.

35.

BOB

I don't get it.    Why don't they

come closer?

KYLE

How the fuck am I supposed to know,

man? You askin' me to explain the

behavior of a motherfuckin'

pestilence.

JEEP

(holding up the keys)

You guys!

BOB

You see anything?

KYLE

No Twilight Zone shit if that's

what you mean.

BOB

Careful. Old lady could have some

kind of rabid poodle locked up in

there.

KYLE

Agh!   What the fuck is that?

BOB

Jesus.

KYLE

Nothin' here.

36.

JEEP

How `bout the trunk?

KYLE

Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats

in her hoopty! What the fuck is

wrong with white people?!

BOB

Least now we know where that smell

was coming from.

KYLE

Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'

necessity we figured that out, man.

JEEP

(sees something up the

ROAD)

Hey...

BOB

Okay, now we're talkin'.

JEEP

Wait a minute. Check it out. It's

LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way

out here?

KYLE

I'm from Nevada, man.

37.

BOB

Give me the shotgun.

CHARLIE

Oh, thank God, the police!

JEEP

Charlie, wait!

BOB

Take one step closer and I'll drop

you right here.

MICHAEL

That how you greet all your

customers?

BOB

Mister, after what we've been

through here today, you're lucky we

didn't shoot you first and greet

you later. Now let me see your

teeth.

38.

BOB

Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see

`em!

JEEP

No, shark teeth, Pop.

BOB

Okay... Suppose you tell us your

name then.

MICHAEL

Michael.

BOB

Sorry about all that, Michael.

This old lady just went crazy

inside my place here. She had

these teeth. Never seen anything

like `em. Practically bit a man in

half.

BOB

So what are you doin' out here?

Gotta say you don't exactly look

like a police officer. Even one

from L.A. Then again, you have to

be, right? I mean, who the hell'd

be crazy enough to steal a cop car?

MICHAEL

You don't know, do you?

KYLE

Know what?

39.

CHARLIE

We don't know anything. Nothing's

working here. The TV, the radio,

the phone...

MICHAEL

I'm running out of time.

BOB

Back off, fella...

(BEAT)

Now, I don't care if this is the

second coming of Jesus fucking

Christ, I say it's time for you to

either get talkin' or get the hell

outta here!

KYLE

Easy!   Easy!

JEEP

C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.

Tell `em you were only kidding!

CHARLIE

Let `em go!

40.

PERCY

Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna

go spillin' blood for no good

reason in front of all these decent

people, do ya? Our friend Bob here

ain't worth the trouble it'd cause

ya.

(BEAT)

So whaddya say `bout just lettin'

`im go and then you can be on your

way? Nice `n' easy.

KYLE

What the--?

MICHAEL

They're here.

MICHAEL

You're going to need this.

PERCY

Lord, have mercy.

(waving back Audrey and

SANDRA)

You ladies best get back inside.

SANDRA

What is it? What's happening? Who

is this man? Why's he driving a

police car?

AUDREY

Shut up, mom!

41.

BOB

Wait. I don't think that's such a

good idea.

JEEP

Dad, I can handle it.

BOB

(to Michael)

He's just a kid --

JEEP

I said, I can handle it!

MICHAEL

He can handle it. He doesn't have

a choice.

MICHAEL

If you want to live, you'll do

exactly as I say.

MICHAEL

When you fire, you keep your thumb

off the slide. Don't hesitate.

Don't do anything brave. There's

no safety.

BOB

C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!

42.

JEEP

Fuck it.

CUT TO:

HOWARD

Sandra?    What's happening?

SANDRA

It's okay!     Everything's okay!

43.

BOB (V.O.)

Jeep, get the flashlights!

PERCY (V.O.)

Everybody just stay still!

KYLE (V.O.)

Now that we're locked in here, what

the fuck are we supposed to do?

KYLE

Where the hell did they go?

BOB

Alright, Rambo. You got us up

here. Now you mind explaining what

the fuck we're fighting?

PERCY

Listen!

PERCY

You hear what I'm hearing?

BOB

Yeah...The hell is that?

44.

PERCY

It sounds almost like...

KYLE

Ice cream.

KYLE

You've got to be fuckin' kidding

me.

MICHAEL

Alright. There's a safety switch

on the side of your gun. Push it

all the way down. Two clicks.

MICHAEL

Now when this starts, you hold on

tight, you hear me? If you don't,

you're going to blow your hand off.

Understand?

PERCY

The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?

HOWARD

Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice

Cream Man.

45.

KYLE

(WHISPERS)

Ah, he don't look that bad.

KYLE

Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit.

MICHAEL

Get ready!

46.

KYLE

Is that it?

MICHAEL

Now!   Shoot now!

MICHAEL

Spread out! Don't let them get

close to the windows!

47.

BOB

Shells!

BOB

Fuck!

PERCY

Bob!

PERCY

(extending his hook)

Grab my hand!

BOB

Gun!

48.

BOB

(jamming the gun in her

MOUTH)

Fuck off!

BOB

Pull me up!

PERCY

Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on!

49.

JEEP

Where is it?!

AUDREY

Mom!   Open your eyes!

SANDRA

I can't!   I can't!

SANDRA

(springing after her

HUSBAND)

Howard!

AUDREY

Daddy!

50.

TEENAGE GIRL

See what you made me do, mother!?

SANDRA

No!

SANDRA

Howard!

RAGGEDY MAN

(SWEETLY)

There you are!

51.

AUDREY

Daddy!

KYLE

They're running!      We got `em!

SANDRA

Let me go!     He's alive!

SANDRA

He's alive!

MICHAEL

No...     Not anymore.

52.

CHARLIE

(RECOVERING)

I'm okay. I'm fine.

CHARLIE

Thanks...

MICHAEL

I told you not to do anything

brave.

KYLE

We got `em runnin'!

KYLE

Where's Howard?

MICHAEL

Someone needs to be on the roof.

KYLE

I'll go.

BOB

Hold on.

(approaches Michael,

DETERMINED)

You better start talking.

53.

MICHAEL

The first time God lost faith in

Man he sent a flood. The second

time...he sent what you see

outside.

PERCY

You sayin' this is the

Apocalypse...?

MICHAEL

I'm saying this is an

extermination.

(BEAT)

Those things out there are vessels.

The Possessed. The weakest willed

are the easiest to turn.

KYLE

Possessed by what?    Demons?

MICHAEL

No...by angels.

PERCY

(pulls out his bible)

Son, I don't know what bible you

been readin', but in my version,

the angels are the good guys.

MICHAEL

That's where your book is wrong.

SANDRA

How come you know so much about

them?

MICHAEL

I know because until last night, I

was on their side.

JEEP

You mean you're...

MICHAEL

Not anymore...

54.

BOB

Right and yesterday I was the

fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,

fuck this. I don't even believe in

God.

MICHAEL

That's fine, because He doesn't

believe in you either.

PERCY

C'mon, Bob. Have you looked

outside recently? Those aren't

exactly our regular customers out

there.

BOB

How do we know he didn't bring them

here himself?

CHARLIE

He brings them here and then he

saves us from them? You're a

genius, Bob.

AUDREY

So you're here to protect us?

MICHAEL

Not you...

(looks at Charlie)

Her.

CHARLIE

Me?!   Why me?!

MICHAEL

Because your child is the only hope

humanity has of surviving.

CHARLIE

No way!

55.

CHARLIE

(STUNNED)

Jesus Christ...

MICHAEL

Exactly.

JEEP

You're sayin' she's the mother of

the Messiah?

BOB

Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed

to be a vi--

CHARLIE

Go fuck yourself, Bob!

PERCY

Makes you wonder about Mary.

CHARLIE

(approaches Michael, panic

setting in)

Look, this is not possible! I'm

just a waitress! I'm nobody! I

can't give birth to the Savior of

Mankind!

(and finally)

I don't even own a car!

MICHAEL

None of that matters anymore.

Either your child lives or Mankind

dies.

KYLE

So what, we're supposed to just

hold those things off until Mary

over there squeezes one out?

MICHAEL

That's right.

CHARLIE

That can't be. I'm only eight

months pregnant.

KYLE

Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked!

56.

SANDRA

How are we supposed to survive here

for a month?

MICHAEL

We won't have to...

CHARLIE

It's coming soon, isn't it?

MICHAEL

If you want to live you'll do what

I say. This first attack was a

test of our strength. The next one

will be a test of our weakness.

(BEAT)

Something much worse is on its way.

KYLE

Okay, what's your plan?

MICHAEL

We'll keep watch on the roof in

shifts of two. Jeep, go get some

tools. We need to close up this

window before somebody else goes

out.

57.

PERCY

They're out there. Sons of

bitches. I can feel `em.

(BEAT)

Damn it's cold!

KYLE

You were in the Army?

PERCY

Navy, two tours. But the second

one didn't work out so well, so I

didn't get to go back for a third.

Suppose that makes me lucky in a

way. Served with Bob, you know.

That's how I ended up in this

place.

KYLE

What was it like?    Being in a war?

PERCY

Dark.   Like this.

PERCY

So what's with that gun?

KYLE

What?

PERCY

Your piece. The one you killed

grandma with. Don't reckon it's

for huntin' buck.

KYLE

No. I uh -- keep it for

protection.

PERCY

Protection from what?

KYLE

From people.

PERCY

People.

58.

KYLE

Yeah, people who might try to give

me a hard time, you know?

PERCY

Just regular people or uh...

KYLE

Yeah, well, no, not regular,

regular people.

PERCY

Irregular people then.

KYLE

I'm talkin' people whose job it is

to give other people a hard time.

Kinda person who doesn't get enough

fiber in their diet, you know what

I'm sayin?

PERCY

So it's a work thing, is it?

KYLE

Exactly.    Strictly business.

PERCY

This business of yours... You like

it?

KYLE

Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'

me, man? I got my reasons for

doin' what I do.

PERCY

When I was a kid my father would

sit by my bed every night before

I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,

Percy, if you don't wake up

tomorrow, if it turns out that

today was your last day on earth,

would you be proud of what you've

done in this life? Cuz if you

ain't, then you better start

gettin' square.

CUT TO:

59.

BOB

On the house.

SANDRA

Thanks.

BOB

You hungry?

SANDRA

Couldn't eat if my life depended on

it.

BOB

Well I figure just cuz the world's

coming to an end, it doesn't mean a

man's gotta starve. All I can say

is thank heavens they left the gas

on.

SANDRA

Never much cared for beer.

Howard's the beer drinker in the

family.

60.

JEEP

What did you do...you know, before

you came here...?

MICHAEL

I was a soldier, a general, in His

army.

JEEP

Well, what changed?   What made you

leave?

MICHAEL

I was given an order I didn't

believe in...

(off Jeep's look:)

He lost faith. I hadn't.

JEEP

So what happens to you...after this

is over?

MICHAEL

Sometimes we have to face the thing

we fear the most in order to be

free of it.

MICHAEL

It's almost time for the next

shift.

CUT TO:

61.

SANDRA

Howard?

VOICE

(a whisper)

Sandra...

SANDRA

Who's there?

VOICE

Sandra...

62.

SANDRA

Howard?     Is that you?

VOICE

Help me...     Please...

VOICE

(from behind the door)

Help me. Sandra...

HOWARD

Help me, please!

SANDRA

Howard!

AUDREY

Mom!

SANDRA

Let me go!     He's alive!

63.

SANDRA

Howard!

64.

CHARLIE

Percy?

CUT TO:

JEEP

We should get back out there...

BOB

Just gimme another minute with him,

okay?

CUT TO:

65.

AUDREY

Hey...

AUDREY

Hey! You guys, I think I got

something here!

RADIO VOICE

... battling has been fierce. The

numbers of casualties are unknown

but all indications are that they

must be unimaginably large.

(BEAT)

If you're just joining us, we're

getting some of the first bits of

good news, if you can call it that,

since this apocalypse began just

twenty-four ago. A human militia

has formed on the outskirts of Las

Vegas and has begun to engage the

enemy. Also down in the Four

Corners area, we've been receiving

unconfirmed reports of another

resistance force gathering in Red

Rock National in the northern

Mojave Desert area.

JEEP

Red Rock...

CHARLIE

That can't be more than an hour up

the highway from here.

AUDREY

Does that mean we can leave?

MICHAEL

No.    We're not going anywhere.

BOB

What the hell are you talkin'

about? This is our chance!

66.

MICHAEL

We can't risk being on the move

when the child comes. It's too

dangerous.

RADIO VOICE

... And as we fight this new

enemy, may God give us the strength

to survive and show mercy for those

of us who are already lost...

CUT TO:

JEEP (O.S.)

Guess it's your turn not to sleep.

CHARLIE

Hey...

JEEP

You okay?

67.

CHARLIE

You mean besides the fact that I

just found out that I'm the mother

of the Messiah?

CHARLIE

Crazy thing is...I didn't want this

baby. I even went down to the

clinic, you know that?

(off Jeep's reaction:)

I remember sitting there in the

waiting room, absolutely sure I was

doin' the right thing...And that's

when the feeling started. Like I

was falling into the deepest,

darkest hole imaginable. I

couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.

I kept thinking this must be what

death is like. And when finally

they called my name, I ran.

(BEAT)

For a while after that I tried

pretending that it was just cold

feet, that I could go back if I

wanted to, that I could decide to

end it like I'd planned. Then I'd

start to have that feeling again

and I knew I didn't have a choice.

Somehow this had already been

decided. And it made me hate this

thing that's been growing inside

me.

JEEP

You shouldn't say things like that,

Charlie. It isn't right. You'll

get through this. I know you will.

CHARLIE

How come you have so much faith in

me, Jeep? God knows I've never

given you or anybody else a reason

to. Or is it that you just can't

find any other hard-luck case to

follow around?

68.

JEEP

You know, you're not the only who's

suffered, okay? Let me know when

you stop feeling sorry for

yourself.

CUT TO:

KYLE

...Then you just flip this --

AUDREY

Yeah, I got it. All the way down.

Two clicks.

AUDREY

Dated this guy last summer. A

marine. Had a thing for guns.

Parents hated him.

KYLE

I bet they did.

AUDREY

My parents hate everything I do.

That's why we were moving.

KYLE

Yeah?

69.

AUDREY

They thought a more "wholesome"

environment would help me "change

my ways." So fucked up. Only

reason they care at all is cuz they

don't want to be embarrassed in

front of their friends at the

country club.

KYLE

The only time my old man ever paid

attention to me was when I was

doing somethin' bad. So you know

what I did?

AUDREY

What?

KYLE

I got really good at being bad.

70.

BOB

We back in business?

MICHAEL

I don't think so.

AUDREY

Is it over?

KYLE

I don't know.

KYLE

(raising his gun)

You better get downstairs.

AUDREY

No, I can handle it.

KYLE

(handing her the gun)

Just in case.

KYLE

Get ready.

71.

KYLE

(lowering his gun)

Wait a minute.

AUDREY

Kyle, are they...

KYLE

It's a trap. They saw them coming

and turned on the lights. It's a

fucking trap!

KYLE AND AUDREY

Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a

trap!

AUDREY

They're not gonna make it.

72.

AUDREY

(pushing his barrel down)

Wait! You'll hit them too!

AUDREY

Kyle!

BOB

Jesus Christ, what the hell is that

boy doin'!

CHARLIE

We have to get `im back in here!

MICHAEL

Don't. You open that door and we

could all be dead.

73.

KYLE

I got you!

YOUNG BOY (O.S.)

Mister...

YOUNG BOY

(WHISPERS)

Fooled ya.

AUDREY

Kyle!

BOB

Damn it all to hell!

CHARLIE

Oh, no.   Audrey...

74.

YOUNG BOY

I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to!

AUDREY

Fuck you!

YOUNG BOY

You're gonna die now.

CHARLIE

Do you have no heart?!     She's just

a kid!

CHARLIE

You can't let her die!

(grabbing a gun from the

TABLE)

I swear if you don't do something,

I will!

MICHAEL

Wait.

75.

MICHAEL

(raising his guns)

Open the door.

MICHAEL

Come with me.

MICHAEL

Run.

76.

CHARLIE

Michael!

BOB

(pulling Charlie away from

the door)

Get back!

CHARLIE

I'll get some water!

77.

YOUNG BOY

C'mon, don't be scared. I just

wanna play with your baby.

MICHAEL

Are you hurt?

CHARLIE

Where is he?!

JEEP'S VOICE

He's still in here!

BOB'S VOICE

Where the fuck is he?!

78.

JEEP

He's bleeding!

BOB

What the fuck?

JEEP

Dad!

MICHAEL

Get ready!

CHARLIE

Oh, no!

CUT TO:

79.

AUDREY

What am I supposed to do? Just

`cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I

automatically know how to do this!

MICHAEL

Just do as I say.

AUDREY

Yeah, but, how do you know how to

do this?!

BOB

What a way to bring a child into

the world.

(looks over at Jeep)

She ever tell you his name?

JEEP

She's never said. I just assumed

it was Joe Danvers. You know how

she's always had a thing for bad

boys.

80.

BOB

Jeep, sooner or later she'll

realize you're the best thing

that's ever happened to her.

JEEP

I thought you said I should move

on?

BOB

Can't a father be wrong sometimes?

JEEP

What was that...?

AUDREY

What is that?!

MICHAEL

He's coming. We have to hurry.

AUDREY

Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?

This isn't something you can

exactly hurry, is it?

MICHAEL

Charlie, I need you to push. I

need you to push as hard as you

can.

AUDREY

Michael, who's coming?!

MICHAEL

We're almost there...

81.

JEEP

We're not gonna make it outta here,

are we?

BOB

I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be

happening to you...

AUDREY

Oh my god...we did it!    Charlie,

you did it!

AUDREY

(CONFUSED)

It's okay. The baby's okay.

CHARLIE

I don't...I...

MICHAEL

Take him... Give her a minute.

82.

AUDREY

It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...

CHARLIE

So are we safe now?   Is it over?

MICHAEL

No. Killing the child would have

ended the war before it had begun.

Now, at least, he will have a

chance to grow up, a chance to lead

the world out of darkness.

CHARLIE

And what happens until then...?

MICHAEL

You'll need to teach him how.

CHARLIE

What makes you think I can do that?

What makes you think I want to do

that? If he's so important, why

don't you take him?

MICHAEL

Each of us has a burden. This one

is yours and yours alone. Maybe

someday you'll understand what that

means.

AUDREY

Mama? Can you hear me?

(holds up the baby)

We did it...The baby's alive.

(MORE)

83.

AUDREY (cont'd)

(BEAT)

Mama?

DISSOLVE TO:

JEEP

Something's happening.    They're

moving away.

84.

MICHAEL

The Possessed can't come near the

child, so He sent someone that can.

Someone like me.

BOB

Who?

MICHAEL

Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come

to do what I wouldn't.

JEEP

Your orders...

JEEP

You were the one who was supposed

to kill the baby? That was the

order you didn't obey.

CHARLIE

What's he talking about?

CHARLIE

Michael, what the hell's he talking

about?!

MICHAEL

There was never meant to be a

Second Coming. But we've just

changed that. The child lives.

The future is unwritten. There's

still hope.

CHARLIE

Audrey...?

85.

SANDRA

Stay away from me!    Don't come any

closer!

AUDREY

Mom!

BOB

Don't do it, lady!

SANDRA

You heard what he said. They just

want the baby. Maybe if we just

give it to them, then they'll let

us go!

CHARLIE

Give him to me!

SANDRA

Why?! You never wanted him in the

first place!

CHARLIE

No...   I...

SANDRA

It's just one baby.   Just one.

86.

BOB (O.S.)

Sonuvabitch!

87.

JEEP

No!

MICHAEL

No, Jeep! You must protect the

child now!

JEEP

Me?!   What about you?

MICHAEL

My path ends here. You are the

true protector. You always have

been.

JEEP

But I don't know what to do!

MICHAEL

Find the Prophets.   Learn to read

the instructions.

JEEP

Prophets? What Prophets?   What

instructions?!

JEEP

C'mon!

88.

CHARLIE

Wait!     We can't leave him!

JEEP

We have no choice!    We have to get

to Red Rock!

JEEP

Dad!

BOB

Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here,

remember?

JEEP

But Dad...!

BOB

Run.

89.

MICHAEL

I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You

were always so eager to please Him.

GABRIEL

Unlike you...the rebellious son.

(noticing Michael's scars)

Pity about your wings. They would

have helped you now.

MICHAEL

To not feel their burden...is a

dream.

GABRIEL

You think you can defy Him and not

pay the price?

MICHAEL

The child lives. What happens to

me doesn't matter now.

GABRIEL

Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You

can help them sneak out the back

door, but they won't escape.

(BEAT)

And neither will you, brother.

MICHAEL

(SOFT)

I'm not running anymore.

MICHAEL

(SENSING)

Join with me. You don't need do

this. There's another way.

GABRIEL

There is no other way...

90.

91.

CHARLIE

Come on, Jeep!

JEEP

I'm trying!

JEEP

Fuck!

JEEP

(throwing the car in

REVERSE)

Hang on!

92.

JEEP

Okay, we need to figure out our

weapon situation.   Hopefully

Michael didn't take everything out

of the car.

CHARLIE

Is this what I think it is?

JEEP

Yes. Now just put it down...

Slowly.

AUDREY

(holding up each item)

Okay, all I got is a flare gun

thing. Looks like we got a box of

flares to go with it.

JEEP

Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A

a flare gun... And a grenade.

Alright.

(hands Charlie the Glock)

Load this.

(BEAT)

Audrey, can you figure out how to

load that flare gun without killing

us all?

AUDREY

I can try.

JEEP

Try real hard, okay?

93.

GABRIEL

You always wanted to live like one

of them...Now you'll know how it

feels to die like one of them.

94.

AUDREY

Go faster!

JEEP

I can't fuckin' see!

JEEP

Oh, no.

CHARLIE

Jeep, your arm!

CHARLIE

What is it?

95.

JEEP

The instructions...

BOB

Sorry...   We're closed.

CHARLIE

The swarm, it's fading!

96.

JEEP

Thank you...

JEEP

Oh, shit!

AUDREY

I can't believe it.   Is it really

over...?

JEEP

No...It's just starting...

97.

JEEP

Better not hold him too long.

Might get attached.

CHARLIE

Look, I'm sorry for what I said to

you earlier, `bout you following me

around. I didn't mean it.

JEEP

Nothin' to be sorry about. It's

true. I did follow you around. At

least now I know there was a good

reason.

AUDREY

We're here.

JEEP

Okay, all we gotta do is --

98.

AUDREY

Jeep!

JEEP

Duck!

JEEP

Audrey, the flare gun!

99.

JEEP

Get down on the floor!

AUDREY (O.S.)

Get off her, you fucking asshole!

AUDREY

Do it, Jeep! Do it now!

CHARLIE

C'mon, Jeep!

100.

CHARLIE

Jeep!

JEEP

The baby?

CHARLIE

Alive.

JEEP

And what about...

CHARLIE

Nothing could have survived that.

JEEP

(ANGUISHED)

Audrey...

CHARLIE

She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved

us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!

CHARLIE

How can this happen?

JEEP

What?

CHARLIE

How can this happen in a world so

beautiful?

101.

JEEP

C'mon, we're almost there.

GABRIEL

So brave. So pointless. You

should have worried more about

saving yourself.

CHARLIE

Stop!   Please! Don't kill him!

GABRIEL

Go to sleep...

102.

CHARLIE

Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!

CHARLIE

I don't want this responsibility!

JEEP

Charlie, no!

GABRIEL

"And as the child's cries are

extinguished, an eternal darkness

at last descended upon the world."

103.

JEEP

We made it.

CHARLIE

Yep, we sure did.

JEEP

I'm sure they're just over the next

ridge.

CHARLIE

What if we're on our own now?

JEEP

Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.

(BEAT)

Believe me.

104.

CHARLIE'S VOICE

Someday when my son is older, I

will tell him about the time of his

birth when all the world was

covered in a great darkness...

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE'S VOICE

... And how just at the moment when

everything seemed lost...

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

...a mighty warrior fell in order

to save me.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

And a boy faced his fear and rose

up to save us all.
