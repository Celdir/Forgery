BEN

This was your best race.

JOHAN

(excited)

I beat him, Papa.

BEN

(proudly)

You did son. Come on, shower.

BEN

I'll be expecting you. There

isn't much to do, only weeding

the marigolds and watering the

lawn and flowers.

(CONTINUED)

2.

GORDON

We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir,

Jonathan come to help me.

BEN

And how's the algebra?   Still

giving you trouble?

JONATHAN

(with respect)

Just a little, Mr. Ben'sir.

JOHAN

Me too.

GORDON

(straightening himself)

He's working hard, Mr. Ben'sir,

and your money will not be

wasted. Emily and me will always

thank you.

BEN

(as he leaves)

See you both later.

GORDON

(shouting angrily)

U ya phi?

(Where are you going?)

(CONTINUED)

3.

LEADER

Your children are starving and you

are drinking. We demand freedom

and our fathers are drunk. We ask

you to boycott these beer halls.

Revolution and drink don't work

together!

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS

Since when do children talk like

this to their fathers? They need

thrashing.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MRS. COETZEE (WOMAN)

He won't come to church. He lies

in bed all day, listening to his

headphones.

BEN

I wondered why he wasn't at

school. Would it help if I came

to see him? He's always seemed a

good kid to me.

MRS. COETZEE

Oh, would you?

BEN

Of course. I'll phone and we can

fix a time.

SUSAN

Ben!   Ben!

(CONTINUED)

5.

SUSAN

Mrs. Coetzee.    She looked worried.

BEN

She's having trouble with her boy.

He won't come to school.

SUSAN

So you said you'd have a word with

him?

BEN

Yes!

BEN

Gordon!   What are you doing here?

GORDON

That's not why I'm complaining,

Mister Ben, sir. If he did wrong,

I'd beat him myself. But he

didn't.

(CONTINUED)

6.

GORDON

He did nothing and they wouldn't

listen. They wouldn't believe

him.

BEN

I'm sorry, Gordon.    But there

must be a reason.

GORDON

He says he wasn't doing anything

wrong, Mister Ben, sir. And I

believe him, I know my son! It's

an injustice!

BEN

What about the court?    Didn't he

state his case?

GORDON

What does he know about court?

Before he knew, it was all over.

BEN

I don't think there is anything we

can do about it now.

GORDON

We can get a lawyer to appeal.

BEN

A lawyer? That won't heal

Jonathan's buttocks.

SUSAN

Ben!

BEN

I'll be out in a minute.

GORDON

You don't understand, Mister Ben,

sir. I don't want him to have a

police record.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

7.

GORDON  (CONT'D)

It will be there for  the rest of

his life and make it  difficult for

him to get a job in  the future.

BEN

Don't worry, Gordon. I'm sure

there'll be no record, it's such

a minor case. Please don't worry.

BEN

Johan, get some iodine from the

cupboard.

GORDON

I'm not worried about the wounds.

They'll heal in time, Mister Ben,

sir. It's the wounds here.

(slaps his chest)

I worry about. Injustice... it

festers.

BEN

(to Gordon)

Rub it on the wounds and it will

help.

SUSAN

Trouble?

BEN

Jonathan has been caned, by the

police.

(CONTINUED)

8.

SUSAN

He probably deserved it.

"No to the Oppressor's language"

"Bantu education is slave

education."

STUDENT LEADER (BOY)

You all know why we are going to

march.

STUDENTS

'No to Bantu education'

'No to apartheid'

'Freedom Now'...

STUDENT LEADER

There must be discipline. We

start marching from here and we'll

join up with the others at the

main road. Please take care of

the younger ones. Let's go.

(CONTINUED)

9.

"ONE MAN ONE VOTE"

"FREE OUT LEADERS"

"NO TO THE AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE"

STUDENTS

'If we learn Afrikaans vorster

must learn Zulu.' 'Bantu

education! Stinks! Stinks!

Stinks!' 'Equal education! Now!

Now! Now!'

COMMANDANT

Now listen to me, this is an

illegal demonstration. I order

you to disperse immediately.

(CONTINUED)

10.

COMMANDANT

This is the last warning.

Disperse immediately or I will

take action.

JONATHAN

Wellington!   Wellington!

GIRL

Shoot me!   Come on, shoot me!

Shoot me!

(CONTINUED)

11.

CUT TO:

their school, massed in conviviality, Johan one.

overall of a groundsman, intent in his task.

OVER this white pacifist content, hear...

... GUNSHOTS, SCREAMS, TERROR.

The carnage, the dead, the wounded. The stunned

bewilderment of blacks and police alike... even the

latter unnerved by their own brutality.

(CONTINUED)

12.

LARGE WOMAN

(to man in front of

her)

Careful with your bag. Can't you

see where it's touching?

MAN #1

(standing half-way

down carriage)

Can I see where it's touching?

LARGE WOMAN

Men of today only like looking.

MAN #2

(standing by a door)

It's the electricity.

MAN IN KHAKI UNIFORM

What has electricity to do with

it?

MAN #2

Today with the electricity they

say:

(in an affected

voice)

'Darling let's not switch off

the light.'

WOMAN #1

(standing very near

Gordon)

I hope you have electricity with

those thick glasses of yours.

With your eyes you couldn't find

anything.

MAN #3

Tell us, does your wife also wear

thick glasses?

MAN #2

(quickly)

You should know, she's your

sister.

(CONTINUED)

13.

MAN IN BLUE OVERALLS

Quiet!   Thulani! Thulani!

MAN IN BLUE OVERALLS

They are killing our children

and you are making jokes...

VOICE (O.S.)

They say hundreds of children have

died and Soweto is burning.

SMARTLY-DRESSED MAN

The white people, they will pay,

and soon.

YOUNG WOMAN

'They will pay, they will pay.' Since

when have they been killing us, putting

us in jails, starving our children to

death, taking our land? Hundreds of

years. And what have you men done?

Only talk, talk, talk. You are not

men. Sis. (Shit.)

"That's the superintendent's office

on fire."

"I hope the children are home."

"We have to dodge bullets tonight."

"Vorster must hang for this."

"I hope the world hears about this."

14.

GORDON

(to girl)

Are you sure it was Jonathan

they took away?

GIRL (DAUGHTER)

Yes, baba, with Wellington.

STANLEY

No, no, I understand, Baas, but is

that all the names? There's no

other list somewhere?

SERGEANT VAN ZYL

I'm telling you. He's not in

custody. Have you tried the

hospital? Have you tried the

mortuary?

SERGEANT VAN ZYL

I'm only suggesting the

possibilities.

STANLEY

But, what about John Voster

Square?

(CONTINUED)

15.

SERGEANT VAN ZYL

Look, I've tried to help you.

STANLEY

Thank you.

STANLEY

You're here too, sis Paulina, who

are you looking for?

WOMAN

They picked up my girl -- 13-year-

old girl!

STANLEY

(comforting her)

We are all searching.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

16.

STANLEY

What now?

GORDON

He is our son... we must find him.

JULIUS

I'll make more inquiries -- John

Vorster Square -- the special

branch -- but I don't hold out

much hope.

GORDON

You're a lawyer, Julius!

STANLEY

(laughs)

A black lawyer! Those Boers...

the bastards'll kick him around

till they lose him.

EMILY

What about the Baas? If he asks,

they will give him an answer.

GORDON

(bitterly)

When the boy was flogged he didn't

help. Why should he help him now?

17.

JOHAN

Hi, Gordon.

BEN

(to Johan)

Hold it, champ.

BEN

Gordon, you okay?

JOHAN

Isn't this Jonathan's day to help

you?

BEN

How is he, recovering?

GORDON

I don't know, Mister Ben, sir --

the police took him.

BEN

Again?

JOHAN

What for?

(CONTINUED)

18.

GORDON

They arrested many. They even

deny they've got him. He's

disappeared...

BEN

Disappeared? He's a child -- why

didn't you tell me?

BEN

Okay!   I'll see what I can find

out.

BEN

Our gardener, yes. Probably

nothing, but he's worried.

LEWINSON

... And when was this?

LEWINSON

Ngubene -- Jonathan Ngubene.

(CONTINUED)

19.

LEWINSON

I'll get on to them straight away...

Not at all -- I think better this

time of morning -- after lunch,

man, I'm a zombie.

(laughs)

Sure -- let you know straight away

-- love to, Susan... Cheers!

(puts down phone;

presses his intercom)

Freda! Open an account... Du Toit.

Benjamin Du Toit... Subject...

Jonathan Ngubene.

-- CHATTERING out -- on Lewinson's headed note paper:

To the Commissioner of Police

Police Headquarters

John Vorster Square

Dear Sir,

On behalf of our client, Gordon Ngubene,

we are anxious to discover the whereabouts

of his son...

ROOM

Wellington, Jonathan's friend, is sitting alone in

fear. Through the wall he can hear MOANING -- SCREAMS.

He closes his eyes tight as if to shut out what he

is hearing.

-- CHATTERING out -- on police headquarters note paper:

To Lewinson & Partners Solicitors

Dear Sirs,

With reference to your enquiry concerning

Jonathan Ngubene, we suggest you take the matter

up directly with the particular officer in

charge...

... the whereabouts of Jonathan Ngubene, aged

15, who was apparently detained by you...

The type keys hesitate, tremble, for a considerable

number of seconds, on and on, as if deliberately de-

laying or uncertain how to answer.

confronted by Gordon and Emily. She shakes her

head vigorously, denying all knowledge, shows them the

door.

Dear Sirs,

With reference to your enquiry seeking the

whereabouts of Jonathan Ngubene, we are sorry

to inform you we have no record of anyone of

that name...

SUPERINTENDENT

It's preposterous. I would have

known -- of such a case... I

mean... in my hospital. You

people! You're always raking

up trouble!

At the back of police headquarters, John Vorster Square.

An elderly black cleaner, emptying garbage, is being

shown Jonathan's photograph. He looks -- and nods --

pointing down as meaning the basement.

21.

LEWINSON

... Freda -- I said no calls...

Oh... Right... put them through.

Hallo! Yes! How are you?...

that is correct.

LEWINSON

Very well. Thank you for finally

letting us know.

LEWINSON

(to client)

Sorry.

BEN

Hello, Dan... No... it's all

right...

LEWINSON

I'm sorry. They have just

officially informed me. The boy

was never in detention. He died

... the day of the riots and

as nobody came to claim the corpse

he was buried a month ago.

(CONTINUED)

22.

BEN

Thanks a lot, Dan... I'll tell

Gordon. 'Bye.

A VOICE overlays all this... strange... ironically

GORDON

Mister Ben, sir. If it was me,

all right. And if it was Emily,

all right. We are not young. But

he's out child. My time and your

time, it's passing. But the time

of our children is coming. And

now if they kill our children --

if we let them -- what is it that

we lived for?

BEN

(places a hand on

Gordon's shoulder --

comforting)

What can we do, Gordon? You or

I... We can't change it.

GORDON

That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they

whipped Jonathan, you also said we

can do nothing. But if we had...

if someone heard what we had to say

this would not have happened.

BEN

It's a terrible thing, Gordon --

God knows I'm sorry. But you have

other children to live for... I'll

help them too with their schooling.

(CONTINUED)

23.

GORDON

(interrupting)

How did he die, Mister Ben, sir?

BEN

I told you, Gordon... He died on

the day of the riots.

GORDON

That's what  they say. But I got

to know for  certain. How can I

have peace?   I must know how my

son died and  where they buried

him.

BEN

Gordon.   The police -- if they've

said...

GORDON

I don't care what they say. He is

my child. God is my witness today:

I cannot stop before I know what

happened and where he lies. His

body belongs to Emily and me.

CLOETE (V.O.)

... This business of Gordon's son.

Be careful, Ben. These are not

normal times -- one has to make

allowances.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

24.

BEN

Don't worry! I'm no crusader.

I've known Gordon a long time,

that's all.

CLOETE

I understand -- it's your

Christian duty to your neighbor.

BEN

Something like that -- yes.

CLOETE

Just don't get too close.

Teachers must stay out of

politics. Love to Susan!

ROBERT

Look who's coming? It's baba!

EMILY

Oh, no... oh no, Lord.

EMILY

(sobbing and repeating)

Please don't tell me...

25.

BOY

(to Stanley)

Baba, I heard you're looking for

Wellington. He's out, Baba.

STANLEY

Where is he?   Where is he?

BOY

He's with some boys at Dube's

shop.

STANLEY

Thank you very much. You've

worked like a man.

(turning to Gordon)

Let's go.

STANLEY

Take it easy, boys. Hey

Wellington!

STANLEY

What happened... Don't tell me...

GORDON

Did they do that to you?

(CONTINUED)

26.

GORDON

(anxiously)

I want to know what happened to

Jonathan.

WELLINGTON

Isn't he out yet?

(pause)

I last saw him weeks ago.

STANLEY

Jonathan is dead.

GORDON

I have to know how he died.

SUSAN

Isn't that tragic? Jonathan was

such a nice boy. Even played with

my Johan when they were small,

God.

BEN

And he was such a nice boy, well-

mannered.

SUSAN

You said he was very bright at

school.

SUZETTE

Well, this kind of journalism

doesn't help the situation. Look

at her face? What does she look

like?

CHRIS

The Rand Daily Mail always

exaggerates.

(CONTINUED)

27.

BEN

Looks quite attractive to me.

BEN

(he surveys the

article; then with

a serious tone)

'... Is only the latest in scores

of black youths who have

disappeared whilst in police

custody.'

CHRIS

What does she expect? They're out

of control. Give then an inch and

they take a hundred miles. It's

in their nature. The only

language they understand is force.

JOHAN

Chris, Jonathan was fifteen, like

me. Would you use force on me?

CHRIS

You're not a terrorist. If you

were -- like an increasing number

of them, you'd deserve it. Look,

every time you pick up the

newspaper...

BEN

(interrupts; focusing

on the paper)

My God, one hundred shot! They

didn't have to kill them.

SUSAN

This bloody Bruwer woman reports

one hundred shot, but the radio

said only twenty and the police

were attacked first.

SUZETTE

I thought the idea was to give

them their own areas, banstustans.

Let them live with their own kind.

No chance of conflict then.

Everybody's happy.

(CONTINUED)

28.

JOHAN

And who would do the work?

SUZETTE

Pardon?

JOHAN

The work, who'd do it?

SUSAN

You for a start. Come on!    Help

me clear these dishes.

GORDON

'On the second day of our detention

at John Vorster Square we were

taken to one of the top floors.

We were ordered to undress and

they started to beat us with fists

and sjamboks. This for a long

time.'

GORDON

'On one day me and Jonathan...'

(CONTINUED)

29.

GORDON

'... We were asked questions for

the whole day and night by Capt.

Stolz and different policemen --

they never stopped. They tried to

force us to say we were the

leaders at our school, that we

were working for the A.N.C. and

got money from overseas. Capt.

Stolz wanted to know the names of

the students committee and where

he can find Toni Mtimkulu --

Everytime they asked question,

they beat us. It was bad beating.'

GORDON

'We told them we had done nothing

and didn't know about all the

things they are asking us; on two

occasion they put a wet bag over

my head and I -- couldn't breathe

-- I thought I was going to die.

One day I heard Jonathan being

beaten. He was screaming and

crying, and then a noise like

tables and chairs being knocked

down, and Capt. Stolz shouting

"you bastard, get up, do you hear

me?" Ngubene, don't pretend here,

get up." Then the next day I

heard he had gone to hospital and

I never saw him again.'

(CONTINUED)

30.

LIEUTENANT VENTER

Stay right where you are.

STOLZ

(to Gordon)

On your feet! So, you must be

Gordon Ngubene?

STOLZ

We know each other, don't we?

STOLZ

(turning to Venter)

Gert, in daardie kammer.

(Gert, that room)

(turning to the other

one)

Jaimie, in die ander.

(Jamie, the other room)

LIEUTENANT VENTER

Niks, Kaptein.

(Nothing, Captain)

STOLZ

Take the bastards away.

(CONTINUED)

31.

GORDON (V.O.)

That day, Mister Ben, sir, when

they whipped Jonathan, you also

said we can do nothing. God as my

witness today: I must know what

happened and where he lies. His

body belongs to Emily and me.

BEN

Jeezus -- Jeezus -- Jeezus Christ.

JOHAN

Good night, Papa!

(CONTINUED)

32.

JOHAN

Oh, Papa!

SUSAN

Coffee!   Come on, Johan.   Time for

bed.

BEN

Yes, son.   Go and get some sleep.

SUSAN

I'm proud of you, Ben... what

you've done for that family. But

darling, you shouldn't take these

things to heart so much. What

more can you do about it?

BEN

I don't know.    I'm just tired, I

suppose.

SUSAN

(stroking his hair

gently)

Come, come to bed.

BEN

I will, in a minute. I'll just put

the thoughts of Standar Six away.

They mustn't be lost to posterity.

(CONTINUED)

33.

OFFICE VOICE (V.O.)

'... Seeking the whereabouts of a

certain Jonathan Ngubene, regret to

inform you we have no record of

anyone of that name...'

What year did the first white man arrive in South

Africa?

When was the Battle of Blood River?

Who was the Zulu chief who was defeated at the battle

of Isanadlawana?

Who was the president of the first Afrikander

Republic?

Give the route of the Voortrekkers from the cape?

BEN

(slapping the student's

back)

All right, time up! Hand in your

test.

(CONTINUED)

34.

BEN

What's happened, Emily?

EMILY

(calmly)

I'm sorry, Baas... but it's

Gordon.

STANLEY

(putting out his hand)

How's it? I'm Stanley! I heard

about you!

EMILY

This is Stanley Makhaya... He

helps us all the time.

BEN

Don't worry too much, Emily, I'm

sure Gordon will be home in a few

days.

35.

STOLZ

Come on, Kaffir, talk!

GORDON

Please, I've done nothing.   All I

tried to do was to find...

LIEUTENANT VENTER

Up with those bloody arms!

STOLZ

We don't like gramophone records

here! Now who has been giving

you informations?

LIEUTENANT VENTER

(very calmly)

Why don't you answer the Captain,

han?

STOLZ

Johannes!    The bag!

STOLZ

All right.

(CONTINUED)

36.

CUT TO:

POLICEMAN

Somebody will meet you on second

floor.

STOLZ

(hysterically)

Come on you bloody black bastard.

Who has been telling you lies?

STOLZ

(calmly)

I'll be down immediately, Colonel.

CUT TO:

37.

VILJOEN

Come in, Mr. Du Toit, come in.

How do you do?

BEN

Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen.

VILJOEN

I used to watch you play for the

Transvaal. You were one of the

great wing forwards.

BEN

(grinning)

Long time ago.

VILJOEN

Come in.

VILJOEN

Captain Stolz, Mr. Du Toit.

VILJOEN

(to Ben)

Do sit down.

VILJOEN

All right now, Gordon Ngubene.

(CONTINUED)

38.

BEN

Well... to put it simply, Colonel...

VILJOEN

(smiling)

I'm always grateful for that.

BEN

I thought there might have been

some kind of misunderstanding I

could help straighten out.

VILJOEN

Like what?

BEN

I know him, Colonel. He works

at my school. He's done work for

me too.

VILJOEN

And you feel you know him enough

to vouch for him.

BEN

Yes, after so many years... 10

years. Gordon's not the type to

get himself in trouble. He's an

honest, hard-working, church-

going man.

VILJOEN

Ha! You'd be surprised how many

honest, decent, church-going men

we come across during a working

day.

VILJOEN

It's routine, Mr. Du Toit -- a

routine enquiry. Cleaning up

these townships we must leave no

stone unturned.

BEN

I appreciate that -- but Gordon

would never...

VILJOEN

(interrupting)

Not an easy task either -- the

press screaming blue murder --

especially the English.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

39.

VILJOEN (CONT'D)

And they'll be the first to squeal

if the Reds took over, make no

mistake. Rushing back overseas

clutching their bloody British

passports. Have you any idea what

will happen here if we don't

follow every lead? We have a

duty -- obligation. You have your

job -- we have ours.

BEN

Colonel -- believe me, I'm with

you all the way. But in this

case -- I'm sure that in your

worthy pursuit of the guilty you

have, unwittingly, involved the

innocent. After all, we're all

human. We all make mistakes

sometimes.

VILJOEN

We are indeed, Mr. Du Toit -- we

are indeed. Though there's many

who might need persuading as to

that fact.

VILJOEN

Mr. Du Toit. While you're here,

would you mind if I asked you a

few questions about Ngubene?

BEN

(genuinely)

Colonel, I'd welcome it.

VILJOEN

Good!

VILJOEN

Shall we start with his son?

(CONTINUED)

40.

BEN

Jonathan.

VILJOEN

The eldest.

BEN

Yes.   He died some time ago.

VILJOEN

What do you know about Gordon's

activities since Jonathan's death?

BEN

Nothing, Colonel.

VILJOEN

Did Gordon ever discuss the death

with you?

BEN

Of course he did -- he was upset.

VILJOEN

But he accepted the truth?

BEN

He is a religious man... in the

end he would have resigned himself

to it.

VILJOEN

Would have? You mean he didn't?

Was he angry? Rebellious?

BEN

Come on, Colonel! If one of your

kids died...

(nods to family picture

on desk)

... and nobody would tell you how

it happened or where his body is

buried, wouldn't you be upset?

STOLZ

We told him how his son died, Mr.

Du Toit.

(CONTINUED)

41.

VILJOEN

You have a son, Mr. Du Toit?

VILJOEN

Does he burn and destroy --

everything he can lay his hands

on?... No -- and neither does

mine. That's what I can't

understand... after everything

the government does for them.

(looks straight at Ben)

Think about it, Mr. Du Toit.

We're for you, not against you.

BEN

(irritably)

I've never doubted it, Colonel.

It's you who appear to be doubting

me. These questions.   You're

making me feel like a criminal.

VILJOEN

I'm sorry, Mr. Du Toit... I'm

sorry. It's force of habit. Once

a policeman, always a policeman,

eh?

VILJOEN

... As soon as we're satisfied

he's innocent, he will be released.

We know what we're doing, Mr. Du

Toit. You want your wife and that

boy of yours to sleep safe tonight,

don't you?

(CONTINUED)

42.

BEN

One last favor, Colonel?

VILJOEN

Fire away!

BEN

Gordon's wife -- she's very

worried. May she bring him some

food and a change of clothes while

he's still here?

VILJOEN

No problem!    Thank you for your

help...

BEN

Thank you.    I'll rely on you, then.

VILJOEN

Will you find your way out?

BEN

I think so. And thanks.    I feel

much happier now.

VILJOEN

Good! And give my regards to

your father-in-law -- tell him

we'll have a drink sometime --

maybe go to a game.

BEN

I will.   Goodbye.

VILJOEN

(pointing up)

Is the little bird singing yet?

STOLZ

I'm working on it.

VILJOEN

Good.

CUT TO:

43.

BEN

I talked to them. Gordon will be

released soon. The colonel was

very understanding.

JOHAN

Did you see Gordon?

BEN

(embarrassed)

No.

JOHAN

Did they say anything about

Jonathan?

BEN

No, but... Johan, he is dead. We

can't do anything for him. Don't

mention this visit to your mother.

Okay?

SUZETTE

What extra-mural interest?

SUSAN

Champion of political detainees!

SUZETTE

(laughing, turns to

Ben)

Is that right, Papa?

(CONTINUED)

44.

BEN

That's right, Suzette. But, only

one detainee: 'Gordon!'

SUZETTE

Our Gordon?

BEN

That's right.

SUZETTE

(disbelieving)

My God. What on earth for?

SUZETTE

It must be a mistake, Papa.

BEN

Of course it is. I went down

there, told them. They're looking

into it.

SUZETTE

Went down where?

BEN

John Vorster Square.

SUZETTE

You old devil you. Does Ma know?

BEN

No. And you're not going to tell

her.

(CONTINUED)

45.

SUZETTE

Be careful. I don't want my

favorite Papa in trouble, Gordon

or no Gordon.

BEN

More wine?   Viviers?

VIVIERS

Not for me, Oom Ben. I'm drunk

enough.

BEN

Mrs. Cloete?

MRS. CLOETE

Please!

MRS. CLOETE

(to Mrs. Bester)

Oh, I saw those sheets you liked,

Sally, on sale at Bloom's.

MRS. BESTER

Will you be free on Wednesday

afternoon? I have one or two

other things to buy.

SUSAN

(turning to the door)

Come in.

(CONTINUED)

46.

SUSAN

(surprised)

Who are you? What do you want?

CUT TO:

BEN

It's all right.

BEN

Oh, it's you... hum... Stanley,

isn't it?

(to Susan)

That's all right, darling.

LEWINSON

A Friday night, man! I'm no

doctor, I'm not on standby all the

bloody time. Can't they wait 'til

Monday?

BEN

Dan! I'm standing here with

Gordon's clothing in my hand.

It's bloodstained...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

47.

BEN (CONT'D)

There are broken teeth in the

pocket. Monday may be too late!

(pause)

The lawyer has been banned.

LEWINSON

(interested)

Do you mean Julius Nqakula?

(pause)

Too bad, he's a good lawyer. Why

are you getting so involved, Ben?

BEN

I'm just trying to help Gordon.

... You represented many cases,

tell me, does this happen often?

(pause)

But Gordon's not political.

(pause)

Okay, Dan, I'm sorry for

disturbing your weekend.

BEN

He agrees to see you tomorrow and

will apply to the supreme court

for an interdict to stop any

assaults on Gordon. And, we'll

find out what's going on.

STANLEY

You're all right, Lanie.

EMILY

Thank you, Baas.

STANLEY

Come on, sisi. Tomorrow it'll all

be first-class again.

48.

SUSAN

More coffee, anyone?

CLOETE

The security police don't arrest

people for nothing, Ben. Leave

it alone.

BEN

They could make a mistake.

CLOETE

Blacks lead double lives. One

you see and one you don't. These

people surprise you all the time.

VIVIERS

(joking)

That's what I like about them.

BEN

We're not concerned with 'blacks.'

We're talking about GORDON. A

good man and very loyal.

SUSAN

(serving coffee to

Cloete)

And a hard worker too.

CLOETE

A hard worker? I had to get rid

of him.

BEN

What?

CLOETE

I fired him a few days before he

was arrested for staying away from

work for days. And for the sake

of the school I say good riddance.

BEN

What do you mean 'good riddance'?

(CONTINUED)

49.

CLOETE

I have a responsibility for the

children. These are troubled

times, Ben, we can't trust the

natives any more.

BESTER

You have to be extra careful about

any influences, Oom Ben. Even

their churches are breeding

grounds for all sorts of evil

ideas.

BEN

Gordon's not subversive and

definitely not a Communist.

CLOETE

Then he's got nothing to worry

about!

VIVIERS

Except his three teeth. Our

government mustn't allow such

things to happen. After all, it's

a Christian government.

(turning to Bester)

What do you say, Dominee?

BEN

(irritably)

I'm not talking about the

government! I believe in our

government, damn it...

BEN

... Look, I know the police often

know more than we do. I'm not

questioning that. I'm as loyal as

the next man. But I do know

Gordon Ngubene... there is

something wrong.

SUZETTE

(putting the tray in

front of Ben)

Anything else, Papa?

(CONTINUED)

50.

BEN

Dominee?

BESTER

Nee Dankie.

VIVIERS

Oom, Ben, may your problems be

small ones!

CAPTAIN STOLZ (O.S.)

Sorry I'm late.

CAPTAIN STOLZ

Johnannes, the table.

(CONTINUED)

51.

LIEUTENANT VENTER

You're a heavy shitface. Too much

mealie porridge!

STOLZ

How do you feel today?   Ready to

fly?

STOLZ

(pointing one sheet

of paper)

Yes, Mister Ngubene, we know about

this Wellington... and...

(pointing another

affidavit)

... We know about him... and him

... Now, we want the names of the

others. And today you're going

to tell us.

STOLZ

(to himself)

Bloody woman.

(to Johannes)

Water!

LIEUTENANT VENTER

'Samson' is ready, Captain, shall

I switch him on?

STOLZ

(to Venter)

Okay.   Gert!

GORDON

(reacts)

Hai!

(CONTINUED)

52.

STOLZ

That was a small taste of 'Samson.'

We have a whole day...

STOLZ

... Kom!

STOLZ

What do you want?

SEROKE

A letter for you, Captain.

STOLZ

What are you bloody-well waiting

for?

SEROKE

No reply, Captain?

STOLZ

Get out of here.

STOLZ

(to Gordon)

Now about these affidavits who

told you to collect them? The

A.N.C.? Who recruited you?

STOLZ

What?

GORDON

I don't know anything about the

A.N.C.

STOLZ

You've had your chance.    Now

you're going to shit.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

53.

STOLZ (CONT'D)

(to lieutenant in

Afrikaans)

Reg gert. (Okay, Gert)

GORDON

Hai!   Hai!   Hai!

BESTER

God created the whole human race

so that they could occupy the

entire earth. He decreed how

long each nation should flourish,

and what the boundaries of each

territory should be. Our task is

to preserve that creative diversity.

BESTER

Brothers and sisters, like our

forebears, the Voortrekkers, who

trekked into the wilderness

preserve the Afrikanere way of

life given to them by God. Today,

we also live in times of great

danger. Let not fear overcome

you! Cling to the ways of justice

and truth preserved by our leaders.

So shall God be honored...

BESTER

... So shall the Afrikaner people

flourish.

54.

SUSAN

Why didn't you tell me you'd been

down to John Vorster Square?

BEN

What difference would it have

made?

SUSAN

I'm your wife, damn it!

BEN

I didn't want to upset you.

SUSAN

Upset me? It upsets me when you

share your bloody secrets with a

child!

SUSAN

Ben! Ben! Look at me for God

sakes!

(turns to Johan)

Johan uit met jou!

BEN

(posing down the

plane)

Now what?

SUSAN

We have a good life. We may not

have everything we might have had

if...

BEN

(interrupts)

... If I'd been more ambitious.

(CONTINUED)

55.

SUSAN

(looking at him)

Ben, what's happening?

(pause)

Sometimes it seems to me I don't

know you.

BEN

What's happening -- it's something

I've never had to face -- deal

with -- before.

SUSAN

He's the gardener for God's sake,

not one of the family.

BEN

Be patient with me... When Gordon

is free you'll have me all to

yourself again... promise.

SUSAN

(nuzzling into his

chest)

Ben.    We're growing old.

BEN

Nonsense. One's as old as he

feels. I feel young and very

attractive. I can still do my

duty.

JOHAN

Papa.

SUSAN

(smiling indulgently at

Johan's interruption)

_______________________________

JOHAN

Stanley's here, Papa.

SUSAN

Oh, bloody hell!

(CONTINUED)

56.

STANLEY

Gordon's dead.

BEN

What?

STANLEY

The bastards say he committed

suicide... hanged himself.

BEN

Suicide... is that what they told

Emily -- poor woman...

STANLEY

They didn't tell her. She heard

it on the radio like the rest of

us. I contacted Lewinson

immediately. He then rung the

police to ask why Emily wasn't

informed. Would you believe it,

they said they were sorry, and they

didn't know where to contact her.

BEN

(almost to himself)

God! I never thought Gordon could

commit suicide.

STANLEY

Did you understand me? I said,

they said he committed suicide.

BEN

How do we know?

STANLEY

Gordon wasn't a coward.

(CONTINUED)

57.

BEN

Yes, but...

STANLEY

(interrupts aggressively)

What do you mean 'but'? What

about Timol who they said had

jumped from a top-floor window?

What about Ngudle? What about

Mosala? Joyi? Malele? They all

died in that John Vorster Square.

All suicide, eh?

BEN

Anything I can do to help?

STANLEY

He's got brothers.

BEN

(surprised)

Brothers?

STANLEY

I'm his brother, man, we all are!

We'll take care of everything.

(with pride)

That's the African way.

BEN

Stanley, I'd like to see Gordon.

STANLEY

Don't look for trouble, man. You

know there are riots all over

Soweto. You're out of it. Why

don't you stay out?

BEN

Don't you understand?   I've got to go.

STANLEY

(with a mischievous

smile)

You got to go? Of course, Lanie... the

last farewell. But we have to be careful.

(CONTINUED)

58.

STANLEY

We expected it.

BEN

How can you talk like that!?

STANLEY

A guy gets picked up by the S.B...

he's part of history, man.

BEN

You mean you had no hope, you

didn't believe he'd be released?

STANLEY

Hope's a white word, Lanie... It's

not hope we need.

BEN

Well, thank God Emily has you to

lean on, Stanley.

STANLEY

Emily is like my sister... We go

back many years.

BEN

Do you belong to the xhosa tribe too?

STANLEY

I am an African. That's all!

(looking through the

rear mirror)

Comprende?

BEN

I am an African too!

STANLEY

What?

BEN

I was fourteen before I wore shoes

-- except for church... I grew up

on a plaas miles from any town...

watching sheep and...

STANLEY

(interrupts)

Bullshit! Next you'll have me

believing we grew up in the same

country, same laws, same freedom,

same everything!

(CONTINUED)

59.

STANLEY

(like a tour guide)

We are now about to leave the

white jungle and entering the land

of love and glory.

BEN

So this is Soweto.

STANLEY

(like an actor, with

big expansive gesture)

Land of love and glory, Lanie!

(turning suddenly

to Ben)

But watch out for the police and

army. They're patrolling all the

time.

STANLEY

(opening door)

Hurry up, Lanie.

60.

STANLEY

(checking his pants'

pockets)

No sweets today. I'm sorry,

babies.

(CONTINUED)

61.

STANLEY

(turning to Ben)

'The living close the eyes of the

dead. The dead open the eyes of

the living.'

BEN

Please, take me to Emily.

STANLEY

Look, we'd took one hell of a

chance to get here, let's not push

it.

BEN

I really have to see her, Stanley.

STANLEY

(determined; looking

through rearview

mirror)

I said don't push it. I have to

keep you alive. What's more the

house is full of mourners.

(CONTINUED)

62.

STANLEY

What are your thoughts now?

BEN

What do you mean?

STANLEY

(aggressively)

Come on. I know you came to see

the body. What do you think now?

BEN

(exposed)

I... I cannot think.   I'm

confused.

STANLEY

You either believe what you saw

or maybe you still prefer the

government version.

BEN

For Christ sake, just get off my

back, Stanley.

STANLEY

Okay.   It was a simple question.

STANLEY

You know, Lanie, when you run a

taxi, especially a pirate taxi

like me, you have eyes and ears

everywhere. Even when a policeman

farts in his bed you know. People

want a reference book, a permit to

stay in Soweto, a house, anything,

we taxi drivers know the routes.

I'll tell you something...

(CONTINUED)

63.

STANLEY

Shit!

BEN

What?

STANLEY

Dr. Hassiem has been picked up.

BEN

Who's he?

STANLEY

Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got

to represent Emily at Gordon's

autopsy. We wanted the truth.

BEN

He would have testified.   Bloody

hell!

STANLEY

A smart move by your Boer

brothers. They have silenced

Hassiem.

BEN

His report has to be important.

We can only use what we have.

Therefore, Lewinson must get a

very good advocate.

(pause)

If only we could get   hold of this

Hassiem's report.

STANLEY

What's the use? It's one big game

and we blacks are merely

spectators. Hey Lanie, can one be

a spectator as he's being kicked

around?

(CONTINUED)

64.

BEN

It's not a question of being

spectators. The courts are

impartial, the law is what

matters.

STANLEY

(quite seriously)

That's what you all say. I have

to move man. Your neighbors!

Now, be careful. They will put

their marks on you!

BEN

Who?

STANLEY

You'll find out!

(handing the packet

to Ben)

In case you need me. Don't give

your name -- just say 'Lanie'

phoned -- right?

BEN

Now tomorrow at ten...

STANLEY

(interrupting)

Sharp! At our smart liberal

friend's office, yeh!

BEN

Good night.

BEN

I went to Soweto and saw Gordon's

body. They have lied to me, my

own people -- they killed him! I

saw the body.

(CONTINUED)

65.

SUSAN

Ben, you're not a doctor. His

death was announced officially.

They wouldn't say anything unless

they were certain of their facts.

BEN

(more animated)

Facts? There's a doctor who

participated at the autopsy.   A

Doctor Hassiem and he...

SUSAN

(interrupts)

You mean the Indian doctor who's

been arrested?

JOHAN

It was in the five o'clock news,

Papa.

BEN

That's him, he represented Emily

at the autopsy.

SUSAN

(suddenly desperate)

Ben, I'm sorry about Gordon's

death, but please for all our

sakes, forget about this whole

thing. Let's get back to a normal

life.

BEN

Can I have a drink?

JOHAN

A brandy?

BEN

You always know what I need.

SUSAN

(pleading)

Please, Ben, I'm frightened.

66.

PRIEST

Before I conclude, I have to say

we are tired of making this

journey every day, sometimes twice

in one day, burying our children,

and those, like our departed

brother, Ngubene who were merely

seeking the truth; and those who

have been denounced by traitors

amongst us; and those who have

been brutally killed for no

reason, yes I shall say it, by the

police. Let those who rule this

land of ours listen to the word

of God; let them listen to our

peaceful and just demands; let

them be humble and go down on

their knees and seek forgiveness,

then listen to God.

PRIEST

We will have a few words from Mr.

Pilani our father and leader.

(CONTINUED)

67.

SENIOR OFFICER

The funeral is over. I order

everyone to go home. This is not

a political rally. I repeat,

disperse.

COMMENTARY (V.O.)

Despite repeated warnings young

blacks attacked the police with

rocks and petrol bombs. Five

policemen were injured.

COMMENTARY (V.O.)

Several arrests were made. One

youth was killed and five wounded.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

This morning there was a serious

disturbance at the funeral of

Gordon Ngubene.

(CONTINUED)

68.

NEWSCASTER

The detainee who committed suicide

by hanging himself at John Vorster

Square. An overseas television

cameraman broke an arm during the

disturbance. It's been reported

that several people had been

killed by a car-bomb in Belfast

Northern Island...

BEN

How are you, Emily?

EMILY

Well, thank you, Mr. Ben, sir.

Eh, that's father Masonwane, our

priest, and that's Margaret from

next door.

(CONTINUED)

69.

STANLEY

(raising his hand in

greeting)

Mfundisi...

(priest)

... Sisi!

(sister)

EMILY

(to Ben)

Please sit down. Take this chair,

the other one is broken.

BEN

(apologetically)

I didn't mean to disturb you.

I've come to talk to you.

EMILY

(as she sits on the

broken chair)

Yes, it's good. What I want to

know is why did they kill him. He

didn't do them nothing. You know,

Mr. Ben, sir, I washed his whole

body for he was my husband. And

I know a man who killed himself,

he doesn't look like that.

MARGARET

Master, you must understand she's

still raw inside.

BEN

I'm sure.

EMILY

Robert, where are you manners

today? Don't you greet visitors?

EMILY

I'm sorry for his rudeness.

PRIEST

(to Ben)

You have to understand what's

happening to our children today,

they're like wasps when you burn

their nest.

(CONTINUED)

70.

MARGARET

That's right. Our children are

saying 'that's enough!' Things

have to change in this country.

They accuse us of being cowards.

BEN

Emily, I have really come to

assure you that I will do all I

can to help you find out what

really happened to Jonathan and

your husband -- we cannot bring

them back to life, but we can make

sure that this sort of thing won't

ever happen again.

PRIEST

You mean well, sir, but it's

better to forgive. If we keep the

pain alive then hate and

bitterness will remain with us.

BEN

The air must be cleared.   So we

can breathe again.

PRIEST

The air can only be cleared if we

forget about yesterday's thunder.

EMILY

Mr. Ben is right. It's not that I

want to go on with this thing

because it's a bad thing that

Jonathan died, that Gordon died

that's hard enough to bear, but

I can forgive it. But they

covered Gordon's name with dirt

and we must clean it up, else

he'll never have peace in his

grave.

STANLEY

(to Ben)

You must understand for us,

suicide is a coward's way out, how

do they say, it's a 'cop out.'

BEN

Gordon wasn't a coward and we'll

prove that. We have a very good

advocate for the inquest. His

name is De Villiers. I have

confidence in him and the truth

will come out.

(CONTINUED)

71.

EMILY

The truth must be known. They

killed my husband who wouldn't

hurt a fly and they killed

Jonathan who was only a child...

PRIEST

Those people who did it are sinful

people who don't know what they're

doing.

STANLEY

He! Mfundisi, what are you saying

now? You mean...

PRIEST

We must help them. That's the

only way. They need our help, not

hate, but love.

PRIEST

I pity them and I ask the Lord to

help me so I can learn to love

them.

STANLEY

If that's what you preach in your

church you will soon be starving.

EMILY

They covered his name with dirt.

PRIEST

Aren't you afraid sis Emily?

EMILY

No. In the end one grows tired of

being afraid.

STANLEY

Amen!

BEN

Emily, Stanley and I will do all

we can. As I said we have a good

advocate. Everyone involved with

Gordon's death will be questioned

and all that's known regarding

what happened in John Vorster

Square will come out.

(CONTINUED)

72.

MARGARET

How can anything come out of that

John Vorster Square? Who there

will say: 'Yes, we killed the

boy and Gordon?'

BEN

Lawyers ask questions.

MARGARET

And don't policemen lie?

EMILY

Thank you, Mr. Ben, sir for what

you're doing.

BEN

(standing)

I'm pleased I came.

STANLEY

(to Ben as he goes to

the door)

Wait, let me check the situation.

STANLEY

(to Robert)

Take it easy.

(then to Ben)

It's okey, dokey, but hurry.

BEN

(as they go to the

car)

Do I...

(CONTINUED)

73.

STANLEY

(interrupts)

Yes, on the floor man.

STANLEY

Okay. Kids, time to go home.   Be

careful.

BOY

(shouting back)

Sure 'bra' Stanley. Take it easy.

BEN

Are we still in Soweto?

STANLEY

Why don't you look for yourself?

BEN

(sitting up)

What the hell are you playing at?

STANLEY

(as he bursts into

loud laugh)

Precautions, Lanie.

BEN

(exposing)

Don't call me Lanie!   What does

that mean anyway?

STANLEY

(still laughing)

You will not understand, Lanie.

74.

BEN

I think I am without awareness.

I have always cared about people,

call it a social conscience. But

my visit to Gordon's house made me

experience another dimension of

human conditions.

SUSAN

The poverty, ja...

BEN

No, I expected that. But

listening to them talk made me

realize that I did not know the

blacks. Now I question my

attitudes, my concerns as Ben, and

complacence as a white person.

SUSAN

Ben, I know your anxiety about the

inquest. All will be cleared up,

in a legal way, and you'll be back

to your normal self. Now let's

turn off the lights.

DE VILLIERS

Dr. Jansen, you are a state

pathologist of many years

standing and I have no doubt a

well-qualified pathologist.

Could you now please tell us

what caused the death of the

deceased?

DR. JANSEN

I found that death had been caused

by the application of force to

the neck, consistent with

hanging.

(CONTINUED)

75.

DE VILLIERS

You are sure about the hanging?

This pressure on the neck, could

it also have been exerted in other

ways?

DR. JANSEN

It could, but it is not for me

to speculate.

DE VILLIERS

Of course not, Doctor. The list

of injuries found on the body was

horrifyingly long; bruises,

swellings, abrasions, broken rib,

lacerations, etc. How long before

death do you estimate he received

these injuries?

DR. JANSEN

I couldn't say exactly.

DE VILLIERS

Roughly.

DR. JANSEN

Some were fourteen to twenty days

old, others three to four days and

others even more recent.

DE VILLIERS

Even more recent. I see. I

understand you had a Dr. Hassiem

present at the autopsy.

DR. JANSEN

That's correct.

(CONTINUED)

76.

DE VILLIERS

There were two reports, ours and

his. Did they tally?

DR. JANSEN

Yes, it was.   In most respects.

DE VILLIERS

Isn't it normal practice to have

one report? Why did Dr. Hassiem

decide to draw up a separate

report? If he really co-signed

yours.

DR. JANSEN

That's for him to answer!

DE VILLIERS

I would very much like to, Dr.

Jansen, but he's been detained --

you know of course that he

represented the Ngubene family.

Thank you.

CUT TO:

DE VILLIERS

Dr. Herzog, did you examine the

deceased?

DR. HERZOG

Yes, one day Captain Stolz called

me in. The man had toothache.

DE VILLIERS

(aggressive)

That's all?

DR. HERZOG

(uncomfortable)

As far as I could tell -- yes.

(CONTINUED)

77.

DE VILIERS

You didn't examine him thoroughly?

DR. HERZOG

Why should I? The man was

perfectly healthy, just

complaining of toothache. I

extracted three decayed teeth, and

gave him aspirin for the pain...

that's all.

DE VILLIERS

Did the captain or anyone else

assist you during the examination?

DR. HERZOG

(hesitates)

I... I cannot remember.

DE VILLIERS

(more aggressive and

accusing)

Dr. Herzog, tell us. Have you

been intimidated by the Security

Police or did you deliberately

cooperate with them in playing

their disgusting little game of

hide-and-seek?

LOUW

(jumping up from his

seat)

I protest, Your Worship.

MAGISTRATE

Advocate De Villiers, will you

refrain from insinuations?

DE VILLIERS

Thank you, Doctor Herzog... I'm

sure Gordon Ngubene was extremely

grateful!

MAGISTRATE

Advocate Louw?

(CONTINUED)

78.

LOUW

Thank you, Your Worship. I'd

like to call Captain Stolz.

LOUW

You're a police officer stationed

at John Vorster Square?

STOLZ

That's right, Your Worship.

LOUW

You arrested Gordon Ngubene.

Could you describe what happened?

STOLZ

Acting on information we had

received, I went to the house of

the deceased, accompanied by

Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant

Botha, and three native members

of the security force. This was

about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene

that he was under arrest under

Article 6 of the Terrorism Act.

He then became violent and resisted

arrest. A certain force had to be

applied to restrain him.

STOLZ

We found several incriminating

documents. These pointed to his

involvement with the A.N.C. and

activities endangering the

security of the state.

79.

LOUW

Was the deceased ever assaulted to

your knowledge?

STOLZ

Never. He was always treated with

courtesy and correctness. But,

one time we had cause to use force

against him. It was the day before

his death. The deceased suddenly

showed signs of aggression. He

tried to jump through the open

window of my office. He was

acting like a mad man. It took

six of my men to restrain him,

and he had to be manacled hand

and foot, for his own safety.

But once he calmed down, he was

ready to make a statement about

his activities. The next morning

we found him dead in his cell.

MAGISTRATE

Is the statement in evidence?

LOUW

No, Your Worship. It can't be

disclosed in court without

damaging our investigation, but

I would like to offer into

evidence a suicide note written

by the deceased.

LOUW

'Dear Captain. I prefer to die

rather than betray any more of

my friends. Amandla! Gordon

Ngubene.'

LOUW

Thank you, Your Worship.

MAGISTRATE

Advocate De Villiers?

(CONTINUED)

80.

DE VILLIERS

Thank you, Your Worship. Captain

Stolz, you said you treated the

deceased always with courtesy and

correctness, then how do you

account for the injuries found on

the body?

STOLZ

Sometimes detainees deliberately

injure themselves for propaganda

purposes.

DE VILLIERS

You say he tried to jump out of

the open window... Are there no

bars to prevent such an act?

STOLZ

They had been removed for repair.

DE VILLIERS

And why did he wish to jump out?

Because you were torturing him?

STOLZ

He wasn't tortured.

DE VILLIERS

Perhaps it was the toothache then.

DE VILLIERS

You said you seized incriminating

documents at the deceased's home;

can you produce them to see how

subversive he was?

LOUW

(to Magistrate)

Those documents cannot be

introduced as evidence, Your

Worship, in view of the fact that

state security is involved.

(CONTINUED)

DE VILLIERS

I put it to you, Captain -- that

the only subversive activities

the deceased had been involved in

were his efforts to establish

what happened to his son,

Jonathan, allegedly shot during

a riot, although several witnesses

are prepared to testify that he

died in detention one month later.

LOUW

(jumping up)

I protest...

DE VILLIERS

This would support my case that an

innocent man has died in your hands

under highly questionable

circumstances.

LOUW

If it please Your Worship... this

unwarranted slur on the integrity

of the special branch is

unacceptable... and based, I may

say, on allegations which are in

any case irrelevant to the present

inquest.

MAGISTRATE

I agree.

DE VILLIERS

(turning on Louw)

If the police are really interested

in retaining an unsullied

reputation, they should not object

to the real facts being presented.

Thank you, Captain.

LOUW

The real facts are being presented

-- as the following affadivits

prove. They are all by detainees

-- who testify that they had all

seen the deceased intermittently

from the time of his detention --

to the time of his death -- and on

all occasions he was in good

health.

(CONTINUED)

82.

DE VILLIERS

I trust the signatories of these

... documents... are available to

corroborate their evidence in

person.

DE VILLIERS

Mr. Archibald, when did you first

meet Gordon Ngubene?

ARCHIBALD

(looking at black

crowd, then to De

Villiers)

I never saw Gordon Ngubene.

DE VILLIERS

Are you saying that you didn't

sign this statement?

ARCHIBALD

... I never met Mr. Ngubene...

they forced me to sign. Captain

Stolz, he hit me many times with

a rubber hose... he said he would

kill me 'less I signed... this...

this is what he did to me.

DE VILLIERS

Thank you, Mr. Archibald.

(CONTINUED)

83.

MAGISTRATE

Advocate Louw?

LOUW

(uncomfortable)

No thank you, Your Worship.

DE VILLIERS

(to town, wearily)

May we put up the second

signatory?

LOUW

Your Worship -- the other three

signatories cannot appear for

reasons of state security.

DE VILLIERS

Your Worship, I'd like to recall

Captain Stolz.

DE VILLIERS

Captain, you're still under oath

-- you took Archibald's statement.

Was it voluntary? I'm sure you'll

say it was, then how did he come

by the injuries on his back?

STOLZ

He fell down the stairs a few

days ago.

(CONTINUED)

84.

DE VILLIERS

Fell down the stairs. You should

do something about those stairs,

Captain, so many people fall on

them. Thank you.

STOLZ

(to the Magistrate)

Your Worship, may I be excused? I

have to escort detainee Archibal

back to John Vorster Square.

MAGISTRATE

You may, Captain, and thank you.

(to the crowd)

I think this's a good moment to

adjourn -- we'll reconvene at two

thirty.

CUT TO:

BEN

(buoyant)

De Villiers is making mincemeat

of them.

LEWINSON

He's very good. His cross-

examination has got them rattled.

BEN

It's obvious to anybody! The

evidence is clear!

(pause)

Did you see Archibal's back? He

didn't have to tell the truth.

(CONTINUED)

85.

LEWINSON

That's what Stolz is saying to

him right now in his torture room.

CUT TO:

EMILY

Captain Stolz lied. My husband

never fight the police when he

was arrested. They were rough

with him, pushing him and

threatening.

DE VILLIERS

When your husband's clothes were

given to you, in what condition

were they?

EMILY

There was blood on them and in

the back pocket I found three

broken teeth.

DE VILLIERS

Now Mrs. Ngubene, you have seen

the note that's said to have been

written by your husband. Do you

recognize the writing?

EMILY

(firmly)

That's not how my husband writes.

(strongly)

He never wrote that letter, they

lie.

DE VILLIERS

Thank you, Mrs. Ngubene.

MAGISTRATE

Advocte Louw?

EMILY

(facing the

Magistrate and in

firm voice)

They killed my husband and son.

(CONTINUED)

86.

MAGISTRATE

(to a policeman next

to Viljoen)

Will you take the woman out?

DE VILLIERS

I'd like to call my last witness.

Grace Nkosi.

DE VILLIERS

Were you ever detained?

GRACE

Yes sir, at John Vorster Square.

DE VILLIERS

For how long?

GRACE

Six months.

DE VILLIERS

Can you tell us what happened to

you during that time?

GRACE

I was interrogated by many special

policemen, but mainly Captain Stolz

and the one they call Venter. As

they were searching somebody I

know, they wanted me to tell them

where that person was hidden. As

I refuse to cooperate they beat me

with a sjambok. After some time

I fell and they kicked me in the

face and stomach.

(CONTINUED)

87.

GRACE

I spot blood and they try to make

me lick it. Then Captain Stolz

threw a wet towel and started

twisting it around my neck...

(she illustrates)

... until I lost consciousness.

They did this several time and

the last one Captain Stolz said

'come on meid, speak up, or do

you want to die like Gordon

Ngubene?' A few days later I was

released.

DE VILLIERS

Thank you, Miss Grace. That's

all, Your Worship.

LOUW

(rising and looking

at Grace for some

seconds)

You made that up. Say you made it

up.

GRACE

It's the truth. I have nothing

more to say.

MAGISTRATE

We shall adjourn until tomorrow

morning. I'll hear the arguments

and give the verdict.

DISSOLVE TO:

MAGISTRATE

I wish to thank both advocates for

conducting this case without

rancour and in the best traditions

of the South African legal

profession.

(CONTINUED)

88.

MAGISTRATE

I have listened to all the

evidence and the arguments. To

begin with I have to say that

there was no conclusive evidence

offered to prove beyond doubt that

members of the Security Police had

been guilty of assault or any

irregular conduct on the deceased.

There were indications that

Ngubene was aggressive and on more

than one occasion had to be

restrained with force. There was

sufficient evidence to conclude

that death had been caused by a

trauma following pressure applied

to the neck, consistent with

hanging. Consequently, I find

that Gordon Ngubene committed

suicide by hanging himself and

that on available evidence his

death cannot be attributed to any

act or omission or amounting to

a criminal offense on the part of

any person.

REPORTERS

Mister Du Toit, what do you think

of the verdict? Do you believe

the police?

REPORTER

Hang on, Melanie, I'm coming with

you.

MELANIE

(shouts back)

Fuck off.

BEN

My car is over there.

MELANIE

(opening the car)

Never mind your car. Let's get

away from these vultures.

(CONTINUED)

90.

MELANIE

By the way, I'm Melanie Bruwer.

BEN

Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail.

I read your article about

Jonathan.

MELANIE

Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit.      I

know about you too.

BEN

(uncomfortable)

You do?

MELANIE

We have a mutual friend.    One

Stanley.

BEN

I remember. The mortuary in

Soweto...

(pause)

... The ambiguous Stanley.

MELANIE

Stanley? No. Just careful. A

big black rough uncut diamond.

Don't be fooled by his happy-go-

lucky attitude. There's much more

to him.

BEN

He couldn't have given you a

glowing report of me.

(suddenly aggressive)

I'm sorry, but where are we going?

MELANIE

I thought a cooling drink at my

house.

BEN

(on the defensive)

Mrs. Bruwer, I'm not...

(CONTINUED)

91.

MELANIE

(interrupts)

I promise you. I'm not after an

interview or anything like that.

BEN

I really must go home.

MELANIE

Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you'll

meet my darling father.

MELANIE

(pointing from the

car)

There he is by the eucalyptus

tree, on the left. That's old

Bruwer.

BEN

How long have you lived here?

MELANIE

Oh, about twenty-one years.   I

love this house.

BRUWER

(without looking up)

Is that you, Melanie?

MELANIE

Of course, Dad. I want you to

meet a friend.

BRUWER

Does anyone have a friend

nowadays?

(CONTINUED)

92.

MELANIE

Mr. Du toit, Dad.

BRUWER

Do you like bees?

BEN

(smiling)

I have nothing against them.

MELANIE

(to Ben)

Be careful, I can see philosophy

coming.

BRUWER

You shut up.

(to Ben)

Let me tell you about bees, and

for that matter ants: a bee has

a completely altruistic sense of

purpose -- based on the common

good. A course from which he

cannot be deflected. Greed,

ambition, they mean nothing to

him. He lives solely to serve

his fellow bee.

MELANIE

What about individuality, Dad?

BRUWER

There's the rub, my girl. There's

the rub. One of these days I'll

ask the bees. I'm sure they have

the answer. Now, you two run

along!

MELANIE

A drink, Dad?

BRUWER

I've been peeing too much this

morning.

(CONTINUED)

93.

CONTINUED:

MELANIE

(as they walk toward

the house)

That's my Daddy.

Melanie and Ben enter the house.

INT. MELANIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers,

of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings

-- records, African sculptures.

On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a

record player to two voluminous speakers.

A settee, a chess set. The furniture is old and well-

used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two

big cats sleeping on it. It's civilized pandemonium.

MELANIE

(gesturing to the

room)

Now you see in what environment I

Ben looks at the shelves and smiles.

MELANIE

Please sit down, on that chair.

(pointing to club

chair)

That's Dad's. Drink?

BEN

Please.   A...

MELANIE

(interrupts, mischievous)

A brandy?

BEN

(looking at her

surprised, then

smiling)

No thanks, a beer will be fine.

Melanie goes into the kitchen leaving Ben. He cannot

forget what he heard and what he saw in the court!

She returns barefooted, with two beer mugs, and hands one

to Ben.

(CONTINUED)

94.

MELANIE

The mugs are the few things that

Dad brought from Germany. He

studied philosophy in Tubingen

and Berlin before the last war.

BEN

I thought they were German?

MELANIE

Mr. Du Toit, tell...

BEN

(interrupts)

Please, call me Ben.

MELANIE

All right, Ben, tell me, why are

you so depressed? You really

expect a different verdict?

BEN

(disgruntled)

Why do you ask? Can you understand

it?

MELANIE

Of course I understand it. What

could they have. I'm not cynical.

I'm only trying to be realistic.

BEN

Tell me, Miss Bruwer...

MELANIE

Ben and Melanie, that's fair.

BEN

Tell me, do you believe in the

notion of justice?

MELANIE

(lighting a cigarette)

I'll never stop believing. But in

this country I've learned it's

pointless to look for it in

certain situations.

BEN

What use is a system if justice

does not apply to all situations?

(CONTINUED)

95.

MELANIE

Exactly. And you cannot fight

for justice unless you know

injustice very well. You've got

to know your enemy first.

BEN

That's a tall order: 'know

injustice... know the enemy.'

it seems I have a long haul

ahead of me.

MELANIE

Not at all, Ben. You have already

taken the first steps.

(pause)

Welcome to South Africa!

SUSAN

Did you enjoy the 'bobotie?' When

I heard the verdict on the news I

knew you'd be upset.

(softer)

I wanted to make you something

special.

BEN

(thoughtful)

Thank you, darling.

SUSAN

I'm glad it's all over. You take

things to heart too much.

BEN

(trying to keep control

of himself)

They killed Gordon -- first they

kill Jonathan, and then him. How

can they get away with it?

(CONTINUED)

96.

SUSAN

(soothingly)

Now come on, Ben. Gordon's death

upset me, too. But the Magistrate

had all the facts. He must know

what he's doing, he's had years of

experience. The case has run its

course, and nobody can do anything

more about it! It's all over and

done with.

BEN

(looking at her)

I'm not so sure about that, Susan!

SUSAN

I'm damned well sure! It's over,

Ben! You better get that into

your head.

SUSAN

A teacher, always a bloody teacher.

You never moved yourself for us.

But for the blacks, oh yes. Whose

side are you on, Ben? And I'm sick

and tired of those natives coming

here. Why don't you bloody well

go and live in Soweto?

SUSAN

(following and shouting)

Now where are you going?

BEN

(without looking)

Soweto!

(CONTINUED)

97.

FADE OUT.

BEN

More meneer Van de Merwe.

(Morning Mister Van de Merwe.)

PROPRIETOR

(in offhand manner)

More meneer du Toit.

BEN

Our boys gave the Eastern province

a thrashing.

PROPRIETOR

Yes.

BEN

Is anything wrong?

PROPRIETOR

No.

BEN

(walking up to counter)

And a packet of tobacco and pipe

cleaners.

BEN

See you tomorrow.

SUZETTE

(jumping up and showing

the cover of Ossewa)

Now, Papa, this is going too

far! How could you?

BEN

(surprised)

How's that, Suzette?

"EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who

died in detention, comforted by a

friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."

(CONTINUED)

99.

SUZETTE

You didn't stop to think of the family.

Poor mother, how can she face anyone?

And tomorrow is Sunday!

BEN

Now listen...

JOHAN

What's everybody yelling about?

SUZETTE

You listen, Papa, just tell me, why?

BEN

Do you really think I specially

arranged for the photographers to

take that picture? And what's

more it's distorted.

SUZETTE

What's distorted about it? Your

face is practically touching that

meid's face, like you were about

to kiss her.

BEN

(disgruntled)

Suzette, pull yourself together!

SUZETTE

Today the whole country has seen that

photograph. We, your children, are

going to suffer. At this very moment

Chris is negotiating with the Provincial

Council. Would you like to see them

cancel it? You have no feeling, Papa!

BEN

(shocked)

Suzette!

JOHAN

(conciliating)

What's Papa done, anyway? If

something happened to him,

wouldn't you be upset?

(CONTINUED)

100.

SUSAN

(standing up)

Not enough, Johan, to throw myself

into the garden boy's arms.

BEN

That goes without saying.

JOHAN

(trying to joke)

There must be easier ways of

getting your name in the paper.

BEN

(into phone)

Who?... I don't know you and have

nothing to say to you... No thank

you for your advice!

BEN

It's you, Viviers... I appreciate

it... of course... Not yet... Any

thank you. Tot siens.

BEN

Morning, Mr. Cloete...   I'd like

to say...

(impatiently)

... Mr. Cloete, may I ask what on

earth has the picture to do with

politics?... I'm sorry Mr. Cloete,

I have to go.

101.

BESTER

Everything was examined in depth

in court.

BEN

Did you read the papers, Dominee?

Were you happy with what came to

light? And is it the Magistrate's

work to pretend that the facts

which came to light didn't exist?

BESTER

Was it really facts, Ben?

BESTER

Ja?   What is it Tom?

TOM (HERDBOY)

Does the Baas want me to bring the

bull now?

BESTER

Later, Tom.

TOM (HERDBOY)

Dankie, Baas.

BESTER

I bought a bull last week.

BEN

I know, Gordon. What they said about

him, that he was plotting against

the government -- is a downright

lie. He was only doing what I

would have done as a father;

searching for his son.

BESTER

No one but God can see what's in

our hearts.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

102.

BESTER (CONT'D)

Isn't it presumptuous to pretend

we can speak for someone else?

BEN

Have you no faith in your fellow

men, Dominee? Don't you love your

neighbor?

BESTER

(confronting Ben)

Wait a minute, instead of

criticizing blindly, don't you

think we have reason to be proud

of the judiciary we have?  suppose

this had been Russia; what do you

think would have happened then?

BEN

What's the use of reaching a

court when a handful of people

have all the power to decide what

is going to be said in that court

and by whom? The one man they

allowed to speak for himself, that

young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn't

he immediately deny everything

they forced him to say in his

statement? And the girl who

spoke of her own torture?

CUSTOMER PAGE 99 MISSING

BEN

That did not refer to our

situation in this South Africa.

Do you know what I believe in,

Dominee, that once in one's life,

just once, one should have enough

faith in something to risk

everything for it.

BESTER

One can gain the world and still

lose one's soul. Tea must be

ready.

103.

CLOETE

I hope you don't mind us talking

here.

BEN

I don't mind, Mr. Cloete.

CLOETE

I'll come to the point. You can't

imagine how shocked I was by that

scandalous photograph in the

Ossewa.

BEN

The woman lost her husband, she

was shattered with grief.

CLOETE

A Kaffir woman, Du Toit.

BEN

(angrily)

I can't see that it makes any

difference.

CLOETE

Have you gone color blind then?

And what about the apartheid laws?

Our first responsibility as

teachers is the reputation of the

school, the pupils entrusted to

us. We have to be an example to

them in and out of this school

yard.

(CONTINUED)

104.

CLOETE

I thought I had warned you about

involving yourself with Kaffirs.

Obviously you didn't heed my

advice.  That's all I have to say

for now.

VIVIERS

'Morning, Oom Ben.

BEN

greeting)

Viviers.

VIVIERS

Private coffee with Cloete?

BEN

Good afternoon, Professor.

BRUWER

Melanie isn't home. You are...

BEN

Ben Du Toit. You have a nice

vegetable garden.

BRUWER

You mean the area or the produce?

BEN

Both.   What plants are these?

(CONTINUED)

105.

BRUWER

What's the world coming to? It's

herbs, can't you see? Thyme

there, oregano over there, feunel

next to the tomatoes, sage here

and rosemary somewhere. Poor

plants, they re not in their ideal

soil or climate. Next time, I'll

bring some soil from the mountain

of Zeus. Perhaps the old man's

holiness will do the trick.

BRUWER

Come, you are just the person to

sample my greengage wine. I don't

suppose you've ever tasted it?

I'm sure I'm the only person in

the country making greengage wine.

BRUWER

(as he pours)

The first bottle this year, and

you don't have to tell me if you

like it or not. Tell me, did you

ever study philosophy?

BEN

Not really.   I've read a few

books.

BRUWER

(taking a sip)

Not bad, in fact quite good. Now

where was I... Oh, I was going to

say after decades of philosophy, I

find myself being forced back to

the earth. Do you know, Ben, we're

all living in the spell of

abstractions. Hitler, apartheid,

the great American dream, the lot?

BEN

What about Jesus?

BRUWER

Misunderstood.

BRUWER (CONT'D)

wine)

You don't have to finish it.

BEN

It's quite nice.

BRUWER

Melanie has told me a little about

you. It's not an easy road you

have chosen.

BEN

I feel I have no choice.

BRUWER

Of course you have a choice.

Damn it. One always has a choice.

Only thank God you made the choice

you did. But all I want to say

is, keep your eyes open, young

man.

BEN

That's encouraging.

BRUWER

We are both Boers, Ben. We know

how hard our people worked to get

a toehold on this land; it was a

good life. Now look at the mess.

It's all systems and no God!

Sooner or later people start

believing in their way of life as

an absolute: unmutable,

fundamental, a precondition. Saw

it, with my own eyes in Germany,

a nation running after an idea.

Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left

there thirty years ago because I

couldn't take it any longer. And

now I see it happening in my own

country, step by step.

Terrifyingly predictable. This

sickness of the great abstraction.

(CONTINUED)

107.

BEN

What you say is very interesting

and important.

BRUWER

Take for example the way the

government is handling the

electorate; like a bloody donkey.

Carrot in front and kick at the

backside. The carrot is

apartheid, Dogma. The kick is

quite simply, fear. Black peril,

red peril, whatever name you want

to give it.

(pause)

Fear can be a wonderful ally, Ben.

I talk too much, I always do with

younger people, they don't fall

asleep to me.

BEN

(laughs)

We Afrikaners have to stop to turn

a blind eye and look around us and

at ourselves.

BRUWER

You are right. We still have

time. History should teach us

about those who regarded

themselves as the chosen people.

BEN

(standing up

comforted)

Professor Bruwer, may I say I have

needed to hear somebody say some

of the things you said. I still

have hope for our country.

BRUWER

If you lose that you have lost

everything. I'll get back to the

earth.

BEN

(shaking hands)

Thank you.

(CONTINUED)

108.

BRUWER

I'll tell that hot-head daughter

of mine that you came to see her.

BEN

There is absolutely no doubt that

they were killed in custody.

Those responsible must be

punished, whoever they are, or

whatever their rank.

LEWINSON

The problem is laying our hands on

them.

BEN

Tell me, Dan, we lost at the

inquest, what next?

LEWINSON

The family can file a civil claim.

BEN

What does that entail?

LEWINSON

To put it briefly, it means we

have to have witnesses, affidavits

and any information relating to

the arrest and death of Gordon.

We also need similar information

on Jonathan. You see Ben, for

example, Stolz figures in both

cases. That's one link at least.

BEN

I know what I have to do.

MELANIE

I didn't think you would want to

have anything to do with me after

that crap in the Ossewa.

BEN

Why?   You didn't write it.

MELANIE

I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred

with the same brush.

BEN

No.

MELANIE

So what happened? I can imagine.

The family, the dominee,

colleagues, neighbors...

BEN

A distorted photograph and a few

poisoned words and meneer Du Toit

is a leper. That's why I called

on you the other day, I needed to

talk to somebody rational.

MELANIE

Thanks for the compliment. But

remember, you're an Afrikaner,

you're one of them. In their eyes

they regard you as the worst kind

of traitor.

BEN

You are an Afrikaner too, and your

articles, in a liberal English

paper?

MELANIE

My mother was a foreigner, I'm not

pure, wragte Afrikaner. They

don't expect the same loyalty from

me that they demand from you.

BEN

What kind of loyalty? Blind

loyalty. Until the deaths of

Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all

the loyalty I could give, laager

loyalty. You know, Melanie, we

Afrikaners have always lived in

our laager, we have not seen

what's beyond the mountains.

(CONTINUED)

110.

MELANIE

Has it ever occurred to you that

the Volk may be scared to leave the

laager? That's the downfall of

this country. So, where do you go

from here?

BEN

We carry on.   There has to be

justice.

MELANIE

Justice.

BEN

We lost at the inquest, so we

pursue them in a civil action.    I

Lewinson.

BEN

And how are you, Ma?

MOTHER-IN-LAW (MOTHER)

Well, Ben, still have trouble with

my feet.

BEN

Why doesn't everyone sit down?

SUSAN

I'll prepare some tea.     I baked a

cake.

(CONTINUED)

114.

FATHER-IN-LAW

I'm getting tired of the trek to

Cape Town and then back to

Pretoria. If I had my way,

Parliament and government would

be in the same city. There's

nothing wrong with Pretoria.

BEN

I thought you'd prefer Cape Town;

the sea and Table Mountain.

FATHER-IN-LAW

That's for   holidays. Anyway, Ben,

one of the   reasons for this visit

was that I   wanted to have a

discussion   with you.

BEN

What about?

FATHER-IN-LAW

It's that photograph in the

papers. Ben, a thing like that

could be an embarrassment for

someone who is a member of

Parliament. It's a grievous day

when one's family's behavior

comes between him and his duty

to the fatherland.

BEN

Are you blaming me for trying to

help those people?

FATHER-IN-LAW

I've been doing that all my life,

be they black or white. But no

member of our family has been seen

with a Kaffir woman before, Ben.

BEN

I am glad you mentioned it, Father.

Because I'd like to discuss the

whole thing with you. First,

there's the matter of Gordon

Ngubene himself.

FATHER-IN-LAW

What about him? I thought the

case was closed.

(CONTINUED)

115.

CONTINUED:

BEN

The inquest didn't clear up half

of what happened.

FATHER-IN-LAW

Oh, really?

BEN

We have no irrefutable evidence

yet, but we have enough to

indicate that something serious is

being covered up.

FATHER-IN-LAW

You're jumping to conclusions,

Ben.

BEN

I know what I'm talking about.

The black waiter places the drinks on the table.

FATHER-IN-LAW

All right, Ben, I'm listening.

Perhaps I can use my influence.

But you'll have to convince me

BEN

If they have really nothing to

hide, why is the special branch

going out of its way to intimidate

me.

FATHER-IN-LAW

(practically choking)

What's this about special branch?

BEN

They raided the house; they are

tapping my phone, and I have been

threatened by one of the officers.

FATHER-IN-LAW

I'm sorry, Ben, I'd rather not

have anything to do with this sort

of thing.

BEN

Why?

FATHER-IN-LAW

If the special branch are involved

they must have good reasons.

(CONTINUED)

116.

BEN

It's exactly what I said, Father,

when Jonathan first got into

trouble. Of course, they have

good reasons: hushing up how

Gordon died and how his son died!

FATHER-IN-LAW

(angry)

Ben, how could you side with the

enemies of your people?

BEN

You mean you're prepared to sit

back and allow an injustice to be

done.

FATHER-IN-LAW

(his face grows

purple)

It's you, Ben, who talk about

injustice? A man who teaches

history at school? Did you forget

what our people have suffered

under the English oppressors?

Now that we have at along last

come to power in our own land.

BEN

Now we're free to do to others

what they used to do to us. What

will you do if you were a black

man in this country today, Father?

FATHER-IN-LAW

Don't you realize what the

government is doing for the blacks?

It's a slow process, Ben. One of

these days the whole bloody lot of

them will be free and independent

in their own parts of the land, the

bantoustans -- what can be more

just than that? But they're not

ready yet.

FATHER-IN-LAW

We have nothing to be ashamed of

before the eyes of the world, my

boy.

(CONTINUED)

117.

BEN

(standing, his golf

bag in his hand)

We don't? I'm not sure we're

going to survive.

FATHER-IN-LAW

Don't underestimate us, Ben.    Our

power of survival. We are

Afrikaners!

STANLEY

African time.

BEN

I'm sorry.

STANLEY

Doesn't matter, Lanie -- as long

we are on time for the revolution.

BEN

The special branch searched my

house four days ago.

STANLEY

The S.B. searches your house?

(chuckles)

Did they take anything?

BEN

A few journals, letters -- nothing

much. Just wanted to scare me,

that's all.

STANLEY

Don't be so sure. They may think

you're onto something big.

BEN

They're not that stupid.

(CONTINUED)

118.

STANLEY

'Lanie' -- don't you believe it --

nothing's as stupid as the old S.B.

If they decide it's a bomb they're

looking for, you can shove a turd

in their face and they'll swear

to God it's a bomb.

STANLEY

And did they?

BEN

What?

STANLEY

Scare you?

BEN

No.   They tried too hard.

STANLEY

Hallelujah!

(offers his huge

hand)

Shake, man. Join the club.

CUT TO:

"Kaffir lover"

"Kaffer boetie"

"Red Communist"

CUT TO:

119.

STANLEY

Did you hear that, Lanie?     More

kids dying?

BEN

What's happening?   What's the

singing?

STANLEY

A wake for a child; eight months

old. She was sleeping and they

threw tear gas into it.

CUT TO:

GORDON (V.O.)

(shakily)

'My dear wife, you must not worry

about me. I miss you and the

children. You must look after

them in the fear of the Lord. I'm

hungry, and I don't know what they

want from me. But I think I'll

be home some day. I think

about...'

(CONTINUED)

120.

STANLEY

On your knees, everyone, prayers

time.

STANLEY

Hey man, you should have been a

mfundisi holiness oozer...

JULIUS

(removing this hat)

Okay, Stanley. It's stupid, but

one is forced to do these things.

JULIUS

I'm Julius Nqakula... I'm banned

and also under house arrest.

That's why I have this ridiculous

garb on.

BEN

I understand.

STANLEY

He's one of the most solid

lawyers we have; they've

immobilized him, that's the right

word isn't it?

BEN

Stanley has told me about you. I

appreciate the risk you are taking

by coming here to meet me. I was

reading the notes Gordon smuggled

out of John Vorster Square...

JULIUS

May I have a glance at them?

(CONTINUED)

121.

GORDON (V.O.)

(speaking with great

difficulty)

'My dear wife. I am still in these

conditions... worse... and too

much pain. They don't want to

believe me. You must try to help

me. They won't stop. You must

care for the children. I don't

know anymore if I will come home

alive. They're very --

(a word mumbled)

-- but God will provide. I love

you and I miss you very much. Try

to help me because...'

JULIUS

(to Emily)

When did you get the letters?

EMILY

(uncomfortable)

The first one two days after they

took him away. And the other one

came later.

BEN

But, Emily, why didn't you tell me

long ago?

EMILY

I had given my word to the man

-- who brought them to me --

BEN

Emily, I have to meet the man.

EMILY

He said he didn't want anybody to

know who he is. I cannot make

trouble for him in his work.

BEN

He has to be persuaded.   He is very

important to us.

EMILY

(to Julius)

You as a lawyer will understand.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

122.

EMILY (CONT'D)

We intend starting a civil suit

against the police, to do that it

is necessary to have as many

affidavits as we can from people

who have any information about

Gordon since he was arrested.

And this man is vital and so is

the Indian doctor.

JULIUS

You mean Dr. Hassiem. How are you

going to do that? You know of

course that he is detained.

BEN

I know, with luck they may release

him.

JULIUS

With luck.

BEN

But, Emily, this man is important,

please try to tell him we will

protect his identity. No one will

know. Nothing will be done without

his approval. I only want to talk

to him.

JULIUS

Why don't you leave it to Stanley

and I? What do you say, Stanley?

STANLEY

Sure.

BEN

May I call you Julius, I'm not

very good with some African names.

STANLEY

(laughs)

Nqakula, that's a hell of a name.

JULIUS

Please call me Julius.

BEN

This case must be reopened and we

must win. We have to dig up

everything. We need your

cooperation, Julius.

(CONTINUED)

123.

JULIUS

Where do I start? Don't forget

my restrictions.

STANLEY

They did not ban you so you could

sit on your backside and have a

Soweto holiday.

BEN

You could help with the affidavits.

Lewinson the lawyer has stressed

their importance.

JULIUS

We know each other. He's a good

lawyer for this kind of case. Of

course I'll do what I can. My

commitment forces me.

BEN

I'm glad.

JULIUS

How   are you planning to safeguard

the   documents? Stanley told me

you   have already had a said by

the   S.B.

BEN

I wouldn't worry.    I have a secure

place.

STANLEY

Let's hope so.

EMILY

I'll make some tea.

STANLEY

Not for me, Sis -- too strong for

me. No whisky?

EMILY

In my house? You know better

than that, Stanley.

STANLEY

Tea then...

(turning to Julius)

... and God forgive me --

CUT TO:

124.

SUSAN

Ben, it's Johan. You'd better

come.

SUSAN

He won't tell me why it happened

BEN

Johan.   Was it because of me?

SUSAN

You see! It's gone too far, Ben.

You've got to stop it...

JOHAN

(shouting at his

mother)

I don't care! It doesn't hurt me!

JOHAN

It was my friends, Dad. They're

so stupid... They won't listen.

They don't even want to know what

you're trying to do.

BEN

Are you sure you know?

(CONTINUED)

125.

JOHAN

Yes.   I know.

BEN

Does it worry you?

JOHAN

Don't stop, Dad. You mustn't

give up now!

RINGING, RINGING, on a desk full of scattered

files and papers. By the phone a photograph of a six-

year-old Indian girl.

Sound of the PHONE, a young nurse's frightened face as

she remembers peering in at a young boy, struggling

and moaning... Policemen closing the door...

her hand signing the affidavit and handing

it to a man's hand.

me to burn them.

them into the drawer of the stool box.

SUSAN

(hysterical)

Call the police, Ben, call the police!

JOHAN (O.S.)

Papa!    Papa!

BEN

(calling)

It's okay, son... we're all right.

Everything's okay!

JOHAN (O.S.)

What's happened?

BEN

(shouting)

It's okay, stay there, please!!

SUSAN

(in disbelief)

My God. They were trying to kill us.

BEN

They were trying to scare us, that's

all.

(CONTINUED)

127.

SUSAN

(screaming)

Oh, is that all... What the hell

more do you want to happen...

we're ordinary people for God's

sake -- and you've pitched us into

this -- this nightmare. I can't

take any more, Ben... I can't take

any more!!

SUSAN

(in a quiet pleading

voice)

Please, Ben, stop. Just stop...

please.

VILJOEN

Now you must be exaggerating,

Mr. Du Toit.

BEN

My house has been searched. My

phone is tapped. My mail is

opened. And last night three

shots were fired through my window

-- close to killing my wife.

VILJOEN

Mr. Du Toit, if shots were fired

into your premises, we will

investigate.

BEN

All I want to know, Colonel, is

why don't you leave me in peace?

(CONTINUED)

128.

VILJOEN

Now wait, wait a minute, Mr. Du

Toit, you're not trying to blame

me?

BEN

Tell me, Colonel, why is it so

important to you people to stop

my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene?

VILJOEN

Is that what you are doing?

(he pauses)

Well, now. If you possess any

information that may be of use to

us, I trust you won't hesitate to

discuss it with me.

VILJOEN

Because if there are facts you are

deliberately hiding from us, Mr.

Du Toit -- If you give us reason

to believe that you may be

involved in activities that may be

dangerous to both yourself and us

-- then I can foresee some

problems.

BEN

Is that a threat, Colonel?

VILJOEN

(smiling and sitting

back)

Let's call it a warning. A

friendly warning. For God's sake,

open your eyes, Mr. Du Toit!

Don't you see you're being used!

BEN

(sarcastically)

By the Communists, I suppose.

BEN

Goodbye, Colonel.

(at the door,

turning back)

I'm sure.

129.

COLORED WOMAN

Mr. Du Toit?

COLORED WOMAN

Please, come in.

STANLEY

(rising and shaking

hands with Ben)

How's it? No trouble finding this

place? You met Sadie. She's one

of us.

(CONTINUED)

130.

STANLEY

And this is Johnson Seroke.    The

man of the letters.

BEN

(nodding in greeting)

Johnson.

SADIE (COLORED WOMAN)

Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit. A

beer, tea or orange squash?

BEN

A beer would be nice.

STANLEY

You know they call this place

Vrededorp, but we baptize it

Malay Camp. Your first time in

Malay Camp, Lanie?

BEN

I've driven through here many

times.

STANLEY

The main road, eh?

BEN

(smiling)

Ja.

SADIE

You'll excuse me. Stanley, you

know what to do with the key.

STANLEY

Sure, Sadie. And thank you. Can

I help myself to another beer?

SADIE

You know it is. Goodbye, Mr. Du

Toit, and you, be careful.

(CONTINUED)

131.

SEROKE

(trying to smile)

Okay, Sadie.

STANLEY

That woman can die for you. We

mustn't be long, Johnson has to

be back on duty.

BEN

Alright, let's get on with it.

Stanley tells me, you work at

John Vorster Square.

SEROKE

I had no choice, they transferred

me there.

BEN

Yet you smuggled out letters to

Emily?

SEROKE

(pulling the fingers

of his left hand one

by one cracking the

joints over and over)

What do you do if a man asks you,

and he's in trouble?

STANLEY

If they find out he'd be in very

big trouble.

BEN

I know that. Tell me, what do you

know about Gordon?

SEROKE

Very little.

BEN

You did talk to him from time to

time?

SEROKE

He gave me the letters.

BEN

When was the last time you saw

him?

(CONTINUED)

132.

SEROKE

Just before he died.

BEN

Did you attend any of the

interrogations?

SEROKE

No. I'm not a member of the

Special Branch. But once I had to

deliver a letter to Capt. Stolz,

Gordon was there.

BEN

(concerned)

How were they interrogating him?

STANLEY

It's okay.   Tell him what you told

me.

BEN

(anxious)

What?

SEROKE

They were using the pole.

BEN

The pole, what's that?

STANLEY

(demonstrating)

They handcuff you and manacle your

feet then they put a pole between

your arms and the back of your

knees. Then you're like a chicken

ready for the oven. They hang you

between two tables. Then they do

what they like with you. The S.B.

call it the aeroplane.

BEN

I see. Who were in that room?

Stolz...

SEROKE

Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B.

(CONTINUED)

133.

BEN

You are sure?

STANLEY

He's sure.

BEN

(to himself)

It's very interesting. When was

the last time you saw him?

SEROKE

(nervous)

I saw them take the body away to

the cells. He was limp.

BEN

You did! Johnson, why do you stay

with the police? You don't really

belong there.

SEROKE

It's a job. And how can I go

away? I love my family.

SEROKE

They must never know I told you

anything. Right?

BEN

I understand.    I promise.

STANLEY

This is strictly between the

three of us. Don't worry, man.

STANLEY

(slapping his back)

Take it easy.

STANLEY (O.S.)

A beer, Lanie?

BEN

(shouting)

No, thank you. You know, Stanley,

after what happened the other

night I was about to give this

whole thing up.

(CONTINUED)

134.

STANLEY

(intrigued)

What happened, man?

BEN

My wife nearly got killed. Three

shots were fired into the house.

What right have I to expose my

family to harassment and actual

physical danger? That's what I

asked myself.

STANLEY

Three bloody shots and you crawl

on your hands and knees to people

like Stolz, and say 'I give up.'

What is the beginning for you is a

version of what we suffer all our

bloody life. Shit, I thought you

had more guts than this, man!

BEN

I didn't say I'm giving up.

STANLEY

But you thought about it.

BEN

Johnson has revived my

determination.

STANLEY

It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but

we'll survive. You and me. I

tell you!

BEN

You think we may still win in the

end, Stanley?

STANLEY

Of course not, Lanie -- but we

needn't lose either -- what

matters is to stick around.

STANLEY

By the way, man, I'm off on a trip

-- Botswana -- thought I'd tell

you in case you get worried.

BEN

Why are you going there?

(CONTINUED)

135.

STANLEY

Business. Tell you next week.

Now for the bad news I've been

saving to the last.

BEN

What?

STANLEY

Julius has been arrested. He

broke his banning order and

visited his sister. You know what

that means? At least a year's

imprisonment.

BEN

A year in jail just for visiting

his sister?

STANLEY

That's the chance he took. And

he'll be the last to complain.

BEN

Don't you think the real reason

for this arrest was that they

found out he was helping us?

STANLEY

So what? Lanie, you're not

getting guilt complexes now, are

you? That's a luxury only

liberals can afford. Julius will

be back, man. All refreshed by a

spell in the deep-freeze.

BEN

How can we shrug off a man we've

been working with?

STANLEY

Who said we're shrugging him off?

Best way of remembering a man,

Lanie, is to carry on fighting.

136.

BEN

(smiling)

What about you?

MELANIE

What?

BEN

I mean not married...

MELANIE

And living in this chaos with my

eccentric father? I love him and

we get on perfectly. We have

been together since I was a year

old. My mother could not adapt

to South Africa. She went back

to London and we've never heard

from her since.

BEN

Being a professor and bringing up

a child, how did he manage that?

MELANIE

Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a

fantastic mother. In fact she had

two families, me and her three

children in Alexandra township.

BEN

And this little girl grew up to be

a tough journalist. Why a

journalist?

MELANIE

(laughs)

Sometimes I ask myself the same

question.

(CONTINUED)

137.

MELANIE

Alright. I'll tell you. I was

brought up in a sheltered way, not

that Dad was possessive, not

openly anyway. I think he'd just

seen enough of the mess the world

was in, to want to protect me as

much as he could. Then, I went

to university. I don't know what

you'll think... being a teacher.

BEN

About what?

MELANIE

Then I married my ex-teacher.

BEN

Oh.   He must have been young.

MELANIE

Fifteen years difference. He too

protected me like Dad. Then one

day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra

and saw her home and the appalling

conditions in that township. I

was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.

BEN

Go on.

MELANIE

That made me think that I was a

parasite, something white and

maggot-like... just a thing... a

sweet and ineffectual thing. I

felt more and more claustrophobic.

Poor Brian, who loved and pampered

me. Had no idea what was

happening. I left him for a whole

year and we divorced.

BEN

And then you became a journalist?

(CONTINUED)

138.

CONTINUED:

MELANIE (O.S.)

I thought it would force me, or

help me, to expose myself. To

force me to see and to take

notice of what was happening

around me.

BEN

Did it work?

She returns to the kitchen with a cigarette.

MELANIE

I wish I could give you a straight

answer. What did help me was my

BEN

How did you manage that on a

South African passport? We South

Africans are white devils in

Africa.

MELANIE

My mother was English, remember?

So I get a British passport. It

comes in handy even for the paper.

BEN

You really are your father's

daughter!

MELANIE

I wonder what he's doing right

now. Most likely standing on a

rock, looking through his old

binoculars at springbok or a lion

or whatever.

One of the two large CATS approaches them, tail in the

air, and goes to Melanie, drubbing against her legs,

PURRING luxuriously. She picks it up into her arms.

BEN

How often does he go on these trips

to the veldt?

MELANIE

It depends --

(approaching Ben with

cat)

-- Bonjour, Ben. I'm Porto and my

friend is Bello!

Ben smiles and starts to caress Porto in Melanie's arms.

139.

EMILY

Don't you touch me!

WOMAN (V.O.)

Come back!    Buya!

CROWD

(shouts)

Buya!   Buya!

(CONTINUED)

140.

STANLEY

(irritated)

She's a widow, man. That's what

happens in Soweto when a woman

loses her man. They throw her out

of the house and out of the city.

BEN

(disgusted)

Zululand! The whole thing smells

of being an excuse to send her

hundreds of miles from the case.

And how will they live there?...

STANLEY

Shit! I was about to find her a

place, but I had to go to look

for Robert.

BEN

So, that's why you went to

Botswana for.

STANLEY

Sis Emily asked me but it was no

use. His mind was made up. He

was going to join Wellington in

Zambia.

BEN

Couldn't you stop him?   He's a

little boy, Stanley!

STANLEY

(focusing Ben in the

eyes)

He'll be back in a few years.     And

he won't be throwing stones!

141.

STANLEY

(using his usual

humor)

Good evening. I'd like to invite

you into my humble home, but it's

full of terrorists.

JAIMIE

(pointing at Stanley's

car)

Open the boot! You cheeky bastard!

STANLEY

Okay, with pleasure.

JAIMIE

Open the door and remove the seat.

OTHER POLICEMAN

Now, your pass, bliksem.

JAIMIE

You watch your bloody step!     Right?

142.

SUSAN

(calmly)

Ben, please stop whilst there's

time. Please, Ben.

BEN

(focusing on ceiling)

It's impossible to stop now, Susan.

I believe I'm right in what I'm

doing. If I stop now I'll go mad.

SUSAN

(despaired)

Whatever the price you pay for it?

BEN

(painfully)

I have got to.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOETE

Think of your heritage, man. My

God -- think of your wife, your

family, friends, neighbors.

What's going to happened to them --

all of us -- if we can't depend on

our own kind? We're

educationalists -- teachers. We

are building for the future.

BEN

Without simple justice we don't

deserve a future.

CLOETE

We're Boers, man -- Afrikaners.

We are your nation. What's justice

for us is justice -- period!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

143.

CLOETE (CONT'D)

Traitors like you are threatening

centuries of Afrikaner sacrifice.

BEN

That last remark was slanderous --

I'm simply being faithful to the

truth.

CLOETE

Slanderous? My God, man, you

slander a whole people.

CLOETE

You have given me no alternative.

I have to abide by the regulations

of the Department of Education --

so I have made my report.

And there will have to be a formal

inquiry. But until such time...

BEN

(rising)

It won't be necessary, Mr. Cloete.

I'll send you my resignation.

CLOETE

Thank you for making things much

easier.

CLOETE

And it would be better if Johan

left too.

BEN

Are you serious?

CLOETE

He's a Kaffir-lover too, isn't

he?

144.

VIVIERS

Oom Ben, I was waiting for you.

I have something interesting to

tell you.

BEN

(striding on towards

his car)

Later, Viviers.

VIVIERS

(keeping up)

But, Oom Ben, it's about the

S.B. they came to question me.

Before they started questioning

me I told them they were wasting

their time.

VIVIERS

They asked if I was cooperating

with you. What I knew about the

A.N.C. Can you imagine that! They

then said: 'Mr. Viviers you come

from a good Afrikaans family and

it's important that you realize

that communists are looking for

people like you and before you

know where you are they're using

you! And, Oom Ben...

BEN

(reaching the car;

interrupting him)

I'm sorry, Viviers. I never

wanted you to get involved.

(getting into his

car)

I have just resigned.

VIVIERS

(amazed)

What...?

145.

JOHAN

Was last year's turkey as big as

this, Papa?

BEN

About the same size.

SUZETTE

Do you remember the turkey I had

for Easter? You said it was as

big as a baby ostrich, Papa.

BEN

I don't remember that, Suzette.

FATHER-IN-LAW

You know, Johan, when I was a boy

in the Karoo, we used to fry

ostrich eggs. You know how big

they are?

JOHAN

(laughing)

As big as this table.

BEN

(to Father-in-law)

I think he deserves the parson's

nose for that remark.

(CONTINUED)

STANLEY

(obviously surprised

by this family

scene)

Oh!

(then grinning and

laughing thunderously)

Merry Christmas, everyone!

STANLEY

'Lanie'... compliments of the

season, old mate.

BEN

Stanley.   What are you doing here?

FATHER-IN-LAW

Who's this Kaffir, Ben?

STANLEY

(shocked)

Why don't you tell the Boer who

this Kaffir is?

BEN

Shut up, Stanley.

(to Father-in-law)

That's all right. I'll...

FATHER-IN-LAW

(quivering with rage)

A Kaffir calling me a Boer?

CHRIS

Ben, did you hear that?   Call the

police, Ben!

BEN

(to Father-in-law)

Please, go to the table.

(to Stanley)

Stanley, wait outside.

(CONTINUED)

147.

STANLEY

(fuming)

Who are these people, anyway?

BEN

Stanley, this is still my house.

CHRIS

Let me throw him out.

STANLEY

(laughing)

Let him try, leave him, Lanie.

BEN

(to Father-in-law)

Please leave me with him.   I'll

explain everything later.

FATHER-IN-LAW

Nothing has changed in this house.

Mother, let's go!

FATHER-IN-LAW

(to his wife)

Let's leave this house. I've been

sworn at by a Kaffir and Ben

protects him.

SUZETTE

(following)

Chris!

(CONTINUED)

148.

STANLEY

(with cascading

laughter)

Lanie! Ever in your fucking life

seen such a stampede, hah?

BEN

(furious)

Maybe you think it's funny,

Stanley, but I don't. Do you

realize what you've done?

(he sighs deeply)

Come into the dining room.

STANLEY

(chuckling)

Jeez, who was that old cunt with

the potbelly and black suit, looks

like an undertaker?

BEN

My father-in-law.

(deliberately)

M.P.

STANLEY

(sitting beside Ben)

You joking!

(he laughs)

Shit! I fucked it all up for you.

Sorry, man.

BEN

Now pull yourself together,

Stanley. It's not funny at all!

What's the matter with you today?

You're drunk and making an idiot

of yourself. Say what you've come

to say. Otherwise, go to hell!

(CONTINUED)

149.

STANLEY

(after a pause)

Right. Dead right. Put the

Kaffir in his place.

BEN

Bloody hell! Stanley, what's

wrong with you?

STANLEY

Emily is dead.

BEN

Emily dead?   How?   When?

BEN

What happened, Stanley?      Oh, my

God. Please tell me.

STANLEY

(between two sobs)

A broken heart. All they said.

BEN

God.

(CONTINUED)

150.

MELANIE

They don't know what you've got

and you're a danger to them. I

know there's a point of no return,

but with our system, one has to

plot the route with care.

BEN

That's the main reason for coming

here tonight. Melanie, I need

your help. Without Emily, we can't

pursue our civil suit. The only

thing left open to us is to expose

them through the press, and the

media here and abroad.

MELANIE

And your safety also, Ben, lies in

the press.

(pause)

That way the world will know the

brutality and power of our

security services; here questions

can be asked in Parliament. And

the white public can appreciate

the implications of the fascist

laws of this country.

BEN

You know, Melanie, I'm discovering

that the enemy is not in Soweto.

The enemy is ourselves. Our

bigotry, our laws, our system. We

have our own fight and it's just

beginning.

MELANIE

We better win before the blacks

have won.

BEN

Now, before going to the press, I

have to have all the documents. I

must have two vital affidavits;

Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and

Jonathan's friend, Wellington has

fled to Zambia.

MELANIE

Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia...

I can go to Zambia.

(CONTINUED)

151.

BEN

(surprised)

Could you?

MELANIE

And I can use my British passport.

I know my way around Lusaka.

BEN

That would be very useful.

MELANIE

This calls for a drink.    Gin and

tonic?

BEN

Please.

BEN

Melanie.   Be careful.

MELANIE

(as she plays the

record and

flippantly)

Of course, Ben.

(CONTINUED)

152.

MELANIE

Cheers!

BEN

Do be careful. I wouldn't want

you hurt.

MELANIE

(with gentleness)

Don't worry.

BEN

And hurry back.

MELANIE

(excited)

That's my favorite, Ben.

BEN

I can't dance.

MELANIE

Rugger player?

153.

BEN

Listen, you...

WOMAN

Darling, put that down, it's not

good for your cholesterol.

BEN

(to the man)

I'm sorry, my mistake.

BEN

-- How's she doing?

SUZETTE

Better... She's waiting for you to

ask her to come home.

BEN

I doubt it.

(CONTINUED)

154.

SUZETTE

Papa, I don't want to interfere...

BEN

Then don't.

SUZETTE

I know this is going to sound

strange coming from me... I mean

I haven't exactly been supportive

for the past months... I can't say

I agree with what you've done but

I respect you for what you are...

SUZETTE

I'm just... destroyed by what's

happening to us as a family.

BEN

Suzette...

SUZETTE

(interrupts, squeezing

his arm.)

Please, Papa, for Mom's sake...

For all of our sakes... Let's

try and patch it up.

MIX TO:

SUZETTE

Let me know if there's anything I

can do to help.

BEN

Thanks.   I'm glad you understand.

(CONTINUED)

155.

SUZETTE

I don't want to worry about you.

That search, this vandalism, those

shots... they're really after the

evidence you've been accumulating

... Can I look after them for you,

Papa?

BEN

You don't have to worry.   They'll

never find them.

SUZETTE

(smiling)

Where on earth do you keep them?

BEN

Dr. Hassiem? I'm Ben Du Toit.

I'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's...

DR. HASSIEM

(raising his hands)

The inquest is over, Mr. Du Toit.

BEN

Not for me, Doctor. I've got to

know what happened to Gordon.

DR. HASSIEM

I only came home yesterday. After

three months in detention and now

I'm banned and confined to the

house. There's nothing I can do

for you.

(CONTINUED)

156.

BEN

I know it may be painful to you,

Doctor, but I need to talk to you.

DR. HASSIEM

How can I be sure you weren't

actually sent by them?

BEN

Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the

process of filing a civil claim.

And your help is vital.

DR. HASSIEM

Come in.

DR. HASSIEM

Sit down.

BEN

Thank you for inviting me in.

DR. HASSIEM

(the little girl on

his knees)

What do you want to know?

BEN

Just one thing, Doctor. Why did

you sign the State Pathologist's

report on the autopsy if you drew

up your own report as well?

DR. HASSIEM

(disconcerted)

What makes you think I signed Dr.

Jansen's report.

BEN

The report produced in court had

both your signatures on it.

(CONTINUED)

157.

DR. HASSIEM

Impossible.

BEN

What did you write in your report?

DR. HASSIEM

Dr. Jansen and I didn't disagree

on the facts. After all we

examined the same body in the same

time. But just on the

interpretation. For example, if

Gordon, had really been hanged,

the marks on his throat would have

been concentrated on the front.

(he touches his

larynx)

But in this case, the bruises

were more obvious on the sides.

DR. HASSIEM

Something else really upset me,

perhaps it isn't important.

BEN

What was it?

DR. HASSIEM

(leaning forward)

You see, through a misunderstanding

I arrived at the morgue too early

for the autopsy. There wasn't a

soul around except a young African

attendant. When I told him I'd

come for the autopsy, he let me in.

The body was on the table dressed.

I noticed blood on the clothes.

BEN

And then?

DR. HASSIEM

As I examined the clothes more

closely, a police-officer came in

and said I wasn't allowed in the

morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived.

When I returned with Dr. Jansen,

half an hour later, the body was

naked.

(CONTINUED)

158.

BEN

(excited)

Doctor, we've already got the

African attendant's affidavit. He

testified that Capt. Stolz ordered

him to burn the clothes.

(pause)

Did you mention what you said in

your report?

DR. HASSIEM

Of course.   I found it most odd.

BEN

Doctor Hassiem would you be

prepared to put that in writing?

DR. HASSIEM

Please excuse me for a minute.

DR. HASSIEM

(opening the file)

This is my report. I only have

one copy.

BEN

(astounded)

You have a copy of the report?

DR. HASSIEM

I know how to hide things from the

S.B., Mr. Du Toit.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

159.

DR. HASSIEM

I hope you have as secure a place

as I have.

BEN

(with an accomplice

smile)

I think so.

STANLEY

(with expansive

gesture)

Take a pew, man.

BEN

(sitting and

excited)

We have it, Stanley!

STANLEY

Have what?

BEN

Hassiem's report. You know what

that means, Stanley? Melanie

arrives in two days. We'll have

all the evidence. Everything is

in place. We'll get them yet,

especially Stolz.

STANLEY

That's fantastic, man.

BEN

(shocked)

God!   It's Johnson Seroke.

(CONTINUED)

160.

STANLEY

Late at night. A knock on the

door. He opened and five shots,

point-blank range. Face, chest,

stomach.

BEN

(reading)

'A police spokesman when questioned

said: "It's not the first time that

a black member of the police has

lost his life in the service of

his country, fighting terrorism."

(folding paper in

disgust)

Bloody bastards! They killed him.

Stolz must have thought he knew

too much.

STANLEY

What's the score? The nurse is

detained; the mortuary attendant

has disappeared; the police van

driver who brought Jonathan to

hospital is detained. Julius is

in jail, and now Johnson dead.

BEN

Who's next on their secret list,

I wonder? How much longer must

the list grow of those who pay the

price of our efforts to clear

Gordon's name.

STANLEY

Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie?

We must keep going even more so

now. And for every bloke who's

going to die of bloody natural

causes in their hands. And for

our children's future.

BEN

I know. If I can no longer

believe that right is on my side,

if I can no longer believe in

imperative to go on, what will

become of me, Stanley?

(CONTINUED)

161.

STOLZ

We're all made of flesh and

blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all

got our flaws. And if a man likes

to sample the grass on the other

side of the fence, well, that's

his own business. But it would

be unpleasant if people found out

about it, especially if he's a

teacher.

BEN

You mean, if I cooperate, if I

stop digging, embarrassing you,

threatening you... these

photographs will disappear.

STOLZ

Let's just say I may be able to

use my influence to make sure that

a private indiscretion isn't used

against you.

BEN

Suppose I refuse?

STOLZ

Is this your son?

BEN

Johan, leave us alone, please.

STOLZ

Don't you think this business

has gone long enough?

(CONTINUED)

162.

BEN

That's for you people to decide.

Isn't it? I won't be blackmailed,

Captain -- not even by you.

STOLZ

Mind if I smoke?

STOLZ

(after lighting his

cigarette)

Now be honest. Has all the

evidence you've been collecting

in connection with Gordon Ngubene

brought you closer to the truth

you are looking for?

BEN

Yes, I think so and there's more

to come.

STOLZ

I really hoped we could talk

man-to-man.

BEN

It's not possible, Captain.    Not

between you and me.

STOLZ

It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we

allowed the dead to rest in peace.

I'm offering you a chance.

BEN

You mean my very last chance?

STOLZ

One never knows. It may not be

important to you, but we have to

survive.

BEN

If we can only survive through

murder and torture, then we have

forfeited our right to exist.

(CONTINUED)

163.

STOLZ

Is that your final answer?

BEN

Before you go. I'll tell this,

Captain. I have a pretty good

idea of what I will eventually

uncover. I mean the truth.

And I won't allow anyone or

anything to come between me and

that truth.

STOLZ

Here's my card -- my private line.

If you should change your mind...

Let's say before the end of the

week?

BEN

Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt

the photograph.

STOLZ

(leaving)

Be careful, Mr. Du Toit. There

are people who can make things

very difficult for you.

BEN

They are wasting their time. They

just can't hurt me anymore. I

trust you'll give them the message,

Captain.

JOHAN

(mischievous)

A brandy, Papa?

BEN

(smiling back, ruffling

his hair)

A gin and tonic would be fine.

164.

BEN

Excuse me, I'm waiting for a lady

with a red dress. Are there still,

many people to come?

INDIAN WOMAN

I did see her. She was ahead of

me. Maybe she's still in there.

BEN

Thank you.

BEN

Excuse me.

OFFICIAL

Can I help you?

BEN

I'm waiting for a passenger, Miss

Bruwer. She's taking a rather

long time to be cleared.

OFFICIAL

What did you say her name was?

BEN

Melanie Bruwer.

OFFICIAL

I'll go and check.

(CONTINUED)

165.

JOHAN

Is there any other exit, Papa?

BEN

No. They have to collect their

luggage and pass through customs.

JOHAN

(joking)

Maybe she can't find her bag.

BEN

(smilng back)

That's possble.

STOLZ

Afternoon, Meneer Du Toit.   Johan,

isn't it?

BEN

What now, Captain?

STOLZ

Word came to me that you were

asking after your very good friend,

Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives

come in all guises and can be

very resourceful. Now let's take

your friend, she has been using

her privilege as a journalist to

endanger the security of this

country. But you know something

else? She has been secretly

holding a British passport. A

South African passport and a

British pasport. Now you tell me,

where is her patriotism? Her

allegiance? The minister telexed

to the immigration officers here

declaring her an undesirable

immigrant. So she is being put

on the first available plane to

London. This must be heart-

breaking for you. Good afternoon,

Meneer Du Toit, Johan.

(CONTINUED)

166.

BEN

(quietly)

Let's go home, Johan.

JOHAN

I don't understand, Papa...

BEN

(striding)

I'll explain later.

JOHAN

(very proud)

I took it out. Hide it in my

secret place.

BEN

Thank you, son. You did a man's

job.

JOHAN

Somebody has dropped it through the

door.

BEN

Thank you.

Good old Melanie!

Meneer du Toit, tonight we're

STANLEY

(anxious)

What's happened, man?

BEN

(obviously still

scared)

It's you. It was a bomb.

STANLEY

And the papers?

BEN

Don't worry. Safe. Thanks to

Johan. Incidentally, I have

Wellington's affidavit. Melanie

found him. She's being deported.

The official reason is that she

possessed a British passport. I

don't know how she managed to

smuggle the envelope to me.

STANLEY

Man, it's all happening!

(CONTINUED)

STANLEY

Like a joint?

No, thanks.

What's so funny?
