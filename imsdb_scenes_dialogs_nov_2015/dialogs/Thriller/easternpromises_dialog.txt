EASTERN PROMISES

1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1

It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The

scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.

A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish

newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional

barber's shop called Ozim's.

2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2

The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)

is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).

Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit

beneath the barber's gown.

During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and

star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks

with a Russian accent.

OZIM

Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody

kids, you know... he says - `but

Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!

We're Islam!

SOYKA

Oi, how much are you taking off?

OZIM

Christmas! So I said to him...

alisverise cimac. The kid's

sixteen...

Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and

Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet

near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

OZIM (CONT'D)

They don't want to work do they.

Shicma....

EKREM

(hesitantly

interrupting)

Uncle Ozim.......

We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear

as well as cold.

OZIM

This is him.     The kid I'm talking

about.

Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem

in the mirror.

SOYKA

He looks OK to me... how you doin'

Ekrem?

Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it

as if it were enchanted...

OZIM

He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do

one lousy thing for me. Here,

look... Ekrem, take this...

Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic

bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally

terrified.

EKREM

Ozim... memnum etmek.

OZIM

We had a deal now he's backing

out.

SOYKA

(laughing)

Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.

It's obviously a psychological

thing...

OZIM

Take it Ekrem.

SOYKA

Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.

OZIM

This is the kid who walks around

like Al Capone. Take the fucking

ustura and finish this Rushca.

SOYKA

(startled)

What?

Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's

gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open

the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream

bubbles in the blood.

3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3

We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off

in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We

pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are

hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)

hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown

with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair

is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.

She is barefoot.

4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4

The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.

Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the

customer react to her ragged appearance.

TATIANA

(Russian accent)

Please... I have...

CHEMIST

For methadone I need to see paper

prescription.

The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see

blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then

faints onto the floor.

5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5

We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting

through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar

hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a

JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two

PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.

ANNA

Did you get a name?

PARAMEDIC

No.

CUT TO

6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6

A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.

Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The

theater is full of people in scrubs, including an

anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double

speed.

We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering

needle marks.

A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and

we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....

NURSE 1

Her stats are very poor, very poor.

Baby's very distressed.

Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the

contents of the bag. We see a business card from a

restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher

necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.

JUNIOR DOCTOR

Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck

on the pubic bone.

Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and

speaks softly.

ANNA

Darling... darling, can you hear

me?

NURSE

Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty-

eight, fifty-eight... fifty-seven...

JUNIOR DOCTOR

Anna, I'm trying to rotate the

shoulder medially... shit...

THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter

panic as he attempts to free the baby.

The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid

thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...

NURSE 1

Baby stats sixty-eight and in free

fall.

NURSE 2

I'm not getting a pulse.

Heartbeats. Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks

out of his depth.

AZIZ

Speak to me...

Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to

Aziz.

ANNA

(softly)

We need to get the baby out now.

Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...

AZIZ

OK, let's go.

All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at

frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious

face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice

speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between

nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.

TATIANA (V.O.)

My name is Tatiana. My father

died in the mines in my village,

so he was already buried when he

died. We were all buried there.

Buried under the soil of Russia.

That is why I left to find a better

life.

We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed

shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.

ANNA

(whispers)

You had a girl.

A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the

screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her

bloody wrist.

AZIZ

Ok.   Call it.

The Junior doctor and a nurse check watches and speak almost

in unison...

JUNIOR DOCTOR

Unidentified woman, died December

24th at 11.13.

NURSE

Baby girl, born December 24th at

11.14.

7   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. LABOR WARD - MORNING                 7

Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet.

She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries

to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.

AZIZ

Merry Christmas, Anna.

ANNA

Oh, don't be ridiculous.

He grins.

AZIZ

And you have to open it in front

of me.

Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling

gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless.

AZIZ (CONT'D)

At least pretend.

Anna considers the gloves.

ANNA

(deadpan))

In the whole entire history of my

life, I have never felt this

special.

AZIZ

Thank you.

Aziz plants a kiss on his two fingers and presses his

fingers against Anna's cheek through the open visor of the

helmet.

AZIZ (CONT'D)

Wear them.       It's cold.

8   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                         8

Anna rides her big vintage URAL motorcycle through deserted

morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O.

TATIANA (V.O.)

I am so excited this morning.

Yesterday a friend came back to

our village and he told us all

about the places on the map that I

look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London.

He's been there for real...

9   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - DAY                         9

After the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly

in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is

lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.

TATIANA (V.O.)

...he said the future of everything

was already happening in all those

places.

There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before

Anna can respond. It is ANNA'S MOTHER (HELEN) with a cup

of tea.

HELEN

Did you sleep?

ANNA

A bit.

HELEN

There's no point us tiptoeing around

if you're not even sleeping.

Helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to

leave without a smile.

ANNA

Mum?       Are you OK?

Of course not. It's Christmas.

HELEN

It's the chicken.

(pause)

The smell of chicken roasting

reminds me of him.

ANNA

You should have done beef, then.

HELEN

It wouldn't be Christmas without

tears in the gravy, would it.

STEPAN (V.O.)

(angry)

Anna! Anna!    Where did you get

this?

HELEN

(whispering)

It's your own fault for giving him

something to play with.

ANNA

(irritated)

Well, I can't read Russian, can I?

ANNA

I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found

it in the handbag of a girl who

died in my ward.

STEPAN

Do you always rob the bodies of

the dead?

ANNA

(suppressed, familiar

anger)

Of course, we all do it. It's one

of the perks of working in a

hospital.

STEPAN

Did you know that your daughter

robs the bodies of the dead?

ANNA

Stepan, is there an address?

STEPAN

You have an uncle who doesn't steal

things from the dead. Not even

their secrets.

HELEN

Oh, don't go all momentous on us,

Stepan.

(she straightens

the table cloth)

Lift your elbows.

STEPAN

You should put this in her coffin,

Anna. Bury her secrets with her

bodies.

ANNA

Body.   Singular.

ANNA (CONT'D)

How long will dinner be?

12   EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY                                       12

TATIANA (V.O.)

When I was little, London was like

a place in the Bible. I wasn't

even sure if it was real. My friend

has told me there is a place in

London where they pay girls to

sing.

SEMYON

Today it is family. Here is my

Ok, show me this card.

SEMYON (CONT'D)

It is the old card. From before

she had worked here I would remember

the name. Perhaps she ate here

once. Try this.

God, that's amazing. My dad made

gravy just like that.

they will be closed until New Year.

KIRILL

Papa, Ozim is here.

Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes!

SEMYON (CONT'D)

Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help.

It is sad.

ANNA

That's OK. I'll probably find out

more when I get her diary

translated.

SEMYON

Her diary?

ANNA

I found her diary in her bag.

SEMYON

Why did you not tell me you found

a diary?

SEMYON (CONT'D)

OK, Anna, this is how it will be.

You will bring the diary here and

I will translate it for you. Then

if we get the names of any relatives

I will call them myself. I am

something of a... community leader

for the Russians here in this

unfriendly city. What do you say?

ANNA

I was going to ask my uncle....

And when you come I will make you

What the hell has that got to do

I hand her over to the mother.

The mother is dead.

It's part of the grieving.

Anna and Helen look into each other's eyes for a moment

22A   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A

NIGHT

In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna

approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is

tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of

the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another

world.

Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There

we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin

to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23

The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and

cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests

and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing

violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish

mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.

His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel

to answer it.

When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and

moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides

his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and

holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

KIRILL

He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah.

So the coast is clear, yeah? What?

I said `coast'.

40    EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - NEXT MORNING                   40

Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier.

A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling

round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping

at their feet.

40A   INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING                                  40A

A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside

the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a

third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who

is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been

dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.

One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows

him the eagle tattoo.

OFFICER

We think he might be Russian Mafia.

Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches

to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.

When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small

star tattooed on the knee cap.

YURI

He is actually a Chechen. He is

also a member of the vory v zakone.

The stars on the knees mean he

would never kneel before anyone.

Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an

eight-pointed star on his chest.

YURI (CONT'D)

In Russian prisons, your life story

is written on your body in tattoos.

You don't exist without tattoos.

He was a captain.

Yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands.

OFFICER

There was something else. It was...

inside the body. Chest cavity.

The officer holds up a small zip-lock bag which has a

handwritten note sealed inside it. The handwriting is just

visible through the wet cellophane.

40B   EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - MORNING                          40B

Yuri steps outside the forensic tent. He opens the bag and

takes out the note. He unfolds it to read, then smiles to

himself.

Helen enters looking anxious.    We see Stepan hovering in

HELEN (CONT'D)

Stepan, come here. Tell her what

you told me.

Stepan stands primly in the doorway, strangely defiant.

ANNA

He shakes his head angrily. Finally from behind his back

he produces Tatiana's diary.

I've found somebody else.

No Anna! You don't go to someone

Iglah, it means needle.

Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.

STEPAN (CONT'D)

I go to wash my hands.

HELEN

Anna, Stepan said this girl ended

up in the hands of the vory v

zakone. Do you know what that

means?

ANNA

Just because I'm back in this room

doesn't mean I'm twelve again.

HELEN

You never listened to me even then!

Look, if I don't find a relative

in the next few days they'll put

Christine out for fostering. Once

I was bleeding. Then he tried to

rape me but he couldn't do it...

He just got madder and madder and

kept hitting me. In the end his

father came down. It was the father

who raped me. He shouted at his

son...'if you don't break a horse,

it will never be tame, Kirill'.

HELEN

Hello dear. How was your night?

HELEN (CONT'D)

Stepan's arthritis is playing up.

I'm taking dictation.

HELEN (CONT'D)

Would you like some tea or

something?

ANNA

No.

HELEN

What's wrong?

ANNA

He came to see me.

ANNA (CONT'D)

The man from the restaurant.    He

came to the hospital.

STEPAN

I told you this would happen!    I

told you!

HELEN

Sit down Stepan.

STEPAN

The devil is loose now.

ANNA

I know it's my fault...

HELEN

It's no one's fault...

STEPAN

They are in this room now.   They

are cancer...

HELEN

We should just sit down calmly and

think...

STEPAN

I have a friend from Ukraine who

owns a gun....

HELEN

Stepan!!

STEPAN

...from the war in Afghanistan.

ANNA

Shut up both of you!!!

ANNA (CONT'D)

OK... now... what would dad have

done?

STEPAN

We all know what he would have

done.

HELEN

And then he would have been

practical.

STEPAN

He would ask if there were bullets

for the gun.

HELEN

No! This isn't our world.     We're

just... ordinary people.

STEPAN

I dealt with the vory v zakone

You never worked for the fucking

KGB!

HELEN (CONT'D)

What did this man want?

ANNA

The diary. In return he'll give

us an address for Tatiana's family.

For Christine's family.

HELEN

And that's all he wants?

STEPAN

You cannot do deals with these

people!

HELEN

This isn't a deal.      It's an exchange

of information.

STEPAN

Have you forgotten already what I

just read to you?

HELEN

We must be practical.

ANNA

Stepan, I think he was threatening

to harm Christine.

HELEN

Then it's settled.

STEPAN

No!!    No!!   No!!

Import, export. This booze is just

Import-export sounds good.

Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat.

Kirill paid him to do it.

Your dad always knows the truth

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

The vory code says you don't talk

Kirill is my captain.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

When I found out what had happened,

I did what I had to do to clean

the situation up.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

It was a matter of honor. Soyka

was spreading lies about Kirill.

About your family.

(in Russian)

Kirill did the right thing.

SEMYON

I decide what is right and what is

wrong. You do not kill a vor for

no reason.

NIKOLAI

You know as well as I do Soyka was

talking to the police.

SEMYON

For a driver, you are well informed.

NIKOLAI

FSB.   They are called FSB now.

SEMYON

Whatever they call them they are

worse even than the KGB were. Maybe

the KGB and the vory v zakone were

partners in a marriage. We had

rules, they had rules.

SEMYON (CONT'D)

Now in Moscow, the thieves don't

wear tattoos and the police don't

wear uniforms. You never know who

in. Especially not a girl.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

If you want my opinion, the kid

would be better off in London.

Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's

VALERY

You went through the Crosses in

St. Petersburg?

NIKOLAI

I was in solitary confinement

fifteen times. I was called 'The

Stump' because they couldn't shift

me.

VALERY

Your father was a bitch and a weak

fucker for working with the

Government, that's right isn't it?

NIKOLAI

That's right. My father means

nothing to me. My Mother....

GYPSY

You have no mother.      She was a

whore anyway.

NIKOLAI

Yes. I have no mother and no

father. There is only the code,

the vory v zakone code which I

have always followed.

VALERY

That is why there is an empty place

above your heart. Where the stars

will go. And why there is an empty

place on your knees.

NIKOLAI

I am dead already. I died when I

was fifteen. Now I live in the

zone all the time.

GYPSY

You have never worked for the

government? Any government?

NIKOLAI

I have lived off Albanians and

Georgians. I steal from them within

the law.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

I can't walk out of here naked.

You can't walk out of here because

you're attached to a drip. Explain

Edinburgh.

NIKOLAI

Your uncle knew too much.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

I was told to get rid of him. I

was meant to send him to heaven

with a bullet in his head. Instead

I sent him to Edinburgh. With a

first-class ticket.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

He is of the old school. He

understood the situation. Exile

or death. Edinburgh was his idea.

He said they throw a great party

at New Year. And he said it was a

good excuse to get away from his

family.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

So... just a pair of jeans and a T-

shirt. A jacket. And some shoes.

you...

NIKOLAI

(in Russian)

Ah, Christ...

YURI

...and in light of other violent

incidents associated with you, the

Russian desk at Scotland Yard have

made an official request to the

Russian embassy that your undercover

operation in London be terminated.

YURI (CONT'D)

You have gone beyond what was

agreed.

YURI (CONT'D)

In my opinion you should see this

You tell the Russian desk you saw

stars over my heart. OK? Tell

them I'm through the door.

YURI

They are bound to ask... who did

you kill?

NIKOLAI

Tell them I only killed myself.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

And you can tell them I'm going to

replace Semyon at the head of the

London organization.

YURI

What drugs are they giving you?

Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.

NIKOLAI

I need you to take Semyon out of

the picture. I want you to arrest

him.

Arrest him for what?

Rape.

YURI

(incredulous)

And of course, she will testify...

NIKOLAI

She doesn't have to.   She's dead.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

But she had Semyon's baby. If you

prove the baby is his and prove

the girl was under age when the

baby was conceived, that's statutory

rape.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

All you need is the baby and some

of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons

I suggest you take his blood.

YURI

You intrigue me.

YURI (CONT'D)

If we had never had this

conversation they would have sent

you home. You could have spent

the Spring in the mountains. Riding

your bicycle to your office every

morning through fields of flowers.

this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls

up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a

long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the

zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst

over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine

stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

KIRILL

She's a little girl, Papa, a little

sweet fucking girl...

Kirill sobs then Christine cries...

KIRILL (CONT'D)

Shush, shush...

Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to

him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He

looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.

He whispers...

Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash

we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They

approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.

A pause. Christine begins to cry.

ANNA

Kirill, let me take the baby.

KIRILL

You stay where you are.

ANNA

She's cold, Kirill.

Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks

explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously

close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself

in too.

NIKOLAI

Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little

babies.

Kirill is motionless.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Something like this would be bad

for all of us. Your dad has gone

too far, Kirill.

A pause.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

It's our turn now.

Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill

hugs the baby.

Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does

he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are

locked in a long embrace.

Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his

arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.

Kirill turns to Nikolai.

Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits

Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so.

There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable

lie.

NIKOLAI

How can I become King if the King

is still in place?

A pause.   He laughs.

Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode

over the river. Kirill yells from the car...

KIRILL

You come on, Nikolai! We're missing

the fucking party of the year out

there!! Get here and drive!!

(in Russian)

That's a fucking order!!

Nikolai and Anna peer at each other.

NIKOLAI

Maybe I can drive you somewhere?

She shakes her head.

ANNA

There's someone I can call.   He'll

come and fetch us.

Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.

Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.

He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently

before Nikolai heads for the car.

104   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             104*

A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing

to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation

is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the

table.

Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and

lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to

Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana

in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.

TATIANA (V.O.)

My name is Tatiana. My father

died in the mines in my village,

so he was already buried when he

died...

Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to

peer outside, staring across the park.

105   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - SAME DAY                     105

Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,

staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary

life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.

continues...

TATIANA (V.O.)

We were all buried there. Beneath

the soil of Russia. That is why I

left to find a better life.

Nikolai finishes his drink.

THE END
