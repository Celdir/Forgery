MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

VAUGHN

Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that

eloquent solo. Now, for that point

in the ceremonies where we formally

dedicate this magnificent resort-

hotel complex, a worthwhile addition

to the recreational paradise we call

Amity.

ELLEN

Where the hell were you?

BRODY

Late.

ELLEN

I can see that. Don't you know this

is a big deal?

BRODY

Couldn't help it.

Hendricks over there...

(he indicates his

deputy)

...still has the keys

to the jeep in his

pocket, and I couldn't

find the spares.

ELLEN

Terrific. Act as if

you've been here all

along.

BRODY

How'm I supposed to do

that?

ELLEN

Look bored.

VAUGHN

(droning along)

Holiday Inn joins the Amity

Shores development

condominium complex in a

welcome expression renewed

interest in Amity Island

as the hub of the Northeast

Recreational Vacation

Wonderland. We're happy

once again to be in the

center of things, where

the action is... We've had

our share of hard times

and long winters and the

past few years have not

been easy. But today, the

sun is rising on a new

Amity, a new island filled

with promise.

(applause)

Len Peterson's Amity Shores

Development is an exciting

addition to our island.

The Holiday Inn we stand

in is likewise a new friend

who we welcome as family.

Amity means 'friendship'

and our community extends

its friendship to all who

seek her shores in peace

and harmony.

(applause)

VAUGHN

...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's

Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that

officially opens this luxurious new

hotel...

VAUGHN

Tina was selected from more than 20

of this island's lovely young

ladies in the Miss Amity competition

held every spring, and she'll

represent Amity Island in the Miss

Massachusetts Competition in Worcester

next month. When she cuts this ribbon,

she will be opening our island to

growth, to development, to planned

expansion with full employment for

our thriving community.

LUCY

I don't think she's such hot stuff.

POLO

When are we going out? You and me?

LUCY

Not tonight.

POLO

You going with Patrick?

POLO

Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as

soon as we get out of these monkey

suits?

CUT TO:

SEAN

Mom, Michael won't talk to me.

BRODY

(to Ellen)

Shouldn't he be at home?

ELLEN

Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.

VAUGHN

This money tree, you may have noticed,

is made entirely of twenty-dollar

bills, donated by Len Peterson, the

builder of Amity Shores Condominiums,

as a gesture of goodwill towards the

community. $500 as a special gift to

the Amity township scholarship fund...

VAUGHN

(prompting)

Go ahead, Tina.

VAUGHN

Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua-

Sports, for contributing the special

decorations. And now, the Amity High

School band. Refreshments on the

patio, everyone...

DISSOLVE TO:

BRODY

(seeing Peterson and

Vaughn)

Do I have to talk to those two?

ELLEN

My boss and your boss. Sure.

VAUGHN

Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.

BRODY

Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.

VAUGHN

Thank you, thank you. You know my

son, don't you?

PETERSON

The speech was right on the money.

(to Ellen)

Be a love and make sure the bar's

open, will you?

PETERSON

(to Brody)

Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd

do without her.

BRODY

Me neither.

PETERSON

(looking around)

Y'know, Brody -- for the first time

in years it's worth putting money

into this town.

BRODY

All of us thank you, okay?

ELLEN

Watch Sean for a minute?

SEAN

Can I go swimming?

BRODY

No. Find your brother, okay?

CUT TO:

MIKE

How old is your cousin?

BROOKE

Seventeen. She's a senior.

MIKE

I'm not crazy about blind dates.

ANDY

They're okay, if they got little

white canes and tin cups.

BROOKE

That's awful.

ANDY

What the hell.

(to Mike)

Did your mom put all this together?

MIKE

Yeah, it's her job.

ANDY

Is she responsible for the punch?

MIKE

No.

ANDY

Good. It's terrible.

BROOKE

My cousin will be here tomorrow.

MIKE

Great.

SEAN

Michael, Michael, Dad said to find

you.

ANDY

Okay, you did that.

SEAN

Come on, Mikey, come on...

MIKE

Okay, okay. Got to go.

TIM

(to Brooke)

Want to dance?

(she shakes her head

"no")

Okay. Later?

CUT TO:

DOUG

Get a dance yet?

TIMMY

Nope.

DOUG

Me neither.

TIMMY

Who'd you ask?

DOUG

Tina Wilcox.

TIMMY

You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.

DOUG

Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the

most beautiful girls are the

loneliest.

TIMMY

That's a crock of shit.

DOUG

I know.

BOB

Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?

DOUG

The mayor?

BOB

Larry Vaughn Junior?

(Doug shrugs)

If you see him, tell him I got a six-

pack, a blanket, and the Brebner

twins.

TIMMY

No class.

DOUG

None at all.

(pause)

I wonder what the Brebner twins are

doing tomorrow night.

BRODY

Can you take a little time out from

your busy schedule to dance with the

old man?

ELLEN

Why?

BRODY

Because they're playing our song.

PETERSON

May I have this dance?

BRODY

Sorry, I'm all booked up...

(taking Ellen)

Come, m'dear.

BRODY

Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

ELLEN

And how. I thought you wouldn't

respect me.

BRODY

I did, I did.

BRODY

Listen -- what are you doing later?

ELLEN

Fooling around?

BRODY

Right.

ELLEN

Let's get the kid home.

BRODY

Home it is.

BRODY

(to the kid)

You're getting a little big for this.

DISSOLVE TO:

BRODY

Mmmm.

ELLEN

MMMmmmorning...

BRODY

Sean's awake.

ELLEN

Door's locked.

BRODY

(kissing)

Good.

SEAN'S VOICE

The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.

ELLEN

(whispering)

Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's

sleeping.

SEAN'S VOICE

Okay.

ELLEN

C'mere...

BRODY

Mrs. Silvera?

ELLEN

Mrs. Silvera.

BRODY

Need a ride?

ELLEN

As far as the office.

CUT TO:

BRODY

Some people.

SEAN

What's daddy doing?

ELLEN

Writing a ticket.

ELLEN

Hey! That's my boss!

BRODY

Better yet.

PETERSON

Wait a minute...

BRODY

Too late, it's written.

PETERSON

Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.

(to Ellen)

Don't you have any pull with the

chief, here?

ELLEN

Do I have to?

PETERSON

(taking the ticket)

Better get a sales kit together for

after lunch. I'm taking some prospects

out.

ELLEN

See you later.

PETERSON

(to Brody)

Can't we fix it up to get this made

into a green zone or something?

BRODY

Len, pay the two dollars.

HENDRICKS

(to Red)

Tie it off on your left. Your other

left!

HENDRICKS

Good morning!

BRODY

(walking onto the

dock, Sean tagging

along)

Aren't you off-duty?

HENDRICKS

Till noon. This is on my own time.

(to Sean)

Hi, Shorty.

SEAN

I'm not short. I'm eleven.

SKIPPER

Yo! Chief!

BRODY

What?

SKIPPER

You got a gold-plater drifting in

the main channel. Big cruiser.

HENDRICKS

Whereabouts?

SKIPPER

Off the Point. No running lights,

just a diver's flag.

HENDRICKS

(aside to Brody)

Want me to run out there?

BRODY

On your own time?

HENDRICKS

Happy to do it.

BRODY

Then check it out. I'll be in the

office.

HENDRICKS

Cast off your bow line. And your

stern line. Spring line...

BRODY

Where to?

MIKE

No place special. Just hanging out.

BRODY

Sailing?

BRODY

Watch your kid brother, huh?

BROOKE

Bye, Mr. Brody.

POLO

Anyone want to sail to

the lighthouse?

PATRICK

Machs nix to me.

LUCY

Anyone got a spare

mooring line? Mine's

shot.

TINA

I've got one...

SEAN

Can I go too?

MIKE

No.

SEAN

Please.

MIKE

I said, 'No.'

BROOKE

You're not going out right away, are

you?

MIKE

Waiting for Andy.

BROOKE

I want you to meet my cousin.

MIKE

I will, I will.

SEAN

I want to go out with you. You need

a crew, don't you?

MIKE

I don't need you. Andy's here.

SEAN

You always go with Andy.

MIKE

(to Andy)

How was dive class?

ANDY

Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-

bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is

some weird shit on the bottom of the

ocean.

BROOKE

Shells and lobsters and stuff?

ANDY

Mostly old garbage. Today we found a

'48 Hudson.

SEAN

Do I have to play with the little

kids?

MIKE

Yeah. Go on, beat it.

JACKIE

Brooke! Hey!

ANDY

Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.

MIKE

I hope that's the cousin.

BROOKE

Over here. I want you to meet

somebody.

ANDY

Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.

CUT TO:

JACKIE

How fast does this go?

ANDY

With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

JACKIE

What?

MIKE

Real fast.

BROOKE

Far out!

LARRY

Coming up!

BOB

Gangway, Turkies!

ANDY

We're carrying weight.

LARRY

We'll take your supercargo.

JACKIE

Is that me?

BROOKE

That's you.

JACKIE

I've never been supercargo.

LARRY

Hey, get out of our air!

DONNY

Want a passenger?

BOB

Way to go!

CUT TO:

OUT OF THE FRAME, TO:

HENDRICKS

Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

RED

Figure they split?

HENDRICKS

Happens every season -- someone takes

off. Once we had a schooner for a

month while the owners went fox

hunting.

ANDREWS

This is all there is.

HENDRICKS

If that's it, that's it.

CUT TO:

INDIGNANT MAN

I can't watch the news, I can't watch

a ball game, I can't watch movies --

all I hear is that rotten kid with

his rotten radio... "Breaker,

Breaker..."

BRODY

I'll do what I can, but you're talking

about a federal jurisdiction...

INDIGNANT MAN

(leaving in a huff)

So call the FBI!

POLLY

Black, two sugars.

BRODY

Thanks. What else is out there?

POLLY

One petty theft, one domestic

disturbance, and an exhibitionist.

BRODY

I'll take the exhibitionist, you

handle the others.

WOMAN

Chief Brody? I want you to do

something about my first husband.

WHITE-HAIRED MAN

Martin, you have got to demand that

Grace Kinney keep her shades down.

2ND MAN

What about enforcing the "No Parking"

ordinance on Beach Road?

BRODY

In a minute, in a minute -- talk to

Mrs. Prendergast, please...

WOMAN

(continuing)

Albert keeps coming

around when I'm with

gentlemen friends and

he throws mud on their

cars...

2ND MAN

(eager to be heard)

Every time there's an out-

of-state car in my driveway,

I lose another mailbox.

Those little iron sailboats

cost thirty-two dollars

each!

BRODY

(to White Haired Man)

Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.

WHITE-HAIRED MAN

Her bedroom window faces my oldest

boy's bedroom, and she's teasing

him, dancing around in a towel, or

less...

BRODY

Dancing?

HENDRICKS

Chief...

BRODY

Hendricks. I want to go over your

reports and your Form 908.

HENDRICKS

I never heard of a 908.

BRODY

I just made it up. It means, "Get me

out of there."

(notices the camera)

What the hell's that?

HENDRICKS

Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought

it up from under that abandoned

cruiser.

BRODY

Abandoned? It's a little early in

the season for that.

HENDRICKS

Rich people. Home port is Newport,

Rhode Island.

BRODY

If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as

hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone

in the channel.

HENDRICKS

If you had a $100,000 boat there'd

be an investigation.

WHITE-HAIRED MAN

Grace Kinney is driving my boy to

distraction.

BRODY

Hendricks, get a description of that

dance.

LARGE MAN

(to Brody)

Chief Brody? I want to talk to you

about my daughter... she's 15, but

mature for her age...

WOMAN

Chief, I've been telling

Mrs. Prendergast that

it's no good just

talking about Albert,

she's got to do

something...

2ND MAN

Look -- the township is

responsible for protecting

life and property, and my

property is unprotected...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TERRY

Did you ever see a dolphin?

DIANE

Sure. They like to play. We may see

some today.

TERRY

Great!

TERRY

Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play

with the dolphins without skis...

DIANE

Ready?

TERRY

Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.

TINA

Take a break for a minute, okay?

ED

Huh?

TINA

Eddie, can we do that?

(no reaction)

Can we go skiing? We can use my

Uncle's boat. Eddie?

ED

Next week.

TINA

With you, everything's next week. I

want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?

TERRY

Faster! Faster!

TERRY

Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!

DIANE

Terry! You okay?

TERRY

Help! Help!

DIANE

Okay, okay, coming...

DIANE

(screaming)

Terry!

DIANE

Help! God, help!

DIANE

No-o-o-o-o-o...!

CUT TO:

HENDRICKS

I can't find anyone out here. They

must've gone to the bottom, or drifted

with the current.

BRODY

There should be bodies. Witnesses

say two people; one in the boat, one

skiing.

HENDRICKS (O.S.)

(filtered)

I told you -- nothing here.

BRODY

Try dragging.

HENDRICKS (O.S.)

For how long? Current's moving

everything around, and it's getting

dark.

BRODY

Stay on it. I don't care how long it

takes.

HENDRICKS (O.S.)

10-4.

TINA

We heard this noise, like a 'boomp'

out there, and when we looked, there

was just this cloud of smoke.

GRACE

That was the explosion. One minute

they were having a wonderful time,

the next, bang!

GRACE

I don't know what could've done that.

TINA

Can we go now?

TINA

Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?

BRODY

Oh, yeah. Sure.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

RED

How much longer?

HENDRICKS

Until we find something.

RED

I don't care about the overtime, I'm

hungry. And cold. And most of all,

bored.

HENDRICKS

I think we got something.

RED

About damn time.

HENDRICKS

What the hell is it?

HENDRICKS

Here it comes...

RED

Oh shit. Drop it.

HENDRICKS

What is it?

RED

Power line.

HENDRICKS

Oh, great.

RED

It comes here from Cable Junction.

HENDRICKS

Untangle it and let's go -- We don't

need a blackout on the island.

RED

(at the winch)

Now you're talking. Let's get out of

here before we do find something.

DISSOLVE TO:

ELLEN

You have to smoke so early in the

morning?

BRODY

It's good with coffee.

ELLEN

So's a donut.

SEAN

I want Fruit Loops!

MIKE

Eat Cheerios.

SEAN

You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.

ELLEN

Eat Cheerios.

BRODY

What're you guys doing today?

MIKE

(indicates Sean)

I don't know about him -- I'm going

down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

BRODY

Every day?

MIKE

What else is there to do?

BRODY

You could work out at the beach,

make a few bucks for school.

MIKE

Do I have to?

BRODY

You'll have to make up your own mind

about that.

ELLEN

Where's my day book?

BRODY

In the den.

ELLEN

He doesn't have to work all the time,

it's his vacation.

MRS. SILVERA

Good morning -- everyone up early

today?

BRODY

There's a lot going on.

ELLEN

Why don't you take a half day and

clean this junk up?

BRODY

Because, I'm in the middle of a

boating accident, I got only four

regular cops and one secretary, and

a Chief Deputy who is constantly

fiddling with the police boat. He's

another one.

ELLEN

One what?

(she finds the book)

Ah-ha!

BRODY

Boat nut. What is it about this place

that makes everyone a freak for

boating?

ELLEN

It's an island.

(she pecks him on the

cheek)

Got to run.

MIKE

I'm going.

BRODY

What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up

old cars? Bartending?

MIKE

Bartending? I'm 17.

BRODY

Okay, not bartending. Why on the

water every day?

MIKE

Because.

BRODY

Look, humor the old man -- just be

careful.

MIKE

(going)

I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.

BRODY

Don't go out if it's rough or

anything, huh? We've had a lot of

trouble.

MIKE

Okay, okay.

SEAN

Can I go with you today?

BRODY

You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie.

Okay?

MRS. SILVERA

(to Sean)

You can come with me to the market.

SEAN

All right.

BRODY

I'll be at the office.

SEAN

Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful,

all day.

CUT TO:

LUCY

(from her boat)

Where're we going?

ANDY

Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

BROOKE

The lighthouse?

ANDY

No big thing, we'll see who's out

there, maybe picnic.

MIKE

We got some stuff at the store. Ed

and Tina are going to be there.

BROOKE

Oh, sure, they would be.

JACKIE

What's the lighthouse?

MIKE

It's an island, near here, with a

lighthouse. We sometimes hang out

there, you know...

JACKIE

Great. I got some wine.

BROOKE

(aside)

The lighthouse is a make-out spot.

JACKIE

Now I really want to see it.

BROOKE

You going to fool around with Mike?

(Jackie shrugs)

Well, I'm not doing anything with

him.

JACKIE

Well, maybe I will, then.

CUT TO:

ED

Come on back up here!

TINA

Nope.

ED

Give me back my hat!

TINA

Double nope!

ANDY

Why'd they decide to move?

BROOKE

Too hot in the lighthouse?

MIKE

Too hot for those two? I can't believe

it.

JACKIE

Is there something I don't know about?

BROOKE

I told you, remember?

JACKIE

Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing

it now?

ANDY

Maybe by now they are.

MIKE

They're moving pretty fast.

JACKIE

He's cute...

TINA

Yech!

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

BRODY

As soon as I heard about it, I called

you. This thing is big!

ELKINS

After we've looked, we'll talk.

HENDRICKS

This is it.

HENDRICKS

Move back, please... back off...

open it up a little...

BRODY

See? What'd I tell you?

BRODY

Look at that!

ELKINS

First things first.

ELKINS

From the tip of the snout, please.

ELKINS

Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

BRODY

Come on, let's check the bite radius.

ELKINS

(cold)

The what?

BRODY

Bite radius. You know, the size of

the mouth?

ELKINS

The whale's mouth?

BRODY

The Shark's mouth.

ELKINS

What shark?

BRODY

The shark that did this. It was a

shark, wasn't it?

ELKINS

We don't know that, do we?

BRODY

But that's what we're here to find

out, right?

ELKINS

You don't tell me my job, and I won't

tell you about yours, okay?

HENDRICKS

I can't hear you if you're going to

whisper.

MIKE

Can we go now?

BRODY

(to Mike)

You stay here a minute.

MIKE

Oh, c'mon.

BRODY

You heard me.

JACKIE

We'll be over by the lighthouse.

MIKE

I'll be right there. Wait up.

ELKINS

Could be a shark. But maybe not.

BRODY

Look, I know a little bit about

sharks.

ELKINS

Do you?

BRODY

I know that this was probably a Great

White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...

ELKINS

(helping out)

Carcharadon Carcharias.

BRODY

That's it.

ELKINS

Okay, so that's it.

BRODY

Is there one in these waters?

ELKINS

What makes you think there might be?

BRODY

Because this big fish has been bitten

by some other big fish...

ELKINS

This is a mammal, not a fish.

BRODY

Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want

to know if a Great White Shark did

this.

ELKINS

Probably.

BRODY

That's it? Probably? Look, sharks

are attracted by blood, and thrashing

around...

ELKINS

And sound.

BRODY

(this is a new one)

Sound?

ELKINS

Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They

home in on irregular sounds, unusual

sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency

vibration.

BRODY

So there's one around here.

ELKINS

Not necessarily. These wounds could've

been inflicted 30 miles out to sea,

or more. None of them are immediately

fatal. Currents could've carried the

body 10 miles further.

HENDRICKS

(chiming in)

We got a helluva tide this month.

BRODY

Could you just keep that crowd back,

please?

MIKE

(fidgeting)

Pop...

BRODY

You stay right here. You're going in

with me.

MIKE

We came out in my boat.

BRODY

Andy can sail in it.

MIKE

I got a date!

BRODY

She'll understand.

MIKE

She won't.

ELKINS

Lower jaw displaced and

lacerated by predator

attempt to seize the tongue.

Additional large tissue

loss in the dorsal and sub-

dorsal areas, as well as

the caudal. Oriamal bite

radius 37 inches, allowing

for salt-water erosion and

subsequent small predator

and scavenger tissue

attacks...

BRODY

I don't want to discuss it.

ELKINS

It's either a Great White, or another

killer whale.

BRODY

Can't you tell?

ELKINS

Not when it's like this. This animal

has been ashore for 10, 12 hours,

and drifting for a day, at least.

Every little nibbler in the sea's

taken a bite.

BRODY

Look -- can Great White Sharks

communicate? Send out signals, or

something? You know, take revenge,

sense an enemy...

ELKINS

Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't

take things personally.

MIKE

Dad, please...

BRODY

No more sailing. You come back with

me, and that's it.

MIKE

Why me?

BRODY

Because I say so.

ANDY

I'll tie up at the town dock, don't

worry, man.

JACKIE

See you later, Mikey...

ED AND TINA

Later, bye...

(ad lib)

DISSOLVE TO:

VAUGHN

I'm showing summer rentals. We got a

helluva season going.

BRODY

We have got to talk, and we have got

to talk alone.

VAUGHN

We're alone.

BRODY

Larry, I don't know how to say this,

but I think we got a shark problem.

A real one.

VAUGHN

Are you serious?

BRODY

Of course. Look -- I've got some

missing persons, fatalities, evidence

of a large predator...

VAUGHN

No one has seen a shark -- no fin,

no bites, nothing. Be realistic.

BRODY

I got a feeling. I have to act on it --

you can understand that, can't you?

VAUGHN

Of course I can, but can't it wait?

These things cost money, and this

town doesn't have much money.

BRODY

We have to do something.

VAUGHN

We have done something -- hell, we

damn near went broke putting up a

shark watch tower on the beach --

it's the only one in 2000 miles,

y'know.

BRODY

I know, I know...

VAUGHN

And I stood by while you told the

people from Ramada and Marriott that

if they put up a hotel they'd need

$800,000 worth of steel net around

their beaches! In New England? We

all lost on that one.

BRODY

It's still a good idea.

VAUGHN

Martin, when we build up our tax

base a little, you can have everything

you want; right now, the town's broke.

BRODY

Please, Larry -- there's good reason.

Those water skiers...

VAUGHN

(interrupting)

A tragedy. But that was a boating

accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing

but a boating accident.

BRODY

Two of them are still missing!

VAUGHN

There's always deaths in these waters

that never turn up. Are they all

shark victims?

BRODY

Maybe they are!

VAUGHN

Bullshit.

BRODY

(shouting)

Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit --

there's a dead whale out there with

bites all over it!

VAUGHN

(shouting back)

What am I, an ass? When you called

me, I called Elkins, and her bosses.

Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

BRODY

Someone has to do something.

VAUGHN

(back in control)

Don't push it this time. If you do,

it won't turn out the way you want,

I guarantee you that.

VAUGHN

I've got to get back to work.

CUT TO:

BRODY

Come on, give a guy a break.

BRODY

Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...

BRODY

Hoo! Cold!

BRODY

(ad lib)

Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You

bastard. A little closer... Here

y'go...

BRODY

(exultant)

Gotcha!

DISSOLVE TO:

HENDRICKS

Chief?

BRODY

In here.

HENDRICKS

I missed you at the funeral home.

Santos said you were here.

BRODY

You didn't miss much. Christ, what a

mess.

HENDRICKS

Positive I.D.?

BRODY

The woman passenger on the boat that

blew up.

HENDRICKS

Oh.

BRODY

What about that camera?

HENDRICKS

What camera?

BRODY

That one -- from the wreck. You

brought it up, did you look inside

it?

BRODY

Well, what the hell -- might be

something worth seeing. Take it

somewhere and see if there's film in

it...

HENDRICKS

(catching on)

If there is, develop it!

BRODY

You got it.

HENDRICKS

I know just where to go.

BRODY

Not the drugstore!

HENDRICKS

Of course not, They're closed. Phil

Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.

BRODY

The drugstore's closed? What the

hell time is it?

HENDRICKS

Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

BRODY

Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close

up, okay?

BRODY

(at the door)

Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long

distance call, very important. Give

them my home phone.

HENDRICKS

Right.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLEN

(into the phone)

Thank you. I'll tell him.

BRODY

For me?

ELLEN

(hanging up)

Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard

the research vessel Aurora, presently

in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be

in radio range until half-past next

spring.

BRODY

Damn.

MIKE

Is Hooper coming to dinner?

BRODY

Not till next year.

CUT TO:

BRODY

Oh, hi -- How was dinner?

ELLEN

Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family

affair. Where were you?

BRODY

(getting up)

Santos' place.

BRODY

Oww!

ELLEN

Careful. What's wrong?

BRODY

Nothing.

ELLEN

Nothing, huh?

BRODY

That's what I said. Is there any of

that hand cleaner stuff?

ELLEN

Use the little brush there. Why were

you at Santos'?

BRODY

Found one of the missing victims

from that boat deal.

ELLEN

Oh. Want to talk about it?

BRODY

No.

ELLEN

Terrific.

BRODY

Michael.

MIKE

Yeah?

BRODY

You want to come here a minute?

SEAN

Hi Dad.

BRODY

Hiya yourself.

MIKE

What is it?

BRODY

I got something for you to do

tomorrow.

MIKE

I kind of had plans...

BRODY

Sailing?

(Mike nods)

Forget it. You're beached. Grounded.

No more boats.

MIKE

Hey, come on...

BRODY

No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at

the beach, and he's got a job for

you there. You can work until school

starts.

ELLEN

All summer?

BRODY

He wanted a job, he's got one. I

want to see that boat out of the

water by tomorrow night.

MIKE (O.S.)

Dad, please...

BRODY (O.S.)

Tomorrow night. Out of the water.

ELLEN

Not so loud!

BRODY

I know what you're going to say.

ELLEN

Do you?

BRODY

(on the bed)

In the city, it happened all the

time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop,

top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under

the Brooklyn local, old people die

alone in shitty apartments and three

weeks later someone calls the cops

because of the smell and the flies.

Call the cops. What are we, immune?

ELLEN

It was bad, wasn't it.

BRODY

The goddamn smell is always the same.

(he shudders at the

recollection)

ELLEN

Are you going to be able to sleep?

BRODY

Yeah. I think so.

(he raises his voice)

Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!

DISSOLVE TO:

PETERSON

This is the town beach; the

development naturally has its own

private access, but I wanted you to

see the concession area. Look at

that sand -- like sugar!

ELLEN

During the summer, the sun sets right

there...

(she points)

Over the water. Beautiful.

VAUGHN

(to Ellen)

I'll say hello for you.

NICHOLS

Hello -- selling some more of the

good life?

ELLEN

A piece here, a piece there, it all

adds up.

NICHOLS

Your husband's been here all morning.

What's he doing?

ELLEN

(good-naturedly)

His job.

VAUGHN

Your dad got you working?

MIKE

Yeah.

SEAN

I'm helping.

VAUGHN

You know where your dad is?

MIKE

Up there.

VAUGHN

Oh, for Christ's sake.

PETERSON

And if you have any questions about

recreational possibilities, Ellen

Brody here will be happy to answer

them.

VAUGHN

Len, can I see you a minute?

PETERSON

I think we got a couple of live ones.

VAUGHN

Brody's riding his tower.

PETERSON

(looking up)

Oh, shit.

JACKIE

This is fun! Can we go faster?

LARRY

(to Bob)

Trim.

JACKIE

Yay!

LARRY

That's my dad!

VAUGHN

(to Peterson)

Wave to my son.

PETERSON

(waving)

How the hell do we get him down from

there?

VAUGHN

Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get

them back in the bus.

MRS. BRYANT

Renee wants to know what that man is

doing way up there?

PETERSON

He's, ah, watching. A lookout.

MRS. BRYANT

For what?

RENEE

(a precocious little

girl)

It's a shark tower. I saw one in

Florida. He's looking for sharks.

VAUGHN

It's an observation platform. That's

our Chief of Police. He's just

checking it.

PETERSON

Normally, it's used for, ah, bird

watching. Nature observation. Weather

measurements, that sort of thing.

(a little desperate)

Ellen, we're running late!

ELLEN

Okay. Folks, if we could get back

on, we'll show you the country club,

and stop for lunch...

PETERSON

The country club has an 18-hole

course, putting greens, and twelve

tennis courts...

CUT TO:

BRODY

(screaming)

Out of the water! Everyone out of

the water!

BRODY

Get out of the water! Tell everyone

to get out! Now! Out of the water!

VAUGHN

(recalling another

panic)

Oh, my God...

PETERSON

What the hell is he doing?

NICHOLS

Oh, no!

BRODY

Out of the water! Now! Everyone!

ELLEN

(seeing something)

Martin! No!

BRODY

No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!

LIFEGUARD

It's bluefish! It's a school of

bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!

A SWIMMER

What's going on?

ANOTHER SWIMMER

Fish! Anyone got a net?

3RD SWIMMER

Someone get me a rod and reel!

BRODY

Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...

BRODY

Okay, it's all over, go on, it's

over. No trouble...

ELLEN

It's okay. It's over...

BRODY

It's all right, everything's all

right...

ELLEN (O.S.)

Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant,

Len, please...

DISSOLVE TO:

VAUGHN

Brody's a good man.

KAISER

Nobody says he isn't.

PETERSON

You should've been out there. You

should've seen him waving that gun,

like a maniac. There were shots fired!

VAUGHN

He thought he had a good reason.

MS. NICHOLS

But that's not rational behavior!

PETERSON

That's what I'm saying!

VAUGHN

How many people were there?

MS. NICHOLS

Hundred! Literally hundreds. What

are they going to say about us?

PETERSON

(to Vaughn)

Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to

make a buck like anybody else.

VAUGHN

So? So?

PETERSON

So it can't be done like that. The

man's a menace, plain and simple.

VAUGHN

Look, what am I supposed to do? It's

done, it's over. We have to deal

with the consequences.

SANSOM

That's what we're here to do.

VAUGHN

All right. Let's go into my office,

where we can have a little privacy.

VAUGHN

I believe we have a quorum, and

informally, I suggest we call this

meeting an executive session and

dispense with minutes...

CUT TO:

BRODY

Polly, no calls, please...

(she insists)

Okay, okay.

(he punches a button)

Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What

pictures... I'll be right down...

CUT TO:

PHIL

I don't know what you did, but that

kid stopped. I haven't heard one

peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for

days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...

BRODY

You said something about a camera.

PHIL

Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought

in this camera, see, from underwater,

and I didn't know how to get it open,

but my brother-in-law, in Montauk,

he works at a hi-fi store, and they

sell cameras, so he...

BRODY

(interrupting)

Did you get any pictures?

PHIL

Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny

thing. You can't tell much from the

negatives, I was going to blow 'em

up. Here's a test I did...

BRODY (O.S.)

Oh, Jesus. That boat...

PHIL

Not bad -- that's a real fast lens,

probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion,

though...

BRODY

What else you got?

PHIL

Let's see -- you got a minute?

BRODY

Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

PHIL

Okay, okay -- stand over there...

BRODY (O.S.)

(shaken)

That one there. That one...

CUT TO:

PETERSON

(looking up)

Speak of the devil.

BRODY

Thank God you guys were all together.

I got something for you. Proof!

VAUGHN

Martin, this is kind of an official

meeting

BRODY

Perfect. Look at this ---

VAUGHN

Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has

a question only you can answer.

BRODY

(preoccupied)

What?

PETERSON

Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill

in as an interim Chief of Police in

your absence?

BRODY

Temporarily? Uh... sure... The

question's out of left field. Why

are they asking?

NICHOLS

So Jeff could handle things? He knows

the routine, he has the authority?

BRODY

Yeah. Why?

PETERSON

It came up during the meeting.

BRODY

Look -- I just got this from Phil

Fogarty. It was in the camera

belonging to the missing divers. It

proves I was right, all along.

KAISER

Seaweed?

NICHOLS

It's underwater, isn't it? That's

why it's so dark.

SANSOM

I don't know -- what is it?

BRODY

It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus,

it's right there!

VAUGHN (O.S.)

It's nothing I can see.

BRODY

What are you all, blind? It's a shark.

Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.

PETERSON

Is that what it is?

BRODY

You're damn right that's what it is.

NICHOLS

I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

VAUGHN

Martin, it could be anything.

BRODY

(exploding)

What the hell does it take to make

sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's

right there in front of you. I know

what a goddamn shark looks like,

I've been through it, don't you

understand? I've seen this sonofabitch

before!

PETERSON

What have you seen before? This is

nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in

the lens.

BRODY

My ass!

VAUGHN

Be reasonable, please...

PETERSON

(to Vaughn)

Forget it, he won't listen.

BRODY

There is nothing to discuss.

PETERSON

(blowing up)

Will you listen to this man? Will

you just listen to him?

(to Brody)

You really caused a panic on a public

beach, you shoot up the place, God

knows who could've been injured --

what if somebody decides to sue us?

That could ruin us.

BRODY

Is that what it is? Dollars? Money?

I'll pay for it. Take it out of my

salary.

PETERSON

You don't make enough.

BRODY

Maybe I don't make as much money as

some bullshit rip-off artists around

here, but I don't work the same way.

PETERSON

What's that supposed to mean?

BRODY

It means I don't like all that grab-

ass and heavy breathing with my wife,

it means I know who's out to screw

me here, and it means that I know

something none of you know because

I've been there -- and I don't want

to go through that horror again.

Ever!

VAUGHN

Martin, could you wait here for a

few minutes while we make up our

minds about something?

BRODY

Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

CUT TO:

PETERSON

I won't mention his personal attack

on me.

NICHOLS

I've never seen him like this.

PETERSON

And Hendricks is qualified, you heard

that from his own mouth.

KAISER

We made a motion and it was already

seconded.

VAUGHN

(official)

Very well then. It is moved and

seconded that Martin Brody be relieved

of his duties as Chief of Police,

his contract with the township be

terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks

be appointed Acting Chief in the

interim. Those in favor?

PETERSON

Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?

VAUGHN

I'm sorry, but I respect his

convictions. The motion is carried.

VAUGHN

Martin? Could you come in please?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ELLEN

Hi. I closed a sale today, without

Len. That's $1200 commission, if the

papers go through.

BRODY

That's great.

ELLEN

Sean's asleep.

BRODY

That's great too. Gorgeous.

BRODY

You look about 22 years old sitting

there. Like you were doing homework...

ELLEN

(sensitive)

What's wrong?

BRODY

Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired,

that's all.

ELLEN

What?

BRODY

What'd I say?

ELLEN

That you were fired.

BRODY

Then that's what I meant. Fired.

Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen

just made Hendricks the new Chief of

Police. Just like that.

ELLEN

Because of today? The beach?

BRODY

(expansively)

No sweat. A blessing in disguise.

Back to the city, you can go to

Bloomingdale's without waiting six

hours for the ferryboat... we're

surrounded by water here, you realize

that? Me, surrounded by water...

Ridiculous.

ELLEN

Stop that! We're not going any place.

You love it here. Tell me what the

hell happened!

BRODY

Showed them the photo, showed them

the goddamn Shark, big as life. They

didn't see it. Not like me. Not like

the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped

this li'l picture... He's out there,

somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot

off my big mouth, so they fired me...

ELLEN

(studying the photo)

Honey, this is nothing... I don't

know what it is. What did they...

BRODY

(going on)

...Everybody wants the job. No one

wants the authority. Except Hendricks.

Fine. He can go out there in that

precious boat, and when he looks

whitey in his big mouth he can just

call me. Call me in New York... tell

him to kiss my ass...

ELLEN

(seeing his pain)

They have no right to treat you like

that. You've given them everything.

For four years, you've protected

this town, the people on this

island...

BRODY

Fired me!

(at Ellen)

I'm not a hysterical man. I'm

responsible. I know what I saw...

ELLEN

I know you did...

BRODY

I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now,

I'm tired... I can't keep fighting

it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...

ELLEN

You're drunk is what you are...

ELLEN

Take it easy... Easy...

SEAN

Is dad home? I heard something...

ELLEN

Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's

sleeping.

SEAN

What's this?

ELLEN

Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.

CUT TO:

DOUG

(holding a book)

That's what I want -- a gaff rig.

TIMMY

Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail

schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this --

the Mayan, an Alden schooner.

BOB

Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at

the town hall.

MIKE

I know.

DOUG

(innocently)

Did he really freak out at the beach?

MIKE

I don't know.

ANDY

Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want

to play pong for money?

LARRY

How was the show?

ED

Yech.

TINA

It was okay.

PATRICK

I'd rather go the lighthouse.

LUCY

Who wouldn't.

POLO

Anyone want to go the lighthouse?

BROOKE

Now? At night?

POLO

Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day.

My folks left two cases of beer in

the garage.

PATRICK

Is it still there?

POLO

Nope. Got it in my boat.

LUCY

All-right.

JACKIE

Let's go for it.

TINA

Mike, you going?

MIKE

Why shouldn't I?

LARRY

I thought you might still be painting

the restrooms at the beach.

BROOKE

Anyone want a coke or anything?

JACKIE

I'd like to go out to the lighthouse

with you.

MIKE

I'm not sure I can.

JACKIE

It'll be fun, come on!

MIKE

Maybe you and Brooke could come over

to the town beach...

JACKIE

No way. Everybody's going sailing.

If you don't want to take me, just

say so.

MIKE

That's not it. My dad told me not to

go.

JACKIE

You do everything your parents tell

you?

MIKE

No.

JACKIE

Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.

(to the gang)

Eight o'clock, everybody!

JACKIE

(aside to Mike)

I really want to to be there.

(to the crowd)

Who's bringing the wine? And who's

got a quarter for the box?

BROOKE

She just likes to tease. I think she

really likes you.

MIKE

Great.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SEAN

(whispering)

You're going out.

MIKE

Yeah.

SEAN

You're going sailing.

MIKE

Maybe.

SEAN

Take me.

MIKE

No.

SEAN

(louder)

I want to go with you!

MIKE

Quiet!  Shhh!

SEAN

(even louder)

Michael...

MIKE

Okay, okay. Close your door.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BRODY

Good morning, America...

CUT TO:

ELLEN

What're you going to do today?

BRODY

Turn in the car. Clean my desk,

explain things to our sons, then

maybe get shit-faced and punch your

boss.

ELLEN

I'll give notice.

BRODY

Don't rush into it -- we may need

the income.

BRODY

Mike left early. Couldn't wait to

make out. Must be a morning man.

MRS. SILVERA

Morning. Anything special today?

ELLEN

Sean's not up yet. You

know what he likes,

just some Fruit Loops

and milk. No candy.

BRODY

The sink upstairs is busted.

Try some Drano, or a

plunger, maybe. Or call

your brother, the plumber,

what's his name...

MRS. SILVERA

Frankie. He's my cousin.

BRODY

Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs

an apprentice.

MRS. SILVERA

Have a nice day.

CUT TO:

ANDY

If you're beached, why are we doing

this? For practice?

MIKE

Yeah.

ANDY

Then why are we futzing around the

dock? We can make a few bucks working

at the beach.

MIKE

Look -- if you're going to get in

the way, you can just go home.

SEAN

I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in

the way?

ANDY

You're always in the way.

MARGE

This guy giving you any trouble?

SEAN

Put me down!

ANDY

Put him down in the water.

MARGE

(to Sean)

You want to go out in my boat?

SEAN

Yeah.

MIKE

Would you take him?

MARGE

Sure.

ANDY

You've just made someone very happy.

BROOKE

Mike! Are you going out?

MIKE

Maybe.

JACKIE

I thought you were grounded.

MIKE

I can go out if I want to.

ANDY

You can?

JACKIE

You going to the lighthouse?

MIKE

Why not?

ANDY

I could give you a dozen good reasons.

MIKE

(to Andy)

Shut up.

ANDY

Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind

you.

JACKIE

Is there room on your boat for all

of us?

ANDY

Well, we're pretty crowded, and I

don't know when we're leaving...

TIMMY

I've got room.

BROOKE

Great.

(to Andy)

That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.

TIMMY

You will?

BROOKE

Sure.

TIMMY

Fan-tas-tic!

JACKIE

I'm ready.

JACKIE

Come on, you guys.

ANDY

Well, I don't know...

JACKIE

Please come with us?

JACKIE

For me...?

ANDY

What the hell. For you...

BOB

I thought you said she was going

with us?

LARRY

Let's just go sailing, okay?

BOB

(casting off)

Want to talk about it?

LARRY

Want to swim home?

ANDREWS

Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be

in class!

ANDY

Today I'm staying topside. You dive

for me!

ANDREWS

I'm going for lobster.

JACKIE

Great! Find one for me.

ANDY

With butter, if they got any...

ANDREWS

So long, turkies.

ANDREWS

Sparky will take you down today. If

everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.

CROSBY

(to Andrews)

Let's get some dinner.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SPARKY

Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us

in!

CUT TO:

TINA

You want to tack, or just leave her

pointed up like this?

ED

(snuggling close)

Just like this.

TINA

What about sailing?

ED

The tide's running. It'll take us to

the light.

TINA

It'll take us to Budapest if you're

not careful.

ED

First things first.

TINA

What about the others?

ED

They'll be there when we get there.

Might even have a fire started.

TINA

What're we going to do in the mean

time?

ED

I dunno. We'll think of something.

ED

But first, a little juice...

TINA

And second?

ED

(kissing her)

Mmmmmm.

TINA

(resisting)

Wait a minute. Promise me something.

ED

Anything. Anything.

TINA

That you'll put down a blanket. I've

got black and blue marks all over my

butt, and my Mom's getting uptight

about them.

ED

You got it.

LUCY

Faster! Faster!

PATRICK

Coming about...

POLO

(to a near-by boat)

Great day! I think the wind's going

to change...

MARGE

Coming up.

SEAN

Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!

DOUG

I'm getting new sails, then watch

out. Just a question of modifying

the rigging!

JACKIE

Wheee! Faster!

ANDY

How fast is enough?

JACKIE

I want to go faster!

MIKE

Hang on...

BOB

You coming up on him?

LARRY

You bet. Hang on...

LARRY

Coming up! Give way!

ANDY

Like hell! We're on the starboard

tack!

JACKIE

Don't let him pass. Faster!

JACKIE

My hair's getting wet!

ANDY

So's mine.

JACKIE

When do we get to the lighthouse?

ANDY

Soon, dark eyes, soon.

MIKE

The tide's turning.

ANDY

We're going to be fighting the

current.

(he looks up)

Wind's backing around a few points,

too.

JACKIE

I can't wait to get there.

ANDY

But of course.

CUT TO:

ELLEN

Hey -- it's not your job any more.

I'm going to be late for work.

BRODY

Just one minute...

BRODY

What the hell happened?

SPARKY

Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood.

Came up too damn fast. Held his

goddamn breath!

HENDRICKS

Easy...

CROSBY

He panicked! Something scared him!

ATTENDANT

It's okay. We're taking care of him.

BRODY

How'd this happen?

SPARKY

Bite reflex, like a spasm.

BRODY

When?

HENDRICKS

Right after, the Kids went out?

ELLEN

What Kids? Who went out?

HENDRICKS

All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn,

Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all

that whole gang.

ELLEN

Mike? Our Mike?

HENDRICKS

Yep. Looked like they were headed to

the lighthouse.

BRODY

How long ago?

HENDRICKS

About an hour, maybe two.

(thinking)

Let's see -- I came on about eight...

ELLEN

What're you doing?

BRODY

Going out.

HENDRICKS

Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief

any more.

HENDRICKS

I can't let you take her out.

BRODY

You can't stop me.

HENDRICKS

Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go,

then you can't go. Neither of you

can go.

ELLEN

I'm going.

BRODY

Mike's out there.

HENDRICKS

But I signed for the boat. You're

not authorized any more.

BRODY

Untie that rope.

HENDRICKS

Please. It's my job.

ELLEN

I'll do it.

HENDRICKS

Mrs. Brody, please...

HENDRICKS

You're too close. Back off.

BRODY

Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope

there.

HENDRICKS

Let me. Please.

ELLEN

Hurry, please.

HENDRICKS

What the hell, they can't fire both

of us -- someone's got to be in

charge, right? Which way are we going?

BRODY

Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you

said something about the lighthouse.

Get us there.

CUT TO:

BRODY

Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.

HARBOR PATROL (V.O.)

(filtered)

Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody?

BRODY

Affirmative. Can you get your chopper

airborne?

PATROL VOICE

10-4, in a few minutes. He's down

checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

BRODY

Get him the hell over to Amity Point,

the old lighthouse. Right now.

PATROL VOICE

What for?

BRODY

There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing

that way. Turn them back to port.

PATROL VOICE

That's it?

BRODY

That's it. Just do it, all right?

PATROL VOICE

10-4, soon as I can raise him.

BRODY

If they're not at the light, look

for them. I don't want them out there.

Get them back to port!

PATROL VOICE

(exasperated)

Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the

Kids day-sailing back to port. I

heard you. Patrol out.

CUT TO:

DONNIE

Hungry?

DENISE

Starving. Let's go eat now.

DONNIE

(shouting to Susie)

We're going in to eat!

CUT TO:

LARRY

Hey! Brody! Want to race?

MIKE

(confident)

Sure.

LARRY

How about a side bet to make it

interesting?

JACKIE

That's fun! Let's race for something!

MIKE

Name it.

LARRY

Loser sails home alone.

ANDY

(aside to Mike)

You're betting what you already got.

MIKE

I don't care.

JACKIE

I love it.

ANDY

Sure you do -- you win either way.

JACKIE

(simply)

I'm supposed to.

LARRY

It's a bet. Once around the marker

buoy?

MIKE

That's the pin -- the buoy.

ANDY

(pulling away)

Turkeys! Eat wind!

MIKE

Yee-hah!

DOUG

Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!

BROOKE

Can't -- we're watching a race!

DOUG

Since when? Who's racing?

TIMMY

Larry and Mike!

LUCY

Mike and Larry are racing! Loser

goes home alone!

PATRICK

If we beat them, they can both go

home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie

can come back in this boat!

LUCY

What about me?

PATRICK

Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo

a hand going in...

LUCY

(snapping him with a

rope)

Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's

turning with the tide. Sailing back

is going to be a bitch.

PILOT

(filtered, into his

mike)

Air Patrol to Base. I have visual

contact on the Kids. Going down to

use the loud hailer...

PILOT (V.O.)

This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to

port immediately. Return -- to --

port -- immediately.

ANDY

(to Mike)

Your dad must be really pissed.

MIKE

We better go back in.

ANDY

It's not going to be easy.

JACKIE

What's wrong?

MIKE

We're fighting wind and current. I

though we'd be out longer, catch the

incoming tide.

ANDY

Putz -- that won't be for hours.

MIKE

I was counting on hours.

CHOPPER (V.O.)

Return -- to -- port.

MIKE

We're trying, we're trying.

LUCY

Heading back?

PATRICK

Might as well.

POLO

They're turning around.

LUCY

Coming about, then.

SEAN

Are we going back?

MARGE

Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...

DOUG

Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!

DOUG

Make that the Titanic.

PILOT

Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're

turning back.

CONTROL

All right, Patrol. Go back to work.

You've wasted enough time.

CUT TO:

ELLEN

Michael?

BRODY

It's not his boat.

ELLEN

Be careful...

HENDRICKS

Anything?

BRODY

(on the Sandpiper)

Nope...

(he sees something)

Hold on...

BRODY

Tina!

TINA

(a moan)

N-o-o-o-o-o-o...

BRODY

It's okay, it's okay. What's the

matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --

TINA

No! It's still there!

BRODY

What is it? What's there?

TINA

It's still there!

BRODY

(to Hendricks and

Ellen)

I need a hand here...

ELLEN

Tina, baby... what is it?

TINA

Sh... Sh... Shark...

BRODY

I knew it. I goddamn well told them.

BRODY

Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

PATROL COMMANDER (V.O.)

(filter)

This is Cape Patrol -- what is it,

Brody? I heard you weren't chief

anymore.

BRODY

Skip that. What about those kids out

sailing?

COMMANDER (V.O.)

It's all okay -- Colby got to them.

They were turning back when he left

'em.

BRODY

He left them?

COMMANDER (V.O.)

Sure. He's got work to do in Bay

Channel.

BRODY

Get him the hell back there! We got

possible fatalities! Brody out...

BRODY

I'm going out there.

HENDRICKS

Hey -- you can't do that.

ELLEN

What is it? What's the matter?

BRODY

Mike's out there.

BRODY

(to Hendricks)

Get her in. Get them both in.

ELLEN

Martin, please!

HENDRICKS

Chief, be sensible...

BRODY

Where are they?

HENDRICKS

About 10 degrees off your starboard

bow, take a heading leeward of Sand

Island, and lay her north by

northeast...

BRODY

Never mind that shit. Just point.

HENDRICKS

(pointing)

See where Cable Junction is? Look to

the left. The lighthouse. That's it.

BRODY

Got it.

ELLEN

Come back! Martin!

ELLEN

My purse is on that boat.

CUT TO:

DOUG

Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump

up this boat! And shave that silly

moustache!

DOUG

England expects every man to do his

duty... You may fire when ready,

Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full

speed ahead...

DOUG

Oh, shit.

ANDY

Someone pop your balloon?

DOUG

No problem, no problem.

JACKIE

Want a lifesaver?

MARGE

How about a skyhook?

DOUG

You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.

MIKE

Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.

DOUG

Company? The place is a mess...

DOUG

Whoops.

CUT TO:

MIKE

Doug's down!

ANDY

Doug! This way!

PATRICK

What was that about?

MARGE

You okay?

LUCY

What was that?

LARRY

So much for the rubber duck.

DOUG

A shark ate my boat.

BOB

Come on.

DOUG

I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate

my goddamn boat!

ANDY

If he liked your boat, I got some

sneakers he'll love.

KIDS

(ad lib)

...Jeez -- what did that?... A

porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale...

I think he snagged it... I hate to

pop his balloon... (Etc.)

ANDY

Raft up! Raft 'em up!

LARRY

Tie off to your strongest point.

PATRICK

Anyone need an extra line?

TIMMY

Mike's bleeding!

ANDY

Can you sail?

POLO

(testing his rudder)

Yeah! We'll take him in!

CUT TO:

BRODY

(on radio)

Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One.

Harbor Air, where are you?

CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)

(filter)

This is Air One. That you, Brody?

BRODY

It's me. Any fix on those Kids?

PILOT (V.O.)

Negative. I'm still down.

BRODY

For Christ's sake, get going! I'm

all alone out here!

PILOT (V.O.)

Brody, I got to switch frequencies,

call my boss. We'll meet you over by

Francis Shoal. Harbor Air out...

BRODY

Where the hell is Francis Shoal?

BRODY

I'm all alone out here.

RUNBY

The Amity Police Boat, under full

power, surging through the heavy

swell, Brody very much alone at the

helm.

BRODY

Shit.

DISSOLVE TO:

LARRY

Anyone know what time it is?

DOUG

3:30.

MARGE

Damn!

JACKIE

What's wrong?

BROOKE

Tide doesn't turn for three hours.

DOUG

Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46

p.m.

ANDY

What'd you do? Memorize the tide

tables?

DOUG

I can't help it, it sticks in my

mind.

BROOKE

(making light of it)

Anyone want to play charades?

PATRICK

As long as we're drifting, might as

well go with the flow.

ANDY

Not funny.

PATRICK

Three knot current?

LUCY

At least. And an offshore wind.

SEAN

What's after Cable Junction?

BOB

The Atlantic. Then Ireland.

JACKIE

Can't we stop?

BROOKE

They're probably looking for us.

DOUG

What about the fish?

LARRY

Maybe it's gone.

DOUG

They tend to follow moving things.

Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.

BROOKE

So all we have to do is land at Cable

Junction and wait.

PATRICK

First we got to get there.

LARRY

How're we going to do that floating

on this garbage...?

BOB

Anyone got another set of sails?

SEAN

Is that big thing still out there?

MARGE

Shhhh.

CUT TO:

LARRY

Hey!

BOB

(waving)

Over here!

ANDY

Don't everyone jump around!

PILOT

Air One to Base. I have a positive

location on that sailing party.

Disabled and adrift...

(he checks chart on

his knee board)

...about 3/4 miles west of Cable

Junction, wind and current carrying

them just about due east. I count

ten juveniles.

PILOT

Everyone okay? Any injuries?

ANDY

Can you put us on Cable Junction?

PILOT

I got no room for passengers.

ANDY

How about a tow? Can you rig that?

LARRY

As soon as you get us on the island,

you got to call in. My dad's the

mayor...

ANDY

(interrupting)

There's a shark...

JACKIE

You have to take us off! You have

to! Why don't you take us!

DOUG

(calming her)

It's an observation spotter, he

doesn't have the room...

PILOT

Listen. I'm going to give you an

assist to get you on Cable Junction.

Then I'll call in, and get the Coast

Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to

something.

LARRY

Look out!

JACKIE

(screams)

No-o-o-o!

SEAN

Help!

ANDY

Don't struggle!

MARGE

Sean!

CUT TO:

PATRICK

Sean! Sean!

ANDY

Don't move!

SEAN

Andy! Please help! Help!

CUT TO:

BRODY

Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One,

come in.

BRODY

Harbor Air, do you read? Over?

PATROL VOICE

Brody? This is Patrol Base.

BRODY

Where the hell is Air One?

PATROL VOICE

That's what I'd like to know. Lost

transmission at Cable Junction.

BRODY

Did he raise the Kids?

PATROL VOICE

Last transmission said ten juveniles.

BRODY

Yeah? Then what?

PATROL VOICE

Then nothing. If you see him, tell

him to switch to an operational

frequency, or give me a status report

yourself.

BRODY

Did you say Cable Junction?

PATROL VOICE

That's what he said.

BRODY

When?

PATROL VOICE

1530 hours. Might still be there.

Base out.

CUT TO:

LARRY

Sean! Catch the rope!

BOB

The rope! The rope!

PATRICK

He's got to help or it won't work.

LUCY

Sean, baby, please...

JACKIE

It killed her. It ate her.

BROOKE

Shh. Shhh...

DOUG

It's okay, it's okay...

ANDY

Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.

ANDY

Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me

or I will kick your ass, do you hear

me?

LUCY

Listen to Andy, Sean.

ANDY

We're throwing a rope and you better

catch it, hear?

ANDY

(to Bob)

Keep an eye out for that fish.

LARRY

Throw it.

ANDY

Sean! Catch it!

LUCY

Larry!

BOB

Cable Junction's ahead!

LUCY

Can we make it?

BOB

I don't know.

LARRY

(to Jackie)

You okay?

LUCY

(alone)

Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of

God, help us, please...

(her lips move

inaudibly)

BROOKE

(to Doug)

Keep her warm.

(to Jackie)

Jackie? Baby?

PATRICK

Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?

We might steer this...

DOUG

By 7:46, when the tide turns around,

we'll be twenty miles out. More,

with this wind.

LARRY

Shut up.

DOUG

I can't stop thinking!

LUCY

(praying aloud)

God, please help us, Merciful Father,

in Christ's name, we beg you, help

us, please, Dear God, save us, help

us, please, God, help...

CUT TO:

BRODY

Thank Christ.

CUT TO:

POLO

Over here! Yo!

BRODY

I'm coming alongside!

BRODY

Mike? Is that you?

MIKE

Pop. I'm sorry.

BRODY

It's okay. What happened?

POLO

A shark hit us out there.

TIMMY

Mike got knocked over.

MIKE

I passed out, but I'm okay.

BRODY

At least you're safe. What about the

others?

BRODY

Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about

the others?

MIKE

(tears in his eyes)

Sean's still out there.

BRODY

What?

MIKE

He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't

it? It was okay before...

POLO

The others are ratted together.

Drifting.

BRODY

Which way?

TIMMY

With the current. Towards Cable

Junction.

MIKE

Dad, I'm sorry...

BRODY

Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just

stay here.

BRODY

Stay at the lighthouse!

CUT TO:

ANDY

Bring her to port a little. That's

it -- steady.

DOUG

I think we're changing course a

little.

BROOKE

Can we land on it?

LUCY

If we can get to it.

JACKIE

We're going to die.

BROOKE

(comforting her)

It's all right, we're okay.

ANDY

More to port.

BOB

It's all the way over.

ANDY

Shit.

SEAN

Are we going to go on the island?

BROOKE

You bet, kiddo.

ANDY

(the realist)

I don't know.

LARRY

What the hell, we're steering for

it.

DOUG

The wind drift is lateral.

LARRY

What's that mean?

DOUG

Sideways -- For every yard we go

this way, we also slide sideways

this way...

LUCY

But we had it! We were headed right

for it!

ANDY

Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

JACKIE

We're going to miss it!

ANDY

Don't!

DOUG

Stop paddling!

LUCY

But the island!

ANDY

The Shark.

BROOKE

What is it?

ANDY

We're hung up on something.

DOUG

Maybe the bottom.

JACKIE

(hysteria)

It's that thing. It's going to kill

us now... We're going to die!

LARRY

Shut up! Just shut Up!

BROOKE

Leave her alone!

BOB

Lighten up, man...

LARRY

It's bad enough without

her freaking out.

PATRICK

She's hysterical, goddamn

it!

LUCY

Don't yell at her!

LUCY

Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!

BOB

Over there! Coming this way!

SEAN

It's Dad!

ANDY

Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!

DOUG

Back down!

LARRY

We're hung up here. Snagged.

BOB

Can you get us a line?

DOUG

We got it!

PATRICK

Go ahead, slow.

LUCY

Be careful.

ANDY

Whoa!

DOUG

Come around again!

ANDY

Hang on, hang on -- we got it. You're

on!

SEAN

Dad! Help!

BRODY

Hang on!

SEAN

Dad! Dad!

BRODY

I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay...

BRODY

Can you get a line to me?

ANDY

Get the cable in! Pull!

BRODY

Son of a bitch is stuck!

DOUG

It's killing us!

JACKIE

I don't want to die! Mommy!

BRODY

Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.

Pull!

BRODY

Sean! Hang on!

ANDY

Get on the rocks!

DOUG

Swim for it!

PATRICK

Lucy! Look out!

LUCY

I'm bleeding!

BOB

Help!

BRODY

Hang on! Just hang on!

SEAN (O.S.)

Dad! Help! Daddy!

BRODY

I'm coming!

BRODY

Andy! Use the lights! The lights!

ANDY

Where are you? Chief!

BRODY (O.S.)

Sean!

BRODY

You bastard!

BRODY

Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

BRODY

Over here! You bastard! Over here

BRODY

Come and get me! Come and get me!

BRODY

Sean?

SEAN

Dad?

SEAN

They made me go with them.

BRODY

Sure they did...
