BARTON FINK

Screenplay

By

Ethan Coen & Joel Coen

FADE IN:

ACTOR

I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for

good.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye,

these four stinkin' walls, the six

flights up, the el that roars by at

three A.M. like a castiron wind.

Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!

I'll miss 'em  like hell I will!

ACTRESS

Dreaming again!

ACTOR

Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now,

awake for the first time in years.

Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a

dream if you've lived with your eyes

closed. Well my eyes are open now! I

see that choir, and I know they're

dressed in rags! But we're part of

that choir, both of us  yeah, and

you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!

MAURY

The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be

hawking the fish down on Fulton

Street.

ACTOR

Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their

hearts out.

MAURY

That's it, kid. Take that ruined

choir.  Make it sing!

ACTOR

So long, Maury.

MAURY

So long.

MAURY

We'll hear from that kid. And I don't

mean a postcard.

OLDER MAN

FISH! FRESH FISH!

LILY

Let's spit on our hands and get to

work.  It's late, Maury.

MAURY

Not any more Lil...

MAURY

...It's early.

MAITRE 'D

Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink...

several members of your party have

already arrived...

FINK

Is Garland Stanford here?

MAITRE 'D

He called to say he'd be a few minutes

late... Ah, here we are...

MAN

Barton, Barton, so glad you could

make it.  You know Richard St.

Claire...

MAN

...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking

champagne, dear boy, in honor of the

occasion. Have you seen the Herald?

BARTON

Not yet.

MAN

Well, I don't want to embarrass you

but Caven could hardly contain

himself. But more important, Richard

and Poppy here loved the play.

POPPY

Loved it! What power!

RICHARD

Yeah, it was a corker.

BARTON

Thanks, Richard, but I know for a

fact the only fish you've ever seen

were tacked to a the wall of the

yacht club.

RICHARD

Ouch!

MAN

Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all

devastated.

POPPY

Weeping! Copius tears! What did the

Herald say?

MAN

I happen to have it with me.

BARTON

Please Derek

POPPY

Do read it, do!

DEREK

"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the

Common Man. The star of the Bare

Ruined Choirs was not seen on the

stage of the Belasco last night

though the thespians involved all

acquitted themselves admirably. The

find of the evening was the author

of this drama about simple folk

fish mongers, in fact  whose brute

struggle for existence cannot quite

quell their longing for something

higher. The playwright finds nobility

in the most squalid corners and poetry

in the most callused speech. A tough

new voice in the American theater

has arrived, and the owner of that

voice is named... Barton Fink."

BARTON

They'll be wrapping fish in it in

the morning so I guess it's not a

total waste.

POPPY

Cynic!

DEREK

Well we can enjoy your success,

Barton, even if you can't.

BARTON

Don't get me wrong  I'm glad it'll

do well for you, Derek.

DEREK

Don't worry about me, dear boy  I

want you to celebrate.

BARTON

All right, but I can't start listening

to the critics, and I can't kid myself

about my own work. A writer writes

from his gut, and his gut tells him

what's good and what's... merely

adequate.

POPPY

Well I don't pretend to be a critic,

but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells

me it was simply marvelous.

RICHARD

And a charming gut it is.

POPPY

You dog!

RICHARD

(baying)

Aaa-woooooooo!

BARTON

I thought you were going to join us.

Jesus, Garland, you left me alone

with those people.

GARLAND

Don't panic, I'll join you in a

minute.  What's you think of Richard

and Poppy?

BARTON

The play was marvelous. She wept,

copiously. Millions of dollars and

no sense.

GARLAND

We have to talk a little business.

I've just been on the phone to Los

Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures

wants to put you under contract.

They've offered you a thousand dollars

a week. I think I can get them to go

as high as two.

BARTON

To do what?

GARLAND

What do you do far a living?

BARTON

I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try

to make a difference.

GARLAND

Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton,

because I respect you, but let me

point out a couple of things. One,

here you make a difference to five

hundred fifty people a night  if

the show sells out.  Eighty five

million people go to the pictures

every week.

BARTON

To see pap.

GARLAND

Yes, generally, to see pap. However,

point number two: A brief tenure in

Hollywood could support you through

the writing of any number of plays.

BARTON

I don't know, Garland; my place is

here right now. I feel I'm on the

brink of success-

GARLAND

I'd say you're already enjoying some.

BARTON

No, Garland, don't you see? Not the

kind of success where the critics

fawn over you or the producers like

Derek make a lot of money. No, a

real success  the success we've

been dreaming about  the creation

of a new, living theater of, about,

and for the common man! If I ran off

to Hollywood now I'd be making money,

going to parties, meeting the big

shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself

off from the wellspring of that

success, from the common man.

BARTON

...I guess I'm sprouting off again.

But I am certain of this, Garland:

I'm capable of more good work. Maybe

better work than I did in Choirs. It

just doesn't seem to me that Los

Angeles is the place to lead the

life of mind.

GARLAND

Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm

just the ten percenter. You decide

what you want and I'll make it happen.

I'm only asking that your decision

be informed by a little realism  if

I can use that word and Hollywood in

the same breath.

GARLAND

...Look, they love you, kid

everybody does. You see Caven's review

in the Herald?

BARTON

No, what did it say?

GARLAND

Take my copy. You're the toast of

Broadway and you have the opportunity

to redeem that for a little cash

strike that, a lot of cash.

GARLAND

...The common man'll still be here

when you get back. What the hell,

they might even have one or two of

'em out in Hollywood.

BARTON

...That's a rationalization, Garland.

GARLAND

Barton, it was a joke.

CLERK

Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I

help you, sir?

BARTON

I'm checking in. Barton Fink.

CLERK

F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be

you, huh?

BARTON

Must be.

CLERK

Okay then, everything seems to be in

order. Everything seems to be in

order.

CLERK

...Are you a tranz or a rez?

BARTON

Excuse me?

CLERK

Transient or resident?

BARTON

I don't know... I mean, I'll be here,

uh, indefinitely.

CLERK

Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a

week payable in advance. Checkout

time is twelve sharp, only you can

forget that on account you're a rez.

If you need anything, anything at

all, you dial zero on your personal

in-room telephone and talk to me. My

name is Chet.

BARTON

Well, I'm going to be working here,

mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do

you have room service?

CLERK

Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the

night clerk. I can always ring out

for sandwiches.

CLERK

...Though we provide privacy for the

residential guest, we are also a

full service hotel including

complimentary shoe shine. My name is

Chet.

CLERK

...Okay

BARTON

Huh?

CLERK

Okey-dokey, go ahead.

BARTON

What

CLERK

Don't you wanna go to your room?!

BARTON

...What number is it?

CLERK

...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell

you.

CLERK

...Those your only bags?

BARTON

The others are being sent.

CLERK

I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll

keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.

BARTON

...Six, please.

ELEVATOR MAN

Next stop: Six.

VOICE

How d'ya like your room!

BARTON

...Who is this?

VOICE

Chet!

BARTON

...Who?

VOICE

Chet! From downstairs!

VOICE

...How d'ya like your room!

FADE OUT

MAN

Is that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme

put my arms around this guy!

MAN

...How the hell are ya? Good trip?

MAN

My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this

dump. You know that  you read the

papers.

MAN

Lou treating you all right? Got

everything you need?  What the hell's

the matter with your face? What the

hell's the matter with his face,

Lou?

BARTON

It's not as bad as it looks; just a

mosquito in my room

LIPNIK

Place okay?

LIPNIK

...Where did we put him?

BARTON

I'm at the Earle.

LIPNIK

Never heard of it. Let's move him to

the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell,

he can stay at my place.

BARTON

Thanks, but I wanted a place that

was less...

LIPNIK

Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's

not a dirty word. Sat whatever the

hell you want. The writer is king

here at Capitol Pictures. You don't

believe me, take a look at your

paycheck at the end of every week

that's what we think of the writer.

(to Lou)

...so what kind of pictures does he

like?

LOU

Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference,

Mr.  Lipnik.

LIPNIK

How's about it, Bart?

BARTON

To be honest, I don't go to the

pictures much, Mr. Lipnik

LIPNIK

That's okay, that's okay, that's

okay  that's just fine. You probably

just walked in here thinking that

was going to be a handicap, thinking

we wanted people who knew something

about the medium, maybe even thinking

there was all kind of technical mumbo-

jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong.

We're only interested in one thing:

Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you

make us laugh, can you make us cry,

can you make us wanna break out in

joyous song? Is that more than one

thing? Okay.  The point is, I run

this dump and I don't know the

technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run

it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.

Showmanship. And also, and I hope

Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner

than any other kike in this town.

Did you tell him that, Lou? And I

don't mean my dick's bigger than

yours, it's not a sexual thing

although, you're the writer, you

would know more about that. Coffee?

BARTON

...Yes, thank you.

LIPNIK

Lou.

LIPNIK

...He used to have shares in the

company.  An ownership interest. Got

bought out in the twenties  muscled

out according to some. Hell, according

to me. So we keep him around, he's

got a family. Poor schmuck. He's

sensitive, don't mention the old

days. Oh hell, say whatever you want.

Look, barring a preference, Bart,

we're gonna put you to work on a

wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I

say this because they tell me you

know the poetry of the street. That

would rule out westerns, pirate

pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...

LIPNIK

But look, I'm not one of these guys

thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.

We're together on that, aren't we? I

mean I'm from New York myself  well,

Minsk if you wanna go way back, which

we won't if you don't mind and I

ain't askin'. Now people're gonna

tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery,

it's a B picture. You tell them,

bullshit. We don't make B pictures

here at Capitol.  Let's put a stop

to that rumor right now.

LIPNIK

...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us.

Talking about the Wallace Beery

picture.

LOU

Excellent picture.

LIPNIK

We got a treatment on it yet?

LOU

No, not yet Jack. We just bought the

story. Saturday Evening Post.

LIPNIK

Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace

Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know

his hopes, his dreams. Naturally,

he'll have to get mixed up with a

bad element. And a romantic interest.

You know the drill.  Romantic

interest, or else a young kid. An

orphan. What do you think, Lou?

Wally a little too old for a romantic

interest?  Look at me, a writer in

the room and I'm askin' Lou what the

goddamn story should be!

LIPNIK

...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan?

Dame?

BARTON

...Both maybe?

LOU

...Maybe we should do a treatment.

LIPNIK

Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at

it.  He'll get into the swing of

things or I don't know writers. Let's

make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple.

We don't gotta tackle the world our

first time out. The important thing

is we all have that Barton Fink

feeling, but since you're Barton

Fink I'm assuming you have it in

spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you.

We're off to a good start. Dammit,

if all our writers were like you I

wouldn't have to get so goddamn

involved. I'd like to see something

by the end of the week.

LIPNIK

...Heard about your show, by the

way. My man in New York saw it. Tells

me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty

damn moving.  A little fruity, he

said, but I guess you know what you're

doing. Thank you for your heart. We

need more heart in pictures.  We're

all expecting great things.

FADE IN:

as he continues typing. He stops after several more

BARTON

Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink

in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's

someone in the room next door to

mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh...

making a lot of... noise.

BARTON

...Thank you.

MAN

Did you... Somebody just complained...

BARTON

No, I didn't  I mean, I did call

down, not to complain exactly, I was

just concerned that you might  not

that it's my business, but that you

might be in some kind of... distress.

You see, I was trying to work, and

it's, well, it was difficult

MAN

Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered

you.  The damn walls here, well, I

just apologize like hell...

MAN

...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess

we're neighbors...

BARTON

Barton Fink.

CHARLIE

Neighbor, I'd feel better about the

damned inconvenience if you'd let me

buy you a drink.

BARTON

That's all right, really, thank you.

CHARLIE

All right, hell, you trying to work

and me carrying on in there. Look,

the liquor's good, wuddya say?

CHARLIE

... You got a glass? It's the least

I can do.

BARTON

Okay... a quick one, sure...

CHARLIE

Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell,

all the carryings-on next door.

BARTON

That's okay, I assure you. It's just

that I was trying to work

CHARLIE

What kind of work do you do, Barton,

if you don't mind my asking?

BARTON

Well, I'm a writer, actually.

CHARLIE

You don't say. That's a tough racket.

My hat's off to anyone who can make

a go of it. Damned interesting work,

I'd imagine.

BARTON

Can be. Not easy, but

CHARLIE

Damned difficult, I'd imagine.

BARTON

And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

CHARLIE

Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton,

you might say I sell peace of mind.

Insurance is my game  door-to-door,

human contact, still the only way to

move merchandise.

CHARLIE

...In spite of what you might think

from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

BARTON

Doesn't surprise me at all.

CHARLIE

Hell yes. Because I believe in it.

Fire, theft, and casualty are not

things that only happen to other

people  that's what I tell 'em.

Writing doesn't work out, you might

want to look into it. Providing for

basic human need  a fella could do

worse.

BARTON

Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.

CHARLIE

What kind of scribbler are you

newspaperman did you say?

BARTON

No, I'm actually writing for the

pictures now

CHARLIE

Pictures! Jesus!

CHARLIE

...I'm sorry, brother, I was just

sitting here thinking I was talking

to some ambitious youngster, eager

to make good.  Hell, you've got it

made! Writing for pictures! Beating

out that competition!  And me being

patronizing!

CHARLIE

...Is the egg showing or what?!

BARTON

That's okay; actually I am just

starting out in the movies  though

I was pretty well established in New

York, some renown there,

CHARLIE

Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm

not the best-read mug on the planet,

so I guess it's no surprise I didn't

recognize your name. Jesus, I feel

like a heel.

BARTON

That's okay, Charlie. I'm a

playwright. My shows've only played

New York. Last one got a hell of a

write-up in the Herald. I guess that's

why they wanted me here.

CHARLIE

Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.

What kind of venue, that is to say,

thematically, uh...

BARTON

What do I write about?

CHARLIE

Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah,

that's it, Bart.

BARTON

Well, that's a good question. Strange

as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I

write about people like you. The

average working stiff. The common

man.

CHARLIE

Well ain't that a kick in the head!

BARTON

Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way,

that's exactly the point. There's a

few people in New York  hopefully

our numbers are growing  who feel

we have an opportunity now to forge

something real out of everyday

experience, create a theater for the

masses that's based on a few simple

truths  not on some shopworn

abstractions about drama that doesn't

hold true today, if they ever did...

BARTON

...I don't guess this means much to

you.

CHARLIE

Hell, I could tell you some stories

BARTON

And that's the point, that we all

have stories. The hopes and dreams

of the common man are as noble as

those of any king. It's the stuff of

life  why shouldn't it be the stuff

of theater?  Goddamnit, why should

that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't

call it new theater, Charlie; call

it real theater. Call it our theater.

CHARLIE

I can see you feel pretty strongly

about it.

BARTON

Well, I don't mean to get up on my

high horse, but why shouldn't we

look at ourselves up there?  Who

cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop

and Lady Higginbottom and  and

and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

CHARLIE

I can feel my butt getting sore

already.

BARTON

Exactly, Charlie! You understand

what I'm saying  a lot more than

some of these literary types. Because

you're a real man!

CHARLIE

And I could tell you some stories

BARTON

Sure you could!  And yet many writers

do everything in their power to

insulate themselves from the common

man  from where they live, from

where they trade, from where they

fight and love and converse and

and  and... so naturally their work

suffers, and regresses into empty

formalism and  well, I'm spouting

off again, but to put it in your

language, the theater becomes as

phony as a three dollar bill.

CHARLIE

Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right

there.

BARTON

Frequently played, seldom remarked.

CHARLIE

Whatever that means.

BARTON

You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad

you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well

I know I sometimes run on.

CHARLIE

Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy,

I'll let you know if I'm bored. I

find it all pretty damned interesting.

I'm the kind schmoe who's generally

interested in the other guy's point

of view.

BARTON

Well, we've got something in common

then.

CHARLIE

Well Christ, if there's any way I

can contribute, or help, or whatever

BARTON

Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by

just being yourself.

CHARLIE

Well, I can tell you some stories

CHARLIE

...And look, I'm sorry as hell about

the interruption. Too much revelry

late at night, you forget there are

other people in the world.

BARTON

See you, Charlie.

BARTON

He looks around to the opposite

bed  wall.

FADE OUT

EXECUTIVE

I'm eating on the lot today

EXECUTIVE

...Who's he?

SECRETARY

Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

GEISLER

More please.

BARTON

I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum

said I should drop by morning to see

you about the

GEISLER

Ever act?

BARTON

...Huh? No, I'm

GEISLER

We need Indians for a Norman Steele

western.

BARTON

I'm a writer. Ted O

GEISLER

Think about it, Fink. Writers come

and go; we always need Indians.

BARTON

I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're

producing this Wallace Beery picture

I'm working on.

GEISLER

What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit.

They've assigned me enough pictures

for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum

doesn't know you could almost squeeze

into the Hollywood Bowl.

BARTON

Then who should I talk to?

GEISLER

Get me Lou Breeze.

SECRETARY

Is he in for Mr. Geisler?

GEISLER

Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this

morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay,

the reason I'm calling, I got a writer

here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm

producing that Wallace Beery wrestling

picture  what'm I, the goddamn

janitor around here?...  Yeah, well

who'd you get that from?...  Yeah,

well tell Lipnik he can kiss my

dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright...

No, no, all right.

GEISLER

...Okay kid, let's chow.

GEISLER

Don't worry about it. It's just a B

picture. I bring it in on budget,

they'll book it without even screening

it. Life is too short.

BARTON

But Lipnik said he wanted to look at

the script, see something by the end

of the week.

GEISLER

Sure he did. And he forgot about it

before your ass left his sofa.

BARTON

Okay. I'm just having trouble getting

started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.

I feel like I need some kind of

indication of... what's expected

GEISLER

Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture.

What do you need, a road map?

GEISLER

...Look, you're confused? You need

guidance? Talk to another writer.

BARTON

Who?

GEISLER

Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll

hit one. And do me a favor, Fink:

Throw it hard.

MAN

Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

BARTON

Barton Fink.

BARTON

...Jesus. W.P.!

MAYHEW

I beg your pardon?

BARTON

W.P. Mayhew? The writer?

MAYHEW

Just Bill, please.

BARTON

Bill!...

BARTON

...You're the finest novelist of our

time.

MAYHEW

Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein'

occupied here in the worship of

Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet

to see your play

MAYHEW

...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the

news reaches us in Hollywood.

BARTON

Sir, I'm flattered that you even

recognize my name. My God, I had no

idea you were in Hollywood.

MAYHEW

All of us undomesticated writers

eventually make their way out here

to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's

why I allus have such a powerful

thrust.

MAYHEW

...A little social lubricant, Mistuh

Fink?

BARTON

It's still a little early for me.

MAYHEW

So be it.

BARTON

...Bill, if I'm imposing you should

say so, I know you're very busy  I

just, uh... I just wonder if I could

ask you a favor... That is to say,

uh... have you ever written a

wrestling picture?

MAYHEW

...You are drippin', suh.

MAYHEW

...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented

a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew

has not, at one time or othuh, been

invited to essay. I have taken my

stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I

have stabbed at so many others, and

with as little success. I gather

that you are a fresh-man here, eager

for an upperclassman's council.

However, just at the moment...

MAYHEW

...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't

you stop at my bungalow, which is

numbah fifteen, later on this

afternoon...

MAYHEW

...and we will discuss wrastlin'

scenarios and other things lit'rary.

WOMAN

...Can I help you?

BARTON

I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink...

Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this

afternoon.  Is he in?

WOMAN

Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the

moment

MAYHEW

HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

WOMAN

Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr.

Mayhew's personal secretary. I know

this all must sound horrid. I really

do apologize...

BARTON

Is, uh... Is he okay?

AUDREY

He will be... When he can't write,

he drinks.

MAYHEW

WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S

M'HONEY!!

AUDREY

I am sorry, it's so embarassing.

BARTON

How about you? Will you be alright?

AUDREY

I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr

Fink?

BARTON

Yes I am. I'm working on a wres

please call me Barton.

AUDREY

I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm

sure he'll want to reschedule your

appointment.

BARTON

Perhaps you and I could get together

at some point also. I'm sorry if

that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't

know anyone here in this town.

AUDREY

Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

BARTON

Please, Barton.

AUDREY

Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not

just Bill's secretary  Bill and I

are... I love. We-

MAYHEW'S VOICE

M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

BARTON

I see.

AUDREY

...I know this must look... funny.

BARTON

No, no

AUDREY

We need each other. We give each

other...  the things we need

VOICE

M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of

bitches... the water's lappin' up...

M'HONEY!!

AUDREY

I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't

judge us. Please...

CHARLIE

Howdy, neighbor.

BARTON

Charlie. How are you.

CHARLIE

Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting

you again. I heard you walking around

in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

BARTON

Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really

gotten started yet  what happened

to your ear?

for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As

CHARLIE

Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic

thing.  Goes away for a while, but

it always comes back. Gotta put cotton

in it to staunch the flow of pus.

Don't worry, it's not contagious.

BARTON

Seen a doctor?

CHARLIE

Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell

me?  Can't trade my head in for a

new one.

BARTON

No, I guess you're stuck with the

one you've got. Have a seat.

CHARLIE

Thanks, I'd invite you over to my

place, but it's a goddamn mess. You

married, Bart?

BARTON

Nope.

CHARLIE

I myself have yet to be lassoed.

CHARLIE

...Got a sweetheart?

BARTON

No... I guess it's something about

my work. I get so worked up over it,

I don't know; I don't really have a

lot of attention left over, so it

would be a little unfair...

CHARLIE

Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention.

In my experience, they pretend to

give it, but it's generally a smoke-

screen for demanding it back  with

interest. How about family, Bart?

How're you fixed in that department?

BARTON

My folks live in Brooklyn, with my

uncle.

CHARLIE

Mine have passed on. It's just the

three of us now...

CHARLIE

...What's the expression  me myself

and I.

BARTON

Sure, that's tough, but in a sense,

we're all alone in this world aren't

we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by

family and friends, but...

CHARLIE

Mm... You're no stranger to

loneliness, then. I guess I got no

beef; especially where the dames are

concerned. In my line of work I get

opportunities galore  always on the

wing, you know what I'm saying. I

could tell stories to curl your hair

but it looks like you've already

heard 'em!

CHARLIE

...That's me in Kansas City, plying

my trade.

CHARLIE

...It was taken by one of my policy

holders. They're more than just

customers to me, Barton.  They really

appreciate what I have to offer them.

Ya see, her hubby was out of town at

the time

BARTON

You know, in a way, I envy you

Charlie.  Your daily routine  you

know what's expected. You know the

drill. My job is to plumb the depths,

so to speak, dredge something up

from inside, something honest. There's

no road map for that territory...

BARTON

...and exploring it can be painful.

The kind of pain most people don't

know anything about.

BARTON

...This must be boring you.

CHARLIE

Not at all. It's damned interesting.

BARTON

Yeah...

BARTON

...Probably sounds a little grand

coming from someone who's writing a

wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

CHARLIE

Beery! You got no beef there! He's

good.  Hell of an actor  though,

for my money, you can't beat Jack

Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff,

funny stuff. But don't get me wrong

Beery, a wrestling picture, that

could be a pip. Wrestled some myself

back in school. I guess you know the

basic moves.

BARTON

Nope, never watched any. I'm not

that interested in the act itself

CHARLIE

Okay, but hell, you should know what

it is. I can show you in about thirty

seconds.

CHARLIE

...You're a little out of your weight

class, but just for purposes of

demonstration

BARTON

That's all right, really

CHARLIE

Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest

thing in the world! You just get

down on your knees to my left, slap

your right hand here...

CHARLIE

...and your left hand here.

CHARLIE

...You can do it, champ!

CHARLIE

...All right now, when I say "Ready...

wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I

try and pin you. That's the whole

game. Got it?

BARTON

...Yeah, okay.

CHARLIE

Ready... wrestle!

CHARLIE

Damn, there I go again. We're gonna

wake the downstairs neighbors.  I

didn't hurt ya, did I?

BARTON

It's okay, it's okay.

CHARLIE

Well, that's all that wrestling is.

Except usually there's more grunting

and squirming before the pin. Well,

it's your first time. And you're out

of your weight class.

CHARLIE

...Jesus, I did hurt you!

CHARLIE

...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I

sure do apologize.

CHARLIE

...You sure you're okay?

BARTON

I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am.

Actually, it's been helpful, but I

guess I should get back to work.

CHARLIE

Well, it wasn't fair of me to do

that. I'm pretty well endowed

physically.

CHARLIE

...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't

be much of a match for you at mental

gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you

need anything.

FADE IN:

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

MAYHEW

If I close m'eyes I can almost smell

the live oak.

AUDREY

That's hamburger grease, Bill.

MAYHEW

Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish

on me  lyin' and deceitful...

MAYHEW

...Still, I must say. I haven't felt

peace like this since the grand

productive days. Don't you find it

so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

BARTON

Well... actually, no Bill...

BARTON

...No, I've always found that writing

comes from a great inner pain. Maybe

it's a pain that comes from a

realization that one must do something

for one's fellow man  to help somehow

to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a

personal pain. At any rate, I don't

believe good work is possible without

it.

MAYHEW

Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn'

things up. Yessir. Escape... It's

when I can't write, can't escape

m'self, that I want to tear m'head

off and run screamin' down the street

with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail.

Mm...

MAYHEW

...This'll sometimes help.

AUDREY

That doesn't help anything, Bill.

BARTON

That's true, Bill. I've never found

it to help my writing.

MAYHEW

Your writing? Son, have you ever

heard the story of Soloman's mammy-

AUDREY

You should read this, Barton. I think

it's Bill's finest, or among his

finest anyway.

MAYHEW

So now I'm s'posed to roll over like

an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly

scratched.

AUDREY

Bill

BARTON

Look, maybe it's none of my business,

but a man with your talent  don't

you think your first obligation would

be to your gift? Shouldn't you be

doing whatever you have to do to

work again?

MAYHEW

And what would that be, son?

BARTON

I don't know exactly. But I do know

what you're doing with that drink.

You're cutting yourself off from

your gift, and from me and Audrey,

and from your fellow man, and from

everything your art is about.

MAYHEW

No son, thisahere moonshine's got

nothin' to do with shuttin' folks

out. No, I'm usin' it to build

somethin'.

BARTON

What's that?

MAYHEW

I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp,

brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee

to keep that ragin' river of manure

from lappin' at m'door.

AUDREY

Maybe you better too, Barton. Before

you get buried under his manure.

MAYHEW

M'honey pretends to be impatient

with me, Barton, but she'll put up

with anything.

AUDREY

Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

BARTON

You're lucky she puts up with as

much as she does.

MAYHEW

Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye.

People who know about the human heart,

though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over

here, he gives his honey love, and

she pays him back with pity  the

basest coin there is.

AUDREY

Stop it, Bill!

MAYHEW

The truth, m'honey, is a tart that

does not bear scrutiny.

MAYHEW

Breach my levee at your peril!

AUDREY

Let him go.

BARTON

That son of a bitch... Don't get me

wrong, he's a fine writer.

MAYHEW

I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific,

and from there I'll... improvise.

BARTON

Are you all right?

MAYHEW

Silent upon a hill in Darien!

BARTON

Audrey, you can't put up with this.

AUDREY

...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for

him!

BARTON

What?! He's a son of a bitch!

AUDREY

No, sometimes he just... well, he

thinks about Estelle. His wife still

lives in Fayettesville. She's...

disturbed.

BARTON

Really?...

BARTON

...Well that doesn't excuse his

behavior.

AUDREY

He'll wander back when he's sober

and apologize. He always does.

BARTON

Okay, but that doesn't excuse his

AUDREY

Barton. Empathy requires...

understanding.

BARTON

What. What don't I understand?

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

CHARLIE

I hope these are your shoes.

BARTON

Hi, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Because that would mean they gave

you mine.

BARTON

Yeah, as a matter of fact they did.

Come on in.

CHARLIE

Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had

one of those days?

BARTON

Seems like nothing but, lately.

CHARLIE

Jesus, what a day. Felt like I

couldn't've sold ice water in the

Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't

want insurance, so okay, that's your

loss. But God, people can be rude.

Feel like I have to talk to a normal

person like just to restore a little

of my...

BARTON

Well, my pleasure. I could use a

little lift myself.

CHARLIE

A little lift, yeah...

CHARLIE

...Good thing they bottle it, huh

pal?

CHARLIE

...Did I say rude? People can be

goddamn cruel. Especially some of

their housewives. Okay, so I've got

a weight problem. That's my cross to

bear. I dunno...

BARTON

Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.

CHARLIE

Defense against what? Insurance?

Something they need? Something they

should be thanking me for offering?

A little peace of mind?...

CHARLIE

...Finally decided to knock off early,

take your advice. Went to see a doctor

about this.

CHARLIE

...He told me it was an ear infection.

Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I

told YOU my ear was infected. Why

don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well,

THAT led to an argument...

CHARLIE

...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if

my problems amounted to a hill of

beans. How goes the life of the mind?

BARTON

Well, it's been better. I can't seem

to get going on this thing. That one

idea, the one that lets you get

started  I still haven't gotten it.

Maybe I only had one idea in me  my

play. Maybe once that was done, I

was done being a writer.  Christ, I

feel like a fraud, sitting here

staring at this paper.

CHARLIE

Those two love-birds next door drivin'

you nuts?

BARTON

How did you know about that?

CHARLIE

Know about it? I can practically see

how they're doin' it. Brother, I

wish I had a piece of that.

BARTON

Yeah, but

CHARLIE

Seems like I hear everything that

goes on in this dump. Pipes or

somethin'. I'm just glad I don't

have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee

hours.

CHARLIE

...Ah, you'll lick this picture

business, believe me. You've got a

head on your shoulders. What is it

they say? Where there's a head,

there's a hope?

BARTON

Where there's life there's hope.

CHARLIE

That proves you really are a writer!

BARTON

And there's hope for you too, Charlie.

Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen

policies.

CHARLIE

Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I

gotta pull up stakes temporarily.

BARTON

You're leaving?

CHARLIE

In a few days. Out to your stompin'

grounds as a matter of fact  New

York City. Things have gotten all

balled up at the Head Office.

BARTON

I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.

I'll miss you.

CHARLIE

Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long

face!  This is still home for me  I

keep my room, and I'll be back sooner

or later...

CHARLIE

...And  mark my words  by the time

I get back you're picture'll be

finished. I know it.

BARTON

New York can be pretty cruel to

strangers, Charlie. If you need a

home-cooked meal you just look up

Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live

on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.

CHARLIE

(off)

Christ!

CHARLIE

...Your room does that too?

BARTON

I guess the heat's sweating off the

wallpaper.

CHARLIE

What a dump...

CHARLIE

...I guess it seems pathetic to a

guy like you.

BARTON

Well...

CHARLIE

Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean

to a guy from New York.

BARTON

What do you mean?

CHARLIE

This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

BARTON

Well, I guess you pick your poison.

CHARLIE

So they say.

BARTON

Don't pick up and leave without saying

goodbye.

CHARLIE

Course not, compadre. You'll see me

again.

SECRETARY

Barton Fink.

GEISLER

Yeah. Fink. Come in.

GEISLER

Wuddya got for me  what the hell

happened to your face?

BARTON

Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

GEISLER

Like hell it is; there are no

mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos

breed in swamps  this is a desert

town. Wuddya got for me?

BARTON

Well I...

GEISLER

On the Beery picture! Where are we?

Wuddya got?

BARTON

Well, to tell you the truth, I'm

having some trouble getting started

GEISLER

Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus!

Started?!  You mean you don't have

ANYthing?!

BARTON

Well not much.

GEISLER

What do you think this is? HAMLET?

GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED

GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big

men in tights! You know the drill!

BARTON

I'm afraid I don't really understand

that genre. maybe that's the prob-

GEISLER

Understand shit! I though you were

gonna consult another writer on this!

BARTON

Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-

GEISLER

Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a

souse!

BARTON

He's a great writer

GEISLER

A souse!

BARTON

You don't understand. He's in pain,

because he can't write-

GEISLER

Souse! Souse! He manages to write

his name on the back of his paycheck

every week!

BARTON

But... I thought no one cared about

this picture.

GEISLER

You thought! Where'd you get THAT

from?  You thought! I don't know

what the hell you said to Lipnik,

but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You

understand that, Fink? He LIKES you!

He's taken an interest. NEVER make

Lipnik like you. NEVER!

BARTON

I don't understand-

GEISLER

Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's

taken an interest! What the hell did

you say to him?

BARTON

I didn't say anything-

GEISLER

Well he's taken an interest!  That

means he'll make your life hell,

which I could care less about, but

since I drew the short straw to

supervise this turkey, he's gonna be

all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch

called me yesterday to ask how it's

going  don't worry, I covered for

you. Told him you were making progress

and we were all very excited. I told

him it was great, so now MY ass is

on the line.  He wants you to tell

him all about it tomorrow.

BARTON

I can't write anything by tomorrow.

GEISLER

Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't

read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell

him SOMEthing for Chrissake.

BARTON

Well what do I tell him?

GEISLER

Projection...

GEISLER

... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of

the screening rooms free this

afternoon?...  Good, book it for me.

A writer named Fink is gonna come in

and you're gonna show him wrestling

pictures... I don't give a shit which

ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a

minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg

shooting one now?... Show him some

of the dailies on that.

GEISLER

...This ought to give you some ideas.

GEISLER

...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at

Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.

Don't cross me, Fink.

BARTON

Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in

605. Can you try a number for me in

Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304.

BARTON

Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-

AUDREY

Hello.

BARTON

Audrey, listen, I need help. I know

it's late and I shouldn't be calling

you like this  believe me I wouldn't

have if I could see any other

alternative, but I  I'm sorry -

listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You

doing okay?

AUDREY

...Who is this?

BARTON

Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.

MAYHEW

Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!

AUDREY

Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good

time-

MAYHEW

Drown all those rascals...

BARTON

I'm sorry, I just feel like I know

I shouldn't ask, I just need some

kind of help, I just, I have a

deadline tomorrow-

MAYHEW

I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

AUDREY

All right Barton, I'll see if I can

slip away-

MAYHEW

Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come

into the house... sons of bitches...

BARTON

If you could, I'd

AUDREY

If I can. He gets jealous; he-

MAYHEW

Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!

BARTON

I need help, Audrey.

AUDREY

I'll try to slip out. If he quiets

down, passes out... I'm afraid he

thinks  well, he said you were a

buffoon, Barton. He becomes

irrational

MAYHEW

Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM!

DROWN 'EM! DROWN

AUDREY

Hello, Barton.

BARTON

Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank

you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such

a... Thank you.

AUDREY

Now that's all right, Barton.

Everything'll be all right.

BARTON

Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?

AUDREY

Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll

sleep for a while now. What is it

you have to do, exactly?

BARTON

Well I have to come up with  an

outline, I'd guess you call it. The

story. The whole goddamn story. Soup

to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-

AUDREY

It's alright, Barton. You don't have

to write actual scenes?

BARTON

No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey?

Have you ever had to read any of

Bill's wrestling scenarios?

AUDREY

Yes, I'm afraid I have.

BARTON

What are they like? What are they

about?

AUDREY

Well, usually, they're... simply

morality tales. There's a good

wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he

confronts at the end. In between,

the good wrestler has a love interest

or a child he has to protect.  Bill

would usually make the good wrestler

a backwoods type, or a convict. And

sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd

have the wrestler protecting an idiot

manchild.  The studio always hated

that. Oh, some of the scripts were

so... spirited!

AUDREY

...Barton.

AUDREY

...Look, it's really just a formula.

You don't have to type your soul

into it.  We'll invent some names

and a new setting.  I'll help you

and it won't take any time at all. I

did it for Bill so many times

BARTON

Did what for Bill?

AUDREY

Well... THIS.

BARTON

You wrote his scripts for him?

AUDREY

Well, the basic ideas were frequently

his-

BARTON

You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus

Christ, you wrote his  what about

before that?

AUDREY

Before what?

BARTON

Before Bill came to Hollywood.

AUDREY

Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so

to speak-

BARTON

What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey,

how long have you been his...

secretary?

AUDREY

Barton, I think we should concentrate

on OUR little project-

BARTON

I want to know how many of Bill's

books you wrote!

AUDREY

Barton!

BARTON

I want to know!

AUDREY

Barton, honestly, only the last couple-

BARTON

Hah!

AUDREY

And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,

really, when he'd been drinking-

BARTON

I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand

productive days." What a goddamn

phony.

BARTON

...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn

Phony Mayhew. All his guff about

escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!

BARTON

...Well, we don't have much time.

AUDREY

It'll be fine... Don't judge him,

Barton.  Don't condescend to him...

AUDREY

...It's not as simple as you think.

I helped Bill most by appreciating

him, by understanding him. We all

need understanding, Barton. Even

you, tonight, it's all you really

need...

BLACK

FADE IN:

CHARLIE

Are you all right?

CHARLIE

...Can I come in?

BARTON

No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

CHARLIE

Are you sure

BARTON

No... no...

CHARLIE

Barton. Are you all right?

BARTON

No... Can I come in?

CHARLIE

Why don't we go to your room-

BARTON

Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta

help me.

CHARLIE

Get a grip on yourself, brother.

Whatever the problem is, we'll sort

it out.

BARTON

Charlie, I'm in trouble  something

horrible's happened  I've gotta

call the police...

BARTON

...Will you stay with me till they

get here?

CHARLIE

Don't worry about it, Barton. We can

sort it-

BARTON

Before you go in  I didn't do this.

I don't know how it happened, but I

didn't... I want you to know that...

CHARLIE

Okay.

CHARLIE

Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...

CHARLIE

...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is

this?  What're we gonna do?

BARTON

I've gotta call the police  or you

could call for me

CHARLIE

Hold on

BARTON

You gotta believe me

CHARLIE

Hold on

BARTON

I didn't do this, I did NOT do this

CHARLIE

Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath.

Tell me what happened.

BARTON

I don't know! I woke up, she was...

God, you gotta believe me!

CHARLIE

I believe you, brother, but this

don't look good.

BARTON

We gotta call the police

CHARLIE

Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

BARTON

Yeah.

CHARLIE

What do you think happened?

BARTON

I don't know!  Maybe it was her...

boyfriend. I passed out. I don't

know.  Won't the police be able to

CHARLIE

Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!

This does not look good! They hang

people for this!

BARTON

But I didn't do it  don't you believe

me?

CHARLIE

I believe you  I KNOW you. But why

should the police?

CHARLIE

...Did you... Barton, between you

and me, did you have sexual

intercourse?

CHARLIE

Jesus... They can tell that...

BARTON

They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They

gotta have mercy!

CHARLIE

You're in pictures, Barton. Even if

you got cleared eventually, this

would ruin you.

CHARLIE

...Wait in the bathroom.

CHARLIE

You passed out.

BARTON

...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?

CHARLIE

She's dead, Barton! If that was her

name.

CHARLIE

(off)

Barton, listen to me. You gotta act

like nothing's happened. Put this

totally out of your head. I know

that's hard, but your play from here

on out is just to go about business

as usual. Give us some time to sort

this out...

CHARLIE

(off)

...Just put it out of you head...

LIPNIK

Bart! So happy to see ya!

LIPNIK

Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then

talk!  Drink?

BARTON

Yeah... rye whiskey?

LIPNIK

Boy! You writers! Work hard, play

hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

LIPNIK

... Lou.

LIPNIK

Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're

going along great.  Thinks we've got

a real winner in this one. And let

me tell you something, I'm counting

on it. I've taken an interest. Not

to interfere, mind you  hardly seems

necessary in your case. A writer  a

storyteller  of your stature.

Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart.

Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting

in the audience, the lights go down,

Capitol logo comes up... you're on!

BARTON

Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...

BARTON

...It's a tenement building. On the

Lower East Side...

LIPNIK

Great! He's poor, this wrestler!

He's had to struggle!

BARTON

And then... well...

BARTON

...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

LIPNIK

CAN you?  You damn well better be.

Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my

business dealings  well, of course,

you can't always be honest, not with

the sharks swimming around this town

but if you're a writer, you don't

think about those things  if I'd

been totally honest, I wouldn't be

within a mile of this pool  unless

I was cleaning it. But that's no

reason for you not to be. Honest, I

mean.  Not cleaning the pool.

BARTON

Well... to be honest, I'm never really

comfortable discussing a work in

progress.  I've got it all worked

out in my head, but sometimes if you

force it out in words  prematurely

the wrong words  well, your meaning

changes, and it changes your own

mind, and you never get it back  so

I'd just as soon not talk about it.

LOU

...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never

mind how long I've been in pictures.

Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just

about since they were invented. HE

practically invented them.

LOU

...Now I think if he's interested in

what one of his contract employees

is doing while he draws pay, I think

that employee ought to tell him, if

he wants to stay an employee. Right

now the contents of your head are

the property of Capitol Pictures, so

if I were you I would speak up. And

pretty goddamn fast.

LIPNIK

You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling

this man  this ARTIST  what to

do?!

LOU

Mr. Lipnik, I

LIPNIK

This man creates for a living! He

puts food on your table and on mine!

THANK him for it!  Thank him, you

ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or

YOU'RE fired!

BARTON

Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-

LIPNIK

Get down on your knees, you

sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees

and kiss this man's feet!

LOU

Mr. Lipnik, please

BARTON

I  Mr. Lipnik

LIPNIK

KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!

LIPNIK

...Okay, get out of here. You're

fired, you understand me?  Get out

of my sight.

BARTON

Mr. Lipnik, I

LIPNIK

I apologize, Barton.

BARTON

No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been

a great help

LIPNIK

You don't have to cover for him.

It's noble of you, but these things

happen in business.

BARTON

Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much

better if you could reconsider

LIPNIK

Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to

pull this out of your head. If that

sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to

you, goddammit, I will. I respect

your artistry and your methods, and

if you can't fill us in yet, well

hell, we should be kissing your feet

for your fine efforts.

LIPNIK

...You know in the old country we

were taught, as very young children,

that there's no shame in supplicatin'

yourself when you respect someone.

LIPNIK

...On behalf of Capitol Pictures,

the administration, and all a the

stockholders, please accept this as

a symbol of our apology and respect.

CHARLIE

Barton. Can I come in?

BARTON

Jesus... You're leaving.

CHARLIE

Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

BARTON

Jesus, Charlie, I...

CHARLIE

Everything's okay, believe me. I

know it's rough mentally, but

everything's taken care of.

BARTON

Charlie! I've got no one else here!

You're the only person I know in Los

Angeles...

BARTON

...that I can talk to.

CHARLIE

It's okay... It's okay...

BARTON

Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy

like I'm losing my mind. I don't

know what to do... I didn't do it,

believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie.

I just...

BARTON

...I just don't know what... to do

CHARLIE

You gotta get a grip on, brother.

You gotta just carry on  just for a

few days, till I get back. Try and

stay here, keep your door locked.

Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta

keep our heads and we'll figure it

out.

BARTON

Yeah, but Charlie

CHARLIE

Dammit, don't argue with me. You

asked me to believe you  well I do.

Now don't argue with me.

CHARLIE

...Look, pal  can you do something

for me?

CHARLIE

...Keep this for me, till I get back.

CHARLIE

...It's just personal stuff. I don't

wanna drag it with me, but I don't

trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like

to think it's in good hands.

BARTON

Sure, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Funny, huh, when everything that's

important to a guy, everything he

wants to keep from a lifetime  when

he can fit it into a little box like

that. I guess... I guess it's kind

of pathetic.

BARTON

It's more than I've got.

CHARLIE

Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll

bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll

help you finish your script. You'll

think about me...

CHARLIE

...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll

lick that story of yours.

BARTON

Thanks, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Yeah, well, see you soon, friend.

You're gonna be fine.

BARTON

You'll be back?

CHARLIE

Don't worry about that, compadre.

I'll be back.

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

BARTON

Hello... Chet... Who?...

BARTON

... No, don't send them up here.

I'll be right down.

BARTON

...You read the Bible, Pete?

PETE

Holy Bible?

BARTON

Yeah.

PETE

I think so... Anyway, I've heard

about it.

POLICEMAN

Fink?

BARTON

Yeah.

POLICEMAN #2

Detective Mastrionotti.

POLICEMAN #1

Detective Deutsch.

MASTRIONOTTI

L.A.P.D.

BARTON

Uh-huh.

DEUTSCH

Got a couple questions to ask ya.

MASTRIONOTTI

What do you do, Fink?

BARTON

I write.

DEUTSCH

Oh yeah? What kind of write?

BARTON

Well as a matter of fact, I write

for the pictures.

MASTRIONOTTI

Big fuckin' deal.

DEUTSCH

You want my partner to kiss your

ass?

MASTRIONOTTI

Would that be good enough for ya?

BARTON

No, I  I didn't mean to sound

DEUTSCH

What DID you mean?

BARTON

I  I've got respect for  for working

guys, like you

MASTRIONOTTI

Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You

live in 605?

BARTON

Yeah.

DEUTSCH

How long you been up there, Fink?

BARTON

A week, eight, nine days

MASTRIONOTTI

Is this multiple choice?

BARTON

Nine days  Tuesday

DEUTSCH

You know this slob?

BARTON

...Yeah, he... he lives next door to

me.

MASTRIONOTTI

That's right, Fink, he lives next

door to you.

DEUTSCH

Ever talk to him?

BARTON

...Once or twice. His name is Charlie

Meadows.

MASTRIONOTTI

Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

DEUTSCH

His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

MASTRIONOTTI

Also known as Madman Mundt.

DEUTSCH

He's a little funny in the head.

BARTON

What did... What did he

MASTRIONOTTI

Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate

people with a shotgun and then cut

their heads off.

DEUTSCH

Yeah, he's funny that way.

BARTON

I...

MASTRIONOTTI

Started in Kansas City. Couple of

housewives.

DEUTSCH

Couple of days ago we see the same

M.O. out in Los Feliz.

MASTRIONOTTI

Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.

DEUTSCH

All of which he's now missin'.

MASTRIONOTTI

Well, some of his throat was there.

DEUTSCH

Physician, heal thyself.

MASTRIONOTTI

Good luck with no fuckin' head.

DEUTSCH

Anyway.

MASTRIONOTTI

Hollywood precinct finds another

stiff yesterday. Not too far from

here. This one's better looking than

the doc.

DEUTSCH

Female caucasian, thirty years old.

Nice tits. No head. You ever see

Mundt with anyone meets that

description?

MASTRIONOTTI

But, you know, with the head still

on.

BARTON

...No. I never saw him with anyone

else.

DEUTSCH

So. You talked to Mundt, what about?

BARTON

Nothing, really. Said he was in the

insurance business.

DEUTSCH

Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

MASTRIONOTTI

No reputable company would hire a

guy like that.

BARTON

Well that's what he said.

DEUTSCH

What else?

BARTON

He... I'm trying to think... Nothing,

really... He... He said he liked

Jack Oakie pictures.

MASTRIONOTTI

Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say

anything you might remember could be

helpful. But I'll be frank with you:

That is not helpful.

DEUTSCH

Ya see how he's not writing it down?

MASTRIONOTTI

Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't

it?

BARTON

Yeah.

MASTRIONOTTI

Yeah, I didn't think this dump was

restricted.

MASTRIONOTTI

...Mundt has disappeared. I don't

think he'll be back. But...

MASTRIONOTTI

...give me a call if you see him. Or

if you remember something that isn't

totally idiotic.

GARLAND

Barton? What time is it? Are you all

BARTON

Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to

talk to you. I'm calling long

distance.

GARLAND

Okay.

GARLAND

...It's Barton. Calling long distance.

GARLAND

...What is it Barton? Are you okay?

BARTON

I'm fine, garland, but I have to

talk with you.

GARLAND

Go ahead, son.

BARTON

It's about what I'm writing, Garland.

It's really... I think it's really

big.

GARLAND

What do you mean, Barton?

BARTON

Not big in the sense of large

although it's that too. I mean

important. This may be the most

IMPORTANT work I've done.

GARLAND

Well, I'm... glad to hear that

BARTON

Very important, Garland. I just

thought you should know that. Whatever

happens.

GARLAND

...That's fine.

BARTON

Have you read the Bible, Garland?

GARLAND

...Barton, is everything okay?

BARTON

Yes... Isn't it?

GARLAND

Well, I'm just asking. You sound a

'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?

BARTON

This is MY dance, sailor!

SAILOR

C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out

BARTON

I'm a writer! Celebrating the

completion of something GOOD!  Do

you understand that, sailor? I'm a

WRITER!

VOICES

Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone

else spin the dame! Give the navy a

BARTON

I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!

He points at his head.

BARTON

...This is my uniform!

BARTON

...THIS is how I serve the common

MASTRIONOTTI

Mother: What is to become of him.

Father: We'll be hearing from that

crazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a

postcard. Fade out. The end.

MASTRIONOTTI

...I thought you said you were a

writer.

DEUTSCH

I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

BARTON

Keep your filthy eyes off that.

DEUTSCH

You made morning papers, Fink.

MASTRIONOTTI

Second one of your friends to end up

dead.

DEUTSCH

You didn't tell us you knew the dame.

MASTRIONOTTI

Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

DEUTSCH

Give you nose bleeds?

DEUTSCH

Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd

you put their heads?

BARTON

Charlie... Charlie's back...

MASTRIONOTTI

No kidding, bright boy  we smelt

Mundt all over this. Was he the idea

man?

DEUTSCH

Tell us where the heads are, maybe

they'll go easy on you.

MASTRIONOTTI

Only fry you once.

BARTON

Could you come back later?  It's

just...  too hot... My head is killing

me.

DEUTSCH

All right, forget the heads. Where's

Mundt, Fink?

MASTRIONOTTI

He teach you to do it?

DEUTSCH

You two have some sick sex thing?

BARTON

Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!

MASTRIONOTTI

You're a sick fuck, Fink.

DEUTSCH

All right, moron, you're under arrest.

BARTON

Charlie's back. It's hot... He's

back.

MASTRIONOTTI

...Fred...

DEUTSCH

Sit tight, Fink.

DEUTSCH

Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

MASTRIONOTTI

...Fred...

DEUTSCH

... Show yourself, Mundt!

DEUTSCH

...Mundt!

MASTRIONOTTI

There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy

case down and your mitts in the air.

MASTRIONOTTI

He's complying.

CHARLIE

LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL

SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!

CHARLIE

LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE

OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE

OF THE MIND!

CHARLIE

Heil Hitler.

CHARLIE

Barton!

CHARLIE

...Brother, is it hot.

CHARLIE

How you been, buddy?

CHARLIE

...Don't look at me like that,

neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.

BARTON

I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

CHARLIE

Jesus, people can be cruel...

CHARLIE

...if it's not my build, it's my

personality.

CHARLIE

...They say I'm a madman, Barton,

but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest

I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry

for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to

think about what they're going

through. How trapped they are. I

understand it. I feel for 'em. So I

try and help them out...

CHARLIE

...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels

like, when things get all balled up

at the head office. It puts you

through hell, Barton. So I help people

out. I just wish someone would do as

much for me...

CHARLIE

...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets

so hot, I wanna crawl right out of

my skin.

BARTON

But Charlie  why me? Why

CHARLIE

Because you DON'T LISTEN!

CHARLIE

...Jesus, I'm dripping again.

CHARLIE

...C'mon Barton, you think you know

about pain? You think I made your

life hell?  Take a look around this

dump. You're just a tourist with a

typewriter, Barton. I live here.

Don't you understand that...

CHARLIE

...And you come into MY home... And

you complain that I'M making too...

much... noise.

BARTON

...I'm sorry.

CHARLIE

Don't be.

CHARLIE

I'm getting off the merry-go-round.

CHARLIE

...I'll be next door if you need me.

CHARLIE

...Oh, I dropped in on your folks.

And Uncle Dave?

CHARLIE

...Good people. By the way, that

package I gave you? I lied. It isn't

mine.

BARTON

Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty-

five Fulton Street!

OPERATOR

I understand that, sir

BARTON

Or Uncle Dave!

OPERATOR

I understand that, sir, but there's

still no answer. Shall I check for

trouble on the line?

LIPNIK

Fink.

BARTON

Mr. Lipnik.

LIPNIK

Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.

LIPNIK

...Siddown.

LIPNIK

...I was commissioned yesterday in

the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau

arranged it. He's a dear friend.

BARTON

Congratulations.

LIPNIK

Actually it hasn't officially gone

through yet. Had wardrobe whip this

up. You gotta pull teeth to get

anything done in this town. I can

understand a little red tape in

peacetime, but now it's all-out

warfare against the Japs. Little

yellow bastards.  They'd love to see

me sit this one out.

BARTON

Yes sir, they

LIPNIK

Anyway, I had Lou read your script

for me.

LIPNIK

...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't

wash.

BARTON

With all due respect, sir, I think

it's the best work I've done.

LIPNIK

Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion

mattered, then I guess I'd resign

and let YOU run the the studio. It

doesn't and you won't, and the

lunatics are not going to run THIS

particular asylum. So let's put a

stop to THAT rumor right now.

BARTON

Yes sir.

LIPNIK

I had to call Beery this morning,

let him know we were pushing the

picture back.  After all I'd told

him about quality, about that Barton

Fink feeling. How disappointed we

were. Wally was heartbroken. The man

was devastated. He was  well, I

didn't actually call him, Lou did.

But that's a fair description, isn't

it Lou?

LOU

Yes, Colonel.

LIPNIK

Hell, I could take you through it

step by step, explain why your story

stinks, but I won't insult your

intelligence. Well all right, first

of all: This is a wrestling picture;

the audience wants to see action,

drama, wrestling, and plenty of it.

They don't wanna see a guy wrestling

with his soul  well, all right, a

little bit, for the critics  but

you make it the carrot that wags the

dog. Too much of it and they head

for exits and I don't blame 'em.

There's plenty of poetry right inside

that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten

Feet Square".

LOU

"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

LIPNIK

Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

These are big movies, Fink. About

big men, in tights  both physically

and mentally. But especially

physically. We don't put Wallace

Beery in some fruity movie about

suffering  I thought we were together

on that.

BARTON

I'm sorry if I let you down.

LIPNIK

You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou.

We don't live or die by what you

scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler

down. He liked you. Trusted you. And

that's why he's gone. Fired.  That

guy had a heart as big as the

outdoors, and you fucked him. He

tried to convince me to fire you

too, but that would be too easy. No,

you're under contract and you're

gonna stay that way.  Anything you

write will be the property of Capitol

Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will

not produce anything you write. Not

until you grow up a little. You ain't

no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn

write-off.

BARTON

I tried to show you something

beautiful.  Something about all of

US

LIPNIK

You arrogant sonofabitch!  You think

you're the only writer who can give

me that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got

twenty writers under contract that I

can ask for a Finktype thing from.

You swell-headed hypocrite!  You

just don't get it, do you?  You think

the whole world revolves inside

whatever rattles inside that little

kike head of yours. Get him outta my

sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in

town, though; he's still under

contract. I want you in town, Fink,

and outta my sight. Now get lost.

There's a war on.

BEAUTY

I said it's a beautiful day...

BARTON

Yes... It is...

BEAUTY

What's in the box?

BARTON

I don't know.

BEAUTY

Isn't it yours?

BARTON

I... I don't know...

BARTON

...You're very beautiful. Are you in

pictures?

BEAUTY

Don't be silly.
