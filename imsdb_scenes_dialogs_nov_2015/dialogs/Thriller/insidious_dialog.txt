WOMAN

Let me in.

CUT TO:

3.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mom?

4.

RENAI

What are you doing up, kiddo?

DALTON

I don't like my room.

RENAI

You'll get used to it. It's only

your first night.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Argh, I'm going to eat you.

DALTON

What are you looking at?

RENAI

Just some photos.

DALTON

What photos?

RENAI

Do you know who that is?

DALTON

No.

RENAI

That's me.

DALTON

It doesn't look like you.

RENAI

I know. I'm so happy there. But

it's me. When I was your age. I was

a kid once too, you know.

DALTON

No, you weren't.

RENAI

Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't

remember being this person at all.

I hope she smiled like that all the

time, whoever she was.

5.

RENAI (CONT'D)

This is a terrible thing to admit,

Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of

you. That you're so young. That you

haven't made any of your decisions yet.

DALTON

I don't wanna grow old.

RENAI

Well, it starts happening to us

from the moment we're born.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Every time that clock ticks, we all

get a little bit older.

RENAI (CONT'D)

That's your grandpa. You wouldn't

remember him.

DALTON

He smells like smoke.

RENAI

Yeah...good memory. He did smoke

that god awful pipe, didn't he?

DALTON

Show me a picture of dad when he

was a little kid.

RENAI

I don't even know if we have any.

He's hopeless with keeping photos.

DALTON

Show me a picture of me when I was

a little kid.

RENAI

Your pictures are all in the computer.

Nobody keeps photo albums like this

anymore, they're ancient relics. They

should. I like being able to touch

something, instead of it floating

around in cyber world. If the laptop

breaks, your whole existence is erased.

6.

DALTON

What was I like when I was a little kid?

RENAI

You are a little kid.

RENAI (CONT'D)

If only you knew what I know.

RENAI (CONT'D)

You certainly didn't cry as much as

your little sister does. Come on.

RENAI

(INTO PHONE)

Billing department.

FOSTER

I need a bowl, mom.

RENAI

Billing department.

FOSTER

It's too small.

RENAI

Make it work.

(INTO PHONE)

Speak to an agent. Speak to an

agent. Speak to an agent.

7.

JOSH

(Michael Corleone voice)

Every time I think I've pulled you

out...you grow back in.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Ouch!

RENAI

Well, I'd like to keep the old

number if I could.

(TO JOSH)

You really need to learn how to do

this, honey.

JOSH

(TO FOSTER)

Don't eat on the floor, buddy.

RENAI

(INTO PHONE)

Okay, well, please let me know by

the end of today, I have to give

the number out. Thank you.

8.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Foster, get up. Now.

JOSH

(TO RENAI)

How come you were up so early? Was

Cali crying?

RENAI

You woke me up.

JOSH

What do you mean?

RENAI

You were snoring.

JOSH

No I wasn't.

RENAI

Yes you were.

JOSH

I don't snore.

RENAI

Yes you do.

JOSH

My father snored. I do not snore.

RENAI

How would you know what you do?

You're asleep.

DALTON

Yes! I made it to the last level!

Invisiworld!

JOSH

Good one, champ.

(BEAT)

I don't snore, do I?

9.

RENAI

Where are my bleeping pills?

JOSH

What the heck is this? Wax?!

RENAI

Yes.

JOSH

Let me get this straight - we have

no actual fruit but we have wax

fruit?

RENAI

Yes.

JOSH

That is dangerous. It could kill

one of our kids.

RENAI

Where are my pills, Josh?

JOSH

Probably where you left them,

Renai.

JOSH (CONT'D)

See.

RENAI

That's not where I left them.

DALTON

Mom, I need my lunch.

RENAI

Oh, geez. Look, just...take last

night's dinner.

10.

DALTON

Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food.

RENAI

It's all we have. Just for today,

honey.

JOSH

Check it first, Dalton. It's

probably made out of Styrofoam.

RENAI

(TO DALTON)

And while I've got you, if you're

going to look at my books, please

don't leave them all over the floor.

DALTON

I didn't touch your books.

JOSH

I gotta go.

RENAI

Are you taking the boys to school?

JOSH

No time.

RENAI

Well can you pick them up after

school?

JOSH

Not today.

RENAI

But I have stuff I wanted to...

FOSTER

Can I have another cup, mom?

11.

JOSH

Alanso, please sit down.

ALANSO

No entiendo.

JOSH

Sientate, por favor.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Come on guys, quieten down.

TERI

You better all shut up.

THE ONE KID

Just cos you're in love.

JOSH

Thank you, Teri. Today we are going

to talk about Darwin. It's a city in

Australia, but it's also the last

name of which famous naturalist?

MALE STUDENT # 1

Charles Darwin.

JOSH

Correct. Does anybody know what he

is famous for?

MALE STUDENT # 1

He said that people descended from

monkeys.

JOSH

Half right. He wrote a seminal book

that explained his theories on

natural selection, and how the

different species on this planet -

including humans - evolved.

ALANSO

I know I didn't evolve from no

monkey. Shit.

12.

JOSH

Humans actually have a lot in

common with monkeys, or more

specifically, chimpanzees.

ALANSO

Maybe you do, but I was created in

the image of my Dios.

JOSH

I respect your right to believe

that, Alanso. But I want to give

you all possible theories. I want

this class to go out into the world

with an informed opinion.

ALANSO

The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert.

JOSH

How can it be incorrect? It's a

theory. A scientific theory.

ALANSO

Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We

didn't get here cos of no test-tubes.

JOSH

Alanso, if you keep talking like

that I'm going to ask you to visit

the principal.

ALANSO

Fine.

13.

RENAI

(SINGING)

Yeah, I'm looking west, always been

looking that way, gonna get it all

happening, just can't do it today...

RENAI (CONT'D)

(SINGING)

Yeah, I'm looking west, always been

looking that way, I'm gonna be

somebody, I just can't be her today--

14.

JOSH

Look at this. Nice job.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Whoa, buddy. Slow down.

RENAI

Josh, where's the box of my lamps?

JOSH

I don't know. They should be here.

We packed them up.

RENAI

Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.

15.

JOSH

I remember the movers bringing them

in and putting them right there.

RENAI

(PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)

Well, they're not here. I would

know, I've been unpacking this

stuff all day.

16.

RENAI

Dalton? Where are you?

RENAI

Dalton?

JOSH

What happened?

DALTON

I fell.

RENAI

Dalton, you have to be careful. You

shouldn't be coming down here in

the dark.

JOSH

Where do you hurt the most?

DALTON

My knee and my head. I can't stand

up.

JOSH

You scared us, champ.

17.

JOSH

You're lucky you don't need stitches.

RENAI

If I catch you falling down the

stairs again I'm gonna break your

neck.

DALTON

That doesn't make sense.

DALTON (CONT'D)

You might be a superhero but you're

not invincible. Be more careful, bud.

RENAI

Sleep tight, honey.

JOSH

We've gotta lock that door.

RENAI

He's such a boy. He goes off

exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep

him on one of those child leashes.

JOSH

Why bother with a child leash? I'll

stop at the pet store tomorrow.

18.

RENAI

I'm sorry I was pissy when you got

home. I was trying to work on a

song today and then Cali woke up

and wouldn't stop crying...

JOSH

I didn't even notice.

RENAI

I feel guilty for wanting my own

time.

JOSH

It's normal to want your own time.

RENAI

Is it? My mother gave up everything

for me. I keep waiting for the

completely selfless parent gene to

kick in, but I'm exactly the same

person I was when I was 22, only

now I'm married with kids.

JOSH

You're a great mother.

RENAI

No, I'm not. They like you so much

better than me.

JOSH

That's not true.

RENAI

You're the cool dad who comes home

with presents and I'm the one who

yells at them all day.

JOSH

Now you're being crazy. They love

you. At least you get to connect

with them. I work so much.

RENAI

Believe me, you're their hero. They

try to play us off against each

other. They're master manipulators.

I guess they really are my kids.

19.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Is this it, Josh?

JOSH

Is this so bad?

RENAI

Thank you for letting me take some time

off to work on my music again.

JOSH

We'll get by. I want you to do it.

RENAI

There's a couple of songs...I mean

not all of them, but there's a

couple of them that I think are

really good. And I think, maybe I

could do something with them.

JOSH

I love all your songs.

20.

RENAI

Foster, sit down honey.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go

wake up Dalton?

JOSH

Time to get up, my man. Come on.

JOSH (CONT'D)

You're making me look bad here.

Outta bed before your mother comes

in and kills both of us.

21.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Dalton, get up. You've gotta get

ready for school.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Dalton...?

JOSH (CONT'D)

Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!

DR. SERCARZ

Okay...as of yet, our tests have

not drawn any conclusive answers

for you. Repeated blood and CSF

cultures are normal, making an

infective origin highly unlikely.

Tests for Lyme disease and repeated

polymerase chain reaction are

negative. Systemic vasculitis was

ruled out. Dalton remains in an

areactive coma without focal signs

or abnormal brainstem reflexes.

DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)

We've looked for bacterial

pathogens like Meningoencephalitis,

but haven't seen anything.

(MORE)

22.

DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)

I wouldn't say we've exhausted

every single angle...but we're

close. The underlying cause is

still unknown.

DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)

The good news is that he's

breathing without the use of a

mechanical apparatus, and there are

no lesions or hemorrhages in any of

the CT scans.

JOSH

So...there's no brain damage or...?

DR. SERCARZ

None that we've detected. Technically,

he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to

stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but

there's no brain trauma or infection. His

scans are normal. To be honest, I've

never seen anything like it.

JOSH

That fall he took...I mean, it looked

like he hit his head pretty hard.

DR. SERCARZ

We definitely exhausted that

possibility, but it was always

doubtful. The cut was superficial,

there wasn't even a skull fracture.

RENAI

He can't just not wake up...there's

got to be something...

DR. SERCARZ

I'm sorry.

JOSH

So what do we do now? Does he stay here?

DR. SERCARZ

We'll conduct some further testing, but

beyond that...I really don't know.

23.

DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)

Excuse me for a minute. I have to

step out. A nurse will be with you

in just a moment.

FADE TO BLACK.

ADELE

Are you having any more trouble

with the feeding tube?

RENAI

(BARELY AUDIBLE)

It's okay.

ADELE

Alright, well I'll be back soon.

I'll bring some new books. You're

probably sick of the ones you have.

RENAI

Did he respond to any of the tests?

ADELE

No...no, he didn't. But we have to

give it time. I've seen coma

patients with a much longer

inactivity time suddenly start

making noises.

24.

RENAI

He's not in a coma, remember? They

don't know what to call it. They

don't know what to do with him so

they've given up.

ADELE

No, they haven't. We're going to

figure it out.

25.

VOICE

(FROM MONITOR)

They see us...all of us...we have to be

quick...this life begs us to come back.

VOICE (CONT'D)

(FROM MONITOR)

NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

CALI

Dadda!

26.

JOSH

She said dad...

RENAI

What's this?

FOSTER

An award.

RENAI

That's today's date. You got this

today?

RENAI (CONT'D)

Why didn't you tell us, honey?

RENAI (CONT'D)

I know it's hard right now. But

things will get better. I promise.

RENAI (CONT'D)

I'm going to show this to your dad.

FOSTER

I'm scared, mom.

RENAI

Scared of what?

27.

FOSTER

Dalton.

RENAI

We're all scared. It's normal to be

scared for him. But we can't give up--

FOSTER

Why do I have to sleep so close to

him? Can't I change rooms?

RENAI

Why would you wanna change rooms?

FOSTER

I don't know.

RENAI

Your brother needs you. Goodnight

honey.

RENAI

Something happened today. I didn't

want to tell you in front of Foster.

JOSH

What?

RENAI

I heard something coming from

Cali's room. A man's voice. On the

baby monitor...it scared the hell

outta me. I went in there and no

one was there.

JOSH

Could it have been interference?

RENAI

I don't know. It was so clear. I

was sitting at the piano and I

heard this...whispering on the baby

monitor. So I held my ear up to it--

28.

JOSH

Who the hell is that?

JOSH (CONT'D)

Stay here.

JOSH

Hello? Who's there?

AND THEN--

29.

RENAI

Who was it, Josh?

JOSH

What did you say?

RENAI

There's someone in there!

RENAI (CONT'D)

There's someone in Cali's room!

JOSH

(TO RENAI)

Grab Cali and Foster!

30.

RENAI

Josh! The laundry!

SECURITY OFFICER

There's no one in there, it's all

clear. If someone was there, they're

gone now.

31.

RENAI

I saw somebody.

SECURITY OFFICER

Maybe it was a shadow...?

RENAI

No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a

man. He was tall, and he long,

greasy hair. He was wearing a grey

jacket. He looked right at me.

SECURITY OFFICER

Well, like I said...he's gone now.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Okay, face the front ladies and

gentlemen...come on...hold still...

(muttering to himself)

I'm trying to record the peak of

your pathetic lives here.

PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)

Mr. Lambert, would you like to step

in please?

JOSH

Uh...what?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Could you step in so that we can

take the photo? Quickly please.

JOSH

Just take it without me.

32.

PHOTOGRAPHER

We need you in the photo, sir.

JOSH

No, you don't. Just take the damn

photo without me, okay?

PHOTOGRAPHER

I can't believe this is my life.

(beat; to class)

Ready kids? Say asshole teacher!

ALANSO (O.S.)

I hear things.

JOSH

What?

ALANSO

I spend so much time in the office,

I hear things. I heard about your

son. I'm sorry.

JOSH

Thank you, Alanso.

ALANSO

Times like these...people realize

that science doesn't have all the

answers. There is a higher force at

work.

JOSH

I wish I had your belief. Things

would be a lot simpler.

ALANSO

Things are simple. You just can't

see it. Put your faith in Him.

33.

JOSH

(INTO PHONE)

Hey...I just found out I have to

stay back tonight and finish off

mid-term grades. It could be a

while, there's a lot to go through.

Don't wait up. Bye.

JOSH

The men all walked down to the

waters edge...and they stood there

and asked the beast to come forth.

And the beast roared back "No!". And

so they dived in after it...

KELLY

You okay?

34.

RENAI

Yeah.

KELLY

I was going to head off for an hour

or so. Are you alright here?

RENAI

Of course. Anything from Dalton?

KELLY

No. I'm sorry.

KELLY (CONT'D)

Keep providing him with stimuli. I've

seen it work time and time again.

Read to him. Even if you're doing

something else, you can play him

music that he likes. Don't give up.

RENAI

I won't, I just...I haven't slept

much the last couple of nights. I

feel like the universe is trying to

see how far I can bend before I

break.

KELLY

The universe picked a fight with

the wrong chick.

RENAI

Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.

KELLY

No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I

chose to be here. You didn't choose

any of this. You're the strong one.

35.

JOSH

What are you doing up?

RENAI

It's midnight, Josh.

JOSH

When did you start smoking?

RENAI

You've been coming home late every

single night. You've never had to

do that in all of the years you've

been at the school. Now all of a

sudden you have to stay back late?

JOSH

I don't like it either, but I'm

grading tests. What choice do I have?

We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.

RENAI

Your mother is paying Dalton's

bills, Josh. I know because she

reminds me every chance she gets.

36.

JOSH

Jesus, I can't win with you. That's

my son in there too, not just yours!

JOSH (CONT'D)

I've always felt like less than

good enough for you. I feel it

every time you mention our bills.

That subtle voice that says `can't

you get a job that pays more than a

teacher'? And now I can't even look

at you without feeling it.

RENAI

You're projecting that onto me.

You've written an entire story

about I'm how I'm feeling without

once asking me how I'm feeling.

JOSH

I don't need to ask. I know you.

RENAI

I am losing my mind here in this

house, Josh. I'm scared and I need

you and you're not here. Where are

you?

JOSH

I told you, I'm grading tests.

RENAI

I don't mean that. I mean you're

not here. With me. In this

situation. You're avoiding it, like

you do anything stressful, whether

it's this or a parking ticket.

JOSH

Christ, I should have stayed at the

school.

RENAI

There you go again.

37.

RENAI

Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...

38.

MAN

DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!

JOSH

What is it? What is it?!

JOSH (CONT'D)

Renai, what is wrong?!

RENAI

The man -- he was there -- he tried

to -- there was a man there!!!

JOSH

There's no one here.

RENAI

I saw somebody!

JOSH

There's no one here.

RENAI

Don't you dare not believe me!

JOSH

I believe you, okay? I just don't

know what you want me to do.

39.

RENAI

I want you to tell me that we can

leave this house. I will not spend

one more night here. I wanna leave,

I wanna go!

FOSTER

I don't want the man to get me.

JOSH

You're okay, buddy. I've got you.

RENAI

I'm sorry.

(BEAT)

I can't...I want to leave this

house. I can't be here anymore.

JOSH

To move now would be...we would

have to rent somewhere. It's not--

RENAI

Please, Josh.

FADE TO BLACK.

40.

RENAI

Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do

any of this. Sit down.

LORRAINE

Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of

putting a few things away. I did it

for Josh his whole life. He never

was good with tidying up.

RENAI

I know, but I just feel so bad.

LORRAINE

I think it's you who should be

sitting down by the looks of it.

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

I can't believe you got Josh to sit

still for a photo.

RENAI

I can't believe we're doing all this

again, that's what I can't believe.

(beat; looks at her)

I know you think I'm crazy.

LORRAINE

Nobody - not me, not anybody -

knows what you're going through

right now. Whatever you have to do

to get through it, do it. And never

apologize for it.

41.

RENAI

We just wanna say...thank you so

much. For helping us out with this,

doctor. We can't tell you how much

it means to have you involved.

DR. TRIMBLE

I'm glad to help.

(BEAT)

Unfortunately...these recent tests

have proven inconclusive. There's

absolutely nothing abnormal here.

JOSH

So...if you're the top of the food

chain with this stuff, where does

that leave us?

DR. TRIMBLE

I don't know. There is a research

team in Boston who specialize in a

new form of treatment. They try to

stimulate the patients brain with

electric pulses. It has a good

success rate with victims of brain

injury. We could try that.

RENAI

So there's hope?

DR. TRIMBLE

There are more things we can try.

(BEAT)

The hope part is up to you.

42.

TINY TIM (V.O.)

(FROM RECORD)

Tip-toe by the window, by the

window, that is where I'll be...

TINY TIM

(FROM RECORD)

Oh tip-toe, from the garden, by the

garden, of the willow tree...

43.

THEN

SHE

HEARS

RENAI

Oh my God, Dalton...no...

44.

BA G

NED

Josh...didn't see you there.

JOSH

Sorry to scare you.

NED

What are you up to this late?

JOSH

Where did all the bartenders who

listen to your troubles go, Ned?

45.

NED

Never drink alone. If you take the

dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all

you're left with is the self loathing.

JOSH

I don't need whisky for that.

NED

Bah. You people think too much.

Used to be, if life threw a

shitstorm at you, you'd grab the

nearest umbrella. Your generation

would spend a day googling what

brand to buy.

JOSH

I probably would too.

(beat; takes a drink)

It's funny, I've always known I was

the type of person that things

didn't happen to. I made peace with

it. I thought to myself, it's okay -

I'll never win the lottery or climb

Mount Everest...but I'll never get

a rare tropical blood disease

either. It works out.

(BEAT)

Now I'm the guy whose son is in a

mysterious coma.

NED

Things happen to everybody. Even to

good people like you. And they're

gonna keep happening the older you

get, believe me. No use sittin' in

the dark drinkin' over it. Go home.

Be with your wife. Tell her your

what's on your mind.

NED (CONT'D)

There sure as hell isn't any

umbrellas `round here.

46.

JOSH

This is the first line of a joke.

Guy comes home to find his wife

with a priest...

RENAI

Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A

very old friend of mine.

FATHER NATHANSON

Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot

about you.

JOSH

Can't say I've heard the same,

Liam. At least I know you're not

sleeping with her.

LORRAINE (O.S.)

Don't be rude, Josh.

JOSH

What is going on here?

FATHER NATHANSON

I should be going. Thank you so much

for the tea.

RENAI

Thanks, Liam.

JOSH

Okay, would anyone mind telling me

what the hell is going on here?

47.

LORRAINE

JOSH

LORRAINE

JOSH

LORRAINE

JOSH

RENAI

JOSH

RENAI

(TO LORRAINE)

JOSH

RENAI

LORRAINE

48.

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

Go on, Renai. Tell him.

RENAI

This...thing that was in the other

house. It followed us.

LORRAINE

Let her speak.

RENAI

I saw someone again today. In the

house. It looked like a young boy.

I followed it into Dalton's room...

but it wasn't a child.

(BEAT)

This thing is here. I know it.

JOSH

So...what? You called in a priest

to get rid of it?

RENAI

I didn't know what else to do.

JOSH

Are you kidding me?

(TO LORRAINE)

Was this your idea?

RENAI

No. It was mine.

JOSH

You've never been to a church in

your life. Now you're inviting a

priest into our home? I feel like I

don't even know you right now.

RENAI

I'm scared.

JOSH

This is a fantasy, and you need a

therapist, not a member of the

clergy.

RENAI

(TO LORRAINE)

I told you...

49.

LORRAINE

What's happening to Renai is real.

I've seen it for myself.

(BEAT)

I came here today because last night

I had a dream about this place.

LORRAINE (V.O.)

I was in this house...but it was

late at night.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I tried to be quiet. I didn't want

to wake anybody. I was afraid.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I looked into your bedroom. You

were both asleep.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I knew that I was asleep in the

dream...but I could feel that

someone was awake in the house.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I went into Dalton's room.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

There was someone in there with him.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

A man was standing in the corner of

the room.

(MORE)

50.

LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I asked him who he was...he said he

was a visitor. I asked him what he

wanted...he said Dalton.

LORRAINE

I can still hear that voice.

JOSH

What is it?

LORRAINE

He's here.

RENAI

Help us...

JOSH

I don't know how.

LORRAINE

I know somebody who can help...if

you're willing to ask for it.

51.

SPECS

So you must be Josh?

JOSH

Yeah.

SPECS

That wasn't psychic. Lorraine told

me your name.

JOSH

Oh.

SPECS

I'm Specs.

(beat; spooky voice)

I'm here to solve your problem. I'm

just kidding with the voice. We

take this very seriously.

RENAI

So is Elise coming or...?

SPECS

She won't be joining us yet. Usually

we handle all the background stuff,

then she gets involved when we have

the facts.

TUCKER

Helps weed out the nutjobs.

RENAI

Okay...

JOSH

This is a little uncomfortable.

Speaking for myself. I'm not used

to this kind of stuff.

SPECS

We understand completely. Ninety

six per cent of the people we deal

with have had no experience with

this type of phenomena before.

52.

SPECS (CONT'D)

I would like to start by

interviewing you both. Can we

record your answers?

RENAI

Ah...sure.

SPECS

My assistant will check different

areas of the house for electrical

anomalies. I'll get him started.

Tucker, would you follow me?

TUCKER

Assistant?

SPECS

Could you not eat that in front of

the clients?

TUCKER

Assistant?

SPECS

Finish it in here. This industry

gets laughed at enough as it is.

SPECS

Do you or any of your children

suffer from epilepsy or autism?

RENAI

No. I mean, our son...

SPECS

Right. I heard about this from

Lorraine. He is in a coma, the

cause of which is unknown?

RENAI

Yes.

53.

SPECS

Do either of you habitually use

drugs or alcohol?

RENAI

No.

SPECS

No drugs at all?

RENAI

I take anti-depressants sometimes.

SPECS

Do you have a history of clinical

depression?

RENAI

Not a history. I've had bouts of

it. In the past.

SPECS

Tucker, could you check the camera?

TUCKER (O.S.)

I'm still assisting in the other room.

SPECS

Whenever you're ready then.

TUCKER

(to Renai and Josh)

He handles administration, I handle

technical. It's an even split. He

couldn't change a light bulb and I'm

no good with paperwork. It bores me

senseless.

SPECS

Do you have any history of sexual

abuse in the family?

JOSH

No.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry, I have to ask how this

relates to our problem?

54.

SPECS

Nine times out of ten, when someone

comes to us with a problem like

this, it's because of an inward

cause within the family unit...not

a physical force outside of it.

JOSH

What is that?

TUCKER

Tri-field meter. It measures DC

fields and the natural electro

magnetic environment.

SPECS

Sometimes old wiring can leak into

the atmosphere. It can cause

hallucinations, changes in energy.

TUCKER

Yeah. It's a little more

complicated than that, but, you

know, you get the general idea.

SPECS

It's basically that.

TUCKER

Not really, but whatever.

SPECS

(TO JOSH)

The tech stuff's not relevant to

you anyway.

TUCKER

It's very relevant, but it's all

good.

55.

SPECS

Epilepsy in one of the children

mostly. It's very common. If we

approach things academically, it

lets us find the genuinely

interesting cases.

TUCKER

I think we can call Elise now...

JOSH

Mrs. Rainier?

ELISE

No, my mother couldn't come, it's

just me. Elise. You must be

Lorraine's son? You've grown since

I last saw you.

JOSH

Last saw me?

ELISE

Your mother and I have been friends

for a long time.

56.

ELISE (CONT'D)

(re Specs and Tucker)

They're very good assistants but I

can't get them to dress any better.

RENAI

Hi. I'm Renai.

ELISE

Pleased to meet you. I'm Elise.

TUCKER

We took Tri-field and EMF readings of

the whole house. All the wiring,

alarm clocks, radios, toasters, TV,

record player, fuse box. Nothing went

off the charts.

ELISE

And the previous home?

SPECS

Tucker hadn't monitored that yet. I

could jump on that this afternoon

if you like? Make up for lost time.

TUCKER

Yeah, but who would work the

equipment? I'll need to be there.

You know what, don't even sweat it.

I'll make myself available.

ELISE

No, that's fine, gentlemen.

ELISE (CONT'D)

I don't think bad wiring is the

problem here.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Hmm.

57.

ELISE (CONT'D)

May I walk through the house?

RENAI

Yes. Of course.

ELISE

Steven, do you have your sketchbook?

SPECS

Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, yes. I

do.

ELISE

Good. We're going to need it.

RENAI

What is it for?

SPECS

She tells me what she sees and I

draw it. It's the most important

part of her process.

TUCKER

His drawings and my photos comprise

her visual records.

SPECS

Especially the drawings.

TUCKER

That's debatable.

SPECS

It's not debatable.

TUCKER

It is, but whatever.

SPECS

Onwards and upwards. Find me a ghost.

58.

RENAI

What is it?

ELISE

There is something here.

TUCKER

This is where I saw it.

ELISE

...long hair...grey dress...her

eyes are...

ELISE (CONT'D)

Do I have permission to enter this

room?

JOSH

Go ahead.

ELISE

Maybe you could wait back there?

59.

ELISE

Leave the lights off.

SHOULD

BE

ABSOLUTE

RENAI

What is it? What do you see?

RENAI (CONT'D)

What do you see?!

RENAI (CONT'D)

Tell me!

60.

ELISE

I'm not sure if you are ready to

hear this yet...but unfortunately I

can't waste any time easing you

into it. There is no time left.

ELISE (CONT'D)

I want you to know that this is

what I believe and it may

contradict a previous medical

diagnosis. However, you called me

here and I am taking that as an

acceptance of my readings.

RENAI

Go on.

ELISE

Your son...is not in a coma. His

physical body is here, but his

spiritual body is not.

(BEAT)

The reason these disturbances

followed you to a new home is

because...it is not the house that

is haunted. It is your son.

RENAI

I don't understand...

61.

ELISE

Have you ever heard of astral

projection?

RENAI

Out of body experiences?

ELISE

I call them travellers. These are

people with the ability to leave

their physical body and travel to

different places in an astral form.

To some degree, we all have the

ability to do it...but most of us

subconsciously suppress it or don't

know how to access it.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Dalton is...a very accomplished

astral projector. He has been since

he was very young. He's not afraid

of his ability. And that lack of

fear has led him to travel too far

and become lost...

RENAI

Lost? Lost where?

ELISE

In The Further.

RENAI

What do you mean?

ELISE

The Further is that place beyond our

perception, beyond our understanding

of the physical world that we can see

and touch. It is a place without

clocks or measurements, without past

or future...an infinite realm that

holds all of our dreams...and all of

our nightmares.

62.

ELISE (CONT'D)

That is where Dalton is.

ELISE (CONT'D)

The problem is that with his astral

body gone, he has left a physical

body with us. An empty vessel.

ELISE (CONT'D)

And there are entities that know

this. They can smell it - the

chance to live again. That is why

they have gathered around him.

RENAI

How many are there?

ELISE

There are five benevolent spirits.

Five different entities for whom

Dalton has become a most prized

possession. They are trying to get

inside his physical body...and they

get closer with each passing day.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Then there are two entities who

are...not benevolent. One of them

takes the form of a man, the

other...

ELISE (CONT'D)

They work together, so desperate

are they to possess Dalton. They

are the closest of all the entities

to getting inside him.

(BEAT)

I don't want to scare you, but I

have never, in all my years of

doing this, experienced anything as

terrifying as their presence.

RENAI

Is there a way to bring Dalton back?

63.

ELISE

There is something we could try. A

way of calling him back. I would

need your complete trust.

JOSH

No. No. This has gone too far.

RENAI

You said that you'd give her a chance!

JOSH

I have given her a chance, and I

did that because I wanted to help

you. But I cannot have somebody

telling us that the reason our son

is in a coma is because his soul is

floating off somewhere in another

dimension.

ELISE

I know this is hard to hear.

JOSH

No, it's not fair is what it is.

You're preying on people's grief and

vulnerability, which is really easy

to do in a situation like this.

RENAI

Why did we go to all the trouble of

bringing them here if you're just

going to reject what they say?

JOSH

Because I wanted to help you. To

put your mind at ease, and if this

helped, then great. But to drag

Dalton into this? No.

RENAI

Josh, you're not being fair...

JOSH

Fair? How did the voice of reason

become the bad guy here? Don't you

see? You want to believe. Of course

you do, honey, anybody would.

64.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Look, I appreciate what you're

trying to do. I really do. But I

think it's dangerous to start

throwing out false hope like this.

I have to put my foot down. My wife

is not...mentally well at the

moment, and I have to keep at least

one of her feet here in the real

world.

RENAI

You never believed me...

JOSH

Honey, I'm on your side. But I

genuinely think this is dangerous

and frankly, a little exploitative.

JOSH (CONT'D)

You come into a home with a

seriously ill child, you make a

tenuous connection between him and

these experiences Renai is having

and viola - the client starts

crying because they're desperate to

believe, the tears validate your

power, thank you, that'll be six

hundred dollars please.

SPECS

We reject more cases than we take.

We're not out for money, sir.

JOSH

I know, I know...look, I appreciate

your interest and your time. I do.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

ELISE

I completely understand. And I

honestly don't blame you for

reacting like this.

RENAI

No, please...don't go.

65.

ELISE

Thank you for your time.

JOSH

Look at me for a second, honey.

(BEAT)

Look at me.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Did you really believe what she

said? In your heart of hearts, did

you actually take what she was

saying literally?

RENAI

I don't know...

JOSH

Do you think I don't want to

believe in that stuff? Of course I

do. It would make life a lot easier

if I did. If I believed that some

supernatural force was responsible

for what's happened to our son...

RENAI

I don't believe anything anymore,

Josh. I used to. I used to believe

that I could keep my children safe.

I used to believe everything would

be okay. To believe in something,

you have to know it to be true.

RENAI (CONT'D)

The things that have happened to me

haven't confirmed any beliefs -

they've done the opposite. They've

made me question what I believe.

(MORE)

66.

RENAI (CONT'D)

They've made me realize that maybe

we don't know as much as we think

we do.

RENAI (CONT'D)

You ask me if I believe what she

said to be true and the answer is I

don't know. But let me ask you this

- in your heart of hearts, can you

say for certain that it isn't?

JOSH

Where are you? Where did you go?

(BEAT)

Can you hear me? I'm begging you to

show me that you can hear me...I

don't know how to help you. Please

tell me what to do.

67.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Please God, please help me...give

me my son back. I will do anything

just to have him back.

JOSH (CONT'D)

I need him back. I need him to show

me that he can hear me. Please...

68.

JOSH

Okay.

ELISE

What's most important is that you

realize no two attempts are the

same. I will be completely honest

with you about the results, and if

no dialogue is established, I will

tell you. I am not in the business

of embellishing success. What

happens, happens.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Forget the limits and laws and logic

of this world. We are treading in a

different place now.

69.

TUCKER

These still cameras are rigged to

pick up changes in the atmosphere,

electrical or temperature-wise. Don't

be alarmed if they go off.

ELISE

Everything I say while I am in tune

will be at a very low volume, so

you won't hear any of it. Steven

will write it down and repeat it

for you.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Hold on to each other, and stay

focused. You'll see things you

don't understand. Confusing things.

Do not question them or speak in

any way.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Dim the lights please.

70.

SPECS

We are calling out to you Dalton.

SPECS (CONT'D)

Tell us that you are safe. Tell us

where you are.

SPECS (CONT'D)

Who's there?

SPECS (CONT'D)

It is your mother and father. We

have been looking for you.

Follow my voice Dalton. Come back

Why aren't you talking anymore

Dalton?

If they hear me, they'll hurt me.

who will hurt you?

SPECS (CONT'D)

Who will hurt you?

SPECS (CONT'D)

The man with fire on his face.

Can you find your way back to us?

There is no way out.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Dalton! Dalton!

SPECS

I feel like a mountain climber

who's been waiting his whole life

to climb Everest, and now that I'm

standing on the summit, I don't

know what to do with myself...

TUCKER

I'll tell you what we do with

ourselves. We make a short list of

our preferred media outlets, that's

what.

TUCKER (CONT'D)

Watch this.

SPECS

Oh my God...

TUCKER

After all the years we've been

dining out on morsels like a faucet

that turns itself on and off...we

finally have some empirical

evidence of the real thing. Proof.

76.

ELISE

Proof? Proof of what? Nine tenths

of the world believes that when you

die, your soul ascends to sit with

God. Would you be telling them

something they didn't already know?

TUCKER

That is so not the point. This is not

about religion. Here we have

irrefutable evidence of a paranormal

experience. Our job is to share it.

ELISE

No, our job is not to alert the press

and prove the existence of the

`paranormal', as you call it. I'm not

out to prove anything. I've known

there was a higher plane ever since I

was a little girl and I could play

hopscotch with people whose names

were inscribed on tombstones. What

you call paranormal is a fact of life

for me.

(BEAT)

Our job is to help people. The

least we can do is spare them the

indignity of Sixty Minutes.

TUCKER

Yeah, until they get their book

deal...then you'll wish you'd listened.

ELISE

No, I won't, Tucker. I'll just be

proud of you. You two stared down

something that would crush most

mortals tonight and you stood tall.

SPECS

So what do we do now?

ELISE

We answer the door.

SPECS

What do you mean?

77.

JOSH

Mom...what are you doing here?

ELISE

I asked your mother to come over. I

called her immediately after...the

session. I told her to hurry over.

JOSH

Why?

ELISE

There is something we must talk

about. Sit down, Lorraine.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Go on. Tell him.

JOSH

Tell me what?

LORRAINE

The reason...I knew to call Elise

in this situation...the reason I

know her so well...is because I

called her myself once. Years ago.

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

To help you, Josh.

JOSH

What are you talking about?

78.

ELISE

It's no accident that your son is

such a gifted traveller. The

ability was handed down to him.

(BEAT)

By his father.

FLASHCUT TO:

FLASHCUT TO:

JOSH

No...I've never...done that before.

LORRAINE

When you were about eight...you

suffered night terrors. Awful fits

of pure fear. You were terrified of

an old woman who you said would

come to visit you at night.

FLASHCUT TO:

79.

OLD WOMAN

Let me in.

FLASHCUT TO:

LORRAINE

I dismissed your stories. Told you

to grow up.

(BEAT)

Then I saw her for myself.

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

At first, I thought it was a camera

problem. Then I saw her again.

80.

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

In each photo, she got closer and

closer to you...

LORRAINE (CONT'D)

Finally, I was so scared, I called

Elise.

JOSH

I don't...I don't remember any of

this...

ELISE

You've blocked it out.

(BEAT)

But in the back of your mind,

you're still afraid of having your

picture taken, aren't you?

LORRAINE

I've kept the photos hidden ever

since then...until tonight.

ELISE

I advised Lorraine to hide them. To

stop taking your picture. And to

let you forget.

JOSH

Who is she?

ELISE

A parasite. She befriended your

astral body, then drew you out into

The Further, just as Dalton has

been drawn out.

(MORE)

81.

ELISE (CONT'D)

But she deceived you. All she

wanted was an empty vessel. A

physical body. Yours.

LORRAINE

I'm sorry, Josh.

ELISE

I didn't want to make you remember

this...I only do it for the sake of

your son.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Your son is out there.

(BEAT)

And you are the only one who can

bring him back.

JOSH

How long do we have before...that

thing...takes him over completely?

ELISE

If you cannot reach him tonight,

then he is gone forever.

ELISE

Remember who you are and why you

are traveling. Keep one foot in

this world.

(BEAT)

Are you ready?

82.

RENAI

I want you to know something...you

have never been less than good

enough for me. You've always been

perfect for me. You're my best

friend...my soulmate. I love you so

much.

JOSH

I love you too. I have since the

first time you looked at me. I

don't exist without you.

ELISE

Close your eyes, Josh...and relax.

Breathe deeply. Let all life around you

fade out into the background...until

the only thing you can hear is the

ticking of the metronome.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Focus on a spot in the center of

your forehead. Feel that spot

getting further away as you drift

off to sleep.

ELISE (CONT'D)

I want you to relax your physical

body and let the astral body gain

strength...feel it rising out of

your chest.

ELISE (CONT'D)

Detach yourself.

83.

JOSH

This is useless...I have no idea

what I'm doing and you just

suddenly expect me to...

ELISE

(SOFTLY)

Now you are free.

(BEAT)

Keep your guide, and a steady

stride...and into The Further you

go.

84.

I'm taking you back.

JOSH (CONT'D)

What is it?

93.

DALTON

Help me, dad...take this off me...

JOSH

You're not really here. You're

asleep in your bed in our home.

Just stand up.

DALTON

He's going to hurt me again...

JOSH

This isn't real. You can do this.

DALTON

He's coming!

JOSH

Just stand up!

He's found your son.

RENAI

What happens now?

ELISE

We need them to come back. We need

him to find us.

JOSH

I want to get out!

JOSH

Call out to him!

DALTON

Listen!

Follow my voice. Come back to us.

Put me down, I can run!

DALTON (CONT'D)

Come on, dad! Come on!

JOSH

Go! I'm right behind you!

JOSH (CONT'D)

You...what do you want from me?

JOSH (CONT'D)

Get the fuck away from me! I'm not

scared of you, just leave me alone!

Get away from me!

Find us!

ELISE

Check on the boy!

He's awake!

Find me, Josh! Now! Wake up!

RENAI

Josh? Josh?

JOSH

Dalton...?

RENAI

I don't know what to say...

ELISE

Well put.

JOSH

Now this is worth dying for.

TUCKER

I guess you did some pretty awesome

stuff in there. You deserve some

credit.

SPECS

You did good too in an assistant-

type way.

TUCKER

Thanks, boss.

TUCKER (CONT'D)

Dude, I got some amazing shots. We

are gonna write a book and my shots

are gonna be the main selling point.

SPECS

Yeah.

(BEAT)

Not the main selling point, but

definitely important, for sure.

101.

DALTON

I'm tired.

RENAI

Too bad. I'm never letting you go

to sleep again.

RENAI (CONT'D)

Did you know we'd come and find you?

RENAI (CONT'D)

Whenever you're lost...we'll always

come and find you.

JOSH

You introduced me to a new world.

ELISE

No. You've been there before,

remember? And you'll go back.

(BEAT)

All of us will...eventually.

JOSH

Maybe I can forget again.

JOSH (CONT'D)

I'll start by giving these back.

102.

JOSH (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

ELISE

Nothing, I...

JOSH

What's the matter, Elise?

JOSH (CONT'D)

Why the fuck would you do that? Why

would you do that? Why?!

JOSH (CONT'D)

You of all people! You know! Why

would you do that to me when you

know what you know? You bitch!

103.

RENAI

What was that?

(beat; to Dalton)

Stay here.

RENAI

Elise, what was that noise?

RENAI (CONT'D)

Jesus...what happened to you?

Where's Josh?

Josh? Josh?!

Elise, what happened? You're

scaring me, tell me where Josh is?

FLASHCUT TO:

JOSH

You introduced me to a new world.

ELISE

No. You've been there before,

remember? And you'll go back.

(BEAT)

All of us will...eventually.

JOSH

Maybe I can forget again.

JOSH (CONT'D)

I'll start by giving these back.

JOSH (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

ELISE

Nothing, I...

JOSH

What's the matter, Elise?

DALTON

Put me down, I can run!

DALTON (CONT'D)

Come on, dad! Come on!

JOSH

Go! I'm right behind you!

JOSH (CONT'D)

You...what do you want from me?

JOSH

Get away the fuck away from me. I'm

not scared of you, just leave me

alone! Get away from me!

FADE OUT.
