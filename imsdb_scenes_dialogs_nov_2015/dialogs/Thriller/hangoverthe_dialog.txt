THE HANGOVER

MR. TURNER

Any word from Doug?

TRACY

No, but I'm sure he's--

TRACY (CONT'D)

Hello?

INTERCUT WITH:

VICK

Tracy, it's Vick.

2.

TRACY

Hey Vick!

VICK

Listen, honey...The bachelor party

got a little out of control and,

well...we lost Doug.

TRACY

(her jaw dropping)

What?! But we're getting married in

like four hours!

VICK

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STU

Dude this is already the best

weekend ever!

VICK

Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.

3.

STU

Oh, did I show you pictures of my

kids?!

DOUG

No, dude, show `em.

STU

Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is

already four! Can you believe it?!

DOUG

(smiling at photos)

How cute... Good for you, man.

VICK

The one on the left is gonna be a

hottie. The other one, not so much.

STU

Jesus, dude, those are my children--

ALAN

(re: sunscreen)

Hey, am I rubbed in?

STU

Yeah, you're good.

DOUG

Hey so Alan, are you and Becky

still together?

VICK

Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,

Alan's been dating Becky for 14

years. When they first met, Alan

had braces and soccer hair, and

Becky had a functioning hymen.

(MORE)

4.

VICK (CONT'D)

Asking Alan if he's still with

Becky is like asking the sun if it

still rises in the east.

DOUG

She still pressuring you to get

married?

ALAN

Enh, we've moved past the pressure

stage...it's more like aggravated

assault stage now? Like at the last

wedding we went to, she threw a

camera at my head, called me a

closet fag, then ran out crying.

ALAN (CONT'D)

But we talked, and everything's

cool now.

STU

Maybe you could wear a helmet to

Doug's wedding.

ALAN

Great idea, Stu. Thanks.

DOUG

(LAUGHING)

So Vick, how's business going?

VICK

Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on

bringing the next big dessert craze

to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.

DOUG

What is it?

VICK

Bavarian custard. We ran the

numbers, and it's gonna be bigger

than fro yo.

ALAN

Isn't custard like a trillion

calories--?

5.

VICK

Our plan is to open three stores in

the Valley and then franchise it.

Shares are selling fast, but I can

probably squeeze you guys in...

DOUG

Yeah, man, count me in.

STU

Me too, man! I love pudding!

ALAN

Is this gonna do better than the

hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or

the topless sushi bar? Or the

mobile tattoo parlor--?

VICK

Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of

it's time, Alan! And don't come

crying to me when there's a Custard

Cabana on every street corner in

America and you didn't buy in--!

DOUG

(LAUGHING)

All right, all right, save it for

the party...

STU

Dude! I can't believe I get to

party all night, and then, tomorrow

...I get to sleep in! It's almost

too much! And FYI, if anyone gets

really drunk and craps themself,

just let me know, I can have you

cleaned up and partying again in

under three minutes. No joke. I am

a master of stool removal...

CUT TO:

6.

FRONT DESK MAN

Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.

VICK

Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.

FRONT DESK MAN

Yes, we have you down for a one

night stay in an economy suite--

VICK

Hold it right there, Atashir. This

is my best friend from childhood,

Douglas Billings. In two days, he

is to marry a woman of great beauty

and strong teeth, do you

understand? A woman of gigantic

bosoms who will give him many, many

sons...

7.

VICK (CONT'D)

My two other childhood friends have

travelled great distances, across

many deserts, to be here. This

isn't a night in a hotel for us,

Atashir: this is a family reunion.

Perhaps you too have family

situated great distances away, in a

foreign country with much sand?

VICK (CONT'D)

Then I have but one question for

you, friend: if they came to town,

would you put them in an economy

suite?

ATASHIR

No, sir.

VICK

Well, then. I think one of us needs

to get back on his little computer

and find us a suitable room.

ATASHIR

All the deluxe rooms are taken. The

Dean Martin suite is available, but

I'd have to ask my--

VICK

Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case

of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,

four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of

skinless mangos...

VICK (CONT'D)

You guys want anything?

VICK (CONT'D)

And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen

of those duck skewers I like so

well. He knows the ones.

ATASHIR

And how would you like to pay?

8.

VICK

American Express.

VICK (CONT'D)

Dude, give him your AmEx.

ALAN

What?

VICK

Don't worry, we'll hit you later.

VICK (CONT'D)

Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop

being such a Jew.

CUT TO:

STU

This is bigger than my house.

VICK

Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels

up in ten.

ALAN

I am so not getting paid back.

VICK

This is Vick.

9.

VICK (CONT'D)

He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!

(WINCING)

All right, I'll get it. All right.

All right--!

VICK (CONT'D)

I said all right, dude! How many

more times you want me to say all

right?!

(BEAT)

All right. All right.

ALAN

So, you ready for Sunday?

DOUG

Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but

I'm actually just really psyched.

ALAN

Tracy's dad still hate you?

DOUG

Oh yeah.

ALAN

Any closer to figuring out why?

DOUG

Enh, I think he wanted more for his

girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who

makes 45 grand a year, and he's a

titan of industry who makes 45

grand a day, you know? I sort of

get it...

(beat, brushing teeth)

Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm

not sure you ever get past that.

10.

DOUG (CONT'D)

You got floss?

DOUG (CONT'D)

Holy Christ!

ALAN

Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell

anyone about that--

STU

Anyone got any nipple lube--?

(seeing ring)

Jesus would you look at the size of

that thing?!

DOUG

It's Alan's. For Becky.

STU

Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?

ALAN

(clutching for ring)

Actually, I-I was trying to keep it

a secret, so--

VICK

Boy Party in the bathrooooom--!

(sees ring, snags it)

Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight

pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.

STU

Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's

finally going to propose!

11.

VICK

Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good

for you! Where'd you get the ring?

ALAN

Oh, it's a family heirloom. My

grandmother smuggled it through the

Holocaust, actually. I was going to

propose to Beck this weekend.

DOUG

Well: now we have two things to

celebrate!

CUT TO:

STU

Thish is so great! I love you guys!

VICK

Check it out, Stu's already wasted.

ALAN

We've only had two shots, man!

DOUG

Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You

used to be able to drink us all

under the table!

STU

Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time

to get plastered anymore! It blows!

(QUICKLY)

Am I a bad dad for saying that?

12.

DOUG

What? No!

STU

Because my dad was a bad dad.

DOUG

(patting his shoulder)

That's true, Stuey, but you're

different. We've talked about this.

STU

Have I showed you guys pictures of

my kids yet--?

ALAN & DOUG & VICK

YES!

DOUG

Little toast: to Tracy, the

coolest, kindest, most beautiful

woman I've ever met. I can't

believe she let me come this

weekend -- much less agreed to

spend the rest of her life with me.

I think both will prove to be

massive errors of judgement on her

part.

DOUG (CONT'D)

And to being here, with my best

friends in the world. There's

nowhere else I'd rather be.

DOUG (CONT'D)

That said, let's not get too stupid

tonight, okay? I'm getting married

in 36 hours.

ALAN & STU & VICK

No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,

dude.

13.

DOUG

I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above

the neck -- no piercings, no weird

haircuts, no facial tattoos. I

gotta look decent on Sunday.

VICK

Jesus, what do you take us for?

DOUG

Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows

off the night before graduation!

STU

Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And

remember when I blacked out at

Homecoming and you wrote on my face

with permanent marker?! That was

awesome! What'd you write again?

ALAN & DOUG & VICK

"Respect me!"

STU

Ahh, good times, man. Good times...

VICK

We'll be good tonight, Doug.

ALAN

Seriously, man, we're your friends.

STU

Yeah, we've totally grown up since

then.

DOUG

Well then...to a night we'll never

forget.

SMASH CUT TO:

14.

PILE OF NEWSPAPERS

OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!

VICK

Damn, dude, why are you retarded?

VICK (CONT'D)

Um, Stuey?

STU

Yo.

VICK

Why do you have a mullet?

STU

What?

15.

VICK

You know, business on top, party

down the back?

VICK (CONT'D)

Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.

STU (O.S.)

Dude...I have a mullet.

ALAN (O.S.)

Just give me ten more minutes,

Beck...

STU (O.S.)

Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?

STU (CONT'D)

Check it out: Alan slept in the

tub.

VICK

Get him up. I'm hungry.

ALAN (O.S.)

Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!

VICK

Jesus, dude, put away your sack.

16.

STU

Yeah, and it might be time for some

manscaping, bro. Your bush looks

like Yanni.

ALAN

What did we do last night?

CUT TO:

STU

Dude, why is my ass killing me...?

MAN

We'll...we'll get the next one.

VICK

We might not smell very good.

DISSOLVE TO:

STU

This might be the worst hangover

anyone has ever had, ever.

ALAN

I can't taste anything.

17.

VICK

Please stop talking. If I don't

focus on eating I'm going to throw

up all over myself.

ALAN

Hey... Are we missing something?

STU

Yes: I left my hat in the room --

thank you, Alan.

ALAN

No. That's not it... There's

something else...

VICK

You gonna finish that cruller?

ALAN

Doug. Guys, where's Doug?

STU

Yeah. He's not here.

VICK

Probably left him in the room.

VICK (CONT'D)

I'll call his cell.

STU

Good morning, this is Stu?

VICK

It's me, meatdick.

18.

STU

(to Alan, concerned)

It's Vick--

STU (CONT'D)

This is Doug's phone.

ALAN

You calling the room?

VICK

No answer.

ALAN

Ummm...shouldn't we look for him?

Check-out is in like ten minutes.

STU

Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have

Doug back to LA by five.

VICK

I'm eabing.

ALAN

What an asshole. Stu, check the

pool and the casino, I'll check the

room and the gym. Maybe he's

working out or something...

ALAN (CONT'D)

And Vick, if you could keep a close

eye on the buffet, that'd be really

helpful. Thanks, man.

VICK

HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!

19.

CUT TO:

ALAN

Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.

ALAN

That's weird...

CUT TO:

STU

No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's

totally cool...

CUT TO:

ALAN

I hate you all...

CUT TO:

STU

DOUG! DOUG!

20.

GAY MAN

Hey Stu.

STU

Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!

STU

You find Doug?

ALAN

No, I assume you didn't either?

ATASHIR

There is no Doug Billings at any of

the area hospitals, morgues, or

police stations.

STU

Maybe he went for a jog?

ALAN

Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.

STU

Or shopping?

ALAN

Great. So we've officially lost

Doug. His wedding is in what, 22

hours?

VICK

Relax, it's Doug, he's probably

crashed out on someone's couch

right now. All we have to do is

retrace our steps from last night,

and we'll find him.

21.

ALAN

Okay, so last night...

VICK

Well, we started on the roof...

ALAN

Right, that was like, 6ish...?

VICK

Then...I think...we had steaks at

the Palm?

ALAN

Yeah. Then...we played craps at the

Hard Rock...maybe?

VICK

That sounds right...

STU

Okay, honestly? I don't even

remember going to dinner.

VICK

I vaguely recall...doing body shots

....at some point? Is that...maybe?

ALAN

I'm pretty much blank after The

Hard Rock.

VICK

I think we went to the Flamingo

after that...? And then, I just

remember a lot of blue light...and

the overpowering smell of baby oil.

ALAN

So that was what, 10ish?

VICK

Give or take.

STU

Was Doug still with us?

22.

VICK

Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I

tackled him...for some reason.

ALAN

Okay. So we only have a 13 hour

window where we could've lost him.

STU

Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.

ALAN

ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--

(reading it)

For 600 dollars?!

VICK

The valet ticket says we returned

here at 4:57AM.

STU

We drove last night?

ALAN

Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The

meal was comped for some reason--

VICK

Why do we have a matchbook from The

Golden Pony All Male Revue?

ALAN

Someone could've given that to us.

23.

STU

(laughing, nervous)

Yeah, totally! There's no way we

went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!

ALAN

I think we should call Tracy.

VICK

Absolutely not.

ALAN

What if Doug called her? She might

know where he is.

STU

Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.

VICK

Of course you're with Alan, you're

both gutless cowards. But we're not

calling Tracy. You never call the

bride from the bachelor party.

Ever. If my balls were on fire and

Tracy was sitting next door with a

tall glass of water, I still

wouldn't call her. It's a rule.

ALAN

But shouldn't we at least tell her

we're gonna be getting home late?

VICK

She has a watch, she'll figure it

out.

ALAN

I think I'm beginning to see why

you're always single.

VICK

And I think I'm beginning to see

why you're always a douche--

STU

(clutching his ass)

Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh

my God -- like right now. Come on.

24.

ALAN

Jesus, what is it?

CUT TO:

VICK

I can't believe we're doing this.

STU

You don't have to look up my butt,

just at it. Something is terribly,

terribly wrong...

ALAN

Sweet mother of mercy...

VICK

Who's Roger?

STU

I-I-I don't know?! What do you

think it means?!

VICK

What do I think it means? Well,

Stuart, your ass is all torn up and

you're wearing thong underwear

declaring your love for another

dude -- I don't think we need the

CSI team for this one! You got

reamed last night, man!

ALAN

I'm sure there's a perfectly

logical explanation for this...

STU

Really?! What?!

25.

ALAN

Yeah, maybe there isn't.

VICK

Look, I'm sure Roger is a very

nice, considerate young man--

STU

Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!

VICK

Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near

cool enough.

STU

(gasping, realizing)

I do watch Dancing With The Stars

with the kids!

ALAN

Oh god, that doesn't mean you're

gay.

VICK

But sort of...it does?

STU

And once, I caught myself gazing at

a topless photo of David Beckham!

ALAN

So what, he's a great-looking dude--

STU

And then I had those weird feelings

for Vick that time in middle

school, remember?!

VICK

Um, what?

STU

Yeah, that weekend we were all

camping -- I told you this.

VICK

Yeah, no you didn't.

STU

I didn't?

26.

VICK

I think I'd remember, dude.

ALAN

Yeah, I think we'd all remember.

STU

Yeah. I had weird feelings for you

that weekend. Like really hot,

really gay feelings. But then they

went away.

ALAN

Wait -- I was there that weekend.

Did you have gay feelings for me?

VICK

Unbelievable.

ALAN

What?! I was a good-looking kid!

VICK

Please, you're so not his type!

STU

Wait, what?

VICK

Look, Stu, one homosexual

experience doesn't mean you're

permanently gay, okay? A lot of

guys test the waters.

ALAN

All right, we're scaring the

children. Let's go.

STU

Wait -- so have either of you

tested the waters?

VICK

No! We're not gay!

27.

STU

How am I going to tell my wife?

VICK

Quickly, and from a great distance.

STU

Jesus, what kind of father am I?

ALAN

Oh my God.

STU

(really scared)

You think Erin will try to take the

kids--?

ALAN

Oh...my...God.

VICK

(turning, annoyed)

What now?

STU

(not getting it)

Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna

have a field day with this.

VICK

Oh my God... Oh my God...

STU

What's the big--?

(finally realizing)

Oh! OH! OH!

28.

STU (CONT'D)

Maybe it's not a wedding ring?

ALAN

(reading inscription)

"To My Noble Husband, Alan."

STU

This is worse than my underwear!

VICK

"Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."

VICK (CONT'D)

Well, at least it's a lead.

CUT TO:

VICK

So, we go to the wedding chapel, we

find out what we did with Doug, we

recover him, and we're back in LA

before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.

STU

Check it out, some idiot threw his

bed out the window last night.

ALAN

That was us, dude.

29.

STU

Really?

ALAN

Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's

room.

STU

(FROWNING)

Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good

reason for doing it.

(BEAT)

You think they'll charge us for--?

ALAN

Yeah, Stu, I really do.

VICK

Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be

cool...

STU

You okay, Vick?

VICK

I'm not emotionally prepared to

talk about it just yet, Stuart, but

thank you.

DISSOLVE TO:

ALAN

Seriously: what am I gonna tell

Becky? For 14 years she's been

begging me to get married...

30.

VICK

Well, now you did. Just not to her.

ALAN

Wait, is that homeless guy wearing

Doug's shirt?

STU

Naaah.

VICK

Yeah, that was a different shirt.

VICK (CONT'D)

Left turn.

ALAN

What if they don't remember us--?

VOICE BEHIND THEM

AAAAYYYYY!

STEVE

How are you, you dumb bastards?!

31.

STEVE (CONT'D)

CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!

ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!

(to the guys)

You here to pick up your wedding

photos?!

VICK

Does the pope wear a funny hat?!

Let's do this thing!

STEVE

And where is Chastity today?

ALAN

W-Who's...Chastity?

STEVE

(LAUGHING)

Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just

breaking my balls!

VICK

Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony,

wasn't it?

STEVE

Hand to God, I've never seen two

people more in love!

VICK

Sadly, I believe you...

32.

VICK (CONT'D)

Hello, Chastity...

ALAN

I am never...ever...drinking again.

STU

Jesus, she is stacked.

VICK

Stu, please, show some class.

That's Alan's wife you're talking

about.

STU

(to Alan, guilty)

Sorry. She looks really nice.

ALAN

We got a unicorn?!

STEVE

Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double

Camelot Package.

ALAN

A-And how much did that cost?

STEVE

7 thousand dollars.

STEVE (CONT'D)

Yeah, you didn't want to get it,

either, but Vick insisted.

ALAN

I'm gonna kill you!

VICK

(fending him off)

You can't put a pricetag on love,

Alan! OW! You just can't!

33.

VOICE BEHIND THEM

STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!

CARLA

Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!

CARLA (CONT'D)

Good to see you, you stupid mooks!

VICK

It's good to be seen, Carla. It's

good to be seen.

CARLA

I brought the rest of your package.

CARLA (CONT'D)

First: Two dozen commuter mugs...

STU

No way! Awesome!

STEVE

A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...

VICK

For you and Chastity to watch on

your anniversary...

CARLA

The velvet wall hanging...

34.

VICK

And it looks like real velvet,

Alan, so no machine wash, okay?

CARLA

And the big finish:

STU

HOLY CRAP!

VICK

DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!

STU

I want a shield!

VICK

Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a

shield?

ALAN

I don't suppose you have any sort

of return policy, do you?

STEVE

Um...if you know another couple who

looks exactly like you guys, and

who want two dozen commuter mugs, a

wall hanging, and a shield...sure.

ALAN

What.

ALAN (CONT'D)

Oh, hey Becky! Hi!

VICK

That's his girlfriend of 14 years.

I'm sure this'll only take a

minute...

35.

BECKY

Can you tell me why all the goddamn

credit cards are maxed out?!

ALAN

No! I-I have no idea--!

VICK

HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR

BEST MAN, DUDE!

STU

YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!

WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!

BECKY

"Your best man?!" What's going on

there, Alan?!

ALAN

Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS

ARE JUST BEING DICKS!

VICK

HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-

SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I

BOGART A FEW?!

BECKY

I really don't appreciate being

mocked right now, Alan, especially

about wedding-related issues. You

know how hard this weekend is going

to be for me.

ALAN

I know, baby! I know--

36.

BECKY

So you'll call the credit card

company and straighten this out?

ALAN

Yes. I will. I promise.

BECKY

Okay. Okay...

(beat, calming)

Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll

see you soon, okay? Love you.

BECKY (CONT'D)

Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!

ALAN

Yes, no, I love you too!

STU

Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!

VICK

Yeah, did she ask about us?!

CUT TO:

STU

Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick

found a great clue.

VICK

Turns out Doug was in all the

wedding photos, which means -- if

the time stamp was right -- we had

him in our possession until 11 pm.

37.

STU

That's another hour of last night

that we can account for. Isn't that

great?

ALAN

(bitterly sarcastic)

Amazing.

VICK

Hey, Steve, you don't happen to

know where we were heading when we

left here last night, do you?

STEVE

Well, the Double Camelot Package

comes with a five course wedding

feast, so I assume you went there.

STU

Great -- where was the feast?

STEVE

Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.

CUT TO:

ALAN (V.O.)

I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!

VICK

Your negativity is like a little

black cloud over our car, Alan.

You've got to let go of this.

ALAN

Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The

fact that I married a complete

stranger last night? Or that my

girlfriend's about to leave me? Or

that I'm broke? Which one?!

VICK

You're broke? I thought you were

LOADED--

38.

ALAN

I know you think it's like

terminally uncool to be in a

committed relationship, Vick, but I

actually love Becky, okay?

(SINCERE)

I-I honestly don't know what I'd do

without her...I really don't...

VICK

Alan. Honey. Have you considered,

even for a second, that maybe the

things we do when we're drunk are

what we secretly want to do?

ALAN

(dripping with sarcasm)

Yeah, no, you're absolutely right,

Vick, I've always secretly wanted

to marry a bottle blonde with big

fake melon tits named Chastity!

STU

I ain't mad atcha, dude...

VICK

Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't

have the balls to leave Becky, and

this is your way of getting her to

leave you.

ALAN

I was going to propose to her this

weekend, you jackass!

VICK

All the more reason to freak out.

VICK (CONT'D)

I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but

you've always had a major pole up

your ass. Maybe last night was your

inner cool person trying to get out-

ALAN

I swear to God, Vick, if you say

one more word to me, I will destroy

you.

39.

STU

Guys, come on, let's not use our

angry words--

VICK

What the--?!

KALOLO FANALUA

Get out of the car, Vick.

STU

Who are these guys?!

VICK

Stu, please.

(to Kalolo Fanalua)

I think there's been some sort of

mistake, Mister...?

KALOLO FANALUA

I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get

The Hell Outta The Car, and this is

my associate, Mr. Smash You In The

Teeth If You Say Another Word.

VICK

(beat, to Alan)

Those so aren't their real names.

ALAN

Vick, don't be a dick--!

VICK

Alan? Relax. These men aren't going

to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.

KALOLO FANALUA

We're from Guam, bitch! Now get

outta the car!

40.

VICK

Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat!

Jesus, why is everyone trying to

kill my car...?

ALAN

Why'd you do that?!

VICK

(INCREDULOUS)

Really?

STU

Maybe they just wanted to talk!

VICK

I honestly don't know how you two

are still alive.

ALAN

Do you think we stole something

from them last night?!

STU

Oh my god I am such a bad dad!

ALAN

(producing cellphone)

I'm calling the police. This is

getting way out of control--

VICK

No! No cops!

ALAN

"No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty

Cent?!

41.

STU

Yeah, Vick, what's going on?

VICK

Nothing! I just think we should

focus on finding Doug and not get

distracted by every little thing!

ALAN

Every little thing?! We were just

assaulted by the Yakuza!

VICK

Oh please, those guys are from

Guam. Get a grip.

ALAN

They knew your name, Vick! Which

means they probably know who Stu

and I are, too!

STU

If anything ever happened to my

family, Vick...

VICK

Fine. Let's just go back to the

hotel -- Doug is probably back from

wherever he spent the night, we'll

get him, we'll straighten out

whatever we did to those angry

Samoans, then we'll get the hell

back to LA, okay? Left turn.

CUT TO:

VICK

Doug? Doug?

ALAN

No messages.

42.

STU

Come on, let's toss the place.

STU

Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested

30 grand in your custard store last

night!

VICK (O.S.)

Smart move, man.

STU

Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!

VICK

Whoa.

STU

You think she's what those Guamian

dudes wanted?

VICK

No. I think she's Alan's wife.

VICK (CONT'D)

Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?

VICK (CONT'D)

Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.

43.

ALAN

What...what am I supposed to do?

STU

Wake her up, man!

ALAN

Why me?!

VICK

Because she's your spouse, dude!

VICK (CONT'D)

Pinch her tit. It always works.

CHASTITY

Dang, did I sleep in the closet

again...?

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

Oh hey, guys! What's up?

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

Morning, honey...

STU

She seems really cool.

VICK

Yeah, I really like her, man.

44.

VICK

So, um, did you take Alan's name?

STU

Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish

now--?

ALAN

Listen to me. Just...did we, or did

we not, have sex last night?

CHASTITY

Well...ya?

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

But we waited til we were married.

VICK

What a responsible, upstanding

young Jew. They don't make `em like

that anymore, am I right?

CHASTITY

I know -- he even wanted to use a

rubber.

ALAN

Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!

CHASTITY

It's cool, I sponge.

ALAN

Can someone...please open a window?

45.

STU

They don't open.

CHASTITY

So you guys don't remember any of

last night?

VICK

Yeah, not so much.

CHASTITY

Hey, been there before, right?

(grabbing her sizable bra)

Sucks, though. The wedding was

really fun. I'm bummed you don't

remember it, Alan.

STU

Dude, I think your wife's mad at

you.

VICK

You don't happen to remember what

time we met you last night, do you?

CHASTITY

Sure, we met at the bar at like

10:00? Then we got married on my

smoke break, which was like 11:00?

VICK

It's the All-American love story,

isn't it? What happened next?

CHASTITY

Well, I had to go back to work. But

when I got off at 5:30, I met up

with you guys back here.

VICK

And was Doug with us then?

CHASTITY

No.

VICK

Interesting... Do you have any idea

where we went after the wedding?

46.

CHASTITY

No, but I bet some of my work

friends do. You were partying with

them pretty hard.

STU

Work friends?

SMASH CUT TO:

ALAN

You work here?

CHASTITY

Yeah -- and this is the pole where

we first met!

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

It's always been my lucky pole...

ALAN

Look, I don't know how to tell you

this, but--

CHASTITY

HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!

PLATINUM THE STRIPPER

Get it, girl!

CHASTITY

Come on, let's go meet my

bridesmaids!

47.

STU

Dude.

VICK

I know.

ALAN

The Holocaust, man.

VICK

Look, we can get your grandmother's

ring back. We just gotta go about

it in the right way.

ALAN

I have besmirched my people.

STU

Don't be so hard on yourself, dude--

CHASTITY

These were my bridesmaids,

Anastasia and Starr!

STARR

Hey, boys! Good to see you again!

ANASTASIA

Mazel Tov--!

ALAN

Please...don't.

STRIP CLUB D.J.

OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY

HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW

COUPLE, CHASTITY AND ALANNNN!

STRIPPER D.J.

IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE, WE'RE

DOING TWO-FOR-ONE LAPDANCES! TWO

SONGS FOR TWENTY BUCKS!

48.

CHASTITY

Oh my God, he's playing our song!

(giddy, to Alan)

This song was playing when we met,

remember?! You kept sliding

twenties into my thong and saying

"I will always love you. I will

always love you."

ALAN

Twenties?

CHASTITY

Yeah, it was so sweet...

ALAN

Look, I don't know how to say this,

but my friends and I were very

drunk last night. We would never

come to a place like this--

ALAN (CONT'D)

Guys?

CUT TO:

VICK

You are the best bridesmaids ever.

STU

(huge boobs in his face)

Dude: I might not be gay.

49.

ALAN

What the hell are you doing?!

VICK

Two-for-ones, man.

ALAN

We don't have time for this! We

gotta find Doug!

VICK

What do you think we're doing?

ALAN

What?

VICK

We're getting into the mindset of

last night, to see if it sparks any

memories.

(to his stripper)

Now: is this exactly how you were

dancing for me last night, Starr?

VICK (CONT'D)

Yeah, still no memories. Keep going

-- and put your back into it.

ALAN

You are so goddamn selfish, Vick.

You really are. Stu, let's go.

VICK

No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.

ALAN

Dude: Doug is missing! We have less

than 18 hours til his wedding! We

do not have time for this!

VICK

I'm trying to save your life here,

Alan Mervish.

ALAN

Vick--!

50.

VICK

I'm not kidding, man! Life is one

long series of emergencies, and if

you don't learn to stop and have a

little fun along the way, you're

gonna grow into a joyless old prick

like your dad. I'm sorry to bring

Moshe Mervish into it, but it had

to be said. Now yes, we have 18

hours to find Doug -- which means

we can afford to spend ten minutes

celebrating the special talents of

these gifted young body-artists. So

sit down, have a jager shot, and

smell the goddamn roses for once in

your miserable life. Chastity,

honey? When you're ready?

ALAN

No, look-- I am like totally

against this, morally and

politically. Plus Becky

specifically asked me not to--

SMASH CUT TO:

STU

I think I know why he married her.

VICK

Because if he hadn't, I would've.

STU

Is it weird that we're sitting this

close watching?

VICK

Not for me.

51.

STU

I really shouldn't be here. I have

daughters.

VICK

Not that can do that.

STU

How can she do that without

dislocating her hip?

VICK

Because she's been touched by God.

VICK (CONT'D)

Shit.

VICK (CONT'D)

Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!

ALAN

Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--

VICK

Come on, man! We got company!

VICK (CONT'D)

Chastity, honey, is there a back

way out of here?!

CHASTITY

Come on!

52.

STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.)

ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS

TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX!

CHASTITY

Come on!

STU

Did she just do that in heels?!

VICK

I'm really starting to like this

girl.

53.

CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD

(to walkie talkie)

Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder,

we've subdued the targets, over.

STU

Did you see them trample those tiny

Japanese businessmen?! I think they

killed like four of them!

VICK

Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't

just a little fun...

ALAN

That was...a little fun.

LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN

Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!

Stuart Pryce?!

STU

(SCARED)

Y-Yes?!

LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN

You're coming with us.

CUT TO:

54.

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

Where were you last night at 3am?

VICK

No idea.

OFFICER BLADEN

Okay, how about at 2am?

VICK

Ditto.

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

You think this is cute, son?! You

think this is a game?!

ALAN

Whatever we did, we're so sorry!

STU

Honestly, man, I will confess to

anything you want!

VICK

Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up

straight. Officer Merriweather,

I've told you twelve times now: we

have no memory of last night. Now

either charge us with a crime, or

let us go.

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

What do you know about Jimmy Lang?

55.

ALAN

Nothing?

STU

Who is he?

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-

Xi crime organization, and is

wanted in seven states for money

laundering, drug smuggling,

racketeering and murder.

ALAN

Oh my god--

STU

Did we kill someone last night--?!

VICK

We have no idea who this man is.

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

Is that right?

VICK

Yeah, that's right.

VICK & ALAN & STU & DOUG (ON TAPE)

HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPY

BIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!

VICK (ON TAPE)

I love you, Jimmy Lang!

56.

STU

We're in a lot of trouble, aren't

we.

ALAN

Officers, I swear, we have no

memory of that ever occurring--

OFFICER BLADEN

Okay. Maybe a night in jail will

jostle something loose.

STU

Oh no, sir, please don't!

ALAN

We have a very important wedding--!

VICK

I know Jimmy Lang.

ALAN

You do?!

VICK

Jimmy and I tried to raise capital

for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness

center and day spa for tween-age

girls, but it never got off the

ground. It was an entirely

legitimate enterprise -- I had no

idea he was a criminal. We must've

bumped into him last night, and he

must've invited us to join his

birthday celebration. No crime in

that, is there, Officers?

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

You actually expect me to believe

that dung?

VICK

(UNBLINKING)

Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

If I find out you're lying to me,

son, I will take all of you down,

is that clear?

57.

OFFICER BLADEN

You boys wouldn't last three hours

in prison.

VICK

Stu might.

VICK (CONT'D)

Now: are you gonna charge us with

something, or are we free to go?

OFFICER BLADEN

Get outta here.

ALAN

Oh, thank you, Officers!

STU

It was really nice meeting you--!

OFFICER MERRIWEATHER

If you know what's good for you,

you'll get the hell out of Vegas.

CUT TO:

ALAN

Did you have to be such a dick?!

VICK

We got out, didn't we?

ALAN

Yeah, four hours later! If we'd

just cooperated with them--

VICK

If we'd cooperated with them, we'd

be in jail right now, Alan.

58.

ALAN

What are we gonna do now? We've got

zero leads on where Doug is!

STU

Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.

STU (CONT'D)

Do you think he's okay--?

VICK

Stu, don't. Doug is fine.

STU

I mean, we were hanging out with

mobsters last night, man! They kill

people for looking at `em weird--!

VICK

Stu: Doug is fine.

STU

Or what if we like drove Doug out

to the desert and left him, just as

like a funny prank--?!

VICK

Stu! Enough!

ALAN

(MUTTERING)

I knew I shouldn't have come...

VICK

What did you just say?

ALAN

I said I knew I shouldn't have come

this weekend, Vick!

VICK

(getting heated)

Is that right?

ALAN

Yeah, that's right. I only came

because Doug insisted.

59.

VICK

Why do think you're so much better

than us, dude?!

ALAN

I don't -- I just think I'm better

than you, Vick! And trust me, it's

not that hard! You haven't changed

one bit since high school! Jesus,

you're 28 years old and you still

talk back to cops?! Really?!

VICK

You're out of your depth, Alan--

ALAN

And you're still the one getting us

in trouble! Only then it was hiding

your weed in our locker, and now

you've got us partying with wanted

felons! It's not cute anymore, man!

We're too old for this!

ALAN (CONT'D)

And all your stupid get-rich-quick

schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!

In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!

STU

Okay, let's all take a breath--

ALAN

When's the last time you had a real

job, man?! When's the last time you

had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the

last time you picked up the check?!

VICK

What's so great about any of those

things?!

ALAN

Those "things," Vick, are what

grown men do!

STU

Look, we're all tired and hungry--

60.

VICK

None of us ever liked you, Alan! We

only hung out with you because Doug

made us!

ALAN

Stu...? Is that true?

VICK

Why would anyone like you, dude?

Have you ever thought about that?

You're uptight, you're judgemental,

you're cheap, and yet somehow you

think you're sweeter than everyone

else! Well look around, man: no one

wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu

than you!

STU

Wait, what--?

ALAN

I've...always...hated you...

VICK

You punch like...your sister...

STU

Hey, no! Time out! We all need a

time out--!

61.

CHASTITY

That might not be like, the

smartest place to fight?

CUT TO:

STU

Good call on happy hour, Chastity.

These tacos kick ass.

CHASTITY

Yeah, I always come here when I get

out of jail.

ALAN

Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?

CHASTITY

Oh, my daddy taught me how to

hotwire almost anything.

VICK

That's funny, because Alan's daddy

taught him tax law.

ALAN

And Vick's daddy taught him how to

get really drunk at his kid's

soccer games and then piss himself.

VICK

It's a disease, dude--!

STU

Guys, come on! For Doug?

62.

STU (CONT'D)

"Number blocked."

VINCE                             ALAN

ALAN

What if it's Doug?

VICK

What if it's Tracy?!

STU

(torn, answers phone)

Good evening, this is Stu!

TRACY

Stu, it's Tracy!

STU

It's Tracy!

STU (CONT'D)

Why is she calling me?!

VICK

Because she knows you're the most

easily tricked.

ALAN

We have tell her we lost Doug.

VICK

No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!

STU

Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?

63.

TRACY

STU

TRACY

STU

(covering the mouthpiece)

VICK

ALAN

VICK

STU

(lamely, to phone)

TRACY

(FROWNING)

STU

(to guys)

VICK

64.

ALAN

Why do I have to be the one that

fell over drunk?!

VICK

It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get

over yourself! Stu: tell her!

STU (TO PHONE)

Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a

DOCTOR--

VICK

Fell over drunk.

STU

H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a

different doctor, not the one he

fell on -- he said we couldn't move

him until the wedding--

VICK

For a few hours! We'll be home

before the wedding!

STU

But we're going to have the wedding

at your home--

VICK

Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?

TRACY

(now very concerned)

Vick, what is going on?

VICK

Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen,

Alan hurt his back last night, so

we're gonna be laid up here for a

bit, but I promise we'll have Doug

home in time for the wedding, okay?

TRACY

Oh God, is Alan all right?

65.

VICK

Yes, luckily he had a steel rod

surgically implanted up his ass at

birth, so the doctors anticipate a

complete and swift recovery.

TRACY

Can I talk to Doug?

VICK

What? No! No, you can't actually,

Doug...Doug is out.

TRACY

Where is he?

VICK

Where is he? He's aaaat...the

pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's

medications. Listen, Trace, I'm

losing you, but we'll see you

tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--!

VICK (CONT'D)

She bought it.

CUT TO:

TRACY

They've done something stupid.

MR. TURNER

No surprise there.

TRACY

DAD--

MR. TURNER

I'm just saying, what kind of man

stands up his fiancee the night

before their wedding?

66.

TRACY

Dad, I don't want to hear it. I

trust Doug absolutely.

CUT BACK TO:

ALAN

Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd

have Doug home in 13 hours, and we

still have no idea where he is...

DOORMAN

Handstamp for re-entry?

Handstamp for re-entry?

VICK

Maybe we should go back to the

hotel and--

STU

Oh my God, guys! Look!

ALAN

It's like a map of last night!

CUT TO:

67.

STU

Where do you want to start?!

VICK

At the top! We hit every club we

went to til someone remembers what

we did with Doug!

ALAN

Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe

we're actually gonna pull this off!

STU

Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's

hat?!

VICK

Naaah, couldn't be.

ALAN

Lots of people have hats like that.

MATCH CUT TO:

68.

STU

All right, this is the last place

we went, "Chaps."

STU

You sure we came here...?

ALAN

The Golden Pony. That's us.

69.

STU

Maybe I'll just wait in the car--

VICK

You think we would've remembered

this...

STU

Yeah, I don't think we came here...

ALAN

Then why is your underwear nailed

to the wall?

STU

Those could be anybody's. Thousands

of people go to Colorado State--

ALAN

(looking more closely)

Oh my God, are they autographed?

VICK

(READING)

"Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!"

STU

(realizing, stunned)

I am so gay...

WAITER

Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!

STU

R-Roger?

70.

ALAN

Stay very close to me.

BOUNCER

How are Haylee and Kaitlin?

STU

(totally disturbed)

Oh. G-Good, thanks...?

VICK

We're going to love you either way,

Stu...

ALAN

Some of my best friends are gay.

STU

Is that true?

ALAN

Not...not really? I live in

Connecticut, man, we don't even

have black people yet.

71.

VICK

Excuse me, friend, can you tell me

where Roger is?

BEEFCAKE COWBOY

Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.

VICK

He's cute...I guess...?

ROGER

Oh! Hey guys!

ROGER (CONT'D)

I'm surprised you're even walking

yet, Stu.

STU

(inhaling sharply)

Oh my god.

VICK

Listen, man, we don't really

remember what happened last night,

can you fill us in?

ROGER

Really? No memory?

ROGER (CONT'D)

Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little

hurt.

STU

Did we...you know...do anything?

ROGER

Well, duh? Yeah?

72.

STU

Was I...the boy or the girl?

ROGER

Oh, honey, you were everything.

ROGER (CONT'D)

But you were nothing like Vick.

VICK

Wait-- what?!

ROGER

I know, I'm sort of over group

stuff too, but Alan insisted.

VICK

You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!

ALAN

I don't know! I don't know why I

insisted!

ROGER

Actually, after the anger went

away, it was really quite tender.

STU

I'm really not sure we can be

friends anymore...

CHASTITY

Guys: he's kidding.

VICK

Not cool, Roger. Not cool.

ALAN

So what did happen last night?

73.

ROGER

Oh, well, you guys came in near the

end of our last set, like 2ish.

Doug pretty much dragged you in.

ALAN

Really? Doug did?

ROGER

Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug.

Black guy, shaved head?

ROGER (CONT'D)

He's a cake designer, he said he

met you guys at some sort of

birthday party at the Rio?

VICK

(snapping his finger)

The guy from the Jimmy Lang

surveillance video.

ROGER

Anyway, for the big finale of our

show, we always bring someone on

stage, and, well, Stu, you

volunteered pretty aggressively.

(to nearby dancer)

Hey Dallas, do we have the video of

last night's show?

STU

No! That's cool, I don't need to

see it--

VICK

We must see that video.

DALLAS

It's in the machine.

74.

ROGER

You were pretty mellow at first,

Stu, but once we got you into the

chaps, you really came alive-- oh,

here it is.

STU

I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym

as much as I'd like...

ROGER

You even taught us The Pony, which

we'd never even heard of before...

ROGER (CONT'D)

And then, of course, the piece de

resistance: the Ride of the

Valkyries.

STU

Annnnd that would explain the

searing ass pain.

ROGER

After the show, we split a couple

pitchers of flirtinis, you had our

stylist cut your hair like mine,

and then you split.

VICK

And what time was all this?

ROGER

4:30 in the morning? 4:45?

ALAN

And our Doug was with us?

75.

ROGER

Yeah, he had passed out by then,

but you carried him out. It was all

very Officer And A Gentleman.

ALAN

Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45,

we got back to the hotel at 5:00,

and Doug was gone by 5:30 when

Chastity met back up with us?

STU

That doesn't make any sense.

VICK

Did we lose him along the way?

STU

He was passed out, how far could he

have gone--?

VICK

Hello?

ATASHIR

Mr. Lennon?

VICK

Atashir, many greetings to you.

ATASHIR

I thought you might like to know

that one of our maids just found

your friend, Douglas, passed out in

your room.

VICK

What?! Are you sure it's him?!

76.

ATASHIR

I saw him with my own eyes. He is

unconscious but breathing nicely.

VICK

Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a

man of great honor! A thousand

blessings upon your ancestors!

VICK (CONT'D)

Doug is in the room! A maid just

found him! He's passed out, but

he's okay!

STU

They're sure it's him?!

VICK

Atashir swears it is!

STU

Oh thank God he's okay...

ALAN

After all this?! He's in the room?!

VICK

I don't even care! Hug me, you big

shiny homosexual!

ALAN

That was cool of Roger to give you

all the tapes of your performance.

STU

I know, if I actually was gay, I'd

totally date Roger first. What a

gentle soul.

77.

VICK

How we doing on time?

ALAN

(looking at watch)

2:22.

VICK

We'll be in LA by dawn.

(firing up engine)

I told you bitches this would all

work out...

ALAN

This has officially been the

craziest weekend of my life.

(to Chastity)

Thanks for all your help. You were

awesome.

CHASTITY

Anything for my hubby.

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

I'm kidding, Alan. I know last

night wasn't, you know, real...

ALAN

I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.

CHASTITY

Jennifer.

ALAN

Beg pardon?

CHASTITY

My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.

78.

ALAN

Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.

CHASTITY

Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the

first flaky decision I've ever made

in my life. I mean, I am a

stripper.

ALAN

Where you from?

CHASTITY

LA. Tarzana.

ALAN

Oh yeah?

CHASTITY

Yeah. I work here on the weekends.

ALAN

You fly out every week?

CHASTITY

Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a

great school.

ALAN

Kid?

VICK

(aside, to Stu)

They always have kids.

CHASTITY

I have a little girl, Sarah.

She's... Well, she's everything.

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

What about you?

ALAN

No kids. Same girlfriend for 14

years. Becky.

79.

CHASTITY

Wow, she's stunning.

STU

We like you way better.

ALAN

STU!

ALAN (CONT'D)

Becky is great.

STU

Becky collects teapots.

VICK

Yeah, she's a total canwego.

CHASTITY

A what?

VICK

You know, she's the girl at the

party who's always like "Can we go?

Can we go?"

ALAN

She has low blood sugar.

STU

She has low fun sugar.

ALAN

Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm

going to marry!

(beat, considers)

If, you know...she forgives me for

cheating on her...

VICK

Wait: you're going to tell her?

ALAN

Of course I'm going to tell her! I

could never keep something like

that from her.

80.

VICK

Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me

for scratching her Queensryche CD

in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever

gonna forgive you for marrying a

stripper in Vegas.

ALAN

Well, then that's just the price

I'm going to have to pay.

CHASTITY

Good for you.

VICK

She's gonna cut your dick off,

dude.

CUT TO:

VICK

(to the valet)

Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be

right back.

VICK

Doug! Wake up, man!

KALOLO FANALUA

Aloha, assholes.

81.

STU

Uh-oh.

STU (CONT'D)

Not good.

JIMMY LANG

Oh, hello. Good to see you again.

VICK

Where is Doug?

ALAN

Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did

last night, we are incredibly sorry-

JIMMY LANG

These your rich friends you were

telling me about, Vick?

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

Oh, you haven't told them yet?

Really, that's low. Even for you.

ALAN

What's going on, Vick?

JIMMY LANG

Six months ago, your friend Vick

borrowed some money from me at what

can only be described as a very

unfavorable interest rate. When the

loan came due, he failed to pay me

back, but he promised me that he

could get the money from you guys

this weekend.

ALAN

Jesus, Vick...

82.

STU

How could you do this to us, man?

We're your best friends...

VICK

They were gonna hurt me, man...

JIMMY LANG

Well, Vick, it looks like you and

your friends have some issues to

discuss. In the meantime...

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

I need my goddamn money.

VICK

I can get it! I can! I just--

JIMMY LANG

I've heard that before, Vick,

including last night, when you so

rudely skipped out on my birthday

party. That's why I've taken some

collateral to ensure your payment.

His name is Doug.

VICK

You have Doug?

STU

Oh my God...

JIMMY LANG

If you want your friend to live,

meet me at mile marker 26 off

Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the

money. Are we clear?

VICK

Yes! Yes.

ALAN

M-M-Mr. Lang?

83.

JIMMY LANG

Yes, Mr. Mervish?

ALAN

H-How much does Vick owe?

CUT TO:

ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

200 thousand dollars?!

ALAN

How the hell could you blow that

kind of money?!

STU

Was it for the custard store?

ALAN

Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no

custard store! Vick was just trying

to rip us off to pay back Jimmy

Lang!

STU

Is that true, Vick?

STU (CONT'D)

Were any of your deals...real?

VICK

(GUILTY)

Some.

STU

Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that

money meant something to me...

VICK

Do you really think I wanted my

life to turn out like this, Stu?!

Do you really think I don't know

that I'm a massive loser?!

(MORE)

84.

VICK (CONT'D)

Jesus, you guys got out of high

school and you just knew what to

do, you went to college and got

good jobs and found cool wives and

made beautiful children -- what do

I have to show for the last decade

of my life?! Nothing!

VICK (CONT'D)

Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only

thing I really have...the only

thing I really have is you guys.

STU

Come on, Vick--

VICK

No, man, it's true! I put on a good

show, but my life is so goddamn

hollow and vapid and lonely, it

scares me, man. I-I don't know how

much longer I can keep this scam

going. And now I've gone and ruined

the one good thing I had...

VICK (CONT'D)

Just...please don't give up on me,

okay? I-I don't know what I'd do

without you guys. I really don't...

STU

Come on, man, we've been bro's

since third grade, it's gonna take

a lot more than money to ruin our

friendship.

STU (CONT'D)

What I don't understand is why you

didn't just ask me for the money. I

would've given you every last cent

I had, man...

85.

STU (CONT'D)

I love you, man.

VICK

Love you too, bro. Love you too.

STU

Also, I banged your sister

sophomore year.

VICK

What?!

STU

Sorry. Just seemed like a good time

to tell you.

STU (CONT'D)

She had just broken up with that

guy from Central, we were playing

"I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool,

one thing lead to another--

VICK

No! No. That's...that's plenty.

ALAN

Look, I'm glad we're all sharing,

but we've got three hours to come

up with 200 grand, or else...

ALAN (CONT'D)

I'd offer to take a loan out, but

it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm

pretty sure my bank is closed.

STU

I think I can get a 20 grand cash

advance on my credit card...

86.

ALAN

So that just leaves 180 grand...

CHASTITY

Well, it is Vegas...

SMASH CUT TO:

STU

Time check!

VICK

(looking at watch)

12 minutes.

STU

Chip check!

87.

STU (CONT'D)

Faster! Come on chip check!

VICK

Dude, how many Red Bulls have you

had?

STU

I stopped counting at six! I can

hear my heart beating in my head!

ALAN

Just over 100 grand.

VICK

There's only one thing left to do.

SMASH CUT TO:

STU

You sure we don't want red?! What

if the ball lands on red--!

VICK

Shut up, Stu.

ROULETTE CROUPIER

Betting is closed.

STU

I can't watch! My   heart's gonna

explode! Can your   heart even

explode?! Because   I think my heart

is gonna explode!   I can't watch!

88.

STU (CONT'D)

It's red, isn't it?! I knew it!

Tell me it's not red!

ALAN

It's not red...

ALAN (CONT'D)

It's green.

CUT TO:

CHASTITY

Would you like me to come with?

ALAN

No...It might get a little

dangerous. I wouldn't want...

CHASTITY

I'm so sorry...about everything.

ALAN

Thanks for all your help.

CHASTITY

There's no sense...in exchanging

numbers or anything...right?

ALAN

Yeah, probably not...

89.

CHASTITY

Well...I'll always remember you as

a great first husband, then.

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

You can just send the divorce

papers to the Crazy Horse or

whatever...

CHASTITY (CONT'D)

Thanks for reminding me that there

are still some really good guys out

there, Alan. I don't...I don't get

to meet too many of them.

VICK

We gotta go, man.

ALAN

Yep, just driving out to the middle

of desert to meet some mobsters,

what could possibly go wrong...?

STU

So what's our plan?

ALAN

I think we should tell Mr. Lang

that we couldn't get the money, but

that, if he's amenable, we could

create a payment calendar--

90.

VICK

We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag

of money, grab Doug, and make a run

for it.

ALAN

Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!

VICK

Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment

calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is

our only shot of getting Doug back!

Left turn!

DISSOLVE TO:

TRACY

Any word from Doug?

MR. TURNER

Nope.

(BEAT)

I know you don't want to hear it,

Trace, but you deserve better.

TRACY

I'm sure everything's fine. They're

all smart, capable adults...

CUT TO:

91.

VICK

This all the cash we got?

ALAN

This is the dumbest plan ever.

VICK

Alan I need you positive please.

STU

Here they come.

VICK

Stuart?

STU

Yeah?

VICK

There's an emergency bottle of

tequila in my glove box. Get it out

please.

ALAN

I can't believe this is how we're

going to die...

92.

JIMMY LANG

Let's see the money!

VICK

Let's see Doug!

ALAN

Jesus, what'd they do to him?

VICK

Pull off the Ralph's bag!

VICK

Who the hell is that?!

JIMMY LANG

(ANNOYED)

This is Doug!

ALAN

Oh my God: it's the other Doug!

Roger's friend, the cake designer!

BLACK DOUG

(to Jimmy Lang)

I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!

I barely even know these guys!

VICK

Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!

93.

JIMMY LANG

You sure?!

VICK

Yeah, man, our Doug is white!

JIMMY LANG

But you were partying with this guy

at my birthday thing!

VICK

I don't know what to tell you, bro,

this isn't the Doug we requested!

JIMMY LANG

Well. I apologize for the mix-up...

(drawing his HUGE GUN)

But I'm still gonna need my money.

ALAN

Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...

JIMMY LANG

Don't move, Vick.

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

Now please. Give me my money.

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

Don't be stupid, son. You--

VICK

Christ that hurts!

94.

STU

AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

ALAN

I'm being shot at! I'm being shot

at!

JIMMY LANG

I really didn't want to kill anyone

TODAY--

95.

ALAN

Oh my god, is he okay?!

VICK

Who cares! Go go!

STU

I can't believe you just saved my

life!

VICK

I can't believe you just drove my

car into Jimmy Lang!

STU

He's gonna be really upset!

ALAN

Yeah, I was just thinking that!

KIKIOLANI

Boss, Boss, you okay?!

JIMMY LANG

Find Vick... And kill him.

ALAN

Now can we call Tracy?

96.

VICK

Yeah. It's probably time.

CUT TO:

ALAN

Who wants to make the call?

STU

That was you!

ALAN

What?! No! I beat you by a mile!

STU

Vick, who won?!

VICK

(FROWNING)

Actually...I should do it. This

weekend was mostly my fault. I need

to Man Up.

ALAN

Well, I'll be damned...

VICK

I still can't believe Stu banged my

sister.

CUT TO:

97.

MR. TURNER

Any word from Doug?

TRACY

No, but I'm sure he's--

TRACY (CONT'D)

Hello?

VICK

Tracy, it's Vick.

TRACY

Hey Vick!

VICK

Listen, honey...The bachelor party

got a little out of control and,

well...we lost Doug.

TRACY

(her jaw dropping)

What?! But we're getting married in

like four hours!

VICK

Yeah, that's not gonna happen...

VICK

Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This

is all my fault--

98.

VICK (CONT'D)

What the--?!

ALAN

Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just

joking around! We've got Doug right

here!

TRACY

(HORRIFIED)

What kind of joke is that?!

ALAN

I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll

see you at the wedding! Bye!

VICK

What are you doing?

ALAN

I know where Doug is!

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

ALAN

Remember when we saw Doug's bed

impaled on the griffin thing?!

STU

Yeah, we threw it out the window.

ALAN

No: the windows don't open,

remember?!

99.

VICK

So how did--?

(REALIZING)

Oh my God.

STU

I don't get it.

ALAN

And that's why we've been seeing

Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He

was trying to signal someone!

VICK

I don't believe it...

STU

I-I still don't get it--

ALAN

And it totally jives with the

timeline, right?! We brought Doug

back to the hotel at 5:00, he was

passed out...

VICK

It's so obvious!

STU

Not...to me...so much?

VICK

How'd you figure it out?!

ALAN

The Patron, man! It reminded me of

our first drink of the night!

VICK

Honestly, dude, you're a genius.

STU

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE

DOUG IS?!

VICK

He's on the roof!

100.

ALAN

After Doug passed out, we must've

taken him up there in his bed as a

prank, so he'd wake up on the roof

or whatever? Then we forgot him.

VICK

And all day he's been throwing his

crap off the roof, trying to signal

someone to get him down!

STU

You think he's still up there?!

ALAN

Only one way to find out...

SMASH CUT TO:

ALAN

DOUG?! DOUG?!

VICK

WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!

ALAN

DOUG!

STU

Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!

101.

DOUG

Don't...even...talk to me.

VICK

Okay, no, that's cool!

STU

Yeah, you have every right to be

upset! We validate your anger!

CUT TO:

VICK

Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?!

Why did you betray us?!

ATASHIR

Because they paid me. And also

because you're kind of racist.

VICK

Fair enough! See you next time, you

beautiful Judas!

ALAN

No flights to LA with empty seats!

STU

Well, we can't drive! It's 350

miles to LA and the wedding starts

at 10, which is in--

(MORE)

102.

STU (CONT'D)

(looking at watch)

--three hours!

SMASH CUT TO:

VICK

Look, Doug, I think I speak for

everyone in the car when I say I'm

really sorry about locking you on

the roof of the hotel.

STU

You gotta admit, it's a pretty

funny prank... I mean, up until the

part when we forgot all about you.

STU (CONT'D)

He's still not talking to us.

ALAN

Totally understandable, man.

Whenever you're ready...

CUT TO:

103.

CUT TO:

VICK

I OWE YOU, NEECO!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

104.

MR. TURNER

I'm sorry, honey, but I think you

need to seriously consider that

Doug might not be coming...

MR. TURNER (CONT'D)

Some men just aren't cut out for

this kind of commitment. I'm so

sorry that this is how you had to

find out--

VICK

Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy

route. We ready to do this thing?

CUT TO:

VICK

She looks beautiful, man.

105.

VICK (CONT'D)

That's cool. I get it.

TRACY

I love you, Daddy.

MR. TURNER

I love you too, pumpkin.

TRACY

Where were you? And why are you

pink?

DOUG

It's a long story. All I can say is

I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as

long as we're married, I will never

ever put you through something like

this again.

(desperate, pleading)

Can... Can you forgive me?

MINISTER

We, um, we traditionally wait til

the end for the kiss...?

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

106.

VICK

We did it, fellahs. We pulled it

off.

ALAN

I never had a doubt.

STU

You think Doug's ever going to talk

to us again?

VICK

Give him time.

ALAN

Yeah. Like a decade or two--

STU

Uh-oh.

VICK

Hey Beck--!

BECKY

Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell

have you been?! I've been calling

and calling! What, you don't answer

your phone anymore?!

107.

ALAN

I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--

WOMAN'S VOICE

Alan?

VICK

This just got complicated...

ALAN

Jennifer?

CHASTITY

I-I know I wasn't invited, but I

just had to return this...

BECKY

Okay: who the hell is this chick,

and why the hell does she have your

Grandmother's wedding ring?!

BECKY (CONT'D)

Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just

like your mother! Talk! Who's the

ho wearing my ring?!

ALAN

She's my wife.

108.

ALAN (CONT'D)

We don't make each other happy

anymore, Beck. And we can keep not

making each other happy for another

14 years -- hell, maybe even

another 50 years -- but let's not.

Let's find people who make our

hearts race. Let's be excited and

fun and alive again...

BECKY

Are you fucking kidding me?

ALAN

I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.

(to Chastity)

Can I buy you a free drink?

CHASTITY

We're not...actually...still

married, are we?

ALAN

Let's start with dinner, and see

where it goes...?

CHASTITY

(smiling warmly)

I'd like that.

BECKY

Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back

here this second!

(but Alan keeps walking)

Don't you walk away from me, you

stupid little clown! I own you! GET

BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!

109.

VOICE

Daddy?!

STU

Oh, I missed you guys so much!

HAYLEE

We missed you too, daddy!

KAITLIN

You're the best dad ever!

ERIN

Jesus, are you still drunk?

VICK

Okay, okay, I'll go with you.

Just...don't ruin the wedding.

JIMMY LANG

I really didn't want it to end like

this, Vick.

110.

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

Good luck.

VICK

(totally thrown)

Um, what...?

JIMMY LANG

Your friend Alan just paid your

marker. Took out a second mortgage

on his house. The full 200 grand,

plus medical expenses, which I

thought was a classy touch.

JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)

Without our friends, we are

nothing, Vick. Remember that.

DISSOLVE TO:

VICK

I will pay you back, you know.

ALAN

Damn straight you will!

VOICE BEHIND THEM

Okay, so what the hell happened

this weekend?

VICK

Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu

went gay, and I learned a very

important life lesson from an obese

hoodlum.

STU

We'll tell you the whole story when

you get back from your honeymoon.

111.

ALAN

We really are sorry, man.

VICK

To Doug and Tracy.

STU

To Doug and Tracy.

ALAN

To Doug and Tracy.

DOUG

To me and Tracy -- and to being

here, with my three former best

friends in the world...

DOUG (CONT'D)

There's nowhere else I'd rather be

right now.

DOUG (CONT'D)

That said, let's not get too stupid

tonight, okay? I'm going on my

honeymoon in 24 hours...

THE GUYS

No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,

dude.

CUT TO BLACK.
