4/25/96 rev.

DUSSANDER (O.S.)

All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it

go!

DUSSANDER

(continuing)

A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't

you read?  I thought all American boys could

read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day.

TODD

Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander.

DUSSANDER

Give me my newspaper.

TODD

Sure thing, Mr. Dussander.

DUSSANDER

My name is Denker.  See?

(pointing)

Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all.

What a pity.  Good day.

TODD

Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43.

Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you

went to Patin.

TODD (CONT'D)

After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires.

From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and

then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No

one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West

Berlin, where they almost got you.

DUSSANDER

Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter

with you.  But I don't have time for this

game.  Now, get out of here before I call the

police.

TODD

Call them if you want.

DUSSANDER

Fine.

TODD

It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure

the police would love to meet the "Blood-

fiend of Patin."

DUSSANDER

You get away from this house, God damn you!

I'll beat you all the way home.

TODD

After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I

did.  Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If

you want to call the cops, go right ahead.

I'II wait on the steps.

DUSSANDER

You'll do no such thing.

TODD

I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start

screaming right here, I will.  If I want to

ride down to the police station and bring the

cops back myself, then I will.  I will do

what ever I want.  Do you understand?

(pause)

But if you like, I could come in for a

minute.  We could talk.

DUSSANDER

I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy

like you into my home.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Is that what you want, to come into my home?

So be it.  There is no arguing with crazy

people.

DUSSANDER

My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease.

At that time I was working at the Menschler

Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Stop that!

TODD

Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the

lampshades out of human skin?

DUSSANDER

Now I don't know what you're talking about.

TODD

Sure you do, Mr. Dussander.

DUSSANDER

Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen,

boy.  The television has fried your brain.

TODD

Your hands are shaking.

DUSSANDER

Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all

shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now

if you have a point I wish you'd come to it.

TODD

We're in no rush.  If I thought you had

plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know

you don't...

DUSSANDER

You know nothing of my business --

TODD

What business?  You sit in that ugly chair

and watch soap operas all day.  Except on

Friday afternoons when you walk down to the

movie theater.  And twice a week you take the

bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always

use the express lane because you never have

more than ten items.

DUSSANDER

You have been following me?

TODD

Of course, I followed you.  You think I

normally go around to peoples' houses and

accuse them of being Nazi fugitives?

DUSSANDER

Perhaps for me you made an exception.

TODD

No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt

Dussander I had to be absolutely certain.

...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here.

DUSSANDER

Oh, yes, I see now.  As I am this ex-Nazi

fellow, as you say, then this must be the

part where I offer you my hidden stash of

gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish

men, of course, which I keep buried in the

basement.  Isn't that right, boy?  Well, I'm

afraid you're wasting your time. I have no

money.  If I did I might even give you some

just to be done with this nonsense.

TODD

I don't need money.  You don't have any

anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You

probably had to spend it all to sneak in the

country.  A good American passport is

expensive on the black market, that I know.

DUSSANDER

Do you?  Good for you.

TODD

Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're

my One Great Interest.

DUSSANDER

Your what?

TODD

My One Great Interest.  Well, not you

personally, but, ...well, it's something I

learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,

Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our

One Great Interest in life.  You know, the

thing that would really grab us.  Once we did

that, everything would fall into place.  Like

hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but

collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I

guess there's no money in that, so she has to

be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start

thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing

happened.  Until the following summer, in

Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found

it.

RONNY

One of these has three girls doing it

at the

same time

.

RONNY (CONT'D)

I got it!  Check this out. ...Todd, look.

TODD

Hang on a sec.

TODD (CONT'D)

It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd

never seen, stuff they

never

put in the books

anymore, especially the ones they give us to

read.  And here were

stacks

of them.

TODD

It...

grabbed

me.  It was just like Miss

Harmon said.  I couldn't believe it.  But

there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the

...the way they saluted each other.  But what

am I telling you for?  You know more about

this stuff than anybody.

DUSSANDER

Yes, what are you telling me for?

TODD

(ignoring him)

Then last year I wrote my big term paper on

Dachau.  I got an A+.  It was the only A+ she

gave.  I mean I always do real well.  A's on

everything.  That's why I'm accelerated.

DUSSANDER

Accelerated?

TODD

You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades,

second and ninth.  I didn't need them.

That's why I'm already a junior.

DUSSANDER

I see...

TODD

Some kids resent me for it.  That's not

important.  Anyway, my paper really floored

my history teacher.  I guess because I got

through all those books without throwing up.

But I learned something.  I learned that when

you talk about the camps now, you have to

remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean,

you can't just say what happened like the

magazines did and leave it at that.  If I

tried that the teacher would have freaked and

called my parents in.

RONNY

Todd, your mom's on the phone.  She says you

have to come home for dinner.  ...Todd?

TODD

What?

RONNY

(suddenly wary of Todd)

Your mom's on the phone.

TODD

Nowadays you have to... soften it.

DUSSANDER

Why do I care about this?

TODD

Because, I don't want it softened.

DUSSANDER

I am sure you trouble your parents to no end.

TODD

Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's

what my dad says.

DUSSANDER

You told your parents about me, then?

TODD

You think I'm crazy?

DUSSANDER

I think you're crackers, but go on.  I'm

riveted.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

TODD

And then it happened... I was on my way to

the library.  It was raining...

FLASHBACK

: INT. CITY BUS - DAY

TODD (V.O.)

You climbed on the bus and started this slow

walk down the aisle.  Just like you were

examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't

think anybody gave you a second glance but

me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out

of your way.  And under your arm you carried

a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did

it, what really set me off was the coat.  You

were wearing this long black rain coat.  My

mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of

you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S.

greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.

TODD

It was incredible.

DUSSANDER

All of this... because of a rain coat?

TODD

Well, it wasn't

that

easy.  I mean, I had to

really check up on it.  And every picture of

you in those books is forty years old, at

least.  I went back to the library to find

the picture.  And then I matched it with the

photos I took.

DUSSANDER

You took photographs of me?

TODD

Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right

in the palm of my hand.

DUSSANDER

(crunches cigarette into ashtray)

Clever boy.

TODD

But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed

real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought

a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a

book that tells you what you're supposed to

look for and then dusted your mailbox while

you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh?

DUSSANDER

You... put dust on my mailbox?  For

fingerprints?  You took photographs of me?

What else did you do?... I don't believe any

of this.

TODD

I already had a copy of your fingerprints.

They're on your want sheet from the Israeli

government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.

Can you believe that?

DUSSANDER

Bourbon.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Would you care for a drink, boy?

TODD

Sure, you got a Coke?

DUSSANDER

No

Kok

.

TODD

Milk?

DUSSANDER

Milk.

TODD

It takes eight good matches, they're called

compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get

accepted in court.

DUSSANDER (O.S.)

Is that right?

FLASHBACK

: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY

TODD (V.O.)

Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The

first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I

knew what I was looking for, yours were easy

to spot.

DUSSANDER (O.S.)

You should be a detective.

TODD

Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it.

TODD

I found fourteen compares.

TODD (CONT'D)

You have some.

DUSSANDER

Good

Gott

.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee

Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a

smiling cow.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

(more to himself than Todd)

...And two missing children.

(pause)

Boy what you have done, I have to explain

this to you because clearly you don't

understand, what you have done is a

violation.

TODD

A violation?

DUSSANDER

Yes.

TODD

Kind of like those experiments with the

decompression chamber.  Now, that was a

violation, Dussander.

DUSSANDER

That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand

it.

TODD

You what?

DUSSANDER

I demand --

TODD

You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?

DUSSANDER

Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for

the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It

has never been anything else.  It has never

even been Americanized.  If you must know,

and apparently you must, I was named by my

father who greatly admired the stories of

Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the

reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties,

when I was first married, I supported Hitler.

I supported him most, I suppose, because for

the first time in years there was work and

there was tobacco. ...Would you like a

cigarette?

TODD

No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him

quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...

that's nicotine gum.

DUSSANDER

Nicotine gum.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end,

directing phantom armies at the whim of his

astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a

death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment

surrendered to the Americans.  I remember

that a private named Gonzales gave me a

chocolate bar.  I wept.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

I was interned at Essen where I was treated

very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg

trials on the radio and when Goering

committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of

schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released,

I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works

until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated

here, to California, and became a U.S.

Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I

vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no

koo-ba.

And that's it, my whole story.  I hope you're

satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say,

tough shit for you.  Now, you go.  Enough of

this.

TODD

That was pretty good.  So much to remember.

But I guess it helps when you have forty

years to practice your story.

DUSSANDER

Oh, to hell with this and to hell with you.

I'm calling the police.  Your father is

going to beat your behind when he picks you

up at the police station.

TODD

No.  My parents don't believe in violence.

DUSSANDER

Well, they should start.  I'm calling.

TODD

Hang up the phone.

DUSSANDER

This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things

you're accusing me of?

TODD

Do it.

DUSSANDER

If you don't want money, what do you want?

TODD

I want to hear about it.

DUSSANDER

Hear about what?

TODD

The camps. Everything.  The experiments. The

examinations.  All the stuff the writers are

scared to put in their books because people

will think they're sick.  That's what I want,

...

everything

.

DUSSANDER

Everything?

TODD

Exactly.  And you're going to tell it to me.

DUSSANDER

You're a monster.

TODD

According to history you're the monster.

DUSSANDER

How could you ask me to remember such things?

I can barely remember to take my heart

medicine.

TODD

You were there.  You did those things.  No

one can tell it better than you can.  And you

will tell it, starting today.  Right now.  If

you don't, I'll tell everyone who you are.  I

swear it.

DUSSANDER

Why should I?  Why should I do any of it?

TODD

Because you hung up the phone.  That's why.

...And just so you know, just so there is no

misunderstanding whatsoever.  Everything I

have on you, the compares, the want sheet,

all the photographs, are all in an envelope

under my mattress.  I'm going to put it there

every time I come to see you.  If anything

happens to me, if I should suddenly

disappear, some one will find it.  Believe

me --

DUSSANDER

That's a foolish thing to do.  What if your

mother goes in your room anyway?  What if she

hires a maid?

TODD

You better hope she doesn't.

(looking at watch)

We're wasting time.  Let's get started.  I

have to be home for dinner. Today I want to

hear about the ovens.  How you baked them

after they were dead... and before.

DUSSANDER

(to himself)

A boy... a boy...

TODD

But before we start, put your teeth in.  You

look better with your teeth.

PROXMIRE

But in 1902, Panama didn't exist.  The

country we know as Panama was part of

Columbia.

PROXMIRE (CONT'D)

Now the nations of the west knew they needed

a canal through Central America.  They were

tired of waiting for their ships to sail

around Cape Horn.  This was the new century,

the age of modernization.  And the U.S. was

at the forefront.  Teddy Roosevelt was in the

White House, looking for any chance to assert

the might of America.  When Columbia balked

at the offer made by the U.S. and England,

Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off

the coast of Panama, just sit there, where

they could be seen from the coast.

PROXMIRE (CONT'D)

Finally Columbia gave up the territory for

about a tenth of its original price.  And as

Roosevelt would say later, "The U.S. stole

the Panama canal fair and square."

JOEY

(laughs)

Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch-

man.

TODD

(serious)

Don't do that.

JOEY

I got news for you.  You're gonna like it.

TODD

Walk with me to French.

JOEY

Someone likes you.  Someone good.

TODD

Who?

JOEY

Well, I heard my sister talking on the phone

with Lisa Herman, and... well --

TODD

You going to tell me who it is?

JOEY

(lowering voice)

You didn't hear it from me.

TODD

Fine.

JOEY

Becky Trask.

TODD

Was that so hard?

JOEY

So ask her out and the weekend after next you

can double with me and Vanessa.

TODD

What about this weekend?

JOEY

I'm already planning on being grounded.

TODD

Grounded?  What for?

JOEY

Where the hell you been?  Report cards were

sent out today.  I know that never affects

you...

JOEY (CONT'D)

Shit.  Don't forget what I told you.

TODD

I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with

McDonald's before.  ...So, How did the stuff

get to Patin?

DUSSANDER

In railroad cars marked "Medical Supplies."

It came in long crates that looked like coffins.

TODD

That's fitting.  Was it always Zyklon-B?

DUSSANDER

No, from time to time we would be sent

something else.  Experimental gases.  The

High Command was always interested in

improving efficiency.  Once they sent us a

gas code-named "Pegasus."  A nerve gas.

Thank God they never sent it again.  It...

TODD

It what?

DUSSANDER

It didn't work very well.  It was quite boring.

TODD

Bullshit.  You're lying.  What did it do?

DUSSANDER

It killed them.  What do you think it did,

made them walk on water?  It killed them.

TODD

Tell me.

(slurps on his Coke)

Tell me.

DUSSANDER

I won't.  I refuse.  Where are my cigarettes?

TODD

What did it do?

DUSSANDER

It made them dance.

TODD

Dance?

DUSSANDER

Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower

heads.  After a few seconds the prisoners

began to leap about.  Some were screaming.

Most of them were laughing.  They began to

vomit and to... to defecate helplessly.

TODD

You mean they... they... shit themselves?

...Woah.

DUSSANDER

They began to twitch all over and make high,

strange sounds in their throats.  At last

they collapsed and just lay there on the

concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood

streaming from their noses.  But I lied to

you, boy.  It didn't kill them.  Either

because it wasn't strong enough or because we

couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long.

I suppose it was that.  I sent five men in

with rifles to end their agonies.  These were

five men I trusted.  It would have looked bad

on my record to have wasted so many

cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had

declared every cartridge a national resource.

I was always given high marks for efficiency.

TODD

Yeah, I bet.

DUSSANDER

How do you eat this crap everyday?

TODD

Why didn't you just do the job yourself? You

carried a gun, didn't you?

DUSSANDER

(incredulous)

I was the commandant of the camp.

TODD

So you never killed anybody?

DUSSANDER

(getting frustrated)

The entire world was at war, boy.  People died.

TODD

That's not a real answer.  I'm asking about

you

.

DUSSANDER

Boy, I was a soldier in a position of power.

You don't get to be there by selling ...girl

scout's cookies.

TODD

I know what the SS was, Dussander.  Who are

you talking to?  It was a bunch of dumb, rich

kids who bought their way into the service so

they wouldn't have to go fight on the front.

DUSSANDER

That's enough for today, boy.  I beg you.

I'm tired.

TODD

Yeah, fine.  That was good story though.  You

always tell them good, once I get you started.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1

: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

DICK

You're tight.  Don't hold your breath so long.

TODD

Forget it.  I can't concentrate.

DICK

I know your upset.  So am I.  So is your

mother.

TODD

These honors classes... they aren't as easy

as I thought they'd be.  I totally admit it,

I didn't prepare enough.  I'm sorry.

DICK

Well, fine, but now is not the time to slack

off.  You got a chance to finish at the top of

your class--

TODD

Nobody wants that more than I do, Dad.

DICK

Well you haven't been hitting the books very

much.

TODD

I know...

DICK

And seeing as you're not playing soccer this

year it's not like you don't have enough

time--

TODD

That still bothers you, doesn't it?

DICK

(with difficulty)

No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then

you shouldn't play.

TODD

I think it bothers you and you're not telling

me.

DICK

That was lousy.  Here.

(gives the gun back to Todd)

I want to see your grades come up, buddy.

That's all that bothers me.  And if you say

you need more time to study, then that's what

we'll do.  The first thing is to cut out all

the time you spend reading to Mr. Denker.

It's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping

our school work a bit.

DICK (CONT'D)

Hey, Todd.  You still with me?

TODD

Yeah... no.  Dad, don't do that.  Please.

Don't punish Mr. Denker for something that's

my fault.  I mean, he'd be lost without me--

DICK

He'll be fine without you. He was fine before

and he'll be fine after. There's nothing

wrong with wanting to help people, but you

gotta make sure you got yourself squared away

first.

That's

what matters.

TODD

Dad, am I like other kids?

DICK

Not by a long shot.

TODD

Then trust me on this.  Don't lose faith in

me because I blew a couple of exams.  I

will

get my grades back up.  In fact I've already

started.  Three days a week I go over to

Freddy Tremain's for extra help. He's a wiz

at trig. But please, Dad, whatever you do,

don't punish a helpless old man for something

that's my fault.

DICK

Did you practice that in front of a mirror or

something?

DICK (CONT'D)

Hey, he's not...?

TODD

(it takes him a second)

...No.

DICK

Just checking.

(thinks for a moment)

All right... We'll give your way a shot. If

you think you can do it, if you really do,

and your serious, then... okay.

You really like the old guy, don't you?

TODD

I'm making a difference in somebody's life.

It's that simple.

DICK

Okay, okay.

(takes the rifle)

Don't ever force it.  Watch.

TODD (O.S.)

Don't get too drunk.  We still have a little

while.

DUSSANDER

You don't have to do that, you know.

TODD

Screw you.  I'm doing this for me.  This

place is freezing.

DUSSANDER

Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside.  I'm

sure to you it seems positively

frigid

.

TODD

Why didn't you pay your gas bill?

DUSSANDER

It slipped my mind.  I will attend to it

tomorrow.

TODD

Slipped your mind.  I noticed it didn't slip

your mind to stock up on a new case of

bourbon.

DUSSANDER

Leave me alone.

TODD

All right, so finish your story, because I'm

still not clear.  You cook up this stew, and

you bring the prisoner in, and you let them

smell it, and suddenly they tell you

everything?

DUSSANDER

Oh, don't misunderstand me.  Certainly with a

pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner

would tell us everything we wanted to know,

sometimes more.  But mine was a much more ...

elegant method.  Remember, it had been months

since they had smelled real potatoes

simmering over an open flame, and boy, when

that delicious odor hit their noses their

mouths would drop and out would pour an

account of every minor infraction their

friends had committed, I mean it was

magnificent...

TODD

And you let them eat the soup?

DUSSANDER

Oh, we never promised them the soup in

exchange for information.  We never mentioned

it at all.

TODD

Wow, that's really good, Dussander.  I mean

that's...

(pointing)

that's

thinking.

DUSSANDER

...But, as the war pressed on, the time for

such civilized measures became a luxury.  I

remember by April of '45, we had barely

enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of

the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but

still, the train cars from France and Poland

kept coming.  This was a time of desperation.

The ovens burned day and night and

still

I

knew we would not beat the arrival of the

Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly

ones, deserted during the night.  But the men

that remained, the same ones I had called

upon so many times, ...continued the work.

At first we thought a massive fire in the

main building would serve our purpose.  We

could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch

up to each of the windows.  But with so many

of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would

burn properly.  We needed something

...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I

shall never forget his enthusiastic smile,

pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the

Western gate which had been used during

construction.  How perfectly simple it was.

The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four

meters deep, down the center of the camp.

For two hours they dug until I realized we

may not have enough gas to finish the job.

So the inmates were given shovels and told

they were building a shelter from the

incoming artillery.  When they were done, I

immediately called for a practice drill and

three thousand naked bodies began to march

into the trench.  It took less than twenty

minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the

bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit

sending the piles of earth into the massive

grave.  Those who tried to free themselves

were shot, of course, but very few cartridges

were wasted that day.  The machines were too

fast.  Back and forth they went... packing

the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of

gas and my men had to scurry along with

shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I

gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance

the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like

an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that

no matter what happened, ...no one would ever

forget what we did here.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Hello?

(Pause. Then with apprehension)

Yes? ...No, no trouble at all. ...Yes.

...Yes, he's here. ...I see.

(his face softens)

...Really? ...No, no plans. ...Ah, lovely.

...My dear, I'd be delighted. ...Certainly.

...Of course I will. ...Yes, until then.

...All right. ...Good-bye.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

It seems I am to be your guest for

Thanksgiving dinner.

BECKY

Is everything all right?

TODD

Yeah, I'm fine.

BECKY

You're nervous.  I think it's sweet.

TODD

No... No, I'm cool.

BECKY

Do you want me to do something else?

DUSSANDER

Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Come, puss-puss.  That's right.  I'll wait.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

That's right, puss-puss.  You can smell it

now, can't you?

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

That's right, kitty-kitty.  That's right.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Gotcha.

TODD

I'm sorry.

BECKY

It's all right.  Maybe you'll be more in the

mood later.

TODD

I don't know.  That's never happened before.

TODD (CONT'D)

Can you blow that the other way?

BECKY

Maybe you don't like me.

TODD

No, I do.

BECKY

(exhaling out the window)

Maybe you don't like girls.

BECKY (CONT'D)

That was a lousy thing for me to say.  I'm

sorry, honey.

TODD

Let's just go home.

DUSSANDER

Oww, you mother-fucker.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Come here!

TODD'S DAYDREAM

: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

DUSSANDER

(to other scientists)

Test run eight-four.  Electricity, sexual

stimulus, metabolism.  Based on the Thyssen

theories of negative reinforcement.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately

sixteen years of age, no scars, no

identifying marks, no known disabilities --

VOICE (O.S.)

You, on lane twelve.  You need to have your

headgear on at all times. (click) And no

rapid firing.

MONICA

Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick

did.

DICK

We all loved that dog.

AGNES

I remember when you had to put it down, Todd

cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my

heart.

DUSSANDER

Excuse, me, Mrs. Bowden.  Put it down?  I've

been here over twenty years but that's a new

one.

VICTOR

Means put it to sleep, Victor.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Well, it's how they kill it, Arthur. They do

it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs,

dogs nobody wants.

MONICA

It's very humane.

DUSSANDER

I see.

MONICA

Some more pie?

DUSSANDER

As my departed wife used to say, 'One must

never overdo the sublime.'

AGNES

It was delicious, Monica.

VICTOR

Tell me, Arthur, if you don't mind me asking.

What did you do during the war?

AGNES

Now don't get too personal, Victor.

DUSSANDER

I was a student at the University until my

reserve unit was called in 1943.

(notices Victor)

But we were not a combat unit, thank God.

Mechanical engineers.  Help me find my

cigarettes, Todd.  Would you?  In those days,

not even the call of higher learning could

exempt an able body from military service.

MONICA

Todd Bowden!

DUSSANDER

(laughs knowingly)

My dear, I do apologize.  My hands are too

arthritic to strike a match, I'm afraid.

Your son has been good enough to help an old

man with his filthy habits.

MONICA

Well...as long as you don't inhale.

TODD

Cigarettes are gross, Mom.

VICTOR

Well, Victor, you were doing your part like

we all were, I suppose.  Of course, if you

were in the Pacific Fleet I'd have to shoot

you.

DICK

(to Dussander)

My dad is very proud of the fact that the

Bowden men have hit every major conflict

since the Civil War.

VICTOR

That's right.  Dickie served two tours in

Vietnam.  Earned a bronze star and a purple

heart.

DICK

It's one family tradition I'd like to put an

end to.  Todd and I blow a few caps down at

the range every week.  That's all the combat

he needs.

TODD

(perking up, offended)

What's that supposed to mean?

DICK

Forget it.

DUSSANDER

(looking at Todd)

Perhaps your son would excel in combat.

MONICA

Todd could excel at anything.  Right, honey?

AGNES

(getting up, starts to clear some

dishes)

Oh, let's don't even talk about this. I can't

stand to think of you boys fighting another

war.

DUSSANDER

The Purple Heart.  You were injured?

TODD

He was knocked unconscious and woke up in a

hospital.

DICK

Mom, let me get that for you.

DUSSANDER

You shouldn't be so hard on your father.

TODD

Why don't you mind your own business.

DUSSANDER

(amused at Todd's short fuse)

Boy, It's not so easy to raise children. Your

father does the best he can, I'm sure. Having

his own father there is bound to cause some

anxiety on his part--

TODD

Oh, give me a frigging break, will you?  Look

who's talking to me, for Christ's sake.  And

what was that crap about the dog?  If you

were any more charming I was going to puke.

DUSSANDER

Heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the

point?  I used the evening to our

advantage

.

TODD

Our

advantage?

Our

advantage?

DUSSANDER

Certainly now they will offer no objections

if you continue to come over and read to me.

TODD

You sure take a lot for granted.  Do you

think there's anybody forcing me to come over

to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up

booze all day?  Do you?

DUSSANDER

Lower your voice.  People will hear.

TODD

So what?

DUSSANDER

No, nobody forces you to come.  In fact, you

are welcome to stay away.  Believe me, boy, I

have no scruples about drinking alone.  None

at all.

TODD

You know, if they found out what you are,

they'd spit on you.

DUSSANDER

I am sure they would have nothing but

revulsion for me.  But what would they say

about you, boy, when I told them you had

known about me for nine months... and said

nothing?

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Come and see me if you please, and stay home

if you don't.  Good night, boy.

TODD

Go ahead, open it.  Wait, I better pull down

the shades, first.

DUSSANDER

What for?

TODD

Just to be safe.

DUSSANDER

(getting up)

To hell with this.  You open it.

TODD

Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it.

DUSSANDER

You wrapped it yourself, I see.

TODD

Merry Christmas!

DUSSANDER

Pete's Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving

You Since 1976.

TODD

Go ahead, try it on.

DUSSANDER

Are you out of your mind, boy?  What makes

you think I would put something like that on?

TODD

I thought you'd like it --

DUSSANDER

Like it?  My God, you're a bigger fool than I

thought.  Maybe I'll put it on and do a

little shopping downtown.  Is that what you

thought?  You stupid, boy.

TODD

Don't call me stupid.

DUSSANDER

You... You know, you are correct.

I

am the

stupid one.  For months I have suffered your

indignities.  I have exposed my past to you

while watching you stuff your face with those

wretched hamburgers.  I have stocked my

refrigerator with Coca Cola and ding dongs.

All for you, I have done these things and I'm

tired of it.  But because I value my life and

my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do

them.  But I'll die before I put this thing

on, you fucking piss-ant.

TODD

That's enough.  You don't get to talk to me

like that.

DUSSANDER

I should smash you.

TODD

Do it.  Please.

(pause)

Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is

nothing compared to what the Israelis would

do to you.  Remember what happened to

Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And,

you know, that's my fault.  I have let you

forget.  You have gotten comfortable with

this situation.  Well, don't you for one

minute ever forget who holds the cards here.

Don't you ever forget that envelope under my

mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I

tried to do something to please you, but you

don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard

way.  You will put this on because I want to

see you in it.  Now strip.

DUSSANDER

I hope you go to hell --

DUSSANDER

The insignia is all wrong.  The boots should

be leather, not imitation.

TODD

That suit cost me over eighty bucks... with

the boots.

DUSSANDER

And this material... what?  Polyester?

TODD

Quiet.  Straighten that hat.

TODD (CONT'D)

Straighten that hat, soldier!

DUSSANDER

Good

Gott

.

TODD

Actung!

TODD (CONT'D)

Now, march... Do it!

TODD (CONT'D)

That's it.  March.

TODD (CONT'D)

About face.

TODD (CONT'D)

About face.

TODD (CONT'D)

Okay, that's enough.

TODD (CONT'D)

I said that's enough!

DUSSANDER

Boy... be careful. You play with fire.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #2

: INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

DUSSANDER

(in German)

Come out. ...Come out, now!

No one exits the train.  Yet, the eyes seem to move around

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

(in German)

Line up in front of the train. Now!

JOEY

So what are you going to do?

TODD

Fuck if I know.

JOEY

You're throwing it flat.  Let it roll off

your fingers more.

TODD

(snapping at him)

I don't need a lesson.

JOEY

Your dad, man.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm a

fuck up.  My dad is used to this crap from

me.

JOEY

What?

TODD

What?

JOEY

You said something?

TODD

No.

JOEY

You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  It's not

the first time I've noticed it.  What is

going on with you?

TODD

Nothing, Joey.  I fucked up.  I'II fix it.

I'II fix it.

JOEY

(hurt)

All right, man.  Whatever you say.  Look, I

got to get to practice.

JOEY (CONT'D)

If you need to talk, you can call me.  You

know that.  I'II see you around.

TODD

(mumbling)

You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  You're

talking to yourself, Bowden.

TODD (CONT'D)

I'II fix it.  I'II fix it.

TODD (CONT'D)

I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.

TODD

What the fuck happened in here?

DUSSANDER

Ah, boy...  I burned my TV dinner, I'm afraid.

TODD

Something's come up.  Sit down.

DUSSANDER

I see.

(sits at table)

What seems to be the trouble?

DUSSANDER

Quarterly Progress Report.

(he reads silently)

You seem to have fallen on the rocks, my boy.

One B, three C's and a D.  Hardly the work of

a "National Merit Scholar," or whatever you

call yourself.

TODD

This isn't a joke, Dussander.  I can't blame

this on teachers or honors classes anymore.

DUSSANDER

Looks like you have a problem then.

TODD

I have a problem?  You still don't get it.

I'm out of excuses.  Do you know what's going

to happen when my dad sees that?  He's going

to hit the fucking roof.  He'll get it all

out of me.  The truth, you...everything.

DUSSANDER

Boy, it's not my fault your grades have

fallen.

TODD

Don't be so sure.

DUSSANDER

Please, you don't spend that much time here.

I hardly think--

TODD

(quickly, as if confessing something)

I can't study anymore.

TODD

(with difficulty)

I try.  But it's...  different now.  I sit in

front of my books and start thinking about...

about corpses, and electrified fences and

people getting strangled with piano wire.

All that crap you tell me.  The next thing I

know it's after midnight.  I sit in class

like a zombie, ...useless.  But that's not

the half of it.  Check out the letter.

DUSSANDER

(reading letter)

'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, this note is to

suggest that we have a group conference

concerning Todd's first semester grades.  In

light of his previous good work in this

school, the sudden deterioration in his

grades suggest a specific problem which

should be addressed before his academic

advancement is jeopardized permanently.  Such

a problem can often be solved by a frank and

open discussion.  I am ready to work out a

time for us to meet.  In a case such as this,

earlier is usually better.  Sincerely yours,

Edward French.'  Who is this Edward French,

the headmaster?

TODD

French?  Fuck no.  He's a stupid guidance

counselor.

DUSSANDER

Guidance counselor?  What is that?

TODD

He guides and he counsels.  You read the

fucking note.  Do you realize I could have to

go to summer school?  Me, in there with all

those fuck-ups.  I do not want to go to

summer school.

DUSSANDER

Or to the reformatory.

TODD

What did you say?

DUSSANDER

Boy, ...you have a far greater problem than

your

school grades

.  Before you speak to me

about what they will "get out of you",

remember the facts. ...Seventy thousand

people died at Patin.  Have you forgotten

that?  To the world at large I am the most

despicable of criminals, a monster.  Do you

think I would stand aside and let you turn me

in so easily?  Without a fight?  Is your

American self-confidence

so bloated

that you

have never once realized you are an accessory

to my crimes.  You have criminal knowledge of

an illegal alien, and have not reported it.

Don't you see that?  And if I'm caught, I

will tell the world all about you.  When the

reporters put their microphones in my face it

will be your name I'll repeat over and over

again.  Todd Bowden, yes that's his name.

How long?... oh, for months, almost a year.

He wanted to know everything...  That's how

he put it, yes -

everything

.

TODD

They'd never believe you.

DUSSANDER

Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's a gamble.  How

would you explain all those books you were

reading to me?  My eyes are not what they

were but I can still read fine print.  I can

prove it.

TODD

So what? I'd say you tricked me.

DUSSANDER

Why would I do that?

TODD

For friendship, because you're lonely and had

no one in your life.  No jury would take your

word over mine.  A Nazi?  Forget it.  Just

get it out of your head.  You can't threaten

me and you can't scare me.  What you can do

is find me a pencil.

DUSSANDER

A pencil, what for?

TODD

That will take care of the report card, I

think.  About that fucking letter, I don't

know.

TODD (CONT'D)

Fuck...  come on, a pencil.  A sharp one.

With an eraser.

DUSSANDER

Will this do?

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Tell me, does this French know your parents

in a social way?

TODD

Him?  Fuck, no.  They wouldn't mix with a

geek like him.

DUSSANDER

How about professionally?  Has he ever called

them before?

TODD

No.  I've never needed it.  Why?

DUSSANDER

I have an idea.  It will require you to make

one phone call.

FRENCH

Mr. Bowden?

DUSSANDER

Mr. French, a pleasure.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

My, those are some... colorful shoes.

FRENCH

To you, sir, I'm sure they seem quite out of

the ordinary.  But when it is your job to get

confused sixteen year-olds to open up to you,

you take whatever steps you need.  Please

have a seat.

DUSSANDER

And the shoes work?

FRENCH

They seem to help, believe it or not.  Well,

I thank you for coming down, Mr.  Bowden, but

I'll be frank with you...

DUSSANDER

Yes, please do.

FRENCH

The fact that you're here and not Todd's

parents tells me a great deal.

DUSSANDER

I'm sure.  My son and his wife asked me to

come in and discuss this sorry business with

you, Mr.  French.  Todd is a good boy, believe

me.  This trouble with his grades is only

temporary.

FRENCH

It's all right.

(pulls an ashtray from desk

drawer)

There's no smoking on school grounds, but if

it will make you more comfortable, I'll never

tell.

DUSSANDER

A terrible habit, but thank you.

(lights up)

I suppose I should begin by informing you

that my son and my daughter-in-law are having

troubles at home.  Rather bad troubles, I

should think.

FRENCH

I appreciate your candor.

DUSSANDER

(leaning in)

The mother drinks.

FRENCH

Oh.

DUSSANDER

Yes.  The boy has told me that he has come

home on two occasions and has found her

sprawled out on the kitchen table.  He knows

how my son feels about her drinking and so on

these occasions he has put dinner in the oven

himself and forced enough black coffee down

his mother's throat so that she will at least

be awake when Richard gets home.

FRENCH

That's bad.  Has Mrs. Bowden thought about

getting professional help for her problem?

DUSSANDER

The boy has tried to persuade her, but she is

far too ashamed, I think.  If she was given a

little time...  You understand?

FRENCH

Of course.  Your son... Todd's father...

DUSSANDER

He is not without blame, believe me.  The

hours he works.  The meals he has missed.

They take a toll on a family.  I was raised

to believe that a man's family came before

his work or anything else.  I tried to teach

my son that... but --

FRENCH

There's only so much we can teach our kids,

Mr. Bowden.  ...What about Monica's mother or

father?  Couldn't they talk to her?

DUSSANDER

Her mother, Sabrina, lives in a nursing home

in Florida.  I'm afraid after her husband

died she lost her will to live.

FRENCH

Probably not the best person for Monica to

speak to.

DUSSANDER

Indeed.

FRENCH

Mr. Bowden, I don't have to remind you, I'm

sure, of Todd's stellar academic record.

National Merit Scholar finalist, Academic

All-Stars.

DUSSANDER

Yes.  I keep his certificates on the wall of

my store.  I run a small bookstore in San

Remo.

FRENCH

(glancing at folder on desk)

Yes, I see that.  Anyway, Todd is, and I hate

to phrase it this way, but he's one of the

ones worth fighting for.  He's a special kid,

we both know that.  But If Todd's grades

don't improve drastically and quickly...

he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms.

Summer school would just be the beginning.

His whole college acceptance schedule would

be thrown way off course.  The good schools

won't know what to make of him.  I'm sure

he'd hate that and so would you.

DUSSANDER

Of course.

FRENCH

So let's get to the bottom line, shall we?

What I'm proposing is some family counselling

at the Counselling Center downtown.

Everything is in confidence, of course.  A

man in charge down there, Harry Shumacher, is

a good friend of mine.  I think Todd and his

parents should go see him together.  It might

be difficult for Todd to go to his parents

with this; I think you should do it.  Maybe

we can get everybody on track by the end of

the next quarter.  It will be tough, but not

impossible.

DUSSANDER

I'm not sure that would be the best thing for

the boy.  The parents might resent him if I

took them that proposal right now.  Things

are very delicate.  To swing the scale too

far in the wrong direction might cause more

harm than good.  The boy has promised to work

harder in his studies.  He is most concerned

by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than

you might expect.  He has his mind set on

attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and

does not wish to see his plans altered.

FRENCH

Yes, well --

DUSSANDER

Also, the parents would resent me.  Monica

already thinks I meddle too much in her

affairs.

FRENCH

I have a great deal of experience in these

matters, Mr. Bowden.  And please understand

that my interest in your son's marital

problems begins and ends with the effect they

are having on Todd.  And right now I think

they are having quite an effect.  I really

think counselling is in order here.

DUSSANDER

Allow me to make a counter proposal.  You

have, I believe, a system for warning parents

of poor grades?

FRENCH

Yes, Interpretation of Progress cards.  IOP

cards.  The kids call them flunk card.  They

only get them when their grades in a class

fall below the seventy percent.  That means a

"D" or an "F".  Why?

DUSSANDER

And they are sent out when?

FRENCH

Mid-quarter.  That's about three weeks into

the new marking period.

DUSSANDER

Allowing for Christmas break, the next time

they are sent out will be in late January,

correct?

FRENCH

Yes, that's right.

DUSSANDER

Good.  Then what I suggest is this...

TODD

You what?

DUSSANDER

I told him you were getting back on track by

your own accord.  I gave him my word.  If you

get even one flunk card--

TODD

Are you out of your fucking mind?  I'm going

to get three or four flunk cards.  I failed

an economics test today, so there's another

one.

DUSSANDER

Boy, it was the best I could do without

arousing suspicion.

TODD

I could have done better myself --

DUSSANDER

Well you didn't, did you?  This is the way it

is and now you are upset because the only way

you can make things right is to work.

TODD

You're insane.  I'm upset because it can't be done.

DUSSANDER

It can.  And it will.  You will work.

TODD

I don't take orders from you.  Maybe you've

forgotten --

DUSSANDER

(turning on him)

Listen, boy.  Before today it was possible,

just barely possible, that you could have

denounced me and come out clean yourself.

The way your nerves have been lately I don't

think so, but never mind that.  It was - at

least technically possible.  But now things

have changed.  Today I impersonated your

grandfather, one Victor Bowden.  And it was

you who arranged the meeting.  What would

people make of that?  If things come out

now... perhaps you were right, your age and a

good attorney might keep you out of jail, but

you would be humiliated, boy, publicly.  You

would be infamous.  Your parents too.  Do you

know what such a scandal would do to them?

To you?  Think about that.

TODD

You fucker.

DUSSANDER

It's a done deal, boy.  If you don't like it,

you can discuss it at family counselling.

TODD

God!  I wish... I wish --

DUSSANDER

Never mind your wishes.  Your wishes make me

sick.  All I want to hear is that you

understand the situation.

TODD

Look, you gotta believe me.  There is no way

in hell that I can pull myself out of a half

year slide in a couple of weeks.  I wish I

could, but we're just going to have to think

of something else.

DUSSANDER

Boy, the time for discussion is over.  This

is the way it is.  You are going to work.

And I am going to be right here with you.

TODD

What are you talking about?

DUSSANDER (V.O.)

You are going to spend the rest of this

quarter, all of your vacation and the first

three weeks of January studying.  During your

free period you will study.  During lunch,

you will study.  And after school and on

weekends you will come here and do the same.

TODD (V.O.)

Not here, at home.

DUSSANDER (V.O.)

No.  At home you will dawdle, you will talk

on the telephone, watch TV.  Here, I can make

sure that nothing distracts you from your

studies.

DUSSANDER'S DREAM #3

: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT

TODD

Their light is still on.  I'll get out on

your side.  Don't say anything.

TODD

Shhh.

TODD (CONT'D)

Don't move.

TODD

Fuck.

ARCHIE (O.S.)

Hey, kid, you having some trouble?

TODD

No.  I got it... thanks.

ARCHIE

That case maybe you could loan me a dollar.

Help out a Vietnam vet? How 'bout it?

TODD

I... I don't know... I don't think so.

ARCHIE

C'mon, you got something for me.  I know you

do.

TODD

Well, maybe... I have to check.

ARCHIE

See, I got to get up to L.A.  Got a job

waiting for me up there.

TODD

I thought I did have a couple of quarters...

ARCHIE

You know,

(his voice drops)

For a dollar I'll give you a blow job.  Take

you right up there where it's still dry.  You

never had so good, kid.  You'll come your

brains out.

PROXMIRE

Our illustrious administration, in its quest

to make my job as difficult as possible, has

decided that home room teachers are now

responsible for handing IOP cards for all

your classes.  So for those of you getting

flunk cards, you'll find them attached to

last week's exam.

DUSSANDER

Well, this calls for a celebration, no?

TODD

Look, I guess I owe a lot of this to you.

I'm not proud of it, but it's true.

DUSSANDER

(eyeing him cautiously)

Your gratitude humbles me.

(pause)

How about some Ritz crackers and Velveeta?

TODD

Sure, what the hell.

DUSSANDER

I would have expected you to be doing back

flips down the hallway after such good news.

You are so quiet.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Today, I think, I give you the day off from

studying.  How's that?  How about one of my

stories instead?  I still have a few good

ones saved up.

TODD

I don't care.  Whatever you want.

DUSSANDER

Let's see.  I could tell you about the

special soap we made.  Or there is always the

story of how I escaped from Berlin after I

was foolish enough to go back.  That was a

close one, I promise you.

TODD

Anything, really.

DUSSANDER

No, none of these I think.  You don't seem to

be in the mood.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

I think today I will tell you the story of an

old man who was afraid.  He was afraid of a

certain young boy who was, in a queer way,

his friend.  The boy proved to be a very good

student, but perhaps not in the way his

mother or his teachers had envisioned.  At

first the old man disliked the boy intensely,

but then he grew to... to enjoy the boy's

company.  Of course, there was still a great

deal of distrust between them.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Each knew something that other wanted to keep

secret.  But over time, the old man began to

feel that things were changing.  He felt his

hold on the boy slipping away from him.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

So.  One sleepless night the old man got out

of bed and wrote down the story of his

involvement with the boy.  Everything he

could remember, from the first day forward.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

When he finished his hand was stinging from

arthritis but he felt good for the first time

in weeks.  He felt safe.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

He climbed back into bed and slept until it

was time for General Hospital.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

On the following day the old man put on his

best suit and went down to one of the local

banks and rented a safety deposit box.  The

bank officer explained to the old man that he

would have a key and the bank would have a

key.  To open the box both keys would be

needed.  No one but the old man could use the

old man's key without a signed, notarized

letter of permission from the old man

himself.  With one exception.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

That exception is made in the event of the

box-holder's death.

TODD

Then what?

DUSSANDER

Then the box is opened in the presence of a

bank official and a representative of the

Internal Revenue Service.  The contents of

the box are inventoried.  In this case they

will find only a twelve-page document.  Non-

taxable... but highly interesting.

TODD

You can't... you can't do that.

DUSSANDER

My boy, it is already done.

TODD

But... Christ!  Look at you.  You could go at

any time.

TODD

Then there is nothing for me.

DUSSANDER

But there is.  As the years go by, as I get

closer to the grave, your hold on me will

become worth less and less.  A man five, ten

years older than I worries more about his

ailing heart than being extradited to Israel.

And there will come a day - if I live long

enough - when I decide what you know no

longer matters.  Then, and only then, I will

destroy my document.

TODD

But... but so many things can happen to you

in between.  Accidents.  Sickness.  You could

slip in the shower, for Christ's sake...

DUSSANDER

Que sera, sera...  Whatever will be, will

be... The future's not ours to see... Que

sera, sera...

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

My dear boy, I see you thinking about it,

even now.  It is in your eyes.  Killing me.

It would take only a flick of a knife.  Or

maybe push me down the steps, make it look

like an accident?  I am old.  You are strong.

You are angry.  Good assets for killing.  But

there is something missing...

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

To have some one in your control.  To have

them know that they are alive because you

have not decided to the contrary.  Do you

have that power?  Ask yourself.  It is no

easy question.  I think you know that.

TODD

You know this means we're through.  You won't

be seeing me around here anymore.

DUSSANDER

No, I suppose I won't.

TODD

I'm never coming here again.

DUSSANDER

And so it comes to an end.  Here.

TODD

What are you doing?

DUSSANDER

A drink.  To our lives together, the

beginning... and the end.

TODD

I think you should fuck yourself.

DUSSANDER

My boy, don't you see that we are fucking

each other?

FADE TO BLACK.

ARCHIE

(leaning over)

I notice the kid don't come around no more.

DUSSANDER

What?

ARCHIE

Little blond-hair boy. ...What's the matter,

you ain't his friend no more?

DUSSANDER

You mistake me for somebody else. ...Pardon

me, my bus is coming.

ARCHIE

Damn... Cuban high heels.  Nice ones, too.

ARCHIE

I ain't seen a pair like that since I was in

Havana.

(talking louder because of the

bus)

That's the only place you can get'em.  Can't

get'em exported... Government don't let you.

SECRETARY

Go in, Todd.  They're waiting for you.

MORGAN

Have a seat, Todd.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

I see from your record and from what Mr.

French tells me that after a minor slip up

last semester you're right back on course.

Straight A's for the quarter so far.  And I

hear your little slip didn't bother the folks

up at Stanford too much either.

FRENCH

A good break for you, Todd.

MORGAN

Looks like that little talk with your...

(looks at file)

grandfather... really helped.  Well, we don't

want to keep you too long.

(to French)

You tell him.

FRENCH

Well, it seems Sally Chong didn't do to well

in A.P. biology.

MORGAN

She failed it.

FRENCH

I'm afraid so.  She refused to take part in

the fetal pig dissection.  The teacher begged

her to drop the class, but Sally thought she

could pass anyway.

MORGAN

Stubborn girl... What we're telling you, son,

is that because Sally Chang -

FRENCH

Chong.

MORGAN

Because Sally Chong wouldn't hack up a baby

pig, you snuck by her in the rankings.  So if

you can keep your grades up for two more

months -- any reason that shouldn't happen?

TODD

No.

MORGAN

Then you'll make valedictorian, Todd.

Congratulations.

FRENCH

Congratulations, Todd.

FRENCH

Todd, you really should be proud of yourself.

To tell you the truth, I'm amazed you pulled

it off.

TODD

Thanks, I guess.

FRENCH

I was glad to hear you made varsity baseball.

I spoke to the coach.  He says your coming

along real well.

TODD

Thanks.

FRENCH

It's turning out to be a good year for you.

TODD

Yeah.

FRENCH

Todd, wait.

FRENCH (CONT'D)

Todd, you've got a lot of good things going

on right now.  You should be enjoying

yourself.

TODD

I am.

FRENCH

How are things at home?

TODD

Look, things with my parents were bad for a

while.  But they're doing a lot better.

Thanks for your concern, really.  I should

get back to class.

FRENCH

(unconvinced)

Okay, Todd.  I know this isn't the place to

talk about this.  But my door is always open...

TODD

I know.  Thanks.

FRENCH

And it's going to stay open.

JOEY

Hey there.

TODD

Hey.

JOEY

I... ah, I heard about Stanford.  I heard a

couple of weeks ago actually. ...Congrats.

TODD

Thanks.

JOEY

I got into school to.  Long Beach.  It's no

Stanford, but...

TODD

No, no... that's good, Joe.

JOEY

Well, ...I just wanted to say hi.  Here let

me get that.

JOEY (CONT'D)

What do you have in there?

TODD

You busy now?

JOEY

Uhh...

TODD

Come with me.  Hop on.

JOEY

Hop on?  I have a car now, Todd.

TODD

You can't drive where we're going.

JOEY

This is so cool.

TODD

Point it over here.  That's the middle

school.  You can see right into our old class

room.

JOEY

Oh yeah... But I still don't see what you

need the rest of it for.  Doesn't your Dad

notice?

TODD

He hasn't yet.

JOEY

Yet?... Jesus, Todd.

TODD

And over here, that's your dad's office.  And

there's the old drive-in.

JOEY

Here.  Take it.

TODD

It's such a rush, you know?... To be up here.

Don't you feel it?  So high above them they

never know we're here.  It's like an ant

farm.  We're the gods on Mt. Olympus, Joey.

They can't see us, they can't hear us, but

every so often we can make them feel us.

Just so they never forget.  Look...

TODD (CONT'D)

There goes a future track star.  There goes a

judge.  A mom and her two kids.  A policeman.

That one's a school teacher, that one's a

drug dealer... You see, Joey, it doesn't

matter.  It doesn't matter how smart you are

...or how many grades you skip.  There's

always someone who can take it all away.  The

right person snaps their fingers... and it's

done.

JOEY

Todd, I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna... walk home.

JOEY (CONT'D)

Todd...

ARCHIE

I can do that.  I can help you carry those.

ARCHIE (CONT'D)

You don't gotta be afraid.  I can carry those.

DUSSANDER

I don't need any help. ...Excuse me.

ARCHIE

Hey, I ain't a bad guy.  You don't gotta

worry.  I'm a veteran.  I just want--

DUSSANDER

(snapping at him)

What?  What do you want?  Why do you bother me?

ARCHIE

(plaintively)

You got a nice face.

DUSSANDER

No I don't.

ARCHIE

Look, we're practically neighbors.  I stay

right over there most nights.

(pointing across the street)

I see you walking down the street.  I come up

to help.  It's called being

neighborly

.

DUSSANDER

Piss off.

ARCHIE

Ain't no reason to be rude.  You see, I know

something about you. ...I know your a nice

guy.  I'm nice too, ...just like the kid.

DUSSANDER

I see.

ARCHIE

And I know you got some bourbon in these

bags.  I ain't ashamed to say I could use a

drink about now.  But I don't need no charity.

If you want to invite me in, like a friend,

we could have a nice drink.

DUSSANDER

A drink.

ARCHIE

That's what I'm saying.

DUSSANDER

You smell like a toilet.

ARCHIE

Maybe you let me use your shower.  But first

a drink.  After that I'll do anything you say.

ARCHIE

Yeah, this is nice.  Real nice.

DUSSANDER

Let me take those.

(takes the bags)

Right this way.

MONICA

I guess your parents don't need a graduation

announcement.

DICK

No.

TODD

Grandma and Grandpa aren't coming?

MONICA

(to Dick)

I thought you told him.

DICK

Christ, I forgot.  Todd, my aunt Patty, Dad's

sister, died on Wednesday.  Mom and Dad have

to drive up to Fresno to settle her estate.

We can't ask Dad to drive six hours each way

for graduation.

MONICA

If we ask them, they'll do it.

DICK

That's why.  You understand, don't you, Todd?

TODD

Of course, Dad.  It's all right.  Tell

Grandpa I'll spend the week with him and

Grandma when they get back.

MONICA

What about Mr. Denker?  I almost forgot about

him.

TODD

No, He won't want to come.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Ah-ah.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

I believe we need another bottle, my friend.

ARCHIE

Well if you're offering, I'm accepting.

DUSSANDER

No trouble at all.  Now where is my bottle

opener?  Ah, here it is.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Why don't you drink mine?

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

You don't mind do you?

ARCHIE

No. I don't mind. ...Maybe in the morning -

everything goes okay - you could let me have

ten dollars.

DUSSANDER

Perhaps.

ARCHIE

Maybe even twenty.

DUSSANDER

Perhaps.  We shall see.

ARCHIE

You can relax, you know, I've done this before.

DUSSANDER

It's all right.  So have I.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

What a mess.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Oh my God.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Ein... Zwei... Drei...

DICK

Monica... how long did we rent those jet skis

in Hawaii?

MONICA

About two hours.  Why?

DICK

This receipt says we had two jet skis for

twenty-three hours a piece.  The bill is

fifteen hundred dollars.  Didn't you look at

the receipt before you signed it?

TODD

Way to go, Mom.

MONICA

That bill was written in Japanese.  I told

you that.

DICK

Numbers are numbers, Monica, in any language.

MONICA

That guy didn't speak a word of English.  I

told you not to rent from him.

MONICA (CONT'D)

I'll get it.

DICK

That's not the point.  You should always read

the bill before you sign.  I've told you that

a hundred times.

(to Todd)

Fifteen hundred dollars.

TODD

Maybe it's in yen.

DICK

Hey, maybe you're right.

MONICA

Todd, it's Mr.  Denker.  He sounds excited

about something.  You better speak to him.

TODD

(into phone)

Mr. Denker?

DUSSANDER

Come over right away, boy.  I'm having a

heart attack, a bad one, I think.

TODD

Gee, that sounds exciting, Mr. Denker, but I

was studying for my trig final --

DUSSANDER

I understand that you cannot talk, but you

can listen.  I cannot call 911...  at least

not yet.  There is quite a mess here.  I need

help... and that means you need help.

TODD

Well if you put it that way --

DUSSANDER

Tell your parents I've had a letter, an

important letter, and I need you to read it

to me.

TODD

Yeah, sure.  I'll be right there.

DUSSANDER

Now we see what you are made of, boy.

TODD

Bye.

(hangs up)

I've got to run over to Mr. Denker's for a

minute.

MONICA

Is everything all right?

TODD

Oh, he just got a letter from a nephew in

Hamburg or Dusseldorf or one of those places.

DICK

I thought his family was killed in the war.

TODD

So did he.  That's why he sounded excited.  I

shouldn't be too long.  I'll take your car,

Mom?

MONICA

I don't know, you have a final tomorrow.

TODD

I know, I was almost finished studying anyway.

DICK

Don't be gone too long, Todd.

TODD

See you in a bit.

TODD

What the fuck...?

TODD (CONT'D)

Where are you bleeding?... wake up.

TODD (CONT'D)

Wake up, goddamnit!

TODD (CONT'D)

I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack.

DUSSANDER

It's not my blood, for Christ's sake.

TODD

What did you say?

DUSSANDER

It was self-defense, boy.  Go downstairs.

You'll see what needs to be done.

TODD

Fuck you.  I'm not going down there.  What

happened?  What did you do?

TODD (CONT'D)

What the hell is this?

TODD

Jesus Fucking Christ.

TODD

Open the fucking door!  Right now.  Right

now!

DUSSANDER

You give me no choice, boy.

TODD

What are you doing?  Open the door.

DUSSANDER

If you won't help me, then I'll make you help

me.  If you don't, we are finished.

TODD

Fuck you, old man.  This is your problem.  I

didn't do this.  Open the door!

DUSSANDER

Enough.  Enough.  Enough!  If you don't stop

screaming like a fucking school girl I'm

going to...

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

Now listen to me, boy, very carefully.  If

you don't help me, I'm going to die here.

And if I die, there is no Stanford for you.

There is no scholarship.  There is jail.  My

document...

TODD

Fuck your document.  I got nothing to do with

this.  Don't make it sound like I do.  I came

here, I saw this shit, and now I'm getting

the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm gonna

tell the police.

DUSSANDER

Why not tell them the truth?  Tell them I

locked you in the cellar.  Tell them I

wouldn't let you out until you buried the

body.

TODD

I'm not listening to this.

DUSSANDER

You must be at the window, yes?  As you can

see I had it barred a few years ago.  A bad

element started to move into the

neighborhood, you know how it is.

TODD (O.S.)

Fuck.

DUSSANDER (O.S.)

We are wasting time now, boy.

(switches to a loud whisper)

Come back to the door.  You are not going to

find anything down there to help you.

TODD

(to himself)

Oh really?

TODD

Get out of the way.

TODD

Stop it!  Stop it!

DUSSANDER

What are you doing, boy?  It's not going to

work, whatever it is.

TODD

Fuck this.

TODD (CONT'D)

I mean it get the fuck away from me.

DUSSANDER

Hello?

TODD

Where's the fucking pinesol?

TODD (CONT'D)

Rags.  I need rags.

DUSSANDER

Cellar.  Under the stairs.

TODD

I ought to run this through your chest, you

know that?

DUSSANDER

It couldn't hurt more than a heart attack.

TODD

Christ, my parents are going to freak.

DUSSANDER

Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

What are you thinking about?

TODD

Fuck off.

TODD

Your pants are okay.  The shoes... no.

TODD (CONT'D)

Put this on.

DUSSANDER

Is that my undershirt?

DUSSANDER

Hurry up, for God's sake.

TODD

Don't you die on me, you old bastard.  Not

now.

DUSSANDER

I think we're okay.

TODD

Me too.

DUSSANDER

Call an ambulance.

TODD

The key.

DUSSANDER

What are you talking about?

TODD

The safety deposit box.  I want the key...

DUSSANDER

For God's sake, boy...

TODD

I want the key and I want to know where the

bank is.

DUSSANDER

Hillcrest Savings on Domingo Avenue.  The key

is behind the clock on the mantle piece.

TODD

Sign this.

DUSSANDER

What for?

TODD

Sign it.

TODD

No!  At the bottom...

neatly

.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

911 emergency.  Do you need an ambulance?

TODD

Yes.  It's my friend, Mr. Du--

TODD (CONT'D)

Denker.  He had a heart attack.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Is he conscious?

TODD

Yeah, he's awake.  I'm really scared.  The

address is 9 --

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

We have the address here.  The ambulance is

on the way.  It should take about ten

minutes.  I'll stay on the line with you --

TODD

No.  I have to call my parents.  Just send

the ambulance --

TODD (CONT'D)

It smells too clean in here.

TODD (CONT'D)

(offering)

Cigarette?

TODD (CONT'D)

Mommy, it's me.  Let me talk to Dad.

MONICA (V.O.)

What is it?

TODD

Just let me talk to him.

MONICA (V.O.)

Hold on --

DICK (V.O.)

Todd, what's wrong.

TODD

Mr. Denker had a heart attack.

DICK (V.O.)

Jesus.  Is he conscious?

TODD

Yeah, he's awake.

DICK (V.O.)

Thank God.  Todd, call an ambulance.

TODD

I did.  They're on the way.

DICK (V.O.)

All right, son.  Don't touch him.  I'll be

there in five minutes.

TODD

Okay.

TODD (CONT'D)

Fuck!

DUSSANDER

What?  What is it?

TODD

The letter.  Where is the goddamn letter?  I

told my parents I came over to read you a

letter from Germany.

DUSSANDER

A letter.  Yes, we'll say it's from Willi

Frankel --

TODD

We need a letter.  I told them it was your

nephew, I think.

DUSSANDER

My bedroom.  Look in the dresser.  Second, no

third, drawer... from the top.  There is a

small wooden box.  You will have to break it

open.  I lost the key.  There are letters,

very old ones.  From a friend.  All in

German.  None of them are signed or dated.  A

page or two will be fine.

TODD

Are you crazy?  I don't read German, you numb

fuck.

DUSSANDER

Why would Willi write me in English?  If you

were to read me the letter in German, I would

understand even though you would not.  Your

pronunciation would be terrible, but I could

manage --

TODD

All right.  All right.

TODD

Goddamn you, come out.

TODD

Dad.

TODD

He started laughing at something in the

letter.  I don't know what it was, it's in

German.

PARAMEDIC

Well, we'll take care of him now.  We're

going to take him to St. Luke's.  It's a good

thing you called when you did.  You saved his

life.

DICK

You did real good, son.

(looking around the room, as if

searching for something)

You did real good...

TODD

C'mon.  Let's make sure he gets checked in

all right.

NURSE

He needs to rest now.  You can come back

tomorrow after ten.

DAVID

I'll be back in the morning with the girls.

BEN

I can't wait to see them.

NURSE

(to Ben)

The doctor will be in to see you in a few

minutes.

BEN

Thank you.

BEN (CONT'D)

My nephew, David.

BEN (CONT'D)

His parents died when he was very young.  He

is like a son to me.  I have no children of

my own.

DUSSANDER

I see.

BEN

David is very protective of me.  Of course, I

don't mind.  I enjoy his company.  A few

years ago he started working with me at the

university.  I teach chemistry.  My name is

Ben, by the way.

DUSSANDER

Arthur.

BEN

A pleasure, Arthur.  What do you do?

DUSSANDER

I'm retired.

BEN

These tubes in my arm.  No one said they

would itch like this.

DUSSANDER

You will find, in time, you don't notice.

BEN

Well, we'll see.  Looks like I'll be here for

a while.  I didn't want to alarm my nephew

just yet, but this break in my leg...  well,

we'll see what the doctor says.

DUSSANDER

Yes, of course.  But for now, you must

forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy.

Do not be offended if I fall asleep.

BEN

Don't be offended if I keep talking anyway.

It beats wondering if I'm ever going to walk

again.  I tell you, my friend, the ways of

God are not meant to be understood.

TODD

He's really sick. ...Please.

BANK CLERK

I sure hope your granddaddy feels better.

You can bring that in here.

TODD

Son of a bitch.

DUSSANDER

You shouldn't have.

TODD

They're from my mother.

TODD (CONT'D)

Here.

TODD (CONT'D)

Everything else I burned.

DUSSANDER

I had to protect myself from you, boy.

DUSSANDER (CONT'D)

I suspect that we shall never see each other

again.

TODD

No, I don't think we will.

TODD (CONT'D)

Well, I better go.

DUSSANDER

Wait, boy... There is something I want to ask

you.

TODD

What?

DUSSANDER

...Was it like you thought?

TODD

I should go.

DUSSANDER

Perhaps... perhaps I could persuade you to

wait here just until I fall asleep.  This

medicine makes me quite woozy... please.

BEN

Excuse me, young man.

BEN (CONT'D)

You're a fine boy to visit your grandfather

like that.

TODD

Thanks.  But he's just a friend.

BEN

Is that right?  Well, you are a good friend

to him.  Tell me, is he bad off?  He doesn't

talk much.

TODD

The doctors say he'll be out soon.

BEN

That is good news, indeed.  Tell me, from the

way he speaks I'd guess he's been

naturalized, like me.  Is he?

TODD

He's from Germany... From Essen.  Do you know

that town?

BEN

I was only in Germany once.  I'm Polish.

Originally, I mean, I'm from Radom.  I wonder

if he was in the war.

TODD

I really couldn't say.

BEN

It doesn't matter, I suppose.  It was a long

time ago, the war.  Soon in this country we

may have a president born after the war was

over.  How about that?

TODD

I'm sure you're right.

BEN

Your friend is lucky to have you.  A great

man once said, 'No man is an island entire of

itself.'

TODD

John Donne.  Take care, sir.

TODD (CONT'D)

Good-bye.

BEN

Good-bye.

BLACK.

DUSSANDER

Where's the nurse?

DARREN

My name is Darren.  I'll be taking care of

you from now on.  I'll tell the doctor you've

woken up.

DARREN

Did you need something?

DUSSANDER

What is going on here?  Where is Ben?

DARREN

Mr. Krauss has been moved.  I'm going to give

you something.  It will help you sleep.

DUSSANDER

I don't want it.  Who is that man?

DARREN

Your surgery was a success.  Just try to

relax.

FADE TO BLACK.

WEISKOPF (O.S.)

(in German)

Wake up.  Wake up, old man.

DUSSANDER (in German)

Are you speaking to me?

WEISKOPF

(back in English)

No one else is here.

WEISKOPF (CONT'D)

Mr. Krauss is recuperating elsewhere.  Are

you awake now, Dussander?

DUSSANDER

Yes, of course, but you seem to have me

confused with someone else.  My name is

Arthur Denker.  Perhaps you want a different

room --

WEISKOPF

My name is Weiskopf.  You are Kurt Dussander.

DUSSANDER

I know no one by that name.  Shall I ring for

the nurse?

WEISKOPF

The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss.

He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin.

You were responsible for the death of his

wife and two daughters.  His identification

of you was quite specific.  I'm sure his

reward from my government will help offset

the burden of his broken leg.

DUSSANDER

My name is Arthur Denker.  I am an American--

WEISKOPF

Please don't bother.  Your papers will not

stand up to serious examination and you know

it.

RICHLER

We have all we need here, Isaac.

DUSSANDER

Who are you men?  What are your names?

RICHLER

My name is Richler, FBI.  This is Detective

Getty from the Orange County Sheriff's

Department.

WEISKOPF

And I think you know who I work for.  When

you get your strength back, you will be

moved.  Until then, this entire ward will be

under surveillance.  You can expect to be in

Tel Aviv by the end of the summer.

TODD

The road ahead reveals itself, uh, God, no.

The road ahead... grrrr, The fucking road

ahead.

MONICA

Todd?

TODD

Huh?

MONICA

What are you doing there in the dark?

TODD

Oh, ...working.

TODD

Mr. French.

FRENCH

Hello, Todd.  It's your big day, isn't it?

FRENCH (CONT'D)

These must be your parents.

(extends hand)

Hi, Ed French.  It's good to finally meet

you.

DICK

Dick Bowden, nice to meet you.  This is my

wife, Monica.

MONICA

Are you one of Todd's teachers?

FRENCH

No.  I'm his guidance counsellor.

WOMAN

Monica, I thought that was you.

TODD

(to French)

That's our cue.

FRENCH

(to Dick)

It was nice meeting you.

DICK

You too.

(to Todd)

Good luck, son.

FRENCH

I'll talk to you and your wife after the

ceremony.

TASHA

Thy sacred emblems to partake -

Thy consecrated bread to take

And thine immortal wine!

MORGAN

Thank you, Miss Little for that superb

invocation.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

And now it gives me great pleasure to

introduce a young man who's academic

achievement at this institution stands as

testament to the power of hard work and

determination.  Todd had a tough time a few

months ago, so by God, he buckled down, hit

the books, and pulled himself through it.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

Ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty,

here to deliver the student remembrance for

the class of 1985, this year's valedictorian,

Todd Bowden.

TODD

We all have dreams that we carry with us.

Perhaps it is a dream of prosperity, or

happiness.  But now, so early in our lives,

it seems that all we should ask for is to be

at peace with the world, because only then

can we be at peace with ourselves.

TODD (V.O.)

We learn from our education that we are the

master's of our own destinies.  We learn what

it is that separates us from the others, why

we are special.

RICHLER

What about this?

WEISKOPF

Yes.  All photographs.

GETTY

You boys better come down to the cellar.

You're not going to believe this.

TODD (V.O.)

Each of us have unique talents and interests

unlike those of anyone else.  The challenge

now, as we stand at the doorway to adulthood,

is to channel our abilities into our goals.

TODD (O.C.)

We forge our own paths.  Our education is but

a stepping stone to the world.

TODD (CONT'D)

Our.. Our true destinies await us.  There we

become the...

TODD (CONT'D)

There we become the men and women that will

make a difference.  But we must take away

from this place a sense of purpose for

ourselves.  We now begin to see the road

ahead.  It is a road from which we cannot

veer.

MORGAN

Andrew Woodman... Donald Young... Karmisha

Youngblood... David Zedek... Kyle Zuckerman.

The graduating class of 1985.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

Now we invite all the friends and parents to

join the students and faculty in the main

courtyard for refreshments.

MONICA

Honey.

TODD

Mom, I don't feel so good.

MONICA

What's wrong?

TODD

I don't know, I feel like I'm going to pass

out.  Can we go home?

AGNES

You looked real good up there, Todd.

DICK

Don't you want to see your buddies?

TODD

I want to go, Dad.  Right now.

RICHLER

Todd, my name is Dan Richler.  I'm a special

agent with the FBI.  This is my associate, Dr.

Weiskopf.

WEISKOPF

Hello.

DICK

What kind of doctor are you?

WEISKOPF

I'm a school teacher.

RICHLER

Dr. Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic

Institute in Munich.  He is assisting the

Israeli government in certain matters.  He is

here today, only as an observer.

RICHLER (CONT'D)

Thanks for calling us up, Mr. Bowden.  You

saved us the trouble of tracking through the

911 records.

DICK

Actually, it was Todd's idea to call.  He

thought... we thought there might be some way

we could help your investigation.

RICHLER

Todd, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to hear

about your involvement with Dussander... but

you knew him as Arthur Denker, right?

TODD

Yeah.  I never knew of that other name till I

saw it in the paper.

RICHLER

How did you know him?

TODD

I met him at the movies.  Last summer.  ...He

asked me where to pick up the number seven

bus.  He said his eyes weren't too good.

...Will you excuse me for a minute?

MONICA

You okay, honey?

TODD

I just gotta use the bathroom.  I'll be right

back.

MONICA

He's not feeling well.

MONICA (CONT'D)

Can I get you some coffee?

RICHLER

Todd, let me tell you what we're really

interested in here.  You told the admitting

nurse that Denker had a heart attack while

you were reading him a letter.

TODD

That's right.  I was.  That's what I was

doing there.  It was in German but he

insisted I try to read it anyway.  Once or

twice he got pissy about the pronunciation

but I asked him what did he want from me.  I

don't speak German.  Mr. Denker...

Dussander... got really excited at one point.

He yelled out, "Yes, that's what you would do

all right." but I didn't know what he was

talking about.  Then he grabbed his chest.

RICHLER

And that's when you called the ambulance,

right?

TODD

That's right.

RICHLER

Well, this is the part we can't figure out.

The letter itself, Todd... do you remember

what happened to it?

TODD

I guess it was still on the table.  I

couldn't swear to it, but --

DICK

Wait, I saw a letter.  It was in German.  I

didn't think anything of it at the time.

But, yeah, it was on Airmail stationery.

RICHLER

Then it should still be there.  This is our

problem.

DICK

It isn't?

RICHLER

No.

MONICA

Maybe somebody broke in.

RICHLER

Why would somebody break into his house

simply to steal a letter? ...Unless... there

was someone... someone right here in Santo

Donato who would want to protect him for some

reason.  Maybe a close friend, or even

another fugitive.  I know it sounds like a

bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff, but when

Dussander was taken to the hospital, we think

our Mr. X scooted over to the house and

swiped the letter.

TODD

That doesn't make sense.

RICHLER

Why not, Todd?

TODD

Well, if Denk... if he had an old Nazi buddy

in town, why didn't he come over himself and

read the letter to him?  If you could have

heard the way he corrected me at every word--

RICHLER

A good point.  Except maybe this other fellow

is in a wheelchair, or blind.

TODD

Guys that are blind don't normally go

scooting out to steal letters.

RICHLER

(smiling)

True.  Did Dussander have any friends that

you knew of?

TODD

No, not really.

RICHLER

How about phone calls?

TODD

No, I heard his phone ring maybe five or six

times in all the time I knew him.  It was

never anything out of the ordinary.

Salesmen.  Wrong numbers.

RICHLER

Did you ever hear him speak German on those

occasions?

TODD

No.  He hardly ever spoke German.  He always

said he would teach me someday, but he never

got around to it.

WEISKOPF

Did he ever talk about his past?

TODD

Not really.  Little bits, I guess.

MONICA

Well, don't you remember what he told us at

Thanksgiving?

MONICA (CONT'D)

He said he was in college--

DICK

(shutting her up)

Monica.  They don't care what we know, they

care what Todd knows.

RICHLER

Look, I'm sure this whole thing has come as a

terrible shock.  I think we've done enough

for the day.

WEISKOPF

Thank you, Todd.  Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.

DICK

Wait a minute... Agent Richler, before you

go--  Todd's not a suspect in this, is he?  I

mean he's just talking to you, right?

RICHLER

That's right.

DICK

Because Todd always thought he was helping

that old man.  We didn't know any of this

before today.

RICHLER

Mr. Bowden, you and Todd have nothing to

worry about.  I assure you.  Your son has

been a great service to us.  Thank you, Todd.

For now that's all we need.  Our next step is

to turn that house upside down.  We're

bringing in some special teams to look

through everything.  We may come up with

something.  We'll be in touch if we need you.

RICHLER (CONT'D)

Oh, Todd, by the way....

(casually, pulls a photo out of a

folder he is carrying)

Have you ever seen this man before?

TODD

No.

RICHLER

Okay, thanks.

TODD

You'll be back, won't you boys?  Won't you,

Special agent Jackoff.  You

and

the sheeny

professor. ...I know, let's show him an old

army picture, that'll screw him up. ...Fuck

you.

Fuck-You

.

DICK

Everything all right, son?

TODD

Yeah... fine.

DICK

You sure?

TODD

I'm fine, Dad.

DICK

Your mother and I feel terrible... like we...

TODD

It's not your fault.

DICK

You know we love you, don't you?

TODD

I know, Dad.

DICK

Look, ahh, your mother and I are going to go

down and talk to our lawyer.  I don't want

you to worry about a thing.  It's just a

precaution.  I don't trust these cops.  We're

not going to be gone long.

TODD

Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

DICK

Your old man is on top of things, all right?

I am going to take care of this.

TODD

I know, Dad.

DICK

This afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go

do something.  How 'bout it?

TODD

Sure.

TODD

We're okay.  We're okay.  We're

o-kay

.

TODD (CONT'D)

You got to be fucking kidding me.

FRENCH

Hello, Todd.

TODD

Mr. French, what brings you to the wild side

of town?

FRENCH

Todd... I found something troubling in the

morning news.  Are your parents home?

TODD

No.

FRENCH

I know the man in this picture is the man who

came to see me.

TODD

It's sort of a bad time right now.  Why don't

you go home?

FRENCH

I will.  But first I need a couple of things

explained to me.

FRENCH (V.O.)

Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?

TODD

You know, Mr. French, sometimes one thing

just leads to another and before you know

it... things get out of control.

FRENCH

I'm afraid that's not much of an answer,

Todd.  When do you expect your parents home?

TODD

I don't know, Ed.  You want to come in and

wait?  I'll put on a pot of tea.  We'll talk

about old times.

FRENCH

I think you might need some help, Todd.

That's why I'm here.

TODD (V.O.)

You know?  You're right.  I do need help.  I

really do.

FRENCH

Let me help you, Todd.  I want to.  You're

too smart to do anything crazy.

TODD

Can I ask you something, Ed?  You don't mind

if I call you Ed, now that I'm out of your

fucking school, do you?

FRENCH

What?

TODD

You know all this crap you see on TV about

forensics... hairs and fibers, that stuff?

How much of it do think is true and how much

is just bullshit?

TODD (CONT'D)

Oh, how would you know?  You're a fucking

guidance counsellor.

FRENCH

Todd, this is silly.  Why don't we go inside?

TODD

Here's a little factoid for ya.  I'll bet you

didn't know this one.  Hairs fall out of your

head all the time.  But it's even worse when

you're nervous.  And you know what?  I've

been real fucking high-strung lately.

FRENCH

Listen, Todd... Please.

TODD

That's how it all happened, you know.  One

thing lead to another and before I knew it...

TODD (CONT'D)

...you showed up in my driveway, wearing

those same fucking sneakers.

FRENCH

Whoa.  To--

happy

.
