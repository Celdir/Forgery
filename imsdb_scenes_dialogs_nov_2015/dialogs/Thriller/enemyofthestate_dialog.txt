REYNOLDS

"I know thy works and thy labour

and how thou canst not bear them

that are evil. And thou hast tried

them who say they are apostles and

hast found them to be liars".

Revelations II.

HAMERSLEY

What the hell does it mean?

REYNOLDS

It means who's side are you on?

HAMERSLEY

You didn't ask me to meet you 30

miles from my office for a Bible

study class.

REYNOLDS

It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone

needs to swallow hard. No one,

including you, wants to be fingered

as the one obstructing efforts to

crack down on terrorism, and--

HAMERSLEY

Fuck you.

REYNOLDS

What?

HAMERSLEY

I said fuck you.

REYNOLDS

Is that anyway to talk to an old

school chum?

HAMERSLEY

You're gonna finger me as soft on

terrorism?

Terrorism,

you

unconscionable asshole?

REYNOLDS

There are planes falling out of the

sky, buildings blowing up.

American

buildings.

Americans

getting bombs

in the mail. What are we gonna do!?

HAMERSLEY

We're not gonna hand you and your

band of lunatics the keys to the

kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in

Congress and write a law that

allows the NSA to point a camera

and a microphone at anything they

damn well feel like. And the next

time you have something to say to

me, we do it above-board, in my

office, like everyone else. Now get

outa my car, I've got a committee

meeting on the hill.

VOICE (O.S.)

Senator Albert's office--

INT. CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, TALL OFFICE BLDG. - DAY

OLDER MAN (L.T.)

I don't know how much longer we can

hold out, Mr. Dean.

DEAN

I don't know, either, L.T. Maybe

you guys should get yourself a

labor lawyer.

L.T.

Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean.

'Cause you're a labor lawyer.

DEAN

Good point.

L.T.

Last night, Larry Spinks, he works

the Steel Press, he goes to a bar

with his wife Rosalie to have a

glass of chianti 'cause it's his

birthday, and these two guys, these

Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him

when he goes to the bathroom.

DEAN

L.T., in this office I'd prefer you

say Italian-Americans.

L.T.

I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in

St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm

not myself. The Union bosses say

unless we take Bellmoth's offer,

it'll only get worse.

DEAN

That's because your Union bosses

are

those Guido mother-fuckers.

L.T.

I don't under--

DEAN

The Union's trying to railroad you

into accepting terms worse than

what you have now.

L.T.

Why would the Union--

DEAN

Because they've been paid off by

Bellmoth.

L.T.

Mr. Dean--

DEAN

My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer.

Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.

DEAN (CONT'D)

(calling)

Martha!

DEAN (CONT'D)

Larry Spinks, St. Lukes. Send him a

case of chianti from the firm. And

send his wife Rosalie some flowers.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

RACHEL

How's the trout?

DEAN

It tastes like fish.

RACHEL

It is fish.

DEAN

I mean it tastes like every other

fish I've ever had. Every fish

tastes the same.

RACHEL

Do you like fish?

DEAN

Not that much.

RACHEL

Here's what you asked for. Brill's

note said it was everything you'd

need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--

DEAN

When do I get to meet him?

RACHEL

DePinto?

DEAN

Brill.

RACHEL

Never.

DEAN

That wasn't the answer I was hoping

for.

RACHEL

What answer were you--

DEAN

"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.

RACHEL

It's how he works.

DEAN

Brill?

RACHEL

Yes.

DEAN

So you've said.

DEAN (CONT'D)

Ten thousand cash. I don't know if

it's Brill's prices going up or

your commission.

RACHEL

I take a straight 15 percent.

Brill's fee varies with risk.

Perhaps you'd be more comfortable

using someone else.

DEAN

Other than Brill.

RACHEL

Other than me.

DEAN

Why would I--

RACHEL

Someone with whom you don't have

quite so personal a--

DEAN

I

like

our history. And I like you.

I'd probably like

Brill

if I ever

got to--

RACHEL

He doesn't work that way.

DEAN

I just want to make sure I'm not

breaking the law.

RACHEL

You're not.

DEAN

How can I be sure.

RACHEL

I wouldn't let you. Good luck with

DePinto.

DEAN

(pause)

Thank you.

RACHEL

Eat your fish.

DEAN (V.O.)

Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean.

I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

INT. BELLMOTH STEEL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

DEPINTO

What can I do for you?

DEAN

Well, I was hoping you might stop

by my office to swear out a

criminal deposition against some of

your friends and co-workers.

DEPINTO

(pause)

Is this a fuckin' joke?

DEAN

I don't believe it is, no.

DEPINTO

Why the hell would I--

DEAN

I've got photographs of you at the

Trenton Ramada looking very--

DEPINTO

That ain't me.

DEAN

It's not?

DEPINTO

You don't know who the fuck--

DEAN

That's not you having a whiskey

sour with Carmine Morada.

DEPINTO

This is fucked. You don't know

who's

in that--

DEAN

You're right, Mr. DePinto, and

maybe I jumped the gun.

DEPINTO

You're goddam right you jumped the gun.

DEAN

That's probably not you in the

picture. I tell you what, I'll just

run the thing by the Grand Jury,

see if they can't--

DEPINTO

I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.

DEAN

Good news there, Mr. DePinto,

you're talking to one.

bird feeder out in the yard, but

the squirrels, they keep taking--

ZAVITZ

Turn on CNN.

ALFONSO

They keep taking the bird seed. I

thought since you're the expert on--

ZAVITZ

Goddammit, shut the fuck up and

turn on CNN!

ALFONSO

Alright, I made a joke about

squirrels, don't get so--

ZAVITZ

Do it!

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Once again, police at this point

are calling Hamersley's death an

accident...

ZAVITZ

I was doing motion-activated taping

up in Shenandoah. That's where

Hamersley had his accident. He

argued.

You've got it on tape?

INT. DEAN'S LAW FIRM, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

SAUNDERS

I'm expecting a favorable ruling

this afternoon on the evidenciary

SILVERBERG

Mr. Dean, would you care to give Ms.

Saunders a hand with the

interrogatories.

DEAN

God knows I would, sir, but I have

a previous engagement this evening.

SILVERBERG

And may I ask what could possibly

be more important than Fawell Oil v.

U.S. Environmental Agency?

DEAN

I have to go lingerie shopping.

STILWELL

Lingerie shopping?

DEAN

A Christmas present for my wife.

SILVERBERG

Go to Harrison's. They've got

You should take this seriously.

I'm sorry.

DEAN

The thing is, when I saw him, it

seemed like he wanted to tell me...

(beat)

he said...

Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.

Zavitz before he died. I thought

you might know something.

About what?

About the accident.

I'm no expert, but I'm assuming

that the impact of a moving bus

against his body caused--

MORELOS

Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.

DEAN

What kind of trouble.

MORELOS

You tell me.

DEAN

I can't.

MORELOS

Are you invoking attorney/client

privilege.

DEAN

I'm not his attorney.

Because I don't know.

MORELOS

I'm just trying to determine if Mr.

Zavitz was involved in something

more than a simple bus accident.

Than why don't you talk to the bus

driver?

BLAKE

We've also been informed that the

Grand Jury is going to call for an

DEAN

Why?

BLAKE

They want to hold you in Contempt

for ethics violations.

SILVERBERG

They claim you helped create a

shell company for Sam Vollotti in

Zurich and that through your

continuing relationship, the

Gambino family's been able to exert

influence and provide false

witnesses to discredit our case.

DEAN

Oh, well, that's true.

BLAKE

It is?

Except for the part about my

setting up a company in Zurich and

knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti

whatsoever with the Gambino family.

BLAKE

Have you two been having an affair?

Brill.

BLAKE

Why don't you just call Brill directly.

DEAN

I don't know who he is.

BLAKE

I'm told you had an affair with

Rachel Banks four years ago.

DEAN

Told by whom?

BLAKE

Considering the enormous exposure

to which you've subjected this firm,

I'd think you'd do best to simply

answer my questions.

DEAN

Really?

BLAKE

Yes.

DEAN

Well considering what a colossal

douche bag you are, David, maybe

I'd do best to simply kick your ass

all over the capitol.

SILVERBERG

Gentlemen--

DEAN

This is

bullshit

up a bunch of half-truths to ruin

me and to ruin my case.

SILVERBERG

Who would do that?

DEAN

Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I

don't know.

Well until we find, you're gonna

have to take a leave of absence.

You're firing me.

NSA is behind this. They think that

guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,

they think Zavitz gave me a tape or

computer chip of some kind that

could be damaging to them. So

they're doing all these things

electronically

. The bank records,

the surveillance. They're the ones

who broke into the house. Now I

know there's no reason to believe

me. But I love you. And I love our

son. So just believe me anyway.

(pause)

Please.

STACY

Does that hurt?

DEAN

Well...yeah.

STACY

Good.

DEAN

Stacy--

STACY

I

told

you they could do this. I

told

you they had this kind of

capability and that with this anti-

terrorism it would be just another--

DEAN

Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the

best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.

STACY

I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

DEAN

That's okay.

STACY

I opened the present you got me

from Harrison's.

DEAN

You opened the thing?

STACY

The lingerie.

DEAN

That was for Christmas.

STACY

I was missing you.

DEAN

You're as bad as Eric. I've got an

DEAN

Having an adventure. I can't tell

ERIC

Are you and mom getting a divorce?

DEAN

No. We're never getting a divorce.

We were having a fight. It happens

sometimes.

ERIC

Who won the fight?

DEAN

Men don't win fights with women,

son, I'll tell you about that

sometime, too. In the meantime,

I've got a question for you, and

it's incredibly important that you

tell me the truth. Under no

circumstances will I be angry with

you. This is a total Get-Out-Of-

Jail-Free card. Ready?

ERIC

Yeah.

DEAN

Did you take

anything

--anything at

all--out of those Christmas bags I

brought home last week.

ERIC

(shouting)

DYLAAAAN!!

DYLAN

Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?

DEAN

Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

DYLAN

Oh, God, I

knew

it was stupid, I

knew

we'd get caught. But the

Gameboy was just

sitting

there.

Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes.

We took the GameBoy out of the bag,

but with every intention of putting

it back.

DEAN

(pause)

You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.

DYLAN

It was broken when we found it, I

swear. I tried fixing it for you. I

even put in new batteries.

That's nice, I appreciate--

BRILL

I was worried about my hundred and

DEAN

We said a hundred.

BRILL

The price rises with the temperature

you're right, you should shop

around and get the best price. I'll

just let you out here.

DEAN

(agreeing)

One-twenty.

BRILL

Did you call anyone?

DEAN

What do you mean?

BRILL

I mean did you call anyone.

DEAN

Look, my wife is understandably--

BRILL

Jesus!

DEAN

I called my wife!

BRILL

What'd I tell you?

DEAN

I didn't use my name.

BRILL

What'd I tell you?

DEAN

I called from a payphone!

BRILL

What'd I tell you?

DEAN

You told me no calls.

BRILL

I told you no calls.

DEAN

Sorry.

BRILL

You don't get it. They go through

your phone records. They fuckin'

monitor everyone you called in the

last--

DEAN

I didn't use my name.

BRILL

Oh, I'll bet

that

threw 'em off the

scent. I sure hope you covered the

used a funny voice!

BRILL (O.S.)

INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

BRILL (CONT'D)

The NSA's been in bed with the

entire tele-communications industry

everything: Banks, computers,

phones, mail, name it.

(stopping the car near

the gate)

The more technology we buy into,

the easier it is keeping tabs on us.

It's a brave new world.

(handing DEAN the keys)

At least it better be.

DEAN

How do you know so much?

BRILL

None of your business.

DEAN

You used to work for 'em, didn't you?

BRILL

I was a traffic analyst.

BRILL (CONT'D)

I intercepted phone calls.

DEAN

How'd you get around the tap orders?

BRILL

They can tap anything as along as

it's an airwave intercept.

Cellulars and pagers your kid can

do.

(driving through)

Hard-line calls we'd pick off the

relays as they were being fed into

ground cables or fired up to the

SATs. We'd suck in everything. All

foreign, most domestic.

(DEAN re-closes the gate)

Domestic was my group. Druggies,

radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we

wanted.

DEAN

(climbing back in)

How'd you have the manpower to--

BRILL

(driving again)

Meade has 18 underground acres of

computers. They scan

every

phonecall for target words like

"bomb" or "President". We red-flag

phone numbers or voice

prints...whatever we wanted. When

the computers found something, it

was bounced to comparative analysis.

DEAN

Jesus.

BRILL

That was twenty years ago. With

digital? They can suck a salt grain

off a beach.

DEAN

Why'd you leave?

BRILL

It was '72. I figured we had enough

problems without monitoring a

Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I

sold my story to

Ramparts

and split.

DEAN

They come after you?

BRILL

(shrugging it off)

Well...there'd be too much

disclosure to prosecute me. So they

ruined my records and made sure I'd

never hold a real job again.

BRILL (CONT'D)

What do you think?

DEAN

Looks like Detroit.

Yeah.

BRILL

Well, actually,

BRILL

They're here.

Who?

BRILL

Them.

DEAN

Where?

BRILL

DEAN

Here

BRILL

In the warehouse. They're hiding in

running out of the building.

Gimme that.

You're driving.

REYNOLDS

Lyle?!

HICKS

Yes sir.

REYNOLDS

You're kidding me.

HICKS

No sir.

REYNOLDS

Dean's with Lyle.

HICKS

And they have the video. That's

confirmed.

REYNOLDS

So they know everything.

HICKS

If they've looked at the video.

REYNOLDS

Oh, let's assume that they have.

HICKS

If he's with Lyle it means he's got

resources.

REYNOLDS

Resources, that's a good point.

He's got resources. All we've got

What about newspapers and magazines?

BRILL

Same thing?

DEAN

So what do we do now?

BRILL

I was thinkin' about asking for my

hundred and fifty grand and calling

it quits.

DEAN

What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.

BRILL

It'd never get through. All

packages are screened, x-rayed and

then hand-searched for explosives.

You didn't like my "give-me-my-

money" idea?

INT. TAURUS - NIGHT

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

(from the radio)

--after which, Senator Albert will

address a fund-raiser at Boston

University.

DEAN

What if we put it on the internet?

BRILL

Have you seen how fuckin' slow the

net is? It'd take ten minutes to

unload enough video so that people

know what they're seeing, and it'd

take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to

see it coming down and shut down

the access.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

(from the radio)

--this will be the last stop on the

Senator's eight-city tour before

But maybe if there were no phone

line--

BRILL (CONT'D)

What if we transmitted it over

cellular?

DEAN

Listen--

BRILL

Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.

DEAN

What if--

BRILL

If they couldn't do that, they'd

shut down the whole system, all the

They've done it before. Takes maybe

two minutes.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT

INT. SENATOR ALBERT'S PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

ALBERT

I understand we have a problem.

PATRICK

Senator--

CHRISTA

Senator, there were some things I

couldn't tell you over the phone.

ALBERT

What kinds of things?

PATRICK

Mr. Dean has a video tape from the

hotel room in Boston.

ALBERT

(pause)

I see.

DEAN

It's actually DH-1 Digitech

Pinpoint scanning with a frequency

modulator.

ALBERT

I don't know what that means.

DEAN

Me neither, but the upshot is I've

got color live-action footage of

you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't

look good.

ALBERT

So...how much money do you want in

exchange for not ruining my life?

DEAN

I don't want any money. And believe

me, I have no interest in ruining

your life. I'm not interested in

this tape.

ALBERT

You're not.

PATRICK

Then what do you want from the Senator?

DEAN

I want him to look at a different

tape. People have been killed.

Lives

have

been ruined.

(DEAN takes the computer

chip from his pocket)

Senator, I want you to look at this.

And I want you to bring the fury of

God himself upon this man.

warrant out on--

REYNOLDS WIFE (O.S.)

(from the bedroom)

FBI AGENT

INT. DEAN'S STREET - MORNING

SENATOR ALBERT (O.S.)

an

inalienable

right.

INT. DEAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

ERIC

These guys are always making speeches.

STACY

It's an important speech, Eric.

There's gonna be a vote today.

SENATOR ALBERT

(on TV)

Today we face a threat to that

creed. Certain individuals in our

intelligence community believe

they're entitled to examine lives

in minute detail, and claim to do

it in the name of the common good.

ERIC

If they're voting today, hasn't

everyone pretty much made up their

minds.

STACY

Actually, this man appears to have

changed his mind dramatically.

ERIC

Why?

VOICE (O.S.)

He saw the light, my son.

ERIC

Dad!

STACY

Is it over?

DEAN

It's over.

ERIC

How long can you stay?

DEAN

I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I

live here.

STACY

Get ready for school, you're gonna

be late.

ERIC

Is it okay to use the phone now?

DEAN

It's okay to use the phone.

ERIC

Alright!

DEAN

No "900" numbers.

STACY

It's really over?

DEAN

Albert's gonna get me my job back.

STACY

(pause)

I'm sorry about Rachel.

DEAN

Yeah.

(beat)

I wish you could've met...

STACY

Who?

DEAN

A friend of mine. I don't know his

real name. He's dead now.

STACY

You did good.

ALBERT

(on TV)

I've lived through the dark ages of

Hoover's Watch-List and McCarthy's

Witch Hunts - men who used moral

crusades, fired by fear, to lay

waste to our freedoms.

STACY

C'mon upstairs. I've got a

Christmas present from Harrison's I

want to show you.

ALBERT

(on TV)

Our intelligence communities

presently monitor our phones,

computers, financial transactions,

medical histories...all this and

more. Some of you may say, "Fine.

I'm not a criminal and I have

nothing to hide." Well God forbid

we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid

George Orwell's version of America

becomes a reality. We are

that

close.

FADE TO BLACK.
