MAUREEN

I hate scary movies.

PHIL

It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your

hand.

MAUREEN

If we hurry, we can still catch the

Sandra Bullock movie.

PHIL

We got free tickets.

MAUREEN

What's that?

USHER

The studio sent them.

MAUREEN

I don't think so.

MAUREEN

Take it off.

PHIL

But...

MAUREEN

Now.

MAUREEN

Now why does she have to be naked?

How does that serve the plot?

PHIL

Sssshhh.

GIRL

Hello?

Hello?

Who is this?

VOICE

You tell me.

MAUREEN

I hate this shit.

ON SCREEN

The phone rings again.

VOICE

Why did you hang up on me?

GIRL

Who is this?

MAUREEN

Why doesn't she just hang up and

call the police? Stupid..

PHIL

Shush.

MAUREEN

I'm gonna pee. You want anything?

GIRL #l

I got so scared my bladder rolled.

GIRL #2

You chicken shit. It's just a

movie.

GIRL # l

No, it really happened. It's a true

story.

MAUREEN

You ass.

PHIL

I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.

It was too easy.

MAUREEN

You are so not funny.

PHIL

Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,

will ya?

MAUREEN

I get scared really easy, okay.

PHIL

You gotta go with it. Scary movies

are great foreplay.

MAUREEN

I just have a hard time with

insipid, sexist violence.

PHIL

(nibbling her neck)

We can still Sandra Bullock it.

MAUREEN

(nibbling back)

Sandra started without us. We can

stay. He kisses her again, then

breaks away.

PHIL.

Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me

upstairs?

MAUREEN

Want some popcorn?

PHIL

Butter.

CUT TO:

MAUREEN

Give it up.

MAUREEN

How many stabs did I miss?

MAUREEN

Why doesn't she run?

Hey, you... pasty face...

Hello... uh-huh... Who is this?

Well, we identify ourselves around

SIDNEY

I got it.

HALLIE

Knock yourself out.

SIDNEY

Hello?

(silence)

Hello?

VOICE

Hello Sidney.

SIDNEY

Yes?

VOICE

What's your favorite scary movie?

SIDNEY

Who is this?

VOICE

You tell me.

SIDNEY

Cory Gillis. 442-8730.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls

are a criminal offense prosecuted

under penal code 653M...

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Enjoy the movie.

HALLIE

Time to change numbers again?

SIDNEY

Nah... I think it'll die off. It's

opening weekend. Let's see how it

goes.

REPORTER

(from TV)

"... The two victims, Maureen Evans

and Phil Stevens..."

YOUNG MAN

(from TV)

Please, I just wanna be left alone.

HALLIE

He sure gives a lot of interviews

for someone who wants to be left

alone.

HALLIE

Get your ass in gear. You're late.

Don't forget we've got rush at the

Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything

you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid?

SIDNEY

I can't believe I let you talk me

into going Greek.

SIDNEY

Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?

CUT TO:

REPORTER #2

Sidney, did you know the victims?

REPORTER #1

Do you feel responsible for the

murders?

SIDNEY

What murders?

REPORTER #3

Do you think there will be more

murders?

FLASHY REPORTER

Did you kill them last night, Sid?

Has it gotten to you? Have you

finally snapped?

GALE

(to Sid)

Quick, get outta here.

SIDNEY

What's going on?

GALE

Just go. l'll find you later.

MAN'S VOICE

(from the vehicle)

Hop on, Sid.

SIDNEY

What's going on, Dewey?

DEWEY

It'll be alright.

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

Three hundred people watched?

Nobody did anything?

DEWEY

They thought it was a publicity

stunt.

SIDNEY

Oh my God. How could it happen?

DEWEY

They don't know. It was carefully

planned. Earlier in the day the

victims received anonymous passes

to the movie.

SIDNEY

It's a copycat killer I knew this

would happen. That fucking movie.

DEWEY

As of now, they don't see any

relation. But they're checking it

out. The state, Special Task Force,

FBI - they're all here. They'll

find the guy.

SIDNEY

Yeah, right.

DEWEY

Look, Sid, why don't you take off?

Disappear for a few days. I'll come

with you.

SIDNEY

No. I will not crawl under a rock.

This is a fucked-up world and

people kill people all the time.

I'll just get used to it.

DEWEY

Nothing will happen to you. I

promise.

DEWEY

That's why I'm here, right? We take

care of each other. C'mon, I'll

walk you to class.

SIDNEY

You go, it's all stairs, I can take

it from here.

DEWEY

Don't worry...

SIDNEY

Dewey, I'm completely equipped with

mace, alarm whistle, keyring,

knife, a degree in defensive

combat...

DEWEY

Just in case...

SIDNEY

No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be

okay. Go back to work and let me

get back to my quasi pseudo-happy

existence.

CUT TO:

GALE

I don't know... no one's talking.

What's the studio's position? Never

happen. They'd be stupid to pull

the movie. With all this free press

- they're gonna have huge numbers

this weekend. It'll break box

office records. Of course I have

bumps.

GALE (CONT'D)

I need two minutes at six o'clock.

I wanna do a piece on the slain

kids - no sympathy shit - let's

stick with the movie angle. I wanna

pull a clip from an old film...

GALE (CONT'D)

Hey, what was the name of that

movie?

RANDY

HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA.

1980. Tom Hanks' first film.

GALE (CONT'D)

(into phone)

HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find

it. Don't worry, I've got it

covered... I have a plan. Yeah,

I'll get it. Give it a rest - I

said I'll get it. Later.

GALE (CONT'D)

Pressure's on. You ready for this?

RANDY

I'm there, man. No worries. I got

ya covered. I'm so there. That's

why I'm here - because I'm there.

CUT TO:

SNOTTY GUY

Sequels are too handicapped. By

definition alone, they're inferior

films.

MICKEY

Bullshit generalization. Many

sequels have surpassed their

original.

SNOTTY GUY

Name one.

MICKEY

ALIENS Far better than the

original.

ANOTHER GUY

Subjective.

SOME GIRL

Life's subjective. I much prefer

Ridley Scott.

HALLIE

No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away

from her - you bitch."

SNOTTY GUY

I'll give you that one. Name

another.

MICKEY

T2.

SOME GIRL

You've got a hard-on for Cameron.

SNOTTY GUY

A bigger budget does not make a

better movie. TERMINATOR one is

historical.

ARTSY TEACHER

How about THE GODFATHER PART II?

SNOTTY GUY

The almighty exception. Name

another.

DEREK

EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.

Improved effects.

HALLIE

I liked JEDI. With the furry

things.

MICKEY

Lucas and his Romper Room stage.

HALLIE

I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH,

PART 20.

SNOTTY GUY

Case in point. The entire horror

genre was destroyed by sequels.

ARTSY TEACHER

Really? And why do you think that

is?

SNOTTY GUY

Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes

about: money and no one's

interested in quality.

DEREK

It's more than that. Horror films

are only as good as their villains.

How can Freddie and Jason possibly

be scary after they've been diluted

through five or six sequels.

TEACHER

What's the solution? If you were

making a sequel today what would

you do differently?

SNOTTY GUY

The point is - I made my point.

Sequels suck.

DEREK

How are you? You weren't in class.

I called as soon as I heard...

SIDNEY

I skipped. Too many "That's her"

looks.

DEREK

I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?

SIDNEY

Don't ask what you can do. No

coddling. Life rolls on status quo.

DEREK

I can do that. And I can also do

this.

SIDNEY

No PDA.

CUT TO:

DEAN FISHER

isolated tragedy in no way reflects

answers..."

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Gale? Can I have a second?

GALE

Look, I'm sorry about the face.

DEBBIE SALT

Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -

NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?

GALE

Fair enough.

DEBBIE SALT

What are you doing here? I thought

you had retired from field

reporting?

GALE

Well, you know I'm dear to the

subject matter.

DEBBIE SALT

And much richer as a result.

GALE

Do I know you? You look familiar.

DEBBIE SALT

I took your vulture seminar seminar

at Berkeley last year.

GALE

Good for you.

GALE

(ever smooth)

Guys, you're missing the show.

SHERIFF

No, we have no evidence of a serial

killer. We think the killer acted

deliberately and not at random...

DEREK

But what are they doing? He's

talking but he's not saying

anything.

JOEL

Sounds like they don't know

anything.

HALLIE

Do you think they'll cancel Hell

Week?

MICKEY

You're getting nailed - you're not

getting out of it.

JOEL

Have they questioned you yet, Sid?

SIDNEY

This has nothing to do with me,

Joel. There's an estimated 270

serial killers currently active in

the US at any given time. I can't

control that. Who's hungry?

HALLIE

I have rehearsal.

MICKEY

I have to watch rehearsal.

JOEL

I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.

Some of us have real majors. You

gonna be okay, Sid?

SIDNEY

You're not allowed to ask that.

JOEL

I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.

SIDNEY

Thanks, Joel.

LOIS

Hello, pledges. Enjoying

yourselves?

HALLIE

Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.

Thank you for asking.

MURPHY

Good. We need your help, pledges.

Are you familiar with the Deltas TP

fundraiser?

LOIS (CONT'D)

In our efforts to raise money for

our favorite cause...

MURPHY

... this week's TKE kegger...

LOIS

Ne ask that you sell individual

squares of toilet paper for a mere

nickel a piece.

MURPHY

We've set you each at a five dollar

quota.

MICKEY

Come on, guys. Uncool.

MURPHY

Am I getting fraternity

interference, Mickey?

SIDNEY

It's okay. I can peddle toilet

paper.

DEREK

Sid, you don't have to.

SIDNEY

No special treatment. I can do

this. C'mon Hallie.

DEREK

How do you put up with this Greek

shit?

MICKEY

Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it,

I'm into Hallie...

ACROSS THE WAY

Gale moves through the crowd as the

press conference/rally continues.

She runs dead smack into...

GALE

Hello, Dwight.

DEWEY

Miss Weathers.

GALE

I've been trying to reach you but

you haven't returned...

DEWEY

I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers,

excuse me.

GALE

The name's Gale, remember'?

DEWEY

Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is

embedded clearly between my ears.

GALE

I see you read the book.

DEWEY

Yes, I do retain reading skills.

Shock.

GALE

And an explanation is, of course,

out of the question.

DEWEY

Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the

room with his dim-witted Barney

Fifish presence." I think you've

explained yourself.

GALE

Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.

DEWEY

No, what you are is a money hungry,

fame- seeking liar and - forgive me

for saying - mediocre writer who

has a cold storage shed where her

heart should be.

GALE

You have every right to be upset.

DEWEY

Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with

inexperience."

GALE

I never meant to imply...

DEWEY

How do you know my dim-witted

inexperience isn't merely a subtle

form of manipulation used to lower

people's expectations thereby

enhancing my ability to effectively

maneuver within any given

situation?

GALE

I'm sorry. I don't know what else

to say except I'm sorry.

DEWEY

No, I'm the one who's sorry. I

misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse

me, I have some oozing to do.

SHERIFF

No, there has been no evidence that

more than one killer is

responsible...

SIDNEY

Hello, Gale.

GALE

Sidney. Hello. How are you?

SIDNEY

I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't

stop calling but other than that...

GALE

I'm sorry.

SIDNEY

Yeah, well... you are the

definition of mixed emotions. I

really should hate you... I see

your movie's getting good reviews.

GALE

It seems to be causing a stir.

What's with the toilet paper?

SIDNEY

It's hell week. I'm pledging the

Deltas.

GALE

It's good to see you involved.

SIDNEY

My morn was a Delta.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Randy? What are you doing here?

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Cotton...

COTTON

Hello, Sidney.

SIDNEY

What are you doing?

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

You BITCH!

COTTON

This was a mistake. I shouldn't be

here.

RANDY

Can you say backfire?

GALE

Did you get it?

RANDY

Yeah, I got it.

GALE

You need to check your conscience

at the door. We're not here to be

loved.

AT THE PODIUM

The sheriff continues.

SHERIFF

No, we don't anticipate another

murder but we are taking every

precaution possible...

MAN'S VOICE

What if I said goodbye?

MAN'S VOICE

Why would you wanna do that?

CICI

Why do you always answer a question

The forbidden subject.

FRAT BOY

Yo, guys, outside. Something's up

SHERIFF

Lots of blood. But no body.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Have you checked the...

SHERIFF

Attic, garage, basement, nothing.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Take the neighborhood.

Alright men, listen up...

Sid? Sid?

SIDNEY

Derek. He's in the house. Help...

me...

DEWEY

It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.

CAPTAIN TYLER

We don't know if it's random. We

haven't been able to connect the

victims.

SHERIFF

The first two were stabbed without

thought. The sorority girl was

gutted with autopsy precision.

DEAN FISHER

Christ! Just do something. I will

not have a repeat of Gainesville.

Not on my campus. .

DEWEY

Sidney Prescott, sir.

DEWEY (CONT'D)

She's the connection.

CAPTAIN TYLER

We know that, son.

DEWEY

The killer was trying to get to

her. That sorority girl was a

distraction.

CAPTAIN TYLER

We're aware of that.

DEWEY

The killer is obviously repeating

Woodsboro. I can fill you in on

what I know.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Look, son. I know you've lived

through this, but we got it under

control. Why don't you have some

coffee?

SHERIFF

Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming

in.

GALE

Of course, what can I do?

CAPTAIN TYLER

We were hoping you could help with

the killer's profile.

GALE

Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott.

Sidney Prescott's mother. The first

victim in the Woodsboro Murders.

Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the

first kid to be murdered. Ten to

one - Cici is not the third

victim's real name.

SHERIFF

It's Cassandra.

GALE

Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The

third victim in Woodsboro. She was

hung from a tree and gutted.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Jesus...

GALE

This is a complete copycat. Your

killer is even going in sequence.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Who was the next victim in

Woodsboro?

GALE

In the book or in the movie?

DEAN FISHER

Let's try reality.

GALE

Mr. Himbry - the principal was the

next victim. However, in the movie

version, Tatum Riley was killed

next. Dramatic license.

SHERIFF

Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies

out of his seat and into action.

CAPTAIN TYLER

(to his men)

Find me every variation of Himbry

and what was the other name...

DEWEY

Tatum Riley.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Both on campus and the surrounding

community. I want names ASAP.

DEAN FISHER

I'll get you full access.

GALE

What about Sidney? Is she safe?

CAPTAIN TYLER

She's completely insulated. I've

got my top men on her.

SIDNEY

Gotta.

HALLIE

I'll cover you through rehearsal.

Derek when do you get outta docu-

DEREK

HALLIE

So you'll relieve me at 2:30...

DEREK

JOEL

Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio

SIDNEY

Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.

HALLIE

Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take

MICKEY

Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.

HALLIE

Too bad.

SIDNEY

This is exactly what I don't want.

DEREK

I think it's out of your control.

JOEL

Sid, I'll seeya tonight.

SIDNEY

But...

SIDNEY

My screwed up life shouldn't have

DEREK

It's under control.

Tons and tons.

DEBBIE SALT

Where is Sidney's father?

GALE

DEBBIE SALT

GALE

Why don't you ask them?

DEBBIE SALT

Already did. He's the perfect

suspect, don't you think?

GALE

No, I don't.

DEBBIE SALT

Parents are always responsible. It

all starts in the home.

GALE

Look, I know you kinda hold me up

as your career template and it

gives you some anal charge to

challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm

MAN'S VOICE

Stay away from the cop.

GALE

MAN'S VOICE

It's what you want from me.

GALE

MAN'S VOICE

You are writing another book,

Watch your back.

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

(in character)

"Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."

LOIS

That's not the line. You jumped.

SIDNEY

Shit. Did I?

LOIS

About a page.

DIRECTOR

(off stage)

CUT! Let's take five.

HALLIE

That was good.

SIDNEY

Yeah, right.

DIRECTOR

Sid, why don't you get outta here?

We'll pick this up tomorrow.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Work on the accent.

VOICE

Sid?

HALLIE

Who is that guy?

SIDNEY

It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet

you outside.

HALLIE

No, girletta, I don't leave your

side.

SIDNEY

I've got my entourage. Take a

break. Please.

SIDNEY

What do you want?

RANDY

I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never

should have gone along with Gale. I

know I'm stupid. I wish I had some

good reason to give you but I'm

just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be

mad at me.

SIDNEY

Do you work for her now?

RANDY

Well, yeah... she gave me a job.

Freelance. It got me outta

Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton

and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I

knew it was a bad idea but it

seemed like a quasi harmless bad

idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up.

SIDNEY

Me, too. Randy. Me too.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Wanna get outta here?

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN TYLER

If he calls again - find help.

Don't engage him in conversation.

I'm gonna put a man on you - to

cover you.

DEWEY

I can do it, Captain.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking

I'd pull Jesse off...

GALE

I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.

DEWEY

How's the name search going?

CAPTAIN TYLER

37 usages of Himbry located in the

registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47

Riley's. And that's just on campus.

It's hopeless.

CUT TO:

TORI

(in movie)

Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What

are you doing here?

JOHNNY

(in movie)

They let me go, Sid, I didn't do

it. I'm innocent.

RANDY

You okay, Sid?

SIDNEY

Yeah.

JOHNNY

When my mom left my dad, I accepted

it. That's just the way the cookie

crumbles. Moms leave.

TORI

Yeah, but your mom left town. She's

not dead. My mom's dead. Do you

hear me? She's dead. Dead. And

she's never coming back. Ever,

Ever.

CUT TO:

DEREK

My documentary is due on Tuesday.

MICKEY

What's your subject?

DEREK

I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.

JOEL

You should of done it on Sidney.

That would have been a cool.

DEREK

She wouldn't let me.

MICKEY

Not with Primetime Live and 20/20

coming at her. I'd save my shit

too.

DEREK

Where's Sid?

HALLIE

Damned if I know. She ditched me.

DEREK

You weren't supposed to leave her

alone.

HALLIE

I didn't say she was alone. That

guy - from her home town showed up.

They went off together.

MICKEY

I've been waiting for you, baby.

JOEL

Is that cool? Just to leave her

like that?

HALLIE

She's got guards with her.

DEREK

What guy?

HALLIE

Randy somebody.

JOEL

Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that

night in Woodsboro.

MICKEY

Her old boyfriend?

JOEL

No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy

was a friend.

MICKEY

Watch out, Derek.

HALLIE

He tried to kill her first.

MICKEY

Is Sid in therapy?

JOEL

She was for a while. Gave it up.

DEREK

How do you know so much about her?

JOEL

I read the book.

MICKEY

I could use some therapy.

DEREK

Should we be worried about this

guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just

showed up and now people are dying?

HALLIE

He seemed harmless.

DEREK

Aren't most serial killers

seemingly harmless?

JOEL

And white.

MICKEY

Easy black boy.

JOEL

It's documented. Most serial

killers are attractive - slightly

off white males in their twenties.

HALLIE

That's you, honey.

MICKEY

I got a surprise for you.

HALLIE

What?

MICKEY

"If I should stay. I would only be

in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I

know, I'll think of you each step

of the way...

HALLIE

Don't do this.

MICKEY

"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always

love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will

always love you."

JOEL

(to Derek)

Whitney?

DEREK

I think he's doing Dolly.

MICKEY

"And I hope life treats you kind

and I hope you have all you dreamed

of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."

DEREK

Definitely Whitney.

JOEL

Isn't that a big no-no?

DEREK

I think so.

HALLIE

You're going to get it. You know

what happens.

MICKEY

But I love you. And I want the

whole world to know it.

CUT TO:

TORI

Why did you kill my mother?

JOHNNY

Because she was sleeping with my

dad. She's the reason my mom left.

She was a whore just like you.

TORI

My mom was no whore. Don't you say

that.

JOHHNY

Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

It's the perfect alibi, Sidney.

SIDEKICK

Just like in the movies.

VOICE

Hello Sidney.

SIDNEY

Cotton.

COTTON

Can we talk?

SIDNEY

I don't think that's a good idea.

COTTON

Look, yesterday wasn't my idea.

That was all Gale and dollar signs

and ratings.

SIDNEY

What do you want from me, Cotton?

COTTON

You could start with an apology.

SIDNEY

I did that.

COTTON

You wrote me a letter. Very

cordial. Very appropriate.

SIDNEY

How? What could I say that would

make a difference? I took away a

year of your life - how do I

apologize for that?

COTTON

I wish it was just a year. I lost

everything because of you. I have

nothing now. Look at me, this is

what I've become.

SIDNEY

Cotton, there isn't one day, one

hour, one minute when I'm not

reminded of what I've done. I have

not had one second of reprieve and

no therapy or religion or spiritual

plane can ever erase what I feel in

every vein of my being. And I wish

I had in me what you need to hear

but I don't think the words exist.

COTTON

I just thought if I saw you face to

face, maybe it would help.

SIDNEY

Did it?

COTTON

It helped me realize one thing.

SIDNEY

What?

COTTON

You're a self-obsessed little cunt

like your mother.

RANDY

You okay?

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

I don't know. I don't think Cotton

did it. It's too predictable.

RANDY

If he's innocent he'll have an

alibi.

SIDNEY

I guess Gale's going to be pissed

she missed her exclusive.

RANDY

I'll relay it. You sure you don't

wanna go home?

SIDNEY

I have this button I press. See? It

insulates me.

RANDY

I gotta coupla of those buttons

myself.

SIDNEY

Thanks for the movie, Randy.

RANDY

Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just

had that been there done that

feeling.

DEREK

I had the four o'clock shift. You

weren't there. You had us worried.

Is everything okay?

SIDNEY

No, it's not.

DEREK

I don't really know what happened

in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you

don't trust me.

SIDNEY

It's not you, Derek. I don't trust

myself. I tend to make big

selection errors when it comes to

men.

DEREK

Then I'll make this easy for you. I

like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid.

But I'm gonna stay away. Until you

say otherwise.

SIDNEY

I'm sorry, Derek.

CUT TO:

GALE

(on phone)

The interview's not going to

happen. 1 changed my mind. I've

harassed the girl enough. It's in

poor taste and a bad idea.

FROM THE PHONE

Your entire career is in poor

taste...

GALE

Gotta go, call me when you have

something nice to say.

DEWEY

So what made you change your mind

about Sidney?

GALE

Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

DEWEY

You're a hard one to figure out.

GALE

It's that complex yet shallow

quality. It's deliberate.

DEWEY

I think you're all an act.

GALE

And deep down I'm a good person?

Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.

DEWEY

I know that.

GALE

Yeah?

DEWEY

I also know that you're an aging TV

reporter slash writer who, despite

huge tabloid success, has some self

worth issues regarding your

personal life which directly

effects your professional life in a

non-positive manner. A coupla

failed relationships with - I'm

guessing balding, older men - have

turned you into this bitch with a

cell phone. But I bet sometimes,

late at night, when you're all

alone a sadness seeps to the

surface and in a moment of clarity

you know that all you really want

is to be touched and held and

fondled.

GALE

And where did you gain all of your

Gale Weather's insight?

DEWEY

After my spinal cord was damaged I

was laid up for over a year. A lot

can happen when you're on your

back.

RANDY

What'd I miss?

GALE

I'm not here.

RANDY

Hello?

MAN'S VOICE

Gale?

RANDY

She's not here right now.

MAN'S VOICE

But she's standing right next to

you.

GALE

C'mon.

(to Randy)

Keep him talking.

RANDY

So... what's your favorite scary

movie? No response. Silence.

MAN'S VOICE

They'll never find me.

RANDY

What do you care? Let 'em have

their fun. So, what's up?

MAN'S VOICE

What's your favorite scary movie?

RANDY

SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening.

What's yours? Wait, let me guess.

THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL

EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT

DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY?

Am I close?

MAN'S VOICE

Closer than you think.

GALE

He has to be nearby. He likes the

game.

RANDY

So what's your deal? Can we talk

openly for a second? How does one

become a serial killer? Huh? Are

you psychopathic or merely

psychotic? And what is the

distinguishing feature'? Were you

slapped around as a child? Is it

hereditary? Did your Mom take test

drugs? You know, have you tried

getting laid? It's done wonders for

my homicidal tendencies.

MAN'S VOICE

Do you want to die?

RANDY

Gee, let me think. "Do you want

to... " Is that the best you can

do? Some tired hand me down rehash?

Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a

book about you. No movie rights.

Nothing. I've been through this

before and much better I might add.

DEWEY

It's okay. C'mon, Gale.

RANDY

And if you're such a brilliant

smart killer - why copycat? Why not

be original? Where's the

innovation? Let's pioneer some new

ground. Make a statement. Go down

in history. Now you'll always be

the Woodsboro copycat killer.

That's lame. It's like a bad

sequel. And why Woodsboro? What

about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam?

Why imitate two high school loser-

ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys.

Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and

Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking

homo-repressed, mama's boy.

GALE

Randy? Randy? Where did he go?

CUT TO:

SHERIFF

He's broken his pattern.

CAPTAIN TYLER

They've broken their pattern.

SHERIFF

You're sure about this two person

thing?

CAPTAIN TYLER

Broad daylight, a crowded movie

theatre. This is too much fun for

one person.

SHERIFF

I would say we are now officially

baffled.

CAPTAIN TYLER

On national television.

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

Excuse me? Did your computer just

freeze?

GUY (CONT'D)

You have an instant message, that's

all. Just hit ALT M.

SIDNEY

I'm not signed on.

GUY

Someone here in the room. All the

terminals are connected.

SIDNEY

He's here. He's in the room right

now.

COTTON

What better alibi could I have? I

was here in custody.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Maybe you don't work alone.

COTTON

Yeah, that's it.

SHERIFF

Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?

COTTON

There was no attack, we were

talking. Very heatedly. Miss

Prescott and I have a very

complicated past. That's no crime.

CAPTAIN TYLER

And the gun?

COTTON

I have a permit. It's registered. I

have a legal right to carry it.

SHERIFF

Why do you need a gun?

COTTON

Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is

not reason enough to hold me here.

I've been down this road before.

And unless you're going to charge

me with a crime I'd like to walk

outta here. I have an interview at

6:00.

CUT TO:

GALE

Where's Sidney'?

DEWEY

She's safe.

DEWEY (CONT'D)

How you doin?

GALE

Not good. How you doin?

DEWEY

Not good.

DEWEY

Can't we hold him?

CAPTAIN TYLER

No, we got pressure from California

State. The man practically has

clemency. We can't run the risk of

falsely accusing him. He has to be

standing over the victim with knife

in hand before we make a move.

DEWEY

What now?

GALE

What's going on, Cotton?

COTTON

You know the story, Gale. Man

falsely accused, sent to prison,

proved innocent, released back into

the real world and never trusted

again. Want the exclusive?

GALE

Did you do it?

COTTON

Now, Gale, you were so instrumental

in my freedom. You're not having

character doubts now, are you?

GALE

You have a right to be angry.

COTTON

No, Gale, I don't have any rights.

You made sure of that.

GALE

Cotton, I've done nothing but help

you.

COTTON

You've done nothing but get rich

off of me. How many books have you

sold, Gale? You think I don't

understand points and royalties and

ancilliary rights?

GALE

Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.

You've come to far.

COTTON

Gale, I don't know what I'm doing

from one moment to the next. I'm

just taking it as it comes.

CAPTAIN TYLER

Night's coming. I think its time to

beef up security on the Prescott

girl.

GALE

Where is she?

SHERIFF

She was just escorted to her dorm

room.

DEWEY

Is she safe there?

CAPTAIN TYLER

We're going to bring her in. Hide

her out for a coupla days. And

we're issuing a campus lock-in this

evening. No one is allowed out

after dark.

DEWEY

That doesn't work, sir.

GALE

You're just isolating people.

You're giving the killer a blank

canvas.

CUT TO:

LOIS

It's all about sisterhood.

Everybody thinks its about partying

and blowjobs but...

MURPHY

... we only promote safe rubbered

sex.

LOIS

... it's really about family and

tradition...

MURPHY

... harmonica style is okay.

LOIS

I just love being a sister.

DEREK

Thanks, ladies.

MICKEY

Are they aware of your not so

positive portrayal of Greek life?

DEREK

Not one bit.

MICKEY

Where's Sid?

DEREK

She dumped me.

MICKEY

No way.

DEREK

Yeah.

MICKEY

You freakin?

FRATERNITY JOCK

He lavaliered. He's dead.

CUT TO:

EBERT

(from TV)

I enjoyed its clever execution...

HALLIE

We're missing the Sig Ep party.

SIDNEY

No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties

and mass murderers don't go

together. Trust me.

HALLIE

No, no, I hadn't planned on going,

it's just Mickey will be pissed.

SISKEL

(from TV)

It was just an excuse to kill

young, big breasted girls. I didn't

like it.

SIDNEY

Someone else has been killed.

CUT TO:

FRATERNITY JOCK

Who do you love?

MICKEY

Hallie.

FRATERNITY JOCK

Did you say "My TKE brothers"?

MICKEY

No, I said Hallie.

SIDNEY

I'm fine. I wish people would stop

treating me like glass. I'm not

gonna break.

HALLIE

It's okay to break, girl. You

shatter if you have to.

SIDNEY

I'd really just like to be alone.

DEWEY

The police are waiting outside.

They're going to take you somewhere

safe.

SIDNEY

Dewey, there's no such place.

DEWEY

Humor me, Sid.

HALLIE

Can I come with her?

SIDNEY

No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you

down too. I'll be alright.

GALE

Sid, I'll come with you.

SIDNEY

But who would operate your camera?

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

He's cool, Remy.

JOEL

They got Mickey. He's being toasted

at the Deltas.

HALLIE

I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over

there.

JOEL

We're under quarantine.

HALLIE

I'm the only one who can cut him

down.

SIDNEY

It's not a good idea, Hallie.

JOEL

I'll go with her.

HALLIE

Be safe, girl.

DEWEY

Sid, you should get going.

DEWEY (CONT'D)

Where are you two headed?

JOEL

(instant cover)

Hallie forgot her footage at the

film dept. I'm gonna walk her over

before it's gets too late

DEWEY

You really...

HALLIE

I gotta have it, Dewey.

GALE

Hey, Dewey?

HALLIE

Seeya, Dewey.

GALE

If you were truly a copycat,

wouldn't you want to emulate

everything about the killer that

you could?

DEWEY

Meaning?

GALE

He's already gotta be a part of

Sid's life. What do you know about

this Derek?

DEWEY

Solid alibis. He was with Sidney

when she was attacked.

GALE

Billy had alibis too.

DEWEY

Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll

find you later, okay.

SIDNEY

Whatever.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

(whispering)

Come on, Hallie, baby...

CUT TO:

GALE

(checking door)

You broke the lock.

DEWEY

You broke my heart.

GALE

What are we looking for?

DEWEY

A bloody knife. A ghost mask.

Something like that?

GALE

Can we turn the light on?

DEWEY

That's not the way it's done.

DEWEY

And it's sexier in the dark.

GALE

Dewey, you and I would never make

it.

DEWEY

Maybe not. But think about the sex.

As frustrated as I am...

GALE

... and as lonely as I am...

DEWEY

We'd break some furniture.

GALE

Tell you what. We get through this

one. And we'll take out a hotel

room. Over here with the light.

DEWEY

They're roomates.

GALE

And Joel's pre-med.

DEWEY

The sorority girl was gutted with

autopsy precision.

GALE

Shit! It's both of them. The first

murders were to throw us - using

the same names as Woodsboro. But

they've moved on - they're getting

closer to Sidney. They're not

looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to

kill. They're looking for the new

Tatum.

DEWEY

Hallie?

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

Where are you taking me?

POLICE GUARD #1

Actually, I don't know.

POLICE GUARD #2

We're meeting another car that will

transport you the rest of the way.

POLICE GUARD #1

Safety precautions.

SIDNEY

I feel like Eddie Murphy.

POLICE GUARD #1

We feel like Kevin Costner.

CUT TO:

GALE

Ssshh! What was that?

DEWEY

Let's find out.

GALE

This is all too familiar.

DEWEY

Over here.

GALE

Maybe they never got here. He could

have taken her anywhere.

DEWEY

C'mon. Let's go.

GALE

Jesus Christ!

DEWEY

He filmed his victims.

GALE

Shit!

DEWEY

Dammit!

GALE

Let's go.

DEWEY

No, wait here.

GALE

No, Dewey, let's call for backup.

GALE

Dewey?

DEWEY

There's nothing. I'm coming down.

DEWEY (CONT'D)

Watch out!

DEWEY (CONT'D)

Gale!

DEWEY

Gale! Gale!

GALE

(through tears)

NOOOOOOO!

CUT TO:

SIDNEY

SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Oh God, help me. We have to call

the police.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Do you have keys? I need to get

inside.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Shit!

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Mickey? Mickey?

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Oh God, no, Mickey...

MICKEY

Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've

been here all night.

SIDNEY

Listen to me. We've got to get

help. The Killer's here.

MICKEY

What are you talking about?

SIDNEY

He's after me.

MICKEY

Shit! You've got to cut me down,

Sid.

SIDNEY

I'll be right back.

MICKEY

Where you going?

SIDNEY

Watch out.

MICKEY

Do it again.

MICKEY (CONT'D)

What was that?

SIDNEY

Don't panic.

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Watch out.

MICKEY

SIDNEY

Hey.

MICKEY

Run, Sid...

SIDNEY

Hallie?

CUT TO:

VOICE

(from phone)

What is your emergency please?

GALE

Someone's trying to kill me. I need

the police.

VOICE

Are you in danger now?

GALE

Yes, goddammit!

VOICE

Where is your attacker?

GALE

I don't know.

VOICE

Stay under the safety light. Help

is on its way.

GALE

The safety what? Fuck that!

GALE

SIDNEY!

GALE (CONT'D)

Fuckin' hurry.

SIDNEY

Hello?

SIDNEY (CONT'D)

Hallie?

COTTON

Quick, untie me.

VOICE

(from behind video

camera)

You've seen this movie before,

haven't you?

DEREK

Smile for the camera.

COTTON

Sid, c'mon.

DEREK

Go on, untie him.

SIDNEY

No. This is a set up.

DEREK

That's quick.

COTTON

Please, Sidney, he's going to kill

us.

DEREK

You must be dealing with some

serious trust issues right about

now.

DEREK (CONT'D)

Sidney, you can't keep your back to

the audience like that. Could you

cheat a little forward for me?

COTTON

Please, Sidney.

DEREK

You're really stumped, aren't you?

You know there's two killers but

you don't know who they are. I'm a

given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.

But now you're torn. Everyone else

appears to be dead. Except for

Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?

HALLIE

Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The

story of your life, Sid.

DEREK

Need some help, honey.

HALLIE

I got it..

DEREK

You should really see your face

right now, Sid. It's doing some

freaky shit.

HALLIE

Yeah, you look quizzical yet

pensive.

DEREK

Yeah, how can we help? Do you have

any questions regarding the sequel

of your life?

SIDNEY

Why?

DEREK

Good question. You took the bait.

HALLIE

Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?

Well, Derek and I have this whole

Mickey/Mallory-Woody

Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing

going on.

DEREK

I really don't like that

comparison, honey.

HALLIE

(to Sid)

He hates Oliver Stone.

DEREK

I find his work overwrought.

HALLIE

C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've

been planning this baby for a year.

Humor us.

DEREK

Nope. You had your chance.

CUT TO:

GALE

Shit.

CUT TO:

DEREK

We met on the internet.

HALLIE

He sent me the cutest e-mail.

DEREK

I read her postings on the horror

movie chat boards and fell

hopelessly. Hook, line...

HALLIE

We have our own website now. We

dedicated a whole page to you.

DEREK

You'd me amazed at how many of us

there are out there. It's a whole

world, Sid. You're really popular

amongst the demented.

HALLIE

You're the one who got away.

DEREK

Until now.

COTTON

You guys are fucked.

HALLIE

Actually Cotton, and I think

critics would agree, it's the other

way around.

DEREK

Poor Cotton, could life be a little

more cruel?

SIDNEY

You're not going to get away with

this.

HALLIE

Of course not. Who wants to? What's

the point if we don't get caught?

Where's the glamour in that?

DEREK

The way I see it. We'll be

arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on

the home footage. Secure a book

deal. If all goes as planned, our

trial should coincide with the

release of STAB II.

HALLIE

A verdict and premiere all on the

same day. I love it.

DEREK

We're hoping for the death penalty.

I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING

swan song exit planned.

HALLIE

And now, drum roll please...

DEREK

Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one

last surprise for you.

HALLIE

A twist ending if you will.

DEREK

Yeah, we really had our work cut

out for us. It really is the curse

of the sequel. The Billy/Stu

thing's been done.

HALLIE

... so we had to be different but

yet the same because if you venture

to far away from your orginal story

you completely alienate the

audience...

DEREK

And we didn't want to do that, Sid.

We wanted to give you your money's

worth.

HALLIE

So we found a compromise.

DEREK

Or it found us.

HALLIE

We have a surprise guest star

waiting in the wings.

DEREK

Just for you, Sid.

HALLIE

Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to

flip.

DEREK

Oh yeah.

(to Sid)

We figure the one of us that

actually kills you will get a

little more press. It's been an

ongoing discussion.

(to Hallie)

Heads or tails?

HALLIE

Tails.

DEREK

Shit! You win.

GALE

Sidney!

SIDNEY

Gale!

HALLIE

It's about time she showed up.

DEBBIE SALT

standing, lips pursed.

DEBBIE SALT

Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for

you.

SIDNEY

Okay, look, you guys - I applaud

your methodical expertise but I

have a question. What's going to

happen after I die? I thought the

heroine is supposed to live.

HALLIE

Not this time.

DEREK

Yeah, we're trying to send a

message to Hollywood. I'm really

getting tired of all the happy

endings. It's just not reality. In

the real world the good guys die,

the innocent are punished, and the

murderers inherit the earth.

SIDNEY

But nobody wants to see that. It'll

never go. They'll rewrite you. You

don't want that.

HALLIE

Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.

I guess fearing death makes one

anxious.

SIDNEY

You fucking freaked out movie nut

psychos...

VOICE

(off camera)

Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies

don't create pyschos.

DEBBIE SALT

Don't you know that by now? It's

about family. It all starts at

home. It starts with the father...

and the mother.

SIDNEY

Mrs. Loomis?

GALE

What?

SIDNEY

Oh my God.

GALE

Jesus. It can't be.

HALLIE

Told you we had a guest star.

Didn't see that coming, did you?

DEREK

Everything's taken on a hyper-

reality, hasn't it?

GALE

You're Billy's mother?

DEBBIE SALT

I couldn't believe you didn't

recognize me. You even interviewed

me for your book.

GALE

You're all in this together?

DEREK

We had to have financing.

HALLIE

Tuition's expensive.

SIDNEY

Why Mrs. Loomis?

DEBBIE SALT

Where should we start? Your mother

ruined my marriage by sleeping with

my husband. You ruined my family by

killing my son. Gale aired it to

the world. Should I go on... isn't

that enough?

GALE

Jesus, you're just as whacked as

your son.

DEBBIE SALT

Where do you think he got it?

Mental illness is heriditary. Who

do you think incouraged him to kill

your mother? He was a smart kid but

children need parental guidance.

DEREK

Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We

never would have been able to it

without her.

DEBBIE SALT

And I couldn't have done it without

you two. Now who won the coin toss?

HALLIE

I did.

DEREK

What are you...

DEBBIE SALT

Nice kids but a little out there.

GALE

What are you going to do?

DEBBIE SALT

Finish what my son started.

GALE

But you'll never get away with it.

DEBBIE SALT

Enter Cotton Weary.

DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)

Think about it. An innocent man

wrongly accused. Spends time in

prison where he justs sits with his

righteous anger, waiting, planning

his revenge. His life so

incomprehensively ruined he's

forced to take revenge on the

people responsible. It's perfect.

COTTON

No... not again.

DEBBIE SALT

Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were

just meant to be a killer.

SIDNEY

You'll never get away with this.

DEBBIE SALT

Who would you like to shoot first,

Cotton?

GALE

Thank God.

GALE (CONT'D)

God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm

so sorry.

COTTON

Yeah...

GALE

Thank you.

SIDNEY

NOOO!

COTTON

It's perfect, Sidney. No one will

ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm

the victim.

SIDNEY

Please, Cotton, don't do this.

COTTON

I get my revenge and make some fast

cash.

SIDNEY

It's over, Cotton.

COTTON

Not until you're dead.
