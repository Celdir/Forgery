Derek?

BETH

What are you going to do with that?

BETH'S VOICE

This is coming down.

DEREK'S VOICE

Why?

BETH'S VOICE

Do you want people to think we put it up?

DEREK'S VOICE

(soft chuckle)

I don't know. I kind of like it.

BETH'S VOICE

Please tell me you're joking.

DEREK

All I'm saying, before we take it down...

maybe we should try it out.

You know. Christen the new house.

BETH

And what do you suggest we use for a bed?

DEREK

What do we need a bed for when we've got

a fine shag carpet?

BETH

(LAUGHS)

Because I'm gonna have fine shag carpet

tattoos all over my --

BETH (cont'd)

Don't you have to go to work?

DEREK

Told `em I'd be late.

BETH

What about...

DEREK

Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a

nuclear bomb went off.

BETH

Maybe not, but the movers...

DEREK

Won't be here for another hour.

BETH

Derek, you are so bad.

You're a temp?

Well, you could have fooled me.

Thanks.   I owe you one.

LISA

No. I'm taking these files to Mister

Charles' office. They said it was this

way.

DEREK

Derek Charles?

LISA

I guess you probably know him.

DEREK

Oh, yeah, I know him.

(lowers his voice)

Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay

too seriously. But don't tell him I said

that.     L

ISA

I could get you into trouble?

DEREK

Deep trouble.

Morning, Derek. How's the new house?

DEREK

Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out

as soon as the movers showed up.

PATRICK

Beth must have loved that.

DEREK

If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell

her I'm in a meeting.

PATRICK

Remember who used to sit at this desk?

She'll know I am lying.

DEREK

(with a smile)

Good point.

PATRICK

Can I help you?

LISA

That's Derek Charles?

PATRICK

Yes.

PATRICK (cont'd)

Watch it, girl. He's married.

LISA

The good ones are always married.

AGE

(to Derek)

Did you talk to our German friend, Herr

Ganz?

DEREK

Matter of fact, I just got off the line

to Berlin.

GAGE

And?

DEREK

Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock

Market's been gyrating and he thinks the

hedge fund wave is about to crest.

AGE

You think he's right?

DEREK

Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent

wrong. We haven't even gotten close to

that point yet. Hedge fund demand is

coming from individual investors which is

why it's gaining mainstream acceptance.

You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when

anything goes mainstream. He started

making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I

managed to talk him into a private equity

portfolio instead... to the tune of 155

mil.

I knew there was a reason I promoted you.

No offense, Ben.

BEN

Never seen `em before.

DEREK

I think she's one of the temps.

BEN

You mean temptress...

GAGE

Remind me to call that agency and have

them send over a couple more just like

her. Doesn't hurt to have a little eye

candy around the office, does it, boys?

Good night, Mister Charles.

You punk'd me.

DEREK

(LAUGHS)

Sorry but you set me up.

LISA

(with humor)

Don't worry. I'll get my revenge.    And

by the way, you might like to know

everybody who works here strongly

disagrees with you.

DEREK

About what?

LISA

About Derek Charles being an asshole.

They all say he's the nicest guy in the

firm.

DEREK

Well, that just proves he's got `em all

fooled.

LISA

And he's humble, too.   I'm Lisa, by the

way. Lisa Sheridan.

Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa

Sheridan. Good luck with your next job --

Hey, little man. What's wrong?    You

I've been changing him all day.

But I've saved the most important toast

To my beautiful wife who I love and adore

more than anything in the world.

BETH

And to my handsome husband. I asked for

the moon and he gave me the stars.

Derek...

Uh huh?

BETH

How would you feel about trying out that

mirror again? This time in our own bed.

Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test

You know how I like looking at your sexy

butt.

Beth, you are so bad.

BETH

Isn't that WHY you married ME?

LISA

Hi.   Remember me?

DEREK

Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's

Patrick?

LISA

Out with the flu. I did some trading

with the other temps and wrangled your

desk. I hope that's okay.

D

EREK

Uh... sure.

DEREK (cont'd)

Hey Marge.

MARGE

Good morning, Derek.

DEREK

Grab your pad and follow me.

LISA

I put a memo on your desk about the

Christmas party this Friday.

EREK

Is it that time already?

LISA

Why don't they invite spouses?

DEREK

How's that?

LISA

To the Christmas party.    It says "for

employees only."

DEREK

It's like that in most companies. They

think people are more inhibited in front

of their spouses, less likely to kick

back and enjoy themselves and mingle with

co-workers, which is what the party is

about.

LISA

So, does this party get pretty wild?

DEREK

Just the opposite.

LISA

Well that's no fun.

LISA (cont'd)

I

called Patrick. He said you like it

black with two sugars.

LISA (cont'd)

If it's cold, I can run down and nuke it

in the Break Room.

DEREK

(takes a sip)

No, it's perfect.

LISA

Fire away.

DEREK

Well, it's Monday and first thing on

Monday...

LISA

I took care of that.

DEREK

Took care of what?

LISA

On Mondays you always send your wife a

dozen long-stemmed red roses.

(off Derek's look of surprise)

I called to confirm they've been

delivered.

DEREK

Thanks.

LISA

I think that's incredibly sweet.   How

long have you two been married?

DEREK

Three years in March.

LISA

And you still send her flowers every

Monday morning? Lucky girl.

DEREK

It's kind of a tradition.

LISA

Patrick said you started sending them

back when Beth worked here as your

assistant. Is that how you won her

heart?

DEREK

Well, it took a little more than roses.

(getting down to business)

We need to run some calls.

LISA

(POISED)

Ready when you are.

(CONTINUED)

DEREK

(

AMUSED)

Are you always this efficient?

LISA

Does that surprise you?

DEREK

Well, it's just that most of the temps we

get here...

LISA

I think you'll find I'm not your typical

temp.

DEREK

No.   Definitely not.

(THEN)

Okay not your typical temp... start with

Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch

for end of the week. Wherever he wants

but push the Water Grill. Then Terry

Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for

you?

LISA

No.    Go faster.   I can handle it.

UT TO:

BETH

It's a beautiful little park with a duck

pond and close enough to push Kyle.

BETH (cont'd)

I've already met a dozen other women with

kids the same age. One of them, Lauren

something asked if we'd like to come over

for a barbecue on Saturday.

DEREK

I don't know. It's shaping up to be a

work weekend.

In a sec.

BETH

The card that came today with the

roses...

EREK

Uh huh?

BETH

... was addressed "To Betty."

EREK

Betty?

BETH

(with humor)

Your other wife?

Yeah. Who's Betty?

DEREK

Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called

in sick and I had a temp on my desk.

B

ETH

I thought we had a deal. No female

assistants.

DEREK

Honey, I don't control the temp pool.

BETH

She pretty?

ETH (cont'd)

Just asking...

DEREK

Yeah, she's pretty... plain.

BETH

(JOKING)

I don't care. I want her fired

immediately.

DEREK

Actually, she did a great job... aside

from the card.

ETH

Night, Derek.

DEREK

Night... Betty.

BETH

Hope you don't mind us dropping in

unannounced.

DEREK

You kidding? This is a treat.

BETH

Sheila's meeting us for lunch at Central

Market. Then I'm taking Kyle to the

Grove.

(to Kyle)

And who are we going to see at the Grove?

KYLE

(EXCITED)

Santa!

BETH

(to Derek)

You want to come?   Get your picture taken

on Santa's lap?

DEREK

I'd love to but I'm all jammed up.     But

say hi to your sister.

BETH

That guy she was seeing, the one we met

at Thanksgiving... Jack.

D

EREK

The one she said was perfect.

BETH

Apparently he's not so perfect.   He told

her he just wants to be FWB.

DEREK

FWB?

BETH

Friends With Benefits.

DEREK

What does that mean?

BETH

You know.    Sex but no commitments.

DEREK

And Sheila's got a problem with that?

It's great to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

And this must be Kyle. I can already

tell he's going to grow up to be a

heartbreaker.

LISA (cont'd)

Hi, Kyle.     I'm Lisa.

DEREK

Kyle, say hello.

BETH

He can say hello. He's usually not this

shy around strangers.

LISA

What a handsome boy.

(to Derek)

He looks just like you.

DEREK

Actually, most people think he takes

after Beth.

LISA

Talk about the perfect family. The three

of you should be on a magazine cover.

BETH

I hope my husband's not working you too

hard.

LISA

(cheery tone)

He is. But I like it. I'm learning a

lot.

(to Derek)

Joe Gage needs to see you when you get a

minute.

BETH

Well, that's our cue to leave.    We just

dropped in to say hi.

(taking Kyle from Derek)

Come on, big boy.

LISA

It was great to meet you... Beth.

ETH

You, too... Laura.

LISA

Lisa.

BETH

Excuse me?

LISA

It's Lisa.      You said Laura.

BETH

I did?

BETH (cont'd)

Sorry.   Lisa.

LISA

(WAVING)

Bye, Kyle. Say hi to Santa for me.

DEREK

(to Beth)

That was intentional.

(CONTINUED)

22.

BETH

Wasn't me. Blame "Betty."    So what's the

deal with her?

DEREK

What do you mean?

BETH

She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa.

DEREK

So?

BETH

So she was obviously listening at the

door.

DEREK

Well, she probably didn't know when to

come in.

BETH

I thought you said she was plain. Derek,

that girl may be a lot of things but one

of them is not plain.

DEREK

How would I know?    I only have eyes for

you.      B

ETH

(LAUGHS)

Oh, you are so slick.

Come on. I'll walk you to the elevator.

So, how many times did you get busted

listening in on Derek's calls?

LISA

(light laugh)

I'm way too devious to ever get caught.

Besides, I thought all you assistants

listened in.

PATRICK

(with a smile)

We do.

LISA

How long have you worked here?

PATRICK

Ten years this Spring.

ISA

I'll bet you know more about what goes on

behind these closed doors than anybody.

Oh you got that right girl.    I know all

the dirty little secrets.

Well maybe we should grab a drink some

night after work for a little girl talk.

No. Stay. I was just gonna take this

back to my office.

Anything I can do to help?     I mean... if

you want to talk about it.

LISA

It's nothing.

DEREK

Most people I know don't cry over

nothing.

LISA

with humor)

You think I was crying?     This is just my

allergies.

they're allergic to me.

think we should see each other anymore."

OUCH!!! That's pretty cold.    How long

were you together?

LISA

Two months.

Actually, it was one of my longer lasting

relationships. I don't know what it is

but sooner or later I just seem to scare

men off.

I'm starting to think there's something

wrong with me.

DEREK

(like a big brother)

Nothing wrong with you. Your boyfriend's

a fool, that's all.

LISA

I wish I could believe that.

DEREK

Maybe you just haven't met the right guy

yet.

LISA

I'm beginning to think all the good ones

are taken. D

on, I won't have a choice.

DEREK

That's not going to happen because

there's nothing to find out.

OE

Good. Then you have nothing to worry

about. Meantime I'm going to put Ben on

the Ganz account.

DEREK

But Ganz is my client --

JOE

Look, maybe you should take some time

off. Just til this blows over.

MARGE

Sorry to interrupt. Derek, there's a

Detective Reyes here to see you.

CUT TO:

DEREK

She obviously ordered the flowers for

herself.

REYES

With your credit card.

DEREK

My secretary keeps all my personal

information on her computer. Lisa must

have accessed it when she was working my

desk.

(CONTINUED)

DEREK (cont'd)

You think I sent the flowers?   I'd have

to be as crazy as she is.

REYES

There's more.

DEREK

More?

REYES

This is a print out of Lisa's blog. It's

sort of a diary she was keeping.

REYES (cont'd)

It's a rather graphic and detailed

account of your various sexual liaisons

together. D

EREK

What?

REYES

You can read them for yourself but I

should warn you they're a little... X-

rated.

DEREK

(REACTING)

This is... none of this ever happened. I

was never at her apartment. I never even

touched her, let alone did any of this...

REYES

According to those entries, you're quite

the accomplished lover, Mister Charles.

And you made promises to her, promises to

divorce your wife and marry her...

DEREK

You can't possibly believe this.

(CONTINUED)

75.

REYES

Whether I believe it or not is

irrelevant. The only thing that matters

is that she believes it.

DEREK

There's got to be something I can do to

protect myself... my family.

REYES

You could file a restraining order.    But

that may not be necessary.

DEREK

Why not?

LISA

Lisa's left town. She was released in

the custody of an older sister yesterday.

Her sister flew down from San Francisco

and took her back. Lisa's agreed to

check herself into a neuropsychiatric

hospital up there.

DEREK

(some relief)

Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear

she's gone. Maybe now she can get the

help she needs.

REYES

W

ith any luck, Mister Charles, you'll

never hear from her again.

I am not gonna waste you in that outfit.

It's not that easy.

Apparently Lisa stole her sister's ID to

buy a ticket and board a plane to LA

earlier today, then used her sister's

credit card to rent a car. The sister

didn't even know she was gone until a few

hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing

People like Lisa... their emotions can

her feelings for you to change to rage.

I don't know. But there's a good chance

you need to call me right away.
