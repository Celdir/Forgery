VALKYRIE

Written by

Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander

January 8, 2007

I swear by God this sacred oath:

That I shall render unconditional obedience to

Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer of the German Reich, and

that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave

soldier, to give my life for this oath.

1   BLACK                                                   1

And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking

in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio.

Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler.

HITLER (V.O.)

My comrades. Once again - I don't

know how many times it has been now

- an attempt has been made on my

life. I speak to you tonight for

two reasons. First, so that you can

hear my voice and know that I am

unhurt. And second, so that you may

know the details of a crime without

parallel in German history...

2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2

TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT.

13 MARCH 1943.

A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand

rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform

denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.

TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF

STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.

Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only

movement in the frame.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by

Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS

escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party

dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.

Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of

distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.

Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200

Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109

fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar

that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the

massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters

roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors

come to rest and, needing no introduction:

ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by

the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.

(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire

sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)

2.

Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,

but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Fuhrer

marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or

their waiting limo.

To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto

the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the

windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.

Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.

VOICE (O.S.)

It's not so much your car he

doesn't trust... It's your driver.

Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:

TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER

OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.

The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in

a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops

into the limo they brought for Hitler.

Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A

beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.

3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3

Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is

bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.

4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4

Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their

necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head

table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards.

ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.

HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the

Fuhrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.

We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he

places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,

deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.

When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of

the room relaxes slightly and digs in.

ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow

and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,

eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.

Tresckow stares.

3.

TRESCKOW

Managing the Fuhrer's security must

be quite an undertaking.

BRANDT

(in between mouthfuls)

Irregularity is the Fuhrer's

precaution of choice.

TRESCKOW

I can assure you he's safe here.

Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.

Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous." He cleans

his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,

takes out his datebook and starts writing - once

again the precise man we saw on the airfield.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

I understand you're returning to

Berlin this afternoon...

Brandt nods.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

Could I trouble you to deliver a

package to Colonel Stieff?

Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the

knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...

5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5

Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over

two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:

TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic

casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.

Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through

the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a

small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his

attention to the bottles of Cointreau...

6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6

The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.

Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt

is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.

4.

Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently

handles a carefully wrapped package.

CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of

the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The

explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.

TRESCKOW

With my regards to Colonel Stieff.

Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He

studies the familiar shape.

BRANDT

Cointreau? You better hope I don't

get thirsty on the flight.

Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having

just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.

Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with

Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him

along with, we hope, the Fuhrer's fate.

Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:

7   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             7

A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.

Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a

desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...

DISSOLVE TO:

8   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             8

Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but

Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...

The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He

doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.

TRESCKOW

He's... landed.

It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.

AIDE

What about the...

Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.

5.

TRESCKOW

Get me Colonel Brandt...

(staying cool)

Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you

landed safely... I hate to trouble

you but there's been a bit of a mix

up. It seems you have the wrong

bottles for Colonel Stieff. You...

do still have the package?

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

I can be at your office first thing

tomorrow morning to pick it up.

Terribly sorry for the

inconvenience... Thank you.

AIDE

Do you think he knows?

TRESCKOW

There's only one way to be sure...

9    EXT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - DAY                               9

10   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY                     10

OFFICER

What happened?

6.

TRESCKOW

I can only guess the altitude

caused the fuse to malfunction.

First the beer hall, Memorial Day -

now this. Someone is watching over

that sonofabitch, I swear it.

OLBRICHT

We've been discovered.

Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless.

TRESCKOW

What makes you think-

OLBRICHT

Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo

came for him last night.

Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking.

Olbricht hurries after him.

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

Did you hear what I said?

TRESCKOW

The Gestapo could have arrested him

for anything. Find a replacement.

OLBRICHT

There's no one we can trust. Not in

Berlin.

TRESCKOW

Then stop looking in Berlin.

Just then, they approach the final threshold, a

SENTRY guards an office marked:

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.

Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But

Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to

enter when:

SENTRY

Your pistol please.

Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol

from its holster and handing it over.

And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his

shoulders and enters Brandt's office.

7.

11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11

BRANDT

You'll forgive me, General. This

little round-up has had me writing

reports all day.

TRESKOW

Round-up?

BRANDT

Dissenters. A plot against the

Fuhrer.

TRESKOW

Who would even have the balls?

BRANDT

You'd be surprised, the number of

cowards in this army that would be

willing to stand against the Reich.

TRESKOW

Only if the Fuhrer were dead, of

course.

BRANDT

Of course. It's one thing to think

you know what's right. What matters

is having the strength to do it.

BRANDT (CONT'D)

Is this what you've come for?

BRANDT (CONT'D)

Perhaps we should open it.

8.

TRESCKOW

I beg your pardon.

BRANDT

You've come a long way. You must be

thirsty.

TRESCKOW

I wonder how the Fuhrer, who does

not partake, would feel about an

officer who did so on duty...

Colonel Brandt.

BRANDT

I took you for another sort,

General.

TRESCKOW

And I you.

12   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                         12

9.

A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by

a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.

YOUNG LIEUTENANT

Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new

headquarters has been established

at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.

Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.

STAUFFENBERG

Now they tell us to disengage - a

day late. No matter how many times

we tell Command the reality, they

always manage to leave us-

But he stops himself, containing his rage.

YOUNG LIEUTENANT

Colonel, the enemy is less than

five kilometers from here. You've

done all you can.

Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating

a ring on his finger. After a beat:

STAUFFENBERG

I wonder... Was there even a point

in our coming to Tunis?

YOUNG LIEUTENANT

To get taken prisoner, it seems.

Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:

BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the

tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.

Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery

blasts strike in front and behind the retreating

column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.

Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg

taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.

Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short

supply and many are left in the open. So they run.

Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The

survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn

to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the

other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.

Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.

10.

STAUFFENBERG

STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

STAND FAST, I SAID.

11.

DOCTOR

Mrs. Stauffenberg?

NINA

(nodding, gesturing to Berthold)

The Colonel's brother, Berthold.

DOCTOR

Perhaps before you see the Colonel

we should go to my office and-

NINA

I will see my husband now.

16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16

DOCTOR

He's been constant with fever but

he refuses any pain killers. The

right hand has been amputated above

the wrist. He's lost the fourth and

fifth fingers on the left. We...

couldn't save the left eye.

NINA

His ring.

DOCTOR

I don't-

12.

NINA

He had a ring on his right hand.

Where is it?

DOCTOR

I'm sorry... His hand was amputated

in the field... I'm afraid-

NINA

Thank you.

BERTHOLD

We've lost North Africa.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17

13.

A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of

another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a

bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and

smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.

Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under

his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to

button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he

tries to do the buttons with the use of only three

fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to

watch.

He is about to give up when he notices a figure

looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces

at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities.

STAUFFENBERG

I don't know what I ever did with

ten.

Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but

Stauffenberg beats him to it.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

I'm wanted in Berlin.

Olbricht nods.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Are you asking as a member of the

High Command?

Olbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes

the door behind him, nervously glancing at the

patient in the next bed.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

You can speak openly, General. He

died just before you came in.

Awkward moment. Finally:

OLBRICHT

We could use your help.

STAUFFENBERG

I'm a field officer.

Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.

OLBRICHT

This war can't be won in the field.

14.

STAUFFENBERG

That's unfortunate for me.

OLBRICHT

You can't honestly believe you'll

make a difference on the front-

STAUFFENBERG

I'm a soldier, General. I serve my

country.

OLBRICHT

It makes no sense. You opposed

Hitler, you opposed the war.

STAUFFENBERG

The people chose otherwise and here

we are. Now we have to win. You

know what will happen if we don't.

OLBRICHT

If we win, it will still be

Hitler's Germany.

STAUFFENBERG

We all took an oath, General.

Olbricht nods, resigning. He realizes it is no use.

Finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to

reveal a brilliant gold medal.

OLBRICHT

On behalf of the Fuhrer.

Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it.

STAUFFENBERG

I'm a twin, you know.

Olbricht is as confused as we are.

OLBRICHT

I... I didn't.

STAUFFENBERG

My brother died the day after we

were born.

OLBRICHT

I'm sorry.

What the hell is he talking about?

15.

STAUFFENBERG

I was lying in the desert, covered

in blood, sure I was going to die.

I tried to think about my wife, my

children... But my mind kept

drifting to my dead brother. How I

would finally be with him. How I

would finally be whole again...

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

This is my reward for what happened

to my men. It's all I deserve.

DOCTOR

When will you be going back to the

front?

STAUFFENBERG

I'm not going to the front. I'm

needed in Berlin.

WITZLEBEN

...He is not a man, he's a lunatic.

He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck.

He has no weakness to exploit, no

vice to manipulate. His only

passion is complete control. How

can you expect to reason with him?

GOERDELER

After this most recent failure I'd

say we've no other choice.

WITZLEBEN

Confront Hitler now and you'll end

up with piano wire for a neck-tie.

Our only option is the central

solution.

GOERDELER

He's a man like any other. Flesh

and blood. Take him head on and-

18.

TRESCKOW

I'll say this for you, Doctor...

You're certainly delusional enough

to take Hitler's place.

GOERDELER

(eyes narrowing)

When that day comes, I'll be sure

to remember you.

TRESCKOW

I doubt you'll remember much of

anything.

GOERDELER

Dammit, Tresckow-

And the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees

Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn,

nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room

is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a

little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat:

OLBRICHT

Gentlemen, may I present Colonel

Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned

to my office at the War Ministry.

(to Stauffenberg)

Colonel, may I introduce-

STAUFFENBERG

These men need no introduction.

Beck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand.

BECK

I apologize for this unfortunate...

spectacle. On behalf of everyone,

welc-

But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a

gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill

through the room. He is very ill.

GOERDELER

(to the others)

I haven't welcomed him. Not yet.

Where does he stand?

TRESCKOW

For God's sake-

19.

GOERDELER

(re: Stauffenberg)

He's a field officer. He knows the

army better than any of us. I want

to hear his opinion.

TRESCKOW

(to Stauffenberg)

All right. What do you think,

Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him

to resign? Or the central solution?

But before Stauffenberg can answer:

GOERDELER

"Central Solution." You soldiers

are all the same. Say what you

mean.

WITZLEBEN

That's a laugh coming from a

politician.

GOERDELER

The army will follow diplomats

before they follow assassins.

TRESCKOW

They follow a butcher now. What

difference does it-

STAUFFENBERG

What makes you think the army will

follow you at all?

The room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He

likes Stauffenberg already.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Oust him, kill him. That isn't what

matters. How do you plan to take

control of the government when

Hitler is gone?

Silence. Then a wave of laughter. "The balls on this

guy."

GOERDELER

I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you

are in the presence of men who

would have been Hitler's inner

circle. Instead we resigned. We put

our principles above personal gain.

20.

WITZLEBEN

We have the have the respect of the

people. And the army.

STAUFFENBERG

With all respect, sir, you put too

much faith in your popularity.

(to Goerdeler, pointed)

All of you do.

GOERDELER

Now see here, Colonel-

STAUFFENBERG

You said yourself, I'm a field

officer. You all may understand

government, but I know the men. A

great many of them may hate Hitler,

but they all fear him - they fear

Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the

Reich. That kind of fear won't just

die with Hitler. And as for

respect: the army, and the people,

respect only one thing. Authority.

And if just one man questions that

authority, you can lose them all.

(to Beck, pointed)

They were fooled into following

Hitler... How will you fool them -

force them - into following you?

BERTHOLD

What do you mean you quit?

STAUFFENBERG

I came to join the Resistance, not

some sewing circle of discarded

generals and politicians.

23.

BERTHOLD

Beck is a just and capable man. As

for Goerdeler, well, he's popular.

He'll make a good Chancellor.

STAUFFENBERG

Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately

I have to wonder if Germany is even

fit to choose her own destiny.

BERTHOLD

You can't blame the people for

this. You have to see the beginning

of something to know how it'll end.

It's no different than a farmer

watching the corn grow. One day

it's over his head.

STAUFFENBERG

Plenty of people thought-

BERTHOLD

The greatest offenders are not the

ones who thought better but the

ones who sensed better.

STAUFFENBERG

What are you trying to say?

BERTHOLD

I seem to remember you telling me

about reports from the Ukraine -

the SS forcing Jews to dig their

own graves. You said then that

Hitler should be removed. An

officer's duty, you said. What's

changed?

STAUFFENBERG

I said senior officers. The only

men that can get to him.

BERTHOLD

Perhaps it doesn't matter that you

succeed.

Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but:

BERTHOLD (CONT'D)

Perhaps it only matters that you

try. Don't you see? Someone has to

stand up and show the world that

not all of us were like him.

24.

STAUFFENBERG

Even if they could remove Hitler,

they can't hope to seize power. For

God's sake, they have no plan.

BERTHOLD

Then give them one. Find a way.

BERTHOLD (CONT'D)

Evil happens when good men do

nothing.

STAUFFENBERG

Children, that is far too-

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Air-raid.

STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)

Valkyrie.

30   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 30

OLBRICHT

We've already considered Valkyrie.

It isn't suitable.

STAUFFENBERG

Not as it's currently written.

GOERDELER

Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?

TRESCKOW

Operation Valkyrie.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

The Reserve Army has thousands of

men all over the city - most of

them not even in uniform. Valkyrie

is top secret plan to mobilize

those men in a national emergency.

26.

STAUFFENBERG

Hitler designed it himself to crush

any internal unrest if he's cut off

or killed.

GOERDELER

And what use is that to us?

STAUFFENBERG

The orders could be rewritten. A

few subtle changes would put those

reserve units completely under our

command.

OLBRICHT

Yes, of course, but-

STAUFFENBERG

Now what would the High Command do

if they thought, say, the SS was

staging a coup?

OLBRICHT

They would declare a military state

of emergency.

TRESCKOW

And initiate Operation Valkyrie.

STAUFFENBERG

Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using

Hitler's   own plan and under our

command,   would automatically seize

power in   Berlin...

GOERDELER

(catching on)

While we put a new government in

place.

STAUFFENBERG

Precisely. It will seem as though

we're fighting for Hitler

Government, not against it.

GOERDELER

But only if Hitler's dead.

All eyes turn to Goerdeler. Here we go.

GOERDELER (CONT'D)

That is what you're saying, isn't

it? The central solution.

27.

GOERDELER (CONT'D)

How else will you make people

believe the SS is trying to seize

power?

STAUFFENBERG

I'm afraid it's the only way.

GOERDELER

I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I

thought a man of your background

would appreciate a more-

STAUFFENBERG

I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat

second.

GOERDELER

Yes, but-

STAUFFENBERG

And you're neither, Doctor. Now if

you want to be Chancellor, you'll

do as you're told.

A moment of tension. Humiliated, Goerdeler nods. But

he won't ever forget this...

BECK

(to Tresckow)

Can this plan be made to work?

TRESCKOW

Rewriting the order is one thing -

distributing it is another. A bomb

can be disarmed, recovered if it

fails. In this case we'd be

willfully circulating written

evidence of high treason.

(thinks)

It's the best idea we've heard yet.

OLBRICHT

There is one... small problem.

TRESCKOW

(realizing)

Fromm...

GOERDELER

Who is Fromm?

28.

TRESCKOW

Commander of the Home Army.

Olbricht can put the reserve troops

on alert, but only Fromm can

actually initiate Valkyrie.

BECK

Can we get to him?

OLBRICHT

He's a careerist pig.

STAUFFENBERG

But one who's gone as high as he

can go in Hitler's Army. It's no

secret he's not happy about it.

TRESCKOW

Perhaps if we offered him a key

position in the new regime he could

be made to see the light.

BECK

We don't seem to have a choice.

Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie.

(to Olbricht and Stauffenberg)

Get him.

31   INT. WAR MINISTRY - WAITING ROOM - DAY                    31

29.

KEITEL

You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat

one at that. I'd have you sent to

the front if I didn't think you'd

surrender just to be Montgomery's

whore.

HERBER

The... General will see you now.

32   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS           32

FROMM

What is it you want?

FROMM (CONT'D)

Well, Olbricht? Speak up.

OLBRICHT

I wanted to introduce you to our

new man - Colonel Stauffenberg.

FROMM

Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd

offer my hand but you might not

give it back.

STAUFFENBERG

I'd say the General's lost more

important things this morning.

30.

Freeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and

laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and

nudging it toward them.

FROMM

About time they put a man with

balls in this office. Have a seat.

(to Olbricht)

You too, if you must.

They sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and

exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for

awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and

no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet,

the more awkward things seem. Finally:

FROMM (CONT'D)

They tell me you're critical of the

war, Colonel. Not that you don't

seem to have good reason.

STAUFFENBERG

I am critical of losing the war,

General. All wars - as in Africa -

are lost through indecision.

FROMM

In the field, you mean.

He's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler.

STAUFFENBERG

In Berlin.

FROMM

I take it that's why you're here.

To make decisions.

STAUFFENBERG

I've made my decision, General. I`m

here to help others make theirs.

Stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery.

He is quite clearly indicating that he means more.

Fromm knows it, but he's being coy.

FROMM

They say when there's no clear

option, one should do nothing.

STAUFFENBERG

We're at war. We must act.

Sometimes... rashly.

31.

FROMM

Just what sort of rash action did

you have in mind, Colonel?

STAUFFENBERG

That would be a decision for the

Supreme Military Commander.

Fromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag.

FROMM

Supreme Commander, you say.

STAUFFENBERG

Second only to the Chancellor.

FROMM

If only I were that man... This war

would be going quite differently.

OLBRICHT

We were thinking the very same

thing.

Fromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious.

Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. "What the hell

are you doing?"

Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the

ashtray and picks up the telephone.

Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves -

certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm

doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects

the line. When he is certain that it is dead:

FROMM

I don't need to remind you that

we've all sworn an oath. That said,

I'm going to forget we had this

conversation with the understanding

that such speak will never occur

under this roof again. Am I clear?

STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT

Yes, sir.

FROMM

Tell   your friends that I always

come   down on the right side. And as

long   as the Fuhrer is alive, you

know   what side that is.

32.

FROMM (CONT'D)

(raising his hand)

Heil Hitler.

TRESCKOW

Looking this over, I'm not

satisfied that the Reserve Army is

enough to shut down Berlin

completely.

STAUFFENBERG

(handing over papers)

Yes, I've been giving that some

thought. We should include any

field units that are home on leave.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

I've also drawn up an outline for

orders to streamline combat groups

in order to quietly concentrate

forces at vital points - state and

government buildings, of course,

but also the radio and newspapers.

34.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Combat groups will be reorganized

as reinforced grenadier regiments.

One or two of them can be quickly

mobilized, eliminating the usual

six hour lag. We blitz the

government quarter, arrest all

Ministers and Party leaders,

surround all SS and police

barracks. Any officers who resist

will be arrested... or shot.

38   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - LATER                              38

STAUFFENBERG

(to the Fraulein)

If anyone comes to you, play

ignorant. Just tell them-

FRAULEIN OVEN

I'll tell that I was serving the

German people. Then I'll tell them

to go to hell.

TRESCKOW

To Operation Valkyrie.

35.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

I've been transferred to the front.

STAUFFENBERG

(shocked)

Why didn't you tell me?

TRESCKOW

Would you have stayed?

Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg.

STAUFFENBERG

Do you think Fromm reported us?

TRESCKOW

It's more likely just... an

unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it

doesn't matter. You wrote the

orders. You know them better than

anyone.

STAUFFENBERG

You don't mean to say-

TRESCKOW

I'm appointing you military leader

of the Resistance. Beck agrees.

STAUFFENBERG

But Olbricht-

TRESCKOW

We both know Olbricht hasn't the

wit or the spine. No. It's you.

A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's

mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

One more thing. You were right what

you said that first night. It's not

enough to kill Hitler. We need to

isolate his chain of command. The

slightest confusion could crush us.

We need to be certain that no

conflicting orders get out after

the flash.

Stauffenberg considers this for a moment.

36.

STAUFFENBERG

That greatly limits our options of

where and when to make our move,

but it's the only way.

TRESCKOW

How will you do it?

STAUFFENBERG

Perhaps it's better I don't say.

TRESCKOW

God promised Abraham that he would

not destroy Sodom if he could find

just ten righteous men.

TRESCKOW (CONT'D)

I have a feeling that for Germany

it may come down to one.

FELLGIEBEL

You realize how close I am to

Hitler. With one word I could have

the Gestapo make you disappear.

STAUFFENBERG

Why haven't you then?

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

None of my associates know we've

been talking if that's what you're

afraid of.

FELLGIEBEL

But you know. And when the SS catch

you, they'll pull you apart like

warm bread. It'll be a crime just

to have known you then. I warn you.

If it means protecting myself, I

will expose you. Do not try to

contact me again.

STAUFFENBERG

You can't report me. Maybe if you

had when I first approached you,

you'd have been keeping your oath.

But now you're just as guilty as-

FELLGIEBEL

So you think that makes me a

sympathizer, eh? You give a man the

choice of betraying a fellow

officer or his Fuhrer and assume

his actions will show you his

heart. It's not that simple.

38.

STAUFFENBERG

It is to me.

FELLGIEBEL

For the last time, don't push me to

make a decision.

STAUFFENBERG

I have no choice. It's clear now

that without you we have no hope of

success.

Pause. Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

You want us to succeed. Don't you?

FELLGIEBEL

And what if you do, eh? What then?

Will you be any different from

Hitler? What of his Reich, his

people, the very momentum of

history? Will all of that let you

be something he isn't?

STAUFFENBERG

No.

FELLGIEBEL

There it is.

STAUFFENBERG

But my pregnant wife, our four

children, the Germany I first swore

to defend... They demand that I be

something different. They demand

that I fight for their future even

if it means...

And for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back

what may be tears.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Even if it means that I never see

them again.

In that moment we see a side of Stauffenberg we were

starting to doubt existed. We see his humanity. This

puts Fellgiebel in his place. He adjusts his tie and

we see the wedding ring on his finger.

39.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Action is inevitable. As are the

consequences. When they come for me

I'll do what I can to hide what you

knew and when you knew it.

(stepping closer now)

But don't delude yourself. You were

involved in a crime against your

country long before you met me.

There's still time to redeem

yourself. Only God can judge you

now.

DRUNKEN OFFICER

Are you two finished or just

getting started?

41   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY           41

STAUFFENBERG

Leave us, please.

OLBRICHT

You play the part of bureaucrat

beautifully.

STAUFFENBERG

It's the only time I can relax.

40.

OLBRICHT

There's a man here to interview as

your adjutant.

STAUFFENBERG

Adjut- What for?

OLBRICHT

No one told you?

(obviously not)

You've been promoted Chief of Staff

for the Reserve Army.

Some men might find a promotion to be good news. Not

Stauffenberg.

STAUFFENBERG

For Christ's sake. Don't I have

enough to do?

OLBRICHT

Unfortunately, your nocturnal

activities don't count as service

to the Reich.

STAUFFENBERG

I'll refuse the promotion.

OLBRICHT

You'll do no such thing.

STAUFFENBERG

Dammit, I can't handle the work I

already-

OLBRICHT

This is an opportunity we could

never have dreamed of. You're in

the inner circle now - with genuine

access to Hitler, his advisors, his

schedule... We need this.

STAUFFENBERG

We're not ready. We're moving too

fast.

OLBRICHT

Not half as fast as the Allies. An

invasion is coming, Colonel. Any

day now. We must act and we must

act soon.

41.

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

Tresckow may have left you in

charge of the "central solution,"

but in this world I still outrank

you. You will accept the

appointment. Is that understood?

Stauffenberg nods, grudgingly.

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

Now. The new man is waiting

outside. He comes highly

recommended. He might even be an

ideal candidate.

STAUFFENBERG

For what?

OLBRICHT

(smiling)

We still need an assassin.

Olbricht leaves. Stauffenberg lets this sink in. He

takes a seat and goes back to work. After a moment:

A HANDSOME SOLDIER (36) quietly enters.

TITLES: LIEUTENANT WERNER VON HAEFTEN - RESERVIST.

WOUNDED DURING THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN.

Haeften clicks his heels and offers the Nazi salute,

but before he can say the words:

STAUFFENBERG

Be seated.

Thrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing,

ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of

Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks:

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Do you know how this war will end,

Haeften? The portrait will be un-

hung... And the man will be hung.

Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to

such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He

sighs, too tired to play games.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Bottom line. I'm engaged in high

treason with all means available to

me. Can I count you in?

42.

HAEFTEN

For anything, sir. Anything at all.

STAUFFENBERG

Anything is a very dangerous word.

The Allied Forces have blundered

HAEFTEN

Five thousand ships, one-hundred

What about the Panzer divisions in-

HAEFTEN

They were never dispatched. Word is

Hitler took a sleeping pill. His

staff was afraid to wake him.

43.

STAUFFENBERG

First Africa, now France.

HAEFTEN

The Russians bearing down from the

East.

STAUFFENBERG

Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real

aim is to leave nothing but

scorched earth for all of Europe.

HAEFTEN

Maybe this is a blessing in

disguise. Maybe he'll finally

listen to reason - consider a truce

while he still can.

STAUFFENBERG

We'll see if I can't convince him.

You don't need to search him.

HERBER

Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored

guest. The hero of Africa.

FROMM

For God's sake, Stauffenberg,

you're-

FROMM (CONT'D)

... they're waiting for you.

45   INT. THE BERGHOF - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT                45

45.

We have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi

Germany on the day after the Normandy invasion. But

you would never know the tide of the war had just

turned against Germany. A series of situation maps

are scattered before them, ignored.

Only Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but

clearly tuned into the present reality. Looking

closer at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up -

adding to the already surreal nature of the scene.

It is also the first time we are allowed a clear,

unobstructed view of Hitler.

FROMM

Mein Fuhrer... I wish to present

Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg -

our new Chief of General Staff for

the Replacement Army.

The laughter stops. Hitler and his cronies turn

toward Stauffenberg, looking him over. Hitler stands

and crosses to him. Fromm meets him first, whispering

in the Fuhrer's ear - perhaps reminding him who

Stauffenberg is. Hitler nods: "Ah yes." He takes

Stauffenberg's left hand with both of his. We are

surprised by his charm.

HITLER

May I say, I am honored to meet a

hero who has sacrificed so much for

Germany. If only more of my

officers were like you.

Hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to

themselves. To make it worse, Hitler turns to them.

HITLER (CONT'D)

Let this man stand as an example to

all of you. He is the ideal German

officer.

Fromm nervously clears his throat.

FROMM

Mein Fuhrer, we have asked

Stauffenberg here today so that he

might brief us on mobilizing troops

from the Home Army to support those

in Normandy.

46.

HITLER

Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will

no longer be necessary. General

Goering has assured me that

Normandy is under control.

STAUFFENBERG

Mein Fuhrer, if I may... The

situation in Normandy is-

KEITEL

You're dismissed, Stauffenberg.

STAUFFENBERG

But-

KEITEL

Send your man home, Fromm. Then

bring us some brandy.

STAUFFENBERG

Heil Hitler.

I'll do it myself.

STAUFFENBERG

Who else, then? Who can even get as

close?

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Valkyrie is very clear. Once the

order is given, the Reserve Army

will automatically seize control of

the government with or without me.

48.

BECK

Orders are not enough. They need a

man to follow. The right man.

STAUFFENBERG

Olbricht will oversee operations in

my absence. I can be back in Berlin

three hours after Hitler is-

BECK

Three very crucial hours.

STAUFFENBERG

We both know there's no other way.

BECK

I'll tell the others-

BECK (CONT'D)

I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I

won't be there to see it.

STAUFFENBERG

Nonsense. You're stronger than you

think. You might just be the

strongest one of all.

Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half

talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a

word she is saying - he is miles away.

He looks over at his children. One would never

suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and

that the country is facing total devastation.

NINA

...After that I thought I'd take

the children to the country for a

few days to see my- Claus?

He snaps out of his thoughts. "Hmmm?"

NINA (CONT'D)

Have you heard a word I said?

STAUFFENBERG

The country...

(thinking)

Nina. Listen. I want you to delay

your trip. Just for a while.

She wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally:

NINA

Does this have something to do

with... your work?

STAUFFENBERG

I would just be more comfortable

knowing where you are - until I'm

back from Berlin. Things will be

different then. I promise.

Long pause. Once again, a couple who know each other

well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina

is worried but strong.

NINA

How long until... until we see you?

STAUFFENBERG

A few days. If all goes well. Then

we can travel as a family.

NINA

And if things... don't go well?

He hesitates.

Enough explosive to cripple a

Your fuses. British time pencils.

51.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

When you're ready to arm, attach

the detonator to the bottom of the

time pencil, like so...

(demonstrating)

...Insert the entire device into

either end of the plastic-W, crush

the acid capsule and you're live.

When the acid eats through the wire

holding back the trigger spring...

Well... You'll want to be very far

away.

OLBRICHT

What if they search your bag?

STAUFFENBERG

I'm one of the inner circle now.

They'll make sure I am who I am.

Beyond that, they won't touch me.

(to Mertz)

How much time do I have?

MERTZ

Theoretically there's a 30-minute

delay. But with the kind of heat

you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,

I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.

HAEFTEN

That's... hardly precise.

MERTZ

This is state of the art. You can

have small or precise. Not both.

OLBRICHT

Might this be just a little too

small?

MERTZ

The explosion won't do the killing.

The air in the room will.

He points to the drawing - an overhead sketch of:

MERTZ (CONT'D)

Hitler's bunker is constructed of

reenforced concrete. A steel door,

no windows. Just one of these

explosives in a space like that

will cause tremendous air pressure.

52.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

Enough to instantly kill everyone

present. The second charge will be

entirely redundant.

OLBRICHT

Of course, I'm all for redundancy.

However... If, by some miracle,

Hitler does survive, what then?

STAUFFENBERG

We have an inside man at the Wolf's

Lair in communications. He'll

notify you immediately following

the flash and then sever all

contact with the outside world.

The others are stunned.

OLBRICHT

Just how did you manage that?

STAUFFENBERG

It's my job, isn't it? While

Hitler's inner circle is still

regrouping, you will initiate

Valkyrie and seize control in Paris

and Berlin. Even if Hitler

survives, we'll have momentum.

MERTZ

(to Olbricht)

But as   you said yourself it would

take a   miracle. Anyone in that

bunker   when just one of these goes

off is   not coming out alive.

Haeften places the items back in the briefcases.

OLBRICHT

Himmler is expected to be at the

meeting as well. Don't proceed

unless you can get them both.

STAUFFENBERG

That could be difficult.

OLBRICHT

Why kill a madman just to have a

lunatic take his place?

STAUFFENBERG

This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it?

53.

OLBRICHT

The members are in total agreement

on this.

STAUFFENBERG

Fucking politicians. I'll hold off

if the decision is unanimous. And I

want another man on the committee.

A soldier.

OLBRICHT

And just who this soldier be?

STAUFFENBERG

At ease, gentlemen.

Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to

hide his nerves.

OLBRICHT

This has been a drill. You're all

to be commended for your quick

response. Dismissed.

Pause. The men linger, confused until:

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

HEIL HITLER.

SOLDIERS

HEIL HITLER.

And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just

light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.

HAGEN

What did I tell you? A drill.

But Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at

Olbricht makes us nervous.

CLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making

note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's

uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.

OLBRICHT

That man there. Who is he?

HASE

Major Remer? He commands the

Deutschland Guard Battalion. What

about him?

OLBRICHT

Get rid of him.

HASE

Remer? Don't worry about him. He's

an order taker. To the bone.

Ah yes... But whose orders?

61.

66   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OUTSIDE FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY           66

HERBER

The General will see you now.

67   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER         67

FROMM

How dare you put the Reserve Army

on standby without my knowledge.

You damn near cost me my

commission. What in God's name made

you think you even had the

authority?

OLBRICHT

It was only a drill. An exercise.

FROMM

DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We

both know it was no fucking drill.

STAUFFENBERG

General, if I may-

FROMM

You may not, Colonel. You may not

do anything. Because now you've not

only shown me you can't deliver,

you've painted a target on my back.

If I so much as sense you trying to

move the Reserve Army again, I'll

personally have you both arrested.

Do I make myself abundantly clear?

STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT

Yes, sir.

62.

FROMM

Heil Hitler.

OLBRICHT

Heil Hitler.

FROMM

I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

STAUFFENBERG

HEIL HITLER.

68   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                   68

GOERDELER

The point of your central solution

is to replace Hitler so that we can

negotiate a truce with the Allies.

The Allies, I suspect, would be

more amenable to a truce... IF WE

OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN

FUCKING BERLIN.

STAUFFENBERG

Today was a matter of indecision -

nothing more. A military operation

in the hands of a politician.

GOERDELER

I don't think I am alone when I say

your judgement is in question.

(to the others)

I would like to take a vote.

BECK

Carl.

63.

GOERDELER

I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL

STAUFFENBERG.

BECK

Carl, if I may have a word with you

in private.

GOERDELER

If you have something to say,

Ludwig, say it here. Say it now.

BECK

Very well. There's no need to vote.

Beck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. Stauffenberg

stiffens, ready for the axe.

BECK (CONT'D)

I consider you a friend. And I look

forward to the day when we can once

again live as free men. But you've

become a liability.

Goerdeler smiles smugly. But the smile fades when

Beck turns, offering a drink to him.

BECK (CONT'D)

I'm sorry it has to be this way.

GOERDELER

Wha... What are you saying?

BECK

Fellgiebel informed me this

evening... Himmler's issued an

order for your arrest. You'll have

to leave Germany. Tonight. When

we've succeeded with the central

solution you'll return as

Chancellor. Until then-

Goerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg.

GOERDELER

This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T

IT? You can't just get rid of me

like this. I am the man Germany

will follow. I'm... I...

Stauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler

looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going

to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears:

64.

GOERDELER (CONT'D)

Ludwig, I-

Beck offers him an envelope.

BECK

Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with

anyone.

Ugly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks

out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck

coughs, turns to Stauffenberg.

BECK (CONT'D)

No more indecision. From now on,

Stauffenberg has discretion.

OLBRICHT

I can't issue Valkyrie again unless

we follow through. If he fails to-

STAUFFENBERG

I'll do my job. You just take

Berlin.

INT. STAUFFENBERG'S BERLIN FLAT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A telephone. Stauffenberg's three fingered

hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame.

STAUFFENBERG (V.O.)

I'd like to place a call to

Bamberg, please.

INT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BAMBERG - NIGHT

Nina and her children eat supper around a single

candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout. Though

Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but.

ANGLE ON: The silent telephone in the foreground. We

wait for it to ring, but it never does.

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

Beck enters to find Stauffenberg in the front pew,

staring at Christ on the cross.

65.

BECK

Have you made your peace with God,

then?

STAUFFENBERG

As best I can.

BECK

Then you have nothing to fear.

Stauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits.

STAUFFENBERG

I know the soldier inside me is a

traitor. I wonder how I'll be

judged as a man.

BECK

By history?

STAUFFENBERG

By God.

BECK

In the end, we answer only to

ourselves.

Stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from

the chain around his neck.

BECK (CONT'D)

Did you reach your wife?

STAUFFENBERG

Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get

through.

BECK

Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.

They're safe. You've seen to that.

(realizing...)

To think... You came to us a

wounded soldier from Africa. Now...

Now you are both the architect and

the assassin. I'm still trying to

understand how this came to be.

STAUFFENBERG

(more to himself)

Like a farmer watching the corn

grow. One day it's over his head...

66.

BECK

What's that?

STAUFFENBERG

Nothing...

Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full

support of the Berlin Police.

BECK (CONT'D)

We can begin.

BECK (CONT'D)

Hitler has scheduled a military

briefing for today at one o'clock.

Stauffenberg will strike regardless

of who else is present.

willing, we can negotiate a truce

But that's not what he-

OLBRICHT

Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

91   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS          91

FREYEND

Gentlemen, may I present Colonel

Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief

Officer of the Reserve Army.

OFFICER #1

Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an

honor. They say you're the man that

will defend Berlin from the Red

Army single-hand-

71.

STAUFFENBERG

Indeed. I've got the whole bag of

tricks right here.

The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not

insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward

Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase.

FREYEND

Let me take that for you.

But Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a

suspicious eye. Before he can press:

VOICE (O.S.)

Colonel Stauffenberg?

Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at

the door. Everyone stands at attention.

FELLGIEBEL

At east, Gentlemen.

(to Stauffenberg)

General Fellgiebel, communications.

I just wanted to meet the hero of

Africa... And see if there's

anything you need.

STAUFFENBERG

Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a

call of the utmost importance. Even

if it comes when I am in conference

with the Fuhrer I'd appreciate it

if you had a man come and get me.

Beat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant

look of understanding.

FELLGIEBEL

Of course, Colonel.

Fellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others

return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel

bursts from his office, fixing his tie.

KEITEL

Gentlemen. The meeting has been

pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini

is arriving on the afternoon train

and Hitler wants to have lunch with

him.

Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus.

72.

STAUFFENBERG

Will Mussolini be in the briefing?

KEITEL

I only wish he were. Then some

ambitious officer might take the

opportunity to shoot the dago

bastard.

STAUFFENBERG

I'll need a place to wash up -

change my shirt.

FREYEND

Please, do be quick. You heard the

General.

92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92

HAEFTEN

(whispering)

You're arming them... now?

STAUFFENBERG

No room for error this time. Assume

I have ten minutes in this heat.

73.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Two minutes for the walk, one for

the security check and one to the

bunker. Three minutes for the walk

back. That's seven.

HAEFTEN

Leaving just three minutes to place

the bomb.

STAUFFENBERG

Plenty of time.

HAEFTEN

If the bomb goes off in ten.

93   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY                 93

FREYEND

Major Freyend speaking.

(beat)

Stauffenberg? Yes, he's arrived...

They are on their way now.

94   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                94

STAUFFENBERG

Dammit man, what is it?

FREYEND

General Keitel insists that the

Colonel please hurry.

74.

95   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY                      95

HAEFTEN

The Colonel is changing, Major. You

understand this can be difficult.

97   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY          97

STAUFFENBERG

(to Haeften)

See that the car is ready.

HAEFTEN

But sir-

STAUFFENBERG

I have everything I need,

Lieutenant. Thank you.

75.

FREYEND

Please. Let me help you with that.

STAUFFENBERG

(pulling it away)

I can manage, thank you.

98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98

STAUFFENBERG

Where are they going?

FREYEND

It's too hot. The briefing has been

moved to the conference hut.

FREYEND (CONT'D)

Sir, your briefcase. I insist.

76.

99    INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               99

In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long

table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one,

they present their individual briefings to the

nodding Fuhrer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.

STAUFFENBERG

My injuries left me a bit hard of

hearing. See that you place me as

near the Fuhrer as possible.

Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere -

wrangling everyone into the meeting.

Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his

belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing

room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the

conference hut's young telephone operator.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent

call from Berlin...

100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100

A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat.

We notice again that the windows are open to let in

some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long,

heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern

Europe and the Soviet Union.

LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and

out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in

the middle of his briefing:

GENERAL

The Eastern Front forces are

assured a victory... but they need

reinforcements.

In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't

say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by

Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:

KEITEL

Please pardon our tardiness... You

remember Colonel Stauffenberg?

77.

Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake

Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving

moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man

greeting him. The moment is broken when the General

clears his throat, continuing his presentation.

GENERAL

As you can see, Mein Fuhrer, the

situation in the East Prussian

sector is increasingly critical...

(and on and on...)

Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes

him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table -

less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in

between two other officers. We suck in wind when we

see who one of them is...

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried

the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long

ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.

Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -

bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the

briefcase - long enough to make us nervous.

He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,

sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,

leaning it against the heavy wooden table support

immediately to the right of Hitler's foot.

Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at

his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the

telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?

Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear

nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat

in his own ears - the only thing betraying his

otherwise outward calm.

He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under

his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we

stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.

Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm.

The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear.

Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption.

Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand,

indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.

78.

101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101

Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the

telephone receiver.

ADAM

General Fellgiebel, sir. He says

it's urgent.

Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend

and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private

call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg

simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.

A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the

receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway

he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.

Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still

hanging outside the briefing room.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Colonel... Colonel, you forgot your-

102   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                 102

Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map

before him as the General's presentation drags on.

Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by

Stauffenberg. His foot hits something. He looks at:

Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.

Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the

briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He

considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is

going to open it.

But then he puts it back under the table. But now the

heavy wooden support is BETWEEN Hitler and the bomb.

GENERAL

...And now I believe Colonel

Stauffenberg will present us with

his deployment for the Replacement

Army should the unthinkable occur

and the Russians reach-

Where is Stauffenberg? Keitel shoots Freyend a look.

79.

103   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       103

Freyend steps into the hall. No sign of Stauffenberg.

Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused.

FREYEND

Where the hell is Stauffenberg?

But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat.

104   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - DAY          104

Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as

Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks

toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm.

INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the

conference table, leaning on his elbows.

A MASSIVE, EAR-SPLITTING EXPLOSION lifts the table

up, throwing Hitler back and simultaneously

vaporizing the men standing on either side of him.

EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY

The hut explodes outward like a house of cards.

Bodies are thrown clear. Everyone hits the deck

except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.

A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The

sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and

ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting.

Screaming. Absolute chaos.

Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned.

Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building

and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.

STAUFFENBERG

Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.

Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed

with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever

all communications.

Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call.

Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car -

still driven by young Lt. Kretz.

80.

He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that

he does not think to get out and open the door for

his passengers. Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz,

pushing Haeften in the back.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

(to Kretz)

Drive.

(Kretz lingers)

LIEUTENANT.

Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear,

speeding off down the forested trail. Stauffenberg

and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total

destruction. Bodies are carried out of the demolished

hut - the grounds littered with the wounded.

Surly there is no way the Fuhrer could have survived.

105   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - DAY                           105

Fellgiebel holds a phone to his ear.

FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)

I said Olbricht. General Olbricht

at the War Ministry. The call is

urgent.

A breathless COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER enters, pointing

in mute shock to the ruin outside.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

What the hell just happened?

FELLGIEBEL

What does it look like? The Fuhrer

is-

Fellgiebel freezes, something catching his eye.

COME AROUND TO HIS P.O.V. Share his horror. Through

the window, Fellgiebel has a clear view of the

conference hut, or rather what's left.

HITLER - limping, dazed, his clothes in tatters - is

being led from the smoldering ruins. He is very much:

FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)

Alive...

81.

106   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - INNER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         106

Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first

checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD

approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes.

STAUFFENBERG

We have to get to the airfield at

once. Orders form the Fuhrer.

The guard signals his men to remove the barricade.

107   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER                    107

Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry

in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders.

This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly.

He plays up his distress for his audience.

FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)

I am calling from The Wolf's Lair

with urgent news for the General.

Something terrible has happened...

Then he turns his back, lowers his voice.

FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)

(whispering)

The Fuhrer is still alive.

VOICE (ON PHONE)

I'm sorry. Please come again.

But Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to

hear. Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up.

FELLGIEBEL

Sever all communications.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

Sir?

FELLGIEBEL

DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST

DO IT.

108   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY                108

Olbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into

the phone.

82.

MERTZ

I didn't hear you. Come again.

Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL.

But it's no use. Mertz slowly hangs up the phone.

OLBRICHT

Well, what did he say?

MERTZ

I... couldn't be sure. It sounded

as though he said... Hitler is

still alive.

Olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating.

OLBRICHT

Get him back on the line.

MERTZ

Sir... The bomb did go off. That

much was clear. Fellgiebel's next

step will be to sever all

communications.

Olbricht is confused. Frozen.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.

We initiate Valkyrie regardless.

OLBRICHT

Only Fromm can initiate. You know

that.

MERTZ

Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead.

Or arrest him. But do it now.

But Olbricht is frozen.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

Sir... Did you hear me? You have to

give the order to initiate

Valkyrie. This is our only-

OLBRICHT

I'm not doing anything until I talk

to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the

phone. NOW.

Mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll

never get through.

83.

109   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         109

Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods

toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new

road barriers are in place. This is not good.

One SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from

the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop.

KOLBE

No one gets in or out.

STAUFFENBERG

We're on orders from the Fuhrer. We

have to get to the airfield

immediately. You will step aside.

KOLBE

I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-

Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a

beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him.

110   INT. GUARDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                110

Stauffenberg snatches up the telephone before Kolbe

and his men can stop him.

STAUFFENBERG

Get me General Keitel.

Stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his

brow. With the guards hovering over him, he turns and

casually sits on the desk, blocking the phone with

his body. He surreptitiously rests his hand on the

telephone cradle, hanging up. He talks to no one.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg

here. I can't get past the outer

gate. A Sergeant...

He looks at Kolbe. Kolbe swallows.

KOLBE

Kolbe.

STAUFFENBERG

Sergeant Kolbe says no one is

getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you

can explain it to him.

84.

Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard,

bluffing harder. Kolbe considers the phone. Finally:

KOLBE

That won't be necessary, Colonel.

111   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LATER    111

A humiliated Kolbe watches Stauffenberg's car speed

away from the open barriers. Free.

112   INT. CAR - DAY                                          112

Silence but for the chattering engine. Kretz is

distracted by movement in the rearview mirror.

P.O.V. IN REARVIEW MIRROR. Haeften rummages through

his briefcase, removing objects Kretz can't make out

- tossing them, one by one, into the woods. Haeften

realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror

and shoots him a look. "Mind your own business."

Kretz returns his attention to the road. But

something just isn't sitting right with him...

113   EXT. AIRFIELD - RASTENBURG - DAY                        113

TITLES: 1:15 PM.

Stauffenberg and Haeften climb aboard a waiting

plane. A beat later it is rolling down the runway.

MERTZ (V.O.)

Every second we stand here arguing

is a second lost.

114   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             114

Olbricht is calm - in full denial. He straightens his

tie in the mirror as Mertz paces the room, flustered.

OLBRICHT

I can't initiate Valkyrie without

confirmation that Hitler's dead.

It's too great a risk.

85.

MERTZ

What about Stauffenberg? What about

his risk? He did his part and now

you're abandoning him.

OLBRICHT

Watch yourself, Colonel.

MERTZ

Shouldn't you be consulting Beck?

OLBRICHT

I know just what Beck will say.

He's a dying man. What does he have

to lose?

He puts on his hat and coat now, turning to leave.

MERTZ

At least put the Reserve Army on

alert.

OLBRICHT

I can't cover up another false

alarm. When Stauffenberg returns,

when he gives me confirmation. Then

we'll proceed.

Mertz is speechless. As Olbricht walks out:

MERTZ

And where are you going?

OLBRICHT

The same place you are. Lunch.

115   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                             115

Keitel sits at his desk, listening intently to

someone O.S. Although his wounds are superficial, he

certainly took a beating in the blast.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

ADAM

The one-eyed Colonel...

KEITEL

Stauffenberg.

86.

ADAM

He left the building very abruptly -

just before the explosion.

KEITEL

Several men left the building

before the explosion.

ADAM

Yes, sir. Of course. But...

KEITEL

But what? Spit it out, man.

ADAM

Well. The Colonel left his hat.

Keitel's expression sours. "Is that all you've got

for me?" He is about to say so when that prick

Freyend barges in, also banged up. With him is Kretz -

Stauffenberg's driver.

FREYEND

Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I

think you will be most interested

to hear what this man has to say.

116   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               116

TITLES: 2:00 PM.

Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away.

Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh

cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray

says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares

at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward.

His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his

files, his stationery, framed photographs of his

family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler.

Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks

again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery...

"Fuck it."

He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a

typewriter.

87.

117   INT. WAR MINISTRY - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY         117

Mertz approaches a LOWLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATOR.

Awkward pause. A struggle with the soul. Then he

hands over a sheet of paper.

MERTZ

Orders from General Olbricht.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

118   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              118

Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi

communications. Again the teletypes busily chatter

away. And again, Sgt. Helm is curious, watching:

STANDBY FOR OPERATION VALKYRIE...

The TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. "What do I

do?" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight

Lt. Haan - oblivious. Helm shrugs.

HELM

Send it through. But keep me

informed.

A SHRILL WHISTLE takes us to...

EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY

Once again RESERVISTS and CADETS rush to their homes

and scramble to put on their uniforms.

119   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  119

The siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the

pillared stronghold. Tanks and heavy equipment are

once again made ready.

General Hase issues the alert signal just as he did

before, watching the men of the Reserve Army

scramble. In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen.

HAGEN

Here we go again.

He says this to:

88.

Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time

is even more suspicious now.

121   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                  121

A light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S.

We get our first good look at the demolished briefing

hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers

crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Fuhrer himself

heading this procession. He wears new clothes,

nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian

O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he

was damn near blown to bits just hours ago.

COME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO

MUSSOLINI speaking an incessant stream of Italian.

HITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's

blathering falls literally on deaf ears.

122   EXT. AIRFIELD - RANGSDORF - DAY                          122

TITLES: 3:15 PM.

Three hours have passed since the explosion.

Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The

airfield is surprisingly calm. No car to meet them.

STAUFFENBERG

Quiet, isn't it?

Too quiet.

HAEFTEN

I'll see where our driver is.

Haeften walks over to the office. Stauffenberg looks

around the airfield. The silence slowly becomes

unnerving. He goes after Haeften.

123   INT. AIRFIELD OFFICE - DAY                               123

Stauffenberg enters just in time to hear:

HAEFTEN (INTO PHONE)

You mean to tell me that the alert

is only just going out-

Stauffenberg swipes the phone from Haeften.

89.

STAUFFENBERG (INTO PHONE)

This is Stauffenberg. Get me

General Olbricht.

124   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY            124

Olbricht storms in, furious. He stands over Mertz,

waving a document in his face - the very same

document Mertz typed on Olbricht's stationery.

OLBRICHT

Explain this.

MERTZ

Someone had to do something while

you were playing dead.

OLBRICHT

We don't know that the Fuhrer is

not alive. We don't know any-

MERTZ

THIS IS ABOUT GERMANY, FOR GOD'S

SAKE. NOT YOU. BE A MAN.

Before a fuming Olbricht can respond, the phone

rings. Both men look at it - Olbricht is afraid to

answer. Mertz shakes his head and picks up.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

General Olbricht's office.

He looks at Olbricht grimly, holding out the phone.

MERTZ (CONT'D)

Stauffenberg for you, sir.

Olbricht would rather take a live cobra than handle

the phone right now. But take it he does.

125   INT. AIRFIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                      125

(Note: Intercut between Olbricht and Stauffenberg.)

STAUFFENBERG

It's been three hours, Olbricht.

What the hell have you been doing?

OLBRICHT

We've had no confirmation that-

90.

STAUFFENBERG

Dammit man, I saw the explosion

myself. Nothing else matters now.

We are committed.

Olbricht sits, color draining from his face. A real

"what have I done" moment.

OLBRICHT

Dear God.

STAUFFENBERG

Now where is Fromm? Is he with us

or did you-

OLBRICHT

I- No one has spoken to him yet.

Stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious -

for the first and only time showing us a crack in his

ultra-cool exterior. He collects himself and looks at

his watch.

STAUFFENBERG

Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind

Germany. Never mind Europe. Your

life is at stake now, do you

understand? If you want to live

through the night you'll do exactly

as I say.

OLBRICHT

I understand.

STAUFFENBERG

The second you hang up the phone,

initiate Operation Valkyrie in

Fromm's name. Then go over to his

office in force, give him the

choice to join us or place him

under immediate arrest. Do I make

myself perfectly clear?

OLBRICHT

I understand.

STAUFFENBERG

I am at the airfield now. I will be

in Fromm's office in fifteen

minutes. Be there when I arrive.

He slams the phone down, taking us to:

91.

126   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             126

Silence. With shaking hands, Olbricht moves the

portrait of Hitler, exposing a hidden wall safe from

which he removes, at last, a thick folder marked:

VALKYRIE

He looks at Mertz.

OLBRICHT

Get Beck and the others. Tell them

it's time.

Relieved, Mertz nods and rushes out. Olbricht picks

up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from

the first page of the Valkyrie order.

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

This is General Olbricht calling on

behalf of General Fromm - Commander

of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is

dead. A group of radicals from the

SS are attempting to seize control

of the government. Operation

Valkyrie is in effect. All military

districts, training schools and

replacement troops are to take

control of essential government

offices at once...

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

127   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              127

Lt. Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his

shoulder. He turns to find Sgt. Helm, a sheet of

paper in his trembling hands.

HELM

The Fuhrer is dead.

Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When

he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some

with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a

sense of relief.

A phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes

seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's

death starts to spread.

92.

Long pause. Haans struggles with the sheer size of

the moment.

HAANS

You all know your jobs. Get to

work.

Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their

teletypes, passing orders along.

But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him

informed - notices something strange about one order

in a stack of many he is sifting through.

OPERATOR

Sergeant. This order is signed by

Witzleben.

HELM

(taking the paper)

That's ridiculous. He`s not even in

the army anymore.

But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange.

Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering

how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi:

HELM (CONT'D)

Pass the order along.

128   EXT. DEUTSCHLAND GUARD BATTALION - DAY                  128

RESERVE SOLDIERS are marched into readiness. Vehicles

moved into place. As they await further orders...

FROMM (V.O.)

Who told you the Fuhrer was dead?

129   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                129

Mertz and a sheepish Olbricht stand before Fromm. A

stunned Lt. Herber hovers by the door.

OLBRICHT

General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's

Lair.

Fromm is at a loss for words. This just can't be so.

He picks up the phone.

93.

FROMM (INTO PHONE)

This is Fromm. Put me through to

The Wolf's Lair.

OLBRICHT

There's no use calling, all

communication lines are-

FROMM (INTO PHONE)

Yes. General Fromm for Field

Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

Mertz and Olbricht are shocked that he got through.

130   INT. WOLF'S LAIR - KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY                 130

Keitel is still nursing a few wounds.

FROMM (ON PHONE)

What's going on up there? The most

incredible rumors are circulating

in Berlin.

Immediately suspicious, Keitel plays dumb, leading...

KEITEL

I don't know what you mean.

Everything's in order here.

Keitel looks out the window at the still smoldering

ruins of the conference hut in the distance.

FROMM

There's talk the Fuhrer's been

assassinated.

KEITEL

Another failed attempt. The Fuhrer

was never in danger.

(beat)

By the way, where is your man

Colonel Stauffenberg?

131   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                 131

FROMM

Stauffenberg? On his way back to

Berlin, I should think.

At the very mention of his name, Olbricht starts

squirming.

94.

KEITEL (ON PHONE)

Let me know when he arrives. I'd

like a word with him.

FROMM

Certainly.

Click. After a beat, Fromm hangs up, smug.

FROMM (CONT'D)

A false alarm. The Fuhrer is fine.

Herber's outward relief stands in sharp contrast to

Olbricht's barely contained dread. Then:

VOICE (O.S.)

That's a lie.

All eyes turn to see Stauffenberg and Haeften appear

in the doorway. Mertz lets out a sigh of relief as

they push their way past Herber and march into the

room.

STAUFFENBERG

Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie

is in effect.

Fromm stands, pounding his fist on the desk.

FROMM

OPERATION VAL- WHO GAVE THE ORDER?

STAUFFENBERG

You did.

FROMM

THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TREASON.

STAUFFENBERG

Be that as it may, the Reserve Army

is assuming control here in Berlin.

We trust you'll join us.

FROMM

Dammit, man. Do you realize what

you've done? The Fuhrer is a-

STAUFFENBERG

I delivered the bomb myself. I saw

the blast. He is dead.

Fromm is stunned on several levels. He slowly sits

back in his chair.

95.

CLOSE ON: Lt. Herber, who sees Stauffenberg as the

model Nazi, is more shocked by this than the news of

Hitler's death.

FROMM

This can't be happening. It's some

kind of joke.

STAUFFENBERG

Are you with us or not?

FROMM

Colonel, if what you say is true

you should shoot yourself at once.

(to the others)

The rest of you are under arrest.

STAUFFENBERG

No, General. You are.

And with those words, Haeften and Mertz draw their

pistols, training them on the confused Fromm. Herber

is paralyzed - unsure of what to do.

FROMM

I don't know where you think this

is going, but I suggest you men

change into civilian clothes and

find a place to hide.

STAUFFENBERG

(to Haeften)

Lock him upstairs in his private

quarters. Make sure his phone lines

are cut.

132   INT. WAR MINISTRY- HALLWAY - DAY                       132

Stauffenberg, Mertz and Olbricht march with great

purpose. They are joined by Beck, coming the other

way, wearing a plain dark suit. It is moving to see

the old man manage the long walk.

STAUFFENBERG

You're not in uniform.

BECK

This has to be seen as a movement

of the people.

Then he takes Stauffenberg's arm, letting Mertz and

Olbricht walk on, lowering his voice.

96.

BECK (CONT'D)

You're certain he's dead.

Certain? Stauffenberg can see the private fear in

beck's eyes. But before he can answer, he is

interrupted by a gasp O.S. as Olbricht opens the door

to his office, stepping back in shock. The others

turn to see what it is...

133   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             133

Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz,

Beck and Stauffenberg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with

GERMAN OFFICERS - all of them standing in silence,

looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great

respect. Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts,

solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks.

A YOUNG OFFICER steps forward. He looks hauntingly

like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa.

YOUNG OFFICER

Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're

reporting for duty.

Stauffenberg is moved beyond words. Suddenly, what

was once a small clutch of discarded generals and

politicians is now a movement of motivated men.

Stauffenberg nods, collects himself. In the crowd he

finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom

we met earlier. At first he speaks quietly, humbled.

STAUFFENBERG

(shaking hands)

Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you.

We're getting a late start and we

need all of the manpower we can

muster. Can we count on the police?

HELLDORF

There's a lot of talk that Hitler

isn't really dead. Is this true?

Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room

share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg.

STAUFFENBERG

I can't offer you any guarantees.

The decision is yours and yours

alone. Can we count on you?

97.

Long pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in

the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what

Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally:

HELLDORF

I'm with you.

Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a

palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers

in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.

STAUFFENBERG

Have your men surround the

building. No one gets in or out of

here without my permission.

(to the others)

I want every available soldier on

task - we need simultaneous control

of every government building in the

city. Dismissed.

The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them -

surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man.

BECK

Acts of vengeance will not be

tolerated. We represent a different

form of government. We represent

what is good and just in Germany.

AN EXPLOSION OF ACTIVITY:

135   INT. WAR MINISTRY - STAUFFENBERG'S OFFICE - DAY          135

Stauffenberg stands at his cluttered desk, a flurry

of activity surrounding him. He is frantically

speaking into the phone and to those present.

STAUFFENBERG

...Deploy troops to seize and

protect all Reich agencies. Of most

importance are communication

centers - newspapers, radio

stations, telephone and telegraph

offices. All Nazi officials and

government leaders are to be

arrested at once...

98.

136   INT. MILITARY COMMANDANT'S OFFICE - BERLIN - DAY         136

General Hase, the Berlin Commandant, stands before a

giant map of Berlin, addressing a roomful of NAZI

OFFICERS.

HASE

... Completely blockade the

government quarters. Everything

from the Brandenburg Gate to

Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even

generals or ministers, should be

allowed to pass.

(beat)

You have your orders, gentlemen.

Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the

Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious.

HASE (CONT'D)

Is there a problem, Major?

REMER

It just all seems very... vague,

sir. Protocol dictates we should

receive orders in writing-

HASE

These are the orders as they were

presented to me, Major. Now move.

Pause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer

clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look

on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own.

You are right to be nervous.

137   EXT. GOVERNMENT QUARTERS - BERLIN - VARIOUS - LATER      137

The city center is abuzz with soldiers and military

vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets.

SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings

with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound.

They push them into waiting trucks.

Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying

to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi

rule have told them to mind their own business.

99.

ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back,

watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen

emerges from the chaos on the streets.

HAGEN

Major Remer. We've just had orders

from the War Ministry. The

battalion is to blockade the

government quarter and place

Minister Goebbels under arrest.

Remer does not move. He just thinks.

HAGEN (CONT'D)

What is it, Major?

REMER

Something just doesn't feel right

about this. I would hate to find

out I'm being taken advantage of.

HAGEN

(realizing)

A coup you think?

REMER

Of that I am certain. What I can't

say is which side we're on. Get in.

As Hagen does, Remer turns to his DRIVER.

REMER (CONT'D)

Take us to the Reichministry. Be

quick about it.

140   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                  140

Stauffenberg, Beck and Olbricht lead a continued

effort to manage the coup. Each man shouts orders

into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent

by a steady flow of RUNNERS.

FRAULEIN VON OVEN (the secretary who worked with

Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie

orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg.

STAUFFENBERG

Send him in.

(Oven hesitates)

It's all right. Send him in.

100.

She opens the door and motions to someone outside.

After a beat, the door is filled with an almost

classic looking Nazi - A FAT GENERAL bristling with

medals. He enters the room, confused when he sees

Olbricht at Fromm's desk.

FAT GENERAL

Begging your pardon, but I have

orders to report to General Fromm.

OLBRICHT

General Fromm is no longer in

command. I am.

FAT GENERAL

I...

(seeing Beck)

Beck? What are you- What is going

on here?

STAUFFENBERG

The Fuhrer is dead. The SS is

staging a coup. We've initiated

Operation Valkyrie to crush the

uprising and save Hitler's Germany.

The Fat General assesses the scene with suspicion.

FAT GENERAL

I'd say there is a coup all right,

but it's not the SS.

Olbricht offers a sheet of paper.

OLBRICHT

You will present these orders to

your troops.

FAT GENERAL

I will do no such thing without

speaking to General Fromm. I swore

an oath-

STAUFFENBERG

You have your orders. Join us or

face the consequences.

Stauffenberg and Olbricht take an imposing step in

the Fat General's direction. He carefully backs away.

101.

FAT GENERAL

This is treason. I won't take part.

The Fuhrer is not dead. THE FUHRER

IS NOT DEAD.

The Fat General makes a break for it. The

conspirators chase him out into...

141   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                 141

The Fat General pushes past ONLOOKING OFFICERS.

OLBRICHT

STOP THAT MAN.

But they just watch the commotion, stunned. A ranking

general being chased like a common criminal. Surreal.

Haeften and Mertz appear at the other end of the hall

- pistols raised, blocking the General's path. With

Stauffenberg and Olbricht they overpower the Fat

General who screams wildly to the amazement of the

gawking officers.

FAT GENERAL

THE FUHRER IS NOT DEAD. I'VE SWORN

AN OATH. YOU ALL HAVE...

When they have him under control, Stauffenberg turns

to the onlookers. He finds a familiar face in the

crowd. A face he can trust. He finds:

STAUFFENBERG

Lt. Herber. Come here.

ANGLE ON: Lt. Herber. "Who, me?" He reluctantly steps

forward.

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

Lock him up with Fromm.

Herber hesitantly takes hold of the General, but the

act of taking a General into custody is a strange

one. Herber is clearly conflicted.

142   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DAY                                 142

Est. Remer arrives, followed by a wave of trucks.

Soldiers deploy, surrounding the building.

102.

143   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - DAY             143

Propaganda Minister Goebbels - the most ghoulish of

Hitler's Big Six. His spooky, deep-set eyes watch the

action on the street below. Already he can hear

troops coming down the hallway. He takes a pistol

from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach. Then

he picks up the phone and dials. After a beat.

GOEBBELS

I am ready to be connected.

The sound of footsteps outside his door. It bursts

open. Remer enters, followed by ARMED SOLDIERS.

GOEBBELS (CONT'D)

What can I do for you, Major?

REMER

Minister Goebbels, my battalion has

an order to blockade the government

quarter and place you under arrest.

Remer sees the pistol on Goebbels desk. But Goebbels

makes no attempt to grab for it. Instead:

GOEBBELS

Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?

Remer is caught off guard.

REMER

Yes, sir.

With that Goebbels turns his attention to the phone

in his hand. We hear a faint voice: "Hello?"

With an eerie smile, Goebbels simply extends his arm,

offering the phone to a confused Remer. Silence as

the Major takes it, holding it to his ear...

REMER (CONT'D)

Hello?

VOICE (ON PHONE)

Do you recognize my voice?

Remer is in awe, for a moment unable to speak. Then:

REMER

Of course, Mein Fuhrer.

103.

HITLER (ON PHONE)

Then listen to me very carefully...

144   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - DAY              144

The communications staff busily connects calls and

transmits orders. Sgt. Helm gingerly approaches Lt.

Haans with two sheets of paper.

HAANS

What is it now, Sergeant?

HELM

It's just that now we're getting

conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's

Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg

another.

Haans sighs, genuinely irritated now.

HAANS

Our job is not to interpret the

orders. Our job is to pass them

along. Regardless.

HELM

Yes, but sir-

HAANS

Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant?

Haans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly

walks back to his pool of radio operators.

145   EXT. REICHMINISTRY - DUSK                               145

As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the

government quarters wait for further orders.

Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and

focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING

PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them.

REMER

(re: prisoners)

Release these men at once.

HAGEN

But these men are part of a coup.

104.

REMER

I've just been on the phone with

Hitler himself. We are the coup,

you idiot. We've been duped.

146   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S QUARTERS - NIGHT            146

Fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at

a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and

reverence. The door suddenly opens.

Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General.

Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and

turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look

in Herber's eyes.

FROMM

Well, Lieutenant. What do you make

of all of this?

Herber freezes. Beat.

HERBER

I... I don't know...

FROMM

I won't ask you to make a choice.

That's for you and you alone. All I

ask is that you observe and think

for yourself. In time you'll see

things for what they truly are. You

know where to find me when you do.

Herber nods hesitantly, then turns to leave, but:

FROMM (CONT'D)

Lieutenant.

(as Herber turns back)

Heil Hitler.

Herber raises his right arm, just managing:

HERBER

Heil Hitler.

147   INT. REICHMINISTRY - GOEBBELS' OFFICE - NIGHT           147

Goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity.

Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders. Goebbels is

on two phones at the same time.

105.

Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich

Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance

is unmatched in fiction. His arrival cannot be good.

GOEBBELS

Have you seen the Fuhrer? Is he-

HIMMLER

It seems the conference table

shielded him from the blast. He's

lucky to be alive.

(looking around)

Do you want to tell me what's going

on?

GOEBBELS

Everything is under control. I've

taken charge of the Guard Battalion

and given them new orders. We're

turning the tables on these

cowards.

HIMMLER

I've been sent here personally by

the Fuhrer to collect the

conspirators. He insists they be

taken alive.

Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who

ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this

mob is obviously a fate worse than death.

Goebbels turns to a nearby AIDE.

GOEBBELS

Take this down. By order of Adolf

Hitler...

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

148   INT. CENTRAL COMMUNICATIONS - BERLIN - NIGHT           148

Once again the operators are frozen, looking at Lt.

Haans. He in turn looks at two orders in his hands.

He is deeply confused. Sgt. Helm is not.

HELM

It's a coup all right... And when

it's over, we'd better wind up on

the right side. Now we can't afford

to remain neutral any longer. We

have to make a decision.

106.

CLOSE ON: Haans. All eyes watch him weigh the

decision of his life, of many lives. Millions in

fact. Finally he relents, handing one paper to Helm.

HAANS

Very well. Send all communications

from the Wolf's Lair. Stop all

communications from Stauffenberg.

The operators spring into action.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Today an attempt was made on the

Fuhrer's life...

149   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT             149

Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of

officers - the energy here being the antithesis of

Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning.

He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone

calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. But we know

now his orders are hitting a dead end.

RADIO ANNOUNCER

...The Fuhrer himself suffered no

major injuries and resumed his work

immediately...

Stauffenberg turns off the radio, grabbing Haeften

just as he is coming in.

STAUFFENBERG

Send the following teleprint to all

Army Commanders... `Broadcast

communique not correct. The Fuhrer

is dead. Orders to be carried out

with utmost dispatch.'

Haeften nods and leaves. Stauffenberg turns back to

his work, coming face to face with a deeply troubled

Beck. Stauffenberg whispers, frustrated...

STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)

I saw the blast...

VOICE (O.S.)

What the hell kind of coup is this?

107.

All eyes turn to find Witzleben. Hours ago he was a

civilian, now he is a pompous, know-it-all General.

WITZLEBEN

The military districts are

receiving contradictory reports.

I've got men sitting around joking

about whose turn it is to arrest

whom. Neither the capital nor the

radio network are under our

control. And where are the troops?

You'd think there would be some

activity going on in this city.

(to Stauffenberg)

The word is all over the street

that Hitler is still alive. We

trusted you and you failed us. You

should have stayed. To be sure.

OLBRICHT (O.S.)

And who would have led the men here

in Berlin? You?

Finding his balls, Olbricht confronts Witzleben.

OLBRICHT (CONT'D)

The Colonel did more than any man

could have hoped. If anyone is to

blame it's-

STAUFFENBERG

Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I

am the officer in charge. I am the

man responsible. No one else.

Olbricht is moved and rightly so. Meanwhile:

WITZLEBEN

I'm going home to await my

inevitable arrest.

Witzleben turns, marching out. The room remains ill

at ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious

blow to the Resistance. Those anonymous soldiers

present exchange glances of concern.

OLBRICHT

I'm sorry, Colonel.

After a beat, Olbricht turns and leaves.

CLOSE ON LIEUTENANT HERBER, tucked away in a corner

of the office.

108.

He looks at Stauffenberg in a new light now,

something darker - no longer the admirer. He shares a

look with TWO OTHER OFFICERS. A wordless

understanding. He leaves and they follow.

150   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       150

Herber and company march down the hallway in silence.

They stop for Herber to unlock the door to...

151   INT. WAR MINISTRY - MUNITIONS STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT        151

The officers file in, making a beeline for a locker

in the corner of the room. Inside are all manner of

sub-machine guns, pistols, grenades...

HERBER

Arm yourselves.

152   EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT                                 152

Under Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard

Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry.

We see a figure moving behind the windows up above...

153   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - NIGHT             153

Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the

building below. It is only a matter of time now.

He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he

puts pen to paper and writes:

"My dearest wife..."

A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and

he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows.

The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO

COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED

SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht.

In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein

Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway.

109.

154   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - NIGHT                154

Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls

and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the

coup alive. They are startled when Fraulein Oven

bursts in. It is written on her face.

155   INT. WAR MINISTRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       155

Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's

office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS

surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines

when we see Herber talking to none other than Major

Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften.

REMER

YOU THERE.

Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run.

REMER (CONT'D)

HALT.

BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take

cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire.

Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his

right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers

of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires.

Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his

good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly.

But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the

corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with

his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him,

shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their

guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S.

As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring

around his neck:

HAEFTEN

Thank you, Colonel.

Stauffenberg is genuinely confused. "For what?"

HAEFTEN (CONT'D)

Better I die for Germany than for

Hitler.

110.

VOICE (O.S.)

Colonel Stauffenberg.

Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there.

REMER

You're under arrest.

160   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - LATER                160

Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the

last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint. A smug

Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General,

Remer and numerous GUN-TOTING OFFICERS.

FROMM

If you have any last messages,

you'd better write them now.

STAUFFENBERG

My actions speak for me.

(to his men)

I'd rather my wife and children

remember our last time together.

The others bravely nod in agreement. But then:

BECK

I'd like a pistol, please.

Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise.

BECK (CONT'D)

For personal reasons.

Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands

Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward.

REMER

General, my orders are to deliver

the prisoners alive.

FROMM

Noted, Major.

(to Beck)

Get on with it then.

REMER

But, sir-

FROMM

THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.

111.

Fromm glares at Remer who angrily backs down. Then he

turns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand:

FROMM (CONT'D)

Continue.

The moment is surreal. Beck, seated at the desk,

looks at each of his fellow conspirators. A look of

thanks, goodbye. With a badly trembling hand he

places the gun to his temple.

BECK

I'm thinking of earlier times...

CLOSE ON: The conspirators turn away, unable to

watch. Except Stauffenberg.

BANG.

And as if none of the last minute has even occurred,

Fromm turns to the other conspirators.

FROMM

Very well then... A court martial,

convened by me in the Fuhrer's

absence, has pronounced sentence:

Colonel Mertz von Quernheim,

General Olbricht, Lieutenant

Haeften...

(glaring at Stauffenberg)

And the Colonel, whose name I will

not mention, are condemned to

death.

(to his men)

Take them outside.

Remer is clearly upset by this. Herber, on the other

hand, seems clearer than ever. He nods to his men who

drag the conspirators out. Herber personally takes

Stauffenberg by the arm. The two men share a look.

Nothing needs to be said. Each has found his place.

Stauffenberg turns to confront Fromm. He is weak,

white from fatigue and loss of blood.

STAUFFENBERG

The Fuhrer will want to put us on

trial, make an example of us. This

won't win you any favor. And it

won't hide you're involvement.

FROMM

Involvement. I don't know what you-

112.

STAUFFENBERG

You knew and you did nothing.

You're just as guilty as we are.

Even more so.

FROMM

Spare me, Stauffenberg.

And those words bring a genuine smile to

Stauffenberg's face. He almost pities Fromm now.

STAUFFENBERG

No one will be spared.

And as Fromm motions for Herber to take Stauffenberg

away, we hear music, faintly at first - accompanied

by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph... It

is the piece Stauffenberg and Nina were dancing to

one night long ago... Over this:

A voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first,

crackling over the radio.

HITLER (V.O.)

My comrades. Once again - I don't

know how many times it has been now

- an attempt has been made on my

life.

INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT

A series of images of the coup being reversed as the

Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by

the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly

rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score

over the silent images of:

Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among

them are faces we recognize...

Goerdeler, dragged from a hotel bed by SS OFFICERS as

his informing INNKEEPER watches from the doorway.

TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - TRIED, 7 SEPTEMBER

161   EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT                                 161

Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi-

circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white

light and long black shadows.

Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched

into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as

they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry.

HITLER (V.O.)

I speak to you tonight for two

reasons. First, so that you can

hear my voice and know that I am

unhurt. And second, so that you may

know the details of a crime without

parallel in German history...

INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Fellgiebel is swarmed by SS in his office at the

Wolf's Lair and summarily beaten.

TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - TRIED, 10 AUGUST

EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT

TEN SOLDIERS of the Deutschland Guard Battalion

scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his

conspirators. We can clearly read Fromm's lips,

shouting: "MAKE READY..."

Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile.

Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his

hatred not on the conspirators... but on Fromm.

INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Berthold, Stauffenberg's brother, is taken from his

flat in Berlin.

114.

TITLES: BERTHOLD VON STAUFFENBERG - TRIED, 10 AUGUST

1944. HANGED, 10 AUGUST 1944.

EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT

Fromm smiles to himself, satisfied.

HITLER (V.O.)

A small clique of ambitious,

dishonorable, stupid officers have

conspired to eliminate me. Except

for a few bruises and burns, I was

completely untouched.

Fromm raises his arm, his lips reading: "TAKE AIM..."

TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - TRIED, 7 MARCH

1945. EXECUTED, 12 MARCH 1945.

Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his

lips reading: "Long live sacred German-"

Fromm drops his hand. Ten rifles open fire.

CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is

left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights

that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were

passing over the land.

HITLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I see in this the hand of

Providence... directing me to

complete my work.

And the last strains   of music resolve in a single,

sustained note as we   CRANE UP FURTHER, looking at

last to the overcast   darkness of the night sky. The

last note goes on as   if it might play forever...

Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no

longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing

of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers

coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.

Hitler's gift to Germany.
