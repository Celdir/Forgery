FADE IN:

A lake.

A forest.

A dacha.

A Saab outside the dacha.

A light within.

JACK (dark, fit, mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a

log fire. He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey.

The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the

shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet

manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and

stubble. JACK is no longer young.

A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder.

INGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses

JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps

her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across

his upper chest.

Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID

and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence.

INGRID leads JACK through the trees. Her coat has a white fur

collar. They are fresh-faced and warm from bed.

They head towards a vast and frozen lake.

JACK senses something in the woods.

Beneath the Conifers: impenetrable darkness.

JACK looks around.

Thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. There is

not the slightest breeze.

INGRID

What are you looking for?

Her Swedish accent is sing-song.

2.

JACK

Nothing.

His anxiety is evident.

INGRID laughs out loud.

INGRID

There are no wolves in the woods so

close to the city.

JACK smiles.

They continue through the woods until they reach the

shoreline of the lake.

INGRID steps onto the ice.

Holds out her hand.

A beat.

JACK takes INGRID's hand.

Solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight.

They walk out, INGRID slipping and laughing.

The landscape is magical.

JACK begins to relax, slipping and swearing.

Suddenly, he stops.

There are footprints in the thin snow going out across the

lake.

INGRID

Snow-hare.

Beside the Snow-hare's prints are those of a man.

INGRID

A hunter?

JACK studies the two sets of tracks.

Those of the Snow-hare are heading out into the lake. The

man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards

the shoreline.

JACK spins around in the direction they've just come from.

No one.

3.

INGRID

You have a gun.

INGRID

You have a gun! How do you have a

gun? Why should you carry such a

weapon?

4.

INGRID

Jack?

INGRID

Jack talk to me!

INGRID

Who is he?

JACK

A hunter.

INGRID

He's not dressed like a hunter. Why

is he alone? Hunters always go in

pairs. For safety.

JACK

Go for help. Call the police.

5.

Outside the dacha is another MAN, standing by a black

Mercedes-Benz sedan.

The second hunter.

He is holding an automatic pistol but he's not on alert.

JACK fells him easily with a bullet in the ear.

He removes the clip from his WALTHER and reloads it.

JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall.

JACK smashes the CB radio in the Mercedes and removes the

distributor cap from the engine, burying it deep in the snow.

Then he gets into the Saab.

And drives off.

Over images of: JACK on a ferry to Gotland; changing clothes

and vessels for Ystad; travelling by road to Trelleborg;

catching the night crossing to Travemunde; driving to Hamburg

and from Hamburg catching a train to...

At a fast food stand not far from the central train station,

a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog.

It is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists,

LARRY stands out as an American.

JACK does not.

JACK

Blending in?

LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the

centre of attention.

LARRY

Jack. What brings you to Rome?

JACK

I closed the Stockholm account.

6.

LARRY might be older than JACK but he doesn't seem it. His

demeanour is sprightly.

JACK

But there were complications.

Then LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man

who likes to get his hands dirty.

JACK walks beside him.

Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings.

JACK

Collateral damage. Two shooters.

Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.

LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look

at JACK.

JACK is tired.

LARRY

There's a bar across the street:

the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit

tight. Give me two hours.

JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of

the bar.

In the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One

More Cup of Coffee.

JACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted.

JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of

the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door

to the bathrooms.

He lights a cigarette.

LARRY comes in and sits opposite him.

LARRY

(genuinely shocked)

You started smoking again?

JACK exhales.

JACK

Guess so.

7.

LARRY

Since when?

JACK

Since now.

WAITER

Cafe?

LARRY

Due.

LARRY

Stockholm account. Final

installment.

LARRY

You can't stay here, Jack. You

won't see `em coming, not in a big

city. But you can't go far, either.

If the gentlemen whose accounts you

closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo,

Simenov- any of the first division-

you have four or five hours at most

before every airport, train

station, bus stop, toll booth and

ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje

is under surveillance.

JACK

So.

8.

LARRY

So. You find a hole- somewhere

nearby- and you crawl into it and

you stay put until I say it's safe

to come out.

JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.

LARRY

Turn right outside the bar then

second left. Via Spinetti. You'll

find a silver Citroen C2 with

Chieti plates. Check the glove box

and follow the map. Castelvecchio.

It's a fucking fortress. Literally.

And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone

within a three to five mile radius

you'll see `em coming.

He pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a

cellophane bag.

LARRY

Get there. Stay there.

LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his

mouth with a napkin.

LARRY

Do nothing `till you get my call.

JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash.

He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA

ENVELOPE.

Inside the envelope is:

-a PASSPORT bearing Jack's photo in the name of Edward Clarke

-a DRIVER'S LICENSE in the same name

-and a MAP.

A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.

JACK at the wheel.

It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.

Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.

9.

A button of light, expanding...

...as we burst into daylight.

We're in another world.

JACK'S CAR is winding its way up a twisting mountain road

towards...

...a ramshackle, lonely, desolate Italian HILLTOP TOWN.

The town sits beneath it's own castle. Medieval towers,

gables, streets and church bells: framed by the snow-capped

mountain peaks beyond.

This is not the Italy of E.M. Forster or of Bella Tuscany.

This is the Italy where the Crusaders built their fortresses.

The Italy where Sergio Leone conceived of his great Westerns.

A CHURCH BELL tolls...

JACK stops the car.

At the crossroads is a SIGNPOST pointing to the town.

The sign reads:

CASTELVECCHIO.

JACK looks at the sign.

He looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts.

An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at

JACK and disappears into another building.

JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath

the rotting patchwork of rooves.

A DOG barks. The WIND hisses. The atmosphere is deathly.

JACK makes a decision.

And drives away.

We see JACK'S CAR heading away from CASTELVECCHIO.

10.

The CAR crosses a spectacular VIADUCT that spans a deep

RAVINE.

The driver's window opens.

A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag is thrown out.

It drops hundreds of feet down the ravine.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

CASTEL DEL MONTE is a well preserved, happy looking little

mediaeval town with a handful of tourists.

A chunk of time has passed.

JACK is sitting on a table outside a small BAR wearing dark

glasses, sipping a coffee and reading a guide book. He looks

like a tastefully dressed, well educated American tourist. He

blends in. And no one pays him much attention as he finishes

his coffee, pays his bill, gets up and leaves.

We follow JACK as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts

and looks across the spectacular valley...

...towards the deserted CASTELVECCHIO.

At a leisurely pace, JACK passes a row of municipal rubbish

bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town.

Hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of JACK's parked

CAR.

We're right in the heart of the mediaeval old town: like the

stronghold at the centre of a castle.

JACK approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off

the main square.

The sign reads: "PENSIONE ABRUZZO".

The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool.

11.

In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble

shot through with black veins.

In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL. She's

wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water

falls. The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre

diameter pipe made of bronze.

As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE.

He finds it hard to tear his eyes away.

A toothbrush in the glass by the sink.

The guidebook on the bedside table.

Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely

out of his holdall for some time.

From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid

BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS.

Through his casement window he has good view of

CASTELVECCHIO.

He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical.

This is a routine assessment.

JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old

man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.

JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide

awake.

Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame...

...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun.

Blinding SUN fills frame.

JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval

architecture, the square, the church.

The CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black,

surveys the world below him:

12.

Locals are going about their business, a few scattered

tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches

the PRIEST's attention.

Perhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only

tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like

methodology with which JACK photographs the little town...

JACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow

alleyways.

The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind

corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches,

criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by

outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell-

depending on how dangerous the prey.

JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a

crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each

alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of

steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway.

From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game

show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of

a barking dog.

No dog is visible.

Curious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came.

The sound of barking gets louder.

On his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY.

The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big

enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the

`slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence

of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls.

The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap

between them very, very difficult to spot.

JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY.

Inside is a courtyard.

Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms.

A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash

keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK.

JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and

fury.

13.

JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into

the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin

air.

He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS:

-first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY

-and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA.

Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the

alleyway and drives towards him.

Casually, JACK continues walking.

The DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a

black crash helmet with a tinted visor.

JACK picks up his pace.

The DUCATI is ten metres away.

JACK's right hand moves towards his pocket.

Five metres.

JACK's hand goes in his pocket.

Two metres.

BANG!

JACK drops to his knees.

BANG!

The DUCATI backfires for a second time.

A pause.

Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace.

The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up

the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his

helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late

sixties.

He glances at JACK.

JACK stands.

MAN ON DUCATI

Buon giorno!

JACK

Buon giorno.

14.

MAN ON DUCATI

Da dove provenite?

For an instant, the directness of the question catches JACK

out.

JACK

America.

MAN ON DUCATI

Ah! L'Americano!

JACK

Si. Il Americano.

JACK's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty.

Perhaps he's playing up on this. It suits the role of

American tourist.

The MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct

grammar:

MAN ON DUCATI

L'Americano ! L'Americano!

A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry-

distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI, who screams back

passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him

with a hearty slam.

JACK walks on.

JACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE.

The MACHINE takes his money but won't dispense his

cigarettes.

He hits the refund button but nothing happens.

JACK checks the time.

And thumps the machine hard.

Footsteps.

JACK adjusts his position and checks the time again.

VOICE (O.S.)

Can I help you?

The man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACK's

battered ROLEX.

JACK

I'm no good with machines.

15.

FATHER BENEDETTO

You are American.

JACK

Si.

FATHER BENEDETTO

You speak Italian?

JACK

Poco.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Va bene! You stay at Pensione

Arbruzzo.

JACK

Not for much longer.

FATHER BENEDETTO

On vacation?

JACK

Working vacation.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro?

JACK

Photographer.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Va bene. Che genere de fotografia?

JACK

Pictures of the region.

Architecture, landscapes...

FATHER BENEDETTO

People?

16.

He stands straight and smiles winningly.

JACK

No people. Sights and landmarks.

For guidebooks, magazines...

FATHER BENEDETTO

Ah! Magazine! Which magazine?

JACK shows no discomfort.

JACK

Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of

different publications. Um... Casa

editrice.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Va bene. So you must share a glass

of wine with me. Questa sera. This

evening.

A beat.

JACK is slightly thrown.

JACK

You're very kind, but I...

FATHER BENEDETTO

Certo. You want to know the truth

about Abruzzo? A priest sees

everything.

JACK is using the local PAY PHONE.

LARRY (V.O.)

Do you have any idea how long I've

been trying to reach you? What

happened to the cell I gave you?

JACK speaks quietly, keeping an eye on the town square:

JACK

Did I forget to mention my

electromagnetic hypersensitivity?

LARRY (V.O.)

Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That

cell was secure.

JACK lights a cigarette.

17.

LARRY (V.O.)

I've got a job. It's a custom fit.

You don't even have to pull the

trigger.

JACK

Who's the client?

LARRY (V.O.)

Relax. She triple checks out. Plus

she comes to you. You don't have to

move an inch.

JACK

This is a small town, Larry. I

don't like small towns. I grew up

in one. Besides, I'm already

attracting attention.

LARRY (V.O.)

So will anyone who's trying to kill

you.

This is a good point.

JACK lights a cigarette.

JACK

I'll think about it.

LARRY (V.O.)

Think about this. I cleaned up your

shit and made you disappear. You

owe me my usual twenty percent

commission plus the first

installment. The rest is yours.

After this you're free.

On JACK.

Turning over the word.

The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook

the hilltop town.

JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt.

He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of

a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet

secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun.

FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a

globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like

a honey bee hovering over a bloom.

18.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Que siamo! The quality of the

brandy is good, the liquor is

smooth and the glass warmed by the

sun.

FATHER BENEDETTO

(in ENGLISH)

The only good thing to come from

the Francesi, everything else...

FATHER BENEDETTO

The French are... pezzi di merda.

This is not an American discovery.

Italians have known this for

centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome

called France the province of Gaul,

they were just the same. Arrogant

sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy

and their wine effeminate. Only

their brandy is worthy of any

attention.

FATHER BENEDETTO

(in ENGLISH)

Forgive me. I speak too fast. You

study our history?

JACK

No.

FATHER BENEDETTO

You come to Italy to make a guide

book and you don't care about

history?

JACK

I take pictures, father.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Of course. You are American. You

think you can escape history. You

live for the present.

19.

A beat.

JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but

humane.

JACK sips his brandy.

JACK

I try to, father.

Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the

capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to

Castel del Monte and Castelveccio.

Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated,

nestled high up in the Appenine mountains.

JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of

groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street.

JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small,

inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its

graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of

what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block.

Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year-

old Italian girl.

CLARA.

She catches JACK's eye.

He walks on.

The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple,

pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts.

On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of

PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories:

1. Street plan

2. Exit routes/car

3. Exit routes/foot

20.

Now he is cleaning and oiling his WALTHER PPK/S.

JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and

dresses. His manner is precise and methodical. Only a man who

has lived alone for many years can live like this.

When his preparations are complete, he picks up his

BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO

through his medieval casement window.

The dead town has come to life!

There's a MARKET in progress. The central piazza is a hive of

activity. Food, local produce, clothes and cheap CD stalls.

The market has attracted TOURISTS. Standing by a phone box

not far from a cheese stall is an attractive WOMAN in dark

glasses. She's rifling through her handbag, searching for

something. Under her right arm is a rolled up copy of Il

Messaggero.

We notice the front page of the Italian daily newspaper has

been folded in half.

JACK lowers his binoculars.

Thinks.

Decides to proceed with caution.

Moving through the busy market, JACK is also carrying a copy

of Il Messaggero...

...with the front page folded in half.

He approaches the OLD WOMAN running a cheese stall.

JACK

Un po' di formaggio, per favore.

OLD WOMAN

Quale? Pecorino, parmigiano?

JACK

Questo.

21.

He points.

JACK

E un po' di pecorino.

JACK glances casually around for the WOMAN.

She's sitting outside a CAFE about twenty metres away,

chatting on her cellphone.

JACK pays for his cheese and approaches the cafe.

JACK sits at an empty table next to the WOMAN.

She finishes her call in English. She's well spoken. As she

replaces the phone in her handbag, she knocks the newspaper

off her table.

JACK picks it up.

WOMAN

Grazie.

JACK

Prego. You're welcome.

WOMAN

You're American.

JACK

"Amidst gathering clouds".

The WOMAN speaks quickly, purposefully, barely looking at

JACK.

WOMAN

You're assuming I'm English or

you'd never have mentioned the

weather. In fact I'm Belgian but I

went to boarding school in England.

And am quite happy to converse on

all subjects meteorological.

Judging by her stilted choice of words this is code.

A WAITER comes out and flicks a cloth over the table. It's

nearly midday and the sun is hot. He speaks with a tired

voice:

WAITER

Buon giorno. Desidera?

He's addressing the WOMAN.

22.

WOMAN

Una spremute di limone. Per favore.

WAITER

Signore?

JACK

Una gelata alla fragola. Per

favore.

JACK

Edward.

WOMAN

Mathilde.

MATHILDE

It's hot. My car has no air

conditioning. I asked for it,

but...

JACK

What car did they give you?

JACK

Range?

MATHILDE

One fifty to one seven five meters.

23.

JACK

Time?

MATHILDE

Five seconds. Seven at the most.

JACK

Targets?

MATHILDE

One.

JACK

Fire rate?

MATHILDE

Rapid.

JACK

Magazine capacity?

MATHILDE

Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum.

MATHILDE

The weapon must be fairly light.

And compact. Possible to be broken

down into its constituent parts.

L'AMERICANO

How compact?

MATHILDE

As compact as possible.

JACK

You want a submachine gun to fit in

a lady's purse?

MATHILDE

A small vanity case would be

permissible.

JACK

A small briefcase would be

possible.

24.

JACK

X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD

player, MP3 or digital camera?

MATHILDE

Not necessary.

JACK

Noise?

MATHILDE

Silencer.

JACK

No such thing. You'll have to make

do with a suppressor like everyone

else. It'll dampen the decibels,

dislocate the sound source and

reduce muzzle flash. I can't make

you silent but I can make you

invisible as the Finnish phrase

goes, but only as long as you're

prepared to lose some range.

JACK

Two o'clock.

MATHILDE

Excuse me?

JACK

By the clothes stall. Light blue

shirt, open at the neck, expensive

buff suede shoes. Is he with you?

MATHILDE

I didn't see him. In any case, I'm

alone.

MATHILDE

I can accept a slight loss of

range.

25.

JACK

You want a weapon with the firing

capacity of a submachine gun and

the range of a rifle.

MATHILDE

Can you do it?

A beat.

JACK

Give me a month. To trial. Then a

week for final adjustments.

The sun is sinking.

It's hunting hour.

A FALCON hovers on the wind above the town, looking for prey.

JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast

asleep.

His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids.

He's dreaming.

In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &

ARCHITECTURE.

Twitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART & ARCHITECTURE

BOOK slowly loosens...

THUD!

As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and

rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at

the door.

Silence.

JACK's heart is beating.

JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS.

JACK'S POV:

...of a small yellow and blue Italian POST OFFICE VAN heading

up the winding alpine road towards CASTELVECCIO.

26.

With the market gone, the town is once more dead.

And provides no cover.

JACK parks his car not far from the town square, turns off

the engine and gets out.

JACK is sitting in the CAFE where he met Mathilde.

He is watching the entrance to the local POST OFFICE.

He studies his WATCH.

It's been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny

rural branch of the Poste Italiane.

JACK puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets

up...

The shop is small and dusty.

So is the POSTMASTER.

JACK

Buon giorno.

The POSTMASTER grunts his reply, jutting his chin.

JACK

Il fermo posta?

The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack

of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking

aid. From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general

delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. Some

have been there for weeks. Months even.

POSTMASTER

Nome?

A beat.

JACK

Clarke.

Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of

banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted

fingers.

27.

POSTMASTER

Clarky?

JACK

Clarke. Una pacchetto.

POSTMASTER

Pacchetto!

This makes all the difference. The POSTMASTER clicks again,

disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...

POSTMASTER

Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.

...and reappearing with a PACKAGE.

The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS.

JACK

Grazie.

POSTMASTER

Identificazione.

JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his

PASSPORT on the counter.

The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers.

Looks from the picture to JACK.

JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.

JACK unwraps the PACKAGE.

He removes:

-film

-photographic paper

-development fluids

-fixing solutions

Then:

-a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a

single piece of lightweight alloy.

-a bolt assembly.

-a barrel.

28.

Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete.

Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN.

Without touching it, JACK studies the weapon like a

connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine. In particular he

notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off.

Then he moves slowly, assembling the weapon with precision

engineered expertise:

-inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and

securing it with the nut,

-opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the

buttpad,

-snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder,

-looking down the barrel,

-and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we

SMASH CUT TO:

Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters.

CLARA.

She sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs

squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray

on the bedside table.

She kicks off her slip-on shoes.

Slips off her panties.

Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on

the bed in one practised motion.

JACK sits on the bed beside her.

He doesn't look at her.

ITALIAN GIRL

Amore?

She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to:

JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness.

29.

JACK

Your source in Rome.

LARRY (V.O.)

Clean bill of health and no OC.

This was a straight favour with a

dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got

a second cousin in NOCS on the

graft who filched him the Socimi.

JACK

I hope you paid below the odds. The

more you pay them the more cops

gossip in the locker room.

LARRY (V.O.)

No one's gossiping, Jack.

JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other

side of the square.

JACK

Yet.

FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler.

This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is

a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck.

In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES.

The API is turning over but it won't start.

The bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine.

He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key

again.

This time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and

cheers.

Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with

polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique

sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the

life of Our Lord.

The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black

edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like

the columns of cathedrals.

30.

Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like

old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO

performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat,

dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables.

He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash.

JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO

potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own

wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.

JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in

silence.

FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so

absorbed.

As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to

help himself from the ancient tureen.

Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again.

JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with

his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid-

twenties. FABIO.

FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered

dish issuing steam into his face.

He notices JACK's eye-line.

FATHER BENEDETTO

All the sheep in my flock are dear

to me, but some are dearer than

most. Especially those that have

strayed from the fold.

Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:

FATHER BENEDETTO

Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car

doctor'. But I suspect his practice

is not entirely sound. Ecco!

FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish

revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of

orange juice, orange peel,

chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine

and... Come si dici in Inglese?

Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.

31.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Also: salsify in garlic butter.

Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms

with truffle.

JACK

Sinful.

FATHER BENEDETTO

The Holy Father eats better than

this.

JACK

Have you ever wanted to be anything

other than a priest?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Have you ever wanted to be anything

other than a... come se dice in

Inglese...?

JACK

Photographer?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Photographer.

JACK

I do what I'm good at.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I'm sure you have other talents.

You have the hands of a craftsman,

not an artist. You are good with

machines. Yet you told me just the

opposite when we first met.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Journalism cannot make you a rich

man.

32.

FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.

JACK

No.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Perhaps you are rich already?

JACK

I'm not a young man. I have my

savings.

FATHER BENEDETTO

(in ITALIAN)

My meagre income is subject to the

vagaries of the stock market and

with church attendance declining

there's less and less money in the

offertory. But if a man has God in

his vaults...

He looks searchingly at JACK.

JACK

I don't think God is interested in

me. Father.

FATHER BENEDETTO

(in ENGLISH)

I know better than to try to make a

convert over pheasant and

Trebbiano.

JACK is silent.

The two men continue eating.

Then casually:

JACK

What are the snakes for, father?

FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal

sign for secrecy.

FATHER BENEDETTO

"The grave soul keeps its own

secrets, and takes its own

punishment in silence."

He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to

extract the truth... and JACK knows it.

JACK is driving.

33.

He checks the rear view mirror.

All clear.

JACK accelerates the CAR, driving it hard at the sidewalk.

The vehicle slams into the curb, mounting the pavement with a

thump of crunching metal.

Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders

downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and

scrap metal yards.

The CAR moves slowly. We can hear the scrape of trailing

metal.

JACK pulls up beside a high chain fence.

The DOGS on the other side start barking. This sets off other

dogs in other scrap yards.

JACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut

beside the fence. Before he's a metre from the door it opens

and a tough, well-built, unshaven Italian man in his mid-

twenties looks him up and down.

FABIO.

JACK

Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.

Suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth:

FABIO

L'Americano?

JACK smiles politely.

JACK

Buon giorno.

The metal door slides open. FABIO leads JACK inside.

At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO

being resprayed white. Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is

being welded to another.

JACK knows better than to stare. He follows FABIO through

to...

34.

Girly calendars, Italian style.

JACK

I'm taking pictures forty minutes

north of here. Right up in the

mountains. Father Benedetto said

you might be able to help.

FABIO

(in ITALIAN)

You need models. For your

photographs? Italian girls?

He winks at JACK. He's being friendly.

JACK

My publisher wouldn't stretch to a

four by four and the park trails

are playing havoc with my chassis.

The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp.

This suits JACK.

FABIO

(in ITALIAN)

Want me to take a look?

JACK

Not really. I just need something

to work on a ruptured driveshaft.

FABIO

(in ITALIAN)

You're a mechanic?

JACK

Just a hobby. I tinker.

JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering

the work benches.

FABIO shrugs.

FABIO

(in ITALIAN)

Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My

garage is your garage.

JACK

I appreciate that.

FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the

resprayed Alfa Romeo.

35.

JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work

surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet.

Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers

several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the

biggest one up.

JACK

Bene?

FABIO is engrossed his work.

FABIO

Si! Si! Va bene!

JACK

Quant'e?

FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless

to him.

FABIO

Niente!

JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and

puts it in the sports bag with the tools.

At the door, he pauses.

That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of

FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this

photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma

football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy.

JACK

Ciao. Grazie.

FABIO

Ciao, Americano!

FATHER BENEDETTO rings the CHURCH BELLS for Mass.

THREE CHURCH BELLS ringing: large, medium and small.

As the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to:

JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone

floor of his room.

36.

Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN.

Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover...

...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes

it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET.

By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed

steel gear.

It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor

light.

JACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making

his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark,

purposeful, alert.

The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops.

Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers.

His guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen

anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks

around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash

whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The

air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies.

JACK is transfixed.

JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in

the heat.

His original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks

the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of

the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars,

monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human

activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath

of mountain air.

And scrambles back down to the valley.

JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample

WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE.

JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a

patch of soft grass beside the water.

37.

38.

The reeds are clipped, the bullets slapping into the bank

behind, mud spurting.

JACK adjusts again and reloads.

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

The reed clump is shot to shit.

The sound of CHURCH BELLS.

JACK is at work:

-modifying the SOUND SUPPRESSOR to make it more efficient

-filing the CONNECTORS until the trigger squeeze is softer

-adjusting the position of the TELESCOPIC SIGHT mountings

And finally:

-checking the balance of the weapon: JACK poises it on the

edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be

the gun's centre of gravity.

The SOCIMI balances perfectly.

By now the sun is low and the light fading. JACK's eyes are

sore and his fingers aching.

He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees, silent in the

dying light.

We're in the living room of a small apartment. It's simply

and attractively furnished. There are 2 GIRLS: not obviously

hookers.

The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone. Every now and again

she glances at JACK. The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a

light.

JACK

E Clara qui?

[Is Clara here?]

SECOND GIRL

Non e stasera qui.

[She's not here tonight.]

She loops her arm through JACK's.

39.

SECOND GIRL

Volete una bevanda?

[Would you like a drink?]

JACK shakes his head.

JACK

Forse un altro tempo.

[Perhaps another time.]

JACK parks in his usual hiding spot and heads for his

pensione.

A hundred yards ahead of him on the other side of the street

is the same YOUNG MAN he spotted in Castelveccio.

Cautiously, so as not to spook him, JACK continues walking,

passing his pensione and heading for the town square.

The YOUNG MAN is four parked cars away, leaning against a

Fiat parked in front of a small pharmacy, his right hand on

the roof, bending over as if speaking to the car's local

occupant who appears to be giving him directions.

Twice he looks up and gazes along the street in both

directions, casually, as if keeping an eye open for passing

traffic in the narrow street.

...JACK side steps swiftly into the local bar.

Crowded with locals. JACK orders a coffee.

Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on

the YOUNG MAN. But the darkness outside throws back

reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within.

One reflection catches our attention.

The Italian girl. CLARA.

She is drinking and laughing with friends, young Italians

like her. She catches sight of JACK.

He turns away.

JACK comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket.

No sign of the YOUNG MAN.

40.

He slips down a side street.

JACK slips from one side street to another taking full

advantage of short-cuts, alleyways and crumbling walls. His

route is circuitous. It betrays a perfect knowledge of the

maze-like back streets of the town.

Eventually JACK peeps out of a tiny passageway half-way down

his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his

PENSIONE.

The entrance to the PENSIONE is clear.

JACK crosses the street and slips inside.

We're in the corridor outside JACK'S ROOM.

JACK takes his right hand from his pocket.

He's clutching the WALTHER.

Slowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel

above the door where he finds...

...a single FEATHER.

From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned

deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made.

JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits

on the bed.

A cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a

restaurant, a phone box.

JACK puts a coin in the slot. Two rings.

LARRY (V.O.)

Jack?

JACK

I've got company.

JACK scans the area outside.

41.

JACK

If he's not baby-sitting the

Belgian contract then he's either a

Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not

with The Company, they're fast:

it's been three days and no TA.

He's not intel: they're deep

background and he wants to be

noticed. He might be a cowboy but

he can't be a cop: they work in

pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda

di Finanza, State Police and NOCS:

he's not Italian- he doesn't look

like one, dress like one or behave

like one. So who the hell is he?

JACK

Larry?

LARRY (V.O.)

You got a long list of enemies,

Jack.

JACK

What's he waiting for?

LARRY (V.O.)

Jack?

LARRY (V.O.)

Want me to help take care of this?

JACK

I can handle it.

LARRY (V.O.)

You sound spooked.

JACK

It's a bad line.

LARRY (V.O.)

Jack?

JACK

Yes?

42.

LARRY (V.O.)

I appreciate the value of a pre-

emptive strike in circumstances

like these, I really do, but if

you're going to go Generation Kill

then do me a favour, OK, because

I'm running out of bribe money. [A

BEAT] Make it look like an

accident.

Little more than a halt: one platform, one track, one station

building- locked and shuttered.

JACK steps out of his car.

No one around.

He checks his watch: it's exactly noon.

A TRAIN approaches.

It's a three-carriage local. It rattles round the bend in the

track up the valley, diesel fumes pluming. There are no more

than a dozen passengers on board.

MATHILDE is the only one to alight.

Her once brown hair is now BLONDE. She's wearing a light

summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag.

They shake hands as the train pulls away, belching and

honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and

crosses some alpine rapids.

MATHILDE

Mr. Clarke. How good to see you

again.

Something quaint, old fashioned in her diction. English with

the hint of a Belgian accent.

JACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag

beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER.

MATHILDE

Refreshments?

JACK

The Carabinieri around here like

roadblocks. It's cover.

She nods.

They get into the car.

43.

As the JACK's door slams we smash cut to:

MATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape.

MATHILDE

You picked a beautiful spot.

She takes off her shades.

Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE.

She glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior.

MATHILDE

You would be hard pressed to make a

fast get away in this.

Perhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working

and she stumbles slightly on her grammar:

MATHILDE

I would have thought you to have

had at least an Alfa Romeo.

JACK

This attracts less attention.

MATHILDE

Is it far?

JACK

Fifty minutes.

She looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over

head.

MATHILDE

Up there?

JACK nods.

She eases herself back, resigned to a long climb.

MATHILDE

The train was tiring. One has to

keep alert so much in cities.

Her eyelids are drooping.

JACK

I'll wake you before the turn-off.

She smiles gratefully. But does not shut her tired eyes.

The CLOCK on the dash reads 12:17

44.

JACK negotiates the alpine road, leaning into the steering

wheel, shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the

mirror to the road and back again

MATHILDE is asleep.

JACK scans her, taking in every detail: her low-heeled shoes

are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a Seiko wrist-

watch on a metal strap and a thin gold chain at her throat.

Her tan is light, her breasts neat and her legs shapely and

recently waxed.

But JACK doesn't look at her like an object of desire. He

looks at her cautiously, with an expression that says: "this

young woman is ruthless. If she were not, she wouldn't be

alive."

That's when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror.

It's too far behind to decipher the make or model and it

weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine

road.

MATHILDE wakes with a start. The CLOCK on the dash reads

13:05.

MATHILDE

Are we nearly there?

JACK

The turn-off's up ahead.

His eyes flick to the rear view mirror. Hers to the wing.

She spots the CAR behind. JACK catches her eye questioningly.

MATHILDE

I told you I work alone.

JACK slows just before the turn off and pulls over.

Then stops.

Now its MATHILDE's turn to look questioning.

JACK

Just a precaution.

He gets out of the car and pretends to urinate.

The CAR behind passes at speed.

A blue Seat. The driver neither slows down nor looks in their

direction.

JACK gets back in the car.

45.

And turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the

meadows.

JACK parks his CITROEN in the shade of the squat but ample

WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a large LAKE. This is

the exact spot where he came to test the weapon.

MATHILDE gets out of the car and stretches.

MATHILDE

Are those houses occupied?

JACK looks at the RUINED HAMLET on the hillside.

JACK

Derelict. I checked three days ago.

MATHILDE

We should check again.

JACK

I'll check alone. There are adders

the mountains. And vipers. Your

shoes.

MATHILDE

I'll be careful.

Her voice is curt. The trust she showed him in the car is

gone now.

They cross a meadow and make their way towards the RUINED

HAMLET. The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade.

JACK walks in front to ward off any snakes.

Everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers.

MATHILDE has never seen anything so beautiful. Overwhelmed,

she stops.

JACK stops. And watches her.

She undergoes the same transformation that he did.

Then she comes to, remembering herself... and walks on.

Suddenly... a four foot ASP VIPER slithers across JACK's

path.

He claps his hands and the SNAKE writhes for cover.

46.

JACK walks on. MATHILDE follows, pretending not to be

frightened but walking closer to JACK now, scanning the long

grass warily.

JACK scrambles up towards the houses, checking the area for

signs of recent disturbance. MATHILDE follows.

From beside the end building JACK surveys the valley with a

tiny pair of binoculars, monitoring every square on the

imaginary grid for human activity.

MATHILDE

You have tested the gun here

before?

JACK

Yes.

Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE

takes a deep breath of mountain air.

MATHILDE

It's beautiful here.

She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was

once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she

leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from

the journey and the long, hot climb.

MATHILDE

I wish everywhere could be this

tranquil.

JACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit.

JACK

You'd be out of a job.

MATHILDE

You don't like the peace?

JACK

It's hard to like something you

know nothing about.

The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the

parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes:

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a

chilled bottle of Aspirinio

-a loaf of course bread

47.

MATHILDE

Rounds?

JACK

I've made up two sorts.

JACK

Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.

MATHILDE

I should like a hundred of each.

MATHILDE

And fifty explosive.

JACK

Not a problem.

JACK

Will mercury do?

48.

MATHILDE

Mercury will do very nicely.

MATHILDE

I have made my own targets.

JACK

Watch out for vipers.

MATHILDE

Muzzle velocity?

JACK

At least three hundred and sixty

miles per hour. That's including

twenty off the top for the sound

suppression.

MATHILDE

Socimi?

JACK

Eight-two-one.

MATHILDE

I've not had one before.

49.

JACK

You'll find it easy. I've re-

balanced it for the longer barrel.

The fulcrum is two centimetres

forward of the grip now. Which

won't matter if you're firing- and

I'm guessing you are- from a fixed

position.

JACK

No major recoil issues. You should

be able to hold onto any target.

Even the smallest.

MATHILDE

You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

JACK

Good shot.

50.

MATHILDE

Go to the stones and fire near me.

MATHILDE

Say...

MATHILDE

...into the bush with the yellow

flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds

apart.

MATHILDE

The sound suppression is superb. I

couldn't place the direction of

fire.

51.

MATHILDE

I shall require the rounds and the

weapon by the first of next month.

In the meantime would you tighten

the adjusting screws on the sight,

they are too loose. And lengthen

the stock by three centimetres. I

also want a sixty round magazine.

JACK

You'll upset the balance.

MATHILDE

I'm prepared to accept that.

JACK

Then I'm happy to oblige.

MATHILDE

What about the a case?

JACK

A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard

pattern in black with combination

locks. Is there a number you'd

prefer?

MATHILDE

Eight-two-one.

JACK

Eight-two-one.

MATHILDE

What do you want done with these?

JACK

Throw them in the lake.

52.

MATHILDE

How thoughtful.

MATHILDE

I don't know Italian wine.

JACK

Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but

frizzante.

JACK

It wouldn't look right if the

picnic wasn't touched.

MATHILDE

You chilled the wine. I thought...

JACK

It had to be chilled. They're

Italian cops.

MATHILDE

(disappointed)

You think of everything.

JACK

I'm paid to. Don't move.

MATHILDE

Wow.

MATHILDE

It's so beautiful.

JACK

Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.

MATHILDE

You like coming here.

JACK

It serves its purpose.

53.

MATHILDE

You've never taken a woman here

before?

JACK is momentarily taken aback.

JACK

No.

The BUTTERFLY flits away.

MATHILDE

(sadly)

Perhaps you do not have a woman in

your life. It is not easy for us to

keep relationships. Not in our

world.

JACK

I have an acquaintance.

A beat.

She waits for him to say more.

He doesn't.

MATHILDE

Friendships are transitory. It

is...

Suddenly, there's movement in the bushes.

JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS. MATHILDE scans the tree

cover.

JACK

Wild boar.

He hands her the binoculars. And hurriedly packs up the

picnic.

Her sunglasses back on, MATHILDE watches the meadows slip

backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back

down the alpine track.

MATHILDE

I wish you hadn't brought me here.

Again... a real sadness.

JACK glances at her.

54.

MATHILDE

This is the sort of place I wish

I'd discovered by myself. Then

maybe one day I could have retired

here. But you already know it.

JACK is touched.

JACK

I'm much older than you. By the

time you've retired I'll be dead.

The CITROEN pulls up.

The YOUNG WOMAN's manner is once more tense and formal.

MATHILDE

We will meet as before?

JACK nods.

The distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE. The train is

approaching.

MATHILDE

On the first of next month?

He nods again.

MATHILDE

Around noon?

Not even a nod this time: just a slow blink.

MATHILDE opens the door, runs around to the boot and grabs

her canvas sports bag. Then returns to the passenger side of

the car and looks in.

MATHILDE

Thank you for a lovely day. Mr.

Butterfly.

She leans in..

...and kisses him lightly on the cheek, her lips light and

quick on his stubble.

MATHILDE

You must take your mistress to the

meadow for a picnic.

55.

She closes the car door, walks onto the platform and vanishes

onto a waiting carriage. The TRAIN honks and belches, moving

off down the track in the direction from which it came.

JACK watches it go.

And drives off.

Confused.

Two OLD MEN drinking beer at the bar. Two more at a table,

playing Scopa with old fashioned Trentine playing cards.

Sitting at the back of the room, JACK stares at a shot of

Grappa.

Above him, mounted on the wall, is a TELEVISION. On the TV is

a Western: Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in ONCE UPON A

TIME IN THE WEST.

JACK downs his shot, gets up and walks over to the bar. Pays.

The BARMAN nods at the screen.

BARMAN

Sergio Leone. Italiano.

JACK turns and looks.

HENRY FONDA in close-up, is about to shoot a red headed BOY

of seven in the head.

JACK stares. Just at the moment that the gun goes off...

...JACK turns away.

BARMAN

(in poor ENGLISH)

You like cow boy movie?

JACK thinks.

Then shakes his head.

JACK

Hokey.

CLARA and JACK are naked.

JACK tries to kiss her on the lips but CLARA turns away: just

enough to let him know this is against the rules.

56.

JACK kisses her neck. Her breasts. Her stomach.

As he moves his head between her legs, her fingers (already

ensnared in his hair) tighten their grip, stopping him from

going further.

JACK looks up at CLARA, across her belly, and she looks back

at him, her expression fixed yet curious.

Against her rules but not, we sense, against her wishes, JACK

kisses CLARA softly, tenderly, deeply until she is moving

against his tongue, using her sex like a mouth to kiss him in

return.

They make love, breaking each of Clara's two remaining rules

in turn. First: JACK puts her in a position she initially

resists. Then: he kisses her.

CLARA comes, not wanting to.

Suddenly, preoccupied, JACK does not.

JACK is in bed with CLARA.

CLARA

Morboso?

She looks at him.

CLARA

(with certainty)

Morboso.

JACK

Morboso?

CLARA

Morboso is like... when you can't

stop thinking about something.

He stares back at her: wordless.

CLARA

Or someone.

A long pause: her eyes searching his. JACK sits up, lights a

cigarette and stands by the window, looking through the

blind, down into the street.

JACK

You needn't act.

CLARA

Act?

57.

CLARA watches him, confused but fascinated.

JACK

You might have to act with your

other clients but you don't have to

pretend anything at all with me.

She lights herself a cigarette.

JACK

I want you to be yourself with me.

Be as indifferent as you like. I

came here to get pleasure, not to

give it.

He hands her CASH.

She counts it.

CLARA

Maybe I pretend very well. I got

more tip than the other girls

usually get.

He walks to the door.

Pauses.

JACK

I don't sleep with the other girls.

And leaves.

JACK is asleep.

He is not alone.

In the bed beside him:

INGRID.

Pale as death.

Eyes rolled back in her sockets.

***

JACK wakes up suddenly, gasping.

The bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp.

58.

SUNRISE...

...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in

all Italy.

In the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work:

-cartridges taken apart

-tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm

-the hole half-filled with mercury

-and plugged with a drop of liquid lead.

JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE

BULLETS.

Outside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge

in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying.

Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the

thorns and the nails and the running blood.

Footsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch.

It's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I've been looking for you.

He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane,

takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from

the light of the candles.

FATHER BENEDETTO

A man was here asking questions

about you.

A beat.

JACK

Here?

FATHER BENEDETTO

He came to the church this

afternoon.

JACK

What did he want?

59.

FATHER BENEDETTO

To know where you live. He said he

was a friend from Switzerland.

JACK

Switzerland?

JACK

And you told him?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Of course I do not tell him. How do

I know him? He is maybe the police.

Certainly he is no friend. A friend

would know your pensione.

Besides...

FATHER BENEDETTO

Friends do not carry guns.

FATHER BENEDETTO

If you live in Italy, and you are a

man of the cloth, you meet many

people. Besides, I lived once in

Naples. If you live in Naples you

know the difference between a fat

wallet and a... custodia per armi

di spalla. How you say in English?

JACK

Shoulder holster.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Si.

JACK

You're a true friend, father.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I am a priest.

60.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Signor Clarke?

Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a

gesture of austere confidence.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I make a mistake. He did not say he

was from La Svizzera: Switzerland.

He said- forgive me the names in

Italian are so similar- La Svezia:

Sweden.

THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of

mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look

down over the little town, their faces frightening or

frightened.

JACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes

made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town

below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the

YOUNG MAN.

Nothing. Then he notices:

Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far

from the main square. An AUDI...

...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market

sitting at the wheel.

The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop.

This is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early

thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and

expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and

there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just

beneath the collar of his shirt.

The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft

movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco)

and inserts the it between his top lip and gum.

It is a strangely sinister act.

Then he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso

and round the square heading towards...

61.

JACK is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as

possible to the world outside.

He downs a Grappa: then gets up to pay for it. His movements

are slow and leisurely.

The BARMAN hands him his change. And a small white ENVELOPE.

JACK is not expecting this.

BARMAN

(in ITALIAN)

Someone left this for

"L'Americano". This afternoon.

JACK looks at the ENVELOPE.

JACK

Grazie.

He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and

opens the envelope with extreme caution.

Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily

newspaper OSTERSUNDS-POSTEN.

JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of:

-Ingrid's dacha.

-A police line.

-Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl.

Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket.

Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar.

And leaves.

The YOUNG MAN is watching a PUPPET SHOW in the middle of the

square. The PUPPETEER is using glove puppets and the Punch

and Judy style performance involves Punch fucking Judy with a

grotesquely carved, outsize sex organ. There is a large crowd

gathered.

JACK leaves the bar, turning left and walking purposefully

down the street.

The YOUNG MAN follows.

62.

It's a hot summer night and there are more tourists than

usual.

The YOUNG MAN uses them as cover.

JACK turns down a dark, deserted alleyway.

The YOUNG MAN hesitates.

His right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket.

And he follows.

We're with the YOUNG MAN as he stalks his prey through the

mediaeval maze of streets...

We end up in the narrow alleyway that JACK photographed on

his first day in town.

Up ahead, disappearing round a distant bend, we catch a

glimpse of JACK, his heels CLACKING on the cobbles.

The YOUNG MAN follows swiftly, his trainers silent. He gets

to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS- all identical-

converge. The YOUNG MAN is unsure which alleyway to take.

The streets are empty.

He listens.

From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late

night film on television. It's a romantic film, the violins

muffled and sad with longing.

From another alleyway comes the sound of SAVAGE BARKING. The

YOUNG MAN looks around for the source of the barking, but the

streets are empty.

Suddenly, the barking stops.

The YOUNG MAN looks confused.

From his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable

CLICK of a cocking mechanism.

We're recognise the secret courtyard: the one reached by

means of the hidden archway.

With one hand, JACK feeds another SUGAR CUBE to the MONGREL.

63.

With the other hand, he holds his WALTHER behind his back...

...and cocks it.

The YOUNG MAN is waiting at the far end of the alleyway,

hugging the wall, scanning the CROSSROADS ahead, unsure which

of the four possible alleyways holds his prey.

JACK emerges from the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and walks quickly up

behind him.

JACK has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent.

He has thirty metres to cover. The gun hangs heavy in his

right hand. It's fitted with a TAC 65 SOUND SUPPRESSOR. He

raises his right hand.

Twenty metres.

The gun is pointing at the YOUNG MAN.

Fifteen metres.

His finger takes up the slack of the trigger.

Ten meters.

Then:

A DUCATI turns into the alleyway behind JACK, its headlights

on full beam.

JACK drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced WALTHER

deep into his jacket pocket.

The YOUNG MAN looks his way.

JACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light.

The two men are face to face, within spitting distance.

The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN.

The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET.

The YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear.

BANG!

The DUCATI misfires.

Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls

and fires back.

We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP!

64.

The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and

lodges in the REAR COWLING.

The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone

staircase.

JACK looks around.

The YOUNG MAN has disappeared.

The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold.

The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking.

CHOOP!

A bullet hits the road not far from JACK.

CHOOP!

Another bullet hits the wall behind him.

Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI...

JACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without

hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by

level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until...

JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on

the winding road.

Silence. All we can hear are the crickets.

Then the sound of a car.

An AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town.

JACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner

at 70 MPH.

The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him.

JACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970

1000cc engine howling.

The AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating.

65.

The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down.

The SPEEDOMETER climbs.

The AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jack's DUCATI and tries to

ram him.

JACK dodges the AUDI, swerving from one side of the road to

another.

A soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley.

The AUDI overtakes the DUCATI, then swerves left, trying to

crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three

hundred and fifty foot fall.

JACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him, smashing into the

concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching

metal.

The AUDI follows the DUCATI into...

Long, dark, neon-lit... and blind curved.

The AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI.

Jack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road.

The AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left-

hand wall of the tunnel.

Suddenly, a CAR comes round the bend.

What happens next happens fast:

JACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY, narrowly

avoiding the CAR.

The lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on it's

side as he crashes it into the box-like space.

The lay-by is too small for the AUDI.

The AUDI and oncoming CAR collide.

The AUDI's crumple zones buckle as both vehicles' bonnets

concertina like a road safety test.

66.

The AUDI has air bags. The oncoming CAR does not.

On impact, its DRIVER goes through the windscreen of his own

car and onwards, through the windscreen of the AUDI.

The wreckage is awesome.

Deep within the mangled metal of the two cars...

...the YOUNG MAN groans and twitches.

JACK appears at the crumpled window of the AUDI.

He reaches through the broken window, grabs the YOUNG MAN by

the head...

...and breaks his neck.

JACK washes away the worst of the dirt and the blood in a

MOUNTAIN STREAM.

JACK on the DUCATI.

Turns off at a sign for L'AQUILA.

L'AQUILA is the nearest and largest town in the region. It's

also the location of the Via Lampedusa brothel.

JACK comes out of a pharmacy and quite literally bumps into

CLARA.

He winces with pain.

CLARA

Buon giorno!

JACK

Buon giorno.

CLARA

You are hurt?

JACK

I'm fine.

CLARA

What's wrong with you?

67.

JACK

It's nothing really. Just a broken

rib. Un costollo rotta?

CLARA

Stronzo! Let me help you!

JACK

I came off my bike.

CLARA

But you have to go to the hospital!

JACK

No, no, no. I have pain killers. I

just need a strong cup of coffee.

CLARA

I know a place which make the

strongest coffee in L'Aquila.

Her limpid brown eyes twinkle.

A small, simply furnished bedroom with a bed, a desk and a

chair.

As he sips a large cup of strong black coffee, CLARA cleans a

vicious welt on his right shoulder blade.

As the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite

tattoo...

...of a BUTTERFLY.

CLARA

Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor

Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK.

Mr. Butterfly.]

His eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly.

JACK

Why d'you call me that?

A beat.

CLARA

You have a tattoo. On your back.

Of course.

He relaxes.

But not completely.

68.

The situation at the beginning of the movie is perfectly

reversed.

From the relative safety of CASTELVECCHIO, JACK watches

CASTEL DEL MONTE through binoculars:

-The Phone Box.

-The Bar.

-The pensione D'Abruzzo.

No sign of the police. No sign of any Shadow Dwellers.

JACK is in his usual phone box. His manner is quietly

purposeful.

JACK

How did he know I was here, Larry?

LARRY (V.O.)

You think I hired him?

A beat.

LARRY (V.O.)

Are you out of your fucking mind,

Jack?

JACK

I doubt it.

LARRY (V.O.)

After everything I've done for you?

The car, the cell phone (which you

threw away), the safehouse, the

fake passport? Someone has to pay

for this shit, Jack! I have to pay

for this shit. It comes out of my

commission. You're my lousy profit

margin. Why the fuck would I take a

contract out on my own profit

margin? You're not thinking

straight. I was the one who told

you to leave town! I told you to

come to Rome! God damn it you've

got a job to do! Why the Hell would

I...

WHAM!

Something smacks into the phone box at high speed.

69.

JACK drops to his knees and reaches for his WALTHER.

Outside the phone box three TEENAGERS are kicking a FOOTBALL

around.

TINS of fruit drops: three kinds: black cherry, pineapple and

lemon. Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops.

Twenty rounds of ammunition- each round packed in silica- fit

exactly into each tin.

Lead rounds in the black cherry, jacketed in the pineapple

and explosive in the lemon.

JACK re-seals each tin with sellotape.

The colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded

with window shoppers, tourists taking coffee, old men

discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and

chattering like songbirds.

JACK is in dark glasses. He's sitting in a coffee shop under

the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il

Messagiero.

C.U. we see he's studying a small column concerning the

murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti.

JACK spots CLARA walking along the corso. She's with a girl

he has not seen before. ANNA. ANNA is small town girl with a

keen sense of fashion. She and CLARA are hand in hand.

CLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend.

They cross through the throng of boulevardiers.

CLARA

My friend Anna. This is my friend

Signor Farfalla.

CLARA's eyes twinkle mischievously.

The girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JACK.

JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his

newspaper and accepting ANNA's greeting.

JACK

How do you do?

ANNA

I am very well thank you.

70.

JACK

Will you take a coffee with me?

CLARA

That would be very good.

JACK

Prego.

CLARA

Anna is learning English.

JACK

Have you been to England?

ANNA

But you are...

ANNA

Lui Americano?

JACK

I am.

ANNA

Ah. I have not been to England only

to France. But I would love to go

to America.

JACK

Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.

CLARA

Anna is like all Italians. She

thinks America is like in the

movies. Little Italy, "West Side

Story", "Chicago".

(MORE)

71.

CLARA (cont'd)

I tell her in these times America

is like here, there, anywhere. The

streets are not... pave-ed with

gold.

She beams happily at JACK. He smiles back at her.

JACK

If not with gold, than at least not

with enough medieval cobbles to

loosen every-self tapping screw in

a Fiat.

JACK beams. Neither girl understands. But everyone smiles

happily.

The WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying.

JACK

Where do you come from, Anna?

ANNA frowns. JACK plays teacher.

JACK

Dove abita?

ANNA

Ah, yes! I live in Via dell'

Argilla. Nearby to Clara.

JACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her. He scans

both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier. CLARA seems to

sense this. She smiles to herself.

JACK is touched.

We cut wide and watch JACK talk inconsequentialities with the

girls. They stand to go. JACK rises.

CLARA

Perhaps we will have a drink

together soon? I am free...

Her words sound rehearsed. She considers a crowded timetable.

CLARA

...on Monday.

JACK

Great. I'll see you then.

CLARA

But Eduardo... Where would you like

to meet?

72.

JACK

How about our usual place?

CLARA

Our usual place?

CLARA

I forgot. Where is our usual place?

JACK

You've forgotten?

CLARA

Remind me.

JACK

Maybe we should try something

different.

CLARA

Where would you like to try,

Eduardo?

JACK

Locanda Grapelli?

CLARA

Locanda Grapelli! Si!

ANNA

This is the best food in the area.

JACK

Good.

CLARA

Seven?

JACK

Seven.

CLARA

Locanda Grapelli.

73.

JACK

Locanda Grapelli.

CLARA

You'll be there?

JACK

I'll be there.

CLARA

See you then, Eduardo.

JACK

See you then, Clara. It was a

delight to meet you Anna.

Arrivederci.

ANNA

Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.

There is an unmistakable twinkle in ANNA's eye. How much she

knows is uncertain. She kisses him swiftly and softly on the

cheek.

CLARA does the same on the lips. Behind the mischief in her

eyes is something doubtful. Has she gone too far?

JACK visits three stores:

-In a PHOTOGRAPHIC SHOP he buys half a dozen FILM PROTECTION

BAGS.

-In a HABERDASHERS he purchases several packets of HOOKS and

EYES like the kind you find on brassieres.

-In a OFFICE SUPPLY SHOP he buys some custom made headed

notepaper, invoice books, notepads, envelopes, metal pens, a

calculator and a mobile phone.

JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and

lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film

protection bags, cut to fit.

Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of

firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he

slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

They fit perfectly.

Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false

bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom

made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes.

74.

To the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a

calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to

821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE.

This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his

work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.

A small park not far from Castel Del Monte's town square.

It is just after dawn. The pine trees and the poplars are

silent. The sun is not yet up but the day is light. Sparrows

hop about, searching for crumbs.

JACK, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon

of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the

underworld.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Buon giorno!

He's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome,

half-benediction.

They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow

step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind his

back. JACK with his hands in his pockets.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I walk here to meditate. Once a

week, Wednesday, the farthest one

can travel in the week from the

Sabbath. The trees are like the

Stations of the Cross: by certain

trees I thank God for certain

favours he has granted me, or

certain gifts he has made to me and

all men. For example, here by this

pine, I thank him for the many

friendships I have and ask him to

look after those of my friends who

are troubled.

They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head

in prayer. After a while he says:

FATHER BENEDETTO

Some walk here in the cool of

evening. Others come at night.

There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself:

FATHER BENEDETTO

I wonder how many bastards have

been made here?

75.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Perhaps you'll stay and settle here

yourself?

JACK

What makes you think I'm leaving?

FATHER BENEDETTO

You told me as much when we first

met. Besides, those who seek for

peace seldom find it. They're

always moving on, looking

elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are

usually sinners.

JACK

All men are sinners.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Some are greater sinners than

others. And those who seek peace

have much sinning in their history.

JACK

I don't seek peace. I never have.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Until now.

JACK

Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The

valley. The villages. The

mountains.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Forgive me. This is the priest in

me speaking. And the friend. But

you have done much sinning, Signor

Clarke. You still do.

JACK

I see a whore. She's young enough

to be my daughter.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I do not refer to the sins of

carnality. But to the deadly

sins...

JACK

Aren't all sins equal?

FATHER BENEDETTO

We are not discussing theology, my

friend, but you. You like this

town, this valley.

(MORE)

76.

FATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd)

You should like to remain here and

find your peace at last. Yet you

cannot. There is something you

cannot ignore. Some force. Some

enemy.

FATHER BENEDETTO

You want to speak but you dare not.

You know no one sufficiently well

to share your history with them.

You know I am trustworthy yet still

you are cautious.

FATHER BENEDETTO

What job do you do, Signor? Are you

on the run, as they say?

JACK

Who says?

FATHER BENEDETTO

It's an expression, no?

JACK

Everyone's on the run from

something.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Some men watch some of the shadows.

You watch them all.

JACK

I've done nothing I didn't have

good cause to do.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Do you wish to tell me?

JACK

For what reason?

FATHER BENEDETTO

For your own sake. Perhaps I can

pray for you?

JACK

I make things. Artifacts.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Counterfeit money?

77.

JACK

Why do you say that?

FATHER BENEDETTO

You work in metal. You are given

some steel by Fabio, the car

doctor.

JACK

You know a lot about me.

FATHER BENEDETTO

I know only what you do in the

town. People talk to me. I am their

priest and they trust me.

JACK

And I should too?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Of course.

JACK

Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he

conceived here father?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Why do you ask me that?

JACK

He looks like you. Even more than

he does in the photos you keep of

each other. Where was he conceived,

father? Under one of these trees?

At night? Like all the other

bastards?

FATHER BENEDETTO

I do not remember, Signor. It was

twenty-five years ago.

78.

FATHER BENEDETTO

In the end it is I who confesses to

you.

JACK

Expecting me to reciprocate?

FATHER BENEDETTO

Perhaps. For your own good. You

cannot doubt the existence of Hell.

You live in it. It is a place

without love. As for me, I go about

my daily duties because the town

requires it of me. Some know what

you know. Perhaps I have no right

to wear these robes. But I do have

a heart full of a father's love.

Something close to His heart! And

for that I am both grateful and

happy.

On JACK.

FATHER BENEDETTO

What do you have, my friend?

Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face.

The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from

the dust.

JACK dresses very carefully for dinner.

It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon

CLARA.

Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda

that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and

jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars.

Of the thirty or so candle-lit tables that dot the veranda,

more than half are occupied by romantic couples.

JACK scans the tables and checks his watch. It's shortly

after seven pm and there's no sign of CLARA.

He waits. Then turns to leave.

CLARA (O.S.)

Ciao.

79.

She kisses him once on the lips. She's hot and flustered.

She's been rushing.

CLARA

I did not think you would come.

JACK

I wasn't sure you meant me to.

CLARA looks doubtful. It's the same look she gave him at the

cafe. She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution.

Getting involved. Her heart is pulling one way and her head

another.

CLARA

Certo.

A WAITER approaches.

WAITER

Per due?

Judging by his disapproving tone, the WAITER seems to know

what CLARA does for a living. CLARA senses this immediately.

CLARA

Si.

CLARA and JACK sit at a table overlooking the town.

The WAITER lights their candle and deposits two menus

peremptorily.

CLARA

Una botiglia di acqua minerale non

gasata et... una Parasini, per

favore.

Completely ignoring her, the WAITER addresses JACK with a

wink.

WAITER

Menu in Inglese?

A beat.

JACK

No, grazie.

WAITER

Tedesco? Olandese?

CLARA

(to the WAITER)

He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:

80.

CLARA

Una botiglia di acqua minerale et

una Parasini, per favore.

WAITER

Gasata?

CLARA

Non gasata.

CLARA

(mostly to herself)

Cittadina.

JACK

Small towns.

CLARA

Parasini. From Calabria. It is

good, you will agree?

JACK

It is. Very good.

CLARA

Can I ask you something, Eduardo?

JACK

Sure.

CLARA

You are married?

81.

JACK

No.

JACK

I doubt any of the couples here

are. With the exception of the

Germans at table seven. She's

wearing a wedding ring and they

haven't spoken a word to each other

for eight and half minutes.

CLARA

I was sure this was your secret.

JACK

What makes you think I have a

secret? I'm an ordinary man. I

cough. I fart. I earn a living.

CLARA

I do not think you are an ordinary

man. I think you are a good man.

But you have a secret.

CLARA

He thinks we are a couple.

JACK

Why spoil the illusion?

CLARA

(in ITALIAN)

As long as we know it is an

illusion.

WAITER

Buona sera. Desidera?

82.

JACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth.

They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his.

They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging

with   other couples.

The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO

are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK

is the oldest person there.

The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small

silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In

front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae.

CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit

drunk.

CLARA

Woooow!

She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her

pleasure.

JACK

How is it?

CLARA

Bitchin'.

JACK

(amused)

Bitchin'?

CLARA

It's- come se dice- `slang', no?

Eco.

She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce

and holds it out to JACK.

JACK

No thanks.

CLARA

Come on, Eduardo!

He hesitates. He eats.

CLARA

It is good, you will agree?

JACK

(his mouth full)

I will agree.

83.

CLARA

(sensing his teasing)

My English is nice!

JACK

It's bitchin'.

CLARA

(defending herself)

You know how to swear in Italian?

JACK

Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.

CLARA

"Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia

merde e morte: tuo cazzo un

brufolo.

JACK

Eat shit and die, pimple dick?

CLARA

Perdone!

JACK

I guess I've led a sheltered life.

Of sorts.

CLARA

Shell-tered?

JACK

Too much work.

CLARA

Too much work.

CLARA

I don't apologise, Eduardo.

JACK

For what?

CLARA

For this I do. My job.

JACK

Never apologise.

84.

CLARA

Except this job is full of testa di

cazzo.

JACK

Mine too.

CLARA

Lei?

JACK

Si.

CLARA

But you are too young to...

pensione?

JACK

Retire.

CLARA

Si.

JACK

Liar.

CLARA

No!

JACK

Would you be flattering me if I

wasn't a client?

JACK

Am I a client?

CLARA

This say yes.

CLARA

This...

CLARA

This cannot be for sale. But I am

not want to... come se dice?

85.

JACK

Give it away.

She looks at him.

JACK studies her, searching for his own feelings.

CLARA

Stronzo! I buy you a present!

She fishes about in her handbag...

...and produces a SILVER BOX.

JACK unwraps the shiny paper. Inside is a plastic case like

the sort you put engagement rings in. Inside the case is a

BADGE, hand-painted, depicting the symbol of the region: the

eagle of L'Aquila. JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel.

JACK

Grazie.

An embarrassed beat.

CLARA kisses him.

JACK

Grazie, Clara.

CLARA

Prego. Eduardo.

A pause.

CLARA

My apartment is not far from here.

JACK opens his eyes.

Sits up.

He's shocked to have slept so deeply.

CLARA must be in the shower.

He looks around at the little room casually, like a curious

lover.

Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet.

Finds a VIBRATOR.

Opens the bottom drawer.

Finds a RED PURSE.

86.

Inside the RED PURSE...

Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT.

Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom.

JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep.

JACK has driven to the remotest phone box he can find: not

far from the entrance to one of the region's four national

parks: beside a lake, below a mountain range and approached

by a long, straight, empty road.

No one could possibly creep up on him here. Nevertheless, as

he talks, JACK makes his habitual and continuous 360 scan of

the area.

LARRY (V.O.)

We're moving the drop.

JACK

Where?

LARRY (V.O.)

We don't know yet. I'll call you

ten am on the day with a venue.

Give you enough time to make the

noon delivery.

JACK

I don't deliver, Larry. I never

deliver. It's too dangerous. She

comes to me. I know the town.

That's what we agreed.

LARRY (V.O.)

I told `em. I told `em if there was

even the slightest chance security

had been breached, you'd have dealt

with it immediately.

A beat.

JACK

Breach? What breach?

For the first time in the movie we cut to LARRY at home:

LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a

large, imperial mahogany desk. In front of him are two banks

of screens.

87.

The first bank displays 3 CCTV views: (1) the entrance to his

apartment block (2) a staircase and (3) the entrance to his

apartment itself.

Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS: (1) CNN, (2)

BBC WORLD and (3) AL JAZEERA.

LARRY

Our pretty young Belgian client and

her associates think someone on

your long list of enemies might

have put a tail on you.

JACK (V.O.)

Not possible.

LARRY

Course not, Jack. But if, for the

sake of argument, it was possible-

I'm thinking it could be Galazzo.

Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.

JACK (V.O.)

Cops?

LARRY

The crooked kind.

JACK (V.O.)

How come I'm still here?

LARRY

The Belgians think they're planning

to wait for the drop and

exterminate you and Mathilde in one

swoop.

With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the

scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of

the US DOLLAR.

JACK (V.O.)

Where the hell's this information

coming from?

LARRY

I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you

want my opinion, they're just being

jittery. I told `em you were the

most security conscious

professional I know. I told `em no

one gets close to you.

JACK

They don't.

88.

LARRY (V.O.)

I told `em if we couldn't trust you

to keep a tight lid on operations

the who could we trust?

JACK

They can. They can trust me and so

can you.

JACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated:

JACK

I've never jeopardised an operation

in my life.

LARRY (V.O.)

You don't have to tell me that,

Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed

your own girlfriend's account...

ECU on JACK.

The words are out before he can stop them.

LARRY

Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.

He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity.

LARRY

That was, um.... I'm just saying

you can be relied on.

Silence.

LARRY

Jack?

CLICK.

JACK has hung up.

He is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding.

Amongst the GARGOYLES...

...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars.

His POV:

89.

Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG

ITALIAN MAN in a suit.

He is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA

looks very, very serious.

The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a

smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome

plates.

When he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone.

JACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts:

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a

chilled bottle of Aspirinio

-a loaf of course bread

-two clods of mozarella

-150 gms of proscuitto

-and his WALTHER PPK/S.

CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to

the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a

tree.

She is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag

rounded out by a watermelon.

JACK pulls his CAR into the curb.

CLARA

Ciao, Eduardo!

She opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long

and full on the lips.

JACK

Put them in the back. We've got a

way to go.

She puts the plastic bag in the trunk.

Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER.

CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt.

90.

She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the

RED PURSE.

And drives.

CLARA

Where we go?

JACK

Swimming.

CLARA

How far do we go? To Fanale?

JACK

An hour. And we're not going to the

sea, we're going to the lakes. In

the mountains.

CLARA

For a... come se dice... you have

in the back...

JACK

A picnic.

CLARA

A pick-nick! We are going for a

pick-nick. Just the two of us.

She looks at him.

CLARA

I have practise my English,

Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick.

It is a beautiful day, isn't it?

JACK

It is.

The CAR negotiates a familiar hairpin bend.

CLARA is station hopping.

She finds some LOU REED. She loves LOUD REED.

JACK is concentrating on the road.

CLARA

Is it more far?

91.

JACK

Ten kilometres. Another twenty

minutes.

She pauses to work out the mathematics. She's smart. And

puzzled. But she's not frightened. Not yet.

CLARA

Twelve kilometres? In twenty

minutes?

JACK

We're going off the beaten track.

She looks confused.

JACK

Lontano. Fuori mano.

CLARA laughs.

CLARA

You will speak Italian. One day, I

will teach you.

JACK turns off the main road and onto an alpine track.

This is the same route he took with the Belgian woman.

The CAR bumps and tilts on the rough terrain.

CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track.

CLARA

Where are we going?

Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected.

JACK

You shall see.

CLARA

I think it is good we should stay

close to the road.

JACK

There's no need to worry. I've been

here before several times. Taking

photographs.

He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the

Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave.

92.

JACK

You're not afraid of coming into

the wild with me, are you?

CLARA

No!

CLARA

Of course I am not. Not with you.

But this...

CLARA

...sentiero!

CLARA

You should have a jeep. A Toyota.

It is not good for a... berlina.

JACK

This is a Citroen!

JACK

This was made by the French for

taking potatoes to market. Besides,

I always come here in this car.

CLARA

You sure?

JACK

Of course. I don't want to walk

back to town any more than you do.

CLARA

I think you are crazy. This will go

to nowhere.

JACK

I assure you it does.

93.

CLARA

Now there is no road!

CLARA

Is this where we go?

JACK

No. Not quite. We go another

hundred metres, through the wood.

But from here we just roll forward.

No motor. No sound. And you'll see

a wonder.

JACK

You won't need to hold on. I'll go

slowly. Just relax and look.

CLARA

No one comes here?

JACK

No.

CLARA

Just you.

JACK

Yes.

94.

CLARA

Well?

CLARA

I am going to swim in the lake. Are

you coming?

JACK

There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!

CLARA

Maybe! But I am lucky!

CLARA

(shouting)

He is an Italian bird! We disturb

his siesta!

CLARA

Come, Signor Farfalla!

CLARA

Come!

95.

CLARA

Stand by me.

CLARA

Keep still. Watch.

JACK

If we stay here for a year, they'll

devour us.

CLARA

It is said that if these fishes

bite at two hands holding, then

love is good for the people.

JACK

Maybe we should...

CLARA

Do you make love in the water?

JACK

I haven't.

CLARA

What's wrong?

JACK

Let's eat.

96.

He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart

around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds,

travelling with the waves made by their departure.

CLARA is lying naked on a blanket.

Beside her is the RED PURSE.

Through sleepy, half-closed eyes she is watching L'AMERICANO.

From her POV, JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER,

unpacking the food and wine. The LID of the basket obscures

his hands.

CLARA

Eduardo.

JACK looks at her.

CLARA

Is this your real name?

A beat.

JACK

Is Clara yours?

CLARA

Si. Yes.

She looks at him. Waiting for his reply.

JACK

Edward is my real name.

CLARA

Ed-ward.

She doesn't believe him.

CLARA

You are sure you are not married,

Eduardo?

JACK

Quite sure.

About this he's telling the truth.

CLARA reaches for the RED PURSE.

From behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the CLICK of a

cocking mechanism.

CLARA hesitates for a moment.

97.

CLARA

Will you put this on my back?

CLARA

Eduardo?

CLARA

Amore?

CLARA

Eduardo, what's wrong?

JACK

Nothing.

98.

He takes the tube of SUNTAN lotion.

JACK (V.O.)

Dear Father Benedetto...

And begins to run it into CLARA's back.

JACK (V.O.)

I promised myself that I would

write to you- as your friend- to

say goodbye.

SLAM!

JACK shuts the boot of the car.

He scans the lakeside.

No sign of the picnic.

No sign of CLARA.

JACK (V.O.)

Everything I've ever done...

Then he spots something.

On the ground, not far from the car.

He walks over and picks it up.

It's one of CLARA's shoes.

JACK (V.O.)

I've done for a reason.

JACK is staring at the SHOE.

JACK (V.O.)

I never thought the day would come

when I'd run out of reasons.

Reasons to worry. Reasons to run.

Reasons to pull the trigger.

JACK turns and walks over to the car.

CLARA is in the passenger seat.

JACK (V.O.)

Maybe that day's come.

JACK gets into the Citroen.

99.

JACK (V.O.)

Or maybe I've just found a reason

to change.

CLARA

Grazie, Eduardo.

JACK

I still don't understand. What's

the point of a gun if it's not

loaded?

CLARA

One of the girls borrow it to me

after the second hooker in Chieti

is murdered. With some of the

clients it make me feel safe. I

don't tell the police, of course,

but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they

do to these two women! A police

agente from Rome show me

photographs. They show photographs

to everyone in Via Lampedusa.

CLARA

Non capito... how one person hurt

another in this way.

JACK

Does the gun make you feel safer

with me?

CLARA

You are not a client.

JACK

Then why's it in your purse?

CLARA

I have to work tonight, amore.

JACK (V.O.)

Maybe this is suicide. Cops often

put the graft on working girls.

Perhaps the girl I told you about,

Clara, has sold me out.

(MORE)

100.

JACK (V.O.) (cont'd)

Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe

she's a hired gun. Then again,

maybe Clara is who she says she is

and my Belgian clients will take

the gun, shoot me themselves and

keep the money. Always a risk in my

profession. Or perhaps my trusted

colleague in Rome no longer trusts

me. Perhaps even you, Father, with

your connections in Naples...

CLARA

What will you do?

JACK

I guess I'll go to work too.

CLARA

And after that? Tomorrow and the

next day.

JACK

I can't stay here forever.

JACK (V.O.)

It's not that I've given up on

life, Father. Just the way that I

was living it. If you can call it

living.

CLARA

I want always to stay here.

JACK

It's time to go home.

CLARA

Let me come to your home.

JACK

I can't, Clara. One day...

JACK (V.O.)

If I had one request, Father, it

would be this. That it's not Clara

who finally pulls the trigger. But

whoever it is...

CLARA

Stay forever here.

101.

JACK (V.O.)

...by this time tomorrow I'll be

dead.

Fade to black.

FADE IN:

A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Ciao Fabio, come stai?

IL POSTINO

Bene grazie, Padre.

We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a

bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye.

He opens it and starts to read aloud:

FATHER BENEDETTO

Dear Father Benedetto. I promised

myself that I would write to you-

as your friend- to say goodbye...

JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the

black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand.

He surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been

meticulously tidied away.

FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)

Everything I've ever done...

JACK leaves.

Only thing is left behind:

The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE on the

bedside table.

FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)

I've done for a reason.

102.

The sun is shining. The mountains young and sharp and

beautiful. The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that

spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel.

JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks

backwards and forwards.

JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a

forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a

convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe.

The car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the

EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised.

JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and

slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket.

Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's

only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the

distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak...

JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away.

He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't.

As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the

source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine

oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze.

Empty.

JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe. From here he

can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service

entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. Through the

window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the

slip road to and from the autostrada.

JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a

PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser. He checks

his watch. It is two minutes before noon. He orders an

espresso.

His nerve-heightened senses take in everything: the sound of

the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak,

creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly

revolving.

JACK's eyes flick outside to the forecourt.

103.

MATHILDE

Hello. I see you have brought it in

from the car with you.

JACK

All there, as agreed.

MATHILDE

What's in the paper bag?

JACK

Sweets. For your journey.

JACK

I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.

MATHILDE

That is most thoughtful of you.

JACK

I suppose I'll read about this in

the Times or the International

Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.

MATHILDE

Yes, I expect so.

104.

She drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid-air and looking

out the window.

JACK follows her eye-line to check she's not signalling to an

accomplice.

The FORECOURT is still empty.

Creak, creak, creak, creak...

MATHILDE looks at JACK. Her expression is impossible to read.

Perhaps it's tinged with sadness. She drinks the rest of her

coffee.

MATHILDE

I'm just going to the ladies. Wait

here.

She picks up the CASE.

There is nothing JACK can do about this. She has taken him

off guard and grasped the initiative.

All he can do is wait.

MATHILDE enters a cubicle, opens the CASE, bypasses the

stationary, lifts the false bottom and checks the SOCIMI

parts are present and correct.

Then she loads a magazine.

MATHILDE returns from the bathroom.

MATHILDE

Shall we go.

Not a question, a command.

JACK is obliged to stand up.

MATHILDE walks towards a large FORD.

She is carrying the BRIEFCASE.

JACK has his right hand in his jacket pocket.

MATHILDE

You won't need your piece.

105.

JACK

You never know.

MATHILDE

OK?

JACK

Sure. You?

MATHILDE

Everything's just fine.

MATHILDE

Final payment.

MATHILDE

Buy yourself a retirement clock.

JACK

How do you know I'm retiring?

MATHILDE

Have you taken your girl up to the

meadow yet?

106.

MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved.

MATHILDE

(whispers to JACK)

Do it.

She gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the

BRIEFCASE into the back.

MATHILDE

Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.

JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell.

The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto

the autostrada.

JACK watches it go.

Thumbs back the lever on his Walther.

Gets into his Citroen.

And opens the ENVELOPE.

-No wires.

-No tricks.

-Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS.

JACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For

a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and

listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl

calling: "Amore!" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of

traffic on the autostrada.

SMASH CUT TO:

JACK drives fast...

...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA.

At the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true

Italian: illegally.

Runs towards CLARA'S APARTMENT.

And rings the buzzer.

No answer.

107.

JACK rings again.

Still nothing.

Shouts up at her window:

JACK

CLARA!

We're at another roadside service station.

LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD.

MATHILDE drives off.

LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt.

He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it.

LARRY

Not only did you not kill him, you

gave him my fucking money?

MATHILDE

What else could I do? There were

kids everywhere. Besides he's

suspicious.

LARRY

He's paranoid. That's why I'm

paying you the GDP of a small

country to get close to him. You

could have got him in the sack. You

should have got him in the car

park. Now you're going to have to

take him out long range!

MATHILDE

I prefer it that way.

She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK.

MATHILDE

The Socimi is the perfect weapon.

LARRY

Let's hope his workmanship is up to

scratch.

108.

He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING

SUBMACHINE GUN.

LARRY

Sweden turned Jack into a

liability. Three stiffs: two

shooters and an innocent civilian.

I can't afford a mistake like that

again. Europol are crooked but they

aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to

make me money. Not run up cleaning

bills.

MATHILDE

He made short work of the last guy

you hired.

LARRY

Never mind Larson. He didn't stand

a chance, not against someone as

paranoid as Jack. The Swede was

only there to take Jack's heat off

you. So don't fuck this up again.

He grabs a TIN of fruit sweets.

LARRY

Mind if I help myself?

LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION.

LARRY

Shit.

He looks around the Ford.

LARRY

Is there any actual candy in this

gas guzzler?

JACK turns off under the sign for CASTEL DEL MONTE.

The town square is jam-packed with cars and coaches.

Hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church

steps. There is even a camera crew.

The church doors open and FATHER BENEDETTO steps out to a

huge cheer.

Behind him, LOCAL MEN are carrying a larger than life painted

wooden STATUE OF SAINT DOMINIC.

109.

Draped over the saint's shoulder and wrapped around his neck

are around twenty five or thirty live SNAKES- local Viperi-

each one several feet long and as thick as a skinny forearm.

A local BAND strikes up as the STATUE is carried down the

steps, FATHER BENEDETTO leading the strange annual religious

parade around the town square, followed by a group of ALTAR

BOYS.

The giant FORD pulls up outside the town's only proper HOTEL.

MATHILDE gets out carrying the SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE.

JACK is looking for someone. The square is so tightly packed

it's hard to see, let alone move.

Then he spots her.

CLARA.

She's on the other side of the square, standing on the stone

steps beneath a STATUE OF AN EAGLE. Her friend ANNA is beside

her, taking photographs of the parade with a small digital

camera. JACK moves towards CLARA.

ANNA, through her viewfinder, is the first to notice him. She

points JACK out to CLARA. CLARA waves at him. She says

something to ANNA and descends into the crowd. JACK and CLARA

squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another

as we cut to...

MATHILDE emerges through the fire escape door and walks to

the edge of the roof.

She opens the black SAMSONITE CASE and unpacks the top layer

of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of

the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

Expertly she assembles the bastardised gun- including

TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- slotting a full

magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggling the butt

to her shoulder and placing her eye beside the rubber cup on

the sight.

In the centre of the CROSS-HAIRS:

110.

JACK and CLARA meet.

She kisses him. It is a long and loving kiss.

The CROSS-HAIRS find the centre of JACK's head.

MATHILDE'S FINGER... taking up the trigger slack.

Other HEADS...

-TOURISTS

-LOCALS

-KIDS on their PARENTS' SHOULDERS

...keep blocking our view of JACK.

The TRIGGER FINGER, hesitating.

We're right in the midst of the crowd.

JACK and CLARA have to shout at one another above the noise

of the band.

JACK

When can I see you?

CLARA

I have to work tonight.

Their happiness clouds over. But the clouds pass quickly.

CLARA

You come to my apartment after.

JACK

If I asked you would you come away

with me?

CLARA

Come away with you?

JACK

Why not?

111.

CLARA

Together?

JACK

Together.

CLARA

Where?

JACK

Wherever. Then when we're through,

we could come back here. For good.

CLARA

To live?

JACK

Where else?

CLARA

Forever?

JACK

Forever.

A pause.

JACK

Unless you have other plans.

CLARA

Other plans?

She swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself

around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There are

tears in her eyes.

CLARA

I love you, Signor Eduardo

Farfalla.

He looks at her.

JACK

I...

The TRIGGER FINGER squeezes.

The SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires.

An EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately

360 miles per hour headed straight for JACK's temporal lobe.

Only it never gets there.

112.

The gun jams.

A chamber explosion is a nasty thing. Instead of shooting out

of the barrel, the round explodes in the cannon's chamber.

Hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine, ripping into

MATHILDE's hands, forearms and face...

A loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart. Amidst the noise of

the festival, no one else seems to notice.

JACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF.

CLARA

What's happening?

JACK

Someone got what was coming to

them.

He turns to her:

JACK

Go to your apartment and pack. Wait

`till I get there. Don't answer the

door to anyone but me.

CLARA

Eduardo, please?

JACK

Trust me.

She looks at him.

CLARA

I trust you.

She wants to, but she doesn't.

JACK

Clara. My name is not Eduardo.

CLARA

No?

JACK

My name is Jack.

CLARA

Jack.

She looks worried.

113.

CLARA

You promise you're not married?

JACK

I promise. Take this.

He hands her an ENVELOPE. It contains his final instalment.

JACK

Look after it. In case.

CLARA

(perplexed)

In case?

He wants to say it but he can't bring himself to.

In case this is goodbye.

JACK

Now go.

LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square.

He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone,

scanning the crowds around him.

In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps

free of a row cars on the other side of the street.

As LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING

SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands.

And LARRY sees JACK.

LARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger.

L'AMERICANO throws himself to one side.

There is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along

the line of parked cars.

PANIC erupts.

JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover

behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst.

JACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun...

...and retrieves it just as LARRY fires again.

SCREAMS spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire

moving down the street and spilling into the town square.

114.

JACK runs into the square.

LARRY pursues him, firing for a third time.

The buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo

around the square, bouncing off the walls and confusing the

crowd.

People start to run in different directions- everyone heading

for the maze of alleys that surround the main square.

ALTAR BOYS scatter. So do the LOCAL MEN carrying the STATUE

OF SAINT DOMINIC. The STATUE tumbles and smashes. Escaping

SNAKES writhe. FATHER BENEDETTO takes cover.

The two LOCAL CARABINIERI in their Land Rover get caught up

in the chaos. Confused, they turn on their SIRENS.

LARRY spots JACK in the crowd and fires a fourth time.

One TOURIST is killed outright, another injured

JACK dives for cover behind the STATUE OF THE EAGLE where he

spotted Clara.

Bullets ricochet.

LARRY

You're too old for this life, Jack.

LARRY struggles for breath as he reloads.

This is JACK's chance.

LARRY

You get sentimental then you fuck

things up.

Rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle, JACK

spreads his legs, faces LARRY and fires the customary TWO

PRECISION-ENGINEERED SHOTS that make up a military-style

execution:

The first shot hits LARRY in the heart. LARRY is thrown

backwards against a parked car, accidentally altering his arc

of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside JACK, chips of

marble stinging against his calves.

Again, JACK takes aim.

A beat as his finger tightens on the trigger.

HEADSHOT. Half LARRY'S FACE is wiped out of existence. What's

left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees. His

hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops. He falls

forwards and his STERLING clatters on the cobble stones.

115.

JACK

What will you tell them?

FATHER BENEDETTO

I will them that the man who wrote

this letter is my friend.

FATHER BENEDETTO

Jack.

116.

Using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes

that make up the medieval heart of the town, JACK avoids the

CARABINIERI and, stealing a bicycle, makes it onto the main

road before a road block has been set up.

JACK collects a sports bag from a LOCKER.

JACK washes the blood from his hands.

When he emerges from the bathroom JACK is wearing the clothes

of a fifty year-old American tourist from the mid-West with

glasses and a baseball cap.

He checks the time of next bus to Rome.

Then glances at his watch.

He has thirty minutes.

JACK walks towards Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.

Two hundred metres up ahead, two OFFICERS of the Guardia di

Finanza wait in an unmarked car.

JACK walks past Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.

And keeps walking.

The BUS for Rome is barely half-full.

Blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged American

tourists, JACK boards the steps, purchases a ticket and takes

a seat at the rear.

A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.

JACK alone at the back of the BUS.

117.

THE END.
