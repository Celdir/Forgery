THE DEPARTED

COSTELLO (V.O.)

I don't want to be a product of my

environment. I want my environment

to be a product...of me.

COSTELLO (V.O.)

Years ago, we had the Church. That

was only a way of saying we had

each other. The Knights of Columbus

were head-breakers. They took over

their piece of the city.

COSTELLO (V.O.)

Twenty years after an Irishman

couldn't get a job, we had the

presidency. That's what the niggers

don't realize. If I got one thing

against the black chaps it's this.

No one gives it to you. You have to

take it.

YOUNG COSTELLO

(leaning over cluttered

counter)

Don't make me have to come down

here again.

(CONTINUED)

2.

PROPRIETOR

Won't happen again, Mr. C.

YOUNG COSTELLO

Carmen's developing into a fine

young lady. You should be proud.

You get your period yet, Carmen?

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

You live with your grandmother?

YOUNG COLIN

Yeah.

COSTELLO

Get him three loaves of bread. And

a couple of half gallons of milk.

And some soup.

(CONTINUED)

3.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Do you like comic books?

YOUNG COSTELLO

You do good in school?

COLIN

Yes.

YOUNG COSTELLO

That's good. I did good in school.

They call that a paradox.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the

change.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

You ever want to earn a little

extra money, you come by L street.

You know where I am on L street.

YOUNG COLIN

Thank you.

(CONTINUED)

4.

PRIEST (V.O.)

To you, O Lord we commend the soul

of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the

sight of this world he is now dead;

in your sight may he live forever.

Forgive whatever sins he committed

through human weakness and in your

goodness grant him everlasting

peace.

ALL

Amen.

PRIEST (VO)

May the angels lead you into

paradise; May the martyrs come to

welcome you and take you to the

holy city, The new and eternal

Jerusalem.

YOUNG COSTELLO

Church wants you in your place.

What sort of man wants to be kept

in his place? Do this don't do

that, kneel, stand, kneel,

stand...I mean if you go for that

sort of thing...

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

I don't know what to do for you. A

man makes his own way. No one gives

it to you. You have to take it.

(a beat)

Non serviam.

YOUNG COLIN

James Joyce.

(CONTINUED)

5.

YOUNG COSTELLO

Him and Lucifer. And me.

(to the room)

Guineas from the North End and down

Providence, tried to tell me what

to do...And something maybe

happened to them.

COSTELLO

Jeez, she fell funny.

FRENCH

Frank, you gotta see somebody.

YOUNG COSTELLO

You decide to be something, you can

be it. That's what they don't tell

you, the Church.

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

When I was your age, they would

say, we become cops or criminals.

Today, what I'm saying to you is

this: When you are facing a loaded

gun...

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)

What's the difference?

6.

INSTRUCTOR

The slug enters the skull by

forming a small entrance hole.

Blood and brain matter is ejected

backwards from this hole. The

bullet, which may expand, fragment

or tumble, then passes through the

brain...

COLIN

Fucking firemen are getting pussy

for the first time in the history

of fire. Or pussy.

(CONTINUED)

7.

BARRIGAN

What are you looking at? Forget

it. Your father was a janitor, and

his son's only a cop.

COLIN

(not vainglorious, but

innocently stretching for

the idea)

You're in trouble if you're "only"

anything.

BARRIGAN

Don't tell me I'm looking at the

first dickhead-American president

of the United States.

SPEAKER (V.O.)

The Massachusetts State Police has

a long tradition of excellence.

Your graduation today solidifies

your acceptance into one of the

finest law enforcement agencies in

our nation. As the Governor of the

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am

confident each and every one of you

will serve with distinction, honor

and integrity.

THE MAYOR VO

Congratulations. You are dismissed.

(CONTINUED)

8.

COSTELLO

School's out. You earned it. Yeah,

no more teachers, no more books.

INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)

Begin.

BROWN

She tells me, you never finish

anything.

(puff puff)

You finish the police course you

get taken care of again baby.

(puff puff)

So after graduation

(puff puff)

I get a blowjob again.

BILLY

That's great. Your mom must be a

wonderful woman.

BROWN

Fuck yourself.

(CONTINUED)

9.

BILLY

Look at it this way, you're a black

guy in Boston. You don't need any

help from me to be completely

fucked.

BROWN

Ways to get ahead, though, man,

ways to get ahead.

BILLY

(exasperated by this)

To where. (Yeah)

DRILL INSTRUCTOR

This is not the regular police.

This is the state police. Your

training will illustrate the

difference. What's the difference?

BILLY

(sotto voce to BROWN)

Rage issues and lower median IQ.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR

You say something?

BILLY

Sir, I was agreeing with you about

our obvious superiority to other

forms of police, sir.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR

We're not superior, we're the best.

BILLY

Sir, yes sir.

10.

COLIN

(calling to other cops)

Douchebag!

QUEENAN

Congratulations on passing the

detective exam, and welcome to the

Special Investigation Unit.

DIGNAM

(tonelessly)

Whoop-di fuckin' do.

QUEENAN

We won't be working directly

together, you'll be working for

Captain Ellerby, but I like to see

everybody.

(contemplating him)

You're a worker, you rise fast.

(CONTINUED)

11.

DIGNAM

Like a twelve year old's dick.

(Alt: Like a turd in the pool.)

COLIN

Thank you, Sergeant.

DIGNAM

My pleasure.

COLIN

(to Queenan)

Thank you, sir.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY

(whispering, joyful, in

love with COLIN)

Congratulations.

COLIN

Thanks, hon.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY

(coldly)

You can go in there now.

QUEENAN

You can sit.

(CONTINUED)

12.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

So.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

Do you know what we do here?   My

section?

BILLY

Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...

SGT. DIGNAM

Whoa, let's say you have no idea

and leave it there. No idea. Zip,

none. If you had an idea about what

we do we would not be good at what

we do. We would be cunts. Are you

calling us cunts?

QUEENAN

(not looking up from

papers)

Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style

of his own. I'm afraid we all have

to deal with it.

SGT. DIGNAM

(getting to business,

hard)

You have family connections down in

Southie. Through your father. Tell

us about your uncle Jackie.

BILLY

Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for

Jordan Marsh.

SGT. DIGNAM

Uncle Jackie was a small-time

bookie who tended bar at the Vets

in Somerville.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

13.

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)

He got popped by Nicastro in '95.

They found his body out by the

airport.

BILLY

That's right.

(tightly)

I remember his funeral.

SGT. DIGNAM

(cruelly)

Closed casket?

BILLY

That's right.

SGT. DIGNAM

You tell anybody at Deerfield -

that is, before you got kicked out

for whaling on a gym teacher with a

folding chair - you had an uncle

met his demise like that?

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)

I got a question. How fucked up are

you?

BARRIGAN

What you got?

(with admiration and envy)

"Staff Sergeant". In four years

you're a sergeant.

COLIN

SIU. What a country.

BARRIGAN

(after a beat)

Perfect.

(CONTINUED)

14.

COLIN

I don't mind going it alone. If you

could go it alone you might get

somewhere yourself.

BARRIGAN

We're cops. This isn't "somewhere".

COLIN

I know you're a worker. I might be

able to do something for you. You

got any suits at home or you like

coming to work looking like you're

gonna invade Poland.

SGT. DIGNAM

Let's look at the rest of the

family tree. Your maggot uncle

Tommy Costigan--he's another goof--

got busted selling guns to federal

officers. Among many, many, many

other departures from, ah,

"normative behavior".

BILLY

What's this got to do with me?

SGT. DIGNAM

Why are you pretending to be a cop?

ELLERBY

This unit is new, and you are the

newest members of it. You have been

selected for it on the basis of

intelligence and aptitude.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

15.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

This is an elite unit. Our job is

to smash--or at least marginally

disrupt--

(he gets the laugh he

expected)

--organized crime in this city by

our own efforts and by enhanced

cooperation with the FBI,

represented here by Agent Frank

Lazio--

(show the deeply

unreliable dandy LAZIO)

and we will do it. And by organized

crime in this city...you know who

we mean.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

(clicking the button)

That's Jackie Costigan...that's an

old picture. Jackie met his demise.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Last known photograph.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Costello uses three key guys.

There's Fitzy...off the boat

psycho...lives in Brockton with his

mother who looks like she's

straight out of "Going My Way"...

There's Delahunt, muscle, and

here's French...the number one. But

of course the rock star is...[you

know who]

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

We've done a briefing book. Read

up.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

16.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

I want to have any and all ideas,

so I can pass them off as my own.

(laughter, a long beat)

Do your jobs and you will rise

fast. You're in the best position

in the department. Let's go to

work.

DIGNAM

Your old man was a hump from

Southie. Baggage-handler at the

airport. Family's all criminals

except your old man.

BILLY

And one priest. Since you seem to

know everything.

DIGNAM

I ain't sure about him, either.

(ALT: Last I heard he was happily

married to a 12 year old boy and

living on a beach in Thailand.)

Family's dug into the Southie

projects like ticks. Lifers down

there. Three decker men at best.

You grew up, however, up the North

shore. La di (fuckin') da.

DIGNAM (CONT'D)

You were kind of a double kid, I

bet, right? One kid with your old

man. One kid with your mother.

Upper middle class in the week, and

then dropping your 'r's and hanging

in the Southie projects with daddy

the donkey on the weekends. I got

that right?

(CONTINUED)

17.

SGT. DIGNAM

You have different accents? You

did, didn't you. (You little

fuckin' snake.) You were different

fuckin' people.

BILLY

You a psychiatrist?

SGT. DIGNAM

If I was I'd ask you why you're a

Statie making thirty grand a year.

And I think if I were Sigmund

fucking Freud himself I wouldn't

get an answer. So tell me, what's a

lace curtain motherfucker like you

doing in the Staties?

BILLY

Well. Families are always rising or

falling in America. Am I right?

QUEENAN

(appreciative, kindly,

looking up from his

papers)

Who said that?

BILLY

Hawthorne.

DIGNAM

What's the matter, smartass? You

don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare?

QUEENAN

We have a question. You want to be

a cop, or do you want to appear to

be a cop. It's an honest question.

Lot of guys want to appear to be

cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're

on TV...

SGT. DIGNAM

A lot of em just want to slam a

nigger's head through a plate glass

window.

(CONTINUED)

18.

BILLY

I'm all set without your personal

job application, Sergeant.

DIGNAM

(after a "we got a live

one" glance at Queenan)

What the fuck did you say to me,

trainee?

BILLY

Sir, with all due respect, sir,

what is it you want from me?

DIGNAM

Hey asshole, he can't help you. I

know what you are, and what you

aren't. I'm the best friend you

ever had on the face of the earth.

I'm gonna help you understand

something: You're no fuckin' cop.

QUEENAN

He's right.

(Billy looks at Queenan)

We deal in deceptions here. But

what we don't deal with is self-

deception. In five years, you might

be anything else in the world, but

you won't be a Massachusetts State

trooper.

BILLY

You sure of that?

QUEENAN

I'm sure of that.

DIGNAM

Guaranteed.

QUEENAN

(looking up from his

papers)

You don't have much family.

(CONTINUED)

19.

BILLY

(deciding this on the

spot)

I don't have any family.

WASP UNCLE

What's this I hear from Stephanie

about you becoming a policeman?

BILLY

You mean Stephanie who was the only

one who came to my father's

funeral? That Stephanie?

UNCLE

That Stephanie.

BILLY

Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.

UNCLE

Are you trying to prove something

to the family?

BILLY

When you say "family", what do you

mean? You?

(CONTINUED)

20.

UNCLE

You always question everything,

don't you?

BILLY

Yeah, well, maybe it would have

done you some good to have a

question from time to time. "Am I

an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?"

"Is my wife a money-grubbing

whore?" Those are questions.

(the UNCLE starts to

leave)

"Have I been good to my dying

sister or am I just pretending to

be?"

(he's stung THE UNCLE)

Too late now, right?

UNCLE

Do you need some money for the

funeral?

BILLY

When my mother dies we don't have

any connection. You got it?

REALTOR

This is it. Nice. You've got high

ceilings, parquet floors. There's a

lock on the fridge in case you have

eating issues.... Joke...not a very

good one.

(uneasy)

So, you're a policeman?

(CONTINUED)

21.

COLIN

(like something he is used

to reciting)

I'm a State Police detective.

REALTOR

(wondering where he gets

his money from)

State Police Detective. You a

married State Police Detective?

COLIN

(coming out of his reverie

and coldly:)

...No.

REALTOR

Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if

a cop...

COLIN

I have a cosigner.

REALTOR

You intend to have a housemate.

That's cool.

COLIN

Give me the fuckin' papers.

BILLY

So what do I do?

QUEENAN

During the war, Churchill used

river mines. He'd float them down

the rivers into Germany. They'd

either hit something, or not.

That's what we'll use you for. I'll

float you down the river. The rest

will happen. Or it won't...

(a beat)

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

22.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

By the way, this isn't police work

for peanuts. There's money behind

this operation. You won't be paid

as a cop, but there is a bonus

involved. Tax free.

DIGNAM

Luck of the Irish. All that and

you're still young enough to fuck

undergraduates.

QUEENAN

We can't conceal that you've been a

trainee. You'll be convicted of a

crime. We're thinking that a guilty

plea to assault and battery might

make sense.

DIGNAM

Given your nature.

QUEENAN

You'll serve enough jail time to

convince anyone that it's no set-

up. You'll be on probation. The

whole nine yards.

DIGNAM

I need you, pal. You've already

pretended to be a Costigan from

South Boston.

BILLY

Every weekend...Sergeant.

DIGNAM

Perfect.

QUEENAN

Do it again. For me.

23.

OTHER PRISONER

You're Bill Costigan?

BILLY

Who wants to know?

OTHER PRISONER

Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L

Street.

BILLY

My cousin.

OTHER PRISONER

Connected but not too bright--

(BILLY looks at him with

an only-I-can-insult-my-

cousin look)

No offense.

24.

SGT. DIGNAM

Sorry I'm late.

ELLERBY

Staff Sergeant Dignam is our

liaison with the undercover

section. Their undercover work is

extensive. He's here to give us his

report. Sgt. Dignam.

SGT. DIGNAM

OK. They're out there, my people.

They're like the fuckin' Indians.

You're not gonna see them. You're

not gonna hear about them except

through me or Captain Queenan. You

will not, ever, know the identity

of undercover people. This shit

hole, unfortunately, has more

fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy.

ELLERBY

Fuck yourself.

SGT. DIGNAM

I'm tired from fucking your wife.

ELLERBY

How's your mother?

SGT. DIGNAM

Good. She's tired from fucking my

father.

(opens a FILE)

OK, today, girls, what I got for

you is microprocessors.

(CONTINUED)

25.

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D)

Somebody, as you may already know,

stole one hundred microprocessors

from the Mass Processor Corp out

Route 128. They're the kind of

processors they put into computers

that can put a cruise missile up

the ass of a camel from the other

side of the planet. That's what

they do out there on "America's

Technology Highway". Worth a

hundred grand apiece. Guy worked

for the company two months walked

out the door with a box of

processors on Tuesday, has a ticket

booked for Florida on Wednesday,

but on Thursday he gets found in a

dumpster. You know where this dirt

ball started his life? Southie

projects.

COLIN

What was his name? The, ah,

departed.

SGT. DIGNAM

Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a

forged UMass transcript. UMass

Boston, which incidentally happens

to be in...

LAZIO

South Boston?

SGT. DIGNAM

Who forged your transcript,

dickhead?

COLIN

I know that guy. His father runs

the Hibernian Liquor Mart.

Kennefick's.

ELLERBY

We are not here to solve the "Case

of the Dead Scumbag". We are here

to nail Costello.

(CONTINUED)

26.

SGT. DIGNAM

We got a guy says that   he hears

Costello is moving the   processors

to China...that he set   up the whole

fuckin' job and popped   Kennefick.

(LAZIO is writing,

lawyerish.)

You don't want to miss   it if

Costello takes a dump.

ELLERBY

We'd miss less if your informants

were available to us, and of course

to the FBI (Bureau)...

LAZIO

Without asking for details, do you

have anyone in with Costello

presently?

SGT. DIGNAM

Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck

yourself. My theory on Feds is

they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em

shit and keep in the dark. You

girls have a nice day.

BILLY'S AUNT

Billy?

BILLY

Aunt Cathy?

BILLY'S AUNT

Good to see you. Good to see you.

(CONTINUED)

27.

BILLY'S AUNT

They said you were in the Staties,

I couldn't believe it.

BILLY

I got kicked out about four months

ago.

SEAN

It was in the papers.

BILLY

Well. So you know.

SEAN

And why are we graced with your

presence?

BILLY

I brought your mother some pictures

of my father.

BILLY (CONT'D)

My mother had them. My mother's

dead.

SEAN

(reflexively)

I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your

troubles.

SEAN (CONT'D)

I was at a funeral myself. Myles

Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat

the fuck out of him seven or eight

times as a matter of fact.

(affably to Billy)

You workin'?

BILLY

No.

28.

SEAN

When did I see you after that?

BILLY

Not for a long time. Down the cape

after Rose's wedding. I think.

SEAN

Fuck, oh shit. I remember that,

dude. I had that fuckin' buck

knife, right, and I cut all the

brass numbas off the doors at the

hotel. I was trippin'...All of

them. That was a night.

BILLY

Listen, I got twenty thousand

dollars when my mother died.

Insurance.

SEAN

Yeah?

BILLY

In your line of work, if I gave you

ten thousand dollars what could you

give me back?

SEAN

My line of work... I'm not in that

line of work just presently because

I don't have ten thousand dollars.

As a matter of fact I have never

had ten thousand dollars.

BILLY

That's what I'm saying.

SEAN

You know what we usually say at

these moments.

(CONTINUED)

29.

BILLY

You fuckin' moron. What are you

talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm

your cousin.

SEAN

Fuckin' Ricans think they know

everything. If they knew shit they

wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

SEAN (CONT'D)

(high as a kite)

Double the money, double the fun.

(confusing his TV jingles)

Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is

for Ricans...P is for pigs...

SEAN (CONT'D)

I can't stop drinkin.

BILLY

Why would you even think of

stopping drinking?

SEAN

He don't like it. He don't like

drinkin...he don't like fightin...

(Sean looks sad)

...he says stay out of the bars...

You know, we're not even supposed

to do this on this side of fuckin'

Worcester.

BILLY

Who says?

SEAN

He says. Costello says. God says,

as far as you're concerned.

30.

SEAN

Not a cop. He got out of the joint

three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks

like his shit don't stink but he's

good people.

VILLAIN

Cunt cop.

MISTER FRENCH

I knew his father. I liked his

uncle Jackie better.

SEAN

Uncle Jackie was excellent.

AN IRISH VILLAIN

Fucking guineas.

BILLY

A cranberry juice.

WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR

It's a natural diuretic. My

girlfriend drinks it when she got

her period.

(to BILLY)

You got your period?

BILLY

Get your hands off me.

MISTER FRENCH

Do you know me?

(CONTINUED)

31.

BILLY

No.

MISTER FRENCH

I'm the guy who tells you there are

guys you hit and there are guys you

don't. That's not quite a guy you

can't hit, but it's almost a guy

you can't hit, so I'm fucking

ruling on it right now that you

don't hit him, understand?

BILLY

Yeah. Excellent. Fine.

MISTER FRENCH

I know you. I know your family.

Also I know you do another drug

deal with your idiot fucking cop-

magnet cousin I'll forget your

grandmother was very nice to me and

cut your fucking nuts off. You

understand that?

BILLY

Yeah.

MISTER FRENCH

Now you know me.

BILLY

Yeah.

MISTER FRENCH

What are you drinking?

BILLY

Cranberry juice.

MISTER FRENCH

What is it, your period?

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)

Get him a cranberry juice.

(CONTINUED)

32.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)

(sotto voce to WELL-

DRESSED SCUMBAG)

That's Jackie's nephew.

WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG

Oh...

MISTER FRENCH

Oh, what?

FRENCH

Get the fuck out of here.

COLIN

Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in

school together. Myles was behind

me in school but I knew him. I will

get those responsible. Don't you

want to see us catch whoever used

him to do a robbery and then killed

him?

MRS KENNEFICK

Allegedly.

COLIN

(grimaces)

"Allegedly".

MRS KENNEFICK

If he was killed he probably did

something wrong.

COLIN

You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs

Kennefick? That's not what you

think he did wrong.

33.

COSTELLO

Wave to your girlfriend.

MRS KENNEFICK

I mean fuck yourself.

COLIN

You get that?

BARRIGAN

"Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"

COLIN

Welcome to the neighborhood.

COSTELLO

Cut 'em here.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Bye, bye.

(CONTINUED)

34.

COLIN

Making a house call?

MADOLYN

Have I seen you professionally?

COLIN

No, no. I know what you do. I know

who you are.

COLIN (CONT'D)

When guys have to "use their

"service revolvers" in the "course

of duty" they get to talk to you

about their "feelings" and whatnot.

COLIN (CONT'D)

No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're

a mental health professional.

MADOLYN

(laughing)

I have an appointment on this

floor.

COLIN

That's good. They're all fuckin'

crazy on that floor.

(points up)

I'm one floor up.

MADOLYN

Oh, fancy policeman.

COLIN

That's right. Fancy.

MADOLYN

Are you a Statie?

(CONTINUED)

35.

COLIN

Yeah, I'm also getting my law

degree.

MADOLYN

Suffolk, nights?

COLIN

They don't run Harvard Law at

night, last time I checked.

MADOLYN

When was the last time you checked?

COLIN

Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

MADOLYN

I went to U Mass. I wasn't

insulting you.

COLIN

Well I thought you were, and for

that you have to take me to dinner.

MADOLYN

Maybe you could shoot someone and

I'd have to see you professionally.

COLIN

Whatever it takes. I'll stab

someone in the heart with an

icepick right now if it gets me

dinner with you.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I don't need a card, I'm a

detective.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I'm only joking. Nice to meet

you... "Madolyn".

(CONTINUED)

36.

COLIN (CONT'D)

(walking, voice low)

I didn't know about your tail until

I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I

had the other guy with me. Blue

sedan and a white delivery van,

fucked up with graffiti on the

side. The van is audio

surveillance. OK, have a nice day.

BILLY

You guys from Providence?

PROPRIETOR

What have you done to my place! Get

out of here.

COLIN

You also do probation work, right?

MADOLYN

That's right. I see "violent

offenders".

COLIN

Bad guys.

MADOLYN

That's one way to look at it.   Not

necessarily.

COLIN

That have this and they don't have

duck l'orange.

MADOLYN

Was your dinner OK?

COLIN

(holding balloon of

inappropriate wine)

Oh, the lobster was excellent. I

just thought, French restaurant...

MADOLYN

I'm waiting for you to make your

move.

COLIN

I don't know what you're gonna do,

but if it moves I'm going to arrest

it (shoot it).

(CONTINUED)

38.

COLIN (CONT'D)

What's it like having people "find

themselves?" All day long people

"finding themselves." Does it get

messy with all those feelings

flying around the room?

MADOLYN

Why, does that make you

uncomfortable?

MADOLYN (CONT'D)

You know what Freud said about the

Irish?

COLIN

Yes I do.

MADOLYN

If you actually do I'll see you

again.

COLIN

Who says I want to see you again?

MADOLYN

(concerned, perhaps

unexpectedly)

Don't you?

COLIN

Yes, course I do.

(a beat)

What Freud said about the Irish is

We're the only people impervious to

psychoanalysis.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Tough luck for you with a client

list of Mick cops, isn't it.

"Opening up"? Good luck to you.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Why do you do it?

(CONTINUED)

39.

MADOLYN

Some people do get better.

COLIN

Fair enough.

MADOLYN

Sometimes, though, I want people to

forget about their personal

bullshit and do their jobs.

COLIN

Including the criminals?

MADOLYN

If they don't do their jobs you

don't have one.

COLIN

Me? I'd just arrest innocent

people. I'll arrest you right now.

MADOLYN

You're trouble.

COLIN

You don't know the half of it.

(CONTINUED)

40.

COSTELLO

Do you know who I am?

BILLY

No.

COSTELLO

You met my friend, Mister French

the other night.

BILLY

Is his real name Mister French?

COSTELLO

No.

(a beat)

Come with me.

(As BILLY hesitates)

I'm not the cops. I'm not askin'

you.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

You know something, they just do

not stop having the Mafia in

Providence, and this can cause

problems for me.

COSTELLO

Those guys you tuned up are

connected down Providence. What

they're going to do is come back up

with some guys and kill you.

Which, sure as you're born, they

will do unless I stop them. Do you

want me to stop them?

BILLY

Is it something I can't do

personally?

(CONTINUED)

41.

COSTELLO

I'm going to have my associate

search you.

BILLY

Search me? Search me for what?

MISTER FRENCH

C'm here.

COSTELLO

Contra-fucking-band.    Take your

fuckin' shoes off.

MISTER FRENCH

Shoes off.

COSTELLO

I knew your father.

BILLY

Yeah. He's dead.

COSTELLO

I'm sorry.     How did he go?

BILLY

He didn't complain.

COSTELLO

That was his problem.

BILLY

Who said he had a fuckin' problem.

COSTELLO

I just said he had a fuckin'

problem. There's a man could have

been anything.

(CONTINUED)

42.

BILLY

Are you saying he was nothing?

COSTELLO

I'm saying he worked at the

airport.

MISTER FRENCH

He's clean.

COSTELLO

The arm.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

(holding Billy by the

collar)

It makes me curious to see you in

this neighborhood. Regressing.

And, if I can slander my own

formative environment, it makes me

sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't

know if it's beyond some cop prick

like fucking Queenan to pull you

out of the Staties, and send you

after me. I just can't know. I

don't know what they do in...that

department, anyway.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Are you still a cop?

BILLY

No.

COSTELLO

You swear on your mother's grave

that you're not a cop.

BILLY

I am not a cop.

(CONTINUED)

43.

COSTELLO

You stop doing coke deals with your

jerk-off cousin?

BILLY

Yes!

COSTELLO

Take it easy. Get your hand taken

care of. I'm sorry. It was

necessary. As for our problem with

Providence...let's not cry over

spilled guineas.

COSTELLO

What's this IRA motherfucker doing

in my bar?

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

(slapping him on the back)

Only kidding. How's your mother?

JIMMY

Ah, she's on her way out.

COSTELLO

We all are.

(straightens suit and tie)

Act accordingly.

COSTELLO

Do you trust him?

MISTER FRENCH

These days, who's reliable?

(CONTINUED)

44.

COSTELLO

His Uncle Jackie was.

MISTER FRENCH

The Costigans are talented in

general.

COSTELLO

You don't trust a guy behaves like

he's got nothin' to lose.

MISTER FRENCH

I'm reliable.

COSTELLO

Well, you're one in a million.

MISTER FRENCH

Ten million.

COSTELLO

What about your wife?

MISTER FRENCH

I thought she was.

COSTELLO

She wasn't.

MISTER FRENCH

She got reliable.

GWEN

Don't you people ever shut the fuck

up?

COSTELLO

"Another county heard from."

MISTER FRENCH

One too many.

45.

COLIN

The principles of detection tell me

that these men came from

Providence.

LYNN DETECTIVE

I'd appreciate it if you got out of

my crime scene.

COLIN

This is my crime scene, but knock

yourself out.

COLIN (CONT'D)

(walking)

I saw a dead guy. I think I have

post traumatic stress. You

available for lunch? See you then.

COSTELLO

Who's the lead detective?...Good,

he's a moron.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

I want you to get the cops to look

at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of

course he had nothing to do with it

and will say so. You look in

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

46.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

his car...and find...the gun that

did it.

COLIN

In the trunk or the glove box?...

All right.

COLIN

Wanna see some dead guys?

COSTELLO

Have a seat, Billy.

BILLY

Thank you.

COSTELLO

(he looks up)

You know John Lennon?

BILLY

Yeah, he was president before

Lincoln.

COSTELLO

(smiles)

Lennon said `I'm an artist. You

give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get

you something out of it'.

BILLY

I'd like to squeeze some fuckin'

money out of it.

COSTELLO

Smart mouth. Too bad.

47.

COSTELLO

The point with John Lennon is a man

can look at anything and make

something out of it. For instance,

I look at you and I think what can

I use you for?

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

(giving the hand to Mister

French)

Get rid of this.

(back to Billy)

Maybe we can work something out.

Let me get dressed.

DIGNAM

That was quick. He dead already?

(CONTINUED)

48.

COLIN

This will get Captain Ellerby on

the six o'clock news.

BARRIGAN

No wonder you get ahead.

BILLY

I won't do it if I have to wear a

wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you

understand me? You don't know what

this is like.

(listens)

Micro what?

QUEENAN

Microprocessors. We'll probably be

at war with the Chinese in twenty-

odd years and Costello is selling

them military technology.

Microprocessors, chips, computer

parts. Anybody says anything about

anything like that, you let us

know.

REPORTER

Did you have a tip from an

informant?

ELLERBY

No, it was tireless police activity

that ah effected ah the arrest of

the ah alleged perpetrator.

(CONTINUED)

49.

COLIN

I've been put in charge of this

unit. It is a small surveillance

sub-unit but it is mine. And I

didn't take this job in order to

fuck it up, or to let anyone else

fuck it up, whosoever they may be.

I hand picked this group. You are

my A-team so I want you to conduct

yourselves accordingly.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Hi, Captain. And our primary

target is obviously Frank Costello.

But we don't communicate with

anyone else in this shop. Queenan

is compartmentalizing everything in

SIU. It's the right thing to do,

personally I don't trust these

fucking troopers either. We think

we might have a problem. We think

Costello's got a rat in the State

Police.

BROWN

Really?

COLIN

Yeah.   Really.

BROWN

Do we have direct access to

Queenan's undercovers?

COLIN

(not happy about this)

No. Ah...not presently. Not

presently. But I'm hoping to get

things...reorganized. That's it.

Congratulations. Don't disappoint

me.

BARRIGAN

(to Brown)

I know why I'm here. I made him

feel guilty. Why are you here?

(CONTINUED)

50.

BROWN

Intelligence and aptitude.

BARRIGAN

That's new.

COLIN

Hello Dad. I have a new job.

(ALT: I got a promotion.)

MISTER FRENCH

Where's your fucking license? I

don't see no fucking license.

BOOKIE

What license.

MISTER FRENCH

There's no such thing as a license,

of course, but you definitely have

to have one.

(grabs the bookie by the

ear)

If you are not being run by us you

will be run by someone else, which

means you will have let undesirable

elements into Mr. Costello's area.

HARD GUY

(spitting teeth)

I was going for my fucking

cigarettes...

MISTER FRENCH

Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the

fuck you doin'?

(CONTINUED)

51.

BILLY

What the fuck. I didn't know....

BOOKIE

There's no profit if I pay him two

grand a week. I'm in the hole if I

pay him two grand a week.

MISTER FRENCH

Then make more money or go out of

business. This is America. If you

don't make money you're a fucking

douchebag. What are you going to

do?

BOOKIE

Make more money.

MISTER FRENCH

That's the spirit.

MISTER FRENCH

Very interesting.

BILLY

Yeah, well. Fuck.

MISTER FRENCH

Don't worry about it. Guy didn't

need need his teeth anyway. Maybe

if he was an Eskimo. But in this

country we eat a variety of items.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)

He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.

COSTELLO

So?

BILLY

He was...

(CONTINUED)

52.

MISTER FRENCH

Reaching for his cigarettes.

BILLY

Okay! You gonna give me shit, it

wasn't no reason----he put his hand

in his coat! I don't know if he's a

bookie or what the fuck he's

doing...

COSTELLO

(interrupting)

Well, you know what the fuck a

bookie does?

BILLY

(to Costello)

Pays you.

COSTELLO

Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who

goes around knocking guys teeth out

for no reason.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Here. From now on call the bar and

ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask

for Mikey because there's no Mikey.

Wait. We'll call.

MISTER FRENCH

Forty-eight hours from the time

this phone first rings, you take

the fucking chip out - like so -

and you fucking destroy it. After

three days a phone ain't clean. If

you use a phone which is not clean,

you will have a accident. You never

call us. We call you. You got that?

BILLY

I got it.

MISTER FRENCH

I can't fuckin' hear you.

BILLY

I got it.

53.

BILLY

Don't look. There's a white van

across the parking lot?

COSTELLO

(lifting and looking at

his sketch)

They don't have directional

microphones.

BILLY

What, do you got x-ray vision?

COSTELLO

(not taking his eyes off

his sketch)

They don't have directional

microphones.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

People looking at you make you self-

conscious?

BILLY

I don't know.

COSTELLO

Why? They're minuses. They can't

tell the difference between a rock

star and a career criminal.

BILLY

Anyone not a criminal is a minus?

(CONTINUED)

54.

COSTELLO

What are you soft? That's not what

I said. Eat something, Jesus

Christ, we got a nice day by the

water. Sun's shining, gulls are

up...Nice smell of ozone...

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

You know if your father were alive

and saw you, sitting here with me,

let's say he would have a word with

me about this, in fact, he'd kill

seven guys just to cut my throat.

And he could do it, which is

something you may not know about

William Costigan, Sr.

BILLY

He never, ah, I mean never?

COSTELLO

He kept his own counsel. He never

wanted money. You can't do a thing

with a man like that. Your uncle

Jackie needed a lot of money. But

even though he got his money from

me, he also would kill my entire

fucking family if he saw me here

with you. And I think about this.

BILLY

So what are talking about here?

COSTELLO

Fact is you're not a guy fresh from

the zoo who wants to run a spring

water distributor and I don't see

you up the dog track as a general

manager.

BILLY

Look at it this way. It's like a

tuba. I want to see if I can get

something out of it.

(CONTINUED)

55.

COSTELLO

You ever think of going back to

school?

BILLY

With all due respect, Mr. Costello,

school's out.

COSTELLO

Well that's your problem. Maybe

someday you'll wake the fuck up.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Good day, Fathers.

PRIESTS

(terrified and

simultaneously)

Good morning [day], Francis, good

morning.

COSTELLO

You recall our chat?

(the OLDER PRIEST nods,

terrified)

"I am as God made me", was that

what you said? May I remind you,

God don't run the bingo in this

archdiocese.

YOUNG PRIEST

May I remind you, Mr. Costello,

that pride comes before the fall.

COSTELLO

What comes before the Fall is the

Summertime.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

How is Sister Mary Theresa doing?

We had a tasty relationship before

she took her vows. Enjoy your

clams, cocksuckers.

56.

COLIN

I'm not making enough progress with

Costello?

ELLERBY

"Progress" is hard to define. I

make progress every day. In fact,

I'm making progress now. There are

guys in this department make

excellent progress for twenty years

without ever getting anything you

could definitively call a result.

It's like any American industry.

Nobody minds if you don't succeed

as long as you don't fuck up.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Objectives get lost sight of: fair

enough. Who did the two guys from

Providence?

COLIN

Jimmy Pappas.

ELLERBY

And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?

COLIN

He had a heart attack in jail and

got knifed in his bed at Boston

City Hospital. I believe it's been

in the papers.

(CONTINUED)

57.

ELLERBY

Are you happy with this result?

COLIN

It's a result.

ELLERBY

Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.

COLIN

Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on

it.

ELLERBY

(with true appreciation)

I think you are a cop, my son.

BRIAN

No, please...

FRENCH

Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt

you.

(CONTINUED)

58.

FRENCH (CONT'D)

Wake the fuck up.

QUEENAN

Hey.   Let's go through the routine.

DIGNAM

You think you can pop someone.

There's no special card to play.

The guy whose jaw you broke was

Boston Police Department.

BILLY

I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be

someone else every day.

DIGNAM

Most of the people in the world do

it every day. What's the big deal?

BILLY

I'm not them.

DIGNAM

You're nobody. You signed the

paper. We're the only people in

the world who know that you're a

cop. Maybe we'll just erase your

file.

(CONTINUED)

59.

DIGNAM (CONT'D)

And zip, you're a soldier for

Costello, open to arrest for how

many felonies? Maybe we'll do

that.

BILLY

Maybe I'll fucking kill you.

QUEENAN

Easy now.    That was a joke, Billy.

DIGNAM

Just because you play a fucking

tough guy doesn't mean you are one,

you lace curtain fucking pussy.

QUEENAN

(gently, like a man

calming a wild animal)

Be smart. If someone was watching

how are we supposed to not arrest

you?

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

Get in the car.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

Keep your act together. It's just a

little while longer.

BILLY

When are you going to take

Costello? What's wrong with taking

'em on any one of the million

felonies you've seen him do. Get

him for pissing in the street.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

60.

BILLY (CONT'D)

What, are you waiting for him to

chop me up and feed me to the poor?

DIGNAM

Well. That would stick...

QUEENAN

You shut up. We're building a

case. It takes time. You know that.

BILLY

There's something wrong.

QUEENAN

Maybe. Maybe.

DIGNAM

Keep your ears opened.   No

bullshit.

QUEENAN

I want you to listen for any

chatter about a spy in the Special

Investigation Unit.

(BILLY looks at him)

You hear anything like that?

BILLY

Are you serious?

QUEENAN

I'm afraid so.

BILLY

Jesus H. Christ.

QUEENAN

Hang tight for me. Just a little

longer. We're this close.

BILLY

Okay.

QUEENAN

Thank you, Billy

61.

COLIN

(to Brown)

What have you got?

BROWN

Uniform clipped him on the Pike for

a suspended licence. However, as

he's the subject of an open

investigation----

COLIN

At least one. He's one of

Costello's crew.

BROWN

----we're entitled to get a warrant.

We can't get an address off him.

He paged his lawyer but the lawyer

hasn't called back yet.

COLIN

Who's the lawyer?

BROWN

He didn't know the name. He just

had the number on a card. Beeper

number.

COLIN

Did he beep him?

BROWN

Twice.

COLIN

All right.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Give me your phone.

(to Barrigan)

Turn the camera off. Turn it off.

(CONTINUED)

62.

BROWN

What?

COLIN

Give my your phone and turn the

fucking camera off. Who's is this?

I'm gonna take this.

BROWN

He can't do that, can he?

BARRIGAN

He just did.

COLIN

Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.

FITZY

You my attorney?

COLIN

What do you think? Did you make

any statements or phone calls I

need to be aware of?

FITZY

I beeped you. The card they gave

me...that's it.

COLIN

That's it? Don't you have to call

your mother and tell her you're not

gonna be home for supper?

(CONTINUED)

63.

COLIN (CONT'D)

The cameras are off.

(gently puts phone on the

table)

Call your mother.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Lookit. They're in there suiting

up for a raid. I don't know where

they are going, but they do. And

so do you. Call your mum.

FITZY

Mum, I'm not gonna make it for

supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk

to you later.

MISTER FRENCH

Everybody out. Move.

FITZY

Who are you? When do I get out of

here?

(CONTINUED)

64.

COLIN

I think you need another attorney,

after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a

nice day.

COLIN

Run the last number called. That'll

be his house. Whatever the location

is I'll swear I surveilled him at

it. Abracafuckindabra.

BROWN

Why'd you use my phone?

COLIN

Because you didn't go in there.

MADOLYN

The light's nice here in the

morning.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)

It's all right. Guys tend to make

a big deal out of it. It's

actually quite common.

COLIN

I gotta go to work.

BILLY

It's like confession. Isn't it.

This sort of thing.

(CONTINUED)

65.

BILLY (CONT'D)

People make things up in

confession. You know that?

MADOLYN

I know they do.

BILLY

People are liars. They want to be

stars of their little films.

MADOLYN

That's an interesting observation.

BILLY

Do you lie?

MADOLYN

Why do you?

BILLY

I'm asking if you lie.

MADOLYN

Honesty isn't synonymous with

truth.

BILLY

You lie. So, is it to do some good,

to get somewhere personally, or

just for the fuck of it?

MADOLYN

I expect sometimes...people...do it

to keep things...on an even keel.

BILLY

So, you had a parent who was a

drunk?

MADOLYN

(flustered)

Did you?

BILLY

(simply)

No.

(CONTINUED)

66.

MADOLYN

Let's keep this with you.

BILLY

(abruptly)

There was a cop leaving when I came

in.

MADOLYN

How do you know he was a cop?

BILLY

Bad haircut, no dress sense and a

slight air of scumbag entitlement.

You see cops?

MADOLYN

That's part of what I do. Although,

I don't normally see cadets who

were kicked out of the Academy.

BILLY

You should get a better job...

BILLY (CONT'D)

Do they all come in and cry...your

cops?

MADOLYN

Sometimes they cry if they had

trouble at home or if they've had

to...use their weapons.

BILLY

Let me tell you something. They

signed up to use their fuckin'

weapons. Most of them. But they

watch enough TV so they know they

have to "weep" after they use their

weapons. No one's more full of shit

than a cop. Except a cop on TV.

MADOLYN

I looked through your file and I

see you have a record of assault.

What was it like for you in jail?

BILLY

You want to hear about the showers?

MADOLYN

Did something happen to you?

(CONTINUED)

67.

BILLY

No.

(a beat)

You sit there with a mass murderer,

your heart-rate jacked, your

hand...steady. That's one thing I

found out about myself in prison.

My hand doesn't shake, ever.

MADOLYN

What do you expect from coming

here?

BILLY

I have to come here.

MADOLYN

I know it's not elective...on your

part...but, now that you're here,

what do you want?

BILLY

You want the truth?

(a beat)

Valium.

MADOLYN

If you lied, you'd have an easier

time getting what you wanted.

BILLY

What's that say about what you do

for a living?

MADOLYN

Look, I think we better have a few

more meetings before we can even

talk about prescriptions.

BILLY

I'm having panic attacks. You

didn't even ask about that. Last

night I thought I was having a

fucking heart attack. I puked in a

trash barrel on the way in here, I

haven't slept for weeks.

(CONTINUED)

68.

MADOLYN

Is this true?

BILLY

Yes. I said something true. I want

some fucking pills and you close my

file? I thought I was supposed to

tell the truth here.

MADOLYN

Yes, you are.

BILLY

If only fuckin' here.

BILLY (CONT'D)

(giving into stress)

Guy comes in in pain, against every

instinct of ...privacy, of, of,

self reliance... that he has, and

you don't help him? You send him

off to score smack on the fucking

street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs.

Fuckin' Doctor?)

BILLY (CONT'D)

Two pills.

BILLY (CONT'D)

Why don't you just give me a bottle

of scotch and a handgun to blow my

fucking head off. Are we done here

with this psychiatry bullshit?

MADOLYN

You can leave!

BILLY

What if that was a legitimate

threat? (Hot shot).

(CONTINUED)

69.

MADOLYN

Fuck...

MADOLYN

Why is the hardest patient of the

day always the last one?

BILLY

Because you're bored and tired and

don't give a shit. It's not

supernatural.

MADOLYN

Look, I'm not just...somebody you

have to see or they put you in

jail. If you are in distress I will

help you.

BILLY

What's this?

MADOLYN

My card. And a prescription for

twenty Lorazepam.

BILLY

Is it enough to kill myself?

MADOLYN

(she fixes him with a

stare)

Maybe it is. All right? Have I done

my job up to your goddamned

standards? Because by my standards

you fit the model of drug-seeking

behavior, and fuck you if you don't

like my initial clinical reaction.

BILLY

(re: prescription)

Thank you.

(CONTINUED)

70.

MADOLYN

I'm transferring you to another

counselor.

BILLY

You wanna get a cup of coffee?

ELLERBY

All right, let's bring it in,

please. Come in please.

(addressing room)

Our target is a major transaction

of microprocessors. Yes, those. I

don't know what they are. You

don't know what they are. Who

gives a fuck? Cash will be handed

over in a building which we have

under AV surveillance. Staff

Sergeant Sullivan's team...

(he nods at COLIN)

Will ID the bad guys and listen in

on the phones.

COLIN

(to his guys)

Did you guys know anything about

this?

ELLERBY

(to LAZIO)

How long have we been tapped on

this building?

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Our unit will not take action until

a man Captain Queenan has inside

the operation has verified the

transaction. Questions? Anyone?

This is who we're after.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

We've been after this cocksucker

for a long time, and tonight we're

gonna get him. Get to work.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

We've been after this son of a

bitch for a long time, and we're

getting him tonight. Get to work.

COLIN

(to team)

Go find out what we're doing and

get on it.

ELLERBY

Sorry to get you at the last

minute. But things leak. This lead

came from Queenan's undercover guy.

COLIN

(into cell)

Dad?

COSTELLO (O.S.)

(on phone)

Yes?

COLIN

I'm not going to make dinner.

Something big has come up.

COSTELLO

Too bad. Your mother worked all

goddamned day. We'll just have to

sit down without you and your

friends.

72.

COLIN

Oh, my friends are still coming.

COLIN (CONT'D)

We'll just say lunch tomorrow.   All

right, bye.

QUEENAN

The readiness is all. You know the

players, call the game.

COLIN

Thank you, Captain.

GEEK COP

Piece of cake. I'll operate the

cameras. You ID the guys and log

them.

QUEENAN

All cellphone signals are under

surveillance through the courtesy

of our Federal friends over

there...

ELLERBY

(as if on coke and he

probably is)

Patriot Act. Love it. Love it.

(CONTINUED)

73.

COLIN

All right. That's Costello right

there. Costello, Mister French,

Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the

new guy...Time is 10.46.

BROWN

Who are they meeting?

ELLERBY

(leaning over screens)

I don't know. Some Chinamen from

points unknown. They're already

inside.

CAMERA GEEK COP

We have a blind spot.

ELLERBY

Why do you have a blind spot?

CAMERA GEEK COP

We had two hour's notice. Two

hours. What the fuck you think this

is, NASA?

ELLERBY

It never crossed my mind. You get a

camera in the back?

(CONTINUED)

74.

TECH COP IN DOWN VEST

What back?

COSTELLO

Turn off your cell phones.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Check your weapons...Fitzy has the

chicken...

CAMERA COP

(to no one, and maybe OS)

Maybe if we had some Homeland

security money like some other

fucking douchebags I could

mention...

QUEENAN

Any calls?

PHONE TECH COP

They turned off their phones.

ELLERBY

Search randomly for calls made from

the area.

(CONTINUED)

75.

PHONE TECH COP

Eight hundred seven phones are live

in this area.

ELLERBY

Narrow the area.

LAZIO

What you see for coverage is what

you get.

DIGNAM

(like Queenan, an observer

of Ellerby's operation)

Why the fuck did they turn off

their phones?

PHONE TECH COP

Wait, there's still one phone up.

DIGNAM

Where?

QUEENAN

The buyers are there.

ELLERBY

You know, direct access to your

fucking guys would have certain

fuckin' advantages.

QUEENAN

(mildly)

Not to my guy.

DIGNAM

This is unbelievable.

(looking at screens)

Fuck it, who put the cameras in the

fucking place?

(CONTINUED)

76.

CAMERA TECH COP

Who the fuck are you.

DIGNAM

I'm the guy who does his job. You

must be the other guy.

QUEENAN

Hey, hey, hey...

COSTELLO

(to translator)

How you going, Robert?

CHINESE TRANSLATOR

Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to tell

you that at least two of these

gents have machine guns.

CHINESE GANGSTER

(in Cantonese, not

subtitled)

Waiting, waiting. We almost

departed! This man is from the

Embassy. He will have to blow his

brains out if he is captured. His

entire family will be killed.

CHINESE TRANSLATOR

He's a little upset.

COSTELLO

Tell him light on the starch.

(CONTINUED)

77.

CHINESE TRANSLATOR

(roughly translating)

He's fronting the Chinese

government and he's just scared

shitless.

COSTELLO

Government man.

(loudly, to Chinese)

I'm concerned about Chinamen who

think it's wise to bring automatic

weapons to a business transaction.

CHINESE GANGSTER

Ngup, Ngup, Ngup. Ngaw um ming.

Kay ngup mutt. [Yap, yap, yap. I

don't understand. What is he

saying?]

COSTELLO

For his own good, tell Bruce Lee

and the Karate Kids none of us are

carrying automatic weapons because

here, in this country, it don't add

inches to your dick. You get a

life sentence for it.

CHINESE GANGSTER

(in Cantonese)

Put away that machine gun.

(CONTINUED)

78.

COSTELLO

If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan

any time in this century, you tell

them they better shape up fast and

show me one million dollars.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

What we generally do in this

country is one guy shows up with

the items, and the other guy pays

him. No tickee...no laundry.

CHINESE GANGSTER

Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon.

[Make sure it's real. It's a

million dollars.]. ALTERNATE/ALSO

(insult): Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw

dong maw gok nay chun. [Next time

you make me wait, I'm going to cut

your dick off.

COSTELLO

In English, thank you, also.

CHINESE GANGSTER

Du ne. [Fuck you.]

COSTELLO

The expedition continues this way.

79.

ELLERBY

Don't tell me those cars were

empty. Please don't tell me those

Chinamen's cars were empty.

(to Camera Tech Cop)

Do you have a camera in the back.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Can I talk to you a minute?

COSTELLO

See, no surveillance here. They

didn't figure we had a navy.

Always figure an exit for your

business partners. What with

everything all dug up, you can't

trust a slant to find the Mass Pike

and, with or without Staties out

front, frankly I don't approve of

orientals driving to begin with.

BILLY

What about us, Frank?   What're we

gonna do?

COSTELLO

We depart. We didn't commit no

illegalities.

MISTER FRENCH

Except sell the ching chongs a

bunch of fuckin' plastic.

(CONTINUED)

80.

MADOLYN

Good Morning.

COLIN

Good morning.

MADOLYN

I beat the movers.

COLIN

How was the last night in the, ah,

old establishment?

MADOLYN

(putting the box on the kitchen

counter)

Lonely.

COLIN

I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked

here, too.

MADOLYN

I'm gonna thank your Uncle

Alphonsus for the square footage.

COLIN

Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So

am I.

(CONTINUED)

81.

MADOLYN

French donut?

COLIN

(re: box of stuff)

Yeah. Hey, can I...

MADOLYN

Sure yeah.

COLIN

Well, we're not having this out.

MADOLYN

What?

COLIN

You don't see any pictures of where

I came from. Look, I respect who

you are, but not in the living

room. We might have company.

MADOLYN

Company?

COLIN

Why work for the state?

MADOLYN

Why not?   You do.

COLIN

Not forever, and you don't have to.

You've got degrees...you're a hot

shit... I mean, what you do, why

make as much as a guidance

counselor?

(CONTINUED)

82.

MADOLYN

(deadpan, over her coffee

cup)

I believe in public service.

COLIN

Now you're just being ridiculous.

MADOLYN

(kissing him, and

intently:)

You like me living here?

COLIN

(hands down her shorts)

Yes I do.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Answer it.     You live here.

MADOLYN

Mayor Sullivan's Office.

MADOLYN (CONT'D)

(whispering)

I'm sorry!

COLIN

Who is it?

MADOLYN

I think it's a guy with a, ah,

(She touches her throat,

and whispers)

A cancer guy.

COLIN

Hello?

(CONTINUED)

83.

COLIN (CONT'D)

(to Madolyn)

Something for work.

COSTELLO (V.O.)

What the fuck is it with your

phone?

COLIN

Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have

any power, that's all. It just

happened once.

COSTELLO

Was that that shrink cunt answered

the phone?

COLIN

Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna

move in, so she moved in.

COSTELLO

You better get organized, quick.

COLIN

Last time I checked, I tipped you

off and you're not in jail.

COSTELLO

Are you listening to me?

COLIN

Yes.

(CONTINUED)

84.

COSTELLO

Are listening to me, son? Do you

like Little Miss Thing sucking your

cock?

COLIN

Yes. Yes I do.

COSTELLO

So earn it.

(a beat)

I'm gettin' the feeling we got a

cop in my crew.

COLIN

I been gettin' that same feeling.

COSTELLO

He's one of yours. Inside. Have you

seen anything?

COLIN

Look, I have no access to

undercover files in Queenan's

department. It's locked up. Queenan

and Dignam run the snitches. They

don't give anybody a peep. I'm

doing the best...

COSTELLO

(interrupting)

Your best? What do you think

we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery

business?

COLIN

Please Frank, if you don't relax I

can't relax. Let's start with

this...get me all the information

on the people around you last

night. Everyone that works for you.

Get me real first names. Get me...

(CONTINUED)

85.

COSTELLO

(interrupting Colin)

Get you? Give you? Who the fuck

do you work for?

COLIN

Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you

please get me social security

numbers, ah, I need drivers license

numbers, full names, dates of

birth, anything like that. Bank

account numbers, everything that

you don't get from a criminal

record or, or a wrap sheet or a...

COSTELLO

(relenting a little)

Collie, calm down or you'll shoot

in your pants. I'll get you the

records and whatnot. You'll have

'em but listen to me son, don't

disappoint me on this, or some

other guy will be putting their

cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.

QUEENAN

How are you, Francis?

COSTELLO

My mother called me Francis.

QUEENAN

I know she did. And your father

called you the tumor.

COSTELLO

Oh, what did your father call you,

Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he

wasn't around.

QUEENAN

Where are the real microprocessors,

Frank?

(CONTINUED)

86.

COSTELLO

Microprocessors...oh yeah, I heard

that story. You arrested some

Chinese government guy at the

border carrying some light sockets

or somethin'.

DIGNAM

I can't wait to wipe that fuckin'

smirk off your face.

COSTELLO

(to Dignam)

Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for

me?

QUEENAN

I will get you, Frank.

COSTELLO

If you could've you would've but I

guess you like to go at your own

pace.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Excuse me, I've got a date with

some angels.

QUEENAN

Sooner than you think, Francis.

COLIN

What?

MADOLYN

You have a boss that has a

laryngectomy?

COLIN

No, no, no. That was a guy who

works for me.

(CONTINUED)

87.

MADOLYN

You're lying to me.

COLIN

Not exactly.

(the charming Colin:)

There are certain things I will not

be able to talk to you about. I

cannot allow you to jeopardize an

ongoing investigation. (Or your

own life.)

(more seriously, after a

long beat)

There really are things connected

to my job that you can't ask about.

That you don't want to know about.

MADOLYN

(after a beat)

Okay, then say that.

COLIN

I will.    Thank you.

MADOLYN

That's the movers.

COLIN

You still wanna stay?

MADOLYN

I do.

COLIN

(re: doorbell)

All right. All right.       I'm coming.

(CONTINUED)

88.

BILLY (O.S.)

I'm gonna get on a plane unless you

put Queenan on the phone.

DIGNAM

Queenan had a funeral to go to.

This is my shift. Calm down.

BILLY

Why shouldn't I get on a fucking

plane? Meet up? Do you actually

want me dead? There's a rat in

your unit. That's a fact. You just

don't know it. Where's Queenan?

DIGNAM

He's not here.

BILLY

They knew you had cameras in the

building. You have a leak from the

inside. It's real. Smoke him out.

DIGNAM

And how do we do that Mr... fucking

genius who didn't even graduate the

academy?

BILLY

Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that

you're getting a sealed wiretap

warrant for Costello's apartment.

Don't tell anyone in our department

but tell SIU. Flush it and see if

it comes out of the pipe on my end.

That's first. Narrow it down.

Where's Queenan.

DIGNAM

Are you deaf? He's not here. Call

me when you get something real.

(CONTINUED)

89.

BILLY

It's me.

MADOLYN

I'm assuming you want to change

things, you know, change the people

you know, change the people you

meet, change everything, anything.

Too many choices can see like no

choice at all...

BILLY

Confucius say that?

MADOLYN

So you do...something radical.

BILLY

"Something radical," huh?

MADOLYN

...yeah, you do... Sometimes it's

just a matter of picking a thing

and doing it...

BILLY

So how long you been with this guy?

MADOLYN

Oh, four months. About four months.

BILLY

You love this guy?

MADOLYN

It's pretty serious, yeah, it is.

BILLY

A head case or anything?    I'm just

curious...

MADOLYN

No more than I am.

(CONTINUED)

90.

BILLY

Then you're lucky.   Considering the

odds, right?

BILLY (CONT'D)

Good, give him a shot.

MADOLYN

Doctors aren't supposed to have

illusions.

BILLY

Yeah, that's because of vastly

superior intelligence. Godlike,

really.

MADOLYN

OK, I'm in a serious, newly

serious, relationship...there

are...ups and downs...everybody has

doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.

BILLY

What would you do if he was

standing right there and saw us?

MADOLYN

I'd lie. To keep things on an even

keel. You know all about it.

(CONTINUED)

91.

BILLY

You take off an armored car at the

Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do

you pay guineas in Providence?

BANKROBBER

Fucking now I do.

BILLY

What the fuck do you do.

BANKROBBER

What, I pay Costello and wait for

him to trade me to the FBI? Cause

that's what he does.

BILLY

FBI? What the fuck are you talking

about.

BANKROBBER

Oh my God, is that French out

there?

BILLY

(grabbing him by the

shirt)

What the fuck did you just say

about the FBI?

BANKROBBER

Forget what I said. I'm fucking

high, I'm high.

BILLY

Whatever's going through your very

poor, very limited, brain...I'm not

going to hurt you. Just tell me

what you just fucking said.

(CONTINUED)

92.

BANKROBBER

Forget it, I'm high, I must be

high, I would never say what you

thought I said.

BILLY

Tell me what the fuck you said.

BANKROBBER

(covered with blood)

Why do you think he's not arrested?

Costello's a protected FBI

informant. He'll trade you out.

(a beat)

I thought I was supposed to go into

shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking

hurts. It fucking hurts.

BILLY

Let's go.

93.

BILLY

Hey, it's me.

QUEENAN

What do you want? What are you

doing here?

BILLY

Come here.

BILLY (CONT'D)

Costello is giving people up to the

FBI.

QUEENAN

The FBI?

BILLY

He gives information to the FBI.

He's a protected informant. Aren't

they trying to make it a Federal

case? And it never gets made?

QUEENAN

(realizing he has to be

very careful)

Go around the back. Go around the

back.

QUEENAN

My wife's asleep. She left supper

out. Come and have something to

eat.

(CONTINUED)

94.

BILLY

No, I...

QUEENAN

We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and

have something to eat.

ELLERBY

Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy

like you since me. You'll be

transferred to Internal

Investigations but you will

continue to work right where you

are in the Special Investigation

Unit.

COLIN

I don't get it.

ELLERBY

We are all convinced that Costello

has at least one mole in the

Special Investigation Unit.

COLIN

Right.

ELLERBY

You'll investigate. Everybody.

Anybody.

COLIN

Well, that's just a dream job for a

cop.

ELLERBY

We have considered all possible

candidates. You have an immaculate

record. Some people never trust a

guy with an immaculate record. I

do.

(a beat)

I have an immaculate record.

(CONTINUED)

95.

ELLERBY (CONT'D)

Play golf?

COLIN

No.

ELLERBY

That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as

a game but you get to form

relationships.

(a beat)

How's the wedding coming along?

COLIN

Everything's great. On schedule.

She's a doctor.

ELLERBY

Outstanding. That's good. Marriage

is an important part of getting

ahead. You don't want anyone

thinking you're a homo. Married guy

seems stable. People look at a

wedding ring and think: someone can

stand the son of a bitch. Ladies

see the wedding ring and know

immediately that you must have some

cash and that your cock works.

COLIN

Oh, it's working. Overtime.

ELLERBY

I'm glad to hear that.

MISTER FRENCH

BILLY

I don't have a bank account.

MISTER FRENCH

BILLY

What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

MISTER FRENCH

You fill in the papers, real name,

all your numbers, no fucking

around, and then we all wait here.

MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)

No, I ain't.

DELAHUNT

Put the forms in there.

I don't know if this is how you

Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot

you.

COSTELLO

You're not indulging in self abuse

COLIN

Frank, we got problems.

COSTELLO

I hope you're not turning into one

of those sob sisters, who wants to

get caught. You're not crackin' up

are you?

COLIN

I don't crack up.

COSTELLO

Pick a place where any cop could

see you...

COLIN

Why did you show up then?

COSTELLO

I own the place.

COLIN

Why am I not fuckin' surprised.

Look...

COSTELLO

You're gettin' reassigned.

COLIN

How the fuck did you know that?

COSTELLO

Where'd they put you?

COLIN

I have to find myself.

(CONTINUED)

99.

COSTELLO

You're telling me, sonny boy.

COLIN

I have to find the guy you have in

the department.

COSTELLO

With everybody looking up their own

ass and you looking for yourself, I

put my money on nobody finding

nothing.

COLIN

Frank, for me, you've got to lay

low.

COSTELLO

Laying low is not what I do.

COLIN

Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank.

Lookit, Frank, what good am I to

you if you don't listen to me?

Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's

fuckin' smart, you know that. I

will find this rat if you let me do

it my way. If you let me do my job.

COSTELLO

Okay.

(gives him the envelope)

But Colin, I hope I won't have to

remind you, that if you don't find

that cheese eating rat bastard in

your department so we can give him

a halo, most likely it won't be me

who pays for it.

COLIN

Why would you need to remind me of

that? I didn't know that would I

be any good at what I do? Trust

me, I know how to do this.

COLIN (CONT'D)

It involves lying, and I'm pretty

fucking good at that, right?

BILLY

Medium.

MADOLYN

Are you okay? Why are you here?

BILLY

I really liked our conversations.

BILLY

Move in with your boyfriend?

MADOLYN

Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise

COSTELLO

No.   No.   What does that matter?

COSTELLO

Depends. I'm sure you know by now

there's an informer in my crew.

Cop. Staties or Boston Police

department, I'm not sure.

BILLY

What about the FBI.

COSTELLO

It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife,

an old friend or stupid...that's

what brings you down in this

business.

BILLY

Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.

COSTELLO

Past days, case like this...I

killed everybody who works for me.

BILLY

Better safe than sorry, I suppose.

COSTELLO

On the other hand, back then, it

was only five...or six...and

French.

BILLY

I look around at your guys.

They're all murderers right? I

think "could I do murder?" And all

I can answer myself is, "what's the

difference".

COSTELLO

Give em up to the Almighty.   Like

that.

BILLY

Yeah, that's my point. You accuse

me once, I put up with it. You

accuse me twice, I quit. If you

make me fear for my life, I put a

fucking bullet in your head as if

you were anybody else.

COSTELLO

(to Billy)

You got something you want to say

to me, William?

BILLY

You're seventy fucking years old.

One of these guys is going to pop

you. As for running drugs, what the

fuck. You don't need the pain in

the ass, and they're going to catch

you. And you don't need the money.

COSTELLO

I haven't needed "the money" since

I took Archie's milk money in the

third grade. Tell the truth, I

don't need pussy any more,but I

still like it.

Why don't you stay in the bar when

I get the numbers. Your numbers.

Everybody's numbers.

BILLY

Is there something you want to ask

me, Frank?

COSTELLO

Start with, you agree there is a

rat?

BILLY

You said there is one. I base most

of what I do on the idea that

you're pretty fucking good at what

you do.

COSTELLO

Sure, sure, all that aside...but

you Bill, what would you do?

BILLY

How many of these guys been with

you long enough to be disgruntled?

Who needs more money than you pay

them? You don't pay much, you know.

It's almost a feudal fuckin'

enterprise.

(COSTELLO nods, accepting

this)

The question is, who thinks that

they would do what you do better

than you?

COSTELLO

Only one that can do what I do is

me. You want to be me?

BILLY

I probably could be you. I know

that much. But I don't want to be

It ain't Bill. No way, he says.

Thank God for Billy.

COLIN

Morning.

COLIN (CONT'D)

A problem?

DIGNAM

Yeah, I run rat fucks like you.   I

don't like them.

COLIN

The day you wouldn't take a

promotion, you let me know. And I

wouldn't even have a job if you did

yours.

DIGNAM

Fuck yourself.

COLIN

I need to know the identity of your

undercovers.

DIGNAM

Blow me. Not literally, there's no

promotion in it for ya.

110.

COLIN

Morning, Captain.

QUEENAN

Look who's here. The Queen of the

prom.

COLIN

They are not happy with me.

Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.

QUEENAN

What do you expect? Everybody

knows you're assigned here to find

Costello's rat. They want to find

the leak as much as you do. What

they do not want is to be accused

of being the rat.

COLIN

Fair enough. Well one of them has

to be dirty, We know that, right?

QUEENAN

Two days ago, my undercover guy in

Costello's organization----

COLIN

Who is that?

QUEENAN

Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You

can go over my head, high as you

like. You still won't get an

answer.

COLIN

Fair enough.

QUEENAN

As I said, two days ago, my guy

nearly found out who Costello's rat

is. He lost him in the street.

(CONTINUED)

111.

COLIN

Really?   Did he get a look at him?

QUEENAN

...No.

COLIN

Nothing that could help us?

QUEENAN

Nah.

COLIN

(swallows)

(Too bad.) Any advice?   Generally?

QUEENAN

Costello can't do (much) business

without coordinating with his

source...

(gestures out window)

Who is here. In SIU. Follow

Costello and you'll find his rat.

QUEENAN (CONT'D)

(turns away)

You're going to be looking at my

people. Going through their bank

statements, phone bills, medical

records. Don't expect them to get

you a coffee or invite you to their

houses. Let me get you a coffee.

QUEENAN (V.O.)

Follow Costello and you'll find his

informer.

112.

VOICE ON PHONE (V.O.)

Internal Investigations.

COLIN

This is Sullivan. I need constant

surveillance on Captain Queenan,

starting right now.

COLIN

If I wasn't with the Mass State

Police. If I did it full time,law

school, I'd be through in a year.

I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a

trooper.

MADOLYN

What's going on?

COLIN

Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing

going on. Just thinking.

MADOLYN

Okay, all right.

(thinking about it; blows

a breath)

And what about money?

COLIN

I got some money. Another

city...I'm thinking that.

MADOLYN

Another city? It'd be a clean

slate.

(CONTINUED)

113.

COLIN

I want you to know you don't gotta

stay. If we're not going to make

it, it's got to be you that gets

out. I'm not capable

(a beat)

I'm fuckin' Irish, so I'll deal

with something being wrong for the

rest of my life.

MADOLYN

Not a bad idea, another city.

DELAHUNT

Of course I know how to spot a cop.

FITZY

Oh yeah, how's that?

DELAHUNT

If he's not paying attention to us,

he's a cop.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)

See that guy over there, he's a

cop. He's not paying attention to

us. He's a cop.

FITZY

Lot of fucking cops.

FITZY (CONT'D)

What kind of dog is that?

(CONTINUED)

114.

FITZY (CONT'D)

She's a cop.

DELAHUNT

She's probably the fucking Police

Commissioner.

COSTELLO

You can get out of here.   This is

the crew for tonight.

BILLY

I thought I was on for that.

COSTELLO

I changed my mind. Take the night

off.

(to Bartender)

Jimmy, get the mop.

MISTER FRENCH

Go out the back. Some guys answer

the questions right. Some don't.

DELAHUNT

You're a cop.

BILLY

Huh?

(CONTINUED)

115.

DELAHUNT

You're ignoring us. You're a cop.

We're guessing who cops are. Most

good looking women are cops.

BILLY

Right. I'm going home. He's playing

with his new boys.

DELAHUNT

See you later.

BILLY

Later.

BILLY (CONT'D)

He's moving something with all new

guys. (A whole new crew.) I don't

want to tell you what or where. It

might be disinformation. It

probably is. Just keep following

him. I need to see you today.

(a beat...reacting to

Queenan, Billy continues)

No. Today.

DETECTIVE 1

Can I ask a question, Sergeant?

COLIN

Yes, go ahead.

DETECTIVE 2

Why the fuck are we following

Captain Queenan? To find out about

the good Catholic life?

(CONTINUED)

116.

COLIN

(angrily)

I have to follow every lead,

however unlikely, however fucking

painful it might be to your

delicate fucking sensibilities.

DETECTIVE 1

Who says I have delicate

sensibilities?

COLIN

I have reason to believe that

Queenan is Costello's informer.

Follow him, and don't get made.

DETECTIVE 1

Copy that, Sarge

DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)

We got him.

DETECTIVE 2

Sarge, we got the target.

QUEENAN

Where are you now?

(CONTINUED)

117.

BILLY

Look down the car.

BILLY (CONT'D)

Got me?

BILLY (CONT'D)

Any reason you'd have a tail?

QUEENAN

No...Of course not.

BILLY

(on the verge of

hyperventilating)

I'm watching a guy...

QUEENAN

I don't have a tail, Billy.

BILLY

Okay. Get off at South Station. You

wait there for ten minutes. After I

leave I'll text message you the

address where we'll meet. I'll make

sure you don't have a tail.

QUEENAN

South Station. Wait ten minutes.

118.

DETECTIVE 1

He went into a building on the

waterfront. Address is 344 Wash...

DETECTIVE 1

He went to the top floor. It's

empty. No tenants.

DETECTIVE 1

I don't know what we're doing here.

COLIN

(to COSTELLO)

I think I've got him. I think

Queenan is meeting with him right

now.

DELAHUNT

Get the van. Get the boys.

119.

QUEENAN

I assume these premises do not have

an anti-smoking ordinance. So,

what's going on?

BILLY

I told you, he's got dope coming

in, I don't know where. He's

getting spooky, Captain...

QUEENAN

What do you mean?

BILLY

He's crazy. I just saw the man.

He had blood all over him. I can't

get any more information for you.

I can't trust it. He's not

including his regular guys... I'm

telling you, he's gonna find out

who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill

me, I know it.

QUEENAN

All right, all right. I hear you.

I'm sorry for you trouble. Look,

I'm not gonna jeopardize your

safety any longer. I'll get you

out. I can't do it overnight but

I'll do it. We can bust him for

what we have. At least I think we

can...I hope. You're out of there

ASAP.

BILLY

Yeah?   What about the FBI?

QUEENAN

They're compromised.

BILLY

What?

QUEENAN

They're fucked, just like this

lighter.

(CONTINUED)

120.

DELAHUNT

Billy, where the fuck are you? We

been trying to reach you. We found

the rat. Top man says we're gonna

take care of him. The address is

314 Washington Street. You got it?

All right. See you there.

QUEENAN

What?

BILLY

You were fucking followed.

QUEENAN

By who?

BILLY

Costello's people.

QUEENAN

Impossible.

BILLY

No. One of the cops he's got inside

tipped him.

(CONTINUED)

121.

DETECTIVE 1

What the fuck is going on?

DETECTIVE 2

Holy fucking shit. Looks like

Queenan's meeting with all of them.

COLIN

Yes.

BILLY

They'll be on the elevators, too.

QUEENAN

Take the back fire escape.

BILLY

What'll you do?

QUEENAN

I'll be fine. If you get made I

can't protect you. Go down the fire

escape. Now. That's an order. I'll

be fine.

122.

QUEENAN

Can I help you gentlemen?

FITZY

I guess we've had enough of this

shit. Where's your boy?

DETECTIVE 1

Fuck!   Something came off the roof.

COLIN

What came off the roof? What do

you mean something came off the

roof? Go again with that

information.

FITZY

You're fuckin' late. Where the

fuck were you? Get in the fuckin'

van.

(CONTINUED)

123.

BILLY

What the fuck happened?    I came to

meet you.

DETECTIVE 1

Stay in the fucking car. Stay in

the fucking car. This is a

surveillance unit.

(into mic to Colin)

Do I pursue.

COLIN

No. Stay where you are. I need

some fucking information here.

What came off the building?

DETECTIVE 1

I'm not sure.

DETECTIVE 1

No pursuit. No pursuit.

DETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D)

Fuck that.

DETECTIVE 4

Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X

to CP. We're being fired upon. I

repeat.

124.

DETECTIVE 4 (V.O.)

We have an officer down. An

officer has been shot. Request

immediate assistance.

FITZY

And where the fuck were you?

BILLY

Boss told me to go home.

FITZY

Maybe he did and maybe he didn't.

At any rate you weren't fuckin'

home.

BILLY

I was in a fucking grocery store

with no signal. When I got a signal

I got the call. What the fuck do

you want. Was I there or was I not

there? Huh?

DELAHUNT (OS)

Billy. Billy

(Billy goes over to him)

BILLY

(re: his wounds)

Jesus Christ.

(CONTINUED)

125.

DELAHUNT

Two days...two days ago the Boss

says to me, it's been ten years

already, and you've never done me

wrong. He asked me, if one of the

other guys is a rat, would I take

him out. I told him I would but I

don't know if I would. Now I know I

can't. I've done a lot of bad

things but I've never been a

murderer.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)

Hey Billy, I don't want no one to

put me in a dumpster. Just don't

put me in a dumpster.

BILLY

When you're dead it makes no

difference where they put you.

DELAHUNT

You know what I thought today?

BILLY

What's that?

DELAHUNT

Who didn't show up today is the

rat.

BILLY

Yeah, so?

DELAHUNT

You never been late in your life.

And when I called you... I made a

mistake. I gave you the wrong

address. But you showed up at the

right one.

DELAHUNT (CONT'D)

Tell me why I didn't say anything.

Tell me why.

(CONTINUED)

126.

FITZY

(drinking)

That cop was tough. We were

excessive with the cop.

BILLY

He's dead. I'm going home.

ELLERBY

Do you know why Queenan went to

that building?

COLIN

No.

DIGNAM

A better question is why your

fuckers were following him.

COLIN

I told Internal Investigations to

follow him.

DIGNAM

Why?

COLIN

That's internal Investigations

business.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I have to investigate everybody and

anybody. I don't have to justify

anything. Nor does anyone have to

like it. I now have information...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

127.

COLIN (CONT'D)

from a very good source...that

Queenan may have been killed by his

own undercover.

DIGNAM

That's a fucking lie.

COLIN

Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant

Dignam here have information on

this undercover, and other

informants, in a locked file. I

need those files unlocked.

DIGNAM

I don't have the password.   Why

don't you come down to the

garage...

COLIN

That's a lie.

DIGNAM

No one calls me a liar. Especially

when I'm lying.

ELLERBY

Everybody shut up.

(to BROWN)

Work with the tech guys to unlock

the files. Dignam. You take a leave

of absence.

DIGNAM

Leave of what?

ELLERBY

Queenan's dead. That makes me your

boss.

DIGNAM

I'll hand in my papers first.

COLIN

What?

(CONTINUED)

128.

ELLERBY

Hey, world needs plenty of

bartenders. Two weeks with pay.

DIGNAM

Good.

COLIN

I need those codes.

ELLERBY

No, you want those codes.

BILLY

I tried to call you a few times.

MADOLYN

I know.     (I know.).   I can't...

MADOLYN (CONT'D)

I can't be a friend to you. I

can't. I'm sorry.

BILLY

It's okay, okay, I know.

COSTELLO

Now, when I hear Lucia, I can't

stop thinking about the cocaine

curtsy you did on that nigger

broad's face.

(the phone rings. Costello

answers:)

What?

(CONTINUED)

129.

COLIN

(into phone)

Your shouldn't have killed Queenan.

COSTELLO

One of us was going to have to die.

With me it tends to be the other

guy.

COLIN

(agitated)

You're crazy, Frank. You killed the

guy who has all the information.

And Dignam's not in the office,

he's gone. He resigned.

COSTELLO

I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

COLIN

He's fucking gone. They took his

papers in. He's not talking. I

don't know where he is.

COSTELLO

Don't get your balls in an uproar,

Collie. That Irish piss-ant won't

be a problem. He's so hot for me,

we give him a whiff of my ass,

he'll crawl right in it. Let's give

him a whiff.

COLIN

I will.

COSTELLO

Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Sweetheart, you're giving me a hard-

on.

GWEN

Are you sure it's me or all that

talk about whiffin' and crawlin' up

asses?

(CONTINUED)

130.

COSTELLO

Hey, watch your fucking mouth.

GWEN

You watch it.

GWEN (CONT'D)

Let me straighten you out.

COLIN

Yeah.

BILLY

You called this number on a dead

guy's phone. Who are you?

COLIN

So it is you. Thank God you're all

right. We were very worried.

(CONTINUED)

131.

BILLY

Who are you?

COLIN

You're talking to Sergeant

Sullivan. I'm taking over

Queenan's unit.

BILLY

Let me talk to Dignam to confirm

it.

COLIN

Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a

leave of absence. He's very upset.

We're all very upset. The best

thing would be for your to come in.

We need you to come in.

NEWS ANCHOR

State Police have confirmed that

the body of the man found dead in

the Fenway marshes yesterday

afternoon is that of Timothy

Delahunt, an undercover policeman

the scene today.... If you have

any information about this murder,

you are urged to call the Boston

Police.

FITZY

Fuck.   I can't believe it.

MISTER FRENCH

Don't believe what?

FITZY

I'm embarrassed. How the fuck did

they find him so fast? I spent all

fuckin' night out there, dragged

the poor bastard.... I must have

been there seven hours. In three

feet of mud. What the fuck is a

marsh? And who walks their dog in

a fuckin' marsh? In three feet of

water? I don't believe it. I

still don't believe he's a fuckin'

cop.

COSTELLO

The cops are saying he's a cop so I

won't look for the cop.

(to FITZY)

Are you soft? The next time I tell

you to dump a body in the marshes,

put it in the fuckin' marshes, not

where some guy from John Hancock

goes every Thursday to get a

blowjob!

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

Proceed.

COSTELLO

Jesus Christ.

(CONTINUED)

133.

COSTELLO (CONT'D)

What?

COLIN

Don't go. You've got a tail. Two

cars. Not very subtle. They won't

be subtle from now on. That's what

I've been trying to tell you.

COSTELLO

Get rid of them.

COLIN

There's no need to go yourself,

Frank.

COSTELLO

Get rid of the fuckin' tail!

COLIN

I will.   All right.

COSTELLO

Tails. Fuckin' rats. This rat

shit is wearing me thin.

FRENCH

Francis, they're all rats. Women

are rats... cunts...Yeah, we're

becoming a nation of rats.

COLIN

Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off.

Tell your team to stop following

Costello. We don't need to surveil

him.

(CONTINUED)

134.

ELLERBY

What the fuck are you talking

about?

COLIN

I have it from an undercover:

Costello knows he's being followed.

Let our UC take him in.

ELLERBY

What informant?

COLIN

Queenan's guy. He called me when he

found out Queenan was dead. I'm

running him.

ELLERBY

No.   You give him to me.

COLIN

No. But I can give you Costello's

destination.

ELLERBY

You know where he's going?

COLIN

Yes. And what he's about to do.

Call off the tail, and get Special

Ops. Get them on standby. We meet

him where he's going. Suit up.

We're gonna take this prick

tonight.

BROWN

(to crew on the road)

All units fall back.

(CONTINUED)

135.

COLIN

It's the heavy equipment warehouse

Costello owns on Sheffield. He must

have a container or a truck in

there.

(his big moment of

decision)

Go.

COLIN

(into mic)

There's an exit on the other side.

Cover it. We'll take him when he

comes out.

COSTELLO

Load it.

BILLY

How do you know you don't have a

tail?

COSTELLO

Were you in the fuckin' car?

BILLY

What if they took one off and put

another one on, Frank?

COSTELLO

Load.

BILLY

Frank told me to check out the

back. You guys go ahead.

FNG DENNIS

Watch your ass.

COSTELLO

Cocksucker.

COLIN

You're an FBI informant.

COSTELLO

Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm

talking to the FBI.

COLIN

Do they know who I am?

COSTELLO

I never gave up anybody who wasn't

goin' down anyway.

COLIN

Did you give me up?

COSTELLO

Nobody knows nothin'.

COLIN

Frank, Frank, do they know about

me?

COSTELLO

I know you, Colin. You know I'd

never give you up. You're like...

COLIN (CONT'D)

Thank you.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY

No, thank you.

BROWN

He's waited a long time for you.

BILLY)

How'd you get him without the

files?

COLIN

Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You

know that guy?

BROWN

Yeah, we were classmates together.

COLIN

I'm gonna go talk to him.

COLIN

Good to see you Trooper.

BILLY

Yeah.   "Trooper".

COLIN

Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the

phone. How long have you been

undercover?

BILLY

Long time.     Long fuckin' time.

COLIN

I can't begin to tell you what a

debt we owe you. I want you to

know I'll be recommending you for

the Medal of Merit.

BILL

Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's

kinda like a gold star around here,

right?

COLIN

It's the highest honor we got.

BILLY

I just want my identity back.

COLIN

You want to be a cop again?

BILLY

No, being a cop's not an identity.

I want my identity back.

(CONTINUED)

140.

BILLY (CONT'D)

You'll have to excuse me. My only

contact has been with a police

shrink.

COLIN

(throat clicks)

A police shrink.

(instead of asking the

obvious)

Was that... helpful for you?

BILLY

What are you gonna do about the rat

in this building?

COLIN

I'm gonna find him. Don't you

worry about that. You got

anything? Did Frank, ah, say

anything...

BILLY

I'm all done being a cop. I just

want to get my money and go home.

COLIN

Fair enough. You've given a lot.

I can get you your file. I just

need your password.

BILLY

The password's my name, William

Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me

in case something happened to them

and I had to explain myself to

someone like you.

COLIN

All right, Bill. Just give me a

minute. I'm gonna go in the other

room. This computer's gone blooey

on me.

141.

BILLY

I know. I'm not here to...I'm not

need you to keep. For me.

There was no one else.

MADOLYN

COSTELLO

One of us was going to have to die.

It tends to be the other guy.

informers. Theoretically. I can't

unlock the files until after the

brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass

squeezes Dignam.

COSTELLO

So Dignam's the only one with the

keys to the kingdom.

COLIN

He's fucking resigning. He put his

papers in. He's not talking.

COSTELLO

Give me his location. Tonight.

MADOLYN

I thought I was the liar.

COLIN

I can explain.

BILLY

Costello recorded everything. He

put all the tapes in a little box

and kept them with his lawyer. That

was his insurance. His lawyer came

to me. Costello trusted me the

most. Imagine that you rat fuck.

Sound quality good enough? I was a

little worried.

COLIN

What do you want?

BILLY

I want my identity, you two-faced

rat prick.

COLIN

Where are you?

BILLY

Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

You keep your cell on.

Did we not talk about this?   This

is my job.

BILLY

Get your hands up.   Hands.   Hands.

COLIN

Put the fuckin' gun down.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I came here to talk some fucking

sense to you. You get a hold of

yourself and put down the fuckin'

firearm and act professional and I

can get you your money.

COLIN

I can get you your...

Fuck, shit...

BILLY

You didn't come here to talk, you

fuckin' maggot, you came here to

get arrested.

COLIN

Arrested? Arrested for what.

(as BILLY cuffs him)

So you got tapes of what? Costello

was my informant. I was his rat?

Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was

my informant.

BILLY

Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.

COLIN

What is this, a citizen's arrest?

Blow me, prick. Only one of us is

a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who

you are. Nobody knows who you are.

BILLY

Would you shut the fuck up.

COLIN

I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State

Police. Who the fuck are you?

Nobody. I ERASED YOU.

BILLY

You erased me?

COLIN

Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein.

See what happens.

BILLY

What would happen is the bullet

would go right through your fuckin'

head.

148.

COLIN

Watch what happens.

BILLY

What, you think you're gonna get

the parade? The bagpipes and

bullshit? Fuck you.

I'm arresting you.

COLIN

That's the stupidest thing you

could do.

BILLY

Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up.

(hits him)

I don't give a fuck if these

charges don't stick.

(whaling him in the beats)

But I'm still fucking arresting

you.

BILLY (CONT'D)

[You are what you do.] Get up.

(COLIN doesn't move.)

I said get the fuck up.

BROWN

Put down the weapon and step away

from Sergeant Sullivan.

BILLY

I called you. You specifically.

You know who I am. I'm not gonna

shoot. I told you to meet me

downstairs.

COLIN

Help me.

(CONTINUED)

149.

BROWN

Put the weapon on the deck and step

away from Sergeant Sullivan.

COLIN

(a mess, bloody-mouthed)

Shoot the fuckin' prick.

BILLY

(desperqte)

Where's Dignam? I told you to bring

Dignam!

COLIN

Shoot the motherfucker!

BROWN

Put the weapon on the ground and

we'll discuss it.

BILLY

He was Costello's rat. I got

evidence. Tapes. Other documents.

BROWN

Maybe you do, but right now I need

you to drop the weapon.

BILLY

I told you I've got the evidence

cold linking this prick to

Costello...

(BROWN wavers)

You fuckin' know who I am. I'm

taking him downstairs now.

COLIN

I can't wait for you to try to

explain this to a Suffolk County

grand jury. This is gonna be fun.

(CONTINUED)

150.

COLIN (CONT'D)

Just fucking kill me.

BILLY

I am killing you.

BROWN

(holstering his gun)

Shit...

BARRIGAN

Did you think you were the only one

he had? Costello was going to sell

us to the FBI. It's you and me now.

We have to take care of each other.

You understand?

COLIN

All right. Give me that.

(CONTINUED)

151.

COLIN

At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who

I now understand to have been

Francis Costello's informer in SIU,

intercepted us in the lobby and

shot Trooper William Costigan once

in the head.

(drinks water)

At that time Barrigan retrieved

Trooper Costigan's undercover

weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he

was approaching our location. I

attempted to subdue Trooper

Barrigan and in the ensuing

struggle was struck several times

with the Walther pistol. I was

able to wrestle the weapon away, at

which time Barrigan drew his own

weapon and took aim at me. I was

able to get off a single shot,

striking Barrigan in the head. I

then checked for vital signs of

Troopers Brown and Costigan and

discovered that they had expired.

COLIN (CONT'D)

I'd like to go on record that I am

recommending Trooper William

Costigan for the Medal of Merit.

(CONTINUED)

152.

COLIN

What about the baby?

COLIN

(accepting it, sort of,

but only in a COLIN way)

OK.
