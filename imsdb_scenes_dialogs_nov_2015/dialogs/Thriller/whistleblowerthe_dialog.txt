1   BLACKNESS...                                                    1

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN)

I can't see anything... Are you there?

Silence.

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)

Are you there!?

Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a

cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door?

She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating...

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try.

RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching...

CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto...

2   EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       2

A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING

BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes

skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a

MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.

Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a

cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It

FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

It's ammonia, not alcohol.

BOY (UKRAINIAN)

(Drunk) You're so smart. I love you!

He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba

gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...

TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...

A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance,

silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs

to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want

to think about what life holds in store.

Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of

the time. Yelling over to Luba...

TWB 2.

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman

wants us there at 9 in the morning.

Raya looks at Luba. Torn.

LUBA (CONT'D)

It's just a few months working in a

hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like

your mother? Marry one of these assholes?

There's nothing here!.. He said it was

both of us or no go!

Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates;

she needs this so badly.

LUBA (CONT'D)

Fuck your mom!

But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past

Luba who watches her disappear.

3   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT                       3

Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights

come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn

between anger and relief.

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but--

HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)

It's three in the morning.

Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the

lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom.

SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's

measly aspirations...

4   EXT. KYIV - MORNING                                             4

The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv.

5   INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING                                 5

Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a

cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod.

ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)

Big smile!

TWB 3.

Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

(practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am

going to Budapest to buy carpets for re-

selling. I am staying two days...

Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia,

nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera.

LUBA (CONT'D)

No-one's gonna believe we really did it!

Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement.

CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up

with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE.

Then the title of the film fades in...

"THE WHISTLEBLOWER"

A FLASHLIGHT cuts across...

6   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT                   6

POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to

THE FRONT PORCH

He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38.

Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell

of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE

standing in the doorway.

HUSBAND

It just got a bit heated, you know how it

gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors

tomorrow.

Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.

OFFICER LEEDS

Ready to go?

Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.

KATHY

You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?

The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...

WIFE

Really. It was nothing.

TWB 4.

The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him,

noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to

a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.

KATHY

You all have any children?

HUSBAND

Nope.

The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.

HUSBAND (CONT'D)

So if that's all Officer...

KATHY

I'd like to take a quick walk through the

house.

HUSBAND

You can't do that without a warrant.

KATHY

Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.

The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up

the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...

HUSBAND

You're not coming in my house!

He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...

GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in

EXTREME PAIN.

O.S. POLICE SIRENS BLARE

7   INT. HOSPITAL HALL - NIGHT                                         7

Three POLICE OFFICERS linger. They peek through a door at...

8   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                          8

Kathy. She sits up on a gurney. The DOCTOR examines her

shoulder. It's BRUISED PURPLE.

DOCTOR

Painful there?

Kathy winces.

TWB 5.

CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her

exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.

HAWK

I'm her Captain.

DOCTOR

Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going

to have to set her arm in a cast.

HAWK

Lookin' for a route to the desk?

KATHY

Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my

body until I'm captain.

Hawk laughs.

KATHY (CONT'D)

I'm fine. I'm sure you have a hotter date

than this tonight.

HAWK

I wish.

KATHY

Just when my self esteem was gettin' so

healthy.

HAWK

We found a boy locked in the basement.

Badly beaten. We charged the husband with

domestic assault. You made the right

call. But you should've waited for

backup. (sighing)... I wish I didn't have

to say this--

KATHY

You're giving Deke the gold shield.

HAWK

I have to Kathy. He has seniority.

Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.

HAWK (CONT'D)

You deserve the promotion. You should be

a detective and if we had more openings--

KATHY

That gold shield was the first one in

four years... Sir... I'm going to have to

resign, and take that position overseas.

TWB 6.

HAWK

I think that's a mistake. I want you on

my team.

Kathy sighs, touched. But...

KATHY

Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on

the streets much longer. Not if I don't

know there's something on the other end.

She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at...

The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15.

This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk

eyes Erin, sympathetic.

HAWK

Just think about it, will you?

He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes

Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.

9   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER                                         9

Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned.

ERIN

I wish you could stay here.

KATHY

Me too.

Erin turns. Serious. Weighing...

ERIN

I mean it's fine living at dad's, but...

Now I really won't see you for a while.

KATHY

I'm doing this for us. If I have a better

job, I can give you guys more.

Erin nods, tearing again.

ERIN

When do you have to decide?

KATHY

Come here.

Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug,

wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face.

TWB 7.

ERIN

Are you sure it's not dangerous?

KATHY

Of course. It's been four years. Things

are getting back to normal over there.

BILL HYNES

You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace

International to represent the US as

monitors for the United Nations, which

means you are the only national

contingent coming from a private

military. So you people chose to come

here. And for the next few weeks, we will

teach you how to protect the rule of law

in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil

society brick by brick...

14   EXT. OUTLYING SUBURB - DAY                                     14

BILL HYNES (O.S.)

...to ensure the dignity, equality, and

inalienable human rights of every single

person in this devastated place.

TWB 9.

BILL HYNES (CONT'D)

The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended

this war, dictating that an International

Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth

the transition from war to peace.

15   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY                               15

20   EXT. TITO BARRACKS - AFTERNOON                                 20

BILL HYNES

But today is a new day. As Head of the

United Nations Mission here I trust that

we stake our highest values, even our

lives, on the belief that we can rebuild,

we must renew, we will witness the

rebirth of this country.

KATHY

I thought this was peanut butter but--

TWB 11.

CARMEN

It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too.

Let's get out of here. I need a drink.

22   EXT. STREET - SARAJEVO - NIGHT                               22

AMERICAN IPTF

That's a military Bar. You want the party

in there...

CARMEN

Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.

KATHY

Hon, they're all yours.

CARMEN

Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a

Jaegermeister.

JAN

What about you? You don't have an order?

KATHY

No. I'm the polite one.

JAN

I like polite.

TWB 12.

CARMEN

I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get

toasted.

Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans

into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off.

AT THE BAR

Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye,

but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN

SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous.

And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...

ITALIAN SOLDIER

I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.

Kathy looks him over.

KATHY

Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.

The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.

TODD MYERS (O.S.)

We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale...

Kathy, right?

Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF

AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.

TODD MYERS (CONT'D)

Look the basic lay of the land is we have

to work with the other nationals, but we

don't mix with them at night.

JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...

JIM HIGGINS

Lucky those wops don't carry guns or

we'd've had ourselves a situation.

Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping

we'd get to squeeze some off.

TODD MYERS

At who? Better odds you'll step on a land

mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do

for you then?

JIM HIGGINS

(embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who

buried it.

Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy.

TWB 13.

TODD MYERS

You ever had to take someone down?

KATHY

Just once.

23   INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT                                   23

JAN

You should probably get her home.

KATHY

You probably shouldn't have let her drink

that much.

JAN

Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys.

Nothing was going to happen to her.

JAN (CONT'D)

I was hoping you'd come back.

KATHY

Well I did. And now we're both leaving.

24   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                       24

TWB 14.

KATHY

Let's move. We're gonna be late.

26   EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY                             26

CARMEN

Do you have any idea where we are?

27   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            27

JAN

Late night ladies?

JAN (CONT'D)

I'm your duty officer. You check the duty

roster. Every day. You're each assigned

to monitor and instruct a group of

Bosnian local police. We work in six week

shifts. You instruct in the mornings,

then go into the field with them in the

afternoon. One of you needs to go now.

JAN (CONT'D)

They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out

the gate, then left, left, park, right...

JAN (CONT'D)

My van. There's a map in front.

KATHY

Feel free to sit wherever you like.

BOSNIAN WOMAN

Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.

KATHY

Great, well... I just asked them to sit.

BOSNIAN WOMAN

They like to be difficult. They

understand if you're clear. Mostly they

have trouble speaking English. But let's

see if you can get them to talk at all.

KATHY

Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime

scene investigation today. If we could--

DANIK (BROKEN ENGLISH)

Where do we sign to say we came?

KATHY

Actually, you sign the attendance at the

end of the session. It's a UN mandate--

DANIK

Or we sign now?

KATHY

We sign later.

TWB 16.

30   INT. CLASSROOM - LATER                                         30

KATHY (CONT'D)                   INTERPRETER

DANIK

We sign sheet now?

DANIK (CONT'D)

You will tell UN we were cooperating?

KATHY

We have to go to the hospital together.

31   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            31

We got here as quick as we could.

CLARKSON (BRITISH ACCENT)

Just try to get them here on time.

TWB 17.

32   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            32

CLARKSON

Seems we have two stabbings, one

shooting, and a man with a broken leg and

a bad hangover who can't remember what

happened... Average night back in

Brighton.

CLARKSON (CONT'D)

(reading chart) "facial contusions from

repeated beatings with fist",

"lacerations on the eye caused by the

edge of an iron"...

CLARKSON (CONT'D)

"The right hand was the first entry point

of a large kitchen knife"... "The second

entry point in the upper left thigh"...

It went through her hand and into her

leg... Who's going to take this report?

CLARKSON (CONT'D)

Anyone?

TWB 18.

VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH)

I will take it.

DANIK (BOSNIAK)

(At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna.

KATHY

What did he say?

VIKO

She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.

CLARKSON

Alright, that's it. Everyone out.

KATHY

(at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a

complaint?

33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33

KATHY

She has to file a complaint. A woman gets

stabbed in the face and there are no

repercussions?

CLARKSON

Quit it! You hear me?

CLARKSON (CONT'D)

We are not investigators. We are

monitors. You don't know a Serb from a

Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic

hatreds that started a war. This isn't

just policing, it's diplomacy.

TWB 19.

CLARKSON (CONT'D)

We don't run the show, we make sure the

show runs smoothly.

34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34

Come out. You can't solve this tonight.

I'm not taking no for an answer.

VIKO

Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital

eight time because of her husband. Every

time she try to file a complaint, my

bosses send her back. They always laugh

at the woman... They laughed at my

mother. They do not make prosecutions of

domestic violence. I want to get enough

evidence to do this.

VIKO (CONT'D)

This is why you are here, no?

TWB 20.

KATHY

With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you

go back to the hospital... You can pull

the records for every one of her visits.

Okay, now get the same thing from all the

doctors who treated her. They will have

to testify on Zlata's behalf.

41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41

KATHY

This is good. Let's cross reference each

injury with other cases where felony

assaults were ruled. Can you get

something like that?

KATHY (CONT'D)

... Because if stabbing someone in a bar

is illegal then the same standard can be

applied to a domestic assault.

I'm sure it's fine. You followed

Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.

KATHY

Ms. Rees, I--

MADELEINE REES

Madeleine. You've been stirring things

up.

KATHY

Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've

overstepped protocol--

MADELEINE REES

You have done in two months, what we've

been trying to do for years.

TWB 22.

MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)

All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you

just facilitated the first conviction for

domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm

bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty

Officer who recommended you.

MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)

The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at

Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the

current head, is leaving and I think

you're the right person to take over.

MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)

You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices.

Any gender reports come through you. This

involves anything from equality training

to domestic and child abuse cases,

fallout from war crimes against women,

prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated

like second class citizens. You could

have a real impact on their lives. What

do you think? Are you interested?

KATHY

Absolutely.

I know hon, it's very exciting. If this

works out. It's a real opportunity for

the future, but it means I have to, I

have to extend my contract for another

No I didn't. I'll look right now.

office?

KATHY

Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.

CARMEN

But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?

KATHY

(smiling) I know. I don't even know if

I'm still IPTF.

CARMEN

Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know

is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with

You'll be reporting to me.

KATHY

Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to

Madeleine Rees' Office.

RICK JONES

It's a joint office. She's Human Rights.

But you're Police Task Force. So you go

through me. But we all report to Bill

Hynes anyhow.

You are certain you have everything you

need?

JAN

We're fine thank you.

JAN (CONT'D)

You were saying I'm a nice guy--

KATHY

You must be in heaven over here.

JAN

The war left behind a lot of widows.

TWB 26.

KATHY

You don't find that--

JAN

I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys

don't. I don't know what else to say

about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a

KATHY

I can't afford to mess this up.

JAN

It's only dinner. How bad can it get?

KATHY

This is the first time they've seen their

KATHY

They're all widows?

BARRY

That's why they were so frightened to

come back.

TWB 27.

BARRY (CONT'D)

They couldn't believe they'd be safe.

That what happened before wouldn't happen

again. Except now with nobody to protect

them.

KATHY

Except us.

BARRY

I always thought helping refugees get

home would be one of the best parts of

KATHY

Thanks for taking me through this. Fill

KATHY

It's okay, it's--

TWB 28.

She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.

KATHY (CONT'D)

(at field worker) Call a medic!

He rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on

the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death.

Kathy holds her hand.

KATHY (CONT'D)

Who is she?

FIELD WORKER

I found her out in the woods. She was

speaking, I don't know, she's not local.

I think she's one of the girls from the

bars.

Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her

face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is...

Raya. A long way from home. But then...

THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA,

17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face

bruised. Kathy looks up...

HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER

She was further back in the woods.

Irka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing...

IRKA (ENGLISH/RUSSIAN)

Florida Bar... Ciysh... Six girl there...

Iy Policai...

Kathy looks to Barry.

BARRY

It's a bar in the hills.

Kathy shakes her head. She looks at Raya and Irka.

BARRY (CONT'D)

I'll take them to the women's shelter at

Zenica.

Kathy rummages through her files, catching up.

KATHY

Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.

Barry shrugs. Kathy's mind is racing.

TWB 29.

Kathy looks around, frustrated.

KATHY

Is there a translator on the scene?

Translator?... Wait.

He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.

KATHY (CONT'D)

This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an

Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.

The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls.

WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH)

Okay. I need a time and date.

KATHY

Now.

WALKIE VOICE (O.S.)

That's impossible. We need advance notice

for field calls.

The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him,

but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward

them, protectively, then sees...

TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.

TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them.

They seem surprised.

KATHY

Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--

FRED MURRAY

Hey. Fred Murray.

He shakes her hand.

Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic

with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder.

KATHY

Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I

tried to get an interpreter but--

FRED MURRAY

No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much

done here anyway.

TWB 31.

KATHY

Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had

two girls come in to a Human Rights

Office, saying they escaped from this

place.

FRED MURRAY

Yeah. Local police have been watching the

place for a while. This whole thing

happened pretty fast. I guess those girls

must've run for it.

KATHY

Well, the girls in our field office

seemed pretty scared. I should follow up

with these ones.

FRED MURRAY

You can see where they're taking them,

but I can't intervene. You know the

Thanks. I'll look out for your report.

MILENA (ACCENTED ENGLISH)

These girls are told they have been

bought and must repay the debt. They are

told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll

be let go when they earn back that money.

But they never are.

MILENA (CONT'D)

Sex trafficking is one of the worst

things to happen after this war.

MILENA (CONT'D)

Raya has a severe internal infection. The

doctor found (reading) "intentionally

placed foreign objects causing a

disruption of the vaginal wall".

KATHY

Foreign objects?

MILENA

Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel

deficient paying for sex, so they find

other ways to feel powerful.

MILENA (CONT'D)

We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is

worried there could be something more

serious.

KATHY

When will he know?

TWB 34.

MILENA

Unfortunately that's all we can do for

her. We're just a volunteer organization.

Kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...

KATHY

But if there are so many victims.

MILENA

We lost our funding because of those.

...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee.

MILENA (CONT'D)

It's the U.S. Department of State. They

have their rules. I'll do anything to

give these girls some protection. But the

Department of State thinks "Condoms

encourage prostitution." NGOs caught

giving them out, no longer receive US

funding.

KATHY

But these girls aren't prostitutes.

Milena shrugs.

MILENA

They don't realize the cycle they start. If

there are no condoms in the bars...

They pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR

TEENS. All broken. And desperate.

MILENA (CONT'D)

...the guys want to find ways of avoiding

STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for

virgins...

Kathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than

TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone.

MILENA (CONT'D)

So the traffickers bring more in. Younger

and younger. Now it's a global industry.

Simple economics. If there is demand, you

supply.

Milena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A

VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN

ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed...

TWB 35.

KATHY

Where can they get help?

MILENA

Try the Global Displacement Agency. They

have good medical care, lots of funding.

They might take them. Whether they'll

keep them or not... I don't know.

KATHY

Where are the other girls from the

Florida bar?

KATHY (CONT'D)

The local police were bringing them here.

MILENA

Those girls never arrived.

yesterday.

CARMEN

Your job is so exciting. The only thing I

get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off

the computer)... You sure there was a

raid? There's no record here.

No. That's definitely it. There were six

girls removed from the bar and I need to

I just wanted to follow up with you on

the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't

show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to

locate them.

FRED MURRAY

Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a

mess. Turned out it was a local police

mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or

something. Thought they had a

prostitution bust, but the bar is legit

and those girls were just waitresses.

KATHY

Waitresses aren't kept under lock and

key.

These girls were just sent back. They are

clearly not waitresses. They are victims.

I think IPTF were paid off to turn a

blind eye.

That's a serious allegation. And you

don't have any evidence. I can't open an

If you sign here, you confirm that you

are voluntarily entering the repatriation

program at the GDA.

Raya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly...

LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)

This means we can get you out of Bosnia.

Isn't that what you want?

Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never

thought this moment would come...

LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)

You'll stay here for two weeks, to

continue medical treatment as well as

psychological counselling. We'll give you

a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to

get started when you return.

Suddenly Irka's face drops.

IRKA (RUSSIAN)

But... What do I do then? My parents were

killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who

sold me here... Can't I go somewhere

else?

Laura fumbles.

LAURA LEVIN

We can only send you home, but what you

choose to do after that is up to you.

But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn.

RAYA (RUSSIAN)

What about the others, the girls in the

bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she

couldn't... I don't know where she is...

I can't go without her. Please...

Laura pauses, taken aback.

Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then

There is another option... I want to help

you find your friends. But you need to

help me do that.

Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the

table. Raya eyes it, defiant, no reason to trust her.

KATHY (CONT'D)

None of this is your fault. I want to go

after the people who hurt you. But I need

to know exactly what happens. As a

witness in UN custody, you will be

protected and will not be charged for any

crimes.

Raya stares, still not convinced.

RAYA

I...

The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to

Kathy...

RAYA (BROKEN ENGLISH) (CONT'D)

UN will protect me? They don't protect me

when they drink in bar and fuck me and my

friends.

Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw...

KATHY

I have a daughter, just your age... I

wouldn't stop until I found her.

The two women stare at each other. A silent connection. Raya

looks down, almost... ashamed. Struggling to get this out...

RAYA

I only left because... there was nothing,

no jobs, no... chances. I was good in

school. But with no money... My mother...

She is on her own. She works so hard. But

nothing changes. I thought I could help

her. He said we would work in a hotel.

With good wages...

Tears gathering in her eyes... It's terrifying to remember...

RAYA (CONT'D)

But... When we got there... Other girls

were there. Like us. From Ukraine,

Moldova, Romania, everywhere... We were

in the middle of nowhere.

Do you know this man?

RAYA

He is not the only one. They come every

don't raid the bar. That day you come...

Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to

punish him. Take his money. His girls. I

RICK JONES

How're things?

KATHY

Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar.

It's worse than I thought. There was a

protection racket. IPTF... Americans,

Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make

sure the place wasn't busted. That raid

was a punishment bust, because the owner

stopped paying. But he must've settled it

because the girls are right back where

they started. Locked up in the hills.

KATHY (CONT'D)

I talked to thirty five girls at the

Shelter. All this testimony can't be

ignored. Our guys are patronizing the

bars in large numbers. Rick, serious

abuses are taking place. It's all in my

It's different for us. We're all military

or police. Every contingent except for

the U.S... if someone does something

wrong, they have to answer to a military

tribunal at home. With the Americans...

your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have

that.

KATHY

So the Americans aren't legally

accountable for anything?

JAN

To be honest, I think our superiors would

keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen

a military tribunal.

TWB 50.

JAN (CONT'D)

You know my mission stay is up in a few

weeks... You could come home with me.

KATHY

To do what?

JAN

I was just... This place, y'know, it gets

to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen

to you a year from now.

KATHY

You don't need to worry about me.

JAN

Someone does.

KATHY

So Fred Murray could just walk up to a

man and shoot him in daylight and he'd

never see the inside of a courtroom?

JAN

In Bosnia, yes... but... I mean,

something that public could get him sent

home. And tried in his own country.

97   EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - SARAJEVO - DAY                          97

MADELEINE

Helen loves it here. I think she has

Olympic ambitions.

TWB 51.

KATHY

I wanted these girls to testify in a

trial against the IPTF officers. But--

MADELEINE

The immunity problem.

KATHY

Okay, but if the girls testify in a

Bosnian court against their trafficker...

Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else

goes on in the brothels.

MADELEINE

It could work. If you make certain that

in their testimony they mention every

sordid detail of IPTF involvement--

KATHY

That is their testimony. Then it would be

on record. Somebody would have to pay

attention. Like...the State Department?

MADELEINE

They're gonna answer for this.

98   INT. BASEMENT - UNMHQ - DAY                                   98

99   INT. VEHICLE DISPATCH - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER                 99

KATHY

...and the two girls have to go to the

hospital to get immunized, or they can't

stay in the country. I need an armored

security vehicle.

LEWIS

You're lucky you have a car at all. We're

stretched to the limit. Besides, isn't

this a local police matter? Try them.

TWB 52.

100   EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY                               100

Kathy parks her SUV.

101   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY                               101

Kathy walks into the station, drawing the attention of the

LOCAL COPS. Danik rolls his eyes.

KATHY

I'm looking for--

Danik turns away...

DANIK (BOSNIAK)

Viko... your American girlfriend is here!

Kathy eyes Danik. Viko comes out, smiling broadly at Kathy.

102   EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER                     102

Kathy and Viko walk out, energized with a sense of purpose.

VIKO

It's no problem. The Van is just sitting

here. Let's go.

They arrive at a POLICE VAN. Kathy eyes it.

VIKO (CONT'D)

It's not exactly armored, but it will do

the trick. You follow me, yes?

He jumps in, and starts it up. Kathy follows in her UN SUV.

Across the street, a LOCAL MAN watches from INSIDE A CAR.

103   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - EVENING                                     103

Kathy SWERVES up. Viko has the Van parked right up against

the door. Kathy jumps out.

104   INT. FOYER - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                       104

Laura leads a very scared Raya out. Kathy smiles, gentle.

KATHY

(at Laura) Where's Irka?

Laura takes a deep breath, eyeing Raya...

LAURA LEVIN

I need to have a word with you.

TWB 53.

Kathy looks at her watch -- at Raya. Viko taps her shoulder.

VIKO

I'll take her. Meet us when you're done.

As Viko and Raya leave, Kathy stops her...

KATHY

I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?

Raya nods, trusting in Kathy. Who turns, angry, back to...

LAURA LEVIN

I was going to call you. There was a

problem. During our repatriation

procedures, we realized Irka had no

passport.

KATHY

So we get her one. Where is she?

LAURA LEVIN

You don't get it. She was trafficked from

Belgrade. Her parents were killed in

Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No

embassy will recognize her. She is a girl

without a country.

KATHY

She is a witness for a UN investigation!

GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity.

LAURA LEVIN

We handed her over to the police a few

hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've

already done every favour I could for

you. This is not on me.

KATHY

You had no right to do that!

LAURA LEVIN

I had every right. We have a system that

works here. You're the one disrupting it.

Kathy stares at her. Fuming.

KATHY

Where did they take her?

Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit.

Just then the door opens. And...

TWB 54.

HALYNA

Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising...

HALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH)

I... look for Laura Levin?

LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)

That's me.

Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura

leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes

landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting...

KATHY

If you know anything, this is on you.

INTERN

I think the cops leave them somewhere

near the border, so that with no papers,

the girls have to cross the border

illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad.

105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105

Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road.

Seeing... Nothing but the 20 feet her headlights show.

INTERCUT WITH:

106   INT./ EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                         106

Viko steers the Van around a corner. Raya sits in the back.

107   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SAME                 107

Laura hands an excited Halyna a cup of tea.

LAURA (RUSSIAN)

She'll be back in about an hour.

108   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       108

Kathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN...

LANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO.

Sharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING.

109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109

Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the

van. Seeing... Young WOMEN in the streets. Laughing.

TWB 55.

110   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       110

Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches...

A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows.

BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over.

KATHY

I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped

here a few hours ago.

He shrugs, shaking his head.

KATHY (CONT'D)

Can you check the border logs? She's

about 15, the police brought her here but

she didn't have a passport. Maybe--

GUARD

Lady. I know what you're looking for.

Those girls do not go through the border.

They go through there...

He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES.

GUARD (CONT'D)

To Serbia.

Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through

the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road.

111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111

Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view

mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley.

112   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           112

Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the

top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up

ahead...

A SILHOUETTE. Kathy ACCELERATES.

113   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN ALLEY/SARAJEVO - SAME                    113

Viko eyes the mirror. All clear. Turning onto a DESERTED

STREET.

114   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           114

Kathy HURTLES closer to the silhouette...

TWB 56.

She turns. It's Irka. Kathy cranks the wheel, driving off the

road and onto...

A WIDE FIELD

The SUV is jolted by the uneven terrain. Irka peers into the

blinding light. Then runs...

115   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          115

Viko drives up the deserted street. SUDDENLY two BATTERED

MERCEDES fly out from SIDE ROADS and block the way.

Viko BRAKES hard. Raya is thrown to the side of the Van.

116   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           116

Kathy stops the car, jumps out, and runs after Irka.

KATHY

Irka!

Irka's legs start to give. Kathy gains on her.

117   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          117

Viko REVERSES and TURNS -- but a Mercedes ROARS -- 'round the

other side -- BASHING the side of the Van.

118   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           118

Kathy feels Irka slowing down.

119   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          119

Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS

forward. But..

GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT.

The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window.

Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails,

SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate.

120   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           120

Kathy raises her arms, waving...

Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond

bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights.

TWB 57.

Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes

her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks

over, careful, slowly bending to help.

IRKA

Please... let me die.

Kathy holds her. As the young girl cries.

121   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          121

The Men approach the Van. Raya's BANGING ECHOES from inside,

reverberating around the empty street. Nobody can hear her...

122   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                              122

Isolated stars peek through clouds, drifting over dark hills

stretching far into the horizon....

123   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                           123

Kathy and Viko sit silent. Barry hangs up the phone.

BARRY

Okay. We've got a safe house in the

mountains. Nobody knows she's here, so

we're clear to take her there now.

Kathy looks across the room to Irka, who sits hunched,

looking out the window. Totally alone.

124   EXT. FARM HOUSE - MOUNTAINS - NIGHT                           124

A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE lead Irka inside a small home. In the

MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Shrouded in the black night. Nobody will

find her here. In the doorway, Irka turns to Kathy and Viko.

IRKA (BROKEN ENGLISH)

Where is Raya?

They stare back at her. The woman closes the door. Kathy and

Viko stand in the dead silence. His face bruised.

KATHY

Let's go back to the Florida Bar--

VIKO

You think he'd be that stupid?

KATHY

I don't care! I have nothing else to go

on, do I?

Adrenalin overtaking sadness. Viko follows Kathy to the car.

TWB 58.

125   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      125

Kathy and Viko pull up. It's in full swing.

126   INT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      126

They step inside, and IN ONE GLANCE, see... THE WHOLE SET OF

GIRLS is different. No Luba, No Raya, No Tanjo... The IPTF

barely notice her.

127   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      127

Kathy steps out. Furious.

VIKO

They moved them already.

KATHY

Fuck!

At the end of her rope.

128   INT. GDA - NIGHT                                              128

Laura, at a total loss, eyes... Halyna. Sitting. Terrified.

HALYNA (RUSSIAN)

...How could? No, no, no... my, Raya....

What!? What will they do to her?

129   EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT                                    129

A BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads.

130   INT. BROWN VAN - SAME                                         130

IVAN, 40s, drives. Tanjo is in the passenger seat.

TANJO (SERBIAN)

We'll stop soon. We're far enough now.

Ivan nods. Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on

an overhead light, revealing...

Five girls. Huddled in the back.

TANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)

So you want to testify?

All the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by

the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her

eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away.

TWB 59.

TANJO (CONT'D)

It's okay. We all move to a new bar now.

Somewhere no one will come look for you.

Then we have a conversation.

The girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the

light. The van drives off into the unknown.

131   EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING            131

Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the

day. Then she sees...

Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when

He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious.

132   EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY                                 132

Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars.

KATHY

She's fifteen. I'm begging you--

FRED MURRAY

I don't know what you're talking about.

KATHY

If you know any of the other bars he

owns, anything... I'm appealing to--

FRED MURRAY

Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time.

And you can put this down in your

investigation on me. I don't know what

you're talking about.

He leaves. Kathy stands, a black speck in the patchwork of

white UN SUVs spread across the lot.

133   INT. RICK JONES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                          133

Rick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy.

SECRETARY

I've called and paged. He says he can't

get into this now.

KATHY

Does he know that one of my witnesses was

abducted? Where is he?

SECRETARY

Sorry Kathy, he really didn't tell me.

TWB 60.

134   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - MORNING                        134

MADELEINE

It's not your fault.

Kathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced.

KATHY

Irka won't testify now. It's completely

understandable. She's way too scared. I

just... I don't know what to do with her.

The GDA won't take her and her

traffickers will find her if she's in

this city.

Emotion taking over...

KATHY (CONT'D)

These girls are dragged into this country

like cattle and then the system that's

supposed to help them spits them right

back out. It barely recognizes sex

trafficking as a problem even though it's

a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows

it. Are we supposed to wait around for

that to change?

MADELEINE

Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy...

Do you have a nice frock?

135   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                135

Kathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair

hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward.

KATHY

Really? You think it's okay?

She turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles.

JAN

You're beautiful.

But Carmen is tilting her head, doubtful.

CARMEN

You can stop standing like a farmer's

wife for starters. These people are

dignitaries. You gotta up your game.

She approaches her, and sweeps her hair up into an elegant

chignon. She takes off her own earrings and puts them on

Kathy. Jan nods, impressed. Kathy eyes herself, pleased.

TWB 61.

136   INT./EXT. CAR/SARAJEVO HILLS - EVENING                        136

A WHITE VOLKSWAGON RABBIT speeds though the Sarajevo hills.

Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black

dress, self-conscious.

KATHY

Is there a specific way of addressing the

High Commissioner of the Mission?

MADELEINE

I call him Bill.

Kathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive...

137   EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER           137

The house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens,

remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING.

An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...

MADELEINE

(familiar) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?

JANET WELLS

We do what we can. Great to see you

Madeleine.

Janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse.

MADELEINE

I hope you don't mind, I've brought along

a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.

Kathy holds out her hand, a little nervous.

JANET WELLS

Great. I need as many gal pals as I can

get. Look at this place.

She gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers

over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on

Bill Hynes

Surrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her

and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring.

AMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back.

AMBASSADOR WELLS

What are your thoughts on dinner?

TWB 62.

JANET WELLS

I think people are still busy drinking.

John shakes Madeleine's hand, darting his eyes over Kathy.

AMBASSADOR WELLS

Speaking of, what can I get you ladies?

Madeleine looks at Kathy.

KATHY

Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have

a wine please.

AMBASSADOR WELLS

(nodding) Coming right up. Madeleine,

white for you?

Kathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in,

chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of

dignitaries.

138   EXT. BACK PATIO - U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT         138

A stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A

waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it,

gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when...

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Nice view, no?

Kathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette.

KATHY

Oh I... I just needed some air.

PETER WARD

Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate

these stuffy events. You never know

anyone's agenda.

He eyes her. She looks past him... At Bill Hynes. Peter sees.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

Oh... well that's a plan.

MADELEINE (O.S.)

Actually, I had a different one in mind.

Madeleine and Janet come through the door. Peter stubs out

his cigarette, and moves back inside.

TWB 63.

MADELEINE (CONT'D)

(arm around Janet) Behind every good

man...

PATIO - SHORT TIME LATER

Janet's eyes betray empathy. She shakes her head, upset.

JANET WELLS

They just left her there? At the border?

Poor girl... Just the psychological

trauma. How can I help?

KATHY

She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking.

Internationals got her in this situation.

We owe her the chance to get out.

Janet is keen to follow, but a little lost.

MADELEINE

We want to repatriate Irka to the United

States and find her a foster family. I

was hoping you could use your influence--

Janet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically.

JANET WELLS

We're going to find her a home.

Kathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed.

KATHY

I also think the American embassy should

be aware of some of the problems we're

having with our officers.

Madeleine interjects...

MADELEINE

Your help with Irka's case can really

raise awareness in the Mission around the

issue of trafficking.

Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the

difference between a cop and a diplomat.

139   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                        139

Kathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud

of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the

board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB.

TWB 64.

140   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY MORNING                      140

Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a

field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road.

He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him.

In the van... Ivan rolls down the window.

BOY (SERBIAN)

Can I come with you?

IVAN (SERBIAN)

Not today.

The boy looks down, disappointed.

IVAN (CONT'D)

Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner.

Then you and I will go for a walk. I have

a present for you.

BOY

What is it?

Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away.

141   EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING    141

The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the

back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE.

TANJO (SERBIAN)

You couldn't buy him a new one? You have

money now.

IVAN (SERBIAN)

I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I

had one like it.

Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building.

TANJO

They're downstairs. I want to get them

out today.

142   INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          142

Ivan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS

GROW LOUDER as they descend into a

BASEMENT

TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door.

Ushering Ivan INSIDE where...

TWB 65.

GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look

up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell.

We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo

waves his fingers, methodically...

TANJO (RUSSIAN)

C'mon, let's go.

The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but

submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door.

TANJO (CONT'D)

I want to show you what happens when YOU

DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!!

They jump back. His scream echoes. They move

THROUGH THE HALL

To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the

door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo

pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a

BARREN ROOM

And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE

ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And

we see that...

Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT

CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.

RAYA

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain.

Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A

flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and

drops... A PIPE onto the ground.

The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now

the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.

143   EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNHCR - DAY                            143

Madeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS.

MADELEINE

The young woman, who shall remain

anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim

of sex trafficking and has survived

horrific abuse.

(MORE)

TWB 66.

MADELEINE (CONT'D)

Ordinarily she would be repatriated to

her country of origin. But because she is

an orphan, she finds herself without a

home. I'm pleased to announce that we

have found a foster family in the United

States. I want to thank Janet Wells for

her assistance in making this happen. I

believe this can stand as a signal that

the International community in Bosnia and

beyond is finally ready to recognize the

growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a

human rights abuse as abhorrent as the

war crimes that drew the International

Community to intervene in Bosnia in the

first place. Thank you.

REPORTER

Now that the UN is finally recognizing

sex-trafficking, how are you going to

monitor it?

Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back,

proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches.

144   EXT. FRONT STEPS - UNHCR - SHORT TIME LATER                   144

Kathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success.

MADELEINE

Nothing on Raya?

Kathy shakes her head, saddened.

KATHY

I've sent an APB out to all police

stations and UN field offices... But I'm

pushing ahead with the other girls in

Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo-

line-up using the UN ID database, so they

can identify all internationals involved.

We've got to make them accountable.

145   INT. CORRIDOR - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SHORT TIME LATER     145

Milena looks through a glass window into...

146   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - EVENING        146

Kathy sits with girls including Fadila, Nadia, Eva... She

brings up ID PHOTOS of IPTF officers, scrolling down the

page. Fadila points at one and nods, speaking. Kathy writes.

Another girl, JASMILA, points at a picture of...

TWB 67.

AN IPTF OFFICER. She nods.

Kathy brings up a new page of ID PHOTOS. Flicking through

page after page. The girls identify SEVERAL OFFICERS.

147   INT. PERSONNEL - UNMHQ - DAY                                147

Kathy finds Carmen behind a computer.

KATHY

I have a favour to ask.

CARMEN

Shoot.

KATHY

You have access to all transport vehicle

checkouts, right?

CARMEN

I'm a fountain of useless knowledge.

KATHY

Can you see how often Fred Murray has

checked out raid vehicles?

CARMEN

Fred Murray?

Kathy nods. Carmen looks at her, surprised.

CARMEN (CONT'D)

Fred was sent home.

Kathy stands back. Confused.

KATHY

What? Why didn't anyone tell me. Is he

being disciplined because of my--

Carmen shakes her head.

CARMEN

He's just gone. Meaning investigation

over. They wanted him out of here. People

are talking. Come on, let's get some

lunch.

148   INT. CAFETERIA - UNMHQ - AFTERNOON                          148

Kathy and Carmen at a table in the corner.

TWB 68.

CARMEN

Kath, you gotta be careful. Look, I know

you're doing your own thing and all, but

you're investigating your colleagues.

KATHY

You've seen what they're doing.

CARMEN

I know. I know. I just, the stuff people

are saying, I'm catching snippets, and

I'm worried about you. Think about your

kids.

Kathy is silenced. Then... A TAP ON HER SHOULDER...

MONITOR

Looking for you in Human Resources.

Carmen eyes Kathy, concerned. Kathy follows the monitor

toward the exit. MONITORS and CIVILIANS buzz about, talking.

But all around Kathy, the air is silent. Some IPTF OFFICERS

eye her, coolly. Is she paranoid?

149   INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                    149

OFFICER BLAKELY smiles formally. Kathy shifts in her seat.

BLAKELY

I'm John Blakely, Human Resources.

Kathy eyes him, dubious.

BLAKELY (CONT'D)

In going through your records, I see

you've got quite a case load. It must be

stressful.

KATHY

(deadpan) A bit.

BLAKELY

Would you say you're under extreme

stress?

KATHY

Excuse me?

BLAKELY

There are concerns among some of your

superiors that you've become impulsive,

reckless in your position.

Kathy sits, shocked.

TWB 69.

BLAKELY (CONT'D)

We'd like to suggest taking some time

off. You have some leave time...

Kathy eyes him coolly. He slides over a booklet.

BLAKELY (CONT'D)

See here? You can consolidate your leave.

We'll contact our head offices in the

U.K. and ensure none of your pay would be

deducted... Just... Take a little

vacation. Go home. See your kids.

We're simply suggesting this out of

concern for you.

KATHY

Are you suggesting I take time off. Or

are you telling me?

BLAKELY

This is simply out of concern for you.

Kathy pushes her chair back, and leaves.

150   INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                  150

Kathy sits at the table, covered in photos of girls, flipping

through the Dyncorp manual, irritated.

KATHY

Consolidate my leave... A fucking

vacation?

She shakes her head, overwrought. Flipping through the

manual, seeing...

KATHY (CONT'D)

Who are these people? (stopping on a

page) And why does Dyncorp, a company

that sends American peacekeepers, have

it's corporate headquarters in England?

She looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help.

KATHY (CONT'D)

Of course I want to see my kids, of

course. But... not like this. Not by

being sent home like some hysterical

woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to

up and leave them. If I go home like

this... It's like coming here, this whole

thing was a... mistake.

TWB 70.

She shakes her head, lost in thought... Maybe it was... Jan

sits beside her, concerned.

JAN

Nobody who knows you could think that.

KATHY

Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects...

It's one step forward, two steps back...

Jan tries to jump in. But--

KATHY (CONT'D)

No, seriously. I'm just a cop from

Nebraska. What do I know?

Jan shakes his head.

JAN

It's not what. It's who. You know them.

He points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over

the table. Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and

something much more instinctive...

151   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - EVENING              151

Laura sits across from Halyna, who is heartbroken.

LAURA (RUSSIAN)

Mrs. Kochan... It's been a few weeks now.

I don't know if there's much point--

HALYNA (RUSSIAN)

But we-- I must-- I have to do something.

There has to be something I can do?!

Laura takes a second. Suddenly struck with an idea.

152   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                      152

A large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains

above the city of TUZLA. A VAN pulls up.

153   INT. OASIS BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                153

Raya, Luba follow Ivan up stairs. Ivan unlocks a

BACK BEDROOM

He bangs on a wall. FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He

motions for them to go in. They do.

TWB 71.

MARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE

DRAWINGS of SEXUAL POSITIONS. A price value by each.

MARA (RUSSIAN)

You work in two hours.

Ivan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him.

The other girls go about their business, barely noticing Raya

and Luba. But JULIA and TANYA, 16, come over.

JULIA (RUSSIAN)

You sleep on whichever mattresses are

available. The last two girls in have to

share.

TANYA (RUSSIAN)

They bring us food in the morning. You

have to eat it all, or you get fined.

Raya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to

sit. Julia and Tanya help her to the ground.

JULIA

Don't let him see you like this.

Luba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot

and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress

aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the

floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it.

JULIA (CONT'D)

I'm the closest. Then I can go home.

Raya barely has the energy to hold herself up.

TANYA

What's your name?

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

Rayisa...Raya Kochan.

Tanya scratches Raya's name into the floor. Then one mark.

LUBA (RUSSIAN)

It's all bullshit--

JULIA

No! He sent a girl back three months ago.

I was here! (to Luba) What is your name?

Raya eyes Luba who's conflicted between loyalty to her friend

and her own sense of survival. Luba tears up, but turns away.

TWB 72.

RAYA

(softly) Her name is Luba. Luba Pankiw.

154   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         154

Kathy works, angry, urgent now. On her desk...

CLOSER: REPORT: PHOTO ID LINE-UP. Kathy matches circled ID

photos of IPTF alongside testimony and Polaroids of girls.

She works fast. Circling the photos, slapping files closed.

When a...

MAIL BOY slides in a cart, and places a stack of REPORTS on

Kathy's IN-BOX. She pulls the first one off the top...

A sticky note on the first page: Insufficient Evidence.

Kathy grabs another... Sticky note: Unreliable Witness. She

sees the name NADIA at the top of the statement.

She grabs... ANOTHER: Unreliable Witness. And another...

Transferred to Internal Affairs.

Kathy flies through the rest of the files. One after another:

Insufficient Evidence -- Insufficient Evidence -- Transferred

to Internal Affairs --Unreliable Witnesses -- Insufficient --

A photo falls out of one of them: RAYA. Kathy stares at it.

Her eyes wander over the room, and fall on her predecessor's

battered old file boxes, still waiting for Archives.

She moves to them. Cuts the string on the top box. Rips the

top off. Inside...

REPORT FILES. Slotted in tight. She grabs one. STICKY NOTE:

Insufficient Evidence.

KATHY

Jesus.

She starts RIPPING through them all -- YELLOW STICKY NOTES on

all of them.

VOICE (O.S.)

Kath...

It's Jim Higgins, out of breath, in the doorway...

TWB 73.

JIM HIGGINS

They've called an assembly for all

Dyncorp personnel.

155   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNMHQ - NIGHT                         155

Kathy and Jim walk into a room filled with DYNCORP BOYS.

JIM HIGGINS

Anyone know what this is about?

No one does. Kathy sits amongst the guys. Until...

Rick walks up to the front.

RICK

I have some not so pleasant news, but

bear with me. (Off a prepared statement)

Lately, local police have raided some

houses of `ill repute' and a number of

`ladies of the evening' have been taken

into custody. While the credibility of

these witnesses is questionable,

apparently photo line-ups have been made

available to them.

Rick eyes Kathy, pointedly.

RICK (CONT'D)

This issue is currently receiving a lot

of attention. Guys, you gotta be

careful... Kathryn Bolkovac is heading up

this investigation. If you have any

questions refer them to her.

ALL EYES ON KATHY. They disperse, passing her, camaraderie

obliterated. Kathy walks, livid...

KATHY

You've given every officer time to create

an alibi.

RICK

I'm not going to subject my men to this

witch hunt based on the testimony of some

hookers! Prostitution is illegal! Your

witnesses are criminals.

Kathy can't believe what he's saying.

KATHY

They are SLAVES. By any American or

International law.

TWB 74.

RICK

These slaves are lying about their

presence in Bosnia. You are coming after

American Officers with baseless claims.

KATHY

...you know they're not baseless.

RICK JONES

If you've got a problem, go call the

Ambassador's wife.

156   INT./EXT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - EVENING                           156

ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. Kathy comes out. Seeing... IPTF

OFFICERS. All eyeing her. She hurries through them.

157   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              157

Kathy sits, anxious. Jan touches her back.

JAN

They hired you to do a job they don't

want done. It's a P.R. position.

She turns to him.

KATHY

Rick publicly outed me, jeopardizing

those girls. I have to go over his head.

But I... I never thought I'd have to go

into Internal Affairs. The guys back home

would never understand this.

JAN

I understand you.

KATHY

Yeah? And how long do you plan on being

around, because the last two guys who

said that aren't here.

JAN

Don't.

KATHY

It's just I waited so long you know. I

want my kids to know I did something, to

be proud.

JAN

They are.

TWB 75.

KATHY

No. Your kids are proud. You go on this

mission and you're a big hero. I go and

I'm a bad mother... (tearing up) I can't

believe I'm gonna disappoint them again.

JAN

So don't.

He comes closer. She looks up. Decided.

158   INT./EXT. CAR - PARKING LOT - UNMHQ - EARLY MORNING        158

A blast of light through Kathy's windshield. The lot is

empty. She looks at a PILE OF REPORTS on the passenger seat.

159   INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING                       159

Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an

OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she

bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall,

focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

160   INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING           160

Kathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her,

knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches

a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front.

MALE MONITOR

What can I do for you?

The Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then

KATHY

It's, I need to speak in-camera with a

senior IA official. I don't have a name,

but--

Kathy recognizes Peter Ward working in a back OFFICE. He sees

her, then closes the door.

MALE MONITOR

Just a moment please.

161   INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY        161

Kathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s. He skims through

the reports, nodding.

TWB 76.

KATHY

I did a photo ID line-up with victims who

testified to international patronizing of

brothels, as well as complicity in

trafficking itself.

He looks at her.

KATHY (CONT'D)

All the cases I filed to my superiors

have come back, shut down. Some of them

were marked as referred to IA.

OFFICIAL

I haven't seen those.

KATHY

Really?

He shakes his head, standing.

OFFICIAL

It's possible they're still in the

pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm

sorry to have to rush this, but I have to

get to a meeting. Thanks for coming in.

He hands her a form.

OFFICIAL (CONT'D)

You need to sign here, that you're asking

for these investigations.

162   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          162

Kathy jogs along a ridge, with a view high over Sarajevo.

Determined, panting... she pushes past her fatigue.

163   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                    163

Kathy comes in, soaked in sweat. The PHONE RINGS. She rushes

to it. CALLER ID: Unknown Number. She picks up, breathless.

KATHY

Hello?... Sorry, who is this?... Just one

second...

She grabs a pen and pad. Writing: THE HOLIDAY INN. 513.

KATHY (CONT'D)

Can I get your name? Hello? Hello?

She looks at the phone, spooked.

TWB 77.

164   INT. LOBBY - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY               164

Kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid

lunches and diplomats. She keeps her head low, focused

ON THE ELEVATORS

Ding. The doors open. Kathy steps in. As they close... TWO

DIPLOMATS slip in. The elevator ascends. Kathy stares dead

ahead.

165   INT. HALLWAY - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                    165

Kathy stands at door 513. She takes a moment, then knocks.

166   INT. HOTEL ROOM - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                 166

Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative,

unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a

burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes

betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into

this world. He seems nervous.

KATHY

That was you today, in IA?

PETER WARD

(nodding) Would you like a drink?

Kathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

I saw your files...

Kathy nods. Peter slaps down a file. Kathy looks at it.

KATHY

What's this?

PETER WARD

Your file.

KATHY

I don't understand.

PETER WARD

They're investigating you.

Kathy stares at him.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

Don't you get it? They're circling the

wagons... What did he tell you? He hadn't

seen anything from you until today.

TWB 78.

She nods.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

Bullshit. Top Level Dyncorp commanders

are walking into IA and removing your

files. I've been told to shut down all

your investigations.

KATHY

Why?.. There has to be some sort of an

international court or body that can turn

this around--

PETER WARD

The United Nations. You're here.

Peter thinking about how to put this...

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

Dyncorp's contract with the State

Department in Bosnia alone is worth 52

million dollars. We're paid ninety, a

hundred grand, right?. But it's a drop in

the ocean compared to their profits. This

is a global corporation, top five defense

contractors in the states after

Halliburton and KB&R. You think they're

gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?

KATHY

I don't want a scandal. I just want--

PETER WARD

NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU. It's designed

that way. No oversight. No national or

international accountability.

KATHY

Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--

PETER WARD

Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State

Department. That includes you... So if

something were to happen to you it

wouldn't even make the news at home... No

one would ever know... Poof. You're gone.

Kathy sits. Scared. Finally understanding the world she's in.

O.S. VOICES. Kathy jolts. Peter moves to the door.

THROUGH THE EYE-HOLE: A COUPLE checks in across the room.

Peter turns back. Sees a panic-stricken Kathy.

TWB 79.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

If you're going to keep going, you've got

to stay under the radar. Make copies of

all your files, keep them under lock and

key. Just... Be careful... And know who

you're up against.

167   EXT. PARKING LOT - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY         167

Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She

looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched.

TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a

car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them

as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to...

HER SUV. Her pulse RACING. PARANOID. She checks around...

The lot is empty. Quiet. She is alone.

168   EXT. UNITED NATIONS MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                168

A row of international flags flap in the wind.

169   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SAME                            169

Kathy watches the flags. She shifts her gaze to the bulletin

board. Eyeing the picture of Raya. Then... she moves to...

THE FILE CABINET. She pulls out   EVERY FILE. Photocopies them.

Then... Opens the bottom filing   cabinet -- pushes files to

the front -- placing the copies   in the back. She steps

away... Closes the Cabinet. And   locks it...

Knowing she is operating outside of protocol now.

170   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - EVENING                       170

Raya stares at herself in a mirror. Dressed as a whore.

171   INT. OASIS BAR - EVENING                                      171

It's more of a medium-sized hall. A bar, some tables and a

few `home touches'. Maps of Yugoslavia. Pictures of Tito.

And FULL OF IPTF. Raya walks through, ogled. She sees...

Luba, sitting on Mara's lap. Surrounded by TEN IRISH

SOLDIERS. The soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them

with charm. Luba blends in with remarkable ease.

RORY

You feel like a party?

RORY, Irish, grabs Raya's hand.

TWB 80.

RAYA

(forcing) Yes... of course.

He leads her to the back of the bar. Raya looks to Luba, but

realizes she is alone.

They walk through a BACK DOOR into a ROOM FULL OF BEDS

SEPARATED with CURTAINS. We barely make out the shapes of

various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. All busy. Until

A curtain opens... And Jim Higgins walks out. His rite of

passage complete.

Rory pulls Raya to the cubicle, as Julia comes out.

172   EXT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - EVENING                              172

Halyna boards a plane with PASSENGERS, but without Raya.

173   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               173

Kathy opens the door into the empty apartment, seeing a

RAPIDLY BLINKING LIGHT on a digital display: 14 MESSAGES.

ANSWERING MACHINE

Click. Click. Click.

Each message a silence followed by a hang-up. Kathy stares at

the blinking light as the clicks keep coming. CLICK, CLICK,

CLICK... She rips the machine out of the wall.

174   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATER                               174

We hear a DIAL UP CONNECTION. Kathy's at her computer. She

brings up a Yahoo! Search page. TYPES IN: RICK JONES

2103 Matches for Rick Jones.

She types again. CLOSE ON: RICK JONES + COLORADO SPRINGS

482 Matches for Rick Jones + Colorado Springs

She scans down the page. None of the matches work. She shakes

her head, about to give up, when...

Chief of Police R. Jones in $1,000,000 Law Suit

A PICTURE of Rick Jones accompanies the article.

CLOSE ON WORDS: Richard Jones Fired for Sexual Harassment

TWB 81.

175   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                     175

Kathy sits at the empty kitchen table looking at the picture

of her kids. She holds her head in her hands.

176   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT    176

Distant music echoes through the night. VOICES of GUYS

hanging out on their balconies. Kathy crosses the lot,

cutting through the dark night fog.

177   INT./EXT. SUV/ROAD - NIGHT                                    177

Kathy drives. Wide awake. The only vehicle on the road.

178   EXT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   178

Kathy sits in the SUV. Staring at the station. THROUGH THE

WINDOW... Jan works the late shift alone.

179   INT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   179

Jan and Kathy sit. Several empty coffee cups.

KATHY

This is... I can't believe your timing...

JAN

It's a rotation. They're sending us back

a month early. I tried to get an

extension, but...

Kathy just stares ahead. Silent... a long time.

KATHY

I'm not even sure I'm staying.

Jan sits back. Stunned.

KATHY (CONT'D)

These guys... Jones is a sexual offender.

Dyncorp hired him... These private

militaries are a sham. There's no way

around them.

JAN

If that's what your instincts are telling

you...

KATHY

I have children, I have to think about

them...

TWB 82.

180   INT. OASIS BAR - LATE NIGHT                                  180

A big IPTF PARTY. AT THE BAR: Raya waits with an empty tray.

Luba pulls out a heavy crate of bottles. She hurts her back.

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

Here, I'll help you.

Luba slams two bottles on Raya's tray.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

I'm fine. I earned this job.

RAYA

I was just trying to--

LUBA

Don't. You'll get us in trouble.

An IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes

her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine..

MIKE SEARS

How's my favorite girl?

RAYA

I am good. Everything good.

She smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia

and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered.

SUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT)

I wanna party all night.

The girls smile, nodding, playing along...

SUIT 2 (AMERICAN)

Let's go out. I wanna take you home.

He squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily.

SUIT 2 (CONT'D)

Ivan! C'mere!

Raya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host.

SUIT 2 (CONT'D)

We wanna party on mate. How much to take

them home for the day?

Ivan eyes the girls. Thinking...

TWB 83.

IVAN

Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra

deposit. But you cannot take her.

He points at Raya.

IVAN (CONT'D)

Three thousand each. (off their scoffing)

You bring back, you get back deposit.

Ivan smiles. The other two men are dubious. But Suit 1 and

Suit 2 exchange glances... Daring each other.

SUIT 1

You're on.

Ivan waves to follow him. They walk with Julia and Tanya.

Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him.

Julia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise.

181   EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING                                     181

The DUTCH CONTINGENT boards a bus. Kathy stands aside with

Jan. Saying goodbye... Franz pats Jan on the back.

FRANZ

I'll keep an eye out.

Jan shakes his hand. Franz winks at Kathy.

FRANZ (CONT'D)

(to Kathy) It's finally our time.

She smiles, soft. Drained of energy.

JAN

Get outta here.

FRANZ

Anything you need you call, okay? He'll

kill both of us if you don't.

Franz moves away leaving the two alone. Jan hugs Kathy.

JAN

You come to me... when you're done.

He kisses her. The bus engines start.

182   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                            182

What's this I hear about you leaving?

Kathy turns to Madeleine in the doorway.

KATHY

How'd you--

MADELEINE

The Dutch Officer rang before he left.

C'mon, I want to show you something.

Kathy follows, downbeat.

183   INT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                     183

The girls clean. Raya sweeps, watching Mara teach Luba how to

restock the bar. Ivan comes out of the OFFICE. A bag in hand.

184   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                            184

Madeleine's UN Volkswagon pulls up. Milena waits, smiling.

MADELEINE

After we got Irka repatriated, I had some

calls from other private parties that

were interested in helping. We've

gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for

matching funds, so that... we can

completely rebuild this shelter.

MILENA

Separate from the GDA. We run it our way.

The victims come first.

MADELEINE

Things are changing Kathy.

Kathy is moved, seeing a light at the end of this. The three

women stand, united... Then... A SHELTER VOLUNTEER comes out.

SHELTER VOLUNTEER

There's an important call inside.

MILENA

Excuse me.

SHELTER VOLUNTEER

No. The call is for Kathy.

185   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                     185

Ivan puts a bag in a car trunk. He turns to... Mara

TWB 85.

IVAN (RUSSIAN)

Remember I can bring you back here the

second you fuck up.

Mara nods. He shakes her hand. Ivan hands her a passport. She

jumps into the car. It's an odd farewell. Ivan heads back to

THE OASIS

He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan

nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role.

SUDDENLY... HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up.

The two SUITS from last night appear at the door... Without

the girls.

186   INT./EXT. KATHY'S UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                   186

Kathy slows... Seeing local police in the distance.

187   EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE SARAJEVO - CONTINUOUS                 187

Kathy pulls up. Through gathered local cops, REVEAL...

Julia and Tanya. Disoriented. Still in last night's clothing.

188   EXT. ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER                                 188

Julia and Tanya are FRANTIC, talking fast.

JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)

They take us home. They were so drunk. We

run.

TANYA (BROKEN ENGLISH)

There are more girls! You must to get

them out! Go now!

They appeal to Kathy.

JULIA

Oasis Bar. In mountains.

Kathy eyes Viko. As the girls talk at her, Kathy knows she

was never going home. THIS is where she needs to be.

189   INT. HALLWAY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                     189

Kathy brings Julia and Tanya in. An Intern leads them down

the hall. Viko comes in...

VIKO

Should I call for a raid?

TWB 86.

KATHY

No. He'll walk. We have no proof they

were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See

what else they know.

190   INT. OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SHORT TIME LATER                  190

Laura watches video footage on a TV. Halyna appears on the

monitor. Her assistant PAUSES it.

ASSISTANT

That's their first cut. I'll pass on your

notes, and they should have it ready for

the grant proposal in time.

A KNOCK at the door.

191   INT. LOBBY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                      191

Kathy stands, curt now with Laura. All business.

KATHY

I have no options right now. The GDA is

more secure than Milena's shelter... Can

they stay before you do the paperwork?

LAURA LEVIN

They'll go on record?

Kathy nods. Laura shrugs in assent.

192   INT. KITCHEN - GDA BOSNIA - LATER                            192

Kathy listens to a tearful Julia.

JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)

Ivan is good friends with the soldiers.

They come all the time.

KATHY

And you're saying these soldiers brought

you into Bosnia. Through the border?

You're sure?

JULIA

Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours.

They both nod. Emphatic. Kathy thinks...

KATHY

They had uniforms? Like mine?

The girls nod again. Absolutely sure.

TWB 87.

JULIA

April 8. I never forget. The day I leave

my home. We come to Bosnia some day

later. I know because we stop at the

border. We were six of us. Men from the

border, they opened the doors... We give

them our fake passports. My name was

Irena Woycek. I thought they would see

the fake passports, I thought...

She hesitates, the memories flooding back...

JULIA (CONT'D)

I thought they would save us.

193   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - DAY                                        193

Viko follows Kathy out.

VIKO

If there are records showing those girls

came through the border with IPTF--

KATHY

Then you have conspiracy to traffick.

And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's

enough to do a raid that will stick.

VIKO

The main border station keeps the logs.

Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an

old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car).

194   INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT                                   194

The ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine...

VIKO

Best if it looks like a local matter. Get

more info. You be my UN monitor, okay?

Kathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help.

195   EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT                           195

Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac

Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson

frolicking in foamy surf.

VIKO

So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep

all this on file here?

TWB 88.

BORDER COP

Of course! It's our fucking job!

VIKO

And other stations up the border send all

their files to you?

BORDER COP

Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.

Disappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop.

BORDER COP (CONT'D)

You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo?

Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky

guy in their archives loves to send

files.

Kathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking...

BORDER COP (CONT'D)

Okay, 11th... (mumbling) ... No, no. You

like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian

police do boring things?

Kathy smiles. He turns back, clicking. Then stops.

BORDER COP (CONT'D)

You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in

back. Stanley Harris.

He turns proudly to them.

BORDER COP (CONT'D)

What you think? All his little sisters

come to visit from America?

Viko looks knowingly at Kathy.

KATHY

That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.

He slaps a key. The file prints out on an old daisy-wheel

printer. Kathy scans the pages...

196   EXT. BORDER STATION - MOMENTS LATER                           196

Kathy and Viko hurry to the car.

KATHY

We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner.

The border log corroborates the victims'

testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid

his place and get those girls out.

TWB 89.

Kathy jumps INSIDE THE CAR...

KATHY (CONT'D)

The raid has to be small. No-one knows

the bar till we're on our way.

197   INT. RECEPTION - BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - EVENING        197

Kathy waits, nervous, holding the border logs. The

RECEPTIONIST eyes her.

RECEPTIONIST

He shouldn't be long now.

198   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                      198

Bill on the edge of his desk. Kathy paces, frantic...

KATHY

That's why I came straight to you. They

were brought across the border by our

guys. I need two back-up security vans

for a raid, with well-trained--

BILL HYNES

Our resources are tight. I have to

prioritize--

KATHY

(holding the border logs) This is real

evidence. And that's just a drop in the

ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos,

corroborated statements. We can build

this case and get the perpetrators out of

the mission--

Bill shakes his head.

BILL HYNES

If I could give you a piece of advice it

would be to think of the future.

KATHY

These girls--

BILL HYNES

Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War.

It's nothing new. Every conflict produces

them.

KATHY

You know as well as I do, those girls

aren't a product of the war.

(MORE)

TWB 90.

KATHY (CONT'D)

They're a product of the peace. For the

peace-keepers.

Kathy is repulsed. Bill takes a seat.

BILL HYNES

This is your first mission. You're eager.

But we work in a very grey area and that

can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to

take the gloves off but they don't want

us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking

Catch-22. So what do we do? We

prioritize. We do our best and we always

look at the bigger picture. You're a

mother. Fine. I see what you're doing

with these girls. Maybe that's why you're

thinking with your heart not your head.

But you have a chance at a career in the

international sector. Ride this out. Get

a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia,

Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And

then, when you're running the show, you

can implement whatever changes you see

fit. But right now be smart and shut this

bullshit down!

The veil is lifted. Kathy stands frozen. The blunt workings

of the machine are laid bare.

199   EXT. PLAZA - UNMHQ - DAY                                      199

Kathy leans on a balcony overlooking the main plaza at HQ.

She observes the sleek facade of honor and power.

She straightens, and walks away without looking back.

200   INT. LOCAL CANTON STATION - NIGHT                             200

A RAID TEAM suits up: FIVE LOCAL COPS and THREE IPTF

OFFICERS. Viko turns and hands Kathy a helmet.

KATHY

(to Viko and other cops) Try and get him

outside first, then arrest him. Once

you've got him outta there we'll go in. I

want the girls to know they're safe.

201   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          201

A police vans SPEEDS down the road. TWO UN VANS follow.

202   INT. UN VAN - SAME                                            202

Kathy focuses in the cabin filled with SUITED IPTF OFFICERS.

TWB 91.

203   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        203

Viko pulls up to the bar. The UN SUV skids into the shadows.

Viko and Danik go inside. Kathy glances back at her IPTF

officers as they -- Pull their visors down, and WAIT -- Quiet

-- Wind in the trees -- MUSIC ECHOING from inside as...

Viko and Danik emerge, chatting with Ivan. Suddenly...

Ivan jolts back -- COPS grab him -- He's YELLING --

HANDCUFFED -- Kicking. Punching -- They PUSH him into the VAN

-- Viko SLAMS the door, turns to the UN van and nods...

204   INT. UN VAN - CONTINUOUS                                      204

Kathy looks back to the IPTF officers, raises three

fingers... then TWO...ONE...

The POLICE VAN SQUEALS AWAY, as...

They SLAM open the doors of the bar and RUSH INTO...

205   INT. OASIS BAR - CONTINUOUS                                   205

BURSTING in the doors -- Clients scatter -- RUSH to the EXITS

Girls turn from the bar, the stage, the seating area --

disoriented -- eyes darting...

Local police spread around the bar, slamming, pushing clients

outside. Kathy pulls off her helmet and SCANS the room.

VIKO

We have a warrant to search this

premises. The owner of this bar Ivan

Bladzic has been arrested and taken into

custody for human trafficking.

The girls look at one another. Is this for real? The BARMAN

steps forward... He looks like he's had a few drinks.

BARMAN

Fuck you!

Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear...

Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these

girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction.

KATHY

You do not have to be afraid of Ivan

Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now.

TWB 92.

But the GIRLS don't move...

Kathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees...

Raya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One

last shred left of the dream of escape...

Kathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba.

Then to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw...

BARMAN (BROKEN ENGLISH)

These girls work here. They have all

documents, passports! You can fuck off.

Two local cops GRAB him. Danik CUFFS him.

The girls are astounded. Viko holds up passports.

VIKO

Fakes. Bad ones.

The barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending

on Raya... her faith awakening.

KATHY

We want to get you out of here safely.

That is my absolute priority.

The girls exchange a flurry of looks, speaking volumes...

Should we trust her? Can we risk it?

KATHY (CONT'D)

(To Viko) Get those blankets out of the

vans. Let's get these girls out.

But the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with

despair... After all she has been through, all the

punishment, all the pain...

Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced...

And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When...

Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears.

He stares at Raya. Petrifying her.

Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her

gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out

of earshot of the others...

TWB 93.

KATHY (CONT'D)

You just have to tell me you want to go.

That you do not work here voluntarily.

And we will get you to safety.

Raya wants so badly to answer.

KATHY (CONT'D)

You can leave with me this second. All of

you can. But I need you to say it.

Raya eyes Mike Sears - He looks to Luba. Luba turns back to

Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it.

KATHY (CONT'D)

You know me.

Raya can't look at Kathy. Tears stream down her face.

KATHY (CONT'D)

You can all leave with me! (to Raya)

Let's go.

Raya. With her heart breaking...

RAYA

No.

Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between

Mike and Kathy... And she understands...

Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him

to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall.

KATHY

Who the fuck are you? What have you done?

What's wrong with you? What's wrong with

you? You fuck!

Mike pushes back...

MIKE

Get off me, you crazy bitch!

KATHY

They're supposed to TRUST US!

Viko and Danik pull them apart.

VIKO

C'mon Kathy. It's over.

TWB 94.

She steps back -- Catching her breath -- Shaking her head --

NOT AGAIN... She looks at Raya, tears streaming down her

terrified face...

KATHY

I know this girl. I know her. We can't

leave them here. We're supposed to--

VIKO

If they won't come, we can't force them.

Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be

returned and punished... Do you want

blood on your hands?

The girls all return to their positions behind the bar,

cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch...

Kathy's eye. She glares at Mike Sears.

Kathy watches across the room, devastated...

As Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits

to a back room.

206   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        206

Kathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild.

Viko comes out the door, as it hits her like a blunt kick in

the face: sheer helplessness...

She TURNS - Fuck diplomacy, Fuck bureaucracy, Fuck protocol -

and RUSHES back towards the bar. Viko stops her, grabs her...

Kathy's eyes filling with tears she cannot cry -- Her heart

breaking. Viko holds her tight, and pulls her away.

207   INT./EXT. UN VAN - NIGHT                                      207

Kathy sits in total silence, her face white, staring ahead.

208   INT. BATHROOM - OASIS BAR - NIGHT                             208

Raya crouches in a corner, stifling her sobs.

209   INT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               209

Halyna pours water into a kettle. IN THE LIVING ROOM a TV

shows footage of the GDA DOCUMENTARY:

THE GDA logo spins. Footage of Halyna ON SCREEN:

TWB 95.

HALYNA (ON TV) (BROKEN ENGLISH)

It took me very long time to realize

there was name for this of

trafficking...that there are big

organizations like GDA who work for

against this crime all these years.

WE SEE FOOTAGE OF THE GDA OFFICE. The place is busy, the

staff members look sharp and efficient. CLOSE ON: LAURA

210   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - UNHCR - SAME                    210

Madeleine watches the same footage. CLOSE ON SCREEN: Laura.

LAURA LEVIN (ON SCREEN)

With renewed funding support from USAID,

the Global Displacement Agency continues

to be the pioneering leader in

international counter-trafficking.

Milena sits by Madeleine. Both saddened realizing...

MILENA

And our matching funds go to the GDA.

MADELEINE

(shaking her head) The State Department

money monster. Ironic, isn't it? That the

very people whose money we need to fund a

shelter to protect these girls, are the

exact people they need protecting from.

She turns up the TV, onto... HALYNA'S INTERVIEW...

O.S. A KETTLE WHISTLES

211   INT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - SAME                                211

Halyna puts tea leaves in a strainer. Listening to a TV in

the adjoining living room. Where FOOTAGE OF THE GDA plays.

GIRLS VOICE #1 (O.S.) (BROKEN ENGLISH)

...My husband tell me, I will be gone one

month. His friend arrange for me a job.

But his friend bought me for two thousand

dollars.

Halyna pours water through the strainer.

GIRLS VOICE #2 (O.S.) (BROKEN ENGLISH)

My sister arrange for my papers. Her

boyfriend did this for 12 other girls...

Halyna puts down the kettle. An ACADEMIC SPEAKS on TV...

TWB 96.

ACADEMIC

More often than not, traffickers prey on

those they know. Banking on the fact that

a girl will trust them. Traffickers are

fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles and

aunts...

Halyna's face whitens. It hits her...

212   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - DAY                        212

Halyna glares at Zenia, who heaves tears.

ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)

I wanted to tell you--

Halyna silences her with her hand. She walks around the

apartment, taking it all in. The money is in the details. An

LCD TV, DVD player. Halyna's hand traces over the things...

HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)

It's how you pay for this...

ZENIA

Roman, he does... I'm--

Halyna stiffens. An anger she thought impossible. She grabs a

vase. She wants to throw it at Zenia, but at the last minute

she throws it into a wall. Zenia falls as the vase SMASHES.

HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)

How. Could. You... Sell your own blood...

tu xorobo... Where is she?

ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)

I don't know.

HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)

Where is she?! Where is she!? Whe--

Roman walks in. Halyna lunges at him. He knocks her onto the

ground. Zenia crawls to her sister. Roman steps between them.

ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)

She is no longer your sister. Stay away

from me! Stay away from her!

Halyna spits in his face. He smacks her. She lifts her hand

to punch him, but he grabs it and pushes her out the door.

ON THE STREET

Halyna bends over, heaving. She runs at the door, banging on

it. PEDESTRIANS stare. A lunatic's rage in Halyna's eyes.

TWB 97.

213   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                213

Kathy holds the phone. Her hands shake. Tears streaming.

ERIN (O.S.)

Mom, what's wrong?

KATHY

Erin?... No... Nothing's wrong. I just

needed to... I needed to say I'm sorry...

I'm sorry if you ever felt I wasn't there

for you, but... I love you.

Kathy can't keep it in anymore. She let's go and cries it all

out, to the one person she wanted to be so strong for.

214   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                214

Kathy stares at her computer... She presses NEW MESSAGE.

CLOSE ON A BLANK EMAIL, THE "TO" LINE IS EMPTY.

Kathy types. We see the following addresses: "UN CHIEF OF

STAFF", "HIGH COMMISSIONER BOSNIA", "UN SECRETARY"...

She continues typing. CLOSE ON THE SUBJECT LINE:

DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY CONSCIENCE

Kathy pours her heart into the keyboard. As she types...

KATHY (V.O.)

I am a police officer obligated to report

crimes. I have taken statements from

women describing their physical,

psychological, and emotional torture...

215   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK ROOM - LATE NIGHT                       215

The girls sleep. Raya lies awake crying.

KATHY (V.O.)

...On arriving in Bosnia these women are

sold, and forced to provide sexual

services...

216   EXT. BORDER STATION - NIGHT                                   216

An IPTF VAN stops. The window rolls down: It's Mike Sears.

TWB 98.

KATHY (V.O.)

...Their clientele consists of SFOR,

IPTF, local police, and International

employees. Worse, they have become

involved in the trade itself.

217   EXT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              217

Halyna sits at an empty table. Her face gaunt from worry.

KATHY (V.O.)

...It is time each and every one of you

realize this is a serious organized

crime, with enormous profits.

218   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - NIGHT                            218

The Oasis Barman dumps a STACK of DOLLARS on the counter.

Fills out a form. Ivan Bladzic is released by a COP.

KATHY (V.O.)

You are peace keepers who came to protect

the innocent but now prey upon them in

the worst ways possible...

219   INT. MARKET - NIGHT                                          219

Lines of YOUNG GIRLS. A BUYER approaches one of them. She

closes her eyes, too tired to fight.

KATHY

It is time to face the truth of what is

happening. We can right our wrongs, and

move forward, ashamed, but accountable

and transparent...

220   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               220

Kathy finishes typing...

KATHY (V.O.)

We may be accused of thinking with our

hearts instead of our heads, but we will

have our integrity.

We pull back as she sits in front of the computer. Nothing

but the screen illuminating her face...

221   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - MORNING                      221

The girls can't sleep. THE DOOR OPENS. Luba comes in, quickly

closing the door behind her. She rushes to Raya.

TWB 99.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

He's coming back in the morning. He's

furious. Convinced you will talk.

The other girls rally around, supportive. Raya shakes. Luba

looks into her eyes, suddenly melting.

RAYA (UKRAINIAN)

But I didn't say anything. I won't say

anything. I didn't... (SOBBING)

Luba holds her tight. Their friendship not buried after all.

Luba unlocks a window, and gives her some money.

LUBA

He's gonna kill you. Go! Go!

Raya's eyes widen. Terrified. She jumps out into the unknown.

222   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - MORNING                              222

Kathy buttons up her uniform. Logging into her email...

MAILBOX FULL

In the INBOX: EMAIL after EMAIL. All with the same subject:

RE: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY

CONSCIENCE

223   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY       223

Blakely, Rick and JOHN MORGAN, 50s, State Department, stands

behind a FUMING Bill Hynes. He throws down Kathy's email.

BILL HYNES

What is this?

KATHY

An email I wrote.

Bill suppresses his anger. He holds out his hand... Blakely

hands him a document. Bill places it before Kathy.

BILL HYNES

The actions I am taking are for your own

benefit. We are seeking your repatriation

back to the United States.

KATHY

(stunned) You can't--

BILL HYNES

I'm doing this for your own good.

TWB 100.

Kathy eyes him, her gaze shifting to Morgan.

BILL HYNES (CONT'D)

Right now, we are still willing to pay

your way home. You need to sign this, to

start your check-out procedure. You will

be out of this mission by Sunday.

KATHY

No.

She leaves. Without signing anything.

224   INT./ EXT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - AFTERNOON               224

THROUGH THE WINDOW: Kathy paces, nervous, telling all...

Madeleine stands, resolved. Says something. Kathy nods,

skeptical. Madeleine picks up the PHONE.

225   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                       225

Madeline slams the door, having burst in. She stops. Squaring

off with Bill. Two WARRIORS. Bill keeps calm...

BILL HYNES

I'm starting to get a fucking headache.

All your people do is gender...

MADELEINE

Right. It is a core function of the

Gender Office.

He looks over, unimpressed.

MADELEINE (CONT'D)

About the memo--

BILL HYNES

The email? It seriously concerned me. The

level of recklessness she used speaks

volumes toward her mental state. This is

for her own good.

MADELEINE

Bullshit. You can't just fire her without

cause. You need a reason that would stand

up in court!

BILL HYNES

She's burned out Madeleine!

MADELEINE

She is not burned out, she's being

burned!

TWB 101.

BILL HYNES

You hired her. You keep her under

control. You've always wanted to run this

your way. But I'm not going to let anyone

interfere with the way I run my mission!

MADELEINE

Then start running it with some

integrity! It's your people perpetrating

crimes against humanity!

She goes to the door furious. But before she leaves...

BILL HYNES

Madeleine. Drop this. It's coming from

above my head.

She stops.

MADELEINE

This is coming from Washington?

BILL HYNES

Yes. They want her out.

Madeleine leaves. Focused. Something up her sleeve.

226   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT                        226

Sulpher lights. Kathy approaches the building. The American

Flags hang from the windows. But it's quiet. Spookily quiet.

Kathy moves quickly. Alert.

Something moves -- Behind A CAR -- Flash of A MAN -- Kathy

picks up her pace -- Eyes forward, but... The Man...

Comes up behind her. Kathy flinches, as... he grabs her. She

turns quick. Realizing... It's Franz.

FRANK

Let's go. Like nothing's wrong.

227   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                         227

Franz takes apart Kathy's phone. Removing... a small DEVICE.

Kathy stares, alarmed. Franz looks around, frantic.

Searching... The COMPUTER. He rushes over. Turns it on...

ON SCREEN: A CURSOR FLASHES... Franz types...

I HAVE FRIENDS IN BRITISH INTEL.

TWB 102.

He points to the ceiling. Kathy eyes the walls... Lingering

over each corner and crack. Franz grabs the keyboard...

PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO YOU.

Kathy watches the screen. Afraid.

228   EXT. DRIVE WAY - SARAJEVO - NIGHT                             228

Franz lays talcum powder under a UN SUV.

229   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - NIGHT                                     229

Franz' house is small, a bit messy. Kathy's on the phone...

KATHY

He's powdering my car.

INTERCUT WITH:

230   INT. JAN'S HOME - THE NETHERLANDS - SAME                      230

Jan shakes his head, horrified he's not there.

JAN

The door handles too? Check thoroughly to

see if there are any prints before you

get in that car tomorrow. Kathy, are you

listening?

Kathy nods. Still grasping what's happening.

KATHY

So you know how we talked about living

together..? It may be a bit sooner than

we planned.

She offers a nervous laugh.

JAN

Kathy, maybe it's time to come home.

She hangs her head. Then... A KNOCK at the DOOR. Kathy turns.

She puts down the phone. Inching forward... EYES ON THE DOOR.

Reaching it, Kathy looks through the EYEHOLE... And exhales.

She opens the door to... Madeleine Rees.

231   FRANZ'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 231

Kathy listens, anxious as Madeleine lays it out...

TWB 103.

MADELEINE

It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You

have signed a contract with Dyncorp

Aerospace Operations U.K... And there is

no provision under English law for

summary dismissal without due process or

an investigation.

Madeleine stops... seeing Kathy is overwhelmed.

MADELEINE (CONT'D)

But there was something else Bill said...

If this is coming from above... Kathy,you

need to prove that they are dismissing

you because you were uncovering wide-

spread corruption within this mission. If

you can prove that this is indeed coming

from Washington, that the State

Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire

you. Then we're talking about a

conspiracy.

KATHY

They tell me... people disappear. They

bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here,

worried there's a bomb in my car--

MADELEINE

We can fight this.

KATHY

This isn't just my career, it's my life.

I don't know if I'm ready to be a

scapegoat.

MADELEINE

That's exactly what you are.

KATHY

Whose?

She eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back.

MADELEINE

I don't know what to say to that. Think

about this. Let me know what you want to

do. I'll support you either way.

232   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - EARLY MORNING                     232

An aerial glide over the mountains of Bosnia.

TWB 104.

233   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK BEDROOM - MORNING                       233

The girls sleep in their cots, when... BAM! Ivan kicks open

the door. He throws Raya in. On the ground. The girls wake.

Ivan. He picks Raya up by the neck. She fights. Luba runs in.

RAYA (RUSSIAN)

I didn't say anything. I never will. Why

are you doing this? I just want to go

home. I want to see... Mama... Mama...

But he kicks Raya in the stomach. She ROARS in pain. He flips

her over. Shaking her. He looks to the other girls. FURIOUS.

IVAN (RUSSIAN)

This all happened because of you.

He pulls out a gun. Raya looks to Luba for help. But it's too

late. Ivan presses the gun to Raya's head.

He glares into Raya's eyes. A flash of ire.

Raya reaches again... Luba steps forward, when... BANG!!!!

217   Raya's body falls. Luba turns away. She cups her hand over    217

her mouth. But a loud cry wails through...

234   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                                 234

The sound of Luba's scream fades over the morning. The wide

horizon is calm. But a closer look reveals...

235   EXT. RIVER - MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                         235

POLICE cordon off a RIVER BANK. Through an opening we see...

Viko. Keeping local cops at bay. Behind him is... Kathy. In

civilian clothes. Standing over a...

DEAD BODY. Raya. Kathy stares, expressionless. Viko clears

the cops out. Kathy turns, and retches. She pulls air into

lungs, then straightens. She looks up to the trees, the apex

of this leafy cathedral, as if invoking some higher power.

236   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             236

Kathy comes in. Madeleine looks up from a phone call.

KATHY

What do I do?

TWB 105.

MADELEINE

Hand in an appeal. Keep reporting to

work. Watch how they respond. Build your

case... And catch them in their lies.

237   INT. UNMHQ - DAY                                              237

Kathy holds an envelope. Hynes' SECRETARY looks at Kathy.

MUFFLED SCREAMING from his office. Kathy leaves the letter.

SECRETARY

Ms. Bolkovac... I, me and the other

secretaries... Your email was the bravest

thing anyone's even done in this mission.

Kathy nods, truly appreciating that. She walks away, her

silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall.

The secretary takes Kathy's letter. Walking into

BILL HYNES' OFFICE

Bill paces around Rick Jones, Ambassador Wells and John

Morgan. Hynes grabs Kathy's letter.

MORGAN

Get something on her! Get anything!

238   INT. PERSONNEL - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                238

Carmen listens to an anxious Kathy.

KATHY

If you could just go into my office, I'll

give you a key to the cabinets...

But Carmen can't even meet Kathy's eye.

CARMEN

Kath... my parents really need the money

I send home. It's a lifesaver for them.

My Dad has medical bills... I'm so sorry.

Kathy nods, understanding but disappointed. She is alone.

239   INT. BOSNIAN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                           239

Out of date, and under-stocked, the store is as spruce as a

little post-war TLC could make it. Kathy stands at a counter,

where a CLERK puts down a chunky PORTABLE CASSETTE RECORDER.

KATHY

You don't have anything smaller?

TWB 106.

240   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                         240

Kathy paces. She holds a tape recorder to the phone.

KATHY

Yes, this is Kathy Bolkovac and--

INTERCUT WITH:

241   EXT. AIRSTRIP - SARAJEVO - CONTINUOUS                           241

Ambassador Wells in ushered toward a UN PLANE. Into a PHONE:

AMBASSADOR WELLS

I can hardly hear you. Can you yell-

KATHY

OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

AMBASSADOR WELLS

YES. GO AHEAD.

KATHY

THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO

DISCUSS MY TERMINATION--

AMBASSADOR WELLS

THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF.

KATHY

OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET

WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME.

AMBASSADOR WELLS

THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU

THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I

CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

The PLANE ENGINES are roaring. Kathy can't hear him. She

slams down the phone. Staring at the recorder. Thinking.

242   INT./EXT.   UN SUV/ UNMHQ PARKING LOT - DAY                     242

Kathy, parked. Rips open a CASSETTE TAPE. She looks at her

personage - this isn't fitting anywhere.

RAIN hits the windshield. The glass becomes blurry in the

haze of water. Kathy grabs a UN windbreaker from the back.

Sticks the recorder in its pocket.

243   INT./EXT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - DAY                                   243

Kathy flashes her UN ID. The guard eyes her. PASSERS-BY also.

TWB 107.

244   INT. HALLWAY - UNMHQ - DAY                                  244

Kathy walks down the hall. Feeling it close in on her.

Turning a corner, to...

KATHY'S OFFICE

Peter Ward stands in front. He can't look her in the eye.

Kathy slips her hand into her pocket. Fumbling... Then looks

up. She's got it. ECU of TAPE WHEELS turning. Kathy moves

forward. Coming closer, she sees behind Peter...

A NOTICE ON THE DOOR: GENDER OFFICE SHUT DOWN.

Peter hands Kathy an envelope. Looking up... Apologetic. She

reads, stunned.

KATHY

Timesheet Violations? They are firing me

for time sheet violations!!!

PETER WARD

You should go.

KATHY

I'm not going anywhere. Not without an

investigation. Madeleine Rees is--

PETER WARD

Hynes has sent a delegate to Vienna to

have Madeleine Rees removed.

Kathy is stopped short.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

State Department auditors are here.

Asking for files on trafficking,

prostitution and time sheets.

Kathy stops. Realizing...

KATHY

Can you repeat that?

He looks around, nervous.

PETER WARD

Look, this is between you and me, but

Dyncorp and the State Department... you

know it's a dual thing, and this is the

action they have taken, whether right or

wrong... I'm being told to do this.

TWB 108.

KATHY

So you're saying the State Department is

instructing Dyncorp to fire me.

Peter nods. And Kathy has what she needs.

KATHY (CONT'D)

Please... can I just go in for one

minute, get my personal belongings.

She eyes him. Knowing who he is inside. He shouldn't... But

Peter opens the door. Kathy goes in

KATHY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Closes the door behind her. Rushing   -- to the File Cabinet --

takes out her keys -- TO THE BOTTOM   DRAWER -- Kathy pushes

back FRONT FILES -- Takes FILES OUT   -- Looking around -- --

She grabs a GYM BAG -- STUFFS IN AS   MANY FILES AS SHE CAN.

She zips up the bag. Looks at the door. Still closed. She...

TAKES OUT HER TAPE RECORDER. Huddles down behind her desk...

PRESSES PLAY. But all she hears is FUZZ.

PETER WARD

Kathy.

She turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

Scrambling devices.

She looks at him, waiting for his next move. His eyes soften.

PETER WARD (CONT'D)

It probably won't work in most of the

rooms. Now c'mon. Get out of here.

She smiles, silently thanking him. She shoves the recorder in

her pocket. Grabs the bag. Thrown by it's heaviness. Peter

helps her get it on her shoulder.

He ushers her out. Locking the door behind them. They move

DOWN THE HALL

When Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal.

IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into

THE ELEVATOR

Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag.

An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns...

TWB 109.

Again slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined.

RICK JONES

I'm gonna tell you this in front of him

and everybody else, you no longer have a

UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You

do not have a job with the Department of

State. The Department of State holds your

contract. They are the ones who are

pulling it. You will not have an appeal.

You will not have a hearing. You will not

have anything. Do you understand?

Kathy lets the doors close without saying a word...

245   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - MISSION HEADQUARTERS - SAME           245

The lights are off. The office sits untouched. Move over the

bulletin board, still overflowing with faces of girls.

BBC CHIMES. Bill Hynes talks to TIM SEBASTIAN.

BILL HYNES

I can categorically state that not one

United Nations Officer has been involved

in the trafficking of a single woman.

TIM

Are you saying that you believe all these

victims' claims to be false?

BILL HYNES (O.S.)

I don't want to make accusations about

those girls. But I will assert over and

over again, I run a ZERO TOLERANCE

program for that type of activity...

248   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                     248

What do you say to rumors that Dyncorp

are working to have you removed?

MADELEINE

Try me... These raids are for show and

completely amateurish. This is the

biggest cover-up I have ever seen!

252   EXT. BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY                                  252

JOANNA PAUL SMITH (BRITISH ACCENT)

I've been working at Human Rights Watch

for fifteen years. We've been keeping

close tabs on this. No one has come

forward with anything solid before.

KATHY

I have everything you need. When I arrive

in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.

Joanna nods, a glimmer of admiration. Kathy stands, shakes

her hand, and leaves... Disappearing into the crowd.

256   INT./EXT. CAR/ROAD - NIGHT                                    256

Kathy drives alone. Checking the rearview mirror.

A car pulls up behind her. It's bright light blinds Kathy.

The car closes in on her. She winces, but... The car passes.

It's just Kathy on the road. The gym bag on the seat beside

her. The culmination of everything she's been fighting for.

Her red tail lights disappear into a dark mountain tunnel.

MARA (RUSSIAN)

Ivan let you go. This is what you do now.

Luba nods, understanding.

BACK IN THE COURTROOM

Karen squeezes Kathy's hand. Kathy looks to the back of the

courtroom... Erin smiles at Kathy. So proud.

JUDGE SWISS holds up Kathy's TAPE RECORDER...

Kathy straightens. The Judge reads from a VERDICT. Karen's

face lights up. Kathy's won. Jan breathes, relieved.

Mara and Luba sit across from a YOUNG GIRL, 16. The girl

YOUNG GIRL (UKRAINIAN)

You both worked here?

Mara looks at Luba, a 'do or die' look in her eye. Hiding her

shame, she gathers her strength for this lie.

LUBA (UKRAINIAN)

Yes. It will change your life.

AND IN THE COURTROOM

FLASHBULBS pop as Kathy stands... Pleased, but not elated.

The Dyncorp team files out. As the judges stand, one of them

But in this moment, the Judge, Kathy and us... We all know...

She never wanted to win. She just wanted to do her job.

her BBC HARDTALK INTERVIEW with TIM SEBASTIAN. Show...

TIM SEBASTIAN

We talked to Bill Hynes, who was the

senior UN official in Bosnia at the time,

we talked to him a year ago, on this

program about some of your allegations.

He said they weren't true at all. He said

'We've had senior officials from New

York, we've had investigations from the

State Department... I can now

categorically say that not a single UN

official was involved in trafficking'.

KATHY

I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a

false statement.

TIM SEBASTIAN

So you're accusing him of lying. That not

a single word he said is true.

KATHY

I watched that... Yes.

Tim shifts. Kathy sits calm.

TIM SEBASTIAN

Would you do it again?

KATHY

Yes I would. No doubt about it... I would

definitely do it again. I'm not the type

of person who would... As a law

enforcement officer, I am held to a

higher standard.
