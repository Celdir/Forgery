PAN DOWN TO:

POLICEMAN

HANDLER

Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.

PAUL

Thank you.

(to Zozo)

He can get the beer.

2.

ZOZO

(suddenly worried)

Rutaganda's place?

PAUL

What's wrong?

ZOZO

Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You

are safe there.

PAUL

You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.

ZOZO

What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?

PAUL

It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach

it is like the bus to Giterama.

ZOZO

That is why they call it coach?

PAUL

Maybe. But in business class there are

fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.

ZOZO

(impressed)

You have taken business class?

PAUL

Many times.

3.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Turn off.

ZOZO

There is nowhere to turn, sir.

PAUL

Slow down.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Boys, do you know the way to Mr.

Rutagunda's warehouse?

MILITIA MAN #1

It is one more mile on this road.

PAUL

This is thirsty work, let me treat you to

some beers.

GEORGE

You will join us at the rally today?

4.

PAUL

I will try my best George but these days

I have no time for rallies or politics.

GEORGE

Politics is power, Paul. And money.

PAUL

Time is money, George. We need extra beer

today.

GEORGE

Business is good at the hotel?

PAUL

Very good.

GEORGE

I am always glad to see you Paul.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!

DRIVER

But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...

GEORGE

Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.

(to Paul)

I won't charge extra.

PAUL

Thank you.

GEORGE

A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents

each, I'll get a dollar.

PAUL

At least.

5.

PAUL

The ice has melted!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Don't. Let's go.

PAUL

Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract

attention to yourself.

ZOZO

Boss, some of those men are my neighbors,

they know I'm Tutsi.

P

PAUL

Here, Zozo, for your trouble.

6.

PAUL (V.O.)

Pull up at the front door.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(urgent, to the valet)

Help Zozo.

PAUL

(re: spilled water)

Gregoire. Take care of this.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Gregoire!   See to this right away.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's an emergency, sir.

7.

BIK

Paul!

PAUL

Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.

ZOZO

Any of them make it?

HEAD CHEF

Into the sink!

ZOZO

Twelve are dead.

PAUL

How dead?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill

them will ah, a stuffing, something

local.

COOK

Cassava, and Tipali.

PAUL

Yes. Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a

cassava and Tipali crush'.

8.

PAUL

Mr. Ambassador, please come in.

US AMBASSADOR

Thank you, Paul.

PAUL

Colonel Oliver, you are very welcome.

US AMBASSADOR

Colonel. I'd like you to meet Mr. Colson,

of our Regional Aid Division.

US AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)

Colonel Oliver is the liason officer for

the U.N. peace keeping forces.

PAUL

Please, serve the hors d'ouvres now.

9.

WAITER

General Bizimungu wants to see you.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Paul, this scotch is exceptional.

PAUL

It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I

thought you'd like it. Anything you need,

gentlemen, let me know.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.

BENEDICT

Paul, Paul, a moment please.

PAUL

Yes, Benedict, what can I do?

BENEDICT

Can you get me into the Ambassador's

reception?

PAUL

I'm sorry, it's a private function.

BENEDICT

At least tell me who is attending. The

newspaper will be grateful.

10.

PAUL

I will be grateful if you keep my name

out of your newspaper. Wait here and you

will see who has attended as they leave.

PAUL

(to the coat check)

Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase?

COAT CHECK

Yes, sir.

PAUL

Take it to the bar storeroom. Put three

bottles of Glenmorangie...

he writes it down on a pad)

...GLEN-MOR-AN-GIE, into it.

ONNIE DENVER (O.S.)

Oh, Paul, Paul

CONNIE DENVER

Paul, Paul. Our trip has been cancelled.

PAUL

Yes, I'm sorry Madame Denver, it is

because of the rebels.

CONNIE DENVER

Rebels? What rebels?

11.

BOB

Don't be stupid for Christ sake. The

Watusis are invading the country. I told

you not to come here.

PAUL

The Tutsi rebels are far away on the

border. And soon there will be peace.

BOB

Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you.

CONNIE DENVER

But I came here to see the gorillas?

PAUL

I will try to arrange something.

US AMBASSADOR

Things will calm down when the president

signs the peace agreement with the

rebels.

COLONEL OLIVER

Our intelligence, Mr. Ambassador, is that

the Hutu government has been stockpiling

weapons and are preparing a massacre.

US AMBASSADOR

That's not what I hear. Excuse me. Paul.

Paul comes over)

Colonel, you know the house manager, Paul

Rusesabagina.

PAUL

How was your meal, sir?

US AMBASSADOR

Magnificent.

reads)

Scottish lobster, in Rwanda. You see

General what a genius this man is. You

want anything, this man can get it?

COLONEL OLIVER

How about a battalion of U.S. Marines.

12.

US AMBASSADOR

Now, General, don't ask for the

impossible.

PAUL

I have heard, Mr. Ambassador, that they

have discovered oil here, under Lake

Kivu.

COLONEL OLIVER

You're right, Mr. Ambassador, Paul knows

how to get anything, even U.S. troops.

US AMBASSADOR

Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul.

13.

GREGOIRE

Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some

of them can fly.

he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat

PAUL

No.

(points to Gregoire)

You pick it up.

PAUL (CONT'D)

How are your dish-washing skills,

Gregoire?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in

this hotel, do you understand?

BIK (O.S.)

Cockroaches?

BIK (CONT'D)

Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul?

PAUL

No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.

BIK

That's what I came to talk to you about.

PAUL

Excuse me?

BIK

The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to

say they would be here on the sixth for

the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the

banquet room for that day, a reception to

broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you

organize monitors and check the satellite

dish?

14.

PAUL

Leave it to me.

BIK

Also, could you remember to use the

service entrance at all times?

PAUL

Of course.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The

dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is

near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these

cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out

this murderous infestation...

PAUL

Down, Pealiss.

15.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Good evening, Odette, who is sick this

time?

TATIANA

I asked Odette to take a look at little

Anais. She has a rash.

PAUL

Your brother's here?

TATIANA

Yes, with Fedens and the children.

e wants some advice.

ODETTE

Good to see you, Paul.

ODETTE (CONT'D)

I must go, Paul.

TATIANA

You will not stay for dinner.

ODETTE

No thank you, Tatiana.

PAUL

My best to Jean Baptiste.

PAUL

(a sigh)

Thomas wants advice?

TATIANA

He wants your wisdom.

PAUL

Let's have dinner first.

16.

TATIANA

Of course.

PAUL

Hello, Anais.

CARINE

I am Carine.

PAUL

You are not Anais?

ANAIS

I am Anais.

PAUL

Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a

present for Anais.

ANAIS

It is for me.

PAUL

Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must

find another present.

PAUL

Roger, your turn.

ROGER

For food and clothes, and all that grows,

etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.

17.

PAUL

Thank you, Roger.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Why the hurry, Roger?

ROGER

Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?

PAUL

No, I don't want you going on the street.

OGER

Please, papa, I have a secret path.

PAUL

Who is this Simon?

TATIANA

Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.

PAUL

Homework?

ROGER

It's done.

TATIANA

And he did extra chores.

PAUL

Wash your things, and be back soon.

ROGER

Let's feed it.

18.

ROGER

Let me.

THOMAS

I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant

says we should get out of Rwanda.

FEDENS

Why should we leave? I have a new job,

things have never been better for us.

THOMAS

What good is it if we are murdered in our

bed?

TATIANA

Your assistant, he is Hutu?

THOMAS

Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.

CARINE

He wants your job.

THOMAS

No, he is a friend, but he tells me to

listen to the radio. All day they talk

about the great slaughter.

TATIANA

That station is filth.

19.

PAUL

Today I talked to my friend the American

Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the

United Nations. They are preparing a

banquet for the peace signing. The BBC

are flying in their best reporters. The

world is watching. There will be peace.

Don't listen to this man.

OLDIER'S VOICE (O.S.)

That house.

ROGER

There are soldiers.

PAUL

Where?

ROGER

On the street.

20.

TATIANA

What is it?

TATIANA (CONT'D)

Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want

Victor?

TATIANA (CONT'D)

Do something.

PAUL

What?

TATIANA

Call your friends in the army. Call

someone. Victor is harmless. This is a

mistake.

PAUL

Please, be quiet.

TATIANA

I'm going to talk to them.

PAUL

No.

TATIANA

We must do something.

21.

PAUL

What would you have us do? Argue with

these madmen? We cannot interfere.

PAUL

You better stay the night, it is too

dangerous to be on the streets.

TATIANA

I'll fix a bed.

TATIANA

Why didn't you call your contacts in the

army?

PAUL

I couldn't help.

TATIANA

You could have asked for a favor.

PAUL

No, I could not. What do you know about

favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?

All day long I work to please this

officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To

store up favors so that if there is a

time when my family need help I have

powerful people I can call upon. Now you

would have me waste a precious favor on a

stranger.

TATIANA

Victor was not a stranger, he was our

neighbor.

PAUL

He was not family. Family is all that

matters. Do you think if you or I were

being dragged from here, any one of them

would lift a finger to help us?

22.

TATIANA

They do not have your connections.

PAUL

Connections? I have no connections, only

favors. If I call to help Victor, a

General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is

a fool. He thinks my favors are so

numerous and so insignificant as to waste

them on everybody." Then my hard work is

doubly squandered. I insult the General

and I do not get to use my favor at all.

Please leave these things to my good

judgment.

PAUL

Welcome, gentlemen.

GLORIA

We reserved five rooms not two

GREGOIRE

I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here

in the computer.

23.

JOCK

Paul, how the hell are ya'?

PAUL

I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.

JOCK

They moved you from the Diplomat?

PAUL

Promoted. House Manager.

JOCK

Good for you.

(moves closer)

We're having a little trouble, Paul. We

booked five rooms, but...

PAUL

Let me check.

PAUL

Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading

CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people

instead of BBC Gregoire.

Of course, the BBC, five rooms.

(lies)

They are being prepared as we speak. I

have ordered fresh flowers and

complimentary champagne.

GLORIA

Great, I really need a shower.

PAUL

Just give me a moment to get your keys.

24.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(to Gloria)

Excuse me for one second.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Benedict, you should meet the BBC people.

They could use your expertise.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(whisper)

Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here

any moment. The BBC should talk to him.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of

our best journalists. He covers all the

big stories. I thought you should meet.

GLORIA

Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria

Fleming. BBC.

GREGOIRE

There are no more rooms.

PAUL

Give me the phone.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Madame Denver. I have very good news. I

have a present for you, in return for the

cancellation of your gorilla expedition I

have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu

lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no

extra charge. A luxury coach will leave

in one hour. I'll send maids up to help

you all pack. You're welcome.

25.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him

I need three rooms. And send a team of

maids up to the Americans. I want those

rooms turned around in twenty minutes.

GLORIA

There are rumors, General, that your

army, the Hutu army, consider these peace

accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

(laughs)

Nonsense. At this moment we are making

plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into

our armed forces.

GLORIA

Then the army fully supports the

president as he signs the peace

agreement.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Of course, the president is a clever man,

he knows what he is doing. Thank you for

coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will

see what a beautiful country this is.

26.

PAUL

Forgive the hurry but I do not want you

to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle

steamer across the lake. It is the most

spectacular sight in all Africa.

OB

Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there

was famine in Africa.

PAUL

Exactly, we can't have our guests

starving. What would they think of the

Mille Collines back in the United States?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Keep that cockroach Benedict away from

me.

PAUL

Same as last time.

PAUL (CONT'D)

The fifth room is your broadcast room.

GLORIA

Good. I'd like to book a massage.

PAUL

Of course.

JOCK

Did you bring any of those wee girls who

used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat

with you? You know?

PAUL

I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille

Collines. No working girls here.

JOCK

Can we phone them in, Paul?

27.

PAUL

I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.

Ah, Zozo.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat?

JOCK

Zozo! The very man!

COMMENTATOR

As president Habyarimana signs a peace

accord between the Tutsi rebels and his

Hutu army there remains strong doubts

that the extremist Hutu Power will abide

by the accords. But for now hope has

returned to Rwanda for the first time in

many years.

COLONEL OLIVER

To Peace.

28.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Paul, join us.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Have a drink.

GEORGE

Look at them, they want to see the tribes

dance to their tune. Here is our dance.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Come on, Paul. Show them our dance.

PAUL

Forgive me, George, my step was off.

GEORGE

To our president. May he find peace.

PAUL

Excuse me, gentlemen.

29.

THOMAS

Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.

PAUL

What's wrong?

THOMAS

We are leaving Rwanda, Paul.

PAUL

Go to the terrace, I will join you.

CUT TO

THOMAS

My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we

should get out now, that soon it will be

very bad.

PAUL

Give me this man's name.

THOMAS

His name is Naramaranga, but please,

Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is

a friend, he likes me. He told me there

is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees."

When they hear the signal, the militia

are to go to war.

FEDENS

Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You

are Hutu, you will be safe.

PAUL

Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks

after his family. If there were danger I

would be the first to leave?

30.

FEDENS

What was that?

PAUL

Calm yourself, it is fireworks to

celebrate the peace.

THOMAS

Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you

my car. You will sell it for me and get a

fair price. We will go to Tanzania until

there is real peace.

ZOZO

Excuse me, Paul, you have a call.

PAUL

ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I

know but I want them to calm down.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Already the press are packing their bags.

The BBC man told me there's no story

here. We are boring now. I'll be home

soon.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Let us all go home and sleep.

PAUL

Call when you get home.   And don't worry,

Thomas. Good night.

Pealiss!

TATIANA

Paul!

PAUL

Jean Baptiste!

JEAN BAPTISTE

Our house has been burned.

PAUL

What is going on?

TATIANA

The president has been murdered.

PAUL

Murdered! By whom?

ODETTE

The radio says Tutsi rebels.

PAUL

Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the

president when he agreed to peace?

TATIANA

Where are Thomas and Fedens?

PAUL

I sent them home. Go and call them.

TATIANA

I tried already. The phones do not work.

RADIO ANNOUNCER

Our great president is murdered, by the

Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then

they killed him. We must cleanse this

country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must

clear the brush. Clear the brush of all

cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!

33.

PAUL

Come on, everyone out of this room, find

a seat in the living room.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(in hushed anger)

Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?

TATIANA

They came through the bushes, over the

wall. What could I do?

PAUL

Send them home. We are not the police.

What do we have to protect them?

TATIANA

Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The

militia will not come here, they know you

are a Hutu with influence.

PAUL

They know you are Tutsi!

TATIANA

Please, Paul, 'til first light.

PAUL

Dawn. Then they go.

ODETTE

Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that

Roger has gone.

TATIANA

Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.

34.

DANIELLE

Next door, mama. He was afraid for his

friend Simon. He went to fetch him.

PAUL

Shhhhh.

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT

35.

PAUL

Ssshh!

TATIANA

Roger!

TATIANA (CONT'D)

Oh, my God!

PAUL

Where are you hurt, son?

oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.

ODETTE

Get his clothes off.

PAUL

What happened, son? Where did you get

this blood?

ODETTE

He's not injured.

PAUL

Leave us, give us some space.

36.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(to Tatiana)

The neighbors must go at dawn.

TATIANA

Will you take a little milk?

PAUL

Let him sleep.

OLD GUARD (O.S.)

Mr. Paul.

PAUL

(to Tatiana)

It is time for the neighbors to leave.

JEAN BAPTISTE

It is true.

37.

GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.)

The Hutu president's plane was struck by

a ground-to-air missile as he returned

from signing the peace accord with the

Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors.

The Hutu government has already blamed

the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied

the accusation. Already there are reports

of reprisal killings on the streets.

WOMEN (O.S.)

They are here.

anic in the room now. Paul turns.

PAUL

Shut up!

TATIANA (O.S.)

What is it, Paul.

Who is in charge?

CAPTAIN

Who are you?

PAUL

I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of

General Bizimungu.

CAPTAIN

We are looking for you.

PAUL

What is this about?

CAPTAIN

Let me see your identity card.

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered

our president.

PAUL

Yes, it is a calamity for us all.

CAPTAIN

You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

PAUL

No. I work at the Mille Collines.

39.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I used to work at the Diplomat.

CAPTAIN

Do you know how to open the safe there?

(Paul nods)

Our government needs to use the hotel and

the room keys are in the safe. You must

open it.

PAUL

Of course.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Captain, I must take my family.

It is not safe here.

CAPTAIN

Where is your family?

TATIANA

(interrupts)

This is them.

CAPTAIN

All of them! I cannot take them.

TATIANA

No, no, good Captain, you do not have to.

We have the car and our van.

The safe is in the manager's office.

Please, I don't use guns.

CAPTAIN

There is nothing to it.

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

Shoot them now or you die first.

43.

PAUL

Captain, what could I pay you not to do

this?

CAPTAIN

You want to pay me?

PAUL

Why not? These are not rebels, look at

them. Soon they will be worthless to you.

Why not take some money, for your work?

CAPTAIN

How much?

PAUL

Name a price.

CAPTAIN

Ten thousand francs for each one.

PAUL

I don't have that much.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Wait! Wait!

Nothing.

Get in.

Captain, let these people give you some

money, whatever they have.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Give me everything, everything you have.

There is only enough for one cockroach.

Pick one to take with you.

PAUL

Wait, wait.

Ten.

CAPTAIN

And four children?

PAUL

I'll give you a hundred thousand francs

for all of them.

CAPTAIN

Give me it.

I don't have it here. At the Mille

Collines. I can get it for you.

CAPTAIN

You will run into the hotel and hide

behind the U.N.

PAUL

I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand

francs, enough for a house. I will get

the money, you keep them outside.

I will keep your family outside. Let's

ODETTE

Thank you, thank you, Paul.

BIK

BIK (CONT'D)

While I'm away, you're in charge.

TOURISTS

Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want

to get a flight.

TOURIST

They're in your safety boxes. We need

your requests, thank you.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What happened to all the rooms?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Take this room. Tatiana, bring the

children.

TATIANA

(re: neighbors) What about them?

PAUL

Them. They almost got us all killed. I

have done enough for them! We cannot look

after them anymore.

49.

TATIANA

What are you going to do? You cannot

drive them out onto the road. They can

stay with me.

PAUL

What!

TATIANA

I will not have them on my conscience.

They will stay in my room.

PAUL

Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.

Put these people in them.

ZOZO

Yes, sir.

REFUGEE

Can I help you?

REFUGEE

I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.

I don't know.

Go downstairs, I will help you.

50.

PAUL

What are you doing?

TATIANA

Trying Thomas and Fedens. We've got to

get them here.

PAUL

(re: room) This won't do.

TATIANA

It will do just fine.

PAUL

Any luck?

TATIANA

No answer. Please send someone to get

them, please.

PAUL

I'll try.

MR. GARINDI

Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies

everywhere. I cannot stay here.

PAUL

I need a great favor.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I need you to go to this address and

bring my brother-in-law and his family.

MR. GARINDI

No, no. This is a very dangerous part of

town. I cannot do this.

51.

PAUL

This would be an enormous favor to me. I

am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this

nonsense is over I will be most grateful.

MR. GARINDI

I will see what I can do.

PAUL

Thank you for your patience, ladies and

gentlemen. Now, how can I help you.

CUT TO:

PAUL (CONT'D)

Where are the receptionists? Where's

Gregoire?

ZOZO

He has taken the presidential suite.

PAUL

What!

GREGOIRE

(surprised)

Mr. Manager.

PAUL

Gregoire, what are you doing here?

52.

A WOMAN'S VOICE INSIDE (O.S.)

Who is it?

GREGOIRE

What do you want?

PAUL

Get out of this room and get back to

work.

GREGOIRE

I don't have to listen to you anymore.

PAUL

I am in charge now. Get back to work or

I'll fire you.

GREGOIRE

Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice

a smell of cockroaches? If I were to

leave this room, I'm sure I could find

this smell. I know people who could

cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't

bother you? Why is that? Are used to this

smell? Not me, I need a clean room to

escape it.

COLONEL OLIVER

Paul, you know who this is?

PAUL

Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the

Minister of Finance.

COLONEL OLIVER

Get him a room, but tell no one he is

here.

(to Xavier)

Paul will look after you.

XAVIER

I will need a suite.

53.

PAUL

Of course.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Get the key to suite twelve, take these

people there right away.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What's going on?

VALET

Sir, they have no reservations.

REFUGEE #2

Please, sir, we have nowhere else to go.

They're hunting us.

PAUL

Wait over there.

EFUGEE #3

We need a room.

PAUL

I said everyone go over there.

GLORIA

Do we know who fired the missile that

killed the president?

COLONEL OLIVER

No. But I fear it's intention may have

been to kill the peace accords and spark

a civil war between the Hutu Militia and

the Tutsi rebels.

54.

GLORIA

We've heard reports of reprisal killings.

Will the UN intervene to stop the

bloodshed.?

COLONEL OLIVER

Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers

not peace makers, we can't take an

aggressive role.

GLORIA

If the UN changes your mandate could you

stop the bloodshed?

COLONEL OLIVER

Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm

confident we could impose order.

GLORIA

Have you requested re-enforcements?

COLONEL OLIVER

Yes we have.

GLORIA

What was the response?

COLONEL OLIVER

We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.

COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)

Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the

Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.

PAUL

Yes sir, but these people (points) they

cannot stay here. I've heard you have a

refugee center at the airport Stadium?

COLONEL OLIVER

I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them

Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon

as we can stabilize the situation we'll

take them.

JOCK

For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big

news story out there! We need to get out

and cover it.

55.

GLORIA

We're not going outside the hotel grounds

unless we have an armored car. That's the

ground rules.

JOCK

Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think

you are, Wimbledon?

GLORIA

We cover the story from here until we

can get proper protection.

RADIO ANNOUNCER

'Good Hutus, we must destroy an

infestation of cockroaches at the

technical college.'

PAUL

Turn that off. We have a hotel to run.

PAUL

(to Zozo)

Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.

ZOZO

Sir, no one wants to work. They say the

boss has left.

56.

ABENA PRESIDENT

Can I have your name again?

PAUL (O.S.)

Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The

house manager. I met you on your last

visit.

SABENA PRESIDENT

Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines

is a very important property for Sabena.

Our directors believe we should close

down, shutter the place until this unrest

is over?

PAUL

Sir, that would be very bad for our

reputation. We are an oasis of calm for

all our loyal customers. What would they

think if Sabena deserted them now? (lies)

I assure you the United Nations has

everything under control.

SABENA PRESIDENT

Very well. But if this thing gets worse,

we must close. If there's anything you

need, call anytime.

PAUL

There is one thing I need right away.

57.

PAUL

This is my letter of appointment, signed

by Mr. Godefroid, the president of

Sabena. The Mille Collines is a five star

establishment, we will run it that way.

If you don't want to work for me, then

leave now.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I want the hallways cleaned now, a menu

prepared for the dining room. Where's the

pianist?

PAUL (CONT'D)

I want you on the piano in the Kigali

Room tonight. Back to work.

PAUL

Take these people to the rear car park,

they can't stay here.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Get Odette!

58.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What happened?

BENEDICT

They're killing everyone. The Lady

Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the

gate.

MILITIAMAN #1

We kill UN. We kill you next.

COLONEL OLIVER

Hold the line here. Do not shoot!

59.

PAUL

What's happening?

COLONEL OLIVER

They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians

who I sent to get the lady minister.

PAUL

Where is she?

REPORTERS

Is it true about the Belgian soldiers...

Are all ten dead?

PAUL

Has Roger spoken yet?

TATIANA

No, Odette says he's in shock.

PAUL

How can we help him.

TATIANA

He needs to be in a safe place.

(a beat)

Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?

PAUL

Give him time.

60.

GLORIA

Okay, we're feeding through live now.

GLORIA

Okay London .... and five four three two

one ...That's correct Tom. Today's

gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian

patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force

in a state of disarray. Its commander has

called for re-enforcements. However, the

General Council is deeply divided. The

United States, still smarting from the

UN's disastrous Somalia mission, has

indicated that it will veto any moves to

reinforce. Meanwhile, the slaughter goes

on. Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda.

GLORIA

And, cut ...good, give me a call guys,

let me know you've got it.

JOCK

Perfect timing.

PAUL

This goes out live?

JOCK

Satellite feed.

GLORIA (ON PHONE)

Great. (listens) No kidding,  When will

they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.

61.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

The news room has heard that the French

and the Belgians are putting together an

intervention force.

PAUL

When will they be here?

GLORIA

Very soon.

PAUL

Thank God.

JOCK

Hey Peter, hook me back into the

monitors.

JOCK (CONT'D)

Holy shit! Holy shit.

GLORIA

What is it?

JOCK (CONT'D)

You fucking see that!

GLORIA

(shock)

Oh my God!

62.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

It's Gloria. Listen we've footage,

unbelievable footage! A massacre!

Machetes, murderers, dead bodies. You

have to lead with this. We'll send it

through right now. Wait 'til you see

this.

JOCK

(to Gloria) Here, have a sandwich.

GLORIA

Fuck you.

PAUL

I'm glad you filmed this. Now the West

will have to stop it. Excuse me,

gentlemen.

PAUL

Tatsi, come.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(to the kids) Go back inside.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Did you find the twins?

MR. GARINDI

I made it to the house but it was empty.

It had been robbed.

TATIANA

Oh God.

63.

PAUL

Was there blood?

MR. GARINDI

No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old

woman, waved to me. I went to her house.

She has the little girls. They are safe.

TATIANA

My brother, his wife. Did this woman know

of them? Did they leave the children with

her?

PAUL

This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they

fled or could not make it home. There is

hope.

TATIANA

(to the businessman)

Please go back, bring the children to us.

MR. GARINDI

(frightened)No ma'am, I cannot do that.

The roadblocks are everywhere. They are

looking for children. They shout, "Kill

the babies to clear the infestation."

Leave them be, they are safe. I have to

go now.

PAUL

Thank you for your help.

TATIANA

My sister is dead, Paul. They would not

leave the children.

PAUL

No. They are not dead. Stop this.

64.

FRENCH TOURISTS

Mon Dieu, Merci.

OLIVER

COLONEL OLIVER

You have a battalion, you could stop this

now. The Hutu army is no match for you.

FRENCH COMMANDER

Those are not our orders.

COLONEL OLIVER

You will remember this day for the rest

of your lives.

PAUL

Colonel, what can I get you?

65.

COLONEL OLIVER

Anything. Strong.

PAUL

Canadian Club?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved

us all.

COLONEL OLIVER

(raw cynicism)

Congratulations. You should spit in my

face.

PAUL

Excuse me, Colonel.

COLONEL OLIVER

We think you are dirt, less than dirt,

worthless.

PAUL

I don't understand.

COLONEL OLIVER

Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the

smartest man here. You have them all

eating out of your hand. You'd own this

fucking hotel, except for one thing.

COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)

You're fucking black! You're not even a

nigger, you're African!

(downs his drink)

They're not staying to stop this thing.

They're gonna fly right out of here with

their people.

PAUL

(shocked)

Their people?

COLONEL OLIVER

They're only taking the whites.

66.

PAUL

Children, go into the hallway.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(to the kids) Please, go.

TATIANA

What's wrong?

PAUL

All the whites are leaving.

PAUL (CONT'D)

They are being evacuated.

TATIANA

What about us?

PAUL

We have been abandoned.

TATIANA

The soldiers will stop the killers.

PAUL

Listen to me woman. I said all the whites

are leaving. The French, the Italians,

even the Belgian UN soldiers.

TATIANA

But who is left?

PAUL

I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN

has three hundred soldiers for the whole

country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.

67.

PAUL (CONT'D)

The most the Colonel can spare for the

hotel are four men, and they're not

allowed to shoot.

PAUL (CONT'D)

If anything should happen, if the Militia

arrive, you must take the children and go

to the roof.

TATIANA

What for?

PAUL

Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will

meet you there.

CUT TO:

68.

FRENCH TOURIST

Why should I pay to stay in a, in a

holocaust? Tell me.

PAUL

You are not staying sir, you are leaving.

PAUL in the rain.

cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep.

HOOKER

Please, please, they will put me on the

street. They will chop me.

JOCK

Darlin', believe me, if I could...

JOCK (CONT'D)

Here. Here.

JOCK (CONT'D)

Give her what she wants, room, food,

anything. Charge it all. Don't you put

her out, Paul.

PAUL

I would never do that.

JOCK

I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.

Here take this.

69.

PAUL

This is a Rolex, I can't take it.

JOCK

Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a

fucking aeroplane.

GLORIA

Let's go, Jock.

JOCK

(turns on her)

Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are

we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are

you? Well, are ya'?

GLORIA

You're drunk.

LORIA

(to a French soldier)

What are we waiting for?

FRENCH SOLDIER

We have to evacuate some nuns from a

convent. They are on their way.

70.

ZOZO

What do we do with all these people?

PAUL

Open up the ballroom, we'll put them

there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make

rice and beans - a lot of it.

TATIANA

You could leave, Paul.

71.

PAUL

What are you saying, Tatsi?

TATIANA

Your card says Hutu. Take our children,

go and get the twins, pay money at the

roadblocks. Get them out. Please.

PAUL

Enough of this. We stay together. Let me

rest, I will feel better then.

LIEUTENANT

You are the manager?

PAUL

Yes, sir. What is wrong?

LIEUTENANT

Everyone must leave the hotel now.

PAUL

Why sir?

LIEUTENANT

It's an order. Get everyone out now.

PAUL

I...ah...need some time. Please give us

twenty, thirty minutes. People are

sleeping.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Please, have some cold drinks. I will be

as quick as I can.

72.

LIEUTENANT

We will be outside, ten minutes.

TATIANA

Where's Roger?

PAUL

Come on son, everything is all right.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(on phone)

Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Go to the roof now.

TATIANA

(terrified)

What for Paul.

PAUL

(forceful)

Do as I say. I will be there soon.

PAUL

(to the man with the pistol)

Are you mad? They will gun us all down.

73.

PISTOL MAN

Better to die by the bullet than the

machete.

PAUL

Wait here, please.

PAUL (ON PHONE)

Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do

you know where he is? Please ask him to

call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Who would order such a thing?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Did you find the General?

PRESIDENT

If British Airways abandons the route we

should bid for it.

74.

SECRETARY (ON PHONE)

I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul

in Kigali. He says it's urgent.

PRESIDENT

Paul. Are you alright?

PAUL (O.S.)

We have a big problem. The Hutu army have

come and ordered us all of us out of the

hotel.

RESIDENT

Out? Where are you going?

PAUL

I do not know, sir. I think they will

kill us all.

PRESIDENT

All. What do you mean all?

PAUL

The staff, the guests.

PRESIDENT

The staff and guests! How many?

PAUL

Now we have eight hundred guests and one

hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.

I wish I could have done more, sir.

Please, thank all my friends at Sabena.

You have been good to me and my family.

PRESIDENT

(panicked) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to

put you on hold for one minute, stay on

the phone.

75.

PRESIDENT

Get the prime minister's office. Call

General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell

them this is Belgian property.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Paul, are you there?

PAUL

Yes, thank you Mr. President.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Paul, if you have one call in all the

world to stop this, who would you call?

PAUL

The French. They supply the Rwandan army.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Paul, do everything you can to buy time.

I will call you back.

PAUL

What are you doing?

ZOZO

The lieutenant wants the register.

PAUL

Go and get more beer.

76.

LIEUTENANT

Where's the guest list?

LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)

Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?

PAUL

The guest list. It hasn't been updated

since the murder of the president.

LIEUTENANT

Are you trying to make a fool of me?

There are no Europeans left in that

hotel. Get me the names of all the

cockroaches in there.

PAUL

That will take time.

LIEUTENANT

You don't have time. If I do not have the

names, so that I can pick out the

traitors, then I will kill everyone here

in this car park. Get in there now.

LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)

Hey you, come here.

77.

LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)

Who did you call?

PAUL

Call, sir?

LIEUTENANT

Don't lie to me. What's your name?

PAUL

Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.

LIEUTENANT

I will remember that name. (turns to his

soldiers) Let's go.

ZOZO looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look.

PAUL

They have gone.

ZOZO

Sir. The president of Sabena is on the

phone for you.

PAUL

They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did

you do?

78.

SABENA PRESIDENT

I managed to get the President of France

on the phone.

PAUL (O.S.)

Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.

SABENA PRESIDENT

Paul, I pleaded with the president to go

in and get you all. He told me it will

not happen.

PAUL

Why?

SABENA PRESIDENT

I can give you many political answers

Paul but the truth is that Africa is not

worth a single vote to all of them:

French, British, Americans.

SABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

You have to get out of there, Paul. I

will do whatever I can.

SMASH CUT TO:

PAUL

There will be no rescue, no intervention

force. We can only save ourselves. Call

any foreigner you know, tell them what

will happen to us. Say goodbye but when

you say goodbye, say it as though you're

reaching through and shaking their hand.

Let them know if they let go of that

hand, you will die. (silence) We must

shame them into sending help.

79.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Get on the phones while we still can. At

least we can say they heard our cries.

Zozo come with me.

CUT TO:

PAUL

Send two of the housekeeping carpenters

to the lobby.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Everyone gather together now. Zozo get

them all together.

PAUL (CONT'D)

No one can remain in this lobby any

longer. I have rooms available. Who can

pay? The rental is six hundred francs per

day.

TUTSI WOMAN

I cannot pay?

PAUL

Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will

find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one

will be allowed to stay in the lobby.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Good. I want you to go around and take

all the numbers off the doors.

80.

CARPENTER

What shall we put in their place.

PAUL

Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.

PAUL

Good day. Here is your bill for the last

week. If you cannot pay, or think you

will not be able to pay, go to the

ballroom. Zozo will take care of you.

DISSOLVE TO:

XAVIER

Come in Paul.

PAUL

I'm afraid you will have to move room.

XAVIER

Move? Where to?

PAUL

I'm going to put you on the third floor.

XAVIER

The third floor are low class rooms.

PAUL

Yes they are. However if the army return

they will expect important people such as

yourself to be in these grand rooms.

81.

XAVIER

(to his wife)

Pack the bags, we have to move.

PAUL

Also, this is your bill for the last

week.

FADE TO:

hen Odette on the phone.

ODETTE

Yes, that's right. I helped set up the

treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the

Mille Collines Hotel right now with my

husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you

do not help us we will be murdered.

ZOZO

Sir, General Bizimungu is here.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I am glad you are well.

PAUL

I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

As long as it is scotch.

(drinks)

Your white friends have abandoned you,

Paul.

82.

PAUL

The United Nations are still here.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

(laughs) The United Nations. Madmen are

on the streets, Paul. But I will take

care of you. (chugs his drink) Your

cellar is well-stocked, right?

PAUL

Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I

overheard something that I think you

should know about.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

What did you overhear?

PAUL

A discussion between an American Embassy

official and a UN Colonel.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

What did they say?

PAUL

The American assured the colonel that

they would watch everything.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Watch everything? How? They are gone.

PAUL

Satellites.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Satellites?

PAUL

Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on

your shoulder.

ENERAL BIZIMUNGU

And what will they do with these

satellites?

PAUL

The American said intervention is too

costly, better to get photographic

evidence and snatch up the high command.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

The high command? Our high command?

83.

PAUL

'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes

trial. Lock them all away forever. No

political risk, and big publicity.'

That's what he said. (a beat) I thought

I'd better tell you.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

The Americans! Who are they to put us on

trial. Let us imagine Paul when their

president Kennedy was shot, they said it

was a black man. Then their politicians,

their radio stations gave orders `we must

wipe out these black people before they

wipe out us.' What do you think would

have happened? No different.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

PAUL

Where has all our beer gone?

ZOZO

Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.

PAUL

How much beer?

ZOZO

Many beers.

PAUL

I am worried about thieves and criminals

coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could

arrange for some police to guard us.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

The police are very busy.

84.

PAUL

I understand General, but when I last

talked to the president of Sabena he

promised me that anyone who helped

protect Belgian property would be

rewarded.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

He did.

PAUL

"Well rewarded" Those were his words.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

If I were to spare a few policemen, where

would I station them?

PAUL

The front gate would be best, General.

They could check all guests.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I will see what I can do.

PAUL

I admire you, General. How do you keep

command of your men amidst such madness?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I am strong, Paul, like a lion.

PAUL

I wish I were like you. Look at my staff,

they won't work, they listen to no one.

ENERAL BIZIMUNGU

He is staff?

he General gets up.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)

Get to work, you slug.

85.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)

Make sure, Paul, your guests are

generous.

BENEDICT

Paul, we would like to speak to you in

your office.

PAUL

We, who is we?

BENEDICT

A delegation.

PAUL

Yes.

BANKER

You have no right to charge us rent.

PAUL

Why not?

BANKER

This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison

and you are profiteering from our misery.

ODETTE

That is not true.

TUTSI ACCUSER

Yes it is. He charges for food, for

everything. Where is all this money

going? We hear he has a deal with

Bizimungu.

86.

TUTSI ACCUSER #2

It is said that you work for the murderer

George Rutagunda.

PAUL

I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a

deal with General Bizimungu. He was just

here. I worked out another money making

scheme for him. New arrivals will be

taxed at the gate.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Do you know what my deal is with

Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you

alive. Anyone want to take their money

back?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Here, here take it. And you don't have to

pay your bill. I will move you into the

ballroom or out into the gardens.

PAUL (CONT'D)

And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda.

I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I

will have to visit his warehouse soon

because we are running out of food. Who

wants to come with me?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Anyone who wants to come with me stay

behind. If not, please leave.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(laughs)

You are most certainly not coming with

me. You will get me killed.

JEAN BAPTISTE

You can't go to that place, they know

what you are doing here.

87.

PAUL

George will not hurt me, I am too

profitable to him.

ODETTE

What if he is not there?

PAUL

As soon as the General left he came

running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me,

sir, I have been possessed by a witch.

(Paul's own voice now) A witch you say?

(mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was

in that room. The president's room, why

would I be in the president's room? (own

voice) Indeed, the General asked me the

same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own

voice) Does Gregoire think he is

president now?

TATIANA

(laughing)

Stop, stop, we will waken the children.

PAUL

Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or

fine rare beef.

TATIANA

So where is the lamb?

PAUL

Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.

TATIANA

What's the matter?

88.

PAUL

We're running out of beer and other

supplies.

TATIANA

The foreigners abandon us and you do

inventory. You are so conscientious.

PAUL

I have to go out to get food.

TATIANA

Go out! Where?

PAUL

To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.

TATIANA

No, no.

PAUL

I have to, Tatiana, we are only as

valuable as the service we provide.

TATIANA

You cannot go alone.

PAUL

I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire

with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants

to impress me now.

G           PAUL

regoire it is good to see you back to

work.

GREGOIRE

Please, except my humblest apologies...

PAUL

Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I

must go to visit my good friend George

Rutagunda. You know George?

89.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Fetch the van.

GREGOIRE

(fearful) Where are we going, sir?

PAUL

For supplies, you drive.

GREGOIRE

The fog is too heavy, sir.

PAUL

Just drive, Gregoire.

GREGOIRE

We should go back, sir.

PAUL

Hello?

90.

PAUL

Let's go.

hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress,

MILITIAMAN #1

What do you want?

PAUL

We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.

MILITIAMAN #1

The commander is not here.

PAUL

He will be here.

MILITIAMAN #1

Show me your ID

PAUL

Excuse me.

MILITIAMAN #1

What?

PAUL

Our cards, please.

MILITIAMAN #1

What cards?

PAUL

You have our cards.

91.

MILITIAMAN #1

No. But I make cards. Would you like me

to make you two cards?

PAUL

Paul. My old friend.

GEORGE

Everything is double the price now, you

do understand that?

PAUL

I need rice, beans, beer, and your best

whiskey.    G

EORGE

Beer yes, but no whiskey.

PAUL

You have no whiskey?

GEORGE

No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich

cockroaches at the hotel, they will have

to do without their scotch. Anyway, I

have bled that cow enough Paul.

92.

PAUL

What do you mean George?

GEORGE

Their money is no good to them. Soon all

the Ineysi will be dead.

PAUL

(incredulous) )

You cannot kill them all.

GEORGE

Why not? We are half way there already.

EORGE (CONT'D)

Let me give you a tip my friend, our

generals in the army say 'do not go near

the Mille Collines or they will send the

Belgian soldiers back here'. But the

generals are about to leave, and we will

be in charge. It is time to butcher your

cow for the meat. (a beat)

You can help us Paul. You have some very

important traitors at your hotel. The

politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If

we were to get them, then maybe we could

let one or two cockroaches get away. You

understand, Paul.

PAUL

Let's go.

GEORGE

Take the river road back. It is clear.

PAUL

Are you sure this is the river road?

GREGOIRE

I saw the sign.

93.

PAUL

Stop. You've driven off the road.

You'll put us in the river.

Go back! Go back!

Mr. Manager, sir.

PAUL

That's a big one. (pinches the thorn)

Here we go.

CHILDREN

Good evening, Papa.

PAUL

Roger, you have no greeting for me.

PAUL (CONT'D)

There, do not worry, no tears.

95.

TATIANA

(whispers) Where are we going?

TATIANA

Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the

roof?

PAUL

It's alright. This is the only place I

can find some peace.

TATIANA

(laughs) I hear we must pay for

everything. How much for this?

PAUL

A kiss.

TATIANA

You are a very good man, Paul

Rusesabagina.

he kisses him again.

PAUL

I have a confession. When we met...

TATIANA

In Ruhengeri?

PAUL

Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

TATIANA

Yes.

96.

PAUL

I had you transferred to Kigali.

TATIANA

What?

PAUL

I bribed the Minister of Health to have

you transferred to Kigali.

TATIANA

Why?

PAUL

To be closer. So that I could marry you.

TATIANA

What was the bribe?

(silence)

What am I worth to you?

PAUL

It was substantial.

TATIANA

Tell me what it was.

PAUL

A car.

TATIANA

What sort of car?

PAUL

What does it matter.

TATIANA

I want to know.

PAUL

A Volkswagen.

TATIANA

A Volkswagen!

he slaps him playfully.

TATIANA (CONT'D)

I hope it was a new Volkswagen.

out of here.

98.

TUTSI WOMAN

Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the

airport? We can wait there to obtain

visas.

COLONEL OLIVER

I can't do that. Our camp at the airport

is overwhelmed already. We could not

defend you there. You are better to stay

here and work to get an exit visa.

Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.

PAUL

Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be

on the list.

Oliver shakes his head no.

COLONEL OLIVER

Paul, only those I called can get on the

trucks. I do not want to have to pull

people off, you understand?

TATIANA

I will not leave without the twins.

PAUL

We have to get out of here Tatiana.

TATIANA

Please, please try one more time.

PAUL

I'll try but we have to leave, with or

without them. I want you to promise.

99.

MR. GARINDI

It is dangerous to be here. The radio

says this is a nest of cockroaches.

PAUL

I need one last favor. Go back and get

the twins.

MR. GARINDI

(emphatic) No, it is impossible. That

side of town has been destroyed in the

fighting. The children are dead.

PAUL

How do you know?

MR. GARINDI

Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the

bodies in the street. I have to go.

PAUL

I will give you my house.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's a fine house. Here is a paper.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Madame Kawunda, please.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I need you to witness this signature.

(to the businessman)

Madame Kawunda is the Minister for

Agriculture. She is a very reliable

witness.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Please witness this deed.

PAUL (CONT'D)

There, now go and find them. They have no

papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They

will be alive.

100.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Seven, remember.

DETTE

Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next

list.

TATIANA

Sit with us Zozo.

ZOZO

No ma,am, I am too busy.

PAUL

Zozo you are family, join us.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You are my dearest friends. I promise you

before God that I will not sleep until I

have you out of here. All of you.

JEAN BAPTISTE

It is good that you are going, Paul,

because now we know we have one person

who will save us.

101.

ODETTE

We owe you our lives.

PAUL

You are my family now, Zozo, my brother.

I will get you out of here.

ZOZO

Thank you, sir.

PAUL

Let us remember this night and tell the

world that even in hell there are good

people.

CUT TO:

UN LIEUTENANT

Back. Everyone back. Only those with

letters of acceptance in the lobby.

TATIANA

A little longer, Paul?

PAUL

We wait until 7:00. If he is not here

with the twins he is not coming. We

leave. That was your promise. Go help the

children.

102.

UN LIEUTENANT

Back, please. Stay back.

PAUL

Zozo, tell those people to get back to

the ballroom. They can not be here.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What are we waiting for? Come on.

ZOZO

Sir, the others want to speak to you.

Yes.

Good, sir we have letters, please take

them for us.

Ask them to wait a little longer. For the

twins.

PAUL

Get on the truck, Tatiana.

TATIANA

No.

PAUL

Look, our children are crying, please get

on the truck.

PAUL

I have to stay.

TATIANA

No! Sit down now.

PAUL

I cannot leave these people. I will wait

for the twins.

TATIANA

Let go. Let me off this truck.

TATIANA (CONT'D)

Dear lord, how did they know?

ZOZO

I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?

PAUL

When?

ZOZO

As the trucks go.

106.

TATIANA

What's happening?

PAUL

Please, General, I will give you money,

whiskey.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (O.S.)

You said you had no whiskey.

PAUL

Please, I have money. They're driving

into an ambush, it's on the radio.

What are you doing?

TUTSI WOMAN

GENDARME

here is our beer? You promised us beer.

PAUL

Did you explain to the good General that

I have temporarily run out of stock?

109.

GENDARME

He said to ask Mitterand and the French

to send you more.

PAUL

You will get it in due time. Now, please,

get back to the gate.

PAUL

What is this about no water?

ZOZO

It's true, sir, the water has been turned

off.

PAUL

We can still get CNN here in hell.

ODETTE

The Americans are talking about us.

STATE DEPT. OFFICER

From the reports we have received from

Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide

have been committed.

REPORTER

Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does

it take to declare this a genocide?

STATE DEPT. OFFICER

I, ahh, there is, ahh we have

terminology, that has been.

110.

BRIT REPORTER

You haven't answered the question. How

many acts of genocide before your

government will declare this a genocide?

STATE DEPT. OFFICER

I'm not prepared to, nor am I able.

BENEDICT

I've got it. I have the answer. Watch.

BENEDICT (CONT'D)

We must become mountain gorillas. Then

they can put us on the endangered species

list. Come on, try it. They think we're

halfway there already.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Come here.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Where are my supplies?

PAUL

I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

You have cockroaches dancing on tables

and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did

they drink my whiskey?

PAUL

No. We have no way of finding other stock

but I have money for you from the guests.

111.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Rwandan francs! They are only good now

for wiping your ass. There is nothing

more I can do for you people. No police.

No protection. You're on your own.

UN OBSERVER

The policemen have gone. What happened?

PAUL

I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and

guard us.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Get down there and stop them, please.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Get down and stop them.

112.

UN SOLDIER

You know we cannot shoot.

PAUL

What do you mean you cannot shoot?

UN SOLDIER

We are peacekeepers, it is not in our

mandate to shoot.

PAUL

Then go and pretend you are soldiers.

TATIANA

We are almost out of water.

PAUL

We are almost out of everything.

PAUL (CONT'D)

We had a good life, you and I. I want to

make our peace. To thank God for the time

we had.

PAUL (CONT'D)

We have to have a plan.

TATIANA

What sort of plan?

PAUL

Our children cannot see us die first. If

the Militia comes, you must hurry up to

the roof. I will meet you there.

TATIANA

Please do not talk like this.

PAUL

We have to. If I do not come, you must

take them all by the hands and jump.

113.

PAUL (CONT'D)

The machete is no way to die. Promise me

you will do it.

uddenly, A BANG, from behind them and then above their heads a trail

moke and concrete dust fall around them.

ODETTE

Was anyone hurt?

PAUL

No. It was only a storeroom.

PAUL

They fired a rocket at us.

COLONEL OLIVER

Yes.   Where are the Rwandan police?

PAUL

I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them

away.

COLONEL OLIVER

That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you

this but we've heard rumors the Militia

are getting ready to storm the hotel.

PAUL

Will you protect us.

114.

COLONEL OLIVER

I can't, I don't have the men.

VARIOUS VOICES

We have no one...We will be killed.

COLONEL OLIVER

There's one option.

PAUL

What is it?

COLONEL OLIVER

The rebels have fought their way into the

city. They have many Hutu prisoners.

They're willing to exchange them for you

all.

ODETTE

Will the Hutu army agree?

COLONEL OLIVER

I think so. They are in disarray now. The

rebels are winning, and the Hutu high

command are anxious to get some of their

men back.

TUTSI WOMAN

How would we escape?

COLONEL OLIVER

By convoy.

XAVIER

This time the Militia will kill us.

PAUL

They will surely kill us here. It's over

here. We have to take the chance.

TUTSI WOMAN

No, we'll be chopped on the street.

PAUL

We'll be chopped here.

COLONEL OLIVER

A man came to my headquarters, asked that

I give you this.

115.

COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)

Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two.

I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I

will have to scrounge it.

PAUL

I can't. I have nothing left to bribe

with. Can your men at the gate hold out

for another day?

COLONEL OLIVER

No, Paul, they're afraid. They've

demanded to be moved back to headquarters

now.

PAUL

Give me their uniforms. I will put people

at the gate, in disguise.

COLONEL OLIVER

I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.

One more day.

PAUL

It's from Garandi.

(reads)

I am sorry. There is no hope for the

twins. The old lady's house has been

destroyed.

PAUL

The Diplomat!

TATIANA

What's wrong?

PAUL

I have to go to the Diplomat.

116.

PAUL

General, sir. I am glad to find you. I

have found you some supplies.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)

Whiskey?

PAUL

The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come

and I will get them for you.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)

I'll be over.

PAUL

Bring back your policemen...

PAUL

We must go to the Diplomat.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Get in.

PAUL

Your police are at the gate?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

After the Diplomat!

117.

PAUL

Where are they going?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

They can go where they want. They are in

charge now.

PAUL

What do you mean, General?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

We have decided to move the government to

Gitarama.

PAUL

When?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Today.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Maggots!

LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Do your work.

PAUL

It might be damaged, General.

118.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Here. (offers) To celebrate.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)

You know what the Scottish call it?

PAUL

No.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on

a tour once of the finest single malt

distillery in the world. Have you ever

been to Scotland?

PAUL

No, sir.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I

wonder - will I ever go back? What do you

think?

PAUL

I hope we all get to do many things. Can

we go now?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

(to the soldier) Pack those carefully,

put them in my jeep, and guard them.

PAUL

(looses his cool)

Please, General, call and put your

policemen back at the gate.

119.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I am going to do you a great favor.

(studies glass) I am going to take you

with us to Gitarama.

PAUL

I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

You cannot go back to the hotel. The

crazy men are going there now. Better to

come with me.

PAUL

The Militia are at the hotel?! We must go

back now, General, please, for my family.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

We are better here.

PAUL

(desperate, forceful)

Listen, you need me.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You are a marked man.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

How so.

PAUL

The Americans, and the UN they have you

as a war criminal. You are on a list.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I am on a list! What list?

PAUL

When the Europeans left, their soldiers

gathered lists.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

You lie.

120.

PAUL

If you do not help me, you will stay on

that list.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

I committed no war crimes.

PAUL

Who will tell them? You need me to tell

how you helped the hotel. The others who

have gone, they blame you for all their

misfortune. They say you led the

massacres.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

(nervous now) I led no massacres.

PAUL

You think they will believe you?

ENERAL BIZIMUNGU

You will tell them the truth.

PAUL

(defiant)

I will do nothing unless you help me now.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What are you going to do, shoot me? It

will be a blessing. Go ahead shoot. I

will pay you to shoot my family. You can

do nothing to me!

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

You will tell them I did nothing.

121.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

Get back! (to his soldiers) Get them out

of here.

MILITIAMEN

Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina.

MILITIAMAN #1

Show us the manager. He wears a suit.

PAUL

They have him in the lobby, go quickly.

PAUL

Oh God, please Lord.

122.

GREGOIRE

That's him. That's Rusesabagina!

HUTU SOLDIER

Get out, or I'll shoot you.

PAUL

Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?

PAUL (CONT'D)

(screams in agony)

TATIANA!

123.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's alright, they're gone.

CUT TO:

XAVIER

They should go one truck at a time. When

the first truck gets through to the

airport, then the others will follow.

PAUL

We can't wait. We all go together or not

at all.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It is time to leave. The Mille Collines

is closed.

124.

COLONEL OLIVER

Don't stop. Push through.

COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)

Keep going.

125.

PAUL

It's the rebels.

PAUL (CONT'D)

We've made it!

TATIANA

Have you seen my sister Fedens?

TATIANA

Two little girls, twins, an old woman had

them.

OGER (O.C.)

Mama, mama.

ROGER

Mama, wait.

126.

ROGER

No, mama, look.

TATIANA

Oh, my babies.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Anais, it is so good to see you.

CARINE

I'm Carine!

ANAIS

And I'm Anais!
