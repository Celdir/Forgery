An IRAQI BORDER GUARD, checking passports at a chain-

link, barbed-wire fence, speaks to a WOMAN IN HIJAB who

is turned away from us. The Guard stamps the Woman's

passport.

BORDER GUARD (ARABIC)

You are admitted to the Republic

of Iraq.

He closes the passport and the Woman turns around: it is

SAHAR.

refugees.

Sahar, now one of them, walks into Iraq.
