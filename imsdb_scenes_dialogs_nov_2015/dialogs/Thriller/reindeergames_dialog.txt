"REINDEER GAMES"

Screenplay by

Ehren Kruger

RUDY (V.O.)

I never was much for the holidays.

CUT TO BLACK:

CUT TO:

NICK

What's the first thing, man? What's

the first thing you're gonna do?

RUDY

Haven't thought about it.

NICK

Hell you haven't.

RUDY

Get to thinking about it, it won't

happen.

NICK

We walk outta here, we hit that road,

what's the first thing you're gonna

do.

RUDY

Ain't there yet.

NICK

Three days, man.

RUDY

Not yet.

NICK

Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin,

Christmas on the outs.

RUDY

Hot chocolate.

NICK

What?

RUDY

Get a hot mug of chocolate.

(nods)

First thing I'm gonna do.

NICK

(smiles)

And a slice of pecan pie, right?

RUDY

And some pecan pie.

NICK

She's gonna be out there, man. Right

there. Right there waiting.

RUDY

Yeah.

NICK

Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and

right into her arms.

RUDY

Yeah.

NICK

Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing

her own damn sheets, you read that

part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves

in the whole week, drinking wine,

taking baths, man, see if they got

those room service steaks... anything

I want to do. Remember when she wrote

that? Anything I want...

RUDY

Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

RUDY

All those pictures she's sent...

y'know... you sure they're all of

her, Nick? You hear sometimes they

don't send their real pictures. Could

be her cousin or something.

NICK

Why you gotta say a thing like that.

RUDY

I'm just saying.

NICK

Why you gotta. We were gonna give

you a ride someplace, man. Now I

just don't know.

RUDY

I'm just talking.

NICK

Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

NICK

I'm gonna marry this girl.

NICK (O.S.)

Hey, hey, listen here. "I've made my

list and I've checked it twice, and

as long as you're naughty, it's gonna

be nice. These cold winter weeks

have been killing me, Nick, as I lie

here alone. It's not enough to have

your warmth in my heart anymore; I

need your warmth next to me. Work at

Penney's has been busy because it's

Christmas and that's when we do almost

half of our business for the whole

year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever --

(skipping on)

" -- my manager's still mad at me

for asking for the whole week off,"

whatever, whatever --

(smiles)

Here we go. "And all that gets me

through the day is to close my eyes

and imagine holding you, and kissing

you, and touching you, and tasting

you everywhere because I know at

that moment, I'll feel I've found

the reason for my whole entire life."

RUDY

For twenty-five, she sounds pretty

mature.

NICK

Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you

get matured real quick.

NICK

Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie

Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though.

If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda

never ended up here. And I woulda

never met Ashley.

(studies photo)

That's the world for ya.

RUDY

What if she sees you, man, sees what

you look like... and it's not there.

You just don't do it for her.

NICK

Me and her got a connection.

(hands page to him)

Read this part. Read the part about

stuffing her stocking.

RUDY

She's using a new perfume.

NICK

No, I think that's just oranges. She

writes here she's eating oranges.

RUDY

Oh.

NICK

Shoulda written to that magazine,

Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here,

walk right into a relationship. Not

some one-nighter, man... a

relationship. You? You're gonna walk

outta here with bus fare. Searching

for the drunkest skirt in the room.

RUDY

Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?

NICK

Shoulda written, Rudy...

NICK

Shoulda got yourself a girl.

RUDY

All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw,

and sit down for Christmas dinner.

Watch some ball with my old man,

sleep in my old bed, and have

leftovers for bout six months.

NICK

Thought you hated Sidnaw.

RUDY

Just taste that Christmas turkey.

NICK

Thought you hate your old man.

RUDY

Five years, Nicky. Five years.

(shrugs)

I just want to go home.

NICK

Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be

thinking about you.

RUDY

Shit. Alamo's back.

NICK

Don't look like he missed the

sunlight.

RUDY

Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm

the one ratted on him beating up

Cree. Since I was there, I saw it,

he thinks I got him sent to solitary.

NICK

Aw, Rudy.

RUDY

Count me outta mealtime --

MEAN GUARD

GET BACK IN LINE!

RUDY

I'm not hungry, I'm gonna --

MEAN GUARD

SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET

BACK IN FUCKING LINE!

NICK

What the fuck is this?

UGLY STAFFER

Holiday jello.

NICK

What's this shit in it?

UGLY STAFFER

Swallow and see.

NICK

Just so you know, this man and I are

outta here in two days. So while

we're inhaling London broil and

lobster bisque, you're gonna still

be standing here smelling up the

mystery creamfuck.

(nods)

Who's in prison now?

THE ALAMO

When you don't expect it.

RUDY

It wasn't me, Alamo --

THE ALAMO

That's when.

NICK

Two days.

NICK

So maybe after our week beneath the

sheets, we'll head down to Motor

City for New Year's. She says her

roommate's skipping town for a few

days, have the place to ourselves.

Remember how her brother's a truck

driver down there? I'm thinking he

might be able to help get me some

work.

RUDY

What, working security?

NICK

No, I'm through with that shit.

Ashley's right. Gotta start doing

something I got a stake in. Get a

business going.

RUDY

I don't know, I've seen the business

world.

NICK

Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify

as a small business. Chop shop

consultant; doesn't work on a resume.

NICK

Ashley's talking about maybe we can

start something up together...

NICK

Whatsa matter, Zook?

RUDY

The hell you doing, Zookerman?

NICK

Just a roach, Zook.

RUDY

Good for you. Protein.

ZOOK

Monsters in the gelatin...

NICK

It's a roach, guy --

ZOOK

There are monsters...

(voice rising)

...in the gelatin...

NICK

Oh, man --

ZOOK

THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!

NICK

(shakes his head)

Fuckin, Zookerman --

ZOOK

THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

DISTANT INMATE

Sonofabitch!

ZOOK

THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

GUARDS

SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN!

NICK

Rudy, don't move --

RUDY

Two days, we got two days! Don't do

nothing. Don't touch nothing --

NICK

Don't move, Rudy!

RUDY

Standing right here, man!

NICK

(as a GUARD eyes them)

Ate the jello, jello was fine!

NICK

RUDY, LOOK OUT!

RUDY

NICK!

RUDY

GUARD! GUARD!

NICK

(in shock)

Alamo...

RUDY

GUARD!!!

NICK

Jesus, Rudy --

RUDY

Take it, man! You're all right!

Hold it in! GUARD!

NICK

Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...

RUDY

GUARD!!!

NICK

Ash... Ashley...

RUDY

No, man! No, no, no!

NICK

(choking)

Tell her... I'll be there ...

RUDY

You're GONNA be there! We're getting

outta here! TAKE IT!

NICK

Tell Ashley... I...

RUDY

YOU TELL HER!

NICK

...be with her...

RUDY

NO!!!

NICK

...for Christmas...

RUDY

NICK!!!

GUARDS

GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!

RUDY

NICK!!!

RUDY

The man had two days...

MEAN GUARD

Well. Least he won't be coming back.

MEAN GUARD

You need company tonight, Rudy...

you just give a holler.

NICK (V.O.)

Rudy, man, here we go, here, what

she wrote here: "The car's waiting.

The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.

I've waited for so long. I'm burning

for you, Nick. My whole body. My

whole heart. I'm burning for you..."

RUDY

He was burning for you too...

CUT TO:

EXIT GUARD

Your world and welcome to it,

dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now!

We'll keep the lights on for ya!

RUDY

Don't do it, Rudy...

RUDY

Don't do it ...

RUDY

You Ashley?

RUDY

I'm Nick.

CUT TO:

RUDY

I like your coat.

RUDY

This -- this is just something they

gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing

when we signed up, y'know?

RUDY

How's your coffee?

ASHLEY

Good.

RUDY

Gotta be ten degrees out there.

ASHLEY

Radio said negative five.

RUDY

Negative five?

ASHLEY

Yeah.

RUDY

I don't think it's negative five.

ASHLEY

Radio said.

RUDY

Wind chill. That's probably what

they meant.

RUDY

I was scared. Scared you were gonna

take one look at me and change your

mind. Scared I was walking into

heartache. All those words... you

put a picture in your mind of where

they come from and when you see where

maybe it's not the same as your

picture.

ASHLEY

I figured you walked outta there and

saw me and walked right the other

way --

RUDY

No, no --

ASHLEY

Saw my outfit or something, my coat --

RUDY

No, hey, I like your coat --

ASHLEY

Saw me --

RUDY

Ashley, no. That was me, that's what

I was scared of. I mean, be serious...

I ain't exactly looking like Mr.

Universe here.

ASHLEY

You are to me.

ASHLEY

Thought you wrote you had a mustache.

RUDY

I can get another one going. Y'know,

hey, whatever you want me to --

ASHLEY

No, no, no. Be like you want to be.

RUDY

Do that again.

ASHLEY

What.

RUDY

Smile.

ASHLEY

No --

RUDY

One more. Smile. One more.

ASHLEY

(trying not to)

No, c'mon --

RUDY

I've been dreaming about that smile,

Ashley Mercer. For a long time.

ASHLEY

You're better than the picture in my

mind, Nick...

(softly)

You're real.

SMASH CUT TO:

RUDY

Tell me something. This the first

time you've ever done this?

ASHLEY

Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that

supposed to mean --

RUDY

No, not that, no...

(laughs, kisses her)

I mean this, the whole thing. Start

writing to a guy, guy in the bricks.

Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me

the truth.

ASHLEY

Well. You're not the first guy I

wrote to. But you're the only one I

kept writing to.

RUDY

Yeah. Me too.

(considers)

Why? I mean I know why for me, why I

paid for the ad. But you... why start

writing to some guy -- some con --

you don't even know?

ASHLEY

I told you, Nick. Remember?

RUDY

Tell me again.

ASHLEY

All the guys I've ever been with...

they never want to know me. Who I am

on the inside. They just want to qet

inside. When they do, they think

that means they know who I am. That

I trust them. That they know me.

That there's nothing left to learn.

(beat)

A guy like you, Nick -- six months

before you can even touch my face. I

figure a guy in that kind of bind,

he's gonna hafta work to get to know

me some other way.

RUDY

Had some bad relationships, didn't

you.

ASHLEY

Not bad. Just regular.

(smiles)

You wrote me wonderful things, Nick.

Personal things.

RUDY

Well, wasn't all me, y'know.

ASHLEY

Yes it was all you --

RUDY

Guy I was in with... he helped

sometimes... some of the romantic

stuff, actually... you'd like him --

ASHLEY

I'm talking about the heart, Nick.

I'm not talking about the words.

RUDY

Y'know, some of the heart mighta

been his too...

ASHLEY

Then he shoulda signed his name.

ASHLEY

And he'd be here right now.

RUDY

Where the hell are you going?

ASHLEY

Provisions! We are not leaving that

motel room again till after New

Year's: we need ten days worth of

provisions!

(to cookie matron)

What's good?!

COOKIE MATRON

Oh my, we've got a special on our

chocolate crunchie elves, they're

shaped like little helpers --

ASHLEY

THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in

two goddamn years! Get him two of

everything!

RUDY

Ashley, Jesus --

ASHLEY

Can't survive on our bodies alone,

Nick.

(to cookie matron)

Hurry up!

RUDY

Ash... didn't you write me that you

don't eat chocolate?

ASHLEY

Yeah, well you wrote me you were six-

foot-four, baby.

(teasing smile)

So don't talk to me about little

white lies.

ASHLEY

You need a COAT!

RUDY

Ash, you've gotten me enough --

ASHLEY

No boyfriend of mine is going to

walk around in negative-five degree

wind chill without a goddamn good-

looking coat!

RUDY

Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I

haven't gotten you anything --

ASHLEY

You got out, Nick. You're here.

You're my Christmas.

RUDY

It's two hundred dollars, Ash --

ASHLEY

You forget where I work?

RUDY

(beat)

Beauty and fragrances.

ASHLEY

Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho

ho ho.

RUDY

Just for the holidays, Nick. Then

we'll tell her. We'll let her...

have her holidays...

TEEN CLERK

You can't find... what?

ASHLEY

Toys for adults. Where are your toys

for adults?

TEEN CLERK

Toys for... adults?

ASHLEY

C'mon. How old are you, sixteen?

C'mon.

TEEN CLERK

We sell children's toys --

ASHLEY

(slams money down)

I got fifty dollars to spend in your

store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you

help me or not?

TEEN CLERK

Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in

aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.

ASHLEY

Thank you.

ASHLEY (O.S.)

You know what I was thinking, after

our holiday hideaway? Instead of

going back to Detroit, maybe we could

go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to

that Indian place you worked at.

Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone

gambling in forever!

RUDY

Well, I don't know about that --

ASHLEY

Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good

at. I mean, they'd give us some free

games or something, wouldn't they?

Since you worked there?

RUDY

Security, Ash, I just worked security.

They wouldn't be rolling out the red

carpet --

ASHLEY

And the slots, slots I'm good at

too. Wouldn't that be fun?

RUDY

We'll have more fun in Detroit.

ASHLEY

We could live it up and --

RUDY

Ashley. We're not going anywhere I

used to work.

ASHLEY

I just... I thought you'd have friends

there...

RUDY

Hey. I been in prison for two years,

Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't

want to see me.

ASHLEY

Well, they don't know what the hell

they're missing.

ASHLEY

Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to

disturb us for the rest of the year.

I get back in that room, you better

be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

RUDY

I'll see what I can do.

ASHLEY

No, lover. I'll see what you can do.

RUDY

(sings, sotto)

I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-

pum-pum. No treasures for the king,

pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...

RUDY

...but I got a girl to be with, rum-

pum-pum-pum...

MERLIN (O.S.)

Hi, Nick.

RUDY

What the fuck --

RUDY

HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!

GABRIEL

Welcome home, Nick.

PUG

I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --

RUDY

You... you don't know me --

GABRIEL

Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you

real well.

RUDY

No, you can't --

GABRIEL

The hell I can't.

ASHLEY

Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the

fucking tree!

RUDY

ASHLEY!

ASHLEY

I'm telling you, we got the best one

in the store... I don't know why

people want their houses smelling

like the stupid woods...

RUDY

NO!

ASHLEY

NICK!

GABRIEL

(re: the silver tree)

Hope her taste in men's better than

her taste in Christmas.

GABRIEL

Hey, sis. Happy holidays.

GABRIEL

Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.

GABRIEL

So. This is the guy you been waiting

for. Man of your dreams.

ASHLEY

Gabriel -- !

GABRIEL

(unimpressed)

Must have a way with stationery.

ASHLEY

Gabriel, what are you doing!

ASHLEY

GABRIEL!!!

GABRIEL

You better be here to be good to

her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been

good to you.

ASHLEY

Gabriel, let him go --

GABRIEL

Read a lot about you, Nick.

ASHLEY

What are you doing here?!

GABRIEL

Read you're a man of some knowledge.

ASHLEY

Gabriel!

GABRIEL

A man of some travels.

ASHLEY

GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!

RUDY

I'm... not... Nick...

RUDY

I'm not him. I...

(then to Gabriel)

You want something from Nick, you

got the wrong guy.

ASHLEY

(hurt)

Nick...

GABRIEL

Who are you now.

RUDY

You got the wrong guy! She thinks

I'm Nick, I'm not!

GABRIEL

(to Merlin)

Put him in the truck.

RUDY

I was in the joint with him! I knew

about him and her, okay!? I took his

place!

GABRIEL

You what...

RUDY

I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended

I was him! I knew about her letters!

Jesus Christ, whatever you want from

him -- I'm not Nick!

(to Ashley)

I -- I just wanted to be --

GABRIEL

You're not Nick Mason...

RUDY

I shared his cell!

GABRIEL

But you were saying you were...

RUDY

Yes!

GABRIEL

So you could get with my sister.

RUDY

Yes!

GABRIEL

So you could get down her chimney.

RUDY

Yes!

GABRIEL

And you think telling me that's gonna

help your cause.

GABRIEL

Is this him!?

ASHLEY

(reaches for Rudy)

Don't hurt him...

GABRIEL

Is this the fucker you been writing

all year!?

ASHLEY

(reaches for Rudy)

Please, Gabriel, don't...

GABRIEL

IS THIS NICK MASON!!??

ASHLEY

YES!!!

GABRIEL

Well, he's gonna have to learn to

give you some respect.

MERLIN

Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.

GABRIEL

Take 'em.

MERLIN

How 'bout the tree? You want the

tree?

GABRIEL

Leave the tree.

GABRIEL

I've read your letters, motherfucker.

Don't play no reindeer games with

me.

PASSING DRIVER (OVER CB)

Hey there, Monster! What're you

hauling this far north?

GABRIEL

Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't

hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays.

Gonna have myself a holiday... for a

goddamn change...

ASHLEY (O.S.)

Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you

now. You're okay...

ASHLEY

I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't

hurt you anymore.

RUDY

Your brother...

RUDY

...the truck driver...

ASHLEY

He's not a bad person, Nick... he's

not...

ASHLEY

You're not gonna hurt him anymore!

ASHLEY

Since Janey moved in... Gabriel...

he's come over more and more. To the

apartment. Janey's the divorced one,

'member, with the tit job --

RUDY

What the fuck is going on.

ASHLEY

He read the letters, Nick. Some day

I wasn't there. He went through my

room. He found your letters.

RUDY

What's going ON!!!

ASHLEY

He knows you worked in that casino.

RUDY

You motherfucker.

ASHLEY

Nick, no --

RUDY

You sold him out.

ASHLEY

Nick --

RUDY

When'd you decide to do it, Ash?

After which of his letters, huh?

The fortieth? The fiftieth? The

first?!

ASHLEY

Nick, what are you --

RUDY

I'M NOT NICK!

(raging)

You thought you'd fuck him over?!

Well he's fucked you! I've never

worked at some casino! I can't help

you! Because he's not me!

ASHLEY

Nick, I love you --

RUDY

JESUS CHRIST!

PUG

Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.

RUDY

I'M NOT NICK!

RUDY

Get the hell off of me!

ASHLEY

(hard whisper)

Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

ASHLEY

He'll kill you.

RUDY

You're not hearing me here --

ASHLEY

My brother's killed people, I know

he has. Truckers. If you talk him

into thinking you're not you, you'll

only get yourself dead.

RUDY

He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did

he.

ASHLEY

Nick, please, it's me --

RUDY

You told him about Nick's letters.

ASHLEY

No, Nick, no --

RUDY

You're in on this.

ASHLEY

I love you!

RUDY

Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me.

'Cause you woulda broken his heart.

RUDY

Your pen palls dead, lady.

ASHLEY

If you say that, if you keep saying

that, they will kill you. If they

think you're not you, they will kill

you. Don't you see? I know what you're

doing, but it won't work!

RUDY

Nick died for me....

ASHLEY

I won't let him hurt you! He just

wants what you know!

RUDY

(ruefully)

...maybe I die for Nick...

ASHLEY

Just tell him what you know, Nick!

That's all they want! And we'll get

out of this!

ASHLEY

He found them... I swear, Nick...

(helpless)

...he found them...

GABRIEL

"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have

been dreaming of you constantly, and

knowing you are out there makes these

walls not seem so close or so strong

or so cold..."

(to Merlin/Jumpy)

Women live for this stuff.

(reads on)

Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming

'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on

me here, Nicky... where are we...

oh, right, other side...

(turns paper over)

"Someday I'm gonna take you up by

Lake S. Before I went in, before

goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my

situation, I used to work up at this

casino, working security. Used to

watch for people stealing chips,

counting cards, getting piss-drunk,

that kinda shit. Indian place, they

hired this reject outta Vegas to run

it, got about as much business sense

as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a

fun place to run some numbers and

play."

GABRIEL

You're a good writer, Nick. I give

this writing an A-plus.

RUDY

I never worked at no casino.

ASHLEY

(hopeless)

Nick...

RUDY

That's the guy I was in with, I did

my last ten months with him. He rode

a two-year bit for manslaughter --

split a guy's skull open at a bar

for harassing his girl. That's Nick

Mason. He worked at that casino.

He's the one who wrote her letters.

Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job

was a Quickie Lube, I did five for

lifting cars. I don't know shit about

blackjack, I don't know shit about

Indians. I'm not him.

GABRIEL

Bury this guy.

ASHLEY

Gabriel, you promised!

GABRIEL

I promised that when he helped us,

we'd be gone! When he helped us!

Loverboy don't want to play!

ASHLEY

You promised me!

GABRIEL

And you promised me you'd get your

sweetheart to help!

GABRIEL

He'd rather die than be with you,

he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend

anyway.

(to Merlin/Jumpy)

Bury him all over the place.

ASHLEY

NO!

MERLIN

Beats prison, I guess.

ASHLEY (O.S.)

NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!

JUMPY

The problem with prison... is that

it is founded on the fundamentally

flawed perception of rehabilitation

through punishment. A society can't

hope to create a "changed man" by

surrounding him with the worst in

his fellow man; what it

"rehabilitates" is solely a conviction

that if he can survive the inhumanity

of prison, what then, can he not

withstand? He has seen man's darkest

soul and kept his sight: what is

left for such a man? What faith?

What fear?

JUMPY

Don't get no blood on my boots --

RUDY

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!

RUDY

About the Tomahawk! What the hell do

you want to know!

RUDY

I spend six months writing poetry

and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over.

Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want

me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.

GABRIEL

Everything.

ASHLEY

I love you... Nick, I love you...

GABRIEL

Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.

RUDY

She says a lot of things.

GABRIEL

She's getting you to help us... 'cause

she knows if you don't, you're dead.

You just tell us what we need to

know, you two live happily ever after.

My sister loves you, motherfucker,

and I ain't gonna have you break her

heart.

RUDY

Wish I had a brother like you.

GABRIEL

A girl says she loves you, you say

something.

RUDY

I had better sex in prison.

GABRIEL

Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna

be working together here.

(to his boys)

Get him back in the rig.

PUG (O.S.)

He's not the guy, Monster.

PUG

Whole time you were driving, he was

telling her he's not the guy, he's

not the guy. I know why he'd tell us

he's not the guy. why's he telling

her he's not the guy? What if he's

not the guy?

GABRIEL

The man who wrote those letters loved

Ashley, boys. He lived for her love.

(nods)

Let's see him live for love.

GABRIEL

Where's she work?

RUDY

What?

GABRIEL

(forces gun harder)

Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't

she? Where's she work?

RUDY

J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.

GABRIEL

What's her middle name?

RUDY

(thinking hard)

Samantha.

GABRIEL

What'd they call her in high school?

RUDY

Bam Bam.

GABRIEL

What'd they call her in college?

RUDY

What college.

GABRIEL

Where'd she drop her cherry?

ASHLEY

Gabriel!

RUDY

Canada.

GABRIEL

Be more specific.

RUDY

A station wagon in Canada.

GABRIEL

What's her greatest fear?

RUDY

Her brother.

GABRIEL

Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.

RUDY

No. It's her brother.

GABRIEL

That's love.

GABRIEL

Let's get back on the road. It's

time to start talking, Nick. Time to

start telling tales --

RUDY

Nick don't talk till Nick gets

something.

RUDY

Hot. Chocolate.

MERLIN

You want that for here or to go?

RUDY

I been in Iron Mountain for two years,

truck driver. I do one more crime,

I'm back there for good, so fuck you

and fuck your sister and fuck your

trucker friends. You want to hear

about some goddamn job of mine? I

want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.

RUDY

And some pecan-fucking-pie.

GABRIEL

So when you worked there --

GABRIEL

You knew the place --

RUDY

Hey.

RUDY

Y'know, I could really go for some

onion rings.

ASHLEY

Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's

all you ever said...

GABRIEL

We're talking, aren't we?

GABRIEL

How much money's in that casino?

Day-to-day.

RUDY

I don't know.

GABRIEL

The hell you don't.

RUDY

(sighs, a guess)

Five million?

GABRIEL

You wrote Ash that letter, you told

her that story 'bout working Christmas

Eve, bout how they'd send half the

security guys home, nobody comin, in

that night. And the rest of you got

shit-faced drinking hot buttered

rum. That a true story now?

RUDY

Christmas... Eve...

GABRIEL

You know where the guards are. You

know how to get in and out. You know

where the money is.

(nods)

We're taking down that casino,

convict. You're the guy gonna tell

us how.

RUDY

Hey, it's... been two years --

GABRIEL

We got faith in you, Nick Mason.

(smiles)

You're our inside man.

RUDY

...goddamn it, Rudy... goddamn it...

goddamn girl, goddamn Nick... you're

so smart, so fucking smart...

RUDY

Where's your Christmas dinner now...

JUMPY

I've read where the retail industry

does fifty percent of its business

between December 1st and December

25th. Half the year's business, in

one month's time. It seems to me an

intelligent society would legislate

a second such gift-giving holiday,

create, say, a Christmas Two -- late

May, early June -- to further

stimulate growth and prosperity. For

who would protest such a holiday?

Taking the fifty percent model, a

Christmas Two would grow this

country's annual per capita income

by close to one-third.

GABRIEL

Christmas Two.

GABRIEL

Ever since you started night school,

you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy.

Headaches.

(to Merlin/Pug)

Go see what's taking him.

GABRIEL

Here ya go, convict. We cased the

place in the fall, got the layout

down. What you're gonna do is show

us where each of these doors go,

what the upstairs level looks like,

where they got the alarms, all of

it.

MERLIN

And where they hide the real money.

GABRIEL

And Nick? If you even think about

setting us up, giving us some bad

information? We go down... you go

down...

(lets it settle)

Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards

are there gonna be?

RUDY

Hell. Ten?

GABRIEL

And which of these doors here lead

up to the security level?

MERLIN

Start talking, Nick.

PUG

Start talkin

RUDY

Who the hell made this map.

GABRIEL

What?

RUDY

I said, who the hell made the map?

GABRIEL

I did.

RUDY

This isn't the Tomahawk.

GABRIEL

What the fuck are you talking about.

RUDY

This is the front entrance, right?

You get through the slots, you hit

craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's

here to here -- lined up. What's

this, the cage? Cage is over there,

hard to get to, you got it all mixed

around --

PUG

That's what it looks like!

RUDY

Since when? What the hell is this

room?

MERLIN

Buffet. Whaddya think it is?

RUDY

Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What

the hell kind of map is this?!

GABRIEL

We walked the place for a week.

RUDY

And I worked there. For a year.

PUG

Map is kinda dirty, Monster...

RUDY

They changed the layout.

GABRIEL

What?

RUDY

They changed the layout -- whadda

they call you? Mr. Monster? They

remodeled the place. When I worked

there -- listen to me -- guy that

managed the joint, guy who ran it--

ASHLEY

Jack. Jack Bangs.

RUDY

Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was

always talking bout fixing the place

up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta

gone and done it while I was in the

Mountain.

(pushes map away)

I don't know this map, man. How the

hell am I supposed to tell you what

door goes where?

GABRIEL

They wouldn't have changed the

security setup.

RUDY

When I worked there, this was Bangs,

office. Back here. He kept a little

safe in the... uh, the wall, money

held take for himself, skim from the

Indians. Called it the... uh...

(stumbling)

...the Powwow Safe.

JUMPY

The Powwow Safe?

RUDY

His personal safe, he gave it a name.

Now you're telling me they've taken

his office, put the buffet there?

Then who knows what else they changed.

GABRIEL

So what the hell good are you...

RUDY

You'd have to get me inside.

(carefully)

Get inside, watch where the money's

moving, see where the guards are

going. Then I could work with your

map.

GABRIEL

Wrong, convict. You walk in there,

they recognize you.

PUG

So what?

GABRIEL

They recognize him, they'll remember

him after the job goes down.

RUDY

They won't recognize me.

GABRIEL

Why not.

RUDY

Trust me. They won't recognize me.

GABRIEL

We'll trust you when we're rich. Why

not.

RUDY

'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

RUDY

I give you the wrong information,

you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't

know your damn map. So you can either

find a way to get me in there... or

you can shoot me right now.

GABRIEL

Bring back some memories, Nick?

RUDY

More than you know.

RUDY

What the hell is this? What happened

to working together?

GABRIEL

Rather be back in the Mountain?

RUDY

Might as well be.

GABRIEL

Don't have Weather Channel in the

Mountain, Nick.

GABRIEL

Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you

got singing for your supper to do.

RUDY

Get your own room.

ASHLEY

He said he wanted to talk to you.

When he found the letters... he said

"when your boyfriend gets out, I

wanna talk to him." I thought he

meant back in Detroit. I thought he

meant --

RUDY

But you knew why. Knew why, didn't

ya.

ASHLEY

I thought we'd have a few more days.

RUDY

For what? You to talk me into

"helping"? What, he promise you a

share of the winnings?

ASHLEY

No!

RUDY

Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at

least gotten that --

ASHLEY

Nick! He wants to know how to rob

it, and he'll leave you alone! That's

all he wants!

(breaking down)

I hate him, Nick... you know how...

RUDY

So get him outta your life. Get out

of Michigan. They got perfume counters

in Chicago, don't they?

ASHLEY

Not without you.

RUDY

Since when do some trucker pals start

thinking big, anyway?

ASHLEY

They run routes mostly east, retail

stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows

some guys in New York, Miami, guys

he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides

'em with his regular loads.

RUDY

He working for them on this one?

ASHLEY

No. He wants to be working for himself

someday.

RUDY

And I'm his ticket.

(considers)

What's the last place they took down?

ASHLEY

What?

RUDY

Gabriel and his guys. What's the

last place they robbed?

ASHLEY

I don't think they've ever robbed

anything before. I think they've

just driven guns.

RUDY

They've never done a robbery?

ASHLEY

(shrugs)

They're truck drivers.

RUDY

Then they do need me, don't they.

They really need me...

ASHLEY

We're gonna get out of here, Nick.

We're gonna get out of this...

RUDY

We? What "we"...

RUDY

Get your own room, Ashley.

ASHLEY

Nick...

RUDY

Get your own room.

ASHLEY

If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd

have been gone. You'd have gotten on

that bus and stayed on it. And if

that's selfish, I am. If that's lying,

I'm a liar. But I been dealing with

fucked-up brother and his fucked-up

friends for a long time, and I was

stronger than him then and I'm

stronger than him now. 'Cause he

showed up for money. I showed up for

love.

(hard)

And if you're so ready to make me

your enemy... then what did you show

up for, Nick. What did you really

want... with me...

RUDY

They've never done a robbery...

(nods)

Christmas is looking up.

MERLIN

Having romance problems, Romeo?

RUDY

Not with you.

PUG

Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of

the day you don't smoke?

MERLIN

There anytime you don't got a mouthful

of shit?

PUG

Cancer-sucker.

MERLIN

Acid-chewer.

GABRIEL

Take a look what Pug's bought for

ya.

RUDY

A cowboy. You're going to send me

into an Indian casino disguised as a

cowboy. Have you thought this entirely

through?

GABRIEL

Put it on.

GABRIEL

You're a country-western singer up

from Nashville for the the holidays.

Visiting your Grandma on the lake,

driving into the Tomahawk for some

scotch and slots. You only play the

slots, you got that? Don't want no

dealer friend of yours recognizing

you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

RUDY

What kind of half-ass cowboy plays

the slots?

GABRIEL

You do.

RUDY

At least gimme video poker.

GABRIEL

Shut the fuck up. You play what your

girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in

with you. You talk to her, otherwise

you don't talk to nobody. You walk

the room as many times as you want,

but the second you come out, I want

to know the run of the place.

RUDY

Do I get a country-western name?

GABRIEL

You get recognized, convict, You get

a country-western funeral.

RUDY

Y'know what, guys? I woke up this

morning, I got a really lucky feeling

going on. I mean it, I'm feeling

that good. I wouldn't be surprised

if I walk in there, pull a handle

and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't

even have to --

GABRIEL

Get out.

ASHLEY

Get your goddamn hands off me --

GABRIEL

You got one hour.

RUDY

I'm gonna need some money.

RUDY

Ten dollars? What do I do with ten

dollars?

GABRIEL

Don't tip.

RUDY

Monster. If we're working together

here, we gotta be working together.

I can't walk in there looking like

the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten

bucks to throw down. You don't want

me getting noticed, right? Not getting

noticed costs a guy at least a couple

hundred.

GABRIEL

(threateningly)

Don't. Lose.

RUDY

You ready to gamble, darlin'?

RUDY

(to the boys)

Y'all take care of my guitar.

MERLIN

(grumbles)

Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...

GABRIEL

Get in there and watch 'em. Watch

their every fuckin' move.

JACK BANGS

There's an S-word I'd really like to

throw in the discussion here, guys,

cause it's a big part of what's going

on. Big element, 'kay? S-word. It's

a serious issue, serious factor, so

I'm just gonna get it out there,

throw it an out there, so we can

know it, we can talk about it, we

can get things done...

(big pause)

Snow. Are you with me, guys? Snow.

Big time, fucking, grade-A, God-

quality, S-N-O-W-snow.

JACK BANGS

There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They

don't know it, they don't want it,

they got laws against the stuff.

They got Egypt down there, right,

they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they

got ancient Rome, but where's the

Winter Castle, right? Where's the

Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big

Fucking Igloo?

YOUNG GOVERNOR

We understand you, Mr. Bangs.

JACK BANGS

Capades? They don't do it. Mittens?

Outlawed. Why?

YOUNG GOVERNOR

We're aware of your position.

JACK BANGS

(picks up a chip)

Because down there this is money.

Up here this is heat.

(pleads)

You wanted Vegas quality, I brought

it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I

gave it to you. But guys, please,

guys... I can't get you Vegas

profits... till one of ya does some

spirit dance and does something about

this snow.

OLD GOVERNOR

We understand the Paiutes' casino

saw a net profit of twelve million

dollars last year.

JACK BANGS

The Paiutes, they cook their books.

OLD GOVERNOR

The Waitela reservation made seventeen

million.

JACK BANGS

(sobers)

Seventeen?

OLD GOVERNOR

Perhaps you have researched this,

Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our

side of the lake that much greater

than the snowfall on theirs?

JACK BANGS

I'm bringing in this great showroom

act next week; these three Russian

girls, they look like Meryl Streep,

they can juggle anything.

YOUNG GOVERNOR

Mr. Bangs.

JACK BANGS

Guys. We're doing it right, here.

$5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in

Michigan. Nobody.

YOUNG GOVERNOR

The tribe is concerned that many of

your... new ideas are not resulting

in any new venues.

JACK BANGS

I'm putting liquor in the drinks,

I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I

got the girls showing sixteen-percent

more skin! Show me another buffet's

gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi!

Whaddya want me to do?!

YOUNG GOVERNOR

We want to see our casino making

money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money

for our community.

OLD GOVERNOR

Like the Paiutes and the Waitela.

YOUNG GOVERNOR

We want you doing the job... that we

brought you here to do.

ASHLEY

So does it look a lot different?

RUDY

Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's

the main expansion. Tables've been

moved around; the big man's office,

I dunno, might be upstairs now.

ASHLEY

That guy knows you?

RUDY

Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.

RUDY

You start spending your brother's

money. I'm gonna take a circuit around

the joint, check for any new ins and

outs. I'll snag us some drinks.

ASHLEY

(sotto)

Be careful, Nick...

RUDY

Couple rum and Cokes, please.

INDIAN BARTENDER

You want that rum and Coke or rum

and Pepsi?

JACK BANGS (O.S.)

Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.

JACK BANGS

I can't go back to Vegas, Bear.

They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I

can't go back...

BARTENDER

What does the tribe want?

JACK BANGS

They want gold-paved roads is what

they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin'

Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the

interstate. Nothing I can do about

that, man, I didn't pick the spot

for your reservation.

BARTENDER

Neither did we.

JACK BANGS

Yeah, yeah, whatever.

JACK BANGS

Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run

the place. Nice to have you in the

Tomahawk. Tell me something...

JACK BANGS

...does upstate Michigan need another

roadside casino or does upstate

Michigan need an international gaming

destination?

RUDY

(wants outta here)

Roadside casino?

JACK BANGS

Well, so how'd you hear about this

place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass

mailings? Cable TV?

RUDY

Prison.

JACK BANGS

Prison?!

FAT GUY

I just stopped in to use the can.

JACK BANGS

I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I

can't...

JACK BANGS

Aw fuck.

MERLIN

What the hell was that about --

RUDY

He didn't recognize me. Back off,

willya? He didn't recognize me.

ASHLEY

Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!

RUDY

Heyyyy!

ASHLEY

Nick, what happened --

RUDY

There went my... damn... well, doesn't

seem like security's all that

switched... Ash, shit, this mustache

is starting to fall off. I gotta fix

this thing --

(hands her his glass)

-- drink this for me.

JUMPY

What happened?

ASHLEY

He started losing his hair.

RUDY

Hundred bucks to wear this jacket --

COLLEGE KID

Jesus, man, don't kill me!

RUDY

Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's

giving you a rhinestone jacket and a

hundred bucks.

MERLIN

Thanks, sister. How are ya.

WAITRESS

Fuckin' freezing.

MERLIN

Hell yeah. You work here long?

WAITRESS

Five years. Since it opened.

MERLIN

How long ago was your makeover?

WAITRESS

My what?!

MERLIN

No, the place. The remodeling. moving

everything around.

WAITRESS

The Tomahawk's looked the same since

I started, mister.

(shrugs)

Only the losers change.

RUDY

GO! GO!

GABRIEL

Where the hell's he going?

PUG

Where the hell's your sister?

GABRIEL

Get him!

COLLEGE KID

(scared shitless)

Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it...

JUMPY

Trouble.

RUDY

MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM

RARE??!!

GABRIEL

Where the HELL did he go?

MERLIN

Monster. There never was a structure

change. This place was built the

same from day one.

PUG

That motherfucker --

MERLIN

And Monster... he was talking with

the casino manager. Nick was talking

to him.

GABRIEL

Get. Him. Back.

ASHLEY (O.S.)

Nick! Run! RUN!!!

MERLIN

You keep running, Nick! Keep running

now! Can't keep warm if you don't

keep running! We'll just be right

back here... keeping track of your

trail.

MERLIN (O.S.)

Wherever you run... we'll get there.

Fast as you want... we'll be there.

We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve,

fifteen, twenty-hour days.

MERLIN (O.S.)

We got nothing but time.

ASHLEY

No!!!

ASHLEY

RUN!!!

RUDY

That's for reading her mail.

RUDY

Come on.

RUDY

We get to the bridge, we're all right!

ASHLEY

Nick, the ice is --

RUDY

Get to the bridge!

(waving at traffic)

HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!

GABRIEL

(rubs his jaw)

At the rate you're going, Nick...

I'm gonna have a hard time ever

considering you family.

GABRIEL

How lucky ya feeling now.

CUT TO:

RUDY

I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br-

br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p

(struggling)

...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for

the k-k-k

(waits)

...king.

RUDY

Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.

MERLIN

Game room's closed.

GABRIEL

A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for

effort and an honorary degree. I'm

surprised you never escaped from the

Mountain.

RUDY

(teeth chattering)

...never... tried...

GABRIEL

Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In

the spirit of the season, I'm going

to give you a chance. I understand

you're unhappy. Right outta the

lockup, here against your will, it's

the holidays and there's reruns on

TV.

(beat)

So we're gonna have a contest.

GABRIEL

We're each going to get one of these.

Whichever one of us hits closer to

the bullseye... gets what he wants.

(beat)

You land closer, you get Ashley.

And you guys get to go free. I land

closer... and we start getting your

help.

GABRIEL

May the best sportsman win.

GABRIEL

Damn.

GABRIEL

Got something to say to me, Nick?

RUDY

...ttt..tt... two out of three?

GABRIEL

What'd you tell that casino manager?

RUDY

Nnn... nothing...

GABRIEL

You were talking to him! What'd you

tell him!?

RUDY

Nothing... I promise-nothing...

GABRIEL

MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?

RUDY

NO!

RUDY

He thought I was some gambler... he

didn't know me... he didn't recognize

me!

GABRIEL

I been driving rigs a long time,

Nick. Four, five million miles of

road. Worked for people who wouldn't

keep me on less I was driving fifteen

hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep,

I needed rest, shit, they'll hire

someone else...

GABRIEL

...Dispatcher's screaming for me to

haul ass, he's got a load on the

runback for me. Shipper's making me

wait for the pickup, receiver's

bitching 'bout the count...

GABRIEL

...Got the cops at the bottom of

every mountain, got the DOT at the

top. And every day, every day, I see

all those faces in their little airbag

Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam-

faced kiddies, giving me that look

to go to hell and get off their happy

goddamn highway. Hey. They don't

gotta get two thousand miles by

sundown, or the gang don't eat come

sunrise.

GABRIEL

It's time for me... to be working

for me. I want mine, Nick. And I

need you.

(frightening calm)

Did you tell your manager there's

gonna be a robbery?

RUDY

No, Gabriel... no...

RUDY

...he... he asked me... how I'd heard

about his place... he didn't know it

was me...

RUDY

I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS

ME!

RUDY

Man, Monster... just... just don't

start trying to hit me...

GABRIEL

Nick. I been trying to hit you.

GABRIEL

Maybe that'll help sharpen your

memory.

GABRIEL

Tonight we're gonna take another

look at that map. And this time you're

gonna tell me what I need to know.

ASHLEY

Nick! Jesus, Nick --

MERLIN

Pug.

MERLIN

PUG!

ASHLEY

Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to

you? What'd he do?

RUDY

He had some points to make...

ASHLEY

Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move,

stay right here --

RUDY

(near-delirium)

All I wanted... was to make it home...

for a little of Dad's turkey, and

Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's

acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry

buns...

ASHLEY

We'll get there, baby... we'll get

there...

RUDY

...Haven't had cranberry buns... in

five whole years...

ASHLEY

Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick.

You haven't had cranberry buns in

two years.

ASHLEY

You saved my life.

(beat)

You could have run, but you didn't.

You saved me.

RUDY

You saved me.

ASHLEY

I saved you because I love you, Nick.

(smiles)

Why'd you save me?

RUDY

Guy I was in with... car thief... I

used to read your letters to him. I

know they were private... I know,

but... you spend twenty-four hours a

day with somebody, you gotta talk,

y'know? You gotta share. Or the room

gets even smaller.

(beat)

And sometimes, I'd be reading them,

and he'd close his eyes, get a smile

on his face... and I'd know somewhere

inside he was pretending you were

writing to him -- He'd see your face,

your pictures on the wall...

(beat)

Some nights I think he fell in love

with you, too.

RUDY

You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley.

And with hope, there ain't nothing

you can't survive.

ASHLEY

I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...

RUDY

Don't say my name...

ASHLEY

I love you, Nick...

RUDY

Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

ASHLEY

(a small frown)

I love you...

RUDY

They'll have guns.

ASHLEY

What?

RUDY

You said they've run guns, in their

trucks. So they'll have guns. To do

this robbery. They'll have serious

guns.

ASHLEY

I don't know...

RUDY

We'll need one.

RUDY

I'm going to have to be inside that

casino. When it happens. I'll need

to be part of it. I can't just be

drawing some map.

ASHLEY

Nick, what are you talking about?

RUDY

We need to find a way to make me

part of it.

ASHLEY

Part of... with them?

RUDY

If we're helping them with their

robbery, we're gonna be doing more

than just walking away. Like that's

some Christmas bonus.

RUDY

You want him outta your life? You

want a real New Year to look forward

to?

(bravely)

If we're gonna do this... we're gonna

do it to get it all.

PUG

Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten

packs a day like you. His lungs got

so black they couldn't find 'em with

an x-ray.

MERLIN

That right? Shit. I used to run rigs

for a guy loved your chaw there.

Shit rotted out his tongue, had to

build him one outta silicon so the

poor boy could talk. You ever see a

motherfucker with a silicon fucking

tongue?

PUG

Hell. The guy from Joliet, those

black-ass lungs were the least of

his problems. Got so much smoke in

him his lungs couldn't even hold it.

Got into his system, man. Into his

blood. Coming out his ears, man,

coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking

the row, smoke'd be puffing out his

skin.

MERLIN

This trucker? Met a girl in a bar

one night, she didn't know his

situation. He's drunk, she's drunk,

they get to mackin' hot and heavy

and the woman swallows it. His tongue.

Sucks it right down.

PUG

My guy would walk into a room, set

off the goddamn sprinklers.

MERLIN

His lips went next. You ever see

some silicon-fucking-lips?

MERLIN

(with disgust)

Vegetarians...

GABRIEL

Start singing.

RUDY

I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum-

pum-pum

GABRIEL

Sing it in pictures, Nick.

RUDY

What you gotta worry about first is

the guards. Place doesn't look much

richer than when I worked there, so

let's figure you're gonna have to

deal with ten of 'em. There'll be

two on the floor, walking the room,

that leaves eight up above. Eyes in

the sky. They see something up,

they're the ones who'll hit the silent

alarm and you're fucked.

MERLIN

How do we take them out?

RUDY

You gotta get someone upstairs.

MERLIN

How do we do that?

RUDY

Across from blackjack, there's a

security doorway. Keypad access.

GABRIEL

What's the code?

RUDY

Uh... they change it every month. I

wouldn't know.

(beat)

If there's trouble on the floor,

you'll get security coming through.

what you gotta do, is get inside

that doorway once they do. You gotta

draw 'em out.

PUG

Without having them hit the alarms.

RUDY

I got an idea on that one. Once you're

up there, you gotta hold those guards

down till some backup can get there.

There's a security camera room that

videotapes everything. You've gotta

destroy every last one of those tapes.

MERLIN

What about the money?

RUDY

You lock down security, you move

behind the cage. You hit the Count

Room. There'll be a guy in there but

he's got no guns; room's accessed by

another code. Cashiers'll know it.

They'll have alarms.

JUMPY

What about the Powwow Safe?

RUDY

What?

JUMPY

The Powwow Safe. The secret safe.

You said the manager's got a safe in

his office where he hides skim money.

RUDY

Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs.

Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.

RUDY

So. You're gonna need a man through

here, two men at the cage, one to

cover the count. You're gonna need a

lookout outside, a sweeper through

the back, and a gun guarding the

front.

(beat)

You need six.

GABRIEL

We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

RUDY

You need six.

GABRIEL

NO.

RUDY

You go in with five, you're either

leaving an alarm free or an exit

free. Someone hits an alarm, you're

fucked. Someone gets to a phone,

gets outside, 'cross the street,

whatever, you're fucked. You need

six.

(nods)

Six is me.

GABRIEL

No.

RUDY

You guys get caught, I go away for

good. I got an interest in making

sure you don't. You need a sixth man

covering an exit. What're you gonna

do about it.

ASHLEY

Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.

GABRIEL

I want a map of that security level.

Every room, every guard, every thing.

RUDY

Six men means six guns.

GABRIEL

No way.

RUDY

I'm no threat without a gun.

GABRIEL

No, you're not.

RUDY

There'll be people in that casino.

I can't keep them from leaving if I

don't get a gun. I don't need bullets,

Monster... but I gotta be a threat.

ASHLEY

What's the matter, Gabriel? This is

what you wanted him for, isn't it?

GABRIEL

No gun.

RUDY

Well. What you guys have to plan

out, then... is how you're going to

get to that cage and that security

level before anybody realizes

anything's wrong. Running in with

ski masks and bullets flying ain't

gonna do it.

GABRIEL

That part, Nick... was planned out

the day I read your letters.

RUDY

What. We all gonna dress up like

cowboys?

GABRIEL

Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

GABRIEL

Not on Christmas Eve.

RUDY

You gotta be kidding me.

GABRIEL

'Tis the season, convict.

GABRIEL

Can't be attracting attention, right?

RUDY

What, we walking in there and

delivering toys?

MERLIN

Hell yeah.

ASHLEY

He wants to see your map.

RUDY

I'm almost done.

ASHLEY

He says he wants it now.

RUDY

If he wanted a photographic memory,

he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working

on it here.

ASHLEY

How are we gonna do this, Nick?

RUDY

You're the getaway girl. The money's

gonna get to you eventually. Gonna

be my job to be the guy who walks

outta there with it. But I can't do

that without a gun. Any luck talking

to him?

ASHLEY

Bullets or no bullets, he won't do

it.

RUDY

Is there any way you could get into

his truck?

ASHLEY

No.

RUDY

We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...

RUDY

Here's the Picasso. Is he in his

room?

ASHLEY

They all are. Football's on.

RUDY

(nods, thinks)

Keep 'em there for a little while.

RUDY

We're gonna get you out of Detroit,

Ash. Get you out of beauty and

fragrances.

(smiles, then)

Remember that. After all this is

over, when you know me, when you

really know me... remember it was

me.

RUDY

Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta

be keeping a gun...

ASHLEY

...and he's saying "We're not gonna

help him just to walk away. If we're

gonna help him... we're gonna get it

all...

ASHLEY

...he wants to help now, he wants to

rob it now we could probably stay

right here, he'd go on and rob it by

himself --

GABRIEL

He wants the money.

ASHLEY

No, baby. He wants me.

ASHLEY

He wants... your "sister"...

GABRIEL

...whoever she is.

ASHLEY

Nick Mason's gonna help us more than

we ever dreamed.

GABRIEL

All those letters are about to pay

off, baby... all those letters...

ASHLEY

To all those cons...

GABRIEL

Searching for a money man...

ASHLEY

We musta written what, twenty of

'em? And they were before this guy.

One, two letters apiece, ten to the

racetrack guy in Leavenworth --

GABRIEL

-- till he fucked his parole --

ASHLEY

-- plus the forty to Mason... how

many letters is that?

GABRIEL

That's a book, baby.

(presses closer)

That's a book of love.

GABRIEL

I can't take watching you touch him.

I can't take his hands on you.

ASHLEY

One more day, baby. One more day to

Christmas.

GABRIEL

I've been doing good, though.

ASHLEY

Didn't have to hit me so fucking

hard. Didn't have to throw me outta

the goddamn truck.

GABRIEL

Didn't have to send me down a fucking

mountain.

ASHLEY

What, he should see me help you catch

him?

ASHLEY (O.S.)

He's shown us the setup, he's drawn

us the map, he's helped us do the

plan. He wants a gun, give him a

gun. Take the bullets out, whatever,

but give him the gun. The more

manpower we've got in there, the

better. He won't try and make his

move till the money's in hand.

GABRIEL (O.S.)

He'll be dead when he does.

GABRIEL

Y'know something, baby? If you were

my sister? I'd still want to wake up

Christmas morning with you...

ASHLEY

Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be

the tinsel round your tree...

RUDY

Here's my present to you, truck

drivers --

MERLIN (O.S.)

Where the hell's Gabriel?

JUMPY

With his girlfriend. Making up for

"Nick" time. I'm going down to the

bar, you want something?

MERLIN

Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on

our convict.

RUDY

Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a

bike, it's like riding a bike!

RUDY

How far you gonna get, Rudy...

MERLIN

My room.

RUDY

Hey.

DISSOLVE TO:

ASHLEY

Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My

love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve...

SMILING DESK CLERK

Hello, gentlemen. And how can we

help you on this holiday morning?

GABRIEL

Checking out.

ASHLEY

Gabriel!

GABRIEL

That's for the hundred bucks worth

of pay-per-view.

(then KICKS him)

And that's for the two hundred you

took outta your minibar.

RUDY

(chokes, pained)

You guys were paying for the room, I

just figured --

GABRIEL

(cruel smile)

You wanted a weapon, convict? You

got one.

GABRIEL

Merry Christmas-Eve.

GABRIEL

Commit this thing to memory. Every

guard, every exit... don't tape it

to your fuckin, wrist: remember it.

That's the Gospel right there. The

Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and

John...

ASHLEY

Where should we go, Nick? When we're

gone from here... where should we

go...

PUG (O.S.)

Okay, who had the cheeseburger with

bacon; what about a roast beef, I've

got two roast beefs here --

JUMPY (O.S.)

Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --

MERLIN (O.S.)

I got a bacon too; there another

bacon in there?

PUG (O.S.)

I got a bacon for him and a bacon

for me; there's four cheeseburgers

and two roast beefs --

MERLIN (O.S.)

Somebody better give me something

with some goddamn bacon --

RUDY

This time right now... Dad's stacking

wood out back, getting ready for

tomorrow. Little blaze in the

fireplace. Mom's setting out the

good silver, hanging her cinammon

sticks, up in the doorways. Getting

out her scratchy old records...

singing along...

RUDY

I don't know where you're going.

But I'm going home.

ASHLEY

We go together, Nick. Wherever... we

go together. Remember?

RUDY

Well. I'm going home.

CUT TO:

JACK BANGS

And all through the house... not a

creature was stirring...

(sighs)

Why don't you go ahead and send most

of your guys home, Ed.

SECURITY BOSS

Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.

JACK BANGS

Hell. Nobody even comes here to

cheat...

GABRIEL

Go.

RUDY

Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you

something. You have any problem with

the fact that we're on our way to

take millions of dollars from an

Indian casino?

JUMPY

Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's

gone a long way toward restoring

wealth and pride to communities who've

been economically isolated and

enslaved for centuries. Stronger

infrastructure, better schools, higher

employment... they're all the results

of reservation casino success stories.

Still, many natives believe that

these are temples to a godless

materialism and greed that will only

infect the souls of indigenous peoples

until their love of money has

destroyed the spiritual values their

ancestors died to protect and their

homelands have become no different

from any United States suburb,

satellite city or industrial park.

Destroying the Indian legacy once

and for all and leaving behind a

nation of selfish, angry natives, of

which I, it's true, am one --

RUDY

Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!

RUDY

Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY-

MONEY!

SECURITY BOSS

How you gentlemen doing tonight?

RUDY

We're out of work tonight, that's

how! Christmas Eve! We're out of

work!

JUMPY

(shakes his hand)

Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's

with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas

the season...

RUDY

We're all outta gifts, boys and girls,

but we got charitable donations!

JUMPY

...bunch of us got together for the

union party. Hey, how late are you

open?

SECURITY BOSS

(eyes on the money)

All night and all day.

RUDY

I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress

Civil Defense Fund! Are there any

representatives here present?

WAITRESS

What can I get ya, Santa?

RUDY

Santa drinks American beer.

SECURITY BOSS

(to Jumpy)

What's your game, guys?

JUMPY

Blackjack. Got a buddy from

Woolworth's out parking the sleigh.

SECURITY BOSS

Good luck, gentlemen.

ASHLEY

Three minutes.

RUDY

(to the Old Timer)

That was my card, pop!

My card! You hit for

my card!

OLD TIMER

I... sorry, Mister...

RUDY

That was my king!

OLD TIMER

Well...sorry...

JUMPY

(to the Waitress)

How are you tonight?

WAITRESS

Fuckin' freezing. What can I get ya,

Santa?

JUMPY

WAITRESS

Want that Jack and Coke or Jack and

Pepsi?

JUMPY

GABRIEL

Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart!

JUMPY

Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a

hand here!

RUDY

(re: Old Timer)

Careful. Watch out for this guy.

WAITRESS

What can I get ya, Santa?

GABRIEL

American beer.

RUDY

POP! That was My card!

OLD TIMER

But... I had a five...

RUDY

You're hitting for MY cards!

ASHLEY

Go.

JUMPY

Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get

some quarters, please?

GABRIEL

Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank.

RUDY

That is my card, guy. My card.

DEALER

He hit, mister.

RUDY

He didn't hit.

(to Old Timer)

You didn't hit. You're not hitting.

OLD TIMER

But you don't even know what it is!

VIDEO GUARD

There's two more coming.

JACK BANGS

Hell, there we go. That's the spirit.

SECURITY BOSS

Jack? Is there a union for department

store Santas?

RUDY

Switch seats with me.

OLD TIMER

What? No...

RUDY

You're taking my money. Switch seats

with me. Switch seats with me if

you're not taking my money --

OLD TIMER

I'm ninety-two years old --

RUDY

Then get yourself another table!

You're hitting Santa's cards and

you're taking Santa's money!

OLD TIMER

There is no other table --

RUDY

THEY'LL OPEN ONE!

RUDY

(hard whisper)

Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down!

SECURITY BOSS

Help them down there! HELP them!

GABRIEL

Video room, video room --

GABRIEL

Map said video room --

GABRIEL

Map said goddamn video room!

GABRIEL

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!!

JUMPY

Step BACK from the desks!

MERLIN

DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!

RUDY

(from the floor)

DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

MERLIN

Hold it right there, Nick. Your squirt

gun's all you need.

MERLIN

Cover 'em.

RUDY

Sorry, guys. But what the hell were

you doing here an Christmas Eve

anyway.

JACK BANGS

No... not here... please... mister...

JACK BANGS

Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm

begging. This is not some card club,

'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an

international gaming destination.

We're in guidebooks. You can't do

this... you can't do this to me...

GABRIEL

Show's over.

RUDY

Get down and stay down, and you're

gonna be fine. Just don't do anything.

My friends are disturbed --

PUG

What's the security code to the Count

Room?

CASHIER #1

Security code? What security code?

You just use a key!

PUG

NICK SAID SECURITY CODE!

CASHIER #1

Who's Nick?!

MERLIN

You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS!

FIREMEN

DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS!

ASHLEY

(wild-eyed)

WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!

RUDY

Yeah. That's love.

ASHLEY

MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

MERLIN

You knew there were guns in here!

RUDY

Merlin, I didn't know --

MERLIN

You got Pug killed! You tried to get

ME killed! You just lost your Get-

Outta-Jail-Free --

RUDY

I promise you, I didn't know!

GABRIEL (O.S.)

(over casino speakers)

Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa

Claus... would you please bring our...

mapmaker... to the security level?

JACK BANGS

I can't go back to Vegas... I can't...

go back...

JUMPY (O.S.)

What the hell is with this place?

Thought the video room was back there --

GABRIEL

I told you not to fuck us with that

map, Nick. I told you not to, and

you did. How am I s'posed to keep my

promises now?

(Ashley joins him)

How's she s'posed to keep hers?

GABRIEL

He won't tell us where it is. The

Powwow Safe.

JACK BANGS

I don't know... what you're...

GABRIEL

THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW

SAFE!

JACK BANGS

What... Powwow...

GABRIEL

The Powwow Safe where you steal your

money! Where you cheat your Indians!

JACK BANGS

I don't steal any --

GABRIEL

We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We

KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you

work! Because WE know who's worked

for you!

(smiles)

Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A

security guard named Nick Mason!?

JACK BANGS

Nick... Mason... ?

JACK BANGS

...so where is he?

GABRIEL

(laughs, mocking)

Where is he?! Where is he?!

JACK BANGS

He's not Nick Mason...

JACK BANGS

Nick Mason... worked for me two years

ago. This man...

(a spark of recognition)

...he's some cowboy...

RUDY

Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley.

(shrugs)

Story of your life.

RUDY

I did time with Nick Mason, Monster.

Told you that from the start.

ASHLEY

You... you... YOU --

RUDY

We still gonna spend Christmas

together?

GABRIEL

You are lucky, convict. You're

spending Christmas with the birthday

boy himself --

RUDY

Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

RUDY

I did time with Nick Mason, remember?

I knew he worked here, didn't I!?

Well, some shit he told me!

RUDY

Nick told me his manager kept a safe

in his office, his stealing safe.

His Powwow Safe. I swear, please...

Nick told me.

(looks to Jack Bangs)

Behind the liquor cabinet.

GABRIEL

Open it.

JACK BANGS

I can't go back to Vegas...

GABRIEL

OPEN IT!!!

RUDY

(nods)

Pow. Wow.

JACK BANGS

VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!

JACK BANGS

I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!

I CAN'T! GO BACK!

GABRIEL

GO!!!

MERLIN

Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in

this...

RUDY

Me too.

RUDY

Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

RUDY

I'm sorry.

JACK BANGS

That's why they call it gambling.

ASHLEY

Your turn.

GABRIEL

With the wrong fucking guy! We took

the place down with the wrong fucking

guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is

that Christmas?!

GABRIEL

God bless us every one...

GABRIEL

You almost got away with it, Santa.

Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your

car, got halfway to Canada till you

caught some ice in the road. By the

time you hit bottom down there, whole

car was burning like a comet.  Musta

burned up all that money too.

GABRIEL

Buncha guys in red suits busted in,

they'll say. Started shooting. They

won't be able to remember... if it

was three, or four... or five. Four

dead Santas and some burned-up cash.

Merry Christmas, The End.

RUDY

Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it

hers.

GABRIEL

She told me 'bout the convict

magazines. Had to figure there'd be

some boys in the pen with some useful

knowledge. With nobody to talk to.

Nobody to listen. So we stocked up

on stationery.

GABRIEL

Hard life being a trucker's girl.

RUDY

I saved your life.

ASHLEY

You shouldn't have.

RUDY

He did love you, you know. Nick. He

did love you.

ASHLEY

Who wouldn't.

RUDY

Maybe this is where you wanted him,

Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine,

dead as ice with a burnt-up heart.

Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause

what you did for him was make him

the happiest held ever been. You

showed him hope and taught him mercy.

And he died a peaceful man. You wanted

to destroy some convict... and all

you did was save his soul. Remember

that. Love your money and remember

that.

ASHLEY

Merry Christmas, Rudy.

RUDY

I'm glad it was me.

ASHLEY

Merry Christmas.

GABRIEL

Get in the car.

GABRIEL

Get in the CAR!

RUDY

How'd you know my name...

ASHLEY

What?

RUDY

Rudy. How'd you know my name?

ASHLEY

What are you talking about?

RUDY

You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

ASHLEY

I... you told me your name was Rudy.

You told me a million times, back in

the truck, telling me you weren't

Nick --

RUDY

No --

ASHLEY

You were screaming you weren't Nick!

And we just didn't fucking believe

you!

RUDY

But I never said Rudy.

ASHLEY

You said it a million times!

RUDY

I never told you my name.

GABRIEL

Ash?

RUDY

How'd you know my name was Rudy.

GABRIEL

Ash?

RUDY

How'd you know my name.

ASHLEY

Men.

RUDY

Where is he.

NICK

Merry Christmas, Rudy.

NICK

I missed you, beautiful.

ASHLEY

I missed you too, Nicky baby.

ASHLEY

For your information. I never fuck

the wrong guy.

NICK

Oh, hey. Have you two been properly

introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy

Duncan, I did almost a year with him

in the Mountain. Read him all your

letters, talked about you all the

time, made him feel like he really

knew you.

(turns to Rudy)

My friend... wantcha to meet Millie

Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha?

My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked

at that bar in Motor City, where I

manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't

talk about her much once the Ashley

letters started coming, I guess.

NICK

Millie here used to serve drinks to

these gunrunning truckers, real big

talkers, talking bout a real score

one day. I was in the Mountain, man,

what the hell, why not let her get

friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em

an idea she had, 'bout writing guys

in prison. Getting one who could

show 'em a sure thing.

RUDY

She set them up. All of them.

NICK

Why not have her pretend to find me?

Pretend to write me and reel me in?

Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose

as some sister of his named Ashley?

RUDY

And you set me up.

NICK

Always wanted to rob that casino,

Rudy. Way back when I worked there.

What better way than to get some

guys to rob it for me.

NICK

Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the

shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does

he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty

to put out the story I was dead.

Once the wound healed up...

(notes cash-sacks)

Got out of the Mountain this morning.

And tonight I'm a rich man.

RUDY

How'd you know I'd do it.

NICK

Do what?

RUDY

Walk outta there and tell her I was

you.

NICK

Because every time I read her letters,

Rudy... you listened.

(to Ashley)

Keep your gun on him.

NICK

Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk,

Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll

say. So we gotta have five Santas

not walk out. Gotta have five...

(working)

This'll burn right away... in the

fire...

NICK

Hell, you never needed to convince

Ashley you were me. Just the dumb

fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked

enough about the Tomahawk in the pen

for you to get by --

RUDY

Talked about the old man's weapons

stash, probably forgot I'd remember

NICK

Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if

you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd

start convincing 'em soon enough.

NICK

They had the weapons and the

willpower. We just gave them their

inside man.

RUDY

You gave them me.

NICK

I gave them me.

(shrugs, smiles)

Said some nice things about me, Rudy.

I appreciate it. But don't worry. I

do love her. And she loves me. You

had that right all along.

NICK

Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!

NICK

Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time

with you!

RUDY

LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A

BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!

RUDY

RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND

THE WHEEL!

ASHLEY

NOOOOOOO!!!

RUDY

RULE TWO!

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

NICK

...Rudy... help me... Rudy...

NICK (O.S.)

...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

Rudy...? Rudy?

FATHER

Son? Is... is that you...?

THE END
