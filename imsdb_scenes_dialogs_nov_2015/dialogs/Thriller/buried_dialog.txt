Thanks for calling the Conroy's.

We're not home right now. Please

Thanks.

PAUL

Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I

need you to contact the National

Tell them we were attacked in the

Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.

PAUL (CONT'D)

They have to find me. Please help

me, baby. Please help them find me.

LINDA

Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a

message. Thanks and have a great

day.

PAUL

Linda, it's Paul. I need you to

call me right away. This is an

absolute emergency. Call the

number that comes up on your phone.

Call me at that number. If I don't

answer, call the Pentagon or the

F.B.I. I don't know what the hell

is going on, but I'm buried in a

box...

PAUL (CONT'D)

...I can't breathe in here. Make

sure you call me right away.

Please, baby, please call me.

10.

411 OPERATOR

What city and state, please?

PAUL

Um...I don't know. The F.B.I.,

wherever they are.

411 OPERATOR

Do you have a specific city you'd

like to be connected to, sir?

PAUL

I don't care, any city. Just

connect me to the F.B.I.

411 OPERATOR

Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices

listed in Boston, New York,

Philadelphia, New Haven, Los

Angeles, Chicago, Denver --

PAUL

Anywhere! Any city, just connect

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Chicago field office. Special

Agent Harris.

PAUL

Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Yes it is, sir.

PAUL

I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried

in the desert somewhere. I need

you to help me --

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down. When

were you in Iraq?

PAUL

Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck

driver for CRT. I've been here for

nine months.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

May I have your name please, sir?

PAUL

Paul Conroy.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

(saying it as he writes it

DOWN)

Paul Conroy.

(back on the phone)

Okay, Paul, explain to me what's

going on.

12.

PAUL

Alright. Me and a convoy of other

drivers were delivering kitchen

parts to a community center. As we

got closer, a bunch of kids started

throwing rocks at our trucks. Then

an IED went off up ahead and blew

up one of the other trucks. These

guys came out from behind the

houses with guns and started

shooting everybody right there on

the street.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Were you shot at?

PAUL

I don't know!

(after a breath, calmer)

I don't know. I was way in the

back of the convoy. I must have got

hit in the head with one of the

rocks and got knocked out. That's

the last thing I remember. But now

I just woke up, and I was tied up

and buried in a coffin.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Who put you there?

PAUL

I guess whoever ambushed us.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

A bunch of kids?

PAUL

No, you're not listening. The kids

threw the rocks at us, but then

some Iraqi guys -- maybe

insurgents, I don't fucking know --

popped out of nowhere and started

shooting at us.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

I thought you said they didn't

shoot at you.

13.

PAUL

They didn't, I don't know! But

they shot them!

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Sir, you're going to have to stop

shouting if --

PAUL

I'm shouting because you're not

listening! I need you to help me!

Please!!

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Hmmm...

PAUL

Can you trace my call? GPS or

something?

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Why is it that they didn't shoot

you?

PAUL

I have no idea. They didn't,

that's all I know.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

What's your social security number,

Paul?

PAUL

Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the

middle of the fucking desert! Who

cares what my social security

number is?! I'm an American

citizen. Just send someone to find

me!

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Do you know where you're

...lo...if...dy..

PAUL

Hello? What? I can't hear you.

SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS

Bet...un...near...

14.

PAUL

Hello?! Hello?!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Shit!!

CRT OPERATOR

Thank you for calling Crestin,

Roland and Thomas. How may I

direct your call?

PAUL

Somebody, I need to talk to someone

right away. It's an emergency.

CRT OPERATOR

Who is this, please?

PAUL

Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you

guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My

convoy was attacked.

CRT OPERATOR

Sir, if this is a crisis situation

you need to contact the Safety

Number your were provided.

15.

PAUL

I know, I know, but I don't have

it. They took it.

CRT OPERATOR

Who took it, sir?

PAUL

The Iraqis, I think. I don't

remember, I blacked out.

CRT OPERATOR

I'm going to put you through to

Alan Davenport.

PAUL

Davenport? Who's that?

CRT OPERATOR

Director of Personnel. Please

hold.

PAUL

Personnel? No, I need to talk --

CRT SPOKESMAN

At CRT, we work with our clients to

provide effective and sustainable

solutions to the challenges they

face in our fast-growing, global

economy. As the premiere...

ALAN DAVENPORT

You've reached Alan Davenport,

personnel director at Crestin,

Roland and Thomas. Please leave

your name and number at the tone

and I will return your call as soon

as possible.

16.

PAUL

This is Paul Conroy, I'm from

Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver

for CRT, and my convoy was

ambushed...by insurgents or

terrorists. I don't know. I don't

know who it was. I'm stuck in the

ground, buried in a coffin and I

need help. Please send help. I'm

begging you. I think I'm in

Baqubah in the Diyala Provence.

Please send help right away. I

can't breathe in here. I

can't...please. I'm begging you.

I don't know who else to call.

I...

PAUL (CONT'D)

(EXASPERATED)

...fuck.

17.

PAUL

Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?

Hello?

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hello? Who are you? Please, you

have to help me.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Who is this? Hello?

JABIR

Breathe no breathe, American? Ah?

Breathe no breathe?

PAUL

What? I don't know what you're

saying. Who is this?

JABIR

American can breathe no breathe?

PAUL

No, I can't breathe. Please get me

out of here.

JABIR

Get out?

PAUL

Yes, please get me out. Help me.

JABIR

Soldier.

18.

PAUL

No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a

truck driver. That's it. I'm not

a soldier. I'm a contractor.

JABIR

Contractor?

PAUL

Yes, that's right. A contractor.

Not a soldier.

JABIR

Blackwater.

PAUL

No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a

security contractor. Truck driver,

I'm a truck driver. That's all.

JABIR

You are American.

PAUL

Yes.

JABIR

Then you are soldier.

PAUL

No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed.

But, you still shot at us.

JABIR

In head and in throat, so you tell

no more lies.

PAUL

I'm not lying! We were all

drivers.

JABIR

Drive what?

PAUL

Trucks. The big trucks you see

driving around with the supplies?

That's us. That's me. We're not

soldiers.

19.

JABIR

Five million money.

PAUL

What?

JABIR

Five million money tonight by nine

PM or you stay. Buried like dog.

PAUL

Five million dollars? From who?

JABIR

Your family.

PAUL

My family doesn't have five million

dollars. If they did, I wouldn't

be here.

JABIR

From Embassy.

PAUL

I don't know, yes, the Embassy will

pay you. If you let me go, they'll

pay you the money.

JABIR

(after a long beat)

Nine PM, five million money.

FADE TO:

PAUL

(TO HIMSELF)

Come on, what's her number?

MALE 411 OPERATOR

What city and listing, please?

PAUL

Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking

for Donna Mitchell.

21.

MALE 411 OPERATOR

I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.

One on Federal Road and one on

Ardmore Avenue.

PAUL

Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah.

Shit, I don't know. Just give me

that one.

MALE 411 OPERATOR

Ardmore Avenue?

PAUL

Yes, Ardmore Avenue.

MALE 411 OPERATOR

Please hold for your number.

AUTOMATED MESSAGE

The number you requested, 269-948-

PAUL

Come on! Where the hell is

everyone?

DONNA

Hello?

PAUL

Donna, it's Paul.

DONNA

Hey, how's it going?

22.

PAUL

Where's Linda? She's not answering

her phone. I need to talk to her,

I've been taken hostage by...

DONNA

(OVERLAPPING)

Fooled you. I'm not really home.

But if you leave a message, I'll

get back to you as soon as I get

in. Bye-bye.

PAUL

Donna, I need to talk to Linda.

It's an absolute emergency. Have

her call me. Use star sixty-nine

and find out the number I'm calling

from and have her call me...

DONNA

Paul?

PAUL

Donna.

DONNA

What do you want?

PAUL

I need to talk to Linda. Where is

she?

DONNA

I don't know. I haven't talked to

her all day. Call her cell phone.

PAUL

Are you near a computer or

something?

DONNA

Uh...yeah. Why?

PAUL

Turn it on.

23.

DONNA

It is on.

PAUL

Look up the number for the State

Department for me.

DONNA

I was just heading out to the

supermarket. I really don't have

TIME --

PAUL

Donna, please, please, please --

just get me the number.

DONNA

Is everything alright?

PAUL

No! Everything is not alright!

So, please, just look up the

number.

DONNA

Don't fucking yell at me, Paul.

PAUL

I'm not yelling!

DONNA

Yes you are. Just like you did

last year at the cookout. I'm not

going to tolerate --

PAUL

(EXPLODING)

Just get me the fucking number!!

Get me the number, get me the

number!!

24.

DONNA

What?

PAUL

Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled.

But, I'm only going to ask you once

more to get me this number. If you

don't get me this number, I'm going

to die.

DONNA

What?

PAUL

I don't have time to explain.

Please...the number.

DONNA

(BEAT)

Hold on.

DONNA (CONT'D)

Okay...State Department. It's 202-

134-4750.

PAUL

202-134-4750?

DONNA

Yeah.

25.

DONNA

What the hell's going --

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

United States Department of State.

PAUL

I'm an American citizen, working in

Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I

need to speak to someone right

away.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

Where are you calling from, sir?

PAUL

From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for

CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

We were attacked and now I'm being

held for ransom.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

Are the kidnappers with you?

PAUL

No. I'm buried somewhere.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

You're buried?

PAUL

Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box.

It's an old coffin, I think.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

Did you try contacting the military

out there?

PAUL

I don't have the number.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

What number?

PAUL

I was given a number to call, a

safety number. But the people took

it.

26.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

The people holding you hostage?

PAUL

Yes.

STATE DEPARTMENT REP

(DISCONCERTED)

I don't know...hold on. Let me

connect you...hold on.

PAUL

No. Wait...

REBECCA

Rebecca Browning.

PAUL

Hello?

REBECCA

Yes, hello. I was just informed of

your situation.

PAUL

Yeah, my situation. I'm running

out of time and you people keep

putting me on hold. What the hell

is wrong with you?

REBECCA

I'm sorry.

PAUL

Don't be sorry. Just help me.

REBECCA

I just have a few questions for

you, Mister Conroy.

PAUL

You've got to be kidding me.

REBECCA

It's important that I get this

information. It will make a rescue

ATTEMPT --

27.

PAUL

Wait, wait, wait...how did you know

my name?

REBECCA

I'm sorry?

PAUL

I never gave you my name. I don't

think I gave it to the other guy,

either.

PAUL (CONT'D)

What the hell is going on right

now?

REBECCA

(after a beat)

We received a call from a

representative at CRT. You left

him a message?

PAUL

Yeah...?

REBECCA

He contacted us right away.

PAUL

Well, since you know what the hell

is going on, what have you done to

get me out of here?

REBECCA

There's little we can do from

Washington.

PAUL

So, that's it? I'm just supposed

to rot in here because there's

little you can do?

REBECCA

No.

PAUL

Then what?

REBECCA

I need to know where you were when

your convoy was ambushed.

28.

PAUL

In the Diyala Provence. In

Baqubah.

REBECCA

Okay. And has contact been made

with the kidnappers?

PAUL

Yes. The guy told me that he wants

five million dollars by nine

o'clock tonight.

REBECCA

Or else...?

PAUL

Or else he'll bring me to Sea

World. What do you think, lady?

REBECCA

We'll do everything we can.

PAUL

So you'll pay them?

REBECCA

(BEAT)

No. That we can't do.

PAUL

Wait...what?

REBECCA

It's the policy of the United

States government to not negotiate

with terrorists.

PAUL

To hell with that! It's easy for

you to worry about policy, you're

sitting in an air conditioned

office somewhere, probably

finishing up your sandwich from

lunch. You're not the one stuck in

a coffin, buried in the God damn

desert!

REBECCA

I understand your frustration --

29.

PAUL

Frustration? Lady, I'm going to

fucking die in here. Understand

that!

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hello?

REBECCA

I'm here.

PAUL

Well, then say something. Tell me

how you're going to get me out of

here.

REBECCA

What's the number on the phone

you're calling from?

PAUL

I don't know. Did it come up on

your end?

REBECCA

No. It's listed as unavailable.

Do this -- take down this number.

PAUL

Go ahead.

REBECCA

410-195-5453.

PAUL

Who's that?

REBECCA

Dan Brenner. He's the commander of

the Hostage Working Group over in

Iraq.

30.

PAUL

Hostage Working Group?

REBECCA

We formed it in 2004 to deal with

situations such as yours.

PAUL

Situations. I love how you keep

calling it that.

REBECCA

Did you write down the number?

PAUL

Yeah.

REBECCA

Good. Hold on, I'll connect you

with him now. He should be

expecting you.

PAUL

What about the news? I'm going to

call them.

REBECCA

No. Do not, I repeat, do not

contact the news.

PAUL

Why?

REBECCA

It will only complicate things

further and threaten your chances

of rescue.

PAUL

That's bullshit. You're just

covering your ass.

REBECCA

No, I'm covering yours. Everyone

who needs to know about this does.

31.

PAUL

You don't go looking for something

if you don't know it's missing.

REBECCA

That's why you need to contact Dan

Brenner right away.

PAUL

Fine.

REBECCA

I'm transferring you now.

DAN

Brenner.

PAUL

Dan Brenner?

DAN

Is this Paul Conroy?

PAUL

(EXCITED)

Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul.

DAN

Paul, I was informed of what's

going on. I want you to know that

we're already working on trying to

get you out of there.

32.

PAUL

Oh, thank you, God.

DAN

I was told that we have until 9pm.

Is that right?

PAUL

That's what he said.

DAN

Alright. That doesn't give us a

whole lot of time. And just so I

have this right, the kidnappers

buried you in the ground?

PAUL

Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.

DAN

Okay. My guess is that since

you're able to get a cell signal,

you're no more than a few feet

underground.

PAUL

I don't know. Maybe.

DAN

What about battery life? How much

does the phone have left?

PAUL

Less than half.

DAN

Okay. You have to conserve that

battery. Our best bet of finding

you is by tracking your cell

signal. Is the ringer set on a

sound or vibrate?

PAUL

Vibrate.

DAN

Press and hold down the asterisk

key to change it to a ring tone.

It will use less power.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I didn't know it was going to be

like this over here.

DAN

I don't think any of us did.

PAUL

It's him. He's calling.

DAN

The kidnapper?

PAUL

Yeah. What do I do?

DAN

You know his number?

PAUL

Yeah.

DAN

Give it to me.

PAUL

What about the call?

DAN

Give me the number first.

PAUL

He's going to hang up.

DAN

Take the call.

PAUL

BUT --

DAN

Take the call. Now.

35.

PAUL

Hello.

JABIR

Two hour, six minute.

PAUL

You have to give me more time.

JABIR

You talk to embassy? They give

money?

PAUL

Yes. No. I talked to...someone.

Government. They said that they

won't pay the money.

JABIR

No pay?

PAUL

No. They said that they don't

negotiate with terrorists.

JABIR

Terrorists? I am terrorist?

PAUL

Yes. You are terrorist, you son of

a bitch.

JABIR

You are terrified, so I am

terrorist?

PAUL

What did I ever do to you?

JABIR

Ever do?

PAUL

Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,

to make money. That's it.

JABIR

I have job until you come. Now, my

family have nothing.

36.

PAUL

That's not my fault!

JABIR

Nine, one, one was not my fault,

but still you are here! Saddam was

not my fault, but still you are

here!

PAUL

I told you, I'm only here to work.

To help rebuild.

JABIR

Rebuild what you destroyed.

PAUL

Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just

a guy. I'm just a truck driver.

Okay? I'm nobody that makes

decisions about anything. I just

want to go home.

JABIR

You make video, ransom video.

PAUL

Yes. Please. Get me out of here

and I'll make the video.

JABIR

No. You make video now.

PAUL

What...? How?

JABIR

You use video on phone.

37.

JABIR (CONT'D)

Near foot. You read note near foot

in box.

PAUL

Where? I don't see --

JABIR

Near foot. Read note inside box.

PAUL

The video...if I make it, will you

let me go?

JABIR

Only if we get money.

PAUL

Nobody's going to pay five million

dollars for me.

JABIR

We take less. One million money.

PAUL

If they pay it, will you let me go?

JABIR

(after a beat)

One million money.

38.

SHANE

Thanks for calling the Conroy's.

We're not home right now. Please

leave a message at the beep.

Thanks.

39.

PAUL

Shit.

DAN

Paul?

PAUL

Here's his number...

DAN

Hold on. Alright, go ahead.

PAUL

It's 07902-24-921.

DAN

This is huge. Unless they're using

a cloned line, we should be able to

find where this is coming from in

minutes.

PAUL

What about me? Can you track my

cell signal?

DAN

We're having a lot of trouble with

yours. Seems to be an EDS line,

probably through one of the

Egyptian carriers.

PAUL

What does that mean?

DAN

That...it's not going to be easy.

PAUL

He wants me to make a ransom video.

40.

DAN

No. Hold off for as long as you

can.

PAUL

If it's going to get me out of

here, I'm making it.

DAN

The last thing we want is for this

to end up all over Al Jazeera.

PAUL

We?

DAN

This can't turn into an

international incident.

PAUL

That's all you people care about!

But what about me? Don't you care

about me?

DAN

We do. That's why we're --

PAUL

No you don't! You people don't

care about any of us. I've had

eight friends killed out here, six

of them today. We don't have any

guns, any armor. Nothing.

DAN

You're not soldiers.

PAUL

Tell that to the people who put me

in this box! Tell that to the

people who shot my friends!

DAN

We're doing the best we can.

PAUL

No, you're not. All you people

understand are your secret plans

and your back room politics.

(MORE)

41.

PAUL (CONT'D)

If I were some diplomat or

something, maybe even a hostage

working group leader -- or whatever

your fancy title is, I'd be out of

here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm

not, so I'm just supposed to keep

my mouth shut and die.

DAN

I need you to stay focused, Paul.

PAUL

Fuck you.

DAN

Paul, listen to me: finding you is

our primary concern. Bottom line.

And we're searching just as hard as

we would be for a four-star

general, so don't literally waste

your breath suggesting otherwise.

PAUL

Who are they? The people who put

me here?

DAN

They're just that -- people. No

different from you and me.

PAUL

I'm no terrorist.

DAN

Neither are they.

PAUL

How do you know that?

DAN

If you were homeless,

starving...actually, I take that

back. If your family was homeless

and starving, what would you do for

them?

PAUL

I wouldn't kill someone.

42.

DAN

How can you be sure?

PAUL

(GETTING FRUSTRATED)

What difference does it make?

DAN

They're criminals, desperate ones

at that. They don't care about

anything other than getting the

money.

PAUL

So pay them, then.

DAN

Trust me, if it was an option, I

would do that in a heartbeat.

PAUL

How many others have there been?

DAN

Since I got here? Hundreds.

Journalists, contractors,

soldiers...hundreds have been

taken. It's one of the only

functioning businesses out here.

PAUL

How many have you rescued?

PAUL (CONT'D)

How many?

DAN

(BEAT)

Not many.

PAUL

Tell me their names.

DAN

Who?

PAUL

Any of them. Make me know they

really do matter to you.

DAN

Mark White.

43.

PAUL

Who was Mark White?

DAN

A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty-

six years old. Med student. Came

over here to help out local

doctors.

PAUL

What happened to him?

DAN

Insurgents grabbed him.

PAUL

When?

DAN

About three weeks ago.

PAUL

You remember his name.

DAN

I remember all their names.

PAUL

(afraid to ask)

Did he...? Is he...?

DAN

Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive.

PAUL

Where is he?

DAN

Home. Probably happy to be back at

school.

PAUL

I want to get out of here.

44.

DAN

We found him; we'll find you, too.

PAUL

How?

DAN

We already have a solid lead on the

number you gave us.

PAUL

You do?

DAN

A unit's on it's way over there

now.

PAUL

That's...that's good.

DAN

Yeah.

PAUL

What should I do in the meantime?

DAN

I know it's hard, but try to relax.

The more worked up you are, the

more air you're going to use.

PAUL

I can't help it. I'm always

anxious. I take pills for it.

DAN

Do you have them with you?

PAUL

Yeah.

DAN

Take them. You need to preserve

your oxygen level any way you can.

PAUL

Okay.

45.

DAN

Is your Zippo still lit.

PAUL

Not now.

DAN

Good.

PAUL

I feel nauseous.

DAN

You have to calm down.

PAUL

I'm trying.

DAN

And you need to save that battery.

We're expecting some intel in about

ten minutes. Call me back then.

PAUL

Okay.

DAN

Just hang in there, Paul.

PAUL

Yeah. I'm trying.

PAUL

What?

JABIR

Did you make video?

46.

PAUL

No.

JABIR

(TO PAUL)

You make video!

PAUL

Let me out and I'll make it.

JABIR

No! You make video now. In box.

PAUL

I can't. I can't read the paper.

JABIR

Make video now!

PAUL

I can't. I don't know what you

want me to say. I can't read the

paper.

JABIR

You make video now.

47.

PAUL

I'm never getting out of here.

NURSING HOME NURSE

Mountain View Nursing Home.

PAUL

I was hoping I could speak with

Maryanne Conroy, please.

NURSING HOME NURSE

Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the

cordless phone to her room. Hold

on a moment, please.

48.

NURSING HOME NURSE (CONT'D)

Misses Conroy, you have a telephone

call, dear. Here, you can use this

phone.

MARYANNE

Hello?

PAUL

Mom...it's Paul.

MARYANNE

Who?

PAUL

It's Paul, Mom. Your son.

MARYANNE

My son?

PAUL

It's okay, Mom. How are you?

MARYANNE

I'm fine.

PAUL

That's good.

MARYANNE

Who are you?

PAUL

It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.

MARYANNE

Paulie?

PAUL

Yeah. Remember? We lived over on

Colfax Street, in the duplex.

Remember?

MARYANNE

(REMEMBERING SLIGHTLY)

Paulie?

PAUL

That's right, Mom.

49.

MARYANNE

Is this Paulie?

PAUL

It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's

everything at the home?

MARYANNE

Very nice. Your father and I have

been playing gin rummy every night.

PAUL

Yeah...I don't think Pop's there

with you, Mom.

MARYANNE

How are you doing, sweetie?

PAUL

Not very good. This...uh, this may

be the last time I talk to you.

MARYANNE

That's nice, honey.

PAUL

Did you get the flowers I sent a

few months ago?

MARYANNE

Flowers?

PAUL

Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen,

I...I'm going to go now. I just

wanted to talk to you, you know,

just to say bye. I love you, Mom.

PAUL(CONT'D)

Did you hear me? Mom? I told

you...do you want to tell me you

LOVE --

MARYANNE

Yes, dear. Your father and I have

been playing gin rummy every night.

Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi.

Two kids?

PAUL

Yes. She has two kids.

JABIR

PAUL

Okay! Okay, I'll make the video.

Just, please, don't shoot.

PAUL (CONT'D)

I need to hang up to make the

video. Okay? Is that okay?

JABIR

You have three minute to send

video.

52.

PAUL

(re: the script)

Fuck...

PAUL

(speaking at the phone)

My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an

American citizen from Hastings,

Michigan. I'm a civilian truck

driver for Crestin, Roland and

Thomas. I've been taken hostage

somewhere in Iraq...and I need one

million dollars by nine o'clock

tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll

be left to die in this coffin I'm

buried in. I've been told that

if...

PAUL (CONT'D)

...the money is paid, I will be let

go. If it's not, I will die in

here. These threats are real and

will be followed through on.

53.

FADE TO:

54.

55.

PAUL

No, no, no!!

56.

PAUL

(re: the phone screen)

There you are.

LINDA (V.O.)

Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a

message. Thanks and have a great

day.

PAUL

Linda, here's the number for the

phone. I just found it out. It's

07902-42-884. You have to use the

international calling code first.

(MORE)

57.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Please call me as soon as you get

this. I love you...I love you.

Call me right away. Please.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Oh shit.

PAUL

Son of a...

58.

WOMAN

My name is Pamela Gorham. I'm a

food service worker at F.O.B.

Anaconda, employed by Crestin,

Roland and Thomas. My captors'

requests for ransom have gone

unanswered, and --

WOMAN (CONT'D)

(to the person)

No...wait!! Please -- no!!

PAUL

No! No, no, no!!!

59.

DAN

Why the hell did you make that

video?

PAUL

It's all a bunch of lies.

PAUL

DAN

PAUL

DAN

PAUL

62.

DAN

I spoke with soldiers from the

third ID who were escorting your

convoy.

PAUL

They're alive?

DAN

Not all of them. Both Bradley

tanks were hit with IEDs. The rest

got caught in small arms fire.

(BEAT)

What the hell happened out there,

Paul?

DAN (CONT'D)

Paul.

PAUL

We had just left Anaconda,

everything seemed okay. We knew

that a bunch of our CB radios had

been stolen and that the Iraqis

were listening in, so we made sure

to switch from our usual channels.

Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the

convoy commander. She wanted to

ride with me like she usually did

when she hitched a ride from base,

but it seemed safer for her to be

with the C.C. As we headed down

the road, all these kids came

running into the street. Dozens of

them. It almost seemed like they

were expecting us, except we got

there faster than they thought we

would. So they run on up in front

of me, and I slam on my brakes.

The rest of the drivers were

already further up ahead, so they

kept going. Next thing I know, one

of the lead trucks got hit by an

IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the

radio saying, Sandman's hit,

Sandman's hit. He's...he's

everywhere.

(MORE)

63.

PAUL (CONT'D)

That's when the Iraqis came out of

their mud huts from the side of the

road and started shooting

everybody. I couldn't believe what

was happening. It seemed like slow-

motion, like I was watching it on

TV. People -- my friends -- were

getting killed, and all I could do

is watch. I didn't even notice

that the kids were throwing bricks

and rocks at me until one split my

windshield. Sort of snapped me out

of my trance. But then, I guess I

got hit in the head with a rock,

`cause I blacked out.

DAN

Do you happen to remem...mo...

nea...

64.

PAUL

(EXHAUSTED)

Oh no...no...

PAUL

This can't be happening.

PAUL (CONT'D)

No. Come on. Please work.

65.

PAUL

(FRANTICALLY)

Hello? Hello? Who's there?

ALAN DAVENPORT

Is this Paul Conroy?

PAUL

Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are

you?

ALAN DAVENPORT

Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm

the personnel director here at

Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

PAUL

I left you a message.

ALAN DAVENPORT

You did. I also heard from Rebecca

Browning over at the State

Department. Are you able to speak

on the status of your situation?

PAUL

It's worse. There was an explosion

or something. The coffin's

breaking, there's sand pouring in

from everywhere. I only have a

half an hour before --

ALAN DAVENPORT

Okay, okay. Slow down. You should

try to stay calm. Tell me

something, Paul, who have you

spoken to?

PAUL

The hostage takers, Dan Brenner

from the hostage working group --

ALAN DAVENPORT

Okay, Paul. I'm with you. How

about the media. I know your

ransom video leaked, but have you

spoken directly to anyone about

what's going on?

66.

PAUL

No.

ALAN DAVENPORT

That's good. It needs to stay that

way. It's important that we keep

this situation as contained as

possible.

PAUL

About three inches to my right,

there's a wall. Three inches to my

left, there's another wall. And

about four inches above my head,

there's a roof that's about to

collapse and drown me in sand. I

think this situation is pretty

contained.

ALAN DAVENPORT

I know you're upset --

PAUL

Help me! Help me! What are you

going to do to help me?!

ALAN DAVENPORT

I know you're upset. And, from

what I've been told, steps are

being taken to get you out of

there. So, hopefully it won't be

much longer.

PAUL

Thank God.

ALAN DAVENPORT

Yes, thank God.

(BEAT)

I'm going to switch on a recorder

right now. Just a second...

67.

ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)

This is Alan Davenport, Personnel

Director for Crestin, Roland and

Thomas, Incorporated. The date is

October 23, 2006. I am speaking

with Paul Conroy. Mister Conroy,

are you aware that I'm recording

this conversation?

PAUL

What...?

ALAN DAVENPORT

Please answer the question.

PAUL

Shit.

ALAN DAVENPORT

Mister Conroy?

PAUL

Yes. Yes!

ALAN DAVENPORT

And do I have your permission to do

so?

PAUL

Why do you need my permission?

What is all this?

ALAN DAVENPORT

I need you to answer yes or no,

please.

PAUL

Yes. Alright? Yes!

ALAN DAVENPORT

Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy,

when were you hired by CRT?

PAUL

About nine months ago. Around

January of 2005. Why are you

wasting time with this?

68.

ALAN DAVENPORT

I have your official date of hire

as January 4th, 2005. Is that

correct?

PAUL

Who cares? This is fucking crazy --

ALAN DAVENPORT

January 4th, 2005. Is that

correct?

PAUL

Yes!

ALAN DAVENPORT

And during your initial training,

before being sent to Iraq, were you

made aware of the dangers inherent

to the position for which you were

hired.

PAUL

You mean when I came down there to

Dallas and you guys said that all

of the trucks would be armored and

have bulletproof glass?

PAUL (CONT'D)

You mean when you told us that

things were safer than ever over

here? Is that when I was made

aware?

ALAN DAVENPORT

I need you to answer yes or no,

please.

PAUL

(BEAT)

Yes.

ALAN DAVENPORT

During that time, did you also

receive and sign an employment

contract with CRT, which thoroughly

explained company policy as it

pertained to your specific terms of

employment?

69.

PAUL

Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.

ALAN DAVENPORT

Yes or no.

PAUL

Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!

ALAN DAVENPORT

It's our understanding that you

were taken hostage in Iraq two

hours ago, is that also correct?

PAUL

Yes. That's completely correct.

What is the point of all this?

ALAN DAVENPORT

Our legal department requires that

we obtain a sworn affidavit from

employees, confirming that they

understand the reasons for their

forced separation from the company.

As of this morning, your employment

with CRT was officially terminated.

PAUL

Wait, wait, wait --

ALAN DAVENPORT

It was brought to our attention

that you were engaging in relations

with a fellow CRT employee --

Pamela Gorham.

PAUL

No. Wait --

ALAN DAVENPORT

Stipulated in your contract was a

fraternization clause, in which it

was stated quite clearly that any

relationship, be it romantic or

sexual in nature, deemed

inappropriate by CRT senior

officials is grounds for immediate

termination.

70.

PAUL

We...we were just friends.

ALAN DAVENPORT

Our records indicate differently.

PAUL

This is bullshit.

ALAN DAVENPORT

We're also legally required to

inform you that because you were

technically no longer under the

employ of CRT at the time of your

abduction, we cannot be held

accountable for any injury that may

befall upon you after your official

date and time of termination.

Therefore, in your case, that

includes this incident or any

consequences that may result from

it.

PAUL

What about my insurance money? My

family will need that money...

ALAN DAVENPORT

Given that you were alive up until

the time of your termination --

PAUL

You son of a bitch. You can't do

this.

ALAN DAVENPORT

Do you understand everything --

PAUL

You can't do this!

ALAN DAVENPORT

Do you understand everything

you've been told, Mister Conroy?

ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)

Mister Conroy?

71.

PAUL

Go to hell.

ALAN DAVENPORT

That concludes our interview with

Paul Conroy. I am now turning off

the recorder.

PAUL

You people can't just wash your

hands of this. You bastards put me

here.

ALAN DAVENPORT

I'm sorry.

PAUL

Come on...

PAUL

Answer the phone!!

72.

PAUL

(desperate, exhausted)

Why won't you answer?!!

DAN

Paul, is that you?

PAUL

They're dead.

DAN

How do you know that?

PAUL

I just do.

DAN

Three F-16s levelled parts of the

city a few minutes ago.

PAUL

I know. I felt it. Did they know

I was here?

DAN

(after a beat)

Yeah.

73.

PAUL

Did they care?

PAUL (CONT'D)

These people that took me -- if

they're dead, they can't tell you

where I am.

DAN

We can still try to track down your

signal.

PAUL

You tried that already.

DAN

We can try again.

PAUL (CONT'D)

It's over, isn't it?

DAN

No.

DAN (CONT'D)

Yeah.

PAUL

What should I do?

DAN

I don't know.

PAUL

That's right -- just like everyone

else on the planet, there are some

things you know and some things you

don't.

74.

DAN

I wish this could have gone

differently.

PAUL

Yeah...me too.

PAUL (CONT'D)

This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social

Security number 048-32-1198, date

of birth 3/19/68. This video will

serve as my last will and

testament. To my wife, Linda

Conroy, I leave the seven hundred

dollars in my personal savings and

whatever I have left in my annuity.

To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I

don't know. I don't have anything

else. My stuff, like, my clothes.

I wish I had more...I wish I had

done more. Your dad wasn't really

much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry.

Maybe if I was a famous baseball

player, or a guy who wore a suit to

work, I would have more to leave

you. But, you can be one of those

people if you want. You can be

whatever you want. Just promise me

that when you get older, you'll

take good care of your mom. And

promise me that you'll always try

to do the right thing, no matter

what. I love you very much, Shane.

Maybe I never said that

enough...maybe I did, I don't even

know. That probably means I

didn't.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry, Linda. I should have

listened to you.

75.

PAUL

You're not dead.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Hello? Hello?!

JABIR

Where is money?

PAUL

I don't know.

JABIR

What don't know?

PAUL

I don't know where the money is.

JABIR

Liar!

PAUL

I'm not lying! I swear.

JABIR

Swear?

PAUL

I'm telling the truth.

76.

JABIR

From Embassy, you get money now!

PAUL

I can't!

JABIR

You will!!

PAUL

I need more time. Please.

JABIR

No more time!

PAUL

There's sand pouring in here. I

can't...it's everywhere. Please,

let me out of here and I will get

you the money.

JABIR (CONT'D)

You show blood.

PAUL

What?

JABIR

You show blood, they give money.

77.

PAUL

No.

JABIR

You cut off thumb finger, send

video.

PAUL

I'm not doing that.

JABIR

Yes!

PAUL

No.

JABIR

No?

PAUL

That's right, no. You let me out

of here, and I'll cut off my whole

God damn hand if you want.

JABIR

You have wife?

PAUL

Yes, I do. And a son. A young

son. I want to go home...to see

them. Please, sir.

JABIR

Sir?

PAUL

Yes. Sir. I say that out of

respect...to you.

78.

JABIR

243 East Walnut Street. Hastings,

Michigan. U.S.A.

PAUL

(CONCERNED)

That's my...why did you say that?

JABIR

You show blood...or they show

blood.

PAUL

That's...you're lying. You're

nobody...all of you. You can't get

to them.

JABIR

No?

PAUL

No. You're peasants, criminals,

that's all. You don't even know

where Michigan is.

JABIR

Detroit. Ann Arbor.

PAUL

You looked at a map. That's all

you did.

JABIR

You show blood, or they show blood.

Send video by five minutes.

PAUL (CONT'D)

Don't stay at the house, whatever

you do, do not stay at the house.

The guy...the kidnapper, he knows

to the Sheriff's station if you

have to, just don't go home.

PAUL (CONT'D)

(re: the sand)

Holy God.

DAN

This is Daniel Brenner. Please

No...you have to hurry. The
