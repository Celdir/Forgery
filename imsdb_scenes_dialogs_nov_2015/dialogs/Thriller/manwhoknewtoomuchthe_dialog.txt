HANK

Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa

before? It looks familiar.

JO

We saw the same scenery last summer

driving to Las Vegas.

Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that

HANK

Hey look - a camel!

JO

This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's

French Morocco.

BEN

(To her)

Northern Africa.

HANK

Still seems like Las Vegas.

BEN

(Slightly indignant)

We're only a hundred miles north of

the Sahara Desert!

HANK

I dunno. In school they called it the

Dark Continent.

(He squints)

It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!

BEN

Just wait till you see Marrakesh.

HANK

Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink.

BEN

You bet it does.

Pardon me.

BEN

I'd like to thank you. Without your

help, anything might have happened.

LOUIS

(smiles pleasantly)

A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments

in life when we all need a little help.

BEN

May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.

LOUIS

How do you do, madame.      My name is

Louis Bernard.

JO

Thank you, Mr. Bernard.

BEN

And this is our son, Hank.

LOUIS

Hallo, Hank.

HANK

You talk Arab talk.

LOUIS

A few words.

JO

Why was he so angry?      It was an

accident.

LOUIS

(Half shrugs)

The Moslem religion allows for few

accidents.

(To Ben)

May I be permitted to sit down?

BEN

Oh, sure, sure.      0f course.   Next to

Jo, there.

LOUIS

(Pauses)

I thought his name was Hank.

BEN

Oh, uh --

BEN (CONT'D)

(smiles)

That's my wife's name. Jo.      Jay oh.

No "e."

LOUIS

How different.

BEN

For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,

nobody knows her by any other name.

HANK

I do.   Mummy.

LOUIS

Now about the "accident." You see, a

Moslem woman never takes off her veil

in public under any circumstances.

HANK

They feed her intervaneously?

LOUIS

Quite a big word for such a small boy.

BEN

I'm a doctor.

LOUIS

Oh.   Well, he sounds like one.

BEN

He can spell "haemoglobin" -- but he

has trouble with "cat" and "dog."

LOUIS

(Laughs)

And where do you practice, Doctor?

BEN

Indianapolis, Indiana.   The Good

Samaritan.

LOUIS (O.S.)

What brings you to Marrakesh?

BEN

We've been to a medical convention in

Paris. And while we were in Europe, I

thought I'd like to see Morocco again.

HANK

Daddy liberated Africa.

BEN

I was up around Casablanca with an

Army field hospital, that's all.

JO

Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?

LOUIS

Oh no.

(To Ben)

I suppose you came directly from Paris?

BEN

We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few

days.

HANK

And Casablanca.

LOUIS

I hope you will have time to truly

enjoy Marrakesh.

BEN

At the most we'll have three days.

LOUIS

You will naturally be stopping at the

hotel Mamounia or La Menara?

JO

Why?

LOUIS

(smiles)

They are hotels for tourists of good

taste.

JO

Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?

LOUIS

Sometimes.

HANK

Do you eat snails.

LOUIS

When I'm lucky enough to got them.

HANK

If you ever get hungry, our garden

back home is full of snails.

LOUIS

(Chuckles)

Thank you for the invitation.

HANK

That's all right. We tried everything

to got rid of them. We never thought

of a Frenchman.

HANK

Next time take the train.

BEN

(To Louis)

Would you like to share our taxi to

the hotel?

LOUIS

That's kind of you, doctor, but

unfortunately I have some business

first.

JO

What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?

LOUIS

However, I'll be there later - perhaps

we might have a drink together.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  11.

BEN

All right. But I'll serve the drinks

in our suite.

LOUIS

In that case, I will take you to dinner.

BEN

No.   Now that's not a fair bargain.

LOUIS

But I know Marrakesh. I can show you

an intriguing Arab restaurant where

the food is different, and the manner

of eating exotic.

BEN

(Gives in)

Well -- that's what we came here for.

Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian

Nights?

JO

(Smiles agreeably)

Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade.

BEN

You'll do.

LOUIS

How would you prefer to travel to the

hotel? By taxi? Fiacre?

HANK

A wagon!   I want to ride in a wagon!

LOUIS

Au revoir.   I look forward to cocktails.

JO

Goodbye.

BEN

See you later. And thinks again.

Hold on.   Hold on!   Here we go!

J0

Ben -- I just saw Louis Bernard talking

to that Arab.

BEN

What Arab?

JO

The one who was shouting at Hank for

taking the woman's veil. He and the

Frenchman were talking like old friends.

BEN

All right. Let's assume they knew

each other, and Louis Bernard didn't

bother to tell us. What does that

mean?

JO

It means Mr. Bernard is a very

mysterious man.

BEN

He struck me as quite normaL

JO

What do you know about him?

BEN

I know his name...and, uh....

JO

You see? And he knows you' re an

American living in Indianapolis,

Indiana. A doctor at the Good

Samaritan. You have a garden with

snails, a wife, a boy who can spell

haemoglobin. You went to a medical

convention in Paris. Stopped at Rome,

Lisbon, Casablanca. You once served

in North Africa with an Army field

Hospital --

Now hold on. Wait a minute.     We were

just talking casually...

Not talking.

He was asking, you were telling. You

BEN

What difference does it make?    I have

nothing to hide.

JO

Maybe Mr. Bernard has.

BEN

Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco.

Inscrutable natives gliding through

twisted, narrow streets, but --

JO

(Irritated at not

being taken

seriously)

Oh, Ben!

BEN

Then relax. You're just mad because

he didn't ask any questions about you.

JO

Bitter medicine, doctor.   But I'll

swallow it.

JO

Well.   This eases the pain.

HANK

What pain, mummy?

JO

Just an expression.

HANK

One chorus, and that's all.

Oh?

I thought you might have seen me in

Paris -- being French, and --

The theater, requires time, and for me

time is often a luxury.

Have you ever been to Paris, Mr.

I was born there.

What do you do for a living?

Buy and sell.

What?

Whatever gives the best profit.

Jo, will you stop imagining things?

Good evening.

I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my

husband.

DRAYTON

How do you do, sir!

BEN

How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs.

McKenna.

DRAYTON

My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared

at the London Palladium a few years

ago.

MRS. DRAYTON

Of course we hardly ever see a show.

Edward is such an old stick-in-the-

mud. So I have to console myself with

your records.

DRAYTON

And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not

one for this terrible Bee Bop or

whatever you call it.

Thank you, Mr. Drayton.

MRS. DRAYTON

When are you coming back to London?

JO

Possibly never again, professionally.

Broadway musical shows produced in

Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if

we lived in New York...

(For Ben's benefit)

...where I hear doctors aren't

starving...

BEN

(To Jo)

I have nothing against working  in New

York. Nothing except the fact   that

it's very hard for my patients  to come

all the way from Indianapolis  for

treatment.

MRS. DRAYTON

Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying

the wrong thing.

JO

Not the least, Mrs. Drayton.

MRS. DRAYTON

Tell me; Dr. McKenna do you always.....

BEN

Do you think we could get straightened

around.

DRAYTON

Only the first two fingers and thumb

of the right hand. Never use the

smaller fingers. And always keep the

left hand in the lap.

JO

Does it have something to do with

religion?

DRAYTON

More social than religious, I'd say.

BEN

It seems to me if you have four good

fingers, and a thumb, you should use

them all.

J0

Three finger -- four fingers -- for my

money this is nothing but chicken in

the rough. We have it at every drive-

in back home.

DRAYTON

Well, as I was saying, I was quite

happy farming my bit of land It

Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from

the United Nations started worrying

me.

MRS. DRAYTON

Edward was a big noise at the Ministry

of Food during the war, you know.

DRAYTON

So, I pulled myself up by the roots,

and here we are. United Nations Relief.

BEN

That sounds like interesting work.

DRAYTON

You should see my report on soil erosion

in Morocco...

expect him to change his whole life --

JO

Oh, Ben!   What's the matter with you?!

BEN

Nothing!   What's the matter with you?!

JO

I just don't like to be both privately

and publicly insulted.

BEN

Can you blame him? Turning down an

old married couple for a date with a

girl like that?

We're not an old married couple! All

right -- He's a heel. I don't

I must do some shopping in the market

tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine.

Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I

how our English weather is awful, but

I sometimes think we don't know when

we're lucky. All this sunshine, day

after day. It seems unnatural, somehow.

BEN

I want to get up.

Ben, I know you -- once you get worked

up, you'll start a fight. Now please,

sit down and forget him.

DRAYTON

(To the McKennas)

By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd

let us show you round the market place,

tomorrow.

JO

Louis Bernard, the big buyer from

Paris, was going to take us through

the market tomorrow.

BEN

Good. I'll just go over and cancel

Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets,

we could at least redecorate the house.

Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab-

outfit, wearing makeup?

BEN

What's more important -- why was he

killed?

JO

I'll bet he was a spy, or something

like that.

JO

Ben, what did he whisper to you?    What

did you write down?

BEN

I'll tell you later.

JO

What is it?

BEN

I don't feel very good after what I

said about Louis Bernard last night.

JO

I have to stretch.

DRAYTON

I'm afraid the questions will go on

till doomsday, if you admit knew this

chap Bernard before.

BEN

I didn't know him at all.     We only met

yesterday on a bus.

DRAYTON

They're a cynical lot, these French --

they might refuse to believe that.

BEN

They'll have to believe me.     It's true.

DRAYTON

It might sound a bit odd,    from their

point of view. They saw     the poor chap

whispering to you ... and    then they

saw you writing something    down...

INSPECTOR

Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a

translator will not be necessary.

Your passports, please.

INSPECTOR

You entered French Morocco four days

BEN

That's right.

INSPECTOR

You are a doctor, monsieur?

BEN

A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American

citizen.

INSPECTOR

Three good reasons why you should have

nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

BEN

I didn't have.

INSPECTOR

You were recently in Paris?

BEN

A medical convention.

INSPECTOR

You come to   Marrakesh with him in the

same bus.    You drank an aperitif with

him in your   hotel room. And you ate

at the same   restaurant last night.

JO

But at different tables.

INSPECTOR

So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to

you?

BEN

I met him yesterday -- on the bus --

for the first time in my life.

INSPECTOR

(ironically)

And yet -- out of five  thousand people --

In a great market place  -- he comes to

you when he is about to  die! Is that

the action of a casual  acquaintance,

monsieur?

BEN

(Obstinate)

I know nothing about Louis Bernard.

INSPECTOR

No? Not even, I suppose, that he was

an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau?

BEN

What's that?

INSPECTOR

Perhaps you have also never head of

the American F.B.I.?

(Sadly)

It would be so much more easy for both

of us, monsieur, if you would cease to

pretend.

BEN

Now, look here...

INSPECTOR

(Patiently)

The dead man found out what he had

been sent here to discover. That is

why he was kill-ed. He told you what

he had discovered. Why? Because he

placed complete confidence in you.

Voila.

BEN

Boy, you not only ask the questions

you also answer them -- Wait a minute

let me ask you a question.

INSPECTOR

Indeed, Monsieur?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 49.

Assuming Bernard trusted me as

implicitly as you say, I would never

reveal anything he said to me, would

I?

INSPECTOR

Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes

find it desirable to betray a

confidence?

BEN

Let's get something straight. I'm a

tourist traveling for pleasure. I

somehow got involved in an unfortunate

incident. I came down here to make a

simple statement of fact, and not to

be subjected to a police grilling.

INSPECTOR

Monsieur, I would like....

That was nice of him.

(Looking at Inspector)

I told him if we weren't back there in

fifteen minutes to call the American

Consulate in Casablanca.

But, Monsieur, if you had only told me

in the first place, that you wished to

consult with your consul!

was a college professor. The only

thing to do now is to get out of

Marrakesh.

As individuals we're helpless here.

And because of that phone call, we

can't bring the police in on it. I

even thought of taking that chance.

But connect Hank's disappearance to

Louis Bernard's murder. And the first

thing they'd do would be to make me

tell them Louis Bernard's message.

Hello,  Val. Jo and I want to thank

all of  you for the lovely flowers.

But you  shouldn't have. We might not

be here  long!

Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell?

Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I

It's McKenna...Doctor McKenna.      Welcome

to London Town, doctor.

JAN

(Toward Ben)

Oh, I am sorry.

(To Jo)

I knew you were married, but a doctor.

How clever! Especially in such a

psychosomatic business. Why --

CINDY

Will you be quiet!

JAN

Cindy!

CINDY

You don't know what psychosomatic means.

JAN

I do too! It means when your mind

gets sick of your body it does something

to it --

CINDY

The doctor's trying to talk on the

phone.

BEN

It's only business.   It's nothing.

HELEN

Business is everything.     Shhh.

BEN

Hello?

(He tries to keep

voice down)

Mr. Ambrose Chappell?

Benjamin McKenna.

I don't think we need to be quiet.

Would you like some drinks?

BEN

Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at

your address for a while? Uh huh,

it's just some business. Nothing big.

Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop

around.

JAN

See.   We could have talked.

J0

(Smiles)

That's what I told you.

JO

(To group)

I'd like everyone to meet my husband.

VAL

(Takes his hand)

I've heard so much about you, Doctor,

it's nice to see you in person.

HELEN

You look just like, those pictures Jo

had in her dressing room four years

ago. Haven't changed a bit.

JAN

Why should he? He's a doctor.   Probably

gets free hormones.

JO

And this one is Jan Peterson who sing

almost as well as I do, but can handle

those legs like Nijinsky.

BEN

I can believe it.   How do you do, Jan.

JAN

When Nijinsky got off the stage he was

through with his footwork. That's

just when mine begins.

JO

And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful

expatriate I've ever known.

BEN

(Nods to her)

Haven't you been home recently?

CINDY

How can I go back to Harrisburg?    They

know me there as Elva MacDuff

(Shake's her head,

pats her wide hips)

Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.

VAL

Where's your boy? I'd like to see

which one you he looks like.

BEN

He -- he's staying with some other

people -- so we can have a little time

to ourselves.

JAN

What's his name?

JO

(Tonelessly)

Hank. Henry, really.

CINDY

I hope he has your looks, and the

doctor's brains.

Thank you again for the beautiful

flowers.

JO

Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...

BEN

(To Val)

Will you order the stuff?

BEN

I'll be back in a little while.

HELEN

Aren't you going to wait for a drink,

doctor.

BEN

Thank you, but I'll catch up when I

get back.

You can't.   I won't disappear.   Promise.

Ben, for the last time, please let me

Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose

I have been Ambrose Chappell for nearby

seventy-one years.

But I think I understand your problem.

BEN

You do?

CHAPPELL SR

Certainly. It happens all the time.

You expected someone else -- Just a

moment.

out)

Ambrose!

CHAPPELL SR.

I think this gentleman wants to talk

to us.

CHAPPELL JR.

Now, father. Now why don't you go and

have a nice rest?

I'm Doctor Mckenna.

Does the name mean anything to you?

CHAPPELL

I don't think so.

BEN

You have no idea why I came here?

CHAPPELL JR.

My dear sir, I haven't the faintest

idea!

BEN

I was given your name by someone I

happened to meet in Marrakesh.

CHAPPELL JR.

Oh, yes?

BEN

I suppose you've heard of him.    Louis

Bernard. A Frenchman.

CHAPPELL JR.

Louis Bernard?

BEN

Let's stop fencing with words, huh?

Bernard told me to come here, just

before he died.

CHAPPELL JR.

This man is...dead?

BEN

You know it as well as I do. Now I

came to make a business proposition.

And I don't see how you can turn it

down.

CHAPPEEL JR.

What did you have in mind?

BEN

You want to talk here?

CHAPPELL JR.

Certainly. We have no secrets from

our employees.

BEN

Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered

one word of what Bernard told to before

he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm

not interested in political intrigue,

and I don't care who it is you're going

to kill here in London. All I want is

that boy, and I'll get on the first

plane for America.

BEN

Now that isn't all.   If money will do

anything...

CHAPPELL JR.

Father -- phone the police!   Quick!

CHAPPELL JR.

Now, sir -- shall we go into this a

little more carefully? You said

something about money?

BEN

You told him to call the police.   Now

don't try to bluff me like that!

CHAPPELL SR.

This is Ambrose Chappell's -- Burdett

Street. Will you send someone round

at once?

(Glancing toward

him)

There's is an extraordinary individual

Ambrose Chapel.

off.

CINDY

What a temptation.

Can you fathom it, Val?

VAL

It must be a now American gag.    I'll

ask Danny about it.

BEN

Where's Jo?

VAL

She's just gone off to Ambrose Chapel.

But -- but, that's where I've been...

What is it?

DRAYTON

A record of the delightful Picco they

will play tonight.

RIEN

What about it?

DRAYTON

Music is less in your line than

marksmanship. If you will listen, my

friend, I will play for you the exact

moment at which you can shoot. Now

listen carefully.

DRAYTON

Let me do it for you again.   Now listen

for the cymbal crash.

DRAYTON

You see at such a moment your shot

will not be heard. The listeners will

not even be disturbed. I think the

composer would have appreciated that.

No one will know.

RIEN

None except one you mean.

DRAYTON

Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend.

Any questions musical or otherwise?

RIEN

No.

DRAYTON

There's's one comforting thought. It

happens early in the evening. I hope

I won't upset you if I say there's

time for one shot only. If you need

another, the risk is yours.

DRAYTON

That's a comfort -- traipsing all the

should like you to do me credit.

DRAYTON

Your distinguished target's on the way

there now. A car is waiting for you

downstairs at the back entrance. You

will pick up a Miss Benson on your

way. She will be your companion in

the box. She's there to lend an air

of respectability...if that's possible.

RIEN

You will have the money when I return?

DRAYTON

I think you can trust me.

RIEN

(Looking him up and

down)

What is your English proverb -- a wolf

in Sheep's clothing?

DRAYTON

I think you    had better be going. It

is impolite    to be late for a concert.

It would be    awkward if they made you

wait until    the first selection is over.

See him downstairs, my dear.

But I believe we should pause now to

do a little stock-taking -- to look

into our own hearts and see what we

find there. Therefore instead of

continuing the service, I think we

should all return to our homes for

private meditation, remembering how

little we have to complain of and how

much to be grateful for. Next week I

shall discuss the fruits of our

meditation. Until then, my blessing

BEN

Then he didn't kill him?

ASSISTANT MANAGER

Your wife saved him -- it is only a

small flesh wound...Oh here he is

now...you must come and meet him...don't

be nervous...I'll get the aide to

present you...it will be all right

(To Woburn)

Would you present the lady to the prime

minister?

BUCHANAN

I'll report to you fully at the Embassy,

Your Excellency. In the meantime...

WOBURN

Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady

who --

PRIME MINISTER

My dear lady, I shall be for ever in

your debt.

WOBURN

And this is her husband --

PRIME MINISTER

A pleasure, my dear sir...

(He turns to Jo)

I trust you will permit me to wait

upon you tomorrow and to express the

depth of my gratitude.

JO

(Weakly)

It wasn't -- it wasn't --

PRIME MINISTER

(Gallantly)

Oh but it was, my dear lady.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 136.

WOBURN

I think Mr. Buchanan would like to

talk to you.

JO

(Wildly)

Where's our boy?   Where's Hank?

BUCHANAN

(quietly)

We can talk if you'll come in here.

BUCHANAN

(Coldly)

So you both know the time and place

all along.

BEN

(Roughly)

Don't be a fool.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                137.

BUCHANAN

An odd coincidence -- both of you

turning up here.

BEN

(Coldly)

Too bad you didn't contact your

assistant. He sent us both here.

BUCHANAN

(Quickly)

I beg your pardon.

BEN

You see, we finally needed that help

you offered. We still need it.

JO

(Urgently)

Yes, Mr. Buchanan.     We still need it.

DETECTIVE

Sir?

DETECTIVE

We've questioned the woman. Said she

bought a ticket that happened to place

her in the same box with the man that

did the shooting. Doesn't know anything --

but if she does, she's not talking.

BUCHANAN

I'll see her later.

DETECTIVE

Very good, sir.

BUCHANAN

(Gently)

Please tell me everything, now.

Everything.

(go turns to Jo)

There's still plenty of room for hope,

Mrs. McKenna...

FOOTMAN

His Excellency will see you now.

AMBASSADOR

Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman

won't talk, she won't talk and that's

that, I suppose. All right.

DRAYTON

(Easily)

Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain

to you -- something very unusual has

happened. I must also have the money

to pay our French marksman.

AMBASSADOR

(Almost casually)

Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering

that he's dead?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               139.

AMBASSADOR

His aim wasn't quite as good as you

led me to expect. The target merely

received a slight flesh wound in the

arm. Worse than useless.

AMBASSADOR

Then your French friend panicked, and

made a fatal crash -- landing on the

floor of the Albert Hall.

DRAYTON

(Blustering weakly)

I don't see how you can hold me

responsible. He was most warmly

recommended by our people in

Marrakesh...

AMBASSADOR

I'm glad you're able to treat the matter

so lightly. I am holding a reception

here this evening. In a few minutes,

I have to welcome our Prime Minister

as my guest of honor -- when I hope

and expected that he would be totally

unable to attend. That amuses you, no

doubt?

DRAYTON

(Feebly)

I don't know what to say ...

AMBASSADOR

(Brutally)

No. But I do. You've muddled

everything from the start. Kidnapping

that child in Marrakesh...Don't you

realize that Americans dislike having

their children kidnapped?

DRAYTON

(Trying to keep his

end up)

How else could I make sure the American

would hold his tongue?

AMBASSADOR

(Ignoring this)

And then, to crown it all, you get

cold feet and come running along here

to hide -- and bring the child with

you: Don't you see what you've done to

the diplomatic status of this Embassy?

DRAYTON

(Weakly)

I didn't think...I only thought...

AMBASSADOR

(Staccato)

How are you going to get the child out

of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?

DRAYTON

(Struggling for

self-confidence)

There's no difficulty about that,

surely? The car --

AMBASSADOR

(Interrupting)

With plain-clothes detectives planted

right round this building?

(Wryly)

You English intellectuals will be the

death of us all.

DRAYTON

(Desperate)

I'll think of some method.   Just give

me time....

AMBASSADOR

(He snorts

Contemptuously)

Time!

AMBASSADOR

I want the child removed from this

Embassy, and removed in such a way

that he won't be able to say any more

where he has been tonight.

MRS. DRAYTON

Oh, no!

DRAYTON

Right, I'll see to it..

AMBASSADOR

Come in.

BUTLER

Your Excellency, the Princess should

be arriving at any moment.

BEN

...recognized him, and he recognized

me. So he jumped for it. And that is

all.

BUCHANAN

(Slowly)

Trying to liquidate one of their own

big-shots. I wish they'd stick to

their usual custom, and do it in their

own country...

WOBURN

Hello.

(He listens for a

moment)

Hold on.

BUCHANAN

(To phone)

Buchanan speaking.

BUCHANAN

Right.    Bye.

BUCHANAN

The Draytons are at the Embassy.

JO

How do you know?

BUCHANAN

We have ways of finding out -- from

the inside.

BEN

If the Draytons are at the Embassy,

Hank has to be there too!

BUCHANAN

(Grimly)

You're probably right.   But we can do

nothing.

BEN

Why can't you?

BUCHANAN

Every Embassy in a foreign country has

extra-territorial rights.

BEN

What does that mean in common language?

BUCHANAN

As far as we're concerned, this Embassy

stands on foreign soil.

BEN

Does that mean they can steal children

and get away with it?

BUCHANAN

We could have the Foreign Office serve

a writ on the Ambassador.

BUCHANAN

...You know, I'm not responsible for

the complications of International

Law...

BUCHANAN

...If only we had positive proof that

the boy really is in there.

BEN

What's the telephone number of this

Embassy.

WONBURN

Grosvenor 0144.

JO

What are you thinking about, Ben?

BEN

Grosvenor 0144.

BEN

I'm going to speak to the Minister

himself.

BEN

May I speak to the Prime Minister,

please?

BEN

Tell him the lady who saved his life

wants to speak to him. Its important.

JO

What am I supposed to say, Ben? I

don't know --

(She trails off)

Ben, half looking at Woburn and

Buchanan, gives her instructions.

BFN

He said he wanted to visit us soon so

he could thank you.

BFN (CONT'D)

Well, tell him we'd like to see him

tonight, at the Embassy, because we

have to leave London tomorrow.

PRIME MINISTER

My dear lady...This is a charming

surprise...

PRIME MINISTER

Delighted, delighted, delighted. The

Ambassador, too, will be delighted.

Any friends of mine are friends of

his. We will drink a little toast to

your country and to mine. Peacefully

we will co-exist...Yes?

JO

(To Ben)

He said -- all right.

(Suavely)

Madame, you saved the life of the one

man, who is irreplaceable in our

Country.

PRIME MINISTER

(Suddenly to Jo)

They tell me you are the famous Jo

Conway, Madame?

JO

Yes.   I'm Jo Conway.

PRIME MINISTER

(To Ben)

Do you think perhaps Madame might be

persuaded to sing?

BEN

(interrupting)

I'm sure she would be glad to...

wouldn't you dear?

JO

Well, I don't know.     It's been some

time...

PRIME MINISTER

I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to

conclude a dramatic evening!

JO

All right.   I'm very flattered.

AMBASSADOR

(To butler)

Stanis would you put up some chairs

quickly.

(To guests)

Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us

tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo

Conway...she has graciously consented

to sing for us ..

Darling would you see that the Prime

Minister has a very good seat.

Don't ask me for help, you miserable....
