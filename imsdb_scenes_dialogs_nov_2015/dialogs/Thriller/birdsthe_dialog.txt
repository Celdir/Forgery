"THE BIRDS" - by Evan Hunter - 2nd Revision

"THE BIRDS"

by

Evan Hunter

Based on the novel "Birds"

By

Daphne Du Maurier

FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

MELANIE

Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever

seen so many gulls?

MRS. MACGRUDER

Hello, Miss Daniels.

MELANIE

What do you suppose it is?

MRS. MACGRUDER

(shaking her head)

There must be a storm at sea. That

can drive them inland, you know.

MRS. MACGRUDER

I was hoping you'd be a little late,

Miss Daniels.

(apologetically)

You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

MELANIE

You said three o'clock.

MRS. MACGRUDER

I know. Oh, I know.

(she is more distressed

now)

I've been calling all morning. Oh,

you have no idea. Miss Daniels,

they're so difficult to get, really

they are. We get them from India,

you know, when they're just little

chicks, and then we have to...

MELANIE

Well, this one won't be a chick,

will he?

MRS. MACGRUDER

Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly

not. This will be a full grown myna

bird. Full grown.

MELANIE

And he'll talk?

MRS. MACGRUDER

Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no.

You'll have to teach him to talk.

MELANIE

Yes.

MRS. MACGRUDER

Yes.

(pause)

Oh my, I suppose I should call them

again. They said three o'clock.

(pause)

Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.

Would you mind waiting?

MELANIE

(judiciously)

I think maybe you'd better deliver

him. Let me give you my address.

(she begins taking

off her gloves)

MRS. MACGRUDER

(producing pencil and

pad)

Oh. Oh, well, all right.

MRS. MACGRUDER

I'm sure they're on the way, though.

Could I just call?

MELANIE

(with a resigned sigh)

Well, all right, but...

MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)

Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at

Davidson's.

(pause; accusingly)

It's past three, you know.

(pause)

Well, how long do you think...? All

right, would you check it please?

Yes, I'll wait.

MITCH

I wonder if you could help me.

MELANIE

What?

MITCH

(deliberately, and

with a touch of

hauteur)

I said I wonder if you could help

me.

MELANIE

(solicitously)

Yes, what was it you were looking

for, sir?

MITCH

(deadpan)

Lovebirds.

MELANIE

Lovebirds, sir?

MITCH

Yes. I understand there are different

varieties, it that true?

MELANIE

Well... yes, sir, there are.

MITCH

These are for my sister... her

birthday you see. As she'll be eleven

and... well, frankly, I wouldn't

want a pair of birds that were too

demonstrative.

MELANIE

I understand completely, sir.

MITCH

As the same time, I wouldn't want

birds that were aloof, either.

MELANIE

(leading him around

shop)

No, of course not.

MITCH

Do you have a pair that are just

friendly?

MELANIE

I think so, sir.

(she looks around)

Now then, let me see.

MITCH

(at the finches)

Aren't these lovebirds?

MELANIE

No, sir, those are... redbirds.

MITCH

The sign says strawberry finches.

MELANIE

(airily)

Yes, we call them that too.

(she moves away)

Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...

(and stops before a

cage of canaries)

MITCH

Those are canaries, Miss.

(pause)

Doesn't this make you feel awful?

MELANIE

(baffled)

Doesn't what make me...?

MITCH

All these innocent little creatures

caged up like this?

MELANIE

Well, we can't just let them fly

around the shop, you know.

MITCH

I suppose not. Is there an

ornithological reason for keeping

them in separate cages?

MELANIE

Oh, certainly. It's to protect the

species.

MITCH

I imagine that's very important.

Especially during the moulting season.

MELANIE

Yes, that's a particularly dangerous

time.

MITCH

Are they moulting now?

MELANIE

Some of them are.

MITCH

How can you tell?

MELANIE

Well... they get a sort of hangdog

expression.

MITCH

Yes, I see.

(pause)

About those lovebirds, Miss...

MELANIE

Are you sure you wouldn't like to

see a canary instead? We have some

very nice canaries this week.

MITCH

All right.

(he smiles)

She smiles back.

MITCH

(he waits)

All right, may I see one, please?

MELANIE

(feebly)

Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

MELANIE

Oh!  Ohhhhh!

MRS. MACGRUDER

What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the

birds is loose!

MITCH

Shhh! Shhhh!

MELANIE

There we are!

MRS. MACGRUDER

Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

MITCH

(putting the canary

in)

Back into your gilded cage, Melanie

Daniels.

MELANIE

What did you say?

MITCH

(savoring this)

I was merely drawing a parallel,

Miss Daniels.

MELANIE

But how... how do you know my name?

MITCH

(secretly)

A little birdie told me.

(he smiles politely)

Good day, Miss Daniels.

(he bows to Mrs.

MacGruder)

Madam.

(he starts out)

MELANIE

Hey, wait a minute!

MELANIE

I don't know you.

MITCH

Ahhh, but I know you.

MELANIE

How?

MITCH

We met in court.

MELANIE

We never met in court or anyplace

else.

MITCH

That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw

you in court.

MELANIE

When?

MITCH

Do you remember one of your practical

jokes that resulted in the smashing

of a plate glass window?

MELANIE

I didn't break that window!

MITCH

No, but your little prank did. The

judge should have put you behind

bars!

MELANIE

What are you? A policeman?

MITCH

I simply believe in the law, Miss

Daniels, and I'm not too keen on

practical jokers.

MELANIE

What do you call your lovebird story

if not a practical...

MITCH

Ahhh, but I really do want those

birds.

MELANIE

You knew I didn't work here. You

deliberately...

MITCH

Right. I recognized you when I came

in. I thought you might like to know

what it felt like to be on the other

end of a gag. What do you think of

that, Miss Daniels?

MELANIE

I think you're a louse.

MITCH

I am.

(he tips his hat)

Good day.

(to Mrs. MacGruder)

Madam.

(and he goes down the

steps)

MELANIE

And I'm glad you didn't get your

lovebirds!

MITCH

(breezily, as he goes

out)

I'll find something else.

(he gives a slight

bow)

See you in court some day.

MELANIE

(angrily)

That... that... who was that?

MRS. MACGRUDER

I have no idea.

MELANIE

Have you got a pencil?

MRS. MACGRUDER

What? Oh, yes, certainly.

MRS. MACGRUDER

They said the myna bird would be

here later this afternoon. If you'd

care to come back...

MELANIE

No, you'd better send him. May I use

your phone?

MRS. MACGRUDER

(bewildered by

everything)

Yes, certainly.

(she puts phone on

counter)

MELANIE

(as she dials)

Do you have any lovebirds?

MRS. MACGRUDER

No, not in the shop. But I can order

them for you.

MELANIE

How soon?

MRS. MACGRUDER

Well... well, how soon would you

want them?

MELANIE

Immediately.

(into phone)

Is this the Daily News? Melanie

Daniels. Would you get me the city

desk, please?

MRS. MACGRUDER

I might be able to have them by

tomorrow morning. Would that be all

right?

MELANIE

(with an edged anger)

That would be just fine.

(into phone)

Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I

want you to do a favor for me.

(pause)

No, this is a small one.

(pause)

Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling,

would I try to pressure you?  Will

you call the Department of Motor

Vehicles for me and find out who

owns this license plate? DKQ dash

one seven six.

(pause)

Yes, a California plate.

(pause)

No, I'll stop up there in a little

while. Is daddy in his office?

(pause)

Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in

on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see

him later. Thank you, Charlie.

(she hangs up)

MELANIE

Now. What time tomorrow morning?

MAN'S VOICE

Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

MAN

Is that for Mitch Brenner?

MELANIE

(curtly)

Yes.

MAN

He's not home.

MELANIE

That's all right.

MAN

He won't be back until Monday. I

mean, if those birds are for him....

MELANIE

Monday?

MAN

Yes. I don't think you should leave

them in the hall, do you?

MELANIE

(trapped)

Well, I...

MELANIE

Well, where did he go?

MAN

Bodega Bay. He goes up there every

weekend.

MELANIE

Bodega Bay? Where's that?

MAN

Up on the coast. About sixty miles

north of here.

MELANIE

Sixty...

(her face falls)

Oh.

MAN

About an hour and a half on the

freeway. Or two if you take the coast

highway.

MELANIE

Oh.

MAN

I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm

going away myself. Someone's got to

feed them, I suppose.

MELANIE

(in utter despair now)

Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

MAN

(apologetically)

I'm awfully sorry.

MELANIE

Oh, shut up!

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

Good morning.

CLERK

(without looking up)

Morning.

MELANIE

I wonder if you could help me.

CLERK

Try my best.

MELANIE

I'm looking for a man named Mitchell

Brenner.

CLERK

Yep.

MELANIE

Do you know him?

CLERK

Yep.

MELANIE

Where does he live?

CLERK

Right here. Bodega Bay.

MELANIE

Yes, but where?

CLERK

Right across the bay there.

MELANIE

Where?

CLERK

See where I'm pointing?

MELANIE

Yes?

CLERK (O.S.)

See them two big trees across there?

MELANIE (O.S.)

Yes?

CLERK (O.S.)

And the white house?

MELANIE (O.S.)

That's where the Brenners live.

MELANIE

The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

CLERK

Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

MELANIE

The two kids?

CLERK

Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

MELANIE

I see. How do I get down there?

CLERK

Follow the road straight through

town 'til it curves off on the left.

That'll take you right around the

bay to their front door.

MELANIE

The front door.

(pause)

Isn't there a back road I can take?

CLERK

Nope. That's the road. Straight

through town, stay on your left,

right around the bay to the front

door.

MELANIE

You see, I wanted to surprise them.

CLERK

Mmmm.

MELANIE

I didn't want to come right down the

road, where they could see me.

CLERK

Mmmm.

MELANIE

It's a surprise, you see.

CLERK

Mmmmmm.

(long pause)

'Course, you could get yourself a

boat, cut right across the bay with

it. The Brenners got a little dock

there you could tie up at. If that's

what you wanted to do.

MELANIE

Where would I get a boat?

CLERK

Down at the dock by the Tides

Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard

boat?

MELANIE

(looking at him)

Of course.

CLERK

(looks back at her)

D'you want me to order one for you?

MELANIE

(surprised)

Thank you.

CLERK

What name?

MELANIE

Daniels.

CLERK

Okay.

MELANIE

I wonder if you could tell me...

CLERK

Yep?

MELANIE

The little girl's name.

CLERK

The little Brenner girl?

MELANIE

Yes.

CLERK

Alice, I think.

(he turns, shouts to

someone in rear)

Harry, what's the little Brenner

girl's name?

HARRY'S VOICE

(shouting)

What?

CLERK

(shouting)

The little Brenner girl.

HARRY'S VOICE

(shouting)

Lois!

CLERK

(shouting)

It's Alice, ain't it?

HARRY'S VOICE

(shouting)

No, it's Lois!

CLERK

(to Melanie)

It's Alice.

MELANIE

Are you sure?

CLERK

Well, I ain't positive, if that's

what you mean.

MELANIE

I need her exact name, you see.

CLERK

That case, I tell you what you do.

You go straight through town 'til

you see a little hotel on your left

there. Not the motel, that's the

other end of town. This is the hotel.

Now you take a right turn there, you

got that?

MELANIE

Yes?

CLERK

Near the top of the hill, you'll see

the school and right behind it, the

church. You head for the school.

Now just past the school, you'll see

a little house with a red mail box.

That's where Annie Hayworth lives,

she's the school teacher. You ask

her about the little Brenner girl.

MELANIE

Thank you.

CLERK

Yep.

(pause)

Could save yourself a lot of trouble.

Her name's Alice for sure.

MELANIE

Can I have the boat in about twenty

minutes?

MELANIE

How much for the phone calls?

CLERK

(brushing this aside)

It's nothing.

DISSOLVE

ANNIE'S VOICE

(shouting)

Yes? Who is it?

MELANIE

Me!

ANNIE'S VOICE

Who's me?

MELANIE

Miss Hayworth?

ANNIE

Yes?

MELANIE

I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to

bother you, but...

ANNIE

Yes?

MELANIE

The man at the post office sent me.

He said you'd know the name of the

little Brenner girl.

ANNIE

Cathy?

MELANIE

The one who lives in the white house

across the bay?

ANNIE

That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

MELANIE

(smiling)

They seemed sure it was either Alice

or Lois.

ANNIE

Which is why the mail in this town

never gets delivered to the right

place.

(She takes out package

of cigarettes, offers

one to Melanie)

Did you want to see Cathy about

something?

MELANIE

Well... not exactly.

ANNIE

Are you a friend of Mitch's?

MELANIE

No, not really.

ANNIE

I've been wanting a cigarette for

the past twenty minutes, but I

couldn't convince myself to stop.

This 'tilling of the soil' can get a

little compulsive, you know.

MELANIE

It's a lovely garden.

ANNIE

Thank you. It gives me something to

do with my spare time.

(pause)

There's a lot of spare time in Bodega

Bay.

(another pause)

Did you plan on staying long?

MELANIE

No. Just a few hours.

ANNIE

You're leaving after you see Cathy?

MELANIE

Well... something like that.

(pause)

I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so

mysterious.

ANNIE

Actually, it's none of my business.

ANNIE

(putting out cigarette)

I'd better get on my way. Thank you

very much.

ANNIE

Not at all.

ANNIE

(still curious)

Did you drive up from San Francisco?

MELANIE

Yes.

ANNIE

It's a nice drive.

(pause)

Is that where you met Mitch?

MELANIE

(hesitating, then)

Yes.

ANNIE

I guess that's where everyone meets

him.

MELANIE

Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss

Hayworth.

ANNIE

Do I?

(she shakes her head,

smiles wistfully)

No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.

(pause)

Or maybe a closed one.

(she smiles again,

sees the lovebirds)

Pretty. What are they?

MELANIE

Lovebirds.

ANNIE

Mmm.

(pause)

Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

MELANIE

Thank you.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

MITCH

That was the damndest thing I ever

saw.

MELANIE

What made it...

MITCH

It deliberately came down at you --

you're bleeding...

MITCH

Come on, let's take care of that.

FISHERMAN

What happened, Mitch?

MITCH

(over his shoulder)

A gull hit her.

FISHERMAN

A what?

MITCH

Come on, we'd better go up to the

restaurant.

MITCH

Deke, have you got a first aid kit

back there?

DEKE

(instantly alarmed)

What happened?

MITCH

Young woman cut herself.

DEKE

Shall I call the doctor?

MITCH

(accepting the first

aid kit)

I don't think it's that serious.

You want to sit up here?

DEKE

You cut yourself outside, Miss?

MITCH

Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a

boat.

DEKE

I had a man trip and fall in the

parking lot once, sued me before I

could bat an eyelash.

MITCH

I don't think Miss Daniels is going

to sue anybody.

DEKE

(doubtfully)

Well, you're the lawyer.

(goes to other end of

bar)

MELANIE

What's that?

MITCH

Just some peroxide. I want to clean

out the cut.

MELANIE

So you're a lawyer.

MITCH

That's right. What are you doing in

Bodega Bay?

MELANIE

Do you practice here?

MITCH

No, San Francisco. What are you...?

MELANIE

What kind of law?

MITCH

Criminal.

MELANIE

Is that why you'd like to see everyone

behind bars?

MITCH

Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

MELANIE

Only violators and practical jokers.

MELANIE

That's right.

MELANIE

Ouch!

MITCH

I'm sorry.

(pause)

What are you doing up here?

MELANIE

Didn't you see the lovebirds?

MITCH

You came all the way up here to bring

me those birds?

MELANIE

To bring your sister those birds.

You said it was her birthday.

Besides, I was coming up anyway.

MITCH

What for?

MELANIE

To see a friend of mine.

(she winces)

Will you please be careful?

MITCH

I'm sorry.

(pause)

Who's your friend?

MELANIE

Why...

(pause, stymied)

MITCH

Yes?

MELANIE

(blurting the only

name she knows)

Annie. Annie Hayworth.

MITCH

Well, well, small world. Annie

Hayworth.

MELANIE

(realizing this was a

mistake)

Yes.

MITCH

How do you know Annie?

MELANIE

(the lie getting deeper)

We... we went to school together.

College.

MITCH

Did you! Imagine that! How long will

you be staying?

MELANIE

Just a few... just a day or two...

the weekend.

MITCH

I think we'll have to shave the hair.

Deke, have you got a razor?

MELANIE

(pulling away)

Oh, no you don't!

MITCH

It's still bleeding a little. Here,

let me put this on.

MITCH

Bend your head down. This little

Band-Aid won't show.

MITCH

So you came up to see Annie, huh?

MELANIE

Yes.

MITCH

I don't believe you.

(grins)

I think you came up to see me.

MELANIE

Why would I want to see you, of all

people?

MITCH

(shrugging)

I don't know. But it seems to me you

must have gone to a lot of trouble

to find out who I was, and where I

lived and...

MELANIE

It was no trouble at all. I simply

called my father's paper. Besides, I

was coming up here anyway, I already

told you...

MITCH

(grinning)

You like me, huh?

MELANIE

I loathe you. You have no manners.

And you're arrogant and conceited

and... I wrote you a letter about

it, in fact, but I tore it up.

MITCH

What did it say?

MELANIE

None of your business.

(pause)

Am I still bleeding?

MITCH

Can't see a thing.

MELANIE

I can't say I like your seagulls

much, either. I come all the way up

here to...

MITCH

But you were coming up anyway,

remember?

MELANIE

I was! And all I get for my pains is

a... a... a hole in the head!

MITCH

(grinning)

Right next to the one you already

had.

MELANIE

(angrily)

Look, Mr. Brenner...

LYDIA (O.S.)

Mitch?

LYDIA

(puzzled)

I thought I saw your car. What are

you doing in town?

MITCH

(rising to greet her)

I had to acknowledge a delivery.

(grins)

Mother, I'd like you to meet...

LYDIA

A what?

MITCH

(continuing)

Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

LYDIA

How do you do, Miss Daniels?

(to Mitch)

Acknowledge a what?

MITCH

A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels

brought some birds from San Francisco.

LYDIA

Oh. I see.

MITCH

For Cathy. For her birthday. By the

way, where is she?

LYDIA

Across at Brinkmeyer's.

MITCH

Miss Daniels is staying for the

weekend. In fact, I've already invited

her to dinner tonight.

MITCH

After all, you did go to the trouble

of bringing up those birds.

MELANIE (O.S.)

I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

LYDIA

You did say birds?

MITCH

Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

LYDIA

(understanding

completely now)

Lovebirds, I see.

MITCH

...get away without thanking you in

some small way. After all, you haven't

even met Cathy and you are staying

for the weekend...

MELANIE

Yes, but...

MITCH

You are, aren't you?

MELANIE

Certainly, but...

MITCH

Then it's settled. What time is

dinner, Mother?

LYDIA

Seven o'clock, same as usual.

MITCH

I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.

Where are you staying?

MELANIE

With... with Annie, of course.

MITCH

Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter

to seven, will that be all right?

MELANIE

Annie... Annie may have made other

plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I

can find my own way.

MITCH

You're sure now? You won't hire a

boat or anything?

MELANIE

I'm sure.

MITCH

Seven o'clock then.

MELANIE

Maybe.

MITCH

We'll be waiting. How's your head

now?

MELANIE

(with an overwarm

smile)

It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull

hit me, that's all.

DISSOLVE

ANNIE

(surprised)

Oh, hi!

(pause)

Did you find her all right?

MELANIE

Yes, I did.

MELANIE

I was wondering...

ANNIE

Yes?

MELANIE

That sign.

(pause)

Do you think I could have the room

for a single night?

ANNIE

Well, I'd really hope to rent it

for...

MELANIE

I would appreciate it. I've tried

everywhere in town, and they're all

full.

ANNIE

(after a pause)

Sure. You can have it.

(smiles)

Where's your bag? In the car?

ANNIE

It's utilitarian, I'll say that for

it.

MELANIE

(smiling)

I just picked up some things for the

night at the general store. You see,

I hadn't planned on spending much

time here.

ANNIE

Yes, I know. Did something unexpected

crop up?

MELANIE

Yes.

(pause)

May I use your phone? I'd like to

call home.

ANNIE

Why don't you come in then?  I was

just about to mix a martini.

ANNIE

(shaking her head)

Don't they ever stop migrating?

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

(calling)

Hi!

CATHY

(excitedly)

Hi!

(she breaks into a

trot toward Melanie)

CATHY

Miss Daniels?

MELANIE

Yes?

CATHY

They're beautiful! They're just what

I wanted! Is there a man and a woman?

I can't tell which is which.

MELANIE

Well, I suppose...

MITCH

(coming up)

Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm

glad you came. Are you hungry?

MELANIE

Famished.

MITCH

Dinner's just about ready.

(explaining)

We were out back looking at the

chickens. Something seems to be wrong

with them.

LYDIA

(going toward house)

There's nothing wrong with those

chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call

Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

MITCH

(as they follow into

house)

I don't know what good that'll do.

(aside to Melanie)

Chickens won't eat.

LYDIA

He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

MITCH

Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer

beware.

LYDIA

Whose side are you on?

MITCH

I'm simply quoting the law.

LYDIA

Never mind the law. Cathy, you can

start serving the soup.

LYDIA

This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...

(into phone)

Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.

I didn't interrupt your dinner, did

I?

(pause)

Fred, that feed you sold me is no

good.

(pause)

The chicken feed. The three bags I

brought.

LYDIA

Well, it's just no good. The chickens

won't eat it.

(pause)

They're always hungry, Fred. I opened

one of the sacks when I got home,

and I poured it out for them, and

they wouldn't touch it. Now you know

chickens as well as I do, and when

they won't eat, there's just something

wrong with what they're being fed,

that's all.

(pause)

No, they're not fussy chickens.

(pause)

Who? What's he got to do with it?

(pause)

Fred, I don't care how much feed you

sold him. My chickens...

(pause)

He did? Dan Fawcett?

(pause)

This afternoon?

(pause)

Well, that only proves what I'm

saying. The feed you sold us is...

(pause)

Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh-

huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see

him. You don't think there's something

going around, do you?

(pause)

No, never.

(pause)

No, Fred, they don't seem sick at

all. They just won't eat.

(pause)

Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get

over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll...

mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred,

thanks.

(she hangs up, puzzled)

LYDIA

(as she sits)

He got a call from Dan Fawcett a

little while ago. His chickens won't

eat, either.

CATHY

It's what you said, Mom. Mr.

Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

LYDIA

(slowly)

No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a

different brand.

(extremely worried)

You don't think they're getting sick,

do you, Mitch?

DISSOLVE

CATHY

I still don't understand how you

knew I wanted lovebirds.

MELANIE

Your brother told me.

LYDIA

(as she goes into

kitchen)

Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco,

is that right?

MELANIE

No, not exactly.

CATHY

Mitch knows lots of people in San

Francisco. Of course, they're mostly

hoods.

LYDIA

(from the kitchen)

Cathy!

CATHY

Well, Mom, he's the first to admit

it.

(to Melanie)

He spends half his day in the

detention cells at the Hall of

Justice.

LYDIA

(coming from kitchen)

In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is

entitled to a fair trial. Your

brother's practice...

CATHY

Mom, please, I know all the democracy

jazz. They're still hoods.

(to Melanie)

He's got a client now who shot his

wife in the head six times. Six times,

can you imagine it?

(she starts for living

room)

I mean, even twice would be overdoing

it, don't you think?

MELANIE

(to Mitch as he carries

load of dishes out)

Why did he shoot her?

MITCH

He was watching a ball game on

television.

MELANIE

What?

MITCH

His wife changed the channel.

CATHY

Is smoking fun?

MELANIE

Oh, I suppose so.

CATHY

Could I have a puff?

MELANIE

I don't think your mother would like

that.

CATHY (O.S.)

Just a little one.

CATHY

(delighted)

Why, it's just like air, isn't it?

(determined)

When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like

a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow,

you know.

MELANIE

I know.

CATHY

Are you coming to my party?

MELANIE

I don't think so.

(seeing the child's

face)

I have to get back to San Francisco.

CATHY

Don't you like us?

MELANIE

(touching her hair)

Darling, of course I do!

CATHY

Don't you like Bodega Bay?

MELANIE

I don't know yet.

CATHY

Mitch likes it very much. He comes

up every weekend, you know, even

though he has his own apartment in

the city. He says San Francisco is

just an ant hill at the foot of a

bridge.

MELANIE

(smiling)

I guess it does get a little hectic

at times.

CATHY

If you do decide to come, don't say

I told you about it. It's supposed

to be a surprise party.

CATHY

You see, they've got this whole

complicated thing figured out where

I'm going over to Michele's for the

afternoon, and Michele's mother is

going to say she has a headache and

would I mind very much if she took

me home. Then, when we get back here,

all of the kids'll jump out!

(pause)

Won't you come? Won't you please

come?

MELANIE

I don't think so, Cathy.

LYDIA

She's a charming girl, isn't she,

Mitch?

MITCH

Yes, very.

LYDIA

And certainly pretty.

MITCH

Yes.

LYDIA

How long have you known her?

MITCH

I told you. We met yesterday.

LYDIA

In a bird shop.

MITCH

Yes.

LYDIA

She was selling birds.

MITCH

No. I only led her into believing I

believed she was... Mother, it's

really very complicated.

LYDIA

But she did buy the lovebirds and

then brought them all the way...

MITCH

Mother, where did you go to law

school?

LYDIA

(laughing)

Forgive me. I suppose I'm just

naturally curious about a girl like

that.

(pause)

She's very rich, isn't she?

MITCH

I suppose so. Her father owns a big

newspaper in San Francisco.

LYDIA

You'd think he could manage to keep

her name out of print. She's always

mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

MITCH

I know, Mother.

LYDIA

She is the one who jumped into that

fountain in Rome last summer, isn't

she?

MITCH

Yes, Mother.

LYDIA

Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.

(pause)

I know it was supposed to be very

warm there, Mitch, but... well...

actually... well, the newspaper said

she was naked.

MITCH

I know, Mother.

LYDIA

It's none of my business, of course,

but when you bring a girl like that

to...

MITCH

Mother?

LYDIA

(looking up)

Yes?

MITCH

I think I can handle Melanie Daniels

by myself.

LYDIA

Well...

(she sighs)

So long as you know what you want,

Mitch.

MITCH

I know exactly what I want, Mother.

DISSOLVE

MITCH

You'll be able to find your way back,

won't you?

MELANIE

Oh, yes.

MELANIE

Will I be seeing you again?

MELANIE

San Francisco's a long way from here.

MITCH

I'm in San Francisco five days a

week. With a lot of time on my hands.

I'd like to see you.

(he grins)

Maybe we could go swimming or

something. Mother tells me you like

to swim.

MELANIE

How does Mother know what I like to

do?

MITCH

I guess she and I read the same gossip

columns.

MELANIE

Oh. That. Rome.

MITCH

Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get

along very...

MELANIE

In case you're interested, I was

pushed into that fountain.

MELANIE

Without any clothes on?

MELANIE

With all my clothes on!  The newspaper

that ran the story happens to be a

rival of my father's paper.  Anything

they said...

MITCH

You were just a poor, innocent victim

of circumstance, huh?

MELANIE

I'm neither poor nor innocent, but

the truth of that particular...

MITCH

The truth is you were running around

with a pretty wild crowd...

MELANIE

Yes, but...

MITCH

...who didn't much care for propriety

or convention or...

MELANIE

Yes.

MITCH

...the opinions of others, and you

went right along with them, isn't

that the truth?

MELANIE

Yes, that's the truth. But I was

pushed into that fountain, and that's

the truth, too.

MITCH

Sure. Do you really know Annie

Hayworth?

MELANIE

No.

(pause)

At least, I didn't until I came up

here.

MITCH

So you didn't go to school together.

MELANIE

No.

MITCH

And you didn't come up here to see

her.

MELANIE

No.

MITCH

You were lying.

MELANIE

Yes, I was lying.

MITCH

Did you really write a letter to me?

Or was that a lie, too?

MELANIE

I wrote the letter.

MITCH

What did it say?

MELANIE

It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think

you need those lovebirds, after all.

They may help your personality."

That's what it said.

MITCH

But you tore it up.

MELANIE

Yes.

MITCH

Why?

MELANIE

Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

MITCH

Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

MELANIE

I told you what happened in Rome!

MITCH

Do you expect me to believe...?

MELANIE

I don't give a damn what you believe!

MITCH

I'd still like to see you.

MELANIE

Why?

MITCH

I think it could be fun.

MELANIE

That might have been good enough in

Rome last summer. But it's not good

enough now.

MITCH

It is for me.

MELANIE

But not for me.

MITCH

What do you want ?

MELANIE

(angrily sarcastic)

I thought you knew! I want to go

through life laughing and beautiful

and jumping into fountains naked!

Good night!

DISSOLVE

ANNIE

Miss Daniels? Is that you?

MELANIE (O.S.)

Yes.

ANNIE

Hi.

(seeing her face)

Is something wrong? Is that cut

beginning to bother you?

MELANIE

(touching her head)

No, it's not the cut that's bothering

me.

ANNIE

(concerned)

Would you like some brandy?

MELANIE

If you have some, I'd...

ANNIE

I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.

Do you want a sweater or something?

A quilt?

MELANIE

No, thank you.

(pause)

Won't you call me Melanie?

ANNIE

All right.

(she smiles)

MELANIE

Thank you.

ANNIE

(sitting opposite her)

It gets a little chilly here at night

sometimes. Especially if you're over

near the bay.

ANNIE

Well, how'd your evening go?

ANNIE

Did you meet Lydia?

ANNIE

Or would you rather I changed the

subject?

MELANIE

(with a tired smile)

I think so.

ANNIE

(nodding)

How do you like our little hamlet?

MELANIE

I despise it.

ANNIE

(laughing)

Well, I don't suppose it offers much

to the casual visitor. Unless you're

thrilled by a collection of shacks

on a hillside. It takes a while to

get used to.

MELANIE

Where are you from originally, Annie?

ANNIE

San Francisco.

MELANIE

How'd you happen to come here?

ANNIE

Oh, someone invited me up for the

weekend a long time ago.

ANNIE

Look, I see no reason for being coy

about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

ANNIE

I guess you knew that, anyway.

MELANIE

I suspected as much.

ANNIE

You needn't worry. It's over and

done with. A long time ago.

MELANIE

Annie -- there's nothing between

Mitch and me.

ANNIE

Isn't there?

(she shrugs)

Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's

never anything between Mitch and any

girl.

MELANIE

What do you mean?

ANNIE

I think I'll have some of that, too.

(she pours brandy,

drinks, sighs)

I was seeing quite a lot of him in

San Francisco, you know.

(she smiles weakly)

And then, one weekend, he asked me

up to meet Lydia.

MELANIE

When was this?

ANNIE

Four years ago. Of course, that was

shortly after his father died.  Things

may be different now.

MELANIE

Different?

ANNIE

With Lydia.

(pause)

Did she seem a trifle distant?

MELANIE

(smiling)

A trifle.

ANNIE

Then maybe it isn't different at

all. You know, her attitude nearly

drove me crazy. I simply couldn't

understand it.

ANNIE

When I got back to San Francisco I

spent days trying to figure out just

what I'd done to displease her.

MELANIE

And what had you done?

ANNIE

Nothing! I simply existed. So what

was the answer? A jealous woman,

right? A clinging possessive mother.

(she shakes her head)

Wrong. With all due respect to

Oedipus, I don't think that was the

case at all.

MELANIE

Then what was it?

ANNIE

Lydia liked me, you see. That was

the strange part of it. In fact, now

that I'm no longer a threat, we're

very good friends.

MELANIE

Then why did she object to you?

ANNIE

Because she was afraid.

MELANIE

Afraid you'd take Mitch?

ANNIE

Afraid I'd give Mitch.

MELANIE

I don't understand.

ANNIE

Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch

the only thing Lydia can give him --

love.

MELANIE

Annie, that adds up to a jealous,

possessive woman.

ANNIE

No, I don't think so. She's not afraid

of losing her son, you see.  She's

only afraid of being abandoned.

MELANIE

Someone ought to tell her she'd be

gaining a daughter.

ANNIE

She already has a daughter.

MELANIE

What about Mitch? Didn't he have

anything to say about this?

ANNIE

(apologetically)

I can understand his position. He

went through a lot with Lydia after

his father died. He didn't want to

risk going through it all over again.

MELANIE

I see.

ANNIE

So it ended. Not immediately, of

course. I went back to San Francisco,

and I still saw Mitch every now and

then... but we both knew it was

finished.

MELANIE

Then what are you doing here in Bodega

Bay?

ANNIE

You get straight to the point, don't

you?

MELANIE

I'm sorry. Forgive me.

ANNIE

No, that's all right, I don't mind.

I came up here for two reasons. To

begin with, I was bored with my job

in San Francisco. I was teaching at

a private school there... well, you

know, you probably went to one

yourself.

MELANIE

I did.

ANNIE

Then you know. Little girls in brown

beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life.

I'll go into that classroom on Monday

morning, and I'll look out at twenty-

five upturned little faces, and each

of them will be saying, 'Yes, please

give me what you have.'

(pause)

And I'll give them what I have. I

haven't got very much, but I'll give

them every ounce of it. To me, that's

very important. It makes me want to

stay alive for a long long time.

(she sighs)

That's the first reason.

MELANIE

And the second?

ANNIE

(simply)

I wanted to be near Mitch.

(pause)

It was over, and I knew it, but I

wanted to be near him, anyway.

(she smiles)

You see, I still like him a hell of

a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't

want to lose his friendship... ever.

ANNIE

Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't

asleep. What is it?

(pause)

Yes, just a little while ago. Sure,

hold on.

(she turns to Melanie)

It's Mitch. For you.

ANNIE

He's waiting.

MELANIE

(at phone; coolly)

Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine,

thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I

simply followed the road. It's a

very bright night.

(pause)

What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to

apologize. I can understand...

(pause; she listens)

Well...

(she listens again)

That's very kind of you. No, I'm not

angry.

(she listens)

I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get

back to San Francisco.

(pause)

No, I wouldn't want to disappoint

Cathy, but...

(pause)

I see.

(she is warming)

I see. Well, if you really...

(pause)

All right. Yes, I'll be there.

(pause)

Good night, Mitch.

MELANIE

He wants me to go to Cathy's party

tomorrow afternoon.

(pause)

I said I would.

ANNIE

I'll be going, too, to help out. It

should be fun, Melanie.

MELANIE

It seems so pointless.

(she sighs)

I think I'll go to sleep. This has

been a busy day.

(picking up her paper

bag)

My luggage.

ANNIE

Pretty. Did you get that at

Brinkmeyer's?

MELANIE

Do you think I should go?

ANNIE

That's up to you.

MELANIE

It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

ANNIE

Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

MELANIE

(firmly)

Yes.

ANNIE

Then go.

MELANIE

Thank you, Annie.

ANNIE

(rising)

Who can that be at this hour?

(she walks to door)

Who is it?

(no answer)

Is someone there?

ANNIE

(to the emptiness

outside)

Is anyone there?

MELANIE

(pointing to the ground)

Look.

ANNIE

(sympathetically)

Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably

lost his way in the dark.

MELANIE

But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's

a full moon.

FADE OUT

MELANIE

I really shouldn't have any more.

I'm a little tipsy already.

MITCH

I'm trying to get you to stay for

dinner. We're going to have a lot of

roast left over.

MELANIE

I couldn't possibly. I have to get

back.

MITCH

(with a shrug)

Cheers.

MELANIE

Cheers.

MELANIE

What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

MITCH

Why do you have to rush off? What's

so important in San Francisco?

MELANIE

Well... I have to get to work tomorrow

morning, for one thing.

MITCH

(surprised)

You have a job?

MELANIE

(sipping at the martini)

I have several jobs.

MITCH

What do you do?

MELANIE

I do different things on different

days.

MITCH

Like what?

MELANIE

(hesitating)

On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work

for the Travelers' Aid. At the

airport.

MITCH

Helping travelers.

MELANIE

Yes.

MELANIE

And on Tuesdays, I take a course in

General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's

not a job, of course. I just take it

because...

MITCH

What about Thursdays and Fridays?

MELANIE

On Thursdays I have my meeting and

lunch.

(pause)

I'm chairman of a group that's sending

a little Korean boy through school.

We plan how to raise funds and...

things like that.

(she shrugs)

MITCH

And Fridays? What do you do then?

MELANIE

Nothing.

(she smiles)

I go to bird shops on Fridays.

MITCH

I'm glad you do.

MELANIE

Do you know what I was doing in that

shop?

MITCH

What?

MELANIE

I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa.

She's seventy years old, and veddy

prim and strait-laced.

(she does an imitation)

She's coming back from Europe at the

end of the month, and I'm going to

give her a myna bird that'll talk to

her.

MITCH

What'll it say?

MELANIE

(facetiously)

You'll think me very bold, sir.

MITCH

No, tell me.

MELANIE

That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a

bird to shock my aunt. That's just

silly and childish.

(slight pause)

Maybe I ought to go join the other

children.

ANNIE

All right then, here we go.

(she spins her)

Once!

(she spins her again)

Twice!

(she spins her again)

Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

LITTLE BOY (O.S.)

Look! Look!

CATHY

No touching allowed!

MITCH

Are you all right?

MELANIE

Yes.

ANNIE

(coming over)

That's the darnest thing thing I've

ever seen in my life.

LYDIA

Are they gone?

MITCH

They're gone, Mother.

LYDIA

Well... well, is everyone all right?

MITCH

(with a small boy)

I think he got a little scratch,

Mother.

GIRL #3

Did you see them? They were hawks!

GIRL #4

They were bigger than hawks!

ANNIE

Children, they were only seagulls.

CATHY

They must have been after the food,

Mother.

MITCH

They didn't touch anything.

ANNIE

(trying to restore

order)

Well, they're gone now, so... so

let's...

(pause)

Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't

you, Cathy?

GIRL #2

Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

MITCH

You look a little shaken.

MELANIE

I... I am.

(pause)

Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual,

is it? The gull yesterday when I was

in the boat, and the one last night

at Annie's, and now...

MITCH

Last night? What do you mean?

MELANIE

A gull smashed into Annie's front

door.

(pause)

Mitch... what's happening?

MITCH

(concerned)

I don't know, Melanie.

(pause)

Look, do you have to go back to

Annie's?

MELANIE

No, I have my things in the car.

MITCH

(gently)

Then stay and have something to eat

before you start back. I'd feel a

lot better.

DISSOLVE

MITCH

Do you want some mustard with this?

MELANIE (O.S.)

No, thank you.

CATHY

(coming from kitchen)

Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

MITCH

She said something about having to

get home to take a call from her

mother back East.

CATHY

Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

MITCH

Take it into the living room, would

you, hon?

CATHY

(seeing the birds)

What's the matter with them?

LYDIA

What's the matter with all the birds?

LYDIA

Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm

sure Miss Daniels wants to get on

her way.

CATHY

I think you ought to stay the night,

Melanie.

CATHY

We've got an extra room upstairs and

everything.

MITCH

(coming in with two

plates)

That road can be a bad one at night,

Melanie.

(he picks up coffee

cup, hands it to

Melanie)

MELANIE

If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll

come onto the freeway much earlier.

LYDIA

(picking up a cup)

Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted,

isn't it, Mitch?

MITCH

Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that

traffic going back to San Francisco.

CATHY

Did you put the cover on that cage,

Mom?

LYDIA

Yes, I did.

CATHY

Just listen to them!

MITCH

(to Melanie)

Some cream?

MELANIE

I'll get it.

MELANIE

Mitch...

MELANIE

(shouting it)

Mitch!

MITCH

(to the others)

Get outside! Run!

(he turns toward Lydia)

MITCH (O.S.)

Mother!

MITCH

(shouting)

Cathy, get some matches!

MELANIE

Mitch! The curtains!

CATHY

It's working! The fire's working!

DISSOLVE

MALONE

That's a chimney swift, all right.

MITCH

We know what it is, Al.

MALONE

Well, these birds live in chimneys,

you know.

MITCH

Not by the thousands.

MALONE

No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.

(pause)

Did you have a light burning or

something.

MITCH

Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

MALONE

'Cause sometimes birds are attracted

by light, you know.

(pause)

Sure is a peculiar thing.

MITCH

What are we going to do about it,

Al?

MALONE

I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do

about what?

MITCH

Well...

(he feels a little

foolish)

Well... these birds attacked us.

MALONE

What's more likely, they got in the

room and was just panicked, that's

all.

MITCH

(still a little

hesitant)

All right, I'll grant you a bird'll

panic in an enclosed room. But, they

didn't just get in. They came in!

Right down that chimney.

MALONE

(trying to make sense

of this)

My wife found a bird in the back

seat of her car once.

MALONE

(shrugs)

Didn't know how he got in there.

Had a broken leg, turned out. Just

fluttering all around there.

(he shrugs again)

MITCH

These birds were...

MALONE

What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is

these things happen sometimes, you

know? Ain't much we can do about it.

(he shrugs)

LYDIA

Tell him about the party.

MITCH

That's right. We had a party here

this afternoon for Cathy. Her

birthday.

MALONE

Oh, yeah, yeah.

(he grins)

How old is she now?

MITCH

Eleven. In the middle of the party,

some gulls came down at the children.

And Miss Daniels was attacked by a

gull just yesterday after...

MALONE

Yeah.

(thinking)

Were the kids bothering them or

something? 'Cause sometimes they'll

do that, you know. If you make any

kind of disturbance near them, they'll

just come after you. I seen that

plenty of times myself.

LYDIA

The children were playing a game,

Al. Those gulls attacked without...

MALONE

Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty

strong word, don't you think? I mean,

birds just don't go around attacking

people without no reason, you know

what I mean? The kids just probably

scared them, that's all.

LYDIA

These birds attacked!

MALONE

(nodding)

Well, what would you like me to do,

Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on

any suspicious birds in the area?

(he smiles)

Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't

it?

MITCH

Does this room look silly?

MALONE

No, you got quite a mess here, I'll

admit that.

(pause)

Maybe you oughta put some screening

on top of your chimney

(pause)

Seems a little pointless, though.

Freak accident like this wouldn't

happen again in a million years.

(pause)

You want some help cleaning up?

MITCH

I can handle it myself.

MELANIE

I'll take Cathy up to bed.

MITCH

Are you staying?

MELANIE

I think I should, don't you?

MELANIE

I'll get my things from the car. Do

you want to walk with me, Cathy?

MALONE

Well, if there's anything else I can

do, Mitch...

MITCH

Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

MALONE

Goodnight, Lydia.

MALONE

Sure is peculiar, I got to say that

for it.

FADE OUT

LYDIA'S VOICE

Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to

drop Cathy off now.

MITCH'S VOICE

Okay.

LYDIA'S VOICE

I'll probably drive over to the

Fawcett farm. Do you need anything

in town?

MITCH'S VOICE

No.

MELANIE

Mitch?

MELANIE

Mitch?

MELANIE

(imitating them)

Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

MITCH

I wanted to change my shirt.

MITCH

It smelled of the fire.

MELANIE

(nodding)

It's hard to believe anything at all

happened yesterday, isn't it? It's

so beautiful and still now.

(pause; then sagely)

I think I've got it all figured out,

by the way.

MITCH

Really? Tell me about it.

MELANIE

(secretively)

It's an uprising.

MITCH

Of birds?

MELANIE

Certainly, of birds.

MELANIE

It all started several months ago

with a peasant sparrow up in the

hills, a malcontent. He went around

telling all the other sparrows that

human beings weren't fit to rule

this planet, preaching wherever anyone

would listen...

MITCH

Growing a beard...

MELANIE

(delighted)

Yes, of course, he had to have a

beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!'

he kept saying, over and over...

MITCH

So they united.

MELANIE

Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows

out for kicks...

MITCH

Well, they'll go along with anything.

MELANIE

Sure. But eventually, even the more

serious-minded birds began to listen.

"Why should humans rule?" they asked

themselves.

MITCH

Hear!

MELANIE

Why should we submit ourselves to

their domination?

MITCH

Hear, hear!

MELANIE

And all the while, that sparrow was

getting in his little messages.

Birds of the world, unite!

MITCH

Take wing!

MELANIE

You have nothing to lose but your

feathers.

MITCH

(attempting to be

serious)

What it was, probably...

MELANIE

Mmm?

MITCH

They're probably hungry, that's all.

This was a bad summer. They eat

berries and... and nuts, you know,

and the hills are all burned out, so

they're probably searching for food

wherever they can get it.

MELANIE

With my little sparrow leading team.

MITCH

It's so damn quiet out there.

MELANIE

It was like that yesterday.

MITCH

What do you mean?

MELANIE

After the gulls attacked.

MITCH

I hadn't thought of that.

(pause)

And then the swifts came.

MELANIE

It makes you feel as if they're...

they're waiting or... resting...

or....

MITCH

(trying to make it

light again)

No, they're having a meeting, Melanie.

Your sparrow is standing on a soap

box and...

MITCH

...waving his little wings...

MELANIE

They were angry, Mitch. They came

out of the chimney in fury.

(pause)

I had the feeling they wanted each

and every one of us dead.

MITCH

Melanie, Melanie...

MELANIE

I'm frightened, Mitch.

MITCH

No, no...

MELANIE

I'm frightened and confused and I...

I think I want to go back to San

Francisco where there are buildings

and... and concrete and...

MITCH

Melanie...

MELANIE

...everything I know.

MELANIE

Oh damn it, why did you have to walk

into that shop?

DISSOLVE

LYDIA

Dan?

LYDIA

Dan?

LYDIA

(shouting)

Hi, there!

LYDIA

(shouting)

Is Mr. Fawcett home?

FARMHAND

(shouting back)

I think so, ma'm. His missus is in

Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here.

LYDIA

Have you seen him this morning?

LYDIA

(shouting it)

Thank you!

LYDIA

Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

LYDIA

Dan?

LYDIA

Dan? Are you home?

LYDIA

Dan?

LYDIA

Dan?

LYDIA

Dan? Are you in there?

CUTS TO:

CUT TO:

MITCH

(alarmed)

What is it?

DISSOLVE

MITCH

That was Al on the phone. He wants

me to meet him out at the Fawcett

place. Says some detectives from

Santa Rosa'll be there in a little

while.

(pause)

Will you be all right here?

MELANIE

Yes. I was just taking her in some

tea.

MELANIE

Be careful. Please.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Mitch?

MELANIE

No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought

you might like some tea.

LYDIA

Oh, thank you.

LYDIA

Where's Mitch?

MELANIE

Al Malone wanted him out at the

Fawcett farm.

LYDIA

Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

MELANIE

He was calling from the farm, Mrs.

Brenner.

LYDIA

Then he saw.

MELANIE

He must have. He sent for the Santa

Rosa police.

LYDIA

What good will they do?

LYDIA

Do you think Cathy's all right?

MELANIE

What?

LYDIA

Cathy. At the school.

MELANIE

Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

LYDIA

Do I sound foolish to you?

MELANIE

No.

LYDIA

I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.

(she shudders)

They have such big windows at the

school.

(pause)

All the windows were broken. In Dan's

bedroom. All the windows.

MELANIE

Try not to think of that, Mrs.

Brenner.

LYDIA

I wish I were a stronger person.

There is a long awkward silence. She

sips at her tea reflectively.

LYDIA

I lost my husband four years ago,

you know.

(pause)

It's odd how you depend on someone

for strength, and then suddenly all

the strength is gone, and you're

alone.

(pause)

I'd love to relax some time. I'd

love to be able to sleep.

(pause; the worried

look again)

Do you think Cathy's all right?

MELANIE

Annie's there. She'll be all right.

LYDIA

I'm not this way, you know. Not

usually. I don't fuss and fret over

my children.

(pause)

When Frank died...

(pause)

You see, he knew the children, he

really knew them. He had the knack

of being able to enter into their

world, of becoming a part of them.

That's a rare talent.

MELANIE

Yes.

LYDIA

I wish I could be that way.

LYDIA

(honestly and simply)

I miss him.

(pause)

You know, sometimes I wake up in the

morning, and I think 'I have to make

Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get

up and there's a... a very good reason

for getting out of bed until... until,

of course, I remember.

(pause)

I miss talking to him.

(pause)

Cathy's a child, you know, and

Mitch...

(she shrugs a little

sadly)

...Mitch has his own life.

(pause)

I'm glad he stayed here today. I

feel safer with him here.

(she sighs deeply)

MELANIE

Would you like to rest now, Mrs.

Brenner.

LYDIA

No.  No... don't go yet.

(pause)

I feel as if I... I don't understand

you. And I want so much to understand.

MELANIE

Why, Mrs. Brenner?

LYDIA

Because my son is...

(pause)

My son seems to be fond of you.

(pause)

And I...

(pause)

I'm not quite sure how I feel about

it. I really don't know if I... like

you or not.

MELANIE

Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?

You liking me?

LYDIA

Yes, I think so. My son is important

to me. I want to like any girl he

chooses.

MELANIE

And if you don't?

LYDIA

(with a faint smile)

Then I don't suppose it'll matter

much to anyone but me.

MELANIE

I think it might also matter to Mitch.

LYDIA

(shaking her head)

Mitch has always done exactly what

he wanted to do.

(pause)

I'm not complaining. That's the mark

of a man.  But...

(pause)

You see, I... I wouldn't want to

be... be left alone. I don't think I

could bear being left alone.  I...

forgive me. This business with the

birds has me upset.  I... I don't

know what I'd do if Mitch weren't

here.

MELANIE

(going to the bed;

adjusting the pillow)

Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.

Brenner.

LYDIA

(sighing)

I wish I were stronger.

(she pauses and looks

toward the window.)

Do you think she's all right? Do you

think she's safe at the school?

MELANIE

Would you like me to go for her?

LYDIA

I couldn't ask you to.

MELANIE

I don't mind, really.

LYDIA

Would you? I'd feel so much better.

MELANIE

I'll just clear up here, and then

dress.

LYDIA

Melanie?

LYDIA

(gently)

Thank you for the tea.

CHILDREN (O.S.)

I married my wife in the month of

ANNIE (O.S.)

All right, children. Now please put

your books in your desks, and bring

the songsheets to the front of the

room. No one's going out to play

until I have all the songsheets.

ANNIE

We're not going outside until we

quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?

ANNIE

All right now.

ANNIE

wh...?

MELANIE

Outside.

MELANIE

We've got to get the children out of

here. These big windows... there's

no way to board them up.

ANNIE

Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

ANNIE

Miss Daniels wants to see how we

conduct ourselves during a fire drill.

I'd like you to...

CHILDREN

(grumbling in Unison)

A fire drill? This is our play period,

Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

ANNIE

I'd like you to show her how quiet

and obedient you can be.

ANNIE

We're going to go out of the school

now. Those of you who live nearby

can go directly home. I want the

rest of you to go down the hill, all

the way to the hotel. Do you

understand?

CHILDREN

All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss

Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do

we...?

ANNIE

(shushing them)

I want you to go as quietly as you

can, not a sound, until I tell you

to run. And then I want you to run

as fast as you can. Does everyone

understand?

(pause - silence)

All right. John, would you lead the

class, please?

MELANIE

(whispering)

Hurry!

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

Daddy, there were hundreds of them.

No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying

to tell you this as calmly as I know

how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.

(she takes a deep

breath)

Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes

ago.

MELANIE

At the school. No, I don't. Just a

minute.

(to Deke)

What's the name of the school?

DEKE

Just the Bodega Bay School.

(to Mrs. Bundy)

Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

MRS. BUNDY

I need some change, Mr. Carter.

MELANIE

The Bodega Bay School.

(to Deke)

Could you turn that down, please?

MELANIE

I don't know how many children.

Thirty or forty. Yes.

MELANIE

No, the birds didn't attack until

the children were outside the school.

Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy.

Is there a difference between crows

and blackbirds?

MRS. BUNDY

(turning from machine)

There is very definitely a difference,

Miss.

MELANIE

They're different, Daddy.

(to Mrs. Bundy)

Thank you.

(into phone)

I think these were crows. Yes,

hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked

the children, attacked them.

(exasperated)

Daddy, a little girl was sent to the

hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all

right, but you act as if I'm... all

right, all right.

(pause)

No, I can't come home now. I just

can't, Daddy. How is it there? I

mean... are there birds? In the sky?

But no trouble. Well, I hope...

(pause)

I don't know when. I simply can't

leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.

All right, Daddy, good-by.

MRS. BUNDY

They're both perching birds, of

course, but of quite different

species. The crow is brachyrhynchos.

The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

MELANIE

Thank you.

(to Deke)

Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

DEKE

In the book right here, Miss.

DEKE

(to Mrs. Bundy)

I don't see what difference it makes,

Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If

they attacked the school, that's

pretty serious.

MRS. BUNDY

(with a superior smile)

I hardly think either species would

have the intelligence to launch a

massed attack. Their brain pans aren't

large enough for such...

MELANIE

(dialing)

I just came from the school, madam.

I don't know about their brain pans

but...

MRS. BUNDY

Birds are not aggressive creatures,

Miss. They bring beauty to the world.

It is mankind, rather, who...

HELEN

(going to door leading

to kitchen)

Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.

Baked potato on all of them.

MELANIE

(into phone)

Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner,

please?

(pause)

Yes, I'll wait.

MRS. BUNDY

(continuing to Deke)

...insist on making it difficult for

life to survive on this planet. If

it weren't for birds...

DEKE

Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to

understand. This young lady says

there was an attack on the school.

MRS. BUNDY

Impossible.

MELANIE

(in background)

Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.

Something terrible has happened.

DRUNK

(suddenly)

It's the end of the world!

HELEN

What's this about the school?

DEKE

Bunch of crows attacked the school,

Helen.

DRUNK

It's the end of the world.

(suddenly quoting)

"Thus saith the Lord God to the

mountains, and to the hills, to the

rivers and to the valleys; Behold,

I, even I, will bring a sword upon

you, and I will destroy your high

places.

HELEN

The Lord's not destroying anything,

Jason.

DRUNK

"In all your dwelling places, the

cities shall be laid waste, and the

high places shall be laid waste!"

(he nods)

Ezekiel, Chapter six.

HELEN

(quoting)

"Woe unto them that rise up early in

the morning that they may follow

strong drink."

DRUNK

(nodding)

Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of

the world.

MELANIE

Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.

Good-by.

(she hangs up)

MRS. BUNDY

(laughing)

I hardly think a few birds are going

to bring about the end of the world.

MELANIE

(turning to her)

These weren't a few birds.

DEKE

I didn't even know there were many

crows in Bodega Bay this time of

year.

MRS. BUNDY

The crow is a permanent resident

throughout its range. In fact, during

our Christmas Count, we recorded...

SHOLES

(suddenly, from his

table)

How many gulls did you count, Mrs.

Bundy?

MRS. BUNDY

Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are

several varieties.

SHOLES

The ones that've been raising the

devil with my fishing boats.

MRS. BUNDY

Probably herring gulls. They arrive

in November, you know, and don't

migrate North again until March or...

MELANIE

(leaping upon this)

Have you had trouble with gulls?

SHOLES

One of my boats did last week.

DEKE

(making a connection)

This young lady got hit by a gull

only Saturday.

SAM'S VOICE

(from kitchen)

Pick up the chicken.

HELEN

Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was

crows.

(she picks up tray,

shrugs, goes to table)

Deke, I'm still waiting for those

Bloody Marys!

DEKE

Coming right up!

WOMAN

Could you ask them to lower their

voices, please? They're frightening

the children.

LITTLE GIRL

Timmy has a canary.

HELEN

That's nice. Are you Timmy?

LITTLE BOY

My cousin is Timmy.

SAM'S VOICE

(leaving table, coming

to bar)

A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized

one of my boats.  Practically tore

of the skipper's arm.

HELEN

(coming back)

You're scaring the kids. Keep it

low.

DEKE

You're scaring me, too. Are you trying

to say all these...

(he shakes his head)

That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

SHOLES

I'm only telling you what happened

to my boat.

MRS. BUNDY

The gulls were after your fish, Mr.

Sholes. Really, let's be logical

about this.

MELANIE

What were the crows after at the

school?

MRS. BUNDY

What do you think they were after,

Miss...?

MELANIE

Daniels. I think they were after the

children.

MRS. BUNDY

For what purpose?

MELANIE

To...

(she hesitates)

To kill them.

MRS. BUNDY

Why?

MELANIE

I don't know why.

MRS. BUNDY

I thought not. Birds have been on

this planet since archaeopteryx,

Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty

million years ago!

MRS. BUNDY

Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait

all that time to start a... a war

against humanity?

MELANIE

No one called it a war!

SALESMAN

Scotch, light on the water.

MRS. BUNDY

You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying

as much.

HELEN

Are you finished here, Sebastian?

SHOLES

Let me have some apple pie, Helen.

(to Mrs. Bundy)

Who said anything about war? All I

said was that some gulls...

HELEN

(yelling to kitchen)

One apple pie! You want more coffee?

SHOLES

No. ...came down on one of my boats.

They could have been after the fish,

just as you said.

SALESMAN

Your captain should have shot at

them.

SHOLES

What?

SALESMAN

Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most

birds are. If you ask me, we should

wipe them all out. World would be

better off without them.

MRS. BUNDY

(outraged)

Birds?

SALESMAN

Yeah, birds. All they do is make a

mess of everything. Who needs them?

MRS. BUNDY

We need them.

SALESMAN

Not if they're starting a war.

MRS. BUNDY

They are incapable of organized

warfare!

MELANIE

Have you ever seen a jay protecting

a nest?

MRS. BUNDY

I have seen jays doing everything it

is conceivable for jays to do.

Ornithology happens to be my

avocation, Miss Daniels. You're

talking about preservation of the

species, a hen protecting her young.

There's a vast difference between...

MELANIE

Maybe they're all protecting the

species. Maybe they're tired of being

shot at and roasted in ovens and...

MRS. BUNDY

Are you discussing gamebirds now?

All birds are not gamebirds, you

know.

MELANIE

I don't know anything about birds

except that they're attacking this

town.

SALESMAN

Then fight back. Get yourselves guns

and wipe them off the face of the

earth.

MRS. BUNDY

That would hardly be possible.

DEKE

Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

MRS. BUNDY

Because there are 8,650 species of

birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.

It's estimated that five billion,

seven hundred and fifty million birds

live in the United States alone. The

five continents of the world...

SALESMAN

(muttering)

Kill them all. Get rid of them.

Messy animals.

MRS. BUNDY

...probably contain more than a

hundred billion birds!

DRUNK

It's the end of the world!

DEKE

Well, we seem to have more than our

share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.

Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe

they've all gone crazy.

HELEN

Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want

it at the table?

SHOLES

No. Here's fine.

(he begins eating)

HELEN

Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

DEKE

Coming.

HELEN

(angrily)

Are we running a business here -- or

a bird sanctuary?

SHOLES

(beginning to change

his mind)

Actually, those gulls must have been

after the fish.

MRS. BUNDY

Of course.

SHOLES

Makes a lot more sense than... well,

an attack.

MRS. BUNDY

Of course it does. If we believe

that birds are attacking, why... why

next we'll believe that grasshoppers

and cockroaches are capable of...

DRUNK

Cockroaches!  Urghh!

WOMAN

Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

BOY

Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

SHOLES

Maybe we're all getting a little

carried away by this. Admittedly, a

few birds acted strangely. That's no

reason to believe...

MELANIE

This isn't a few birds! I keep telling

you that! These are gulls and swifts

and crows and...

MRS. BUNDY

And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

MELANIE

Maybe! Is it impossible?

MRS. BUNDY

Yes. I have never known birds of

different species to flock together.

The very concept is unimaginable.

(laughing)

Why if that happened, we wouldn't

have a chance. How could we possible

hope to fight them?

SHOLES

We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.

Bundy.

WOMAN

(calling from table)

Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

HELEN

(concerned)

Is everything all right, ma'am?

WOMAN

Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the

road.

SAM

(coming from kitchen)

What's the matter? Something wrong

out here?

DEKE

Nothing's wrong.

SAM

All this shouting.

MRS. BUNDY

We're fighting a war, Sam.

SAM

A war? Against who? Did the

Russians...?

SHOLES

Against birds.

WOMAN

(suddenly)

I'm glad you all think this is so

amusing. You've frightened my children

half out of their wits.

BOY

I'm not scared, Mommy.

WOMAN

Keep quiet. If that young lady saw

an attack on the school, why won't

you believe her?

SAM

What attack? Who attacked the school?

WOMAN

Birds did. Crows! And you're all

sitting around here debating! What

do you want them to do next? Crash

through that window?

LITTLE GIRL

(frightened by her

mother)

Mommy!

WOMAN

Quiet! Why don't you all get home?

Lock your doors and windows!

(her hysteria rising)

Put on your coats, children!

(to Deke)

What's the fastest road to San

Francisco?

DEKE

The freeway, ma'am.

WOMAN

Where do I get it?

SALESMAN

I'm going out that way, lady. You

can follow me.

WOMAN

Then let's go. Now!

SALESMAN

I haven't finished my drink.

WOMAN

(on edge of panic,

shouting at her

children)

Put on your coats! Do you want to

get trapped here?

BOY

I can't find my scarf.

WOMAN

Look in your sleeve!

MITCH

Melanie?

MITCH

(going to her)

I got here as fast as I could.

Where's Cathy?

MELANIE

At Annie's house. She's all right.

SAM

Al, why aren't you over there where

the attack was?

MALONE

Because I just got back from Dan

Fawcett's place, that's why.

MITCH

He was killed last night. By birds.

MALONE

Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know

that for a fact.

MRS. BUNDY

What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

MALONE

Santa Rosa police think it was a

felony murder. They think a burglar

broke in and killed him.

WOMAN

Were the Santa Rosa police at your

school today?

(impatiently, to

salesman)

Are you coming?

SALESMAN

Take it easy, lady.

(through window)

There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

DRUNK

(quoting)

"Look at the birds of the air: they

do not sow or read, yet your heavenly

father feeds them."

WOMAN

I'll never feed another bird as long

as I live!

SALESMAN

Something like this happened in Santa

Cruz last year. The town was covered

with seagulls.

WOMAN

Can't you please finish your drink?

MRS. BUNDY

That's right, sir, I recall it. A

large flock of seagulls got lost in

a fog and headed in for the town,

where all the lights were.

SALESMAN

They made some mess, too, smashing

into houses and everything.

(shaking his head)

They always make a mess. We're better

off without them.

MRS. BUNDY

The point is that no one seemed to

get upset about it. They were gone

the next morning, just as if nothing

at all had happened. Poor things.

WOMAN

I'm leaving! Are you coming?

SALESMAN

All right, all right!

(he downs his drink)

Hope you figure this out, folks.

DRUNK

It's the end of the world.

SHOLES

Well, I'd better get back to the

cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

DEKE

Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

MITCH

Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

MITCH

Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

SHOLES

No one ever said you were, Mitch.

MITCH

(flatly)

I think we're in trouble. I don't

know how or why this started, but I

know it's here and I know we'd be

crazy to ignore it.

MRS. BUNDY

(sarcastically)

Ignore what? The bird war?

MITCH

(exploding)

Yes, the bird war, the bird attack,

the bird plague, you can call it

what you want to, they're out there

massing someplace and they'll be

back, you can count on that!

MRS. BUNDY

Ridiculous!

MITCH

Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home

and polish your binoculars?

SAM

Go on, Mitch.

MITCH

If we don't do something now, if we

don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

SHOLES

Look, Mitch, even if this is true,

even if all the birds...

MITCH

Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

SHOLES

(after a long pause)

No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't

see any reason for it.

MITCH

It's happening. Isn't that a good

enough reason?

SHOLES

(thoughtfully)

I like Bodega Bay as well as any

man. If I thought...

(he shakes his head)

MITCH

Then help me, Sebastian. You're an

important man in this town. If you'll

help, the rest will.

SHOLES

Help how? What do you want to do?

MITCH

I'm not sure, but...

SHOLES

If you don't even know what you want

to do...

MELANIE

Listen to him, please.

SAM

(taking position beside

Melanie)

You listen to him, Sebastian!

MITCH

I only know we've got to drive them

away from town -- before they drive

us away.

SHOLES

How?

MITCH

Mrs. Bundy, you said something about

Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting

lost in the fog, and heading in for

the lights.

DEKE

We don't have any fog this time of

year, Mitch.

MITCH

We'll make our own fog.

SHOLES

How do you plan to do that?

MITCH

With smoke.

MALONE

There's an ordinance against burning

anything in this town, unless it's...

MITCH

We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army

uses.

DEKE

What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad

as birds.

MRS. BUNDY

Birds are not bad!

SHOLES

How can we go on living here if we

blanket the town with smoke?

MITCH

Can we go on living here otherwise?

SAM

(slowly)

It's worth a try, Sebastian.

MELANIE

Look!

DEKE

(alarmed)

Gulls!

MITCH

They're back!

SHOLES

They're only the usual... What are

you...

MITCH

(to Melanie)

Stay back in here.

MELANIE

Mitch...! Mitch!

WOMAN

Why are they doing it?! Why are they

doing it...?!

MRS. BUNDY

([Mrs. Bundy offers a

weak explanation of

why the birds could

have gone berserk

like this. This

information should

be obtained from Dr.

Stager.])

MITCH

(looking up)

I think they're going.

MITCH

I think it's safe to get out now.

MELANIE

Don't let's take any chances.

MITCH

We've got to get Cathy.

MELANIE'S VOICE

Look... the crows again.

MELANIE

Careful, Mitch. The crows may be

back in the play yard.

MELANIE

(as the birds flutter

into the air)

Mitch! Don't!

MELANIE

Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of

here!

MELANIE

Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

MELANIE

You drive, Mitch.

MELANIE

(holding her breath)

I don't think they're coming.

CATHY

On our way back from taking Michele

home... we... we heard the explosion

and went outside to... see what...

what it was.

(pause)

All at once the... the birds were

everywhere. All at once.  She... she

pushed me inside and... they covered

her.

(pause)

Annie.

(pause)

She pushed me inside.

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

The town looks clear.

MITCH

The bay doesn't.

MELANIE

How long have they been gathering

there?

MITCH

The past fifteen minutes.

(pause)

It seems to be a pattern, doesn't

it? They strike and disappear, and

then they start massing again.

MELANIE

I keep thinking of Annie.

(she squeezes her

eyes shut)

MITCH

(after a long pause)

It... it doesn't look very different,

does it? A little smoke over the

town, but otherwise...

MELANIE

(looking)

Even the birds sitting out there.

It does look very much the same,

Mitch. This could be last week.

MITCH

It may not be last week again for a

long long time.

MELANIE

Look. They're still coming.

MITCH

Do you want to try your father again?

(Melanie shakes her

head.  Puzzled, Mitch

looks at her)

MELANIE

I tried a little while ago. The

phone's dead.

MITCH

Have we still got power?

MELANIE

Yes.

(leaning against him)

I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very

tired.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Mitch! I'm getting something on the

radio!

LYDIA

I can't get any of the local stations.

I think this is San Francisco.

ANNOUNCER

...would include formulation of a

central financing committee to handle

credit and to allocate responsibility

for the various facets of the project.

A vote on the motion is expected

early tomorrow morning.

ANNOUNCER

Continuing with the local news, police

are still investigating the series

of valuable jade burglaries in the

Chinatown area. The round-up of known

criminals has not as yet produced a

suspect, but Commissioner Nelson

said today he was certain the

burglaries were quote linked and the

work of the team of professionals

unquote.

(pause)

In Bodega Bay early this morning, a

large flock of crows attacked a group

of children who were leaving the

school during a fire drill. One little

girl was seriously injured and taken

to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but

the majority of children reached

safety in the town.

(pause)

On the national scene today, the

opening of the new session of Congress

was marked by a State of the Union

address that...

MITCH

Is that all?

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

...drew a standing ovation for the

President. The Chief Executive, in

discussing our relation to Europe

and the rest of the world community

said: "These various elements of our

foreign policy lead as I have said

to a single goal --

MITCH

(sighing)

We're going to need more wood for

the fire. We can't let it go out.

ANNOUNCER

(continuing as drone

in background)

The goal of a peaceful world of free

and independent states.  This is our

guide for the present and our vision

for the future -- a free community

of nations, independent but

interdependent, uniting north and

south, east and west, in one great

family of man, outgrowing and

transcending the hates and fears

that rend our age.  We will not reach

that goal today or tomorrow.  We may

not reach it in our lifetime.  But

the quest is the great adventure of

our century.  We sometimes chafe at

the burdens of our obligations, the

complexity of our decisions, the

agony of our choices, but there is

no comfort or security for us in

evasion, no solution in abdication,

no relief in irresponsibility.

(pause)

In assuming the tasks of the

Presidency, I said that few

generations, in all history, had

been granted the role of being the

great defender of freedom in its

hour of maximum danger.  This is our

good fortune, and I welcome it now

as I did when I first took office.

(pause)

For it is the fate of this generation --

Of you in the Congress and of me as

President -- to live with a struggle

we did not start, in a world we did -

not make. But the pressures of life

are not always distributed by choice.

And while no nation has ever faced

such a challenge, no nation has ever

been ready to seize the burden and

the glory of...

LYDIA

(pause)

Did you you get the windows in the

attic, Mitch?

MITCH

I got them all, Mother.

LYDIA

When do you think they'll come?

MITCH

I don't know.

LYDIA

If there are... larger birds, Mitch...

they'll get into the house.

MITCH

That's a chance we have to take.

LYDIA

Maybe we ought to leave.

MITCH

Not now.  Not while they're massing

out there.

LYDIA

When?

MITCH

I don't know when.  We'll see what...

LYDIA

Where will we go?

MITCH

I don't know yet.  I think we'll be

safe here.

(Pause)

Let's bring that wood in.

LYDIA

What happens when we run out of wood?

MITCH

I don't know. We'll break up the

furni...

LYDIA

(shouting)

You don't know, you don't know!

When will you know? When we're all

dead? Like Annie?

CATHY

(shrieking it, her

face white)

Mother!

LYDIA

(at Mitch)

If your father were here...

MITCH

(sharply)

Mother! I'm trying my best!

(shaking his head)

I'm... trying... my...

LYDIA

(trembling, nodding)

I'm sorry, Mitch.

MITCH

Let's get the wood. Why don't you

make us all some coffee, Mother?

MELANIE

Where are they heading?

MITCH

Inland.

MELANIE

Santa Rosa?

MITCH

Maybe.

MITCH (O.S.)

(gently)

Come on. Let's get this wood in.

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

That's the last of it.

LYDIA

Did you close the door?

MELANIE

And locked it.

CATHY

Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in

here?

LYDIA

(snapping it)

No!

CATHY

Mom, they're in a cage!

LYDIA

They're birds!

MITCH

(softly)

Let them stay in the other room.

CATHY

Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The

birds.

MITCH

(putting wood on fire)

I don't know, honey.

CATHY

Why are they trying to kill people?

MITCH

I wish I could say. But if I could

answer that, I could also tell you

why people are trying to kill people.

LYDIA

Mitch...

MITCH

Shhh. Shhh.

CATHY

(in terror)

I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I

want to throw...

MELANIE

I'll go with you.

MELANIE

When will they stop?

MITCH

I thought they'd have stopped by

now.

MELANIE

What time is it?

MITCH

Almost two a.m.

MELANIE

You must be exhausted.

MITCH

How about you?

MITCH

I wonder if Cathy fed them.

MITCH

(holding her)

You should have left when you wanted

to.

MITCH

You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

MELANIE

I don't want to be safe. I want to

be with you.

MITCH

(in the darkness)

The power.

MELANIE

Mitch...

MITCH

Wait here. Don't move.

MITCH

We'd better light some of those lamps.

MELANIE

No... wait.

(pause)

Hold me.

MITCH

I think they're easing off.

DISSOLVE

MELANIE

(whispering)

Mitch?

MELANIE

(still whispering)

Mitch?

MITCH (O.S.)

Melanie!

MITCH (O.S.)

Melanie, open the door!

LYDIA (O.S.)

(screaming)

Mitch, get her out of there!

MITCH (O.S.)

Melanie!

MITCH

Mother, get a rope!

LYDIA

Oh, my God, look at her!

MITCH

(shouting)

Get a rope!

MITCH

(yelling)

Mother! Hurry!

MITCH

Cathy! Get a blanket and some

bandages!

CATHY

(at the foot of the

stars, on the verge

of tears)

Is she all right?

MELANIE

I'm... I'm....

MITCH

Just lie there and keep still.

LYDIA

Let me do that, Mitch.

MITCH

I can handle it.

LYDIA

I know you can.

(her eyes meet his)

But I'd like to.

MELANIE

(weakly)

Please don't mess me up with bandages,

Mrs. Brenner.

LYDIA

Shhhh. Shhhh.

MELANIE

Please.

LYDIA

(as she works)

I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

MITCH

You're doing fine.

LYDIA

(Apologizing)

I mean. I want to...

CATHY

Listen!

LYDIA

They're gone. God have mercy, they're

gone.

MITCH

They're gone. The same pattern.

LYDIA

But they'll be back.

MITCH

We won't be here.

LYDIA

Where can we go, Mitch? There's no

place to go.

MITCH

I want to try for San Francisco.

There are buildings there. Steel and

concrete!

LYDIA

(shaking her head)

We'd never make it. They're probably

all over the road.

MITCH

We have to try it.

(a long silence)

We can't stay here.

(silence)

Melanie needs help.

(silence)

Mother, the house won't take another

attack.

LYDIA

If...

(pause)

If... when we get to San Francisco...

(pause)

If they're already there?

MITCH

They won't be.

LYDIA

If they are?

MITCH

We'll worry about that when we get

there.

LYDIA

I'm frightened, terribly frightened.

I... I don't know what's out there,

Mitch.

MITCH

What do we have to know, Mother?

We're all together, we all love each

other, we all need each other. What

else is there? Mother, I want us to

stay alive!

LYDIA

(nodding; then after

a pause)

I started to say... inside...

MITCH

You don't have to.

MITCH

I think we'd better get started.

DISSOLVE

CATHY

May I take them, Mitch?

CATHY

They haven't harmed anyone.

LYDIA

Take them.

MITCH

(with a slow nod)

We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

MITCH

Be careful with that door.

MELANIE

(weakly)

Mitch, if they hear the car

starting... if they see movement...

MITCH

We'll take it slow until we get to

the main road.

(pause)

Are you ready?

MITCH

All right.

(he takes a deep breath)

Here we go.

MITCH

Shhh.  Shhhh.

CATHY

(whispering)

Mitch, let's turn back.

MITCH

Shhh. Shhhhh.

LYDIA

Mitch!

MELANIE

Can we turn back?

MITCH

I... I don't think so. If we get

through town, I think we'll be all

right.

MELANIE

Then go ahead, Mitch.

MITCH

(almost as a prayer)

Here we go.

(he rams down on the

accelerator)

MELANIE

Mitch!

LYDIA

(almost a prayer)

Dear God... dear God... please,

please, what have we done? Please.

(and then in anger at

the roof and the

birds)

Can't they leave us alone?

(shrieking it)

LEAVE US ALONE!

LYDIA

We're losing them.

CATHY

Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll

be all right? In the trunk? Can they

breath?

MITCH

(with the faintest

smile)

I think they'll be all right, honey.

MITCH

It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

FADE OUT:

THE END
