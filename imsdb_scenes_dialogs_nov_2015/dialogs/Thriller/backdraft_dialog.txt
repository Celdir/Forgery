SHOOTING DRAFT

OLDER KID

You're doing it wrong.

YOUNGER KID

Shut up.

OLDER KID

You're doing it wrong.

STEPHEN

It doesn't go like that.

BRIAN

Who asked you?

STEPHEN

If you do it like that it'll open in

the fire. Then you'll get burned and

DIE.

DENNIS

Who's going to die?

STEPHEN

Brian. He's not doing it right, dad.

He never does it right.

DENNIS

(gestures for them to

come out)

Well, let's have a look.

DENNIS

Your brother's right. If you don't

fasten these correctly they could

open and you'd get burned.

STEPHEN

And DIE!

BRIAN

You wouldn't let me die, would you,

Dad?

DENNIS

McCaffreys are smarter than fire,

Brian.

(playfully slaps their

shoulders)

How 'bout lunch, huh?

STEPHEN

Fireman shit?

DENNIS

Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd

you grow up, a barn?

STEPHEN

Firehouse.

DENNIS

Cute.

DENNIS

(sighs)

Never fails...

DENNIS

Big deal?

AXE

Medium deal.

DENNIS

Want to come along, Brian? Watch the

old man earn his keep?

STEPHEN

(pissed)

Dad!

DENNIS

You've come along a dozen times,

Stephen, give your brother a chance.

We'll be back in a few minutes.

(to Brian)

How 'bout it, sport?

BRIAN

Sure!

DENNIS

Hit the button, Brian.

DENNIS

Stay near the truck.

(winks)

And keep an eye out for us, huh?

We're short handed today.

ENGINEER

Don't stray too far, little man.

BRIAN

Dad...

AXE

Get us some backup! We need some

goddamn backup!

CHIEF FITZGERALD

Is this a joke?

BRIAN

If it was a joke, sir, you'd be

laughing.

CHIEF FITZGERALD

You walked out on this academy six

years ago. One week to graduation.

You think we forgot that? You think

I did?

BRIAN

I want another shot, Sir.

CHIEF FITZGERALD

(beat)

Look, everybody remembers your old

man. Being his son, all you had to

do was breathe to graduate here.

Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew

us off. Why should I take you back?

BRIAN

If you remember, sir, my test scores

were in the top --

CHIEF FITZGERALD

-- I don't give a damn what your

test scores were, maybe you could

have been a good firemen, but you

had your shot.

BRIAN

I need another one, sir.

CHIEF FITZGERALD

Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try

again next year.

BRIAN

No, it isn't out of your hands or

you wouldn't even have met me. If I

push you have to let me back in.

Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

CHIEF FITZGERALD

(simmers)

Even if you graduate this academy,

you've still got nine months of

probation. That's hard duty, son. If

you don't really love this job, it'll

kill you.

BRIAN

(rises)

See you Monday. Sir.

CUT TO:

CHIEF FITZGERALD

(at podium)

Though the world changes every day,

some things are truly forever:

Courage, devotion, and honor in what

we do. This class is a special one,

for we dedicate it to the three

firefighters that have fallen this

year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter

and Michael Petzold...

(silent beat)

Ladies and gentlemen, it is with

pleasure that I certify that Candidate

Class number 322, having successfully

completed all academy requirements,

are hereby graduated to the Chicago

Fire Department.

BRIAN

Completely out of control.

TIM

What the hell are we waiting for?

CANDIDATE

Hot off the presses, guys. Station

assignments.

BRIAN

A beer, Willy!

WILLY

Well, if it isn't the littlest

McCaffrey.

(to candidates with

hose)

Hey! You break anything with that

you buy it!

(to Brian)

Sorry, there must be something wrong

with my eyes. I keep thinking that's

a fire department uniform.

BRIAN

It's in my blood, Willy.

WILLY

Really. Well, let's have a look at

what else was "in your blood". I

always look forward to getting these,

they make such a nice collage for

the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales,

Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."

BRIAN

Didn't offer the kinda growth and

challenge I need.

WILLY

Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile

Log Cabins". That was in your blood

about six months wasn't it?

BRIAN

Management were pin heads.

WILLY

"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?

BRIAN

Coffee sucked.

WILLY

And just this year, "Brian's Sound

Spectrum". Your own company even.

Big step.

BRIAN

I was ahead of my time.

WILLY

You know, I've got a perfect little

spot here for "Brian McCaffrey,

Fireman"...

TIM

Aren't you even curious?

BRIAN

Engine 115, right?

TIM

(opens it, surprised)

How'd you know? These are supposed

to be sealed.

BRIAN

Lucky guess.

(winks)

And a case of scotch to a captain in

station assignments.

TIM

You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?

BRIAN

Lots of fires. They promote faster

there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s

list, half the guys on it came from

that battalion. Gotta think about

your future, Timmy. 115's the station.

TIM

Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your

way into a station, why not 17 with

me and your brother?

CUT TO:

TIM

Hey, that's my cousin's company!

C'mon! Let's go!

BRIAN

(surprised)

Mrs. Viatkus...

JENNIFER

Brian.

BRIAN

(surprised)

Jennifer.

JENNIFER

You're back.

BRIAN

You look great.

JENNIFER

Thanks for calling.

BRIAN

Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low

profile... the academy... I graduated

today.

JENNIFER

Huh.

BRIAN

So... I see you're still in the

neighborhood.

JENNIFER

Not quite. Just visiting. I live in

Lincoln Park now.

BRIAN

Yeah? What have you been up to?

JENNIFER

I work for city hall.

BRIAN

Really? No kidding.

JENNIFER

What, you think I just dried up and

blew away when you left? The world

does turn once in awhile Brian, even

without your permission.

TIM

Don't want you overheating, Brian!

TIM

Okay okay! Uncle!

JENNIFER

You've certainly matured.

BRIAN

Well, if nothing else, it's nice to

know we can still be friends.

JENNIFER

I don't want to be your friend, Brian.

TIM

Let's go, man!

TIM

(points)

That way.

DRIVER

Tim! You crazy motherfucker!

TIM

What'cha got?

DRIVER

Box alarm. Walton Ave.

TIM

We'll meet ya.

TIM

(also looking at body)

Man. Something sure put a crimp in

his evening.

BRIAN

Backdraft.

STEPHEN

Well, look what we have here. Nice

costume. Rent it?

BRIAN

I want to thank you for coming to my

graduation, Stephen. It was a great

inspiration to me.

STEPHEN

So you're going to fight fires now,

huh?

STEPHEN

(re smears)

Doesn't work on you.

(turns to leave)

See ya around, little brother.

BRIAN

Not likely.

STEPHEN

(turns)

Well, see you're wrong already. Had

a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we

decided in the interest of brotherly

love, that maybe you shouldn't be

way over on the other side of town.

So starting tomorrow, your assigned

to company 17. My company.

(Brian's color drops

a hue)

One case of scotch, you're getting

cheap in your old age, Brian...

SHADOW

If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll

start charging you admission.

STEPHEN

Got a cause?

SHADOW

Are the glory boys actually showing

interest in Investigation's work? I

may have a stroke.

STEPHEN

The glory boys just want to finish

their report so they can go home.

SHADOW

They're gonna have to wait a few

days on this one.

BRIAN

(to coroner crew)

Hey, you forgot... this.

CORONER DRIVER

We always leave something for the

dogs.

BRIAN

Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man?

BRIAN

It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.

BRIAN

(bandito accent)

"Spinach? We don't need no stinking

spinach". Remember?

KID

Mom! Mom!

BRIAN

Hellooo...

HELEN

Brian?

BRIAN

Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

HELEN

You look like... Brian.

HELEN

'Bout written you off. How long have

you been in town?

BRIAN

Four months.

HELEN

Four months?

BRIAN

I know, I know, Should'a called.

I've been really busy. I joined the

fire department.

HELEN

Oh Brian...

(beat)

You guys... you really know how to

put each other through it, don't

you?

BRIAN

That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.

HELEN

Yeah, you'd be surprised what three

years can do to a kid.

BRIAN

Sean, come on out, man. What, you

forget your favorite uncle?

HELEN

Stephen told him you were killed in

a hot tub accident.

SEAN

(intense)

Dad was kidding, Mom.

BRIAN

Well that's two things to strangle

Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

HELEN

(beat)

Stephen's not staying here now, Brian.

He moved out last April.

BRIAN

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

HELEN

You guys ought to try picking up a

phone once in awhile.

BRIAN

Hey.

BRIAN

I talked to Helen...

BRIAN

...Man, I thought dad's boat was

finally retired to the family

graveyard. Don't you worry about

falling out of this thing?

BRIAN

I like what you've done with the

place.

STEPHEN

It's comin' along... want a beer?

BRIAN

Been ripping off fire stations?

STEPHEN

It's old stuff Adcox gave me that

the department was going to throw

out anyway. Still good enough though

for this tub.

BRIAN

Bachman Turner Overdrive?

(looks through music

rack)

...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen

Bishop? Oh man...

BRIAN

My God, an actual operating 8-track.

STEPHEN

What, you've never seen one before?

BRIAN

In the Field Museum once.

STEPHEN

It works.

BRIAN

It worked when you were in sixth

grade.

STEPHEN

People actually used to pay you for

this?

BRIAN

Millions, Stephen -- And sexual

favors.

STEPHEN

Sheep don't count.

BRIAN

Yeah? What about Laura --

STEPHEN

That was never proved.

STEPHEN

Why'd you come here, Brian?

BRIAN

I wanted to know why you messed with

my station assignment. I mean, is

this really gonna have to one of

those big brother -- little brother

"you broke my GI Joe and I'm still

pissed" games?

STEPHEN

(sighs)

What is it with you, man, huh? How

do you manage to keep coming up with

new and amazing ways to screw up?

That scotch bullshit? Am I really

supposed to believe you came crawling

back home because you suddenly felt

heart strings moan for the family

biz? You were bankrupt, man.

BRIAN

Hey! You don't know me --

STEPHEN

I know you cold, Brian. The scary

thing is, you probably could have

faked it for awhile. But you see, in

this job there's no place to hide.

Isn't like selling log cabins. You

have a bad day here -- someone dies.

And that's not fucking good enough.

Want another beer?

BRIAN

So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna

ride my ass till I cough blood?

STEPHEN

Big bad brother is going to treat

you like any other probie -- that I

don't think is going to make it.

BRIAN

There's only so much technology can

do.

(picks up his tool

box)

Thanks for the beer.

STEPHEN

Thanks for the speakers.

BRIAN

Y'know, I told myself a million times

I didn't want to be a fireman. I

said bullshit to that line about

tradition and family legacy. I know

I split, and I know how you felt...

STEPHEN

Yeah, you know. You know what it

felt like.

BRIAN

I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta

know.

STEPHEN

I think you're gonna find out, Brian.

Don't be late tomorrow.

STEPHEN

You're too late, probie.

BRIAN

(chasing)

Goddamn it, Stephen...

AXE

Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?

SCHMIDT

(re Brian to Adcox)

You know this rug rat?

AXE

Know him? I practically raised him.

(Jewish mom)

And he never calls, he never writes...

BRIAN

I'm Brian.

GRINDLE

I'm sorry.

GRINDLE

Boys, I do believe we have a

barbecue...

GRINDLE

(staring at confusing

smoke)

I hate it when we gotta fucking go

look for it.

STEPHEN

(to Schmidt)

Call in another alarm. We're gonna

need some back-up.

AXE

(to Stephen)

Oh these moments do try me...

STEPHEN

(admiring car)

Be gentle.

SCHMIDT

It's only rock 'n roll, kid.

STEPHEN

Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?

STEPHEN

You're doing it wrong.

STEPHEN

(to Brian)

Stay beside me.

AXE

Wash it to the windows?

STEPHEN

No, we'll hit the son of a bitch

head on.

AXE

It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta

get behind it.

STEPHEN

Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy.

It'll just steam on us. It won't

flash. Go high in the ceiling.

STEPHEN

(to fire)

I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam

us!

(to firemen)

Let's go!

STEPHEN

Ya love it, probie?

BRIAN

I'm in heaven, Lt.

STEPHEN

Hook us up to a stand-pipe.

STEPHEN

Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're

gonna loose this!

STEPHEN

Hey Otis, is it...?

SCHMIDT

(into radio)

Yeah.

STEPHEN

Goddamn it, where's our backup?

Where's the second-in companies?

SCHMIDT'S VOICE

Sorry, man. John Wayne time.

STEPHEN

(to firemen)

Dig in!

STEPHEN

Dig in, goddamn it!

STEPHEN

You're gonna love this.

SANTOS

Help... Oh God...

GRINDLE

You go, we go.

BRIAN

Hey!

NIGHTENGALE

Sorry man, I thought you were dead.

PENGELLY

(ladder co. captain)

Stephen! BC's on the radio. Says

they think a civilian got left behind

downstairs.

STEPHEN

Adcox! Take Tim and do a search.

STEPHEN

Don't you fold on me now, man.

STEPHEN

Clear the hose for me.

BRIAN

Hey, I think it's coming from a

different staircase.

BRIAN

I got one!

BRIAN

I got somebody! I got somebody!

BRIAN

Is she... Is she alive?

PARAMEDIC

I'm afraid you're a little too late

with this one.

GRINDLE

Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I

heard you two were close.

BRIAN

Shit...

STEPHEN

(appearing beside him)

You all right?

BRIAN

Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right

now.

STEPHEN

Y'know, you got an awful short memory

for direct orders. I told you to

stay beside me.

BRIAN

-- C'mon, Stephen.

STEPHEN

-- You split the team, man. And what

was that crap with the standpipe?

You'd think you and a hose were never

introduced before.

BRIAN

Goddamn it Stephen!

STEPHEN

-- I told you to stay next to me!

BRIAN

-- I was doin' it! I was up there

fucking doin' it. You don't know,

man, you don't know what I did!

STEPHEN

What you did was drop the ball,

Probie. Get that right.

PENGELLY

(from end of alley)

Hey! Stevie! They're callin' for ya.

STEPHEN

Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty

two days a month off sounded pretty

good twelve weeks ago, huh?

SWAYZAK

(to reporters)

Roger, Paul... How's it going, guys?

REPORTER

Another fire in this district. Getting

to be Cinder Alley up here.

JENNIFER

(walking up)

You used that last week.

AXE

(yelling down from

window)

(to Brian)

Hey! Probie! We're still workin'

here, man.

GRINDLE

(to Adcox)

Stephen man, what's going through

that guy's head? Takin' it on in the

first room... this shit's happening

too often. It could've flashed.

Should've flashed.

AXE

But it didn't. Guy knows.

GRINDLE

Guy's lucky.

AXE

Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the

clincher. You did okay.

BRIAN

My Lt. might have something to say

about that.

AXE

Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian.

You're working for the toughest Lt.

on the job. Saw him once pick up a

probie he thought was moving too

slow and throw him into a burning

building. It's just bad luck you're

family.

BRIAN

(beat)

John, when you're in there... in the

fire... do you ever see...

STEPHEN

(from across room,

interrupting)

C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...

BRIAN

(to Adcox)

-- Never mind.

SHADOW

Alderman Swayzak.

SWAYZAK

Investigator Rimgale.

SHADOW

I need to get in the trunk.

SHADOW

Awful expensive shoes to be wearing

at a fireground, Alderman. But then

I guess you haven't been to too many

fires.

JENNIFER

I wanted to talk to you about Alan

Seagrave's death. We still haven't

gotten a fire report from your office.

SHADOW

You'll have an answer as soon as I

do.

SWAYZAK

People are asking how a prominent

taxpayer got stuffed through the

windshield of his own car. They're

asking me.

JENNIFER

--The point is, Investigator, you

haven't even told us yet if the fire

was accidental. We're starting to

get the feeling your office is

dragging out this case to embarrass

the Alderman because of his fire

dept. reorganization program --

SHADOW

-- You mean his firehouse closing

program, -- Don't you?

JENNIFER

We'd just be very disappointed if it

turned out your office was playing

politics.

SWAYZAK

-- Because I'm not. I care about

this city, and I care about this

department --

SHADOW

(calm of a monk)

Alderman, I have a remarkably

uncomplicated job. To decide if a

fire's arson, and if so catch the

pain in the ass doing it. But to be

honest, if my methodical investigative

methods just happen to muck up the

campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees,

well, I guess I can't say I sleep

any less peacefully.

SWAYZAK

I wish I could just fire the son of

a bitch.

STEPHEN

Hey! Swayzak!

STEPHEN

We almost lost a whole company up

there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back-

up since you closed '33. And we really

appreciate it, the guys and me.

Honest. I know you've got my vote

for mayor.

SWAYZAK

Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's

a problem, please, work with our

task force to fix it.

STEPHEN

Oh yeah, your famous task force...

three guys have already died this

year because of the cuts made by

your "task force"...

GRINDLE

Stevie, c'mon man...

SWAYZAK

You see that funny glow that's

starting to blink in the corner of

your eye, Lt? That's your career

dissipation light -- and it just

went into overtime.

STEPHEN

If anybody's light's gonna blink,

it's yours.

AXE

You're in firemanland now, Swayzak.

Do yourself a favor and just walk

away.

BRIAN

This is your city job?

AXE

That's Franny. She likes firemen.

STEPHEN

Tim, fill out the alarm card.

(to Brian)

Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the

ladders and hang some hose.

GRINDLE

That's The Thing. You can't stay

unless he likes you.

BRIAN

Have you guys got something against

dalmatians?

BRIAN

Do you have to do that?

TIM

(pumped)

Could you believe that fire? Man!

First day! There I was, Adcox and

me, pullin' that lady right out of

the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it

here -- No surround and drown for

this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn

Stephen's amazing. You see how he

took that fire by the balls? I'm

gonna be that good some day, you

watch.

TIM

Y'know what Stephen said to me, right

when all the shit was coming hard?

"You never know till the moment the

fire stares you down if you're just

gonna do this job or be great at

it".

BRIAN

Ah man, is he usin' that line now on

you? What, you think he made that

little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used

to have to listen to my old man use

that every morning.

GRINDLE

-- C'mon! C'mon! Go! Go!

GRINDLE

No! C'mon! This way!

BRIAN

What's going on?

PENGELLY

Dinner, Probies. Get started.

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

Better be good.

SANTOS

Or we feed you to The Thing.

AXE

Gentlemen, please... As 17's official

toastmaster --

SANTOS

And bullshitter.

AXE

Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to

mention that you were cut out of my

will?

(company laughs)

I think it appropriate that we

recognize the two asswipes -- I mean

probationary firemen -- among us who

today were baptized officially into

the world of Old Man Fire. First to

Tim, who despite being handicapped

at birth with a rather dull expression

and a really hideous pair of ears,

not only took on the beast but pulled

from its clutches -- assisted by a

more famous and brilliant firefighter --

me -- a kicking and screaming civilian

that will probably end up suing us

for breaking her fingernail.

(laughs)

And to Brian, who's own contribution

was both more beautiful and less

likely to sue.

AXE

Y'know, when I heard that both

McCaffrey brothers were going to be

assigned together here, well, my

heart was filled with... a sudden

desire to transfer.

(laughs)

So raise a glass, lads. To funny-

looking Tim, and the McCaffrey

brothers, who despite years of getting

on each other's nerves have managed

with great effort... to still be

pissed off at each other. Gentlemen!

COMPANY

(together, a toast)

Fuck you!

STEPHEN

Bye, boys.

SCHMIDT

(winks)

We'll keep it warm for you.

DISSOLVE TO:

STEPHEN

Clean the toilets.

STEPHEN

Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya

guys tonight at Fitzgerald's

retirement party.

STEPHEN

You want a ride?

BRIAN

Thanks.

STEPHEN

Brian --

(a beat that hangs

there)

-- See ya tonight.

STEPHEN

Hey.

BRIAN

Hey.

STEPHEN

I gotta change the view...

GRINDLE

Heard you didn't make the list for

captain, man. I'm sorry...

BRIAN

(holding bottle,

interrupting)

With grenadine, right?

JENNIFER

When I was twenty.

BRIAN

Oooh, very sophisticated. Having

fun?

JENNIFER

Look, I'm not the same girl who had

nothing better to do than wrap her

legs around you on a Saturday night.

This isn't about fun. I'm working

here.

BRIAN

Carrying Swayzak's notebook?

JENNIFER

Let me tell you something. Martin

Swayzak is going to be this town's

next mayor.

BRIAN

Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope.

How can you work for that guy?

JENNIFER

Why do you think Marty came here

tonight? Because he cares about your

department. You don't know how hard

he works. You don't know about his

programs helping West Side --

BRIAN

-- All I know is that his programs

are getting firemen hurt.

JENNIFER

Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about

efficiency. I've got two cousins on

the job, you think I'd work for him

if I didn't believe in it?

JENNIFER

(to man)

-- Tom, how nice to see you. I know

Marty'll be very happy you came.

Thanks so much for the donation.

(to woman)

Marie... how's little Kevin? Really?

Seen the polls? This is the year...

JENNIFER

-- The thing that really makes me

angry is the way your union has --

BRIAN

What was that? Oh man, you have picked

up a few moves since John Paul II

Boulevard.

JENNIFER

Yeah, well I like to think I'm just

a little past hanging out on JP II

watching the Irish pick fights and

Litwalks barf in the planters.

BRIAN

I seem to remember some pretty good

nights on JP II.

SALLY

(looking at Swayzak

across room)

Yuck, what a scumbag.

AXE

(to Santos)

Fuckin' city transferred Sally three

months ago out of parking violations

into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta

pay my own goddamn tickets and she's

stuck with an asshole.

SANTOS

Pay more?

SALLY

(shrugs)

No, but there's more exercise --

being chased around a desk.

GRINDLE

Aw, I don't believe this shit.

SCHMIDT

Somebody get a shovel! You seen this,

Stephen?

BRIAN

What?

TIM

(reads)

"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey,

on his very first fire, showed the

kind of bravery and courage of a

veteran firefighter when he risked

life and limb to double-check a

burning floor alone, emerging

victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a

seamstress for the North Shore

Clothing Company... McCaffrey first

gained prominence as the subject of

a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning

photograph taken at the scene of his

father's death..."

GRINDLE

Whadda we gonna do about this?

STEPHEN

Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw

that if a guy gets in the paper --

especially if it's bullshit -- he

owes the company a drink. In fact...

(motions to waiter)

...I'll have a double. On the hero.

BRIAN

(confused)

What's going on?

SWAYZAK

Brian McCaffrey, right?

JENNIFER

Brian, this is my boss, Alderman

Swayzak.

(to Swayzak)

Brian's a big fan of yours.

BRIAN

Yeah. Big fan.

SWAYZAK

And I'm a huge fan of what you did

to save that woman, Brian.

BRIAN

Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

I didn't save that woman.

SWAYZAK

No need to be modest, Brian.

BRIAN

No, you don't understand, I saved a

mannequin.

SWAYZAK

-- That really was incredibly work

you did. You and your brother,

fighting fires together, helluva

image, isn't it? You must feel lucky

to be assigned under his command.

BRIAN

Every little boy's fantasy.

SWAYZAK

Brian, let me come to the point. I'd

like to offer you a job.

BRIAN

I have a job.

SWAYZAK

This one's still with the fire

department. One of our best

investigators, Don Rimgale, is working

on a very difficult, visible case

right now. We think he could use

another pair of hands and you're

exactly the kind of guy I want

representing us: An authentic hero

from a traditional firefighting clan.

BRIAN

Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions --

like dying young.

SWAYZAK

Not every job in the fire department

comes with a tombstone, Brian. This

could be a great opportunity to

move... beyond a fire engine.

BRIAN

Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire

engines sorta run in my family.

Politics don't.

JENNIFER

Boy, took you all of thirty seconds

to blow that.

BRIAN

C'mon Jennifer, he's just another

North-Side jag-off with a mouth.

JENNIFER

Brian, do you always have to be so

stupid? Think about your future for

once.

BRIAN

So now you suddenly care about my

future?

JENNIFER

Look, I didn't mean to take a piece

out of you back there, I just thought

you'd call when you came back. You

didn't and...

(beat)

Don't blow it just because of this

garbage between us.

BRIAN

Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in

front of your boss. But I'm not gonna

be a poster boy for him, I'm trying

to do something here. There's five

hundred smoke eaters in this room

that do that stuff for real every

day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of

them.

PENGELLY

Aw man, how can she dance with that

guy?

SCHMIDT

I hate that guy. He's a dispatcher.

I hate his voice.

STEPHEN

Whatever...

PENGELLY

I mean, I know women have gotta bang

somebody, but why that son of a bitch?

SCHMIDT

Hey Stevie, he's an asshole...

STEPHEN

Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a

second about Sean...

HELEN

Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we

talk about this later?

DATE

How ya doin', Stephen?

STEPHEN

Jackson.

STEPHEN

(to Helen)

What's wrong with right now? He's

your son for christ's sake. He's --

JACKSON

Hey, Stephen, what about that dumb

ass brother of yours, huh?

STEPHEN

...Yeah?

JACKSON

Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin'

stupid can a guy get?

STEPHEN

You can't talk about my brother like

that...

HELEN

(sighs)

Here we go...

JACKSON

You're crazy, man!

STEPHEN

Leave me alone!

AXE

Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!

(Stephen calms a little)

You stupid dumbshit, you never know

when to fucking quit, do you? You

ever wonder why your career's in the

fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be

stuck a Lt. for life?

STEPHEN

No.

(beat)

I need a drink.

BRIAN

You don't need a drink, man. You

need to get outta here...

JENNIFER

(to Swayzak)

Ah those McCaffreys... just hate

leaving a party with anyone left

standing...

STEPHEN

I'm okay... leave me alone...

BRIAN

So you got a 'roid going with Jackson

or what?

STEPHEN

Nah, he's nothin'. It's just

sometimes... sometimes you just gotta

punch somebody out, y'know?

STEPHEN

I don't think I can get up.

STEPHEN

Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I

can get on the cover of LIFE magazine,

too.

BRIAN

C'mon, let's crawl home.

STEPHEN

...Adcox, those guys...they don't

get it... it isn't the goddamn

promotion... or dad... I'm not my

old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get

me... I don't give a shit about being

a captain... it's just... it's just

they don't trust me anymore...

(blows out painful

breath)

...they don't trust me anymore...

STEPHEN

If you'd get out of my fuckin' way.

I could take my own goddamn shoes

off...

STEPHEN

You're such a pain in the ass...

You've always been a pain in the

ass...

STEPHEN

Jesus, it's too damn bright in here...

Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin'

blind...

BRIAN

(touching light)

This?

STEPHEN

Yeah... too bright...

STEPHEN

They don't know... they don't know

what I hear in there...

STEPHEN

...This boat could be okay, huh?...

Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me...

DISSOLVE TO:

STEPHEN

(at kids)

Hey! Knock it off!

AXE

(smiles)

Maybe you should have gotten more

sleep last night.

TIM

This everything you wanted?

WOMAN

(to Stephen)

Can I help you guys at all?

STEPHEN

Nah, we just about got it.

WOMAN

(noticing Adcox's

shirt)

Sally must be finally ironing your

shirts.

AXE

It's just new. Couple'a shifts and

it'll be as thrashed as the rest.

WOMAN

I'm sorry...

AXE

It's okay...

WOMAN

I miss him... I just miss him,

y'know?...

AXE

This job... This fuckin' job

sometimes... To buy it trying to go

the extra yard, man, that's one thing,

but to buy it just because there

wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit...

STEPHEN

Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck

Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go

into fires for them. You know that.

Christ, you taught me that.

STEPHEN

You know Knowlton pretty well?

AXE

Yeah...

STEPHEN

(beat)

Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?

AXE

Biggest in two battalions.

STEPHEN

(beat, smiles)

We're gonna be okay, man...

SCHMIDT

Is she going to get the divorce?

SANTOS

(sighs with honest

concern)

Hell if I know, man.

WASHINGTON

Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's

list!

STEPHEN

(looking at watch)

Alright... Go!

STEPHEN

Go!

STEPHEN

That isn't a football, probie. Get

it on your shoulder.

BRIAN

Having fun, fireman?

STEPHEN

You're not breaking any records,

Brian.

STEPHEN

Your shoulder. Like this!

STEPHEN

Come on! Pick it up!

STEPHEN

Run, damn you!

STEPHEN

Roll the hose.

BRIAN

What, are you kidding? By myself?

STEPHEN

You heard me.

BRIAN

What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll

let you win next time.

STEPHEN

(in Brian's face)

You got a problem with drilling,

probie?

BRIAN

No, Lt., I don't have a problem with

drilling. But let's just have one

drill. Not one for the company and

one for me.

STEPHEN

Roll the hose.

BRIAN

Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna

quit. You hear me!

STEPHEN

Well, thank God for fires...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOTHER

(grabbing his coat)

My baby! My baby's still up there!

BATTALION CHIEF

Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a

hoseline coming.

STEPHEN

Don't take that kind of shit from

it! Don't let it know you're scared!

Come on!

STEPHEN

Ready?

BRIAN

Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the

hose team...

STEPHEN

Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I

say... It won't get us.

STEPHEN

Now!

SANTOS

They think she's gonna live...

STEPHEN

You okay?

BRIAN

I waited... I would have fucking

waited...

STEPHEN

That's not what it's about, Brian.

The point is there was a kid in there.

And what if there'd been two? I went

in because that's what I do. It's my

way. It's dad's way. It isn't

everybody's way.

BRIAN

Dad's way? Where did he tell you

that? In a fucking seance?

STEPHEN

You said you wanted to know something,

Brian. What did you learn today?

(Brian doesn't answer)

What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to

move on?

BRIAN

You're right, Stephen... You win...

You're the best, man...

SECRETARY'S VOICE

(on intercom)

Brian McCaffrey on line two for

Jennifer.

JENNIFER

I'll take it in my office.

SWAYZAK

(turns to her and

smiles)

Go get him.

JENNIFER

Brian?

BRIAN

I've been thinking about what you

said the other night... If the offer's

still on the table, I'd like to talk

about it.

JENNIFER

(beat)

...Okay. I'll arrange things with

your assignment captain.

(beat)

Marty's a good man, Brian.

BRIAN

Yeah...

DISSOLVE TO:

SHADOW

(to probie)

...So stop me if I get this wrong...

The fire's almost out... You're

upstairs on the unburned floor

checking for heat. You've been told

by your Battalion Chief, your Captain,

by me, not to do anything up there

until ordered. But now the itch

starts, and all of a sudden comes

the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero.

Heroes don't just stand around. So

on your own you decided to punch out

a window for ventilation. Was that

before or after you noticed you were

standing in a lake of gasoline?

SHADOW

You could've crispered half your

company with that little stunt, but

more importantly you wrecked the

physical evidence I use to prove

it's arson. You've made my day longer,

Probie. Go home and think about that.

BRIAN

Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new

assistant.

SHADOW

Your Dennis' kid.

(beat)

I work alone.

SHADOW

Are you still here?

BRIAN

Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not

going anywhere.

SHADOW

Then go find a corner. I don't want

you in my way.

BRIAN

I think we should get something

straight here. I was assigned to

this office by the city.

SHADOW

Look, I knew your father, he had a

helluva reputation on this job. But

that don't mean you get any slack.

Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I

gotta eat you, that's the rules and

I got nothing to say about that. But

Swayzak or no, you live with me.

Step out of line, and I don't care

who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.

(beat)

You think you're the first?

BRIAN

Where are you going?

SHADOW

Pest control.

CUT TO:

RONALD

Shadow.

SHADOW

How ya doin', Ronald. Staying

comfortable?

RONALD

Didn't think you'd make it.

SHADOW

Wouldn't miss this for the world,

pal.

RONALD

(looking at Brian)

Who's this?

SHADOW

He works for me.

RONALD

Is he a fireman?

(smiles)

I like firemen.

SHADOW

You like everybody, Ronald.

RONALD

Brian McCaffrey...

(eyes light up happily)

Oh this is really a treat. Brian

McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal,

huh?

BRIAN

(heating up)

Hey, do I know you?

SHADOW

You don't know him.

RONALD

I know you.

BRIAN

(to Ronald)

What the hell are you talking about

my --

SHADOW

Knock it off. Now.

RONALD

Tell him about me, Shadow?

SHADOW

Ronald here likes telephones. Used

to tape wooden matches to the bell

striker and wrap it in cotton. Came

up with a whole little thing there,

didn't you Ronald? When you got bored,

what did you do? You just started

making calls... mostly day care

centers and retirement homes, wasn't

it?

RONALD

Did he tell you how we finally met?

SHADOW

Nobody cares, Ronald.

RONALD

Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow.

You're depriving our famous young

friend here...

VOICE IN CORRIDOR

Okay... Ronald Bowland...

RONALD

It was on State Street, right?...

Just your basic warehouse torch for

the owner. Cakewalk. But the animal...

turned on me... 'Ol Shadow here, he

shows up -- whole place is going

like hell -- my hair, my hands...

could've just let the animal take me --

but Shadow, he's a good camper, so

he tries to pull 'ol Ronald out.

Guess he didn't notice the tub of

phosphorous next to me...

(smiles)

Notice you're still a little shy

about rolling your sleeves up, Shadow.

Show him your stomach yet?

MAN

...All right, the parole board has

received Mr. Bowland's fitness report,

his ID-44, endorsement from his

section warden... Dr. Norris?

WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST

As supervising psychiatrist I would

describe Mr. Bowland's progress as

remarkable. Taking into account his

disability and the six years already

served, I recommend parole.

MAN

Mr. Bowland, do you regret your

crimes?

RONALD

Yes. I understand now the pain I

caused.

MAN

If released, will you commit these

crimes again?

RONALD

I won't.

MAN

Do you consider yourself ready for

society?

RONALD

Yes.

SHADOW

Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.

RONALD

Absolutely.

MAN

(surprised)

Excuse me, Mr. Rimgale.

SHADOW

Excuse me.

(to Ronald)

What do you do with little girls?

SHADOW

What do you do with them, Ronald?

Huh?

RONALD

(smiles)

-- Burn them.

SHADOW

And old ladies?

RONALD

-- Burn them.

SHADOW

And the world -- the whole world.

RONALD

(smiles)

-- Burn it all.

SHADOW

See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHADOW

(opens trunk)

Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make

yourself useful.

ENGINE LT

We were lucky with this one. Could've

taken out the whole complex, but the

explosion blew out most of the flame.

Good for us.

(looks to body)

-- Not so good for him.

SHADOW

Turn this over.

BRIAN

What do you want me to do with --

SHADOW

-- Shhh.

BRIAN

(after a beat)

What are you listening to?

SHADOW

You sneaky little son of a bitch...

Hide and seek... Come on, tell me

what I want to know...

SHADOW

(business-like into

recorder)

Heavy smoke stains observed in entry

room. Demarkation line high. Fire

never got hot enough here to cook

soot off. It started somewhere else...

(walks down hall)

Less soot here. More heat.

(they enter back room)

And very little soot here.

(to Brian)

Get that couch out of the way.

SHADOW

(to himself)

So you were happy here. Warm and

cozy and in no hurry...

(into recorder)

Soot high, clean unburned wall low,

indicates slow burn in thermal

balance.

(to Brian)

Find me some glass.

BRIAN

Glass?

SHADOW

Do we have a language barrier here?

Glass.

SHADOW

(into recorder)

Glass found in ignition room is in

small, thin pieces, indicating

explosion. Lack of discoloration

indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion

must of come after a slow burn.

(shuts recorder off)

You little tease... What were you up

to you little bastard, huh? What

made you that mad?

(then, an idea)

Or scared.

(switches on recorder)

It started in this room. Took its

time, hung out... but the air ran

out. It couldn't breathe. So it was

snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still

all that trapped heat, lying low,

waiting for some sucker to open the

door and give it that one gulp of

air...

BRIAN

-- Another backdraft.

SHADOW

Finish coat burned away... Severe

spawling of rough coat...

SHADOW

That's our ignition point. Dig it

out. Carefully.

SHADOW

(into recorder)

Temperature in this room was about

2000 degrees, but copper wire in

outlet is melted, which requires

5000 degrees. An accidental short in

the plug could of created a spark of

7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the

wire and start a fire.

BRIAN

No it couldn't.

BRIAN

I mean you'd be right -- with normal

wire. But that's gauge ten in that

plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows

why they put it in here -- but it

won't melt at less than 12,000

degrees. And no natural spark short

of lightning gets that hot.

(Rimgale just stares)

In another life I was in high-end

electronics.

SHADOW

(into recorder)

Have outlet analyzed for any traces

of flammable accelerants.

BRIAN

Don't mention it.

BRIAN

Hey, Tim.

TIM

(distant)

Brian.

SHADOW

(to Brian)

Check the wall for burn patterns.

BRIAN

(to Tim)

So, you surviving without me?

TIM

There's no replacement 'cause of

your boss' cuts, if that's what you

mean. If someone else goes out on an

injury we're really screwed.

BRIAN

Swayzak's not my boss.

GRINDLE

(to Brian)

Ooooh, like the tie. Love the tie.

BRIAN

Grindle, scrape down that wall for

me, huh? I would myself, but the tie

'n all, y'know...

SANTOS

Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for

smoke patterns, there's some good

ones over here.

BRIAN

Yeah? Where?

GRINDLE

(as Brian walks over)

Little to the right... further...

further... Right behind there. Hey,

could you hand me that pike pole?

GRINDLE

Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after

all.

STEPHEN

That's just about enough, guys, okay?

SCHMIDT

See ya around, Brian.

AXE

(to Brian)

What the hell's the matter with you,

huh? You're steppin' in the shit

again. You could've done it. You

don't want this.

(the suit 'n tie)

Wake up, kid.

STEPHEN

Here. Dry yourself off.

STEPHEN

Look, you are sorta making yourself

fair game.

BRIAN

Thanks for the insight.

STEPHEN

Brian, look --

BRIAN

Just leave me alone, okay?

STEPHEN

Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't

get half the shit he's talking about,

but then everybody says the same

thing about me. Who the hell knows?

HELEN

Stephen, what are you doing here?

STEPHEN

Fixing my roof.

HELEN

It's not your roof anymore.

STEPHEN

Where's Sean?

HELEN

He's got piano lessons.

STEPHEN

Oh yeah? How's he doing?

HELEN

He's going to be a fireman.

STEPHEN

Give up, babe. You can't fight it.

Believe me, my mom tried...

HELEN

(beat)

Stephen, you gotta stop just showing

up on the roof like this.

STEPHEN

I just wanted to, I don't know, not

exactly apologize for the other night --

especially since I don't remember

much of it --

HELEN

-- You remember.

STEPHEN

Yeah... I just thought I should say,

I don't know, something.

HELEN

The great communicator.

STEPHEN

Sorry I hit Jackson.

HELEN

He deserved it. He was born deserving

it.

STEPHEN

He treats you okay?

HELEN

Okay.

STEPHEN

I treated you better.

HELEN

You treated me like shit.

HELEN

You want some coffee?

STEPHEN

Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

HELEN

What's wrong, Stephen?

(looks at her)

C'mon, you only beat up the roof

when something's on your mind.

(beat)

How's Brian doing?

STEPHEN

He's out.

HELEN

I know he's out, but how's he doing?

STEPHEN

Y'know, I treated him better than

any other probie I ever had. He

probably hates my guts, but I did

the best thing for him. I made him

finally look in the mirror.

HELEN

Ah Stephen, that's what this is really

about, isn't it? You always have to

be right.

STEPHEN

Hey, I'm the first one to admit when

I'm wrong.

HELEN

Yeah? When was the last time?

STEPHEN

In a fire? Never.

(beat)

Look, I'm his brother. I care about

him, y'know? He was going to get

himself killed. Maybe not today,

maybe not in a year, but it would've

happened. And I couldn't -- I just

couldn't...

HELEN

You can't keep being his father...

STEPHEN

You know what I realized today? I

can't remember my dad's face anymore.

There's pictures of him staring at

me everywhere I go, but the guy behind

them... he's gone...

STEPHEN

I'll see ya around, Helen.

RICCO

Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald

Cosgrove...

RICCO

...Both deaths due to close encounters

with stationary objects; office door

for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for

Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas.

No significant blood toxicology.

Attitude of both trajectories

consistent with explosions.

RICCO

They ran the residue you scraped

from both crispers' front doors.

It's a combination of plumber's putty

and rayophene gum. Burns almost

completely away when you light it.

SHADOW

Putty? On both doors?

RICCO

There's something else kinda

interesting...

RICCO

See this?

RICCO

Guess he didn't leave home without

it.

RICCO

Anyway, down here, take a look...

SHADOW

McCaffrey, hold this for us.

BRIAN

Uh, I don't think that's in my

contract...

SHADOW

I just re-wrote your contract.

C'mere...

RICCO

Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to

sell you insurance, lift him.

RICCO

(to Rimgale)

See that patch of shirt? We wondered

about the discoloration so he ran a

spectro. On a lucky shot we picked

up some traces of Trychticholorate.

Nobody around here had ever heard of

it.

SHADOW

Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an

absorption catalyst in toxic waste

accidents. It's pretty rare, they

stopped making it a couple'a years

ago.

RICCO

Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes

in a gas state from the fire.

SHADOW

What the hell was it doing in the

fire?

RICCO

That's your job.

SHADOW

I asked you to hold him, not feel

him up...

SHADOW

Read.

BRIAN

"Trychtichlorate is a binary

structured --"

SHADOW

-- Go to the bottom. Under heat

properties.

BRIAN

"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin

or higher, Trych breaks down and

dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

SHADOW

Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot

it takes water molecules and BAMM!

SHADOW

Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just

to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take

much at all to melt ten gauge wire.

Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a

powder trace -- unless you could

find something that would eat its

residue.

BRIAN

Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can

announce Seagrave was a murder.

SHADOW

Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone

may have put the chemical in the

outlet, but we found it as a vapor

in Cosgrove's clothes.

BRIAN

And the putty around the door?

SHADOW

Even if it was used to seal the air

off, that doesn't explain why someone

would go to the trouble of a

backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot

easier

BRIAN

But the right guess on this is arson.

SHADOW

I don't guess.

BRIAN

Some people say you don't do much of

anything when it comes to this case.

SHADOW

I don't work for them, either.

BRIAN

Arson.

JENNIFER

Straightest answer your department's

given me all week.

BRIAN

Hey.

JENNIFER

How's it going?

BRIAN

Boss and I are up to about three

words an hour.

JENNIFER

(to secretary)

Green committed to a thousand.

(to Brian)

There's another fund-raising party

tonight. Marty'd really like you to

come.

BRIAN

I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.

JENNIFER

I could use a date.

BRIAN

Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...

RIMGALE'S VOICE

McCaffrey! Come here!

BRIAN

(into phone)

Call ya back.

SHADOW

Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it

off.

BRIAN

Jesus!

SHADOW

That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch,

he's different, goddamn it! You see

what this tells us, huh? Our killer

doesn't love fire!

BRIAN

What?

SHADOW

(pulls out file)

I got it after we talked to Ronald.

Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn

world. But the fires that killed

those guys never really burned up

much. -- The burns were all lit in

outlets surrounded by double

firebreaks in the walls. And he made

his burns backdrafts.

([p. 78])

BRIAN

But he killed these guys.

SHADOW

But he could have killed everybody

there. The firebreaks kept it from

spreading in the wall. The backdraft

blew out the flame. That's it. That's

the reason.

BRIAN

What reason?

SHADOW

Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave

and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot

of trouble to make sure they died by

fire, but also made sure the fire

blew itself out.

BRIAN

That's why the sealant on the doors...

So what have we got, a torch with a

conscience?

SHADOW

No, we have a stone killer trying to

make a point.

BRIAN

Are you going public with this?

SHADOW

No. Do that and I guarantee you'll

scare him off. I don't want him

running away.

JENNIFER

Hi.

BRIAN

(eyes on Swayzak)

Hey...

(beat)

So are you dating your boss or what?

JENNIFER

If you weren't at least the 300th

person to ask me that, I'd probably

be pissed.

(beat, sighs)

Boy, you sure know it's a man's world

sometimes...

BRIAN

Sorry.

(beat)

Are you dating anyone?

JENNIFER

You think that's really any of your

business?

BRIAN

Well, you did invite me here.

JENNIFER

Marty did.

(beat, smiles)

But I wanted you to come to.

SWAYZAK

Mr. McCaffrey...

BRIAN

Nice boat.

SWAYZAK

It isn't mine.

(to photographer)

Let's get a picture.

SWAYZAK

(seeing someone else)

Larry!

(sotto to Jennifer)

What does he do again?

JENNIFER

How's the job going?

BRIAN

Okay.

JENNIFER

Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail,

isn't he?

BRIAN

No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's

not a dummy, though. He's juggling

alot of balls on this one.

JENNIFER

Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert

Einstein just to figure out if these

guys were killed by accidents or

not.

BRIAN

Jesus, give him a break. There isn't

enough proof yet to go public. Sure,

we found some chemical shit we think

somebody dumped in the plugs to torch

'em, and we've maybe figured out why

backdrafts, but you can't rush this

stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

JENNIFER

But Rimgale's probably going to come

around to arson.

BRIAN

In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.

JENNIFER

Save me.

BRIAN

Thanks for the invite.

JENNIFER

Got anything to drink in there?

BRIAN

Oh, there might be something stashed

away for emergencies.

BRIAN

This is one of the oldest fire

stations in the city. Lotta tradition

locked up in here. What do you think?

JENNIFER

Homey.

BRIAN

See that trap door up there? That

used to lead to the hay loft when

they had horse-drawn engines. It was

pretty different then... but kinda

the same, y'know?

JENNIFER

Do you miss it?

(he doesn't answer)

You seem like you do.

BRIAN

When I came back, I knew more than

anything else that I wanted to be a

fireman.

JENNIFER

Then why did you quit?

BRIAN

I wanted to be a good one.

BRIAN

Old firehouse trick.

JENNIFER

So show me your fire truck.

BRIAN

Well, our specimen here is your basic

standard issue piece of primary

suppression equipment. This area is

the pumping panel, which controls

the rate of liquid insertion into

the hose.

JENNIFER

Uh huh.

BRIAN

This is a six inch playpipe, cast

bronze to keep it firm during hard

flows.

(picks up another

item)

This is our pipe extender, used in

forward lays...

(moves on)

This is our hard suction line... Our

adjustable insertion nozzle...

(comes around back of

trunk)

...And this is the hose bed.

CUT TO:

GRINDLE

Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill

yourself at least wait till the fire,

it's better P.R.

JENNIFER

Tell me about the playpipe again...

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

Where is it?

SECURITY GUARD

Don't know. There's alarms going off

on three different floors.

STEPHEN

Wonderful.

TIM

How do we know if the floor's going

to be on fire?

STEPHEN

If the doors open and it's hot, don't

get out.

STEPHEN

It's here.

GRINDLE

These high-rise gigs give me the

creeps.

AXE

Let's wait for a back-up, Stephen.

We're early on this one, it hasn't

even broke out yet. We're one short

as it is with Brian gone.

STEPHEN

Want to learn something?

TIM

Yes sir!

STEPHEN

Adcox, go with Pengelly and check

the other side.

AXE

It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin'

us up. Not with this one.

STEPHEN

-- What the hell's the matter with

you? You always check the other side.

I haven't got time for bullshit right

now, okay? We got a job here.

AXE

Let me take the lead, Stephen...

STEPHEN

Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking

job!

STEPHEN

(like a mantra)

Oh, you're so very sly, but so am

I...

(to Tim)

...Listen to it... you can tell when

a wall cracks which way it's gonna

jump... you can hear the doors breathe

if they're hot...

JENNIFER

What's going on?

JENNIFER

What are they doing?

BRIAN

Excuse us.

STEPHEN

(to Tim)

Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling...

that means it's hiding... staying

sleepy... one of these doors...

STEPHEN

(to himself)

Easy... no hurry... you're not going

anywhere...

STEPHEN

Did you check the door for heat,

Tim?

STEPHEN

Tim?

STEPHEN

Tim!

AXE

Oh God! Oh God no!

STEPHEN

Hey, Stevie.

BRIAN

Is he...

AXE

He's alive.

BRIAN

Do they think he'll pull through?

GRINDLE

They're not saying.

BRIAN

I should have been there.

NIGHTENGALE

None of us should have been there,

Brian.

BRIAN

You had to do it, didn't you?

STEPHEN

...Not now, Brian.

BRIAN

Had to take on another fire bare-

handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth

man in there instead of looking out

for your probie. Is that what

happened? Is it, Stephen?

STEPHEN

I had that fire. He didn't listen!

BRIAN

He didn't listen? He was a fucking

candidate! He was your responsibility.

He shouldn't have been there in the

first place, Stephen.

(beat)

You burned him.

STEPHEN

Fuck you.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHADOW

Goes on about how the break was made

through the discovery of "chemical

traces" and a "behavioral link". Oh,

and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief

investigator is closing in on the

torch and expects an arrest "any

time".

SHADOW

Get your stuff and get out.

JENNIFER

(surprised)

Brian. What's wrong?

BRIAN

You told Swayzak about our arson

lead. It's all over the fucking news.

JENNIFER

I didn't know it was a secret. There

aren't supposed to be secrets between

the city and its investigators --

BRIAN

-- Bullshit! You knew what I told

you wasn't ready for the papers --

JENNIFER

Will you please keep your voice down,

there's people --

BRIAN

-- You could have scared the son of

a bitch off. We may never bust him

now. All for a couple's political

points.

JENNIFER

I was doing my job.

BRIAN

(grabs her arm)

Yeah? And just how much of all this

has been "doing your job"?

JENNIFER

(shakes it off)

Let me ask you something, do you

really think Marty had you assigned

to arson because of your firefighting

skills? Who the hell are you kidding?

I was there, remember? I saw you and

your brother --

BRIAN

Leave Stephen out of this --

JENNIFER

Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.

(beat)

Who are you? Just another probie

working for Swayzak --

BRIAN

-- I work for the city.

JENNIFER

You knew what we were asking you to

do. Don't suddenly pull out a

conscience now. The fit isn't right.

SWAYZAK

Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

BRIAN

Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a

letter to the Times explaining how

yesterday's arson announcement was a

fabrication by your office. They

loved it. And you know what? You

were right, my family background in

firefighting gave it weight.

JENNIFER

Oh Brian...

STEPHEN

He's gonna live. Maybe not much else,

but he's gonna live...

SWAYZAK

Inspector.

SHADOW

Alderman.

SHADOW

I usually have breakfast first.

SWAYZAK

When are you going to catch the prick

that's doing this, Don?

SHADOW

"Don?"

SWAYZAK

Don't you have any leads at all?

SHADOW

No Marty, I don't.

SHADOW

We still haven't found a connection

between the victims.

SWAYZAK

Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave,

Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried

in a goddamn high-rise!

SHADOW

Holcomb? I didn't know the name of

that victim had even been released

yet.

SHADOW

Is there a connection between them,

Alderman?

SWAYZAK

Just catch the son of a bitch.

SHADOW

What the hell are you doing here?

BRIAN

I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do

whatever you want me to do. I just

want to help catch the guy that burned

Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

CUT TO:

SHADOW

I thought 'ol Marty was acting a

little strange... And he's right.

BRIAN

Backdraft?

SHADOW

The backdraft was set somewhere in

there. It fried Holcomb when he opened

the inner door. But the outer door

held... and waited for Tim...

SHADOW

So find me the fire.

SHADOW

You're thinking too much of the

building and not enough of the ghost.

SHADOW

In a word, Brian, what is this job

all about?

BRIAN

Fire.

SHADOW

It's a living thing, Brian. It

breathes, it eats, and it hates.

SHADOW

The only way to beat it is to think

like it. To know that this flame

will spread this way across the floor

not because of the physics of

flammable liquids or heat convection,

but because it wants to.

SHADOW

Some guys on this job, fire owns

them. It makes them fight on its

level. But the only way to truly

kill it is to love it a little, just

like Ronald.

VOICE

What the hell are you guys doin'?

SHADOW

We're the fire department, lady.

WOMAN

Well color me stupid, I always thought

the fire dept. put out fires.

SHADOW

(to woman)

You work here?

WOMAN

Till yesterday. What do you think

the odds are that a non-refundable

ticket to Paris survived this?

BRIAN

Somewhere between zero and no way.

WOMAN

Shit. What a mess.

SHADOW

You seem real broken up about Mr.

Holcomb.

WOMAN

Jeff Holcomb? The Darth Vader of tax

accountants? He was a sleezeball.

Hopefully a sleezeball that carried

some insurance.

BRIAN

Go talk to the building owner.

WOMAN

He was the building owner.

BRIAN

Our book lists the owner as Dekom

Trust.

WOMAN

Don't investigators come in adult

size?

GRINDLE

Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.

STEPHEN

I'm busy.

GRINDLE

He just wants to --

STEPHEN

-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

STEPHEN

What, they don't knock on your planet?

SHADOW

I still haven't gotten your fire

report, Stevie. On Tim.

STEPHEN

I'm working on it.

SHADOW

I deal with this stuff every day.

But a fireman... you never get used

to it.

(beat)

What happened up there? He was a

candidate. Did he pay attention? Was

he listening?

STEPHEN

...He wasn't listening to the right

thing...

SHADOW

What do you listen to, Stephen?

STEPHEN

You don't know... nobody knows...

SHADOW

I might.

STEPHEN

It knows us. This one knows us.

SHADOW

(beat)

I need that report, Lt.

STEPHEN

Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he-

doesn't-have-a-face.

BRIAN

(trying to hold it

together in his mind)

Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by

Pan Illinois... which is majority

controlled by Lakeside Dynamics...

which is a division of Windy City

Ventures... who's partners are...

(beat)

Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and

Jeffrey Holcomb.

SHADOW

Son of a bitch. They knew each other.

CUT TO:

BRIAN

So Seagrave and Holcomb were

accountants...

SHADOW

And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he

laundered money for the mob before

getting into real estate. They weren't

very high on Seagrave, either.

BRIAN

Nice bunch of guys.

SHADOW

Who all ended up wearing candles for

faces...

(beat)

Swayzak's up to his ass in this

somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink

in his hand, he's so scared.

SHADOW

We need to get a look at his files.

JENNIFER

Hi.

BRIAN

Hi.

JENNIFER

We still talking?

(beat)

Look, I'm sorry about the other day --

BRIAN

Swayzak knows something about the

guys that were murdered. I want to

know why he keeps that hidden.

JENNIFER

I don't know anything about it.

BRIAN

You could check. It'd be in his files.

JENNIFER

(beat)

Do you know what you're asking me to

do?

BRIAN

Yes.

JENNIFER

Y'know, four years ago I was working

in a bakery. Two years ago I was

bringing Marty coffee and he didn't

even know my name. I run that office

now. Marty believed in me and I

believe in him. You want me to just

throw that away?

BRIAN

Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

HELEN

Stephen?

STEPHEN

I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...

HELEN

What's wrong?

STEPHEN

I...

(beat)

It used to be, when I was a kid,

what meant most to me about this job

was there were no ifs. Life and death,

right and wrong. When someone called

the fire department, we came... Those

guys don't know how much I love

them... You don't leave people

hanging... cause that's what it's

all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till

death do us part. Isn't that what

you heard?... It's you go, we go...

Cause without that, it's the end of

families, it's the end of the fire

department... and when the fire

department stops coming... that's

the end of the fucking world...

(beat)

I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just...

it's just there's nobody I can talk

to...

(beat)

I miss you.

STEPHEN

Cook and I are almost finished here.

Have a seat.

HELEN

Stephen... I... can I talk to you a

second...

STEPHEN

Look, I'm sorry I --

HELEN

-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

STEPHEN

-- He's gettin' good on those eggs.

And y'know, he told me he actually

likes the piano.

HELEN

I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.

HELEN

It's... It's just things have

changed... you're the same, Stephen,

but things are different now... you've

got a son... you're the best at what

you do Stephen, you always were, but

you scare me now...

STEPHEN

(to Sean)

Hey... Sean-man, your dad blew it. I

forgot I had to work this morning...

SEAN

Aw dad, c'mon...

STEPHEN

Next time, huh? We'll do it up big.

Promise.

SEAN

Okay.

(then sotto)

Mom's crying, dad.

JENNIFER

(holding print-out)

Latest polls came in, Marty.

(he doesn't answer)

Marty?

JENNIFER

Jesus Christ, Marty, what's going

on?

SWAYZAK

Leave me alone.

JENNIFER

We've come a long way together, Marty.

I've staked my whole career on you.

And now you're sneaking around this

office, leaking things to the papers

behind my back...

(beat)

Is there something you're not telling

me about these deaths?

SWAYZAK

No.

BRIAN

Jennifer?

BRIAN

What is --

JENNIFER

Just take it.

BRIAN

I'm sorry.

JENNIFER

That's a dumb thing to say.

BRIAN

You're right.

JENNIFER

Goodbye, Brian.

REPAIRMAN

What the hell do you do with this

thing?

SHADOW

This is the copy of Swayzak's manning

report that was released. Everybody

on this job knows it's bullshit but

we could never argue with the numbers.

They're all airtight.

BRIAN

Yeah? Airtight?

BRIAN

I've got three different drafts of

the same report -- with different

numbers that're all over the place.

Looks like they were just making it

up as they went along.

SHADOW

Did a little check on the consulting

firm that wrote the report. They did

exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower

study. It's not even really a company.

No employees, no directors, just a

PO Box.

BRIAN

Then who wrote the report?

SHADOW

It had to be someone who knows

numbers. Some kind of fancy

accountant. But what's the connection?

SHADOW

I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us

had a little heart to heart talk.

SHADOW

Hello? Swayzak?

SHADOW

Uh... I sorta got a problem here...

SHADOW

Well Brian, I guess you can say it's

arson now...

BRIAN

How ya feeling?

BRIAN

Did you pull me out?

SHADOW

Yeah.

BRIAN

Did I say thanks?

SHADOW

No.

BRIAN

Just wondering.

SHADOW

I hate hospitals. You're so... so

goddamn useless...

BRIAN

So what do you want me to do?

SHADOW

I've been lying here hours... just

thinking... We're close...

(beat)

We're not looking in the right place,

Brian. This one knows us and we're

not looking in the right place...

RONALD

Well, Mr. Life magazine. Come all

this way just to say hi?

BRIAN

I'm close... but I can't get who it

is...

RONALD

So you came to me...

(smiles)

Well, this is going to be an

interesting afternoon after all...

DISSOLVE TO:

RONALD

Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you

a story, you tell me one. Fair?

BRIAN

Who's doing this?

RONALD

Your first question should be who

isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not

enough damage. And an insurance pro?

Where's the profit margin?

BRIAN

Then who --

RONALD

-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.

BRIAN

I don't have a story.

RONALD

Sure you do.

RONALD

Famous story even. Straight burn.

Just an engine and truck first on

scene. What did you feel, Brian,

when you first got there?

BRIAN

What?

RONALD

You gotta tell a story too, Brian.

It's fair. C'mon, don't think too

hard --

BRIAN

I... I thought it was great. I loved

it. It was nothing to these guys...

medium deal.

RONALD

Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a

civilians hollering -- medium deal.

So young fireman Adcox and Captain

McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get

out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey

does the ballsy jump across... what

were you feeling, Brian?

(Brian doesn't answer)

C'mon, you promised. Be honest.

(Brian just stares)

Okay... Guard!

BRIAN

-- I wanted to be him. Right then I

wanted to be him more than anything...

RONALD

(smiles)

Very good, Brian. -- About your report

here. The way to a torch's heart is

through his tools. That's how you

know him. It's the way he talks to

the fire. And to you if you listen.

BRIAN

The outlets.

RONALD

That's a probie answer. You're smarter

than that, Brian.

BRIAN

Trychticholorate.

RONALD

Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox

and McCaffrey, they go back inside.

Only there's another fire in there

nobody sees. And it took your dad,

didn't it Brian? Did you see him

burn?

BRIAN

Who the fuck is doing this?

RONALD

After it took your dad... the fire...

did it look at you Brian? Did it

talk to you?...

RONALD

You see, our world's aren't so

different...

BRIAN

(quiet)

Who's doing this?

RONALD

Think, Brian. Who doesn't love fire,

but knows it better than anyone else?

Who's around trychticholorate 24

hours a day?

BRIAN

Oh Jesus Christ...

RONALD

Not such a far walk after all, is

it, Brian?

BRIAN

Oh goddamn it Stephen...

STEPHEN

Hey, what are you doing here?

BRIAN

Just... Just wanted to say hello...

STEPHEN

So hello.

STEPHEN

Well, long as you're here you can

help clean up a little. I've got a

guy coming to look at this in a few

minutes.

BRIAN

You're selling dad's boat?

STEPHEN

Yeah, it's just another memory in my

life right now. And I got way too

many of them...

BRIAN

I really should get back. There's...

there's something I'm supposed to

do.

STEPHEN

Yeah? What have you got to do?

(beat)

Look at you. Look at your face. All

the things you must be thinking.

Man, you must really hate my guts.

Well, you know what? It's okay.

BRIAN

Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk

about this some other --

STEPHEN

-- Okay, so you don't like me. You

don't like everything I've done.

What, because I wasn't such a genius

the way I raised you? Jesus Christ,

dad was gone, what was I supposed to

do? You tell me, what the fuck was I

supposed to do?!

BRIAN

It's okay, Stephen, I --

STEPHEN

-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I

don't have all the answers, but

goddamn it, I've got some.

(beat)

Look, you're gonna do what you have

to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten

in the way. I'm your brother, not

your father. Go on. You gotta go

somewhere? Go...

BRIAN

I saw it.

STEPHEN

Saw what?

BRIAN

When dad died, I saw another fire...

STEPHEN

Everybody did.

BRIAN

I saw it before it got them. I tried

to yell, but... He asked me to look

out for him. And I didn't do it. I

let him die.

STEPHEN

(stunned)

...Jesus, you been carrying that

around for twenty years? For christ's

sake, you were seven years old! You

think he could have heard you in

there?

BRIAN

I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen.

You don't know how hard it was for

me to put that uniform on...

STEPHEN

Maybe I do.

(sighs)

...What a fuckin' mess, huh?

(beat)

People can change Brian.

BRIAN

Sometimes right when you're looking

at them.

BRIAN

Oh God, Stephen, what's going on

with you?

STEPHEN

I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

BRIAN

(breathless)

-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta

talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

STEPHEN

-- What are you doing here?

BRIAN

I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn!

I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen,

he's been killing people!

STEPHEN

I know.

BRIAN

How do you know?

STEPHEN

I knew when you came looking for the

chemicals. Looking for me.

BRIAN

-- What were they doing there?

STEPHEN

They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

GRINDLE

We gotta roll, Stevie...

STEPHEN

I'll be there.

GRINDLE

They're waitin' man.

STEPHEN

I'll be there, goddamn it!

STEPHEN

(to Brian)

Anything else?

BRIAN

What are we going to do about this?

STEPHEN

I'll handle it.

BRIAN

We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

STEPHEN

I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility.

I'll handle it. Me.

BRIAN

Oh, Christ. Stephen...

BRIAN

Where are they? Where's 17?

CAPTAIN

On the roof.

BRIAN

Stephen --

STEPHEN

Brian?

AXE

Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

STEPHEN

-- What the fuck were you thinking,

huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

AXE

They were killing firemen, man. When

Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's

files... They were my friends, I had

to do it. I had to do it for the

department.

BRIAN

Did you do it for Tim?

AXE

(pain, to Stephen)

That was an accident! Jesus Christ,

why did you have to go in there so

fucking early? Why didn't you listen

to me!

AXE

You gotta let me finish --

BRIAN

Just come down, John. Just --

AXE

-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking

puke if he saw how you've shit on

his department!

STEPHEN

-- Knock it off!

AXE

(to Stephen)

-- You can't let him turn you against

your friends, man --

BRIAN

-- He killed people --

AXE

-- You know what Swayzak would do to

the department if this got out? --

BRIAN

-- Stephen, this is bullshit --

AXE

-- What he would do to your dad's

department? You gotta let me finish

it --

BRIAN

You're his Lt., Stephen...

(beat)

Are you gonna handle it? Are you

Stephen?

STEPHEN

Shut up!

AXE

...What do you want me to do, Stephen?

Talk to me. What am I supposed to

do?

STEPHEN

(beat)

There's a fire. We've got a job here.

Let's get on with it.

GRINDLE

Shit... It's going! Clear the roof!

Now!

STEPHEN

Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn

it!

STEPHEN

You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't

you stay behind a desk where you

belong?

BRIAN

"You never know till the fire stares

you down if you're gonna be --"

STEPHEN

Oh shut up, huh?

(grimaces)

I think I broke my goddamn arm...

STEPHEN

You stupid son of a bitch! What the

fuck are you doing!

AXE

Stevie... I...

STEPHEN

Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!

AXE

I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

BRIAN

Stephen!

STEPHEN

You go, we go.

BRIAN

NO!

BRIAN

You're gonna be all right, man.

BRIAN

Hey! Over here!

STEPHEN

Wait for another hose team...

STEPHEN

Wait for the goddamn hose team!

BRIAN

No... No more.

STEPHEN

That's my brother! That's my brother

goddamn it!

BRIAN

Another time, friend.

STEPHEN

(smiles, weak)

You are such a pain in the ass...

CUT TO:

STEPHEN

Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't

let 'em...

BRIAN

I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought...

I won't.

PARAMEDIC

(reading EKG)

Oh shit, give him some lidocaine,

now. Now.

STEPHEN

(beat)

Who's your brother?

PARAMEDIC

His pressure's fading -- push some

adrenalin.

BRIAN

Oh man, don't you die... Don't you

die...

PARAMEDIC #2

He's going south... He's gonna box

damn it...

BRIAN

Goddamn it don't you die now... Not

now!

PARAMEDIC

V-fib!

SHADOW

In the Chicago Fire Department the

alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the

company has returned home to quarters.

We will now ring out that code to

welcome home John Adcox and Stephen

McCaffrey...

DISSOLVE TO:

SHADOW

Your brother was a good man.

BRIAN

Yeah.

SHADOW

Another couple of good men get burned

up for their city? Is that how it's

going to read?

(Brian doesn't answer)

You're the only one that knows.

BRIAN

Like it never happened...

SHADOW

Want to help me with something?

SHADOW

Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?

SWAYZAK

(confused)

Investigator...

SWAYZAK

I'm a little busy right now --

SHADOW

This'll only take a minute. There's

two cops outside that want to ask

you about this --

SHADOW

This is just a guess of course, but

I think they're gonna want to know

why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove,

Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to

create a phony manpower study.

(to cameras)

You guys'll wait, right?

BRIAN

See that glow flashing in the corner

of your eye? That's your career

dissipation light. And it just went

into high gear.

SHADOW

-- Brian.

SHADOW

Don't keep looking over your shoulder

for the ghost. It's gone now.

BRIAN

I think your boss is going to need

some spin control.

JENNIFER

I quit two days ago, Brian.

BRIAN

What'll you do?

JENNIFER

I don't have the slightest idea...

BRIAN

I'll see ya around, huh?

JENNIFER

It's a small town.

You're doing it wrong.
