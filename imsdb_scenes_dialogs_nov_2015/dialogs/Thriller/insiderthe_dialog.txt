THE SHEIKH

Coffee?

LOWELL

Yeah...  Thank you.

THE SHEIKH

How have you liked your stay?

LOWELL

(droll)

What I've

seen

...I've liked.

THE SHEIKH

Please to explain, why I should agree to

interview...with pro-Zionist American

media?

LOWELL

Because I think Hezbollah is trying to

broaden into a political party right now.

So you care about what you're thought of

in America.  And in America, at this

moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a

face.

(confident)

That's why.

THE SHEIKH

Perhaps you

prove

journalism

objectivity

and I see the questions first.  Then I

decide if I grant the interview.

LOWELL

(blunt)

No.  We don't do that.

(beat)

You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike

Wallace.  So you know our reputation for

integrity and objectivity.  You also know

we are the highest-rated, most-respected,

TV-magazine news show in America.

LOWELL (cont'd)

So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a

plane or not?

THE SHEIKH

Tell him I will see him day after

tomorrow.

LOWELL

That's good.  That works.

(after a beat)

Uh, you know, I want to ask you

something...I know it sounds odd...but...

LOWELL (CONT'D)

Hello, Sheikh...?

(no answer)

Hello, Sheikh...?

LOWELL (CONT'D)

Norman.

NORMAN

What?  What?

LOWELL

Take your blindfold off.

LOWELL (CONT'D)

(sarcastic)

Welcome to the world.

NORMAN

Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere

we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable

gennies and we'll run cable...

MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)

Hello?

LOWELL

(into phone)

Mike, it's me.  We're on...

WIGAND

Hi, honey.

BARBARA

Hi, Daddy.

WIGAND

What's new?

BARBARA

Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.

WIGAND

Yeah?  What for?

BARBARA

For reading.

WIGAND

That's great...  Little early for

cartoons, isn't it?

BARBARA

Okay.

BARBARA (cont'd)

Deborah?  Debbie?

LIANE

Oh, I didn't know you were home...  It's

early...  Isn't it?

LIANE (CONT'D)

Gotta take Debbie to ballet...

BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)

Mommy!

WIGAND

Sweetheart, c'mon.  C'mon.

BARBARA

She was playing with my Pooh doll

again...

WIGAND

Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.

Breathe deep.  Breathe deep.  Slow down,

honey.  Slow down.  Slow down.

WIGAND (cont'd)

Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths.

BARBARA

She was playing with the Pooh doll.

WIGAND

Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty,

and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's

- what's happening to you now is... cells

called mast cells told your lungs "don't

breathe any more of that dust in."

(beat)

...and the airways in your lungs are like

branches.  And when the branches close

up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we

give you medicine, and you get better.

Huh?  Okay?  You're better already,

aren't you?

WIGAND (cont'd)

Okay, baby?

DEBORAH

Can I go to dance

tomorrow

?  I'm

better...

LIANE

...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to

soccer and take you to dance after...

WIGAND

I can take her.

LIANE

Don't you have to be at the office?

WIGAND

(instead, getting up)

Is there any more rice...?

LIANE

(nods)

Yes, it's on the stove...

LIANE (cont'd)

Do you want more rice?

DEBORAH

Maybe later.

LIANE

How about you?

BARBARA

I'll take some.

WIGAND

Instant rice...?

BARBARA

Can I go over to Janeane's house?

LIANE

I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my

coffee mug...?

WIGAND

Try the car.

LIANE

Uh, what are those boxes?

WIGAND

I'm going to the store.  You need

anything?

LIANE

What do you need at the store?

WIGAND

Soy sauce...

LIANE

Right now?

WIGAND

(meaning in the car)

That's my stuff from the office...

LIANE

Why did you take your stuff from the

office?

WIGAND

(simply)

I didn't want to leave it there...

LIANE

(confused)

I don't understand.

WIGAND

(matter of fact)

I got fired this morning...  Where else

am I gonna take it?

LIANE

Why?  Who said?

WIGAND

(specifically)

Thomas Sandefur...

LIANE

(stunned, fearful)

What are we supposed to do...?  What

about our medical coverage; what about

our health?  What about our car payments?

The payments on this house?

WIGAND

(a beat, specific)

There's a severance agreement...  It

includes cash payouts over time and

continuing medical coverage...

(beat)

Sure you don't need anything?

LIANE

No, thank you.

he

is, how he must be feeling, and she turns

LIANE (cont'd)

Jeffrey...!

THE SHEIKH

I am very pleased to receive you as my

guest, Mr. Wallace.

MIKE WALLACE

Thank you for having us...

NORMAN

I think I've got a problem with the

gennie.  I have to go outside.

LOWELL

(going outside)

Norman...?

INTERPRETER

He says you must not sit so close.

MIKE WALLACE

What?

(re:  Bodyguard)

I can't conduct an interview from back

there.

INTERPRETER

You must move back your chair.

MIKE WALLACE

Will you tell him that when I conduct an

interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!

INTERPRETER

There is no interview.

MIKE WALLACE

You!  I'm talking to you!

MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)

What the hell do you think I am?  A 78-

year-old assassin?  You think I'm gonna

karate him to death with this notepad?

(to Interpreter)

Are you interpreting what I'm saying?

INTERPRETER

Yes.

LOWELL

We're there.

MIKE WALLACE

Good, well ask him if Arabic is his

second language.

LOWELL

(to Interpreter)

Don't interpret that!

(to both)

Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it!  Slow,

slow

!!

(to the Sheikh)

Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just

turn your chair a little bit to face Mr.

Wallace?

LOWELL (cont'd)

Is that okay?

INTERPRETER

Okay.

LOWELL

(Bodyguard assents; to Mike)

Are you ready?  Or you want to keep

fucking around and warm up some more...?

MIKE WALLACE

No.

(wry)

...that's got my heart started.

LOWELL

Alright, Todd, give me the three-button

on Mike, please.  Okay.  We are rolling.

Okay, Mike.

MIKE WALLACE

(charming)

Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so

much

for

seeing us.

(changes)

Are you a terrorist?

THE SHEIKH

Mr. Wallace, I...am a servant of God.

MIKE WALLACE

A servant of God?  Really...

MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

Americans believe that

you

, as an Islamic

fundamentalist, that

you

are a leader who

contributed to the bombing of the U.S.

Embassy.

these

questions in

this

The New York Times,

, are spread

LOWELL

...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties

ride horses and rescue ladies from

rapids, Mike.  They backed locals in Oka

in a fight with Mohawks over building a

golf course on their burial site.  They

beat up protesters at Kanasake...

(pause)

Where'd you hear that?

LOWELL (cont'd)

(droll)

Oh, someone took a poll?  "Are all things

Canadian boring...?"

SHARON

(to Lowell)

It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City...

LOWELL

Let me call you back...

LOWELL (CONT'D)

Yeah, Stuart...  What New York bank?

JAKE

Hey Dad...Sharon...

SHARON

(to Jake)

No classes this morning?

LOWELL

Will he go on-camera and talk about the

Mexico City branch?

JAKE

I don't have to be there until ten-

thirty.

JOSIAH

Hi Mom, Lowell...

SHARON

Hi, sweetheart...

LOWELL

(into phone)

Will independent sources corroborate

that?

SHARON

Hello?  Yeah...

LOWELL'S SON

(shouts back inside)

Dad, you got a box out here...

LOWELL

(looking at her itinerary)

Let me see this...  No, 'cause I gotta

know where you're going at all times.

SHARON

(into phone)

I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston

tomorrow.

SHARON (CONT'D)

Two p.m.  Great.  Bye-bye.

(hangs up)

LOWELL

(reading)

..."ignition propensity?"

(to Sharon)

...you understand any of this...?

SHARON

...no...this looks like a table of

temperatures...  Who's this from?

LOWELL

(shrugs)

...it's anonymous.  References to "P.M."

(motions)

It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?

SHARON

I have to take a shower.

LOWELL

Yeah.

DOUG OLIVER

(into phone)

Hi, this is Doug Oliver...

LOWELL

Oh, hi, Doug...it's Lowell.  I'm doing

this story on fire safety...  People

burning up from falling asleep smoking.

I received a shitload of scientific

papers from inside Philip Morris...

Anonymous.  You or anybody in FDA know

someone who can translate this stuff into

English for me?

DOUG OLIVER

(beat)

...uh, yeah...

LOWELL

Mr. Wigand, please.

LOWELL (cont'd)

Thank you, Bob.

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

Who's calling?

LOWELL

My name's Lowell Bergman...  I'm --

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

Did you say Berman?

LOWELL

No, Bergman...B.E.R.G.M.A.N....  I'm a

producer with "60 Minutes"...

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

"60 Minutes"?

LOWELL

Yeah.

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

"60 Minutes," the television show?

LOWELL

Yes.

LIANE

(on phone)

He doesn't want to talk to you.

LOWELL

How does he know he doesn't want to talk

to me?  He doesn't know what I'm calling

him about...

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

He doesn't care to know.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(on the machine)

This is Lowell Bergman with "60

Minutes"...  I'm doing a story on fire

safety and cigarettes...  I have

scientific documents from a tobacco

company, and I could use your help as a

consultant explaining these documents to

me...  My number is area code 510-555-

0199...  I'll be there, at this number,

in 10 minutes.

LOWELL

If you're curious to meet me...

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(on machine)

...I'm gonna be in the lobby of the

Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading

The

New York Times

, tomorrow, at five

o'clock...

New York Times

, waiting...  And instead of looking up every

LOWELL (OVER)

Have you always lived in Louisville?

WIGAND

Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to

consult about?

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(turns, suspicious)

Who's that?

LOWELL

(wry)

That's room service.  They usually knock

first.

(calls)

Come on in...  Over here, please.

LOWELL (cont'd)

Thank you.

LOWELL (CONT'D)

(pouring)

How do you like your coffee?  Black?

WIGAND

Black, black...

WIGAND (CONT'D)

Look, I really don't have that much

time...

LOWELL

(nods)

Is there anything you want to know about

me, Mr. Wigand...?

WIGAND

Like what?  Your sign?

WIGAND (CONT'D)

I know what I have to know.

LOWELL

Just so I know you know, when I talk to

people in confidence, it stays that way.

WIGAND

(abruptly)

How did a radical journalist from

Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?

LOWELL

I still do the tough stories.  "60

Minutes" reaches a lot of people.

WIGAND

(after a beat)

Let me see the documents...

WIGAND (CONT'D)

...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study

for Philip Morris.  Burn rates...ignition

propensity...things of this nature.

(after a beat)

I could very easily explain this to you

in layman's terms, because it's from

another company...

WIGAND (cont'd)

...but that's as far as I go...

LOWELL

Far as you go where?

WIGAND

(a beat)

This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I

can talk to you about what's in here.

But I can't talk to you about anything

else.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(meaning Philip Morris

documents)

I signed a confidentiality agreement.  I

honor agreements...

WIGAND (CONT'D)

Doesn't CBS have confidentiality

agreements, Mr. Bergman?

LOWELL

Between journalists and management, yes,

I believe they do...but I don't take that

seriously.

(after a beat)

Where do you work?

WIGAND

Did work.

LOWELL

(fast)

Did work.

WIGAND

(the bottom line)

How much would I get paid?

LOWELL

That, you have to discuss with CBS

Business Affairs.  But, for something

like this, I would say anywhere between

10, 12 thousand.

WIGAND

Should I just take the documents now?

LOWELL

If you want to do it.

WIGAND

I worked as the head of Research and

Development for Brown & Williamson

Tobacco Company.  I was a Corporate Vice

President.  Mr. Bergman...

MIKE WALLACE

(on screen)

"President Assad of Syria said that

difficult obstacles remain but that his

country, quote, 'looks forward to a

great, long peace with Israel.'"

DON HEWITT

(kissing Mike)

It's a Peabody, Mike.  When you're dead

and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're

gonna remember you for...

LOWELL

(to his Editor)

...come in earlier on Mike's Marine

barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh

Mussawi...

MIKE WALLACE

You eating with us?

LOWELL

Yeah.

MIKE WALLACE

Bring a tie so they'll let us in the

front

door...

LOWELL

Debbie...

FELLING

Hey, Lowell.

LOWELL

Oh, Bill...  Main Justice is

investigating a major New York bank.

Laundering narco dollars out of their

Mexico City branch.  You want it for the

Evening News?

FELLING

What about you, you got a crew already?

LOWELL

I'm gonna do a follow-up.

FELLING

Okay.

(leaves)

LOWELL

Catch ya' later.

LOWELL

Debbie...

LOWELL (CONT'D)

(to Debbie; finally)

I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  Boundaries

of their constraint.  Kentucky state law

about.  I want you to drop everything.

DEBBIE DELUCA

(cuts in)

Okay.

UNIFORMED SECURITY

(to Wigand)

Mr. Wigand, you can go up now...

THOMAS SANDEFUR

(re:  his distraction)

Sorry.  I'm accepting an award from the

Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.  It's

going to kill the rest of my day.

THOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd)

(finishing; looking up at

Jeffrey)

So.  You had a chance to play golf?

THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)

(to the Lawyers)

Jeff's a premiere golfer...  What are

you, a two handicap?

WIGAND

(precise)

Seven...

THOMAS SANDEFUR

(to lawyer)

And, he gets out there and he has five

strokes on us.  He has more concentration

than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky

how he can concentrate.

WIGAND

I'd rather play than talk about it.

(beat)

What did you want to see me about?  I

don't like being back here.

THOMAS SANDEFUR

Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.

Most people consider what they're

saying...social skills...  Jeffrey just

charges right ahead.

(smiles, after a beat)

Now, I know you understood the nature of

the confidentiality portion of your

severance agreement with Brown &

Williamson, Jeff...

WIGAND

Chapter and verse.

THOMAS SANDEFUR

(nods)

Yeah, I know you do...

(beat)

You know, I came up through sales.  One

of the reasons I was a great salesman,

was I never made a promise I couldn't

keep.

(beat)

I knew that if I ever broke my promise

I'd suffer the consequence...

WIGAND

(contained)

Is that a threat?

THOMAS SANDEFUR

...we worked together for, what was it,

three years...?

Now, the work we did here is

confidential, not for public

scrutiny...any more than are one's family

matters...

WIGAND

(quietly)

You threatening my family, now, too?

THOMAS SANDEFUR

Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

(a beat)

About the direction of research here, we

may have had our differences of

opinion...

WIGAND

"Research..."

(smile + scorn)

You declare, as a badge of honor, you

don't even know what makes water boil...

THOMAS SANDEFUR

That's why we hire scientists...

WIGAND

(interrupts, direct)

Okay.

(a beat, honest)

I don't believe you can maintain

corporate integrity without

confidentiality agreements.  I was paid

well for my work.  The health and welfare

benefits are good.  The severance package

is fair.  I have no intention of

violating my confidentiality agreement

and disclosing that which I said I

wouldn't.

THOMAS SANDEFUR

I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon

reflection...we've decided to expand our

zone of comfort with you.

THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D)

So we've drafted a supplement to your

agreement...it broadly defines and

expands in more detail what is

"confidential."  Nobody will be able to

say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I

didn't know that was a secret..."

(beat)

We're very serious about protecting our

interests.

(a beat)

We'd like you to sign it.

WIGAND

(a beat)

And if I don't?

A LAWYER

(speaking for Sandefur)

If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're

acting in bad faith?  We would terminate,

right now, payouts under your severance

package.  You and your family's medical

benefits.  And initiate litigation

against you, Mr. Wigand.

WIGAND

Dr

. Wigand.

A LAWYER

(a beat)

Dr

. Wigand...after you've examined the

document, you will see it is in your own

best interest and you'll sign it.

WIGAND

So, what you are saying is:  it isn't

enough that you fired me.  For no good

reason!  Now you question my integrity?

On top of the humiliation of being fired?

You threaten me?!  You threaten my

family?!

(beat)

It never crossed my mind not to honor my

agreement...

(turning, to Sandefur)

But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and

Brown & Williamson, too...  Fuck me?

(a beat)

Well, fuck you!!

A LAWYER

I'm not sure he got the message...

THOMAS SANDEFUR

(with total confidence)

Oh, I think he did.

LOWELL

(answering)

Yeah...

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

...you fucked me!

LOWELL

Who is this?

WIGAND

(crazed)

...protect your sources...!  You screwed

me!  You sold me out!

LOWELL

What are you talking about?  Where are

you?

WIGAND

Fuck you, too!

WIGAND

(motioning with the club,

threatening)

Stay away from me!  You stay away from

me!

LIANE

Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

LOWELL

Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

WIGAND

(to the girls, protectively)

Jump in, quick, c'mon...

LOWELL

I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the

phone, remember?

LOWELL (CONT'D)

C'mere.  I want to talk to you.

WIGAND

Good.  I want to talk to you.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(confronting him)

What do...

LOWELL

(running over)

I did not burn you.  I did not give you

up to anyone!

WIGAND

(continuing)

This is my house...  In front of my wife,

my kids?!  What business do we have?

LOWELL

To straighten something out with you.

Right here.  Right now.

WIGAND

So, you didn't mention my name?  You

haven't talked to anybody about me?

LOWELL

Why am I gonna mention your name?

WIGAND

How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke

to you...?

LOWELL

How the hell do I know about Brown &

Williamson?

WIGAND

It

happened

after I talked to you.  I do

not like coincidences!

LOWELL

And I don't like paranoid accusations!

I'm a journalist.  Think.  Use your head.

How do I operate as a journalist by

screwing the people who could provide me

with information

before

they provided me

with it?

WIGAND

(skeptical)

You came all the way down here to tell me

that?

LOWELL

No.  I did not.  Big Tobacco is a big

story.  And you got something important

to say.  I can tell.

(a beat, personal)

But, yes.  I did.

I came all the way down here to tell you:

story, no story,

fuck

your story, I don't

burn people.

WIGAND

(after a beat)

Ride with me while I take the girls to

school...

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

...and my little girl has acute asthma...

Deborah.  My eldest daughter.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

And, I'm unemployed.  So I have to

protect my medical coverage.

(the bottom line; turning to

look at Lowell in the rear

seat)

...so I left them a message this morning.

Their expanded confidentiality agreement?

I will sign it.

LOWELL

They're afraid of you, aren't they?

WIGAND

They should be.

LOWELL

(after a beat, trying to make

it easier for him)

Talk to me outside the zone of your

agreement?

WIGAND

(guarded)

Like what?

LOWELL

Like where'd you work before Brown &

Williamson?

WIGAND

(a beat)

Johnson & Johnson.  Union Carbide in

Japan.  I was general manager and

director of new products.  I speak

Japanese.  I was a director of corporate

development at Pfizer.  All health-

related.

(wry)

What else?  Outside the "zone"...?

LOWELL

I don't know...you think the Knicks are

gonna make it through the semi-finals?

DISSOLVE TO:

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Just give me an example...

WIGAND

For example.  James Burke, the CEO of

Johnson & Johnson...when he found out

that some lunatic had put poison in

Tylenol bottles, he didn't

argue

with the

FDA...  He didn't even

wait

for the FDA

to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off

every shelf of every store right across

America.  Instantly.  And then he

developed the safety cap...  Because,

look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a

great businessman, right?  But he's also

a man of science.  He's not going to

allow his company...to put on the

shelf...a product that might hurt people.

(sarcastic)

Not like the Seven Dwarfs...

LOWELL

Seven dwarfs?

WIGAND

The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got

up in front of Congress that time...it

was on television...

LOWELL

...and swore under oath that they know

nothing about addiction, disease...

WIGAND

It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah.

LOWELL

Okay, so, here you are...you go to work

for tobacco.

(after beat)

You come from corporate cultures where

research, really, creative thinking,

these are core values.  You go to

tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture.

Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a

lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with

everything else.

(beat)

What are you doing?  Why are you working

for "tobacco" in the first place?

WIGAND

(deadly honest)

I can't talk about it.  The work I was

supposed to do...might have had some

positive effect.  I don't know...it could

have been beneficial.

(bitterness there)

Mostly, I got paid a lot.  I took the

money.  My wife was happy.  My kids had

good medical.  Good schools.  Got a

great house.

(simply)

I mean, what the hell is wrong with

that...?

LOWELL

Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it;

you're making money...you're providing

for your family?  What could be wrong

with that?

WIGAND

I've always thought of myself...as a man

of science.  That's what's wrong with it.

LOWELL

Then...you're in a state of conflict,

Jeff.

LOWELL (CONT'D)

Because, look, here's how it lays out: if

you got vital, insider stuff the American

people for their welfare really

do

need

to know...and you feel impelled to

disclose it and violate your agreement in

doing so, that's one thing.  On the other

hand, if you want to honor this

agreement, then that's simple.  You do

so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing.

There's only one guy who can figure that

out for you.  And that's you.  All by

yourself.

too

evenhanded?  As Wigand

WIGAND

I've got to go pick up the girls.  They

only had half a day...

LOWELL (OVER)

He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs...

MIKE WALLACE (OVER)

What "Seven Dwarfs?"

LOWELL (OVER)

The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred

to this...  Said they

should

be afraid of

him...  I assume, afraid of what he could

reveal.

(to Staff Lawyers)

Now, you tell me.  What does this guy

have to say that threatens these people?

MIKE WALLACE

Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for

you"...

LOWELL

Hardly new news.

MIKE WALLACE

No shit.

LOWELL

What's this?

MARK STERN

(re:  video)

What that is is tobacco's standard

defense.  It's the "we don't know"

litany:  "Addiction?  We

believe

not.

Disease?  We don't know.  We take a bunch

of leaves, roll 'em together.  You smoke

'em.  After that?  You're on your own.

We don't know."

(beat)

So...tells me nothing.

(beat)

Besides, you'll never get what he's got.

LOWELL

Why not?

JOHN HARRIS

Because of this guy's confidentiality

agreement, he is never gonna be able to

talk to you.

LOWELL

That's not good enough.  This guy is the

top scientist in the number three tobacco

company in America.  He's a corporate

officer.  You

never

get whistle-blowers

from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is

the ultimate insider.  He's got something

to say; he wants to say it; I want it on

"60 Minutes."

JOHN HARRIS

Doesn't matter what he

wants

.

MIKE WALLACE

Am I missing something here?

JOHN HARRIS

What do you mean, Mike?

MIKE WALLACE

He's got a corporate secrecy agreement?

Give me a break.  This is a public-health

issue, like an unsafe airframe on a

passenger jet or...some company dumping

cyanide into the East River.  Issues like

that?  He can talk, we can air it.

They've got no right to hide behind a

corporate agreement.

(re:  his coffee)

Pass the milk...

JOHN HARRIS

(does)

They don't need the right.  They've got

the money.

MARK STERN

The unlimited checkbook.  That's how Big

Tobacco wins every time.  On everything.

They spend you to death.  $600 million a

year in outside legal.  Chadbourne-Parke.

Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis.

Listen.  GM and Ford, they get nailed

after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up.  Right?

These clowns have never...I mean ever...

JOHN HARRIS

Not even once...

MARK STERN

...not even with hundreds of thousands

dying each year from an illness related

to their product...have

ever

lost a

personal-injury lawsuit.  On this case,

they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach,

anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us,

his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian...

Tie him up in litigation for ten of

fifteen years.  I'm telling you, they bat

a thousand.  Every time.  He knows that.

That's why he's not gonna talk to you...

LOWELL

Okay, let's look through the looking

glass the other way...

MIKE WALLACE

What do you mean?

LOWELL

We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's

constrained.

(beat)

What if he were "compelled"?

MIKE WALLACE

(eating)

Oh, torture?  Great ratings.

MARK STERN

What do you mean compelled?

LOWELL

(seriously)

I mean compelled by a Justice Department,

state courts, be a witness.  That would

cut through any confidentiality

agreement, wouldn't it?

MARK STERN

Yeah...

DEBBIE DELUCA

What does that do?

LOWELL

What do you mean, what's it do?

DEBBIE DELUCA

What I mean is, like, how does it cut

through the confidentiality agreement?

LOWELL

Because he has to reveal it in a court of

law.  It's on record, it's out.  It's no

secret anymore.  So how can they restrain

his speech or retaliate?  It's out in the

world...

MARK STERN

(nods)

If you could engineer it into the court

record, you might have something.  They

would have a helluva time trying to

restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?

JOHN HARRIS

(still skeptical)

Yeah, but what venue?  And where does he

get - does he have killer attorneys?

LOWELL

I don't think he's got any attorneys.

MARK STERN

He's gonna need attorneys who aren't

afraid of risking years of litigation.

And millions of dollars of their

own

dough in legal costs...

LOWELL

What do you say, Mike?  What do you

think?

MIKE WALLACE

(pause)

Even if he gets the defense team, will he

go for it?

MRS. WATSON

...you're awfully overqualified, Dr.

Wigand.

WIGAND

(after a beat, awkward)

I'm trying to...start a new career...  I

believe I could be a good teacher...

MRS. WATSON

Let me give it some thought...

WIGAND

(selling)

...and not a lot of companies in the

health-care field hire ex-tobacco

scientists.

WIGAND

That's it...

LIANE

(beat)

That's where our babies were born...

Debbie took her first steps, right

there...in the grass.

LIANE (CONT'D)

I didn't plan on this...

WIGAND

Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can

make this work for us.  Okay?  It's

just...it's a smaller scale.

Simpler...easier...more time.  More time

together.  More time with the kids.  More

time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you

imagine me coming home from some job

feeling good at the end of the day?  This

is gonna be better.  This is gonna be

better.

WIGAND

Hey, baby.  What's wrong?

BARBARA

(terrified, whispers)

What's that outside, Daddy?

WIGAND

Did you see somebody or did you hear

them?

BARBARA

I heard them.

WIGAND

Where?

BARBARA

In the backyard.

WIGAND

Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you

just sit up at the desk.  Get out some

paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What

are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal,

something like that?  You stay down here

until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara?

You stay down here.

WIGAND

(to himself)

You almost got your damn head blown

off...

BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)

Daddy...

WIGAND

(reassuring her)

It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

They're nocturnal.  You know what that

means?  That means that they only come

out at nighttime.

LOWELL

(sleepy)

Yeah...

WIGAND

(after a beat)

Lowell...  Jeffrey Wigand...

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

Is it too late?

LOWELL

No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the

new place?

WIGAND

The new place?  New.

LOWELL

(intuiting)

You okay?

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

Sure.

LOWELL

You know, I was thinking of calling you

tomorrow, anyway.

(beat)

How are your kids handling the new house?

WIGAND

Good.

(beat)

You have kids?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

We have a couple.  One's hers, one's

mine.  Everybody uses a different name.

(wry)

Modern marriage.

(beat)

How's Liane?

WIGAND

She's okay.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

Hold on a minute, Lowell...

(after a beat)

...somebody...may be following me.  I

don't know.  They came on the property...

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

What do you mean followed you?  Did you

call the police?

WIGAND

I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean,

maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind

game.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Well, what do you

really

think, though?

WIGAND

I don't know what the

fuck

I

really

think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank

doing it?  Are they doing it to make me

feel

paranoid?  Are they doing it for

real and don't give a shit what I think?

I don't know!  I don't fucking know.

LOWELL

Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what

happened.

WIGAND

Well, no, look...I mean, there was a

footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not

important at all.

(beat)

You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching

high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

(beat)

So, what were you calling about?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

You called me.

WIGAND

No, you said you were going to call me

tomorrow.  So, what about?

LOWELL

(after a beat)

Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to

talk to you.  I wanted to hook up and

talk to you.  About what we were talking

about in your car.

WIGAND

...okay.

LOWELL

(after a beat)

Makes you feel good?  Putting what you

know to use?

WIGAND

How'd you know that, Lowell?

LOWELL

It's obvious, isn't it?

LOWELL (CONT'D)

Hello.  You there

WIGAND

Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm

sorry I woke you up.

LOWELL

It's okay.

WIGAND

Lowell...?

WIGAND (CONT'D)

Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do

not...

LOWELL

What did you get us?

WIGAND

Tempura...

WIGAND (cont'd)

The internet said you did graduate work

in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla

with Professor...Marcus?

LOWELL

Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He

had a major influence on the New Left in

the late '60s...and on me, personally.

WIGAND

Next to your father?

LOWELL

My father?  What the hell's that got to

do with my father?

WIGAND

Is that why you became a journalist?

Then you get to ask all the questions?

LOWELL

You charge by the hour?

WIGAND

My father was a mechanical

engineer...most ingenious man I ever

knew.

LOWELL

Well, my father left us when I was five-

years old.  He was

not

the most ingenious

man I ever knew...  Let's get back to

Brown & Williamson.  If you decide to go

on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything

about why you got fired.

WIGAND

Why?

LOWELL

They're gonna dig up stuff from your

past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I

got to know what they're gonna throw.

You understand?

WIGAND

(concedes)

I drink.  A couple of occasions more than

I should have.

(thinks)

I was

cited

for shoplifting once.  But it

was a mistake...

(hesitant, after a beat)

I pushed Liane one time.  We were both

stressed out because of the pressure.

She went to her mother's.

(out of the blue)

I got fired because when I get angry I

have difficulty censoring myself.  And I

don't like to be pushed around!

LOWELL

I'm

not pushing you around!

(after a beat)

I'm asking you questions.

WIGAND

I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I

could be anything.  Right?  Anything

worth putting on between commercials...

LOWELL

(honest)

...to a network, probably, we're

all

commodities.

(beat)

To me?  You are

not

a commodity.  What

you are is important.

LOWELL (cont'd)

You go public and thirty-million people

hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean

nothing, will ever be the same again.

LOWELL (cont'd)

You believe that?

WIGAND

(skeptical)

No.

LOWELL

You should.  Because when you're done, a

judgment is going to go down in the court

of public opinion, my friend.  And that's

the power you have.

WIGAND

You believe

that

?

LOWELL

I believe that?  Yes, I believe that.

WIGAND

You believe that because you get

information out to people...something

happens?

LOWELL

Yes.

WIGAND

Maybe that's just what you've been

telling yourself all these years to

justify having a good job?  Having

status?  And maybe for the audience, it's

just voyeurism?  Something to do on a

Sunday night.  And maybe it won't change

a fucking thing.  And people like myself

and my family are left hung out to dry.

Used up!  Broke, alone!

LOWELL

Are you talking to me or did somebody

else just walk in here?!  I never

abandoned a source!

WIGAND

I don't think you really understand --

LOWELL

(running over)

No, don't evade a choice

you

gotta make

be questioning

my

reputation or "60

Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!

WIGAND

I have to put my family's welfare on the

line here, my friend!  And what are you

puttin' up?  You're puttin' up words!

LOWELL

Words!  While you've been dickin' around

at fucking company golf tournaments, I

been out

in the world

, giving my word and

backing it up with action.

LOWELL (cont'd)

Now, are you going to go do this

thing, or not?

WIGAND

(surprisingly mild)

I said I'd call the kids before they went

to bed.  Onisa...

All the

police are on horseback

,

lots of cops on horses

.

LOWELL

The stringer was supposed to be shooting

B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.

What's with all the horses?

TONY BALDO

Camera guy's got a thing about mounted

police.

LOWELL

(re:  horses)

Don't any of these guys ride in cars or

walk?

TONY BALDO

How long did he stay on this?

LOWELL

What was he seeing?

DEBBIE DELUCA

(into phone)

Yes, hello...  I'm trying to reach Mr.

Richard Scruggs...

THE PILOT

This is Richard Scruggs...

DEBBIE DELUCA

Could you hold on one second, please?

(to Lowell)

Lowell, I got him on the phone.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Hold on...  Mobile approach...this is

Lear November 643.  Over.

CONTROL OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER)

Go ahead 643.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(after a beat)

Request a flight level 220, on a heading

of 284 degrees.  Over.

(after a beat)

Mr. Bergman?

LOWELL

Yes, I'm right here.  Could you call me

back on a hard line?

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Alright.

LOWELL

Area code 212-555-0199.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

I'll call you then.

LOWELL

(re:  footage)

What do we do with that?

DEBBIE DELUCA

I don't know.

RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)

Richard Scruggs...

LOWELL

...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on

behalf of the State of Mississippi, did

you not?

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(nods)

That's right...

LOWELL

(after a beat)

Well, I'm working with someone, now, who

was the former head of research at Brown

& Williamson, a former corporate officer

there.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

What's your interest in this, Mr.

Bergman?

LOWELL

Well, he may tape an interview with us.

And, we believe if his testimony showed

up in a court record first, it would free

him up from his confidentiality agreement

and give him some protection.

MOTLEY

It could work.  If it's public record,

it's public record.

LOWELL

Yeah, and he's going to need legal

representation.

MOTLEY

He sure as hell will.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(a beat)

Has he decided to go public?  Because

let me tell you, we've been doing this

for three years now, and we've worked

with a lot of corporate cases involving

whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big

Tobacco will do everything in their power

to stop him.  So, is your man truly

committed?

LOWELL

Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the

fence.  That's the point.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Well, we'd certainly be interested in

making his acquaintance, but without

knowing what he's going to do...

LOWELL

Well, would you want him to call you?

Or, you want to call him?  How do you

want to do it?

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(no nonsense)

It would be better if he called us.

LOWELL

Yeah.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Alright?

LOWELL

Okay.  Thank you.

LOWELL (cont'd)

Shit...

LOWELL

(contemplating phone; to Debbie

re:  show)

Oh, we need cops on the street.  We don't

need them on horses.

DEBBIE DELUCA

I don't know what he was thinking.

LOWELL

Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy

got, a horse fetish?

DEBBIE DELUCA

Alright, alright.

LOWELL

Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!

DEBORAH

What are you cooking?

LIANE

I'm cooking pasta primavera.

DEBORAH

Oh, I love that stuff.

LIANE

I'm going to have to go downstairs.

WE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF

YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP.

LIANE

Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie!

LOWELL

What happened?

COP

Dispatch received a call of shots fired

in the area.  Uniforms arrived on the

scene and found this white male subject

shot to death.

LOWELL

Was it gang related?

COP

There's no indication as far as a tag or

an advertisement...

LOWELL

(answering)

Excuse me.  Yeah...

WIGAND

They're terrorizing us.  Death threats?!

To my

family

?  My kids?!

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

What are you talking about?

WIGAND

Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.

LOWELL

Jeff, call the FBI right away...

WIGAND

They do this with impunity!

LOWELL

Jeff...

WIGAND

They get to go home at night.  What does

it cost these people to do this to us?

Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck

them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking

about it.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(frustrated)

I heard you.  But I got to arrange a

legal defense first.  I got to get you to

testify in court, get it on public

record.

WIGAND

(cuts in)

Then hold it off the air until you got

that.  But I want to go to New York.

And I want to go on the record.  Right

now!

LOWELL

Good.  But Jeff...

WIGAND

I'll call them, Lowell.

FBI AGENT #2

Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?

WIGAND

Yes, I'm afraid I did.

FBI AGENT #1

We won't be able to lift usable prints.

FBI AGENT #2

Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?

WIGAND

A gun?  Yes.

FBI AGENT #2

What caliber is your gun?

WIGAND

What caliber is my gun?

FBI AGENT #2

Yes, sir.  What caliber is your gun?

WIGAND

(a dawning realization)

What does that have to do with the price

of tea in China?

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(a beat, realizing)

You think I put that bullet in the

mailbox myself...?

FBI AGENT #2

If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

FBI AGENT #1

Why do you keep this gun?

WIGAND

I don't think it's unconstitutional

yet

to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter.

FBI AGENT #2

That bullet was for a .38 caliber.  Do

you own a .38?

WIGAND

Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my

gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A

.22 target pistol.  So what?

FBI AGENT #2

(after a beat)

Do you have a history of emotional

problems, Mr. Wigand?

WIGAND

Yes.  Yes, I do.

(beat)

Yes, I get extremely emotional when

assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!

LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

(upset)

I didn't tell you that so you could just

pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey!

WIGAND

What's going on?

LIANE

I told him that you had an E-mail death

threat that said if you didn't shut the

"F" up, they were going to kill you...

WIGAND

(outraged)

You can't take that...  It's personal

property...!

FBI AGENT #2 (OR #3)

We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.

There's been a death threat.

WIGAND

(after him)

...my files!  Personal correspondence...

WIGAND (CONT'D)

...letters to my brother...my will.

WIGAND (cont'd)

That computer has everything...

FBI AGENT #2

You alright, Mr. Wigand?

FBI AGENT #1

We need to take a look at your gun safe,

Mr. Wigand.

LOWELL

(interrupts)

I'm telling you, your agents in that

office are acting improperly!  Now, who

are they trying to protect?

BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)

Let me tell you something, Lowell.  Look,

look, look.  You're talking about two

agents in a regional office in

Louisville.  I got the goddamn Unabomber

threatening to blow up LAX!  I gotta move

45 agents from all over the country into

L.A.  Alright?  When I get a chance, I'll

give it a look...

LOWELL

(heated)

You better take a good look!  Because I'm

getting two things:  pissed off and

curious!  Now, any of these guys been

offered jobs in corporate security after

they retire?  Either one of those guys

have ex-agent pals

already

in those jobs?

Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor,

who's already at Brown & Williamson as we

fucking speak?

BILL ROBERTSON

(beat)

I'll give it a look.

LOWELL

You're getting my drift?

BILL ROBERTSON

I'll give it a look.

LOWELL

So, is everything okay?

MIKE WALLACE

How are the rooms?  Comfortable?

LIANE

(to Mike)

Yes, very.  You know, I enjoy your work

so much...when you're talking to

somebody, I always feel like I'm right

there.

MIKE WALLACE

Thank you got saying that...

LOWELL

Do you think we could talk about the

taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we

can get it out of the way and order...

MIKE WALLACE

Yeah, well, questions will go toward what

work you did there, why you were fired.

And others will deal...

LIANE

(not sure she quite heard)

...taping?

(beat)

What are you taping?

WIGAND

I'm doing an interview.

LIANE

(whispers)

An interview!  Do you know what they will

do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry.

LOWELL

(trying to intervene)

Liane, this is a preliminary...

(after a beat)

You didn't tell her we were taping?

What did she think she was coming to New

York for?

WIGAND

...to talk about it.  To think about it.

I had a plan to ease her into it.  But, I

really - I didn't know how to do that...

LOWELL

Oh, man.

MIKE WALLACE

Who

are

these people?

LOWELL

(frustrated)

Ordinary people!  Under

extraordinary

pressure, Mike.  What the hell do you

expect?  Grace and consistency?

MIKE WALLACE

You heard Mr. Sandefur say before

Congress that he

believed

nicotine was

not

addictive...?

WIGAND

(nods)

...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured

himself because I watched those

testimonies very carefully.

MIKE WALLACE

All of us did.  There was this whole

line

of people...whole line of CEOs up there

all swearing.

WIGAND

Part of the reason I'm here is I felt

that their representation clearly

misstated, at least within Brown &

Williamson's representation, clearly

misstated

...what is common language

within the company...we are in the

nicotine delivery business.

MIKE WALLACE

And that's what cigarettes are for...?

WIGAND

A delivery device for nicotine.

MIKE WALLACE

A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it

in your mouth, light it up, and you're

gonna get your fix...

WIGAND

You're gonna get your fix...

MIKE WALLACE

You're saying that Brown & Williamson

manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix,

not by artificially adding nicotine, but

by enhancing the effect of nicotine

through the use of chemical elements such

as ammonia...

WIGAND

(nods)

The process is known as "impact

boosting..."  While not spiking nicotine,

they clearly manipulate it.  There's

extensive use of this technology, know

as "ammonia chemistry."  It allows for

the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed

in the lung and therefore affect the

brain and central nervous system.

WIGAND

The straw that broke the camel's back for

me and really put me in trouble with

Sandefur was a compound called

"coumarin."  When I came on board at B&W,

they had tried to transition from

coumarin to a similar flavor that would

give the same taste, and had been

unsuccessful.  I wanted it out

immediately.

I was told that it would affect sales, so

I should mind my own business.  I

constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur

indicating I could not in conscience

continue with coumarin in a product that

we now knew, we had documentation, was

similar to coumadin, a lung-specific

carcinogen...

MIKE WALLACE

And you sent the document forward to

Sandefur?

WIGAND

I sent the document forward to Sandefur.

I was told that we would continue to work

on a substitute, we weren't going to

remove it as it would impact sales, and

that that was his decision.

MIKE WALLACE

In other words, you were charging

Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with

ignoring health considerations

consciously

...

WIGAND

Most certainly.

MIKE WALLACE

And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of

Brown & Williamson had you fired.  And

the reason he gave you?

WIGAND

Poor communication skills.

MIKE WALLACE

And, do you wish you hadn't come forward?

You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

WIGAND

Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't

done it.  There are times I feel

compelled to do it.  If you asked me

would I do it again?  Do I think it's

worth it?  Yeah, I think it's worth it.

WIGAND

Hi.

KIDS

(in unison)

Hi.

WIGAND

My name is Jeff Wigand.  You can call me

Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand--I

have a Ph.D. in biochemistry and

endocrinology; you can call me Jeff...

(beat)

Anything else you want to call

me...you'll have to do so in private...

(a few kids smile)

Okay...  I find chemistry to be magical.

I find it an adventure.  An exploration

into the building blocks of our physical

universe...

(beat)

So, how many of you have taken chemistry

before?

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(easy smile)

Okay...I've never taught it before, so

we're gonna be fine.

WIGAND (cont'd)

Our first experiment is...

(holds up cigarette lighter)

...going to be measuring the molecular

weight of butane...

CHARLENE

He's on line three.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Hello.

WIGAND

Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman

said I should give you a call...

RICHARD SCRUGGS

My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have

filed a lawsuit against the tobacco

industry on behalf of the State of

Mississippi to get the state reimbursed

Medicaid costs for treating people with

smoking-related illness.

(beat)

If you'd be interested in talking to us,

we'd certainly like to talk to you...

WIGAND

When should we do this?

WIGAND

Who the hell are you?!  What are you

doing in my house?!

LOWELL

It's okay, Jeff.

SECURITY GUARD

Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

LOWELL

(wry)

It's okay.  You got your own security

now...

WIGAND

Lowell, I can't afford --

LOWELL

...they "volunteered."  A friend owns a

large security company.

TALIFARO

How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon

Talifaro.  There'll be three of us on

detail.

LIANE

(crossing through)

I'm going to the store.  Please explain

our new "houseguests" to your children.

WIGAND

I called Richard Scruggs in

Mississippi...

LOWELL

I heard.

WIGAND

I'm going to be a witness for them in

their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to

Pascagoula to give a deposition...

LOWELL

I know.  I'm going to go there tonight...

WIGAND

Did you have a good day?

DEBORAH

Yes, I did.  I had a great day.

WIGAND

Coffee, Lowell?

LOWELL

Yeah.

(to kids)

Want to play that game we were playing

before?  You know, I think you got it up

to five.  I was ahead of you.

LIANE

Please don't wash your hands in the sink.

WIGAND

Where should I wash them?

LIANE

Use the bathroom.

WIGAND

What's the difference...

LIANE

That's for food.

she

turns it

on

.

LIANE (cont'd)

Leave it on!  Just leave it on, okay?!

LIANE

I don't think I can do this...  I want to

stand by my husband...  I really do,

Jeffrey.  But I don't think I can do this

anymore.  I am so sorry...

WIGAND

Can we talk about this when I get back?

LIANE

Yes...Jeffrey.

THE MAN

(friendly)

Jeff...?

THE MAN (CONT'D)

(nasty)

You've been served.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Now, what this one is, is a temporary

restraining order, a gag order, issued by

a Kentucky court.

RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)

(introducing)

Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

MICHAEL MOORE

Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Mike's our Attorney General down here.

(to Moore)

I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a

Kentucky court to issue a gag order to

stop his deposition today.

MICHAEL MOORE

Right.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Now, they tried to get the Mississippi

Court to honor it, but the judge threw it

out...

(to Jeffrey)

However, for you, there is a more

perilous effect to the Kentucky gag

order...

MICHAEL MOORE

(after a beat)

Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could

happen, don't you?

WIGAND

I'm not free to testify...here...?

MOTLEY

That's right.  If you violate the

Kentucky order, when you step foot back

in Kentucky, they can find you in

contempt and they can incarcerate you.

And you ought to know that.

WIGAND

Jail?

RICHARD SCRUGGS

Possibly, yes.  That is one of the

possible consequences of your testifying

here today.  That's right...

WIGAND

How does one..."go...to...jail?"  What

does my family do?  Go on welfare?  If my

wife has to work?  Who's going to look

after the kids?  Put food on the table?

My children need me.  If I'm not

teaching...there's no medical...no

medical...even on co-pay, that's like...

Tuition...

MICHAEL MOORE

Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be able

to do this thing.  As I understand from

Dick, you're our key witness.  And, I

hope you don't withdraw.  I guess we'd

all understand if you did...

(at watch)

Guys, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late

for court.  I'll see y'all a little

later.  Dr. Wigand, good luck.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

I know what you're facing, Jeff.  And, I

think I know how you're feeling...

anybody

could know "how it is"...

RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)

(low, personal)

In the Navy I flew A-6's off carriers...

In combat, events have a duration of

seconds, sometimes minutes...  But what

you're going through goes on day in and

day out.  Whether you're ready for it or

not, week in, week out...  Month after

month after month.  Whether you're up or

whether you're down.  You're assaulted

psychologically.  You're assaulted

financially, which is its own special

kind of violence.  Because it's directed

at your kids...what school can you

afford...  How will that affect their

lives.  You're asking yourself:  Will that

limit what they may become?  You feel

your whole family's future's

compromised...held hostage...

(after a beat)

I

do

know how it is.

LOWELL

You

attract a crowd.

WIGAND

(smiles, wry)

Yeah, great.

LOWELL

I heard about the Kentucky gag order...

WIGAND

I don't know what to do.

TOBACCO LAWYER

(into phone)

Hold on a second...

(seeing Motley enter; to Jr.

Lawyer)

Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he

expects his witness to appear or not...?

WIGAND

(severely conflicted)

I can't seem to find...the criteria to

decide.  It's too big a decision to make

without being resolved...in my own mind.

LOWELL

Maybe things have changed...

WIGAND

What's changed?

LOWELL

(unsure)

You mean...since this morning?

WIGAND

No.  I mean since whenever...

WIGAND (CONT'D)

Fuck it.  Let's go to court.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(to unseen staff)

Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.

MOTLEY

Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at

that table over there.  I'm going to

start as fast as possible.  I don't want

to give them a chance to get another

restraining order, okay?  Let's go.

MICHAEL MOORE

Good luck, Doc.

STENOGRAPHER

Please stand.  Raise your right hand...

Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole

truth and nothing but the truth, so help

you God?

WIGAND

I do.

STENOGRAPHER

You may be seated.

MOTLEY

You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under

oath.  This is a sworn deposition.

There's no judge.  It's not a trial.

(understatement of the century)

Will you state your name for the record.

WIGAND

(after a beat)

Jeffrey S. Wigand.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Got any idea what's going on in there?

LOWELL

No, I don't have a clue.

WIGAND

That is correct.

MOTLEY

In other words, it acts as a drug?

TOBACCO LAWYER

Object to the form of the question!

MOTLEY

It acts as a drug on the body?

TOBACCO LAWYER

Object to the form!

MOTLEY

It acts as a...

TOBACCO LAWYER

Object!

MOTLEY

There an echo in here?  Your objection's

been recorded.  She typed it into her

little machine over there.  It's on the

record.  So now I'll proceed with my

deposition of

my

witness.  Does it act as

a drug?

TOBACCO LAWYER

(shouts)

Dr. Wigand.  I am instructing

you

...

(to Wigand)

...

not

to answer that question in

accordance to the terms of the

contractual obligations undertaken by you

not to disclose any information about

your work at the Brown & Williamson

Tobacco Company.  And in accordance with

the force and effect of the temporary

restraining order that has been entered

against

you to by the court in the State of

Kentucky!  That means you don't talk!

(beat)

Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...

MOTLEY

(explodes)

Oh, you got rights

and

lefts!  Ups and

downs and middles!  So what?!  You don't

get to instruct

anything

around here!

This is not North Carolina, not South

Carolina nor

Kentucky

.  This is the

sovereign State of

Mississippi

's

proceeding.  Wipe that smirk off your

face!  Dr. Wigand's deposition

will

be

part of this record.  And I'm going to

take my witness' testimony!  Whether the

hell you like it or not!

(to Wigand)

Answer the question, Dr...

WIGAND

(slams it home)

Yes.  It produces a physiological

response, which meets the definition of a

drug!  Nicotine is associated with

impact, with satisfaction.  It has a

pharmacological effect that crosses the

blood-brain barrier intact...

MOTLEY

Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you.

WIGAND

(on monitor)

"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt

that their representation clearly, at

least within..."

LOWELL

Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's

not addictive."  Run that on-camera.

Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe

they perjured..."  Then go wide to the

CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff

and play the pause after the word "felt"

on the B-side...

hot

show and it's generated excitement

BILL FELLING

(leaving)

...helluva show, Mike.  Explosive

material.

LOWELL

(to Mike)

It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

MIKE WALLACE

Good.

DON HEWITT

I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

LOWELL

Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal

the secret formula of "Kools" to the

world.

(seriously)

"Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs'

litigation, and since we're the only ones

with the story, I believe we're sitting

on an exclusive.

MIKE WALLACE

I like

that

...

DON HEWITT

Corporate has some questions.  We've got

a meeting at Black Rock first thing in

the morning.

LOWELL

When's the air date?

DEBBIE DELUCA

(to Lowell)

Excuse me, Lowell.  Sharon's on line 3.

LOWELL

Tell her I'll call her back in ten.

BALDO

Here we go.

misstated

what they commonly knew.

HELEN CAPERELLI

Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late.

MIKE WALLACE

No, no, we're fine...

HELEN CAPERELLI

Are you sure?

HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)

Alright, I thought we'd get together

because there's a legal concept that has

been getting some new attention recently,

"tortious interference."

(beat)

If two people have an agreement, like a

confidentiality agreement, and one of

them breaks it because they are induced

to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party

can be sued for damages for

interfering...hence, "tortious

interference."

DON HEWITT

Interfering?  That's what we do.

LOWELL

I think what we're trying to tell you is

that it happens all the time.  This is a

news organization.  People are always

telling us things they shouldn't.  We

have to verify if it's true and in the

public interest...  And if it is, we air

it.

MIKE WALLACE

After we corroborate it.  That's why

we've never lost a lawsuit and run a

classy show.

(impatient, now)

Anything else?

HELEN CAPERELLI

And

"60 Minutes'" verification

is

exact.

And

precise.

And

I don't think it would

hurt to make

sure

you're right...on this

one.

DON HEWITT

Why?  You think we have liability?

What's the CBS News' position, Eric?

ERIC KLUSTER

There's a possibility, it's rather

remote...

HELEN CAPERELLI

But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've

retained outside counsel to do exactly

that.  On a segment, I might add, that's

already rife with problems...

LOWELL

What does that mean?  "Rife with -- ?"

HELEN CAPERELLI

I'm told unusual promises were made to

Wigand.

LOWELL

No, only that we would hold the story

until it was safe for him...

HELEN CAPERELLI

(cuts in)

And, I'm told there are questions as to

our "star witness'" veracity.

LOWELL

(trying to control his anger)

His "veracity" was good enough for the

State of Mississippi.

HELEN CAPERELLI

(historic)

Our standards have to be higher than

anyone else's, because we

are

the

standard...

for

everyone else...

LOWELL

(wry)

Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with

"is the guy telling the truth?"

HELEN CAPERELLI

Well, with tortious interference, I'm

afraid...the greater the truth, the

greater the damage.

LOWELL

Come again?

HELEN CAPERELLI

They

own

the information he's disclosing.

The truer it is, the greater the damage

to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose

their

information.  And the damages are

smaller.

LOWELL

Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?

MIKE WALLACE

You said "on this one."  What about "this

one"?

HELEN CAPERELLI

(familiar, seductive)

If this holds up, and it very well may

not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired

this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown

& Williamson?  I think we could be at

grave risk.

MIKE WALLACE

(a beat)

How grace?

HELEN CAPERELLI

(and she's been waiting for

this)

Well, at the end of the day...because of

your segment...the Brown & Williamson

Tobacco Company...could

own

CBS.

HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)

You know, I am sorry.  But I'm due

upstairs.

LOWELL

Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not

go to air with this story?

HELEN CAPERELLI

You're getting ahead of yourself.  We're

all

in this together.  We're

all

CBS.

We'll find out soon.  Thank you,

gentlemen.

LOWELL

"Tortious interference"?  Sounds like a

disease caught by a radio.

DON HEWITT

(to Mike)

Lunch?

MIKE WALLACE

Sure.

(to Lowell)

Don't worry, we call the shots around

here.

DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)

Hello?

LOWELL

(into phone)

Debbie, it's me.  I want you to check

some filings and give me John Wilson's

number at Bear-Stern.

LOWELL

What now?

DON HEWITT

Kluster's coming over.

ERIC KLUSTER

Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don.

ERIC KLUSTER (CONT'D)

There has been so much soul searching

about this Wigand, I've decided we should

cut an alternate version of the show

without

his interview.

LOWELL

So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's

checking with outside counsel first, all

that crap?

ERIC KLUSTER

That's happening.  And, hopefully we

won't have to use the alternate, but we

should have it in the can.

LOWELL

I'm not touching my film...

ERIC KLUSTER

I'm afraid you are.

LOWELL

No, I'm not...

ERIC KLUSTER

We're doing this with or without you,

Lowell.  If you like, I can assign

another producer to edit your show...

LOWELL

Since when has the paragon of

investigative journalism allowed lawyers

to determine the news content on "60

Minutes"?

DON HEWITT

It's an alternate version.  So what if we

have an alternate version?  And I don't

think her being cautious is so damned

unreasonable.

ERIC KLUSTER

(wry)

So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

Mr. Rather's been complaining about his

chair again.

(laughter)

LOWELL

(mild)

Before you go...

LOWELL (CONT'D)

I discovered this.  SEC filing...

(he gets their attention)

For the sale of the CBS Corporation to

Westinghouse Corporation.

MIKE WALLACE

What?

DON HEWITT

Yeah, I heard rumors.

LOWELL

It's not a rumor.  It's a sale.

(rhetorical answer)

If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share

to Westinghouse and then is suddenly

threatened with a multibillion-dollar

lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that

could screw up the sale, could it not?

ERIC KLUSTER

(serene)

And what are you implying?

LOWELL

(to Kluster)

I'm not implying.  I'm quoting.  More

vested interests...

(reading from SEC filing)

"Persons Who Will Profit From This

Merger...

(beat)

Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of

CBS News, 3.9 million.  Mr. Eric Kluster,

President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."

DON HEWITT

Are you suggesting that she and Eric are

influenced by money?

LOWELL

Oh, no, of course they're not influenced

by money.  They work for free.  And you

are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

DON HEWITT

CBS does not do that.  And, you're

questioning our journalistic integrity?!

LOWELL

No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You

hear "reasonable" and "tortious

interference."  I hear...  "Potential

Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing

the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."  I

hear...  "Shut the segment down.  Cut

Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck

off...!"  That's what I hear.

DON HEWITT

You're exaggerating!

LOWELL

I am?  You pay me to go get guys like

Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to

trust us, to get him to go on television.

I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He

talks.  He violates his own fucking

confidentiality agreement.  And he's only

the key witness in the

biggest

public

health reform issue, maybe the biggest,

most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case

in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand,

who's out on a limb, does he go on

television and tell the truth?  Yes.

Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air

it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's

not telling the truth?  No.  Because he

is

telling the truth.  That's why we're

not going to air it.  And the more truth

he tells, the worse it gets!

DON HEWITT

You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You

know that?  If we can't have a whole

show, then I want half a show rather than

no show.  But oh, no, not you.  You won't

be satisfied unless you're putting the

company at risk!

LOWELL

C'mon, what are you?  And are you a

businessman?  Or are you a newsman?!

Because that happens to be what Mike and

I do for a living...

MIKE WALLACE

Lowell.

LOWELL

(runs on)

"Put the corporation at risk"...?  Give

me a fucking break!

MIKE WALLACE

Lowell.

LOWELL

These people are putting

our whole reason

for

doing what we do

...on the line!

MIKE WALLACE

Lowell!

LOWELL

What?

MIKE WALLACE

I'm with Don on this.

SHARON

What's wrong?

LOWELL

They're killing the Wigand interview...

SHARON

What?!

LOWELL

They're pretending it's process.

Bullshit, it's foregone.

SHARON

(beat)

What are you and Mike going to do?

LOWELL

I'm alone on this...

SHARON

(beat)

Oh, baby...

SHARON (CONT'D)

(after a beat)

Jeffrey Wigand...

LOWELL

Jeffrey...

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family,

okay?

WIGAND

There is - there is no family.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

What do you mean there is no family?

WIGAND

Liane has filed for divorce...

WIGAND

And, so, I moved out...  I see the girls

a couple of days a week...

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(concerned)

Where you staying now?

WIGAND

(sarcastic)

Our favorite hotel, honey...  I checked

into Room 930.  Odd choice?  Huh?

LOWELL

(after a beat)

I don't know how to say this, Jeff,

except to just say it right out, so I'll

say it.  They do not

want

to air it.

WIGAND

(stops)

What?!

LOWELL

B & W may have threatened litigation...

CBS is on the block...

(a beat)

But you, I mean, I know how...

WIGAND

No.

LOWELL

No?  No, what?

WIGAND

I do not think that you "know" for

me...what it is to walk in

my

shoes...

(beat)

...for my kids to have seen it...for them

to know why I've put them through what I

did...the public airing of that...the

testament to why I did what I

did...you're telling me is not going to

see the light of day.

LOWELL

Jeff...

P.I.

Mrs. Wigand?

THE WOMAN

It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand for some time.

P.I.

Well, I'm an investigator and I was - I

was wondering if I could ask you a couple

of questions about that?

THE WOMAN

Alright...

SUSAN WIGAND

...seven months after we were married we

found out that I had multiple

sclerosis...

P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)

(on television)

And, you had a daughter, Diane, with him,

is that correct?

SUSAN WIGAND

(on television)

Yes, in 1973.

JOHN SCANLON

(on the phone, whispering)

...come on, Tommy Sandefur told me

himself, he's not gonna allow Brown &

Williamson to be demonized to the

American public, so I told Peter Jennings

and I...hold on...

P.I.'S VOICE (OVER)

(on television)

Would it be fair to say when he divorced

you he left you in a precarious

situation?  You had multiple sclerosis;

you had a small child to raise.

JOHN SCANLON

(ignoring that part; to staff)

Mention that part in the executive

summary and in the chapters "First Wife"

and "Estrangement of Daughter."

(beat; into phone)

So, I was telling Pete, I said, "You've

been taken in by this guy...

SUSAN WIGAND

(on television)

Yes...

(beat)

But you have to understand, the divorce

was something that we both wanted...

JOHN SCANLON

He's a total bullshit artist.  He's a

shoplifter.  He's a convicted shoplifter.

DON HEWITT

(after a beat, cold)

So, what are you going to do?

LOWELL

Well, what do you think I'm going to do?

Quit in protest?  I'm not going to do

that.

DON HEWITT

(surprised)

You're taking "no" for an answer?

LOWELL

No.  I'm

not

going to take "no" for an

answer.  No.

DON HEWITT

Then what

are

you going to do?

LOWELL

I'm staying right here.  Doing my job.

Fighting to get my show on the air.  You

don't like it?  Hey, I'll tell you

what...

fire

my ass...

DON HEWITT

End up in a high-profile lawsuit with

Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?  I

don't think so.

(laughs)

Take a look at this...  This is a summary

of a dossier that's being prepared.

DON HEWITT (CONT'D)

He would lie about his whole life...?

Who's going to believe him about anything

he says...?

(a beat, and the coup de grace)

The Wall Street Journal

's doing a major

story and I think the

Post

.  You backed

the wrong horse...

DON HEWITT (cont'd)

(his parting shot)

The version without his interview is

going to air the week after next.

DEBBIE DELUCA

What was that about?

LOWELL

Get me Wigand.

DEBBIE DELUCA

Sure.

LOWELL

...fuck is this?  Fuck!

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(on the phone, upset)

You never told me you were married

before...that you had a daughter...

WIGAND

(outraged)

Well, how is that any of your business?!

That is not something that you people

need to know!

LOWELL

(frustrated)

Oh, you know what we

do

or

do not

need to

know?  Since when have you become a media

expert?

WIGAND

(upset)

What do you want to do, Lowell, look up

my ass, too...!

LOWELL

Oh, my God.

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

(after a beat, lowering his

voice, but contentious)

You're not even on this anymore...  What

do you care?

LOWELL

Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on

the line here.  If they can catch you in

a lie, they can paint everything with

that brush.  Do you understand?

Everything you say!

WIGAND

I told the truth!

LOWELL

Everything

...you...

say

!  And I can't

defend you, man, with one hand tied

behind my back!  Because you keep from

me...what they can discover.  And they

will

discover everything!  Believe me.

WIGAND

(meaning his first wife and

their child, upset)

...I was young.  I was

young...confused...  We didn't handle it

the right way...

LOWELL

(after a beat)

She sued you for back payments of child

support?

WIGAND

She did not sue me.  We had a dispute

over money...  I settled it, she dropped

the complaint...

(angry)

Any other questions?

LOWELL

Yes.  Did you lie about being on the

American Judo Team in the Olympics?

WIGAND

What?

LOWELL

Some public relations guy got a hold of a

tape of an interview...where you're

saying you were on the American Judo Team

in the Olympics...?

WIGAND

(explosive)

What kind of shit is this?  I was not

on

the team, I

sparred

with the Olympic

Team...okay?

LOWELL

Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company?

WIGAND

ABC...?

LOWELL

ABC Telemarketing Company.

WIGAND

(the absurdity)

A can opener!  A $39.95 can opener.  I

cancelled payment...  It was junk.

(sarcastic)

You ever bounce a check, Lowell?  You

ever look at another woman's tits?  You

ever cheat a little on your taxes?

(a beat, angry)

Whose life, if you look at it under a

microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

LOWELL

That's the

whole

point, Jeffrey.  That's

the whole point.  Anyone's.  Everyone's.

They are gonna look under every rock, dig

up every flaw, every mistake you've ever

made.  They are going to distort and

exaggerate everything you've ever done,

man.  Don't you understand?

WIGAND

(shouts)

What does this have to do with my

testimony?

LOWELL

That's not the point.

WIGAND

What does this have to do with my

testimony?!  I told the truth!  It's

valid and true and provable!

LOWELL

That's not the fucking point, whether you

told the truth or not!  Hello...?

WIGAND

I told the truth...  I told the truth.

WIGAND

(after a beat)

I've got to teach class.  I've got to go.

I've got to teach class.

LOWELL

(undaunted)

And I've got to refute every fucking

accusation made in this report before

The

Wall Street Journal

runs.

(a beat)

I am trying to protect you, man!

WIGAND

(after a beat, the killer)

Well, I hope you improve your batting

average.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

Hello?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(cautious)

It's Lowell.  Are you guys planning to do

a piece on a former top executive in Big

Tobacco?

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

You caught me in a news meeting.

LOWELL

Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

You bet we are.  And I can't talk to you

now.

LOWELL

We gotta hook up.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

Sure.  Where?

LOWELL

P.J.'s.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

I'll be there.

LOWELL

Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They

looked in every corner of this guy's

life...from a spousal abuse charge, to

shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got

once for running a red light.  It's Terry

Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to

me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy,

ruin his reputation in

The Wall Street

Journal

, and then nobody will ever listen

to what he's got to say about tobacco.

He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing

knocked down.

LOWELL

To make it even a little more attractive,

I don't know if you're ever gonna get

paid.

SANDRA SUTHERLAND

Is there any truth to any of it?

LOWELL

That's a good question.  "Is there any

truth to any of it?"  I doubt it.

LOWELL

It's a smear campaign, Charlie.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

It's drawn from a selectively

circulated...

LOWELL

(cuts in)

Oh, it's real selective...about as hard

to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone

book.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

Well, it's authoritative and is

overwhelmingly documented.

LOWELL

And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are

you going to put the

Journal

's reputation

behind a story that's going to blow up in

your face?

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm

not moving any deadlines 'cause you say

so.

CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd)

Are you all right?

LOWELL

Yeah.  Catch you later.

SANDRA SUTHERLAND

Officer Murabchick?

SANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd)

Officer Muravchick.  How are you?  I'm

Sandra Sutherland.

POLICEMAN

How do you do?

SANDRA SUTHERLAND

Fine, thank you.  I'm doing a background

check.  Mind if I sit down?

PALLADINO

Your honor, could I have a word with you?

You presided in a dispute over support

payments...

POLICEMAN

Jeffrey Wigand?  Yeah, I cited him.

DAN RATHER

(on monitor)

CBS is under criticism, because the CBS

News program "60 Minutes" will not be

presenting an interview...

DON HEWITT

What the hell are you doing?

LOWELL

What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm

editing.

DON HEWITT

No, not that.  I'm talking about the

Associated Press.  They got this story

that we pulled this interview and they

talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them

that we were lying?

LOWELL

No.  I

should

have.  I told them I

disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that

this segment is as good as the original.

I'm not lying for you.  I'm not gonna

shut up for you.  Not on any of it.

DON HEWITT

Hey!  I'm not going to fire you, okay?

Take a vacation.  Now!

MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)

Lowell.  I decided to preface Sunday's

show.  I did three minutes on the

"Evening News."  You'll want to see it.

(beat)

Where you going?

LOWELL

I've been banished.  In lieu of being

fired.

MIKE WALLACE

(disinterested)

I took off on Tisch.  I took off on

corporate.  They'll know they're

not

going to see

everything

on Sunday

night...

LOWELL

I don't know.  How does that get Wigand

on the air?

MIKE WALLACE

(goes up)

Do me a favor, will you?  Spare me, for

God's sake.  Get in the real world.  What

do you think?  I'm going to resign in

protest?  To force it on the air?  The

answer is "no."  I don't plan to spend

the end of my days wandering in the

wilderness of National Public Radio.

(beat)

That decision I've already made.

VOICE

(from corridor; to Mike)

It just started, Mike...

takes a

cursory look and moves towards the elevator

MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)

Where's the rest?  Where the hell's the

rest?!!

MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

You cut it!  You cut the guts out of what

I

said

ERIC KLUSTER

It was a time consideration, Mike...

MIKE WALLACE

Time?  Bullshit!  You corporate lackey!

Who told you your incompetent little

fingers had the requisite skills to edit

me!  I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation,

here, and you're too dim to...

HELEN CAPERELLI

Mike...  Mike...  Mike...

MIKE WALLACE

"Mike?"

MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

"Mike?"  Try "Mr. Wallace."  We work in

the same corporation doesn't mean we work

in the same profession.  What are you

gonna do now?  You gonna finesse me?

Lawyer me some more?  I've been in this

profession fifty fucking years.  You and

the people you work for are destroying

the most-respected, the highest-rated,

the most-profitable show on this network!

LOWELL

Here.

LOWELL (CONT'D)

These are their leads, their sources.  I

want you to have your reporters...

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

LOWELL

Have them make their

own

calls.  They'll

find that these sources have a different

story than the one that's in the

dossier...

(demands)

Push the deadline, Charlie...

CHARLIE PHILLIPS

I'll push it for a week.  Let Milo and

Suein go through it.

What do you want to buy him for a gift?

BARBARA

He's into kind of little cars, that...

Yeah.

Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.

Yes, baby?

LOCAL NEWSCASTER

And in local news, WLKO Louisville has

gained access to a five-hundred-page

dossier on former Brown & Williamson

research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing

charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting...

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...thousands of documents from inside

the tobacco industry have surfaced over

the past year, documents that appear to

confirm what a former..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...US Surgeon General and the current

head of the Food and Drug Administration

have been saying.  We learned of..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...a tobacco insider who could tell us

whether or not the tobacco industry has

been leveling with the public..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...that insider was formerly a highly-

placed executive with a tobacco

company..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...but we cannot broadcast what critical

information about tobacco, addiction and

public health he might be able to offer.

Why?  Because he had to sign a

confidentiality agreement with the

tobacco company he worked for..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"The management of CBS has told us that

knowing he had that agreement..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"...if were to broadcast an interview

with him, CBS could be faced with a

multibillion-dollar lawsuit..."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes," from the

interview with Wigand...)

"The fact is, we are not allowed even to

mention his name or the name of the

company he worked for and, of course, we

cannot show you his face...  '...and your

confidentiality agreement with...(blip)

is still in force?'"

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

"Yes, it is."

MIKE WALLACE

(on "60 Minutes")

"So, what are they gonna do?  Sue you for

making this appearance?"

WIGAND

"I would bet on it."

Yeah.

MIKE WALLACE

You disappeared on me.  How long you

staying?

LOWELL

(absurd)

I disappeared on you?

MIKE WALLACE

(meaning the show)

Alright.  What did you think?

LOWELL

(after a beat)

I think it was a disgrace.

AN OPERATOR'S VOICE (OVER)

Sir, there's still no answer in that

room.

LOWELL

Alright.  Get me the manager's office...

HOTEL DESK CLERK

David?  David, you've got a call on line

4.  I think you better take it.

THE HOTEL MANAGER

This is David MacDougal.  How can I help

you?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.

I'm a producer for "60 Minutes"...

I'm concerned with a friend of mine who's

staying at your hotel right now.

KNOCKING

on Jeffrey's door...

THE HOTEL MANAGER

Mr. Wigand?  Mr. Wigand?

THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)

(upset)

I think I need to call the police.  He

won't respond...

LOWELL

No, no.  Don't call the police!

(urgent)

Just tell him I'm on the phone with

you...  My name is Lowell Bergman...

Just tell him that.

THE HOTEL MANAGER

(through the door, frightened)

Mr. Wigand...Mr. Bergman is on the

telephone.

LOWELL

Did he hear you?

THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)

You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.

LOWELL

What about now?

THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)

What?

LOWELL

Hello, can you hear me now?

LOWELL

(alarmed)

What's happening?!

THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)

(afraid)

He doesn't seem to be listening...

LOWELL

(on the cell phone, shouts,

urgent)

Alright, now listen to me.  I want you -

I want you to tell him, in these words:

get on the fucking phone...!

THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE (OVER)

I can't say that!

LOWELL

No, you can.  Tell him to get on the

fucking phone!

THE HOTEL MANAGER

(at the door, to Jeffrey, loud)

He told me to tell you, to get on...the

fucking phone...!

WIGAND

(on the phone, angry)

You manipulated me into this...!

LOWELL

That's bullshit, Jeff!

WIGAND

You greased the rails!

LOWELL

I greased the rails for a guy who wanted

to say yes.  I helped him to say yes.

Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff!

That's all.  You got a mind of your own,

don't you?

WIGAND

(running on)

"Up to you, Jeffrey.  That's the power

you have, Jeffrey.  Vital insider

information the American public need to

know."  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who

never met a source he couldn't turn

around.

LOWELL

(running on)

I fought for you...and I still fight for

you.

WIGAND

You fought for me...?!

(running on)

...you manipulated me...into where I am

now...staring at the Brown & Williamson

Building.  It's all dark.  Except the

10th floor!  That's the legal department.

That's where they fuck with my life!

LOWELL

(beat)

Jeffrey, where you going with this?  So

where you goin'?

(quiet)

You are important to a lot of people,

Jeffrey.  You think about that.  You

think about them.

LOWELL (CONT'D)

I'm running out of heroes, man...

(after a beat)

Guys like you are in short supply.

WIGAND

(a beat, wry)

Yeah, guys like you, too.

WIGAND (CONT'D)

(after a beat)

Where are you, anyway?

LOWELL

I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced

vacation.

WIGAND

(a rare laugh, his sarcasm)

You try and have a good time.

LOWELL

(droll)

Yeah.  Yeah, I will.

LOWELL

"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60

Minutes.'"  You know, you take the "60

Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody

returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's

right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I

hooked on?  The rush?  "60 Minutes"?

What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's

so fucking useless, all of it.

SHARON

(a beat)

So, it's a big country with a free press.

You can go work somewhere else.

LOWELL

Free press?  Press is free...for anyone

who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free

press.

SHARON

Get some perspective, Lowell.

LOWELL

I got perspective.

SHARON

No, you do not.

LOWELL

From my perspective, what's been going on

and what I've been doing is ridiculous.

It's half-measures.

SHARON

You're not listening.

(beat)

Really know what you're going to do

before you do it.

DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)

I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone...

LOWELL

Patch him through.

RICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER)

Well, Lowell, you are not going to

believe this...

RICAHRD SCRUGGS

The Governor of Mississippi is suing his

own

Attorney General...to abandon

litigation against Big Tobacco...

LOWELL

Oh, good...

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(after a beat)

But, now that the version without Jeff

ran...what's the chance of getting his

interview on the air...?

(beat)

Hello?

LOWELL

Yeah, I'm here.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

What chance is there of getting Jeff's

interview on the air...?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(droll)

Less than great.

RICHARD SCRUGGS

(after a beat)

...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell

you how important it was in the court of

public opinion...

LOWELL

(a beat)

...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't

tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...

RICHARD SCRUGGS

All right.  See you...

LOWELL

Hi.  So, what are you folks doing here in

Lincoln?

MAN GEOLOGIST

Geology survey.

LOWELL

Geology.  Yeah?  Really?

WOMAN GEOLOGIST

How about you?

LOWELL

(direct)

I work for CBS News.

MAN GEOLOGIST

(after a beat)

Oh, yeah?

LOWELL

Just ran into two of your "geologists."

Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed

up...?

BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)

Lowell?

BILL ROBERTSON

Do

not

...screw this up.  We are a week

away from an arrest...

LOWELL

So, I'll hold it...  And...

BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)

(on the phone)

We'll give you a heads up before we

launch.

LOWELL

How long?

BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER)

Three hours.

LOWELL

You got a deal.

(hangs up)

MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)

"...like the testimony before Congress of

Dr. Wigand's former boss, Brown &

Williamson's Chief Executive Officer,

Thomas Sandefur."

THOMAS SANDEFUR

(in CLOSE-UP)

"I believe that nicotine is not

addictive."

WIGAND

(in matching CLOSE-UP)

"I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured

himself...  Because I watched those

testimonies very carefully."

WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)

"All of us did...there was this whole

like of people, the whole line of CEOs up

there, all swearing that."

WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER)

"Part of the reason I'm here is I

Hello?

Jim, it's Lowell.

NEW YORK TIMES

- NIGHT

JIM COOPER

Hey!  Where are you?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

(doesn't answer)

Remember that night at P.J.'s?  You asked

me if we were sitting on something

"explosive"?

(beat)

Well, we're not "sitting on" it.

(beat)

CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which

yanked

an interview we did with a top-

ranking tobacco scientist.  A corporate

officer.  They are trying to close down

the story.

JIM COOPER

(sarcastic)

You mean, "60 Minutes" is letting CBS

corporate decide what is or is not news?

(beat)

What's Wallace think about this, or

Hewitt, or...?

LOWELL

How prominent?  What kind of placement?

JIM COOPER

Oh, c'mon, Lowell.  This is

The New York

Times

.  I don't know...

LOWELL

Well, until you do, all I can tell you is

what you already know...they will not air

an interview.

JIM COOPER

Call me back in ten.

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Debbie.  It's me...

DEBBIE DELUCA

Hi.  What time is it?

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Oh, it's late.

DEBBIE DELUCA

That

I know.  When are you coming back?

LOWELL

I can't get out of here til mid-morning.

I'll be in tomorrow night...

(beat)

Listen, could you call a number for me,

it's in Mississippi...

DEBBIE DELUCA

Okay.  Hold on a second...  What is it?

NEW YORK TIMES

JIM COOPER

Hello?

(beat)

LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)

Lowell.

JIM COOPER

Alright, Lowell.  Page one.  Editorial's

interested.  Let's talk.

LOWELL

Here's how it works.  You ask me

questions.  I tell you if you're

wrong

.

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)

Okay.

(pause)

Lowell?

LOWELL

Yeah?

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)

You're sure you want to do this?

LOWELL

Why?

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)

Hey, it doesn't work?  You've burned your

bridges, man.

LOWELL

You ready...?

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)

Okay...  About this whistle-blower...

Did Mike and Don go along with the

corporate decision?

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd)

Lowell?

LOWELL

Did I tell you you were wrong?

JIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)

No.

(beat)

I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the

threat of litigation from Big Tobacco.

Are we talking...are we talking Brown &

Williamson, here?

The New York Times

New York Times

MIKE WALLACE

Did I get you up?

LOWELL

No, I usually sit around in my hotel

room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the

morning, sleepy look on my face.

MIKE WALLACE

How many shows have we done?  Huh?

C'mon, how many?

LOWELL

Oh, lots.

MIKE WALLACE

Yeah, that's right.

LOWELL

But in all that time, Mike, did you ever

get off a plane, walk into a room, and

find that a source for a story changed

his mind?  Lost his heart?  Walked out on

us?  Not one fucking time!  You want to

know why?

MIKE WALLACE

I see a rhetorical question on the

horizon.

LOWELL

I'm going to

tell

you why.  Because when

I tell someone I'm going to do something,

I deliver.

MIKE WALLACE

Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell

Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down

the shining path.  To show me the way.

LOWELL

Oh, please, Mike...

MIKE WALLACE

(beat)

Give me a break!

LOWELL

No,

you

give

me

a break!  I never left a

source hung out to dry, ever.  Abandoned.

Not 'til right fucking now!  When I came

on this job, I came with my word intact.

I'm gonna leave with my word intact.

Fuck the rules of the game!  Hell, you're

supposed to know me, Mike.  What the hell

did you expect?  You expect me to lie

down?  Back off?  What, get over it?

MIKE WALLACE

In the real world, when you get to where

I am, there

are

other considerations...

LOWELL

Like what?  Corporate responsibility?

What, are we talking celebrity here?

MIKE WALLACE

I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS.

I'm talking about when you're nearer the

end of your life than the beginning.

Now, what do you think you think about

then?  The future?  "In the future I'm

going to do this?  Become that?"  What

"future"?  No.  What you think is:  how

will I be regarded in the end?  After I'm

gone.

MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)

Now, along the way I suppose I made some

minor

impact.

(beat)

I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah,

Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam,

Sadat, etcetera, etcetera.  I showed

them thieves in suits.

(beat)

I've spent a lifetime building all that.

But history only remembers most what you

did last.  And should that be fronting a

segment that allowed a tobacco giant to

crash this network?

(beat)

Does it give someone at my time of life

pause?

(simply)

Yeah.

LOWELL

Mike...in my...

MIKE WALLACE

You and I have been doing this together

for

fourteen years

MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)

This is today's

New York Times

went on inside our shop.

And in the editorial...  It accuses

us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R.

Murrow.

The Wall Street Journal

DON HEWITT

(troubled)

They conclude most of it seems pretty

unsubstantiated...

(looking at him, sickened)

You're full of shit, John.

New York Times, New York

, etc.  His phone rings...

LOWELL

Yeah.

The Wall Street Journal

in

DEBBIE DELUCA

...front page.  There's a picture of

Wigand.  Article's entitled, "Getting

Personal," by-lined to Suein Hwang and

Milo Geyelin.  Wait, hold on a second,

Lowell.

DEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd)

Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see if I can

find him.  Hold on...

(beat; to Lowell)

Yeah, Don's looking for you...

LOWELL

Good.

DEBBIE DELUCA

The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson

Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief

Critic."

It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the

worst kind of an organized smear campaign

against a whistle-blower."

DEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER)

"...a close look at the file, and

independent research by this newspaper

into its key claims, indicates that many

of the serious allegations against Mr.

Wigand are backed by scant or

contradictory evidence..."

DON HEWITT

The news division has been vilified in

The New York Times

, in print, on

television, for caving to corporate

interests!

DON HEWITT (CONT'D)

The New York Times

ran a blow by blow of

what we talked about behind closed doors!

You fucked us!

LOWELL

(shouting)

No,

you

fucked

you

!  Don't invert stuff!

Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you

bought it.

The Wall Street Journal

,

here, not exactly a bastion of anti-

capitalist sentiment, refutes Big

Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest

form of character assassination!  And

now, even now, when every word of what

Wigand has said on our show is printed,

the entire deposition of his testimony in

a court of law in the State of

Mississippi, the cat totally out of the

bag, you're still standing here debating!

Don, what the hell else...do you need?

DON HEWITT

Mike, you tell him...

MIKE WALLACE

(simply)

You fucked up, Don.

DON HEWITT

(recovers fast)

Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like

always, we'll be okay.  These things have

a half-life of fifteen minutes...

MIKE WALLACE

No, that's fame.  Fame has a fifteen-

minute half-life...

(droll)

Infamy...lasts a little longer.

MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

We caved.  It's foolish.  It's simply

dead wrong.

(in his face, so there's no

doubt)

Now, this is what we're going to do.

We're going over to Black Rock...

WIGAND

Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright,

now, what we saw there was...

LOWELL

(into phone)

They cancelled the six o'clock.

I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I

should be home...9:30.  I'll see you

then.  Love ya'.  Bye...

MIKE WALLACE

"CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast

our original story and our interview with

Wigand because they were worried about

the possibility of a multi-billion dollar

lawsuit against us for tortious

interference...  But now things have

changed."

MICHAEL MOORE

(on television)

"...in my opinion, is an industry that

has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the

American public in history."

MIKE WALLACE

(to Wigand)

"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"

WIGAND

(on television, hesitating)

"There are times...I wish I hadn't done

it.  But there are times that I feel

compelled to do it..."

"I've - if you asked me if I would do it

again or if it's - do I think it's worth

it.  Yeah.  I think it's worth it."

BILL ROBERTSON

I promised you a three-hour heads-

up...well, here it is.  Have a camera

crew standing by in Helena, Montana on

Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour

head start.  Alright?  By the way, that

was a hell of a good show tonight...
