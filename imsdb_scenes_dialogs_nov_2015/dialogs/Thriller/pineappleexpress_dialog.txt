GENERAL BRAT

When did it start?

SCIENTIST

At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.

2

SCIENTIST

(into microphone)

Private Miller, we are now going to ask

you several questions. How do you feel?

PRIVATE MILLER

Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...

It's good. Good queer.

(beat)

Sir. Good queer, Sir.

PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)

But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,

I should mention that I'm also feeling

quite gay...so, a little queer, but

mostly gay.

SCIENTIST

Private Miller. When you think of your

superiors, what emotions do you feel?

PRIVATE MILLER

(holding out the joint)

This went out...Sir.

SCIENTIST

We will send someone in. Now answer the

question.

SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)

(through speakers)

Private Miller? Answer the question.

3

PRIVATE MILLER

Oh...um...what was the question again?

SCIENTIST (O.S.)

(through speakers)

What are your emotions towards your

superiors?

PRIVATE MILLER

COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.

(beat)

Well, now that I think of it, it's

strange that they are called my

`superiors'. Does that make me their

`inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked

up.

GENERAL BRAT

(curtly to the scientists)

I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the

hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.

This never happened.

PRIVATE MILLER

(freaking out)

Hey! What the...what are you guys doing!

Let go of me!

(desperately looking at the

mirror)

Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!

GENERAL

(into phone)

This is General Brat. We've reached a

final conclusion on Item 9.

(beat)

Illegal.

TALK RADIO DJ

Well, let's look at the facts.

Financially, coins are better because

they're cheaper, and environmentally,

forget-about-it, coins win hands down.

For those just joining us, we're with

caller Dale Denton discussing if America

should lose the paper dollar bill.

DALE

Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of

coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,

clangs around. With all this unnecessary

new security everywhere, we'll be setting

off alarms left and right!

TALK RADIO DJ

We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but

to the point. Next caller!

WOMAN

Um, I didn't order a pizza.

DALE

Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby

5

WOMAN

Uh...yea-

DALE

Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up

to your divorce proceedings 4 times under

court order. You've been served.

WOMAN

Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real

clever! Go fuck yourself!

TALK RADIO DJ 2

...forget about Area 51, Roswell

sightings, Atlantis and the Boogie Man,

let's talk about real threats, threats to

our home and security...

DALE

Fuckin' eh.

DALE (CONT'D)

Nice! Hot Steppa!

DALE (CONT'D)

(singing)

You think you know, chico/I know what Bo,

don't know/touch them up and go - uh oh!/

Chi-chi-ching-chang!!!

6

SECRETARY

Can I help you?

DALE

Just here to check out some units.

WALTER (O.S.)

Come in.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Oh! Hey there. Are you here to fix the

fax machines?

DALE

Nope.

DALE (CONT'D)

You owe American Express $4068 dollars.

Sorry, but you've been served.

RADIO DJ 3

What gives you the right to say that?

DALE

Everything! They should be able to

collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not?

(MORE)

7

DALE (CONT'D)

As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come

get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f-

ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer

Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city

would be more aesthetically pleasing and

smell better. And don't pretend you can't

smell it. Ever been to New York? Great

place, smells like piss, though.

(takes a hit and starts

coughing)

Twice a week,  cough  might fix that.

(starts coughing harder)

Hold on one sec.

DALE

I need Dr. Terrence, immediately.

RECEPTIONIST

Of course. One moment.

DR. TERRENCE

(to Dale)

Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm-

DALE

Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who

repeatedly refused to take care of the

monkey tree that spills onto your

neighbors property. And now, because of

that, you've been served.

8

TALK RADIO DJ

...stay in your own country. Five simple

words. And stay the hell out of mine! I'm

not a racist, per se, but I'm not some

hippy tree humper.

DALE

Let me through, damnit.

CORBER

My name's Corber.

DALE

You're Joshua Aaron Corber?

CORBER

(overjoyed)

Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't

she? I was just telling her before I left

how I've never been in a limo. Can you

believe it? 35 and I've never been in a

limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?

DALE

Sorry, but you've been served.

CORBER

Ah fuck!

(reads more)

Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK!

9

DALE

(excited)

Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.

RADIO DJ

...3:09 in the PM and we-

ANGIE

Dale!

ANGIE (CONT'D)

Mmm. Minty.

ANGIE'S MALE FRIEND

Yo Dale. `sup.

10

DALE

Hey Kyle.

(to Angie)

So, should we head back to my place and

finish up the trilogy? Matrix:

Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man

or machine?

ANGIE

Of course. But can we just head to my

locker first? I left some stuff by

mistake.

DALE

Sure.

ANGIE

So, are you going to come over for dinner

tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning

to think I made you up.

DALE

Well, yeah, I really want to meet them.

Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me

think.

ANGIE

You don't have to feel weird about it.

They know how old you are and they're

fine with it. They just want to meet you

and see that you're a cool guy and that

I'm not dating you just because you're

older.

DALE

Of course. I know that. It's

just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole

bunch of cases that I can finish

tomorrow. It's probably going to take me

into the night.

ANGIE

Fuck. Well, then you have to just come

over sometime this week or something,

okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them.

11

DALE

I will. I promise. I'm not trying to

avoid this, for real, I've just been

crazy busy.

TEACHER

Hello? Can I help you?

DALE

Pardon?

TEACHER

You can't just waltz in here and hit on

the students. Get out now before I-

ANGIE

Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend.

MR. EDWARDS

This is your boyfriend? How old are you,

30?

DALE

24.

MR. EDWARDS

And you're dating an 18 year old?

ANGIE

I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.

MR. EDWARDS

Alright, well this school is for students

and faculty only. Friends can't just stop

by.

DALE

Dude, you may be a teacher here, but

we're about the same age, so don't get

all high and mighty. It's not that weird.

Frankly, it's natural.

12

MR. EDWARDS

Well, in that case, get off school

property or I'm calling the Police

Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to

you, but if this guy's dating someone

your age, it's because nobody his age

will date him.

HANDSOME STUDENT

Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama

today.

DALE

I'll wait in the car.

ANGIE

So, do you want to get some food?

DALE

No...actually I can't. I have to go serve

a guy.

ANGIE

Now?

DALE

Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang

out later though. You can come over.

ANGIE

We'll see if Neo is truly the one.

SAUL (O.S.)

(over phone)

Yo?

13

DALE

Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick

up some shit?

DALE

What's up, Saul.

SAUL

(unpleasantly surprised)

What the fuck?!?

DALE

What?

SAUL

I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did

you get in here?

DALE

Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me

in. I-

SAUL

That's fucked up, man! This building is

filled with fuckin' assholes. What else

is the buzzer for? Fuck.

DALE

I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry.

I'm just not familiar with your,

uh...protocol yet.

SAUL

Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro.

We're always cool. It's those fuckin'

jaggoffs.

DALE

Um...sure.

14

SAUL

Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.

Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but

fortunately, it's hands down the dopest

fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've

smoked some dope fuckin' shit.

DALE

Better than that Blue Oyster weed?

SAUL

Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue

Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had

a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest

Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso

Snowflake had a baby, and then by some

miracle those babies met, and fucked -

then this would be the shit they'd birth.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Smell it.

DALE

What is this? It's spectacular.

SAUL

It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red

told me it's when this Hawaiian flood

takes special dirt to the weed or some

shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the

only guy in the whole city who has it.

And, its only ten bones more for a

quarter.

DALE

So...can I get a quarter?

SAUL

No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.

15

SAUL (CONT'D)

What's with the look? What?

DALE

Where's the scale?

SAUL

Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.

SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(from other room)

You know what's weird? How sometimes,

your brain just chooses to like, not keep

things in it, you know?

(beat)

Fucking scale.

(beat)

Shit. Where is it?

DALE

Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?

SAUL

(nonchalantly)

Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen

one of these? Not surprising. They are,

like, the apex of the vortex of joint

engineering. NASA built the first one in

the eighties.

DALE

You can actually smoke that contraption?

16

SAUL

You light all three ends at the same

time, then, you smoke it as it resonates

the main section, creating a "trifecta"

of smoking power. It's like, three times

as powerful as a normal joint.

DALE

Well, be careful with that thing.

SAUL

Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with

me?

SAUL (CONT'D)

I can't even light it on my own.

DALE

(excited)

Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what

do I do?

SAUL

Alright. Firstly you light these two

ends. Then I will light the tip, making

the trifecta complete. Are you ready?

DALE

Holy...

SAUL

It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It

opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you

twenty-five percent higher.

(MORE)

17

SAUL (CONT'D)

And that, combined with the pineapple

weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're

a good thirty to forty times higher. I

don't know the exact math, but, pff,

you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You

know what I mean?

SAUL (CONT'D)

It's crazy. The better the weed, the more

I wish I could think of how to explain

what's so good about it, but the...uh,

the better it is, the less shit I can

think of in total, you know?

SAUL (CONT'D)

Okay, so, like, you've been buying from

me for, like, a few months now and I

really gotta ask.

(beat)

What's with the suit?

DALE

I'm a process server.

SAUL

You`re a servant? Like, a butler.

DALE

No, process server.

DALE (CONT'D)

I'm hired to give people papers they

don't want. It's pretty much the easiest

job on earth.

SAUL

Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?

DALE

Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree

two years ago, then I did nothing for a

year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked

me up.

18

DALE (CONT'D)

I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I

smoked like five joints, gave out some

pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger

King-

SAUL

Hey man, did you get those new chicken

fries?

DALE

Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're

fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot-

boxed my car and then...got some action

from my girlfriend.

SAUL

Does she smoke pot?

DALE

A little. She's in high school.

SAUL

That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're

like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his

biography.

DALE

No, no. She's 19.

SAUL

(dissappointed)

Oh. It's still cool I guess.

DALE

Yeah, it's awesome, although I think

she's getting old enough where she's

realizing I don't do much. And these high

school guys these days. They're all

roided out and going to Harvard. Even on

my best days, I look like a fat, dumb

piece of shit next to them.

SAUL

Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it

pretty good. I wish I had a job that

easy. Fuck.

19

DALE

Dude...you've got, like, the actual

easiest job in the world.

SAUL

Hey! You're right, man. I never thought

of it like that.

DALE

You can actually do whatever the hell you

want. You get to sleep all day and people

come buy weed at night.

SAUL

That's totally true. Except tomorrow.

Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I

gotta go change my grandma's clocks

forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't

figure it out.

DALE

Sorry to hear that.

SAUL

Yo, so, like, what have these people done

that you go after?

DALE

Let's see...tonight I'm going after-

DALE (CONT'D)

Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-

SAUL

Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a

Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in

town. Maybe it's him!

DALE

I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot

of Ted Joneses's out there.

SAUL

Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's

what I want to be one day. He's like the

"Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like

Jah. Or Scarface.

20

DALE

Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.

SAUL

No worries dude, peace.

DALE

Oh shit on me.

21

TED

Pineapple Express.

SAUL

Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.

SAUL (CONT'D)

(mumbles)

Fucking hell.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Hello?

DALE (O.C.)

(through intercom)

...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me

in! It's Dale! Let m--

SAUL

(annoyingly casual)

Denton? Dale Denton?

DALE (O.C.)

(through intercom)

...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-

22

SAUL

(to himself)

...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you

can't handle it.

SAUL (CONT'D)

(startled)

Dude, whoa. What the fuck are-

DALE

He fucking killed him, man!

SAUL

Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-

DALE

(quietly)

He killed him!

SAUL

(loud)

Somebody killed somebody?!?

DALE

Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A

lady, and a guy.

SAUL

Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?

DALE

No! A guy!

SAUL

A cop killed a guy?

DALE

No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy!

The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking

woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,

shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking

window at Ted's house!

SAUL

Was the guy Ted?

DALE

Which guy?

23

SAUL

I don't know, the old guy who shot the

guy?

DALE

I don't fucking know. He was this big,

old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he

fucking took him, and he shot him! Right

there in the fucking window! BAM!

SAUL

I heard Ted's got grey hair!

DALE

And they saw me! They saw me see them

shoot the guy!

SAUL

What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did

you come here? Did they follow you?!?

SAUL (CONT'D)

Did they follow you here!?!

DALE

No! I panicked. I was having a coughing

fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.

Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at

least. They knew someone was there.

SAUL

But they don't know it's you?

DALE

No. I don't think so. No.

SAUL

So...they're not coming here?

SAUL (CONT'D)

Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You

gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd

appreciate it if you left my shit out of

this shit.

24

DALE

I'm not calling the cops - one of them

was a cop. They could all be cops!

SAUL

Did you see any blood? Was it sick?

DALE

Yeah. I saw some blood.

SAUL

I wonder who the guy he shot was?

DALE

I don't know, who do drug dealers kill?

It was probably another drug dealer. He

was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.

SAUL

Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up

with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit.

They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two

in town.

(beat)

Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo,

you want some of this?

SAUL (CONT'D)

So, like, exactly what was the sequence

of happenings?

DALE

I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a

massive joint of that weed you sold me-

SAUL

Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare

it's almost a shame to smoke it, like

killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.

DALE

When I threw it...out...the window...

SAUL

What?

25

DALE

This weed is actually that rare?

SAUL

(proudly)

Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".

DALE

So, you are actually the only guy in town

with this weed?

SAUL

Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was

giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".

DALE

And am I the only guy you gave it to?

SAUL

Yeah. So, we're the only guys.

DALE

But, like, another dealer, couldn't

identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if

they found a roach of it, right?

SAUL

I could. Why?

DALE

(panicking)

We should go, we shouldn't be here! We

should go!

SAUL

No...seriously, why?

DALE

I left a roach of this weed in front of

Ted's house!

SAUL

So what? I leave roaches all over fucking

town.

26

DALE

No, listen - they could find the roach

and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's

the only guy in town who has pineapple

weed, therefore he must have witnessed

the murder or know who did - let's go

kill him."

SAUL

Mother of fuck!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Let's go!

DALE

Wait!

SAUL

Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck

out of here!

DALE

Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need,

like your weed and money and stuff.

DALE (CONT'D)

Are you sure you're not forgetting

anything?

SAUL

Yes! Come on!

SAUL

Fuck! I forgot something!

27

SAUL (CONT'D)

Dude, I was so scared going back, I

thought there was gonna be guys there,

and then you'd be gone, and there was

this music in my head-

DALE

We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.

DALE (CONT'D)

Go back! Go back!

DALE (CONT'D)

Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.

SAUL

Why?!?

DALE

We don't want to draw attention.

SAUL

(freaking out)

Whose attention!?! You think they could

be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!

DALE

I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be

cool.

DING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor.

DALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL

SAUL

What the fuck was that?

DALE

That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!

28

DALE (CONT'D)

Oh. Pardon.

MATHESON

Look.

BUDLOFSKY

Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I

think he knew we were coming.

DALE

Okay, what do you know about Ted?

SAUL

What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's

tracking us with space satellites right

now! He's got grey hair, that's all I

knew.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Let's go to your place.

DALE

No way! What if they did see my license

plate!?!

SAUL

Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a

motel, or a Holiday Inn.

DALE

Well, how much money do we have?

29

SAUL

All I've got is the seventy-five you gave

me.

DALE

That's it!?!

SAUL

Well, how much money do you have?

DALE

Uh...nine bucks.

SAUL

Well, shut up then! I've got more than

you!

DALE

Fine. Forget the hotel.

SAUL

I wish we could just go nowhere.

DALE

Okay...where's nowhere?

DALE

So what do we know? Nothing. We may or

may not be followed because we don't even

know if he found the roach or not. And,

we could just be completely crazy. But,

the question is this: even if he found

the roach, how could he know where you

were?

SAUL

(thrilled)

He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's

impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on

the bottom of the car or some shit, but I

mean-

30

DALE

No, what I mean is, if Ted found the

roach and identified the weed, how could

he connect it to you?

SAUL

There's no way. He could only find out

from Red.

DALE

Who is this Red guy?

SAUL

Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted

and guys like me. And we're mad fucking

tight. One time he convinced some girl he

knew to give me a hand-job within, like,

five minutes of me meeting her.

DALE

But let's say someone calls asking who he

sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say

you, because...why wouldn't he?

SAUL

Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have

called me if that happened. A hand-job,

Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand

job by now!

DALE

Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug

dealer.

SAUL

So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you

don't trust me then?

DALE

Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.

SAUL

Thank you!

DALE

You're right. You are. I'm just being

paranoid. Sorry, dude.

31

RED (O.S.)

(through phone)

Ow! Hello?

SAUL

Yo, Red. You okay man?

RED (O.S.)

Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.

SAUL

Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the

house. But Red, I gotta get straight to

brass tacs, I need a favor.

RED (O.S.)

Sure man, anything. I'm Red.

SAUL

You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know

how you gave me some of that pineapple

express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave

it to me.

RED (O.S.)

Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,

hombre.

SAUL

So, can I come on over now?

DALE

(louldy whispering)

No! We should do it tomorrow!

SAUL

(covering phone, talks to

Dale)

I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's

just go and get this shit over with.

DALE

Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared

shitless. I want to think things through

before I do anything. Let's go in the

morning. Please.

32

SAUL

Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in

the day.

SAUL (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Red?

RED (O.S.)

(talking to someone else)

-I can hear him talking to someone, so-

Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the

morning?

SAUL

Yeah, right after I see my grandma.

RED (O.S.)

Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!

Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is

that the one on Granville and 41st.

SAUL

Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be

chillin' by noon.

RED (O.S.)

Well, cool brother. Noon it is.

SAUL

We should definitely hit up the casino

again sometime.

RED (O.S.)

For sure. We should definitely hit up the

casino.

SAUL

Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone

cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the

house.

33

BUDLOFSKY

Why isn't he coming now? What did you

say?

RED

(incredibly afraid)

I didn't say shit, man! There was another

guy there and he said tomorrow!

MATHESON

Why did he mention the casino? The Asians

run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?

RED

No, man!

MATHESON

This might be more than we thought.

BUDLOFSKY

Than you thought. I thought it would be

more than you did. I'll call Ted.

SAUL

I always liked smoking weed in the

forest.

DALE

I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some

bull shit.

34

SAUL

Dale...wait!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know

how this shit works, but...can cops...

you said they might be cops...could they

triangulate our phones or trace `em or

some shit like that? I don't know. I feel

like I've seen that.

SAUL (CONT'D)

I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace

them when we're not even on them!

DALE

What the fuck is that?!

DALE (CONT'D)

Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell

is that?!

SAUL

It's them!!!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Holy fuck. That was close.

DALE

(clutching cell phone)

You know what? You're right. We should

just get rid of them. We should just

smash `em.

DALE (CONT'D)

Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I

can just take the batteries out?

35

SAUL

No! Smash it!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Shit!

DALE

What the fuck was that?!

SAUL

Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that

tree!

DALE

What tree?

SAUL

That one.

SAUL (CONT'D)

It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free

with the plan. It must've smashed when it

landed.

DALE

Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why

couldn't you have just smashed it on a

rock like a normal person?

SAUL

I was trying to smash it! How often does

a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.

DALE

Did you at least see where it landed?

SAUL

Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could

call it!

DALE

With what? I just smashed my phone!

36

SAUL

Man, it's not like they got McGuyver

workin' on the case. I bet they can't

even triangulate it.

DALE

Well, then you shouldn't have said

anything, cause now you've convinced me

that they can!

SAUL

Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid

thing and get back to doing what we were

doin'.

DALE

Do you see it?

SAUL

Dude, this is the scariest place I've

ever been in my life.

SAUL (CONT'D)

You ever see that movie where all the

people are in the woods and they slowly

get killed?

DALE

The "Blair Witch Project."

SAUL

No...Shit. That one's way scarier than

the one I was thinking of. Mine had

Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm

thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.

DALE

(whispering)

Stop!

SAUL

(whispering)

What-

37

DALE

(whispering)

Sshh!

SAUL

(whispering)

What is-

DALE

(whispering)

Sshh! Can you hear that?

SAUL

(whispering)

What?

DALE

(whispering)

Just listen.

SAUL

(whispering)

I literally hear nothing.

(gasp)

Wait...

DALE

SAUL!!!

SAUL(O.S.)

(screaming in pain)

ARGHHH!!!

38

DALE

Shit.

CRACK

DALE (CONT'D)

AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

SAUL

(muffled through the window)

Let me in! Let me in!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Let's go! Go!

DALE

Is there anyone even out there?!?

SAUL

I don't know!

DALE

If you don't know then why the hell did

you run like that?!?

SAUL

I don't know! I'm freaking out, man!

Let's just go!

39

DALE

No! We're not going anywhere!

SAUL

But there could be something out there!

DALE

There's nothing out there, that's why

we're here. God, man, you scared the

fucking shit out of me.

SAUL

Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm

staying in the car.

RADIO DJ

-white accent walls would go nice with a

dark colored room, say a burnt sienna,

but don't forget...

SAUL

Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why

don't we just shoot ourselves in the

nuts?

DALE

Shut up, okay? It's my car.

SAUL

Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint

before I go to sleep, and don't worry

about it, even though you're being a

dick, it's on the house.

DALE

Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my

own.

SAUL

Thanks to me!

DALE

Shut up.

40

DALE

Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.

SAUL

Fuck me.

DALE

What's the time?

SAUL

(groggy)

It's too early.

SAUL (CONT'D)

It's...

SAUL (CONT'D)

This can't be right.

DALE

What does it say?

SAUL

It says, uh...

SAUL (CONT'D)

It couldn't be three in the morning,

could it?

DALE

It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to

be there at noon!

SAUL

(excited)

Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight

savings!

(beat)

Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour!

Dammit-

41

DALE

It's four o'fucking clock?!

SAUL

-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And

we've gotta call Red.

DALE

(angry)

How?

SAUL

We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number

was in my phone!

DALE

You remember where he lives, right?

SAUL

Yes, I remember. What the hell is that

supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm

forgetful? That's right, I know the word

insinuating.

DALE

Let's just get out of here.

DALE (CONT'D)

What the fuck? Come on.

DALE (CONT'D)

(pissed off)

I think the battery's dead.

SAUL

Are you fucking serious?

DALE

It's dead.

SAUL

It's dead?

42

SAUL (CONT'D)

What the fuck happened? How did this

happen?

DALE

How? We fell asleep!

SAUL

Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No

surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put

people to sleep.

DALE

We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll

walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.

SAUL

For real?

DALE

Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but

we'll get there. Then we can fix this

insane situation.

DALE (CONT'D)

Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave

that thing alone.

SAUL

It's like, my thumb is my cock!

43

SAUL

(to the driver)

Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.

DALE

So, what's this guy like?

SAUL

I don't know. He's short...and stout. So

he's like a tea pot. Hehe.

DALE

Well, do you think he'll be there?

SAUL

I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight

hours late.

(beat)

That's actually pretty late.

RED (O.S.)

(through door)

Who is it?

SAUL

Red! It's Saul. Open up.

RED

(sniffling)

Who's this guy?

DALE

Dale. Nice to meet you.

44

RED

Dale who?

DALE

I think it's    better if you don't know my

last-

SAUL

(oblivious)

Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.

RED

(to Saul)

What happened to your clothes? Where'd

you call me from, man?

SAUL

We were in the forest laying low.

Thinking.

DALE

Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?

SAUL

Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?

RED

What? Oh, I uh...

(feeling his split lip)

...I got a cold sore, I've never got one

before. I started crying.

SAUL

A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?

RED

...uh, yeah, man.

SAUL

Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how

many joints we've shared? I told you,

man. This is from that time you ate the

lollypop straight from the strippers sna-

45

DALE

SAUL

(to Dale)

RED

SAUL

DALE

RED

SAUL

DALE

SAUL

RED

DALE

RED

46

SAUL

Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.

We had a crazy night in the woods, which

I assume we can both put behind us like

grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant

bong to get super-duper high.

RED

Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at

home. I'm just going to use the ol'

telephone-o.

RED (CONT'D)

What the fuck!

DALE

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

SAUL

Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?

DALE

(to Saul)

We can't let him call anyone! He's acting

weird!

RED

Fuck you man - this is my house!

DALE

I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-

SAUL

Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and

paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!

(to Red)

I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought

this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.

47

DALE

(in pain)

AAAHHH!

SAUL

Holy cock!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Dude! He's sorry! Wait!

SAUL (CONT'D)

WHY!?!?!

SAUL (O.S.)

Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is

wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked

off that shit again!?! Ow!

RED (O.S.)

I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please

don't fight!

SAUL

AAAHHHHHH!!!

48

SAUL

Why, man!?! Why!

RED

I'M SORRY!!!

DALE

He's going for the phone! Bathroom!

DALE

(pointing at the phone)

SAUL!!! Phone!!!

SAUL

What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is

going on!?!

RED

I don't know!!! They're going to kill

me!!!

SAUL

You didn't stub your toe, did you?

DALE

Now tell us-

49

RED

They're gonna come back and kill me!!!

SAUL

DALE! HELP!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Red, you motherfucker.

DALE

It's happening! It's actually happening!

He knows my name! Red knows my name!

SAUL

We should beat it out of his sellout

brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck

the Casino! Go alone!

DALE

This is fucked, what do we do now, he

knows my name!?!

SAUL

He knows my name too!

DALE

Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!

SAUL

We're not gonna have to kill him, are we?

I don't think I could do that.

50

SAUL (CONT'D)

Maybe we could talk him into killing

himself, or, like, make him promise not

to tell.

DALE

Well, we have to find out what he knows.

RED

(in great pain)

I don't know anything...you broke my

bong...

DALE

Tell us everything. Now!

SAUL

Don't look at me, you sellout bastard.

Now start talking!

RED

I can't...I don't know anything.

SAUL

What do we do? He's not gonna talk.

DALE

I think we beat it out of him.

SAUL

For real?

DALE

Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't

tell us everything, we're going to beat

you up.

RED

Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!

SAUL

You were Red. Now you're no one to me.

DALE

You've got five seconds, okay? Ready?

Five, four-

51

RED

Please don't.

DALE

Three, two...one!

RED

That didn't hurt.

SAUL

You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard,

man. Like, fucking hit him!

RED

Wait! I...I...

RED (CONT'D)

No!

RED (CONT'D)

Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it.

Listen...two...two guys came here,

they...they were here when you called-

SAUL

Seriously?

DALE

Who were they?

RED

They work for Ted. Budlofsky and

Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They

were here all day, but you guys didn't

show. They said they'd kill me if I

didn't bring you to them, they said I'd-

52

DALE

How many cops does he have in his...uh,

payroll, or whatever?

RED

I know there's this lady cop. He could

have more, I don't know. He's got pretty

crazy connections. He's also got a cool-

ass hideout. It's crazy man.

RED (CONT'D)

Listen, I-

DALE

Who's his competition?

RED

The Asians!

DALE

Asians? Which Asians? Indians are

technically Asian.

RED

The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just

calls them the Asians.

SAUL

What else?

RED

I swear to god that's all I know...I

swear...

DALE

Alright. We should...tie him up and...and

get the fuck out of here.

SAUL

I made a gravity bong here once. I know

where his duct tape is.

53

SAUL (CONT'D)

Come on, let's tape this piece of shit

up.

SAUL (CONT'D)

I can't find the edge.

DALE

What?

SAUL

I can't find the, oh...wait...

SAUL (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Shit. They're actually here to kill him.

DALE

(whispering)

What do we do?

SAUL

(whispering)

I don't know.

DALE

(whispering)

Fuck. Oh, man.

RED

(whispering)

Guys, guys...listen to me-

RED (CONT'D)

(whispering)

I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm

a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before

hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes.

You know what I mean. But I can fix this.

(MORE)

54

RED (CONT'D)

I know these guys, it's cool. Just head

out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell

`em nothing. You can count on me!

SAUL

Thanks, Red.

RED

Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude

named Dale Denton! They just ran out the

back!

SAUL

In here!

DALE

No. I've got to get to a phone!

SAUL

We should hide!

DALE

But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name,

then they'll go to my apartment and find

out about Angie!

SAUL

I think we should stay!

DALE

Why?!

SAUL

Because I'm in the dumpster already!

Shit! Fine!

55

BUDLOFSKY

They're long gone.

TED (O.S.)

Find out what he knows.

MATHESON

Red, you gonna tell us anything helpful?

RED

I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale

Denton's the other guys name. He was with

Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do

you want?

MATHESON

You hear that?

TED

Ask if either of them were Asian.

MATHESON

Hey. What skin color were these guys?

RED

What? Um...white, they're both white. I

think Denton might be a Jew, but I

couldn't really tell.

MATHESON

You hear that, Ted?

TED (O.S.)

Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill

Red.

RED

(clutching his bleeding gut)

Oh fuck...you shot me, you motherfucker!

Fuckin' Matheson...fuck you! You've eaten

dinner here, man! Tacos! And now I'm

gonna fuckin' die from this, probably.

Get the fuck out of my house!

56

TED

Fuck.

TED (CONT'D)

Carol, there's another name to run. Dale

Denton.

CAROL

Does he have something to do with our

friend in there?

TED

If the Asians have the balls to send an

assassin right into my home, we can't be

too cautious. The boys say Denton and

Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their

assassin failed, they hired this outside

guy Denton to finish the job.

(pondering)

Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned

"going to the casino."

CAROL

"Going to the casino"? I don't like that.

CUT TO:

57

CAROL (O.S.)

(through one of the Asian

mens ear piece)

I'll be back in an hour with everything

there is on Dale Denton. He'll be dead by

the time we make our pick-up tomorrow.

SAUL

(gasping and   wheezing)

But my parents live   in Canada. You don't

think they're going   to go to Canada, do

you? How would they   get a Canadian phone

book even?

DALE

(gasping and wheezing)

All I know is Angie's new number is on my

fridge and they could see that, so I have

to get to her.

SAUL

My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go

after her, would they? She's got a

different last name. Belogus.

ANSWERING MACHINE

(Dale's voice)

" cough  It's Dale. I'm probably at work,

maybe we'll talk later.  BEEP "

MATHESON

Budlofsky!

58

DALE

Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a

minute.

SAUL

Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I

want to go with you!

DALE

Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally

be five minutes. Please.

SAUL

Fine. But hurry.

DALE

Angie!

ANGIE

It's Dale! You came.

SHANNON

Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and

have some couscous. Can I get you a

drink?

59

ROBERT

What the hell happened to you?

ANGIE

Dale?   What happened to you?

DALE

Nothing, I was in the woods and...

(turns to Angie's parents)

...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to

finally meet you both...I apologize for

my appearance. Robert, Charlotte-

SHANNON

(not amused)

Shannon.

DALE

Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both

of you.

DALE (CONT'D)

Very nice things.

ANGIE

You were in the woods?

DALE

(at a loss for words)

Alright, now, here's what's happened -

I've been thrust into a kind of,

ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all

just start to evacuate...

DALE (CONT'D)

...that'd be really, really good right

now. I'll answer all your-

ANGIE

Is this a joke?

ROBERT

What is this Angie?

60

SHANNON

I think it is a joke.

DALE

(deep breath)

Listen. There are people after us and

they could come here. I'll tell you

anything you want, just please, let's go!

ROBERT

He's serious?

DALE

Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have

to get the "F" out of here!

ROBERT

Get the hell out of my house.

DALE

Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal

- I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I

was working...this morning. The cop shot

the guy then saw my car drive off, and I

think they might have seen my license

plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the

woods, so...

SAUL

No fucking way.

ANGIE

Who are these people? Why are they-

61

DALE

I think their drug dealers.

ANGIE

(on the verge of tears)

Why?

DALE

Well, it's complicated. See,

the...uh...it doesn't matter right now,

we just have to get out of here.

ANGIE

Let's go to the police!

DALE

No, they are the police!

ROBERT

I'm getting my gun.

SHANNON

Robert! No!

ROBERT

We bought it for a reason!

SAUL

(completely out of breath)

You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's

happening!

ANGIE

EEEHHHH!!!

SAUL

ARGGG!!!

ANGIE

(freaking out)

Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!

SAUL

No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S-

62

DALE

Angie! Stop! It's Saul!

SHANNON

What did you do, Angie?!

SAUL

Ow!! Fuck. Now I'm gonna need a tetanus

shot! They fuckin' kill. Fuck!

ANGIE

Saul? Dale, who is-

SAUL

Dale, they're coming!

BUDLOFSKY

Fuck! What the hell?

MATHESON

Get out your fucking gun!

BUDLOFSKY

What the fuck is going on?

DALE

Stop! Stop! He's with me!

SAUL

Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy

fuck!

63

ANGIE

Dad, put the gun down!

SHANNON

Robert, what's going on?

ROBERT

Just nobody move, okay? Except Shannon

and Angie. So, you two don't move!

SHANNON

Oh my god.

DALE

Sir, please, he's my friend, he's helping

me, he's-

SAUL

Stop shooting, man! I'm Dale's dealer

DALE

Guys! Please! We have to get out of here.

Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson-

SAUL

(whispers to Dale)

It's Shannon.

DALE

I know! Look, we have to get out of here.

I'm sure everything is going to be fine

but better safe than...not.

SHANNON

Is this...for real-

DALE

Yes. Terribly real.

64

MATHESON

Ready?

BUDLOFSKY

No. One sec.

MATHESON

Hurry the fuck up.

BUDLOFSKY

Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't

helping.

MATHESON

Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these

people doing?

SAUL

Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed

potatoes in my wound.

ROBERT

Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the

car!

ANGIE

Dale - get in the car!

ROBERT

(to Dale)

You stay the fuck away from my family!

65

ANGIE

Shut up dad!

DALE

(glances at Robert)

I...I think it would be best if I didn't

go with you. I don't want to put you in

any more danger.

ANGIE

What are you going to do? What should we

do?

ROBERT

Angie, get in the car!

DALE

Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to

the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake

name. Something like...

(looks around, focuses on

Robert's car)

Car...lyle.

ANGIE

Carlyle?

(beat)

I...I have so many questions. I

just...how can this be happening?

Where...where are you going?

DALE

I have to stop this. I don't know how,

but don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

(beat)

But still, watch your back. You never

know where they might be, whoever they

are.

DALE (CONT'D)

I love you.

ANGIE

Uh...thanks.

66

DALE

Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you

guys.

SAUL

Why aren't we in that car?

DALE

Let's run, man! Run!

SAUL

Huff   Huff  Where are we running?

DALE

Somewhere we can think.

CAROL

A fork?

TED

A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house.

And the blood was fresh.

CAROL

Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.

TED

Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us.

What the fuck is going on!

(a frustrated beat)

Any luck with the cell phones?

CAROL

They smashed one and left the other one

in the woods to distract us. Took us an

hour to find it. And we found Denton's

car, which was filled with all these

strange disguises. These guys are for

real.

67

TED

I want to talk to the Asians. Get me

Cheung's number. Now.

INTERCUT WITH:

CHEUNG

(in Korean)

Hello?

TED

Cheung. It's Ted.

CHEUNG

(in Korean)

Record this conversation.

CHEUNG (CONT'D)

(perfect English)

Ted. This is surprising. What would you

like?

TED

Cheung, I want you to call off your man

Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout,

assassin, and frankly I don't care. I

just want him gone. I want him dead. If

you do this, I'll consider it a peace

offering, otherwise, you're asking for

war. And just in case you forgot, I'm

number one, and there's a reason for

that. You've got 24 hours to reply.

68

CHEUNG

Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin

failed to kill him, but it did rattle his

confidence. It's earlier than planned,

but we should strike now, while he is

confused. Let it be known-

CHEUNG (CONT'D)

-Li-Youngs death will not be in vain.

SAUL

Victory joint complete. Here ya go.

DALE

"Tell us what you know!" How fuckin'

balls was that?

SAUL

Like, really balls.

DALE

And I think I fought pretty well, don't

you? You know, for my first time. We were

like Tango and Cash, man.

SAUL

Or Scarface!

DALE

BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's

hinges!

SAUL

And you probably saved Angie, which is

fucking pimp.

69

DALE

I probably couldn't have done it without

you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.

SAUL

We're in this together, right? So, ya

know.

DALE

Thanks, man.

(beat)

You know, my last dealer was a total

dick. You're by far the coolest dealer

I've ever had.

SAUL

(sincerely)

Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate

that.

DALE

Yeah...like, the time before last time, I

totally had weed. I just kind of wanted

to chill with you.

SAUL

(over-joyed)

Really? That's awesome, man. That means a

lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes

come in to buy and pretend to be all

buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm

always, like, "you don't like me, you

like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You

know? And just so you know, I totally

could have lit that cross-joint on my

own. I'd just have to use candles, but,

like, I've never smoked one of those with

anyone before.

DALE

So, do you think we should leave town? We

could just get on a bus and go, right?

SAUL

We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't

think that could even pay for one ticket.

70

DALE

What about your sack?

SAUL

Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.

DALE

(laughing)

No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell

some?

SAUL

Of course. That's my bread and butter. We

just have to go to a highschool. It's the

easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is

like, a block a way.

DALE

No way, man. I'm not going to sell to

kids.

SAUL

Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere.

I mean, we got it from guys like us.

DALE

Well, then not kids at that school.

SAUL

Well, there's a bunch of private ones

nearby, but they're into way crazier shit

than weed-

DALE

I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a

high school is there anywhere else we

could go?

SAUL

(thinks, then-)

We could go to Crackhead Park.

DALE

What's that?

SAUL

It's a park. Really close, actually. Full

of crackheads. They smoke weed too,

though.

71

SAUL

Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some

weed, or, like, what?

SAUL (CONT'D)

See, that's the problem around here.

Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle

attention span. You gotta wow `em.

(beat)

Hey! Who wants some weed!?!

DALE

Fuck this place.

SAUL

Alright. You gimme all your money, you

74

DALE

There are still people trying to kill us.

SAUL

But at least now we can afford to run.

I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.

Let's have us a little mardi-gras

fiesta.

POLICE LIAISON

Don't move!

POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D)

Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in

your hand?

DALE.

I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid

of it right away, I was just smoking

this. I...I thought it was

decriminalized. Or something. For medical

purposes. I have epilepsy.

POLICE LIAISON

Selling pot to my students isn't

"decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer

for this school and I just caught four

students showing off handfuls of

marijuana to their friends. They told me

they got it back here. Put your hands up.

DALE

Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I

have is this little joint.

75

POLICE LIAISON

You call this little?

DALE

I don't even have any money! How did I

sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I

was just smoking it. I swear. Please.

POLICE LIAISON

It's possible you're telling the truth.

I'm going to run a check and if it turns

out you don't have any priors and all

you've got is this small amount of

marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.

Take a seat.

SAUL

They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh

fuck...

CAROL

(smiling)

Denton.

76

DALE

What is this for? What did that thing

tell you? What did I do?

POLICE LIAISON

Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,

actually. You hit two parked cars two

nights ago.

SAUL

The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.

DALE

You don't understand! You have to let me

go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!

DALE (CONT'D)

This...this lady cop, and these guys

Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for

Ted Jones, and-

POLICE LIAISON

(suddenly interested)

Ted Jones?

DALE

Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know

what I'm talking about. He lives near

Evergreen Heights. He-

77

POLICE LIAISON

Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and

a police office shoot someone?

DALE

Yeah. An Asian someone.

POLICE LIAISON

Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you

down to the station.

DALE

(ecstatic)

Yes ma'am.

POLICE LIAISON

Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!

DALE

NO! What are you doing!?!

78

SAUL

Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and

Cash!

POLICE LIAISON

Freeze mister! Don't even...

DALE

No! She was going to help us!

SAUL

(in pain)

Oh...my balls...I seriously think I

popped one...

DALE

(horrified)

IT'S HER! The lady cop!

SAUL

(motion at the Police

Liaison)

Then who's that?

SAUL (CONT'D)                      DALE

SAUL

The slurpee! I can't see!

79

DALE

Turn on the wipers!

SAUL

Dude, I seriously can't see!

DALE

Kick out the window! Isn't that what they

do?

SAUL

I don't know. Okay.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Oh fuck! Shit!

DALE

Get it out of there!

SAUL

Ah! Ah! My leg!

DALE

(hysterical)

She's following us! She's gaining on us!

SAUL

Her car's better!

SAUL (CONT'D)

Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!

80

DALE

Do something!

SAUL

Hold on. I've got an idea.

DALE

WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?

SAUL

Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd

keep going.

DALE

Turn on the sirens!

SAUL                          DALE

81

SAUL

Run!

DALE

Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!

DALE (CONT'D)

You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!

SAUL

So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'

sorry... huff ...forgot...

DALE

Don't touch me, you asshole!

82

SAUL

Okay, only one way to do this, hard and

fast. Bend over.

DALE

Ow! Ow! Hurry!

SAUL

I am!

DALE

Which saw do you like most?

SAUL

The brown ones nice, but the metallic

ones seems more...

CUT TO:

DALE

(relieved)

Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be

right back.

SAUL

A thank you would be nice!

DALE

Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room,

please?

83

ANGIE

Dale?

DALE

Angie! Thank god you're okay!

ANGIE

I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay?

DALE

I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So,

here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave

town and contact a government official or

something. From somewhere safe. I know

this shit is all fucked up and I just

can't apologize enough.

ANGIE

Dale. I've realized some problems and-

DALE

I know there's a problem! That's the

thing, that's why I-

ANGIE

Dale, shut up and listen. People are

trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug

dealers are trying to kill me, because of

you! It's fucking over, man. Are you

kidding me? For gods sake...

DALE

Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was

thrown into this situation, I had no

control, but I am dealing with it. This

kind of thing happens, you know-

ANGIE

NO! IT DOESN"T!

(beat)

You're immature, Dale! I'm six years

younger and I'm saying this! And the fact

that you think you're some kind of

fucking genius just makes it a hundred

times more infuriating!

84

DALE

What? You're telling me you think I'm a

dumb guy?

ANGIE

You're not how you think you are Dale,

and it's pathetic. Call me when I can go

home.

SAUL

Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry

again about the clocks.

(beat)

Ha! What a douche bag.

(beat)

Yeah, love you too.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta

go see my grandma, okay? She was worried

`cause I didn't show up to help with the

locks. But before that I've got to smoke

another bowl.

DALE

Are you joking? You're actually gonna

smoke marijuana?

SAUL

Why not?

DALE

How can you smoke marijuana after what we

just went through? That clearly happened

because we were smoking marijuana.

SAUL

No. It happened because those fucking

kids didn't keep that shit on the down

low. Which is weird, `cause they really

seemed like cool kids.

85

DALE

If you haven't noticed, we're not very

functional when we're stoned, Saul.

SAUL

When I saved you with those Slurpees I

was stoned. What do you gotta say to

that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the

creative capacity to come up with such a

great plan! The Beatles were high!

DALE

You didn't save me! She was going to

protect us, and now we're wanted for all

sorts of crazy shit!

DALE (CONT'D)

Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how

"Scarface" ends. Face down, dead, in your

own fuckin' water fountain.

SAUL

For one thing, I'm done dealing pot.

Mostly, because I don't know where I

would get it now, but still. And "b",

fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're

exactly the same, and this whole thing's

your fucking fault. You're the one who

dropped the roach!

DALE

It's not my fault!

DALE (CONT'D)

It's marijuana's fault!

SAUL

Stop calling it marijuana!

DALE

Grow up, you fucking two year old.

SAUL

See! This is why you're a douche bag,

Denton. Because you think you're better

than others, but you're just a dumb

pothead burnout, same as me.

86

DALE

Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at

least I'm not the dumbest most annoying

guy in the world. The only reason I ever

bought weed from you was because you're

shit is so good, not because you're cool.

SAUL

But you said you bought when you already

had a few times, just to hang out?

DALE

Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots

of different kinds of weed at once.

SAUL

Here. Buy yourself a good last meal.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Super size it, bitch.

DALE

Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all

that! Saul!

CAROL

Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was

amazing.

TED

This is not good. We should have this

under control. We haven't heard shit from

the Asians. Got these lunatics after us.

Shit.

87

CAROL

We should probably get to the farm.

ELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.)

Solly?

SAUL

Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!

SAUL (CONT'D)

HOLY SHIT!!!

MATHESON

Eat it!

INJURED PERSON

OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!

MRS. CORBER

Solly Silver?!?

SAUL

Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!

89

MATHESON

AHH!!! FUCK!!!

SAUL

(wheezing)

NOOO!!!

BUDLOFSKY

Yeah!

OLD WOMAN

Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye.

Poor, poor Faye.

DALE

Hey, uh, what's going on here?

OLD MAN

It just happened.

DALE

What did?

OLD WOMAN

Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from

right inside the building. We all saw it.

They fought in the majong room and hurt

the new nurse, Stefan.

DALE

Uh...thanks.

OLD MAN

If I was there, I would've kicked an ass.

90

DALE

Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's

going to be fine.

SAUL

ARRGGGHHH!!!

SAUL (CONT'D)

(whispers to himself)

Fuck. I regret everything.

BUDLOFSKY

Get up.

SAUL

Oh fuck. That looks painful.

SAUL (CONT'D)

EEEHH!!!

91

BUDLOFSKY

Don't. Ted wants him.

MATHESON

Fine.

SAUL

(breath-taken)

El Dorado.

SAUL (CONT'D)

Dude, look at all this weed.

MATHESON

Shut the fuck up and keep moving.

SAUL

What the hell is that?

SAUL (CONT'D)

Ow.

92

DALE

Hello? Anyone here? Red?

DALE (CONT'D)

Oh my god.

RED

(a little out of it)

What? Who the fuck!

RED (CONT'D)

Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do

shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya

once, tool ya again!

DALE

(utterly shocked)

I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I-

RED

Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired.

RED (CONT'D)

I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right

here-

(he points at his wound)

(MORE)

93

RED (CONT'D)

I'm having a little going away party and

I don't remember inviting you,

cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to

leave. In my dying moments, I don't want

some asshole I barely know around.

DALE

Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy.

You don't have to die.

RED

Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm

gonna end up in But that doesn't matter

`cause once Ted finds out, which he will,

I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked

through and through. Now if you'd be

willing to give a dying man his wish,

could ya run on into the other room and

pop in disc two of Tu Pacs "All Eyez On

Me". I want to listen to it while I die.

DALE

You don't have to die.

RED

Will you stop saying that, I've excepted

it, man. I'm at peace.  cough

DALE

Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's

base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail

on him. I'm going to get him back.

RED

Fuckin eh, amigo.

RED (CONT'D)

Blaze of glory, motherfucker.

94

RED

This is awesome! We're so gonna show

those motherfuckers. Think they can kill

me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll.

DALE

What are you doing?

RED

So, this is the backside of the farm. If

you stay low in the grass you should be

fine. If someone is shooting at you with

an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes

you harder to hit.

DALE

You're not coming to help?

RED

Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I

was in shock before, but the air on the

drive cleared my mind, I should get to

the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs,

right? I got shot in the best spot

possible. I could have a long and

fruitful life ahead of me. Full of

possibilities. Go get `em, slugger.

DALE

But how do I get out of here if I rescue

Saul?

RED

I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that

hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or

just take it or whatever. Good luck,

amigo!

95

DALE

I'll blow his fuckin' brains out if you

don't-

DALE (CONT'D)

Oh my god.

THUG 2

What the fuck was that, Budlofsky?

BUDLOFSKY

Haven't you seen "Speed"? "Shoot the

hostage".

THUG 2

In the leg, you fucking moron!

BUDLOFSKY

Still worked.

BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)

Throw him in with the other guy, and

everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch

outside. This is fucked up. Somethings

going down.

THUG 3

I think he's got a gun.

BUDLOFSKY

What?

96

BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)

You're kidding me, right? Die Hard?

DALE

I had to try.

THUG 3 (O.S.)

Hey! He's got another one taped to his

stomach!

THUG 4 (O.S.)

And his leg!

SAUL

Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me

out, you shitty bastard? That what

happened?

DALE

No! I came here to save you!

SAUL

To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're

caught, too. And now I have to die with

some asshole.

DALE

Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked

you. You're right, this whole things my

fault, and they only way I can make it up

to you is by rescuing you, and that's why

I'm here. To save my friend.

SAUL

Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me

and I'll consider forgiving you for this

mad shit.

DALE

Good. `Cause I will.

97

SAUL

Oh really? What, you forget to tell me

you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you

got some kind of secret blowtorch

strapped to your dick? We're not gonna

escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners,

and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!

DALE

We're not losers! We did that car chase.

That was all you, man! You got away from

the cops. I've watched, like, nine

billion hours of worlds wildest police

chases and I've never seen a guy get

away. Not once! But you did it. You did

the impossible.

MATHESON

We can hear you out there, and it's

annoying. Shut the fuck up.

DALE

(whispering)

Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my

belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do

it! This is it!

DALE (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Hurry!

DALE (CONT'D)

(hushed)

Yes! Yes! You know what this is called,

Saul? This is called saving you.

98

TED

You have them?

BUDLOFSKY

Got them downstairs.

CAROL

Where did you find them?

BUDLOFSKY

We found Saul at his grandmother's and

Dale Denton busted in here like a madman,

armed to the teeth, and-

BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)

Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I

disarmed him. We got `em both holed up

downstairs.

TED

He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank.

CAROL

Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

TED

Well, we'll torture these two bastards

and find out everything they know. What

about the shipment? Ready to move out?

BUDLOFSKY

We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.

99

DALE

This isn't working. Turn around. I'm

using my mouth.

SAUL

(whispering)

Someone's coming!

DALE

(whispering)

Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a

move, if I cough twice, you take the

lead. Got it?

SAUL

(whispering)

What? No! What if you actually cough?

MATHESON

Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it,

okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut

it-

DALE

I don't know! That guy just blew half my

fucking ear off!

SAUL

There's some dudes in here. I saw them

when I got dragged down. And there's some

kind of super-suit or something.

DALE

Were they armed?

SAUL

(whispering)

I don't think so.

DALE

I can't hear them.

SAUL

You could boost me up! We'll sneak out.

DALE

Shoot back!

DALE

You'll never be able to pull me up, but

I'll boost you up there and you just

fucking run for it, man.

SAUL

What? No fucking way, Dale. What about

DALE

Don't worry about me.

SAUL

No fucking way. Seriously?

How did that happen?

DALE

I have absolutely no idea.

SAUL

They were fighting Asian dudes, man.

DALE

Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is

revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted

kill.

SAUL

So we're, like, in a drug war. That's

cool.

DALE

What's cool is that you came back for me

man. You did, right? You weren't just

captured again, were you?

SAUL

Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the

Work at a bong shop.
