FINAL DESTINATION 2

By J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress

KIMBERLY

Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.

MR. BU RROUGHS

You have everything, Kimberly?

Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?

KIMBERLY

Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not

Mongolia.

MR. BURROUGHS

(playful)

Fix -A-flat? Road flares?

Sunblock? Mace?

SHAINA (O.S.)

Condoms, handcuffs, lube?

SHAINA

Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry,

I'll keep an eye on her.

MR. BURROUGHS

(sarcastic)

Oh, that makes me feel a lot

better.

KIMBERLY

I know this is the first time we've

been apart since. But everything's

gonna be okay.

MR. BURROUGHS

I know, honey. I just --

MR. BURROUGHS

Your mother would have been so

proud of the way you've handled

yourself through all of this...

KIMBERLY

(softly)

I know, Dad.

SHAINA (O.S.)

Hello, the guys are waiting!

MR. BURROUGHS

Buckle up!

SHAINA (O.S.)

Watch it!

KIMBERLY

Sorry!   My fault!

SHAINA

Want me to drive?

KIMBERLY

No, I'm good.

FRANKIE

Dano, shouldn't we go back and help

your mother?

DANO

Blo w me.

FOOTBALL PLAYERS

Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up!

DANO

Christ, is this tribute to Princess

Di Day or what?

KIMBERLY

(unnerved)

Jesus, all the crazies are out

today.

KIMBERLY

I told you no drugs in the car!    My

dad will freak!

DANO

(laughs)

Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs,

just weed.

FRANKIE

Yeah, you should have specified.

MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)

Kimberly? It's Dad.

KIMBERLY

Hey, Dad. What's up?

MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)

Your car's leaking either

transmission or brake fluid. I

want you to have it checked ASAP at

a gas station.

KIMBERLY

You got it, Dad. I'll call you if

I have a problem.

MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)

I mean it. Take care of it.

KIMBERLY

I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.

SHAINA

Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna

call like every ten minutes is he?

DANO

(hiding bag of weed in

pants)

Shit! There's a cop behind us.

Pull into the right lane now!

DANO

Look first, idiot!

SHAINA

Ignore 'em.

KIMBERLY

Dano, put that out NOW.

KAT

No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I

won't be able to pitch the

campaign. Let's get Silverstein to

come in and...

KAT

What the hell?     No,   not you.

DANO

What's the cop doing?      Did he see

that?

KAT

Forget it, I'll call him myself.

THOMAS

I was supposed to be off today.

How did I get screwed?

DISPATCHER (O.S.)

No biggie. Drake called in sick.

THOMAS

Copy that.

(switches off; annoyed)

Go on, sleep it off Drake.

FRANKIE

Relax, dude.

KIMBERLY

This trip better be wor th it.

What's the guy- girl ratio again?

SHAINA

Get ready to smile, five guys per

girl.

KIMBERLY

I can live with thaaaa --

FRANKIE

What's your problem, ya fuckin'

crack baby?!

ISABELLA

...couldn't Keep your dick in check

for another month? I knew this

would happen when I got pregnant.

ISABELLA

What'd the doctor say? I have to

come in to test for STDs? Goddamn

you, Jorge.

FRANKIE

Gas it around these idiots. We do

have 1200 miles to go, you know.

NORA

Tim, will you cut that out? I

can't even hear myself think.

TIM

Damn, it really hurts, Mom.

NORA

I know, we'll be there soon.

FRANKIE

(yells to driver)

Ever hear of the Ozone layer,

asshole?

THOMAS

Son of a bitch.

FRANKIE

A Trans Am. That shit went out

with New Kids on the Block.

DANO

Yeah. Who does he think he is?

Knight Rider?

FRANKIE

(laughs; then)

Who?

DANO

You know, Hasselhoff before he did

Baywatch.

KIMBERLY

What's the chance of finding a nice

mature guy once we get to Daytona?

SHAINA

How does a nice mature fuck sound?

KIMBERLY

Hey, thanks for talking    me into

this trip. Ever since     my mom... I

dunno, I just feel like    I'm

starting to live again,    you know?

DANO (O.S.)

Flight 180. You know, that plane

crash with those kids from Mount

Abraham.

FRANKIE

Dano, shouldn't we stop and help

your mother?

DANO

Blow me. Yellow means go,

Kimberly.

KIMBERLY

Oh my god, oh my god...

SHAINA

What is it? What are you?

KIMBERLY

There's going to be a huge

accident! Everyone's gonna die.

All of us! I saw it!

FRANKIE

That's it. My turn to drive.

DANO (O.S.)

Flight 180. Y'know, that plane

crash with those kids from Mt.

Abraham?

FRANKIE

Dano, shouldn't we stop and help

your mother?

DANO

Blow me.    Yellow means go, Kimmy.

KIMBERLY

Oh my God, oh my God...

SHAINA

What is it? What are you?

KIMBERLY

There's going to be a huge

accident! Everyone's gonna die,

all of us, I saw it!

FRANKIE

That's it. My turn to drive.

SHAINA

Relax, you need to chill the fuck

out.

KIMBERLY

Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.

SHAINA

For Christ sakes girl, take a

breath.

D.J. (O.S.)

Taking you into an all request

weekend with a classic from AC/DC.

DANO

What the hell are you doing?

DANO

Five-O's coming!   Let's fucking

roll, man!

FRANKIE

Jesus Christ! Here he comes!

Move!

KIMBERLY

No!   We'll all die if we do!

DANO

I told you she'd ruin everything!

SHAINA

Shut up, Dano, just stay cool.

(to Kimberly)

He's just stoned.

THOMAS

What's going on here?

KIMBERLY

(incoherent, through

tears)

There's going to be a pile up.

Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it

happen. It happened.

THOMAS

Miss, please step out of the

vehicle.

ISABELLA

Excuse me, but is there some way we

could just drive around? I have a

delivery.

ISABELLA

Hey hon, you got a mysterious

caller on the answering machine

from Planned Parenthood. What's

going on?

NORA

What on Earth are they doing?

TIM

(picking up two Naya

bottles)

Who am I, David Blane?

TIM

(good-natured laughter)

Okay, quit it already.

KIMBERLY

(trying to calm herself)

The radio played the same songs,

the old lady's bag broke the exact

same way it did in my premonition.

KIMBERLY

THAT's the truck that's going to

kill everyone!

THOMAS

Alright miss, calm down. I just

need this lane open. I need you to

pull your vehicle onto the

shoulder!

KIMBERLY

You're not listening to me!   You

have to do something!

EVAN

Arrest this whack-job, wouldja?

Some of us have lives, y'know.

KIMBERLY

Why won't anyone listen to me?

THOMAS

I'm not going to tell you to calm

down again --

ISABELLA

You couldn't keep your dick in

check for a month?!

KAT

Great, now I'm really gonna be

late.

THOMAS

L.A. 51, I need assistance and

requesting paramedics for a major

T.A. At --

SHAINA

Kimberly, what's going on?

EVAN

I don't know what you want from me.

Some crazy chic k blocks the highway

with her car, said there'd be an

accident and there was. Big deal.

Even a broken watch is right twice

a day...

KAT

Not to sound insensitive, but how

much longer is this going to take?

EUGENE

If I don't get back to my classroom

soon, the kids'll tear the room

apart.

NORA

Those poor people. To think it

would've been us if not for...

THOMAS

Tell me again how it started.

KIMBERLY

Like I said, it was like I was

there. I remember everything. The

sounds of the crashes, the smells,

the look on Shaina's face...

THOMAS

Do you remember what triggered it

all?

KIMBERLY

The log truck...and everybody I

guess. Everyone was driving like a

maniac. And somehow I knew

something horrible was going to

happen, even before it did.

THOMAS

You knew? You just mean a hunch,

right? A bad vibe, maybe?

KIMBERLY

More than that. All the songs on

the radio were about car crashes.

Some kid's banging toy cars

together.

(lookin g at her)

She was dialing her cell phone with

her headset on.

(points to Rory)

His car was leaking oil all over

the road.

RORY

Hey, don't be knockin' the

Chevette.

KIMBERLY

Billboards about accidents. Kids

yelling "pile up" for no reason.

It all felt...just wrong.

Just like...

(swallows; hesitates)

THOMAS

Like what?

KIMBERLY

I know this sounds crazy...but you

all heard about Flight 180, right?

The kid who got off the plane?

THOMAS

You mean Alex Browning.

KIMBERLY

(looking down)

...My Premonition was just like

his.

NORA

What are you talking about?

EUGENE

(sarcastic)

Oh, you must have read about that

kid who had a dream about a plane

crash so he got his buddies off the

plane? Then the thing blew up just

like in the dream?

NORA

Maybe...

EUGENE

But this is where it starts to get

freaky. So a month goes by,

everything seems cool, but then the

survivors start dying one boy one.

'Cause when your number's up, it's

up, right? Some people said Death

itself started coming for them,

hunting down every last one, until

they were all dead.

THOMAS

Well, not quite all of them. Clear

Rivers checked herself into a

padded room at Stoneybrook.

KIMBERLY

You do believe me, don't you?

DETECTIVE SUBY

Officer Burke? Could I see you in

here?

DETECTIVE SUBY

Tell me you didn't start up on that

Flight 180 shit again.

(beat)

Did you?

THOMAS

Of course not. That would be

irresponsible and unprofessional.

THOMAS

Look, you weren't there. It was

weird. She knew that log truck was

gonna cause an accident, she knew.

(beat)

Never mind.

DETECTIVE SUBY

I thought we we re finished with

this bullshit. This is police

work, not the psychic Hot Line.

KIMBER LY

But if I was never meant to pull

over, then we all should have died

in the pile up.

TIM

Which means Death could be coming

for us.

DETECTIVE SUBY

Way to console the witnesses Burke.

DETECTIVE SUBY

You got 'em thinking Death is after

them? Shit, they're the luckiest

sons o' bitches on the planet. Get

this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday

the kid wins the lotto and today

some looney bitch b locks traffic

and he avoids the worst pile up in

years. I should be so damn

unlucky.

KAT

What if it's true? What if it's

happening all over again?

NORA

You're all certifiable, you know

that? I can't believe I've been

listening to this crap. Come on,

Tim, let's go outside.

TIM

Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

EUGENE

Look lady, we're just yankin' your

chain.

RORY

Yeah, you're acting like we all

just got the Diff'rent Strokes

curse or something.

NORA

What's wrong with you people?

MR. BURROUGHS

Kimberly...

MR. BURROUGHS

Can I take her home?

DETECTIVE SUBY

Sure, you can all go.

KAT

First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now

this nonsense.

RORY

Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya,

but I've been over this X-Files

shit since the sixth season.

KIMBERLY

I know it's crazy, but I'm really

scared for the others. I've got

this terrible feeling.

MR. BURROUGHS

What feeling?

KIMBERLY

That it's not over yet.

MR. BURROUGHS

Don 't worry. Everything will be

fine, you'll see.

EVAN

Motherfucker.

VOICE (O.S.)

Dude! You suck! You buy one

fucking ticket in your whole life

and win twenty grand? We're going

whoring in Prague, you know this!

(whisper)

Hold on, the boss is coming.

EVAN

Damn it!

EVAN

Come on, come on...

EVAN

Jesus Christ!

DETECTIVE SUBY

(as if entranced)

Ooooh, I see it now. Your

future... A transfer to another

department.

THOMAS

You've made your point.

DETECTIVE SUBY

Good. Cause we just got some new

info and I don't ne ed you getting

freaky on me.

THOMAS

What?

DETECTIVE SUBY

Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he

wasn't as lucky as we thought.

KAT

No, Mom. Just turn on any station,

they've been playing it all day.

(beat; rolls her eyes)

Yes, Mother. Channel four will do

just fine. Here it is, gotta go.

ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)

Route 18 was backed up for almost

nine hours today when a record

breaking pile up...

ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)

...killed An estimated 18 people.

Emergency crews spent hours sifting

through the wreckage.

ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)

...hoping To recover any survivors

from this tragic collision. So

far, the police are refusing to

release the names of the victims

until their families are notified.

ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)

The camera of a highway patrol car

managed to catch this shocking

footage --

MR. BURROUGHS

My Lord...

KIMBERLY

Don't.   I have to see this.

RORY

Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right

there? That's my fuckin' car right

there! Oh God, that's dope.

ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)

In other news, a freak accident

took the life of a lotto winner.

NORA

Come on, Tim, lights out already.

TIM

Mom?

NORA

Yeah?

TIM

You think... You think those guys

were b.s.-ing us today or what?

NORA

Oh, please. Some people just need

some serious rewiring, that's all.

NORA

Get some sleep.

NORA

Officer Burke, please?

KIMBERLY

It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten

anymore.

MR. BURROUGHS

I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that

you're safe.

KIMBERLY

I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight.

MR. BURROUGHS

You know, after your mother died...

MR. BURROUGHS

There were so many times I didn't

think I could last another day. I

can't even tell you some of the

things I th ought about.

KIMBERLY

I used to have those feelings, too.

But that's when I'd think of Mom.

Her strength...and courage. And

I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to

be as brave as she was. And the

bad thoughts would go away.

MR. BURROUGHS

(choking up)

I don't know what I'd do if I lost

you.

PHYSICIAN

...at the request of the patient,

you are to relinquish any sharp

objects such as nail files,

pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby

pins, no matches, lighters, belts,

belt buckles, earrings, chokers,

shoelaces...

PHYSICIAN

...paper clips, watches, food,

drinks, keys, poisons, pills and

medications.

(looks at Kimberly)

You have a cell phone on you?

PHYSICIAN

Then I think we're all done.

KIMBERLY

Wait. Is she...dangerous or

something?

PHYSICIAN

No honey, but she expects you are.

KIMBERLY

Jesus, how long are you going to

keep her locked up this way?

PHYSICIAN

Depends on her, I guess.   She's

voluntary.

KIMBERLY

Clear Rivers?

CLEAR

Kimberly Burroughs, eh?    What do

you want?

KIMBERLY

I thought...I thought you might be

able to help me.

CLEAR

(snicker)

Yeah, how?

KIMBERLY

I had a premonition about the Route

18 pile up. .. I saved some people.

And now I think Death is after me.

CLEAR

Nice work. Maybe if you're real

lucky, you'll wind up in here with

me.

(gives Kimberly the once

over)

But I doubt you'll survive that

long.

KIMBERLY

It's not just about me. Someone I

saved died last night in a freak

accident. What if the others are

in danger, too?

CLEAR

Well, if you put them on the list,

they're already tits up.

KIMBERLY

What list?

CLEAR

Death's list. The precise order

you're going to die in.

CLEAR

The survivors of Flight 180 died in

the exact order they were

originally meant to die in the

plane crash. That was Death's

original design.

KIMBERLY

(sudden realization)

Exact order? Then I'm next! I was

meant to die with my friends, so

I'm next!

CLEAR

But you said someone else died last

night. That means Death skipped

past you. Someone must have

intervened.

(off Kimberly's confusion)

Sometime yesterday you must have

nearly died, but someone saved you.

KIMBERLY

Officer Burke pulled me away from

the crash that killed my friends.

CLEAR

Congratufuckinglations. That makes

you last to go. But don't worry,

once the others are dead, it'll

come back for you. Always does.

KIMBERLY

That still doesn't make sense. You

said you die in the same order you

were originally meant to. But Evan

Shaeffer died last in my

premonition, not first.

CLEAR

It's moving backwards?    Are you

sure?

KIMBERLY

Yes. In my premonition that Nora

woman and her kid died first, then

Evan and then...my friends.

CLEAR

Backwards...that's new.

CLEAR

That's good. Get all your tears

out now, you'll need your eyes.

(off Kimberly's confusion)

For the signs.

KIMBERLY

Signs?

CLEAR

If you have the same power as Alex,

you'll be seeing signs soon. When

you see anything creepy or ominous,

an in-your- face irony kinda thing?

Don't ignore it. It usually means

the difference between life and

death.

KIMBERLY

(to herself)

The songs on the radio.

(to Clear)

But wait. I don't understand.       Why

is this even happening to me?

CLEAR

That's what Alex used to ask

himself right up until...

KIMBERLY

It's obvious you know what you're

talking about. You beat it. You

have to help us.

CLEAR

I didn't beat it; I hid from it.

If you were smart you'd put a down

payment on a burial plot and say

goodbye to the dog, because what

little life you have left is over

as you know it. Don't make new

friends, don't fall in love, and

don't ever bother trying to save

others. That's the worst killer of

them all.

KIMBERLY

How can you say that?    What kind of

monster are you?

CLEAR

My family is dead.   My friends are

dead. And Alex...

CLEAR

And yes, that's the blade of a

fucking ceiling fan in his head.

KIMBERLY

Know what? I think you're a

coward. I think you hide out in

here because you're too damn bitter

and selfish to care about another

living soul. In my opinion, you're

already dead.

THOMAS

I tried calling last night but your

father --

KIMBERLY

Evan Shaeffer's dead.

THOMAS

I know. I've gotten calls all

morning from everyone who was on

the onramp. We're all meeting at

my apartment tonight.

KIMBERLY

Then you believe all this?? That

Death is working off a list?

THOMAS

I didn't. Until I was dispatched

to clean up one of the Flight 180

survivors.

KIMBERLY

Clean up? I don't...

KI MBERLY

Did you see that??

KIMBERLY

Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's

right about the order, then Nora

and Tim are going to be attacke d by

Pigeons!

THOMAS

I'm not following you --

KIMBERLY

They're next on the list.   We have

to find them.

TIM

(mischievous smile)

You think the tooth fairy's gonna

come tonight? I'm thinkin' like

fifteen bucks.

NORA

Nice try, kiddo.

TIM

Mom!

TIM

You okay?

NORA

Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake

it, we're late.

TIM

Not so much.

KIMBERLY

Turn around. The cleaning woman

said they're at the dentist's.

14th and Main.

THOMAS

Hold on.

DR. LEES (O.S.)

I'm a little disappointed, Tim.

Does your mom know you've been

smoking?

DR. LEES (O.S.)

Yeah, that'll have to be filled.

DR. LEES

Jesus. Every day at the same damn

time. Now this'll only sting for a

moment.

DR. LEES

Open big. Wiiiiider...

DR. LEES

How the hell do they expect me

to... Would you rather have the

laughing gas?

DR. LEES

Jean?     I need you in here.

(waits)

Jean??!

DR. LEES

Open big. Wiiiiiider.

DR. LEES

Goddamn it already.

TIM

What are they doing here? And why

are they yelling "pigeons"?

THOMAS

(shaking his head)

Nora's not coming. She refuses to

leave her son.

KIMBERLY

We have to tell her she's in

danger!

THOMAS

(sadly)

I did. And right now, I don't

think she cares.

KIMBERLY

It's happening again.   It's fucking

happening again. I hoped we'd get

there and they'd be okay, that

Clear Rivers was full of shit and

Evan's death was just a freak

accident...

KIMBERLY

But we're all going to die. We

can't stop it. It's just a matter

of time. I'm so scared.

THOMAS

I am too. But you can use that

fear. It'll sharpen your

instincts. Keep you alert fro

signs. It's the only way you'll be

able to sav e the others...and me.

THOMAS

I know you didn't ask for any of

this, Kimberly. But I don't think

you have it in you to quit either.

KIMBERLY

Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.

KIMBERLY

(bitter)

The second one just dies.   A 16

year old kid.

CLEAR

(nods; a faint trace of

guilt)

I hope you're ready for this.

KIMBERLY

This is cheery.

THOMAS

Who is this guy, anyway?

CLEAR

A mortician. He seemed to know a

hell of a lot more about death than

he ever told us.

THOMAS

Should we knock?

CLEAR

(looking ill)

He probably already knows we're

coming.

MORTICIAN

Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an

eye out for you.

KIMBERLY

Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.

MORTICIAN

Come to... Pick my brain?

MORTICIAN

(to Kimberly)

Flesh and bone require 1,600

degrees for cremation. Gold,

prosthetics and other metals must

be removed before the final --

CLEAR

(not falling for this

again)

Just a simple question and we'll

leave you alone with your new

friend.

MORTICIAN

Fire away.

CLEAR

How do you cheat Death once and for

all?

MORTICIAN

Dead.   But still fresh.

CLEAR

(to the Mortician)

Look, we drove a long way to get

here. So if you happen to know how

to get this death monkey off our

backs, it sure would be swell if

you told us.

MORTICIAN

For what purpose? You seek a back

way out of a room with but one

door. You can't cheat Death; there

are no escapes.

CLEAR

Bullshit. You told me Death has a

distinct design, a blueprint,

unalterable. But Alex and I

cheated Death not once, but dozens

of times. If the design is flawed,

it can be beaten.

MORTICIAN

Such fire in you now. People are

always most alive just before they

die. Don't you think?

CLEAR

It can be beaten.   And you know it.

MORTICIAN

Some say that there is a balance to

everything. An equilibrium that is

the connective tissue of the

universe. They say that for every

lif e there is a death, and for

every death a life...

MORTICIAN

Solus novus anima licet evinco

mortis; Only new life can defeat

death.

(off their confusion)

The list of life is forever set by

the Divine Plan, the guiding hand

that plots the course of the

universe, down to its tiniest

element s.

MORTICIAN

The list accounts for every life;

from the dawn of man to the great

apocalypse. But the introduction

of life that was not meant to be, a

soul forbidden to roam the earth,

that could invalidate Death's list,

shatter its very existence.

THOMAS

What the hell does that mean?

MORTICIAN

(with finality)

To figure that out you'll have to

follow the sign s.

MORTICIAN

But be warned. To disrupt the

grand design is to unravel the

tapestry of the universe. When you

pull all the threads apart, you may

find yourself hanging from them.

CLEAR

One last question. Why is Death

working backwards this time?

MORTICIAN

(shakes head; a sick

smile)

Sorry, time's up.

THOMAS

New life defeats death? Follow the

signs? Where the hell did you find

that guy?

KIMBERLY

Yeah, I thought he was supposed to

be helpful.

CLEAR

He was. If we can use your ability

to see the signs, we can cheat

Death long enough to figure out

what "new life" means.

(off their looks)

I know, it worries me that I

understand him.

CLEAR

What the fuck are you thinking?

SKATE RAT

I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee

yatch.

THOMAS

What is it? What did you see?

CLEAR

You have to tell us now.

KIMBERLY

I...I...

CLEAR

You're strong. Do you hear me?

You're a fucking warrior. Nothing

scares you. In fact you happen to

be the single most powerful woman

on earth. Now what did you see?

KIMBERLY

I was driving a white van. It

must've gone out of control because

it crashed into a lake and I

drowned. It was...horrible.

CLEAR

You were there?

KIMBERLY

I can practically taste the water

in my throat. And something else.

The smell of flowers...

CLEAR

(confused)

Then it wasn't just a sign. It was

a premonition?

THOMAS

Remember the onramp? There was a

pregnant woman in a white delivery

van.

CLEAR

Holy shit. He said "only new life

can defeat death."

(off looks)

If she gives birth to a baby that

was never meant to be born, a brand

new soul that was never part of

Death's Design...

KIMBERLY

It throws the entire Death list out

of whack. And a new list has to be

rewritten f rom scratch. We all

start over with a clean slate.

THOMAS

It sounds all well and good, but

what if we're wrong?

CLEAR

Please, what else could it mean?

KIMBERLY

(to Thomas)

So if you give us the pregnant

lady's number, we can warn her

about the lake and she'll live long

enough to have the baby.

CLEAR

So let's do it.

THOMAS

(realization)

Shit, I don't have her number. She

was never interviewed. She took

off right after the accident.

KIMBERLY

How are we going to find her?

There must be thousands of white

vans in this state.

THOMAS

Hey, I'm a police officer,

remember?

KIMBERLY

Oh God...

THOMAS

I, uh...sorry.

KIMBERLY

I know, I know. We need my eyes.

CLEAR

It's all right.    I'll take watch.

KIMBERLY

I'm okay. Just caught me by

surprise. Put it back on.

CLEAR

Make sure all these people will be

at the meeting tonight.

THOMAS

Taken care of.

KIMBERLY

There it is.

THOMAS

Got it.

CLEAR

I don't get it. Why is everything

happening so fast? After Flight

180. A month went by before anyone

died. And now five people are dead

in less than a day.

THOMAS

Here we go. The vehicle's a

delivery van registered to Jorge

and Isabella Cruz. And Christ,

there's almost a dozen domestic

disturbance complaints on these

two.

CLEAR

We need to hurry.

THOMAS

Let's lay this on her gently now.

The stress alone could upset the

pregnancy.

JORGE

What?

THOMAS

I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for

an Isabella Cruz.

JORGE

Shut up!!!

THOMAS

Are you Jorge Cruz?

JORGE

Maybe.   What's this about?

THOMAS

May we come in?

JORGE

No.   What's this about?

THOMAS

(a little stern)

It's about your wife, Isabella.

Now is she here?

JORGE

No.   I'm alone.

THOMAS

Look, pal, it's probably nothing.

But I need to see --

JORGE

Forget it. You'll need a warrant.

I know, I'm a lawyer.

JORGE

Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!!

YOUNG WOMAN

We never meant to hurt you

Isa...You're not Isabella!

JORGE

I'm going to sue your ass!

KIMBERLY

Whose blood is that on the floor?

JORGE

Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts

this afternoon. Now arrest her!

KIMBERLY

Where's Isabella? Did you finally

kill her you fucking wife beater?

JORGE

We had a fight. Some things got

broken, the dog went crazy, she

left me. Wouldn't say where she

was going.

THOMAS

What was the fight about?

JORGE

Take a guess.

THOMAS

Does she have a cell phone?   A way

we can contact her?

JORGE

She did.

CLEAR

We're wasting time with this piece

of shit. Let's just get to the

meeting.

JORGE

Hey, when you find her, tell her

the kid's half mine.

CLEAR

We can only pray it doesn't come

out retarded.

MAN

Jesus Christ. I wrote to

management two weeks ago about

these friggin' bumpers.

RORY

Damn, is that dogshit?

NORA

Does anybody have a Valium?

KAT

You'll want to take --

KAT

-- half of that.

THOMAS

(quietly, into phone)

Any word yet on the Dodge van?

Damn.

NORA

So that would mean... I'm next.

EUGENE

Nobody's next. This is crazy.

First death's stalking us and now

premonitions?

KAT

This can't be happening. My

career's at a peak, I finally met a

cute guy, I just bought a new

house...

RORY

Just shut the fuck up and maybe

you'll live.

CLEAR

You're not next, Nora. Nobody has

to be next. That's the point.

Last time, we didn't plan. We

weren't organized. Now we can help

each other.

CLEAR

Think what would have happened if

Kimberly had been able to warn you

with the word pigeons...

KIMBERLY

The point is, as long as you know

what to beware of, you have a

fighting chance. It can be beaten.

If I call you and say subway, get

to a high rise fast. A place where

no subway could possibly go, get

it?

RORY

Why the hell did I ever get on

Route 18 in the first place?

That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.

CLEAR

Anyone read today's paper?   The

article on Evan Shaeffer?

CLEAR

The only reason he was on Route 18

was because he own the lottery and

had to collect the winnings.

RORY

That lucky bastard.

CLEAR

What about the rest of you?

Kimberly, you were driving to

Daytona. Was Route 18 your first

choice?

KIMBERLY

The new freeway was faster, but

Route 18 was the way my mom used to

take, so...

THOMAS

Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but

he called in sick so I got...

(blanches)

Drake's never sick.

KAT

I was my first day of jury duty.

EUGENE

Jury duty? That's randomly

selected by social security

numbers.

CLEAR

Random, sure.

EUGENE

What, you think Death planned for

each of us to die in the pile up

weeks ago? You're nuts.

RORY

Last July I dialed a wrong number

and got a radio station by

accident. They asked me what

number means "good luck" in Jewish.

KAT

Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".

RORY

Anyway, I guessed it right and won

these.

RORY

The best way to get to Yankee

Stadium is Route 18.

KIMBERLY

I don't know what's weirder, the

dialing a wrong number part or that

Death would set you up nine months

in advance.

THOMAS

(realization)

Whoa, nine months?

KIMBERLY

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

ISABELLA

Yes, I'd like to report a domestic

squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz

why, does it matter? I'm at the

Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white

van. So what? Just get over here.

KIMBERLY

I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard

time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll

stay here at Virginia's tonight and

see you tomorrow. I love you too.

CLEAR

Remember everyone, just because

Kimberly's got the power doesn't

mean we're not all capable of

seeing signs to some extent.

RORY

It's like Forrest Gump.

CLEAR

Fuck. Should have seen that

coming. The institution's made me

soft.

EUGENE

If Death has got such a hard-on for

you, maybe you should get the hell

away from us.

KIMBERLY

We need her. She's the only one

who's dealt with this before,

idiot!

CLEAR

We're all going to have to open our

eyes from now on. Look out for

each other. Sleep in shifts.

(looks around apartment)

And we've got to safeproof this

deathtrap.

KAT

Screw this. I'm going outside for

a smoke.

THOMAS

You think you should?     It's not

safe out there.

KAT

So? Nora's gotta bite it before me

anyway, right?

KIMBERLY

Where are you going, Nora?    You

okay?

NORA

Four years ago my husband died.

Now Tim. There's nothing left for

me.

KIMBERLY

Don't say that. Once you lose

hope, it's already too late.

NORA

If it's my time to go, to be in

heaven with my family, then I can

accept that.

KIMBERLY

You can't give up. Don't accept

Death's plan. Trust me, you can

fight this. If we can just survive

long enough until that baby is

born, we can --

NORA

If you'll excuse me, I have a

funeral to prepare.

EUGENE

Yeah, why am I listening to a girl

who just got out of the nut house?

KIMBERLY

Seeing you die once was enough for

me.

EUGENE

Whatever. I control my life, not

fate.

CLEAR

I'll be sure to put that on your

tombstone.

RORY

Be careful. And even if you don't

believe, give this to Nora.

RORY

...man with hooks. I see a man

with hooks. Someone?!?!

THOMAS

(unsure)

I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's

going to be killed by a man with

hooks?

EUGENE

Going down, right?

EUGENE

Um, by the way, your shoe's untied.

EUGENE

Probably for you, anyway.

NORA

Officer Burke?   I can't hear...

EUGENE

What is it? What's wrong?

NORA

Let me go let me go!

EUGENE

Oh, watch it, you've caught your

uh...

MAN

Goodness gracious, darling, let me

help you with...

KAT

You alright, Nora?

NORA

My God, someone please let me out

of this --

EUGENE

...no escapes my ass. I control my

fate. I die on my terms, hear me

Reaper cockscuker?!

THOMAS

What the hell are you...?

EUGENE

Ain't going out like that.   On my

terms!

THOMAS

Just take it easy!

KIMBERLY

You don't keep it loaded?

RORY

Maybe they were all duds.

THOMAS

Six in a row? Never. Impossible.

That's like

(sinking realization)

...winning the lottery.

CLEAR (O.S.)

It wasn't his turn to die.

KAT

Can we find the pregnant woman,

please?

DISSOLVE TO:

EUGENE

Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about

before. I...

CLEAR

Your entire world view just went

out the window. I couldn't expect

a religious conversation overnight.

We'll get through this.

(beat)

I promise.

RORY

Can I ask you a question?

KIMBERLY

Sure.

RORY

When I die. Is it gonna hurt?

KIMBERLY

I...I don't know.

RORY

And you're gonna die after me,

right?

KIMBERLY

I guess so.

RORY

(re: keys and license)

Would you take these? And if I

die...

(tears well up)

Could you throw all my drugs out?

Paraphernalia, porno, you know...

Anything that would break my mom's

heart.

THOMAS

A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella

Cruz is being detained up in

Greenwood. Let's finish this

thing.

RORY

Is this safe, guys? I mean,

someone in this car is about to get

whacked. Do the rest of us really

feel like sitting next to him?

(off Kat's glare)

Or her. Hopefully her.

THOMAS

Guys, let's not panic.   Isabella's

safe.

KIMBERLY

How do you know?

THOMAS

You said she was going to drive

into a lake. How can she when

she's in protective custody?

ISABELLA

What do you mean "grand theft

auto?" This is insane.

STEVE

Hopefully the district judge can

straighten it all out by Monday

mor ning.

ISABELLA

(figures it out)

Jorge. When I get out of here I'm

going to sue his cheating ass off.

IS ABELLA

Oh my God.

STEVE

Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man.

STEVE

C'mon.    Let's go.

STEVE

Damn, they always stick me with the

clunker.

ISABELLA

Take my van!

RORY

Here's what I don't get. For nine

months, Death does all this shit to

make sure I win these tickets and

end up on Route 18 at exactly the

right time for the pile up...

KAT

Yeah?

RORY

But why single me out? What am I

in the great scheme of things?

You'd think I stepped off Flight

180 or something... Fucking weird,

man.

THOMAS

You want weird? Last year, my

partner and I were heading out for

the graveyard shift. A call comes

in about a train wreck and Frank

decides to let me handle it alone.

(beat)

Frank died that night in a

shootout. I'd be dead too if that

call had come in just ten seconds

later.

KAT

I got that beat. So like, last

May, I was supposed to stay at this

cheesy bed and breakfast in

Pennsylvania. There was a major

gas leak no one knew about and all

the guests suffocated during the

night.

RORY

Yeah, so what happened?

KAT

I never mad it. The Greyhound bus

I was on splattered some chick all

over the road and we had to stop.

CLEAR

Was that in Mt. Abraham?

KAT

Yeah.   How did you know?

CLEAR

(sinking realization)

That bus you were on? It killed

Terry Mathers. She was supposed to

die on Flight 180.

KAT

I'm not sure I--

THOMAS

Shit. The call about the train

wreck that saved my life? That was

the night I scraped up Billy

Hitchcock.

RORY

Who?

KIMBERLY

Another kid from Flight 180.

ISABELLA

Promise me...I won't have the

baby...in this van.

ISABELLA

Get around it!!!

RORY

Remember the theater in Paris that

collapsed last year, killed

everyone inside?

RORY

I had tickets to go, but one day

I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid,

sippin' lattes an' such, and this

dude gets whacked by a falling

sign.

CLEAR

Carter.

RORY

Freaked me out so bad I hid in a

shopping cart for four hours.

'Course, missed the show...

CLEAR

What about you, Kimberly?   Did you

anyone from Flight- ?

EUGENE

Are you okay?

KIMBERLY

A little over a year ago, my mother

and I went to the mall. I was

supposed to meet her outside, but I

got caught up watching some news

report about some kid who committed

suicide. I kept thinking, "How can

you strangle yourself in a

bathtub?" That's retarded.

KIMBERLY

It felt wrong. And yet...

(continuing)

There were gunshots outside and I

ran...

(chokes up)

Some kids tried to jack her car.

She fought them off - she was a

fighter - and they killed her.

KIMBERLY

After the funeral I had this

overwhelming feeling that it should

have been me. I figured that's how

everyone must feel. But I guess I

was right.

CLEAR

It's all starting to come together.

When Alex got us off Flight 180, it

didn't just change our lives. It

affected everyone and everything

we've come into contact with ever

since.

EUGENE

I'm not sure I understand.

CLEAR

Being alive after our time caused

an outward ripple - a rift in

Death's design.

EUGENE

So if you never got off the plane,

none of us would be ali ve in the

first place.

CLEAR

That's why Death is working

backwards. It's tying up all the

loose ends, sealing the rift once

and for all

STEVE

Hang on!

STEVE

We're okay, we're okay.

ISABELLA

Please.   It's not going to wait.

STEVE

I've got to stop and help those

people.

ISABELLA

Do you want to deliver this baby?

KAT

Not my time.     Amazing...

THOMAS

Is everybody alright?

KAT

He can't breathe!        He can't

breathe!

CLEAR

Oh my god, Eugene!?

MR. GIBBONS (O.S.)

Call 9- 1-1!

THOMAS

Stop it, don't move him!

KIMBERLY

He can't breathe damn it.   I think

his lung's collapsed!

CLEAR

Someone call for help!

KAT

I can't move my fucking leg!

Please get me out of here before it

explodes!

RORY

Watch it, dude!

KIMBERLY

Help us, we need help over here!

BRIAN

(to Kat, reassuringly)

I don't smell any gas. And none's

dripping, either.

KAT

Stop that! I still need this foot,

thank you.

CLEAR

Be careful with that, check the

gages on the regulator and be

mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch

for potholes and puddles.

CLEAR

Look, I made him a promise --

PARAMEDIC

Sorry.   There's no room.

THOMAS

Get that over here!   Move move

move!

RESCUE WORKER

Excuse me, hot soup coming through.

CLEAR

One more thing.   Watch out for

power lines.

CLEAR

We have to contact Isabella now!

THOMAS (O.S.)

Rory!!!

THOMAS

Where's the cell phone Clear gave

you?

RORY

I dunno. I think I gave it to

Eugene back at your place.

THOMAS

Damn it. We have to call the

Greenwood Police Station and warn

Isabella.

KIMBERLY

You doing alright in there?

KAT

My legs are starting to cramp up.

And God, why am I so thirsty? Does

anyone have any Fiji?

KAT

Christ, you wanna give me a heads

up next time, pal?

COP

She's at Phelps Memorial. They're

prepping her to give birth right

now.

THOMAS

Where's that?

COP

A few miles up the road.   Near the

docks.

KAT

Damn, can't you be quieter with

that thing?

RESCUE WORKER

(dripping scorn)

Sure, I'll just set it to the

"quiet" mode.

THOMAS

We gotta go now.   Isabella's in

labor.

KIMBERLY

What about that?

CLEAR

(calls over to Kat)

How you doing in there, hero?

KAT

(re: spike behind head)

I guess it could be worse.

THOMAS

So let's go...Where the hell is

Rory?!

KIMBERLY

Wait!

CLEAR

Get back!

MR. GIBBONS

I didn't mean to do it - I didn't

know.

KIMBERLY

(to herself)

It wasn't his turn.   And it's not

my turn.

KIMBERLY

Give me the keys to your truck.

Now!

MR. GIBBONS

(hysterical)

Anything you want. Anything.      I

wish I knew. I didn't...

THOMAS

(buckling up)

Hurry up. There's no time.   She's

about to give birth.

CLEAR

What are you doing?     You're going

to kill us!

KIMBERLY

No. If anyone dies from a crash

now, it'll be me. But I can't die

if Eugene and Isabella are still

alive. I'm last on Death's list.

CLEAR

Are you crazy? What makes you

think you'd survive?

KIMBERLY

What happened when Eugene tried to

kill himself out of turn?

CLEAR

(considering)

Six duds in a row.

KIMBERLY

And when it was Rory's turn to die,

and Thomas was in the way?

THOMAS

That branch fell and saved my life.

You're right, Death's maintaining

the order.

KIMBERLY

Let's pray that Isabella's still

alive.

STAFF

...contractions coming quicker now.

Take her pressure and CTG. One

centimeter dilation. Prep the

epidural stat.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

She's going to have to stop moving

if I'm going to --

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Goddamn it, keep her still!

NURSE

Sorry, doctor.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Perfectly still now...

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

Done.

(tears welling)

Now could someone please find the

open window and fucking close it?

KIMBERLY

This makes no sense. Isabella was

supposed to crash her van into a

lake. Could we have altered her

destiny when we had her arrested?

CLEAR

I don't think so. Alex's

premonitions happened exactly as he

saw them no matter how much we

tried to change it.

THOMAS

Then the only way to survive is to

get to the hospital and protect

Eugene and Isabella for as long as

we can.

CLEAR

If only Alex and I had done that

with the others, Alex might still

be...

THOMAS

Um, Kimberly? This is a

neighborhood. You may wanna slow

it down.

KIMBERLY

Don't worry. Nothing can happen to

us.

THOMAS

I wasn't worried about us.

THOMAS (O.S.)

Kimberly! Slow down!

BACK TO:

CLEAR

Slow down! We're...

CLEAR

(eyes darting)

What did you see? What am I

looking for?

KIMBERLY

No, it's not here. This one was

different. More like the pile up

and the van going into the lake.

It wasn't just a sign, I was there.

CLEAR

(confused)

Another premonition?

KIMBERLY

Yes. I was in a hospital. There

was screaming... A nurse was

choking me. I couldn't tell wh at

she looked like, but the name tag

was right in my face. Kalarjian.

THOMAS

Kalarjian?

KIMBERLY

I think a nurse named Kalarjian is

going to choke Isabella to death!

NURSE

Sorry. Can you feel that in your

trachea?

NURSE

Quite complaining. I got burnt

babies in the Children's Ward

braver than you.

NURSE

Don't bother. You won't be talking

for at least a month. Think you

can handle that, Jabberjaw?

NURSE

Don't worry. Everyone learns to

love me once they get used to my

sense of humor, okay?

KIMBERLY

Shouldn't we pull over?

THOMAS

No time. Keep going. I wouldn't

know how to explain any of this

anyway.

KIMBERLY

Oh come on.

KIMBERLY

What do you want me to do?

CLEAR

(hesitated beat)

Speed up.

KIMBERLY

Yeah, fuck 'em.

(to Thomas)

No offense.

CLEAR

Be alive, Isabella, please be

alive.

ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)

...ironically impaled through the

head as a result of an emergency

airbag deploying.

ORDERLY

Need a pen? Sure. If you like,

I'll bring crosswords for you, too.

ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)

...police Have speculated that one

of the deaths may have been

narcotics related and urge children

to stay away from d rugs.

ANCHOR MAN

Good advice, Sue. And stay in

school. Up next, Johnny Showers

has the weather...

ORDERLY

Jeez, it's freezing in here.

ADMINISTRATOR

What are you doing? The Henzels

are still waiting for you in the

Children's Ward --

ORDERLY

Right, right, right.     Gregory's big

day.

ADMINISTRATOR

And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy

can't feel her legs.

ANCHOR    WOMAN (O.S.)

Mor e tears were    shed this morning

in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy

that rocked the     Tri -State area...

CLEAR

Isabella Cruz.    What room's she in?

RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry, I can't give out that

info unless you're a relative.

CLEAR

I'm her sister.

RECEPTIONIST

I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz.

CLEAR

Delivery rooms are downstairs.

I'll find Eugene and catch up with

you.

THOMAS

Hurry, I think she's this way.

RECEPTIONIST

Security?

OBSTETRICIAN

Listen to me, Isabella, I need you

to stop pushing.

ISABELLA

What's wrong? IS the baby all

right?

OBSTETRICIAN

It's a breach. If I can't reverse

it, we may need to do a Caesarian.

STEVE

Maybe I should step outside.

PA ANNOUNCEMENT

Code Blue in Delivery Room 6.   Code

Blue!

CLEAR

B-187...B-187...

SECURITY GUARD

Just where do you think you're

going?

OBSTETRICIAN

Almost there. I see the head...

NURSE

What are you doing in here?    Get

the hell out! Right now!

OBSTETRICIAN

Isabella, look down and see your

son.

CLEAR

A guard grabbed me before I could

find Eugene.

THOMAS

Don't sweat it.   It's over.

CLEAR

She had the baby?

KIMBERLY

New life defeats death. We've done

it. Death has to rewrite the list.

We're safe.

THOMAS (O.S.)

Kimberly! Are you okay?!

THOMAS

Are you okay? You just face

planted!

KIMBERLY

I know how it feels to be dead.

CLEAR

What did you see?

KIMBERLY

I was dead. And came back to life.

An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?

THOMAS

But it's over. Isabella's baby was

the key. You saw her die and

everything, right?

KIMBERLY

I don't...what if I made a mistake?

THOMAS

Impossible. She was on the onramp.

KIMBERLY

I'm not sure... I don't think

Isabella was ever destined to die

in the pile -up.

THOMAS

Then what's the premonition of the

lake supposed to mean?

CLEAR

Can you remember anything about it?

KIMBERLY

...the Same hands from the van.

CLEAR

It's you Kimberly. The

premonitions are about you.

KIMBERLY

No!   It can't be.

CLEAR

(suddenly remembering)

I have to save Eugene!

CLEAR

Eugene?    Are you in there?

CLEAR (O.S.)

Can you hear me? I'm coming in .

ORDERLY (O.S.)

Make way, make way lovebirds.

KIMBERLY

Oh no...

ORDERLY

(to Clear)

Thanks hon, the Henzels are going

crazy for this thing.

KIMBERLY

Nurse Kalarjian...

DR. KALARJIAN

Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me,

please.

KIMBERLY

Oh my God. That's it. The lake.

The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.

THOMAS

What?

KIMBERLY

You can't cheat destiny. I know

what I have to do to save us. I

have to die.

THOMAS

That's crazy. You can't give up

now. We can still fight this

thing.

KIMBERLY

I have to do this.

EMT

What the fuck?!

DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)

Ready and...CLEAR!

NURSE

She's back!

DR. KALARJIAN

Five CC's of narcodon. I want her

stabilized and prepped for ICU.

THOMAS

Kimberly?!

KIMBERLY

(whispering)

Welcome back. We did it.           For

real.

THOMAS

I know.   I can feel it too.

KIMBERLY

My God, this is delicious. I can't

believe I used to be a vegan.

MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)

So what's the deal, Thomas? Three

months and you still haven't asked

my daughter out on a date.

THOMAS

What's wrong with a platonic

relationship?

MR. GIBBONS

Platonic my ass. That's for ugly

women.

KIMBERLY

For God's sake, leave him alone,

Dad.

THOMAS

(smiling)

Yeah, don't make me cite you for

harassment.

MR. GIBBONS

Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.

(looking around, lowering

voice)

Besides, if you can beat Death,

what's he got to worry about me

for?

MR. GIBBONS

You know, you still never explained

to us how you did it.

THOMAS

Well, technically when we died, we

gave Death what it wanted. And by

the time we were revived, it had

already moved on to graver

pastures.

MRS. GIBBONS

You know, I'm having the greatest

day?

KIMBERLY

Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.

Big props to you and Brian.

MRS. GIBBONS

Our...pleasure. So, ready for the

back-to -school season? NYU, right?

KIMBERLY

Three short glorious weeks away.

MRS. GIBBONS

Sounds wonderful. I wish I were

going myself.

MR. GIBBONS

(to Mr. Burroughs)

You may want to think twice about

letting her live in the village,

Bob. Our eldest daughter moved

there and came back with piercings

all over her face.

(looks grave)

Among other places.

BRIAN (O.S.)

Dad used to call her the

pincushion. From Hellraiser.

BRIAN

Dad, you had the spatula last,

right?

MR. GIBBONS

Sure, here.

KIMBERLY

Brian looks like he's having fun.

MR. GIBBONS

Sure does. Owes it to that friend

of yours, in a way.

KIMBERLY

How's that?

MR. GIBBONS

Well, Brian was nearly hit by an

ambulance the day...but your friend

Rory pulled him back at the last

second.

MRS. GIBBONS

You never told me that, Peter.

Boy, that was lucky.
