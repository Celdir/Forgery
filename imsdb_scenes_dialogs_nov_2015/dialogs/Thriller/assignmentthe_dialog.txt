SHOOTING DRAFT

FRENCH WOMAN (O.S.)

What do you think you're going?! You

ought to be ashamed behaving like

that!

CUT TO:

CARLOS

(whispering to the

burnt spider)

You lose...

COLETTE

What do you mean?

CARLOS

I mean get out.

COLETTE

You're a pig, you know that? How can

you be like that?

CARLOS

(barely above a whisper)

Leave without saying another word.

CARLOS

(singing)

All you need is love...

Rum da, da da da

All you need is love

Rum da da da da

All you need is lo-ve

Love is all you need.

Love is all you need.

CARLOS

Pardon monsieur...

CARLOS

Merci.

CARLOS

(counting)

One thousand one... one thousand

two... one thousand three...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DU FOLTIERE

Du Foltiere, Monsieur, intelligence

liaison officer. DST. My understanding

is that you are the Deputy Chief of

Station, CIA, Paris, and that you

witnessed by coincidence this attack.

JACK

That's right.

DU FOLTIERE

And you have told my subordinate

that you recognized the terrorist as

Carlos?

JACK

That's not what I told him. I said

he recognized me. Afterwards I

realized who he was. By then it was

too late.

DU FOLTIERE

(writing in his

notebook)

Ah yes... The deputy chief of station

did not recognize him... But he

recognized you.

JACK

I wasn't the one wearing the disguise.

DU FOLTIERE

Yes of course... But then how are

you sure it was him?

JACK

How often do you see someone holding

a live grenade listening to the fuse?

Besides, the arrogant son of a bitch

bastard smiled at me.

CARLOS

(singing)

I shot the sheriff...

But I did not shoot the deputy...

CUT TO:

VENEZUELAN OIL MINISTER

...Obviously some of the members are

exploiting the oil price differentials

as a loophole... This body has been

very precise in its policy.

CUT TO:

CARLOS

(in German)

Pardon me. Is the conference still

in progress?

RECEPTIONIST

(in German)

Yes, but sir...

CARLOS

(in German)

I have an urdent delivery for the

ministers.

CUT TO:

NIGERIAN OIL MINISTER

(angry)

I protest the unfound charges of the

oil minister from Venezuela. We do

not use, nor intend to use, the lower

gradings to capture more of the market --

CARLOS

(brandishing his

automatic)

EVERYONE FREEZE!

KOJ

We've got company.

CARLOS

My name is Carlos. You'll do as I

say.

MICKENA

...Twenty million dollars ransom.

JACK

Who's asking for it?

MICKENA

"The Arm of the Arab Revolution."

Alias of the month time.

(shrugs)

Could be anybody. The point is...

their leader claims to be Carlos...

JACK

He does, does he?

MICKENA

He wants to make sure everyone knows

it's him. He wants the credit and

the Austrians want a positive ID.

That's when your name came up.

JACK

Who brought my name up?

MICKENA

The guy who says he's Carlos. The

Austrians want you there to identify

him.

JACK

Where?

MICKENA

At the airport. Tomorrow. When they

provide the plane to fly him and the

hostages to Libya. Carlos evidently

feels very comfortable in Libya.

JACK

They got him here in their own

backyard and they're gonna let him

walk away?!

MICKENA

They've got no choice, Jack.

JACK

Bullshit! Let 'em handle it like the

Israelis would.

MICKENA

They're not the Israelis Jack. It's

not their fight.

JACK

Then let me take him out! They want

me to meet him at the airport. I can

get close enough to get a clear shot

at him. We can end this shit now.

MICKENA

Jack! He's got seventy hostages.

JACK

Fuck the hostages!

JACK

(apologetically)

Harold, we can handle it with a

minimum loss of life.

MICKENA

We will handle it with no loss of

life. Those aren't just any hostages.

They are the oil ministers of the

richest countries in the world, and

that twenty million bucks they're

gonna have to pay isn't gonna break

'em you know. It's nothing to them.

They just want to pay it and... it's

not our fight.

JACK

What do you think Carlos is gonna do

with that money? Put it in mutual

funds? He'll use it to hit us. Let

me assemble a team and we can...

MICKENA

Jack goddamnit, there isn't any team

to assemble! You're a fuckin'

dinosaur. We're out of the

assassination business. All of us!

You got a personal hard on against

this guy because he made you look

like an asshole and now he's gonna

rub your nose in it. I can appreciate

your feelings, but it's not going

down on our soil. It is not with our

nationals and it is not our fight!

Now I got my orders and you just got

yours.

JACK

I gotta hit the john.

JACK

(whispering)

I think it's him, but I can't be

sure. Not with those dark glasses

and the beard...

CARLOS

Minister of the Interior, I

presume...?

CARLOS

I'm sorry this had to happen in

Austria. We have no quarrel with

your government.

CARLOS

Pardon monsieur...

CARLOS

We were never really properly

introduced Mister Shaw. My name is

Carlos.

JACK

(smiling)

Eat shit and die slow.

MICKENA (O.S.)

Jack, no!

MICKENA

You don't want your picture taken

shaking his hand.

CARLOS

(to the minister)

As I was saying, I'm sorry about the

loss of life. And thank you for your

cooperation.

JERUSALEM - AUGUST

CROSS DISSOLVE:

CUT TO BLACK:

AMOS

(accented English)

How do you feel?

CARLOS

(broken English)

I do not speak English.

(in Spanish)

Yo soy Cubano... de Cuba... Castro...

Su amigos... Amigos... Entiende?

AMOS

You spoke English well enough to

your contact... the street vendor...

so please let's not play games. We're

both professionals, Carlos.

CARLOS

(with heavy Cuban

accent)

My name... Ramirez... no Carlos.

AMOS

Yes, I know what your name is...

Illich Ramirez...

CARLOS

No Illich.

AMOS

Alias Carlos Sanchez, alias Carlos

Martinez, alias The Jackal.

CARLOS

(with heavy Cuban

accent)

Jou're loco man... No Carlos... I am

tourist...

AMOS

Listen to me you piece of shit. I'm

trying very hard to be professional

about this but you are in Israeli

hands now... So don't play games

with me... entiende hombre?

CARLOS

Okay.

CARLOS

You... You're telling me you're

Israelis... not Arabs?

(relieved)

I'm in some kind of an Israeli

prison... is that what you're telling

me?

AMOS

Amazing how much your English has

improved in just a few seconds...

CARLOS

(trying to be very

reasonable)

Look, obviously there has been some

kind of mistake. I don't know who

you think I am, but I am a Lieutenant

Commander in the United States Navy,

okay? I am Lieutenant Commander

Annibal Ramirez of the U.S.S.

Yorktown, Sixth Fleet, docked in

Haifa. I am not Carlos or Sanchez or

Illich or the Jackal or whoever you

think you just caught. If you call

the U.S. Embassy and ask for the

Sixth Fleet Liaison Officer, he'll

confirm everything I've said.

AMOS

Remarkable... remarkable

performance... the chutzpa of it is

unbelievable... my hat is off to you

Carlos.

RAMIREZ

Your hat's off?! I'll tear your head

off! You get on the horn and you

call the U.S. Embassy and you call

the Sixth Fleet Liaison Office and

then motherfucker you go out and

find yourself a good lawyer and I'll

tell you somethin' Jack, I'm gonna

sue your ass so bad that your great

great grandchildren will still be

shovelin' shit to pay off the debt!

AMOS

Carlos... give me a break, huh? If

you were an American officer you

would have... ID papers, dog tags.

RAMIREZ

I ditched 'em in an alley just before

you guys got me. Go back there you'll

find 'em.

AMOS

You ditched them.

RAMIREZ

Per instructions... An American

officer on shore leave in the Middle

East must travel in mufti, civilian

clothes. A bunch of Arabs start

chasing me... could be terrorism...

could be kidnapping... instructions

are to ditch our tags, our ID or

anything else that could identify

us. That's why I spoke Spanish, that's

why I said I was a Cuban, not an

American. And you broke my ribs here

asshole. I'm gonna sue you, I'm gonna

sue your government... I'm gonna sue

every fuckin' Jew I can get my hands

on you, understand me?!

RAMIREZ

(shouting after him)

I'm gonna sue Menachem Begin, I'm

gonna sue Moshe Dayan, I'm gonna sue

the goddamned B'nai B'rith or whatever

you call it.

YONI

Sir?

AMOS

Yoni... I want you to go back to the

old city... where we caught...

Carlos... I want you to be very

inconspicuous. Take a half dozen

men... you comb every alleyway

there... every garbage can...

everything you can find... for what

looks like a U.S. military ID if

there is such a thing there.

YONI

What's the problem?

AMOS

Who said there was a problem? There's

no problem. I just asked you to do

something and you're going to do it.

So there's no problem.

AMOS

Nu?

AMOS

Oyyyy.

CUT TO:

SCOTT

I love it! Those cocky Israeli

bastards thought they hit the jackpot.

Got the Jackal right in their own

backyard...

MONROE

State Department's goin' apeshit.

And the Navy... Admiral Trost was so

pissed he was ready to shell the

port of Haifa.

JACK

You're not gettin' it are ya?

SCOTT

What?

JACK

These weren't some yokels... This

was the Israeli General Security

Service... The Mossad. The best in

the business. They have the most

complete dossier there is on Carlos,

the latest pictures of him...

everything. I mean what's that tell

you?

SCOTT

That they really ate it this time.

JACK

Scott... doesn't it hurt to walk

around like that with your head up

your ass... I mean isn't it painful?

JOEY

Poppi!

MAURA

I thought you weren't coming back

till tomorrow...

RAMIREZ

I wanted to be here for his game.

Look how beautiful she is!

RAMIREZ

Just like her mother.

MAURA

What happened to your eye?

RAMIREZ

Nothing. Just fell. It doesn't matter.

I'm home.

RAMIREZ

Joey watch Yolanda... okay?

JACK

Jesus...

RAMIREZ

I beg your pardon?

JACK

Lieutenant Commander Ramirez my name

is Jack Shaw... I'm with the

government... I'd like to talk to

you about what happened in Israel.

CUT TO:

RAMIREZ

I want to sue them, okay? I want to

sue the guy who broke my ribs. I

want to sue their government and

their Mossad... and I want to sue

Golda Meir!

JACK

Mrs. Meir is dead, Lieutenant

Commander.

RAMIREZ

Then you might want to have them dig

her up because I intend to sue her.

JACK

Commander Ramirez when I said I was

from the government, perhaps I should

have been more specific. I'm from

the CIA.

JACK

Does the man in that picture look

familiar?

YOLANDA

Poppi...

RAMIREZ

That's not me... I mean I know it

looks like me... but...

JACK

I know it's not you.

RAMIREZ

It's... this Carlos guy.

JOEY

Poppi, you don't need to watch the

fire, come climb with me.

RAMIREZ

Get out of that tree, Joey. Your

mother sees that and I'm dead.

JACK

This is the only recent shot we have

of him... telescopic lens from half

a mile away taken by the Israelis.

Can you blame 'em for what happened?

The only difference is the eyes.

RAMIREZ

Okay I get it now, you're here to

talk me out of my lawsuit. But see I

identified myself but they kept me

in that cell for two more days chained

to that wall after I told 'em who I

was so...

JACK

Lieutenant Commander, I am not here

about your lawsuit. Carlos is the

single most vicious terrorist in the

world. He's personally carried out

or masterminded the worst terrorist

attacks in modern history. Men, women,

children. Children like yours...

blown to bits or slaughtered in cold

blood. Annibal... why did you join

the Navy?

RAMIREZ

(as if by rote)

To serve my country.

JACK

To serve your country... to protect

her from her enemies. Well Carlos is

one of her enemies now. And he'll

probably become a bigger one...

terrorism... unfortunately is a growth

industry.

RAMIREZ

Why are you telling me all this?

JACK

Lieutenant Commander, the governments

of most countries in the free world

have been after Carlos for ten years

and we have nothing to show for it.

There is exactly one person in the

world who can help us get Carlos.

And that person is you.

RAMIREZ

What do you mean... to get him?

JACK

All I can tell you is it may take as

much as six months to a year of

preparation. It will involve a high

degree of risk. That much said, you

may never as much as lay eyes on him

yourself. But if we succeed Carlos

won't be a threat to anyone anymore.

Now I know you're going to need some

time to think about it so...

RAMIREZ

No I don't need any time. The answer's

no.

JACK

Annibal...

RAMIREZ

Lieutenant Commander... I am a Naval

Officer... that's what I was trained

for... that's what I'm good at...

See you came to the wrong address.

You want James Bond. He lives in

London and he's got an Aston Martin.

You can't miss him.

NAVAL AIDE

Admiral Crawford this is Commander

and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft.

CRAWFORD

I know your family well, Commander,

I was with your father at the Academy.

I expect great things from you Ward...

great things.

SCOWCROFT

I won't let you down sir.

NAVAL AIDE

Admiral Crawford this is Lieutenant

Commander and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez.

CRAWFORD

Annabelle?!

RAMIREZ

(smiling)

It's Annibal sir.

CRAWFORD

Yes... of course... well ... I'm

glad to see we're getting some Mexican

American officers in the ranks. I'm

an L.A. boy myself so I have a real

soft spot for authentic Mexican

food... My stomach doesn't always go

along with it but...

MAURA

We'd love to have you over to dinner

Admiral but the cuisine would be

Cuban not Mexican. I think your

stomach would find it more

agreeable... not to mention your

taste buds.

CRAWFORD

You're Cuban Americans... oh I'm

sorry... you grow up in L.A. and you

hear Ramirez and... anyway it was a

pleasure meeting you.

JACK

We do keep bumping into each other

don't we. How do you do, Mrs. Ramirez?

I was over at your lovely home the

other day but I felt cheated because

I had to leave before I had the

pleasure of meeting you.

MAURA

The pleasure is mine...

JACK

Para servirle, Yo soy encantado de

conocerte.

MAURA

Encantada Senor...

JACK

Shaw... Jack Shaw.

MAURA

Senor Shaw. Mucho gusto.

RAMIREZ

My wife speaks English Mister Shaw...

so do I.

JACK

Perdonname, I didn't think you'd be

embarrassed to speak Spanish in front

of the Admiral. A sus ordenes.

RAMIREZ

(to bartender)

I'll have a club soda and... uhh...

a glass of white wine please...

JACK

Let me guess the white wine is for

your wife right? Cause you're afraid

to drink anything stronger than club

soda around the brass. How do you

stand this shit Annibal? I mean

they're all so fuckin' constipated.

RAMIREZ

My wife is waiting for her wine...

if you'll excuse me.

JACK

Oh there's a fiery retort.

RAMIREZ

(under his breath)

How about fuck you.

JACK

I'd believe it if you said it a little

louder...

JACK

Look at these guys. You don't belong

with them. You belong with me. What

did Darth Vader say to Luke? Come

over to the dark side? You have no

idea of the power we have.

RAMIREZ

Hey... I told you I didn't want

anything to do with you.

JACK

How's it going to look in your jacket?

Your country came to you requesting

help and you turned it down. Not

exactly promotion material, know

what I mean? These people don't want

you in their club, Annibal. I do.

RAMIREZ

The answer is no. That's the end of

it.

RAMIREZ

Oh Jesus... what do you want?

JACK

I want you to come with me.

RAMIREZ

Well then get set for disappointment.

JACK

Okay. Then you are ordered to come

with me.

RAMIREZ

You can't order me to do shit.

JACK

It's for you.

RAMIREZ

(into Cell phone)

Hello... who? Oh... yes sir... Yes

sir... Yes sir... Yes sir. I will...

yes sir.

CUT TO:

RAMIREZ

What's this?

JACK

Put it on.

RAMIREZ

Why?

JACK

Because I just told you to. You need

a phone call for that, too?

JACK

The boy was flown here from Germany.

His parents are U.S. military

personnel. Navy family. A bomb was

planted in a grocery store that was

frequented mainly by U.S. military

dependents. They believe it was Carlos

or one of the Cells he runs. How old

is your kid?

RAMIREZ

(quietly)

He's six.

JACK

Hmmph... so is this kid.

FATHER

Hello Doctor Shaw. Is this... Is

this the Specialist you told us about?

JACK

Doctor Ramirez, Lieutenant and Mrs.

Newcomb... the parents of the child

who was wounded in the terrorist

attack.

FATHER

You're the one who's going to do the

surgery.

JACK

He's going to help out.

FATHER

They told us you were the best person

in the world to do this.

JACK

He's the only one.

JACK

Here's the boy's chart, Doctor. As

you can see, one kidney was destroyed

by the shrapnel. There's a large

perforation in the left lung, the

spleen, the large intestine, the

stomach lining were all torn. There

are over a hundred individual shrapnel

fragments. It was obviously designed

by Carlos to maim, not to kill.

RAMIREZ

What kind of a sadistic son of a

bitch are you? You use those poor

people... you use anything to get

what you want.

JACK

To get what I want?

JACK

These are pictures of just some of

Carlos' victims. Most of them are

children. We haven't had time to get

that kid's picture in yet. Up until

I heard about you, all we could do

about Carlos was take pictures of

his victims. I wasn't lying to those

people. You are the only one who can

do anything about Carlos. I'm not

the bad guy, Annibal. Carlos is. I'm

just trying to make you see the

choices.

JACK

Who are you angry at? Me for bringing

you down here or Carlos for blowing

up that kid? Which of us deserves

your anger?

MAURA

What are you doing?

RAMIREZ

I was just reading some... manuals...

MAURA

Read 'em on the Navy's time... this

is my time...

RAMIREZ

You'll see... it'll go by fast.

MAURA

Not fast enough.

RAMIREZ

You take care of Mommy, okay?

JOEY

But why do you have to go?

RAMIREZ

Well they're finally giving me my

chance to go into subs... that's

what I've always wanted you know...

JOEY

New color subs...

RAMIREZ

Nuclear...

JOEY

Is there going to be a war, Poppi?

RAMIREZ

Not if I can help it.

JOEY

Then why do you need to go away?

RAMIREZ

Because sometimes countries need

soldiers and sailors to be on guard

so there won't be a war... So all

the little children like you and

baby Yolanda will be safe.

JOEY

Why can't somebody else's Daddy go

on the sub and you could stay here

and go to my games?

RAMIREZ

Because I'm the one they asked and

I'm the one who knows how to do the

job.

CUT TO:

JACK

This is an ad hoc operation set up

specifically for your mission. When

that's over, not even a trace of it

will remain. You don't need to know

anyone's name. And from now on, your

name is Miguel... Security.

RAMIREZ

So your name really isn't Jack Shaw?

JACK

(smiling)

Of course it is.

JACK

Your mother is Irish... Irish

American.

RAMIREZ

Yes.

JACK

Something wrong, Miguel?

RAMIREZ

...No... not really.

JACK

Your father was in a Cuban prison if

I'm correct.

JACK

Your mother used to take you to visit

him there, didn't she?

RAMIREZ

(quietly)

Yes.

JACK

I'm sure that's a disturbing memory.

RAMIREZ

You didn't set this up in a prison

because it was the first piece of

real estate you were shown, did you,

sir?

JACK

Let's just say everything has its

purpose. And Miguel... no one is to

know anything about you other than

that you're our student. So don't

call me sir, because it's like wearing

a sign on your forehead that you're

military. From here on out forget

the Navy.

RAMIREZ

Yes sir... Gotcha...

JACK

This is our surveillance and satellite

tracking center. Just as we are

plotting to destroy Carlos, if he

knew what we're trying to do, I assure

you he'd try to find a way to kill

us first.

JACK

Carlos has two main safe houses. One

in Libya, one in East Germany. We

have satellites that pass over each

one three times a day. Unfortunately,

the Russians know exactly when our

satellites are in position so we

have to assume that Carlos knows as

well.

JACK

There's one person I want you to

meet, though I think the two of you

have already been introduced.

AMOS

Hello Miguel... My name is Amos.

RAMIREZ

Oh yeah... I didn't recognize you

without my foot chained to the floor.

AMOS

I hope there are no hard feelings.

RAMIREZ

There are a lot of hard feelings.

And I'm still gonna sue you when

this is over.

JACK

Miguel, this is a combined Israeli-

American operation. Amos here knows

Carlos better than anyone in the

free world. He was the one who took

that picture of Carlos in Libya.

RAMIREZ

If you could get a picture of him

why didn't you just kill him?

AMOS

Don't let all this equipment fool

you. Carlos still has the home court

advantage. He has the best protection

in the world... three layers at least

at all times. Next and maybe most

important... Carlos himself. The

French DST came to arrest him once.

He was at his apartment, drunk,

playing his guitar. He actually had

them convinced it was all a mistake.

Then he went into his bathroom, took

a shave mind you so he would look

his best for the interrogation and

when he came out managed to shoot

each of them through the forehead.

Then he got the informer who had

betrayed him, put him down on his

knees and killed him... Think of it.

He took a shave and didn't even nick

himself once.

AMOS

Finally, there are political

realities. Whoever hits Carlos has

to realize that he'll unleash against

himself a fanatical wave of terrorist

activity in retribution.

JACK

That by the way, is the last question

you're going to ask. From now on

you'll get information when and how

we want you to get it. Not before.

You don't ask questions, you just do

what you're told.

AMOS

This is going to be unlike any

learning experience you've ever had

before. For one thing, we're going

to push to all your limits. Fatigue,

frustration and fear. We're going to

make you more terrified than you've

ever been in your life just to see

how you handle the fear. Any other

learning experience you get things

ninety- nine point nine nine nine

percent right you get an "A." Here

if you get things ninety-nine point

nine nine nine percent right... you

get...

JACK

Dead! And I'll tell you the truth. I

honestly in my heart of hearts don't

care whether you live or die. Don't

take that personal. I don't care

whether I live or die. I do care

about getting Carlos. That's all I

care about.

RAMIREZ

But nothing personal, right?

AMOS

I'm not as cold-blooded as my American

friend... it would bother me very

much if you were dead... so we will

teach you to stay alive... but no

questions... just do. Otherwise...

RAMIREZ

When do we start?

JACK

You already have. What were the names

on the last three tombstones you

passed on your right?

RAMIREZ

I... I don't know, I wasn't looking.

I wasn't paying attention.

JACK

That's what will get you killed.

Carlos is always looking... always

paying attention. Always.

AMOS

Because Carlos is the master of the

techniques of survival which we will

teach you and because he is an

efficient killer for whoever employs

him, then for him there are simply

no rules. Unlike you Miguel, you're

a rule follower, aren't you?

AMOS

Carlos is the opposite of that and

that's what's so seductive, you know?

He can kill whomever he chooses...

ravish whoever he chooses... take

whatever he chooses. Do... whatever

he chooses. It is to be in many ways

a superman, not bound by the mores

or morals of humanity.

JACK

And if you learn what we can teach

you, you'll be one, too. If not,

you'll be dead.

AMOS

Good morning. How's the porridge,

you like it?

RAMIREZ

'Morning. It's not bad.

AMOS

Good... finish everything in the

pot.

RAMIREZ

There's got to be like... eight

helpings in there maybe...

AMOS

No questions... Just do.

AMOS

Name and place of birth!

RAMIREZ

Illich Ramirez. Caracas, Venezuela.

AMOS

Your father?

RAMIREZ

Doctor Jose Altagracia Ramirez... Do

you have to smoke that cigar?

AMOS

Yes.

AMOS

Carlos' father abandoned him and his

mother because he wanted to be a

playboy. Your father abandoned you

in effect, when he was sent to prison.

Either way, it's a lonely child

missing his father. I want you to

take what you know of your real father

and superimpose it onto this the

image of Carlos' father, so when you

talk of one you are talking of the

other with the same emotion... the

same love, the same resentment...

the same sadness, the same anger.

CUT TO:

JACK

You need to not only remember the

names on every tombstone, but where

they are so when I call out a name,

you whirl and shoot.

RAMIREZ

It's kind of cold. You think I might

be able to borrow a warmer jacket

from someone?

JACK

Brisson! We don't want you to be

comfortable. That's just what will

get you killed.

JACK

DuPres! Paquet!

RAMIREZ

Top shelf... some milk, some juice,

maybe some cottage cheese, a couple

bottles of beer, some tomatoes... I

don't know...

JACK

What kind of milk, how many cartons,

open or closed, what kind of juice,

how full was the bottle, was it

cottage cheese or cream cheese, how

many bottles of beer, how many

tomatoes? This is life and death!

JACK

Look here... Ten seconds, how many

cups, saucers, plates, look this

time!

JACK

Here's the thing about Carlos. He

doesn't fit any mold. His father is

an extraordinarily wealthy playboy

who's a Marxist at the same time...

DuFraisne!

JACK

The guy's such a fanatic he names

his three sons after Lenin. And I

don't mean John. The same thing is

true for Carlos. He's a guerilla

fighter who loves champagne and

caviar... LaPierre!

JACK

He doesn't want to be Che Guevara,

he wants to be the James Bond of the

People's Liberation Front. It's not

so much radical chic as an excuse

for sadism. Paquet!

CUT TO:

JACK

Dead again.

RAMIREZ

What's that?

JACK

It's a transmitter.

RAMIREZ

For what?

JACK

Target practice. You're the target.

JACK

If you shoot out the receivers,

they'll stop. There are ten rounds

in this clip. The first two are live,

the next three dummy, then three

live, two dummy.

JACK

Three times dead.

AMOS

You finish all your porridge?

RAMIREZ

(deadly)

Yeah... yeah... I finished all my

porridge.

AMOS

Good now you can have some more.

RAMIREZ

Enough of this porridge shit man, hi

jo deputa! Fuck it man... I ain't

eatin' no more of this shit! And I

ain't wearin' this fuckin' shirt

anymore either!

AMOS

Why Miguel amigo, whatever is the

matter?

RAMIREZ

I'll tell you what the matter is

man... I been here twelve mother

fuckin' weeks an' all I've had to

eat the whole time is this shit! And

those dumb ass basketball games...

what's that?! You damn near kill me

with those fucking snowmobiles... I

haven't seen my family in three months

and I still don't know what any plan

is or what I'm supposed to be doing!

AMOS

Congratulations! You're acting like

a child... like a spoiled brat...

JACK

And not a Navy Lieutenant Commander,

which is exactly what would get you

killed.

AMOS

Finally you're acting like a willful

spoiled child which is just what

Carlos was.

JACK

We couldn't just let you study Carlos.

If this thing is going to work, you

have to become him.

RAMIREZ

The two most elite intelligence

services in the world and the best

you can come up with is this porridge

bullshit?!

AMOS

As a child Carlos was fed that

porridge that you love so much every

day. He hated it. Every woman or man

he's ever been close to he told about

that porridge... how the very smell

of it made him sick. And now it makes

you sick.

JACK

When he was in school he was a scrawny

little kid. The last one to get picked

for any teams. He felt as clumsy as

we've made you feel...

AMOS

His father smoked cigars... the same

ones whose smell you complained about.

The only cover that can save your

life... is the one you believe

yourself. Now... are you ready to

pass the next test?

AMOS

I'll take that for a yes. You're

about to go into your house. Your

wife has told you she was away with

the children for a week. She is

entering the house for the first

time in a week with you. The children

are still at Grandma's so the two of

you have a nice romantic time ahead

of you. Walk through the house...

through the living room and the

kitchen only. You have thirty seconds.

Walk casually through the house so

as not to make her suspicious of

anything you do and find out if she's

telling you the truth or not. If you

pass this test your questions will

be answered. If not... you'll be

sent home to Virginia and this will

be the end of it.

JACK

(looking at watch)

Time's up.

AMOS

Nu? Is she telling the truth or lying?

RAMIREZ

She's got to be lying, otherwise

this would be a very short test and

I don't think that's what you had in

mind. She had a man over.

JACK

How do you know?

RAMIREZ

She hasn't been here in a week? Then

why was the sponge still damp. It

means she washed dishes. Take a look

at the dish rack. There's water in

the tray underneath it. Probably

from a couple of plates. There's a

bit of water in the silverware tray.

The milk is still fresh... not even

a hint of being sour and the date on

it is a week from today... means she

just bought it yesterday or the day

before. The margarine's fresh-bought

but it's already been opened. Same

with the bread.

AMOS

How do you know it was a man?

RAMIREZ

(ignoring him a beat)

She might have met him at a bar

because there's a book of matches in

the garbage. She was probably careful

to throw the cigarette away but

there's still a bit of ash and that

cigarette smell at the bottom of the

liner.

JACK

What else?

RAMIREZ

I think they made love on the sofa

because one of the cushions has been

turned over and there's the

indentation of a tennis shoe print

in the rug over there.

RAMIREZ

Sorta like the ones you're wearing,

Jack. Besides, I know it was a man

because I smelled after-shave on the

couch.

RAMIREZ

...Cheap kind.

RAMIREZ

Jack... you've been fucking my wife.

RAMIREZ

Now who's dead?

CUT TO:

JACK

The plan is to get the KGB to

eliminate Carlos for us. Carlos knows

every link between the KGB and every

terrorist organization in the world.

He's not only the smoking gun, he

knows every contact there ever was.

We make the KGB think that Carlos is

ready to turn... ready to go over to

the CIA, and they'll take him out.

RAMIREZ

Why would they think Carlos would go

over to the CIA?

AMOS

Money... fifty million... not for

the forces of world revolution this

time, but for him, in his pocket

with a new identity and CIA

protection. They'll believe it... if

we lay it out right... they'll believe

it.

RAMIREZ

When do we move?

AMOS

Not so fast. You're far from ready.

I would think another three months

of training and then...

RAMIREZ

Bullshit! I'm ready now. Give me any

test you want. Christ, I already

passed your tests... what more do

you want?

RAMIREZ

(studying to himself

in Arabic)

Shoo Ismak? Isme... Carlos. Isme

Carlos.

AMOS

It should be hitting him now...

RAMIREZ

Jack! Jack!!!! Amos!! You

motherfuckers!

RAMIREZ

Jack!!

RAMIREZ

Amos you piece of shit! Wen anta?

Coos echtak ya sharmuta!

RAMIREZ

So she tried the first bowl of caviar

and said, that's too hot, and she

tried the second bowl and said, that's

too cold and so she tried the third

little itsy bitsy bowl of caviar

that belonged to little Miguel and

that turned into maggots and that

was just right...

RAMIREZ

Here's the problem, Doctor. He needs

a new brain.

JACK

Brilliant, Doctor!

JACK

And tasty, too!

RAMIREZ'S FATHER

Vaya mi hijo. Vaya rapido!

CARLOS

(looking at Ramirez)

I think she likes me better... don't

you baby. She likes it rough... you

never knew that? Yala... ruh mi hun.

AMOS

I hope we didn't go too far with

this.

JACK

I'd rather have him wind up in a

mental institution fucked up on LSD

than shot in some back alley in Libya.

If he can't handle this, he sure as

shit can't handle going operational.

RAMIREZ

Okay... what's next?

HEAD KGB OFFICER

(glancing up from

report)

[We're just gotten information from

our resident in Zurich that the CIA

head of station there has deposited

letters of credit in the amount of

fifty million dollars into the account

of a Mister Paulo Ortega... It would

appear the Americans are dangling a

very impressive bait for what I can

only assume is a very juicy fish. I

want to know who this Paulo Ortega

is and what he's going to give the

CIA that is worth so very much money.

And then we'll see what we can do

about that.]

JACK (THRU TAPE)

You're going to hit a hairpin turn

exactly three tenths of a mile from

the stop sign which should be coming

into view at any minute.

JACK

Don't stop for the stop sign, don't

even slow down for it. You've got to

hit the hairpin exactly fifteen

seconds after you pass the stop sign.

JACK

The hairpin should be right in front

of you. Keep your focus. You can't

let down even after you negotiate

the turn. You never know what's going

to be around the next corner... or

whose life might depend on your

reactions.

RAMIREZ (O.S.)

(as his hand starts

for brake)

You asshole!

RAMIREZ

You crazy-assed mother fucker! I

could have killed you!

JACK

You can't let down! This isn't a

game... it is life and death. You

have to be ready for anything, all

the time.

RAMIREZ

Fuck you!

JACK

(calmly)

The clip in your gun has three live,

two dummy, one live, three dummy,

one live.

RAMIREZ

No rules, Jack? Then you fucking

deal with it.

JACK

You pussy. You rule-following pussy.

JACK

You know why you don't fuck around

on your wife? Not because you don't

want to. You're a man. You want to

fuck everything. But you don't...

because you're afraid it would cost

you what... your wife, your family,

your self respect maybe...

JACK

...You know what Carlos would do if

he was married? He'd bring whatever

woman he wanted home and make his

wife fuck her. That's what no rules

means. That's what you're too much

of a pussy to get.

RAMIREZ

No rules, Jack? Okay... We're in a

fucking foreign country on a secret

mission... I can't be here, I'm on a

submarine. The U.S. Navy's my alibi.

What's the count on my ammunition,

Jack? Is this one live or a dud?

RAMIREZ

What about the next one, Jack? Live

or dud... who cares... no rules,

right?

JACK

(perversely proud)

Yes, my good son...

RAMIREZ

Think you can be lucky three times

in a row?

RAMIREZ

How about four?

AMOS (O.S.)

Annibal! It's over!

JACK

Stay out of it.

AMOS

It's over, Jack. He's it.

RAMIREZ

What's this?

JACK

What you'll wear from now on. Black

T-shirt and jeans... it's the only

thing Carlos ever wears whenever

he's not out being a terrorist. It's

the opposite of what he was forced

to wear as a child... you know...

the school uniforms, the white tight

collared shirts... It's become like

a fetish for him.

AMOS

And to match your new wardrobe, in

another two days your bandages will

come off and you'll get to show your

beautiful new nose to Carla.

RAMIREZ

Who's Carla?

JACK

She's a Venezuelan. She was Carlos'

main squeeze about fifteen years

ago. She'll put the finishing touches

on the act.

RAMIREZ

Why's one of Carlos' girlfriends

helping us?

AMOS

Carlos used her... like he uses a

lot of women. She emigrated to Israel.

Now she wants to get even.

RAMIREZ

What do you mean used her. How?

JACK

He put her on an airplane with a

bomb in her suitcase. She would have

gone up with everything else. What's

that song say? There are fifty ways

to leave your lover? Make that fifty-

one.

AMOS

She's about thirty-seven... still

attractive.

JACK

So it's not gonna be a hardship.

RAMIREZ

What's not gonna be a hardship?

JACK

Making love to her.

JACK

Annibal... the way in is a woman...

her name is Agnieska. It's part of

the trap. The KGB will be watching

her... we'll make sure of that...

She's a more recent girlfriend of

Carlos... But they've got to be

convinced and so does she. Carlos,

you, are going to ask her to do

something. She has to believe you're

him or she won't risk it.

JACK

What the fuck are you lookin' at?

You're gonna help murder this guy,

you draw the moral line at

extramarital sex?

JACK

Don't think of it as cheating. Think

of it as fucking for the flag.

AMOS

"When in doubt, close your eyes and

think of England."

CARLA

The thing about Carlos is... he

doesn't lose himself with a woman...

not with a lover... maybe with a

whore I don't know... I wasn't his

whore. Lovers are different to him...

he might have a use for them... so

he has to seduce them properly. He

has to make sure they're so crazy

about him they'll do anything for

him.

RAMIREZ

When did you...?

CARLA

Shhh! You're not here.

CARLA

You don't exist until I'm ready to

let you exist, and then... you do

exactly what I say.

CARLA

It's not pleasure for him... it's...

it's... it's... this sick kind of

conquest... you know this seduction...

he's got to make you not just a lover

but a disciple... a worshipper... He

brainwashes you with his body...

so... so... you'll do anything...

you see because he's the perfect

lover... he does it all to... not to

please you... but to excite you...

to... to make it dangerous for you

and then, that's very sexy too, to a

woman... that danger... like he could

kill you in a second... but instead

he makes you come... So he's almost

killed you, you see? And you have

this orgasm right then and it's like

he's killed you and there isn't

anything left of you and he makes

you be born again the way he wants

you to be. So there isn't a thought

in your brain that he hasn't put

there. Not a feeling in your body

that he hasn't put there.

CARLA

Take off your clothes.

RAMIREZ

Just like that?

CARLA

Look Mister...

RAMIREZ

Miguel...

CARLA

I don't want to know your name... I

don't want to know anything about

you okay. This isn't fun for me. I'm

not here to play soft music and be

romantic. I'm here to help you kill

him... At least I hope that's what

you're going to do. They promised me

it was.

RAMIREZ

Yes.

CARLA

Take off your clothes.

CARLA

You're smaller than him.

RAMIREZ

(shaking his head)

Great.

CARLA

That's what he would have done if I

would have said something like that.

Without a moment's hesitation. What's

wrong with you?! No eres ni hombre!

CARLA

Now come to me and kiss where you

hit.

CARLA

Kiss where the blood is and then

smear it on my lips so I taste it.

CARLA

Now go down on me... yes like that...

si... si... tease me... tease... but

don't let me come... control me...

it's got to be when he wants it...

yeah...

DISSOLVE TO:

CARLA

Ask me if I like it... he always

asks... he wants to hear it.

RAMIREZ

You like it...

CARLA

Demand it.

RAMIREZ

(harder)

You like it?!

CARLA

Yeah...

RAMIREZ

You like it?!

CARLA

Make me beg.

RAMIREZ

Beg for it...

CARLA

Please...

RAMIREZ

Yeah...

CARLA

Please... Tell me you want me to

come...

RAMIREZ

I want you to come now...

CARLA

You want to feel it all over you...

RAMIREZ

Oh yeah baby... yeah... you make me

feel so good.

CARLA

Stop!... Stop it!

RAMIREZ

What... What'd I do...

CARLA

He never loses control... He never

tells you how he feels. He's in

control. He's the one who makes you

feel what he wants you to feel. He

never feels anything... You stupid...

stupid...

CARLA

Roll over!

RAMIREZ

Why?

CARLA

On your back!

CARLA

I'm Carlos... You're me.

CARLA

You like it...

RAMIREZ

Yeah.

CARLA

You like it?

RAMIREZ

Oh baby...

CARLA

Ooooo I want to make you come...

RAMIREZ

Yeah...

CARLA

I want to make you come... I want to

feel it all over me.

RAMIREZ

Yeah... yeahhh... Yeahhhhhh.

RAMIREZ

(scared)

What the fuck are you doin'?

CARLA

Let me... let me do it... Put your

hands down.

CARLA

He does that... he's crazy... he

chokes you... just a little.

CARLA

Then he goes to the refrigerator and

eats... He's always hungry

afterwards... always... God I feel

like filth.

RAMIREZ

I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

CARLA

Get your hands off me!

RAMIREZ

Shh... I'm not him... I'm not

Carlos... I'm...

CARLA

I don't care who you are. I don't

want to know anything about you...

except that you're going to kill

him.

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[It seems our friendly bank manager

in Zurich has received instructions

to put a new name on the account of

our mysterious Mister Paulo Ortega...

Agnieska Kozinski. Does the name

sound familiar?]

KGB AIDE

[Should it?]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[I ran a check on her. She's a French

national... originally Polish. She

was a girlfriend of Carlos.]

KGB AIDE

[Our Carlos?]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[The question is... is he still our

Carlos. Or is he about to become

someone else's.]

AGNIESKA

My God... My God... It's him.

JACK

Well... not the most painful way to

burn your bridges behind you, huh

Miguel?

RAMIREZ

What do you mean?

JACK

Saint Miguel the faithful husband is

dead. Long live Carlos. You've cheated

on your wife... now you can do

anything.

RAMIREZ

What I did in there I didn't do to

cheat on my wife and you know it.

JACK

Hey, pussy's pussy.

RAMIREZ

I just got it about you, Jack. You

can't get it up, can you?

AMOS (O.S.)

We've got it. Just confirmed.

JACK

Got what confirmed?

AMOS

The KGB has set up a surveillance on

Agnieska. And Agnieska has received

her summons from her long-lost love...

Carlos, telling her to come and meet

you. At the meeting you convince her

you're Carlos. You ask her to handle

some bank transactions. She will.

Then the KGB knows Carlos and Ortega

are the same man. Then later they'll

see you meet with a CIA agent. They'll

have all the pieces. They'll know

Carlos has turned.

RAMIREZ

Where do I meet with this Agnieska?

AMOS

Libya. That's where Carlos is.

RAMIREZ

Couldn't we wait till he takes a

trip? I mean Libya... shit.

AMOS

The waiting is more dangerous to you

than going to Libya. We've laid out

a trap. Now we have to be careful

not to get caught in it ourselves.

AMOS

Jack doesn't know that we're having

this talk and I don't want him to

know... understand?

RAMIREZ

Okay...

AMOS

Nothing can make you ready for combat

but combat. Jack would be against me

telling you this... He would say you

shouldn't have a thought in your

head that we haven't put there but

you're not just a box that we're

going to fill up with our own ideas.

You have a right to know certain

things.

RAMIREZ

I appreciate that Amos... a lot.

It's funny, I started out hating

you... I mean I'm still gonna sue

you, don't think you're off the hook

for my broken ribs, but...

AMOS

But now you love me and we're going

to run away to San Francisco and

find a reformed rabbi to perform a

mixed gay marriage. Listen to me...

You're going to feel more alone than

you've ever felt in your life. It

will hit you all of a sudden and

you'll think your heart's going to

jump out of your chest, you'll think

everyone around you can hear your

heart beating, and that everyone

around you is an enemy agent. I want

you to be prepared for that. So you

can deal with it. Understand?

RAMIREZ

Yes.

AMOS

We had an agent... the best we ever

had in training. We were going to

infiltrate him into Beirut and then

use him to penetrate the PFLP. No

student ever scored higher than this

man... We set up his cover for six

months in Argentina. He was perfect.

And then we sent him to Beirut. He

got off the plane, went to his hotel,

went up to his room and had a nervous

breakdown.

AMOS

We had to mount an operation to send

in a man posing as a doctor so we

could drug him and get him out on a

plane. Okay? Now you understand?

Nothing prepares you. I want you to

know that so when it hits you, you

don't panic, you feel the fear and

then get rid of it.

RAMIREZ

Jesus...

AMOS

You splash some water on your face.

You take some deep breaths. You look

in the mirror and when you look in

that mirror, I don't want you to

find Annibal Ramirez. You find Carlos.

If you find Carlos, that's what

everyone else will find too. And if

you find Carlos and anything goes

wrong, he's the one who can get you

out of it. Because he's the best.

RAMIREZ

(after a beat)

I got a wife I got to go back to

when this is over. I got kids I got

to go back to when this is over. I

want to go back as Annibal Ramirez...

not Carlos.

AMOS

You will... you'll need a time of

decompression and it will be hard at

first, but you will. Because inside

you aren't Carlos... you aren't a

terrorist. But right now, in order

to save your life, you've got to be.

You've got to look in the mirror and

find Carlos. Do you understand?

RAMIREZ

I do.

AMOS

You won't be able to go in with a

gun... too risky... so we're going

to have to get one to you once you're

in place. How I don't know yet...

But we'll get one to you. You'll

make your way out by boat. We'll be

on it. But we won't be able to help

if anything goes wrong. We'll make

our way down the coast to a friendly

state and then fly back to London,

and from there back to the U.S.

(in an Arabic accent)

SHHHHHHH. One sound and you're dead.

PERSON HOLDING HER

Carlos... when is he coming here?

AGNIESKA

I don't know what you're talking

about.

PERSON HOLDING HER

Don't play games with me. We've had

you followed. We know you're going

to meet him. Now, when?!

AGNIESKA

I don't know any Carlos... please

I'm telling you the truth.

PERSON HOLDING HER

This gun has a silencer. There won't

be any noise. Now talk!

AGNIESKA

I don't know what you're talking

about... I'm not from here. I just

came to visit a girlfriend. This is

her apartment. She'll be here

tomorrow... please.

PERSON HOLDING HER

You're lying...

AGNIESKA

I swear to you... I'm telling the

truth...

AGNIESKA

What... what are you going to do to

me.

PERSON WHO WAS HOLDING HER

First... I'm going to have some fun

with you... and then...

RAMIREZ

Then I'm going to have something to

eat... I'm famished.

AGNIESKA

You bastard! I haven't see you for

two years and this is the way you...

RAMIREZ

I had to be sure I could still trust

you.

AGNIESKA

I came all the way to this god-

forsaken country didn't I? I've been

holed up in this place you arranged

for me for the past twenty-four

hours... I couldn't eat I couldn't

sleep... nothing just sitting in

here waiting for you.

RAMIREZ

So why did you leave. . .?

AGNIESKA

Whoever stocked this place with food

didn't leave much of a selection...

I wanted to go out and get some nice

things for you. You weren't supposed

to be here for another three hours.

I could have made a nice dinner.

RAMIREZ

I've got what I want to eat in my

arms right now.

JACK

I wonder what he's doing now.

AMOS

Practicing safe sex, I hope.

AGNIESKA

My God... my God...

RAMIREZ

Yeah... Now, let's eat.

RAMIREZ

What are you doing?

AGNIESKA

Just getting some air in here...

Don't be so jumpy.

AGNIESKA

Forget about what's in there... I

found caviar and, here's some pate.

RAMIREZ

Didn't like the food I'd left for

you, huh?

AGNIESKA

Couldn't eat a bite of it.

RAMIREZ

Ughhh... I don't blame you.

RAMIREZ

Who was here smoking a filter-tip

cigarette my darling?

AGNIESKA

What?

RAMIREZ

You don't smoke filters.

AGNIESKA

What are you talking about?

RAMIREZ

That's what I'm talking about! The

filter-tipped cigarette. Who was

here.

AGNIESKA

You're crazy... no one... I...

Illich... listen... I ran out of

cigarettes and... and I was at a

cafe and I bummed a cigarette... I

had a cigarette and coffee and came

back here... that's all.

RAMIREZ

(loosening his grasp

just a little)

You bummed a cigarette... that's

all.

AGNIESKA

Yes... yes... you know I can't have

coffee without a cigarette.

RAMIREZ

I believe you.

RAMIREZ

The nearest cafe is two blocks away.

A cigarette wouldn't have lasted

that long... so you bummed a cigarette

but it wasn't in a cafe... it was

very close to here... In this

apartment building. Who did you meet

with? That window was a signal wasn't

it?! Wasn't it you puta bitch!

RAMIREZ

Tell me or you're dead!

AGNIESKA

The French... the DST... They made

me... I didn't have any choice...

RAMIREZ

You sold me out!

VLADIMIR

[Gunfire?! What the hell is going

on?!]

KOJ

Illich... you must get dressed. There

was a shooting tonight... We have to

talk.

CARLOS

What shooting... who?

RAMIREZ

What the fuck are you talking about,

you didn't know she was working with

the DST?

JACK

We didn't. How the fuck should we

know?

RAMIREZ

They're our allies, for Christ's

sake!

JACK

They didn't tell us this time. Why

should they it was their operation.

And we sure as shit weren't gonna

let them in on you being here.

RAMIREZ

Why not?! That way they wouldn't

have tried to kill me and I wouldn't

have wound up killing them.

AMOS

It would have been too dangerous.

RAMIREZ

Too dangerous... what the fuck do

you think that was back there? Safe?

How the fuck more dangerous does it

have to get?

JACK

Annibal, the important thing was it

worked! The Russians have to think

it was Carlos now... . What did they

see? They trail the girl... and then

there's a shoot out. Let's make sure

they know it was DST... we can make

sure they get that information. If

they know the DST was there then

what were they doing there if it

wasn't to get Carlos. She betrayed

you, so tomorrow we take her name

off the bank account and we set up

another place for them to get their

pictures. We burned Libya but okay

so we'll find another place. The

only thing that matters is they've

got to believe it now. It's perfect!

RAMIREZ

You fuckin' maniac! I killed four

DST agents tonight! They're our allies

and they were tryin' to kill me and

I killed them. I killed our allies!

JACK

Hey fuck our allies!

AMOS

Annibal... policemen wind up shooting

other policemen... it happens. I

would rather have you here feeling

guilty about them than to know there

was a meeting in Paris tonight where

they were feeling guilty about you.

JACK

Annibal... you did what you had to

do and it worked. All the training

worked. Carlos couldn't have done it

any better.

KGB AIDE

[Whether Carlos was actually in there

with her or not we don't know... All

we know is there was a gun battle...

DST agents from what we've been able

to find out. But whether or not it

was Carlos...]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[If it was Carlos and he sent for

the girl... and she betrayed him...

Well... we should keep watch on the

girl. What he does about her will

tell us more than anything else.]

CARLOS

So the moronic DST find an old

girlfriend and send her here to bait

a honey trap for me... and then they

trip over their own dicks and start

shooting each other... why?

KOJ

There was a man with her... who we

don't know... They must have spotted

him come in... thought it was you

and moved too soon... before she

even made contact with you. Whoever

he was... he was awfully good.

CARLOS

Where is the girl now?

KOJ

They've taken her to Paris.

CARLOS

I want the bitch dead!

KOJ

It won't be easy.

CARLOS

If it was going to be easy I could

hire a couple of junkies. I want the

cunt dead! You handle it Koj. Hit

her in Paris, right under their

fucking noses and leave Europe through

London.

KOJ

When?

CARLOS

Now! Leave now. Not this afternoon...

not five minutes from now... Now!

CARLOS

Something else troubles me my friends.

How was this woman going to make

contact with me. You're the only

ones who knew about this safe house.

So one of you was her contact.

HEAD KGB OFFICER

(reading it)

[When?]

AIDE

[This afternoon... the girl and two

DST agents dead, one wounded.]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[So now we know... it was Carlos.]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[We still have to tie him to the

CIA... if that is what's going on. I

won't make a move against him until

I know for sure.]

AIDE

[Why?]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[Because my dear boy... four of his

colleagues shot in Libya, plus the

DST and now the girl. He's a very

dangerous fellow. One doesn't make a

move against such a man until one is

sure. And then one must move very

quickly and kill him... before he

has a chance to kill you.]

RAMIREZ

(loudly)

Is this seat taken?

JACK

No, go right ahead.

RAMIREZ

I want to go home. I want to see my

family.

JACK

This isn't the place for this

conversation.

RAMIREZ

(pissed off)

No rules, remember? I want to go

home. You said yourself we can't

move again till he leaves Libya. You

don't even know when that's gonna

be. He might stay there another year

for Christ's sake.

JACK

No he won't. He's gonna make a move

and it'll be in Europe just to stick

it up the DST's nose. I'm gonna go

and find out about our connecting

flight.

KOJ

(whispering)

Carlos... what are you doing here?

RAMIREZ

(hissing)

You idiot! Don't you know better

than to approach me in public!

KOJ

(loudly)

Excuse me sir... I only wanted to

know where I could buy a newspaper.

RAMIREZ

Go over there by the phone booths

and wait... I'll come to you.

KOJ

(loudly)

Excuse me sir... I asked if you knew

where I could buy a newspaper.

KOJ

Make the slightest move and I shoot...

and I don't miss. Walk to the rest

room, very carefully.

KOJ

Tell me what I want to know quickly

or you're dead.

AMOS (O.S.)

Down!!

AMOS

Get out of here... now...

RAMIREZ

I've got to get you to a doctor.

AMOS

Get out now...

RAMIREZ

I'm not going to let you die here...

I've still got a lawsuit against

you, remember?

AMOS

My dear boy... my dear dear boy... I

am dead. Please God, don't let it

all be for nothing... Get out now...

AMOS

Walk slowly... no attention.

PHONE VOICE

Cousins Industrial Maintenance, may

I help you?

JACK

Mister Simon Wicks, please.

PHONE VOICE

Ringing.

WICKS (THROUGH PHONE)

Simon Wicks here.

JACK

This is Jack Shaw. Could you send a

clean-up crew to Heathrow. We've had

a rather nasty spill.

JACK

(into phone)

Yes... I'm calling about my cousin...

Oh Jesus... Oh Jesus...

RAMIREZ

Oh God... no...

JACK

(into phone)

I understand... Yes... Good bye.

RAMIREZ

Amos?

JACK

He's dead.

RAMIREZ

Why?! Why didn't you let me go back

to him... If we'd have gotten him

help sooner instead of... instead of

"we had a rather nasty spill!" Is

that what it was Jack? Is that all

Amos was... a rather nasty spill,

mop it up, it'll be okay?! Huh?!

JACK

(dead panned)

He would have been dead anyway and

he knew it. That's why he told you

to get out.

JACK

(after a beat)

Looks like you're going to get to

see your family after all.

RAMIREZ

What?

JACK

You're going home... it's off... for

the time being at least.

RAMIREZ

Bullshit! I want him. I want that

son of a bitch Carlos! And I want

him dead!

JACK

Tough shit what you want, Annibal.

Koj had a ticket for Libya on him.

Chances are he wasn't looking for

you but...

RAMIREZ

He wasn't looking for me... He thought

I was Carlos!

JACK

That's what I think too but the

Director wants an operation review

board... The DST shoot out... the

girl winds up dead in Paris... now

this... I've got to go back for the

review and you've got to go home.

RAMIREZ

No way man... it was my fault... the

whole thing... I want him dead!

JACK

What do you mean it was your fault?

RAMIREZ

When he asked me about the paper...

if I coulda just bullshitted my way...

JACK

It was a password... you didn't know

it... anything you would have tried

would have backfired. I had a thing

like that... Awfully warm for this

time of year... the response was,

yes but not as sticky as two summers

ago... the guy says anything else...

he even hesitates, you shoot him. I

shot him... There was nothing else

you could have done.

RAMIREZ

I'm not leavin' till we get him.

JACK

Nobody's askin' you. They're shuttin'

us down. You go back home... maybe

I'll see you again... maybe I won't.

You'll either hear from me or you'll

get new sea duty and that's the end

of it.

RAMIREZ

Just like that?

JACK

Just like that. I ain't the Madam

kid... I'm just one of the whores.

And so are you.

CUT TO:

RAMIREZ

What's wrong?

MAURA

You've been with another woman...

haven't you.

RAMIREZ

What are you talking about?

MAURA

Haven't you?

RAMIREZ

No. What... what would make you say

a thing like that?

MAURA

You're different...

RAMIREZ

Maura... I was on a submarine...

there aren't any women on

submarines... There was nothin' to

do but read. They had one of those...

how to improve your sex life books...

I must have read it about ten times.

I tried out a couple of things from

chapter three okay? I mean if it

didn't turn you on blame Doctor Ruth

okay?

MAURA

(unconvinced)

Okay.

RAMIREZ

Great. You want to check with the

Navy to see if we had shore leave...

I'll get you a fuckin' letter okay?

MAURA

I don't need any letters. And I don't

need you to talk to me like that

either.

MAURA

Where are you going?

RAMIREZ

Get somethin' to eat... I'm starving.

RAMIREZ

Maura... Maura!

MAURA

What?

RAMIREZ

Where's the car? The car's not in

the garage. Where's the car?

MAURA

The fellow at the service station

said it needed a tune up. I took it

in this morning... You didn't say

you were going to need it.

RAMIREZ

Don't do that anymore.

MAURA

What?

RAMIREZ

I don't want anybody workin' on the

car. Car needs something I'll do it.

But I don't want anybody touchin'

that car.

MAURA

Why? What difference does it make.

RAMIREZ

It makes a difference to me okay? So

don't do it.

MAURA

Did you check the mail?

RAMIREZ

Yeah I checked the mail. Still nothin'

from the Navy. Why, you so anxious

to get rid of me?

MAURA

I don't want you goin' back to those

subs. I'll tell you that.

RAMIREZ

Yeah well I don't have much to say

about it. It's the Navy you know.

MAURA

You can request another assignment.

It's changed you Annibal. It's hurting

us.

RAMIREZ

What's hurting us?

MAURA

Your attitude... that's what hurting

us.

RAMIREZ

My attitude. I don't have an attitude

man... you got an attitude.

MAURA

You're suspicious of everything that

goes on... you snap at Joey, you

snap at me. I don't like it.

RAMIREZ

Look I just... it's hard gettin'

used to... you know... it's hard...

Listen... tomorrow's Joey's game.

Let's just go to Joey's game. It'll

be nice. It'll be like it always

was. You'll see.

FRANK

I don't want so see you out there

TYLER

Yes sir.

FRANK

You're gonna be focused and aggressive

and you're gonna play to win. Got

it?

FRANK

Hey, you think I'm talking just to

hear myself talk? Look at me when

I'm talking to you!

RAMIREZ

Hey pal, lighten up, what do you

say? It's just a game?

FRANK

What did you say?

RAMIREZ

I said lighten up. It's just a game

and he's just a kid.

FRANK

He's my kid.

RAMIREZ

Great. So why don't we let our kids

have a good time. Come on, I'll buy

you a beer.

FRANK

I don't need you to buy me a fuckin'

beer, you piece of shit. And you

stick your face in my business again

and I'll beat the living fuck out of

you. What do you say to that?

FRANK

What are you smilin' at, asshole?

RAMIREZ

(very quiet)

A dead man...

MAURA (O.S.)

Annibal... please!

MAURA

Annibal please. Let's go sit down.

FRANK

Good idea, Annabelle. Your ol' lady

MAURA

Annibal... please... Please...

FRANK

What are you doin' standing here?!

You're supposed to be over there

with your team! Now move!

FRANK

I said...

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN

(opening the door)

He's all yours.

JACK

Little League, huh? Tough game.

RAMIREZ

What are you doing here?

JACK

It's show time.

RAMIREZ

I got to have time to think it over.

JACK

There isn't any time. He's on his

way to East Berlin. We have word

he's planning another attack in

Europe. He'll be there maybe four

days at the most.

RAMIREZ

Hey, I don't know what to do anymore,

okay? I almost killed some little

kid's father today. I don't know

about anything anymore.

JACK

Hey, he was a baseball dad. He

deserved it. Besides, from what I

heard his kid was out, so what's the

beef?

RAMIREZ

I don't know if I could come back

from it again.

JACK

What happened to I want the son of a

bitch dead? You think Carlos has had

a change of heart and turned nice

all of a sudden?

RAMIREZ

Don't tell me about Carlos, Jack. I

know exactly who Carlos is. I know a

hell of a lot better than you do.

But, maybe there's more important

things to me, like keepin' from goin'

crazy... like gettin' back to bein'

me instead of me bein' some kind of

fuckin' maniac.

JACK

You want to get back to bein' you?

Then finish it. Kill him. Kill him

and he's dead and it's over with.

You walk away from it now and what

do you think you're gonna be like

the next time you read that that son

of a bitch blew up some airplane

full of women and kids.

RAMIREZ

Hey, the guy deserves to be dead. I

know that.

JACK

This isn't abstract, Annibal. You're

walkin' around with his face. Sooner

or later one of the bad guys is gonna

see it like Koj did, and next time

Amos won't be there to take the bullet

for you. Carlos doesn't forget. You

help me get him or you're never gonna

know when he's comin' after you...

Listen to me kid. I don't have any

friends, no family, no nothin'. The

only relationships I ever had that

mattered to me were with the people

I killed. But I... I fucking created

you! You can't just walk away now.

RAMIREZ

You did create me, didn't you...

From the beginning... that kid in

the hospital in Bethesda... when I

was supposed to be the doctor... It

was all bullshit, wasn't it? All an

act...

JACK

This doesn't have anything to do

with you and me. It's you and Carlos.

You help me kill him... or I swear

to you... I'll make sure he knows

about you... I'll use you for bait.

You and your whole fuckin' family

too.

JACK

Huh? Huh?

JACK

You want to try and kill me, that

doesn't solve your problem, pally.

You've got a Carlos problem. That's

the guy you've got to kill. That's

what it's all about now... you...

and your family... or him.

MAURA

No! I won't let you do it! You're

not going back to those subs! It's

changed you... You need help, Annibal.

You could get some kind of stress

disability or...

RAMIREZ

Enough!

MAURA

No, not enough. Whatever is going on

out there with your job...

RAMIREZ

With my job!? What do you think my

job is, Maura... huh? What do you

think is out there? A nice, pretty

safe little world with shopping malls

and little league and ballet lessons.

You sit here in your little kitchen

and cook your little meals...

RAMIREZ

People are killing people out there!

Jackals are licking up their blood

waiting for the next corpse to drop...

and I'm one of them. You get that?

Do you get that now?!

RAMIREZ

I've murdered people. Not safe and

clean and surgical firing a missile

from some ship, but close and with

my hands so their blood splattered

on me... so their brains splattered

on me. And they weren't the enemy,

Maura... they were Allies. They were

on our side. It was just to keep a

cover... I've betrayed everything I

ever believed in. I've betrayed you...

I've fucked other women... I've killed

men... There was a woman I would

have killed but I just ran out of

time. I've let friends die... I've

become a terrorist... and I've made

you and the children a target. Do

you understand what I'm saying to

you? Do you see me now? Do you see

the monster? There's another one

worse than me and he is out there

and he will kill you and the children

if I don't kill him first... . That's

my job, Maura. And if you don't mind,

I'm late for work.

JACK

We used a double agent to get word

to the Russians that Carlos is really

here to close his deal with us and

not to plan a new attack in Europe.

He has a new girlfriend... He's been

fucking her brains out since he got

here. He has her brought over every

night in a limo. You'll be dropped

near the mansion... as soon as she

goes in, you make as if you're

sneaking out... the Russians will be

watching. You'll go to the meet.

It's at that beer hall, there...

see? You see it?

RAMIREZ

Got it.

JACK

You go to the meet at the beer hall.

Play it out... let 'em take your

picture... then you've got to get

back. They're going to have to analyze

the pictures and see through your

disguise before they can authorize a

hit. They won't be able to do that

before you're able to get back to

the mansion. At twenty-one fifteen a

Volga with diplomatic plates, DC-

four-five-nine-two will come by the

northeast corner of the compound. It

will slow down... you jump in. If

you can't make it for any reason,

there will be another run at exactly

twenty-one forty-five. It's your

only ticket out so don't be late.

RAMIREZ

Who do I meet? Who's my contact?

JACK

Me... My ass is on the line too.

RAMIREZ

Who cares? This isn't you and me.

It's me and him. If the Russians

don't go for the bait for any

reason...

JACK

If the Russians don't go for the

bait for any reason you will have

gotten out of there at twenty-one

fifteen per orders.

RAMIREZ

If the Russians don't go for the

bait for any reason, I'll go in there

and kill him myself. And if I'm still

alive I might just come looking for

you.

IVAN

Don't blow it Comrades... kill him.

HEAD KGB OFFICER

[Quick! Quick!]

HEAD KGB OFFICER

(sarcastic)

Don't even think about it. It would

deprive the KGB of the pleasure of

interrogating you.

CARLOS

KGB? I thought...

HEAD KGB OFFICER

What? That we were your new friends...

The CIA... Jack Shaw...

CARLOS

Jack Shaw...?

HEAD KGB OFFICER

Stop playing games. And it's no use

looking behind me... Your associates

can no longer be of assistance. Not

to you, not to anyone...

CARLOS

(angry)

Comrade, you'd getter have an

explanation --

HEAD KGB OFFICER

You've got it all wrong, Illich.

It's you who has all the explaining

to do... Now get dressed!

(to the blonde)

You too, Fraulein.

CARLOS

My pants...

CARLOS

(continuing; getting

dressed)

That's what was going on in Libya.

The CIA... The DST... They're trying

to set me up and you're falling for

it, you idiot!

HEAD KGB OFFICER

Enough. We tailed you to your meeting.

We have the pictures of you with

Shaw.

CARLOS

That's impossible. I've been here

all night.

(points to the blonde)

Ask her.

(to the blonde)

Tell him.

BLONDE

(in a voice matching

her looks)

It's true. All night...

HEAD KGB OFFICER

(unimpressed)

We know about your women... Now hurry

up, both of you!

CARLOS

(to Head KGB Officer)

I'll prove it to you. You'll be

pleading for my forgiveness. Let's

just go. I want to be interrogated.

I demand to be interrogated.

HEAD KGB OFFICER

WAIT!

RAMIREZ

What the fuck?

RAMIREZ

Kill him... Kill him...

CARLOS ON TOP

Don't shoot. It's me you asshole!

JACK

Let's get the fuck out of here.

JACK

Have you come looking for me now,

Annibal?

THE MAN WITH THE PISTOL

What the fuck are you talking about...

JACK

Awfully warm for this time of year

isn't it?

RAMIREZ

Any word?

JACK

How you feeling?

RAMIREZ

Did he get away?

RAMIREZ

Then it was all for nothing... the

whole thing.

JACK

No it wasn't. He's finished. The KGB

bought it. As far as they're

concerned, he's the enemy now. He'll

bounce around from one country to

the next. But his paymasters have

disowned him. None of their client

states will risk using him. No one'll

trust him again. He'll spend the

rest of his life looking over his

shoulder waiting to be betrayed. And

it'll happen... sooner or later...

when it's to some country's

advantage... they'll give him up or

they'll trade him. He's finished. It

worked and he's finished.

RAMIREZ

Not for me he isn't... There are

still two of us...

DISSOLVE TO:

MAURA

Is it over?

RAMIREZ

No.

RAMIREZ

You have to make a new life for

yourself and the children.

MAURA

No.

RAMIREZ

Maura, anytime I start a car I'll

wonder if this is the one that

explodes. I couldn't bear the thought

of you and the children being in

that danger. He'll want me and

everyone I've ever loved to be dead.

Trust me... I know how he thinks

because it's the way I think now

too. I am so... sorry. I am so

sorry...

MAURA

I won't leave you.

RAMIREZ

Maura, when my father was put into

prison he told my mother to take me

and leave and start a new life. That's

what you've got to do.

MAURA

You're not in prison and I'm not

your mother and I won't leave you. I

will not let him do this to us. Not

him... not the CIA... not anyone.

RAMIREZ

He'll come after me.

MAURA

Get me a gun and teach me to shoot

and he'll have to deal with both of

us. This animal will not destroy my

family. Please... come home.

How does one even begin to comprehend

a tragedy like this. A highly

respected Naval officer returns from

six months of hazardous duty. He has

escaped the danger we all come to

know in the service of our country.

He is about to go to church with his

beloved family and in an instant...

they are no more. They are with God.

Our minds cannot comprehend such

tragedy... only an undying faith in

the Almighty a faith that says even

though we cannot see it, there is a

plan. That and the knowledge that as

in life, so for eternity are they

together...
