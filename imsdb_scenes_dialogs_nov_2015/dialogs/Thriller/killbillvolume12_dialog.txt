MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Do you find me sadistic?

CUT TO:

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)

I bet I could fry an egg on your

head about now, if I wanted to.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)

No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even

now, you're aware enough to know

there isn't a trace of sadism in

my actions... Okay - Maybe towards

these other jokers - bot not your.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)

No Kiddo at this moment, this is me

at my most masochistic.

THE BRIDE

Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

CUT TO:

"The 4th Film by

QUENTIN TARANTINO"

CUT TO:

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's his girlfriend Janeen.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's my best friend from work

Erica.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's the minister. I think his

name was Reverend Hillhouse.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's his wife.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

Organ player, don't know her name.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

name on his driver's license was

Charles Arthur Plympton, but for

some reason he preferred Arthur.

Maybe if he went by Carles people

would have called him Charlie. If

that was his reason for going by

Arthur I can understand it.

Nothing wrong with the name

Charlie, except he didn't look like

a Charlie, he looked like an

Arthur.

Obviously you'll have to take my

word on this. Speaking of names, I

was about two seconds away from

becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur

Plympton.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

Looked dead, didn't I? Well I

wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo

trying, I can tell you that.

Actually Bill's last bullet put me

in a coma. A coma I was to lie in

for five years.

When I woke up, ...I went on what

the movie advertisements refer to

as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I

roarded and I rampaged and I got

bloody satisfaction. In all, I've

killed 33 people to get to this

piont right now.

I have only one more.

The last one.

The one I'M driving to right now.

The only one left.

And when I arrive at my

destination.....

.... I'm gonna Kill Bill.

WE FADE TO BLACK

Chapter one

"2"

CUT TO:

"The city of

PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"

FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL

Mommy, I'm home!

THE HOUSEWIFE

Hey baby, how was school?

LITTLE GIRL

Mommy, what happened to you and the

T.V. Room?

THE HOUSEWIFE

Oh, that good for nothin dog of

yours, got his little ass in the

living room and acted a damn fool,

that's what happened.

LITTLE GIRL

Barney did this?

THE    HOUSEWIFE

Now baby, you    can't come in here,

there's broken    glass all over the

floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

THE HOUSEWIFE

This is a old friend of mommy's I

ain't seen in a long time.

THE BRIDE

Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's

your name?

THE HOUSEWIFE

Her name is Nikki.

THE BRIDE

Nikki. What a pretty name for such

a pretty little girl. How old are

you Nikki?

THE HOUSEWIFE

Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a

question.

NIKKI

(to The Bride)

I'm four.

THE BRIDE

Four years    old, aye. You know I

once had a    little girl. She'd be

five right    now. Maybe you two could

of played    with each other.

THE HOUSEWIFE

Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some

grown-up talk to talk about, so you

go in your room now and leave us

alone till I tell you to come out.

THE HOUSEWIFE

(snapping her fingers)

Nikkia - in your room - now.

THE HOUSEWIFE

Want some coffee?

THE BRIDE

Yeah, sure.

THE HOUSEWIFE

Cream and sugar?

THE BRIDE

Both, please.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

This Pasadena homemaker's name is

Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.

Lawrence Bell. But back when we

were acquainted, five years ago,

her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her

code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine

was BLACK MAMBA.

THE BRIDE

Were you expecting me?

VERNITA

Yes and no. Bill got in touch with

me right after you woke up, and

then again a little later after

your episode in Japan.

(pause)

So I suppose it's a little late for

a apology, huh?

THE BRIDE

You suppose correctly.

VERNITA

Even if I was sincere?

THE BRIDE

Oh. I'm quite positive you're

sorry, now.

VERNITA

Look bitch, I need to know if

you're gonna start anymore shit

around my baby girl!

THE BRIDE

You can relax for now. I'm not

going to murder you in front of

your daughter.

VERNITA

That's being more rational than

Bill led me to believe you were

capable of.

THE BRIDE

Well that's a demonstration of

Bill's complete ignorance when it

comes to the subject of me, and

what I'm thinking, and what I might

do. It's mercy, compassion, and

forgiveness I lack, not

rationality.

THE BRIDE

I'll wait for now, but I won't wait

for long. I'll allow you to choose

a time and place for us to meet

again, preferably as far away from

Nikki as possible.

I could have just HIT you, I

didn't, I demand respect for that.

Since this is not a HIT, consider

it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly

Vipers, we will observe Viper rules

of honor. One on one - no help - no

bushwhackin - no treacherous

weapons - on weapon of choice - our

skill and our bodies.

VERNITA

*(BLEEP)*

THE BRIDE

- I'm not through telling you.

Failure to keep our date, or

duplicity of any kind, will result

in me putting a xoxo hollow point

bullet into the back of your skull

from a window of a building across

the street from Nikki's elementary

school. Now, feel free to respond.

VERNITA

Look...I know I fucked you over. I

fucked you over bad. I wish to God

I hadn't, but I did.

VERNITA

If I could go back in a machine I

would, but I can't. All I can tell

you is I'm a different person now.

THE BRIDE

I don't care.

VERNITA

Be that as it may, I know I do not

deserve mercy or forgiveness.

However, I beseech you for both on

behalf of my daughter.

THE BRIDE

-- Bitch, you can stop right there.

THE BRIDE

(leans in close)

Just because I have no wish to

murder you before the eyes of your

daughter, does not mean parading

her around in front of me is going

to inspire sympathy. You and I have

unfinished business.

And not    a goddamn fuckin thing

you've    done in the subsequent five

years -    including getting knocked

up - is    going to change that.

VERNITA

You have every right to wanna get

even --

THE BRIDE

-- But that's where you're wrong,

Vernita. I don't want to get even.

To get even, even Steven. I would

have to kill you, go into Nikki's

room, kill her, then wait for your

old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and

kill him. That would make us even.

No, my unborn daughter will just

hafta be satisfied with your death

at her mother's hands.

VERNITA

When do we do this?

THE BRIDE

It all depends... When do you want

to die? Tomorrow? The day after

tomorrow? That's about as long as

I'll wait.

VERNITA

How bout tonight, bitch?

THE BRIDE

Spendid. Where?

VERNITA

There's a baseball diamond where

our little league has its games,

about a mile from here. We meet

there around two-thirty in the

morning, dressed all in black, your

hair in a black stocking, and we

have us a knife fight, we won't be

bothered. I have to fix Nikki's

cereal.

THE BRIDE

Bill said you were one of the best

ladies he'd ever seen with an edged

weapon.

VERNITA

Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't

qualify it, so you can just kiss my

motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.

(snorts to herself)

Black Mamba, I shoulda been

motherfuckin Black Mamba.

THE BRIDE

Weapon of choice? And if you want

to stick with your butcher knife,

I'm cool with that.

VERNITA

Very funny.

VERNITA

Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please

don't...

THE BRIDE

Do to your daughter, what you did

to mine...

(she takes her hand)

...I won't.

THE BRIDE

It was not my intention to do this

in front of you. For that I'm

sorry. But you can take my word for

it, your mother had it coming. When

you grow up, if you still feel raw

about it, I'll be waiting.

ELLE

I might never of liked you. Point

in fact I despise you. But that

doesn't suggest I don't respect

you. You were a master of a

profession that's most difficult to

master.

Dying in our sleep is a luxury our

kind is rarely afforded. My gift to

you.

ELLE

Hello, Bill.

of your face, your eyes are two

different sizes. And look at your

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

Now after five years of beauty

sleep I knew absolutely nothing

about my enemies' strengths

weakness or whereabouts. But as

fated by God vengeance would have

it, I who knew nothing - knew one

thing. As sure as God made little

green apples...

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

(continued)

....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name

on my Death List, was still

alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren

Ishii, made her first acquaintance

with death at the age of eleven.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

It was at that age, a half-Chinese,

half-Japanese American Army brat

witnessed the murder of her Master

Sergeant father. And the rape, then

murder of her mother at the hands

of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza

boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore

revenge...luckily for her, Boss

Matsumoto was a pedophile.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

At thirteen, she got her revenge.

THE BRIDE

By twenty, she was one of the tip

top of female assassins in the

world.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

At twenty-three she joined Bill's

Deadly Vipers...

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

At twenty five she did her part in

the killing of eight innocent

people, including my unborn

daughter, in a small wedding chapel

in El Paso Texas. But on that day,

five years ago, she made one big

mistake...

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

...she Should of killed nine.

However, before statisfaction would

be mine, first things first...

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

English?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Almost -- American.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Ahhhh,...America, welcome...

Welcome... My English -- Very good.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Domo.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)

SUSHI CHEF

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

"Kon-netie-wa."

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

"Kon-nichi-wa?"

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Most impressive...you say Japanese

words, like you Japanese.

THE BRIDE

Now you're making fun of me.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

No no no - serious business.

Pronunciation - very good. You say

"Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

You should learn Japanese - very

easy.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

No kidding, I heard it's kinda

hard.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

What!

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

I always heard it was difficult.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Yes yes yes - most difficult. But

you have Japanese tongue.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Maybe I was Japanese in another

life.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Most definitely, most definitely

Japanese in another life.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

How did you know tuna's my

favorite?

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

What!

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Tuna's my favorite.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Ah, thank you very much.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

(to the bald man)

I beg your pardon?

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

- Drink -

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Ahhh sake,

(he holds up his thumb)

Very good.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

First time in Japan?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

A-huh.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

What!

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Yes, this is my first time.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

What brings you to Okinawa?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

I came to see a man.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Aaahh, you have friend live in

Okinawa?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Not quite.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Not friend?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

I've never met him.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Who is he, may I ask?

THE BRIDE

Hattori Hanzo.

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)

What do you want with Hattori

Hanzo?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I need Japanese steel.

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)

Why do you need Japanese steel?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I have vermin to kill.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

You must have big rats you need

Hattori Hanzo steel.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Huge.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

May I?

HANZO (ENGLISH)

Yes you may.....

HANZO (ENGLISH)

...try the second one down in the

sixth row on your left.

HANZO (ENGLISH)

Funny, you like samurai swords...

HANZO (ENGLISH)

...I like baseball.

HANZO (JAPANESE)

I wanted to show you these....

However someone as you, who knows

so much must surely know, I no

longer make instruments of death. I

keep these here for their ascetic

and sentimental value.

(he takes both sword and

sheath from her...)

Yet proud tho I am of my life's

work...

(...he closes them

together)

I am retired.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Then give me one of these.

HANZO (ENGLISH)

These are not for sale.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

I didn't say, sell me. I said, give

me.

HANZO (ENGLISH)

And why should I be obliged to

assist you in the extermination of

your vermin?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Because my vermin, is a former

student of yours. And considering

the student, I'd say you had a

rather large obligation.

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...You can sleep there...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...it will take me a week to make

the sword...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...I suggest you spend it

practicing.

FADE TO BLACK.

"One week later"

HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)

I'm done doing what I swore an oath

to God 28 years ago to never do

again. I've created, "something

that kills people." And in that

purpose I was a success.

FADE UP ON

HANZO (JAPANESE)

I've done this, because

philosophically I'm sympathetic to

your aim.

HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)

I can tell you with no ego, this is

my finest sword. If on your

journey, you should encounter God,

God will be cut.

HANZO (JAPANESE)

Revenge is never a straight line.

It's a forest. And like a forest

it's easy to lose your way...to get

lost...

to forget where you came in. To

serve as a compass, a combat

philosophy must be adopted that can

be found in the secret doctrine of

the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow

haired warrior, repeat after me;

HANZO (JAPANESE)

"When engaged in combat, the

vanquishing of thine enemy can be

the warrior's only concern...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...This is the first and cardinal

rule of combat...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...Suppress all human emotion and

compassion...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

...Kill whoever stands in thy way,

even if that be Lord God, or Buddha

himself...

HANZO (JAPANESE)

This truth lies at the heart of the

art of combat. Once it is

mastered... Thou shall fear no

one... Though the devil himself may

bar thy way...

THE BRIDE

Domo.

FADE TO BLACK.

Chapter Four

SHOWDOWN

at

HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES

CUT TO:

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

When fortune smiles on something as

violent and ugly as revenge, at the

time it seems proof like no other,

that not only does God exist,

you're doing his will. At a time

when I knew the last about my

enemies, the first name on my death

list, was the easiest to find. But

of course,    when one manages the

difficult    task of becoming queen of

the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't

keep it a    secret, does one?

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

At the age of twenty, Bill backed

his Nippon progeny financially and

philosophically in her

Shakespearian-in-magnitude power

struggle with the other Yakuza

clans, over who would rule vice in

the city of Tokyo.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

When it was all over, it was the

geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that

proved the victor.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

And just in case you're wondering

how could a half breed Japanese

Chinese American become the boss of

all criminal activity in Tokyo,

Japan,... I'll tell you. The

subject of O-Ren's blood and

nationality came up before the

council only once. The night O-Ren

assumed power over the crime

council.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

The man who seems bound and

determined to break the mood is

Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka

thinks is...

CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)

Tanaka? What's the meaning of this

outburst? This is a time for

celebration.

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)

And what exactly should I be

celebrating? The perversion of our

illustrious council?

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously

has something on his mind. Allow

him to express it.

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)

My father...

(looking at a clan head)

...along with yours and...

(looking at another)

...along With yours, started this

council. And while you drink like

fish and laugh like donkeys, they

weep in the afterlife over the

perversion committed today.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Silence!

(then composed)

Of what perversion do you speak,

Tanaka?

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)

I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the

perversion done to this council,

which I love more than my own

children,...by making a half

Chinese American its leader.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Fight me or work for me.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Drop them on the ground.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Get behind me.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Get on your knees.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Put your foreheads on the floor.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Keep your mouths shut.

O-REN

I'm going to say this in English so

you know how serious I am. As your

leader, I encourage you to -- from

time to time and always in a

respectful manner, and with the

complete knowledge that my decision

is final -- to question my logic.

If you're unconvinced a particular

plan of action I've decided is the

wisest, tell me so. But allow me to

convince you. And I will promise

you, right here and now, no subject

will be taboo...except the subject

that was just under discussion.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

(to a bodyguard)

Hand me that head.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

The price you pay for bringing up

either my Chinese or my American

heritage as a negative is, I

collect your fuckin head.

(now completely American)

Just like this fucker here. Now if

any of you sonsabitches got

anything else to say, now's the

fuckin time.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

I didn't think so.

(pause)

Meeting adjourned.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

The mop tops in black suits and

Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,

"The Crazy 88." The two young girls

in the schoolgirl uniforms are her

personal bodyguards, the Yubari

sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go

Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady

who's dressed like she's a villain

on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend

and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And

finally, the American in the black

suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's

head of security, Mr. Barrel.

END OF SHOT

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

(to Bride)

Can I help you?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Yes, I am looking for the attorney

of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would

that be you?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How

can I help you?

THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)

O-Ren Ishii! You and I have

unfinished business!

O-REN (JAPANESE)

You bastard!

The Bride

vs.

The Crazy 88

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid

we're going to have to close the

place. There's some private

business that we must attend to

now.

O-REN

Miki.

MIKI (JAPANESE)

You had it coming bastard!

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Tear the bitch apart!

O   -REN (ENGLISH)

(to the     Bride)

You didn't     think it was going to be

that easy,     did you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

(to O-Ren)

You know, for a second there, yeah

I did.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

Silly rabbit...

O-REN/THE BRIDE

...Trix Are for kids.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Those    of you lucky enough to still

have    your lives. Take them with

you.    But leave the limbs you've

lost.    They belong to me now.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Any more subordinates for me to

kill, O-Ren?

MR. BARREL

One last one.

THE BRIDE

You're Mr. Barrel, right?

MR. BARREL

And you're Black Mamba.

THE BRIDE

Our reputations precede us.

MR. BARREL

Apparently.

THE BRIDE

Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you

wear your Kato mask? Are you and

iconoclast?

MR. BARREL

I don't like that rubber band. It

fucks up my hair.

THE BRIDE

You shouldn't work for her.

MR. BARREL

Too late.

THE BRIDE

It's not too late to quit.

MR. BARREL

Do you have choices?

THE BRIDE

No.

MR. BARREL

I know exactly how you feel.

THE BRIDE

This has nothing to do with You and

I, and everything to do with me

taking satisfaction from that bitch

behind you. And there's absolutely

positively no way I'M going to

leave here without taking that

satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you

have to stand aside. And that means

you must quit, right now.

MR. BARREL

I can't.

THE BRIDE

Yes you can.

MR. BARREL

No I can't.

THE BRIDE

Don't say "Can't", there are no

"Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN (ENGLISH)

What are you waiting for? Are you

on a date? Attack her you fool!

THE BRIDE

Oh my God...

(pause)

...She just called you a fool. She

just called you a fool in front of

me. Not only am I your opponent.

I'm a female fellow countryman.

And you're going to risk your life -

to say nothing of harming me - for

a woman who refers to you as a

fool?

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Attack, Goddamn you!

THE BRIDE

I'll owe ya one.

MR. BARREL

The things I do for a pretty face.

MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)

I quit.

MR. BARREL

About that one you owe me.

THE BRIDE

Yes?

MR. BARREL

I'm gonna collect someday, you

know?

THE BRIDE

I'll be disappointed if you don't.

MR. BARREL

Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

Very funny.

(pause)

Your instrument is quite

impressive.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Domo.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Where was it made?

THE BRIDE

Okinawa.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Whom in Okinawa made you this

steel?

THE BRIDE

This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

YOU LIE!!

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Swords however never get tired. I

hope you've saved your energy. If

you haven't, you might not last

five minutes.

(pause)

Have you seen the garden in this

establishment?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

No.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Oh, you really should. It's quite

beautiful. Allow me.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

As last looks go, you could do

worse.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

Silly Caucasian girl likes to play

with samurai swords. Bill might of

humored you, but you will find

neither humor nor mercy at my

blade. Now unless you intend to

commit sepeku among the koi, stand

up and fight. You may not be able

to fight like a samurai, but you

can at least die like a samurai.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Attack me. With everything you

have.

O-REN (JAPANESE)

I apologize for ridiculing you

earlier.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Accepted.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Ready?

O-REN (JAPANESE)

Yes.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

That really was a Hattori Hanzo

sword...

O-REN (ENGLISH)

I always dreamed of owning one...

O-REN (ENGLISH)

Did he make it for you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Yes.

O-REN (ENGLISH)

...He must of liked you.

CUT TO:

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I've kept you alive for one reason.

Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,

I take it you're familiar with

Bill?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

In fact, I'd guesstimate, you

worked for Bill before O-Ren, and

that's how it is you came to work

for O-Ren. Am I correct?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I thought so. Give me the arm you

have left.

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

Why?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I want information. Now gimme your

arm.

THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)

The cocktail racing    through your

bloodstream at this    moment is

Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The

Undisputed Truth."

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Okay, first things first. Where was

the other Yubari sister? Yuki?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

Yuki's sick. She went home early.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Do tell? What's wrong with her?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

She has a cold.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Awwww poor baby. What do you think

she'll do when she finds out what

happened?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

She'll wail with grief.

SHOCK CUT TO

SOFIE

She'll drink excessively.

SOFIE

She'll start trouble.

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)

Do you like Ferraris?

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Ferrari...Italian trash.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Do you find me hot?

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck

me, yes or no?

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)

Yes.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

How bout now, big boy, do you still

wish to penetrate me...

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Or is it I who has penetrated you.

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

When she stops shedding tears,

she'll start shedding blood.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Best guess, what will she do?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

I don't hafta guess, she'll come

after you.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Will she ever give up?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

She won't have to. When she finds

you, I don't know who will win. But

what I do know is, she will find

you.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Is she more skilled than I?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)

Skilled won't be the word.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Don't be coy with me, bitch. What

would be the word?

SOFIE

Crazy.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Okay, now I want all the

information on the Deadly

Vipers,... What they've been doing

and where I can find them.

CUT TO:

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)

Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so

sorry.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)

Please forgive my betrayal --

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)

-- no more of that. I invented that

truth serum. Once it entered your

bloodstream, you no longer had a

choice.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)

But, still --

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)

-- But still -- nothing, except my

aching heart over what she's done

to my beautiful and brilliant

Sofie.

(pause)

If you had to guess why she left

you alive, what would be your

guess?

SOFIE (ENGLISH)

Guessing won't be necessary. She

informed me.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

I'm allowing you to keep your

wicked life for one reason and one

reason only. So you can tell him,

in person, everything that happened

here tonight. I want him to witness

the extent of my mercy..., by

witnessing your deformed body. I

want you to tell him, all the

information you just told me. I

want him to know what I know. I

want him to know I want him to

know.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

And I want them all to know,

they'll all soon be as dead as O

REN.

WE CUT TO A

BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)

If O-Ren was number one, unless

she's being tricky, Vernita Green

will be number two.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Where is Vernita Green?

BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)

Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.

But the woman you want will hold up

in a low budget motel, fifteen of

twenty minutes away from stepping

on board a plane departing LAX. If

I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

YUKI (ENGLISH)

California, here I come.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

You still are. One way.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

I know you feel you must avenge

YUKI (JAPANESE)

You call that begging? You can beg

better than that.

YUKI    (JAPANESE)

Can I see your    face? I've heard

your beauty is    exquisite. I would

like to see for    myself.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Sure.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face

is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

How do I look?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Very pretty.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

You're just saying that 'cause I

told you how pretty you are.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Yuki, you're gorgeous.

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Really? Is that how you'd describe

me to somebody if I wasn't here?

Yuki's gorgeous?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

You bet.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Don't make me kill you.

YUKI (ENGLISH)

Okay.

Gotcha!

Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

YUKI (JAPANESE)

Piss me off!

THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)

Yuki, in about two    minutes there's

going to be an army    of police here.

So if you're gonna    kill me, now's

the time.

THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)

So what's it gonna be bitch?

They call me Bill.

DOORMAN (O.S.)

Bill what?

BILL (O.S.)

That, no one ever calls me.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Open the door Alburt, let's see

what this Bill looks like.

L.F. O'BOYLE

Are you a policeman, Bill?

BILL

Not anymore?

L.F.

Let him play, Alburt.

L.F.

(to the players)

We now return to the game already

in progress. The point is nine

gentlemen, nine is the point...

ALBURT

I'll take that.

BILL

You'll have to.

L.F.

Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you

intend to start any shit with that

sword?

BILL

I give you my word of honor, I will

start nothing.

L.F.

Good enough for me.

(back to game)

ALBURT

Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred

dollar membership fee.

BILL

That's rather pricey.

ALBURT

You wanna play for free, go to

Vegas. You start now you'll be

there by sundown.

BILL

I think I'll stay here. I'm

thirsty.

ALBURT

That way.

BILL

Beer.

BARTENDER

Twenty dollars.

BILL

Twenty dollars for a beer?

BARTENDER

High cost of living shooter. You

don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

get a prime rib dinner there for

3.95.

BILL

What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.

(throws a 20 on the bar)

Pour the beer.

BILL

(pointing to the can)

I don't get that?

BILL

Cheers.

L.F.

Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid

in school wants    to play right away.

(to Bill)

How bout it new    kid, you wanna

handle my bones,    or do you just

like to watch?

BILL

I came to play.

L.F.

Boys take a look at this man, he's

what Webster's calls, a gambler.

The dice belong to you , sir.

L.F.

I hope you're not implying

anything, friend?

BILL

(as he inspects dice)

I'm not implying anything.

ALBURT

That did it fuckhead, you're out

the door --

BILL

You looked me over when I stood in

your doorway. I'm looking you over

as I step up to your table. If I

don't know, I don't throw.

L.F.

Are you satisfied?

BILL

More or less.

L.F.

I think we're getting into a

antagonistic relationship.

BILL

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were

trying to take my money, and I was

trying to take yours.

L.F.

It's just a game.

BILL

If you're game, take my bet

sportsman.

L.F.

Covered.

BILL

Shoot it all.

L.F.

Covered.

L.F.

The point is five, gentlemen, five

BILL

Shoot it all.

L.F.

Covered.

BILL

Shoot it all.

L.F.

Pretty lucky tonight, huh?

BILL

Play a game of luck long enough

you're bound to meet some lucky

people.

L.F.

You know we've never been properly

introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.

BILL

And I'm not interested.

L.F.

No, you're rude. Why so rude rude

boy, I'm only trying to be

friendly.

BILL

I didn't come here to make friends.

I came here to shoot a little crap.

But then your boy over there hits

me up for a two hundred dollar

bet?

BILL

Yes I would.....Shoot it

L.F.

What?

BILL

Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.

I'm betting I don't make it.

ALBURT

You can't do that.

BILL

Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's

perogative, and she knows it.

L.F.

Covered.

BILL

Can I use your phone?

L.F.

Sure it's next to the bed.

L.F.

Game's over, get out! Get the fuck

out! No more tonight, go home....

BILL

(into phone)

Vernita's dead? When?

(pause)

What about her family?

(pause)

Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone

completely apeshit. No idea where

she is?

(pause)

Okay that did it, we're going to

Texas and talk sense into Budd

before (BLEEP) makes him number

three.

BILL

We're going to have a talk about

this later.

(pause)

Well, I'm not exactly among friends

at the moment.

(pause...he laughs)

I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

BILL

Got a nose problem?

L.F.

I said you could use my phone. I

didn't say I wouldn't listen.

BILL

This is true.

L.F.

You didn't burn me down you know?

BILL

Course not. First rule of any

house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY

comes in and wipes the place out

insurance.

L.F.

If there weren't losers it wouldn't

be a game.

BILL

I sincerely hope you mean that.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,

the real game was just beginning.

Bill was on the job, and she was

the target. Now Bill was the

greatest assassin of the 20th

century. In fact the term HITMAN

was coined for him. And he rarely

performs actual assassinations

anymore. However every once in

awhile - to keep his hand in - he

does. Only he plays a game. He

doesn't start big trouble...he lets

them start it. If they do, they're

dead. If they don't, not only won't

he perform, he'll take the hit off

the market. It's kind of fun

watching people gamble when they

don't know they're gambling, isn't

it?

L.F.

Get my money back. Don't kill him.

Chop off all his fingers.

BILL

Do you know a Jessica?

BILL

Well, she knows you.

BUDD

Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a

mad rush of wild parties and

wealthy women.

BUDD

Is that that tall blonde one-eyed

Viking bitch in the passenger seat?

BILL

It's Elle. Want to say hello?

BUDD

Never said "bye," can't seem to

BUDD

What'd ya wanna talk about?

BILL

Are you not going to invite me in?

BUDD

No.

BILL

May I ask why not?

BUDD

It stinks in there, that's why. Now

what's so important it requires a

reunion?

TIME CUT

BUDD

You tryin to tell me she cut her

way through eighty-eight bodyguards

'fore she got to O-Ren?

BILL

No. There wasn't really eighty

eight of them, they just called

themselves The Crazy 88.

BUDD

Why.

BILL

I dunno, I guess they thought it

sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about

26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)

attacked. They all fell under her

Hanzo sword.

BUDD

She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

BILL

She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.

BUDD

He made her one? Didn't he swear a

blood oath never to make another

sword?

BILL

It would appear he's broken it.

BUDD

Them Japs know how to carry a

grudge don't they? Or is it just

you tend to bring that out in

people?

BILL

(pause)

I know this is a ridiculous

question before I ask, but you by

any chance haven't kept up with

your swordplay?

BUDD

Hell, I pawned that years ago.

BILL

You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

BUDD

Yep.

BILL

It was priceless.

BUDD

Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso

I got me 250 Dollars for it.

BILL

Since it was a gift from me, why

didn't you offer me the chance to

buy it back?

BUDD

Because that would've required me

to acknowledge your existence.

Drunken bum though I may be, I

don't need booze that bad. But who

the hell gives a crap anyway. That

bitch ain't gittin no Bushido

points for killin a white trash

piece of shit like me with a

samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a

titty bar, Bill. If she wants to

fight me, all she gotta do is come

down to the Club, start some shit,

and we'll be in a a fight.

BILL

-- Budd, you need to listen to me.

I know we haven't spoken for quite

some time, and the last time we

spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But

you need to get over being mad at

me, and start becoming afraid of

Bea. Because she is coming, and

she's coming to kill you. And

unless you accept my assistance, I

have no doubt she will succeed.

BILL

Can't we forget the past, and look

at the happy side of all this?

BUDD

And what would that happy side be?

BILL

She's brought "the boys" back

together.

BUDD

I appreciate the concern on your

face, but there's a difference

'tween "the boys", time can't

erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I

don't Jew outta payin my

comeuppance. That woman deserves

her revenge. And we deserve to die.

But then again, so does she. So I

guess we'll just see now, won't we.

TED

You're late, Budd, this shit ain't

school, ya know.

STRIPPER

Hey, Budd.

BUDD

Hey, Lucky.

STRIPPER

Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at

it again. There's shitty water all

over the floor.

BUDD

I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.

THE BRIDE

Shiner.

BUDD

Bet your sweet ass that don't sting

like a bitch.

BUDD

You done got a double dose of rock

salt, right in the ole tit.

Now not havin tits as fine or as

big as yours, I can't even imagine

how bad that shit stings...

BUDD

...But I don't wont to neather.

BUDD

Now I know when it    comes to a rock

salt burn, you're    feelin pretty

much like a expert    bout now. But

truth be told, you    ain't felt all

rock salt's got to    offer till you

took a double dose    in your

backside.

BUDD

That gentled ya down, didn't it?

Yep...ain't nobody a badass with

two barrels of rock salt dug deep

in their backyard.

ELLE

Bill?

BUDD

Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.

ELLE

....Budd?

BUDD

Bingo.

ELLE

And what do I owe this dubious

pleasure?

BUDD

I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't

never been caught.

ELLE

Do you mean what I think you mean?

BUDD

If you think I mean I got 'er, you

thought right.

ELLE

Did you kill her?

BUDD

Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do

it easy enough. She's so gentle

right now, I could preform her coup

de grace with a rock.

ELLE

What are you waiting for, run outta

liquid courage.

BUDD

No. It's just...I ain't killed

nobody in a long Goddamn time. And

just 'tween you, me, and Jesus

Christ, kinda made me a promise I

wasn't gonna. Be that however it

is. Back when I did kill people...I

got paid for it. Just don't seem

right...turn amateur this time of

life.

BUDD (O.S.)

Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my

hand right now.

BUDD

A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo

sword. And I'm here to tell ya

Elle, that's what I call sharp.

ELLE

How much?

BUDD

Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's

priceless and all.

ELLE

condition.

BUDD

What?

ELLE

You kill her tonight.

(pause)

And one more thing.

BUDD

You said one condition.

ELLE

It's a caveat to the same

condition.

BUDD

What?

ELLE

She must suffer to her last breath.

BUDD

That Elle darlin, I can pretty

damwell guarantee.

ELLE

Then I'll see you in the morning

millionaire.

CUT TO:

BUDD

Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

BUDD (SPANISH)

Look at those eyes. This bitch is

furious. You grab her feet, I'll

get her head.

(ENGLISH)

Got anything to say?

BUDD (SPANISH)

In America white women call this

the silent treatment.

(laughing)

And we let 'em think, we don't like

it.

BUDD

Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at

this.

BUDD

Looky here bitch, this is a can of

mace. Now you're goin underground

tonight, and that's all there is to

it. But, when I bury ya, I was

gonna bury you with this.

BUDD

But if    you're gonna act like    a

horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole

Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then

you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried

alive.    So what's it gonna be

sister?

BUDD

You may be stupid, but at least you

ain't bloody stupid.

THE BRIDE

Help me.

THE BRIDE

Well, now that you've had a nice,

good cry, let's figure out how to

get out of here? You're breathing

like you just been fuckin. Calm

down...close your mouth, and start

breathing short breaths, through

your nose.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

That's a lot better. But you're

still too agitated. Can you hear

your heart? It's like I'm buried

alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off

that flashlight.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

No! I can't turn off the light. Yes

you can. The darkness will have a

calming effect. Now turn off that

fucking light.

BUDD

(into phone)

Yellow?

ELLE

Didja do it?

BUDD

Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we

speak.

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

FADE TO BLACK.

Chapter eight

"The cruel tutelage

of Pai Mei"

"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

BILL (V.O.)

Once upon a time in China, some

believe around the year, one-double

knot-three.

BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)

...head priest of The White Lotus

Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the

road, contemplating whatever a man

with Pai Mei's infinite power would

contemplate -- Which is another way

of saying, who knows. When, a

Shaolin monk appeared on the road

traveling in the opposite

direction. As the monk and the

priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --

in a practically unfathomable

display of generosity, gave the

monk the slightest of nods. The

nod, was not returned. Was it the

intention of the Shaolin monk to

insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just

fail to see the generous social

gesture?

The motives of the monk, remain,

unknown. What is known, were the

consequences. The next morning Pai

Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,

and demanded that the temple's head

Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to

repay the insult. The Abbot, at

first, tried to console Pai Mei,

only to find, Pai Mei was

inconsolable. So began, the

massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and

all sixty of the monks inside, at

the fists of the White Lotus. And

so began, the legend of Pai Mei's

Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart

Technique.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

What praytell, is a ten-point palm -

exploding heart technique?

BILL (V.O.)

Quite simply, the deadliest blow in

all of the martial arts. He hits

you with his fingertips, at ten

different pressure points on your

body. And then, he lets you walk

away. But once you've taken five

steps, your heart explodes inside

your body, and you fall to the

floor dead.

THE BRIDE

Did he teach you that?

BILL

No. He teaches no one the ten-point

palm - exploding heart technique.

But he is Nietzsche's psalm

personified. If Pai Mei doesn't

kill you, he will make you

stronger. Now one of the things I

always liked about you, Kiddo, is

you appear wise beyond your years.

Then allow me to impart, a word to

the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -

Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash

him - even for an instant - a

defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

And if you throw any American sass

his way, he will snap your back and

your neck like they were twigs, and

that will be the story of you.

BILL

He'll accept you as his student.

THE BRIDE

Caught him in a good mood, aye?

BILL

More like a sadistic one.

BILL

Just seeing those steps again makes

me ache. You're gonna have plenty

of fun carrying buckets of water up

and down that fucker.

THE BRIDE

Why did he accept me?

BILL

Because he's a very very very old

man. And like all rotten bastards,

when they get old, they become

lonely. Not that that has any

effect on their disposition. But

they do learn the value of company.

THE BRIDE

When will I see you again?

BILL

That's the title of my favorite

soul song of the Seventies.

THE BRIDE

What?

BILL

Nothing. When he tells me you're

done.

THE BRIDE

When do you think that might be?

BILL

That my dearest, all depends on

you. Now remember, no backtalk, no

sarcasm.

Least not for the first year.

You're going to have to let him

warm up for you. He hates

Caucasians, despises Americans, and

has nothing but contempt for women,

so in your case, that may take a

little while. Adios.

THE BRIDE

(yelling)

Hello!

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)

Up the stairs, yankee woman!

THE BRIDE

(to herself)

More stairs, Jesus Christ.

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)

If it is Christ you seek, turn back

now.

THE BRIDE *

Teacher, I am unworthy to be your

student --

PAI MEI'S VOICE *

Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't

understand a single word you say.

It causes my ears discomfort. You

are not to speak unless spoken to.

Do you understand Mandarin any

better than you speak it?

THE BRIDE *

I speak Japanese very well --

PAI    MEI'S VOICE *

I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,

or Mongolian,    for that matter. I

asked if you    understand Mandarin?

THE BRIDE *

A little, I am still learning.

PAI MEI'S VOICE *

You are here to learn the mysteries

of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you

can't understand me, I will

communicate with you like I would a

dog. When I yell, when I point,

When I beat you with my stick!

PAI MEI *

Bill is your master, is he not?

THE BRIDE *

Yes, he is.

PAI MEI *

Your master tells me you're not

entirely unschooled. What training

do you possess?

THE BRIDE *

I am proficient in a combination of

Tiger and Crane style. And I am

more than proficient in the

exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.

PAI MEI *

(he makes a SNORTING

SOUND)

The exquisite art of the samurai

sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so

called exquisite art, is only fit

for Japanese fat heads. You really

are a silly ass.

PAI MEI *

Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

THE BRIDE *

I'm sorry master --

PAI MEI *

-- Silence! I do not wish to hear

your unintelligible excuses.

PAI MEI *

Your anger amuses me. Do you

believe you are my match?

THE BRIDE *

No.

PAI MEI *

Are you aware I kill at will?

THE BRIDE *

Yes.

PAI MEI *

Is it your wish to die?

THE BRIDE *

No.

PAI MEI *

Then you must be stupid. Rise

stupid, and let me get a better

look at your ridiculous face.

PAI MEI *

You breathe hard. The one hundred

steps robbed you of your wind. So

your stupidity is matched only by

your weakness. Is there anything

you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak

Japanese. I despise the Goddamn

Japs. I would of thought an

American would be immune to their

pompous posturing. Apparently I was

wrong. Go to that drawer.

PAI MEI *

Remove the sword.

PAI    MEI *

Let's see how    good you really are.

Try and land    a blow. If you land a

single blow,    I'll bow down and call

you master.

PAI MEI *

Come now woman, can't you even hit

an old man?

PAI MEI *

Your ability really is quite poor.

PAI MEI *

Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought

cripples who posed more of a

challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

PAI MEI *

From here you can get an excellent

view of my foot.

PAI MEI *

Give up? Or care to try again?

PAI MEI *

That blade's sharp. Careful not to

cut off your own arm.

PAI MEI *

If you can't fight any better than

that, what use do you have for a

leg?

PAI MEI *

Now that really would be a shame.

PAI MEI *

Your swordsmanship is amateur at

best.

PAI MEI *

I'm a hundred and fifty years old,

and you can't even make me break a

sweat.

PAI MEI *

Let's see your Tiger and Crane

style match my Eagles's Claw.

PAI MEI *

...pathetic.....terrible...you

idiot, you should've landed that

blow...you call that crane?...

Enough, I grow bored.

PAI MEI *

I asked you to show me what you

know, and you did. Not a goddamn

thing.

PAI MEI *

Like all yankee women, the only

thing you know how to do is order

in restaurants and spend a man's

money.

PAI MEI *

Excruciating isn't it? I asked you

a question!

THE BRIDE *

Yes!

PAI MEI *

I could chop off your arm at will.

I think I shall.

THE BRIDE

No please don't!

PAI MEI *

If you wish to speak romantic

languages, you've come to the wrong

place.

THE BRIDE *

Please don't cut my arm off!

PAI MEI *

It's my arm now. I can do with it

what I please. If you can stop me,

I suggest you try.

THE BRIDE *

I can't!

PAI MEI *

Because you're helpless?

THE BRIDE *

Yes!

PAI MEI *

Have you ever felt this before?

THE BRIDE *

No!

PAI MEI *

Compared to me you're as helpless

as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't

you?

THE BRIDE *

Yes!!!

PAI MEI *

THAT'S THE BEGGING!

PAI MEI *

Is it your wish to learn how to

make others as helpless as you

were?

THE BRIDE *

Yes.

PAI MEI *

Can you cook?

THE BRIDE *

Yes.

PAI MEI *

I'll be the judge of    that.

(pause)

Draw me a bath...your    training will

begin tomorrow. That    arm is still

mine. You may lose it    yet.

TIME CUT

PAI MEI *

Since your arm now belongs to me, I

want it strong. Can you do that?

THE BRIDE *

I can, but not that close.

PAI MEI *

Then you can't do it.

THE BRIDE *

I can put my hand through that at

six inches.

PAI MEI *

And you could shoot a man from a

rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,

if you so desired, but this is not

what I asked. What if your enemy is

three inches in front of you, what

do you do then? Curl into a ball?

Or do you put your fist through

him.

PAI MEI *

Now begin.

PAI MEI *

If you want to eat like a dog, I

will make you live and sleep like a

dog. Outside. If you want to live

and sleep like a human being, pick

up those sticks.

PAI MEI *

It's the wood that       should fear your

hand, not the other       way around. No

wonder you can't do       it, you

acquiesce to defeat       before you even

begin.

PAI MEI *

In that pit, is a rat.

PAI MEI *

In the sky, is a bird.

PAI MEI *

You are to go into that pit, and

catch that rat, with your bare

hands. If you catch the rat, I will

deem you the victor, and tonight

you will dine on bird. But, if you

can't catch the rat by sundown,

I'll deem the victor the rat. And

because of the disgrace to my

student, I will be forced to kill

it. And then I will force you, to

consume his body. Because to be my

student, you must develop a taste

for victory.

THE BRIDE *

I acknowledge defeat at the paws of

this rat. However, I will not eat

this filthy vermin. What I will

do...

(she RIPS the rat open

like a pomegranate)

...is consume his victorious heart.

(she snatches the tiny

heart from the rodent's

carcass. Holding it

between her fingers.)

But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

PAI MEI *

How does victory taste?

THE BRIDE *

Bitter.

THE BRIDE

(to herself)

Wow!

PAI MEI *

Woman, is that you who disturbs my

meditation?

THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yes, teacher.

PAI MEI *

Enter.

PAI MEI *

What news do you find so worthy, as

to disrupt my bath?

THE BRIDE *

I did it teacher. I put my fist

through the wall.

TIME CUT

PAI MEI *

Very good. Would you care to

demonstrate?

THE BRIDE *

I think you watching is making me

nervous.

PAI MEI *

Not only that, it has you speaking

before you were spoken to. Try

again.

PAI MEI

Impressive.

THE BRIDE *

Thank you teacher --

PAI MEI *

You still fight better than you

speak. Finally, a woman who

understands what's important.

PAI MEI *

Begin again.

THE BRIDE

I'd like a glass of water.

Chapter nine

"ELLE and I"

CUT TO:

BUDD

Want some breakfast?

ELLE

...So that's called a Texas

funeral?

BUDD

Yep.

ELLE

I got to give it to ya Budd, that's

a pretty fucked up way to die.

What's the name on the grave she's

buried under?

BUDD

Paula Schultz.

ELLE

Can I look at the sword?

BUDD

That's my money in that black case,

isn't it?

ELLE

Sure is.

BUDD

Well then, it's your sword now.

ELLE

So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

BUDD

That's a Hanzo sword alright.

ELLE

Bill tells me you once had one of

your own.

BUDD

Once.

ELLE

How does this one compare to that

one?

BUDD

If you're gonna compare a Hanzo

sword, you compare it to every

sword ever made -- wasn't made by

Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips

around this.

BUDD

So, which "R" you filled with?

ELLE

What?

BUDD

They say the number one killer of

old people is retirement. People

got'em a job to do, they tend to

live a little longer so they can do

it. I've always figured warriors

and their enemies share the same

relationship. So now you ain't

gonna hafta face your enemy on the

battlefield no more, which "R" are

you filled with, Relief or Regret?

ELLE

A little bit of both.

BUDD

Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a

little bit of both. But I know damn

well you feel one more than you

feel the other. The question was

which one?

ELLE

Regret.

BUDD

Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'

girl. I never saw nobody buffalo

Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.

Bill useta think she was so damn

smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,

she's just smart for a blonde.

ELLE

Want your money?

BUDD

Great day in the morning.

ELLE

Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude

of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like

to introduce my friend, The Black

Mamba.

(gesturing towards the

refridgerator)

Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You

know before I picked up that little

fella, I looked him up on the

internet.

(she removes her notepad

from her pocket)

Fascinating creature the Black

Mamba. Listen to this,

(reading from the notepad)

"...In Africa, the saying goes, in

the bush, an elephant can kill you.

A leopard can kill you. And a Black

Mamba can kill you. But only with

the Mamba, and this has been true

in Africa since the dawn of time,

is death sure. Hence its handle;

Death Incarnate."

(looking up from the

paper)

Pretty cool, huh?

(back to paper)

"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of

nature's most effective poisons,

acting on the nervous system

causing paralysis. The venom of a

Black Mamba can kill a human in

four hours, if say bitten on the

ankle or the thumb. However, a bite

to the face or torso can bring

death from paralysis within twenty

minutes.

(up from paper to Budd)

Now you should listen to this cause

this concerns you.

(reading from the paper)

The amount of venom that can be

delivered from a single bit can be

gargantuan.

(looks up from paper)

-- You know I've always liked that

word Gargantuan, and I so rarely

have an opportunity to use it in a

sentence.

(back to paper)

"If not treated quickly with anti

venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be

fatal to human beings. However, the

Black Mamba can deliver as much as

100 to 400 milligrams of venom from

a single bite."

ELLE

Now in these last agonizing minutes

of life you have left, let me

answer the question you asked

earlier, more thoroughly. When it

comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta

"R's" in me. Revenge is one.

Retribution is another. Rivalry is

definitely one. But I got another

"R" for that bitch you might be

surprised to find out. Respect. But

right at this moment, the biggest

"R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that

maybe the greatest warrior I have

ever met, met her end at the hands

of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky

piece of shit like you. The woman

deserved better.

ELLE

(into phone)

Bill...Elle. I have some tragic

news.

(pause)

Your brother's dead.

(pause)

I'm sorry baby.

ELLE (CONT'D)

She put a Black Mamba in his

camper.

(pause)

I got her, sweety.

(pause)

She's dead.

(pause)

Let me put it this way. If you ever

start feeling sentimental, go to

Austin, Texas. When you get here,

walk into a florist and buy a bunch

of flowers. Then you take those

flowers to Huntington cemetery on

Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the

headstone marked "Paula Schultz",

then lay them on the grave. Because

you will be standing at the final

resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

1ST GRADE TEACHER

Melanie Harrhouse.

MELANIE

Here.

1ST GRADE TEACHER

Beatrix Kiddo.

THE BRIDE

Here.

ELLE

I'm so sorry baby. --Look, I can

get there in about four hours,

should I come over?

(pause)

No no no no no, you need me baby.

I'm there.

(pause)

Okay, I'm leaving now, go smoke

some pot or something. I'll be

there soon.

ELLE

Bring it on, bitch.

ELLE

Now that's what I call sharp.

ELLE

Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that

alacky had got the best of you.

THE BRIDE

You thought wrong.

ELLE

(referring to the sword)

What's that?

THE BRIDE

Budd's Hanzo sword.

ELLE

He said he pawned it.

THE BRIDE

Guess that makes him a liar, don't

it?

THE BRIDE

(question)

Elle?

ELLE

(answer)

Bea.

THE BRIDE

I was wondering, just 'tween us

girls, what did you say to Pai Mei

for him to snatch out your eye?

ELLE

I called him a bastard.

THE BRIDE

Oooh, not so good.

ELLE

Were I to do it over again, I'd

bite my tongue.

THE BRIDE

One more question?

ELLE

Shoot.

THE BRIDE

Where's Bill?

ELLE

Villa Quatro.

THE BRIDE

Gulf of Mexico?

THE BRIDE

You wouldn't lie to me now?

ELLE

Why lie?

THE BRIDE

I saw what you did to that little

Mamba in there. Want to try that on

somebody your own size?

ELLE

I intend to.

THE BRIDE

Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before

we get started. Hattori Hanzo

swords are extremely sharp. They

can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.

Careful not to cut your own arm

off.

ELLE

I don't rattle, bitch!

THE BRIDE

You're gonna bleed though, you're

gonna bleed a lot.

FADE TO BLACK.

Final chapter

"The blood-splattered

BRIDE"

JOSEPHINA

Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you

to leave now.

BILL

(finishing up)

Yes, I got to go and meet the

Duchess.

(referring to the flowers)

Do you like it?

JOSEPHINA

Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.

BILL

Why don't you put it on the dinner

table, so we can enjoy it tonight.

JOSEPHINA

(she takes it)

Good idea, she'll love it.

BILL

Oh and Josephina, take the

remaining flowers and spread them

around the house, if you would.

JOSEPHINA

Yes, Mr. Bill.

BILL

You know I just had a great idea.

Take the roses, and spread the

petals on the bed I just got for

her. That'd be a nice thing to come

home to, wouldn't it, a bed of

roses.

JOSEPHINA

Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.

BILL

You wouldn't mind doing that for

me, would you Josephina?

JOSEPHINA

No, not at all.

BILL (SPANISH)

Get the fuck off the car, Lucy,

Lucy, down!

THE    BRIDE (V.O.)

The attentive    audience members

among you will    have probably

noticed, that    all my kills have

been straight    up fights.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)

Y'all figured I'd face him with my

Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured

Bill figured the same thing. I am

the product of three godfathers.

Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.

Different teachers teach you

different things. But one thing I

learned from all three, was "in

combat, the opponent that does the

unexpected, can usually expect to

be the victor." Bill would never

see this coming. Not from me. And

least any of you judge me a

bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill

who taught me how to shoot.

BILL

Hola.

THE BRIDE

Hello Bill.

BILL

Kiddo, is that really you?

THE BRIDE

Oh, it's me all right.

BILL

I hear you were driving a truck?

THE BRIDE

My pussy wagon died on me. Who's

your little friend?

BILL

Oh, you mean the little tow head

next to me, who looks

extraordinarily like you?

THE BRIDE

Yeah, that one.

BILL

Her name is B.B.

THE BRIDE

B.B.?

BILL

Yes. Do you approve?

THE BRIDE

Yes. Can she hear us?

BILL

Not now, she's in dream land.

THE BRIDE

How old is she?

BILL

What do you mean by that?

THE BRIDE

How many years has she been alive?

BILL

THE BRIDE

sitting on the steps with the

baguette in your hand. Since she

was one and a half years old, she's

slept with that picture of you next

to her bed.

THE BRIDE

You know, prettier photos of me do

exist.

BILL

And she's seen them. But the one

she wants looking after her while

she sleeps is the one of you

holding bread.

(pause)

We normally have dinner around

seven, is that convenient?

THE BRIDE

Yes.

THE BRIDE

When do we cross swords?

BILL

Well, it just so happens, my

hacienda comes with its very own

private beach. And my private

beach, just so happens to look

particularly beautiful bathed in

moonlight. And there just so

happens to be a full moon out

tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

want to sword fight, that's where I

suggest. But if you wanna be old

school about it - then we can wait

till dawn, and slice each other up

at sunrise, like a couple real life

honest to goodness samurais. As per

usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big

decisions up to you.

THE BRIDE

Do me a courtesy?

BILL

Anything.

THE BRIDE

Slow down as we pass...I want

another look at her.

BILL

Wear something nice tonight?

THE BRIDE

I have a dress all picked out.

BILL

Will I like it?

THE BRIDE

You said I looked beautiful last

time you saw me in it.

BILL

I'll dress up too.

THE BRIDE

You fucking maricone!

BILL

Now you just wait one second there

little missy. Unless I'm confused,

we are trying to kill each other

aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on

taking a shot at you in front of

the squirt, but, she is asleep. And

if you're gonna forget everything I

ever taught you, and gawk like you

ain't got good sense, I'm gonna

take a shot, am I not?

THE BRIDE

Did she wake up?

BILL

Of course not. She's like you that

way.

I look forward to this evening. It

was great speaking with you, Bea.

HANZO (JAPANESE)

(in phone; groggy)

Hello....

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

Hattori!

HANZO (ENGLISH)

Beatrix, what's wrong?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

CUT TO:

HANZO (JAPANESE)

Half of Bill's strength, lies in

his talent for the unexpected.

If you intend to vanquish this man,

and claim your daughter, you must

not only expect the unexpected. You

must do the unexpected.

THE BRIDE

Hello Manny.

THE BRIDE

Hello Josephina.

JOSEPHINA

Hello Miss Beatrix.

THE BRIDE

Stay in here and don't come out. If

you leave this room I'll shoot you,

comprende?

JOSEPHINA

Yes.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Kiddo! If you're through shooting

the servants, I'm in the living

room. You remember how to get to

the living room, don'tcha? Go down

to the end of the hall, and make a

left.

BILL

(loudly)

Bang Bang!

BILL

Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

BILL

Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B.

Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

BILL

Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot

you.

BILL

You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You

are-the fastest.

BILL

But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo

know,...that five-year-old B.B.

Gunn was only playing possum, due

to the fact she was impervious to

bullets.

B.B.

(to Mommy)

I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.

BILL

(to B.B.)

Hey, get back down there, you're

playing possum.

BILL

So, as the smirking killer

approached, what she thought, was a

bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when

the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B.

Bang bang!

BILL

Mommy, you're dead - so die.

THE BRIDE

Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have

known, you are the best.

B.B.

Don't die Mommy, I was just

playing.

MOMMY

I know baby.

B.B.

I waited a long time for you to

wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me

- I dreamed of you?

THE BRIDE

Every single night, baby.

THE BRIDE

Now let me look at you. My my my...

What a pretty girl you are.

B.B.

You're pretty too, Mommy.

THE BRIDE

Thank you.

BILL

When I showed you Mommy's picture,

tell Mommy what you said.

BILL

C'mon shy girl, you know what you

said, tell Mommy, it'll make her

fell good.

B.B.

I said - I said - You're the most

beautiful woman I ever saw in the

whole white world.

BILL

That's the truth. That's what she

said.

B.B.

What's that?

MOMMY

Oh, Mommy spilled something on her

dress.

B.B.

Blood?

MOMMY

No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?

B.B.

No.

BILL

Do you not like it, or do you not

know what it is?

B.B.

I do not know what it is.

MOMMY

Well, it's a very tasty beverage

that I used to drink, when I was a

little girl. It comes in a lot of

different flavors and colors, and

it's really good. Maybe we should

fix some sometime. Want to do that?

BILL

Speaking of fixing and drinking and

eating, I think it's dinner time

don't you?

BILL

(to Mommy)

When you were doin all that fancy

shootin, you didn't happen to shoot

a nice Mexican woman about forty

five years old, did ya?

MOMMY

No.

BILL

(wiping imaginary sweat

off his brow)

Whew, then dinner should be done.

(shouting to the other

room)

Josephina! You can come out now,

we're ready for dinner.

JOSEPHINA (O.S.)

Yes, Mr. Bill.

BILL

Want to go on top of the world?

B.B.

Yeah!

BILL

B.B., don't you think Mommy has the

prettiest hair in the whole wide

world?

B.B.

Yes I do.

BILL

In fact it's better than pretty.

What's better than pretty?

B.B.

Gorgeous.

BILL

Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is

gorgeous.

BILL

You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at

Daddy.

B.B.

BILL

(to Mommy)

(to B.B.)

B.B.

BILL

B.B.

BILL

B.B.

BILL

B.B.

BILL

(making his finger a gun)

B.B.

BILL

B.B.

BILL

B.B.

BILL

I was very sad. And that was when I

learned, somethings once you do,

they can never be undone.

B.B.

What happened to Mommy?

BILL

Why don't you ask Mommy.

B.B.

Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?

BILL

No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.

B.B.

Did it make you sick?

MOMMY

It put me to sleep. That's why I

haven't been with you B.B., I've

been asleep.

B.B.

But you're awake now, right?

MOMMY

I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

BILL

Did she go to sleep easy?

THE BRIDE

It took her a little bit. She was

excited. She's quite the little

chatterbox.

BILL

Well, if she doesn't like you, you

got to kill her to say hello. But

if she likes you, you can't shut

her up. She's a chip off the ole

blonde in that regards.

BILL

Red wine?

BILL

C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more

fun with a couple glasses of wine

in ya.

BILL

(pointing towards the

beach)

We're going to go out there and

have at it, aren't we?

BILL

Well, I've already had    a glass. So

unless you want to win    by an unfair

advantage, you should    have a glass

of wine. So we're both    on the same

footing wine wise.

BILL

You know, there's an old man down

here, his name is Esteban Viharo.

He was a pimp. I knew him when I

was a child. He was a friend of my

mother's. I told him about you.

When I showed him your picture he

smiles and said;

(imitating his accent)

"Yesss, I see the attraction." He

told me a story about taking me to

the movies when I was five. It was

a movie which had Lana Turner in

it. And whenever she would appear

on screen, he said I would stick my

thumb in my mouth and suck it, to

an obscure amount. And he knew

right then, this boy will be a fool

for blondes.

THE BRIDE

Who would of ever thought you'd be

such a good father?

BILL

Well not you, that's for damn sure.

THE BRIDE

Must we have to endure your little

zingers?

BILL

No we mustn't. But if you're going

to say sentences like that, in the

future, I will resist the

temptation.

THE BRIDE

Baby, you don't have a future.

BILL

I sent you to L.A. and you never

came back. I thought you'd been

killed. Do you know how cruel it is

to make someone think someone they

love is dead? I mourned you. Then

in the third month of my mourning,

I track you down. I wasn't trying

to track you down, I was trying to

track down - the fucking assholes -

who I thought killed you. And when

I find you, what to I find? Not

only are you not dead, you're

getting married - to some fuckin

jerk - and you're pregnant? How do

you expect me to react?

THE BRIDE

Why do you think I hid?

BILL

Why did you leave in the first

place? You have cold eyes towards

me now. I understand their

temperature, but they were warm the

second to the last time I saw them,

or was that just my imagination?

THE BRIDE

No.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

You sent me to L.A. to kill that

lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

BILL (ENGLISH)

You are you talking in Japanese?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

BILL

THE BRIDE

BILL

THE BRIDE

BILL

THE BRIDE

kill me in my hotel room. As I was

dancing in euphoria, the killer

came down the hall.

THE BRIDE

Hello, can I help you?

HOTEL WOMAN

Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the

hospitality manager of the hotel. I

have a welcome gift from the

management.

THE BRIDE

Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda

busy at this second, could you

possibly come back later?

KAREN

So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,

huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.

I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here

to kill you.

THE BRIDE

Wait a second!

THE BRIDE

Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did

come here to kill your sister. But

I'm not gonna do that now.

KAREN

Oh, I know you're not --

THE BRIDE

- listen to me! I just found out,

right now - not two minutes before

you blew a hole in the door, I'm

pregnant.

THE BRIDE

On that table is the    home pregnancy

kit. On the floor by    the door is

the strip that says    I'm pregnant.

I'm telling you the    truth, I don't

want to and I won't    kill your

sister. I just want    to go home.

KAREN

What is this, bullshit story number

twelve in the female assassin's

handbook?

THE BRIDE

Any other time you'd be a hundred

percent right. But this time you're

a hundred percent wrong. I'm the

deadliest woman in the world, but

right now I'm scared shitless for

my baby. Please, you hafta believe

me. Look at the strip, it's on the

floor.

KAREN

Sit down on that bed and put your

hands behind your head.

THE BRIDE

Blue means pregnant.

KAREN

I'll read it myself, thank you.

KAREN

Okay, say I were to believe you,

what then?

THE BRIDE

Just go home. I'll do the same.

KAREN

You fucked with the Wong sisters.

THE BRIDE

Facing Karen Wong, was the most

frightening moment I have ever

experienced. And that includes

three years with that evil bastard

Pai Mei. Before that strip turned

blue, I was a woman, I was your

woman. I was a killer, who killed

for you. Before that strip turned

blue, I would have jumped a

motorcycle on to a speeding train

...for you. But once that strip

turned blue, I could no longer do

any of those things. Not anymore.

Because now I was a mother. A

mother who only had one thought on

her mind. Please don't harm my

baby. Can you understand that?

BILL

Yes. But why tell me now, and not

then?

THE BRIDE

You wouldn't have let me go.

Specially once you found out I was

pregnant. You would've tried to

talk me out of it. It would have

been a big scene. I just said fuck

it.

BILL

Fuck who?

THE BRIDE

Bill, you couldn't know I was

pregnant, once you knew, you'd

claim it, and I didn't want that.

BILL

That's not your decision to make.

THE BRIDE

Yes, but it's the right decision.

And I made it for my daughter.

Everybody on this earth deserves to

start with a clean slate. But with

us - my daughter would be born into

a world she shouldn't be. Robbing

her of the one thing everybody

deserves. She would be born with

blood stains. I had to choose. I

chose her.

THE BRIDE

You know five years ago, if I had

to make a list of impossible things

that could never happen.

You performing a coup de grace on

me by bustin a cap in my crown,

would be right at the top of the

list.

(beat)

I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

BILL

I'm sorry was that a question? Of

impossible things that could never

happen - yes in this instance you

would have been wrong.

THE BRIDE

Well?

BILL

Well what?

THE BRIDE

Explain yourself.

BILL

I already have. When I told you the

story of when I thought you were

dead. Didn't you get how badly I

felt?

THE BRIDE

You call that an explanation?

BILL

Well if that's too cryptic let's

get literal.

(beat)

There are consequences to breaking

the heart of a murdering bastard.

You experienced some of them.

THE BRIDE

You and I have unfinished business.

BILL

Baby, you ain't kidding.

BILL

You know how proud I am of you,

don't you?

THE BRIDE

Yes.

BILL

You know I was rooting for you,

don't you?

THE BRIDE

I figured.

BILL

You know on that beach out there I

want you to be the victor?

BILL

You also know you're going to have

to defeat me. I can't just give it

to you, even though I want to.

THE BRIDE

It won't be necessary for you to

give me anything. I've surpassed

you. I'll take it.

BILL

Well, as they say in Missouri, show

me.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Attack me.

BILL

(to himself)

That's my girl.

BILL

He taught you the ten point palm

exploding heart technique?

THE BRIDE

Of course he did.

BILL

Why didn't you tell me?

THE BRIDE

I don't know...Because...I'm

a...bad person.

BILL

No. You're not a bad person. You're

a terrific person. You're my

favorite person. But every once in

awhile...you can be a real cunt.
