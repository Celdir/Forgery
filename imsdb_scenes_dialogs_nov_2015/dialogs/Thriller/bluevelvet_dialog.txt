CUT TO:

COLLEGE BOY

Louise? Where's Jeffrey? His mother's on

the phone - it's an emergency.

LOUISE

He disappeared to the men's room a little

while ago. I'm getting very tired of

waiting - let's go find him.

JEFFREY

Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't

force girls!

COLLEGE BOY

Jeffrey, your mother's on the phone. It's

an emergency.

LOUISE

Thanks for keeping me waiting so long.

JEFFREY

JEFFREY

Hello. Mom? What's wrong with Dad?.

What's happening?. Come home? Sure I will.

MRS. BEAUMONT

I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in

the middle of the term.

CUT TO:

MRS. BEAUMONT

(now looks very tired and

poor health)

Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition

is serious. It's going to cost so much.

We just won't have the money to keep you

in school. I'm telling you this now, so

that you can get your things together and

check out of school, honey, or whatever you

have to do. it'll save you another trip back.

You're going to have to work at the store.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

(crying)

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Can't you come to the damn airport?

LOUISE

Jeffrey. I can't. I really can't. I

have to go to that class tonight. I can't

get out of it. I really can't. I love

you, Jeffrey. I'll miss you.

JEFFREY

Alright. I'll call you in a couple of days,

you know. I'll let you know how things are.

LOUISE

Okay. I'll be here. You better git-going. I

gotta go too sweetie. I hope your father's

okay. I love you. I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

I love you too, Louise. Damn it. I'll see you.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara.

MRS. BEAUMONT

(a bit concerned)

Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY

This is it.

JEFFREY

I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is

all I have.

AUNT BARBARA

You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice

flight?

JEFFREY

Yeah. How's Dad?

MRS. BEAUMONT

He's alright. We'll tell you on the way home.

MRS. BEAUMONT

He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think

there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or

something in there. They're doing all sorts

of tests. On the surface, he looks pretty

good, but there are problems. They think he

may have to stay in two weeks now, at least.

You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey.

AUNT BARBARA

They tore down the A & P, Jeffrey. Did you

see that?

JEFFREY

Aunt Barbara that was 5 years ago.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

AUNT BARBARA

Home again, home again, jiggidy jog.

CUT TO:

MRS. BEAUMONT

Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

JEFFREY (V.O.)

(calling)

Be right down.

AUNT BARBARA

This is marvelous jam. Are you going this

morning?

MRS. BEAUMONT

I think Jeffrey would like to see his father

alone.

JEFFREY

What time are visiting hours?

MRS. BEAUMONT

I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for

10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk

over; I need the car this morning.

JEFFREY

Well. Okay.

MRS. BEAUMONT

Jeffrey, when you see your father.

JEFFREY

Yeah?

MRS. BEAUMONT

He doesn't know you're out of school. He

thinks it's a vacation for you.

JEFFREY

What?

MRS. BEAUMONT

It would be too much for him. So please

let him think as he does, that you're

home just to see him.

JEFFREY

Thanks a lot, Mom.

MRS. BEAUMONT

.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave

AUNT BARBARA

I think it's important not to get depressed.

Depression is a terrible thing. They say it

can bring on illness.

JEFFREY

(angry)

Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

CUT TO:

NURSE CINDY

Please wait outside while Dr. Gynde prepares

him to see you.

JEFFREY

Prepares him?

DR. GYNDE

Hello Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?

DR. GYNDE

He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very

important that your father doesn't try

to move. he's been immobilized. It would

be very painful for him. sit close. you do

the talking and moving. He knows you're

here. He became very emotional. I don't

think he likes the idea of you seeing him

like this.

NURSE CINDY

(smiling a big smile)

Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.

JEFFREY

(shocked but concealing it)

Hi Dad.

MR. BEAUMONT

(speaking as plainly as possible,

but sounds like mumbling)

Hey Jeff.

JEFFREY

Looks like they've got you strapped in

pretty good.

MR. BEAUMONT

(lips moving but hardly any sound)

uh uh.

JEFFREY

Are you feeling okay?

MR. BEAUMONT

(more mumbling)

uh uh.

MR. BEAUMONT

(more plainly but under strain)

Good to see you, son.

JEFFREY

(holding back tears)

It's good to see you, Dad.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Hello. could you tell me if Detective

Williams is still working here?

POLICE OFFICER

He's up in Room 221. Right up the stairs.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Are you Detective Williams?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Yes.

JEFFREY

My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near

you. I believe you know my father, Tom

Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Sure I do. I understand he's in the

hospital. How is he?

JEFFREY

He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're

doing tests, that's why I'm home from

school. I was over at the hospital this

morning and I was going home and in the

field behind our neighborhood. there

behind Vista, I found an ear.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(matter of factly)

You did? A human ear?

JEFFREY

Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I

thought I should bring it to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(continuing)

That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't

it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's

Office and see what they make of it. Then,

I want you to show me exactly where you

found it.

CUT TO:

CORONER'S OFFICER

The tests will take awhile. Meanwhile,

we'll check the morgue records. I don't

recall anything coming in minus an ear.

CORONER'S OFFICER

(continuing)

Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a

heart, or even an arm, we would assume

that there was a corpse, however, a finger

or an ear. the person may very well be

alive somewhere.

JEFFREY

What can you tell about the person from the

ear?

CORONER'S OFFICER

Well. when the tests are done, quite a lot

. Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear

came off a dead person. Right now, I know

what you know. It's a real human ear. The

human was, or is, Caucasian.

. also. It looks like the ear was cut off

with scissors.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going

to the press and I'm going to ask you to

consider all you've heard strictly

confidential. Do not discuss this business

with anyone, but me, or other police

personnel. Got it?

JEFFREY

Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much

as you did.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Hello?. LOUISE WERTHAM please. Louise?

. is she there?. Louise?

(very happy)

Yeah! How are you? He's okay. in the

hospital for tests.

(very serious)

I miss you so much.

(smiling now)

What have you been up to?. Louise, I don't

know. I've got to see how my father is

. It costs a fortune in that hospital.

When did he ask you to that?. Look. I

can't stop you. Go ahead. Just go ahead

. I may never be back, go. ahead. Look

Louise, stop trying to explain everything.

Just do it. let's talk again in a couple

of days or somethin', okay?. Yeah, I still

love you. Goodbye Louise. Goodbye.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

I'm going out for awhile.

MRS. BEAUMONT

(looks at her watch)

Do you want the car?

JEFFREY

No, I'm just gonna walk around.

MRS. BEAUMONT

Alright.

AUNT BARBARA

Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln,

are you?

JEFFREY

(yelling back)

No. I'm just going to walk around the

neighborhood. Don't worry.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey

Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

MRS. WILLIAMS

Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back

JEFFREY

I just wanted to ask him a few questions,

that's all. Maybe I better go.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Really, he'll be home soon, would you like

a cup of coffee?

JEFFREY

(thinks a bit)

Alright.

MRS. WILLIAMS

I was sorry to hear about your father. I

know your mother from church. It's such a

shame.

JEFFREY

Yeah, I know.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Would you like a piece of cake?

JEFFREY

No. No thank you.

MRS. WILLIAMS

It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan

Hines' devil's food. real good.

JEFFREY

Yeah. okay.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Sandy?.

MRS. WILLIAMS

(continuing)

Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy, and.

her boyfriend, Mike.

SANDY

Mike's gotta go.

(to Jeffrey)

Nice to meet you.

MIKE

Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.

JEFFREY

Yeah. It was nice meeting you too.

MRS. WILLIAMS

(smiles)

He comes over to study.

JEFFREY

(smiles big)

Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS (V.O.)

Pam?

MRS. WILLIAMS

In the kitchen, John!

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Oh. Hello, Jeffrey. what's up?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Come into the study a minute.

JEFFREY

(getting up)

Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Certainly.

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(to Jeffrey)

Shut the door.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(continuing; in radio)

Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him

to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.

(clicks off radio, turns to Jeffrey)

Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is

very interesting to us. Very interesting.

I know you must be curious to know more.

(scratches the middle of his back)

But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask

you not only not to tell anyone about your

find, but also not to ask more about the

case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll

let you know all the details. Right now,

though. I can't.

JEFFREY

I understand. I'm just real curious like

you said.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

I was the same way when I was you age. I

guess that's what got me into this business.

JEFFREY

It must be great.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

And it's horrible too.

(a cold look comes over

Detective Williams)

I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to

be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

JEFFREY

(calling into the kitchen)

Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

MRS. WILLIAMS

(coming out from the kitchen)

Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet

you, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

Say "goodnight" to Sandy.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

We will. Good night.

SANDY

Are you the one that found the ear.

JEFFREY

Yeah, how did you know?

SANDY

(coyly)

I just know, that's all. I remember you

from Central.

JEFFREY

Oh yeah?

SANDY

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run

for some office?

JEFFREY

Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be

studying or something.

SANDY

Am I bothering you?

JEFFREY

No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

SANDY

Yes.

JEFFREY

How is Central these days?

SANDY

Terrible. boring.

JEFFREY

What else is new?. right?

SANDY

Yeah. What are you doing now?

JEFFREY

I'm home from school. My father's in the

hospital.

SANDY

That's too bad.

JEFFREY

What do you know about the ear?. anything?

SANDY

Didn't my father tell you not to talk about

it?

(she smiles)

JEFFREY

Come on. you brought it up. Do you know

anything?

SANDY

I don't really know much but bits and pieces

. I hear things. My room is right above my

father's office. The ear. there's no corpse

in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come

off a living person. That's direct from the

Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.

There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on,

but I think there are some people who were

brought in for questioning on a murder case

that could have something to do with the ear.

I heard some of the same names.

JEFFREY

Do you know who was brought in for

questioning?

SANDY

There were at least three, maybe four. But

a name that keeps coming up is this woman

who lives in an apartment building very

close to your house and also close to the

field where you found the ear. There's

also a business man over by the Franklin

factory district that was questioned. and

a musician. and some others.

JEFFREY

Were all these people questioned this

afternoon?

SANDY

No. this has been going on for some time

. several months. About six months ago

some parts of bodies were found down by

the river. They were from people who were

reported missing. They never found one

complete body. only parts.

JEFFREY

The ear is from a missing person maybe?

SANDY

Maybe so.

JEFFREY

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know

what building the woman lives in?

SANDY

Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.

They've had her under surveillance for a

couple of months, except I don't know what

they've found out because my father isn't

in charge of her.

JEFFREY

I guess you have to get back home soon?

SANDY

Not really, why?

(then she understands)

You want to see the building?. Come on,

I'll show you.

CUT TO:

SANDY

(nodding toward building)

That's the building. She lives on the

Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long

. the police are watching.

JEFFREY

Where are they?

SANDY

I don't know. you're not supposed to see

them. They're supposed to see you.

JEFFREY

Did they find out anything when they

questioned her?

SANDY

I don't know. like I said, she's not my

father's case.

JEFFREY

Oh yeah. What about those other people?

. Anything?

SANDY

My father is watching the businessman.

The businessman had a partner who

disappeared. left his whole business and

family, his wife and two kids. They think

he's been murdered.

JEFFREY

You really do hear a lot, don't you?

SANDY

Yeah, I guess so.

(they continue walking)

What are you going to do now that you're

home?

JEFFREY

I have to help out in my father's hardware

store. they're giving me sort of my own

hours for a while. which is nice.

SANDY

Still, it must be kinda rough.

JEFFREY

It's not bad. but it's bad enough.

it's a lot worse for my father.

(Jeffrey points to a house)

I used to know a kid who lived there and who

had the biggest tongue in the world.

SANDY

What happened to him?

JEFFREY

I don't know. he moved away.

CUT TO:

SANDY

I've gotta go in.

JEFFREY

Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking

to you.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

I guess I'll see you sometime.

SANDY

I guess so. Like you said. It's a

strange world.

JEFFREY

(smiles)

Yeah. Good bye.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying

rigs later on?

ED

Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs

they're yours.  It causes me no pain.

JEFFREY

Okidoke Ed. Thanks.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

You hungry or thirsty, or both?

SANDY

(taken back)

I don't know.

JEFFREY

I'd like to talk to you about something.

SANDY

Just a minute. pull over and wait a

minute.

SANDY

(to the girls)

Please, don't say anything to Mike.

promise?

JEFFREY

I don't want to cause any trouble.

SANDY

I'm here, aren't I?

JEFFREY

(smiling as though he knew)

I guess Mike's got some sort of sports

practice in the afternoon.

SANDY

Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too

smart.

CUT TO:

SANDY

Alright, now tell me. What is it?

JEFFREY

There are opportunities in life for gaining

knowledge and experience. sometimes, in

some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.

I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could

learn a lot by getting into that woman's

apartment. you know. sneak in and hide

and observe.

SANDY

You said it was a strange world.

and you're the strangest part of it. Are

you crazy.she is possibly involved in

murder. This gives me the creeps.

JEFFREY

Settle down. I have a plan which I think

will work. There is very little for you

to do, but I do need your help.

.Aren't you curious about my plan?

SANDY

(thinking and intrigued, plus she

is beginning to like Jeffrey)

It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

JEFFREY

(getting excited)

Alright. the first thing is to get into her

apartment and open a window that I could

crawl into later.

SANDY

Now, how are you going to do that?

JEFFREY

Right out in the car I happen to have some

old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will

go to her apartment and be the pest control

man. I will spray her apartment. After a

few minutes you will knock on her door,

drawing her attention away from me and I

will then jimmy a window.

SANDY

What will I say when she comes to the door?

JEFFREY

You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a

few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't

have to keep her very long. a few seconds

is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

SANDY

I don't know. it sounds like a good

daydream, . but actually doing it is too

weird. too dangerous.

JEFFREY

Let's just try the first part. If that

goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one

will suspect us, because no one would

believe two people like us would be crazy

enough to do something like this.

SANDY

You've got a point there.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

Now. we'll walk over so there's no license

plates and you give me at least three

minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I

need time to find a good window .alright?

SANDY

Alright.

JEFFREY

Let's go.

JEFFREY

Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute,

what's her name?

SANDY

Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh

Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number,

bright boy.

JEFFREY

Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good

luck . three minutes, no sooner.

SANDY

Alright. Good luck, yourself.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

OLD LADY

Well, it's about time you came.

JEFFREY

(to himself)

That's a good sign.

DOROTHY

Yes? What is it?

JEFFREY

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

DOROTHY

Oh God, that stuff stinks.

JEFFREY

(as he goes in)

Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

DOROTHY

Oh yeah, that's good.

DOROTHY

What is this. Grand Central Station?

JEFFREY

(to Dorothy)

That oughta do it.

DOROTHY

Yeah.

SANDY

Are you alright?

JEFFREY

Yeah. let's get outta here. What

happened?

SANDY

I was just about to go to the door, when

that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

JEFFREY

Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

SANDY

No. I only saw his back. He went down

another stairwell at the end of the hall.

JEFFREY

I didn't get a good look at him either, but

he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to

get a window, but I found this key.

(he shows it to her)

Pretty nifty, huh?

SANDY

Yeah, if it opens the door.

JEFFREY

Yeah.

JEFFREY

You go first.

SANDY

So. what's next?

JEFFREY

Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

SANDY

I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

JEFFREY

You didn't goof it up, but. you still

owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight.

It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

SANDY

Yes. I do.

JEFFREY

Well, it's Friday night and you're a

beautiful girl. I guess you would have

a date. that does that.

SANDY

You really want to do this, don't you?

JEFFREY

I don't want you to get involved, really,

I mean, I do, but if something went wrong

I mean, like you said, they may be involved

in murder.

SANDY

(making up her mind - against

her better judgment)

I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game

tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.

Afterwards he can go out with the guys.

Just so the record is kept straight though,

I love Mike. What do want me to do?

JEFFREY

(studies her a moment, then)

First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.

Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

SANDY

I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on

Route 7.

JEFFREY

Great. I'll pick you up around eight

o'clock. Is that good?

SANDY

Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may

think it's strange. I'll walk over to your

house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

JEFFREY

Okay. You better get out before someone

sees us.

JEFFREY

See ya!

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. GYNDE

That will take care of you, Frances, for

another week. I don't want you to overdo

things either. Take it very easy.

AUNT BARBARA

I'll see to it, Bill.

DR. GYNDE

Good.

MRS. BEAUMONT

I feel fine.

DR. GYNDE

That's not the point. You're under a great

deal of stress. don't overdo it. don't

be foolish.

JEFFREY

Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.

What's going on?

AUNT BARBARA

I'm not sick.

AUNT BARBARA

(continuing)

We'll see who stays in my will.

JEFFREY

(to his mother)

Can I use the car tonight?

MRS. BEAUMONT

Of course, Jeffrey.

SANDY

What's the plan.

JEFFREY

First of all, we're going to the Slow Club

to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for

awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway,

and then also we'll know she is there and

not in her apartment.

SANDY

Brilliant.

JEFFREY

Then we'll drive back to her apartment and

I will plant myself there.

SANDY

This is not my usual Friday night!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SLEAZY MAITRE D'

(French accent)

Good evening. two?

JEFFREY

Yeah. Could we get a small table in the

back?

SLEZY MAITRE D'

Surely, come this way.

MAITRE D'

May I get you something to drink?

JEFFREY

I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.

SANDY

(she might as well)

That sounds good.

JEFFREY

Two.

MAITRE D'

Two Heinekens, thank you.

JEFFREY

(to Waiter)

When does Dorothy Vallens come on?

WAITER

(flustered; overworked)

I don't know. pretty soon. Who knows.

SANDY

That guy was filled with information.

JEFFREY

(raising his glass)

Here's to. an interesting experience.

SANDY

I'll drink to that.

DISSOLVE TO:

M.C.

(very low key)

Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.

Miss Dorothy Vallens.

CUT TO:

SANDY

Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

JEFFREY

Why not?

SANDY

It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I

shouldn't have told you.

JEFFREY

It'll be okay. I don't think you should

wait out here though. I think you should

go home. Can you drive this car?

SANDY

Yeah. but.

JEFFREY

Leave it in the front of your house for me.

okay?

SANDY

O.K.

JEFFREY

Could you wait a little while. this key may

not fit.

SANDY

. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't

make any sense. Let's go somewhere and

have some coffee.

JEFFREY

I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow

and tell you how it went.

SANDY

I. I don't want to see you tomorrow.

Mike's coming over.

JEFFREY

Oh, okay. can I call?

SANDY

Okay. yeah, call.

JEFFREY

Look. it can wait till Sunday.

SANDY

Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope

you can sneak out okay. You're going to

wait until she's asleep?

JEFFREY

Yeah.

SANDY

I'm going to wait here until she comes.

JEFFREY

Are you sure?

SANDY

I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and

know she's on her way up. Okay?

JEFFREY

Okay. thanks.

SANDY

I don't know if you're a detective or a

pervert.

JEFFREY

That's for me to know and for you to find

out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

SANDY

Okay, okay. Bye.

Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in

my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

JEFFREY

I wanted to see you.

DOROTHY

What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you

here?

JEFFREY

Nobody.

DOROTHY

Shit. You better tell me something.

JEFFREY

I was. an experiment. Just to see if

I could do it.

DOROTHY

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

JEFFREY

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.

I really didn't mean to do anything but

see you.

DOROTHY

Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

JEFFREY

(scared, nervous)

. I saw you come in, talk on the phone.

DOROTHY

(interrupting)

The phone. What did you hear on the phone

JEFFREY

(trying to remember)

You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to

talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.

You said something about Momma loves you.

and something about a Meadow Lane.

any more.

DOROTHY

That's right. That's what I said. You

have a good memory. Then what?

JEFFREY

Well.

DOROTHY

THEN WHAT?

JEFFREY

Then you got undressed.

DOROTHY

How many times have you sneaked into girls'

apartments and watched them undress?

JEFFREY

(quietly; feeling guilty)

Never before this.

DOROTHY

How'd you like it if someone sneaked into

your house and watched you.

(gets an idea)

Get undressed. I want to see you.

JEFFREY

No. Come on.

DOROTHY

NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I

want to see you.

Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

DOROTHY

DOROTHY

(continuing)

Come closer.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

What do you want from me?

JEFFREY

(quietly, getting very hot)

I . I don't know.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

What do you want?

DOROTHY

Don't move. don't look at me.

DOROTHY

Do you like that?

JEFFREY

Yes.

DOROTHY

Don't move or I'll kill you.

DOROTHY

(continuing)

Do you like talk like that?

JEFFREY

No.

DOROTHY

Lie down on the bed.

DOROTHY

(whispers, frantic)

Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't

say anything or you'll get killed. I mean

DOROTHY

DOROTHY

an army order to himself)

FRANK

(high voice)

Baby wants blue velvet.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

Okay.

FRANK

Don't look at me!

FRANK

Don't look at me!!!

(heavy breathing)

Daddy's home.

FRANK

(screaming)

Don't look at me!!!

FRANK

Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!

JEFFREY

Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll

help you.

DOROTHY

Don't.

(referring to the sheet)

I don't like that. What do you want?

JEFFREY

Nothing. Are you alright?

DOROTHY

Sure I'm alright.

(she starts crying again)

JEFFREY

I'll go then.

DOROTHY

Don?

JEFFREY

No.

DOROTHY

Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.

Please.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

Thank you. honey.

JEFFREY

(whispering)

It's okay. It's okay.

DOROTHY

Do you like the way I feel?

JEFFREY

(hesitates)

Yes.

DOROTHY

See my breasts?  . See?

JEFFREY

Yes.

DOROTHY

See my nipples?

JEFFREY

Yes.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

You can kiss them if you want. Fell them

. They're getting hard.

DOROTHY

(continuing)

Go ahead. I don't mind.

DOROTHY

Feel me.

DOROTHY

You can hit me, if you want to.

JEFFREY

No. please. I won't.

JEFFREY

Stop it!

DOROTHY

(whispering)

Do you like me?

JEFFREY

(whispering)

Yes, I like you.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

You can be my special friend and come and

put that in me.

JEFFREY

What's the matter?

DOROTHY

Get off me.

DOROTHY

I made it go down the toilet.

JEFFREY

What?

DOROTHY

I made it go down the toilet.

JEFFREY

(inner voice)

Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has

left a present for Dorothy? What was it?

An ear? Another ear?!!

(out loud, to Dorothy)

What was it?

DOROTHY

(strangely - extremely frightened

now that Jeffrey may have left it)

Do you know?

JEFFREY

No.

DOROTHY

(breathing heavily, strangely)

You don't?

JEFFREY

No. What is happening?

DOROTHY

Maybe you don't know. I know you though.

You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where

you live and I know ways to get you and I

know ways to kill you.

JEFFREY

Please don't talk like that. You're upset.

I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I

did. I better go.

DOROTHY

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now

but I want you. I like you.

JEFFREY

Then don't talk about killing.

DOROTHY

Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?

(laughs)

Sometimes I think it would be fun.

(strange smile)

Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't

open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little

secret.

(she leans close)

I want to die.

JEFFREY

Don't say that.

DOROTHY

It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day

I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep

now.

JEFFREY

(frightened by her craziness)

O.K.

JEFFREY

I'm leaving now.

DOROTHY

(very faint whisper)

Help me. help me. please help me.

JEFFREY (V.O.)

Don. Oh my God.

JEFFREY

(startled)

God. you scared me.

MRS. BEAUMONT

Is something wrong? What's happened to

your face?

JEFFREY

Nothing. I'm fine.

MRS. BEAUMONT

You can't just stay out half the night and

carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some

order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have

been nice to call your father when you got

home but now it is much too late.

JEFFREY

Louise Wertham, please. okay.

(waits)

Louise?. Jeffrey. Hi. What's up?

(pause)

MARRIED?! Good night! Louise! Are

you kidding?

(long pause)

Well, Louise, I wish you a lot of

luck and if things don't work out,

JEFFREY

(to himself, out loud)

How can I help her? I can't tell her to go

to Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a

policeman. She has my address. She can go

there. if she has to. I'll tell her. and

her. and she thinks I'm Don. her husband?

Where the hell is Don? - maybe he died.

JEFFREY

Hello?. Mrs. Williams?. This is Jeffrey

Beaumont. Fine. Okay. Is Sandy there?

Okay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.

Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.

It went okay. I'll tell you about it.

Dinner?. Tomorrow night? Seven o'clock,

yeah, sounds good. Okay. he's still in

the hospital. Okay, yeah. See you

tomorrow. thanks.

JEFFREY (V.O.)

This is what my father's disease looks like?

DR. GYNDE

Yes.

JEFFREY

A table in back, please.

MAITRE D'

Certainly

JEFFREY

I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.

MAITRE D'

One Heineken, certainly, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

(out loud to himself)

I'll bet I know where you're going.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

(thinking out loud)

I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm

too curious. and I have to try to help her.

JEFFREY

Hi. can I come in?

DOROTHY

(looking around the hallway)

Yeah. hurry up though.

JEFFREY

Are you alright?

DOROTHY

No. I'm not.

DOROTHY

Why are you here. whatiya want?

JEFFREY

. I. uh.

DOROTHY

(still crying)

I looked for you in my closet tonight.

(a little laugh)

It's crazy, I don't know where you came

from but. I like you.

JEFFREY

That's not crazy. I like you too.

DOROTHY

I liked being with you last night.

JEFFREY

. same here.

DOROTHY

(she starts to stagger)

Oh shit.

JEFFREY

(frightened)

Frank? .can you stand up?

DOROTHY

I'm alright. go hide. This won't

take long. Be quiet.

YELLOW MAN

Frank gone?

DOROTHY

Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin'

back.

YELLOW MAN

Bull.

DOROTHY

Alright, suit yourself.

YELLOW MAN

He's comin' back?. What for?

DOROTHY

(shaking)

'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for.

Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

YELLOW MAN

(getting upset)

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you.

and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't

it. remember that. Your husband was the

one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

DOROTHY

Oh he forced you, huh?

YELLOW MAN

He's the reformed dealer though who wanted

to turn himself in. he's the one that caused

Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real

good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to

be here watching you why can't I be here

fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the

size of a pin - let me give you the real

thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

DOROTHY

(cool, but real mad)

No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank.

I'm gonna tell him what you said.

YELLOW MAN

Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.

JEFFREY

(talking softly)

Nice guy.  Who's he?

DOROTHY

Who's it, you mean.

DOROTHY

(continuing)

Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

JEFFREY

(quietly, soothing her)

There you go again. stop saying that.

You can make it.

DOROTHY

I can't. I can't. You think you know

so much.

JEFFREY

Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.

Why are you in so much trouble?

DOROTHY

(whispering)

I. don't. okay. Just don't. just be

with me.

(now very strangely)

Oh God. Come with me. Who are you.

Come up here.

DOROTHY

(as she stares down)

Look.

JEFFREY

(turning to her quickly)

No.

DOROTHY

(continuing to look down, her

eyes widening - she whispers)

JEFFREY

No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so

much trouble?

JEFFREY

(continuing)

Who is Don?

DOROTHY

(very crazy and angry)

Don?. Are you in with them?

JEFFREY

(whispering)

No. But you're in very big trouble.

DOROTHY

Why are you so interested? Why do you

keep asking me?

JEFFREY

I came back to help you. You said do I

let girls sneak into my house. You know

where I live. if you need to. come to

where I live. O.K.?

DOROTHY

Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like

me, huh?

JEFFREY

Yes.

DOROTHY

(whispering)

. or do you just want me? I'm going to let

you enter me now.

JEFFREY

No. I should go.

DOROTHY

Please. please stay.

JEFFREY

Why Dorothy?

DOROTHY

Don? I have to make it hurt. I want

there to be nothing again. Don!!!

(as she slams her head

again and again)

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

Will you tell Mom when she gets home from

the hospital that I've gone to dinner at

Sandy Williams' house?

AUNT BARBARA

Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey.

I think you've got termites in the house.

JEFFREY

Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?

AUNT BARBARA

I've seen a few.

JEFFREY

Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry

about it. Look. I better go.

AUNT BARBARA

Okay honey.

CUT TO:

SANDY

We thank you in the name of the Father, the

Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

MIKE

Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like

this, with your fingers just down here, that

thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(teasing him)

Yeah? Then how come nobody caught anything

last week?.

MIKE

(not laughing)

'Cause we had a bad day.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

You play any sports, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY

No.

MIKE

Looks like you'd make a good runner.

JEFFREY

Well.

MIKE

I mean, you don't exactly have the build

for a football. I mean. no offense.

JEFFREY

(not offended)

No. you're right.

MIKE

I mean. some guys play anyway but they

usually get slaughtered.

JEFFREY

Yeah, well I never wanted to get

slaughtered much.

MIKE

(not getting any humor)

Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the

point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

MRS. WILLIAMS

No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the

food, you know.

MIKE

Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta

take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like

a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in

perfect tune for perfect health. That's

what I'm interested in.

MIKE

Oh yeah. and a few other things.

SANDY

We've got some Heinekens.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Yeah. I like Bud myself.

SANDY

I'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?

MIKE

I guess another glass of water.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. WILLIAMS

(calling downstairs)

Who wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and

ice cream.

MIKE

None for me, thanks.

MIKE

(referring to T.V.)

What are watchin' this junk for?

SANDY

You can change it if you want to.

MIKE

I don't know why we have to watch T.V.

SANDY

Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come

on.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

JEFFREY

That sounds great!

MRS. WILLIAMS

Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a

minute.

MIKE

I'll be right back.

SANDY

Well, how did it go?. What happened?

JEFFREY

Well. I've found out some things.

nothing really for certain. There are some

strange people involved.

SANDY

What did you see?

JEFFREY

Well.

(looking around, feeling funny)

Maybe we should discuss this somewhere

else. you know what I mean?

MRS. WILLIAMS

Mike?. Are you alright?

MIKE

(mumbling)

Yes.

MIKE

Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

SANDY

(calling up)

Sure. just a sec.

(to Jeffrey)

Excuse me.

MIKE

Come on out a minute, okay?

SANDY

Okay.

MRS. WILLIAMS

Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll

get to the dishes.

JEFFREY

Sure thing. please don't worry about me.

Can I help you with the dishes?

MRS. WILLIAMS

Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly

not. just relax and enjoy your coffee.

I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Jeffrey?

JEFFREY

Yes?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

If you want to come up a minute, I'll show

you some pictures.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(continuing)

Take a look at these. These are the photos

of the vacant lot where you found the ear.

You might find them interesting.

JEFFREY

These are beautiful. How's the case

coming?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Okay.

JEFFREY

Anything you can tell me?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

The criminals are winning.

JEFFREY

Is that why you say it's horrible?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Yes.

JEFFREY

I guess you've seen some bad things.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison

your mind by telling you.

JEFFREY

Why do you do it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

I won't let the bastards get me up against

the wall. It's an act of defiance.

JEFFREY

Yeah. I get it.

JEFFREY

What is this? What color is it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(leaning over to see)

Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

SANDY

Can I use the car for a while?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Sure. What's up?

SANDY

I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.

JEFFREY

A Dairy Queen?

(he holds his stomach)

Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

What's with Mike?

SANDY

He got a little jealous.

JEFFREY

I'm sorry, I didn't.

SANDY

It's okay. Don't worry about it.

SANDY

You want a Dairy Queen?

JEFFREY

No way. I'm about to blow up.

SANDY

You want to tell me about it?

JEFFREY

. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.

this is what I have found out. What I

think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens

is married to a man named Don. they have

a son. I think the son and the husband

have been kidnapped by a man named

Frank who has now cut off both of Don's

ears. I think he is holding them to make

her do things for him. I think she wants

to die. the ears were for her a warning

to stay alive. there is another man

involved. I call him the "yellow man".

you saw his back the other day in the hall

at her door. I don't know what he does but

I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank.

Frank is a very dangerous man.

SANDY

(quietly)

Wow. Should you tell my father?

JEFFREY

I don't see how I can. and I can't prove

any of this. I got all this information

illegally. also it could get you in

trouble.

SANDY

You saw a lot in one night.

JEFFREY

. Actually. I've been in twice.

SANDY

(uneasy)

Twice. without her sensing anything?

JEFFREY

(lying)

Yes.

SANDY

(pausing)

Did you see her undressed?

JEFFREY

Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

SANDY

Yeah?

JEFFREY

(a searching, slight smile)

That doesn't bother you, does it?

SANDY

Who, me? Why should it?

JEFFREY

(seeing some jealousy and

and happy for it)

That's what I thought.

SANDY

You're sure right. It is a strange world.

JEFFREY

Why are there people like Frank. Why is

there so much trouble in this world.?

SANDY

I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the

night I met you.

(she reflects silently on

this before proceeding)

. in the dream the world was dark because

there weren't any robins. you know, birds.

robins stood for love. and all of a sudden

thousands of robins flew down and brought

this blinding light of love. and it felt

like that love would be the only thing that

would make any difference. I guess. until

the robins come there is trouble.

JEFFREY

Yeah I guess so.

(he turns to her)

You're a neat girl.

SANDY

So are you.

(laughs)

I mean you're a neat guy. We better

get back.

JEFFREY

I guess so. you want to help me watch

Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's

place tomorrow. with a camera.

SANDY

No, silly - I'm still in school you know.

but I'll meet you after school and you

can tell me what you've learned. You better

be careful, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

I will.  I'll pick you up on the same

corner at three thirty-five, okay?

SANDY

Okay. be careful.

JEFFREY

Okay, Sandy.

JEFFREY

Can I give you a kiss good night?

SANDY

(pauses, trembling)

You better not, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

Okay. okay.

SANDY

Goodnight.

JEFFREY

See ya tomorrow.

JEFFREY

Hello?

FRANK (telephone V.O.)

Speak to me Fucker.

JEFFREY

(to himself)

Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in

even more trouble with Frank. I hope not.

I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out

more about Frank.

Damn!

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

Wow.

DISSOLVE TO:

JEFFREY

(out loud to himself)

Fifteen more minutes.

JEFFREY

You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.

JEFFREY

What happened?

GUY #1

He was blown away man. can't you see?

GUY #2

That cracker was the biggest dealer in

this section of the city, brother. the

police are going to find more drugs in

there than you can believe. It's a

speedball heaven in there.

JEFFREY

Oh yeah? What about the woman?

GUY #1

Probably just a whore he happened to be

with at the time.

JEFFREY

Man oh brother.

GUY #1

This is the way the world is my man. take

a good look.

CUT TO:

SANDY

(looking beyond the car)

GO ON!!!. GO!

SANDY

Oh great.

SANDY

(continuing)

You were late.

JEFFREY

I'm really sorry.

SANDY

What am I going to do?

JEFFREY

You want to go talk to him?

SANDY

Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do

much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to

him later.

CUT TO:

SANDY

You know, that cheese is practically

all chemicals.

JEFFREY

That's what makes it so good. You wanta

hear what I saw today?

SANDY

Shoot.

JEFFREY

Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into

Frank's building, laughing with Frank.

Now. the only trouble is. what does this

prove?

SANDY

(thinking)

Nothing really, but it's interesting.

they know each other. they seem to like

each other.

JEFFREY

Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on

drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

SANDY

Oh yeah?

JEFFREY

Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.

This time with a well-dressed man with an

alligator briefcase. They drove down this

factory building and stood on a staircase

looking at something in the distance.

Number three. now get this. In the distance

was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death

and a woman with her legs broken.

SANDY

Jeffrey!!

JEFFREY

Then these guys told me the police will

find a huge amount of drugs inside the

dead man's place.

SANDY

I can't believe what you are finding out.

Are you going to continue with this. Are

you going back to her apartment?

JEFFREY

Yeah.

SANDY

Jeffrey?. Why?

JEFFREY

I'm seeing something that was always hidden.

I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.

and it's all secret.

SANDY

You like mysteries that much?

JEFFREY

Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you.

very much.

SANDY

Oh yeah?

SANDY

Don't. please, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

You worry about me really?

SANDY

Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I

worry. a lot. I got you into this.

CUT TO:

DOROTHY

JEFFREY

(very nervous)

DOROTHY

JEFFREY

DOROTHY

(she poses)

JEFFREY

DOROTHY

DOROTHY

JEFFREY

I want to help you. I think I know some of

what is happening to you.

(she doesn't react)

. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son.

Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do

something Dorothy. go to the police.

DOROTHY

No police!!!.

(pushing herself back against

the headboard; then frantic)

No police!!

DOROTHY

You like to open me. don't you?

JEFFREY

Yes.

DOROTHY

(thinking with a grin)

What if I told Frank that you opened me?

JEFFREY

That wouldn't be too good, would it?

DOROTHY

Frank would open you.

JEFFREY

Okay. I know you've been scared. now you

want to scare someone.

DOROTHY

(smiles very strangely)

Does that scare you?

JEFFREY

JEFFREY

You. what?

DOROTHY

You put your disease in me. your semen.

JEFFREY

There's no disease, I can tell you.

DOROTHY

Men are crazy. then they put their

craziness into me. then it makes me

crazy. then they aren't so crazy for

awhile. then they put their craziness

in me again.

(starts crying)

. it's burning me. but I love you. I

do, I do. Did you know that? Did you

know that I love you?

JEFFREY

(very apprehensive)

DOROTHY

There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in

so much darkness though with things moving.

Beaumont. fine and you? Good. Is Sandy

CUT TO:

JEFFREY

could help your father but you

might get into trouble.

SANDY

Jeffrey. are they important things?

Well forget me - you have to tell

him. Jeffrey. I mean it.

JEFFREY

Ok but I promise I won't mention you.

Okay? .I'll see him at the police

Excuse me.

DETECTIVES

J.R. WILLIAMS

AND

T.R. GORDON

JEFFREY

(inner voice)

Gordon. Gordon. a police inspector.

wait a minute. wait a minute.

JEFFREY

(continuing, inner voice)

The police. the police. Gordon.

JEFFREY

(continuing, inner voice)

Took all those drugs away. Gordon

took those drugs away.

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Jeffrey! Come on in.

JEFFREY

Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you,

but I've got to talk to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a

bad face lift.

JEFFREY

(with a goofy smile to Sandy)

Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Okay?

JEFFREY

Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered

some things. .Anyway I have to show you

some pictures and tell you some things

about them. The first picture is this.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

This is Frank Booth. His address is on

the back of the photo. He, in my opinion,

is very sick and dangerous. This photo

here is of Frank with another man as they

went into Frank's apartment.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

And that man came out with a third man -

this well-dressed guy. here's the photo.

I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is

in trouble with these people. I think

Frank has taken her husband and her son.

JEFFREY

(continuing)

I have no hard proof of any of this. Her

address is also on the photos. I think

these people are involved with drugs. and

murder. I think Frank is killing drug

dealers and.

(he decides not to tell Detective

Williams everything)

. and somehow Frank is getting all their

drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly

more involved in this than you wanted me

to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to

tell you about these things in case it

could help.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get

so involved?

JEFFREY

I can't tell you the whole story. I. I

took it upon myself. I can't say more.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Is Sandy part of this?

JEFFREY

No. not at all.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(referring to the photos)

Who knows you have these?

JEFFREY

Only you. and the photo lab.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

You're all through with this now?

JEFFREY

Yes sir. I sure am.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

For now. Alright. you better be. And

Sandy better not be involved with this,

I can tell you. Be prepared to come in

for further interrogation on this later.

JEFFREY

Yes sir.

SANDY

Everything okay?

JEFFREY

Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him

some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

SANDY

You didn't tell him about me?

JEFFREY

No.

SANDY

POLICEMAN #1

hear him because he's almost dead)

I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you

all on their own. find all this horror

on their own.

(whispers)

Good bye.

JEFFREY

So. Frank escaped.

JEFFREY

radio!. So did Frank though and he's no

cop. that's for sure. and he's driving

Frank's car. who is he?

JEFFREY

What happened that day?.

JEFFREY (V.O.)

They went in together.

JEFFREY

JEFFREY

(into the radio)

Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(over radio)

Detective Williams here. Is that you,

Jeffrey?

JEFFREY

Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up

to Dorothy's apartment.

(thinks; hits himself in the

forehead; inner voice)

Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing

everything we say!!

(thinks some more - fast)

Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the

apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back

bedroom.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

We're ten minutes away and moving as fast

as we can.

FRANK

(calling pleasantly in the direction

of the back bedroom)

Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot

I have a police radio. I know where your

cute little butt is hiding. Here I come!

Ready or not!

FRANK

Hey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey

you stupid fuck. you got about a

second to live.

FRANK (V.O.)

(helium voice)

Hey pretty pretty.

FRANK (V.O.)

Hey fuck, where are you?

SANDY (V.O.)

Jeffrey!!

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

(to Jeffrey)

Because of your information I alerted

internal affairs to check out Detective

Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as

if nothing was different.  He slipped

off on his own when he found out we were

going to raid Frank's place.

JEFFREY

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

Not yet.

JEFFREY

Oh my God. Is her son OK?

F.B.I. MAN

We're looking for him. In your opinion,

why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and

husband?

JEFFREY

He became obsessed with her. She hated

him. He had to have her. He kidnapped

them to control her. to make her do

things. Then she wanted to commit

suicide so he started cutting off ears

as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm

not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue

velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause

her whole life was blue.

F.B.I. MAN

You seemed to see some very interesting

things on your little escapade with

Dorothy Vallens.

JEFFREY

Yeah. I guess I did.

(He turns to Sandy

with a worried look)

What's going to happen to me?

F.B.I. MAN

We're going to leave that up to Detective

Williams. I'll tell you though. you're

okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

JEFFREY

Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how

many more are out there?

SANDY

Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.

JEFFREY

Okay. I'll be right in.

JEFFREY

How ya doin' Dad?

MR. BEAUMONT

(distant voice)

Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

JEFFREY

Good deal Dad.

SANDY

(Referring to the bird)

Look Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

(As he joins Aunt Barbara and

Sandy to look at the robin)

Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe

the robins are here.

AUNT BARBARA

I don't see how they do it. I could

never eat a bug.

JEFFREY AND SANDY

It's a strange world, isn't it?
