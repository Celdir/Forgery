"Ronin", early, by J.D. Zeik

RONIN

an original screenplay by

J.D. Zeik

DRAFT: May 20, 1997

KILLER

God loves me.

KILLER

(to his victim)

But I don't think he's too fond of you...

UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)

What is this?

UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)

This is not football...

UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)

(continuing)

...Football is three hundred pound guys,

they run way too fucking fast, they got

helmets made of kevlar they use to spear

the quarterback into the next life.

LARRY

(talking to the air)

You wanna know what football is?  It's

hitting the other guy dirty and then

spitting in his face when he's down.

Football is all things American, and

American is A-Number-One the absolute

fucking best there is.  That's what

football is...

(he points to the TV)

...And that's not football.

VINCENT

(to Larry in perfect English)

Football -- American football -- is a

game for faggots.

A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

(a touch Irish accent)

Yes?

DEIRDRE

Can I help you?

SAM

No...

DEIRDRE

I'm here...

(a beat, responding to a

question)

No, it was nothing.

SAM

Sorry I'm late...

VINCENT

(a challenge)

What makes you think we're here to meet

you?

SAM

(meeting Vincent's gaze)

Who else would you be?

VINCENT

Perhaps the police?

SAM

I know cops -- and you're no cop.

VINCENT

Cigarette?

SAM

No thanks.

SAM

He trusts you to lock up?

VINCENT

Let's just say he knows who I am.

LARRY

Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting

for?

VINCENT

(lighting his cigarette)

The question isn't what we're waiting

for... it's who.

LARRY

And who the fuck is that?

GREGOR

Whoever hired us.

SAM

I got this gig through a contractor.

And he most definitely didn't know who

was doing the hiring, only that they

were paying a lot of money...

SAM

(continuing his thought)

So none of us knows who's paying the

freight, this is just some anonymous job.

For all we know, we're working for

different people.

GREGOR

Now that is an interesting proposition.

SWEDE

How so?

GREGOR

Because if there's more than one party

involved, if we really are working for

different people, then perhaps some of us

are on different sides.

(with great meaning)

Your orders might be different from mine.

LARRY

What're you talking about, man?  I don't

understand.

SWEDE

(quietly, but loud enough to be

heard)

What a surprise...

LARRY

I got a surprise for you, blondie...

GREGOR

(sharply, as if he's used to

giving orders)

Why don't both of you shut up?

LARRY & SWEDE

(to Gregor at the same time)

Fuck you!

SAM

Knock it off!

SAM

The point remains: we could be working

for different people.  There's a chance

for one of us...

(looks around the table)

Maybe more than one of us -- has been

paid to cross the others.  I don't know

about you guys, but I like to know who

I'm working for.  It can help prevent a

great deal of...

(finding the right word)

...unpleasantness.

LARRY

(patting the gun inside his

cheap suit)

Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put

two between his eyes -- one to do the job

and the other to make sure it takes.

DEIRDRE

It's good to see you've all got such

faith in our little undertaking.

LARRY

Who the fuck are you?

DEIRDRE

(staring at Larry)

The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this

show.

GREGOR

Who are you?  IRA?

DEIRDRE

(with a brittle laugh)

Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but

there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and

I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my

meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the

rest of you, and that's all any of us

needs to know about the other.

DEIRDRE

From here on in you want something you

pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank

accounts are in place: ten percent up

front, the rest when the job is done.

(a quick beat, then she looks

at Gregor)

You.  What do you do and what should we

call you?

GREGOR

These days they they call me Gregor -- and

I'm a tech.  I do electronic work,

surveillance, computer runs.

SAM

Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.

DEIRDRE

You were a soldier, were you?

SAM

Once.

LARRY

I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry

from the States.

DEIRDRE

(she turns to Vincent)

And who are you?

VINCENT

I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.

SAM

(sharply)

Coordinate what?

VINCENT

Things.  This is my country, you know.

DEIRDRE

(to Vincent)

Coordinate all you want, but make sure

whatever you do gets cleared through me.

(Vincent doesn't respond for a

moment)

Are we in sync on this, Vincent?

VINCENT

Of course.

SWEDE

They call me Swede.

LARRY

Who's they?

SWEDE

Everybody.

VINCENT

And what is it you do?

SWEDE

Me?

(with a smile)

I kill.

SAM

(looking at the target)

You shoot alright.

LARRY

Gets the job done.

SAM

All in the stomach, though.  Your man

might live.

LARRY

Not for long.

SAM

Long enough to shoot back.

LARRY

Is that right?

SAM

It's been known to happen.

LARRY

(a challenge)

Why don't you go do better, then...

LARRY

Yeah, well...  My way works too.

SAM

My way is better.

DEIRDRE (O.S.)

Is it alright?

GREGOR

It's quite satifactory.

DEIRDRE

Good, because it cost enough.  There's

cheaper phones by far than that one, man:

you better fucking use it.

GREGOR

(almost caressing the phone)

I intend to.  This phone is wired like no

other: it's got an encryption chip and

instant sat-a-link recognition, it can

talk to any computer in any language and

make it understand.  With my custom

hardware and this phone I can trace the

target's cell phone signature and follow

him anywhere he goes...

DEIRDRE

You sure about this?

GREGOR

I'd stake my reputation.

DEIRDRE

But would you stake your life, that's the

question...

GREGOR

In this business, your life and your

reputation are more often than not one

and the same.

SWEDE

You should watch what you eat.

LARRY

Who the fuck died and appointed you food

czar?

SWEDE

I'm just worried about your health,

Larry.  You could stand to shed a few

pounds.

LARRY

(sensitive about his weight)

And you could stand to get a little

smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde

fuck?

SWEDE

(sensitive about the dumb

blonde thing)

Who you calling dumb, dickless?

DEIRDRE

(standing above them)

Next one of you fuckers plays this game

I'm going to do for you myself.  I won't

say it again: we don't have time for this

shit!  There's a clock running on this

job, gentlemen, and I mean to be on

schedule.

VINCENT

Let's go for a ride.

SAM

Where to?

VINCENT

To see a man about a thing.

SAM

I can do that.

LEADER

(subtitled French)

Who gave you permission to park here?

SAM

(to Vincent)

What's he saying?

VINCENT

Pretty much what you'd expect.

SAM

(with a sigh)

That's what I thought.

LEADER

(in French)

There's a charge for parking on our

block.

VINCENT

(to Sam)

He says this is their block.

SAM

As in, they own it?

VINCENT

Something like that...

SAM

And I suppose he's saying that we oughta

give them something for using it, huh?

VINCENT

I didn't know that you spoke French.

SAM

I don't.  But the language he's speaking

is universal.

SAM (O.S.)

I guess we oughta give them something...

VINCENT

If you think we should.

SAM

(as if it were an accident)

Oh man, I am sorry about that...

(he sticks his hand out)

Let me give you a hand.

SAM

What'd you say to him?

VINCENT

I asked if we could give him anything

else.

VINCENT

That was a nice move you did on our young

friend.  Judo?

SAM

Jujitsu.

VINCENT

Same thing, isn't it?

SAM

Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

VINCENT

What's the difference?

SAM

One's a lot more painful than the other.

SAM (V.O.)

Could I get one of those?

VINCENT

Help yourself.

(quick beat)

Since when do you smoke?

SAM

(lighting up)

I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a

week.

VINCENT

A cigarette?  As in one?

(exasperated, almost to

himself)

One cigarette a week, who smokes like

that?

SAM

I do.

VINCENT

Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day,

and I tell myself I could be worse.

(takes a satisfying drag)

It's just so damned pleasurable.

SAM

(blowing a smoke ring with

great skill)

It has it's moments.

(stubs out cigarette)

Course, you get cancer and die, that's

the down side.

VINCENT

(with a sigh)

There is that.

SAM

So, Vincent: why bring me along for the

ride?  Job like this calls for a warm

body, somebody who can stand around and

look threatening.  A tough guy.

VINCENT

Like Larry or Swede.

SAM

Exactly.  Why not bring them?

VINCENT

Let's just say I thought the

conversational possibilities were

limited.  Of course, I might have brought

Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right

candidate -- for this.

SAM

Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for

sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's

smart, Gregor is.

VINCENT

So is the woman.

SAM

Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously

goddamned dangerous.

VINCENT

I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

SAM

I've wondered that myself.  None of this

answers my question, though...

(suddenly direct)

Why bring me?

VINCENT

I wanted to see who you were.

SAM

Who am I?

VINCENT

You were once some kind of special

forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy

SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for

the CIA in some place like El Salvador or

Afghanistan, a real mercenary.

(beat)

Only now -- now you're like the rest of

us, it's a very competitive market since

the end of the cold war.  There's a lot

of hired guns out here, and not nearly

enough work to go around.

SAM

That's right: there's not hardly enough

work these days, nothing that pays the

big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this

job, paying so much goddamned money I

couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's

paying through the nose for this.

VINCENT

They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're

going to steal, it must be quite

something.

SAM

Whatever it is it must be goddamned

priceless.

VINCENT

Lovely, isn't it?

SAM

They'd have to keep something like this

under lock and key in New York, and it

would still get fucked up.

FRANCOIS

That's good right where you are, Vincent.

VINCENT

Do you have it?

FRANCOIS

Not so fast.

(nods slightly to Sam)

Who's that?

VINCENT

He's company.

FRANCOIS

(as if he recognizes Sam)

Bad company...

VINCENT

What do you mean?

FRANCOIS

He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's

a cop and you better shoot him in the

fucking head right now!

SAM

(to Vincent)

What's going on?

VINCENT

I just wanted to see something.

SAM

(that edge creeping into his

voice)

See what?

FRANCOIS

He wanted to see how you reacted when I

said that you were a cop.

SAM

(he can't believe this)

You told him I was a cop?

FRANCOIS

He asked me to say it.

SAM

(looking at Vincent, truly

pissed)

He asked you to?

VINCENT

I needed to know.

SAM

You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

FRANCOIS

(to Vincent, in subtitled

French)

Are you ready?

VINCENT

(taking out an envelope)

Here's yours.

FRANCOIS

There's been a slight problem.

VINCENT

(immediately tensing)

What's that?

FRANCOIS

(still in subtitled French)

If you say a word in English, Vincent, my

friend with the high powered sporting

rifle will shoot you in the throat.

Sorry to screw you over like this, but

the information you want might get me

killed if I give it to you, and that's a

price I'm not willing to pay.

VINCENT

(in French)

I take it you still want the money...

FRANCOIS

(in English, with a grin)

Of course.

VINCENT

Where's my information?

FRANCOIS

(with a grim smile, pointing to

his head)

In here...

VINCENT

Then you better find it in your heart to

tell me, Francois, because while your

death is inevitable, it still isn't

decided how painful it's going to be.

SAM

Now would be a good time to get the fuck

out of here.

SAM

You know, what you pulled back there,

that was bullshit.

VINCENT

I needed to see if you were a cop.

(defensively)

I'm a popular man with the police, Sam,

and whenever they try to catch me they

always do it with an inside guy -- some

man on some job who seems more

trustworthy than all the others put

together.  And that's the guy you have to

watch out for.

(beat)

I hate cops...

SAM

(insulted that Vincent would

even consider it)

Well I ain't a cop.

VINCENT

How did you know?

SAM

Know what?

VINCENT

That there was a gun pointed at me.

SAM

I saw you look off when Francois nodded

his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing

out a particularly rare shrub, and the

rest was easy.

VINCENT

But how did you know I would have the

presence of mind to pull my weapon

when I did?

SAM

(as if it's obvious)

Because that's what I would have done...

VINCENT

You saved my life back there in the park.

I know this doesn't begin to make it

right between us...

SAM

What I did back in the park I did because

we're working together -- we're on the

same team.

(holding up the money)

This is business -- this is work.  We did

it together, we share the spoils, even

split.

VINCENT

I owe you a heavy debt.

SAM

Whatever you say.

DEIRDRE (V.O.)

What'd you do with the money?

VINCENT

We kept it...

DEIRDRE

(a little annoyed)

Is that right?

SAM

Hazard pay...

DEIRDRE

(with an exhalation of disgust)

The two of you were supposed to go to a

simple meet and come back with a simple

piece of information, and instead you

went to fucking war...

SAM

We weren't real thrilled about it

either...

LARRY

So what's the deal?

DEIRDRE

(barely stopping, very

snappish)

The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice

at first light.

LARRY

What'd you guys do?

DEIRDRE

I feel as if I've wandered onto the set

of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me

to do that?

SAM

I didn't think to see you again tonight.

You were pretty pissed.

DEIRDRE

I still am.

SAM

Is that right?

DEIRDRE

That's right.

SAM

Part of me says I should just look at

this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But

then I remember you're you -- Deirdre

who used to belong to the IRA -- and it

occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge

come very naturally to you.

DEIRDRE

(kissing him very lightly)

Nobody's saying they don't.

SAM

(returning the kiss, just as

lightly)

And when I consider that, I have to

wonder if you don't have some ulterior

motive for being here, with me, right

now.

DEIRDRE

I probably do.

(pulling him close)

But for the time being, I'm willing to

forget about it...

GREGOR

I would imagine that the great

satisfaction in all of this will be

killing the American.

SWEDE

(we know this isn't true)

I hadn't thought about it.  Understand

me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in

killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit,

but I don't get off on it.

GREGOR

A means to an end, is that it?

SWEDE

That's it.

GREGOR

(he rises to leave)

Then I guess we're set.

SWEDE

There is one other thing...

GREGOR

What's that?

GREGOR

What are you doing?

SWEDE

Don't cross me...

GREGOR

Nobody's going to do that!

SWEDE

Really?

GREGOR

(truly frightened)

I need you, Swede, I can't do this

without you!

SWEDE

(beat, then he puts his gun

away)

I just wanted to make sure you knew who

you were dealing with.

GREGOR

I do, I do...

SWEDE

(this is almost to himself)

Just remember it, then.

SAM (O.S.)

No goodbye?

DEIRDRE

Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way

when I tell you we won't be doing this

again.

SAM

You don't have to explain yourself to me,

Deirdre.

DEIRDRE

(almost surprised by this)

I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just

that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -

(almost with a sneer)

Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with

any man it was deemed necessary for me to

sleep with.  You know: any man who needed

setting up.  Sometimes so we might

blackmail him, sometimes so he could be

killed.

(a quick beat)

Sometimes so I could kill him myself.

IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist

organization, Sam.  To most of the men I

with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl

to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of

it."  "Have the girl fuck him."

(a quick beat)

But I look at you and I get this feeling

you take me for what I am: no more, no

less.

SAM

You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like

me.

DEIRDRE

Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be

with someone who was just like me.

DEIRDRE

I better be getting that.

SAM

Duty calls?

DEIRDRE

(with a trace of a sigh)

Just business.

DEIRDRE

Now then, let's run through it one more

time, shall we?

(to Gregor)

What's your job?

GREGOR

I use my cell phone to get computer

access to the telecommunications

satellite used by our target.  I trace

his cell phone signature and use it to

pin point his location as he moves

through Nice, relaying that information

to you.

DEIRDRE

(to Larry)

Next.

LARRY

(a sigh, he's done this too

many times)

You call me with the target's route, I

follow along until we've reached the

attack point and then I run his squag ass

off the road.

DEIRDRE

(to Swede)

Which leads us to...

SWEDE

I ride with fat-boy...

LARRY

(under his breath)

Eat shit and die slowly...

SWEDE

After we stop the target car I get out

and use the heavy artillery to kill the

driver and his bodyguard.

LARRY

I blast the lead car into oblivion...

VINCENT

(picking up)

While Sam and I take out the back two

cars...

DEIRDRE

Leaving...

SWEDE

(picking it up)

...Leaving me to step in, drop the target

in the back seat, and get the package...

DEIRDRE

(with a quick look at Sam)

While...

SAM

(returning her look)

...While I back him up, making sure to

get the package if something goes wrong

and somebody takes Swede down.

SWEDE

Nobody's taking me anywhere...

DEIRDRE

And then...

LARRY

Then Swede and I split with the package

and meet you back at the rendezvous.

DEIRDRE

And then...

VINCENT

And then Sam, you and I clean up

whatever's left to be cleaned.

DEIRDRE

Very good.  Now all we have to do is live

long enough to get paid.

DEIRDRE

Alright, Gregor, I'm...

GREGOR

(finishing her sentence)

Ready when you are...

LARRY

Where is this broad?

SWEDE

You should learn a little patience.

LARRY

Is that right?

SWEDE

It's consider a virtue in some corners

of the world.

LARRY

Not in mine.

DEIRDRE (V.O.)

Hello gentlemen, are we ready?

DEIRDRE

You want to take a left, then, so that

you're going west.

THE TARGET

Fuck you!

SWEDE

Not today.

SWEDE

I don't particularly like killing, tubby,

but I want you to know that this one I'm

going to enjoy.

LARRY

(sees something over Swede's

shoulder)

I don't think so.

LARRY

(in shock)

He just...I don't believe that son-of-

a...

LARRY

(still having trouble believing

it)

We've been crossed...

LARRY (V.O.)

What is this?

SAM

(answering Larry's question)

It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut

with a little crank because we might need

you awake in the real near future.

LARRY

Fine with fucking me, we got work to do.

I don't care what it takes, we are

getting our property back and putting it

into the hands of the people who are

gonna pay us a great deal of money when

we do.  I don't know about the rest of you

guys, but I'm not the kind of guy

to just sit back and take it in the ass.

(a quick beat)

I don't mean that in, like, a literal

way...

DEIRDRE

Of course.

VINCENT

Finding this package is a thing easier

said than done.  We don't even know what

it is.

(he looks at Deirdre, and

suddenly he's deadly earnest)

What did we steal?

DEIRDRE

(suddenly defensive)

I don't know.

VINCENT

When this whole thing started you made it

clear: you're running the show.  And I

don't believe you'd be running this show

if you didn't know what was going on.

DEIRDRE

Well I don't!

VINCENT

And I don't believe you...

DEIRDRE

(suddenly feral)

You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but

you'll be dead before I hit the ground.

VINCENT

(matching her intensity)

I don't want you dead, woman, I want the

the truth!

SAM (O.S.)

(with a dead cool in his voice)

Both of you...

SAM

(continuing without missing a

beat)

...put your guns down and chill out.

SAM

Like it or now, we're on the same side:

we're here and the package isn't.

(looks at Deirdre)

You're not the boss any more, you're our

partner.  So tell us what you know, so we

can figure a way out of this mess.

SAM

Now, what did we steal?

DEIRDRE

(she hates to admit this)

I don't know...

(defensively, off Vincent's

look)

Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery

to me just like it is to you.

(quick beat, then reluctantly

continuing)

But I do know who we're working for.  My

people, and the Russian mob.

LARRY

Your people?  Who the fuck is your

people?

VINCENT

Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA.

DEIRDRE

And you believed me?

(passionately)

But it wasn't my people who did it.

LARRY

How do we know that?

SAM

Because if they had she'd be gone along

with the package, instead of sitting here

with us.

DEIRDRE

Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's

man.  It was my people came up with the

idea for this run, but the Russians who

had the capital to finance it.  Gregor,

he was their insurance, and I was ours.

Everybody else was supposed to be

neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

LARRY

I never did trust that blonde fuck...

DEIRDRE

That's why you were riding with him.

VINCENT

The question still remains: what do we do

now?

SAM

(he figures something out)

Gregor's cell phone...

LARRY

(to himself)

What are you gonna do, call him up and

ask him to give us back our shit?

SAM

(ignoring Larry, to Deirdre)

Did he bring that with him?

DEIRDRE

I bought it for him -- all the stuff he

was using, it was in his contract.  Cost

a nice penny, too, especially that

goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive

tastes.

SAM

Check this out.

(he's thinking on his feet)

Gregor's a spook, or he was one until

recently.  When he was a spy he lived the

life -- you know, a prince in some

Eastern Bloc country where nobody had

shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the

wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And

Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no

special stores with Western food and

video tapes.  I would bet dollars against

shit that Gregor liked that phone and he

doesn't want to give it up.  And I

wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant

enough to think...

DEIRDRE

(finishing his sentence)

That we're too stupid to trace his calls.

GREGOR

(breaking the silence)

It's a beautiful street, no?

DAPPER GENT

(he can't wait any longer)

Do you have it?

GREGOR

Always in a rush, you are.  All these

years I've known you, you could never

wait for anything.

DAPPER GENT

This is important.

GREGOR

Do you really think so?

DAPPER GENT

You know it is.

GREGOR

Relax!

GREGOR

Look over there.

GREGOR (O.S.)

Do you see that one?  The girl in the

light blue dress?

DAPPER GENT

What are you doing, have you lost your

mind?!?

DAPPER GENT

Why did you do that?

GREGOR

To make a point.  I don't know her, and I

was ready to splatter her brains all over

the sidewalk.

(giving the Gent a look)

I don't particularly like you, so imagine

what I'll do if you try anything...

DAPPER GENT

(squirming)

Enough!  We've been driving for an hour,

where is my package?

GREGOR

It's under your seat.

DAPPER GENT

(incredulous)

What?

GREGOR

As my American friend Larry would say:

are you fucking deaf?  It's under your

seat.

DAPPER GENT

I can't believe you'd do that, Gregor.  I

thought I trained you better than that.

DAPPER GENT

I've never particularly liked you either,

Gregor.

PHONE VOICE (V.O.)

(in Russian, English subtitles)

Is it done?

GREGOR

(in English)

It's done.

PHONE VOICE (V.O.)

Gregor, is that you?

GREGOR

(with a low chuckle)

Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

PHONE VOICE (V.O.)

It was a mistake, it shouldn't have

happened.

GREGOR

(suddenly cold, furious)

I'm in the middle of saving you people a

great deal of money -- the least you

could do is have the decency to pay me!

PHONE VOICE (V.O.)

So what do we do?

GREGOR

What I do is none of your concern.  What

you should do is wait for my next phone

call.  I'm going to find a place where I

can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm

ready, I'll call you and tell you what I

want you to do.

SAM

What's going on?

VINCENT

You weren't around when I woke up, I

thought maybe something had happened.

(off Sam's look)

This has been one very fucked up job,

Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances

on anybody...

(a quick beat)

Including you...

SAM

I came up here to sneak a smoke.

VINCENT

You were smoking?

SAM

I hope you don't mind I took your pack.

It was on the table.

VINCENT

(very sincere, offering the

pack)

Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many

you'd like.

SAM

(a shrug of the shoulders)

I borrowed that, too...

VINCENT

(puffing contentedly)

Of course...whenever you feel like it

just help yourself.

SAM

I have a feeling I'm about to start

buying my own.

VINCENT (O.S.)

That was a bad bit of business, today.

SAM

It was at that.

VINCENT

A lot of people died.

SAM

I've seen a lot of people die before.

VINCENT

I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you

get used to it?

SAM

You don't.  You just learn to live with

it.

VINCENT

I won't lie -- there have been times when

I had to do it, times when the only way

to get out alive was to see that the

other man didn't.

SAM

We live in a singular world, my friend.

VINCENT

I never really thought I was part of the

world you move in, Sam, to tell you the

truth.

(off his look)

I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small

time king of way.  To the local police

I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a

legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just

another two bit hired gun.

SAM

You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I

got a feeling you cost more than two

bits.

DEIRDRE

Christ, I was starting to think that the

two of you had thrown it in and walked

away.

(to Vincent)

There's someone on the phone downstairs

asking for you, and my somewhat limited

French leads me to believe that he might

have something to tell us about Gregor.

LARRY (V.O.)

I'm telling you...

LARRY

(continuing)

That I could be dead and I'd drive better

than you.

DEIRDRE

(very curt)

Oh shut up...

VINCENT

He's going north.

(circles something on map)

That's Aix en Provence, where he used the

phone.

SAM

(making up his mind)

He's going back.

VINCENT

Not necessarily.  He could go off road at

any number of places.  He might not even

be in the country anymore.

SAM

It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for

anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he

doesn't waste time on this road unless he

has to be on it in the first place.

Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by

now.  He's going to Paris.

(beat)

Now I just hope we can find him before he

gets there.

DEIRDRE

If somebody else doesn't find him first.

DAD

Opera?  This is an opera festival?

MOM

I told you that, Henry.

DAD

I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.

You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that

kind of thing.

LARRY

(mouth full)

This...this is incredible. Is the rest

of Europe like this?

DEIRDRE

(with a laugh)

Some places, not all.  Italy, for

instance, they're serious about their

food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere

in the U.K., you don't get much fancier

than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not

our thing, you see.

LARRY

What is?

DEIRDRE

(everybody knows this)

Best beer in the world known to man or

God.

LARRY

(with a snort)

Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for

me, thanks.

DEIRDRE

(with unconcealed scorn)

Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and

you've the unbridled gall to mention

Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's

not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor

excuse for rabbit piss.

LARRY

Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?

DEIRDRE

I drink what every civilized man, woman

and child in the world drinks: Guinness.

VINCENT (O.S.)

I hate to interrupt a conversation of

such cultural depth...

VINCENT

...but we've got to get back on the road.

VINCENT

We've got him.

LARRY

I'm driving.

VINCENT

I know those men.

SAM

Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when

your partners come back out, you make

sure you're here with the motor running.

GREGOR (V.O.)

Thank you, gentleman, that will do

nicely.

GREGOR

Edvard, is that you?

EDVARD

Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

GREGOR

I'm touched, really, that they'd send

someone of your caliber.  It's nice to

know that they didn't make the mistake of

underestimating me twice.

EDVARD

That was a mistake, trying to kill you.

Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd

have never allowed it.

GREGOR

I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's

too late for trust: we have a serious

problem.

EDVARD

We'll double your price.

GREGOR

(now that's interesting)

Really?  Do you have the money with you?

EDVARD

Do you have the material?

GREGOR

You first, Edvard.

EDVARD

Perhaps we could both go at the same

time...

GREGOR

(a short laugh)

I think not.

(with a flourish)

After you...

SAM (O.S.)

After you, asshole.

SAM

You might have been one mean technical

spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have

lasted a week in the field.

EDVARD

Gregor, are you alright?

DEIRDRE (O.S.)

Gregor's fine...

DEIDRE

(continuing)

...but I think you're in a bit of

trouble.

VINCENT (O.S.)

Don't even think it.

SAM

Don't talk to me unless you tell me what

I want to hear, understand?!?  You have

no choice in this, don't think about

winning, think about staying alive.  I

want the item, and if you don't give it

to me, I'm gonna kill you.

GREGOR

(a panicky hiss)

I don't have it with me...

SAM

Bullshit!

GREGOR

I swear...

SAM

Then where is it?

GREGOR

I sent it to myself in Paris.

SAM

Sent it where?

GREGOR

A post office box.

EDVARD

(stunned, announcing to the

group)

Do you know who he is?  He's with

Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's

a cop.

VINCENT

You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I

should kill you.

SAM

But you can't.

SEAMUS

(to Gregor, with an Irish

accent)

If you want to live you'll do exactly as

I tell you.

EDVARD

Where do I know you from?

VINCENT

Vienna.

EDVARD

Of course...I remember.  I quite liked

you, I'm sorry to have to do this.

SAM (O.S.)

Hey...

DEIRDRE

Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch

would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you

think?

VINCENT

That double-crossing bitch.

VINCENT

That makes twice now you've saved my

life.

SAM

I didn't save your life back there.

Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save

shit.

VINCENT

You see it your way, I'll see it mine.

You need a doctor.

SAM

(hopeful)

You know one around here?  Somebody you

trust?

VINCENT

No...I thought I'd take you to the

hospital.

SAM

(sharply)

No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I

have to.

VINCENT

(he can't believe this)

Fix it yourself?

(a thought comes to him)

Why are we even doing this?  There's no

need to run, Christ...

(he can't disguise his disgust)

You're a cop.

SAM

Not exactly.

VINCENT

You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

SAM

If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have

busted you a long time ago.  This isn't

about you, it's about the job I have to

do.

VINCENT

And what job is that?

SAM

My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to

know about.  I can't go to the local cops

-- they'd never be able to get close

enough at this point.  It's me or nobody,

and I've been on this job too goddamned

long not to finish.

VINCENT

It looks to me like we're all that's left

of our group.

SAM

We?  There is no we in my world now,

Vincent, just me.

VINCENT

I'm going with you.

SAM

This doesn't involve you, don't you

understand?  I can't even guarantee you

any money out of all this.

VINCENT

It isn't about money for me, not

anymore.

SAM

You don't have to do this.

VINCENT

(with great finality)

Yes I do.

DEIRDRE

When we're done with this, I want to do

for that one myself.

SEAMUS

Now there's the Deirdre I know.

DEIRDRE

And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus

Reilly?

SEAMUS

It means I was worried that all the time

you spent away from the fold might have

affected you.  You've been living the

life of the hired gun -- the well paid

hired gun, I might note.  There's no

glory to it, but there are those that

like it.

DEIRDRE

So you thought that maybe I'd grown too

attached to this charade I've been

playing, is that it?

SEAMUS

It's been known to happen.

DEIRDRE

Not to me, you know that.

SEAMUS

(goading her)

I thought I did.

DEIRDRE

I guess you don't know me, then, if you

think I won't kill you for an insult like

that!

SEAMUS

Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I

had to do it.

DEIRDRE

Remember what we agreed on, Seamus: when

we get home, I don't play "the girl"

again.

VINCENT

Hello, Jean-Pierre.

JEAN-PIERRE

Hello, my friend.

(with a look at Sam)

He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

SAM

American.

JEAN-PIERRE

Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we

see what we can do for you?

VINCENT

(to Sam)

It's right there, beneath the surface.  I

can just make it out.

JEAN-PIERRE

Are you sure you won't have a drink?

SAM

(sharply)

No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the

mind I can control.

(quick beat)

Alright, let's do it.

SAM

Douse the wound with alcohol.

SAM

(to Jean-Pierre)

Take that sponge and wipe away as much of

the blood as you can, keep it clean so I

can see.

SAM

(to Vincent)

Take the clamp...

SAM

Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.

VINCENT

Alright, it's done.

SAM

You see the bullet?

VINCENT

Clearly.

SAM

Good.  Now take the forceps, and

remember, Vincent, what we're doing here

is routine.  I've done stuff like this at

least twenty times in the field.  There

are no vital organs where you're working,

no major muscles or arteries -- you can't

kill me.  Just make sure you've got the

bullet before you try to pull it out.

VINCENT

(holding the bullet aloft)

A souvenir...

SAM

(to Vincent)

You think you can stitch me up on you

own?

JEAN-PIERRE

Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

SAM

Then if you don't mind...

(he hands the cigarette back to

Vincent)

I'm gonna pass out.

JEAN-PIERRE

He's tough, your American friend.

VINCENT

Yes, Sam's tough alright.

JEAN-PIERRE

And you respect him.

VINCENT

Of course.  Don't you?

JEAN-PIERRE

I've never seen a man who could have

taken what he just went through.

(beat)

He's a cop?

VINCENT

(beat, trying to find a way to

say it)

Not exactly.

JEAN-PIERRE

Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?

(beat)

So he saved your life, then?

VINCENT

How did you know?

JEAN-PIERRE

If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in

his head a long time ago.

JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)

You're feeling better?

SAM

(responding to the question)

Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for

now.

JEAN-PIERRE

(pointing at Sam's wounded

side)

You should really let a doctor look at

that.

SAM

Soon.

JEAN-PIERRE

But first you have something to take care

of?

SAM

Yeah.

JEAN-PIERRE

Something important?  A thing that cannot

wait?

SAM

It gets done now or not at all.  Another

couple of days and the parties concerned are

gone where I can't get them.

JEAN-PIERRE

Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,

but I am the one who connected Vincent to

this job, his agent, if you will.  He is

one of my oldest friends and I owe him a

great debt, much like the debt I suspect

he owes you.

SAM (O.S.)

Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.

JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)

He sees this differently, as you well

know.

SAM (O.S.)

I didn't expect that he would.

JEAN-PIERRE

You suffered through an agonizing pain

last night, pain you could have avoided

by declaring yourself an agent of the

law.

SAM

Vincent told you that I'm a cop?

JEAN-PIERRE

Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal

would have the extensive military and

medical expertise you do.  And so I place

the pieces of the puzzle together in a

way that makes sense to me.  You work for

some government agency and you carry a

gun, and in my world, that makes you a

cop.

SAM

So this is what, a test?

JEAN-PIERRE

Call it a reckoning of character.

SAM

If I was healthy, I could take that away

from you.

JEAN-PIERRE

Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if

you try I'll kill you.

SAM

So what is it you want to know?

JEAN-PIERRE

I suppose I want to know how a man like

you is created.

SAM

Created?

JEAN-PIERRE

Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like

steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern

Samurai.  I've spent my life around

extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.

But I've never seen anyone like you.

(beat)

I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes

with you.

SAM

Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll

have to carry it for himself.  And I'm

not any kind of Samurai.

JEAN-PIERRE

You seem one to me.

SAM

A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by

the code of Bushido, the way of the

warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.

(beat)

The world isn't about honor, anymore.

It's about survival.

JEAN-PIERRE

Survival.  I suppose that's as good a

cause as any.

DEIRDRE

Where's the case?

GREGOR

(nervous)

There's a problem...

SEAMUS

(jumping all over him)

Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to

me, and if you are you're a dead man!

DEIRDRE

Would somebody tell me what fucking well

happened in there?

SEAMUS

(disgusted)

Nothing.

GREGOR

(eager to explain)

The package didn't come.  I'm sure it

will tomorrow.

SEAMUS

(he's almost foaming at the

mouth)

If you're lying to me you poor excuse for

a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains

all over this car.

GREGOR

(beyond desperate)

I swear, it has to come here!  It has

to...

SEAMUS

Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make

sure you're on the level.

SEAMUS

And it seems to me I saw a sign in there

that says they got a late afternoon

delivery.  Why don't we come back later

today and do this all over again, huh?

TONY

Hey, man, they're both great movies.  One

is more of a character study, the other

is more of a straight action thing, but

they're great movies, and he's an amazing

fucking filmmaker.

TONY

Excuse me...

TONY

(to Vincent)

My man, how you doing?

VINCENT

I'm alright.  And you?

TONY

Doing well.

(with a look at Sam)

This is?

VINCENT

A friend.  I was telling him about how

you always have the latest tapes.

TONY

Why don't we step into my office...

TONY

So what can I do for you?

VINCENT

I was wondering if you had any movies

that were particularly new.

TONY

Matter of face there's this flick I've

been hearing about.  I haven't seen it,

but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

SAM

What's the story?

TONY

It's an international thing.  Several

different peoples involved, criminals

from all over the world, experts brought

together to do a job.  But maybe the most

interesting thing about it is that

preeminent in the plot we find the

Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together.

An unlikely group of partners.

VINCENT

Do you have the tape?

TONY

I might know where you could get a copy.

TONY

(to Vincent and Sam)

Let me do some business with my boy here,

and I'll meet you across the street in

five.  I gotta make homes here feel like

he's getting a good deal while I give him

the pleasure of overpaying me for a

couple of second generation pirates.

TONY

(his mouth full)

What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of

talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of

it at first, cause, like I said, the

Irish and the Russians are an unlikely

mix.

VINCENT

You said you might know where we can get

a copy of this tape?

TONY

All depends on whether you want the

Russian or the Gaelic language version.

SAM

(instantly)

Gaelic.

TONY

You sure?

SAM

I'm sure.

VINCENT

(to Tony)

Can you get it?

TONY

The Russian would be easier.

SAM

Why's that?

TONY

Cause the Russian production company

would be easier to find.

SAM

It's the Irish tape we want.

TONY

(with a sigh)

Gonna be tough.

TONY

Last I heard there was a film rep for the

Irish players staying at this address,

name of Seamus Reilly.

SAM

(repeating it, he knows this

name)

Seamus Reilly.

VINCENT

(to Sam)

You know him?

SAM

I know of him.

TONY

Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish

Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his

more moderate filmmaking brethren have

turned to making movies for peace-loving

pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

VINCENT

I get the picture.

VINCENT

Tony and I have to talk some business,

first.

TONY

I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to

moan about the price, we settle somewhere

in the middle.

VINCENT

It's a matter of respect.

(to Sam)

Why don't you wait outside, this won't

take long.

SAM

The Irish representative?

VINCENT

Yes.

SAM

What's this?

VINCENT

The address of the Russian production

company.  Just in case we need to find

them.

SAM

Thorough man.

SAM

You sure your friend got the right place?

VINCENT

If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

VINCENT

Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?

SAM

Do what?

VINCENT

Continue when it would be so much easier

to give it up.

SAM

It's my job.

VINCENT

Then quit.

(beat)

You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

SAM

Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the

guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard

said.

VINCENT

It's a cover, then.  A cover within a

cover, a feint within a feint.

(quick beat)

You work for the CIA, it's the only

possible answer.

SAM

I'm a field agent -- last of an already

extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

VINCENT

Dark ops?

SAM

Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping.

Assassination.

VINCENT

Very ugly.

SAM

It is at that.

VINCENT

Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much

the modern Samurai after all.

SAM

I never made that claim.

VINCENT

I know.  Jean-Pierre did.

SAM

You were behind the door?

VINCENT

I was waiting to see what would happen.

I didn't want to kill him if I didn't

have to.

SAM

You would have done that?

VINCENT

I would have tried not to.  But yes, if

it would have kept him from shooting you,

I would have.

SAM

(almost to himself)

How could you have done that?

VINCENT

Because I owe you.

(he sees something)

Look at that...

SAM (O.S.)

(quietly exultant)

All things come to those who wait.

VINCENT (O.S.)

(really surprised by this)

He's not dead.

SAM

(figuring it out)

They don't have the package.

VINCENT

You think?

SAM

You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.

If they had the package, they'd have

killed him.

VINCENT & SAM

(simultaneously)

They're going to get it.

SAM

Don't do it...

DEIRDRE

Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.

(she really sounds betrayed)

I can't believe I misjudged you like I

did.

SAM

Oh please..you're on some sort of holy

mission?

DEIRDRE

I'm a patriate.

SAM

Don't even think that I'm buying that.

DEIRDRE

Where do you get off saying word one?

All the time pretending to be one of us,

it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus

and myself.  And here you are so high and

mighty, like you're so different from the

rest of us.

SAM

I didn't say I was.

DEIRDRE

(she sees something)

Bloody fucking hell...

SAM

Don't even think it.

SAM

I'd kill you before you had it halfway

out.

SAM (V.O.)

Put your seatbelt on.

VINCENT

What the fuck happened?

SAM

I don't know...

VINCENT

You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her,

there was no way out.

SEAMUS

What in bloody hell is going on?

DEIRDRE

They're part of the team.  One of them's

the guy I told you about.

SEAMUS

From Interpol?

DEIRDRE

That's him.

VINCENT

Why didn't you kill her?

SEAMUS

Why didn't you kill him?

VINCENT

(figuring it out)

You slept with her!

SEAMUS

How is it these fellahs managed to get

the drop on us?

DEIRDRE

I told you: they're good...

VINCENT

(slamming the dashboard in

disgust)

You slept with her!

SEAMUS

(lecturing Deridre)

You should have kill him when you had

the chance.  But no...

VINCENT

You put everything on the line because

you...

SEAMUS

(as if finishing Vincent's

sentence)

You slept with the fucker!!

VINCENT (O.S.)

Fuck...

VINCENT

Left left left!!!

SEAMUS

(waving the package)

This better be the real thing or you're a

dead man!

GREGOR

It is, I'm telling you it is!!

SEAMUS

You've told me a lot of things, boyo...

SEAMUS

Lose them!

DEIRDRE

You lose them!

SEAMUS

To the right!!!

SAM

Give me a cigarette.

VINCENT

Right now?

SAM

Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

VINCENT

(fumbling with a cigarette)

Why are you driving?

(rapid fire)

You're not French, you don't live here,

you don't know these roads.  Why are you

driving?

SEAMUS

About time!

DEIRDRE

(glancing in her mirror)

Not yet...

SEAMUS

(practically tearing his hair)

Good Christ!  Can't you lose these

jokers?

DEIRDRE

(through clenched teeth)

They're good!

VINCENT (V.O.)

We don't have much time.

SAM

Nice place.

VINCENT

(by way of explaining)

I'm not here very much.

SAM

Business keeps you on the road?

VINCENT

Something like that.

SAM

I know I don't need to say this to you,

but I need to say it to you.

(beat)

This is my job, I have to do it.

VINCENT

So I do it.

SAM

No you don't, and you know it.

VINCENT

If our positions were reversed, would you

leave me?

SAM

(he says this too quickly)

In a minute.

VINCENT

I think not.

VINCENT

(considering the weapons)

Do we need anything else?

SAM

Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

DEIRDRE

You better be careful, Seamus, before

something happens a plastic surgeon can't

fix.

SEAMUS

(a hideous laugh)

Plastic fucking surgeon?

(indicates his face)

You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre

lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and

I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those

who done it to me, I'll take my pound of

flesh before this is all over.

DEIRDRE

You're thinking with your gun, Seamus,

and not your head...

SEAMUS

(losing it)

Shut up!!!

(he puts a gun to her head)

Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior

officer and you will do as I goddamn well

say, is that understood?!?

SEAMUS

Do I need to repeat myself?

DEIRDRE

No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

SAM

Not here.  They might see it.

VINCENT

If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm

going to go out smoking.

(takes the cigarettes back and

lights one)

Besides, there's half a forest between us

and them, they can't see a goddamned

thing.

SAM

Time to quit.

VINCENT

Just like that?

SAM

Not just like that... Just before I turn

around and it's six months from now and

the first thing I do when I wake up in

the morning is light a cigarette.

VINCENT

(obviously he does this)

What of it?

(almost to himself)

Samurai pain in the ass.

SAM

(he hates this)

Would you stop with that...

VINCENT

Why?  You've got more force of will than

anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun

like it's a part of you, you perform

surgery on yourself without anesthesia...

(quick beat)

And most amazing of all, you quit

smoking, just like that.

SAM

(qith a cynical laugh)

The mark of a true Samurai.

(seriously)

What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no

different than what you do.  We're both

hired guns, and this is a job -- like any

other job.

VINCENT

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is

a job like any other?  Surely, if you are

a hired gun, you realize that some times

you just have to walk away without

getting what you came for.

SAM

Because I don't walk away.

VINCENT

Why not?

SAM

It's the one thing I've got left to hold

onto.

(beat)

Jean-Pierre is one of your closest

friends, is he not?

VINCENT

Closest and oldest.

SAM

And yet you would have killed him to save

my life.

(quick beat)

You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that

I can't even remember anymore.  I don't

know that I ever even had it to begin

with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to

finish my job.

VINCENT

And when you finish?  What then?  This

package, whatever it is, do you give it

to the CIA?  Do you really think they

deserve it?

SAM

That's a good question.

VINCENT

Do you have a good answer?

SAM

(he's really just considering

this)

No, I don't.

MIKHI

(in Russian, English subtitles)

Sit, sit...

(offering a cigarette)

Would you like one?

GREGOR

(in English)

No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.

(letting that sink in for a

minute)

Since I won't speak your language, and

you can't speak mine, English will do

nicely.

MIKHI

(makes no never mind to him)

Whatever you wish...

(lights his own cigarette)

This has all been a terrible mistake,

Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with

you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill

you.

GREGOR

Edvard said the same thing about you

before he died.

MIKHI

I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd

believe him.

GREGOR

(suddenly sharp)

Enough!

MIKHI

Ahh...

SEAMUS (O.S.)

The moment of truth, is it?

GREGOR

What is he doing here?

SEAMUS

What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to

see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the

Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had

hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull

your thieving double cross.  But they

only just found out that what's in the

briefcase is completely useless without

me.  I can't fight them, and they can't

kill me -- that means we're gonna have to

do business together.

GREGOR

But you hate each other!

SEAMUS

What's a little hate between business

partners?

SAM

I'm on point, Vincent.

GREGOR

(to Seamus)

So, you've got it all figured, do you?

SEAMUS

Figured enough to know there's an odd man

out and I'm looking at him.

GREGOR

I think not.

(holds up the Briefcase)

I have, of course, taken the precaution

of wiring the briefcase to explode five

seconds after it opens.  Unless, of

course, I deactivate it before it goes

off.

DEIRDRE

(under her breath)

That fucking figures...

GREGOR

Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll

kill myself and whoever happens to be

near me at the time.

MIKHI

And more importantly --

GREGOR

I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

SEAMUS

It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna

have to sit down to table and work out an

agreement.

MIKHI

What was that?

VINCENT

That's one less I owe you...

DEIRDRE

(to Seamus and Mikhi)

You two stay here and watch our mutual

interest.

SAM

Let's work our way through the building.

I'll take one wing, you take the other.

SAM

Watch your back, Vincent.

SEAMUS

I can't take it anymore.

(to Mikhi)

Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish

what needs finishing!

SAM

Go on, them...

DEIRDRE

Let it go, Sam, walk away.

DEIRDRE

God damn it!

GREGOR

(a feral hiss)

We'll die if we stay here!

MIKHI

(threatening with the gun)

You'll die if you leave here.

VINCENT

You have to stop doing that!

SAM

I'll work on it...

SEAMUS (O.S.)

Turn around real slow, and try hard not

to breathe when you do it.

SEAMUS

It's you...

(touches his face)

You're the one did this to my face, are

you?

SAM

That's me.

SEAMUS

Have a nice afterlife.

DEIRDRE (O.S.)

Seamus!

SEAMUS

Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking

bullet in his head!

SEAMUS

Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can

find that stinking Gregor, he's got the

bloody package!  For God's sake, you're a

soldier...

SEAMUS

(sensing he's getting to

her)

You're one of us...You been born and bred

with your own people, you can't go

against your nature.  C'mon, girl, I'm

you're people.

DEIRDRE

I'm no girl, Seamus...

DEIRDRE

And you ain't nobody's people.

SAM

(to Deirdre)

Let's get him out of here...

VINCENT

Finish the job...

SAM

And now...

VINCENT

(a commanding whisper)

Finish it!

DEIRDRE

(calling out)

Sam...

VINCENT

I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go

out and get the bastard.

DEIRDRE

He's got the briefcase rigged to explode

five seconds after anybody other than

himself tries to open it.

SAM

Deirdre, wait up --

GREGOR

You might have made a good field agent

you arrogant American prick, but you're

not smart enough to go up against me.

GREGOR

Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the

bitch, I don't care.

(beat)

And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting.

Put down your weapon and walk away.

DEIRDRE

Don't do it, Sam!

GREGOR

Shut up!

DEIRDRE

He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though

me and kill this fucker.

SEAMUS (O.S.)

(a horrible croak)

If you don't, I will...

SEAMUS

(to Sam, in a cold pale rage)

Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let

you live.

SAM

Are you alright?

DEIRDRE

Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in

here!

DETECTIVE

I need to speak with that man.

SAM

I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

SAM

Call that number and ask them what you

should do.

DOCTOR

You can see your friend, now.

SAM

Thank you very much.

DOCTOR

The field dressing you put on saved his

life.

(giving him a look)

Where di you learn to do that?

SAM

Here and there, I guess.

VINCENT

You son-of-a-bitch...

SAM

What?

VINCENT

You speak French.

SAM

What of it?

VINCENT

(in mock exasperation)

Nothing...

VINCENT

(repeating the Doctor's words

in English)

"Your field dressing saved his life."

That's three I owe you.

SAM

You don't owe me a goddamned thing,

Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in

front of a bullet for me.

(very seriously, he now

believes this)

I owe you a heavy debt.

VINCENT

(relishing this)

I know.

SAM

(rising to leave)

You better get some sleep, alright?

VINCENT

Tell me something first.

(a quick beat)

The package: what was it?

SAM

I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a

bunch of people who are too dead to tell

us.  There's probably a couple of guys

back at the Company who know, but I don't

think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

VINCENT

What happened to it?

SAM

Gone.  Destroyed.

VINCENT

(sighs, then a beat)

I guess that's for the best.

VINCENT

Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake,

you could have killed the two of them

with one shot.  You could have had the

package, finished the job.  But you

didn't, you sacrificed the job to save

her life.  Why?

SAM

It's what you would have done.

VINCENT (V.O.)

Would you just smoke already...

SAM

I told you, I quit.

VINCENT

Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate

smoking alone.

(turning to Deirdre)

How about you?  I thought all you IRA

types smoked.

DEIRDRE

Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill

more patriots than bullets.

(a quick beat)

Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

VINCENT

So where do you go from here?

DEIRDRE

I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the

three of us might partner up -- guns for

hire, that sort of thing.

VINCENT

I'm up for that...

SAM

Not me.  You work too often with the same

people and you become friends -- clouds

your judgement.

DEIRDRE

Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends

already we wouldn't be here now, would

we?

VINCENT

She's got a point.

(playing a trump card)

Besides, I know of a job that's

available.

SAM

How much does it pay?

PUNK

This is for Seamus!

VINCENT

(soft yet urgent)

We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.

VINCENT

(a little louder, bordering

desperation)

Let's go!!

VINCENT

(thrusting the cigarettes out to

Sam)

Doctor's orders...

VINCENT (O.S.)

Goodbye, Sam...
