CHARLIE

Sherri! What are you doing?

SHERRI

I'm leaving you.

CHARLIE

Oh, thank God... I thought you were

robbing our own home, because frankly,

that's insane. I mean, what could

you possibly gain by robbing your

own home? I don't mean to meddle,

but isn't it better to rob other

peoples' homes? Start accumulating

their wealth as opposed to just

reaccumulating your own wealth.

SHERRI

That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really

leaving.

CHARLIE

What?! Just because we had a fight

last night?

SHERRI

We've had a fight every night for

two months. Ever since I brought up

the subject of marriage, you've found

fault with everything I do. Why

couldn't we have gotten married,

Charlie?

CHARLIE

(beat)

I'm too young to get married.

(begins putting her

things back)

I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We

love living together.

SHERRI

It's been two years now. I need

something more.

CHARLIE

See, Sherri, this is frustrating for

me, okay. When we first started going

out I thought we agreed that we

weren't the sort of people who got

married.

SHERRI

That's like saying we're not the

sort of people who are going to grow

old. We're not going to fall into

that "growing old" trap. Face it,

you've got a problem with commitment,

Charlie. Take a look at your other

girlfriends. Every time you get close

to a commitment there's something

wrong with them.

CHARLIE

Hey, I broke up with them for good

reasons.

SHERRI

What about Sandy?

CHARLIE

Sandy was an alcoholic.

SHERRI

No-no-no. You thought she was an

alcoholic. She just drank more than

you drank. What about Jill?

CHARLIE

She hated my family.

SHERRI

You thought she hated your family.

Nobody hates your family. Everybody

loves your family. What about Julie?

CHARLIE

She smelled like soup.

SHERRI

What does that mean?

CHARLIE

She smelled exactly like Campbell's

Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty,

physically dirty.

SHERRI

Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're

gonna say were my problems? Are you

gonna tell your friends that I was a

junkie, that I wasn't supportive

enough or that I smelled like relish?

Charlie, I loved you. It could have

worked out.

(she goes to the door)

Think about it.

CHARLIE

Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're

Scottish you know?

TONY

Oh.

CHARLIE

I had that dream again.

TONY

Oh, is that the one where you suspect

that a fat man in a diaper, on a

lazy susan has interfered with your

plans for the evening?

CHARLIE

No, but I have had that one. No, in

this one I'm in love...

TONY

Yeah.

CHARLIE

And I say to myself, 'I've finally

found somebody that I'm truly

comfortable with.' You know when

you're so comfortable that you'll

let them put makeup on you to see

what you would look like if you were

a girl. Anyways you know what I do

in the dream next?

TONY

You propose?

CHARLIE

(after a pause)

No. I die.

TONY

But Charlie, you're a normal suburban

guy at heart, from a normal suburban

family. Didn't you tell me you always

wanted to get married and have a

family.

CHARLIE

Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There

are seven main rites of passage in a

man's life. Birth, first day of

school, last day of school. Marriage.

Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at

marriage. I'm two rites of passage

away from death.

TONY

I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

TONY

Christ. It's the cops.

CHARLIE

Tony, you are a cop.

TONY

I know. Isn't it awful? I work with

those guys. They're assholes.

TONY

Salve zio mio.

UNCLE

Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.

UNCLE

Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa

e' in galera per la terza volta.

UNCLE

I'll have the waitress bring you

cappuccino.

CHARLIE

What did your uncle say?

TONY

He says my Dad's back in jail again.

CHARLIE

Ah, I'm sorry, man.

TONY

You know, it's funny I don't even

feel related to my parents anymore.

I feel like your mom and dad are

more like my parents. I feel more

Scottish than Italian.

CHARLIE

Tony Spiletti, I don't think you

could get more Italian than that.

Unless of course your name was Tony

Italian Guy.

CHARLIE

I'm so bummed. Sherri was great,

wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't

I?

TONY

Yes.

CHARLIE

You've got to help me get through

this night.

TONY

You've just got to get back on the

horse.

CHARLIE

Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to

be a mistake. I ordered the large

cappuccino.

CHARLIE

(to the girls)

Do you think these cups could be

larger? They're practically bowls.

CHARLIE

I feel like I'm having Campbell's

Cuppuccino.

TONY

Join us in a cup of coffee? There's

enough room?

GIRLS

Sure!

SUSAN

My name's Susan and this is June. We

think you're funny.

TONY

My name's Tony. This is my friend

Charlie.

CHARLIE

Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you

later, girls.

TONY

You really don't understand, do you?

When a girl comes over to your table

and says, 'I think you're funny.' It

means you've pretty much been given

the keys to the city. Charlie, this

is big.

CHARLIE

Perhaps you've confused me with

someone who gives a shit. Here's

what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end

up going out with them tonight, maybe

even home with them. Well go out for

two months. Soon she'll move in,

we'll be happy, She'll want more of

a commitment. I'll be terrified and

I'll do something to ruin it. Just

like I did with Sherri.

JUNE

Poor, guy... He seemed so nice.

TONY

(talking, choked up)

I just broke up with somebody as

well. She left me high and dry.

I AM LONELY

IT'S REALLY HARD

THIS POEM SUCKS

HARRIET

(angry)

Goddamn shoplifter.

(conscious of Charlie's

presence; holding up

bloody meat)

But I got him!

(smiles)

You're next.

CHARLIE

(backing out the door;

terrified)

I've come at a bad time.

HARRIET

No stay!

CHARLIE

No, no, really... Obviously you've

got things you have to do. You've

got to dismember the rest of his

bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow

grave. Cover the body with quick

lime. Really so much to do, so little

time and I'm only in the way here,

I'm just gonna go. Good luck.

HARRIET

(referring to meat in

hand)

Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he

stole. This isn't a piece of him or

anything. This is Icelandic Shank.

CHARLIE

I bet it goes well with a nice

Chianti. Fittfittfitt.

HARRIET

(laughs)

Can I help you?

CHARLIE

Yes. Do you have haggis?

HARRIET

Yes, we do. It's over here in our

Scottish Cuts section. One?

CHARLIE

Yes! I've never been able to find

haggis anywhere, except at my parents'

house. They're Scottish.

HARRIET

(ringing up his order)

That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine.

Will there be anything else?

CHARLIE

Yes. I know it's a long shot, but

you wouldn't by any chance happen to

have any Prussian Venison?

HARRIET

Now where in the world would I get

Prussian Venison?

CHARLIE

(calling up)

Mom, Dad, I'm here.

STUART (O.S.)

We're in here, son.

ALL

(singing)

S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT

STUART

(noticing Charlie)

Come give your old man a kiss or

I'll kick your teeth in.

MAY

Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would

ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride.

(begins singing; in

thick Scottish accent)

HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST

BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD...

STUART

May, shut it.

CHARLIE

Hey, William.

WILLIAM

(on his stomach on

the floor; watching

TV)

Hey, Charlie.

STUART

SCORES! MAGIC GOAL!

TONY

Aye -- magic.

STUART

Let's have a look at the re-play.

William, move your head. Look at the

size of that ooy's heed. I'm not

kidding. It's like an orange on a

tooth pick.

MAY

Stuart, you're going to give the boy

a complex.

STUART

I'm not kidding. That's a huge

noggin'. It has it's own weather

system. It's a virtual planetoid.

(shouting to William)

Heed! Move!

MAY

Is that enough potatoes, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in

"Close Encounters".

STUART

(sniffs the air)

Do I smell haggis?

CHARLIE

Aye, you do.

MAY

(taking it)

I'll put it in the frig.

CHARLIE

Dad, what are you doing to Tony now?

Why do you abuse his mind like this?

STUART

That's the latest report from Lyndon

H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen

and the Rothschilds masterminded the

Soviet overthrow, so that they could

reclaim lands they had annexed during

the Holy Roman Empire.

TONY

(goading Charlie)

You know a lot of this makes sense.

CHARLIE

I think you're suffering from the

Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages

start to relate to their captors.

STUART

Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact

there's a society of the five

wealthiest people in the world, called

the Pentaverate, who run everything

and meet three times a year at a

secret country mansion in Colorado,

known as "The Meadows."

CHARLIE

(sarcastic)

And that's obviously why we haven't

heard about it in the newspapers.

STUART

(inappropriately angry

& loud)

That's right. They fuckin' own the

papers, smartass. And everything

else. Why do you think Scotland's

not been able to get independence?

Because the Queen the Pentavirate

and those English dome heads in West

Minster won't have it.

CHARLIE

Who are the other members of this

pentaverate?

STUART

The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys,

the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders

before he went tits up. Oh, I hated

the Colonel with his wee beady eyes.

And that smug look on his face.

CHARLIE

Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?"

STUART

Because the Colonel puts an addictive

chemical in it that makes you crave

it fortnightly.

CHARLIE

Interesting... coo-coo

MAY

Would anyone like a juice? Charlie,

did I tell you, we bought a Juice

Tiger?

CHARLIE

A Juice Tiger?

MAY

Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my

National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet.

Would you like potato juice?

CHARLIE

Thank you, no.

MAY

Sherri's late.

CHARLIE

Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.

MAY

Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the

daughter your father was never able

to give me.

CHARLIE

I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm

twenty-nine and my poems haven't

even been published yet.

STUART

But it's not just the poetry is it

son? You're afraid if you get married

you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I

was a strapping young butcher, at

the height of my creative powers.

When it came to de-boning a side of

beef, there was nobody that could

touch me. Then I married your mother.

And people would still stand in awe

as I filleted a shoulder of lamb.

MAY

Maybe it's just as well not to get

married, look at the news. Where did

I put it?

STUART

Heed. Move that melon of yours into

the bathroom and get the paper for

your mother.

CHARLIE

That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit.

I wouldn't wipe my ass with that

paper.

STUART

What are you talking about? It's the

fifth highest circulating paper in

the United States, I'll have you

know.

MAY

Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon

Murderer. She marries men under fake

identities, and then murders them.

She killed some German martial arts

expert, and some plumber named Ralph

Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown.

STUART

Scores! Two nil. Magic!

TONY

Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the

TV set.

CROSS FADES:

STUART

(singing Rod Stewart's

song)

YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY

DREAMS...

YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED

AND BABY I'VE DECIDED...

MAY

Ah, you're steaming.

TONY

(pulling away)

See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.

MAY

Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian

bastard.

CHARLIE

See you later, mom.

(calling out)

See you later, Dad.

STUART

Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour.

WILLIAM

Take me with you.

MAN

Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to

have...

MAN

Thanks.

CUT TO:

HARRIET

(spotting Charlie in

the crowd)

Oh, hi haggis, right?

CHARLIE

It was a big hit.

HARRIET

(finishing up with a

customer)

I remember you told me you were

Scottish, but do you really like

haggis.

CHARLIE

No. I think it's repellent in every

way. In fact, I think most Scottish

cuisine is based on a dare.

HARRIET

(to the next customer)

Can I help you?

(to Charlie)

Sorry, I'm really busy.

CHARLIE

Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you

need a hand?

HARRIET

Well, actually, Yes.

HARRIET

Can you get me four Belgian

porterhouses? Do you know what a

porterhouse looks like?

CHARLIE

I'm meat literate.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)

Yes, do you have any fresh blubber?

CHARLIE

I'll check.

(pause)

You want blubber, right?

CUSTOMER

Yeah.

CUSTOMER

My parents are coming to town. You

know how parents are. They'll drive

you nuts.

HARRIET

Look, I'm really grateful. Can I

offer you some meat as payment?

Please, help yourself to some meat.

CHARLIE

I'm trying to be a vegetarian.

HARRIET

Trying to be a vegetarian?

CHARLIE

Yeah, the problem is I really love

hot-dogs.

HARRIET

I think the meat industry invented

hot-dogs to stop people from becoming

vegetarians. There's got to be

something I can do to repay you.

CHARLIE

You could take me to a nice romantic

dinner.

CHARLIE

(sniffing the relish)

This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.

HARRIET

I hate talking about old

relationships.

CHARLIE

Then let's not and say we did.

HARRIET

(she laughs)

That was easy -- What a nice guy.

You've probably never done a mean

thing in your life.

CHARLIE

You'd be surprised.

HARRIET

I'd like to hear.

(to his confused look)

Name me something bad you've done in

your life.

CHARLIE

Are you kidding me?

HARRIET

No. Did you ever steal anything? You

ever hit someone?

CHARLIE

Well, I've been in fights. Let me

think.

HARRIET

(as Charlie thinks)

Not one bad thing, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Tell me something bad you've done.

And it better be bad. I mean, evil.

HARRIET

How evil?

CHARLIE

Really evil.

(thinks)

Like how many people have you brutally

murdered?

HARRIET

"Brutal" is such a subjective word.

I mean, what's brutal to one person

might be totally reasonable to

another.

CHARLIE

This just reminded her of that scene

in "Brian's Song".

HARRIET

Actually, he just proposed to her.

Those are tears of joy.

HARRIET

Prost.

MAN

Danke, Fraulein.

CHARLIE

You're very smart. It's a shame I'm

going to have to destroy you.

HARRIET

Do bright women intimidate you?

CHARLIE

No, not at all.

HARRIET

Really, what do you look for in women

you date?

CHARLIE

(thinks)

Well, I know everyone always say

"sense of humor", but I'd have to go

with breast size.

(she laughs)

How about you? In a guy.

HARRIET

Income of course, and then...

(thinks)

...savings.

CHARLIE

Me likey how you thinkey.

HARRIET

I'll make us some tea.

CHARLIE

Hey, you know what this apartment

needs? A really large oversized poster

of Atlantic City.

HARRIET

I used to live there. That's where I

had my first supermarket job.

HARRIET (O.S.)

(coming into room)

I only have chamomile. I hope that's

all right.

HARRIET

It's North-South.

(to his confused look)

For health reasons. See... I had

this friend, he was a martial arts

expert. Anyways, he used to sleep

North-South. I don't know... It's a

martial arts thing and it just sort

of became a habit with me.

CHARLIE

(walking into living

room)

You know Scotland has it's own martial

arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly

head butting and kicking people when

they're on the ground.

HARRIET

Late?

CHARLIE

No. No. Not for me.

HARRIET

Who for then?

CHARLIE

Who for then what?

HARRIET

Well, you looked at your watch and

said it wasn't late for you... I

wondered who it was late for.

CHARLIE

Not me. No, Sir. Not here.

(after a pause;

checking watch)

Maybe it is late.

CHARLIE

Look, the truth is, yes, I had a

great time, and I'd like to kiss

you, but if we do kiss, then we'll

kiss on the couch and if we kiss on

the couch, then we'll kiss in the

bedroom, and once you're in the

bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I

always rush it. And this time I feel

like maybe I should wait. Maybe we

should let it build naturally and

grow, instead of just immediately

spending the night together.

HARRIET

I want to spend the night together.

CHARLIE

(sold)

I have no problem with that.

HARRIET

Yes! Yes!

HARRIET

Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph.

HARRIET (O.S.)

Now now Ralph!

CHARLIE

(waking her)

Harriet...? Harriet...?

(as her eyes open)

You were having a dream, or...? You

kept saying the name Ralph.

HARRIET

Ralph?

CHARLIE

Ralph. I heard you say it.

HARRIET

(sleepily)

That's odd. Just today I was thinking

about, her. She's a friend.

CHARLIE

(starting to leave)

Is she nice --? Ralph...

HARRIET

Yeah. She's great.

DISSOLVE INTO:

CHARLIE

You know... with this drought in

California total strangers are urged

to shower together.

ROSE

Go away.

CHARLIE

Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.

CHARLIE

Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have

scared the... I'm Harriet's friend,

Charlie, and you must be...

(hopefully)

Ralph?

ROSE

I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this

is Harriet's note.

ROSE

(reading)

'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake

you, make yourself at home, thanks

for making me smile.' Harriet.

CHARLIE

That's a very nice note.

ROSE

I'll make you some breakfast.

CHARLIE

Gee, I'd love to but I'm running

late.

ROSE

What would you say to blueberry

pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape

juice and Kona coffee?

ROSE

I'm sorry I didn't have any of those

other things.

CHARLIE

Hey, that stuff'll kill you while

Fruit Loops are light and probably

reasonably high in Fiber. I like

Apple Jacks too.

ROSE

Got 'em.

CHARLIE

So this is your apartment?

ROSE

Yes. She's been here the past three

months... ever since she came back

from Miami. I used to visit her

occasionally. She didn't speak of

me?

CHARLIE

(shakes his head, no)

She told me about a martial arts guy

and there was some discussion about

Ralph...

ROSE

She spoke of them...?

CHARLIE

She spoke of the martial arts guy

and screamed about Ralph...

ROSE

(affectionately)

Well, you know Harriet.

CHARLIE

Actually, I really don't.

ROSE

(puzzled)

But you did have sex with her?

CHARLIE

(taken aback)

Hello.

ROSE

Yet you still don't know her.

(contemplates this)

See, that's the problem with sex.

It's not very revealing.

CHARLIE

My, look at the time.

ROSE

(after a pause)

You should be careful, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I am... usually. I just... You should

know, this is very unusual that I

would do this so soon, in this day

and age particularly, but... We just

really hit it off. We did. And...

ROSE

I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet

that anything happened.

CHARLIE

But... nothing did happen.

ROSE

Exactly. Or she would be jealous.

And when she gets jealous, we both

know what she's capable of.

CHARLIE

No, we don't. You do, like I said, I

just met her.

ROSE

You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be

careful.

FRED

Hey, Charlie. How you doin'?

CHARLIE

Good. Good. Look, Fred...

(leaning in)

You got a lot of girlfriends, right?

You know any girls named Ralph?

FRED

Ralph? Gee, Charlie. Isn't that a

guy's name?

CHARLIE

Well, not necessarily, but... Never

mind. Thanks, Fred.

CHARLIE

Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you --

you know some girls named Ralph,

right? I mean, that's a girl's name

also, isn't it?

PENNY

(confused)

I don't think so, Charlie... Uh...

CHARLIE

(walking away)

Forget it. Thanks.

TONY (V.O.)

You know I've lived in this city all

my life and I've never been to

Alcatraz.

PARK RANGER

Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger

and I will be leading you on the

tour. All the park rangers here at

Alcatraz were at one time guards,

myself included. My name is John

Johnson, but everyone here calls me

Vicki. Will you please follow me?

TONY

You're glowing, Charlie. The man's

in love.

CHARLIE

Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.

PARK RANGER

This is the main cell block area.

Home to such famous criminals as Al

Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch"

Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous

Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me,

please.

PARK RANGER

This is the cell for solitary

confinement, that over the years has

come to be known as Times Square.

TONY

So did you and Harriet?... you know...

CHARLIE

(grinning)

Sssh I don't want to talk about it.

TONY

With that look, you don't have to

talk about it. The grin alone could

get you five to seven years.

CHARLIE

Tony, get your mind out of the gutter.

All you need to know is that she's a

sweet, kind and loving person.

PARK RANGER

Now this is something none of the

other tour guides will tell you. In

this particular cell block Machine

Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the

prison system, a "bitch." And one

day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a

makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut

out his "bitch's" eyes.

CHARLIE

Look, what can I tell you. I'm

smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno.

I just don't wanna talk about it,

because then I start analyzing and

that's not good for me.

TONY

Good. I think that's good. Just let

it happen.

CHARLIE

Exactly. That's what's gonna be

different this time. Something strange

happens, let it go. It's not my

business... Like Ralph. She says

Ralph in her sleep.

TONY

Who's Ralph?

CHARLIE

I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover,

I don't want to know.

TONY

Good.

PARK RANGER

And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't

enough retribution for Kelly, the

next day he and four other inmates

took turns pissing into the "bitch's"

ocular cavity.

CHARLIE

Exactly.

(beat)

Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw

this one up.

ROSE

Did you have a nice date last night?

HARRIET

Rose, I don't really --

ROSE

He disturbed me while I was naked in

the shower this morning.

HARRIET

Yeah, he stayed over?

ROSE

I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed

about it over breakfast.

HARRIET

That's good.

ROSE

He said you had great sex last night.

HARRIET

He did?

(a beat)

Yeah.

ROSE

He seems really stuck on you. I hope

for you that it lasts.

HARRIET

Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving

person. We like each other, but I

don't want to think any further.

It's taken me a long time to get

back to dating, and I want to take

things real steady this time.

ROSE

Well, you can trust me not to tell

him anything.

HARRIET

He was quite happy not to talk about

the past.

ROSE

I did a sketch of him.

HARRIET

(looking at the picture)

That's good.

ROSE

Think I've caught him?

HARRIET

The eyes are good.

ROSE

Charlie really liked it.

HARRIET

It's a good likeness.

ROSE

Boy, I really hope it works out.

HARRIET

Rose, I don't wanna screw this one

up.

CHARLIE

Hey, uh... Ralph...?

DELIVERY GUY

(turning around)

I'm Gilbert.

CHARLIE

Shit.

HARRIET

(teasing him)

Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put

them right in water.

CHARLIE

You look great.

HARRIET

I was just getting dressed.

(picking up skirt off

couch)

What do you think of this skirt?

CHARLIE

Honestly?

(pulls her close)

I'd leave it off.

HARRIET

So then you think I could go to a

poetry concert like this?

CHARLIE

Let's forget the poetry concert.

It's already been nine hours since I

last made love to you.

HARRIET

(smiling; walking

away)

Come on we're meeting your best

friend. I wanna look good. The second

I go to the ladies room he's gonna

tell you what he really thinks of

me.

HARRIET

Come on, Charlie. We have to be there

in fifteen minutes.

CHARLIE

(following her into

bedroom)

Fifteen minutes. Perfect.

CHARLIE

(through door)

Maybe later.

ROSE (O.S.)

I thought of calling you.

CHARLIE

(startled)

Aaaahhh!

ROSE

(after a pause)

To warn you, Charlie.

(after a pause)

There are just some things you should

know, about Harriet.

CHARLIE

About Harriet?

ROSE

About her past.

CHARLIE

I don't wanna know. I mean, look

everyone has some skeletons in their

past. I only care about the future.

Not the past.

ROSE

Here's the thing. I may have to tell

Harriet.

CHARLIE

Tell her what?

ROSE

That we're lovers.

CHARLIE

We're not lovers.

ROSE

I know, and it's a damn shame.

HARRIET

I hope I'm not interrupting.

CHARLIE

(feeling weird)

No, not at all. We were just talking

about... Rose and I met yesterday,

so...

HARRIET

So I heard.

HARRIET

So, don't you think we look alike?

ROSE

Oh, we do not. Harriet was always

prettier than me. And a heck of a

lot more popular. She always had

boyfriends. The only thing I ever

got was good grades.

CHARLIE

(slightly uncomfortable)

Good grades are good.

HARRIET

She's just being kind. Show Charlie

one of your photographs, Rose. Rose

is a great artist.

ROSE

No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're

not good.

HARRIET

You're so modest. If I weren't here

to brag for you, I just don't know...

(taking out a

posterboard from

cabinet)

Show it to him, Rose. Do it.

CHARLIE

It's beautiful...

ROSE

Thanks.

CHARLIE

What is it?

ROSE

I dunno.

CHARLIE

What do you call it?

ROSE

I dunno.

CHARLIE

A lot artists don't like to title

their work. They feel it biases the

viewer.

ROSE

It is titled. It's called "I dunno".

HARRIET

We should get going, Charlie. Thanks,

Rose... See you later.

ROSE

Bye, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Rose, great to see you. We should

all go out together some time. The

three of us. That would be great.

That would be... interesting.

CHARLIE

I think you're going to love Alan

Ginsberg. He's great.

HARRIET

Oh, I know all about him.

TONY (O.S.)

Hey Charlie!

TONY

Sorry we're late.

TONY

You must be Harriet. I've heard a

lot about you.

CHARLIE

(to Tony; re: Harriet)

This is Harriet.

TONY

Oh. Sorry. Of course.

(whispering to Harriet)

I apologize. Charlie described you

as much older. And heavier.

HARRIET

(smiling)

Oh, he did...?

CHARLIE

Thank you, Tony. This is my best

friend.

TONY

And this is Susan. Charlie, you

remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.

CHARLIE

Yes, I do.

SUSAN

You're funny...

TONY

(whispers to Charlie)

I give Susan one night.

ARCADE MAN

One more and you get your pick.

CHARLIE

(to Harriet)

You do it.

HARRIET

No, Charlie. I'm the worst.

TONY

Come on, you'll be great...

ARCADE MAN

Hey!

HARRIET

Sorry... I told you Charlie.

CHARLIE

No, no, you're okay, you're just

having control problems.

CHARLIE

I know this is really, really cheesy,

but in a way this is one of the places

in San Francisco I'm most proud of.

HARRIET

Yeah, let's go in.

THRESHOLD KEEPER

Boo.

OWNER

Hi. I'm Bill, welcome to my wax

museum.

HARRIET

I feel so safe with you right now.

You're never going to leave me, are

you? I feel like I could be here

forever.

CUT TO:

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

HARRIET

(sleeptalking)

Ralph! No, Ralph!

CHARLIE

Well, this is it.

HARRIET

It'll be fine.

CHARLIE

Mom, Dad, we're here.

MAY

Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet.

Ah, she's beautiful.

HARRIET

Thank you.

MAY

She's so sweet. I hope you keep her.

(calling)

Stuart, come out here. You tube.

STUART

Ah, it's the wee Harriet.

MAY

Stuart, put your pants on.

STUART

Hold your horses.

(calling to William)

Heed! Pants!

CHARLIE

Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the

Scottish wall of fame?

STUART

Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie

tells me you're a butcher. Let's

talk meat.

CHARLIE

Dad, no one wants to talk shop.

Especially butcher shop.

STUART

Come here.

CHARLIE

Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man

it kills.

HARRIET

(releasing his hand)

I'm sorry. I just... You just

surprised me. I'm sorry.

STUART

I like this one Charlie. She's quite

a filly.

HARRIET

I'm really embarrassed.

STUART

Don't be embarrassed about having a

good strong butcher's grip. Do you

link your own sausage?

MAY

Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at

some photos of Charlie when he was a

wee'n.

CHARLIE

Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures.

MAY

Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got

a pickle up your ass.

CHARLIE

(whispering to Harriet)

I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be

okay alone with them?

HARRIET

(kissing)

Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.

STUART

Make sure there's paper, Charlie.

MAY

Make sure you leave the seat down.

CHARLIE

(shutting her up)

Ma, just show her the pictures.

STUART

And light a match.

MAY

(to Harriet)

He always leaves the seat up. He's

gotta learn.

MAY

This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky.

He's a policeman in Canada. And our

cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got

a restraining order from his wife.

She's a lovely girl. This is Billy.

He's a member of parliament. He

drinks.

HARRIET

What a nice family you have.

HARRIET (O.S.)

(through door)

Charlie was the cutest baby.

STUART (O.S.)

(through door)

You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't

fall in, did you?

CHARLIE

(through door)

Jesus...

HARRIET

I can't believe the resemblance

between you and Charlie, Mrs.

MacKenzie.

HARRIET (O.S.)

(through door)

You have the same smile. It's so

incredible.

CHARLIE

So, that was some move you put on my

Dad, there. Did you study Karate,

or...?

HARRIET

No. Not officially. I dated a guy

for a while who ran a studio.

CHARLIE

Oh, the martial arts expert. The

north-south guy. Here in San

Francisco?

HARRIET

Actually, Miami.

CHARLIE

Was that before Atlantic City, or

after?

HARRIET

Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic

City was recent. I didn't care for

Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers

and lounge singers.

DESK SERGEANT

Hey Charlie!

CHARLIE

Is Tony back there?

CAPTAIN

O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673

form completed yet, that street vendor

incident on Powell Street?

TONY

(really bummed)

Yes, Captain.

CAPTAIN

Tony, do you mind my saying that you

seem a little down?

TONY

Captain. It's about my work. About

being a policeman.

CAPTAIN

Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm

here to listen.

TONY

I know. And that's what's irritating,

you're too nice.

CAPTAIN

Too nice!?

TONY

Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes.

You should be constantly on my case,

like the captain on Starsky and Hutch.

Once a week you should routinely

haul my ass into your office, accuse

me of being a maverick and complain

to me that you're sick and tired of

defending my screwball antics to the

commissioner.

CAPTAIN

Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't

report to a commissioner. I report

to a committee, some of whom are

appointed, some elected and the

remainder co-opted on a bi-annual

basis. A quorum --

TONY

Police work should be all about

running around, following up crazy

hunches that turn out to be right,

going out on a limb.

CAPTAIN

Well Tony, I've never seen it that

way. For me police work is all about

following procedure and remaining

accountable to the general public.

TONY

(exasperated)

Captain! When I joined the police

force, I thought I was going to be

Serpico and unfortunately I ended up

being Toma. I would have settled for

Beretta.

CAPTAIN

That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed

that you should be so disillusioned.

CHARLIE

Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.

CAPTAIN

Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the

way here. You guys probably have

something you want to talk about,

and Tony, if you've still got stuff

you want to sort out, please, you

know where the suggestion box is.

CHARLIE

Nice guy. Hey, what's up?

TONY

I'm having doubts about being a cop

again. It's not like how it is on

cop shows. All I do is fill out papers

and reports.

CHARLIE

Let me get this straight, your Captain

hasn't threatened to have you up on

charges so fast you won't know what

hit you?

TONY

No! He's never once said to me that

he was going to "throw the book at

me so hard it'll knock my ass from

here till Tuesday." Anyways what's

up?

CHARLIE

Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X?

She murders her husbands on their

honeymoons and then changes her

identity and marries again.

TONY

I never heard of it. So what?

CHARLIE

Curious, that's all. I read about

it, and...

(after a pause)

I think I'm dating Mrs. X.

TONY

(after a pause)

Two words, Charlie. Get therapy.

They have doctors that deal

specifically with this illness.

CHARLIE

Everything's adding up, Tony. One of

the victims was a martial arts expert.

Last night at dinner, she put a

martial arts move on my dad.

TONY

There about twenty thousand people

in San Francisco who are martial

arts experts. Should I arrest all of

them too?

CHARLIE

If they also say Ralph in their sleep

I think it'd be a good start.

(showing him paper)

Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San

Francisco. Missing since his

honeymoon.

TONY

You're just getting scared. Like the

dream, you feel Harriet could be the

one, so you start to suspect her of

things, 'cause deep down you're scared

that if she is the one, you'll marry,

and marriage to you is death.

CHARLIE

Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay?

They're my dreams. Analyze your own

dreams.

(a beat)

It's not a marrying thing, Tony.

It's a murdering thing.

(showing him paper)

Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right?

Well so did this guy, right around

the same time she left town.

TONY

(reading article)

"Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a

name for himself for being able to

sing in six different languages the

song "Only You".

(putting paper down)

Does she know the song "Only You?"

CHARLIE

I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.

TONY

Charlie, move past it. You're running

your life by the National Enquirer.

CHARLIE

(defensively)

What? It's the fifth highest

circulating newspaper in the United

States.

(taking paper back)

Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.

KATHY

There's no record of any deaths. All

three of these guys were reported

missing around the time of their

honeymoon, but so were the wives. No

pictures of any of the brides. For

all we know they just picked up and

moved away.

CHARLIE

And Ralph Elliot, too?

TONY

Charlie, you're talking about three

guys over a seven year span. That's

hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in

this state, as of this day, is still

not illegal.

CHARLIE

(re: the article)

Yeah well murder is. And this article

says that these men were murdered by

the same woman.

KATHY

Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that,

most National Enquirer articles are

actually based on our own police

reports. They take the facts and

fabricate a story around them.

TONY

It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize

that. I mean, personally, I would

lie to you, but Kathy... has this

crazy notion of always telling the

truth.

(patting his back)

You feel better now?

CHARLIE

It guess so. It's just... if I had a

photo of Harriet, I could show it to

the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's

victims to identify her.

TONY

Charlie, listen to me! There is no

Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?

ROSE

(thrilled)

You're back. But Harriet's not here

yet.

CHARLIE

Maybe I could wait.

ROSE

Sure. That would be fine.

CHARLIE

Inside? I was hoping...

ROSE

(letting him in)

I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to

be so forward. I mean, if you're

waiting inside, then you feel

obligated to entertain me and keep

up the conversation just to be polite,

and really your head might be totally

elsewhere and then there's the chance

that you would really want to talk

and it's me who'd be busy, but in an

attempt not to be rude, I sit there

and listen to some story that you

don't really want to tell and I don't

really have time to hear. You know?

CHARLIE

I couldn't agree with you more.

ROSE

I think about a lot of things.

CHARLIE

Look, if you have work to do, you go

right ahead.

("ah, here's an angle")

I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd

love to see your work.

ROSE

Okay! What would you like me to do?

CHARLIE

No, I don't want to see you work. I

was talking about your work. Your

photographs. That one that I saw was

so, wonderful, and...

ROSE

Harriet's far more talented than I

am.

CHARLIE

Well, I'm sure it's so subjective

anyway and...

(out of patience)

Rose, show me your photos.

CHARLIE

Hey, these are some interesting photos

here. Very impressive. Nice shots of

Sauselito and... some good bondage

shots. A lot of people wouldn't think

to mix the two subjects, but they're

really a natural together.

(new thought)

Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any

pictures of Harriet by chance, would

you?

ROSE

(re: her cards)

Well, I don't think she'd wanna do

this sort of...

CHARLIE

No, no, not that. Just, in general

some photos. Any little snapshot

would do.

ROSE

I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates

being photographed.

HARRIET (O.S.)

Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out

in front?

ROSE

We're in here, Harriet.

HARRIET

(walking in)

What are you guys doing?

CHARLIE

(covering up)

Oh, nothing. Just looking through

some of Rose's work.

ROSE

...Charlie wanted a photo of you.

CHARLIE

And that. That too.

HARRIET

Why of me, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Well, sentimental reasons. Something

to remind me of you when we're not

together.

HARRIET

There, can you remember that?

CHARLIE

Okay, it's just, I was gonna give

one to my parents, too, and...

(getting nowhere)

Another time would be fine. It's

hardly a matter of life and death.

NEWS ANCHORMAN

(ON TV)

In the news tonight, regarding a

Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan,

who died last week, police are now

suspecting that Morris's partner,

Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered

him with an untraceable poison.

CHARLIE

Where you been?

HARRIET

Downstairs. I have a surprise for

you.

CHARLIE

Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty

minutes on the Stair Master before

bed.

CHARLIE

I'll do forty tomorrow.

HARRIET

(getting into bed)

I got something much healthier for

you than that.

CHARLIE

What is it?

HARRIET

It's a health shake. Eggs, malt,

cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I

mixed it up downstairs.

NEWS ANCHORMAN

(ON TV)

Poisoning has become the second

leading method of murder in recent

years, due to...

CHARLIE

Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and...

No...

HARRIET

You'll like it Charlie.

CHARLIE

No, really, thanks.

HARRIET

(putting it up to his

lips)

You won't try it. I spent twenty

minutes making it.

CHARLIE

(sniffing it)

Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take

some to the office tomorrow.

(running into bathroom)

I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right

back.

HARRIET

I'm gonna take a quick shower.

CHARLIE

Harriet, where did the shake go?

HARRIET

What do you care? I drank it.

(getting into shower)

You could have at least tried it.

You make me feel bad sometimes,

Charlie. I don't know why.

HARRIET

Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You

didn't want to drink my milkshake.

So what -- right?

NEWS ANCHORMAN

(ON TV)

Regarding the murder between the two

partners, we talked to Toxicologist

Dr. Show on the issue.

NEWS ANCHORMAN

(ON TV)

Doctor, is it possible that one could

be poisoned with no trace at all?

DOCTOR SHOW

(ON TV)

Certainly. There are plants that

grow very commonly in our own backyard

that could easily be fermented into

poison. Take for instance the...

CHARLIE

(getting nervous;

blocking out TV)

Harriet, why don't we shut the light

off.

NEWS ANCHORMAN

(ON TV)

Really? And how easy it that to do?

DOCTOR

(ON TV)

Scarily enough, quite simple. You

merely take the...

CHARLIE

(blocking out the TV

again)

Maybe we should turn the light back

on. Yeah that's better.

HARRIET

Charlie, what's the matter?

CHARLIE

Nothing.

HARRIET

Charlie...

CHARLIE

Well, it's just...

(re: the TV)

The TV. You can't even watch the

news these days without getting

depressed.

HARRIET

I know, Charlie. And it's not just

that. Look at the things people are

doing. Partners killing each other...

I mean, you hear a story like that,

and... who can you really trust these

days?

CHARLIE

What do you mean?

HARRIET

It's like, have you ever stood with

someone at the edge of a cliff, or

the edge of a subway platform, and

you think, just for a split second,

"What if I pushed him?"

CHARLIE

Well, I don't really take the subway

ever, so...

HARRIET

I'm just making a point of how many

times we trust people with our lives.

I mean, look at us. If you didn't

trust me, you would never be able to

fall asleep.

CHARLIE

Why do you say that?

HARRIET

Look at you, you're sleeping. Look

how vulnerable you are. I mean, I

could do anything at that point.

CHARLIE

(nervous)

What could you do?

HARRIET

(sweet and innocent)

Anything. You're lying on your side,

asleep, I could... stick a needle in

your ear.

CHARLIE

(grabbing his ear at

the thought)

Aahhh!

HARRIET

I'm just making a point of what a

good relationship we have. Goodnight,

sweetheart.

HARRIET

Well, good night.

CHARLIE

Good night.

CHARLIE

Well... good night.

HARRIET

(smiling)

Good night.

LADY

Thank you very much, young man. I've

gotta get all this stuff back to my

children.

CHARLIE

Your children?

LADY

When I say my children I mean my

cats. You see my children moved out

years ago, so all I've got is my

cats. I have over one hundred of

them.

CHARLIE

That's a lot of cats.

HARRIET (O.S.)

Charlie.

LADY

You see this red toy? That's for the

Captain, he's finicky. and this blue

one? That's for Marco Polo.

CHARLIE

Do you have a name for all of your

cats?

LADY

Oh, yes.

LADY

Let me see! There's Winston Churchill,

Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew

Carnegie...

CHARLIE

...He was Scottish.

LADY

Wasn't he Irish?

CHARLIE

Actually he was Scottish. Trust me,

I know these things.

LADY

Now that you say it, he was Scotch.

CHARLIE

Noooooo!

CHARLIE

(embarrassed)

Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots

are a people. Sorry, that just always

bugged me.

LADY

I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so

much to you.

CHARLIE

Hi, Harriet.

ASSISTANT

Yes, Sir, can I help you?

CHARLIE

I'd like to put in an announcement

of my parents forty-fifth wedding

anniversary.

ASSISTANT

Sure, it's $4.50 per word, and you've

got a choice of standard or bold.

CHARLIE

Bold, and here, I've written it out.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

Hi, Frank, busy week?

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2

I've only got two. It's dead around

here.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2

Well, I've got this one guy, a

tourist. He had a heart attack on a

cable car.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

Looks like he left his heart in San

Francisco.

MARRIAGE ASSISTANT

Hey, that's a real person you're

talking about.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

You're right, I'm sorry.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2

Well, there's this other guy Elliot,

Ralph. Plumber, disappeared four

months ago. Body found in a sewer.

(pause)

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

(despite himself)

I guess he took his work too

seriously, and his life went down

the drain.

CHARLIE

Did they mention anything about his

wife?

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

(crest fallen)

You're right, I feel bad. Point taken.

I'm mean, these are real people we're

talking about.

CHARLIE

No, I'm serious. Did he mention the

wife?

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

You made your point. I was wrong to

make a joke about a person's life.

CHARLIE

I really want to know about his wife.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

(crying and shouting)

O.K., you win. I'm a bad, bad person.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2

Frank take it easy.

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

No, he's right!

(pounding his head

with his fists)

I'm for shit, I'm one insensitive

asshole.

CHARLIE

Is there any mention of the wife? At

all?

OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

NO! THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE WIFE!

YOU HAPPY!?

HARRIET

Hi.

CHARLIE

I'm sorry.

(beat)

I think you're a terrific woman.

(beat)

I just don't think we should see

each other anymore.

HARRIET

Why not? And tell me the truth.

CHARLIE

The truth. Okay. The truth is...

CHARLIE

The truth is... I'm afraid that you

are...

(he can't)

You're going to laugh.

HARRIET

I don't think so.

CHARLIE

Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid

you're going to ki... leave me.

HARRIET

I'm going to "cleave you?" What does

that mean?

CHARLIE

Leave me. Not "cleave me." Reject

me. And so I decided to take matters

into my own hands and get it over

with by...

HARRIET

Rejecting me.

CHARLIE

(he feels awful)

Purely preventive... It's not anything

you've done.

HARRIET

I know that... So why are you leaving

me?

CHARLIE

(heartbroken)

Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be

in a relationship.

CHARLIE

I never wanted to hurt you.

HARRIET

You haven't. At least you left early

on.

(she's crying)

So, that's it, then. I've got a lot

of work to do.

(to Customer)

Now, where were we?

CHARLIE

(without lifting head)

Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I

need you, and two hours and four

minutes later you show up.

TONY

Sorry. I know it was irresponsible

to stay at the drug bust until it

was over, but... What happened?

CHARLIE

(slowly sitting up)

I'm gonna tell you, but when I do,

just say nothing. Don't judge me.

Just be my friend. Okay?

TONY

Fine. Okay.

CHARLIE

I broke up with Harriet.

TONY

You're an asshole.

CHARLIE

What's your point?

TONY

I'm sorry, I just... why?

CHARLIE

Tony, she's a killer. The...

everything.

TONY

But nothing's proven. The only thing

you're actually sure she did so far

is she's treated you like a King.

CHARLIE

I dunno, Tony, I just...

TONY

Besides, everyone has something going

on with them. I mean, you can't find

everything in one person. I mean,

she's bright, she's funny, she's

independent. So maybe, and it's really

just a maybe, she kills her husbands.

Marriage is give and take, Man. You

take the good with the bad.

SHERRI

Hey, Charlie.

CHARLIE

Hi. How're you doing.

(he glances at her

friend)

Good, huh?

SHERRI

I'm okay. This is Michael. Michael,

this is Charlie MacKenzie.

YOUNG GUY

I know. Why don't you two talk. I'm

going over there to buy some

magazines.

CHARLIE

That good looking and he can read!

SHERRI

I'm teaching him. I heard you have a

new girlfriend.

CHARLIE

We broke up. There were problems.

SHERRI

Problems?

CHARLIE

Difficulties.

SHERRI

Let me guess...

(smiles)

She's a murderer.

CHARLIE

Why did you just say that?

SHERRI

(laughs)

What else is left?

CHARLIE

Hello...

TONY

(through phone)

Not that it matters anymore, but I

thought you should know -- someone

just turned themselves in for the

murder of Ralph Elliot.

CHARLIE

Really? Did she confess to the other

murders?

TONY

Just the plumber so far, but she'll

come along.

(after a pause)

A little old lady from Pacific

Heights. Said he overcharged her on

a leaking sink.

CHARLIE

Really. Leaky sink, huh?

TONY

Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go.

I'll catch you later.

CHARLIE

(through door)

Harriet, it's me, Charlie.

HARRIET (O.S.)

Go away, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss

you, and I made a mistake... and if

you give me another chance I'll

change. I will. I promise. I'll get

help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll

be great. Therapy. Even twice a week.

I'll check with my insurance to see

if I'm covered, but forget that.

Harriet...

HARRIET

You really hurt me.

CHARLIE

I'll make it up to you, can we at

least talk.

HARRIET

Sure, talk.

ROSE (O.S.)

Hi, Charlie.

CHARLIE

AAAhhhhhh.

ROSE

(as she now proceeds

to be let in by

Harriet)

Trust your first instincts, Charlie.

You never do. It's your big mistake.

That and the haircut.

CHARLIE

I don't want to lose you.

HARRIET

You didn't lose me. You rejected me.

CHARLIE

I'm unrejecting you.

HARRIET

How do I know you won't reject me

again?

CHARLIE

I love you.

HARRIET

(after a long pause)

I love you. But you blew it, Charlie,

you blew it.

STEWARDESS

I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a

stewardess, and I have an early flight

out in the morning. Can you please

keep your music down?

HARRIET

I thought it was coming from here.

STEWARDESS

But someone keeps shouting your name

over and over.

CHARLIE

HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED

HARBINGER OF HAGGIS

BEAUTIFUL, BEMUSED BELLICOSE BUTCHER

UNTRUST-ING

UNKNOW-ING

UNLOV-ING

HE WANTS YOU BACK HE SCREAMS INTO

THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING

TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT

THE PASSION OF HIS HEART

I AM LONELY,

IT'S REALLY HARD

THIS POEM SUCKS

HARRIET

I've been there for almost a year. I

only planned on stay with her for a

few weeks, but she gets upset every

time I say I'm moving.

CHARLIE

You were close as kids?

HARRIET

I pretty much raised her. You know

the scene. Depressed mother...

withdrawn father.

(she remembers)

My dad was a photographer too.

CHARLIE

Really?

HARRIET

He hated it. Trudging off to those

weddings every Saturday night. Other

people's celebrations he called it.

He said sometimes they didn't even

offer him a glass of soda. He had a

small studio, and every year at

Christmas he'd take a picture of me

and Rose and put it in the window on

a little card that said "Seasons

Greetings." Awful pictures. It's

like... I could see his pain in my

face. Anyway, me and my sister worked

with our "childhood issues" in

different ways. She became a

photographer and I became phobic

about having my picture taken. It's

quite a family.

CHARLIE

Where are they now? Your parents?

HARRIET

Dead. Car accident.

ROSE (O.S.)

Harriet, its for you.

HARRIET

Charlie, I want you to meet a friend

of mine. Say hi to Ralph.

CHARLIE

(shocked)

Ralph?

CHARLIE

(delighted)

Oh, like Ralph, the lady carpenter

in Green Acres!

HARRIET

This is Charlie.

CHARLIE

I love you!

RALPH

It's nice to meet you.

CHARLIE

(ecstatic)

Nice? It's more than nice. It's great

to meet you. It's fantastic to meet

you. I just, I can't tell you how

glad I am. Ralph. Really. I am.

RALPH

Well, thank you, I've heard a lot of

nice things about you too, and...

CHARLIE

Oh, Ralphie, I love you.

HARRIET

I'll leave you guys alone. Have a

great time.

CHARLIE

I'm naked, aren't I?

HARRIET

Why, yes, you are.

CHARLIE

I should really get dressed now.

CHARLIE

(to Ralph)

Call me.

RALPH

(to Harriet; a little

confused)

Friendly guy.

CUT TO:

THE GROUP

Happy Anniversary to you...

(Etc.)

MAY

Okay, everyone come and get a piece

of cake and some milk.

CHARLIE

Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present

for you...

STUART

I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of

you.

(Stuart addresses the

group)

I just wanna propose a toast. To my

wife. Forty five years ago today May

and I got married. Some of you were

there, some of you weren't born yet,

some of you are now dead, but... We

both said, "I do" and we haven't

agreed on a single thing since. But,

I'm glad I married you May cause...

It could have been worse and

besides... I still love you.

CHARLIE

Harriet, I wanna talk to you.

HARRIET

Boy, you really made some impression

with Ralph. She can't get over you.

CHARLIE

(stalling; nervous)

I'm just so happy for you to have

friends like Ralph. What a great

friend to have.

HARRIET

Is everything all right, Charlie?

You're perspiring.

CHARLIE

Harriet... marry me.

HARRIET

What?

CHARLIE

I want to have a wedding. With you.

HARRIET

No.

CHARLIE

Please.

HARRIET

I don't know, Charlie. It's so good

like it is. Why don't we just live

together first?

CHARLIE

Because, I love you and I want you

to marry me and be with me for 45

years. I want you to have my children,

and I want to have your children. I

know that sounds like a lot of

children, and they might not all get

along, but... I'm finally ready to

trust you and to make a commitment.

Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my

wife.

STUART

I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing

us this party. I hope some day you

have the same great 45 years that

we've had.

HARRIET

Yes.

CHARLIE

You will?

HARRIET

Let's get married, Charlie.

MAY

(from across room)

Harriet, come here a minute. I want

you and Uncle Angus to play a song

together.

TONY

Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's

happening?

CHARLIE

Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two

little things...

(as Tony looks in)

That woman over there in the corner...

She's Harriet's friend, and her name

is Ralph.

TONY

No shit.

CHARLIE

And secondly... That woman over

there...

(Re: Harriet)

That's Harriet, and we're getting

married.

TONY

(excited)

Fantastic... What did I tell you.

She's a great girl. And the last

thing in the world she'd be is a

murderer.

HARRIET

(singing)

ONLY YOU...

CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT...

ONLY YOU...

CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT..."

SCOTTISH MINISTER

Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take

this woman to be your wife, through

thick and thin, for better or for

worse, please say: "I do"...

CHARLIE

I do...

SCOTTISH MINISTER

Now Harriet, if you will take this

man, through good times and bad, for

ever and ever, as your husband, please

say "I Do"...

HARRIET

(after a long pause;

finally:)

I do.

SCOTTISH MINISTER

Now Charlie... Kiss the beautiful

bride!

STUART

Let's get pissed.

STUART

You know Golden Gate park was designed

by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is

who MacClaren park was named after.

AUNTIE MOLLY

(proffering the Scotch)

Charlie, get this down your neck.

CHARLIE

Auntie Molly if I have another one

I'll end up underneath the table

with my kilt over my head.

TONY

Where's Harriet?

CHARLIE

I don't know. Oh, there she is.

CHARLIE

A little hungry, were you?

HARRIET

What are you...!

HARRIET

Sorry. The flash just...

STUART

(full volume; singing)

IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY...

AND YOU WANT MY BODY...

COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet.

CHARLIE

This is Teenage Fan Club. They're

from Scotland.

HARRIET

They're great.

CHARLIE

We'll have the whole lodge to

ourselves practically.

HARRIET

I can't wait, Charlie.

CHARLIE

I wish you could be me, so you could

know how great it feels to be with

you.

HARRIET

It sounds wonderful

CHARLIE

Do you think that would be a good

line for a poem?

HARRIET

Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark.

CHARLIE

Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft.

I have a habit of sabotaging

relationships, and there were a

million times during me and you that

I could have blown this, and I just

thank God that I didn't...

CAPTAIN

O.K., Spiletti, I got word from

upstairs that you been pokin' your

nose into that Ralph Elliot case.

TONY

Yes, Captain.

CAPTAIN

Don't "yes, Captain" me, Spiletti.

You're outta line. This is strictly

homicide.

TONY

Captain, I got this friend...

CAPTAIN

Friend? Yeah, we all got friends,

Spiletti. I'm warning you, Stay away

from this one. Back off, Italian

boy. You're getting too close to

this one.

TONY

Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust

me. What's the news.

CAPTAIN

I can't believe I'm doing this, but

that girl who confused to Ralph

Elliot's murder also confessed to

other murders.

TONY

I knew she would! I knew it!

CAPTAIN

Yeah, apparently she also confessed

to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar,

and Warren G. Harding. She's a nut,

Spiletti!

TONY

(getting up)

Oh, my god! I gotta go!

CAPTAIN

Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and

you'll be writing parking tickets

for the rest of your days.

TONY

I won't let you down, Captain.

TONY

That's much better Captain.

CAPTAIN

(nice again)

You think so? Well, thank you very

much.

HARRIET

You want anything?

CHARLIE

Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed

tomatoes and a Hershey Bar.

CHARLIE

If they don't have all that, I'll

just take the Hershey bar.

CHARLIE

What do you keep looking behind us

for?

(joking)

Is someone following you, or...?

HARRIET

They were. I think they're gone.

CHARLIE

(curious; pausing)

What do you mean, they were?

HARRIET

The gas station guy. I thought he

was chasing us for a while, but I

guess he stopped.

CHARLIE

The gas station guy? Why would the

gas station guy chase us.

HARRIET

I don't know, Charlie. I guess for

not paying.

CHARLIE

What do you mean not paying? You

didn't pay him for the gas.

HARRIET

I forgot to pay... I didn't want to

be away from you for any longer.

CHARLIE

So, you just left.

HARRIET

Yes. And you're an accomplice.

CHARLIE

I'm not sure I understand.

HARRIET

Look, Charlie, don't you get it?

We're a team.

CHARLIE

(going with it)

I can play that game. I'll get the

next gas station. Like Bonnie & Clyde.

ROSE

Oh, hi!

TONY

(practically hysterical)

What is it with the women in your

family?

ROSE

I was just doing a murder series in

honor of the wedding.

TONY

Hey, this is real blood.

ROSE

Yes, Harriet, give it to me. She's a

butcher.

(Tony reacts)

...She owns a butcher shop.

TONY

I need a picture of Harriet.

ROSE

Sorry. No can do.

TONY

You took a picture at the party. I

saw it.

ROSE

It didn't come out.

TONY

Look, Rose. I need a photo.

ROSE

The picture didn't come out.

(he waits)

It was unflattering. In made her

look ten pounds heavier.

(he waits)

She's my sister.

TONY

She's been implicated in a crime. I

need the photo to eliminate her as a

suspect.

ROSE

And if she's not innocent. If she's,

you know, "quirky?"

TONY

If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's

life.

HARRIET

It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so

beautiful.

VALET

Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just

beat the rainstorm. Two hours later

and the roads'd probably be closed.

CHARLIE

Great. If you could help us with the

luggage, we have these two in the

back seat and...

CHARLIE

Harriet? What are you doing honey?

DESK CLERK

Welcome, Sir. We have you with us

for four nights, Mr. MacKenzie. Dinner

reservations are at eight-thirty.

CHARLIE

Great. Sounds terrific.

DESK CLERK

Also, you might wanna prepare some

candles by the bed. We're expecting

the rainstorm to get even worse. We

might even lose the power tonight.

CHARLIE

Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm.

I can't think of anything more

romantic than the two of us trapped

in our room in the middle of a rain

storm.

(noticing her)

You okay, Harriet?

HARRIET

Just a little head-ache.

(to clerk)

Excuse me, is there a drug store in

the hotel? I want to get some aspirin.

DESK CLERK

Right beyond those trees, Ma'm.

Anything you need.

HARRIET

Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be

right back.

DESK CLERK

You think she's really got a head-

ache?

CHARLIE

What?

DESK CLERK

Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're

in the Oak Room.

CUT TO:

WALTER

That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright.

She had shorter hair in those days.

MASTER CHO

(into phone)

Mrs. Richter gain much weight since

then, but it's definitely her.

RANDY

That's his little lollipop, alright.

Boy he loved her. I'll tell you, she

was a lot of fun. Smart. A doll face

to boot.

TONY

Circuits are out from the storm.

TONY

(to Kathy)

Keep trying the hotel. Tell the chief

I just chartered a plane up to Oregon.

CAPTAIN

(points to his hair)

See that Spiletti -- A gray hair!

Every day, Spiletti, I find another

one. And that's all due to you. Get

out there, and catch me some bad

guys!

TONY

Not now, Captain.

CAPTAIN

(nice again)

Sorry.

CHARLIE

This is the best honeymoon I could

ever imagine, Harriet. If we had to

pack and go home right now, I'd still

think it was the greatest honeymoon

ever.

CHARLIE

Don't you agree, Harriet? Harriet?

CHARLIE

(wiping her tears)

What? What are you crying? What is

it?

HARRIET

It's nothing. It's just... I was

just thinking... We're married now.

And I always wanted to try and have

kids, and...

CHARLIE

So do I. Look, there's nothing more

I'd like to do than have, kids, or...

HARRIET

It's just, I get scared that certain

things will happen, or...

CHARLIE

What are you talking about? You're

gonna be a great Mom. I know you

will.

HARRIET

It's not that, Charlie.

CHARLIE

What then?

HARRIET

You're gonna laugh.

CHARLIE

Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna

laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's

hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.

HARRIET

If we have kids, Charlie, things

happen. Kids are healthy and fine,

and some aren't, and I don't know if

I could live with myself if I gave

birth to a child with webbed feet.

CHARLIE

Webbed feet?

HARRIET

You're laughing.

CHARLIE

No, I'm not laughing.

HARRIET

You think that's silly?

CHARLIE

No, no. That's a natural fear. I've

thought about that fear.

HARRIET

It really worries me, Charlie.

CHARLIE

(quite confused)

Well, look, they have, doctors -- I

assume -- that deal, only with, webbed

feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking

strictly hypothetically, should that

happen, we'll find one.

HARRIET

(kissing him; happy

now)

You're the greatest Charlie.

CHARLIE

(confused, to say the

least)

Thanks. We should get ready for

dinner.

DENNIS

Out your left side, you can see the

Sierra Nevada, which is the largest

mountain range west of the Rockies...

TONY

Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon.

Move.

CHARLIE

You almost ready? The first seating

is in five minutes.

HARRIET

(from other room)

I just wanna look good for you,

Charlie. That's all.

CHARLIE

I'm sure you look great. I'm sure

you look...

HARRIET

Do I look okay, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Yes. Well...

HARRIET

What's wrong?

CHARLIE

Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy

Faye Baker right now.

HARRIET

Oh, yeah.

DENNIS (V.O.)

As we prepare to land, we can see

off to our left Lake Shanony, which

is...

TONY (V.O.)

Just land. Don't worry about Lake

Shanony. I don't give a shit about

Lake Shanony.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

A toast to our new friends, Charlie

and Harriet...

BAND LEADER

...we're honored to be here for this

very special day in...

CONCIERGE

I'm sorry to interrupt, Sir. There's

a phone call for you from town.

(Charlie takes phone)

They say it's quite urgent.

CHARLIE

(curious)

Hello?

TONY

Charlie, you okay?

CHARLIE

Great. Couldn't be better.

TONY

Charlie, listen to me! It's her!

Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph

and the two other men!

CHARLIE

(talking softly)

Look, that's great -- it just so

happens though, that I met...

(louder than he had

hoped)

Ralph, and much to my delight, not

only is she alive, but she's female.

I thought I told you.

TONY

Rose had a picture. It checked out.

It's her, Charlie. She is the

murderer.

HARRIET

Charlie, your food is getting cold.

CHARLIE

So, what do I do?

TONY

I called the police. All the roads

are closed, but they're on their

way. In the mean time just...

CHARLIE

Hello?

(pressing receiver)

Hello?

HARRIET

What's a matter, Charlie?

CHARLIE

(to concierge)

The phone just went dead. I was on

the phone and it went dead.

CONCIERGE

That's quite common, sir. I'm sure

the lines'll be out in the whole

city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal,

Sir.

HARRIET

What happened, Charlie?

CHARLIE

Nothing... Nothing happened. Just

the lines are down. Phone lines.

BAND LEADER

(over microphone)

...so to these two young people, we

wish them a long and happy life

together and would like to play their

song. The Platters -- "Only You".

MR. LEVENSTEIN

How about the traditional Bride &

Groom dance?

OTHER COUPLE

Come on. It's a tradition.

MR. LEVENSTEIN

Excuse me. Could I cut in on your

dance?

CHARLIE

Of course. Sure...

CHARLIE

I need your help! You have to help

me! I've married a...!

HARRIET

(much too pleasant)

Hello, Charlie.

WAITER

Let's take 'em to their room.

CONCIERGE

Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of

these crowds for one night.

CHARLIE

My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner

yet.

HARRIET

Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having

a good time.

RENT-A-CAR GIRL

I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all

closed. We can't rent any cars this

evening.

TONY

You have to rent me something. I've

gotta get up there. My friend's in

danger...

CONCIERGE

Have a good night, you two.

CHARLIE

Come on in. Stay for a nightcap.

BELLBOY

No, you two wanna be alone. See you.

CHARLIE

(demanding)

Stay for a nightcap!

BELLBOY

Sir, I really don't think I should

CHARLIE

(shouting)

STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

CHARLIE

(shouting down the

hall after him)

STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

HARRIET

Don't go, Charlie.

TONY

(flashing his badge)

Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San

Francisco Police Department. I'm on

official business and I'm afraid I

have to commandeer your vehicle.

MAN

(unfazed)

No.

TONY

What do you mean no?!

MAN

I happen to know for a fact that you

don't have the power to commandeer

my vehicle.

TONY

This is true.

(pause)

Please can I commandeer your vehicle?

MAN

Well, where are you going?

TONY

To The Dry Creek Lodge.

MAN

I'll give you a lift.

TONY

Well, I don't want a lift, I really

want to commandeer the vehicle. Please

just let me commandeer the vehicle.

MAN

Why don't you just let me drive you

there? Really, I don't mind, it's on

my way.

(pause)

TONY

You're not going to bend on the

commandeering thing are you?

MAN

No.

TONY

Well, if we get stopped will you at

least let me say that I commandeered

the vehicle, but I let you drive?

MAN

I'm uncomfortable with that.

TONY

Please?

MAN

All right.

HARRIET

I heard you on the phone before,

Charlie. There's something I've got

to tell you.

CHARLIE

(frightened)

Harriet, I...

HARRIET

I've been married before.

CHARLIE

I already know.

HARRIET

About my husbands?

CHARLIE

Yes. And I was meaning to have a

word with you. We could get an

annulment.

HARRIET

(screams)

AAAhhhhhhh!

CHARLIE

Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be

so glad to see you.

CHARLIE

(going to the phone)

Maybe the phones are working again

by now.

CHARLIE

'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle

the commitment. I'm leaving you.'

Signed, 'Charlie.'

CHARLIE

What the hell is this? I didn't write

this?

CHARLIE

What the fuck?!

ROSE

Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet?

I warned you not to marry her, didn't

I? I warned all of them. But none of

them listened to me. They all went

ahead and married her. She's the

pretty one. Where's Harriet? What

have you done with my sister, Harriet?

CHARLIE

Nothing, Rose.

ROSE

If you've done something to my sister,

Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill

you.

HARRIET

(from the closet)

Where are you, Charlie? What's going

on?

MAN

Could you stop doing that please?

CHARLIE

Call the police!

CHARLIE

Call the police!

ROSE

(mostly to herself;

slurring most words)

Charlie, did you like your note? I

thought it was pretty accurate. I

did all the husbands' notes. I can

forge anyone's handwriting, I can

write in anyone's style. See, I'm an

artist. Harriet isn't an artist.

Sure she could get a husband, but

she could never have done this. And

you know what I'm most proud of?

CHARLIE

What's that, Rose?

ROSE

Harriet never knew. She thought they

all just left her. I protected her.

She's my sister.

TONY

(shouting)

Charlie!

HARRIET

(from closet)

Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet.

I'm in here.

HARRIET

Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie.

They're out on the ledge.

TONY

(not believing)

Get on the floor and put your hands

behind your back.

HARRIET

Sure, anything. You've got to save

Charlie.

HARRIET

Look! It's Charlie!

TONY

Nice try.

HARRIET

I swear to you... It was Charlie...

Look! Now there's Rose!

TONY

No you don't.

HARRIET

I beg you... Look! It is Rose.

TONY

Oh no, not again.

(he glances at the

window)

Aaaaah! Rose.

TONY

I hate to bother you on your

honeymoon, Charlie, but...

CHARLIE

Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you,

but I thought you were the killer,

but you were acting pretty strange?

HARRIET

I thought you were going to leave

me, like the others. Thank God they

were just murdered. I thought they

were always leaving me.

DISSOLVE INTO:

CHARLIE (V.O.)

My dad was right. You don't lose

your muse once you're married. Nothing

changed, except I gained a great

son, Stuart.

CHARLIE

MARRIED MAN

MOST MERRY

AND IN CONCLUSION

CROWD AND CHARLIE

THIS POEM SUCKS.

CHARLIE

Thank you very much.

BAY CITY ROLLERS

S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT

FADE OUT:

THE END
