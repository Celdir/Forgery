Final Script

November 11, 2009

GUIDO

You kill your film several times,

mostly by talking about it. A film is

a dream. You kill it writing it down,

you kill it with a camera; the film

might come to life for a moment or two

when your actors breathe life back

into it - but then it dies again,

buried in film cans. Mysteriously,

sometimes, in the editing room, a

miracle happens when you place one

image next to another so that when,

finally, an audience sits in the dark,

if you're lucky -- very lucky - and

sometimes I've been lucky - the dream

flickers back to life again. That's

why I'm secretive.

REPORTER (O.S.)

So what's your favorite pasta?

GUIDO

Finally, a serious question.

NINE

STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT

Good luck, Maestro.

p. 2

GUIDO (V.O.)

Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...

How do you begin? How do you begin

this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page

1... Page nothing...

p. 3

DANTE

(walking)

Guido! You're here.

GUIDO

Buongiorno, Dante.

DANTE

I've been looking for you all over the

place. The set's coming along. How

are you?

GUIDO

Bene, grazie, bene.

DANTE

Bene. My God, you look terrible,

better go to makeup, forget you've got

a press conference?

FAUSTO

(discreetly, to Dante)

He has no tie.

DANTE

Yes, makeup and wardrobe.

FAUSTO

(overlapping Dante)

Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good

morning, Signor Contini.

p. 4

DANTE

(interrupts)

He's counting costs, you know. The

Bank wants him here.

(to Fausto)

Don't speak to him, I speak to him.

FAUSTO

Okay, I have some questions for Signor

Contini.

GUIDO

We all have questions for Signor

Contini.

FAUSTO

Yes, but please, please, I think it's

customary for there to be an approved

script and budget before filming

commences...

GUIDO

Is he going to follow us?

FAUSTO

It's not my intention to be difficult.

Maestro, I am a huge admirer of

Maestro Contini's movies, your early

films are...everybody loves them

and... I consider it a great honour

for me to be here now... none the

less, I need a script and a budget.

p. 5

PIERPAOLO

Where do you want your messages?

GUIDO

On my desk.

PIERPAOLO

There's no room on your desk.

GUIDO

Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo

so.

PIERPAOLO

(waving them at him)

Some of these are urgent!

GUIDO

(to Pierpaolo)

Get me a cigarette.

JACONELLI

(confidentially)

We will never be ready to shoot in ten

days.

GUIDO

Jaconelli -

FAUSTO

(at the same time)

Not ready?!

GUIDO

(continues)

Ascolta me.

(MORE)

p. 6

GUIDO (CONT'D)

(he kisses Jaconelli on

the cheek)

Careful what you say. He's a spy from

the bank.

DANTE

He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.

BENITO

Dottore, Dottore. You have actors

waiting for you in your office.

Auditions all morning. You should see

what I've found. I found two sisters.

Look, they're right...

BENITO (CONT'D)

Dottore, this way...

BENITO (CONT'D)

Maestro!

DANTE

Not now. He's got the Press

Conference.

GUIDO

I need a cigarette.

p. 7

DANTE

He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.

GUIDO

I need a coffee and a cigarette.

LILLI

(unimpressed)

Answer a question, I'll give you a

coffee. Answer another question, I'll

give you a cigarette. And so on.

GUIDO

Actually and an aspirin.

DANTE

(in the background, on the

phone)

We're running late...

LILLI

(turns to Guido and lights

a cigarette)

Calm down. Directing a movie is a very

overrated job, we all know it. You

just have to say yes or no. What else

do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should

this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More

extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,

no, yes, no, yes, no - that's

directing.

GUIDO

That's right: that's directing. And it

doesn't seem to make a blind bit of

difference, finally, what the answer

is...

LILLI

So please, Guido, yes or no, do you

want any costumes in this film?

GUIDO

Yes.

p. 8

LILLI

You see - simple!

(handing him an espresso

fetched by her assistant,

ROBERTA)

Might I know what period the movie's

in?

GUIDO

Yes, yes.

(downs the espresso)

Soon.

LILLI

You know I don't allow producers in

here.

DANTE

Alright. Two minutes Guido.

LILLI

He's gone. Have you written a word of

the script?

GUIDO

No.

LILLI

Are you in a panic?

GUIDO

Yes.

LILLI

Is Luisa going with you to the Press

Conference?

GUIDO

No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.

LILLI

You need to shave.    You look terrible.

p. 9

GUIDO

(looking around,

desperate)

Why is there no fire escape in here?

What if somebody needed to escape? I

can't face these reporters. I have

nothing to say.

LILLI

You'll be fine. You're a world class

liar, darling, go out there and lie

for Italy, lie for Italia.

GUIDO

What the hell's wrong with me? I

can't sleep. I can't think. I can't

write. I can't breathe. My heart is

racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you

flowers, I know. I'll come to the

cemetery at the weekend. You should

have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I

could visit you every week. Don't

look at me like that.

MAMMA

(with kindly patience)

Oh, Guido, Guido.

p. 10

MAMMA

This is your Rome, Guido. The world

sees Rome the way you invented it.

Your films did that.

GUIDO

(buoyed by her

encouragement)

I miss you.

MAMMA

I miss you, too.

RADIO REPORTER

And we're just waiting for the arrival

of Contini...any moment now - Could

this film put the Maestro back on top?

RADIO REPORTER (CONT'D)

And here he is..!

p. 11

DANTE

Silenzio, per favore...Thank you,

thank you...

RADIO REPORTER

Dante, Guido Contini's long time

producer, is about to speak...

DANTE

I want to say a few words from my

heart. I am humbled and thrilled to

be able to announce that I am

producing Guido Contini's next film,

Italia, which will star once again

Contini's longtime inspiration, the

international film star, Claudia

Jenssen...

DANTE (CONT'D)

...we start shooting in ten days time

in Cinecitta. That makes it one week

from Monday.

(to Guido, handing over)

Thank you, Maestro, thank you very

much. This is our ninth film

together. Guido Contini.

GUIDO

Thanks for coming, everybody.

DINARDO

Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.

GUIDO

Yes.

DINARDO

Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new

film is called Italia... big title.

p. 12

GUIDO

Actually, it's my shortest title yet.

DINARDO

But hardly a modest one.

GUIDO

Films are not modest. They cost too

much, they take too long, and they

involve too many people. So they

should have grand titles.

DINARDO

And might you tell the press what the

film is about?

GUIDO

Why? I still don't know what my last

film was about.

LEOPARDI

(In a loud aside to

Dinardo)

That was the problem. Nobody else did.

GUIDO

Of course I can tell you what my film

is about...I can tell you the story, I

can tell you who I am going to cast,

the music I want to use, I can tell

you everything... but... I... won't.

I'm afraid that if I say anything, the

word might get out to the Press.

DANTE

Our next film will be exactly as it

sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit

of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a

woman, Italy as a dream.

LEOPARDI

Is this true?

GUIDO

It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to

see it.

p. 13

STEPHANIE

Signor Contini.

GUIDO

Stephanie.

STEPHANIE

Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable

women of America who your favorite

designer is this year?

GUIDO

I'm less interested in the wrapping

than what might be inside it.

REPORTER ONE

Signor Contini! You're a man of the

world, yes? Educated in Britain, a

home in Biarritz. With Italia is it

fair to say that you've come home for

good?

REPORTER TWO (O.S.)

(tries to interrupt)

What do you think of the New Wave in

the French Cinema?

GUIDO

For good?

REPORTER FOUR

It's been a long time since you made a

movie with your wife, do you plan on

casting her in this new film?

GUIDO

I told Luisa that when we got married

I would never again make love to my

leading lady.

REPORTER FOUR

But she hasn't worked at all since

working with you.

REPORTER FIVE

But why are you being so tight-lipped

about this film? It's a serious

question. What's the big deal?

p. 14

GUIDO

I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE.

GUIDO

You want me to be serious? In a Press

Conference?

GUIDO

I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE

GUIDO

I thought I was the clown in this

circus.

GUIDO

I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE

I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN

TERMS.

LEOPARDI

Signor Contini. Artists do their best

work before they're famous. Now

you're famous. Without wishing to be

negative - but your last two films,

they're not, they were...

GUIDO

Flops.

LEOPARDI

Your word. Flops.

p. 15

GUIDO

AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN

MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS

NEARING TEN.

LEOPARDI

I'm just asking if you're nervous?

You seem nervous...

GUIDO

Excuse me?

LEOPARDI

What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you

run out of things to say?

GUIDO

I CAN HARDLY STAY UP

AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP,

AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW

MORNING,

AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP

BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY?

AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE

HERE - ONLY ME

I WANT TO BE YOUNG.

AND I WANT TO BE OLD.

I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME

AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD.

I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN

ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, "GUIDO,

WHATEVER YOU PLEASE,

IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,

WE'LL ARRANGE IT."

THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT.

p. 16

STEPHANIE

I was wondering if you think there's a

limit to what you can show in a movie.

GUIDO

What would you like to see that I

haven't already shown you?

GUIDO

I AM LUSTING FOR MORE,

SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS?

I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR

IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS?

ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET:

THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET.

GUIDO (V.O.)

I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO

TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF.

I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A

DUET WITH MYSELF.

GUIDO

I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE

(SING ALONG WITH MYSELF IN A SONG)

TO BE THERE (WALKING DOWN A LANE NOW),

EVERYWHERE

(EVERYWHERE)

EVERYWHERE, THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN

TERMS

I WANT TO BE HERE

(WITH A COUNTER-)

HERE (MELODY IN THE)

HERE (TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU GUIDO)

GUIDO (GUIDO)

GUIDO (GUIDO)

GUIDO. ME (ME) ME!

I WANT TO BE PROUST...

p. 17

GUIDO (V.O.)

...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE.

I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED,

BUDDHA

BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD.

AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY

HEART -

IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT

DOESN'T START...

GUIDO

...I WANT TO BE YOUNG,

BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD.

WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND

FURY

THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD.

I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN

ON ITS KNEES

AND SAY, "GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE,

IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS,

WE'LL ARRANGE IT..."

GUIDO

SO ARRANGE IT!

WOMEN

ARRANGE IT!

GUIDO

THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT!

DE ROSSI

p. 20

GUIDO

(takes the key)

And I need to place a call.   To my

wife.

DE ROSSI

You can take the call at the lobby

phone over there.

GUIDO

Luisa, tesoro...

LUISA

There you are.

GUIDO

Is everybody mad at me?

LUISA

Well, I'm mad at you.   Where are you?

GUIDO

I had to escape from the Press

Conference.

LUISA

I heard. Dramatic.

GUIDO

Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.

LUISA

You're making a film. You make a

film, you get sick. It's what happens.

GUIDO

No, but this time I'm really sick.      I

can't breathe.

DE ROSSI

Your doctor is on his way.

GUIDO

(carefully)

This number - if a woman answers you

put it through to my room,

otherwise...

DE ROSSI

It's a wrong number.

GUIDO

What?

NURSE

Dottore.

DOCTOR RONDI

Si?

GUIDO

What is she whispering? Is it my

blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I

dying?

DOCTOR

(to the Nurse, not

answering Guido)

Check again.

p. 23

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Stress.    Exhaustion.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Your liver, your heart, your kidneys,

they're all very cross with you,

Signore.

CARLA

GUIDO...

DOCTOR

Open wide.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

But you've come to the right place.

There are a dozen mineral springs

around the town...

CARLA

GUIDO...

DOCTOR

...the Roman emperors came here for

the waters...

GUIDO

(into the phone)

Pronto.

p. 24

DE ROSSI (V.O.)

Signor Contini, it's the Signora.

CARLA

I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN

YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME

I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING

ABOUT, GUIDO...

GUIDO

(coming back quickly to

life)

It's a very an important call, Doctor.

I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private

call.

DOCTOR

As you wish.

CARLA

WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES?

I'M NOT!

MY DARLING,

WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES?

I'M NOT!

YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR

EAR,

SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR,

I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE...

AND HERE...

AND HERE...

p. 25

NURSE

Doctor... His pulse... it's racing.

DOCTOR

(to Guido)

Is something wrong?

GUIDO

What? Yes, yes. It's about my film.

It's from the Vatican. Go ahead,

Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm

listening.

CARLA

COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO.

I'VE GOT

A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU,

SO HOT

YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND

VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING-

KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW

PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY "OW,"

AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW,

GUIDO.

CARLA

WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED

AND OVERWORKED?

I WON'T! BAMBINO,

WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU

CAN GET FROM ME?

I DON'T!

BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR

NOW,

GUIDO,

CIAO.

(MORE)

p. 26

CARLA (CONT'D)

(spoken)

I love you, Guido.

CARLA

Guido!    Ciao!

GUIDO

(to himself, remembering

how much work she is)

Carla.

(and now to her, covering

his ambivalence)

Carla!

CARLA

I'm so happy to see you.

GUIDO

Carlissima.

CARLA

I missed you so much.

(they move off)

Are you happy I'm here?

GUIDO

Of course.

CARLA

But very happy? Or just a little

happy?

GUIDO

Very happy.

CARLA

What's wrong? You look very tired,

very tired.

p. 27

GUIDO

(avoiding this, looks at

her bags)

Carla, all those bags for the weekend?

CARLA

Yes, the Bellavista is a very

fashionable place. You know I stayed

there with my parents, during the war,

it was full of Germans.

GUIDO

Carla... I have to tell you... they

found out who I am at the hotel--

CARLA

No...

GUIDO

... yes, horrible, but obviously we

don't want to be followed by the

press, so I found the most charming

pensione for you, and it's right here.

It's charming.

CARLA

Here at the station?

GUIDO (O.S.)

Close the curtains, it's too light in

here.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Perfect.   Now, go into the corridor---

CARLA

What?

p. 28

GUIDO

Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back

in, and pretend you're in the wrong

room, and I'm a complete stranger--

CARLA

I love your games!

GUIDO

I'm here on business.

CARLA

Okay.

GUIDO

Go, go.   Wait. Your face.

CARLA

What about it?

GUIDO

Get your makeup.

CARLA

I had a nightmare last night. We were

in that little alley behind Piazza

Navona, where I bought you that scarf,

remember? The same one your wife

bought you--

GUIDO

(probably doesn't)

Don't move, Carla.

CARLA

When you wear it, I never know if it's

hers or mine.

GUIDO

(not really listening)

Uh-huh.

CARLA

So we were there, on the ground,

naked, kissing, and we didn't care,

and then my husband arrived and killed

us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi!

(MORE)

p. 29

CARLA (CONT'D)

He would never do that! He's so sweet.

He speaks Latin! He knows all the

Roman Emperors.

GUIDO

(still intent on his

makeup job)

Good for him.

CARLA

Perhaps there's a job for him in the

movie--

GUIDO

Why not?

CARLA

You could work well together.

GUIDO

Beautiful. When you come in I want

you to be my little savage.

CARLA

Yes.

GUIDO

(gesturing towards the

door)

Go, go.

CARLA

You think I am one of your actresses?

GUIDO

Hurry, please, Carla.

CARLA

Oh, Madonna!

GUIDO

I'll pretend to be asleep.

CARLA

What if I really found the wrong room?

Would you be jealous?

p. 30

GUIDO

Could you do such a thing?

CARLA

(coyly)

Hm! Who knows?

GUIDO

What happened?

CARLA

(still giggling)

It was the woman from the hotel. She

wanted to give me towels.

GUIDO

Come here.

CARLA

Okay.

GUIDO

What?

CARLA

You are a stranger, I don't know you.

GUIDO

Carla, just come here.

(indicating her sheet)

Be savage. Show me.

CARLA

Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.

GUIDO

Yes, you have. And I don't have the

faintest idea who you are.

p. 31

GUIDO (V.O.)

Page one, page one, page one...

The figure emerges from the darkness

like a goddess. She is Claudia, his

muse...

GUIDO (V.O.)

She takes the man's face and kisses

him...

GUIDO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...And with that gesture, he's

suddenly inspired to write

something... profound.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Mother of God, give me a sign.

p. 32

GUIDO

Excuse me, father...

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

(turns)

Buongiorno.

GUIDO

His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

(recognising Guido)

Signor Contini!

(starstruck)

I am a big fan.

GUIDO

I would very much like to speak to the

Cardinal. Do you think he might grant

me -

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Is Claudia Jenssen with you?

GUIDO

No.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Pity. His excellency is a big admirer

of Signorina Jenssen.

GUIDO

(explaining)

I'm in need of some guidance, some

pointers...

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Do you think you could find a signed

photograph of Signorina Jenssen?

p. 33

GUIDO

For His Excellency?

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Si.

GUIDO

I'm sure that would be possible...

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci,

Maestro.

DANTE

Guidino!

GUIDO

I'm not going to ask how you found me.

DANTE

Please - it's my job. A producer

needs to know where his director is at

all times...even to know the pensione

where his mistress is staying...

GUIDO

Oh God.

DANTE

I understand, Guido. Rome is

absolutely unbearable. The pressure.

It's no good.

GUIDO

Really?    You understand?

DANTE

Of course I understand.      Absolutely.

GUIDO

You're not going to drag me back?

DANTE

No. You're a genius and genius must be

served.

p. 34

GUIDO

Thank you, my old friend.

(Dante is guiding him)

Where are we going?

DANTE

You can't be in Rome. Okay.

(heading towards the

ballroom)

DANTE

Rome will come to you!

DANTE (CONT'D)

It's a fantastic place for you to

focus. Everyone is here to help the

movie. Everyone is here because they

love you, Guido.

JACONELLI

(explaining his designs)

Yes, with the flower and the glass and

the arches of the Roman Empire...

DANTE

Guido...you remember Donatella.

DONATELLA

Ciao.

GUIDO

(he doesn't, she's new)

Ciao.

DANTE

Donatella, you tested her.

DONATELLA

I was very nervous. He probably

doesn't remember. I was quite

nervous.

p. 35

GUIDO

(distracted, taking it all

in)

No, I remember you. You were, we all

enjoyed you, so to speak.

PIERPAOLO

Maestro...

PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)

Claudia's agent...

GUIDO

(listens to a stream of

invective)

Did she like the script?

(gestures for Pierpaolo to

light him a cigarette)

No no no no - impossibile - are you

telling me she didn't get the script?

(shouting at Pierpaolo)

Pierpaolo!

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Claudia didn't get the script! Send

her another one. For Chrissake. Send

her two!

PIERPAOLO

(playing along)

Yes, I'm sorry. Right now.

GUIDO

Cretino!

(back to Lombardo,

listens)

Yes, yes, that's what I say, people

just don't realise - she's an actress

as well as a star - I know Dante's

dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao.

DANTE

Lombardo...

p. 36

GUIDO

Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

GUIDO (CONT'D)

What are we doing here?

LILLI

I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.

LILLI (CONT'D)

It was Luisa's birthday yesterday.

GUIDO

What? No. Oh please God. No. I

spoke with her yesterday. She didn't

even mention it. Give me a cigarette.

LILLI

What's that?

GUIDO

What's that?

LILLI

It's for Claudia.

GUIDO

For which scene?

LILLI

Well I don't know which scene until

I`ve seen the script, but she always

likes something like this, or you do.

GUIDO

Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's

wrong. Italian women don't wear those

things.

p. 37

LILLI

Don't knock the Folies Bergere...

LILLI (CONT'D)

...it brings back happy memories.

That's where I learned my art. All

those sequins, all those feathers.

(Still working)

And, you're wrong, you put Claudia

in one of these for that nightclub

scene in Natura Morta.

GUIDO

Why did people love that film?

LILLI

Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every

time we have to start again.

GUIDO

I'm trying to find it.

LILLI

You won't find it with your head

jammed halfway up your ass.

GUIDO

Ashtray.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Thanks. You were saying - my head is

jammed up my ass.

LILLI

Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream

up something entertaining, Guido?

Something with music...with dancing...

God knows, we could use a little joie

de vivre around here...

p. 38

LILLI

(singing and performing in

a french accent)

LE CINEMA TODAY IS IN A CRISIS

DIRECTORS ARE SO EXISTENTIALISTES.

THE MOVIES ARE

NOT WORTH THEIR ENTRANCE PRICES

IF NO ONE SINGS A LOVE SONG

WHEN HE'S KISSED.

LOVE CANNOT BE LOVE WITHOUT "LE

SINGING,"

A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE

A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE

AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS

KNOWN.

LILLI (CONT'D)

FOLIES BERGERE-

WHAT A SHOWING OF COLOR, COSTUME, AND

DANCING!

NOT A MOMENT IN LIFE COULD BE MORE

ENTRANCING

THAN AN EVENING YOU SPEND

AUX FOLIES BERGERE.

FOLIES BERGERE,

NOT A SOUL IN THE WORLD COULD BE IN

DESPAIR

LILY                           SHOWGIRLS

LILLI (CONT'D)

Ah, Bon soir, bon soir, bon soir. Je

suis la vedette des Folies Bergere.

Vedette, it means 'star.'

LILLI (CONT'D)

Let me tell you. Last night I looked

down at this table in the chairs you

are sitting in now, and what did I

see? A priest! And next to him?

LILLI (CONT'D)

Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini?

What are you doing here at the Folies

Bergere? You naughty boy! You're

only nine years old! But I'm glad

you've come. Would you like to join

me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come,

come.

LILLI (CONT'D)

Feeling better? There's no room for

hopelessness in here, is there, Guido?

(to the audience)

We must explain something to our young

Guido. What do we want? Laughter!

What do we want? Love! What do we

want? Dreams! Let us not forget,

Guido, mon cher -- That's our

privilege - to entertain.

p. 41

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

The Cardinal is right this way.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

(CONT'D)

Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here.

CARDINAL

I like Charlie Chaplin.

GUIDO

Me too.

CARDINAL

A genius. What can I do for you?

GUIDO

Do you believe in God?

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Signor Contini, please.

CARDINAL

No, no, it's an honest question.    Yes,

I believe in God.

p. 42

GUIDO

So do I.

CARDINAL

Are you a Catholic?

GUIDO

Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as

I would like to be, not as much as you

would like me to be, I'm sure, but

certainly yes, I'm trying.

CARDINAL

Try harder.

GUIDO

Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your

Eminence, I am not happy. I'm

searching for something. I feel a

sense of misery, of despair and --

CARDINAL

(interrupting)

I saw your films. Not the flops, the

others, the good ones.

But you think people need to see so

much sex?   It's not necessary. We can

all imagine.

GUIDO

(laughing)

Excuse me - my films are what I

imagine.

CARDINAL

Then your imagination has no moral

training.

GUIDO

(nonplussed)

How do you train the imagination?

CARDINAL

The imagination is God's garden; don't

let the Devil play in it. Teach our

Italian women to be wives, not whores,

don't make us look at filth and

debauchery. Make us proud to be

Italian...

p. 43

YOUNG GUIDO

(not loud enough)

Saraghina.

(louder)

Saraghina.

BOYS

Saraghina!   Saraghina!

YOUNG GUIDO

(loudest)

Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!

p. 44

SARAGHINA

So, you little Italian devils, you

want to know about love? Saraghina

will tell you...and if you want to

make a woman happy, you rely on what

you were born with. Because it is in

your blood.

SARAGHINA

(sings)

BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.

TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO

STEAL A FIERY KISS.

BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.

WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME

BUT HOLD THIS!

p. 45

SARAGHINA

PLEASE BE GENTLE, SENTIMENTAL,

GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GIVE MY CHEEK A

PAT,

BUT BE DARING AND UNCARING.

WHEN YOU PINCH ME, TRY TO PINCH ME

WHERE THERE'S FAT.

SARAGHINA                       WHORES

SARAGHINA                       WHORES

p. 46

SARAGHINA                         WHORES

MAMMA

I am ashamed of you, Guido.

YOUNG GUIDO

But Mamma, what did I do.

PRINCIPAL

Bring him here. That savage is the

devil. God will punish you for your

sins, now and forever.

p. 47

CARLA

What? What?

GUIDO

I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

CARLA

Guido, don't die on me! Can you

imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill

him.

GUIDO

(finding her ridiculous)

If I die it would kill your husband?

CARLA

No, that's not what I meant, Guidino.

No. Where are you going?

GUIDO

I have to go to work. Carla, I can't

breathe.

CARLA

Let me come with you.

GUIDO

It's impossible.

CARLA

Why?

GUIDO

Because it's impossible. Please.

CARLA

But why is it impossible? Look at your

producer! He's married, he brings his

girlfriend to work and nobody cares.

Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why?

Why won't you let me near you?

GUIDO

For the very same reason you don't

want me to die on top of you. It's

not fair to your husband. It's not

fair to my wife.

p. 48

CARLA

See, you're playing with me. You're

twisting everything... Please let me

come with you.

GUIDO

No.

CARLA

I'll be here waiting for you with my

legs open.

GUIDO

Let's say there were ten sequences,

each one set in a different period,

but played by the same cast, a man and

a woman, a woman and a man...

(pours himself a glass of

wine)

Something light and hectic - like

Mozart would do it, like Figaro.

(to Lilli)

Like the circus...

DANTE

Claudia is going to be amazing.

BENITO

It sounds like a masterpiece.

FAUSTO

(hissing at Dante)

Dante, you see, he hasn't written a

word...

DANTE

(defending his director)

The screenplay is first of all a map.

That's a map.

p. 49

GUIDO

Let's try to dig for something else.

Maybe a group of people digging, with

shovels, in the desert.

LILLI

Guido.

GUIDO

Luisa!

- as Guido is protective of Luisa... holding her back

GUIDO (CONT'D)

I can't believe you came.

LUISA

The jungle drums said it was an

emergency.

GUIDO

The jungle drums exaggerated just a

tiny bit.

LUISA

Not entirely.

(with concern)

You haven't been sleeping.

GUIDO

I was dying, until just now.    Come.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

And don't think I forgot your

birthday. When you get home, the house

will be full of flowers...

LUISA

Am I already going home?

GUIDO

I hope not. Happy Birthday, my

darling.

p. 50

DANTE

(Seeing Luisa)

Here she is. At last.   Magnificent.

You know Donatella?

LUISA

I do now.

LUISA (CONT'D)

(to Lilli)

Thank you for calling.

LILLI

(confidentially)

You're saving the movie. Give him a

good idea, for God's sake.

GUIDO

Let's drink a toast to Luisa's

birthday.

LUISA

(negating it)

It was Monday.

DANTE

Happy Birthday!

LUISA

(not quite able to forgive

him)

Thank you.

GUIDO

Happy Birthday.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Maestro.

p. 51

GUIDO

(standing up to greet him,

then turning to Luisa)

Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling,

this is Don Mario. This is my wife,

Luisa.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

A pleasure, Signora.

LUISA

Sit down, won't you, Don Mario?

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Oh no.

LUISA

Please.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

I was telling your husband how much I

admire his movies. Publicly, you know

the Church condemns them - we have to -

but we all love them.

(To Guido)

Last year we did our own version of

your Il Vicolo at the Christmas

Party.

LILLI

That I would pay to see.

GUIDO

Luisa was in that film.

LILLI

She was the best thing in the movie.

GUIDO

It's true.   It was your first part.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh

my Lord!

LUISA

I was.

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

You can't stop being somebody.

LUISA

Can't you?

p. 52

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY

Well there's a good catholic wife for

you, Guido, that's what they do -

sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it

must be a very exciting life for

you...

LUISA

MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES

TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM

IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS

WHAT THEY SEEM-

HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC

THEME.

SOME MEN RUN BANKS

SOME RULE THE WORLD

SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD.

MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY

MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD.

MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES,

HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU

ALL

LIKE MICHELANGELO,

HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME

BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK

AND WHAT'S HIS HOME.

SOME MEN SELL STOCKS

SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS

SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD.

MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR,

MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD.

LUISA (CONT'D)

GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI:

NUMBER ONE GENIUS AND NUMBER ONE FAN.

(MORE)

p. 53

LUISA (CONT'D)

GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA CONTINI:

PASSIONATE WOMAN IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN

LONG AGO - MANY YEARS AGO.

ONCE WE TWO WERE-

GUIDO CONTINI, LUISA HIS LOVER:

ACTRESS WITH DREAMS AND A LIFE OF HER

OWN,

THEN WE HAD NO END OF WORLDS TO

DISCOVER,

SINGING TOGETHER ALL NIGHT ON THE

PHONE LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO...

CLAPPER LOADER (O.S.)

Signorina Acari, per favore. Provino

numero uno. Luisa Acari.

GUIDO (O.S.)

Your name, it's Italian.

LUISA

My father's Italian. My mother's

French.

GUIDO (O.S.)

What have you done before?

LUISA

(eyes twinkling)

Oh, I've waited...

GUIDO (O.S.)

Waited? For this?

LUISA

Waited tables.

(they both laugh)

And, of course, I studied theatre and

mime in Paris. But, mostly waited

tables.

p. 54

GUIDO

Thank you.

LUISA

For what?

GUIDO

Thank you. For what I'm looking at.

(walking away)

Keep running.

LUISA

LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO.

HOW HE NEEDS ME SO,

AND HE'LL BE THE LAST TO KNOW IT.

MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES.

TO MAKE THEM HE MAKES HIMSELF

OBSESSED.

HE WORKS FOR WEEKS ON END

WITHOUT A BIT OF REST-

NO OTHER WAY CAN HE ACHIEVE HIS LEVEL

BEST.

SOME MEN READ BOOKS,

SOME SHINE THEIR SHOES,

SOME RETIRE EARLY,

SOME STAY UP TO DREAM AND MUSE.

MY HUSBAND ONLY RARELY COMES TO BED -

MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES INSTEAD.

MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES...

LUISA

Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired.

p. 55

GUIDO

Luisa!

LUISA

I'm staggered by my own stupidity.    I

could vomit.

GUIDO

Luisa - will you please just tell me

what happened?

LUISA

You open your mouth and a lie comes

out.

GUIDO

What lie?

LUISA

Why am I surprised? - it's like

breathing to you.

CARLA

Guido.

CARLA

(trying to explain)

I was hungry. I'm tired of eating

alone in that room.

GUIDO

There are plenty of restaurants.

p. 56

CARLA

I wanted to see the hotel. I told you

I came here with my parents when I was

little. I didn't come to disturb you.

GUIDO

Well you certainly managed to.

CARLA

Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going

to be here!

GUIDO

I didn't know she was here.   She just

turned up.

CARLA

Well, she could have warned you.

GUIDO

The only privilege my wife has these

days is not having to warn me.

GUIDO O.S

A taxi, please, for the Signora.

DE ROSSI O.S.

Right away.

GUIDO

Carla, you have to wait outside.

CARLA

Will you wait with me?

GUIDO

I'm in the middle of a working dinner

with my colleagues.

CARLA

So why do I have to wait outside?

GUIDO

(shamed)

I'll find someone to escort you home.

p. 57

DE ROSSI

(carefully)

Signora, would you rather wait inside?

CARLA

I'm going to walk.   Please tell my

friend I had to leave.

GUIDO

Apparently she's staying in some

grotesque pensione next to the

station.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she

would be staying in the hotel,

wouldn't she? Think about it. I

didn't even know you were coming.

LUISA

(without opening her eyes)

Very plausible.

GUIDO

Because it's true.

LUISA

You told me it was finished.

GUIDO

It is. Look, she was worried about

me, she came to see if I was all right

- which yes, is stupid but not, as far

as I know, a crime, and hardly a

mortal sin.

p. 58

GUIDO (CONT'D)

(smiles, insecure)

What? What are you laughing about?

LUISA

Nothing. If you could see yourself.

(raising herself up

further)

I couldn't live with it - the

absurdity of being you, the effort of

having to hide and lie and cheat. It's

exhausting, no wonder you've got no

script, you're too busy inventing your

own life.

GUIDO

It's finished. It's finished.

(and he is exhausted)

If it wasn't before, it is now.

LUISA

(lying back on her bed)

Blah blah blah blah blah.

GUIDO

Vodka.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)

I'll have one of those. Due.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

Hi, Guido Contini. Stephanie, from

Vogue, remember me?

GUIDO

Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina

from Vogue.

STEPHANIE

So, coincidence. You being here.    And

me being here.

p. 59

GUIDO

(taking his glasses off)

Amazing. May I take a cigarette?

STEPHANIE

That was quite a performance. At the

Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

No, please, my treat.

GUIDO

(paying)

Please.

STEPHANIE

Grazie.

GUIDO

Prego.

STEPHANIE

(eyeing Guido)

I've seen all your movies.

GUIDO

(lights their cigarettes)

Really?

STEPHANIE

Like a million times. They're the only

movies that tell the truth about the

modern world.

GUIDO

And what truth is that?

STEPHANIE

(thinks)

Death of religion... Sexual

revolution...

GUIDO

I don't think religion is dead. And

what exactly is the sexual revolution?

STEPHANIE

That we can talk about later.

p. 60

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

You have such style. I always think

that. That's the other thing I love

about your movies.

GUIDO

(appalled)

Style.

STEPHANIE

Every frame is like a postcard.

GUIDO

(appalled)

Okay.

STEPHANIE

It's great: you care as much about the

suit as the man wearing it.

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

It's the Italian man in you: pays for

your drinks, undresses you with his

eyes...

GUIDO

I hate that man.

STEPHANIE

No! Style is the new content! It's

what my readers love. They want to

dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want

to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They

want to ride on a Vespa down the Via

Veneto. They want to live in an

Italian movie.

p. 61

STEPHANIE

I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE!

I LOVE THE PLAY OF LIGHT!

THE WAY CONTINI PUTS HIS IMAGE THROUGH

A PRISM.

STEPHANIE

I FEEL MY BODY CHILL

GIVES ME A SPECIAL THRILL

EACH TIME I SEE THAT GUIDO NEO-REALISM

STEPHANIE

I LOVE THE DARK AND HANDSOME GUYS

WITH THEIR SKINNY LITTLE TIES

DRESSIN' MOD, LOOKIN' OUTTA SIGHT!

I LOVE TO WATCH `EM AS THEY CRUISE

WITH THEIR POINTY LEATHER SHOES

WEARIN' SHADES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

NIGHT.

STEPHANIE

WHATEVER GUIDO DOES, IT MAKES ME SMILE

HE IS THE ESSENCE OF ITALIAN STYLE.

I LOVE THE GLAMOROUSLY LATIN WORLD

THAT ONLY GUIDO CAN PORTRAY!!!

CONTINI'S CINEMA ITALIANO!

I LOVE HIS CINEMA ITALIANO!

HE MAKES ME FEEL WITH CINEMA ITALIANO

p. 62

STEPHANIE (CONT'D)

MY LIFE IS REAL WITH CINEMA ITALIANO

HE IS THE KING OF CINEMA ITALIANO!

STEPHANIE

THOSE SCENES I LOVE TO SEE

FROM GUIDO'S "P" "O" "V"

THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WITH HIS UNIQUE

DIRECTOR'S VISION.

HIS ANGLES - WIDE AND TIGHT -

EACH MOMENT FEELS SO RIGHT...

DEFINES ITALIAN STYLE BY ONLY HIS

DECISION!

I LOVE THE SPEEDY LITTLE CARS

THE HIP COFFEE BARS

THE SLEEK WOMEN IN POSITANO...

GUIDO'S THE ULTIMATE UOMO ROMANO!

GUIDO

I love you Luisa.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Can we please try to be close again.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Pronto...

GUIDO

Is the doctor still with her?

MATRON

Yes, he's in there. He's waiting for

you. This way.

p. 65

CARLA

(distant)

You came.

GUIDO

(taking her hand)

I'm here.

DOCTOR RONDI

Signor Contini.

CARLA

Come back.

DOCTOR RONDI

She took five or six pills, enough to

make herself very sick. I understand

she's your mistress.

(Guido can't answer)

This is a sordid business. You movie

people, I suppose you don't consider

yourself bound by morality...

p. 66

MAMMA (O.S.)

Guido? Dove corri? Where are you

running to?

GUIDO

Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her

now.

MATRON

If you need us for anything, just

call, okay? Francesca, andiamo.

GUIDO

Grazie.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Carla, I should call your husband.

CARLA

No, he'll take me home.

GUIDO

What have you done to yourself?    I'm

not worth dying for, Carla.

CARLA

Don't be angry with me. Everything I

do, I just want you to love me.

CARLA (CONT'D)

When you're not here with me, I'm

still here. When you're in your life,

making your movies, dancing with your

wife - I'm still here.

GUIDO

Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk

about everything in the morning...

p. 67

CARLA

(Clutching at him)

Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

GUIDO

Rest, rest.   Cara mia...

MAMMA (O.S.)

...Caro,caro mio.

MAMMA (CONT'D)

GUARDA LA LUNA CHE BRILLA LASSU

HOW THE MOON GLOWS

AS IT SMILES OVER YOU

WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING

BLISSFULLY!

DREAMING, FLYING FREE!

CARLA

My husband thinks I'm clever, that's

the strange thing, because I'm not,

well you know that, I spend too much

time in my little brain thinking about

you, about where you are, what you are

doing, what you dream of.

MAMMA

OH, DREAM OF YOUR YOUTH

WHEN I'M STILL BY YOUR SIDE

DREAM OF YOUR MANHOOD,

PRAY I'M THERE TO GUIDE YOU

AND WHEN YOU GROW OLD

p. 68

MAMMA (CONT'D)

HOW MY LOVE STILL WILL SHINE

ALWAYS REMEMBER MY SON...

YOU WILL ALWAYS BE

MINE!

YES, MINE!

MAMMA (CONT'D)

GUIDO

SAI CHE TI VOGLIO BENE,

FIGLIOLO MIO,

GUIDO

DO YOU THINK THAT SO MANY

WILL LOVE YOU

AS I DO?

MAMMA (CONT'D)

GUARDA LA LUNA,

SHE HANGS IN THE SKY

BEAMING HER BLESSING

TO MAKE YOU AND I KNOW THAT

THIS ONE GOODNIGHT KISS

WILL KEEP ALL YOUR LIFE

PERFECT LIKE THIS.

GUIDO

Hold on to me, Mamma.   Don't let me

wake from this.

p. 69

MATRON

Excuse me.

LUIGI

Is she okay?

GUIDO

Yes.

LUIGI

I'd like to take her home.

GUIDO

Of course. I'm sorry.

(hapless)

She loves you, you know that, don't

you.

LUIGI

She's my wife.

GUIDO

Darling?

DANTE

We're going back to Rome.

GUIDO

(anxious)

Where's Luisa?

DANTE

Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with

you.

(different tone)

And quite frankly, so have I. You

drag a whole crew up here and then you

just disappear.

(MORE)

p. 70

DANTE (CONT'D)

I can't protect you anymore. And

Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start

today. Remember?

GUIDO

(sits)

I can't.

DANTE

You can't. You must. Don't sit down.

GUIDO

I need help.

DANTE

(still packing)

You've had help. You've seen the

doctors, you've seen the priests,

you've taken the cure.

GUIDO

I'm not cured.

DANTE

(decisive, no arguments)

That's enough! The movie calls, your

star has landed. Fausto - take his

things please.

DANTE (CONT'D)

(impatient,

at the door)

Guido! Andiamo!

GUIDO (O.S.)

I need more time.

DANTE (O.S.)

Forget the script. Claudia's here now.

She'll inspire you to do what you do

best, write with your camera.

p. 71

PIERPAOLO

Maestro, the screen tests are back

from the lab. Will you watch them now?

DANTE

Tonight.   We'll watch everything

tonight and make some decisions.

PIERPAOLO

Design meeting? Production meeting?

DANTE

Tonight.

PIERPAOLO

Tonight.

LILLI

Claudia says where are you? She's in

fine form. Feisty.

GUIDO

(knows what that means)

Okay.

LILLI

She asked if she could read my script

as she didn't have one. I said I

didn't quite have mine.

p. 72

LUISA

Pronto.

GUIDO

Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.

(she doesn't respond)

I want you to be with me in the

screening room tonight. I want to talk

to you about the casting, about the

script. Everything...

GUIDO

Otherwise I won't be able to start, I

won't know what I'm thinking...

PIERPAOLO

Maestro.

GUIDO

Are you there? Luisa?

LUISA

Go on.

GUIDO

I'm not asking you to let me come

home, I just want you to come to the

screen test tonight. Not for me, but

for the movie. You always have, you

always do.

p. 73

PIERPAOLO

Silence please. Se gira. And we are

rolling.

GUIDO

Could you turn to the right please,

Claudia.

CLAUDIA

Yes, I can turn to my right.

GUIDO

And can you turn to the left.

CLAUDIA

Yes, I can turn to my left.

GUIDO

Now just one slow turn for us.

CLAUDIA

(she turns around)

Okay, one slow turn.

GUIDO

Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut.

PIERPAOLO

We've got it. Next costume please.

p. 74

CLAUDIA

Has anybody got a script? Script

missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one

script, title Italia. Can't make a

film without it...

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)

So interesting to do hair and makeup

for a part when you don't know what

the part is.

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)

(shrugs off the coat)

No! I'm going back to my hotel now.

PIERPAOLO

(anxious)

But please, just a couple more

costumes, Claudia.

CLAUDIA

(to Guido)

I'm going back to my hotel now, my

darling, and when I there is a script,

I'll read it and then we'll take it

from there.

(calls over to Lilli)

I love the costumes, Lilli. They are

beautiful.

(back to the guys,

sweetly)

Ciao Bello.

GUIDO

That's fair.

DANTE

Claudia!

GUIDO

(to Dante)

That's fair.

DANTE

Fair?

GUIDO

I'll be back.

p. 75

DANTE

(calling to Guido)

You've got dailies, Guido.

GUIDO

I'll be right back.

DANTE

(shouting)

You've got meetings.

GUIDO

You look ravishing.

CLAUDIA

You're not seeing me, you're seeing

Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere

hidden underneath.

p. 76

GUIDO

It's good to see you.

CLAUDIA

I'm assuming that's code for there's

no script.

GUIDO

Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed

with the script?

GUIDO (CONT'D)

Talk to the people who love you in our

films, they're not interested in my

script! They're interested in the way

you turn your head, the way the camera

looks past you to the moon... the way

you smile a little as you cry, the way

you really do blush for the camera -

how?! -

(enough examples, sighs)

who even knows, but whatever else it

is, it's not my script.

CLAUDIA

So Lilli says I'm playing a million

different parts -

GUIDO

Not a million - you're the muses, the

incredible women who made Italy what

it is today, a country run by men -

who are themselves run by women,

whether they know it or not.

CLAUDIA

(teasing him)

So I'm the women behind the great men?

GUIDO

(trying hard to tell the

truth)

The great women...

(MORE)

p. 77

GUIDO (CONT'D)

In a way - yes - you have this man in

the story and he's, he wants to take

hold of everything, to devour

everything, he can't let anything go,

or, he doesn't want to, and he changes

direction every day, because he's

lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to

death...

CLAUDIA

(deflating)

And these muses - they fall in love

with the man?

GUIDO

Exactly!   They fall in love with him.

CLAUDIA

(decisive)

I'd rather be the man.

GUIDO

What?

CLAUDIA

I'd rather be the man.

CLAUDIA

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

ONE TIME I NEEDED YOU,

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

MAYBE IT LASTED A DAY,

MAYBE IT LASTED AN HOUR,

BUT SOMEHOW IT WILL NEVER END.

CLAUDIA

These women who come off their

pedestals for a kiss - they're just

fantasies.

GUIDO

No, you misunderstand...

p. 78

CLAUDIA

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU,

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

I WANT TO CRY.

SOMETHING INSIDE ME GOES WEAK,

SOMETHING INSIDE ME SURRENDERS,

AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY,

YOU'RE THE REASON WHY.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME.

YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME

LOOKING AT YOU.

IT SCARES ME SO THAT I CAN HARDLY

SPEAK.

GUIDO

She's his inspiration.

CLAUDIA

I can't keep playing that part.

GUIDO

I fall in love with you every time.

CLAUDIA

When there's a camera between us.

GUIDO

No.

CLAUDIA

It's not a real person, Guido.

(pointed)

And this man you describe - he doesn't

know how to love.

CLAUDIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU.

p. 79

GUIDO

There was a time once, we were on

location, some terrible hotel - and

you were in the room directly above me

and I could hear you walking about...

GUIDO (CONT'D)

...and, all through the night, I

wanted to rush up the stairs and

hammer on your door until you opened.

CLAUDIA

And why didn't you?

GUIDO

I don't know. I don't know.

CLAUDIA

SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE,

SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU.

HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU,

ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL.

IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,

YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE.

CLAUDIA

Maybe you should have knocked, maybe

you should have knocked me right off

the pedestal. I can't do this

anymore.

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)

This is me.   And you have a wife who

loves you.

CLAUDIA (CONT'D)

I'll miss you. Wrong girl.

p. 80

DANTE

(to Lilli)

Great work, Lilli... Wonderful

costume...

LILLI

Thank you.

DANTE

...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.

BENITO

She has a beautiful profile.

DANTE

Two great profiles.

FAUSTO

She's a goddess.

DANTE

And the back isn't too bad.

FAUSTO

She came directly from Venus.

Beautiful.

DANTE

Fantastic. Guido?     Really nice.

Who's next?

BENITO

Actresses.

DANTE

Okay.   Let's see the actresses.

p. 81

BENITO

If we like her, we have to call her

agent right away. Everybody wants her

right now.

DANTE

Well they can keep her.

BENITO

She's a very funny actress.

DANTE

She's peculiar. You don't like her

Guido?

DANTE (CONT'D)

She's nice.

FAUSTO

She's very natural.

DANTE

Even better. She's a bit nervous

here. What do you say, Guido?

Donatella's nice?

p. 82

DANTE (CONT'D)

Who's this? I thought we were looking

for a blonde.

FAUSTO

She's too tall.

DANTE

Very tall.

BENITO

She's very beautiful.

DANTE

It's not the point.     Guido wants the

blonde.

FAUSTO

She's not bad, but -

DANTE

Shh.

FAUSTO

She's beautiful.

DANTE

She's too beautiful.      For my tastes.

DANTE (CONT'D)

I don't know what Guido thinks. I

think we are happy with Donatella.

Donatella's better, isn't she?

GUIDO

Sure.

DANTE

(delighted, jumps up)

Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we

have to go home. We have a very, very

busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much

everybody. Thank you. Okay, well

done.

GUIDO

It meant so much to us all.    That you

came.

(MORE)

p. 83

GUIDO (CONT'D)

(nothing from Luisa)

What did you think? Did you like

anybody or -?

(nothing)

Luisa?

LUISA

YOU WANT MY LOVE?

TAKE IT ALL

YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF?

TAKE IT ALL

COME ON NOW

SHOW ME HOW

YOU TAKE IT ALL...

LUISA

Thank you.

GUIDO

(encouraged)

What for?

LUISA

Thank you for reminding me I'm not

special. You don't even see what you

do, do you? Even the moments I think

are ours, it's just you working to get

what you want.

p. 84

LUISA

YOU WANT MY GLOVE?

ARE YOU ENTHRALLED?

YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY

AND WATCH IT FALL?

OH WE KNOW

IT'S YOUR SHOW

SO TAKE IT ALL

GUIDO

(dawning on him)

What are you talking about?

GUIDO (CONT'D)

The screen test? You have to

understand, it's nothing, this is what

I do, I direct. That's my job.

LUISA

And this is our life. You think to

create is to forgive yourself in

public. Fine. But don't think I can

forgive you in private, because I

can't ever.

LUISA

SO GO AHEAD

TAKE IT ALL

YOU WANT MY SOUL?

TAKE IT ALL!

IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

IF I'M TO LIVE.

BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE,

THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE...

p. 85

LUISA (CONT'D)

I WATCH YOU RISE!

I WATCH YOU FALL!

WHILE I AM STANDING

WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE WALL

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN

TO FINALLY LEARN

YOU HAD THE WORLD

YOU HAD YOUR FLING

YOU WANTED MORE THAN EVERYTHING

YOU GOT YOUR WISH

YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE

NOW TAKE IT RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR THIGHS

YOU GRABBED FOR EVERYTHING MY FRIEND

BUT DON'T YOU SEE

THAT IN THE END

THERE WILL BE

NOTHING!

LUISA

You're just an appetite, and if you

stopped being greedy you'd die. You

take everything, and I'm empty.

LUISA (CONT'D)

You know, I'm glad I came. I can see

now... it's hopeless...

GUIDO

What have I done? What have I done,

Luisa?

GUIDO

I CAN'T   MAKE THIS MOVIE,

THERE'S   NO WAY THAT I'LL BEGIN IT.

I CAN'T   BEAR TO SEE THE CAMERAS ROLL.

PROBLEM   IS THE SUBJECT,

THERE'S   NO PLEASANT WAY TO TREAT IT.

(MORE)

p. 86

GUIDO (CONT'D)

THE PROBLEM IS THE AUTHOR'S LOST

CONTROL.

HOW I WISH IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SO,

BUT WE CUT THE LOSSES-STARTING NOW

STRIKE THE SET AND KEEP IT FOR SOME

SIDESHOW.

TELL THE CAST AND CREW THAT THEY CAN

ALL GO.

GUIDO (CONT'D)

FIND ANOTHER GENIUS,

I CAN'T BE ONE OR BECOME ONE.

I CAN'T EVEN TELL HOW I'D BEGIN.

HELP LUISA, HELP ME, HELP ME MAMMA,

HELP ME SOMEONE.

HERE'S A PLACE WHERE I HAVE NEVER

BEEN.

GUIDO OUT IN SPACE

WITH NO DIRECTION,

GUIDO AT A LOSS FOR WHAT TO SAY,

GUIDO WITH NO INTERVENING ACTORS,

GUIDO AT THE MERCY OF DETRACTORS,

GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT...

NOTHING HOLDS TOGETHER

NOTHING MAKES A BIT OF SENSE NOW

IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP OR UNDERSTAND

HOW CAN I GO ON TO WATCH THE WHOLE OF

MY EXISTENCE

END UP BEING NOTHING THAT I PLANNED

HAVE I LOST MYSELF AND ALL I WISHED

FOR

HAS MY LIFE BECOME A MINDLESS GAME

GUIDO, I CAN'T STAND THE NAME OF GUIDO

GUIDO, FOR GODSAKE,

WHO IS THIS GUIDO?

GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT

GUIDO...

GUIDO (CONT'D)

(honest)

I destroyed everything, Mamma...

GUIDO (CONT'D)

...I destroyed everything, I just...

you make one wrong turn and then

because of that, after it all the

turns are wrong. And you are so far

from where you wanted to be...and

you're lost and then you're lost.

p. 87

MAMMA

No one can help you find your way.

(a beat)

It's up to you, Guido. Up to you.

Nobody else.

GUIDO (O.S.)

Old friends, I have to come clean with

you.

GUIDO

There is no movie. I can't pretend

anymore. We have to stop.

(nothing more to say)

I'm sorry.

p. 88

LILLI

I'm glad she's acting again. I made

her costumes for the play. She's

funny.

GUIDO

She seemed so happy. I didn't want to

interfere... Is she with anybody?

LILLI

Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her

mother. I don't know. I expect so.

Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me

you're going to let me cut your hair

and get rid of that awful beard.

p. 89

GUIDO

I like to get about without everybody

pointing at me.

LILLI

And where are you getting about?

GUIDO

Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be

able to walk.

LILLI

Are you seeing anybody?

GUIDO

No, no. Nobody.

LILLI

(teasing)

Well, it sounds exciting. Walking

around and not seeing anyone, growing

a beard.   I might come up here and

join you.

GUIDO

Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -

LILLI

- I know.

GUIDO

I just miss her. I should have IDIOT

tattooed on my forehead.

LILLI

Luisa certainly thinks so.

GUIDO

(grasping at this)

Does she? Did she really say that?

LILLI

Stop! I'm not going to act as a

postman between you both. Come back

to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.

GUIDO

No. Never. I've spent this time

trying to learn something, Lilli, to

not be the person who forgets about

everybody else, the person who never

grew up.

p. 90

LILLI

You're such a dope, aren't you?

Making movies wasn't your problem. You

were your problem.   Don't stop being

a child. You'll never make another

movie! Nobody wants that...

especially Luisa.

LILLI (CONT'D)

Guido - there probably isn't a single

person passing by who hasn't been

touched in some way by one of your

movies. That's your gift. That's what

you've been given. Use it. Just use it

with some grace. For Chrissake.

GUIDO

(doubtful)

The only movie I could make now would

be... I don't know... would be about a

man trying to win back his wife.

LILLI

Sounds perfect.

(after a beat)

The costumes might not be so bad too.

YOUNG GUIDO

We're ready to begin!

p. 91

GUIDO

I can't remember how you do this.

PIERPAOLO

You'll remember.

GUIDO

I don't want to say too much. The

first way that we kill our film is by

talking about it. But this scene is

about reconciliation. And within the

scene I would like you to try and find

your way to begin that journey back

towards each other.

YOUNG GUIDO

Presto! Presto! Take your places!

Andiamo! Andiamo!

p. 92

GUIDO

(Continuing to speak to

his actors)

Maybe it's the most important building

block that we have to begin again...

We start from the beginning each time

and I feel today as if I'm starting

from the beginning. We'll just keep

asking each other questions, and don't

look to me for the answers, okay?

PIERPAOLO

Maestro, should I call final checks?

GUIDO

Yes.

PIERPAOLO

Makeup, please! Final checks!

PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)

Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence

please.

(to camera)

Gyriamo. E alora motore!

p. 93

CLAPPER LOADER

Slate.

GUIDO

ACTION.
