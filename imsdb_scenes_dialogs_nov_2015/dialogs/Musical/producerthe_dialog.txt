MAX BIALYSTOCK - THEATRICAL PRODUCER

BIALYSTOCK

Don't forget the checkee.  Can't

produce playees without checkees.

LITTLE OLD LADY

You can count on me-o, you dirty

young man.

2.

BIALYSTOCK

(Voice Over)

"Hold me, touch me', 'hold me,

touch me', 'hold me, touch me',

where is 'hold me, touch me'?  Ahhh

... here we are.  'Hold me, touch

me.'"

BIALYSTOCK

(leering)

Darling!

3.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(passionately)

Hold me, touch me.

BIALYSTOCK

Devil woman.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Finder's keepers.

BIALYSTOCK

Here I come, ready or not.

LITTLE OLD LADY

What's the matter?  Papa no want to

play with baby?

BIALYSTOCK

Ohhhhhh.

4.

BIALYSTOCK

Come to Papa.  Come to Papa do.

LITTLE OLD LADY

To the victor go the spoils.

BIALYSTOCK

I'm gonna get you.

BIALYSTOCK

Ohhhhhhhh.

5.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Meeow.  Meeow.  I wonder where Old

Tom is tonight?  Meeow.

BIALYSTOCK

Rowrrr.

BIALYSTOCK

Aieeeeyiyiyiyiyi,

LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, Bialy, Bialy, darling, did I

hurt you?

6.

BIALYSTOCK

My hand.  My hand.  I can't turn my

hand.

(he turns his hand)

LITTLE OLD LADY

(taking his hand)

Don't worry.  I'll kiss it and make

it well.

(she smothers his

hand with kissers)

BIALYSTOCK

(trying to rescue his hand)

Enough.  It's better.  Please,

Lambchop, it's better.  Stop.

You're hurting it again.

BLOOM

(his forward motion

arrested by the

unbelievable scene)

How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse

me ... I mean ...

BIALYSTOCK

You mean ooops, don't you?  Say

ooops and get out.

BLOOM

I'll wait in the hall ...

BIALYSTOCK

Oooooooops!

BLOOM

(backing out of door)

Ooooooops.

LITTLE OLD LADY

I can't abide a peeping Tom.

There's one in the apartment just

opposite my bedroom window.  I

swear that man NEVER takes his

field glasses off me for a minute.

7.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Feeling better?

LITTLE OLD LADY

Good.  Let's fool around.  Now,

I'll be the innocent little milk

maid and you'll be the naughty

stable boy.

(she goes into her act)

Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll

never reach the house.  Help.  Will

someone help me?

BIALYSTOCK

(stopping her)

Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today.

I have too many appointments.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(crushed)

We can't play today?

BIALYSTOCK

Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play

Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa

and the chauffeur.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, the best one.

BIALYSTOCK

(trying to steer her

towards the door)

Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(she sits on the sofa)

Oh, Bialy, please, just a little.

Just a little.

BIALYSTOCK

(harassed)

All right.  All right.

8.

LITTLE OLD LADY

So, the Count hired you this

morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road

... Watch the road.

BIALYSTOCK

I can't take my eyes off you.  How

can I drive when you drive me mad.

Mad.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(she squeals with delight)

Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.

BIALYSTOCK

(upright)

Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the

rest on Thursday.

(he reaches down and

helps her off the couch)

That's a good girl.

(leading her to the door)

It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK

Until Thursday, then, you bawdy

wench.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

BIALYSTOCK

Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.

LITTLE OLD LADY

And we'll finish playing the

Contessa and Rudolfo.

9.

BIALYSTOCK

Good.  Yes.  Thursday.

LITTLE OLD LADY

And after that we'll play the

Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia

... And I'll play Lucretia.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever

come?

BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

Like clockwork.

LITTLE OLD LADY

I shall count the minutes.

BIALYSTOCK

Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!

(calling after her)

Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ...

Lucretia, Lucretia!

LITTLE OLD LADY

(eagerly)

Yes???

BIALYSTOCK

Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give

me the check.  Can't produce a play

without money, ha, ha, ha.

10.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(opening her handbag

and reaching inside)

Of course, the check, I had it with

me all the time.

LITTLE OLD LADY

I don't know what's happening to me.

I must be getting old.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Is it all right?  I made it out to

cash.  You didn't tell me the name

of the play.

BIALYSTOCK

Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good.

Bye.  Bye.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall

count the minutes.

LITTLE OLD LADY

(descending)

Ta.  Ta.

BIALYSTOCK

(waving check at her)

Ta.  Ta.

THE MAN (LANDLORD)

He who signs a lease, must pay rent.

LANDLORD

That's the law.

BIALYSTOCK

Murderer!  Thief!  How can you take

the last penny out of a man's pocket?

11.

LANDLORD

(turns back, shrugs)

I have to ... I'm a landlord!

BIALYSTOCK

(shouting to heaven)

Oh Lord, hear my plea.  Destroy him.

He maketh a blight on the land.

LANDLORD

(to the Lord)

Don't pay attention.  He's crazy.

BIALYSTOCK

(biting his knuckle)

Nnnnn.  That hurt.

(he sighs)

I'll have to make another call.

BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom, quietly)

Have you been there all this time?

BIALYSTOCK

And did you see and hear everything?

BIALYSTOCK

Then what do you have to say for

yourself?

BLOOM

Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?

BIALYSTOCK

(shouts)

Who are you?  What do you want?

Why are you loitering in my hallway?

Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you

speak?

BLOOM

Scared.  Can't talk.

12.

BIALYSTOCK

All right.  Get a hold of yourself.

Take a deep breath, let it out

slowly and tell me who you are.

BLOOM

(breathes deeply.

Words tumble from his

mouth as he exhales)

I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant,

I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was

sent here to do your books and I'm

terribly sorry I caught you with

the old lady.

(he has run out of breath)

BIALYSTOCK

"Caught you with the old lady."

Come in, Mr. Tact.

BIALYSTOCK

So you're an accountant, eh?

BLOOM

(timidly)

Yes sir.

BIALYSTOCK

Then account for yourself!  Do you

believe in God?  Do you believe in

gold?  Why are you looking up old

lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert,

eh?

BLOOM

Sir, I ...

BIALYSTOCK

Never mind.  Never mind.  Do the

books.  They're in that desk over

there.  Top drawer.

13.

BIALYSTOCK

How dare you condemn me without

knowing all the facts.

BLOOM

But sir, I'm not condem ...

BIALYSTOCK

Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical

conversation.

(to himself)

How humiliating.  Max Bialystock.

Max Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK

You know who I used to be?  Max

Bialystock!  The King of Broadway!

Six shows running at once.  Lunch

at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar

suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now!

I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

BIALYSTOCK

I used to have thousands of

investors begging, pleading, to put

their money into a Max Bialystock

production.

BIALYSTOCK

Look at my investors now.  Voila!

(gestures at pictures)

Hundreds of little old ladies

stopping off at Max Bialystock's

office to grab a last thrill on the

way to the cemetery.

14.

BIALYSTOCK

You have exactly ten seconds to

change that disgusting look of pity

into one of enormous respect.  One

... Two ...

BIALYSTOCK

Do the books!  Do the books!

BLOOM

(sighing)

Yes, sir.  Thank you.

BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

Window's so filthy, can't tell if

it's day or night out there.

BIALYSTOCK

(voice over as camera

follows Rolls)

Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce.

That's it baby, when you got it,

flaunt it.

BLOOM

(off screen)

Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ...

harrumph ...

15.

BIALYSTOCK

I assume you are making those

cartoon noises to attract my

attention.  Am I correct in my

assumption, you fish-faced enemy of

the people?

BIALYSTOCK

I have hurt your feelings.

BIALYSTOCK

Good, what is it?

BLOOM

Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?

BIALYSTOCK

(looking at his watch)

Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.

BLOOM

Well, sir, it seems ...

BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

You have forty-eight seconds left.

Hurry.  Hurry.

BLOOM

(speedily)

In looking at your books, I've

discovered that ...

BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,

you're using up your time.

BLOOM

Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function

under these conditions.

BLOOM

You're making me extremely nervous.

16.

BIALYSTOCK

What is that?  A handkerchief?

BLOOM

It's nothing ... nothing.

BIALYSTOCK

If it's nothing, why can't I see it?

BLOOM

(shrieking in panic)

My blanket.  Give me my blue blanket.

BIALYSTOCK

Here, don't panic.

BLOOM

(clutching his blanket)

I'm sorry ... I don't like people

touching my blue blanket.  It's not

important.  It's a minor compulsion.

I can deal with it if I want to.

It's just that I've had it ever

since I was a baby and ... and ...

I find it very comforting.

BIALYSTOCK

(to himself)

They come here.  They all come here.

How do they find me?

BLOOM

(recovering his dignity)

Mr. Bialystock ...

BIALYSTOCK

Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do

for you?

17.

BLOOM

This is hardly a time for levity.

I've discovered a serious error

here in the accounts of your last

play.

BIALYSTOCK

Where?  What?

BLOOM

According to the backer's list you

raised $60,000.  But the show you

produced only cost fifty-eight

thousand.  There's two thousand

dollars unaccounted for.

BIALYSTOCK

I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?

The show was a flop.  What

difference does it make?

BLOOM

It makes a great deal of difference.

That's fraud.  If they found out,

you could go to prison.

BIALYSTOCK

Why should they find out?  It's

only two thousand dollars,  Bloom,

do me a favor, move a few decimal

points around.  You can do it.

You're an accountant.  The word

'count' is part of your title.

BLOOM

(aghast)

But that's cheating!

BIALYSTOCK

It's not cheating ... It's charity.

Bloom, look at me ... look at me!

I'm drowning.  Other men sail

through life.  Bialystock has

struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going

under.  I am being sunk by a

society that demands success, when

all I can offer is failure.  Bloom,

I'm reaching out to you.  Don't

send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

18.

BLOOM

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

BIALYSTOCK

(faintly)

Help!

BLOOM

All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

BIALYSTOCK

Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could

con you.

BLOOM

Oh, it's all right ... wha?

BIALYSTOCK

Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.

BLOOM

(pouring over the accounts)

Now let's see, two thousand dollars.

That isn't much.  I'm sure I can

hide it somewhere.  After all, the

department of internal revenue

isn't interested in a show that

flopped.

BIALYSTOCK

Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You

figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm

gonna take a little nap.

(crossing to couch)

Wake me if there's a fire.

BLOOM

Now let's see, if we add these

figures, we get ...

19.

BLOOM

(musing to himself)

Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's

absolutely amazing.  But under the

right circumstances, a producer

could make more money with a flop

than he could with a hit.

BLOOM

Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible.

If he were certain the show would

fail, a man could make a fortune.

BIALYSTOCK

Yes???

BLOOM

(at a loss)

Yes, what?

BIALYSTOCK

What you were saying.  Keep talking.

BLOOM

What was I saying?

BIALYSTOCK

You were saying that under the

right circumstances, a producer

could make more money with a flop

than he could with a hit.

BLOOM

(smiling)

Yes, it's quite possible.

BIALYSTOCK

You keep saying that, but you don't

tell me how.  How could a producer

make more money with a flop than

with a hit?

20.

BLOOM

It's simply a matter of creative

accounting.  Let us assume, just

for the moment, that you are a

dishonest man.

BIALYSTOCK

Assume away!

BLOOM

Well, it's very easy.  You simply

raise more money than you really

need.

BIALYSTOCK

What do you mean?

BLOOM

You've done it yourself, only you

did it on a very small scale.

BIALYSTOCK

What did I do?

BLOOM

You raised two thousand more than

you needed to produce your last play.

BIALYSTOCK

So what?  What did it get me?  I'm

wearing a cardboard belt.

BLOOM

Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made

your error.  You didn't go all the

way.  You see, if you were really a

bold criminal, you could have

raised a million.

BIALYSTOCK

But the play only cost $60,000 to

produce.

BLOOM

Exactly.  And how long did it run?

BIALYSTOCK

One night.

21.

BLOOM

See?  You could have raised a

million dollars, put on a sixty

thousand dollar flop and kept the

rest.

BIALYSTOCK

But what if the play was a hit?

BLOOM

Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play

were a hit, you'd have to pay off

the backers, and with so many

backers there could never be enough

profits to go around, get it?

BIALYSTOCK

Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So,

in order for the scheme to work,

we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

BLOOM

What scheme?

BIALYSTOCK

What scheme?  Your scheme, you

bloody little genius.

BLOOM

Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no

scheme.  I merely posed a little,

academic accounting theory.  It's

just a thought.

BIALYSTOCK

Bloom, worlds are turned on such

thoughts!

BIALYSTOCK

Don't you see, Bloom.  Darling,

Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so

simple.  Step one:  We find the

worst play in the world -- a sure

flop.  Step two:  I raise a million

dollars -- there's a lot of little

old ladies in this world.  Step

three:  You go back to work on the

books.  Phoney lists of backers --

one for the government, one for us.

You can do it, Bloom, you're a

wizard.

(MORE)

22.

BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)

Step four:  We open on Broadway and

before you can say 'step five' we

close on Broadway.  Step six:  We

take our million dollars and fly to

Rio de Janiero.

BIALYSTOCK

(sings)

"Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo,

myo, meo ... "

BLOOM

(afraid of the

scheme, afraid of the

dance, afraid of Bialystock)

Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please.

You're holding me too tight.  I'm

an honest man.  You don't understand.

BIALYSTOCK

(leading Bloom as he talks)

No, Bloom, you don't understand.

This is fate, this is destiny.

There's no avoiding it.

BLOOM

(the back of his head

practically touching

the floor)

Mr. Bialystock, not more than five

minutes ago, against my better

judgment, I doctored your books.

That, sir, is the ultimate extent

of my criminal life.

BIALYSTOCK

OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!

OOOOOHH!  I WANT THAT MONEY!

23.

BLOOM

(to himself)

Oh, I fell on my keys.

(he shifts slightly

to make himself more comfortable)

I've got to get out of here.

BIALYSTOCK

(angrily hovering

over Bloom)

You miserable, cowardly, wretched

little caterpillar.  Don't you ever

want to become a butterfly?  Don't

you want to spread your wings and

flap your way to glory?

BLOOM

(his eyes widened in terror)

You're going to jump on me.

BLOOM

You're going to jump on me.  I know

you're going to jump on me -- like

Nero jumped on Poppea.

BIALYSTOCK

(nonplussed)

What???

BLOOM

(by now he is shrieking)

Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she

was unfaithful to him.  So he got

mad and he jumped on her.  Up and

down, up and down, until he squashed

her like a bug.  Please don't jump

on me.

BIALYSTOCK

(shouting and jumping

up and down next to Bloom)

I'm not going to jump on you!

BLOOM

(rolling away in terror)

Aaaaaaaaaa!

24.

BIALYSTOCK

(hoisting Bloom to

his feet)

Will you get a hold on yourself.

BLOOM

(up on his feet and

running for cover)

Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!

BIALYSTOCK

What are you afraid of?  I'm not

going to hurt you!  What's the

matter with you?

BLOOM

I'm hysterical.  I'm having

hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I

can't stop.  When I get like this,

I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

BLOOM

I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical

and I'm wet!

BLOOM

(holding his face)

I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm

still hysterical!

BLOOM

No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't

help.  It only increases my sense

of danger.

BIALYSTOCK

What can I do?  What can I do?

You're getting me hysterical.

BLOOM

Go away from me.  You frighten me.

(he indicates the sofa)

Sit over there.

25.

BIALYSTOCK

(exasperated)

Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that

better?

BLOOM

It's a little better, but you still

look angry.

BIALYSTOCK

How's this?

(he smiles sweetly)

BLOOM

Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's

very nice.  I think I'm coming out

of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm

definitely coming out of it.  Thank

you for smiling.  It helped a great

deal.

BIALYSTOCK

(for want of something

sensible)

Well, you know what they say,

"Smile and the world smiles with

you."  Heh, heh.

(to himself)

The man should be in a straight

jacket.

(to Bloom)

Feeling better?

BLOOM

Much, thank you.  But I am a little

lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat

something.  Hysterics have a way of

severely depleting one's blood

sugar, you know.

BIALYSTOCK

They certainly do.  They certainly

do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

BLOOM

That's very kind of you, Mr.

Bialystock, but I ...

26.

BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I

lowered your blood sugar, but least

I could do is raise it a little.

BIALYSTOCK

And I promise you faithfully, I

won't discuss that silly scheme to

make a million dollars anymore.

BIALYSTOCK

Avanti!

BLOOM

(to Bialystock, who

is holding door)

Thank you.

BIALYSTOCK

Je vous empris.

BIALYSTOCK

(pointing to his hat)

My hat.

BLOOM

I'll get it.

27.

BIALYSTOCK

Murray, I'm going to lunch.  I took

two dollars.

MURRAY THE BLINDMAN

Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty

you owe me.

BIALYSTOCK

I know.  Don't worry.  You'll get

it.  You'll get it.

MURRAY THE BLINDMAN

(tapping his way along)

Well, don't forget about it.  I

need it.  Nobody understands.  I'm

competing with giants.  The Greater

New York Fund.  The March of Dimes.

The Community Chest.  They're

driving me out of business.

BLOOM

(out of breath)

I got it, Mr. Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK

Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max.

You know, I don't let everybody

call me Max.  It's only people I

really like.

BLOOM

(trying it on)

Okay ... Max!  And you can call me

Leo.

BIALYSTOCK

I already have.  Come on.

BLOOM

Oh.

28.

BIALYSTOCK

Where would you like to eat?

BLOOM

Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What

do you think, Max?

BIALYSTOCK

Let me see ... it's such a beautiful

day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've

got it!  Let's go to Coney Island!

We'll lunch at the sea shore.

BLOOM

Coney Island??

BIALYSTOCK

What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you

like Coney Island?

BLOOM

I ... I love it.  I haven't been

there since I was a kid.  But it's

nearly two o'clock.  I really

should be getting back to Whitehall

and Marks.

BIALYSTOCK

Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and

Marks are concerned, you're working

with Bialystock, right?

BLOOM

Right.

BIALYSTOCK

Then stick with Bialystock!

BIALYSTOCK

(to Custard Man)

We'll have another round.

CUSTARD MAN

What kind now, sports?

29.

BIALYSTOCK

What kind now, Leo?

BLOOM

(he's loosening up)

I don't know.  Let's see.  We've

had chocolate, vanilla, banana -

let's go green.

BIALYSTOCK

(to Custard Man)

Two pistachios, my good man.

CUSTARD MAN

I'm not your good man, I happen to

own this establishment.

(he turns to fill the order)

BIALYSTOCK

Everybody's a big shot.

(turns to Bloom)

Well, Leo, are you having a good

time?

BLOOM

I don't know.  I think so.  I feel

very strange.

BIALYSTOCK

Maybe you're happy.

BLOOM

Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well,

whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

BLOOM

(licking his pistachio

custard.  He is ecstatic)

I love it.  I love it.  Get set.

We're coming to another turn.

BIALYSTOCK

(working, relentlessly

working on Bloom)

Bloom, it can always be like this.

Life can be beautiful.  Let me show

you.  Stick with ...

30.

BIALYSTOCK

Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk.

BIALYSTOCK

Money is honey.  Money is honey.

Money can put soft things next to

your skin.  Silk ... satin ... women.

BLOOM

But if we're caught, we'll go to

prison.

BIALYSTOCK

(sensing victory, he

marshals his forces

for the final assault)

You think you're not in prison now?

Living in a grey little room.

Going to a grey little job.  Leading

a grey little life.

BLOOM

You're right.  You're absolutely

right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my

life counting other people's

money -- people I'm smarter than,

better than.  Where's my share?

Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want,

I want, I want, I want everything

I've ever seen in the movies!

BLOOM

(coming out of it)

Hey, we're going up.

31.

BIALYSTOCK

You bet your boots, Leo.  It's

Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.

Upward and onward.  Say, you'll

join me.  Nothing can stop us.

BLOOM

(shouting at the top

of his lungs)

I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!

BIALYSTOCK

This is where we belong, Leo.  On

top of the world.  Top of the world!

BIALYSTOCK

Oiiiiiii!!!

BLOOM

Ohhhhhhhh!!!

BLOOM

Max, let's call it a night.  It's

two in the morning.  I don't know

what I'm reading anymore.

BIALYSTOCK

Read, read.  We've got to find the

worst play ever written.

32.

BIALYSTOCK

Hmmnn.  "Gregor Samsa awoke one

morning to find he had been

transformed into a giant cock-a-

roach."

BIALYSTOCK

It's good!!!

BLOOM

(mumbling to himself

as he reads)

Wait a minute, I've read this part.

I'm reading plays I read this

morning.

BLOOM

Good lord, it's morning.  Let's

face it, we'll never find it.

(he turns to face Bialystock)

Max, tomorrow's another day.

Today's another day.

BIALYSTOCK

(off-camera.  Crazy

little voice)

We'll never find it, eh?  We'll

never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha,

ha.

BIALYSTOCK

(as he does an insane

little jig around the script)

You can't smell it when it's under

your nose.  You can't see it when

it's right before your eyes.

(MORE)

33.

BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)

You can't feel it when it's in your

hand, when it's in your pocket.

BLOOM

Max, what is it?  What are you

doing?  What's happening?

BIALYSTOCK

I'll tell you what's happening.

We've struck gold.  Not fool's

gold, but real gold.  The mother

lode.  The mother lode.  The mother

of them all.

BLOOM

(brightening)

You found a flop!

BIALYSTOCK

A flop, ha!  That's putting it

mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe!

An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close-

in-one-night beauty!

BIALYSTOCK

This is freedom from want forever.

This is a house in the country.

This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.

This is wine, women and song and

women.

BLOOM

(voice over)

"SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp

with Adolph and Eva in

Berchtesgarten."  Fantastic!

BIALYSTOCK

It's practically a love letter to

Hitler!

34.

BLOOM

(ecstatic)

It won't run a week!

BIALYSTOCK

Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This

play has got to close in the first

act.

BLOOM

Who wrote it?

BLOOM

Here it is -- 415.

SUPER

Who do you want?

BLOOM

(taken aback)

I beg your pardon?

SUPER

Who do you want?  No one gets in

the building unless I know who they

want ... I'm the concierge.  My

husband used to be the concierge.

He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge.

BIALYSTOCK

(imperiously)

We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind.

SUPER

Oh, the kraut.  He's on the top

floor.  Apartment twenty-three.

BLOOM

Thank you.

35.

SUPER

But you won't find him there.  He's

up on the roof with his birds.  He

keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting,

filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You

used to be able to sit out on the

stoop like a person.  Not anymore.

No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift?

BLOOM

We ... uh ... get your drift.

Thank you, Madam.

SUPER

I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge.

LIEBKIND

(to pigeon)

Hilda, look ... look good ...

Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda,

if he lives, I know you will find

him.

BLOOM

(quietly to Bialystock)

He's wearing a German helmet.

BIALYSTOCK

(in a fierce whisper)

Shhh.  Don't say anything to offend

him.  We need that play.

(cups his hands to

his mouth and calls

up to the coop)

Franz Liebkind?

36.

LIEBKIND

(he speaks with a

German accent)

I vas never a member of the Nazi

party.  I am not responsible.  I

only followed orders.  Who are you?

BIALYSTOCK

Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't

understand.

LIEBKIND

Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers

are in order.  I love my country.

(he sings)

"Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,

For amber vaves of grain."

BIALYSTOCK

Mr. Liebkind, wait ...

LIEBKIND

(singing)

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

BIALYSTOCK

(interrupting)

Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're

not from the government.  We came

here to talk to you about your play.

LIEBKIND

My play?  You mean, "Springtime For

... " you know who?

BIALYSTOCK

Yes.

LIEBKIND

Vat about it?

BIALYSTOCK

We loved it.  We thought it was a

masterpiece.  That's why we're here.

We want to produce it on Broadway.

LIEBKIND

You're not, as you Americans say,

dragging my leg, are you?

37.

BLOOM

No, not at all sir, we're quite

serious.  We want to produce your

play.

(he reaches into his

attache case and

displays a legal

looking document)

I have the contracts right here.

LIEBKIND

(looking up)

Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of

dreams!  I can't believe it.

(he turns to the pigeons)

Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto,

Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do

you hear?  Ve are going to clear

the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly,

spread the words.

LIEBKIND

(singing at the top

of his lungs)

"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber

alles, Uber alles in der velt."

LIEBKIND

(singing for all he's worth)

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

BLOOM

(shouting)

Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.

LIEBKIND

Vat?

BLOOM

People can hear you.

LIEBKIND

OH.

(he sings)

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee

Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is

not place to talk.  Come!

(MORE)

38.

LIEBKIND (CONT'D)

We go to my flat.  An occasion like

this calls for Schnapps.

LIEBKIND

(as he hands glasses

to Bialystock and Bloom)

Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock.

Gentleman, with your permission, I

would like to propose a toast to

the greatest man that ever lived.

Let us say his name quietly to

ourselves.  The walls have ears.

LIEBKIND

(a fervent whisper)

Adolph Hitler.

(he downs drink)

BLOOM

(whisper)

Sigmund Freud.

(he downs drink)

BIALYSTOCK

(whisper)

Max Bialystock.

(he downs drink)

LIEBKIND

I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

BIALYSTOCK

With whom?

39.

LIEBKIND

(astonished by the question)

Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He

liked me.  Out of all the household

staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his

favorite.  I vas the only one

allowed into his chambers at bedtime.

BIALYSTOCK

No kidding?

LIEBKIND

Oh, sure.  I used to take him his

hot milk and his opium.  Achhh,

those were the days.  Vat good

times ve had.  Dinner parties vit

lovely ladies and gentlemen,

singing und dancing.  You know, not

many people knew about it, but the

Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.

BIALYSTOCK

Really, I never dreamed ...

LIEBKIND

(flies into an

indignant rage)

That's because you were taken in by

that verdampter Allied propaganda.

Such filthy lies.  But nobody said

a bad vord about Winston Churchill,

did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!

(he gestures V for victory)

Churchill, vit his cigars and his

brandy and his rotten paintings.

Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would

say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not

Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me

tell this, and you're getting it

straight from the horse, Hitler vas

better looking than Churchill, he

vas a better dresser than Churchill,

had more hair, told funnier jokes,

and could dance the pants off

Churchill!

BIALYSTOCK

(swinging along)

That's exactly why we want to do

this play.  To show the world the

true Hitler, the Hitler you knew,

the Hitler you loved, the Hitler

with a song in his heart.

(MORE)

40.

BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)

(to Bloom)

Leo, quick, the contract.

BIALYSTOCK

Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind.

And make your dream a reality.

LIEBKIND

Wait.  No.  How do I know I can

trust you?  How do I know you vill

present this play in the manner and

spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

BIALYSTOCK

We swear it!

LIEBKIND

Not good enough... Vould you be

villing to take the Siegfried oath?

BIALYSTOCK

Yes.  We would!

LIEBKIND

Good.  I will make the preparations.

BLOOM

(anxious whisper)

Max, I don't want to take any

Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what

it is, but I don't want to take it.

We might end up in the German Army.

BIALYSTOCK

Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless

nut.  Play along with him.  It's

almost in the bag.

41.

LIEBKIND

Please to don your helmets.

LIEBKIND

Please to light your candles.

LIEBKIND

Please repeat after me.  I solemnly

swear...

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

I solemnly swear...

LIEBKIND

By the sacred memory...

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

By the sacred memory...

LIEBKIND

Of Siegfried...

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Of Siegfried...

LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Wagner...

LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Bismark...

LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

Hindenburg...

LIEBKIND

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

The Graf Spee...

LIEBKIND

The Blue Max...

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

The Blue Max...

LIEBKIND

And last, but not least, Adolph...

you know who.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

And last, but not least, Adolph...

you know who.

LIEBKIND

(saluting)

Heil you know who!

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

(spiritlessly saluting)

Heil you know who!

LIEBKIND

Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the

contract.

BIALYSTOCK

Good.  Good.

(he hands Liebkind

the pen)

LIEBKIND

No.  No.  Not in ink.  We'll

desecrate the oath.  It must be

done in blood.

LIEBKIND

Fingers, please.

43.

LIEBKIND

Ve vill sign vit this sacred qvill

taken from the last chicken I

served at Berchtesgarten.

BIALYSTOCK

(triumphantly whacking

the contract with the

back of his hand)

There it is... in red and white!

"Springtime For Hitler," signed,

sealed and delivered.

(he notices Bloom's

dour expression)

What's the matter with you?

BLOOM

Look, I'm just not wearing this arm

band.  I don't care how big the

deal is.

BIALYSTOCK

(placating him)

Okay, take it off, take it off.

BIALYSTOCK

(to cab driver as he

opens door)

The Blue Gypsy.

BLOOM

(about to enter cab

with Bialystock)

Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!

44.

BIALYSTOCK

(stopping Bloom from

entering cab)

We are not going to The Blue Gypsy.

I am going to The Blue Gypsy.

BIALYSTOCK

I have a rendez-vous with a lady of

some means.  You see dear Bloom,

phase one is complete, the play is

ours.  We are now entering phase

two -- the raising of the money.

In the days to come, you will see

very little of me, for Bialystock

is launching himself into little-

old-lady-land.

(to cab driver)

Avanti!

LITTLE OLD LADY #3

Here's to the success of your new

play.

BIALYSTOCK

Our play, my love.

LITTLE OLD LADY #3

Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?

BIALYSTOCK

Think nothing of it, my dear.  A

mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did

you bring your checkbook?

45.

LITTLE OLD LADY #3

It's right here in my purse and I

made it out just as you told me --

to cash.  That's a funny name for a

play.

BIALYSTOCK

Think nothing of it.

BIALYSTOCK

(taking check from

old lady)

Thank you, my dear.

LITTLE OLD LADY #4

Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again.

Tell me again.

BIALYSTOCK

Edna, I swear on my life, you don't

look a day over sixty-five.

46.

BIALYSTOCK

Clear the road!  Clear the road!

LITTLE OLD LADY #5

(clutching Bialystock fiercely)

Go, Bialy, baby, go!

LITTLE OLD LADY #6

(slightly flustered)

Go on with the concert!  Go on with

the concert!  It's nothing.  Nothing.

LITTLE OLD LADY #6

(to Bialystock, smiling)

You dirty man.

LITTLE OLD LADY #7

(off camera)

Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo,

teehee hee.

BIALYSTOCK

(off camera, simultaneously)

Heh, heh, heh.  Hah, hah, hah.

47.

LITTLE OLD LADY #8

(stepping back to

admire her work)

Well, Bialy, how's it coming?

BIALYSTOCK

It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful.

(to the heavens)

Oi.

HOLD ME, TOUCH ME

Dance!  Dance, slave!

BIALYSTOCK

How's this?

HOLD ME, TOUCH ME

Faster, faster, you dog.  Excite

me, delight me.  Hold me, touch me.

BIALYSTOCK

(murmuring to himself)

Money is honey, money is honey.

BLOOM

(handing Bialystock contract)

Mrs. Sarah Catheart.  She owns 50%

of the profits.

48.

BLOOM

Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also

owns 50% of the profits.

BLOOM

Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also

owns 50% of the profits.

BLOOM

Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100%

of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK

Leo, what if this play is a hit?

BLOOM

Then the Department of Justice owns

100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

BIALYSTOCK

(Bloom's thought

makes him unhappy)

OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a

favor.  Open the safe.  I want to

see the money.

BIALYSTOCK

(to himself.  Inhales deeply)

That's better.

BLOOM

What are you doing?

BIALYSTOCK

I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked

very, very hard and I think I

deserve a toy.

49.

BLOOM

(quizzically)

A toy?

BLOOM

That's a toy?

BIALYSTOCK

Yes.  She's an adult, educational

toy made in Sweden for children

over fifty.

BIALYSTOCK

Stop looking at me like that.

She's not an indulgence.  She

happens to be our new receptionist.

She goes with our new surroundings.

BIALYSTOCK

Ulla, I'd like you to meet my

partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.

ULLA

Got dag pa dig.

BLOOM

How do you do.

(to Bialystock)

Have you gone mad?  A receptionist

that can't speak English.  What

will people say?

BIALYSTOCK

They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah,

ooh, ooh."

BLOOM

What is she gonna do here?

BIALYSTOCK

I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.

ULLA

Ya, sur.

50.

BIALYSTOCK

See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla,

okay.  Okay.

BIALYSTOCK

Go to desk.  Answer telephone.

BIALYSTOCK

Bialystock and Bloom.  Bialystock

and Bloom.

ULLA

(repeating to herself

as she leaves)

Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock

and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.

Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.

BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom, opening up

a box on his desk)

Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

BLOOM

No thanks.

BLOOM

Max, maybe...

BLOOM

What's that?

BIALYSTOCK

Nothing.  Nothing.  Go on.

51.

ULLA

(pinching Bialystock's

cheek)

Min Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK

Nice girl.

BLOOM

Max, as I was saying, maybe we

should go easy on the spending.  I

mean these offices and everything.

BIALYSTOCK

Why?  Take it when you can get it!

Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!

BLOOM

But if something should... God

forbid... go wrong, at least we

could give them some of their money

back.  It would look better in court.

BIALYSTOCK

Stop talking like that, you white

mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong.

As a matter of fact, today I have

taken steps to insure total disaster.

At two o'clock we have an

appointment with none other than

Roger De Bris.

BLOOM

(searching)

Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh

yes, the director.  Is he good... I

mean bad?

BIALYSTOCK

Roger De Bris is the worst director

that ever lived.

BLOOM

Do you think he'll take the job?

BIALYSTOCK

Only if we ask him.

52.

BIALYSTOCK

Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're

late.

BIALYSTOCK

Call chauffeur.  Get car.

ULLA

(smiling)

Good.  Good.  We go Motel.

BIALYSTOCK

No.  We go.

(he indicates Bloom

and himself)

ULLA

You, Blum go Motel.

BIALYSTOCK

No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.

ULLA

(as she leaves)

Get car.  Get car.

BIALYSTOCK

Very nice girl.

BIALYSTOCK

(to chauffeur)

Thank you, Rudolfo.

BIALYSTOCK

(whispering)

Now don't let anything he does or

says upset you.  He's a little

peculiar.

BLOOM

What do you mean?

53.

CARMEN

Yesssssss?

BIALYSTOCK

I am Max Bialystock.  This is my

associate, Mr. Bloom.  We have an

appointment with Mr. De Bris.

CARMEN

Ah, yes, you're expected.  Please

come in.

CARMEN

How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr.

De Bris' private secretary.  Would

you be so kind as to remove your

shoes.

CARMEN

White, white, white is the color of

our carpets.

CARMEN

(to Bloom indicating

a rack of slippers)

Now, let's see, you're wearing grey.

I would suggest the crimson.

They're a little vivid, but your

suit is so quiet.

(to Bialystock,

studying his mish

mash attire)

Why don't you... Oh, take anything.

Please follow me.

54.

DE BRIS

(from behind screen)

I'll never get into this damned

thing.

CARMEN

(to De Bris)

We're not alone.

DE BRIS

Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I

presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the

pun.

BLOOM

(to Bialystock)

What pun?

BIALYSTOCK

(a curt whisper)

Shut up.  He thinks he's witty.

(to De Bris)

It's good to see you again, Roger.

Did you get a chance to read

"Springtime For Hitler?"

DE BRIS

Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning

piece of work.

BLOOM

(shocked, whispers)

Max!  He's wearing a dress.

(his mouth remains open)

BIALYSTOCK

Shhhhhh.

55.

DE BRIS

(continuing)

I think it's a very important play.

I, for one, never realized that the

Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean

it's drenched with historical

goodies like that.

DE BRIS

Oh, dear, you're staring at my

dress.  I should explain.  I'm

going to the Choreographer's Ball

tonight.  There's a prize for the

best costume.

CARMEN

(smugly)

We always win.

DE BRIS

(looking in the mirror)

I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm

supposed to be the Grand Duchess --

I think I look more like Tugboat

Annie.  What do you think?

DE BRIS

No be cruel.  Be brutal.  Be brutal.

Because heaven knows they will.

Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

BLOOM

(very embarrassed)

Well, it's... uh... it's nice and

long... I mean, it's... uh... uh...

where do you keep your wallet?

BIALYSTOCK

(jumping in)

It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.

You couldn't have picked a better

color.  It brings out your eyes.

Let's face it, Roger, that dress is

you.

56.

DE BRIS

(his eyes flashing flirtatiously)

Do you really think it brings out

my eyes?

CARMEN

(irritated)

We can't tell a thing without your

wig.  As far as I'm concerned,

you're only half-dressed.

DE BRIS

Ummmm.  Well, if you're so worried

about the wig, get it, o' wicked

witch of the west.

BIALYSTOCK

(in a whisper to Bloom)

Quick, light his cigarette.  He

likes you.

DE BRIS

Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

BLOOM

I've... I've... never been on a

cruise.

DE BRIS

Oh, quel dommage.

CARMEN

(snidely)

Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.

57.

DE BRIS

How would you like to go back to

teasing hair, big mouth?

BIALYSTOCK

Roger, do you mind if we talk a

little business?

DE BRIS

Please, please, that's what we're

here for.

(to Carmen, who is

adjusting the wig)

Be careful, that hurt.

BIALYSTOCK

I think this would be a marvelous

opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to

now, you've always been associated

with musicals, and...

DE BRIS

Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey

gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-

turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to

make you throw up!  At last a

chance to do straight drama!  To

deal with conflict, with inner

truth.  Roger De Bris presents

history.  Of course, I think we

should add a little music.  That

whole third act has got to go.

They're losing the war.  It's too

depressing.  We'll have to put

something in there.

(gripped by his vision)

Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of

beautiful girls, dressed as Storm

Troopers, black patent leather

boots, all marching together...

Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn-

kick-turn!

BIALYSTOCK

That's genius.  That's genius.

Roger, I think I speak for Mr.

Bloom and myself when I say that

you're the only man in the world

who can do justice to SPRINGTIME

FOR HITLER.

58.

DE BRIS

(in one rush)

Wait a minute.  This is a very big

decision.  It might effect the

course of my entire life.  I'll

have to think about it.  I'll do it.

BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations.

DE BRIS

(to Carmen)

Get on the phone.  Send out a

casting call.  Call every agent in

town.  I want to see everybody.

Everybody.

BIALYSTOCK

(looking for the

least likely Hitler)

Roger, what about that one?  The

fat Hitler on the right?

DE BRIS

I don't know.  I rather fancy that

one.

BIALYSTOCK

Not bad.  Not bad.  What do you

think, Franz?

59.

LIEBKIND

(very emotional)

I don't know.  I don't know.  For

some strange reason, I'm deeply

moved.

(he wipes away a tear)

DE BRIS

(getting to his feet)

Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.  We

must have some order.

DE BRIS

(clapping his hands

for attention)

Will all the dancing Hitlers please

wait in the wings.  We're only

taking the singing Hitlers.

CARMEN

Arthur Packard.

DE BRIS

Hello, Arthur.  Tell us something

about yourself.

ARTHUR PACKARD

(in a strangulated

tenor's voice)

I was the lead tenor of the

Albuquerque Opera Company for two

seasons.  I just finished a road

tour of STUDENT PRINCE.  And last

season I was up for the lead in the

Broadway production of Circus Man.

DE BRIS

What happened?

ARTHUR PACKARD

I didn't get it.

60.

DE BRIS

What are you going to sing for us

Arthur?

ARTHUR PACKARD

The soliloquy from CAROUSEL.

ARTHUR PACKARD

(sings)

My boy Bill will be strong and as

tall as a...

DE BRIS

Thank you.

DE BRIS

Next please.

CARMEN

Jason Green.

DE BRIS

Well, Jason, what have you been

doing lately?

JASON GREEN

(in basso profundo)

For the last sixteen years, I've

been touring with "Naughty Marietta."

DE BRIS

Good.  And what are you going to

sing for us, Jason?

JASON GREEN

"Stout-hearted Men."

61.

JASON GREEN

(singing)

"Give me some men

Who are stout-hearted men

Who will fight for the right they

adore."

DE BRIS

(off-camera voice)

Thaaank you.

BALD HITLER

(singing)

"Show me some men

Who are stout-hearted men

And I'll soon show you ten thousand

more."

DE BRIS

(off-camera voice)

Thaaank you.

ITALIAN HITLER

(singing)

"Shoulder to shoulder and bolder

and bolder

They grow as they march to the war."

DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaaank you.

DELICATE HITLER

(singing)

"There is nothing in this world can

halt or mar our plan."

DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaank you.

SHORT-HAIRED WOMAN HITLER

"When stout-hearted men

Will get together man to man."

62.

DE BRIS

(voice off camera)

Thaaank you.

CARMEN

Well, that's it.

BLOOM

I think that's enough Hitlers for

one day.  Maybe we'll get lucky

tomorrow.

BIALYSTOCK

You think out of all those Hitlers

you could find just one...

LIEBKIND

It was the same thing in Germany.

We looked for years before we found

the right Hitler.

LSD

Hey, man.

CARMEN

I beg your pardon.

LSD

Is this where they're auditioning

Boomerang?

CARMEN

(studying him coldly)

No, I'm afraid you've wandered into

the wrong theatre.

LSD

(to himself, as he

starts to leave)

Man, freaked out again.

63.

BIALYSTOCK

(leaping to his feet)

Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is

Boomerang.

DE BRIS

(to Bialystock)

What are you saying?

BIALYSTOCK

Let's hear him.  What have we got

to lose?

(to LSD)

What's your name?

LSD

Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody

calls me LSD.

DE BRIS

What have you done, LSD?

LSD

Six months, I'm out on probation,

but it's cool now, baby.

DE BRIS

I mean in show business.

LSD

Oh, in show business.  Well, let's

put it this way, my next job will

be my debut.

DE BRIS

What do you do best?

LSD

Hey, man, I can't do that here,

that's what they put me away for.

DE BRIS

Oh, sing.  Sing!

LSD

Hey, baby, that's where they put

me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know

that, you been up?

DE BRIS

(a little hysterical)

Sing a song!  Just sing a song!

64.

LSD

Here's a little thing I think

you're going to see on the charts

any day.  I wrote it last night in

my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk

Rock Ballad.

BIALYSTOCK

(shouting)

That's our Hitler!

LIEBKIND

(howls of despair)

Vaaaat???

BIALYSTOCK

(quickly)

Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a

man of his time.  This is a man of

his time.

LIEBKIND

But he has long hair!

BIALYSTOCK

Don't look at the outside, look at

the inside.  It's the inner Hitler

we're after.  The young beautiful

Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

LIEBKIND

I don't know.  I don't know.

DE BRIS

(he has been studying

LSD intensely)

Could be an exciting piece of off-

beat casting.  Of course, we'd have

to do something about that coiffure.

LIEBKIND

But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy,

he's so... so... American!

65.

BIALYSTOCK

Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't

let you down.

LIEBKIND

All right, but remember, if you

damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I

kill you.

FIRST WELL-WISHER

(a silver-haired

gentleman in his late fifties)

Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big

hit.

BIALYSTOCK

(mumbling)

Bite your tongue.

SECOND WELL-WISHER

(a little old lady)

We're gonna do it this time, Bialy,

I just know it.

BIALYSTOCK

I hope you lose your bloomers.

THIRD WELL-WISHER

(another old lady)

My prayers go with you, Bialy.

BIALYSTOCK

God Forbid.

66.

LIEBKIND

(to Bialystock and

Bloom, very seriously)

Gentlemen, this is a very momentous

moment.

LIEBKIND

(to Bloom)

Good luck.

(to Bialystock)

Good luck.

LIEBKIND

(a mad gleam in his eye)

Tonight, New York.  Tomorrow, the

world!

OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)

Check your hat?

LIEBKIND

(off camera)

No!!

BIALYSTOCK

So much for Nutsy Fagin.

BLOOM

(nudging Bialystock, whispers)

Here comes the Times Drama Critic.

BIALYSTOCK

Watch closely, as Bialystock drives

the last nail into the coffin.

67.

BIALYSTOCK

Always delighted to see the

gentlemen of the press.  There you

are, sir.  Two on the aisle,

compliments of the management.

(he smiles unctuously)

DRAMA CRITIC

(haughtily accepting tickets)

Thank you.  Here, wait a minute.

There seems to be some mistake.

There's a hundred dollar bill

wrapped around these tickets.

BIALYSTOCK

(conspiratorially)

It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show.

DRAMA CRITIC

(outraged)

Mr. Bialystock, just what do you

think you're doing?

BIALYSTOCK

I'm bribing you.  And if you play

ball, there's a lot more where that

came from.

DRAMA CRITIC

(blustering with rage)

I... I... I... How dare he!  I've

never been so insulted in my life!

The gall of the man!  The incredible

gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon.

OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)

Check your hat?

DRAMA CRITIC

(off camera)

No!!

68.

BIALYSTOCK

(grinning like a

Cheshire cat)

Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us.

BLOOM

Come on, they've started the

overture.

BLOOM

(casually shrieking)

Well, Max, this is it!!!

BLOOM

(whispers)

I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

BIALYSTOCK

Relax, in two hours our worries

will be over.

STORM TROOPER CHORUS

(singing)

Germany was having trouble,

What a sad, sad story.

Needed a new leader

To restore its former glory.

Where, oh, where was he,

Who could that man be,

We looked around,

And then we found,

The man for you and me,

And now its...

69.

ENTIRE CHORUS

(singing)

"Springtime for Hitler," etc.

WOMAN (DOWAGER)

This is shocking!

MAN (STUFFED SHIRT)

Outrageous!

BIALYSTOCK

Ahhhhh, it's going better than I

expected.

WOMAN

(to man as they exit theatre)

Well, talk about bad taste.

BIALYSTOCK

(he chuckles as they leave)

Come, let us repair to the bar

across the street.  I don't want to

be caught here during intermission.

We'll be stoned to death.

70.

ENTIRE CHORUS

(singing)

So Springtime for Hitler,

Is Springtime for Goering,

Is Springtime for Goebbels,

Is Springtime for Himmler,

Is Springtime for you and me!!

EVA

Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht.

Er liebt mir.

(the last petal)

Er liebt mir nicht.

EVA

(turns to LSD)

Du liebt mir nicht!

LSD

(protesting vehemently)

I lieb you baby, I lieb you.  You

know that.

EVA

If you lieb me, why are you leaving

me?

LSD

Hey, man, I can't spend all my time

with you.  I took an oath, baby,

Deutschland uber alles.

71.

MAN

That's Hitler?  I get it!  It's a

put-on.

WOMAN

Hey, Harry, he's funny.

BIALYSTOCK

Here's to the one and only

performance of "Springtime for

Hitler."

BIALYSTOCK

Innkeeper, innkeeper, another round

of drinks here.  As a matter of

fact, a round of drinks for

everybody in the place!

BLOOM

Just think, yesterday I was a

meaningless little accountant --

and today, I am the producer of a

Broadway flop!

BIALYSTOCK

(raising his glass)

To failure!

BLOOM

To failure!

DRUNK

(blushing)

Oh, thank you!  It's very kind of

you.

(raises his glass and

downs his drink)

(MORE)

72.

DRUNK (CONT'D)

EVA

If the Duke of Windsor could give

up the Throne of England for the

woman he loved, why can't you?

LSD

It's different.  I'm a tyrant, baby.

LIEBKIND

(becoming slightly unhinged)

Baby, why does he keep saying baby?

I didn't write baby.  The Fuhrer

never said baby.  Vat is it vit

this baby?

WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT

(very annoyed)

Will you shut up!

LIEBKIND

You shut up!  I'm the author.

You're just the audience.  I

outrank you.

BIALYSTOCK

Bartender, bartender, another drink

for myself and my associate, Mr.

Bloom.  And don't forget our good-

natured inebriate over there.

DRUNK

Eternally grateful.  Sincerely

yours, Oliver Wendell Drunk.

73.

DRUNK

(raises his glass)

A toast!

BLOOM

To what?

DRUNK

(stumped)

To... toast!  I love toast.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

To toast.

BIALYSTOCK

(smacking his glass

down on the bar)

Now I'll take the lead and I want

you right behind me all the way!

One... two... three!

(singing)

"By the light,

BLOOM AND DRUNK

(singing)

"By the light, by the light,

BIALYSTOCK

"Of the silvery moon,

BLOOM AND DRUNK

"Of the silvery mooooon,

BIALYSTOCK

"I want to croon,

BLOOM AND DRUNK

"He wants to croon, he wants to

croon,

BIALYSTOCK

"To my honey I'll croon,

BLOOM AND DRUNK

"He's gonna croon love's tune,

BIALYSTOCK

"Honeymoon,

BLOOM AND DRUNK

"Honeymoon, honeymoon,

BIALYSTOCK

"Keep a shining in...

74.

BIALYSTOCK

Intermission!  Quick, hide your

face.  They'll tear us to pieces.

CROWD

(ad-lib)

"Scotch on the rocks,"

"Bourbon and soda."

"Two martinis."

"Whiskey sour."

WOMAN

(to her escort)

Well, so far that's about the

funniest thing I've ever seen on

Broadway.

WOMAN'S ESCORT

Never laughed so much in my life.

MAN

(to his friend)

Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.

MAN'S FRIEND

I thought I'd split my sides.

BIALYSTOCK

Take it easy, don't panic.  There

are a lot of plays on this street.

They are not necessarily talking

about "Springtime For Hitler."

HUSBAND

(to his wife)

Honey, I never in a million years

thought I'd ever love a show called

"Springtime For Hitler."

75.

LITTLE OLD LADY #8

Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it.

It's a smasheroo.

BIALYSTOCK

(in a daze)

Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

LITTLE OLD LADY

Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't

want to miss one minute of it.

BIALYSTOCK

(dazed)

Got to think... Got to think... Got

to think... Got to think... Got to

think...

BLOOM

Mrs. Cathcart -- 50%

Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50%

Mrs. Wentworth -- 50%

Mrs. Resnick -- 100%

DRUNK

(singing)

"By the light...

By the light, by the light...

Of the silvery...

BIALYSTOCK

Get away from me, you drunken bum!

76.

DRUNK

(indignantly)

Fairweather friend!

BIALYSTOCK

Maybe it's not true!

BLOOM

(still mumbling to himself)

No way out.  No way out.

BIALYSTOCK

Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.

BLOOM

(droning monotonously)

No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

BIALYSTOCK

Why don't we go over to the theatre

and see what's really happening?

After all, we've only heard from a

small portion of the audience.

Let's hear what the majority thinks.

BLOOM

(in a trance)

The majority.  The majority.  Yes.

Let's hear from the majority.

BLOOM

I don't want to go in.

BIALYSTOCK

Come, we have to.

77.

GENERAL

(making a report)

We are falling back on all fronts.

Our soldiers are retreating.

LSD

No good, baby, no good.  You heard

my orders.  Nobody retreats.

Attack!  Attack!

GENERAL

Who can we attack?  They're all too

big.

LSD

(getting an inspiration)

Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!

GENERAL

We can't... we keep our money there!

LIEBKIND

Baby, again with that baby.  There

must be no more babies.

LSD

Where's Goebbels?  Where's my

little Joe?

GENERAL

(to the wings)

Send for Goebbels.

78.

LSD

He's the only cat left that still

grooves me.

GOEBBELS

Heil, baby!  I just finished the

morning propaganda broadcasts.

LSD

What did you tell the people?

GOEBBELS

I told them we invaded England.

LSD

Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we

come out?

GOEBBELS

We won.

LSD

Groovy!

LIEBKIND

Bring down the curtain!  Bring down

the curtain!

LSD

Goebbels, you're the only one...

LIEBKIND

I am the author of this play.  You

are the victims of a hoax.  These

are not my words.  The Fuhrer never

said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet,

the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was

good.

79.

STAGE MANAGER

(off camera)

Get that curtain up.

LIEBKIND

NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up!

LIEBKIND

Stop!  Stop!

LIEBKIND

We have been betrayed!  I will

return!  I will returnnnnn...

ULLA

We make love?

BIALYSTOCK

No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go

to work.

80.

BIALYSTOCK

"Congratulations.  It's the biggest

hit on Broadway."

BIALYSTOCK

"Congratulations.  Hitler will run

forever."

BIALYSTOCK

(boiling with rage)

Congratulations!

BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!

BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!

BIALYSTOCK

Congratulations!

DE BRIS

(ecstatic)

Congratulations!  Have you seen the

reviews?  Have you seen the lines

at the box office?  It's a torrent,

it's an avalanche, it's the biggest

hit on Broadway!

81.

BIALYSTOCK

You lousy fruit.  You've ruined me!

DE BRIS

(shrieking)

Help!  Help!  He's crazy!  He's

going to kill me.  Call the police!

Call the police!  Help, help,

murder, murder, rape, rape!!!

BIALYSTOCK

(moaning)

How could this happen?  I was so

careful.  I picked the wrong play,

the wrong director, the wrong cast.

Where did I go right?  We forgot

one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler

always drew a crowd.

BIALYSTOCK

What are you doing?

BLOOM

(defensively)

Don't try to stop me.  I've made up

my mind.

BIALYSTOCK

What are you doing with those books?

Where are you going?

BLOOM

(with hysterical conviction)

I'm turning myself in.  It's the

only way.  I'm going to cooperate

with the authorities.  They'll

reduce my sentence and then there's

time off for good behavior.  And

maybe I'll get a job in the prison

library.  So long.

82.

BIALYSTOCK

(reasonably)

Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're

overwrought.  You don't know what

you're doing.  You're acting out of

panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!

BLOOM

I never should have listened to you.

BIALYSTOCK

I never should have listened to you.

BLOOM

Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

BIALYSTOCK

Double.  Double.  Double.

BIALYSTOCK

(clutching the books triumphantly)

Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!

BLOOM

(shrieking)

FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!

LIEBKIND

(off screen, outside door)

I am betrayed!

83.

LIEBKIND

(solemnly)

You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

You must die.

LIEBKIND

This is no good.  I'm not killing

you.  Don't you understand, you

have broken the Siegfried Oath.

You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!!

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

(together)

Come in.  Come in.

ULLA

I hear noise.  You call?

ULLA

Where are you?

ULLA

Ahhh.  I see you.  You like

something?  Coffee?

BIALYSTOCK

Coffee.  Yes.  That's a good idea.

(with great emphasis)

Why don't you ask the gentleman

with the gun... The gentleman who

is shooting at us... and trying to

kill us... what he will have.

84.

ULLA

(to Liebkind)

You like coffee?

LIEBKIND

Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars.

ULLA

Three coffees.  Two regular.  One

black... two sugars.

LIEBKIND

And now ve must resume hostilities.

Are you coming out from behind that

desk or not?

BIALYSTOCK

Not.

LIEBKIND

Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.

Clinging to life like baby

butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and

remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show

you how to die like a man!

LIEBKIND

(exhalted)

Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und

Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler.

I'm coming boys!

LIEBKIND

(in utter anguish)

Boy, vhen things go wrong!

85.

LIEBKIND

I'm a failure.  I'm a failure.  I'm

a failure.

BIALYSTOCK

Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day

playing hide-and-seek with a crazy

Kraut.

LIEBKIND

(still sobbing)

I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

BLOOM

There, there.

LIEBKIND

(looking around)

Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

BIALYSTOCK

(to Liebkind)

You crazy lunatic!  What are you

shooting at us for?  Why don't you

use this

(indicates gun)

where it will do us some good?  Why

don't you shoot the actors?

(the thought strikes home)

Liebkind, have I ever steered you

wrong?

LIEBKIND

Always.

BIALYSTOCK

Never mind.  Listen.  Every night

people are laughing at your beloved

Fuhrer.  Why?

LIEBKIND

It's that LSD und his verdampter

babies!...

86.

BIALYSTOCK

(handing him the gun

and some money)

Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill

them all!

BLOOM

What???

BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom)

Shut up.

LIEBKIND

Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy

the actors.

BLOOM

Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

BLOOM

(screaming)

Have you lost your mind?  What are

you talking about?  Kill the actors.

You can't kill the actors --

they're not animals, they're human

beings!

BIALYSTOCK

They are?  Have you ever eaten with

one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

BLOOM

Liebkind, no!

BIALYSTOCK

(to Bloom)

What are you doing?  We're trapped.

It's either the show or us.  There's

no way out.  What can we do, blow

up the theatre?

87.

LIEBKIND

(the surgeon at work)

Dynamite.

LIEBKIND

Fuse cap.

LIEBKIND

Fuse.

LIEBKIND

Thank you.

LIEBKIND

Gut.  Now for the master connection.

LIEBKIND

Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse?

BLOOM

There it is.

88.

LIEBKIND

(to Bloom)

Pick it up and bring it here, please.

BLOOM

Okay.

LIEBKIND

(anxiously)

Where are you going vit the light?

BLOOM

I need it.  How'm I gonna find the

fuse?

LIEBKIND

Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one

and all in the light.

LIEBKIND

Now ve take the two fuse leads,

attach them to the terminals of the

conductor and ve're in business.

BIALYSTOCK

(grinning)

You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

BLOOM

Max, I...

BIALYSTOCK

(irritated.  He has

not time for small talk)

What is it?

89.

BLOOM

Well, I... Well, it's just that...

I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

BIALYSTOCK

(smacking Bloom

affectionately on the shoulder)

Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

LIEBKIND

(mumbling to himself)

Plus to minus.  Negative to positive.

Male to...

BIALYSTOCK

Come on.  Let's get going.

LIEBKIND

Qviet.  Qviet  This is very

important.

LIEBKIND

Vait a minute.  Vait a minute.

Male to male?  Male to female?

Female to male?  Female to female?

Vait a minute.  In people, male to

female.  But electricity is strange.

It's male to male.

LIEBKIND

Sehr gut.

(to Bialystock)

Slow fuse, please.

LIEBKIND

Thank you.

LIEBKIND

(as he works)

Now ve take the slow fuse.  Tie one

end to the master connection and

the other ve attach to the detonator.

90.

LIEBKIND

Come, ve go to the detonator.

LIEBKIND

Vait a minute.  Are you sure this

is slow fuse?  It feels like qvick

fuse.

(to Bloom)

Shine your light on it.

LIEBKIND

I don't know.  I don't know.  The

markings are so similar.  Qvick

fuse or slow fuse?

LIEBKIND

I must find out.  It is critical.

LIEBKIND

Let's face it.  That was dumb.

LIEBKIND

Boys, vhere is you?

LIEBKIND

(seeing them)

Dot vas the qvick one.

BIALYSTOCK

We assumed that.

91.

LIEBKIND

Here.  You see.  This is the slow

fuse.  It is much wider.  It has

more resistance, more density.

Therefore, it burns slower.

BIALYSTOCK

You mean you had the slow fuse in

your pocket all the time and you

forgot to put it on?

LIEBKIND

Yes.  Amazing isn't it?

BIALYSTOCK

You stupid kraut!

LIEBKIND

Vhy do you always call me kraut?

Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you

hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not

franks!

BIALYSTOCK

All right.  Finish the job.  Let's

get outta here.

LIEBKIND

Und now for the final connection.

BIALYSTOCK

Wait.  I'll check to see if the

coast is clear.

BIALYSTOCK

The coast is clear!

LIEBKIND

Good.  Get down.

92.

LIEBKIND

Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye,

my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my

tortured testament of twisted truths.

BIALYSTOCK

Do it!  Do it!

LIEBKIND

I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a

demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a

monster... but it's still my child.

BIALYSTOCK

(quizzically)

Nothing.

LIEBKIND

Here is gut... of course, of course.

In electricity, it's always male to

female.  But with people, it's not

always so.  Come ve must go back.

BIALYSTOCK

Do you need us?

LIEBKIND

Of course I need you.  It's dark in

there.

BLOOM

Okay, okay.  Let's not waste time.

DRUNK

(off camera, singing)

"Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June,"

93.

DRUNK

"your silvery beams,

Will light love's dreams,"  What

the heck is that?  A bicycle pump?

Naaah.  Lemme see.  Could it be?

Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's

cotton gin... Naaah.  Aahh, I know

what it is.

DRUNK

Shine 'em up!

DRUNK

(bravely singing)

"Sa-an Fra-ancisco, open your

golden gates,

Don't let a stranger wait...

LIEBKIND

(mumbling through his bandages)

Male to male?  Male to female?

JUDGE

Has the jury reached a verdict?

94.

FOREMAN

We have, your honor.

JUDGE

(off camera)

How does the jury find?

FOREMAN

We find the defendants incredibly

guilty.

JUDGE

Will the defendants please rise and

approach the bench.

JUDGE

Do the defendants have anything to

say in their behalf before the

court pronounces sentence?

BLOOM

I would like to say a word, sir,

not on my behalf, but in behalf of

my partner, Max Bialystock.

JUDGE

Proceed.

BLOOM

Thank you, your honor.  Max

Bialystock is a very selfish man.

BIALYSTOCK

(whispers to Bloom)

Don't help me.

BLOOM

He's a liar and a cheat and a

scoundrel.  He's taken money from

little old ladies.  He's talked

people into doing things they never

would have dreamed of.  Especially

me.  But who has he really hurt?

(MORE)

95.

BLOOM (CONT'D)

Who are the victims?  Not me, I had

the most exciting adventure of my

life.  And what about the little

old ladies?  What would their lives

have been without Max Bialystock?

He made them feel wanted and young

and attractive again.

LITTLE OLD LADIES

(off camera, ad-lib)

"Oh, Max, Max, I love you Max."

"Let him go, let him go."

"Don't take my Bialy."

JUDGE

(rapping gavel)

Order.  Order.

BIALYSTOCK

And may I humbly add, your honor,

that we have learned our lesson and

we'll never do it again.

JUDGE

I will take that into consideration.

The defendants shall serve not more

than five and not less than two

years in the State Penitentiary.
