NEWSIES

FADE IN:

1   INT. THE NEW YORK WORLD - PRESS ROOM - MORNING                1

The huge printing PRESSES POUND out the morning edition,

setting a rhythm that carries us through the scene as the

newspapers are printed, collated, folded, and spit out

onto a rapidly-growing stack.

Pressmen bundle the papers and toss them into carts.        See

the masthead: "THE NEW YORK WORLD, JULY 10, 1899."

Two men push hard a cart loaded with papers to get it

rolling down an iron ramp -- then have to run to keep up

with it as it careens toward --

2   INT. THE WORLD - CIRCULATION ROOM - MORNING (SAME TIME)       2

Broad-necked workmen grab the carts and begin unloading

them -- stacks of paper grow as the POUNDING RHYTHM BUILDS

and we GO TO --

3   INT. NEWSIE LODGING HOUSE - SAME TIME                         3

A man's feet move up some stairs (in rhythm) -- they

belong to KLOPPMAN, 70s, who enters --

4   INT. NEWSIE LODGING HOUSE - DORMITORY - SAME TIME             4

A large room filled with boys sleeping in hammocks,

including JACK KELLY, snapping his fingers in his sleep.

On the wall by his head, the commanding visage of Teddy

Roosevelt grins down from a rotogravure photo. Kloppman

wakes the boys, intoning his morning ritual:

KLOPPMAN

Ink's wet, the presses are rolling,

the papers are stacking -- rise

and shine, make a dime, no news

without the Newsies -- etc.

Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below.

JACK

Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is

waitin'.

CRUTCHY

(yawning)

Tell Mr. Pulitzer my yacht was

lost at sea.

Jack laughs and tosses him his crutch. The dorm is now

alive with waking boys -- yawning, stretching, pulling

on pants, hitching up suspenders as they sing --

SONG: "CARRYIN' THE BANNER" (Approx. 7 minutes, 15

seconds)

RACETRACK

THAT'S MY CIGAR...

SNIPESHOOTER

YOU'LL STEAL ANUDDER.

The boys begin to wake,                          KID BLINK

yawning, stretching,                HEY BUMMERS, WE GOT WORK TO DO

complaining as they hit

the floor: pants pulled                         SPECS

on, suspenders hitched             SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME

up, boots laced tight.               MY MUDDER?

CRUTCHY

AH, STOP YOUR BAWLIN'

ALL

WHO AST YOU!

MUSH, cross-eyed and skinny with big ears and lisp, play-

fully pushes the NEWSIE so he falls on his hammock.

NEWSIE

Hey, whattaya?

5   INT. WASHROOM - MINUTES LATER                                     5

Younger boys pump water for       older boys, then trade off.

Teeth brushing, sponge baths       with cold water -- the older

boys shave. Jack smears his        face with shaving cream as

Mush pulls up a box next to       him.

MUSH

How'd you sleep, Jack?

JACK

On me back, Mush.

MUSH

(thinks that's

hilarious)

You hear that, you hear what he

said? I ast how'd he sleep --

CRUTCHY

Jack, this look like I'm fakin'

He hobbles towards Jack on one crutch.

JACK

Who says you're fakin' it?

CRUTCHY

The streets are fulla fakes these

days -- it's hurtin' the rep of

genuine articles like myself. I

gotta find me a new sellin' spot,

where they ain't used to seein'

Jack smiles; Mush taps

Crutchy on the arm... sings.

Jack spots a passing wagon and helps Crutchy on board --

he and Mush jump on for the ride and they all move off --

KID BLINK, 16, one eye covered by a patch, moves past a

fruit stand with three of his boys. He's about to swipe

a banana when the shadow of a cop on horseback looms over

him. Blink smiles up at the COP.

KID BLINK

'Mornin', Officer.

OFFICER (COP)

I'm keepin' my eye on you, Blink.

KID BLINK

And I'll keep my eye on you, too,

sir.

Newsies jostle for position at the window -- David

shoving and jostling like the rest. He manages to elbow

in near the front. Les, hanging back, has his eyes on --

-- Jack sauntering coolly to his natural place at the

head of the line, flanked by Boots and Mush. He leans

on the counter and grins at the rodent-faced man inside

the window: WEASEL, 40.

Ya miss me, Weasel?

You know my name -- it's Weisel.

turns and scans.  Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks.

Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel

with a fifty-cent piece.

JACK

The usual.

Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            *

grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop.

scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy,

the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S.

You callin' me a liar, kid...?

David's sweating, aware that all eyes are on him.                      *

DAVID

I want that other paper.

The Delanceys start for David when suddenly Jack steps                 *

up, slams his hand on David's papers, closes his eyes                  *

and does a flip-count. The expert.                                     *

Nineteen, Weasel. An honest

mistake -- on account of Oscar                            *

Hold it.   Race -- spot me two-bits.

Race flips him a coin.     Jack slaps it on the counter.

JACK

Another fifty for my friend here.

DAVID

I don't want another fifty -- !

JACK

Sure you do. Every newsie wants

more papes.

David, puzzled, grabs the papers and he and Les run

after Jack --

Les. This is David, he's my

JACK

No kiddin'. How old are you,

Les?

LES

Near ten.

JACK

No good. Anybody asks, you're

Younger sells more papes, Les --

DAVID

JACK

You owe me two bits, right? Okay,

David is incredulous, but Les is pleading.      David sighs.

DAVID

Gotta split fifty-fifty.

JACK

Sixty-forty.   Or I forget the whole

t'ing.

David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his

palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack

already being the mentor --

JACK

The name of the game is volume, Dave.

You only took twenty papes -- why?

DAVID

Bad headline...?

JACK

First t'ing you gotta learn --

headlines don't sell papes, newsies

sell papes. We're what holds this

A hand smashes the paper onto an ornate desk beyond which

cower three harried employees of The World, including

SEITZ, 45, the hard-bitten business manager. BUNSEN, the

editor, and JONATHAN, an accountant.

SEITZ

The news is slow, Chief, the

Trolley Strike's all we got --

PULITZER (O.S.)

It's all Mr. William Randolph

Hearst has, too -- see how he

covers the strike!

The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York

Journal with a large black headline: "NUDE CORPSE ON

RAILS -- NOT CONNECTED TO TROLLEY STRIKE." The CAMERA

COMES AROUND to reveal JOSEPH PULITZER, himself, a

thundering presence in smoked-glasses and a beard,

wielding the magnifying glass like a gavel of judgment.

PULITZER

Hearst is killing us in the

circulation war -- and you give

me headlines that would put a

whirling dervish to sleep!

BUNSEN

We'll get a new headline writer,

Mr. Pulitzer.

PULITZER

Steal Hearst's man -- offer him

double what Hearst pays.

SEITZ

That's how he stole him from us.

Chief, you spend as much as you

make fighting Hearst. That's why

the paper's losing money --

PULITZER

David sees TWO LOVERS kissing on the steps of a building

Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David

something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still

kissing.

him across the plank.

No?   What're they doin' then?

Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David,

Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit --

ESTHER

MAYER

I've had enough birthdays!    This

is a celebration!

David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious

chocolate cake from a cabinet --

DAVID

It's only the beginning -- the

longer I work, the more I'll make --

MAYER

You work only until I go back to

the factory! Then you go back to

school, like you promised.

All activity stops, an awkward silence.       Mayer looks at

his bandaged hand.

MAYER

It will heal... they'll give me

back my job... I'll make them...

Jack sees how worried the family is.       No one seems able

to speak, then --

LES

(in his sleep)

'Gimme all ya got, baby...'

The family is shocked -- except for Jack and David, who

sputter into laughter. The celebration is restored --

Jack digs into an enormous slab of cake, looking around

at the smiling faces, for the moment feeling he

belongs...

Actual income, as well as

projected income, against actual

operating costs, as well as

projected operating costs, produce

a reduced marginality of profit

PULITZER

Of course I need to make more money!

But how do I make more money, you

bloodless blot?

JONATHAN

(unflappable)

I have several proposals. The

first is to increase the paper's

price --

PULITZER

Then Hearst undersells me and I'm

in the poorhouse. Brilliant.

JONATHAN

Not the customer price -- the

price to the distribution

apparatus.

Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation.

SEITZ

You mean the Newsies...? Charge

the Newsies more for their papers?

Bad idea, Chief.

JONATHAN

Very well. My next proposal --

salary cuts, particularly those

at the very top --

PULITZER

Wait. What  do the Newsies pay

now -- fifty cents per hundred

papers? If  you raised it to

sixty cents --

JONATHAN

A mere tenth of a cent per paper --

PULITZER

-- then that, multiplied by forty

thousand papers a day, seven days

a week -- well, it would pay some

of the bills around here.

SEITZ

Chief, if you do this, every

Newsie we got will head straight

for Hearst.

PULITZER

Not necessarily. As newspapermen,

Hearst and I would cut each other's

throats to get the best of the

other. But as businessmen -- and

gentlemen -- we often agree on

ways to keep down certain operating

costs. If I know Willie Hearst,

he's going to wish he thought of

this himself.

SEITZ

What about the other papers -- ?

PULITZER

If we do it, they'll all do it.

It's only a tenth of a cent --

nobody gets hurt! It's good for

the Newsies -- an incentive, make

'em work harder, sell more papers!

Now get me Hearst on that

contraption.

Doesn't it scare you going up

New York?

JACK

Yeah, lookit me, I'm tremblin'.

DENTON

Keep me informed -- I want to

know everything that happens.

DAVID

Are we really an important story...?

DENTON

What's important? A year ago I

covered the war in Cuba -- charging

up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy

Roosevelt. A very important story.

Now it doesn't seem so important --

except Teddy's our governor and

probably on his way to the White

House. Is the Newsies' strike

important? It all depends on you.

JACK

My name really gonna be in the

Any objections?

On a rotted and collapsing pier is a battered sign:

"BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED." Hunched under the pier

is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on --

-- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through

the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like

hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in

front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier.

David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the

harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly.

From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome.

He looks them up and down, then grins. He is SPOT

CONLON.

SPOT

If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack

be quick.

Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own.

JACK

You're movin' up in the world,

Spot -- got a ocean view and

everything.

Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more

nervous.

SPOT

So I'm hearin' things from little

birdies in Harlem and Queens and

all over. They're chirpin' in my

ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are

playin' like they're goin' on

strike -- '

DAVID

(blurting)

We're not playing -- we are on

strike -- it's --

Spot's eyes click like switchblades in David's direction

-- so do his henchmen's.

What's this, Jackie boy?   Some

kind of walkin' mouth?

It's a mouth with a brain -- and

David looks at Jack wide-eyed: "Me?" Scared to death,

he starts -- as Spot's henchmen begin circling him like

jackals.

DAVID

Uh... we started the strike but...

we can't do it alone, so... we've

been talkin' to Newsies all over

the city...

SPOT

So they told me. And what did

they tell you?

David looks nervously at the circling henchmen.

DAVID

That... they're all waiting to see

what Spot Conlon does. That you're

the key...

(as Spot puffs

himself up; David

sees an opening)

That Spot Conlon is the most

respected and... famous... newsie

in New York... and probably

everywhere else...

Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling; waits for

more, lapping it up.

DAVID

And... if Spot Conlon joins the

strike, they'll join and we'll be

unstoppable so you gotta join and

... well... you gotta...

He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack.

SPOT

You're right. Brains.

(hardens)

But I got brains, too -- and more

than half-a-one. How do I know

you punks won't run the first

SPOT

Not good enough, Jackie-boy.   You

He turns and walks away. David and Boots exhale in

relief -- but Jack suddenly grabs a rope hanging from

the wharf and swings in front of Spot.

JACK

Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty-

boy --

(as Spot freezes)

-- or maybe you traded 'em to some

chicken for that beak of yours.

(in Spot's face)

Maybe you gotta show me you ain't

afraid to join the strike.

Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed;

the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are

locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then

Spot grins.

SPOT

Nice try, pal. But that's just what

I'm talkin' about.

Show me this strike ain't just some

With a bucket of red paint, Crutchy paints a portrait of

Pulitzer on an old bedsheet. Around him, Newsies roll

hoops, play marbles, tag, leap-frog, etc. Looks like

more of a holiday than a strike. Jack, David, Boots

return from Brooklyn.

shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment.

Jack looks up as David points excitedly to the roofs

hoist into the square. He grins as Jack runs up --

His eloquence is spellbinding; the Newsies are silent,

looking at him with new respect. Then, from somewhere,

there is a smattering of APPLAUSE. They look to see --

-- At the door,      the group of reporters applauding --

guilty applause      maybe, but still applause. One of them

takes a dollar      and puts it in the box marked NEWSIES

STRIKE FUND --      another follows suit, then another, and

another...

Jack and the Newsies watch -- then Jack begins to applaud

the reporters. The Newsies join in, clapping, whistling,

as the reporters hurry out, feeling a little better about

themselves.

stumbles around as David hangs on in a wild piggyback

pulls her little brother away as --

disappear -- straight down   the trap door that's suddenly

opened beneath their feet.    Jack sees Spot at a lever in

the dressing room stairs. MacSwain nabs him, they're

struggling; suddenly, at the top of the stairs --

up, startled)

I said hands off the kid, you red-

out!

David twists away as MacSwain backs stumblingly down the

stairs as Medda descends on him in full fury.

MEDDA

If you're tired of beating up

children, maybe you'd like to try

a lady next.

Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her --

then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away.

MEDDA

Run, David, hurry --

DAVID

They got Jack --

MEDDA

You can't help him if you're in

jail, too! You were right, David

-- you've got to keep fighting

back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over

her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes...

128A   EXT. NEARBY STREET/STONE PILLAR - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)        128A

At the pillar, Jack stops running.

DAVID

Why're you stoppin' -- we've got

to run!

JACK

You shouldn't'a done this, David.

They could put you in jail --

DAVID

It's worth it -- let's go --

JACK

You go to jail, what happens to

your family? You don't know

nothin' about jail! Thanks for

what you done, but you gotta get

outta here --

DAVID

I don't understand --

JACK

I don't either -- I don't

understand nothin' no more!

Jack pushes David down the street.

CUT TO:

128B   INT. HOUSE OF REFUGE                                           128B

As Jack steps back into the light, the CAMERA WIDENS and

we realize he's back in the House of Refuge. Jack begins

to sing softly: REPRISE: "SANTA FE."

Jack sits in a small dark room -- an isolation room;

moonlight shines through barred windows; there's a door

with a small serving panel in it.

JACK

SANTA FE

MY OLD FRIEND

I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE

HIDIN'

YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S

GUIDIN' ME TODAY

Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy

peers through, offering him something furtively: a

boiled potato.

CRUTCHY

Snitched it offa Snyder's plate

when I was servin' him -- the

biggest one!

(as Jack shakes his

head, looks away)

Snyder was eatin' good tonight --

the stuff we don't never get?                            *

Patatas... olives...

(mouth watering)

... liver and bacon. Sauerkraut...

(grins)

Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.

JACK

(irritably)

So what's it git'cha?

CRUTCHY

Anudder three months, prob'ly.

But you can't let 'em beat'cha,

right, Jack?

JACK

We was beat when we was born.

Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel.

ushering in two policemen.

A policeman stands aside and Jack enters, in the new

suit. Utter silence. The police escort him the length

of the dorm and into --

Jack goes straight to his hiding place and removes the

box. He looks inside and is startled --

-- a dead rat is inside the box, covered with tiny pieces

of the photograph with his family. His money is gone.

He tosses the box aside; his eyes hardening. The police

escort him back into --

stands holding a bundle of Jack's belongings: he shoves

it into Jack's chest and does his Delancey routine.

(NOTE: During the above, several QUICK CUTS or DISSOLVES

should give the impression that they've worked through

the night:)

A)   Lead type being rapidly hand-set by Denton, helped

by David -- a sub-headline forms: "House of Refuge,

House of Shame."

B)   Papers -- "THE NEWSIE NEWS" -- start rolling off the

press as they examine it proudly.

C)   They fold and bundle the papers, happy but exhausted.

D)   Pale pre-dawn light shines through the window framing

Les as they pass him bundles of papers and he passes

them out the window to --

166A   EXT. WORLD BUILDING - PRE-DAWN                              166A

MUSIC CONTINUES. Race, Boots, Blink, Mush take the

papers from Les and toss them into Kloppman's wagon --

he's on the driver's seat, keeping a lookout. Sarah                *

climbs out the window, followed by the others. The last            *

out is Jack -- carrying his belongings in a rolled bundle          *

Jack laughs -- the tension breaks.    Hugs and backslaps

as they climb onto the wagon.

He points frantically at Weasel crossing the square

towards them. They duck quickly -- and he weaves past

whistling tunelessly, drunk. As Kloppman eases the

wagon away, everybody looks back, shouts --

He looks around blearily:    must be the d.t.'s.

185A   HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF THE NEWSIE NEWS (OPTICAL)            185A

swirl and cascade, FILLING the SCREEN as we see

SUPERIMPOSED a series of living portraits of the

working children of the 1890s... young boys in too-

large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails...

holding picks and shovels far too large for them...

girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing...

shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning

to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that

the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the

SCREEN: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY!

We see that same headline across --

185B   INT. MANSION - BACK OF MAN'S HEAD - MORNING                185B

as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a

butler (the Rough Rider) in a khaki uniform. He's

reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME"

with a subhead beneath it: "SCANDAL HIDDEN FROM TEDDY

ON VISIT." We glimpse a famous walrus mustache as the

Man slams his fist on the table in anger. A figure steps

INTO FRAME across the table: Denton.

DENTON

I thought you'd feel that way,

Governor Roosevelt.

TEDDY ROOSEVELT (MAN)

Dis-graceful, Denty! Those poor

boys -- and I did nothing!

(pure steel)

Until now!

The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded

walking stick. Teddy snatches them as if they were

armor.

187    EXT. NEWSIE SQUARE - DAY                                   187

Our Newsies look anxiously around the square, empty

except for them. They take pains to conceal Jack among

them.

MUSH

So when's the others comin',

Cowboy?

Jack looks glumly at the empty square; at the gates of

the World where Weasel and his goons are beginning to

line up, clubs in hand.

PULITZER

(not listening)

Kelly's down there. He should be

back in jail.

SEITZ

(with the Newsie

News)

Those kids got out a pretty good

paper, Chief.

PULITZER

Too good! Those illiterate

guttersnipes couldn't have done

this on their own. Somebody's

behind this, trying to pull a

fast one...

JONATHAN

Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants

to know if you've read the Newsies'

paper?

Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone.

MAYOR

I'm not taking the heat for this --

you've got to talk to them --

settle it --

PULITZER

Tell Hearst I'm busy!

(ominously)

I'll settle it all right -- once

and for all.

188A   EXT. WORLD BUILDING - DAY                                     188A

The huge doors of the World Building open and Seitz

marches out, flanked by guards. The crowd opens a path

as he marches up to Jack and David.

SEITZ

It's time to talk.

business with no office boys.    We

talk to old Joe hisself or we

don't talk. Period.

The Newsies love it. Seitz stiffles a smile at Jack's

bravado -- a smile of admiration.

SEITZ

Then I guess you talk.

Jack beckons David to follow as they enter the huge

doors and --

188B   INT. PULITZER'S OFFICE - MORE HUGE DOORS - DAY               188B

open as Seitz ushers them inside, closes the doors,

leaving them alone. Pulitzer waits by the windows, a

looming shadowy figure; sounds of CHANTING, SHOUTING

floating up from below. David is awed by the palatial

office, but Jack saunters coolly to the windows past --

PULITZER

You're going to listen to me,

boy --

JACK

I'd like to, Joe --

(opens a window;

crowd noise pours

in)

-- but I can't hear ya.

PULITZER

We had a deal -- you broke it.

You're going back to jail.

JACK

Maybe. But you can't put every

kid in that square in jail. They

ain't goin' away, Joe.

PULITZER

Neither am I. I can wait them

out. It won't be me that's hurt.

JACK

You sure about that?

He nods at David who produces a paper, reads:

DAVID

'Since the strike, the World's

circulation has dropped 70 per

cent; advertising has been cut

in half -- '

(stops reading)

Every day you lose thousands of

dollars -- just so you can beat

us out of a lousy tenth of a cent

per paper. Why?

JACK

It ain't about money, Dave -- if

Joe gives in, that would mean

nothin's like us got power. He

can't let that happen -- no matter

what it costs him. Right, Joe?

PULITZER

I'm about to show you what power

really is...

He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS --

PULITZER

I have the police outside waiting

to arrest you --

DAVID

You lousy double-crossing -- !

PULITZER

-- then I'll deal with that rabble

in the street.

He's crossing to a buzzer on his desk; Jack, thinking

fast, snatches up a copy of the Newsies News.

JACK

Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one

thing, willya? How'd ya like our

paper -- nice printin', ain't it?

Right off the presses of one of

New York's greatest newspapers --

That stops him.    He looks at Jack, frowning.

PULITZER

All the papers have an agreement...

we print nothing about the

newsies. Whose press did you use?

(as Jack shrugs,

smiles)

It was Hearst, wasn't it...!

Hearst? Nah, it was yo --

David quickly stops him, seeing the gleam in Pulitzer's

eyes.

PULITZER

I knew it. Whoever helped you

print this lying rag is trying to

break the strike, get the jump on

the rest of us. Well, you're

going to expose this backstabber

to the other owners -- in

exchange, I'll call off the

police.

Jack and David exchange glances, seeing an opening --

JACK

Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal

with our demands. Otherwise, our

lips are sealed.

PULITZER

(impatiently)

All right, all right -- just say

the traitor's name. It's Hearst,

isn't it? Say it! Say the name

of the scoundrel whose press you

used so I can make him the

disgrace of the newspaper world!

Say his name, damn you!

He thunders over them, eyes blazing in triumph. The

boys say nothing, just smile up at him knowingly until

at last the horrible truth begins to dawn and --

JACK

We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.'

(as he stares,

stunned)

And Hearst and them other owners?

Maybe they don't have to know.

Depends.

Pulitzer walks with stiff dignity to the window; from

below, the FAINT CHANTING floats seems deafening to his

ears.

PULITZER

Perhaps we can resolve our...

small differences.

David digs out their demands and prepares to read.
