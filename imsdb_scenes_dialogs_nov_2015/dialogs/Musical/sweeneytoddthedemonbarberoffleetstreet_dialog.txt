1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1

Foreboding organ music is heard...

We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an

alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory?

... we're not sure...

The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination...

The ominous organ music continues as...

From the bottom of the frame...

A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up

the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected

in the blood...

Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

SUDDENLY--

A shrill factory whistle blows--

ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --

the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory

whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring

inferno; a human scream--

And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool

of blood.

He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and

matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat.

The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right

side up as--

GENTLEMAN

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.

His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

He shaved the faces of gentlemen

Who never thereafter were heard of again.

He trod a path that few have trod,

Did Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before

us. Strangely impassive.

We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a

world of silhouettes and shadows.

Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the

hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund

and sleek. Impressive muttonchops.

BANKER

He kept a shop in London town,

Of fancy clients and good renown,

And what if none of their souls were saved?

They went to their maker impeccably shaved...

More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the

Gentleman and the Banker as...

BANKER

By Sweeney,

By Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact,

GHOSTS.

GHOSTS

Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!

Hold it to the skies!

Freely flows the blood of those

Who moralize!

As they continue, the new figures become more distinct...

THE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a

crimson imperial uniform...

GENERAL

His needs were few, his room was bare:

THE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical

attire...

PRIEST

A lavabo and a fancy chair...

THE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting

suit...

TOURIST

A mug of suds and a leather strop,

An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop...

THE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious

long hair...

STUDENT

For neatness he deserves a nod,

Does Sweeney Todd...

GENTLEMAN

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

The ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around

this mysterious world...

GHOSTS

(variously)

Inconspicuous Sweeney was,

Quick and quiet and clean `e was.

Back of his smile, under his word,

Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.

Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned,

Like a perfect machine 'e planned,

Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,

Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle...

The specters are becoming more insistent, their strange

impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red

flame becomes an inferno--

GHOSTS

(variously)

Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,

Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle.

Inconspicuous Sweeney was,

Quick and quiet and clean 'e was,

Like a perfect machine 'e was,

Was Sweeney!

Sweeney!

Sweeney!

Sweeeeeneeeeey!

On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly

Furies--

To discover--

SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure,

silhouetted in blazing red flames.

We slowly push in on him as:

GHOSTS

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.

He served a dark and a vengeful god.

What happened then--

GENTLEMAN

Well, who's to say?

BANKER

And he wouldn't want us to give it away,

GHOSTS

(variously)

Not Sweeney,

Not Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd...

Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we

slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported

to...

2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2

ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail

of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails

behind him. The cries of sailors echo.

Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are

looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as

Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...

London.

Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and

mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in

relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping

toward its prey.

Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and

magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The

gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The

black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from

a thousand chimneys.

London. Sulfurous London.

Anthony is awestruck.

ANTHONY

I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders

From the Dardanelles

To the mountains of Peru,

But there's no place like London--!

Then--

Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--

TODD

No, there's no place like London.

ANTHONY

Mr. Todd...?

TODD

You are young.

Life has been kind to you.

You will learn.

Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the

approaching city.

3   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             3

Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the

shadowy figures on the docks.

Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the

scale and aura of the city.

ANTHONY

Lord ... takes your breath away,

doesn't it?

Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.

TODD

There's a hole in the world

Like a great black pit

And the vermin of the world

Inhabit it

And its morals aren't worth

What a pig could spit

And it goes by the name Of London.

At the top of the hole

Sit the privileged few

Making mock of the vermin

In the lower zoo,

Turning beauty into filth and greed.

I too

Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders

For the cruelty of men

Is as wondrous as Peru,

But there's no place like London!

Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction

to the city.

TODD

I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My

mind is far from easy. In these once

familiar streets I feel shadows

everywhere...

ANTHONY

Shadows...?

TODD

Ghosts.

Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:

TODD

There was a barber and his wife,

And she was beautiful,

A foolish barber and his wife,

She was his reason and his life,

And she was beautiful,

And she was virtuous.

And he was...

(a breath)

Naive.

Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...

4   EXT. FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                         4

...Fifteen years before.

Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded

flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries

their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.

Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.

Chatting with his wife. Happy.

TODD (V.O.)

There was another man who saw

That she was beautiful,

A pious vulture of the law,

Who with a gesture of his claw

Removed the barber from his plate.

Then there was nothing but to wait

And she would fall,

So soft,

So young,

So lost,

And oh, so beautiful!

(CONTINUED)

PAGE 7.

4   CONTINUED:                                                    4

During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a

saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches

of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.

With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The

Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered

face never quite disguising his lethality.

The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the

Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The

Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.

And we return to...

5   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             5

Music continues.

ANTHONY

And the lady, sir ... did she succumb?

TODD

Oh, that was many years ago...

I doubt if anyone would know.

A quiet beat.

TODD

I owe you my life, Anthony. If you

hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on

the ocean still ... Thank you.

Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.

ANTHONY

Will I see you again?

TODD

You might find me, if you like, around

Fleet Street.

ANTHONY

Until then, my friend.

He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes.

Then Todd quickly turns and goes.

Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall

that hangs over his friend.

PAGE 8.

6   EXT. STREET -- MORNING                                         6

Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling

within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:

TODD

There's a hole in the world

Like a great black pit

And it's filled with people

Who are filled with shit

And the vermin of the world

Inhabit it...

He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--

7   EXT. LONDON ASSAULT -- DAY                                     7

--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at

lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards

-- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London

at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending

us hurtling to--

8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8

Fleet Street.

We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty

and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to

it. Imposing and dead at the same time.

There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened

second floor room with a window overlooking the street.

The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in

front of the shop, considering it deeply.

The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and

then gone.

Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...

9   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           9

Behind the dusty counter is...

MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her

40's.

She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with

a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her

face.

9   CONTINUED:                                                    9

The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --

her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of

prey:

MRS. LOVETT

A customer!

Todd is startled, starts to go--

MRS. LOVETT

Wait! What's yer rush?

What's yer hurry?

(She sticks the knife into

the counter)

You gave me such a--

(Wipes her hands on her

apron) )

Fright. I thought you was a ghost.

Half a minute, can'tcher?

Sit!

Sit ye down!

(An order)

Sit!

(He obeys)

All I meant is that I

Haven't seen a customer for weeks.

Did you come here for a pie, sir?

(Todd nods. She flicks a

bit of dust off a pie

with a rag)

Do forgive me if me head's a little vague--

Ugh!

(She plucks something off

the pie, examines it)

What is that?

But you'd think we had the plague--

(She drops it on the floor

and stamps on it)

From the way that people--

(She flicks something off

the pie with her finger)

Keep avoiding--

(Spotting it moving)

No, you don't!

(She smacks it with her

hand)

Heaven knows I try, sir!

(Lifts her hand, looks at

it)

Tsk!

(She wipes it on the edge

of the counter)

But there's no one comes in even to inhale--

(CONTINUED)

9   CONTINUED: (2)                                                9

Tsk!

(She blows the last dust

off the pie as she brings

it to him)

Right you are, sir. Would you like a drop of ale?

(Todd nods)

Mind you, I can't hardly blame them--

(Pouring a tankard of ale)

These are probably the worst pies in London.

I know why nobody cares to take them--

I should know,

I make them.

But good? No,

The worst pies in London--

Even that's polite.

The worst pies in London--

If you doubt it, take a bite.

(He does. It's horrible)

Is that just disgusting?

You have to concede it.

It's nothing but crusting--

Here, drink this, you'll need it--

(She gives him the ale)

The worst pies in London.

During the following, she slams lumps of dough on the counter

and rolls them out, grunting frequently as she goes:

MRS. LOVETT

And no wonder with the price of meat

What it is--

(Grunt)

When you get it.

(Grunt)

Never

(Grunt)

Thought I'd live to see the day

Men'd think it was a treat

Finding poor

(Grunt)

Animals

(Grunt)

Wot are dying in the street.

Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop,

Does a business, but I noticed something weird--

Lately all her neighbors' cats have disappeared.

(Shrugs)

Have to hand it to her--

Wot I calls

Enterprise,

Popping pussies into pies.

Wouldn't do in my shop--

Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick.

And I'm telling you them pussy cats is quick.

(Leans on counter,

exhausted)

No denying times is hard, sir -- Even harder than

The worst pies in London.

Only lard and nothing more--

(As Todd gamely tries

another mouthful)

Is that just revolting?

All greasy and gritty,

It looks like it's molting,

And tastes like--

Well, pity

A woman alone

With limited wind

And the worst pies in London!

(Sighs heavily)

Ah sir,

Times is hard. Times is hard.

MRS. LOVETT

Trust me, dearie, it's going to take

more than ale to wash that taste out.

Come with me and we'll get you a nice

tumbler of gin.

MRS. LOVETT

There's a good boy, now you sit down

and warm your bones, you look chilled

through.

TODD

Isn't that a room over the shop? If

times are so hard, why don't you rent

it out?

MRS. LOVETT

Up there? Oh, no one will go near

it...

MRS. LOVETT

People think it's haunted.

TODD

Haunted?

MRS. LOVETT

And who's to say they're wrong? ...

You see, years ago, something happened

up there. Something not very nice...

MRS. LOVETT

There was a barber and his wife,

And he was beautiful,

A proper artist with a knife,

But they transported him for life.

(Sighs)

And he was beautiful...

Foolishness.

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

He had this wife, you see,

Pretty little thing,

Silly little nit

Had her chance for the moon on a string--

Poor thing. Poor thing.

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

There was this Judge, you see,

Wanted her like mad,

Every day he'd send her a flower,

But did she come down from her tower?

Sat up there and sobbed by the hour,

Poor fool.

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

Ah, but there was worse yet to come,

Poor thing.

Poor thing, poor thing.

The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite,

He blames himself for her dreadful plight

She must come straight to his house tonight!

Poor thing, poor thing.

13   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- BALLROOM -- FLASHBACK -- NIGHT       13

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

Of course, when she goes there,

Poor thing, poor thing,

They're having this ball all in masks.

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

There's no one she knows there,

Poor dear, poor thing,

She wanders tormented, and drinks,

Poor thing.

The Judge has repented, she thinks,

Poor thing.

"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks.

MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

He was there, all right--

Only not so contrite!

She wasn't no match for such craft, you see,

They figured she had to be daft, you see,

So all of `em stood there and laughed, you see,

Poor soul!

Poor thing!

NOOOOOOOO...!

TODD

Would no one have mercy on her?

MRS. LOVETT

So it is you -- Benjamin Barker.

TODD

Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?!

MRS. LOVETT

She poisoned herself. Arsenic from the

apothecary on the corner. I tried to

stop her but she wouldn't listen to

me. And he's got your daughter.

TODD

He? Judge Turpin?

MRS. LOVETT

Adopted her like his own.

Fifteen years of sweating in a living

hell on a false charge. Fifteen years

No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's

have his revenge.

TODD

Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay

TODD

First I must have my shop back.

Cracked in the head, wasn't I?

MRS. LOVETT

Those handles is chased silver, ain't

Silver, yes...

These are my friends,

See how they glisten.

razor)

See this one shine,

How he smiles in the light.

My friend, my faithful friend.

feeling the edge with his

thumb) )

Speak to me friend,

You there, my friend,

Come, let me hold you.

Now, with a sigh

You grow warm

In my hand,

Rest now, my friends.

Soon I'll unfold you.

Ooh, Mr. Todd,

You're warm

In my hand.

You've come home.

Always had a fondness for you,

Till now your shine

Was merely silver.

Friends,

You shall drip rubies,

You'll soon drip precious

Rubies...

His voice was soft, his manner mild.

He seldom laughed but he often smiled,

He'd seen how civilized men behave.

JOHANNA

Green finch and linnet bird,

Nightingale, blackbird,

How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate,

Sitting in cages,

Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits,

Beckoning, beckoning,

Just beyond the bars.

How can you remain,

Staring at the rain,

Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing

Anything?

How is it you sing?

JOHANNA

My cage has many rooms,

Damask and dark.

Nothing there sings,

Not even my lark.

Larks never will, you know,

When they're captive.

Green finch and linnet bird,

Thank yer, sir, thank yer.

That's the great Judge Turpin's house

That's Johanna, his pretty little

ANTHONY

Yes, it's terribly large on the map

but I keep getting lost...

JUDGE

Sit down, lad, sit down.

ANTHONY

It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose

his bearings, but, well, there you

are.

JUDGE

A sailor, eh?

ANTHONY

Yes, sir. The "Bountiful" out of

Plymouth.

JUDGE

(handing him a snifter of

brandy)

A sailor must know the ways of the

world, yes? ... Must be practiced in

the ways of the world ... Would you

say you are practiced, boy?

ANTHONY

Sir?

JUDGE

Oh, yes ... such practices ... the

geishas of Japan ... the concubines of

Siam .. the catamites of Greece ...

the harlots of India ... I have them

all here ... Drawings of them ....

Oh, I think not. You gandered at my

... Yes, sir, you gandered.

ANTHONY

(glancing nervously back

at the Beadle)

I meant no harm--

JUDGE

Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me:

if I see your face again on this

Well, ladies and gentlemen,

From now on you can waken at ease.

You need never again have a worry or care,

I will show you a miracle marvelous rare,

Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose

From Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

GENTLEMAN, STUDENT AND TOURIST

See your razor gleam, Sweeney,

Feel how well it fits

As it floats across the throats

Of hypocrites.

35   INT. OLD BAILEY -- DAY                                        35

JUDGE

This is the second time, sir, that you

have been brought before this bench.

Though it is my earnest wish to ever

temper justice with mercy, your

persistent dedication to a life of

crime is an abomination before God and

man.

JUDGE

I therefore sentence you to hang by

the neck until you are dead and may

the Lord have mercy on your soul.

JUDGE

This court is adjourned.

36   EXT. -- STREET -- OUTSIDE THE OLD BAILEY -- DAY               36

BEADLE

Thank you, your Honor. Just the

sentence we wanted.

JUDGE

Was he guilty?

BEADLE

Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely

done something to warrant a hanging.

JUDGE

(quietly)

What man has not?

BEADLE

Sir?

JUDGE

No matter -- Come, walk home with me.

I have news for you, my friend. In

order to shield her from the evils of

this world, I have decided to marry my

dear Johanna.

BEADLE

Ah, sir, happy news indeed.

JUDGE

Strange, though, when I offered myself

to her she showed a certain ...

reluctance.

BEADLE

Excuse me, my lord,

May I request, my lord,

Permission, my lord, to speak?

Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,

You're looking less than your best, my lord,

There's powder upon your vest, my lord.

And stubble upon your cheek,

And ladies, my lord, are weak.

JUDGE

Stubble, you say? Perhaps at times I

am a little overhasty with my morning

ablutions...

BEADLE

(cheerily)

Fret not though, my lord,

I know a place, my lord,

A barber, my lord, of skill.

Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord,

Some eau de cologne to brace my lord

And musk to enhance the chase, my lord,

You'll dazzle the girl until

She bows to your every will.

JUDGE

A barber, eh? Take me to him.

I am honored, my lord. His name is

Todd ... Sweeney Todd. And he is the

MRS. LOVETT

You ought to slow down a bit, lad.

It'll go to your head.

TOBY

Weaned on the stuff, I was. They used

to give it to us at the workhouse,

so's we could sleep. Not that you'd

ever want to sleep in that place,

ma'am. Not with the things wot happen

in the dark.

MRS. LOVETT

That's nice, dear ... I think I'll

just pop in on Mr. Todd for a tick.

You'll be all right here?

TOBY

Leave the bottle.

He won't be back.

MRS. LOVETT

(spinning on Todd)

You're barking mad! Killing a man wot

done you no harm!

TODD

He recognized me from the old days. He

tried to blackmail me -- half my

earnings.

MRS. LOVETT

(relieved)

Oh well, that's a different matter!

For a moment there I thought you'd

lost your marbles!

MRS. LOVETT

Ooooh! All that blood! Enough to make

you come all over gooseflesh, ain't

it? Poor bugger. Oh, well.

MRS. LOVETT

(looking through purse)

Three quid! Well, waste not, want not,

I always say...

(she tucks the purse into

her dress)

... Now what are we going to do about

the boy?

TODD

Send him up.

MRS. LOVETT

Oh, we don't need to worry about him,

he's a simple thing. I'll pawn him off

with some story.

Send him up, woman.

MRS. LOVETT

(quickly)

Now, Mr. T., surely one's enough for

today. Don't want to indulge yourself,

after all ...

(she busily starts to

straighten up the room)

... 'Sides, I was thinking about

hiring a lad to help around the shop,

me poor knees not being what they used

to be.

TODD

Anything you say.

JUDGE

Mr. Todd?

TODD

At your service ... An honor to

receive your patronage, my lord.

JUDGE

You know me, sir?

TODD

(a polite bow)

Who in this wide world is not familiar

with the honored Judge Turpin?

JUDGE

These premises are hardly

prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells

me you are the most accomplished of

all the barbers in the city.

TODD

That is gracious of him, sir ...

(indicates for the Judge

to sit)

... Sit, if you please, sir. Sit.

TODD

And what may I do for you today, sir?

A stylish trimming of the hair? A

soothing skin massage?

JUDGE

You see, sir, a man infatuate with love,

Her ardent and eager slave.

So fetch the pomade and pumice stone

And lend me a more seductive tone,

38   CONTINUED: (4)                                              38

A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne,

But first, sir, I think -- a shave.

TODD

The closest I ever gave.

JUDGE

You're in a merry mood today, Mr.

Todd.

TODD

(mixing lather)

'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire

From one man to the next.

JUDGE

'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire

The blood to pound, the heart leap higher.

BOTH

What more, what more can man require--

JUDGE

Than love, sir?

TODD

More than love, sir.

JUDGE

What, sir?

TODD

Women.

Pretty women.

Now then, my friend.

Now to your purpose.

Patience, enjoy it.

Revenge can't be taken in haste.

JUDGE

(opening his eyes)

Make haste, and if we wed,

You'll be commended, sir.

TODD

My lord...

(Goes to him)

And who, may it be said,

Is your intended, sir?

JUDGE

My ward.

JUDGE

And pretty as a rosebud.

TODD

Pretty as her mother?

JUDGE

(mildly puzzled)

What? What was that?

TODD

Oh, nothing, sir. Nothing. May we

proceed?

TODD

Pretty women...

Fascinating...

Sipping coffee, Dancing...

Pretty women.

Sitting in the window or

Standing on the stair,

Something in them

Cheers the air.

Pretty women...

Silhouetted...

Stay within you...

Glancing...

TODD

Stay forever...

Pretty women!

Blowing out their candles or

Combing out their hair...

Johanna elope with you? Deceiving

slut! -- I'll lock her up in some

obscure retreat where neither you nor

any other vile creature shall ever lay

eyes on her again--!

JUDGE

And as for you, barber, it is all too

clear what company you keep. Service

them well and hold their custom -- for

you'll have none of mine.

ANTHONY

Mr. Todd -- you have to help me --

I've talked to Johanna and--!

TODD

OUT! OUT, I SAY!

MRS. LOVETT

All this shouting and running about,

what's happened--?

Beneath my hand--!

MRS. LOVETT

There, there, dear. Don't fret--

TODD

No, I had him!

His throat was there,

And he'll never come again!

MRS. LOVETT

Easy now.

Hush, love, hush.

I keep telling you--

TODD

When?!

MRS. LOVETT

What's your rush?

TODD

Why did I wait?

You told me to wait!

Now he'll never come again...

TODD

There's a hole in the world

Like a great black pit

And it's filled with people

Who are filled with shit

And the vermin of the world

Inhabit it--

But not for long!

TODD

They all deserve to die!

Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett,

Tell you why:

Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett

There are two kinds of men and only two.

There's the one staying put

In his proper place

Look at me, Mrs. Lovett,

Look at you--

TODD

No, we all deserve to die!

Even you, Mrs. Lovett,

Even I.

Because the lives of the wicked should be--

(slashes at the air

violently)

Made brief.

For the rest of us, death

Will be a relief--

We all deserve to die!

And I'll never see Johanna,

No, I'll never hug my girl to me--

There, drink it down -- all the way --

that's right ...

(he does so)

... Now, we got a body molderin' away

upstairs, what do you intend we should

do about that?

TODD

Later on, when it's dark, we'll take

him to some secret place and bury him.

MRS. LOVETT

Well, yes, of course, we could do

that. I don't suppose he's got any

relatives going to come poking around

looking for him...

MRS. LOVETT

Well, you know me, sometimes bright

ideas just pop right into my head, and

I keep thinking...

Seems a downright shame...

TODD

Shame?

MRS. LOVETT

Seems an awful waste...

Such a nice plump frame

Wot's-his-name

Debts to be erased--

If you get my drift...

(Todd has no idea what she

is talking about)

No?

(She sighs)

Seems an awful waste.

I mean,

With the price of meat what it is,

When you get it,

If you get it--

TODD

Ah!

MRS. LOVETT

Good, you got it.

(She warms to the idea)

Take, for instance,

Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop.

Business never better, using only

Pussycats and toast.

And a pussy's good for maybe six or

Seven at the most.

And I'm sure they can't compare

As far as taste--

TODD

Mrs. Lovett,

What a charming notion,

TODD

Eminently practical and yet

Appropriate as always.

Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you

All these years I'll never know!

How delectable!

Also undetectable.

How choice!

How rare!

Well, it does seem a

Waste...

Yes, all around--

It's man devouring man, my dear,

TODD

And who are we

It's priest.

Have a little priest.

MRS. LOVETT

Sir, it's too good,

At least.

Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh,

So it's pretty fresh.

TODD

Awful lot of fat.

MRS. LOVETT

Only where it sat.

Or something like that?

MRS. LOVETT

No, you see the trouble with poet

Is, how do you know it's

Deceased?

Try the priest.

TODD

Since no one should swallow

It twice.

TODD

Anything that's lean.

MRS. LOVETT

Well, then, if you're British and loyal,

You might enjoy Royal

Marine.

Anyway, it's clean.

Though, of course, it tastes of wherever it's been.

imaginary oven)

Is that squire

On the fire?

MRS. LOVETT

Mercy no, sir,

Look closer,

You'll notice it's grocer.

Looks thicker.

More like vicar.

MRS. LOVETT

No, it has to be grocer -- it's green.

Too salty. I prefer general.

MRS. LOVETT

With or without his privates? --

"With" is extra.

It's fop.

Finest in the shop.

He suddenly leaps up and grabs Toby by the throat with

shocking brutality--

TODD

DON'T CHATTER, BOY! You are not to

stop! You are not to speak! You are to

deliver this letter! DO YOU

UNDERSTAND?!

Toby is stunned and terrified. It is the first time he has

seen this side of his friend, Mr. Todd.

Todd releases him. Toby races out.

Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal, back and

forth, back and forth, whispering to himself neurotically, as

day becomes evening...

101   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      101

Toby walks back to the pie shop, upset.

He stops when he sees Todd at the window above, unblinking,

gazing like a falcon into the street.

He continues on to Mrs. Lovett, who is clearing up the

remains of a meal in the outdoor garden.

MRS. LOVETT

Where you been, lad? We had quite the

luncheon rush! Me poor bones is ready

to drop...

(She looks at him, notes

his dark expression.)

What is it, Toby?

He sits. She sits next to him.

TOBY

Mr. Todd sent me on an errand ... And

on the way back I went by the

workhouse. And I was thinkin' ... But

for you I would be there now. Or

someplace worse.

A beat.

TOBY

Seems like the Good Lord sent you for

me.

MRS. LOVETT

Oh, love, I feel quite the same way--

TOBY

Hear me out, mum ... You know there's

nothing I wouldn't do for you. Say, if

there was someone around -- someone

bad -- only you didn't know it--

MRS. LOVETT

(concerned)

What is this? What are you talking

about?

TOBY

Nothing's gonna harm you,

Not while I'm around.

Nothing gonna harm you,

No, sir,

Not while I'm around...

MRS. LOVETT

What do you mean, "someone bad"?

TOBY

Demons are prowling

Everywhere

Nowadays.

I'll send 'em howling,

I don't care--

I got ways.

MRS. LOVETT

Darling, hush now, there's no need for

this...

TOBY

No one's gonna hurt you,

No one's gonna dare.

Others can desert you--

Not to worry--

Whistle, I'll be there.

Demons'll charm you

With a smile

For a while,

But in time

Nothing can harm you,

Not while I'm around.

Music continues:

MRS. LOVETT

What is this foolishness now? What are

you talking about?

TOBY

Little things wot I been thinking ...

About Mr. Todd...

Not to worry, not to worry,

I may not be smart but I ain't dumb.

I can do it,

Put me to it,

Show me something I can overcome.

Not to worry, mum.

He leans into her, she puts her arms around him, but her

expression is deeply troubled.

TOBY

Being close and being clever

Ain't like being true,

I don't need to,

I won't never

Hide a thing from you,

Like some.

Music continues as she nervously comforts him:

MRS. LOVETT

Now, Toby dear, haven't we had enough

of this foolish chatter? ...

MRS. LOVETT (cont'd)

(reaching for her purse)

... Here, how about I give you a shiny

new penny and you can fetch us some

nice toffees--?

She pulls Pirelli's chatelaine purse from her dress--

TOBY

That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

MRS. LOVETT

No, no, love -- this is just something

Mr. T. give me for my birthday--

TOBY

See that proves it -- what I been

thinkin'--

(He stands, urgently

pulling her hand)

We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we

gotta find the Beadle and get the law

here--

She pulls him down to her again, agitated, her mind racing:

MRS. LOVETT

Hush now, Toby, hush ... Here, you

just sit next to me nice and quiet ...

(calming)

... How could you think such a thing

of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?

He calms down a bit as she holds him.

And she comes to a painful, dreadful decision.

MRS. LOVETT

Nothing's gonna harm you,

Not while I'm around.

Nothing's gonna harm you, darling,

Not while I'm around.

(He leans into her)

Demons'll charm you

With a smile

For a while,

But in time

Nothing's gonna harm you,

Not while I'm around.

The music continues as she holds him. There are tears in her

eyes. But we see that her gentle song has calmed him.

MRS. LOVETT

(softly)

Funny we should be having this little

chat right now ... 'Cause I was just

thinkin', you know how you've always

fancied coming into the bakehouse with

me to help make the pies?

TOBY

(dreamily)

Yes, ma'am.

She quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her.

MRS. LOVETT

(smiles)

Well ... no time like the present.

102   INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            102

Mrs. Lovett leads Toby down the claustrophobic, long stairway

toward the bakehouse.

TOBY

My heart bleeds for you havin' to go

up and down all these stairs!

MRS. LOVETT

Well, that'll be your job now.

TOBY

Yes, ma'am!

She arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse. We can

hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within.

She unbolts the door and ushers Toby in.

And we finally enter...

103   INT. THE BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                              103

A macabre vision of Hell.

The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. The grisly

tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,

stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of

questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat

hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.

A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover

an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the

barber shop above.

103   CONTINUED:                                                  103

And eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming

from a large industrial oven against one wall.

Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:

TOBY

Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?

She indicates the sewer grates:

MRS. LOVETT

Those grates go right down to the

sewers and the whiffs come up, always

a few rats gone home to Jesus down

there.

TOBY

So -- where do I start?!

She leads him across to the thrumming, fiery oven:

MRS. LOVETT

Now this would be the bake oven ...

Ten dozen at a time. Always be sure

the doors is closed properly, like

this.

TOBY

(trying to remember it

all)

Yes'm, always closed properly.

She leads him to the meat grinder:

MRS. LOVETT

And here's the grinder ...

(demonstrates it)

... You pop in the meat, give it a

good grind and it comes out here.

TOBY

(practicing with the

grinder)

Good grind, comes out there.

MRS. LOVETT

That's my boy. Smoothly, smoothly --

Now I've got to pop upstairs, back in

two shakes, all right?

TOBY

Yes'm.

She begins to go. He stops her with:

TOBY

Do you think I might have a pie while

I wait?

She turns. He is standing at a rack of cooling pies.

MRS. LOVETT

As many as you like, son ... As many

as you like.

She goes and shuts the door behind her.

104    INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            104

She leans against the bakehouse door, tormented, gasping for

air. Then she slowly bolts the door.

A120

105   INT. FOGG'S ASYLUM -- EVENING                              105

A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are

slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low

ceiling pressing down.

We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,

walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries

a large pair of scissors.

FOGG

... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be

to our mutual interest to come to some

arrangement in regard to my poor

children's hair.

He moves to one of the cells and unlocks it:

FOGG

I keep the blondes over here. It was

yellow hair you was looking for, sir?

ANTHONY

Yes.

Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde

women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees

Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral

animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.

ANTHONY

(points)

That one has hair the shade I need.

Fogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony:

FOGG

Come, child. Smile for the gentleman

and you shall have a sweetie.

Johanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says

nothing.

FOGG

(prepares scissors)

Now, where shall I cut?

Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his

clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.

He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.

ANTHONY

Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be

your last ... Now, I leave you to the

mercy of your "children."

He grabs Johanna and pulls her away.

Mr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They

slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they

are going to rip him limb from limb...

106   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      106

Todd and Mrs. Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the

barber shop, urgent. Todd has a razor.

MRS. LOVETT

... I got him locked in -- but if he

escapes he'll go to the law!

TODD

Then he can't escape.

MRS. LOVETT

Mr. T. -- I don't know -- maybe we

could--

TODD

The Judge will be here soon! I have no

time, woman! Come on--!

They turn a corner and walk straight into--

The Beadle!

MRS. LOVETT

Excuse me, sir! -- You gave me a

fright.

BEADLE

Not my intention, good madam, though I

am here on official business.

(elaborately prepares a

pinch of snuff)

You see, there's been complaints.

About the stink from your chimney.

They say at night, it's something most

foul. Health regulations -- and the

general public welfare, naturally --

being my duty, I'm afraid I'll have to

take a look ...

(inhales the snuff,

Sneezes and daintily

wipes his nose)

... at your bakehouse.

TODD

(smoothly)

Of course ... But first why don't you

come upstairs and let me attend to

you?

BEADLE

Much as I do appreciate tonsorial

adornment, I really ought see to my

"official" obligations first.

TODD

An admirable sentiment -- But I must

ask you, out of professional curiosity

you understand, is that a cream or a

tallow pomade?

BEADLE

(touches his hair)

Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is

a touch of ambergris.

TODD

But, sir, hair that delicate requires

a genuine pomade! Come along, let me

show you the difference.

BEADLE

(considering)

Well ... you are the expert in these

matters...

TODD

And we'll finish you off with a nice

facial rub of bay rum.

BEADLE

Oooh, bay rum is bracing.

TODD

And all on the house, for my friend,

Beadle Bamford.

BEADLE

Well, sir, I take that very kindly ...

Lead on.

TODD

(bowing)

I am, sir, entirely at your --

(his eyes flit to Mrs.

Lovett)

-- disposal.

He leads the Beadle away.

Mrs. Lovett allows herself a breath.

107   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                   107

From across the street, we see Todd leading the Beadle up the

stairs to the barber shop, chatting with him easily.

We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman,

hunched across the street, watching them closely.

108   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                                  108

Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the

bakehouse.

He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws,

curious.

Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into

his mouth and pulls something out. Looks at it:

It is a fingernail.

To be exact, it is the severed tip of a finger.

Toby drops it in horror and starts back--

Suddenly, a loud THUMPING and CLANGING makes him spin,

alarmed--

As --

The bloody body of the Beadle EXPLODES SUDDENLY from the

mouth of the chute--

Toby screams and races to the door--

Pulls at it. Locked. No use. He bangs on the heavy iron door

wildly:

TOBY

MRS. LOVETT! MRS. LOVETT! LET ME OUT!

MRS. LOVETT!

The thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match

his frenzy as--

In panic, Toby races to the sewer grate, yanks it up and

disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle

SCREAMS and we cut to--

109   INT. BARBER SHOP -- EVENING                                   109

Todd stands by the chair, his razor high--

His eyes blazing--

His face covered in a spray of blood--

Lost in rapture.

Not for long.

The Gentleman, the Banker, the General move into the frame

with purpose, impatient.

The Gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean

the blood off Todd's face -- he is not gentle, the blood

smears--

GENTLEMAN

The engine roared, the motor hissed,

And who could see how the road would twist...?

Meanwhile, the Banker pulls off Todd's stained barber tunic

and hands Todd his jacket--

BANKER

In Sweeney's ledger the entries matched:

A Beadle arrived, and a Beadle dispatched...

Meanwhile, the General is cleaning up the blood on the barber

chair--

Of Sweeney Todd...

GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL

The Demon Barber of Fleet...

SUDDENLY -- a sharp cry from across the room -- Todd spins--

OTHER GHOSTS (O.S.)

SWEENEY!

GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL

...Street!

Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are

moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see

the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others.

They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching

Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama --

GHOSTS

(variously)

Sweeney! Sweeney!

Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!

By now the ghosts are fully Furies, demented and threatening--

GHOSTS

Sweeney!

The screeching music transforms into a strange symphony of

inarticulate moans and howls and chants, taking us to...

Todd and Mrs. Lovett are searching for Toby through a

111   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     111

Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop. She is now

dressed as a scruffy boy, a cap hiding her hair. She is

distracted and disturbed.

ANTHONY

Mr. Todd...? No matter. You wait for

him here -- I'll return with the coach

in less than half an hour...

She gently touches Todd's collection of razors...

ANTHONY

Don't worry, darling, in those

clothes, no one will recognize you ...

You're safe now.

She picks up the largest razor, looks at it, an eerie echo of

her father.

JOHANNA

(darkly ironic)

Safe ... So we run away and then all

our dreams come true?

ANTHONY

I hope so...

JOHANNA

I have never had dreams. Only

nightmares.

ANTHONY

Johanna ... When we're free of this

place all the ghosts will go away.

She looks at him very intensely:

JOHANNA

No, Anthony, they never go away.

He gently touches her face.

ANTHONY

I'll be right back to you ... Half an

hour and we'll be free.

He goes.

She turns to the window, watches him go. Her expression is

sad: he will never fully comprehend her depth.

Then she sees the Beggar Woman approaching from across the

street...

112   EXT. PIE SHOP -- NIGHT                                       112

The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber

shop:

Beadle ... Beadle ...

BEGGAR WOMAN (V.O.)

Beadle ... Beadle...

Johanna looks around urgently, sees the large chest. She

quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as--

The Beggar Woman enters.

BEGGAR WOMAN

Beadle dear, Beadle...

The room has a strange effect on her, as if she were vaguely

recalling some distant dream. She intones to pretty lullaby

music...

BEGGAR WOMAN

Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling,

Beadle, dumpling, Be-deedle dumpling...

SUDDENLY--

Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the

room--

TODD

What are you doing here?!

BEGGAR WOMAN

(clutching at his arm)

Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of

evil -- from below -- from her! ...

He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge:

TODD

Be quiet, woman!

BEGGAR WOMAN

now)

Hey, don't I know you, mister?

Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge! -- walking toward the shop--

Todd has no time--!

The music THUNDERS as--

In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor -

- fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair --

pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor--

He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as--

The Judge enters.

JUDGE

Where is she? Where's the girl?

TODD

Below, your Honor. With my neighbor.

Thank heavens the sailor did not

molest her. Thank heavens, too, she

has seen the error of her ways.

JUDGE

She has?

TODD

Oh yes, sir, your lesson was well

learned. She speaks only of you,

longing for forgiveness.

JUDGE

Then she shall have it. She'll be here

soon, you say?

The music builds, the pace increases:

You're in a merry mood again today,

barber.

TODD

Pretty women!

What we do for

They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the

Judge's face and then reaches for his razor:

JUDGE

Pretty women!

Blowing out their candles

Combing out their hair--

Then they leave--

Even when they leave you

And vanish, they somehow

Can still remain

There with you there...

TODD

Pretty women!

Blowing out their candles

Or combing out their hair,

Even when they leave,

They still

Are there,

They're there...

The music builds dangerously as:

JUDGE

How seldom it is one meets a fellow

spirit!

TODD

With fellow tastes -- in women, at

least.

JUDGE

What? What's that?

The years no doubt have changed me,

Benjamin Barker!

TODD

BENJAMIN BARKER!

The factory whistle screams a steady, terrible blast as--

Todd brutally SLASHES the Judge's throat--

Severing his jugular--

The spray of blood drenches Todd--

He pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight

down the chute.

The music continues...

As Todd stands for a long moment, blood dripping from his

face, exalted.

Then he sinks to his knees, overcome.

The music stops.

A long beat of silence.

Then Todd looks at his razor deeply:

TODD

Rest now, my friend,

Rest now forever,

Sleep now the untroubled

Sleep of the angels.

Then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and

looks at it.

We focus on his face.

His quest is completed.

His demons silenced.

The ghosts are gone.

It's done.

He just kneels there. No reason to move. No purpose in life.

Then...

A sound from the chest. A slight thump.

His eyes dart to the chest.

He slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest. Then

suddenly WRENCHES it open and HAULS out Johanna--

TODD

(darkly)

Come for a shave, have you, lad?

JOHANNA

No -- I...

He tosses her in the chair, throws back his arm, his razor

ready--

TODD

Surely, yes! Everyone needs a good

shave--!

SUDDENLY -- A PIERCING SCREAM ECHOES UP FROM THE CHUTE --

Mrs. Lovett's voice -- screaming to raise the dead--

Todd rivets Johanna, pointing the razor at her, a lethal

warning:

TODD

Forget my face.

He spins and bolts out of the shop, leaving her sitting in

the chair--

114   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- NIGHT                                      114

Mrs. Lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute.

The Judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt--

She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip--

MRS. LOVETT

Die! Die! God in heaven -- die!

The Judge's fingers finally relax their grip; he is dead.

Panting, Mrs. Lovett, backs away from him and for the first

time notices the body of the Beggar Woman.

MRS. LOVETT

You! Can it be? Have all the demons of

Hell come to torment me?!

She grabs the Beggar Woman and starts dragging her quickly

toward the oven as Todd races in:

TODD

Why did you scream? Does the Judge

live still?

MRS. LOVETT

He was clutching, holding on to my

dress, but he's finished now...

She continues quickly dragging the Beggar Woman toward the

oven.

TODD

Leave them to me. Open the doors.

He waves her toward the oven--

MRS. LOVETT

No! Don't touch her!

TODD

Open the doors!

He shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the

Beggar Woman's body--

TODD

What's the matter with you? It's only

a silly old beggar--

Then -- Mrs. Lovett opens the oven doors--

The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as

the fiery light slashes across the floor--

Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman.

A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is. Music continues

and builds as:

TODD

Oh no! ... Oh God ... "Don't I know

you?" she said ...

He looks up to Mrs. Lovett:

TODD

You knew she lived. From the moment

that I came into your shop you knew my

Lucy lived!

MRS. LOVETT

I was only thinking of you!

TODD

(looking down again)

Lucy...

MRS. LOVETT

Your Lucy! A crazy hag picking bones

and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans!

Would you have wanted to know she

ended up like that?

TODD

(looking up)

You lied to me...

MRS. LOVETT

(desperately)

No, no, not lied at all.

No, I never lied.

TODD

(to Beggar Woman)

Lucy...

MRS. LOVETT

Said she took the poison -- she did --

Never said that she died --

Poor thing,

She lived--

TODD

I've come home again...

MRS. LOVETT

But it left her weak in the head,

All she did for months was just lie there in bed--

TODD

Lucy...

MRS. LOVETT

Should've been in hospital,

Wound up in Bedlam instead,

Poor thing!

TODD

Oh, my God...

MRS. LOVETT

Better you should think she was dead.

(passionately)

Yes, I lied 'cos I love you!

TODD

Lucy...

MRS. LOVETT

I'd be twice the wife she was!

I love you!

Could that thing have cared for you

Like me?

TODD

(a harrowing keen)

WHAT HAVE I DONE?!

Todd's eyes suddenly snap up to Mrs. Lovett -- as the

glorious "Little Priest" waltz theme returns--

TODD

Mrs. Lovett,

You're a bloody wonder,

Eminently practical and yet

Appropriate as always,

As you've said repeatedly,

There's little point in dwelling on the past.

He steps toward her, she steps back, unsure, as they sing

simultaneously:

TODD

No, come here, my love...

Not a thing to fear,

My love...

What's dead

Is dead.

MRS. LOVETT

Do you mean it?

Everything I did I swear I thought

Was only for the best,

Believe me!

(a heartbreaking plea)

Can we still be

Married?

Todd steps toward her darkly.

She knows she is doomed.

But steps into his arms anyway for a final, triumphant waltz:

TODD

The history of the world, my pet--

MRS. LOVETT

(through tears)

Oh, Mr. Todd,

Ooh, Mr. Todd,

Leave it to me...

TODD

Is learn forgiveness and try to forget.

MRS. LOVETT

(the lost dream)

By the sea, Mr. Todd,

We'll be comfy-cozy,

By the sea, Mr. Todd,

Where there's no one nosy...

He waltzes her toward the roaring oven.

She offers no resistance, fully aware of what's coming.

The blazing, thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem

they are the damned, dancing through Hell.

TODD

And life is for the alive, my dear,

So let's keep living it--!

BOTH

Just keep living it,

Really living it--!

The music reaches a thundering crescendo as--

He flings her into the oven and slams the doors--

We hear her screaming. And banging on the oven doors.

Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as

the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence.

Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar

Woman.

He cradles her head in his arms.

TODD

There was a barber and his wife,

And she was beautiful.

A foolish barber and his wife,

She was his reason and his life.

And she was beautiful.

And she was virtuous.

And he was...

Todd folds himself over his dead wife.

The only sound his deep, anguished sobs.

A long beat.

Then he becomes aware of something. He looks over to see....

Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate. He has seen

everything.

Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up. Todd gently

sets Lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face Toby.

A long beat as they look at each other.

Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todd's razor.

Todd looks at him.

Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck.

He bends his head back, offering his naked throat.

Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat.

Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound

of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe.

Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse.

Todd leans forward, dying.

We cut to his point-of-view:

The rough brick floor...

From the bottom of the frame...

A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up

the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in

the blood...

114   CONTINUED: (6)                                              114

Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

We realize this is the first image we saw in the story.

Todd's perspective. Todd's blood. As he dies.

As before, the Gentleman's face appears, reflected in the

pool of blood...

GENTLEMAN

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,

His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

The Banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse...

BANKER

He shaved the faces of gentlemen

Who never thereafter were heard of again.

The General emerges ... and the Tourist ... and the Priest

... and the Student...

GHOSTS

(variously)

He trod a path that few have trod,

Did Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Then a new ghost ... a face we recognize ... the Beggar

Woman...

BEGGAR WOMAN

He kept a shop in London town,

Of fancy clients and good renown.

She is joined by the Judge...

JUDGE

And what if none of their souls were saved?

They went to their maker impeccably shaved.

BEGGAR WOMAN, JUDGE AND GHOSTS

By Sweeney,

By Sweeney Todd,

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

The Beadle and Pirelli join the ghosts...

PIRELLI AND BEADLE

Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!

Hold it to the skies!

Freely flows the blood of those

Who moralize!

The ghosts move around the bakehouse, considering the meat

grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block...

GHOSTS

(variously)

His needs are few, his room is bare.

He hardly uses his fancy chair.

The more he bleeds, the more he lives.

He never forgets and he never forgives.

Perhaps today you gave a nod

To Sweeney Todd.

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Hunting like predators, we begin to move urgently through the

ghosts. Their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls

and ceiling of the bakehouse. The fiery red roar of the bake

oven builds in intensity...

GHOSTS

(variously)

Sweeney wishes the world away,

Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,

Hugging the blade, waiting the years,

Hearing the music that nobody hears.

Sweeney waits in the parlor hall,

Sweeney leans on the office wall.

No one can help, nothing can hide you--

Isn't that Sweeney there beside you?

Sweeney wishes the world away,

Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,

Is Sweeney!

There he is, it's Sweeney!

Sweeney! Sweeney!

We tear through them with increasing frenzy -- cutting

quickly, vertiginous angles -- as the music builds--

GHOSTS

(variously)

There! There! There! There!

There! There! There!

(almost a scream now)

There!

They move away--

Revealing--

Todd and Mrs. Lovett. Facing each other.

We circle them:

GHOSTS

Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd!

He served a dark and a hungry god!

TODD

(sharply to Mrs. Lovett)

To seek revenge may lead to hell.

MRS. LOVETT

(coldly to him)

But everyone does it, if seldom as well--

TODD AND MRS. LOVETT

--As Sweeney...

GHOSTS

As Sweeney Todd...

The Demon Barber of Fleet...

The ghosts begin to disappear ... fading into the shadows of

the bakehouse ... leaving Todd and Mrs. Lovett alone...

GHOSTS

... Street!

The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand

alone, continuing to glare at each other.

Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into

the darkness.

He stands alone.

And we cut to--

A series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music --

Todd's life flashing before his eyes --

The images building as the music races toward its conclusion--

Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding--

The final crash of music at the final image:

Todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the

bakehouse floor.

He falls...

Into the blood.

Dead.
